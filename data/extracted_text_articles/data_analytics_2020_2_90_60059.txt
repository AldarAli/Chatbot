Abstract— Adults over the age of 65 years may be
considered as a vulnerable population prone to having falls,
which may have huge consequences. Machine learning is being
explored as an approach to understanding better the specific
risk factors for falling. However, most studies use composite
population data rather than including data on male or female
gender in the analysis. This study focused on using machine
learning models utilizing healthcare data to establish whether
gendered data gives a more accurate prediction of falling.
Splitting the data into male and female gives slightly higher
predictive accuracy, however, reducing the size of the dataset is
likely to give a lower prediction. Such models could provide
useful information to health and social care professionals in
their daily decision-making with individuals and families about
optimal care arrangements.

INTRODUCTION
Public Health England reported that a third of the
population of adults over 65 years old is likely to fall at least
once per calendar year [1]. They also reported that half of
the population over 80 years old is likely to fall once per
year. It is estimated that 255,000 adults over the age of 65
years old who fall are admitted to hospital in England [2].
Similar to Public Health England, the Health Executive in
Ireland reported that 30% of adults over 65 years old in
Ireland will fall at least once per year [3].
It is quite common to be defined as being in a
vulnerable group of adults if they are over the age of 65
years as they are unfortunately more prone to falls [4].
There is also an increased prevalence of fear of falling in
older adults whether or not they have already fallen [5].
With the increased risk of falling in older adults, there is a
tendency
to
lose
confidence
when
living
at
home
independently. There is also a high possibility of losing
mobility due to falls, resulting in further injury. Overall,
falls affect health and social care services due to the
increasing costs that arise [3]. It is estimated that falls cost
the National Health Service in England around £2.3 billion
per year [6].
Falls affect not only the individual, but may also have
implications for the individual’s family and decisions by
health and social care professionals. After an older person
falls, a shared decision between individuals, families and
health and social care professionals may be made on
whether or not the individual can continue living at home
safely [7]. Health and Social Care professionals make these
types of decisions every day in order to support the well-
being of an older adult. Decisions regarding the elderly are
best when they are shared between all parties and ensure an
appropriate safe care package is in place [7].
Falls may
occur due to factors such as poor eyesight, low blood
pressure, medication or cognitive impairment [8]. As
humans we all experience positive and negative risks in the
world we live in. Generally, older adults encounter more
negative risks like burns [9], forgetting to take medication or
taking too much medication [10] and falling [11]. Figure 1
illustrates a small number of the categorized risk factors that
older adults experience. Figure 1 is based on the health care
risk factors that have been based on a review of the
literature.
Figure 1.
Associated Risks with Older Adults
There is a view that medical research is failing to
include gender differences when analyzing data [12].
Therefore, research could potentially be predominantly
based on one gender, and generalized over both genders. It
is important to include results for both genders in order to
implement the best practice for individuals within health and
social care research [12]. For example, medical imaging is
one field that has implemented gender balance and hence is
developing more accurate algorithms in order to help assist
medical doctors in diagnosing diseases [13]. Ferrante et al.
produced a study, which aims to display the importance of
gender balance using medical imaging datasets while
training artificial intelligence systems for diagnosis [13].
During the study they found that genders that were
underrepresented caused a decrease in performance. To
overcome bias, training samples should include the details
of the sample in terms of male and female so the data can be
used for analysis purposes.
In this study, we utilize machine learning models to
estimate the negative risks of falls in older adults as the
study techniques allow us to examine the male and female
data
individually.
We,
as
humans,
use
our
attained
knowledge to predict different outcomes on a daily basis.
Machine learning helps to analyse, design and develop
systems [14] with the ability to learn new trends or patterns
within the data [15] in a consistent and objective way, but
they are subject to underlying bias in the data from which
the models are obtained. Machine learning is becoming

popular within the health and social care sector to predict
adverse outcomes. With the ability to aid health and social
care professionals in decision making, the health sector has
adopted machine learning approaches, such as diagnosing
respiratory conditions from chest x-rays [16], detecting
signs of lung cancer at an early stage [17] and identifying
patients who need to be moved to the intensive care unit
[18]. Meaningful information can be extracted with machine
learning and used to help assist health and social care
professionals in their daily job by finding correlations within
data that could ideally be used to help improve the level of
care and help reduce costs overall within the health sector
[19]. The aim of this study was to use machine learning
algorithms to predict the likelihood of falls in older adults
by performing experiments and analyses on separate male
and female data. The paper is organised as follows: Section
2 outlines machine learning methods and the gendered
dataset used; the experiments and results are followed in
Section 3; the paper is then brought to a conclusion in
Section 4 with future work proposed.
II. MACHINE LEARNING & GENDERED DATA
In this study, we explore how different machine
learning algorithms work in identifying gender differences
in the underlying data. The Waikato Environment for
Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) [20]
is an open source
machine learning software program that has been used for
this study. Within WEKA, we have used a number of
different machine learning approaches, as detailed below.
Firstly, we use the Naïve Bayes algorithm, which
implements Bayes Theorem whereby the probability for
each class is calculated from the training data supporting
both binary and multiclass classification problems. We also
use
Support
Vector
Machines
with
Support
Vector
Classification (SVC). SVC manages missing data as well as
nominal attributes. Multilayer Perceptron is a class of neural
networks and contains one or more hidden layers, which we
also use within WEKA. WEKA also contains a number of
decision
tree-based
approaches.
Decision
trees
are
supportive of classification and regression and evaluate data
by beginning at the root node of a tree and moving down
towards the leaves until a prediction can be made. We use
PART [20], which builds a partial C4.5 decision tree in each
iteration and the best leaf is then made into a rule. A
Random Forest classifier [20] is used, which constructs a
multitude of trees for classification and regression purposes.
Probabilistic approaches such as Bayes Net [20], which is a
probabilistic model representing a set of variables and
conditional dependencies can also be utilized. Logistic
models are also used to predict the probability of a class or
event existing by using a logistic function to model binary
variables. A
Simple
Logistic
algorithm
models
the
probability of the output in terms of the input. Lastly,
Classification via Regression completes classification using
regression methods. One regression model is built for each
class value. Each of these models will be used in Section III,
where experiments and results are presented.
In this study, we use the Irish Longitudinal Study on
Ageing (TILDA) dataset along with the WEKA program for
falls prediction. The dataset is split into gender-based
datasets - male and female. We subsequently use the
machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of falls
for males and females independently and thus determine if
gender has an effect on machine learning algorithms
prediction accuracy. The TILDA dataset is based on adults
over the age of 50 years who live in a community dwelling
in Ireland [21]. The dataset is split into three different
waves, each collected in different years. Wave 1 consists of
data collected from 2009 to 2011. Wave 2 data were
collected during 2012 and 2013 and, lastly, Wave 3 data
were collected in 2015 and 2016. For the purposes of this
study, only Wave 1 data have been utilized. TILDA has
been used in numerous studies previously [22].
III. EXPERIMENTS & RESULTS
A number of machine learning algorithms were selected
from WEKA’s machine learning environment to form
predictions alongside The Irish Longitudinal Study on
Aging dataset. These algorithms were used to train models
to predict if an individual is likely to fall depending on
whether they are male or female. Previous work has
identified the risk of an older adult falling using the same
dataset [22], but not considering gender differences.
This study presents a deeper analysis of the two genders
(male and female) to determine any patterns. There is a
number of input factors used in each of the models such as:
“Overall health description”, “Emotional mental health”,
“Long-term health issues”, “Afraid of falling”, “Joint or hip
replacements” and any “Previous blackouts or fainting”
episodes. A binary classification is the desired target output,
corresponding to either fall or no fall. Each input risk factor
has been added incrementally to the training inputs of each
model to ensure each one is of importance and if not, it was
subsequently removed. Each dataset was split into a training
and testing set and to remain consistent with previous work
this split was defined as 90%/10%. To ensure consistency in
the reported classifier accuracy, ten-fold cross validation
was used throughout all experiments. Each algorithm used
the
standard
selection
of
hyperparameter
optimization
methods, Auto-WEKA does this using a fully automated
approach. Table I displays results based on previous work
[22], showing accuracies from 56% - 62%. The lowest
accuracy of 56% was
obtained using the
Multilayer
Perceptron machine learning technique and the highest
accuracy of 62% was obtained using the Classification via
Regression algorithm. The results below were based on
using the full dataset n=3242.

In Table II, we present results for the same experiment
as in Table I using the full dataset except that we have now
included gender as another input factor. This enables us to
identify if gender has any effect on each of the models and
hence determine if there are gender differences.
Table II results demonstrate the significant increase in
accuracy when including male and female as a binary input
in comparison to Table I. The predictive performance of the
algorithms in Table II are higher overall and vary between
57% - 66%. The best performing model is Simple Logistic
and Classification via
Regression classifying with an
accuracy of 66%. The poorest performing algorithm at 57%
was again the Multilayer Perceptron. This single model
approach has proved to be sufficient in identifying that
gender differences exists; the inclusion of gender, enabled
all algorithms to classify the data better than when gender
was not included (Table I).

As gender differences are evident, we investigated this
further by separating the dataset into male and female
records, in each dataset n=1364. However, this results in a
reduced number of records per dataset compared with the
results presented in Tables I and II. The results n=3242 and
n=1364 are not directly half of the full dataset as the full
dataset had a random number of both male and females
whereas the smaller dataset included the same number of
male (n=682) and females (n=682) to total 1364 in the
smaller dataset. Results using only male data from the
dataset are presented in Table III. There are no significant
differences in the performance of each of the machine
learning algorithms. The highest classification accuracy was
consistently achieved by four algorithms; Support Vector
Classification, Logistic, Simple Logistic and Classification
via Regression which, all correctly classify 59% of falls and
no falls correctly.

The results for only female data from the dataset are
presented in Table IV. The results are again not significantly
different in terms of the machine learning algorithms with
respect to the best performance. However, we note the
overall classification accuracy results are slightly higher
than the male only data using the same amount of records as
the male dataset n=1364. The three algorithms that correctly
classified the data with 61% accuracy are Naïve Bayes,
Bayes Net and Logistic. The Logistic model remained
consistent providing the highest overall accuracy for both
the individual male data and individual female data.

If we compare the results in Tables III and IV with the
results in Table II, we can see that the single model, using
the gender data, classifies the output more accurately than
two individual gender-based models. However, this could be
attributed to the fact that there is more than twice as much
data used to generate the results in Table II, compared with
Tables III and IV. Therefore, for fair comparison with
69

balanced datasets, we re-ran the experiment illustrated
in Table II, using only 50% of the dataset (n=1621) and the
results
are

A comparison of the results in Tables III, IV and V
demonstrates the similarity of results. However, the female
data in Table IV are slightly better. A comparison of Table
V with Table II (the only difference being that Table V uses
half the dataset) demonstrates a slight decrease in predictive
accuracy due to using fewer records. The use of male and
female data as an input variable demonstrates gender
differences in the data, and that predictive accuracy can be
improved using male and female data as an input variable.
The results are not significant enough to justify the use of
individual models for gender due to the smaller data set; a
single model with gender as an input is sufficient to classify
the data. It should be noted that the TILDA dataset is
collected
through
self-declaration
and,
therefore,
performance accuracy of 50%-70% is as high as one would
expect for such a dataset that is not collected in a controlled
manner.
IV. CONCLUSION
This study has explored ten different machine learning
algorithms utilizing the data from The Longitudinal Study
on Ageing. The risk factors explored were: Overall Health
Description, Long-Term Health, Emotional Mental Health,
Afraid of Falling, Joint Replacements and Blackouts or
Fainting. The dataset was split into two, separating male
data from the female data to find correlations or patterns
when comparing against the dataset that included both male
and female together. This was an attempt to distinguish
whether there were any gender differences. A reduction in
the size of the dataset lowers predictive accuracy as
expected, but splitting the data into male and female gives
slightly higher predictive accuracy in both cases with the
female data outperforming the male. The slightly higher
predictive accuracy of the female compared to the male data
suggests that the risk factors used are slightly more relevant
for females than males based on this data. For this data it is
apparent that separating male and female was beneficial. To
be useful in practice and delivery of services, these
computer models must be understandable and acceptable to
health and social care professionals as potentially they could
be of help in their daily job when guiding and making
decisions by individuals and families. It is important that
health and social care professionals view males and females
differently when looking at risk factors that affect the
elderly. Further work proposed is to develop visualization
methods
to
visualize
risk
to
health and
social
care
professionals.
