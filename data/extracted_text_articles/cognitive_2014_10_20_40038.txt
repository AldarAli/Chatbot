Abstract—The article contains the concept of developing a 
motivation model aimed at supporting activity of both students 
and teachers in the process of implementing and using an open 
and distance learning system. Proposed motivation model is 
focused on the task of filling the knowledge repository with 
high quality didactic material. Open and distance learning 
system assures a computer space for the teaching/learning 
process in open environment. The structure of the motivation 
model and formal assumptions are described. Additionally, 
there is presented a structure of the linguistic database, helping 
the teacher to assess the student's motivation and the basic 
simulation model to analysis the teaching/learning process 
constrains. The proposed approach is based on the games 
theory and simulation approach.  
Keywords-motivation model; computer learning platform; 
knowledge repository; non-cooperative game. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Open and Distance Learning Systems can be considered 
as a new stage of information system evolution in the 
distance learning domain [1]. Basic concept comes from 
Open and Distance Learning (ODL), which is an idea of the 
learning/teaching process organization in higher education 
institutions [2]. The “distance” aspect describes an 
educational situation, where the student is situated in a 
different place than the source of knowledge and the other 
participants of the teaching/learning process. All the 
communication and socialization is maintained by the 
information system. The “open” aspect of ODL is visible at 
many levels: social, technical, computer and organizational 
[3].  
Implementation of Open and Distance Learning Systems 
[4] will most probably introduce changes to the entire 
organization of the education process at higher education 
institutions, and consequently – changes in the role and 
relationship between all participants of the learning process 
while still maintaining status-quo regarding the traditional 
mission of a university: preparing highly-qualified staff. 
In traditional education, the level of competence a 
student obtained at a university depended on various factors 
[5], the main of which are: education process organization at 
all levels (starting from the curriculum, syllabuses, up to the 
classes themselves), equipment, ergonomic conditions, and 
most importantly – the staff qualification. The position of 
each university among others is decided on the basis of a 
ranking [6] that considers basic activities of each teacher 
and the university as a whole: didactic, research, and 
educational. 
ODL can be considered as a new teaching technology, it 
is as good as well it expands everyone’s possibilities to learn 
in every life-situation, practically without constraints, 
however, the teachers charisma [7], one of very important 
motivation factors, becomes lost. Open learning joined with 
the distance learning mode requires students to become 
active, almost equal to teachers participants of the education 
process. It is cause by two factors: 
1. In ODL conditions  students’ preferences highly 
influence the market position of a university. 
2. Lack of direct contact with the teacher calls for an 
conscious student, creating his or her cognitive 
process independently.

Under the influence of these factors, the education 
organization management system should consider the new 
position of the student and reflect it in the frames of a 
proper 
motivation 
model. 
Source 
of 
the 
research 
behaviour/attitude: 
• 
Teacher and students should elaborate a new 
product – the didactic materials repository. 
• 
There is the opportunity to direct collaboration 
between students and the teacher.  
• 
Student has opportunity to consciously choose a 
task in accordance with his/her own criteria (e.g. 
level of task’s complexity). 
The final result of the student’s learning process depends on 
his/her involvement in the repository development. 
The problem of motivation is one of the more important 
research subjects of psychology and pedagogy. There are 
many definitions of this concept [8][9], according to which 
motivation as a phenomenon can be seen as: 
a) A system of factors (needs, motives, goals, plans, 
etc.) determining human actions. 
b) A process that supports human activity at a certain 
level. 
 When developing a motivation model as a part of an 
information system aimed at managing an education 
organization in ODL conditions, one has to define the place 
of this model in the system, its criteria function and solution 
method.  
In the article, we present a model of a system, in which 
students and teachers are focus on a new goal - creating the 
repository with the high quality didactic materials. To 
achieve this goal, the motivation factors of the learning 
process participants should be considered, and the analytical 
mechanism for the assessment of the learning process 
constrains should be proposed. Our model covers the 
formalization of the learning process environment based on 
the motivation and offers a simulation as a mechanism 
supporting the teacher to influence on his/her and students 
motivation taking into account the typical  learning process 
constrains (eg., work time).  
II. 
MODEL OF THE DIDACTIC MATERIALS 
REPRESENTATION 
In the conditions of no direct contact between the teacher 
and students, the scope and way of performing the 
knowledge-based actions (didactic, research, educational) 
changes significantly [10]. It occurs due to the various 
reasons.  In the traditional learning, the didactic materials 
play the complement role to the teacher's charisma and their 
improvement requires a long time because of the source of 
knowledge (books, journals, scripts etc.). However, such 
accumulating and improving of knowledge resources often 
does not fulfil its purpose due to rapidly changing situation 
on the technology market. It especially can be seen in a such 
domains as: computer science (continuously incoming new 
software frameworks), printing (new pdf-based workflow), 
banking (new banking products), etc. [24].  
Moreover, in traditional learning the motivation occurs 
through assessing knowledge (tests, exams, etc.). The teacher 
acts a middle-man between the knowledge source and the 
student’s cognitive process and is responsible for its control 
[11]. As a management object, the student’s cognitive 
process is characterized by high level of entropy, but through 
direct contact, through exchanging information, the teacher, 
on the basis of his/her own competence, continuously lowers 
the entropy level, meaning that the teacher controls the 
student’s cognitive process in certain boundaries. The 
effectiveness of this control depends highly on the intensity 
of interaction and on the interpersonal skills of the teacher. 
Kushtina [4] showed that the role of didactic materials in 
the ODL conditions is greatly increased because of the new 
expectation - to substitute direct contact and exchange the 
information between teacher and student. This imposes new 
requirements to display in the didactic materials not only the 
information, but also knowledge in the learned subject or 
topic. Moreover, the role of didactic materials in ODL 
conditions comes from the assumption that knowledge is a 
visual and textual information structured according to the 
goal and level of education. 
Processing information received by a human into the 
form of knowledge takes place with the help of internal 
cognitive operations like [12]: structuring, coding and 
clustering as well as creating a kind of internal semantic 
network, which we can consider subjective ontologies [13]. 
In order for the didactic material to be in any way 
capable of playing the role of a broker between the source of 
information and the cognitive process of a student, it should 
contain the ontology of the taught subject, developed by the 
teacher. Currently, the ontology is a widely used method for 
knowledge representation. There are ontology description 
languages and programs to operate them. Advantages of 
using the ontological approach to learning are discussed in 
[29]. As it was there  presented, this method is recognized as 
a crucial in the development of the student's analytical skills 
and elaboration the system vision of wide field of 
knowledge objects and their applications. 
 A more detailed description of constructing didactic 
materials on the basis of an ontological model was described 
by Kushtina et al. [23]. 
Preparing and making available the ODL didactic 
material 
through 
appropriate 
computer 
environment 
(repository) requires great efforts regarding intelligence and 
working time of the teacher. The computer aspects of the 
repository were already discussed by Mayer [14] and the 
proper repository development involves substantial money 
capital and consumes a lot of time. Resulting from previous 
researches shows the need to motivate the teacher to 
supplement his/her duties with developing and monitoring 
the state of the repository. 
The second difficulty is the necessity to motivate the 
student to get highly involved in working independently 
during the education process, what guarantees obtaining a 
227

level of competence comparable to traditional education. 
Assessing knowledge on the basis of traditional tests in the 
distance learning mode loses its meaning as an instrument of 
motivation, as it deprived of all the consequences of direct 
contact with the teacher and other students (cognitive ones, 
emotional ones, etc.). A substitution way of rising the 
activity of the person learning something is a “game”, 
understood as an active cooperation, the result of which will 
be an object of interest for both the teacher and students 
(players). In the management sense, it means that the 
interests of each participant of the cooperation should be 
described as individual motivation functions that make up 
one goal function. 
The repository is the result of this cooperation, from the 
didactic point of view it is an open for everyone storage of 
didactic materials, including ontologies, tasks, example 
solutions, etc.; from the scientific point of view it is a 
copyrighted knowledge resource of a university; from the 
software-technical point of view it is an information system 
based on an appropriate network platform. 
III. 
MOTIVATION MODEL INTERPRETATION IN THE 
CONTEXT OF AN EDUCATION SITUATION 
A motif (the reason of action) is a consciously 
understood need for a certain object, position, situation, etc., 
therefore we can state that the motif comes from a 
requirement, becomes its current state and leads to certain 
actions [15]. During the realization of the mentioned chain 
“need – motif – action”, at each step we deal with a decision-
situation, meaning: many motifs can lead to a certain action, 
many needs can make up one motif, many motifs come out 
of one need. Making a choice is a cognitive process that 
cannot be observed directly [16]. This means that it is only 
possible to define the quantitative relationships between the 
choice parameters through exterior registration of the choice 
results. 
The motivation model can be developed in the form of a 
certain game scenario, where the activity of a teacher and a 
student will be supported by their own interests [17]. 
Developing the motivation model in a specific education 
situation (subject, goal and education level) is possible with 
the following assumptions: 
• 
The set of elements of the mentioned chain is 
defined and contains alternatives. 
• 
The choice is made in a specific education 
situation. 
• 
The result of a multiple choice made according to 
the chain is the obtained competence. 
• 
The result can be registered. 
• 
There is a system of assessing the choice results. 
• 
Students and teachers have access to observations 
and evaluations of the choices, which they made. 
• 
The result of a choice has to be evaluated by the 
student as a needed and wanted one (usability of 
the result). 
• 
The student has to be certain that the wanted result 
can be achieved in a given education situation, with 
probability higher than zero (subjective probability 
of achieving the result). 
 
Research’s discussion about motivation model can be 
addressed to different area of education system. The 
conducted analysis of information-processing in judgmental 
tasks allows to prepare cognitive-motivational model of 
decision's satisfaction [18]. In proposed model, confidence 
serves a role of a major contributing factor of the learning 
motivation. However, more details investigation proves that 
the motivation is a set of several components. The ARCS 
Motivation Model [19] is based on four-factor theory. The 
student’s motivation is hooked up with student’s attention, 
relevance, confidence and satisfaction. The ARCS model 
also contains strategies that can help an instructor stimulate 
or maintain each motivational element. Other researchers 
show that personally valued future goals are core for 
motivation [20]. Moreover the cultural discontinuities and 
limited opportunities in students’ learning environment may 
weak the motivational force in the future [21]. 
The form and content of motivation model is also strong 
depended on object to be motivated and environment, where 
motivational action takes place. On the one hand motivation 
model can be designed for artificial or human object. DeVoe 
and Iyengar [22] proposed a motivation model for virtual 
humans such as non-player characters. The motivation 
model based on overlapping hierarchical classified systems 
works to generate the coherent behavioural plans. On the 
another hand, different environment creates individual needs 
for motivation model. Such situation is caused mainly by 
multicultural differences [23].  
IV. 
STATING THE MOTIVATION PROBLEM IN A SPECIFIC 
ODL EDUCATION SITUATION  
In ODL conditions, as a motivation model we consider 
scenario of a game (interaction, interplay) between the 
teacher and the students, conducted in a specific education 
situation and oriented on performing the actions which allow 
to raise the level of student's involvement in subject-
specified task realization and extend the repository with new 
student's solutions (new tasks). 
The education process in every education situation 
includes the didactic, research and education aspects and 
takes place at the following levels: cognitive, information 
and computer-based. At each of these levels the teacher and 
the students have their own roles and involvement intensity. 
At the cognitive level assumptions are made and tasks are 
solved. At the information level the information is 
exchanged between the participants of the teaching/learning 
process. The computer-based level is characterized by 
repository organization and ability to use it. The role of the 
teacher is to develop an ontological model reflecting the 
subject of the education situation, showing the source of 
information, formulating tasks and presenting methods and 
228

examples of their solutions. All ontological models are 
stored in the repository.  
In the discussed approach tasks are created on the basis 
of the ontology and differ in their complexity level [14]. The 
proposed scenario assumes that the role of the student is to 
choose a task and solve it. The final grade depends on the 
correctness of the solution and the complexity level of the 
task. A task solved by a student and highly graded by the 
teacher is placed in the repository and will serve as an 
example solution for other students. All materials stored in 
the repository are copyrighted. This way the student 
participates in the didactic activity and we assume that it will 
raise his/her self-esteem, what has a positive influence on 
learning, meaning that it will be a part of the student’s 
motivation function. At the same time filling the repository 
with a wide spectrum of high quality solved tasks gives 
satisfaction to the teacher, for his/her laborious, requiring 
intelligent efforts of preparing the repository. And this will 
make up the teacher’s motivation function. 
Teacher’s and student’s interaction with the repository 
can have a research character. We assume that thematically 
the content of the repository is in concordance with the 
teacher’s 
scientific-research 
interests, 
what 
causes 
appearance and extension the repository with the tasks 
differing from the complexity level. For helping to solve 
tasks stored in the repository, the teacher will pay more 
attention and spend more time with the students. We can 
assume that for a certain part of students participation in 
common research is a challenge and the obtained results are 
an extra added value.   
The educational aspect is reflected in the repository 
development as a common success of all participants of the 
education process. Making the material copyrighted shows 
and visualizes the contribution and involvement of each 
participant. Feeling the synergy effect motivates to develop 
cooperation skills and tolerance. Cooperation in distance 
conditions requires a more logical formulation of questions 
and answers. All this reflects the interests of both the teacher 
and the students. 
Let us consider the basic components of the motivation 
model.

MOTIVATION MODEL IDENTIFICATION  IN THE GAMES 
THEORY TERMINOLOGY 
Interpretation and solution of the developed model can 
be conducted on the basis of the games theory, which allows 
to study the activity of a system depending on the players' 
behaviour.  
The way to involve students in active learning is to 
create a game situation, which is as follows. A distinctive 
feature of the ontology developed for educational purposes 
is that the ontology graph contains different types of subject 
knowledge: theoretical (what's this?) and the procedural 
(how to do this?). Theoretical vertices describe the 
semantics of the concepts and their relationships, and 
procedural 
ones 
- 
test tasks 
associated 
with 
the 
corresponding path in the graph. The project task to develop 
the domain ontology with both types of vertices can be 
represented as a game with total win and distribution points 
depending on the student's participation. 
Overall gain is considered as the number of both types 
vertices, added to the domain ontology graph, stored in the 
repository as a new didactic material. Teacher plays the role 
of the head of the game, students are combined into sub-
groups or can play individually. Motive of the teacher is to 
extend  and update the repository by the independent work 
of students. Motive of the student is to study the subject 
under teacher's supervision using live chat, competition 
recognition, stress reduction compared to traditional testing, 
increase the choice possibility, etc. The game can be carried 
out remotely [24]. Some students may choose the simplest 
tasks and the traditional way of its solution. Final 
assessment depends on the task complexity, participation in 
the project, the number of ECTS points. 
The proposed model refers to the class of non-
cooperative games with a defined number of steps and full 
information about participants activities in real-time. The 
game has an arbitrary sum of participants’ wins: the win of 
the teacher is accrual of knowledge in the repository, the 
win of the student depends on his/her strategy: maximal 
number of points for a task solved or minimal time loss. The 
equilibrium is obtained as a result of a dominant strategy, 
what compared to other strategies gives the game 
participants the possibility to obtain their maximal win 
regardless of actions of the other participants. 
Using game theory terminology the motivation model 
can be seen as a stimulation task, where motivation 
management signifies direct rewarding an agent (student) 
for his actions. The formulated model is consistent to a 
multi-agent two-layer stimulation system which consists of 
one centre (teacher) and n agents (students). The strategy of 
each agent is to choose an activity, the centre’s strategy – to 
choose a stimulation function, i.e., relationship between the 
win of each agent and his actions. 
Participants’ preferences are reflected by goal functions. 
The centre’s (teacher’s) goal function is the difference 
between his/her reward 
( W)
∆
 and the summary reward 
paid to the agents (sharing one’s own resources ( X )). By 
goal function of each agent, we understand the difference 
between the reward obtained from the centre and the losses 
connected to solving the task. At the moment of making the 
decision (stimulation function for the centre and choice 
function for the agent) the goal functions and acceptable 
actions of all participants are known. The centre has the 
right of the first move, when it chooses a stimulation 
function, before the agents, with known stimulation 
functions, choose activities that optimize their goal 
functions. The centre’s choice of a stimulation function 
takes place on the basis of a simulation meant to serve in 
foreseeing random characteristics of the basic students 
knowledge and parameters of the process of their arrival 
Agents choose their strategies independently and do not 
exchange information or wins, this signifies that we are 
dealing with a relational dominant strategy.

SIMULATION MODEL OF THE TEACHER AND THE 
STUDENT CO-OPERATION IN THE COMPETENCE ACQUIRING 
PROCESS  
Transferring of represented ontological/mathematical 
model to a simulation platform requires a set of actions. Key 
factor is defined as an elementary event at the input of the  
system. Moreover it’s necessary to define a kind of arrival 
pattern: deterministic or stochastic one and the rate of arrival.  
The goal of the simulation model and experiment is 
realization and analysis the didactical process oriented on 
acquiring competence. Simulation experiment deals with 
virtual  reality and transforms the real learning/teaching 
process. Using the charge of the resources and other output 
parameters it is possible to change model of co-operation 
between teacher and student and plan the competence 
development. General scheme of simulation model is shown 
on figure 1. Elements (events) of simulated process are 
incoming  students’ tasks and time of teacher’s consultation. 
Students arrive independently, sequentially and each event 
has to be served. 
 
 
Figure 1. General scheme of simulation model. 
 
On the base of outcome data teacher can change strategy 
of work with the students and modify motivation function, 
what means changing the complexity of the tasks setting up 
background of competence, e.g., to give more simple tasks, 
that in turn reduces the charge of the teacher and level of 
acquired competence. Simulation model provides also the 
estimation of various variants of teacher’s work in different 
constraints of the education situation (time, kind of students 
group, etc.). 
In conditions of the simulation experiment, the process of 
teacher and student co-operation can be interpreted as a 
queuing system with the following characteristics: 
• 
Teacher’s work relies on examination the students' 
task while the content and learning objects are 
known. 
• 
For a given course and a group of students teacher’s 
workplace can be defined as a server with known 
input, output and average time of service. 
• 
Average time of service depends on the teacher’s 
experience (specific character of course, task 
complexity, kind of student group, time of studies, 
etc.) and the results received from the linguistic 
database; its value is used in the motivation 
mechanism. 
• 
Workflow of students arrival is stochastic: it’s 
unknown number of arriving students, time of task 
evaluation, etc.. 
• 
Incoming tasks are served 
with 1 server, 
characterized by time and discipline of servicing. 
Interpreting the given problem in terms of queuing 
system provides possibility to use well known analytical 
result for certain class of QS (Queuing Systems) (e.g., 
M/M/1 for Kendall notation) [30]. 
Implementation the simulation approach can be realized 
in the Arena software, which in flexible way gives possibility 
to research parameters of the education situation: waiting 
queue, predictable time of servicing of all students, charge of 
the teacher in specified distribution law of the students' 
arrival, etc. 
Interpretation of the teaching/learning process oriented 
on acquiring competence in the terms of simulation 
modelling requires to define the components of this process, 
which impact its run (Figure 2).  These components permit to 
consider the teaching/learning process as a production one. It 
results in growth of competence represented by the new 
repository resources.

First component of the teaching/learning process is 
competence development plan directly involved with the 
repository's ontology and the gathered resources. It permits 
to specify the tasks assigned for the repository - number of 
these tasks and theirs complexity level. The determining of 
the motivation function follows the setting of numerical 
parameters value. Teacher’s motivation function depends on 
time of tasks control, number of task assigned for the 
repository and discipline of students' servicing. Meantime, 
determining the student’s motivation function which 
essentially impacts on the competence development plan is 
difficult problem. To solve this problem some probabilistic 
approach based on linguistic database can be proposed. It 
allows to define the cognitive potential of the group of 
student. Such database requires to specify and aggregate the 
features defining the student's motivation function.  
A set of features that allow for identification the 
student's motivation function is the following: 
1. Self-estimating (self-assessment) of knowledge 
perception capability. 
2. Estimating 
(assessment) 
of 
the 
teacher's 
requirements. 
3. Quality of delivered didactic materials. 
4. Interest of the subject content. 
5. Didactic material capacity and its curriculum. 
According to Goodhew [11], every feature sets 
numerical scale for linguistic quantifier. Distribution law of 
the linguistic quantifier for the feature ‘Quality of the 
didactic materials’ is represented in Figure 3.  
Realising at the next steps, partial aggregation of the 
features in accordance with the linguistic database model 
enables to define expected level of student motivation in the 
teaching/learning process (Figure 4).

the didactic materials'. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Model of linguistic database for student's motivation estimation 
[27]. 
 
Analysis of student's motivation on the base of the 
linguistic data/knowledge base defines cognitive potential of 
the students’ group and their interest in the repository 
development. The results of analysis can be used for 
evaluation the simulation model parameters: number of 
students with high, middle and low motivation, interests in 
the repository development, number of tasks for correction . 
The simulation model, represented in Figure 5, allows to 
verify  parameters of the teaching/learning process and to 
make some changes in teacher’s strategy with the group of 
students. It is based on assumption that "arriving" students 
must be served by the teacher. The result of this service is a 
new competence (with or without new resources in the 
repository) or (in otherwise) student must be declined for 
correction [12]. This approach allows to interpret the 
teacher’s work with students as queuing system, where: 
• 
For a given content of the didactic materials 
teacher’s work refers to checking the executed 
students’ tasks.  
• 
For a given subject and students' group teacher's 
workplace can be examined as a server with a 
given input, output and average service time. 
• 
Students arrival in the queuing system with the 
known parameters of stochastic workflow. 
• 
Average service time depends on teacher’s 
experience 
and 
results 
from 
the 
linguistic 
knowledge base analysis. 
Simulation experiment was realised in Arena software. 
Co-operation between the teacher and the students was 
analyzed taking into account the time the teacher has spent 
with the students in the certain level of the repository 
development.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
The motivation model has to be an obligatory element of 
an open and distance learning system. The proposed model 
constitutes the theoretical formalization of the new situation, 
when a teacher and the students are obligated to elaborate a 
didactic materials repository in accordance with the 
competence requirements. It covers two motivation 
functions: teacher’s and student’s, which describe their 
interests in the knowledge repository development. The 
proposed approach to the motivation provides not only the 
efficiency of teacher's work in ODL condition, but also the 
high quality didactic materials oriented on competence 
achievement. The measure of success in cooperation 
between the teacher and the students, according to the 
presented scenario, is the level of the repository content 
development in a given time.  
To analyze the constrains of this cooperation, it is 
proposed the simulation approach. The possibility of 
assessing the various variants of teacher’s work in different 
education situation by using the simulation models and 
simulation software lets to change this cooperation on the 
basis of empirical results.  
The interpretation the cooperation between the teacher 
and the students in a game theory causes, that the proposed 
motivation model can be solved on the basis of one of the 
known algorithms realizing a non-cooperative game with 
dominant strategy (RDS) [30].
