Abstract—Improving efﬁciency of upcoming vehicle communica-
tion networks is one of the main goals in near-future wireless
systems. In addition, multi-antenna conﬁgurations are known as
the main technique to improve the system performance with
current constrains, such as the limited spectrum. They are
an unlimited and non-lasting resource, but they imply a more
complex implementation. In this context, the design of this type of
geometries must be optimized considering the entire scenario and
the ﬁnal propagation conditions. Due to the relation between the
propagation environment and the correlation between elements,
the antenna inter-element spacing has to be adjusted to reach
the maximum performance at the minimum possible footprint
size. This work investigates the impact of correlation on channel
capacity and also proposes a proper separation of the elements
when they are mounted on a vehicle for two different urban
scenarios: communication between two vehicles (V2V) and car
connected to the cellular network (V2I).

INTRODUCTION
Vehicle communications have become a recurring topic
over the last years due to the increasing interest on creating
an efﬁcient and reliable network of connected cars, Vehicle
to Everything (V2X). The goal ranges from providing driving
aids to the user to self-driving cars. Then, energy efﬁciency
and low latency are two main factors to consider.
In the following work, the focus will be put on the car an-
tenna conﬁguration in order to improve the whole performance
of the system by means of numerical simulations for two main
situations: Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), in which two cars try
to communicate, and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), where a
Base Station (BS) is introduced. For both cases, Multiple Input
Multiple Output (MIMO) geometries will be compared with
respect to the Single Input Single Output (SISO) case, espe-
cially focusing on the impact of the inter-element spacing on
the system performance [1]. Conventional MIMO systems for
automotive applications are already detailed in [2]. Otherwise,
related work in [3] also analyzed the beamforming capabilities
of such structures using monopole arrays.
In particular, the study is based in the experimental val-
idation of the speciﬁed conﬁgurations in a simulated urban
environment, in which the cars and the BS will be placed to
emulate a realistic situation. A district of the city of Barcelona
has been chosen to provide an approach close to reality. The
operating frequency is located in the upper side of the S-band,
from 3.4 GHz to 3.8 GHz, with better propagation properties
as compared to higher bands, and which the automotive
industry has also become interested in [4].
Next sections are organized as follows: Section II intro-
duces some theoretical concepts that will be useful for the
following discussion, Section III describes the environment and
numerical tools, Section IV deﬁnes the methodology used to
evaluate the results, Section V presents the results for the V2I
simulations, whereas Section VI does the same for the case of
V2V, and, ﬁnally, Section VII summarizes the previous work
in some major statements deduced from the study.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
A. Capacity in MIMO Channels
One of the most used ﬁgures of merit at physical layer
in the analysis of communications systems is the channel
capacity. For a MxN MIMO system, being M the number of
transmitting units and N the receiving ones, capacity may be
obtained as [5]:
C = log2

det

IN + PT HH ∗
PN

,
(1)
where IN is the identity matrix, H is the channel matrix, whose
entries correspond to the addition of all multipaths between
each input and output port, PT is the transmission power and
PN, the noise level. The operator (.)* denotes the conjugate
transpose operator, i.e., Hermitian matrix.
∥H∥F =

N,M
X
i,j=1
|hij|2



HC = HH ∗
∥H∥2
F
(3)
Otherwise, we can express the same equation as a function
of the channel eigenvalues, λi(HC). In this case, the channel
matrix is normalized using the Frobenius norm, in (2), and the
eigenvalues are those corresponding to the product between
both H and its Hermitian, as in (3).

In (4), capacity is deﬁned by means of two main concepts in
multi-element cellular communications: the Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR) at the receiver, deﬁned as the ratio between

received power and noise level (SNRRX = PR/PN), and
the channel richness, determined by the number of relevant
eigenvalues. In this analysis, multi-user interference is not
considered, but it would affect the noise term (if it is assumed
uncorrelated with respect to desired signal), degrading the
system performance.
B. Correlation and Spatial Diversity
In a MIMO system, the distance between antennas has a
direct impact on the channel capacity through the correlation
between the antenna elements. This fading correlation was
researched by Shiu et al. [6]. The smaller the angle spread
becomes, the higher is the correlation and the lower the
responding channel capacity [5]. Therefore, a higher inter-
element spacing is needed for small angle spreads.
Figure 1 shows the correlation for three different kind
of possible arrival angles for two dipoles with varying inter-
element spacing. Furthermore, mutual coupling between the
antennas is another penalty on the channel capacity, which is
not studied in this work.
III.
SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT
The study of vehicle communications implies complex and
large environments, which require the support of numerical
tools to model the performance of the system in a realistic
situation. This section is dedicated to detail the elements
involved in the process of design and simulation of both the
scenario and the antennas. The latter is considered to be the
entire vehicle when mounted on the car due to its impact in
the ﬁeld distribution.
A. Software simulation
Initially, FEKO [8] is used to model the vehicle, as well as
the BS for the V2I case, together with the antenna structure.
It considers the effect of all the structure when calculating the
ﬁeld. The resulting radiation pattern is imported in a second
tool, WinProp [9], that is used to simulate the propagation
environment. It is possible to create the scenario for the case
of study, with a geometrical approximation of buildings, trees
and any other element and simulate using the ray tracing
method the interaction of all them when one or more radiators
are activated. In this case, a car (V2V) or a BS (V2I) are
used as transmitting elements and several points over a virtual

(V2V), transmitting BS (V2I) and trajectories used in the simulations.
trajectory are assumed to calculate the received ﬁelds. At the
receiving points, the effect of the car is considered, as the
radiation pattern calculation is including its structure. It is
important to mention that all receiving points assume a still
vehicle located on them, which is neglecting any Doppler
effect.
B. Scenario
The chosen scenario is an urban area with medium-height
buildings, some trees and streetlights. In particular, it is a
model of an intersection in a district of Barcelona called as
L’Eixample, which is known for its rectangular shape and
corners close to 90 deg. In Figure 2, the 3-D view of the
scenario is shown.
All buildings are made of concrete walls of 30 cm thickness
and 18 m height, some of them including a courtyard. The
ground is made of asphalt, streetlights are modelled as metallic
cylinders and trees include a solid wooden trunk and the top
is assumed to be a foliage semi-transparent to the rays (only
a certain attenuation applied as they pass through).
C. Vehicle conﬁguration
For the vehicle model, a prototype of a conventional car is
used. It includes two types of materials: metal for the body
and laminated glass for the windows. Wheels and internal
elements are excluded to simplify the design and to reduce
computational complexity and time consumption during the
simulations.
As shown in Figure 3a, the antenna is mounted on the
car rooftop. For V2V communications, both transmitter and
receiver will have the same height and, for the case of V2I, if
large distances are assumed, the angle of arrival is close to the
horizontal plane. In consequence, the ideal radiation pattern
should be maximum for angles close to the horizontal plane
and minimum in the vertical axis. Thus, the chosen antenna
is a monopole. In case of MIMO conﬁgurations, two or four
antennas are placed in a straight line, appropriated to ﬁt in a
shark-ﬁn footprint.

D. Base Station
It consists of a set of omnidirectional elements placed on
the top of a building as shown in Figure 2. The total height is
21 m over the ground, or 3 m over the rooftop. Depending on
the case, one, two, or four antennas are used (for SISO and
MIMO 2x2 or 4x4, respectively), with a constant spacing in
all cases.
IV.
METHODOLOGY
The ﬁgure of merit to estimate the system performance is
the average capacity for the set of points used in each speciﬁc
path. For each one, the capacity is calculated using (4), once
the channel matrix is obtained by the numerical simulation.
The noise level is not ﬁxed in the calculation, but a mean SNR
is assumed for the overall trajectory. Its value is set to 10 dB. In
addition, in order to determine the achievable performance and
validate the results, a theoretical maximum is calculated with
ideal channel eigenvalues, i.e., σi = 0.5 (i=1,2) for MIMO
2x2 and σj = 0.25 (j=1,2,3,4), for MIMO 4x4.
The spacing between the antenna elements (monopoles)
on top of the car is chosen to be in the range of 0.1 to
4 times the wavelength, in steps of 0.1λ. For each one, the
average capacity over a given trajectory is calculated and then
compared with respect to the SISO case.
V.
IMPACT OF THE INTER-ELEMENT SPACING
IN V2I MIMO COMMUNICATIONS
In this section, the performance in terms of capacity is
studied for MIMO V2I systems. The analysis distinguishes
between two different situations: Line of Sight (LOS) and Non
Line of Sight (NLOS). In the ﬁrst case, the BS is placed at the
edge of the building, whereas, in the latter, the direct view is
blocked by placing it some meters backwards (see Figure 2).

V2I channel capacity for different inter-element spacing for MIMO
2x2 and MIMO 4x4 with respect to the SISO channel capacity in percent and
a ﬁxed SNR of 10 dB.
Figure 4 shows the average channel capacity obtained for
distinct inter-element spacing with respect to the SISO case in
percentage. It illustrates the MIMO 2x2 case (upper ﬁgure) for
the LOS in blue, the NLOS in red and the theoretical maximum
in black. The same illustration is shown in the lower ﬁgure for
MIMO 4x4.
First, if MIMO 2x2 is analyzed, it is observed a the-
oretical maximum channel capacity 149% respect to SISO.
The minimum for LOS case is 129 % and, in NLOS, it is
135%, both obtained with an inter-element spacing of 0.1
wavelength. The maximum with 147% for NLOS is achieved
with a spacing of 3.4 λ and is almost reaching the theoretical
maximum of 149%. In the case of LOS, the maximum of
139% although the channel capacity is almost ﬂat after inter-
element distances of 1.9λ. The evolution for NLOS is expected
as in the theoretical graph (see Figure 1). Regarding MIMO
4x4, the theoretical maximum channel capacity is now 209%.
The lowest channel capacity is again obtained for both LOS
and NLOS when inter-element spacing is 0.1 wavelengths
(164% and 175%, respectively). On the other hand, the greatest
capacity is achieved at the spacing of 2.8λ, with 188%, for
LOS and 3.9λ, and 198% for NLOS.
From the previous results, it is deduced that MIMO 2x2
is almost reaching the theoretical maximum for NLOS com-
munication, whereas MIMO 4x4 has a bigger step until its
maximum. It can be determined that the channel is not rich
enough, even increasing the inter-element spacing. Otherwise,
it is also true that MIMO 4x4 provides a larger improvement
with respect to SISO in terms of capacity although the channel
rank is low.
Additionally, in MIMO 4x4 case, there is a more signiﬁcant
increment when the spacing is increased if the values are
compared from the lowest distances to the largest. As stated in
[10], “the speciﬁc behavior is also depending on the amount of
elements in the car, which seems to indicate that higher is the
number of elements, higher may be the necessary inter-element
distance to obtain the optimal performance.”

IMPACT OF INTER-ELEMENT SPACING
IN V2V MIMO COMMUNICATIONS
The goal now is to analyze the communication between
two equal vehicles (V2V). This situation has some major
differences as compared to previous case: both transmitter and
receiver have the same height, their spacing is modiﬁed at the
same time and both use monopole antennas.
The transmitting vehicle is ﬁxed in a still position. Other-
wise, two trajectories are considered for the receiver: one in
LOS in which the car is driving along the same path as the
transmitter and another in NLOS behind the building close to
the corner (Figure 2).
Figure 5 compares both situations when MIMO 2x2 or 4x4
are used. In contrast with V2I model, the increment in capacity
is much more evident for NLOS. It is necessary to remind at
this point that the SNR is ﬁxed to 10 dB and the performance
is only affected by the eigenvalues distribution. Then, we can
deduce that the rank of the channel matrix is clearly increasing
when there is no direct path.
In NLOS, the average capacity is very similar to previous
case. There is a maximum of 123% at 3.3λ for MIMO
2x2 and 194% at 3.4λ for MIMO 4x4. In any case, the
oscillation is considerably stable above 2λ. Otherwise, for the
LOS situation, capacity is much more reduced. This behavior
indicates a very strong path, corresponding to the direct view,
and low power reﬂections. Now, the behavior is almost stable
after 0.5λ and maximum values are 132% and 168% for
MIMO 2x2 and 4x4, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
Based on the realistic numerical modeling of a V2X urban
environment, two main conclusions may be extracted. In terms
of antenna footprint, it has been shown that higher the order of
the MIMO system, larger has to be the inter-element distance
to obtain optimal performance. Furthermore, the increment of
the distance improves capacity in both LOS and NLOS for
V2I; whereas, for V2V, a signiﬁcant improvement is only
obtained in NLOS.
