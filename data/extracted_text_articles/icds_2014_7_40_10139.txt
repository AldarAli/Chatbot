Abstract—Twitter, a microblogging service launched in October
2006, has become one of the most popular social communication
media. Because Twitter’s characteristics are immediacy, ease of
use, and bi-directionality, its timeline reﬂects the real world
almost instantly. Once a major event happens, the number of
tweets increases rapidly. In this article, this phenomenon is
deﬁned as a burst. The authors gathered Japanese tweets on a
public timeline from Twitter API over a period of ﬁfteen months
starting from November, 2011, to February, 2013. We collected
over 5 billion posts created by about 11 million users. Results of
our analysises show that during the bursts, the total number of
tweets showed a higher percentage of retweets, fewer replies, and
fewer characters used per post than those during normal status.
Cluster analysis revealed ﬁve types of bursts. Furthermore, we
clariﬁed that the scale of earthquakes in Japan and the distance
from the quakes’ epicenters to Tokyo signiﬁcantly affected the
occurrence of bursts on Twitter.

INTRODUCTION
In our increasingly technological world, people commonly
and regularly use online social networking service to connect,
communicate, and obtain information. As one of the most
popular social networking and microblogging tools, Twitter
enables users to send and read text messages, called tweets, of
up to 140 characters via computers or mobile phones. Since
its launch in 2006, Twitter has rapidly increased in terms of
the number of users. In December 2012, Twitter Inc. reported
having more than 200 million active users creating more than
400 million tweets daily [1]. In Japan, Twitter is more popular
than any other social networking tool, for instance, mixi,
Facebook, Linkedln, and Google+ [2]. The number of Twitter
users in Japan is the third largest in the world, after the United
States and Brazil. To put this status into perspective, Japan’s
population in 2011 was approximately 127.8 million; Brazil
196.7 million; United States 311.6 million [3]. Twitter has been
widely regarded as an effective emergency communication
tool, and after the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011,
its users increased exponentially.
　 Twitter’s technological characteristics―bi-directionality,
immediacy, and ease of use―practically ensure increase in
the number of tweets during or just after an event occurs. For
example, in the popular animated television ﬁlm Castle in the
Sky Laputa, the word balse is spoken to cast a magic spell
that devastates Laputa, the ﬁlm’s eponymous ﬂying castle. On
August 2, 2013, as“ Balse! ”was spoken on the ﬁlm, a high
number of Japanese users simultaneously tweeted“ Balse! ”.
In fact, Twitter Inc. reported that the world record of tweets
per second (TPS) was broken with 143,199 TPS. We deﬁne
this phenomenon as a“burst,”and this study aims to examine
and classify such bursts.
　 We examined the burst phenomenon through quantitative
analysis, with the goal of answering the following three ques-
tions: (1) Why do bursts occur? (2) What are the characteristic
features of tweets in burst status? (3) How is each burst
classiﬁed? To accomplish our goal, we crawled 5,285,607,227
tweets for a span of 15 months, from November 16, 2011, to
February 15, 2013.
　 Our report of the results is organized as follows: Next sec-
tion relates our research to the perspectives of similar research.
Section III describes our data crawling methodology and our
burst detection method. In Section IV, we apply the results
of our analysis by examining tweets’ characteristic features
during burst status, comparing them with tweets during normal
status (IV. A). After clarifying the characteristic features, we
classify each burst (IV. B). Then, we verify factors affecting the
earthquake burst (IV. C). Finally, in Section V, we summarize
our ﬁndings and indicate future challenges.

RELATED WORK
With such widespread use of tweeting, studies have al-
ready been conducted to clarify exactly what Twitter is and
how people use it. As pioneering researchers, Java et al. [4]
collected tweets on a public timeline for 2 months, from April
1 to May 30, 2007, gathering 1,348,543 tweets posted by
76,177 unique users. Through this data, they examined the
users’ motivations for posting and the structures of Twitter.
Java et al. clariﬁed that the diameter of the network graph
based on the follow relationship was 6. They also reported
that 20% of all tweets were conversational with @, and 13%
contained a URL sent to share information. Krishnamurthy
et al. [5] crawled not only a public timeline but also user
proﬁles and their tweets. They collected these data using two
algorithms and performed an analysis similar to that of Java
et al., describing the differences between data sets. In another
182

study, Poblete [6] collected 5,270,609,213 tweets by 4,736,629
users from 246 countries to reveal national differences in the
Twitter network.
　 Numerous studies have examined Twitter from the view-
point of information propagation and relationships between
users. From June 6 to June 31, 2009, Kwak et al. [7] extracted
1.47 billion follow-follower relationships and 41.7 million
user proﬁles. These researchers’ results showed that 77.9%
of follow-follower networks were one-way but that mutual
follows accounted for only 22.1%. These features are unique
to Twitter among social networking services. They suggest
that Twitter’s technological characteristics make it a stronger
source for communicating and disseminating or obtaining
information.
　 Many further studies of Twitter have related it to the real
world. On one hand, some studies have attempted to relate
tweets to later events, in other words, to predict the future
through Twitter. Bollen [8] tried to predict stock prices; Asur
[9] tried to predict movies’ box ofﬁce sales; and Tumasjan [10]
tried to predict election results. On the other hand, some studies
attempted to detect the actual condition of the world. From
August to October 2009, Sakaki et al. [11] gathered tweet data
that was used to detect earthquakes with a high probability:
96% of seismic intensity 3 earthquakes and 100% of more
intense earthquakes were detected. Diao et al. [12] detected
trends in event according to burst words in tweets. From
September 1 to November 30, 2011, these researchers col-
lected 3,967,927 tweets from users in Singapore. Using latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and two LDA improved algorithms
(UserLDA, TimeLDA), they conducted automatic detection
of topics from extracted words. Results showed that, using
improved algorithms, their method can detect unique topics
more precisely than conventional methods. Shirakihara et al.
[13] obtained buzzwords from buzztter.com/. Then, using the
algorithm proposed by Kleinberg, these researchers detected
the time zone in which tweets including certain buzzwords
increased rapidly.
　 In brief, most Twitter studies have focused on event de-
tection in the real world rather than on users’ information-
gathering behavior and features of tweets. By focusing on
the number of tweets as they increase through a certain time
span, our study proposes to clarify why and how people tweet.
Thus, we discuss the relationship between the real world and
Twitter. In a research focused on the number of tweets, Inui
[14] analyzed 179,286,297 tweets posted around the Great East
Japan Earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011, revealing
that the tweets per minute (TPM) peaked in the week after
the earthquake. The highest number of tweets was recorded
on March 15, 2011, when the seismic intensity 6 earthquake
occurred in Shizuoka Prefecture. The second highest number
was recorded just after another earthquake that occurred on
Sanriku coast.

METHOD
To analyze burst status, we must crawl tweet data and then
set a threshold value for a burst. After detecting bursts, we
analyze them. In Section III-A, we explain how we crawled
tweet data and how we set the threshold value.
　 However, we ﬁrst provide some explanation of how tweets
work. To post a tweet to a particular user, one begins with
“@username,” and the tweet appears in the timeline of a

recipient user or a user who follows both sender and recipient.
This type constitutes about 40% of all tweets. The reply
function, of course, makes a tweet go to a particular user-in
this case, the sender of the tweet replied to. A“retweet”or a
re-posting of someone else’s tweet empowers a tweet receiver
to spread information beyond the original tweet’s followers.
The retweet function is symbolized in a re-sent message by
“RT@username.” The rate of a retweet is a percentage of the
text beginning with RT over the total number of texts; this
type of retweet does not include a retweet with another user’s
comment, which is called the “classic retweet.” Similarly, this
type does not include tweets beginning with QT.
A. Data Collection
From November 16, 2011, to February 15, 2013, we col-
lected public timeline tweets from Japan, written in Japanese,
using Twitter Search API. We set the parameter language
for ‘ja’ (Japanese) and the geocode for a 2,000-km radius
from Akashi-city, Hyogo, in order to cover only Japan. We
collected 5,285,607,227 tweets posted by 10,918,410 unique
users. Each tweet has its own identity (ID), the user’s ID, the
exact time of posting, the tweet’s actual text, and so on. Table
I displays fundamental statistics on the collected data. Of the
5,285,607,227 tweets harvested, 8.82% were retweets. The rate
of reply was 39.02%. The mean for characters was 45.75, and
the mode, the value that appears most often, for characters was
21.
B. Setting Threshold Value
For analysis of the phenomenon under consideration here,
a sudden, large increase in tweets beyond the normal trafﬁc
is considered a “burst.” For macroscopic analysis, of course,
we must establish a quantitative burst threshold, a set value.
We check the threshold every minute, and when the number
of tweets rises above the threshold value, we judge that time
to signal a burst. Figure 1 indicates average number of tweets
according to day and time. In Figure 1, the average number
of tweets at 4:00 is below 2,000 tweets par minute, and at
23:00, the average is more than 140,000 tweets par minute.
This information suggested that we should not set the same
threshold throughout the day, and thus, we decided to set the
threshold by the minute-as Figure 1 illustrates. As indicated
in Figure 1, the number of tweets also differs on weekdays
and holidays. Holidays are weekends, and national holidays.
On a usual weekday, Twitter trafﬁc increases around 8 a.m.
and around noon, indicating use after awakening, during the
morning commute, and during lunch breaks. On holidays,
however, tweeting steadily increases into the night hours. For
these reasons, we set different thresholds for both the day and
the time.
　 As Table II shows, the average number of tweets and unique
users is increasing. If we applied the same threshold to all the

data, it would be difﬁcult to detect earlier bursts and easy
to detect recent ones. Thus, we also set different thresholds
for each month. To calculate the threshold value for a certain
month, we used a dataset that included the month previous
and the month after that under consideration. For instance,
to calculate the threshold from March l6 to April 14, 2012,
we used the dataset from February 14 to May 15, 2012. We
detected bursts from December 16, 2011, to January 15, 2013,
using data from November 16, 2011, to February 15, 2013. The
threshold values for bursts were calculated using the following
formula:
Nnt(t) = N(t) + 3σ(t)
(1)
where Nnt(t) represents the threshold value of a burst at a
certain time(t), N(t) is average of the number of tweets per
day at a certain time(t), and σ(t) is the standard deviation
at a certain time(t). For calculating the threshold value, two
extreme values of tweet numbers for each time were removed
from the dataset.
　 Based on this method, we detected 5,326 bursts from holi-
day dataset and 5,650 burst from weekday dataset. We detected
burst events by checking tweet texts and times. Some bursts
have relevance to television programs, for example, Lupin III:
The Castle of Cagliostro, Smile PreCure!, and Tetsuko’s Room,
and bursts were caused by televised sports events as well.
Justin Bieber’s appearance on a Japanese television program
caused a burst. In addition, a burst occurred 3 minutes after
television news announced the arrest of Takahashi, the last
Aum fugitive from the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway
in 1995. All these examples suggest a strong association
between bursts and television broadcasting. Moreover, bursts
are relevant to other media; for example, Animation Song-
Zanmai Z is a radio program that has caused bursts. In addition,
Twitter has bursts unique to itself, such as “Twitter’s server
down!”
　 Furthermore, bursts have relevance to natural disasters, e.g.,
earthquakes, “bomb cyclones,” tornadoes, heavy snow, and
heavy rain. People experiencing a disaster post their situations
on Twitter, and others use Twitter to disseminate information
about the disaster.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Features of Posting during Burst Status
To clarify features of posting during bursts, we compared
features of text during normal status and burst status. Table
III represents the average number of characters, the rate of
retweets compared to all tweets, and the rate of reply to all
tweets during burst status, nonburst status, and all statuses,
respectively.

In burst status overall, the average number of characters
is fewer than that in normal status because users attempt
to tweet as quickly as possible. Because time is of the
essence, users make their posts short. In fact, during bursts
caused by earthquakes, users posted very short texts in two
or three Japanese characters, such as “Oh no!”, “Earthquake,”
or “Shaking!” In burst status also, the retweet rates are higher
than those in nonburst status, and the rate of reply in burst
status is lower than that in nonburst status. Users try to spread
information about burst events to many people, and thus, the
retweet rates become higher. In burst status, people like to
use Twitter’s functions to diffuse rather than limit information.
For example, during a burst on March 14, 2012, 20.9% of all
tweets were retweets. On that date, an earthquake occurred, and
users posted retweets of information about the disaster tweeted
from a public ofﬁce account: RT@zishin3255 2 Earthquake
Early Warning (no.12) There was an earthquake in Sanriku
offshore, 3 on the Japanese scale. [Detail] The 9.0 magnitude
earthquake occurred at 18:08:29 on 14th March 2012, depth
of 10 km. It will reach Tokyo at 18:11:26 [about 177 seconds
later]. #EarthquakeEarlyWarning and RT@NHK PR: There is
a tsunami advisory for Iwate Prefecture and the Paciﬁc Ocean
coast in Aomori Prefecture. The Earthquake Early Warnings
are issued mainly by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA),
and NHK is Japan’s national public broadcasting organization.
Kwak [7] observed that Twitter is more a source of information
than a social networking site, and our results conﬁrm that,
particularly during bursts, people tend to use Twitter as a
source of information.
B. Classiﬁcations of Bursts
In the previous section, we explained that during bursts,
tweets tended to be retweeted, less replies were received,
and less characters than usual were contained. However, we
184

FIGURE 2. EARTHQUAKE BURST
FIGURE 3. ANNULAR ECLIPSE BURST
also framed the hypothesis that different events may cause
different posting features. Hence, we tried to classify each
burst according to its features, that is, the average number of
characters, rates of retweets, and rates of replies. In addition,
we found that the shape of a burst can indicate the type of
event.
　 Figures 2-5 indicate the changing number of tweets ac-
cording to event. For instance, Figure 2 shows the number
of tweets increasing rapidly after an earthquake and then
decreasing rapidly. In other words, an unpredictable event,
such as an earthquake, causes an increase and then a decrease
in the number of tweets within a short time span. Figure 3
illustrates the process of tweet numbers on May 21, 2012,
the day an annular eclipse occurred. In this case, users knew
when the eclipse would occur, and thus, the number of tweets
increased and decreased moderately before and after the event.
On June 12, 2012, the F´ed´eration Internationale de Football
Association (FIFA) World Cup qualiﬁer with Japan versus
Australia was played. As shown in Figure 4, a little before
the game began at 19:00 and a little after the game ended at
20:50, the number of tweets was higher than usual, increasing
particularly when goals were scored and when the game ended.
Figure 5 illustrates tweet numbers on the day a bomb cyclone
hit Japan. Different from other ﬁgures, span of increasing
tweets was very long, although the distance to average was
not so long. These examples, illustrated in the ﬁgures, show
that Twitter users’ reactions to various events can change the
bursts’ shapes.
　 We further framed the hypothesis that a burst’s features
FIGURE 4. FOOTBALL (AUSTRALIA VS. JAPAN) BURST
FIGURE 5. BOMB CYCLONE BURST
reﬂect the event’s nature. We classiﬁed the bursts and then
detected the nature of events in each cluster. Each burst
has data about shape, that is, (1) length of burst status and
(2) distance to threshold. The length of burst status is the
total time between the number of tweets above and below
the threshold value. If the number of tweets goes above the
threshold value at one measurement and then falls below the
threshold value at the next measurement, the length of the burst
is 1 min. In addition, each burst contains data regarding text
features, that is, (3) average number of characters, (4) rates
of retweets, and (5) rates of replies. Thus, using these ﬁve
factors, we classiﬁed each burst through cluster analysis using
Ward’s method and the Euclidean distance of R2.15.1. Before
clustering, we normalized all the data. Table IV shows the
average of each feature in each cluster.

　 Of the ﬁve clusters, the ﬁrst has the shortest burst status
and the shortest distance to threshold. Thus, the third cluster
contains small bursts caused, in this case, by a seismic intensity
1 earthquake and unexpected strong rain. Both these events
affected relatively few people in a small area. The third cluster
was composed of such small bursts.

　 The second cluster reveals the peak of a big event, with
both the longest distance to threshold and greatest length of
burst status. Cluster ﬁve bursts are typiﬁed by participation of
many people, such as celebrating the New Year or observing
the annular eclipse.
　 The third cluster contains bursts previous to peaking. In this
cluster, the distance to threshold is longer than that in the ﬁrst
cluster and shorter than that in the second cluster. Similarly,
the length of burst status is longer than that in the ﬁrst cluster
and shorter than that in the second cluster. The beginning of
the annular eclipse burst, the death of Kim Jong-il, and the
televised Japanese animation My Neighbor Totoro were all in
the ﬁrst cluster. Thus, we concluded that this cluster is a type
of burst in process.
　 The fourth cluster has a long threshold distance, although
the burst length is comparatively short. Thus, this cluster
contains a type of sudden, unpredictable event, for example,
Olympic game victories, a goal at the FIFA World Cup, and
earthquakes.
　 The ﬁfth cluster is characterized by high rates of retweeting,
and thus, we deﬁne this cluster as a type of information
diffusion. Along with the many retweets, the number of
characters is also the greatest, presumably to provide sufﬁcient
information. In this cluster, the bursts contained, for example,
the news of a phantom killer in Shibuya and the arrest of the
Aum suspect Takahashi.
　 To sum up, we classiﬁed bursts into ﬁve types: (1) small
burst, (2) burst in process, (3) peak burst, (4) sudden burst,
and (5) information diffusion burst.
C. Factors Affecting Earthquake Burst
Twitter’s nature is one of immediacy and brevity. Users can
post only 140 characters, and tweets appear on the timeline as
soon as the user posts. When a disaster hits, then, Twitter can
transfer information more expeditiously than other media. In
this section, we discuss factors affecting earthquake bursts.
Clarifying the relevance between disasters and Twitter can
help provide the most rapid dissemination of information about
the event. Some have studied using Twitter for the immediate
spread of disaster information; for instance, Sakaki et al [11]
detected disaster situations using locator information and tweet
texts. However, no studies have clariﬁed the relevance between
disasters and bursts.
　Throughout this investigation, bursts occurred many times in
disaster situations, such as typhoons, heavy rains, earthquakes,
and so on. In particular, earthquakes caused burst status 106
times. Therefore, we examined factors affecting earthquake
bursts, and one factor is the earthquake’s scale. Most earth-
quake tweets are posted when the user feels the shock of
the quake. The higher the quake is on the scale, the more
people notice it. Besides scale, the distance between urban
centers and the earthquake may be relevant to bursts since the
number of tweets increases along with the population density
and numbers of Twitter users in the urban centers.
　 In Japan, earthquakes are assigned levels on a scale from
0 to 7, with 7 being the strongest, and we used the same
scale in this study. Figure 6 shows changes in the number
of tweets when earthquakes are registered in the upper 5
levels on the intensity scale. The ﬁgure contains the date
of each earthquake, the name of the prefecture that recorded
the maximum seismic intensity, and the distance from Tokyo.

FIGURE 6. CHANGING TWEET NUMBERS IN ABOVE 5 SEIS-
MIC INTENSITY EARTHQUAKES
This information reveals that earthquakes of the same seismic
intensity do not cause the same number of tweets. The number
of tweets on the March 14 is greater than that on other days.
This is because of the quake’s distance from the urban center.
Ibaraki Prefecture is about 90 km from Tokyo, and the other
prefectures are more than 100 km away. Similarly, the number
of tweets after an intensity 4 quake in Aomori (May 24, 2012)
was fewer than those after a less intense quake in Chiba (May
29, 2012). Now, Aomori Prefecture is about 577 km from
Tokyo, but Chiba Prefecture is only about 40 km from Tokyo.
　 Therefore, we decided that the representative location of an
urban center would be the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,
with the closest seismograph station located at Kabukicho
Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo. During the investigation, this seismograph
station registered 50 earthquakes: 36 of intensity 1; 11 of
intensity 2; and 3 of intensity 3. We detected bursts 46 times
―a 92% rate of detection. These results indicate that bursts
occur with high probability if the urban center experiences an
earthquake.
　 On this basis, we adopted the hypothesis that an earthquake
burst has relevance both to the scale of an earthquake and the
distance from the urban center. Throughout this investigation,
earthquakes of seismic intensity 3 or more occurred 341
times. We collected data for each earthquake: (1) time of
occurrence, (2) epicenter, (3) maximum seismic intensity, (4)
municipality recording maximum seismic intensity, and (5)
distance between the urban center and the municipality. We
used the earthquake database provided by the Japan Weather
Association in order to collect time of occurrence, epicenter,
maximum seismic intensity, and municipality that recorded
maximum seismic intensity. For this study, we decided that
the representative location of the urban center would be the
Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The distance between the
municipality and urban center was measured as the distance
between the municipality’s town hall and the Tokyo Metropoli-
tan Government. We calculated the distance using Google
Maps API. When more than one municipality recorded the
same maximum seismic intensity, we chose the municipality
closest to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and calculated
the distance. If the Twitter burst occurred within 3 min after
the earthquake, we decided the earthquake caused the burst.
However, if the burst occurred before the earthquake, we
removed the earthquake data from our dataset. Earthquakes
over seismic intensity 3 occurred 341 times. Within 3 min after
earthquakes, 127 bursts occurred, but 11 of them had attained
burst status before the earthquake occurred. Excluding those
186

11 earthquakes, we then calculated a rate of burst detection
using 328 earthquakes and 106 bursts (Table V).

When the earthquakes registered seismic intensity 3, the
more the proximity to the urban center, the higher was the
rate of burst detection. This suggests relevance between the
distance from the urban center and the burst. When earthquakes
registered a seismic intensity of 5 or more, the rate of burst
detection is very high, regardless of the distance from the urban
center. This suggests relevance between an earthquake’s scale
and its resultant burst.
　 We performed logistic regression analysis to conﬁrm these
results. We used “burst or no burst” as the dependent variable,
and “scale of the earthquake” and “inverse of distance from
urban center” as independent variables. Tables VI reveal the
results of logistic regression analysis using R2.15.1. McFad-
den’s ρ is 0.26, Cox-Snell’s R2 is 0.366, and Negelkerle’s R2
is 0.488. Identiﬁcation rate based on the regression equation
is 80.5%.

For each independent variable, a p value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. The correlation coefﬁcient
between each independent variable was below 0.1. Evidence
for multicollinearity was absent because the variance inﬂation
factor for independent variables in models was less than 2.0.
The results suggest that the scale of the earthquake and the
distance from the urban center are affecting earthquake bursts.
In particular, the value of Wald suggests that the distance from
the urban center more strongly inﬂuences a burst than the scale
of the earthquake.

CONCLUSION
This study aimed to explore the media character of Twitter
by focusing on the burst phenomenon. We clariﬁed that burst
tweets are more likely to be retweets, receive less replies, and
contain fewer characters than usual. In burst status, in fact,
Twitter becomes more a source of information than a social
site. In addition, we classiﬁed each burst and clustered burst
events into groups. According to certain features, we were able
to classify ﬁve types of bursts (1) small burst, (2) burst in
process, (3) peak burst, (4) sudden burst, and (5) information
diffusion burst. Finally, we veriﬁed factors affecting earthquake
bursts, namely, that the scale of earthquakes and the distance
from an urban center affect earthquake bursts, with the latter
having a stronger inﬂuence than the former.
　 In future research, we plan to focus more on individual
users. To further clarify factors affecting earthquake bursts,
we should separately consider two groups of users, those who
tweet after perceiving the quake themselves and those who
tweet after receiving news of an earthquake. To do so, we must
more ﬁnely gather geocode and time-of-posting data. We will
classify users according to network and proﬁle data and then
compare burst status between the two groups. For even ﬁner
research on this data, we should detect burst events through
natural language analysis.
