INTRODUCTION
The goal of this research is the creation of a practi-
cal Holocene-prehistoric inventory of worldwide volcanologi-
cal features groups, integrating arbitrary coherent conceptual
knowledge. The target is a sustainable multi-disciplinary in-
tegration of knowledge contexts, especially from prehistory
and archaeology, which further enables a coherent concep-
tual knowledge contextualisation and georeferenced symbolic
representation. The approach conforms with information sci-
ence fundaments and universal knowledge, which enable an
integration of the required components from methodologies
to realisations for knowledge representations of realia and ab-
stract contexts [1], considering that many facets of knowledge,
including prehistory, need to be continuously acquired and
reviewed [2]. Creating contextualisation requires to coherently
integrate multi-disciplinary knowledge and to enable symbolic
representations, e.g., integrating chorological and chronolog-
ical contexts. Realisations need to integrate a wide range of
components as required from participating disciplines, e.g., for
dynamical processing, geoprocessing, spatial contextualisation.
Implementation and realisation based on the methodology of
coherent conceptual knowledge contextualisation requires the
integration of standardised, modular components required for
task within participating disciplines. This research employs
knowledge resources, data sources, and Points of Interest
(PoI), especially Knowledge Resources (KR) focussing on
volcanological features, prehistory, and archaeology.
Therefore, two major reference implementations were de-
ployed for implementation, realisation, and continuous further
development. The coherent knowledge resources and the prac-
tical realisation are fully based on the main implementations
of the prehistory-protohistory and archaeology Conceptual
Knowledge Reference Implementation (CKRI) [3] and the
Component Reference Implementations (CRI) framework [4].
CKRI provides the knowledge framework, including multi-
disciplinary contexts of natural sciences and humanities [5].
CRI provides the required component groups and components
for the implementation and realisation of all the procedural
modules. The component and workﬂow procedure related
research for this inventory is in focus of multi-disciplinary
research groups and matter to be reported in separate publi-
cations. Many aspects of knowledge [6], including meaning,
can be described using knowledge complements supporting a
modern deﬁnition of knowledge [7] and subsequent component
instrumentation, e.g., considering factual, conceptual, proce-
dural, metacognitive, and structural knowledge. Knowledge
complements are a means of understanding and targeting new
insight, e.g., enabling advanced contextualisation, integration,
analysis, synthesis, innovation, prospection, and documenta-
tion. Regarding knowledge, it should be taken for granted, that
scientiﬁc members of any disciplines nowerdays continuously
practice and train themselves in development and practical
employment of methods, algorithms, and components as re-
quired by their disciplines and keep track with how to inte-
grate methods. The reference implementations are part of the
developments and provide sustainable, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient
fundaments for solutions targeting the creation of coherent
multi-disciplinary conceptual knowledge contextualisation.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II
presents the methodological implementation and realisation
with the CKRI references and the respective component in-
tegration for this research. Section III shows the resulting
inventory, the knowledge integration results, and excerpts of
the created volcanological features groups of the inventory.
Section IV provides a compact discussion of the results regard-
ing the coherent conceptual knowledge integration. Section V
summarises lessons learned, conclusions, and future work.
II.
METHODOLOGICAL IMPLEMENTATION AND
REALISATION
Implementation and realisation are based on the CKRI
reference implementation [3], and respective contextualisation.
Components outside the core scope of this knowledge fo-
cussed geoscientiﬁc, prehistoric, and archaeological research
are employed and can be extended via the CRI frame reference
implementations [4]. Both provide sustainable fundaments for
highest levels of reproducibility and standardisation.

The CKRI implementations provide the fundament for the
coherent multi-disciplinary knowledge based integration and
the realisations of the methodological component integration.
B. Resulting methodological component integration
Integration components, reﬂecting standards and sustainable
modules are based on the major groups of the Component Ref-
erence Implementations (CRI) frame [4]. The CRI framework
is provided in development stage edition E.0.3.7. The ten major
CRI component groups were integrated for the implementation
and realisation of the practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory
of volcanological features groups, especially:
1)
Conceptual knowledge frameworks.
2)
Conceptual knowledge base.
3)
Integration of scientiﬁc reference frameworks.
4)
Formalisation.
5)
Methodologies and workﬂows integration.
6)
Prehistory Knowledge Resources.
7)
Natural Sciences Knowledge Resources.
8)
Inherent representation groups.
9)
Scientiﬁc context parametrisation.
10)
Structures and symbolic representation.
Focus is on the contextualisation and conceptual knowledge
framework, its development, and its ﬂexibility of integration
with advanced components. Relevant pre-existing and ongoing
component developments addressing knowledge with multi-
disciplinary KR have been summarised [10]. Integration of
components and procedural realisations are out of scope here
but subject of research in respective ﬁelds. Procedural realisa-
tions will therefore be published separately.
The exact components for the implementation and reali-
sation of the practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory of vol-
canological features groups are given in the next sections.
III.
RESULTING INVENTORY
The following sections provide illustrative object entity
examples of the new practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory
of volcanological features groups as implemented and realised
integrating the aforementioned reference implementations.
A. Resulting coherent conceptual knowledge integration
Table III shows an excerpt of the result matrix of Holocene-
prehistoric volcanological features groups. The result matrix
includes conceptual knowledge view groups [11] based on
CKRI references [3], factual knowledge from the Knowledge
Resources objects, and respective country codes.
The coherent conceptual knowledge integration enables
a multi-disciplinary conceptual knowledge integration. This
case demonstrates an integration of Holocene-prehistoric vol-
canological features, geoscientiﬁc knowledge, and spatial
knowledge. Any further knowledge can be coherently inte-
grated, e.g., prehistoric and archaeological knowledge.
The result matrices reﬂect the key assets with the CRI frame-
work [4] to realise the inventory and symbolic representations
and to enable a continuous development.
B. Resulting symbolic representation of features groups
Figure 1 shows a resulting symbolic representation of a
volcanological features group, strato volcano, as based on the
coherent conceptual knowledge integration. Generated repre-
sentations include integrated CKRI references, projection of
topographic and bathymetric results, and further knowledge
for respective areas. Figure 2 shows a resulting symbolic

representation of a volcanological features group, maars, as
based on the coherent conceptual knowledge integration. The
resulting symbolic representations reﬂect the coherent concep-
tual knowledge (CKRI, UDC references) and topographic and
bathymetric knowledge (CRI components). Projection for all
representations is Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area. Ellipsoid
is World Geodetic System 84 (WGS-84). The conceptual
knowledge references correspond with the symbolism, e.g.,
automatic assignment of symbols, e.g., volcano symbols or
different colours for different volcanological features groups.
These features groups integrate topographic and bathymetric
knowledge, for example. Here, available multi-disciplinary
knowledge can be used for contextualisation, e.g., representing
characteristics, physical properties, plate tectonics, soil, and
age. The conceptual knowledge view groups of object entities
of Holocene-prehistoric volcanological features groups corre-
spond with the result matrix (Table III). Entities of each fea-
tures group refer to any further available volcanological knowl-
edge, e.g., factual knowledge. In these excerpts, the symbolic
representations include the calculated object labels, calculated

country codes, distance markers up to 300 km in 50 km steps,
and calculated country height range of bathymetry/topography.
The
generated
symbolic
representations
can
integrate
most recent knowledge (e.g., factual, conceptual, procedural,
metacognitive, structural) contributed by disciplines and can
therefore consider multi-disciplinary results and ﬁndings in
order to create conceptual knowledge references and new
insight.
IV.
COMPONENTS INTEGRATED FOR IMPLEMENTATION
AND REALISATION
The following passages give a compact overview of major
component implementations and development integrated with
this research. More detailed, comprehensive discussion and ex-
amples regarding fundaments are available with the references
on methodology, contextualisation, and conceptual knowledge.
The created and further developed reference implementa-
tions of conceptual knowledge frameworks (this research major
references in Tables I and II) are used with the implementation
and realisation KR [10].
Conceptual knowledge base is The Universal Decimal Clas-
siﬁcation (UDC) [11], a general plan for knowledge classiﬁ-
cation, providing an analytico-synthetic and faceted classiﬁca-
tion, designed for subject description and indexing of content
of information resources irrespective of the carrier, form, for-
mat, and language. UDC-based references for demonstration
are taken from the multi-lingual UDC summary [11] released
by the UDC Consortium, Creative Commons license [12].
Relevant scientiﬁc practices, frameworks, and standards
from disciplines and contexts are integrated with the Knowl-
edge Resources, e.g., here details regarding volcanological
features [13], chronologies, spatial information, and Volcanic
Explosivity Index (VEI) [14].
All integration components, for all disciplines, require an
explicit and continuous formalisation [15] process. The for-
malisation includes computation model support, e.g., paralleli-
sation standards, OpenMP [16], Reg Exp patterns, e.g., Perl
Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) [17].
Methodologies for creating and utilising methods include
model processing, remote sensing, spatial mapping, high in-
formation densities, and visualisation. Respective contextual-
isation of (prehistoric) scenarios should each be done under
speciﬁc (prehistoric) conditions, especially supported by state-
of-the-art methods, e.g., spatial operations, triangulation, gra-
dient computation, and projection.
The symbolic representation of the contextualisation can

GEOProcessing 2022 : The Fourteenth International Conference on Advanced Geographic Information Systems, Applications, and Services

be done with a wide range of methods, algorithms, and
available components, e.g., via LX Professional Scientiﬁc
Content-Context-Suite (LX PSCC Suite) deploying the Generic
Mapping Tools (GMT) [18] for visualisation.
Prehistoric objects and contexts are taken from The Pre-
history and Archaeology Knowledge Archive (PAKA), in con-
tinuous development for more than three decades [19] and is
released by DIMF [20].
Several coherent systems of major natural sciences’ context
object groups from KR realisations have been implemented,
especially Knowledge Resources focussing on volcanological
features [14] deployed with in depth contextualisation [13] and
with a wide range [11] of contexts [10] and structures [21].
The contextualisation for the inventory can employ state-of-
the-art results from many disciplines, e.g., context from the
natural sciences resources, integrating their inherent represen-
tation and common utilisation, e.g., points, polygons, lines,
Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Digital Terrain Model (DTM),
and Digital Surface Model (DSM) representations sources,
e.g., from satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), z-
value representations, distance representations, area repre-
sentations, raster, vector, binary, and non-binary data. Em-
ployed resources are High Resolution (HR) (Space) Shuttle
Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) [22] data fusion [23], HR
Digital Chart of the World (DCW) [24], and Global Self-
consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography (GSHHG)
[25]. SRTM was produced under the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) Making Earth System Data
Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) pro-
gram. The Land Processed Distributed Active Archive Center
(LPDAAC), USA [26], operates as a partnership between the
U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA), USA, and is a component
of NASA’s Earth Observing System Data and Information
System (EOSDIS). Resources are released by NASA and JPL
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), USA, data [27] and site [28].
SRTM15 Plus [23] is continuously updated and improved [22].
Scientiﬁc context parametrisation of prehistoric targets can
use the overall insight from all disciplines, e.g., parametrising
algorithms and creating palaeolandscapes.
Structure is an organisation of interrelated entities in a mate-
rial or non-material object or system [21]. Structure is essential
in logic as it carries unique information. Structure means
features and facilities. There are merely higher and lower
facility levels of how structures can be addressed, which result
from structure levels. Structure can, for example, be addressed
by logic, names, references, address labels, pointers, fuzzy
methods, phonetic methods. The deployment of long-term
universal structure and data standards is essential. Relevant
examples of sustainable implementations are NetCDF [29]
based standards, including advanced features, hybrid structure
integration, and parallel computing support (PnetCDF) and
generic multi-dimensional table data, standard xyz ﬁles, uni-
versal source and text based structure and code representations.
V.
DISCUSSION
Implementation and realisation provide a coherent concep-
tual contextualisation and a seamlessly coherent conceptual
knowledge integration with any available knowledge resources.
The practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory of volcanological
features groups shows important characteristics for multi-
disciplinary knowledge space, e.g.:
•
Coherent conceptual knowledge integration.
•
Selection and coherent integration of resources.
•
Flexible criteria for knowledge integration.
•
High level of knowledge consistency.
•
High level of reproducibility for workﬂows and results.
•
Automated and semi-automated workﬂow creation.
•
Consequent multi-language support (e.g., UDC).
•
Deployment of structural knowledge.
•
Deployment of available processing and ﬁltering.
•
Spatial integration and processing.
•
Georeferencing, generic components and results.
Characteristics for component space are, e.g.:
•
Dynamical integration of resources and workﬂows.
•
Arbitrary numbers of contextualisation results.
•
Flexible creation of workﬂows and parallelisation.
•
Scalable realisation, e.g., parallelisation models.
Knowledge and its complements are interrelated with pos-
sible structures and the organisation of knowledge, which
contributes to the facilities, which can be parametrised and
deployed, e.g., ﬂexibility of data locality and parallelisation.
The reference implementation supports parallelisation, e.g.,
embarrassingly parallel procedures, e.g., via OpenMP [16] and
job parallel procedures. The CRI framework components allow
efﬁcient parallelisations for any part of workﬂows and re-
sources, e.g., parallel computation, processing, and generation
of frames from satellite data including parallel deployment of
Knowledge Resources for multi-dimensional model creation.
Each set of component integration can range from a few to
millions of entities for each result group and in consequence
millions of symbolic representations for integrated contexts.
In the case of the practical Holocene-prehistoric inventory of
volcanological features groups we create about 500–1000 basic
object entity sets per context.
VI.
CONCLUSION
Employing the methodology of coherent conceptual knowl-
edge classiﬁcation for developing a coherent context integra-
tion in prehistory and archaeology proved efﬁcient and sus-
tainable. The goal of creating a practical Holocene-prehistoric
inventory of worldwide volcanological features groups based
on the CKRI and CRI framework was successful achieved and
allows further coherent contextualisation with knowledge re-
sources, especially for the integration and contextualisation of
multi-disciplinary research in prehistory, archaeology, natural
sciences, and humanities.
Future work will address the resulting and continuously
further developed Holocene-prehistoric inventory of worldwide
volcanological features, continuous resources development, co-
herent conceptual knowledge contextualisation and integration
with prehistorical and archaeological knowledge resources,
including further georeferencing and spatial processing.
