INTRODUCTION
The standard from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) with the label of 802.11ah [1] is a quite
hot topic in the ﬁeld of the Internet of Things (IoT). For the
purpose of communication between even very small electrical
appliances this represents a very new and efﬁcient way of
communication [2].
The world of IoT is full of electrical sensors, accessories,
wearables, security elements, various appliances utilizable in
Smart Home (for instance lighting, cooking, heating) and
also agriculture monitoring, industrial automation and smart
metering. The number of mentioned devices is supposed to
raise rapidly in the near future what is related with signiﬁcant
security risks.
Therefore, the main goal of this preliminary study is
aimed at analysis of possible ways of shielding communication
under this standard against eavesdropping outside a room or a
building.
This study is partially based on the previous work [3]
where the goal was to reﬂect wireless communication under
standard IEEE 802.11b,g. The ﬁnal computed results of the
optimized structure reﬂecting 2.4 GHz wireless communication
are presented in Fig. 1.
This article includes the following content: Section II
contains a brief description of IEEE 802.11ah. In Section
III, some possible ways of shielding of this type of wireless
communication are described. Finally, Section IV concludes
ideas and ways mentioned in this preliminary study.

IEEE 802.11AH
The IEEE standard of 802.11ah, also called ”Wi-Fi
HaLow”, has a great potential of usability in the area of IoT
because of two main reasons [4]:
•
Low power consumption thanks to a native power
saving mechanism with sleep modes (should consume
much less energy than Bluetooth or Wireless-Fidelity
(Wi-Fi) of earlier standards b, g, a or n)

Both items mentioned above are based on the key techno-
logical features of IEEE 802.11ah [5]:
•
Sub 1 GHz frequency
•

Access Control Layer (MAC layer). These new layers

include several modiﬁcations with respect to con-
solidated IEEE standards. The IEEE 802.11ah MAC
layer incorporates most of the main IEEE 802.11
characteristics, adding some novel power management
mechanisms.
•
Typical range of IEEE 802.11ah is 100 – 1000 m
•
Transmission power is <10 mW – <1 W (depending
on the country’s regulations)
•
Battery operation should be from months to years (also
thanks to long sleeping periods)
The mentioned standard is very new. It was standardized
and introduced only few months ago, in January 4 2016 [1]
(the ﬁrst IEEE 802.11 standard was released in June 1997).
The ﬁrst certiﬁed devices should come soon (probably in 2017
or 2018). Due to these data, the topic of this study is unique
and potentially very important and interesting from the point
of view of secure communication.

SHIELDING
Considering wireless communication between electrical
sensor or general devices using IEEE 802.11ah, the ﬁrst idea of
how to shield a communication in a room, in a small building
or area is to use
A)
A Faraday cage or
B)
A wallpaper reﬂecting only a speciﬁc frequency
range.
A. Faraday Cage
Faraday cages are named after the English scientist Michael
Faraday. Faraday shield (cage) is an enclosure made from a
conductive material or by a mesh of such material to block
electric ﬁelds.
These shields – cages can be used to protect different kinds
of electronic equipment from electrostatic discharges. They
cannot block magnetic ﬁelds like Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, but
they can protect the interior from electromagnetic radiation
coming from the outside. An external electrical ﬁeld leads to
rearrangement of the charges, and this cancels the ﬁeld inside.
Electric ﬁelds (applied externally) create forces on electrons in
the conductor, creating a current, which will further result in
charge rearrangement. The current will cease when the charges
rearrange and the applied ﬁeld inside is cancelled [6].
This approach is cheap but has several very negative side
effects. First of all, whole frequencies coming to or from a
cage are reﬂected, generally:
•
Global System for Mobile (GSM) [7]
•
Universal
Mobile
Telecommunications
System
(UMTS) [8]
•
Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [9]
•
2.4 and 5 GHz Wi-Fi [4]
•
Bluetooth [5]
•
and possibly also the visible light if not using a mesh
This approach may go against the original aim to use IEEE
802.11ah in longer distances.

channelization [16].
B. FSS
Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSSs) [10] are important
spatial ﬁlters, which can efﬁciently ﬁlter desired band of
frequencies. Therefore, these can play a signiﬁcant role in
electromagnetic related problems.
Frequency selective surfaces can be used and adjusted to
prepare a structure reﬂecting just a desired narrow range of a
spectrum.
To brieﬂy sketch the history, the beginning of FSS relates
to Ben A. Munk who was the guru of this approach [10]. In
the last decade, the idea of FSS has spread out into many
applications. Example of a band-pass FSS is in [11] where
the goal was to transmit GSM signals through energy efﬁcient
windows. One of the ﬁrst FSS absorbers was presented by
Salisbury and Jaumann [12]. Great research has been already
done in the ﬁeld of FSS including also the analysis of fre-
quency characteristics of dielectric period structures [13] and
another analysis of characteristics of dielectric grating of left-
handed and right-handed materials [14]. FSS are also used in
the antenna theory and experiments like analysis of ultra wide
band planar monopole antenna and its design [15].
This second idea of how to shield the communication is to
use a special pattern/wallpaper selectively attenuating just the
frequency range used in IEEE 802.11ah.
With respect to the design, rules and law of various
countries the frequency range for Europe is 863 – 868 MHz
(for example in USA it is 902 – 928 MHz and in China it
is 755 – 787 MHz) [16]. Fig. 3 presents the ranges in more
detail.
The standard of IEEE 802.11ah is operating in sub-
gigahertz frequencies in comparison with traditional IEEE
802.11b or IEEE 802.11g working at 2.4 GHz and IEEE
802.11a working at 5 GHz.
The schema of a typical FSS structure: simple cross and a
Jerusalem-cross is presented in Fig. 4. Both models consist of
simple rectangular elements. Theoretically, the second geom-
etry may have better reﬂection. Moreover double-layer should
provide a more narrow band-stop ﬁlter.
In Fig. 4, a and aj represent the width and height of a
cell (a cell is just one square element of the whole structure
of FSS; index j relates to the structure depicted on the right:
the Jerusalem-cross), l and lj is the total width and height of

Jerusalem-cross (on the right).
the cross, w and wj is the width of an arm and lej represents
the length of the bar connected to the end of an arm of the
Jerusalem-cross.
There is also a special software suitable for optimization
of FSS elements. It is FSSMR software [17], which was
developed at Tomas Bata University in Zlin and which analyses
the planar periodic structures and tries to optimize them with
respect to the optimization goals. Therefore, this software is
suitable for estimation of proper values of design variables (a,
aj, l, lj, w, wj, and lej) to meet the optimization goals (and
thus to reﬂect the desired frequency band in this case of IEEE
802.11ah).
There are also some shortages in this approach. One of the
most questionable aspects of the FSS approach is the inﬂuence
of the angle of incidence which must be also examined.
Another problem is with windows when attempting to secure
a room against transmitting sub 1 GHz frequencies outside the
room.
IV.
CONCLUSION
A very new standard for wireless communication suitable
for the Internet of Things, IEEE 802.11ah, has been introduced
in this preliminary study together with possible ways of how to
shield communication under mentioned standard. A theoretical
concept of a wallpaper with a deep practical impact has been
revealed. Also, some shortages of this approach have been
described.
The boom of Internet of Things is coming. It can make
life simpler (like other technologies in the history), but it also
contains a great portion of a threat of abuse. This article points
this out.
Further analysis, design of FSS ﬁlter with adaptation to
the narrow speciﬁc range of frequencies and also practical
experiments should be processed in further work.
