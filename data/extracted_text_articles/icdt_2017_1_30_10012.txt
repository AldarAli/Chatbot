Abstract - New waveforms for the 5th generation cellular
system have been studied in many ways. The sharper out-of-band
(OOB)
spectrum
characteristics
are
greatly
desired
for
improving the spectrum efficiency. Generally, universal filtered
multi-carrier (UFMC), filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) and
weighted
overlap
and
add
orthogonal
frequency
division
multiplexing (WOLA-OFDM) waveforms are regarded as strong
waveform candidates for the 5th generation mobile system.
Similar
to
the
conventional
orthogonal
frequency
division
multiplexing (OFDM) system, these modulation methods use
multi-carrier. So, these systems have high peak to average power
ratio (PAPR), which can cause nonlinear distortion and the out-
of-band (OOB) power will increase because of the nonlinear high
power amplifier (HPA). In this paper, we evaluate the spectrum
characteristic and bit error rate (BER) performance of the
waveforms under the effect of nonlinear HPA. Also, we show the
comparison of the time-frequency resources of each system
because it is very important to estimate the spectral efficiency
and communication throughput. As simulation results, it is
confirmed that the OOB power of each system increases, and the
OOB power increase of the FBMC system is the largest. We
provide the comparison table for the time-frequency resources
requirement for the each multi-carrier system.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, mobile traffic has increased dramatically because
the number of various mobile devices and multimedia services
has increased [1]. Also, the growth of mobile traffic has
accelerated. It is difficult for the present mobile communication
system to support the mobile traffic required in the future [2].
In order to solve the problem, studies for next generation 5G
mobile communication are being actively carried out [3] [4].
Conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) based on multi-carrier has high-power out-of-band
(OOB)
[5].
This
characteristic
causes
adjacent
channel
interference (ACI). OFDM uses a wide guard band in order to
avoid ACI. It decreases spectral efficiency when a number of
mobile devices simultaneously access a base station. Next
generation mobile communication system requires high-level
key performance indicators (KPIs). It is difficult for OFDM to
satisfy the KPIs. Universal filtered multi-carrier (UFMC) and
filter bank based multi-carrier (FBMC) are known as the
waveform candidates for 5G mobile communication [6] [7].
When the f-OFDM, suggested by Huawei, appeared in the first
place, the filtered-OFDM system adopted one-filter system for
the sharper OOB spectrum characteristics. However, they
changed into the multiple filter system, which became very
similar to the UFMC system. These systems use filtering
techniques based on the multi-carrier. These techniques have
the characteristic of low OOB power spectrum in comparison
with the conventional OFDM. Therefore, these systems have
high spectrum efficiency. FBMC uses the filtering technique in
each sub-carrier. UFMC uses a filtering technique in each sub-
band [8] [9].
However, these systems based on the multi-carrier are
vulnerable to non-linearity of high-power amplifier (HPA), like
OFDM. OFDM has high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
because multi-carrier signals are overlapped. High PAPR
causes nonlinear distortion in HPA because it saturates HPA.
Similarly, UFMC and FBMC have high PAPR because these
systems are based on multi-carrier [10] [11]. In UFMC and
FBMC systems, if nonlinear distortion is caused by high PAPR,
the OOB power of these systems is increased. That is, the
advantage of these systems vanishes. Therefore, this drawback
should be overcome in the candidate techniques for 5G mobile
communication.
In this paper, in order to overcome the drawback, we focus
on the spectrum characteristic analysis and the performance
evaluation of FBMC and UFMC systems under the effect of
nonlinear HPA. Firstly, we describe and explain OFDM,
UFMC,
FBMC,
weighted
overlap
and
add
orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (WOLA-OFDM)
system.
Then, we design the systems in the linear environment and we
analyze the spectrum characteristic of each system and evaluate
the bit error rate (BER) performance of each system in this
linear condition. Next, we consider the nonlinear condition. So,
we analyze the spectrum characteristic and evaluate the bit
error rate (BER) performance of each one of the modulation
systems under the effect of nonlinear HPA.
Also, we show the comparison of the time-frequency
resources of each system because it is very important to
estimate
the
spectral
efficiency
and
communication
throughput. We provide the comparison table for the time-
frequency
resources
requirement
for
the
each
one
of
modulation systems.
In Section 2, each candidate multi-carrier system is
described and the Saleh model is included for the nonlinear
modelling. Simulation parameters are set for the OOB power
evaluation and time resource requirement in Section 3. Finally,
we conclude this paper in Section 4.

SYSTEM MODEL
A. OFDM
In the transmitter of OFDM system, the data symbols are
converted into a parallel stream from a series stream by the
13

ICDT 2017 : The Twelfth International Conference on Digital Telecommunications

serial to parallel (S/P) block. The changed symbols are mapped
onto each subcarrier by the inverse fast Fourier transform
(IFFT) operation. IFFT operation transforms the frequency-
domain signal into time-domain signal. After the IFFT
operation, the time-domain signals are converted into the
stream by parallel to serial (P/S) block. Then, cyclic prefix (CP)
is added in order to reduce the effect of inter-symbol
interference (ISI). Next, the base-band signals are applied to
the radio frequency (RF) chain. Finally, the RF signal is
amplified by high-power amplifier (HPA). The receiver of
OFDM system consists of the reverse structure in comparison
with the OFDM transmitter. In the OFDM receiver, an
equalizer is used to compensate the multi-path effect. Simple
one-tap equalizer can be used because of the CP. This is an
advantage for the OFDM system. However, each subcarrier of
OFDM system has high side-lobe power. Therefore, OOB
power spectrum increases, which makes the guard band wider
between the information channels. As a result, channel capacity
is decreased in the OFDM system [12]. These drawbacks
should be overcome for 5G mobile communication.
B. UFMC
The UFMC system also uses orthogonal multi-carrier, like
the OFDM system. UFMC filters each sub-band that consists
of orthogonal multi-carrier in order to reduce the OOB power
[6]. Each sub-band signal is converted into a series stream by
the P/S. Secondly, in the UFMC receiver, the received signal is
applied to the RF chain. The received signal is transformed into
a baseband signal by the RF chain. The baseband signal is
converted into digital signal by ADC. Then, time-domain pre-
processing is done. After this process, the series data stream is
converted into a parallel data stream by S/P. The time-domain
parallel data stream is converted to frequency-domain stream
by the 2N-FFT operation [6]. After the 2N-FFT operation, odd
numbered data symbols are selected and equalized. The
spectrum of the UFMC system has lower OOB power in
comparison with the spectrum of the OFDM system. This is an
advantage. However, because the UFMC system uses multi-
carriers and multi-carriers are overlapped, the UFMC system
has high PAPR. The high PAPR characteristic can distort the
signal of the UFMC system [6].
C. FBMC
The FBMC system uses multi-carrier, too. The FBMC
system filters each sub-carrier in order to reduce the OOB
power spectrum [7]. In the transmitter of the FBMC system,
data symbols are converted into a parallel stream from a series
stream by the S/P. The parallel symbols are modulated to offset
the quadrature amplitude modulation (OQAM) signal [7]. The
modulated OQAM signal is converted into a signal filtered by
each sub-carrier by using a synthesis filter bank which consists
of IFFT and poly phase network (PPN) [7]. Finally, the
amplified FBMC signal is transmitted by the antenna. The
receiver of the FBMC system consists of a reversed structure in
comparison with the FBMC transmitter. The FBMC system has
lower OOB power in comparison with the UFMC system and
the OFDM system. This is an advantage. However, the FBMC
system has high system complexity. Additionally, because the
FBMC system uses multi-carriers, it has high PAPR.
D.
WOLA-OFDM
The WOLA-OFDM is an improved version of the OFDM
system. Fig.1 shows the WOLA-OFDM system. The WOLA-
OFDM system does not use the filter, but it uses the extension
and windowing method on each OFDM symbol in order to
reduce the OOB power spectrum.

COMPARISON OF OOB POWER CHARACTERISTICS
After the simulation using the parameters from Tables 1
and 2, we can get the OOB (out-of-band) power spectrum at
the output of the HPA of each system. Table 3 shows the OOB
power spectrum comparison for each system. The lower the
OOB power, the more desirable it is to set the smaller guard
band and finally to increase the spectrum efficiency. From
Table 3, it can be confirmed that under the HPA nonlinearity
environment, the FBMC system shows the biggest change of
OOB power, and the OFDM system shows the smallest change.
Figures 2 to 5 show BER performances of each multi-
carrier system. Compared with the linear condition, BER
performance of every system is degraded in the nonlinear HPA
environment. Importantly, the FBMC system shows the
smallest degradation of BER performance. However, even
though the FBMC system is the strongest against HPA
nonlinearity, every multi-carrier system needs the PAPR
reduction method for the nonlinear distortion compensation
and power saving.

After the investigation of OOB spectrum power at 7.5MHz
offset frequency from the information signal band and time
resource requirement for the above 4-QAM transmission, we
can get Table 4 showing the OOB (out-of-band) power and
required time resource for each multi-carrier system under
several nonlinear HPA conditions. As seen in Table 4, OFDM
and WOLA-OFDM have almost no change from the linear case
to the nonlinear condition 4. However, UFMC and FBMC have
some quite big change from the linear case to the nonlinear
condition 4. As in Table 4, OFDM and UFMC systems have
the time resource length of 292. WOLA-OFDM system has
time resource length of 302. However, FBMC system has the
longest time length of 480. So, FBMC requires longer time
resource even though it has very sharp OOB power spectrum in
the linear condition.
Even though 4-QAM is used for the simulation and time
frequency requirement, the trend would be almost the same
when extended into higher modulation levels.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
The FBMC and UFMC systems are strong modulation
candidates for 5G mobile communication systems. Since these
systems are basically multi-carrier systems, it is important to
study the non-linearity sensitivity. In this paper, we have
focused
on
spectrum
characteristic
analysis
and
BER
performance evaluation of OFDM, FBMC, and UFMC,
WOLA-OFDM systems under the effect of nonlinear HPA. As
simulation results, we have confirmed that, if the HPA non-
linearity rises in each multi-carrier system, the OOB power of
each multi-carrier system increases. The OOB power increase
of the FBMC system is the biggest. Additionally, we have
confirmed that the performance of every multi-carrier system is
degraded by the strength of the HPA non-linearity, and every
system needs the PAPR reduction method for the non-linear
distortion compensation and power saving, even though it
would be more complicated. Also, we show the comparison of
the time frequency resources of each multi-carrier system
because it would be very important to estimate the spectral
efficiency and communication throughput. We provide the
comparison table for the time-frequency resources requirement
for each multi-carrier system.
The next step will be on the system design and evaluation
of the PAPR reduction scheme and complexity comparison for
the system implementation.
