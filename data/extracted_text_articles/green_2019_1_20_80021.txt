Abstract— Communication networks are not only important to
society, they also consume a lot of energy. Recent years
research has focused on Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-
RAN) to decrease the energy consumption in mobile networks.
Hence, this work investigates how to lower the energy
consumption in the Ethernet based fronthaul network by
choosing the right C-RAN functional split. Different functional
splits assign different loads to the fronthaul network, and this
work considers how much impact the data load has on the
fronthaul network’s energy consumption. This work presents a
model for the fronthaul energy consumption, which takes the
different steps of the Ethernet switch operations into account.
The
outcome
of
this
model
shows
the
extremely
high
importance of choosing the right functional split when mobile
networks are entering the era of 5th Generation (5G). The
impact of switch capacity and size of Ethernet packets is also
considered. In a 5G worst case scenario, one switch will
consume the same amount of energy as 199 households. The
difference in energy consumption between the best and worst
case scenario of this paper is 99.32% per switch.

INTRODUCTION
The Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
sector counts for over 2% of the world’s carbon emissions
nowadays [1]. However, the energy consumption of the ICT
sector is forecasted to increase by 8% by 2030 in the best
case scenario, and by 20% in the worst case scenario [1]. The
ICT sector covers many areas and one of them is mobile
networks. Mobile networks are growing the most, among all
ICT sectors, in terms of number of subscribers, traffic
demand, connected devices and offered services [2]. The
trend in mobile networks is that more and more capacity is
required and the coverage should be everywhere. Hence,
base stations are widely deployed to cover the largest area
possible, in order to satisfy the users’ needs. The next
generation of mobile networks, the 5th Generation (5G) is
approaching and promises more capacity and higher bitrates.
Thus, an important parameter to consider is how this growth
will affect the energy consumption in mobile networks.
In the mobile network’s base stations, the power
amplifier takes up most of the energy consumption, next
comes the baseband processing and then the cooling [2].
Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architectures have
been introduced to lower these parameters. In C-RAN, the
radio frequency and baseband processing functions from the
base station are split in two units referred to as the Radio
Unit (RU) and the Centralized Unit (CU). The concept is
illustrated in Fig. 1. The RU is located close to the antenna at
the antenna mast, thereby it is convection cooled and settles
for a smaller amplifier. The CUs from several cells can be
gathered in a datacenter, where it is possible for them to
share processing powers when not used at the same time.
Hence, C-RAN will have the possibility of saving energy
consumption in the three most energy consuming parameters
of the traditional base station. The RU and the CU are
connected by a network segment called the fronthaul
network [3]. Originally, only the radio frequency functions
were present in the RU, hence the fronthaul network required
very large bitrates in order to transport a constant stream of
raw In-phase and Quadrature (IQ) data blocks. These blocks
of raw IQ data were transported using a special protocol, for
example Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI). Recently,
the concept of functional splits has been scrutinized, leaving
more processing functions in the RU. The more functions are
left locally in the RU, the lower the bitrate on the fronthaul
network, and gives the possibility of a bitrate varying with
user load, but also a larger and more complex RU.
Additional information regarding the functional splits is
found in [3], which provides an in-depth analysis of the
functional splits including latency and impact on fronthaul

network. Selected functional split (FS) options are illustrated
in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows the RU and CU separated by the
Fronthaul (FH) network, which is illustrated by a green
dotted line. To the right in Fig. 2, the Long Term Evolution
(LTE)/LTE-Advanced(LTE-A)/5G protocol stack illustrates
the location of the different functional splits selected for this
paper. The LTE/LTE-A/5G protocol stack consists of, from
the bottom up: the Radio Frequency functions (RF), the
physical processing (PHY), the Media Access Control
(MAC), the Radio Link Control (RLC) and the Packet Data
Convergence Protocol (PDCP). Further description of the
protocol stack layers can be found in [3]. On the right side of
the figure is a table stating the fronthaul bitrates for LTE,
LTE-A and 5G considering different functional splits. These
fronthaul bitrates are based on calculations in [4] and
extended using the parameters stated in Table I, to also
include LTE and 5G. The fronthaul bitrates are only
considered for the Downlink (DL) direction.
This work investigates how different functional splits
impact the energy consumption in the fronthaul network. The
main goal is to investigate how much energy can be saved,
when using different functional splits and thereby different
bitrates on the fronthaul network. This paper is organized as
follows: Section II provides and overview of research in this
field. Section III introduces Ethernet fronthaul networks.
Section IV outlines a model for energy consumption in the
Ethernet fronthaul network. Section V introduces a small
case study. Section VI presents the results of energy
consumption in the fronthaul network. Section VII discusses
the results provided, considering how to obtain an energy
efficient fronthaul network for 5G. Section VIII concludes
the paper.
II.
STATE OF THE ART
C-RAN has been the topic of much research in recent
years. A detailed description of the technology is found in
[5]. In [6], Sun et al. investigate optimization algorithms to
improve
the
user-centric
energy
efficiency
by
jointly
allocating resources. Fathy et al. [7] present a power model
for a RF/PHY split Passive
Optical Network (PON)
fronthaul considering sleep mode and active RUs. They find
that the average network power consumption is lower using
their
“greedy
selection”
algorithm.
The
work
in
[8]
investigates the energy consumption in the RU considering
different functional splits, digital and analogue. In contrast to
the previous mentioned papers, this work looks into the
energy consumption in the fronthaul network specifically. In
[9] Tan et al. analyse the energy consumption in RF/PHY
split stating that 90 % of the energy is consumed by the RU,
9% by the CU datacenter and 1% by a 10G Ethernet PON
fronthaul network. The work in [10] by Kondepu et al.
investigate the energy efficiency for the fronthaul network
for a flexible functional split, by switching on and off
resources using Software Defined Networking (SDN). This
work distinguishes from previous mentioned papers by
considering
the
energy
consumption
for
each
of
the
functional splits and not the best option available. Further, it
considers Ethernet for fronthaul transport. With regard to the
arguments provided in this section, this work represents an
uninvestigated area of looking into the fronthaul energy
consumption while considering the different functional splits
individually.

network consists of different elements, depending on the
type of network. In an Ethernet fronthaul network, the RU
and CU are connected by fibers, transmitting Ethernet
frames, and Ethernet switches, forwarding Ethernet frames in
the right direction. The fibers alone do not consume any
energy, they are just pipes, whereas the Ethernet switches
require energy in order to function. Ethernet is a packet
switched network technology, where it is possible to assign
capacity depending on user load. As a fronthaul network,
Ethernet benefits in being flexible and already widely used in
other network segments. Table II summarizes three options
for fronthaul transmission. The option of transmitting
fronthaul data using CPRI; this option is most beneficial for
functional splits located between the RF and the resource
element mapper function, i.e., functional splits having a
constant bitrate on the fronthaul link [3]. The same
functional splits can be transported over Ethernet using a
gateway to encapsulate CPRI into Ethernet frames; this is
referred to as CPRI over Ethernet. Another solution is
fronthaul transmission over Ethernet. This solution is
preferred for functional splits with a variable bitrate on the
fronthaul link, i.e., those having the resource mapper
included in the RU. Table II represents the current status of
the network – the RUs connected using CPRI, and the
Ethernet solutions as an option for the future fronthaul
network for 5G.
In the future 5G network, the RAN will be expanded with
more antennas. This will increase the demands to the
fronthaul network even more, as not only higher bitrates
shall be transported, but also more streams are present from
the higher numbers of RUs and antennas. The following
formula can be used for an estimate of the amount of RUs in
an area covered by one CU assuming a circular coverage
area:
ܴܷܰ =
ߨ∙ܦܯܣܺ2
ߨ∙ܦݏ݈݅݊݃݁2∙ܴܣܶݏ
(1)
DMAX is the maximal distance between the CU and the
RU due to fronthaul latency constraints. Dsingle is the
maximal transmission distance for one single antenna. Radio
Access Technologies (RATs) describe how many RUs are
present at each antenna site. They describe whether 3rd
Generation (3G), LTE, LTE-A etc. are present in the current
area, as each RAT requires its own RU. The amount of RUs
found in (1) can be used to find the estimated number of
switches covering the current area. Hence, each RU is
connected to one ingoing port in an Ethernet switch.
Equation 2 expresses the lowest number of switches Nsw to
cover an area:
ܹܰܵ = ܴܷܰ
ܰ݌݋ݎݐ(2)
In (2), Nport is the number of ingoing ports in each switch.
In 5G networks, more capacity will be provided for the
users. More capacity can be obtained e.g. by adding more
bandwidth to the system or by adding more RUs for denser
coverage and hotspot compliance. If more RUs are added to
the system, more switches are necessary in the fronthaul
network (as seen in (2)). If adding more bandwidth to
increase the capacity, less RUs are necessary leading to less
switches in the fronthaul network. The energy efficiency of
the Ethernet fronthaul network depends on the number of
RUs, the bandwidth available and the number of ports in
each Ethernet switch.
IV.
AN ETHERNET FRONTHAUL ENERGY CONSUMPTION
MODEL
An Ethernet switch consists of different components.
Ethernet frames are received in input modules, which type
depends on whether the network is optical or electrical. Then

the Ethernet frames are sent into the switch via receiving
ports. When entering the switch, the Frame Check Sequence
(FCS) is checked and the frame is stored in a First In First
Out (FIFO) queue. Then the address field in the frame is
read, and matched in an address lookup process to the right
outgoing port. Afterwards the frame is again stored in a
FIFO queue, before it is sent to the outgoing ports and
transmitted via output modules. Fig. 3 illustrates the
composition of an Ethernet switch. All of these processes
consume energy depending on the fronthaul link bitrate.
In an Ethernet fronthaul network, each switch consumes
energy related to the amount of incoming traffic. This is
expressed in (3), where PFH is the total power in W
consumed when transmitting data over the fronthaul network
between the RU and CU. PSW is the total power consumed by
one switch, and that is multiplied by the number of switches
NSW.
ܲܨܪ=ܹܲܵ∙ܹܰܵ(3)
Equation 4 determines the power consumed in one
switch. Pstandby is the power always consumed in the switch to
keep it running. Ppk is the power consumed by the switch
when forwarding one packet. Pbit is the power consumed by
the switch when forwarding one bit.
 ܹܲܵ = ܲݏݐܾܽ݊݀ݕ+ܲ݌݇∙ܰ݌݇+ܾܲ݅ݐ∙ܾܰ݅ݐ(4)
To determine the power consumed by the switch when
forwarding one packet, requires the power consumed by the
process only used once per packet, namely the MAC address
lookup (PMAC). This function’s power consumption is
divided by the maximal number of packets forwarded per
second.

ܰܯܣܺ݌݇(5)
N Maxpk, the maximal number of packets forwarded per
second, is calculated by dividing the switch’s maximum line
bitrate by the minimum packet size.
Determining the power consumed by the switch when
forwarding one bit, requires the power consumed by the
processes where each bit is handled, namely the reception
(PRX), the FCS check (PFCS), two FIFOs (PFIFO) and the
transmission (PTX). These functions power consumption is
divided by the maximal number of bits forwarded per
second.

N Maxbit, the maximal number of bits forwarded per

The given model is used for further investigation of the
energy consumption in an Ethernet fronthaul network.
V.
CASE STUDY
An Ethernet fronthaul limited by 20 km latency [5] using
3-sectorized antennas covering 13 km2 per 3-sector, would
need a total of 291 antennas/ RUs to cover the entire area. If
the area is fully covered by four RATs (for example 3G,
LTE, LTE-A and 5G) the total number of RUs in the area is
1164,
considering
(1).
Using
24
port
switches,
this
corresponds to 49 switches considering (2). These numbers
only provide a rough estimate, but it gives the idea that 50
switches in the area covered by one CU-datacenter is not an
unrealistic number.
The calculations in this paper use a Cisco Catalyst 9200
switch for reference. This switch has a standby power of 35
W [11]. The switch has a power consumption of 42,27 W in
case of full port traffic and 100% load [11]. The difference
between standby and full load is thereby 7.27 W. Dividing
this number into four switch processes, those mentioned in
the model (FCS, MAC, FIFO, FIFO), a rough assumption is
that each process consumes 1.8 W. The switch is assumed to
use 24 ports running 1 Gb speed and transmitting/receiving
via SFP+ modules consuming 1.5 W each [12].

model outlined in Section IV, combined with the switch
energy consumption numbers provided in section V, the
following results are obtained, illustrated in Fig. 4-8.

different sizes of packets do not affect the total energy
consumed by all bits (Pbit*Nbit) and neither the standby
power (Pstandby) this is as expected as none of these
parameters are affected by increasing packet sizes. However,
the energy consumed for all packets (Ppk*Npk) is much
affected by different packet sizes. The decrease in energy
consumption between transmitting only the smallest possible
Ethernet packets, and only the largest possible Ethernet
packets is 95.78%.
Fig. 5 illustrates the percentage of total switch energy
consumption as a function of the packet sizes. The figure
illustrates different functional splits using 5G RAT. It is clear
that the RF/PHY split consumes the largest percentage of
energy. The figure shows how large effect the packet size
has, thus the energy consumption percentage decreases
slightly when the packets are larger. It is not possible to see
the functional splits PHY/MAC and RLC/PCP in the figure
as they consume much less energy. However, in those splits
the decrease in energy consumption between transmitting
only the smallest possible Ethernet packet, and only the
largest possible Ethernet packet is 2.66% in both cases
whereas for the RF/PHY split the difference is 2.84%.
Fig. 6 illustrates the energy consumption in the fronthaul
network when using different functional splits and different
RATs. Note that it is illustrated on a logarithmic scale. This
calculation assumes that the packet size is 1518 B. The
figure shows the energy consumption in the fronthaul
network using LTE, LTE-A and 5G RATs. The figure states
huge differences in power consumption for the different
functional splits using LTE-A and 5G. In 5G, the energy
saving by using split PDCP/RLC compared to split RF/PHY
is 99.32% per switch, compared to LTE where the energy
saving is only 27.66% between the two splits. Or in other
words if assuming one household consumes 3500 kWh per
year, then the fronthaul energy consumption in 5G using
split RF/PHY covers 199 households per switch, where split
PDCP/RLC covers less than 1.5 households per switch. In
Fig. 6, the power consumption for LTE does not differ much
when comparing the different functional splits, meaning that
significant energy consumption reductions or increases will
not be present using this RAT.
Fig. 7 shows the yearly fronthaul energy consumption in
kWh using 5G RAT This calculation assumes that the packet
size is 1518 B. The energy consumption is illustrated by
increasing number of switches. As the figure shows, then the
Energy consumption increases by number of switches in the
network. The figure illustrates how much energy is required
to run a fronthaul network with many switches, as illustrated
in the case study in Section V, where 50 switches did not
seem unrealistic in the area covered by one CU-pool.
Fig. 8 illustrates on a logarithmic scale, how the fronthaul
energy consumption increases when more RUs are added to
the network. In the figure, each switch is assumed to have 24
ingoing ports, and the indent behavior of the graph shows the
capacity of each switch.

necessary. In that regard, the fronthaul network must be
carefully aligned. From the results, it seems like there is a
large gap in the bitrates and energy consumption between the
PHY split and the MAC/PHY split. The MAC/PHY split has
the physical processing in the RU and handles all baseband
processing in the CU. This means a relatively simple RU and
a significantly lower energy consumption.
Results in this work show how the choice of a functional
split, the number of RUs and the number of ingoing ports per
Ethernet switch has huge impact on the energy consumption
in an Ethernet fronthaul network. The energy consumption
does not differ much between the different functional splits
when considering LTE, but when entering the era of 5G, the
fronthaul
networks
will
suffer
from
large
energy
consumption. To lower the energy consumption in the
fronthaul network, the choice of a functional split becomes
very
important,
together
with
high
capacity
Ethernet
switches, and packet sizes. Slight decreases are obtained by
transmitting larger sized packets even in splits PHY/MAC
and PCP/RLC. In this model, a fixed packet size is used
which is very optimistic. In reality packets will be of
different sizes, and the smaller packets, the more packets are
necessary to transmit the same amount of data. At the same
time, every packet carries a header, so more packets means
more headers. Hence, using smaller packets, more bits have
to be transmitted. In relation to that, it might not always be
possible to fill up an entire Ethernet packet. Some functions
in the protocol stack are time critical, e.g. the HARQ process
[13]. In a time critical transmission, the packet might need to
be sent before it is filled, leading to smaller packets and more
overhead transmission.
Fig. 7 shows the energy consumed by up to 50 switches
in a network. According to the roughly estimated calculation
of the number of switches in Section III, then 50 switches in
the coverage area of one CU is not unrealistic. It depends on
several factors, for example, if the area is covered only by
three RATs, then the number of switches required is reduced
to 37. These assumptions are though not completely realistic.
In reality the area might be fully covered by 3G and LTE
RATs, and then LTE-A and 5G will be used to cover
hotspots. Different cell sizes are not considered. Considering
the energy consumption of 25 switches this corresponds to
the energy consumption of 4975 households when using split
RF/PHY in 5G and split PDCP/RLC covers less than 38
households.
The results representing 5G and the extremely high
bitrates and energy consumption related to that is only an
extrapolation, but is found useful as a guideline for what can
be expected.
VIII.
CONCLUSION
This work investigated energy consumption in Ethernet-
based fronthaul networks for current and future mobile
networks. The fronthaul network connects the RU at the
antenna site and the CU located in a datacenter. A model for
the fronthaul energy consumption was presented, taking the
different steps of the switching process into account. The
outcome of this work shows the extremely high importance
of choosing the right functional split, when mobile networks
are entering the era of 5G, as significant reductions in energy
consumption can be obtained. Many assumptions have been
made due to lack of data but the paper gives an overview of
the energy consumption now compared to 5G mobile
networks, and predicts that in a worst case scenario one
switch will consume the same amount of energy as 199
households. Suggestions provided in this paper to lower the
energy consumption in the fronthaul network includes:
choosing a functional split with lower fronthaul bitrates,
development of low energy consuming Ethernet switches
with many ports, and attempt to fill up Ethernet packets in
order to transmit as large packets as possible and utilize the
already used resources to a higher degree.
