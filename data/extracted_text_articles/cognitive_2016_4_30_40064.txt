Abstract—A standard approach to model retinal ganglion cells
uses reverse correlation to construct a linear-nonlinear model
using a cascade of a linear ﬁlter and a static nonlinearity.
A major constraint with this technique is the need to use
a radially symmetric stimulus, such as Gaussian white noise.
Natural visual stimuli are required to generate a more realistic
ganglion-cell model. However, natural visual stimuli signiﬁcantly
differ from white noise stimuli and are not radially symmetric.
Therefore a more sophisticated modelling approach than the
linear-nonlinear method is required for modelling ganglion cells
stimulated with natural images. Machine learning algorithms
have proved very capable in modelling complex non-linear
systems in other scientiﬁc domains. In this paper, we report on the
development of computational models, using different machine
learning regression algorithms, that model retinal ganglion
cells stimulated with natural images in order to predict the
number of spikes elicited. Neuronal recordings obtained from
electro-physiological experiments in which isolated salamander
retinas are stimulated with static natural images are used to
develop these models. In order to compare the performance of
the machine learning models, a linear-nonlinear model was also
developed from separate experiments using Gaussian white noise
stimuli. A comparison of the spike prediction using the models
developed shows that the machine learning models perform better
than the linear-nonlinear approach.

INTRODUCTION
It is well established that retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) play
an important role in early stage biological visual processing
by generating action potentials onto the optic nerve, based on
the visual stimulus that falls on the photo-receptors. Various
studies have identiﬁed different types of ganglion cells present
in the mammalian retina and much of their functionalities
[1]–[3]. An important step towards developing artiﬁcial vision
is to develop computational models of the RGCs in a biological
vision system that accurately replicate biological processing.
The standard approach to model RGCs is to use a
linear-nonlinear (LN) technique, which cascades a linear ﬁlter
module and a static nonlinear transformation module [4]. The
main advantage in using the LN technique with a single linear
ﬁlter is its ease of obtaining the model parameters, particularly
the shape of the linear ﬁlter [5]. However, this advantage arises
from a major constraint: the retina should be stimulated with a
radially symmetric stimulus, usually generated with Gaussian
white noise. Although white noise stimuli are mathematically
simple to analyse, it has been shown that they do not exercise
the full range of neuronal behaviour and any model developed
with this stimulus can emulate only a subset of responses from
a biological neuron [6]. These limitations necessitate the use of
natural visual stimuli to develop more realistic computational
models of RGCs. Natural visual stimuli have considerably
different statistical features in comparison to white noise
stimuli. For example, unlike the white noise stimuli, they
are not radially symmetric and have high cross-correlation
between nearby pixels [6]–[8]. Therefore, a more sophisticated
approach than the LN technique is required to accurately model
the visual processing taking place in an RGC under natural
viewing conditions.
An important characteristic observed from existing studies
[9] [10] and evident in the LN technique is the nonlinear
processing that takes place in an RGC. Machine learning
algorithms have proven very capable in modelling complex
nonlinear systems in other domains [11] [12]. In this paper,
we report on the development of computational models,
obtained using machine learning based regression algorithms,
of RGCs stimulated with static natural images in order to
predict the number of spikes elicited. In total, we explored
10 different machine learning approaches. Among these,
the extreme learning machine (ELM), Bayesian regularised
neural network (BRNN), support vector regression (SVR) and
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) regression approaches performed
better than others and their results are presented. Neuronal
recordings from electro-physiological experiments, in which
isolated salamander retinas are stimulated using static natural
images, are used to train these models. In order to compare the
performance of these machine learning models, LN models of
the RGCs were also developed. In these LN models, the linear
ﬁlters were estimated from the neuronal recordings from a
separate experiment with Gaussian white noise stimuli and the
static nonlinearities were then ﬁtted with the recordings from
the experiments with static natural image stimuli. Additional
modelling experiments were performed to investigate whether
adding more statistical features as inputs to the computational
models can improve the prediction.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section
II discusses existing studies related to the topic presented in
this paper. Details of the electro-physiological experimental
setup and various data pre-processing stages are discussed
in Section III. Results from the modelling experiments are
presented in Section IV. Section V concludes the paper and
explores possible future research directions.

RELATED WORKS
System identiﬁcation techniques, such as the Wiener
theory [13] and Wiener-Volterra method [14] were used
in
earlier
studies
to
develop
computational
models
of
visual processing in the retina. Owing to the increased
computational complexities of these approaches with higher
order kernels [15], the nonlinear auto-regressive moving
average with exogenous inputs (NARMAX), a parametric
system identiﬁcation technique, has been used to model
components of biological vision systems in more recent
studies [16][17]. Modular models in the form of cascaded or
parallel conﬁgurations have been used extensively to overcome
limitations of the Volterra-Wiener models. Although different
conﬁgurations of the modular models, such as linear-nonlinear
(LN) [4], nonlinear-linear (NL) [18] and linear-nonlinear-linear
(LNL) [19] exist, the LN technique with a single linear ﬁlter
module has been widely used, due to the ease of obtaining the
model parameters. An alternative to the system identiﬁcation
and modular methods is to use a machine learning based
nonparametric regression algorithm to model the nonlinear
visual processing taking place in the biological visual systems.
Although multi-layer feed-forward neural networks have been
used to model neurons in the visual cortex [20], few studies
have explored their performance in comparison to the standard
modelling techniques. This is one of the aspects addressed in
this paper.
Many of the existing studies involving modelling of
RGCs primarily focus on stimulation using white noise
visual stimulus [5][21]. While white noise and other random
patterned (e.g., moving gratings) visual stimuli enable the
cell type to be distinguished (e.g., ON-cells, OFF-cells,
ON-OFF cells, etc.) [22] and also speciﬁc functionalities (e.g.,
approaching motion detection cell, lateral motion detection
cell, directionally sensitive cell, etc.) [23], they do not test
the full range of neuronal behaviour [6]. It has been shown
that natural images are more effective in stimulating complex
cells in the primary visual cortex, while evoking low spike
time variability, than when using artiﬁcial random stimuli
[6] [15] [24]. This could be because our vision systems may
have been evolutionarily adapted to the natural visual stimuli;
furthermore natural image stimuli have considerably different
statistical features in comparison to the artiﬁcial visual stimuli.
For example, natural scenes have high spatial correlation,
and their intensity distribution has considerable skewness and
kurtosis [7] [8], which could have substantial inﬂuence on a
visual neuron’s response. However, only a limited number of
existing studies [18] have modelled the visual processing of
natural images by RGCs. Thus, the study presented in this
paper focuses speciﬁcally on developing computational models
of RGCs stimulated with natural images. The inﬂuence of
different statistical features of the stimuli on the neuronal
responses has also been evaluated, i.e., how the computational
model inputs are selected in order to improve their prediction
results.

ELECTRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
A. Experimental Setup
Neuronal

were
obtained
from
retinas
of
dark-adapted

axolotl
salamander
(Ambystoma
mexicanum) using in vitro electro-physiological experiments
[25].
The

ganglion-cell-side down on a planar multi-electrode array for
extracellular recordings. To visually stimulate the retina, the
screen of a gamma-corrected miniature organic light-emitting
diode (OLED) monitor was focussed onto the photoreceptor
layer of the retina. The stimulus screen was updated with a
frame rate of 60Hz. Action potentials were recorded from the
RGCs using the multi-electrode array, and were sampled at a
frequency of 10kHz.
Each trial with a natural image involved the stimulation
of the retina for 1000ms, in which the natural image was
displayed for 200ms followed by a full-ﬁeld gray image for
800ms (see Figure 1). The full-ﬁeld gray image helps the
ganglion cells to recover from any adaptation to the natural
image. In total, 300 natural images were used to stimulate
the retina and each image was repeated in 13 such trials to
observe the variations in the spiking behaviours. The spikes
recorded within a time period of 300ms from the onset of the
natural image to 100ms after the image is replaced with the
gray screen, allowing for the processing delay of the RGC, is
considered to be in response to the natural image.
In order to obtain the linear ﬁlter parameters for the LN
models, neural responses were recorded from the retina when
stimulated with a binary checker-board ﬂicker stimulus (a
spatio-temporal artiﬁcial stimulus, Figure 2). The stimulus
update rate in this experiment was different from that used
for the natural images experiments. The stimulus was updated
at a rate of 30Hz, meaning a new stimulus pattern was
presented approximately every 33.33ms. The recorded spikes
for this stimulus were binned at the stimulus rate, i.e., a
bin corresponds to a time period of 33.33ms. Data from
this experiment consisted of 64500 samples of stimulus and
corresponding binned spike recordings for a timespan of nearly
36 minutes.
B. Stimulus Pre-processing
Both visual stimuli (natural images and checker-board
ﬂickers) used to stimulate the retina vary spatially in light

intensity. Depending on the spatial arrangement of a pixel
(of the visual stimulus) in the receptive ﬁeld (RF) region of
an RGC, the effect of light intensity on the RGCs spiking
behaviour differs. This is usually a maximum at the centre
and reduces gradually as it moves towards the periphery of
the RF region. In order to emulate this, the local stimulus (the
area of the visual stimulus that falls within the RF region)
of each RGC is weighted using a 2D Gaussian ﬁlter (with a
support of 3σ). Two examples, one each for the natural image
stimulus and the checker-board ﬂicker stimulus, showing the
Gaussian weighting are presented in Figure 3.
IV.
MODELLING EXPERIMENTS
Computational models were developed to predict the rate of
spikes generated by the RGCs for each natural image stimulus.
The mean response from 13 repeated trials (spikes per trial) is
selected as the target spike rate for training the computational
models. The selection of input parameters to the computational
models is discussed in Section IV-A. Details of the modelling
techniques used for developing the computational models are
brieﬂy discussed in Section IV-B and the results from the
modelling experiments are discussed in Section IV-C.
A. Selection of Inputs to the Models
Natural images have considerably different statistical
features in comparison with artiﬁcial visual stimuli, which are
generally used to stimulate the retina in electro-physiological
experiments. From the Gaussian weighted local stimulus
different statistical features, namely the mean, standard
deviation, skewness and kurtosis, were extracted and their
correlation with the neuronal response was analysed to identify
the input parameters to the models. Only those RGCs with the
3σ RF region falling within the image boundary and having

rate (spikes/trial): (a) for Cell-14 with good correlation and (b) for Cell-15
with poor correlation. R2 values are also given as a measure of correlation.

elicited spikes for a majority of the images were selected for
modelling. A general consensus among existing studies on the
modelling of RGCs is that the spiking behaviour correlates
with the mean intensity or mean contrast. In our analysis,
the majority of the RGCs had substantial correlation between
mean intensity and neuronal spiking, while others had very
poor correlation. An example is shown in Figure 4 for two
randomly selected sample cells, Cell-14 with good correlation
(Figure 4(a)) and Cell-15 with poor correlation (Figure 4(b)).
Among the cells with good correlation between the mean
intensity and the spike rate, the local stimulus intensity
deviation also had good correlation with the spike rate. This
is shown in Figure 5 for Cell-14 and Cell-15. It was found
that the skewness and kurtosis, although quite different from
that observed in random artiﬁcial stimuli, had little correlation
with the neuronal spiking. The scatter plots showing this are
presented in Figure 6.
From this analysis, only the mean and standard deviation
of local stimulus intensity were identiﬁed to be important in
predicting the cell’s response. Only those cells that showed
good correlation between the local mean stimulus intensity
and the spike rate were selected for modelling. Two sets
of computational models were developed to check whether
including more input parameters would improve the overall
prediction performance. The ﬁrst set was developed with the
local mean stimulus intensity as the only input parameter to
the models. The second set was developed with the local mean
stimulus intensity and the local stimulus intensity deviation as
the input parameters to the models.

the points.
B. Modelling Techniques
The LN technique [5] to model an RGC separates the
model into a linear ﬁlter and a nonlinear function, which
are cascaded to estimate the spike rate corresponding to each
visual stimulus. The LN technique used here involves only
one linear ﬁlter, although multiple ﬁlters are possible [26]. The
shape of the linear ﬁlter is approximated by the spike triggered
average (STA) stimulus for the neuronal recording using the
Gaussian white noise checker-board ﬂicker stimulus. The STA
is deﬁned as the average stimulus preceding a spike in the cell.
This can be mathematically represented as:
STA =∑T
t=1
−−→
st (τ) ft
∑T
t=1 ft
(1)
where T is the total time period in which spikes were recorded,
−−→
st(τ) is the sequence of mean stimulus intensity (mean of the
Gaussian weighted local stimulus intensity, Figure 3(e)) from
time (t −τ) to time t, and ft is the number of spikes recorded
at time t. In this work, the value of τ was identiﬁed as 21 time
bins. The static nonlinearity is represented by a parameterised
form of a cumulative normal density function [5]. In order to
ﬁt this nonlinearity, the target spike rate was approximated by
the total number of spikes in a time bin.
The LN models were developed with only the local mean
stimulus intensity as input. Although not addressed here, two
options to include more than one input parameter are to have
the same number of linear ﬁlters as the number of input
parameters, and to combine the input parameters linearly or
nonlinearly to form a single parameter.
Machine learning based regression algorithms used here
include
ELM,
BRNN,
SVR
and
kNN
regression.
The
ELM [27] is based on single hidden layer feed-forward
networks. The back-propagation technique used for training
in feed-forward neural networks is replaced in the ELMs by
random assignment of weights of the hidden layer neurons
and analytical assignment of weights of the output layer
neurons to speed up the training process. The BRNN [28] is
a feed-forward neural network, which incorporates Bayesian
regularisation into the training process to reduce potential
overﬁtting and overtraining which commonly occur in the
back-propagation technique. The SVR [29] is an extension
of the popular support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer to
regression problems. In this, a complex nonlinear relationship

in the original space is transformed to a linear relationship
in a higher-dimensional feature space. In the kNN regression
algorithm [30], the value corresponding to an input is predicted
as the average of its closest k neighbours from the training
samples in a feature space. The parameters of the machine
learning models were estimated using ﬁve-fold cross validation
with ﬁve repeats.
C. Results
Among the 300 natural images, neuronal recordings for
150 images were selected for training the models, while
the neuronal recordings for the remaining 150 images were
used for testing. In order to compare the performance of
these models three metrics, namely root mean square error
(RMSE), coefﬁcient of determination (R2) and Kendall’s rank
correlation coefﬁcient (Tau) between the actual spike counts
observed in the electro-physiological experiments and the
model predictions, are used. Smaller values of RMSE, and
larger values of R2 and Tau are desired. Modelling results from
11 different RGCs are presented here. The maximum spike rate
from these RGCs are given in Table I, while they all had a
minimum spike rate of zero.
The ﬁrst set of models was developed with the local mean
stimulus intensity as the only input using the LN, ELM,
BRNN, SVR and kNN techniques. Performances of these
models for the test samples are compared using the three
metrics – RMSE in Table II, R2 in Table III and Kendall’s Tau
in Table IV. In general, it can be seen that the machine learning
models performed better than the LN technique in terms of
RMSE and R2, while the LN technique performed better
in terms of Kendall’s Tau for majority of the RGCs. From
these results, although the improvement in the performances
is marginal, it can be observed that the machine learning
algorithms provide a good alternative to the standard LN
technique in modelling RGCs stimulated with natural images.
The second set of models was developed with the mean
and standard deviation of the local stimulus intensity as the
input parameters. As the LN technique used in this work has
only one linear ﬁlter, the mean and standard deviations could
not be used simultaneously as inputs. As the machine learning
algorithms performed on par or marginally better for the ﬁrst
set of models, only these approaches were used to develop
the second set of models. Performances of these models for
the test samples of the same RGCs are compared using the
same three metrics - RMSE in Table V, R2 in Table VI
and Kendall’s Tau in Table VII. A comparison between the
corresponding metric comparison tables (RMSE in Tables II
and V, R2 in Tables III and VI, and Kendall’s Tau in Tables
IV and VII) shows that adding the local stimulus intensity
deviation as an additional input has not resulted in any major
improvement for majority of the modelled RGCs. This could
be because of the high correlation between the mean and the
standard deviation of local stimulus intensity (Figure 7). Due
to this, both these inputs could be feeding in similar and thus
redundant information to the models.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
Ganglion cells are the ﬁrst spiking neurons in the visual
pathway, and accurately modelling them is an important step
towards a reﬁned understanding of retinal functions in natural
visual environments and the development of a biologically
inspired artiﬁcial vision system. Most of the existing studies
that addressed this have used an artiﬁcial visual stimulus to
evoke spikes from the RGCs. As the artiﬁcial visual stimuli
have different statistical features and cannot generate the same
range of neuronal responses in comparison with the natural
image stimuli, realistic models of RGCs should be derived
from neuronal responses to natural image stimuli. This has
been addressed in the work presented by applying different
machine learning approaches to develop computational models
of RGCs, which have been stimulated with natural images.
From the results it can be seen that the machine learning
approaches provide a good alternative to the standard LN
technique in modelling RGCs. The modelling experiments
were performed in two stages. Initially the mean intensity of
the local stimulus region of each RGC was selected as the
input parameter to the models. Further modelling experiments
used the standard deviation of the local stimulus intensity as

an additional input parameter, which marginally improved the
prediction results for some RGCs.
There are many future directions to this research. An
obvious one is to move from static images to temporal
image sequence of natural images (movies). However, further
improvements could be made to the current models before
that - (i) by using a better estimate of the RF region and
(ii) by considering the lateral interconnections that could
affect the spiking behaviour. A contributing factor towards
the marginal performance improvements of the machine
learning models could be the crude approximation of the
RF region with 3σ support and then weighting it with
the 2D Gaussian. An alternative way to estimate the RF
region is given in [18]. However, further experiments are
necessary to compare these two methods. The modelling
experiments presented in this paper treat the neuronal spiking
behaviour of each cell individually. However, this is not
the case in a biological system. There are many lateral
interconnections in the retina through horizontal and amacrine
cells that could result in an excitatory or inhibitory effect
on nearby RGCs [31] and could be more evident for a
natural image stimulus. Further modelling experiments are

necessary to include such spatio-temporal correlations into
the RGC models. Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to identify a
single machine learning approach that works for all RGCs.
Depending on the type of the RGC (e.g., approach motion
detection, lateral motion detection, etc.), the features in the
image that stimulate the cell vary and a machine learning
algorithm may perform best for a speciﬁc type of RGC. In
future modelling experiments, we will also be looking into
this.
