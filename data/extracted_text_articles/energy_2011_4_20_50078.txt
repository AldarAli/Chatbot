Abstract—We analyze the power consumption of  several IT 
devices placed in a research center affiliated to our University. 
The data collection lasted about one year and the analysis let 
us identify: i) the average instant power consumption of each 
type of device ii) trends of the instant power consumption 
curves  iii)  usage  profiles  and  their  power  consumption  iv) 
energy savings obtained from a different use of resources. Our 
main finding is that software and usage typology could affect 
power consumption more than hardware.

INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK
Over the years, the use of Information Technology has 
exploded  and  IT  has  also  contributed  to  environmental 
issues:  the  total  electricity  consumption  by  servers, 
computers, monitors, data communication equipment, etc. is 
increasing steadily [5]. According to [3], the ICT sector is 
responsible  for  a  value  between  2%  and  10%  of  the 
worldwide energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to 
improve  awareness  in  the  IT  industry  with  regard  to 
environmental  problems,  and  this  aspect  should  be 
considered  by  the  academic  point  of  view  [6]:  in  fact, 
“turning on research universities into living laboratories of 
the greener future” [8], will permit to quickly develop best 
practices and to make them available to industry and society 
in general. As an example we cite the work of Chiaraviglio et 
al. [1]: they applied a fully automatic measurement that is 
able to scale and track the number of devices powered on in 
real  time.  This technique has been  applied  at  our  same 
university, Politecnico di Torino. They created PoliSave, a 
software to turn on/off a PC by connecting directly to a 
website. PoliSave is being extended to all PC in the Campus, 
with the goal of saving about 250,000 € per year from the 
University energy bill. The study we present here is instead 
focused on the analysis of power consumption data, and it is 
designed to find out usage patterns of IT devices' energy 
consumption and to identify situations in which there is a 
waste of energy. Pinckard and Busch [2] also collected data 
on  devices,  focusing  on  the  after-hours  power  state  of 
networked devices in office buildings: they showed that most 
of devices are left powered on during night, concluding that 
this is the first cause of energy waste. Usage analysis is a 
crucial step to optimize the energy consumption: this task is 
even more necessary within data centers where the number 
of computers is large. In this field, Bein et al. [4] tried to 
improve the energy efficiency of data centers: they studied 
the cost of storing vast amounts of data on the servers in a 
data center and they proposed a cost measure together with 
an algorithm that minimizes such cost.
In our analysis the number of pc is lower, but we observe 
data from a real case. The paper is structured as follows: in 
the following section, the context of our work, including 
instrumentation and research questions, is described, section 
III  presents  results  and,  finally,  section  IV  provides 
conclusions and future work.
II.
CONTEXT OF THE ANALYSIS
One of the strategic goals of Politecnico di Torino is the 
green  footprint  cutting  and  related  costs  reduction. 
Managers know that whenever a change is needed, the first 
step is to figure out the current scenario in a quantitative 
way, that means to measure [7]. Starting from the indicators, 
it is then possible to find solutions, improve results and solve 
problems. Therefore, several measures should be present on 
the dashboard of the green power manager, one of them is 
the electrical power consumption of devices: for this reason, 
our  University  decided  to  install  in  several  departments 
sensors to monitor the power consumption of rooms, lighting 
and conditioning systems, data elaboration centers and single 
IT devices  such as servers,  printers,  switches.  We were 
involved  in  the  measurement  process  of  such data  in  a 
research center affiliate to Politecnico di Torino, the Istituto 
Superiore Mario Boella (ISMB), and we present in this paper 
data collected and some facts found. 
A.
Instrumentation
The  measurement  of  power  consumption  was  done 
through a power monitoring system provided by an industrial 
partner. The system is composed by sensors inserted between 
the monitored devices and the electrical plugs to which they 
are  plugged  in.  For  entire  sections  of  lighting  and 
conditioning systems, instead, the sensor is applied directly 
on the conductor through a pincer. Both type of sensors can 
compute  active  and  reactive  power,  voltage,  current 
intensity, cos φ, with a desired sampling time (we selected 
ten minutes). Data collected by sensors are sent to a bridge 
through  ZigBee,  then  the  bridge  forwards  the  data  via 
Ethernet/Internet  to  the  central  servers.  Data  are  then 
accessible  on  a  web  portal  and  can  be  exported  to  be 
analyzed. We monitor the active power consumption on the 
following devices of the ISMB research center:

•
Three distinct servers:
−
Server  1  (from  22nd April  2010  to  23rd 
November 2010)
−
Server  2  (from  22nd April  2010  to  23rd 
November 2010)
−
Server  3   (from  7th  May  2010   to  23rd 
November 2010) 
•
A printer (from 5th March 2010 to 23rd November 
2010)
•
The conditioning system “CED1”, that is cooling 
the room where Server 1 and 2 are located (from 
23rd November 2009 to 23rd November 2010)
•
The lighting system in Server 3 Room (from 24th 
November 2009 to 23rd November 2010)
We list in Table I the characteristics of the three servers. 
Server 1 and Server 2 are both used as web servers: they host 
web  sites  of  research  projects,  where  researchers  share 
documents and files. Server 3 instead is used both as web 
server and to perform graphical operations. The printer is HP 
Laserjet  P3005dn , with an operational power supply of 
600W and standby consumption of 9W. Unfortunately we do 
not  have  information  on  the  conditioning  and  lighting 
system. Finally, we define “instant power consumption” the 
average power consumption consumed in the sampling unit 
time (ten minutes).
B.
Research questions
Eight different  research questions drive data analysis. 
Firstly we have a group of questions (Overview) that is very 
general, and aims at discovering what is the actual average 
instant power consumption of the equipment in the ISMB 
research center, that we suppose being the typical equipment 
of similar centers. Overview questions are listed below: 
1.
What is the average instant power consumption of 
the servers in the last year?
2.
What is the average instant power consumption of 
the printer in the last year?
3.
What is the average instant power consumption of 
the  other  equipment  (light,  conditioning)?
After  that,  we  focus  our  analysis  on  the  power 
consumption  of  servers,  because  we  can  reduce  their 
consumption only understanding how and how much  they 
consume. The first question that is raised up is whether the 
power consumption of the three servers is the same or not:
4.
Are there differences between the servers instant 
power consumptions?
Assuming, from the exploratory data analysis, that the 
power consumption in the studied context is not following 
any  well-known  distribution,  we  answer  question  5 
performing  the  Wilcoxon  Two  Sample  test  [9].  The 
difference we try to find with this question is an inter-server 
difference: the next step is to explore the aspects related to 
the  progress  of  the  single  servers'  power  consumptions. 
Initially, we investigate whether the power consumption is 
homogeneous or variant:
5.
Are there any peaks in instant power consumption 
or is it homogeneous? If so, how long do they last? 
Are  they  relevant,  in  terms  of  power  values?
We answer to this question in a qualitative way, i.e. 
plotting  for  each  server  2  different  graphs:  the  power 
consumption over time and the estimated probability density. 
The first plot let us identify the presence of peaks and trends 
in the observed time window, whilst the latter permits to see 
if power consumption accumulated by peaks is relevant, 
looking to the frequency of the values associated to the 
peaks.  Peaks  represent  a  rapid  growth  or  decrease,  or 
deviations from a normal behavior. However, a server could 
have  several  behaviors  in  terms  of  power  consumption, 
associated for example to a different load or a particular 
software or hardware configuration. Therefore the scope of 
the next question is to understand the existence of different 
power consumption “behaviors”, that we call “profiles”.
6.
Can  we  identify  different  usage  profiles  (e.g. 
active/standby)?
We perform a cluster analysis to answer question 7. We 
use the K-Means algorithm [10] and the bivariate plots, 
obtained through normalization and rescaling of the variables 
(watt-time couples). The selected clustering algorithm aims 
to group and find aggregations of data around certain values 
called  “centers”,  which  could  point  out  different  power 
consumption  “profiles”  and  relationships  between  the 
variables  (for  instance,  a  typical  profile  in  common 
computers is the standby profile).

The plots let us visualize and verify the clusters found. If 
profiles are found,  it is also important to verify if they 
correspond  to  daily/nightly  activities,  relating,  for  each 
server, the progress of power consumption with time tables 
of  human  activities  in ISMB.  Hence,  we  plot,  for  each 
server, the power consumption in a whole day, selecting for 
each week of the last 3 months a random day between 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (we avoid  week ends, 
Mondays and Fridays because typically in these days human 
activities are not representative of the typical work-day). 
Observing the 12 plots obtained and interviewing people 
working in the center, we are able to identify the time range 
in which the majority of activities on all the 3 servers is 
carried out, that is between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. At this point, it 
is possible to divide data in daily and nightly consumption, 
and then compare the two subsets, using Wilcoxon Two 
Sample test, since data is not normally distributed. 
Moreover, we are interested in pointing out the power 
consumption of each profile, in order to understand how 
much energy is saved/lost by applying the configurations and 
conditions that determine the different power profiles. This is 
done by tagging each observation with the profile it belongs 
to  and  then  summing  up  the  cumulated  consumption. 
Therefore, the research question is:
7.
How much total energy did servers consume in the 
last year in the different profiles?
Finally, the same question is replicated to the printer, that 
has two well-known profiles: an active profile when it is 
printing,  and  a  stand-by  profile  when  it  is  not.  
8.
How much energy can we save by turning off the 
printer when it doesn't work?
All  questions  are  about  power,  and  related  data  are 
expressed in Watt (W), exception given for RQ 7-8 that 
measure energy (KWh).
C.
Threats to validity
The first threat of this research is an external threat: the 
analysis is performed on specific machines, thus generalizing 
these results is not possible. However, it can be possible to 
look at this equipment as representative of a category of 
equipments with similar characteristics. 
Further, a derived internal threat is that the information 
on the technical characteristics of the IT equipment (printer, 
servers) and on their usage (massive, constant, etc) could be 
not enough to deeply motivate all the curves of the power 
consumption  analyzed  and  determine  with  precision  the 
impact on the measures. Therefore, the causes that we derive 
from the observation, can be biased.  
Finally, we also identify a conclusion threat determined 
by the sampling time (ten minutes): as a consequence we 
have average values even for instant power consumption 
measures, and we could miss some fluctuations.  
III.
ANALYSIS RESULTS
A.
Overview(RQ1 to RQ3)
We provide on Table II two descriptive statistics about 
RQ1 to RQ4: the average instant power consumption and the 
index of dispersion that quantifies how much data is sparse 
around the mean.
B.
Servers (RQ4 to RQ7)
RQ4: Are there differences between the servers instant 
power consumptions?
We observe in Table III that power consumptions of 
Server 1 is very different from the consumptions of Server 2 
and 3. However, Server 2 and 3, even if similar in mean 
values  (difference  is  only  8  Watts),  have  statistically 
different mean power consumptions.
RQ5: Are there any peaks in instant power consumption 
or is it homogeneous? If so, how long do they last? Are they 
relevant, in terms of power values?
Looking  to the  time  plots, we  observe  for  Server  1 
(Figure 1) many high spikes (that reach values that are more 
than the 50% of the mean), two low spikes and frequent 
switches between low and high values. However, the index 
of dispersion (see Table II) is reduced, that means that the 
time duration of the peaks is short. For Server 2 (Figure 2), 
data is more concentrated around the mean value, and the 
peaks (3 low spikes and a dozen of high peaks) lasts for short 
periods of time (but longer than Server 1,  as the index of 
dispersion suggests).

Instant power consumption over time (Server 1)

Instant power consumption over time (Server 1)
Figure 3. 
Instant power consumption over time (Server 3)
  Finally, for Server 3 (Figure 3) the situation is yet 
different: it has a higher consumption and many high peaks 
until the end of August, then lower power consumption and 
peaks  starting from  September  2010. The change  in the 
curve has a motivation: the server  was used to perform 
continuous  intensive  tasks  as  image  processing,  parallel 
coding  and  massive  video/audio  streaming  until  end  of 
August. Then, it was used as a normal web server, as Server 
1 and Server 2.
The variability of data has also the same behavior: higher 
until September, then reduced. Moreover, there is a very 
long period (about 20 days) of zero power consumption (it 
was powered down), followed by 4 other smaller periods of 
zero consumption. 
Plotting instead the probability density estimation of the 
servers'  power  consumptions,  we  can  see  around  which 
values data is concentrated, and so if peaks are relevant both 
in  terms  of  power  consumption  and  duration.  Server  1 
(Figure 4) has 3 main concentrations of data: the highest is 
around the mean value (~108 W), then there is a similar peak 
at about 112 W and a lower one in their middle, finally two 
very  low  peaks  at  the  two  extremes  of  the  graph.  We 
conclude that peaks of Server 1 are relevant in terms of 
duration, but not in terms of variation from the mean value. 
The probability function of Server 2 (Figure 5) is totally 
different: data is concentrated around the mean value, and 
the distribution is very similar to a normal distribution with 
very low variance. The higher index of dispersion is due to 
the small peak toward the 10W and the other one on the right 
of  the  mean.  We  observe  that  peaks  for  Server  2  are 
irrelevant in terms of duration, but some are  quite far from 
the mean. Finally, we observe Server 3 in Figure 6: except 
the peak around the mean, the 2 big peaks (~0 W and ~160 
W) have high probabilities, whilst the small peak on the right 
is quite far from the mean. As a consequence, spikes of 
Server  3  are  relevant  both  for  time  length  and  power 
consumption. This concludes the answer of RQ6.
RQ7:  Can  we  identify  different  usage  profiles  (e.g. 
active/standby)?
We obtain from the K-Means algorithm 5 clusters for 
Server 1, 4 clusters for Server 2 and 4 Clusters for  Server 3. 
The centers of the clusters are the following, in increasing 
order of power (W) : 
•
Server 1: 8.36, 105.23, 106.97, 109.44, 110.47
•
Server 2: 14.64, 146.44, 146.68, 149.22
•
Server 3: 2.80, 154.51, 160.56, 246.81
We can surely identify a “low power profile” for all the 
servers  (the  lowest-value  center).  Instead  active  profiles 
could be more than one, especially for Server 1 (data varies 
from 105 to 110 W) and Server 3 (where the difference is 
clear, since values go from 154 to 246 W). For this reason, 
we perform a further cluster analysis (Figure 7), focused just 
on the active profile, that allow us to gain more information. 
We find the following centers: 
•
Server  1:  104.93,  105.21,  105.92,  109.76, 
111.10, 138.61
•
Server 2:  146.46 , 146.63, 185.10 
•
Server 3 : 154.27, 160.64, 245.87

Figure 6. 
Probability density function estimation  (Server 3)
Reducing to significant values, we can identify for all the 
servers at least two different high power profiles and a low 
power profile: we show values in Table IV . Subsequently, 
we  investigate  whether  the two high  power  profiles  are 
related  to  the  day/night  human  activities.  Even  if  the 
Wilcoxon statistical tests (Table V) verifies the difference 
between  daily  and  nightly  power  consumption  with  the 
standard level of confidence of 95%, this difference is in 
practice negligible, since it's in the order of μW for Server 1 
and Server 2 and it is less then 1 W for Server 3. 
RQ8: How much total energy did servers consume in 
the last year in the different profiles?
The estimated cumulated energy consumption of servers 
in the different power profiles is shown in column “kWh” of 
Table VI, whilst the column “%” shows the percentage of 
each cumulated power with respect to the total. 
C.
Printer (RQ8)
RQ9: How much energy can we save by turning off the
printer when it doesn't work?
This is the overall data of the energy consumption of the 
printer in the Active – Standby profiles:
•
Active: 
11.93 kWh 
•
Standby: 
21.29 kWh
The difference is important indeed, 2/3 of energy are 
used (wasted) in the standby mode.

IV.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We analyzed the power consumption in the last months 
of the equipment in the research center ISMB, affiliated to 
our  University.  We  monitored  at  high  level  data  about 
conditioning and lighting systems and general devices and 
we conducted a more detailed analysis on the servers and the 
printer.  We  draw  from  the  statistical  analysis  and  the 
answers of the research questions the following facts, and 
related further questions for future work.
Servers
Fact  1. We  found  differences  between  the  power 
consumptions of the three servers (RQ4), likely determined 
by software  usage,  not  by hardware  equipment. In  fact, 
despite Server 1 has a more powerful hardware equipment 
(CPU, memory),  it has the lowest power consumption. 
Fact  2.  The  power  consumption  of  servers  is  not 
homogeneous over time (RQ5). 
There  are  several  peaks.  Peaks  are  determined  by 
software usage: as a matter of fact, Server 3 consumes up to 
75% more when it is used for graphical operations.
Fact  3.  Servers  have  different  power  consumption 
profiles (RQ7).  This is determined by software usage.
Fact 4. Conditioning and lighting for servers consume 
more  than  computation  (especially  conditioning,  that 
consumes approximately ten times more) (RQ3).
Fact 5. Low power profile (or Stand-by) for servers is 
useless (< 1%) (RQ7). 
Fact 6. There is no substantial difference between day 
and night servers' power consumption (RQ7).
Printer
Fact 7. The printer consumed more energy  in standby 
mode than in active mode (RQ9). 
Indeed, in our analysis, with a mechanism able to turn off 
the printer when it doesn't work, 21 kWh would have been 
saved in the period March-November 2010, which is the 
64% of the printer's total power consumption in that time 
range. Or, alternatively, shutting down the printer during 
night, it is possible to save the standby power consumption 
(13 W, despite the 9W declared in the technical sheet), that 
means to save 47.45 KWh per year.
Even if this analysis is very initial, and specific to few 
machines  that  may  not  be  representative  of  the  whole 
population, we believe it points out some simple checks that 
every energy manager should do as a first step to reduce 
energy  consumption:  consumption  of  conditioners  and 
lighting, consumptions of printers in idle mode, consumption 
of servers both over day and night. Moreover, data we have 
presented could be compared to other analysis on equipment 
with similar characteristics.
Future work will be devoted to understand more the 
reasons of the behaviors observed. Notably to investigate 
deeper the motivations of the differences of servers power 
consumptions, and to verify them experimentally by setting 
up different  configurations/conditions in the  machines  to 
evaluate their impact on power consumption. Secondly, we 
will repeat the same analysis on the Data Elaboration Center 
of our university, and we will compare it with the data 
presented in this paper. We think that the research questions 
that drove this analysis could be adopted and answered by 
other  researchers  in  different  universities  and  centers: 
building up a common benchmark of power consumption, it 
is possible to identify common and efficient solutions that 
can be then exported in industry and society.
