Abstract—The expectation of people and futurists is that all
respectable cities will become Smart Cities in the near future.
Two main barriers stand in the way of the evolution of cities.
First is cost, the transformation into a smart city is expensive
(e.g., between $30 Million and $40 Billion) and only a few cities
are able to obtain the resources required for upgrades. Second,
many citizens equate the data collection and surveillance of smart
city technology with aggressive infringements on privacy. In this
paper, we describe how citizens, city planners, and companies
can develop smart cities that do not require crippling loans and
are respectful of privacy.
Keywords–smart city; privacy; networks.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Ubiquitous technology has long been an expectation of the
21st century. Recently, the concept of a Smart City has led
cities, developers, and citizens to pursue idyllic improvements
to municipal infrastructure. Smart city designs tend to require
Internet of Things (IoT) devices to be connected in order
to retrieve the data generated by the devices. Unfortunately,
signiﬁcant costs are incurred when deploying sensors equipped
with 5G or WiFi connectivity due to data subscription fees
[1] [2]. As the number of cities that want to become “smart”
increases, innovative ways of transforming a conventional city
into a smart city need to be investigated. Aspiring smart cities
are predicated on the belief that socioeconomic impact will
yield a return on investment for smart cities, but ﬁnanciers
have been apprehensive [3].
While innovations in technology continue, citizens are
critical about how unvetted smart cities can violate intrinsic
rights [4]. People are inventing methods to disguise themselves
from surveillance systems using fashionable masks [5]. Citi-
zens also depend on other products to curtain themselves from
other devices, such as smart speakers [6] [7]. However, laws
are consistently being passed to ensure the responsibility of the
city or company protects the privacy of the citizens [8] [9].
In remainder of this paper, we introduce and discuss the
concepts of low-cost and privacy-enabled smart cities. In
Section 2, we focus on deﬁning what a smart city is and
the requests of the top seven applicants that were apart of
the 2015 Smart City Challenge [10]. In Section 3, we discuss
the large monetary costs smart cities have invested to become
“smart” along with some opinions on how to reduce cost. In
Section 4, we discuss the infringements of privacy that smart
cities produce and then, we propose innovative ways cities can
protect their citizens. Lastly, we conclude by summarizing the
insights and future direction of this research.
II.
HOW CAN A CITY BECOME “SMART”?
Establishing what technologies create a smart city can
include many intricate components. To deﬁne the essence of
a Smart City, we start by establishing the basic universal
technologies that all smart cities require. In 2015, the United
States Department of Transportation announced the Smart
City Challenge which asked cities in America to create an
integrated, smart, and efﬁcient transportation system built on
data, applications, and technology in an effort improve the
lives of its citizens [10]. Figure 1 displays U.S. cities that are
currently smart cities or are interested in becoming “smart”
(the circle area denotes the population size). Of these, the
Smart City Challenge received 78 applicants describing what
a smart city looked like for their community.
Figure 1. Current and potential smart city locations in the United States.
The list of technologies have been derived from the top
seven applications from the Smart City Challenge. From this
challenge, the seven cities were chosen as ﬁnalist include:
Columbus (Ohio), Austin (Texas), Denver (Colorado), Kansas
City (Missouri), Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), Portland (Oregon),
and San Francisco (California). Following this competition,
these ﬁnalist serve as a foundation for cities hoping to be-
come smarter. These cities request several technologies and
components, such as:
•
Electric vehicle charging stations
•
Electric/autonomous public transportation vehicles
•
Connected vehicles using a smart grid
•
User mobile applications
•
Trafﬁc signaling priority
To integrate these technologies, the cities use sensors, video,
Global Positioning Systems (GPS), and radio signals from

pedestrians, vehicles, and equipment. These cities also use
these video and GPS feeds for license plate recognition and to
track crime related incidents. The goal of becoming a smarter
city revolves around connecting under-served communities
to opportunities, decreasing health disparities, reducing air
pollution, and increasing the mobility of citizens by relieving
congestion of roadways.
Assisting low socioeconomic and disabled citizens has
risen to the forefront of smart city development strategies. In
an effort to make these advancements more inclusive of those
communities, the smart cities have proposed the use of:
•
Smart kiosks enable advanced payment options by
incorporating additional features, such as braille and
voice feedback
•
Electronic signs provide visual and audio cues to
pedestrians
•
Autonomous car sharing allows commuters ﬁrst and
last mile transportation with a reduction in costs
•
Information screens provide real-time transportation
updates through audio and video
With the incorporation of these additional technologies, we see
these cities become more inclusive and smarter for all. On top
of an already costly smart city, these specialized technologies
raise an additional cost along with continually maintaining all
aspects of these technologies.
III.
LOW-COST SMART CITIES
Smart City projects can be extremely expensive to deploy
and manage. Cities around the world such as San Diego, New
Orleans, London, and Songdo have either proposed or invested
in Smart City projects that cost between $30 Million and $40
Billion. In addition to the cost of deploying and maintaining
the IoT devices themselves, a signiﬁcant portion of the expense
is a result of providing Internet connectivity via 5G or WiFi to
those devices. These costs are a major barrier to the widespread
deployment of Smart City technology and the social beneﬁts
that may ensue from that technology [11].
To alleviate the costs, opportunistic communication, such
as Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) can be used as a backbone
for Smart City communication to facilitate data that does not
have real-time Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. DTNs
traditionally provide opportunistic networking connections in
areas with little to no infrastructure. Messages are delivered
with some delay which is directly correlated with the layout,
density, and mobility of nodes in the network [12] [13]. Recog-
nizing that some data are needed in real-time, edge-computing
can be utilized as long as the placement of internet-connected
nodes are optimized in the network. For data that can tolerate
delays, the natural movement of people and vehicles through
a city to transfer data between nodes. In this way, the citizens
become an integral part of the smart city network itself.
In order for low-cost Smart Cities to ﬂourish and DTNs
as backbone to be practical, both the technology questions
related to the devices and the network itself, as well the social
aspects of how people and vehicles move through a city must
be addressed. For almost 20 years there has been a substantial
amount of research in opportunistic communications and delay
tolerant networks; unfortunately real-world deployments tradi-
tionally fall short of their simulated counterparts [14]. Related
efforts, [13], [15]–[22], have proven the ability to deliver
messages when connections are intermittent, but generally are
limited to performing within simulation environments [23].
IV.
PRIVACY-ENABLED SMART CITIES
With the use of smart city technologies, how does a
city ensure privacy and security for its citizens? Cities will
become a 24 hour hub for collecting information about the
mobility and efﬁciency of transportation, but also personally
identifying information of its’ travellers [24]. In the Smart
City Challenge [10], the applicants describe the possible risks
and mitigation strategies with the deployment of these cities.
From these concerns, we focus on the risks associated with the
citizens in those environments. The main concerns for smart
city citizens revolve around data sharing, individual privacy,
system security, data privacy, and data management. In Table I,
we explore each smart city and if these smart city risks will
be addressed in the development of their city.

Each city (rows) either discusses (√) or does not mention
(–) the privacy risk of a technology (columns). Data sharing
and data privacy concerns are addressed by the majority (4
of 7) of the cities. Individual privacy, system security, and
data management are each addressed by three of the cities. In
Table II, we reviewed these Smart City proposals and assessed
a score based on a Likert Scale (Excellent, Average, Poor)
from these ﬁve categories (Data Sharing, Individual Privacy,
System Security, Data Privacy, & Data Management). From
the proposal and discussion, a city will receive:
•
Excellent: The proposal has thorough discussion about
the risks and mitigation strategies related to topic and
a solid plan of action.
•
Average: The proposal has moderate to little discus-
sion about the risks and mitigation strategies related
to topic and a general plan of action.
•
Poor: The proposal has little to no discussion about
the risks and mitigation strategies related to topic and
no plan of action.
Columbus is the only city without a risk analysis in their
proposal. This city will develop their plan during the imple-
mentation of their city, but would this be enough? Immediately
after winning, Columbus created the Smart City Program
Ofﬁce to assess possible risks and mitigate them. Of the
ﬁnalists, none of these cities provide a detailed description

of the protection they will provide their citizens in their
proposals. To mitigate the proposed risks these cities seek to:
(1) implement standards from government and industry, (2)
anonymize or mask sensitive personal data, and (3) partner
with cyber-security experts and government.

Beyond security breaches and attacks, what protection will
these cities use to ensure the privacy of those who want to
remain anonymous in an “always on” city? Researchers have
investigated the concerns of privacy leaks and the types of
privacy leaks on social media [25]. These privacy leak concerns
can be expected in a smart city where citizens are contin-
ually being monitored. To help cities protect their citizens,
we propose the use of a visual mitigation library used for
videos and images based on existing literature [26]. This work
provides a foundation for several mitigation techniques used
for social media networks, however these same technologies
can be implemented to protect the citizens from surveillance
concerns and privacy issues. Beyond the citizen’s concern for
anonymity or protection of minors, there is a concern for the
type of information that is leaked in a public setting.
A. ViperLib: Mitigation Library
We seek to expand this work as a foundation for the
need of mitigation techniques in video surveillance. Everyday
people purchase items with their credit or debit cards, carry
identiﬁcation, or use keys (virtual and physical passcodes).
This type of sensitive content will be captured in those videos
and image feeds [27] [28], with the use of a redaction spectrum
we can ensure that content will not be leaked to others. Studies
have shown that the use of obfuscation methods [29]–[31] can
protect individual privacy.
To address this concern, we suggested the deployment of
the ViperLib. This mitigation library will allow the Smart
Cities to choose how and where they want to integrate this
technology. As proposed by [26], mitigation techniques can be
integrated into mobile applications, servers, IoT devices, and
comprehensive systems. Techniques, such as obfuscation (e.g.,
adversarial noise, blurring, blocking), interception, and blind
vision can be integrated into this library easily ready for use.
The library can also facilitate active engagement strategies for
alerting authorized personnel about pertinent privacy concerns
and suggesting the possible mitigation strategies for that visual
content. These types of alerting strategies are similar to Chap-
erone Bot or Privacy Patrol from previous works [26]. The
ViperLib open-source library can be integrated into existing
“off-the-shelf” packages. Citizens can select the privacy pro-
tection features that must be integrated into deployed systems.
Such libraries can provide safety, security, and peace of mind
to the citizens that reside in those areas.
V.
CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
In summary, this paper argued that Smart Cities have the
capability to be both private and inexpensive in deployment
and for long term sustainability. During planning and imple-
mentation of these cities, ofﬁcials along with citizens should
further consider the high cost and privacy concerns associ-
ated with their development choices. The need for privacy
mitigation in Smart Cities extends from the protection of
personally identifying information to the choice of anonymity
and protect of minors. Beyond the deployment of the ViperLib,
we proposed the use of DTNs to lower the cost of Smart
Cities and allow citizens assist the in the transmission of
data across the city. Deploying traditional IoT infrastructure
is prohibitively expensive for most cities and expanded de-
velopments introduces privacy risks. However, low-cost smart
cities and privacy-enabled technologies can achieve the goals
of smart cities while allowing citizens to feel secure and
protected.
Future research considers the potential effects of security
for cyber-physical systems in real IoT deployments. To do this,
we will collaborate with Louisville, Kentucky, a Smart City
Applicant, to discuss future strategies and deployment plans
for ViperLib as part of NSF Grant (#1952181).
