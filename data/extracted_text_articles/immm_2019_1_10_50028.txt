Abstract—This study aims to examine the effect of integrated
in-store and online experiential marketing on customer brand
identification and purchase intention. This study selects the
international fast fashion brand ZARA as the main research
object, mainly because ZARA is a major international clothing
retailer and pioneer of fast fashion principles which is very
popular among young ethnic groups in Taiwan. Different from
local clothing brands, most of which either sell via online stores
or brick-and-mortar stores, ZARA has successfully promoted
online marketing in Taiwan, and still invests in physical stores
to create an experience atmosphere. This study believes that
fast fashion brands, such as ZARA, can provide high service
quality by integrating virtual and real experiential marketing,
which shall enable consumers to generate experiential value
and brand identity, and hence to enhance customers’ purchase
intention of their products. The main target customers of these
international fast fashion brands are young people, both online
and offline. When most fast fashion brands are quite successful
at online sales, why do they still open physical stores as luxury
brands?
Research
results
show
that
physical
store
management can help to improve the customer relationship
and hence has positive effect on brand identification and
purchase intention.
Keywords- Experiential marketing; Internet communication;
Brand identification; Customer intention; Fast fashion.

INTRODUCTION
There are four international apparel retailing chains
popular in Taiwan among young adults, namely, ZARA,
Uniqlo, H&M, and GAP. These so-called fast fashion brands
have revolutionized the fashion industry by following a
strategy known as fast fashion, democratizing couture and
bringing trendy, affordable items to the masses, especially to
the Internet generations of young adults and teenagers.
Therefore, these international brands are quite successful in
online sales. In Taiwan, all of these clothing brands have
both physical and online stores. One might ask why would
these fast fashion chains set up physical stores like high-
priced clothing brands? All of the four major brands have
opened physical stores in big cities in Taiwan. While young
customers tend to choose the cheaper products among
similar styles, they also favor higher quality. One of the
differences between virtual and physical stores is that online
stores can offer cheap products and special discounts to
entice customers to buy. On the other hand, for the physical
stores, in addition to completely delivering the style and
concept of the brand and the goods, they provide customers
more services with the brand’s specific shopping atmosphere
and experiences. Therefore, it raises the question: can
integrating real and virtual sales establish a stronger and
better relationship with consumers?
While online shopping is growing, it is difficult to
completely present the style and the corresponding concepts
of the brand and its products to the customers. The problem
can be resolved in the physical stores by providing more
services, store atmosphere and shopping experience to
consumers. Therefore, this study aims to examine if the
physical stores can strengthen the quality of online store
communication, and if integrating real and virtual sales can
establish a stronger relationship with consumers and better
relationship quality. To this end, this study takes the
international fast fashion chain ZARA as the research object,
and tries to understand if clothing quality can improve the
quality of relationships with customers, if the experience
marketing of physical stores can improve the quality of
relationships with young consumers, and if the store
atmosphere of a physical store can improve the quality of
relationships with young consumers.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, we present the literature review. In Section III, we
describe
our
research
method.
The
experiment
and
discussion are shown in Section IV. Finally, the conclusion
and ideas for future work are presented in Section V.

LITERATURE REVIEW
This study focuses on issues such as service quality, store
atmosphere, brand identification, experiential marketing,
experiential value, purchase intention, customer satisfaction,
and Internet communication quality.
A. Service Quality
Services consist of a series of processes and activities.
Services possess three well documented characteristics,
namely,
intangibility,
heterogeneity,
and
inseparability.
Services and consumption occur and exist simultaneously.
Customers feel the service in the process of interactions, and
the service quality is the subjective perception of consumers
[1]. Customers perceive the service through the overall
perception of the overall quality of the services. When the
services
are
provided,
whether
these
services
meet
consumers’ perceptions and expectations will critically
influence their repurchase intention [2][3]. However, it could
be difficult for a firm to understand how the customers
perceive services and service quality.
Nowadays, consumers are demanding increasingly higher
service quality. When they are provided the services, they
have expectations. If the consumers feel that their demands
are satisfied and respected, they will think about buying the
products. Moreover, if they feel that the products or services
are satisfactory during the purchasing process, they would
have the idea of repurchase or recommending it to friends
and relatives. In addition, if the service does not provide
what the customers wants, one will have to let the customer
feel satisfied during the waiting process [4].
Many researchers have discussed the service quality
dimensions. Juran proposed dimensions for service quality,
such as internal quality, hardware quality, software quality,
timely
response,
psychological
quality
[5].
Zeithaml,
Parasuram and Berry proposed a service quality model based
on tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and
empathy [6].
To improve the service quality, ZARA tries to give warm
and professional assistance to the consumers and to quickly
respond to customers’ preference on the product.
To this
end, ZARA takes a different selling approach than the
traditional ways by introducing the Self-Service Check Out
Technology that links the online and offline experiences
together and create more value for their customers.
B. Store Atmosphere
Kotler et al. [7] have shown that elaborately designed
shopping environments could trigger certain emotions and
further increase customers’ purchase intention. According to
Kotler, the sensory channels for atmosphere are sight, sound,
scent and touch [8]. Taking these channels into account for
the design of the stores could establish some specific
atmosphere, which would create some physical as well as
psychological experience to the customers, and very likely
impact their buying decision [9]. To understand how
consumers choose products, one must take both "personal
factors" and "situational factors" into consideration, and
"situational factors" tend to be more critical than "personal
factors" [10][11]. Since the service is intangible, the
customer will assess its quality based on some of the most
common clues: the store's physical environment design,
furnishings, lighting, sound effects, interaction with the
service personnel, etc. Berman and Evans [12] categorize the
store’s atmosphere into five different kinds: (1) external
environment: awnings, display windows, buildings, parking
lots; (2) general indoor environment: floor plan, color,
sound, lighting, smell, temperature, cashier location; (3)
store layout: product combination, customer flow, traffic
flow planning, waiting time, department location; (4) internal
display: product display, shelf/box, poster, label, promotion
tag; (5) human variables: crowdedness, customer traits,
salesperson attitude and employee uniforms. ZARA conveys
the brand's concept with the image of the display window. Its
spacious shopping space with bright light and neutral color
creates a stylish and comfortable shopping environment. In
addition, there are mirrors everywhere in the accessories area
for customer to try on items.
C. Brand Identification
Brand identity can convey to consumers information
about the logos, concepts and products of the brand.
Consumers’ recognition of brands includes symbolism,
emotions,
associations,
self-identification,
etc.
[13].
Consumers are more willing to purchase products that are
identifying to their self-images [14], and these products
make it easier to build brand identity [15]. Some consumers
tend to associate their social status with brands, and think
they can improve their personal image by buying brand
goods [16], and therefore, to them, brands usually have a
strong appeal [17].
When consumers recognize a brand, they are more
willing to pick the brand’s products as the first choice for
purchase. Many consumers choose to use their favorite
brands when they purchase goods. They also recommend
relatives and friends to use these brand goods, which
indirectly helps to promote the brand companies. Some
consumers think that ZARA clothing is more fashionable
and diversified, and it not only fits their own body shape, but
also represents their personal styles.
Brand identity is highly related to perceived values which
can be defined with different dimensions, such as active
value and passive value [18], functional value, social value,
and emotional value [19]. Kepferer defines brand identity
with six facets, namely, physique, personality, culture,
relationship, reflection, and self-image [20].
D. Experiential Marketing
Schmitt proposed a strategic framework for experiential
marketing, in which consumers are viewed as rational and
emotional human beings who take pleasurable experiences
into purchase decision [21]. Therefore, marketers can create
various experiences to intrigue customers and to affect their
purchase intention, such as sensory experiences, affective
experiences, cognitive experiences, physical experiences,
and social-identity experiences. These experiences can be
implemented through communications, visual and verbal
identity, product presence, electronic media, etc.

Pine and Gilmore pointed out that an experience occurs
when a company intentionally uses services as the stage, and
goods as props, to engage individual customers in a way that
creates a memorable event [22]. In the process of purchasing,
consumers not only focus on functions, but also on personal
taste, stimulating or certain feelings thus creating an
unforgettable
experience.
The
impression
will
make
consumers connect with the brand of the product. When the
consumer feels a stimulating and special experience, it will
affect the consumer’s willingness to purchase.
To
create
pleasurable
and
memorable
shopping
experiences
for
the
consumers,
ZARA
offers
fresh
assortments of designer-style garments and accessories for
relatively low prices in sophisticated stores in prime
locations in order to draw masses of fashion-conscious repeat
customers. For Taiwanese consumers, ZARA has been well-
known before it has set up a store in Taiwan. Its unique
operating model and stylish clothing brings to consumers a
different experience than other stores.
E. Experential Values
Value refers to the results of consumers’ assessments and
comparison
about
the
goods.
Perceived
value
is
the
consumer’s overall assessment of the utility of a product
based on perceptions of what is received and what is given,
which represents a tradeoff of the critical give and get
components [23]. The value of experience comes from the
consumers’ interactions with the retail entity and services
[24]. Experiential value varies with different people, time,
and places [18]. Experiential value can be enhanced through
interaction, but it may hinder the consumer’s purpose [25].
After comparing the services and products, the value
perceived by the consumers, and the results will influence
the purchase intention.
F. Purchase Intention
Purchase intention refers to three measuring indices,
namely, the possibility of consumers purchasing the product
[26], whether they will consider purchasing the product, and
whether they will recommend the product to friends and
relatives as a measure of purchase intention [23]. The higher
the willingness to buy, the greater the chance of purchase.
Therefore, purchase intention can be used as a predictive
consumer’s subjective view of a product [27].
G. Internet Communication Quality
In
the
era
of
e-commerce,
the
Internet
is
used
interactively for two-way communication and transactions,
with the main method of online communication being e-mail.
Some of the sites reviewed also provided online ordering and
payment systems, although these varied greatly regarding
geographical limitations, merchandise ranges and levels of
security [28]. Zeithaml et al. pointed out that communication
and control processes in the delivery of service quality.
Instantly sharing the brand’s information on the Internet to
the
customers,
such
as
backgrounds,
content,
plans,
activities, goals, would help to make customers understand
the firm and its brand [6]. On ZARA’s official website,
customers can see the background information, design
methods, sales models, and annual reports. Classified
information, such as lists of new products and best selling
products, size chart, detailed compositions and maintenance
methods, are also provided for the convenience of the
consumers.

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
A. Statistical Analysis
It took three months to complete the questionnaire
survey. The participants of this research were mostly young
adults aged 18-40, who have ever shopped or browsed in
ZARA store.
A total of 592 valid questionnaires were
collected. Among them, there were 248 males (47.1%) and
279 females (52.9%). The age distribution was 18-22
(29.8%), 30~40 (20.7%), 40 and above (4.2%), 18 and under
(3.8%). The distribution of education was high school (19%),
college (73.4%), graduate school (7.6%). The distribution of

monthly cost on apparel was $35 and less (12.3%), $35~$90
(31.5%), $90~$200 (23.7%), $200~$400 (27.9%), $400 and
more (4.6%). About 47.6% of the participants have visited
ZARA’s website.
B. Reliability Analysis
The Cronbach’s α is used to check the reliability of 
factors. According to Nunnall [10], the greater the value of α 
is, the greater the reliability is. Overall, when α value is 
greater than 0.7, it is acceptable. When α value is less than 
0.5, it is unacceptable.  From Table Ⅰ, one can see that all 
subfactors have high α value, it means the survey is reliable.

C. Tests of Research Hypothesis
For the first three hypotheses, this study uses multiple
regression analysis to test the research hypotheses on service
quality,
experiential
marketing
and
store
atmosphere
(independent variables) with respect to relationship quality
(dependent
variable).
F
test
is
used
to
measure
the
significance of the regression model. The standardized
regression coefficient (beta) is applied to evaluating the
predictive or explanative power of an independent variable.
The results are shown in Table Ⅱ where we can see that 
hypotheses H1, H2, H3 are correct. Moreover, since the Beta
value of experiential marketing (0.638) is greater than that of
store atmosphere (0.161) and service quality (0.111), it
means that experiential marketing has more impact on
relationship quality.

value
represents
the
significance and it always converted to p value to measure
the
hypothesis. To
test hypothesis H4, simple linear
regression analysis is conducted for experiential value
(independent) and brand identification (dependent). The
results are demonstrated in Table Ⅲ where one can see that 
H4 is acceptable, that means, the experiential value has
positive impact on brand identification.

in Table Ⅳ where one can see that H5 holds, that says, brand 
identification positively affects purchase intention.

It indicates that brand identification is a mediator between
experiential value and purchase intention, and the impact of
experiential value on purchase intention is reduced.

To test hypothesis H6, linear regression analysis is
conducted for service quality (independent) and purchase
intention (dependent) with moderation variable, Internet
communication quality. In statistics, the Variance Inflation
Factor (VIF) is usually applied in multiple regression
analysis, which is the ratio of variance in a model with
multiple terms, divided by the variance of a model with one
term alone. The results are demonstrated in Table Ⅵ, where

CONCLUSION
This study takes the international fast fashion chain
ZARA as the research object and aims to understand the
influences of service quality, experiential marketing, and
store atmosphere on customer relationship quality. The
results show that service quality, experience marketing and
store atmosphere will affect the quality of relationship with
customers. Experience marketing (ß value 0.638) has the
greatest impact, store atmosphere (ß value 0.161) ranks
second, and service quality (ß value 0.111) has the least
impact. The value of experience affects the willingness to
purchase through the mediator of the brand identity. The
quality of Internet communication will positively moderate
the quality of service to the willingness to purchase.
The brick-and-mortar store manages to create a customer
perceptive experience to improve the quality of relationship
with
customers,
including
experience
value,
brand
identification
and
purchase intention. While the
store
atmosphere can enhance customers’ experience value and
brand identification, service quality can enhance customer
brand identification.
For
the
international
fast
fashion
apparel
chain
implementing experiential marketing is useful to create
experience value and further increase customers’ purchase
intention, while brand identification plays a role as mediator
to enhance the process.
Among the participants of the questionnaire survey, 251
(47.63%)
subjects
have
visited
the
ZARA
webpage
verification page. The Internet communication quality has
shown a positive moderation effect on the degree of how the
service quality, experience marketing and store atmosphere
impact
on
the purchase
intention. Therefore,
for
the
international fast fashion apparel chain which mainly targets
the young generations, to maintain and improve Web
presence and communication performance can effectively
increase the impact of the physical storefront experience
marketing,
store
atmosphere
and
service
quality
on
customers’ purchase intention.
