Abstract— Video-Based Learning (VBL) has a long history in 
the educational design research. In the past decade, the interest 
in VBL has increased as a result of new forms of online 
education, such as flipped classrooms, and most prominently 
MOOCs. VBL has unique features that make it an effective 
Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) approach. This study 
critically analyzed the current research of VBL published in 
2003-2013 to build a deep understanding on what are the 
educational benefits and effectiveness that VBL has on 
teaching and learning. 67 peer reviewed papers were selected 
in this review and categorized into four main dimensions, 
namely, effectiveness, teaching methods, design, and reflection. 
In the light of the discussion of current research in terms of 
these categories, we present the future vision and research 
opportunities of VBL that support self-organized and network 
learning.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Video-based learning (VBL) has a long tradition as a 
learning method in educational classes. First experiments 
started during the Second World War. Soldiers were then 
trained with a combination of audio and film strips [12]. As a 
result, the static film strips helped to increase their skills 
while saving a lot of time as well. By the late 1960s, 
educational television was used as an extra tool in 
classrooms. Also teachers were confronted with videos of 
their own lessons to reflect on their teaching methods and 
improve their performance [63]. In the 1980s, VHS 
videotapes meant a quantum leap as it became much easier to 
use video in classrooms. But, still, learners were rather 
passive and could only watch the video. This changed with 
the rise of digital video CDs in the mid-1990s. Teachers 
could now add multimedia control and assessment tools by 
using the video on a computer. Thus, learners became much 
more active than before. By the 2000s, classrooms got 
connected to the internet and interactive digital video as well 
as video conferences became possible. Since then, new 
technologies such as smartphones and tablets in combination 
with social media such as YouTube have contributed to 
increasing social interaction and have made it easier as ever 
to integrate video applications in education [15][39]. In 
recent years, VBL publications have increased in order to 
discuss how VBL can facilitate learning and enhance 
learner’s outcome as well as teacher’s performance. Thus, 
there was a need to collect existing research, document the 
benefits of video in improving learning, and explore the 
design and teaching methods in VBL environments. In this 
study, we critically analyze the research on VBL to answer 
the following research questions: 
1. What are the educational benefits that VBL has on 
teaching and learning? 
2. How VBL technologies enhance students’ learning 
outcome?   
3. How 
educators 
and 
researchers 
design 
VBL 
environments?   
4. How is VBL used to improve teacher’s and learner’s 
reflection? 
In order to answer these questions, this paper will 
discuss different angles of VBL. The remainder of this 
paper is structured as follows: Section II is a review of the 
related 
work. 
Section 
III 
describes 
the 
research 
methodology and how we collected the research data. In 
Section V, we review and discuss the current research based 
on several dimensions. Finally, Section VI gives a summary 
of the main findings of this paper and highlights new 
research opportunities for future work.

RELATED WORK 
This section summarizes the previous work most closely 
related to our study. 
Tripp and Rich [77] reviewed 63 studies in order to 
understand the ability of teachers to reflect on their teaching 
through video recording. The result of this study was that 
teachers prefer to use video recording for reflection in 
collaboration with colleagues than reflecting individually. 
Also, teachers report that the use of a guiding framework 
(e.g., rubric, checklist, teaching principles) helps to focus on 
their reflection by focusing their attention on certain tasks. 
 Borgo et al., [57] conducted a study to provide an 
overview of the major advances in automated video analysis 
and investigate some techniques in the field of graphic 
design and visualization. 
Greenberg and Zanetis [1] reported the positive impact of 
video broadcast and streaming in education. As a result of 
their study, the authors encourage teachers and educators to 
use interactive video training materials in classes especially 
with children.  
Although these studies asserted that the video is a 
powerful tool in Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) and 
that videos enable teachers to reflect on their teaching, they 
do not take into account the teaching methodologies, design

approaches, and the impact of teachers’ reflections on their 
students’ learning outcomes. As compared to the above 
studies, our study adds a wide range of peer-reviewed studies 
that have been conducted between 2003 and 2013 and 
provides a quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of the 
VBL literature. Moreover, we apply a cognitive mapping 
approach to categorize the VBL publication into several 
dimensions. The study further provides critical discussion 
according to each dimension and suggests new opportunities 
for future work. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
The research methodology was carried out in two main 
phases including identification of eligible studies followed 
by a cognitive mapping approach to categorize the VBL 
literature into several dimensions. 
A. Identification of Eligible Studies 
The significant research method of identifying papers 
from Internet resources was applied to collect data in this 
study [2]. This method was carried out in three rounds. 
Firstly, we conducted a search in 7 major refereed academic 
databases. These include Education Resources Information 
Center (ERIC), JSTOR, ALT Open Access Repository, 
Google Scholar, PsychInfo, ACM publication, IEEEXplorer, 
and Wiley Online Library.  
Secondly, we searched 21 academic journals in the field 
of educational technology and TEL indexed by Journal 
Citation Reports (JCR) including Australasian Journal of 
Educational Technology, British Journal of Educational 
Technology, Canadian journal of learning and technology, 
CITE Journal, The Electronic Journal of e-Learning (EJEL), 
European Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning 
(EURODL), Interactions Journal, The International Journal 
of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 
International Review of Research in Open and Distance 
Learning (IRRODL), Journal of Asynchronous Learning 
Networks, Journal of computer assisted learning (JCAL), 
Journal of Computing in Higher Education, Journal of 
distance education, Journal of Interactive Media in 
Education, Journal of Interactive Online Learning, Journal of 
Learning Design, Journal of Online Learning and Teaching 
(JOLT), Journal of Technology, Learning, and Assessment , 
Learning, Media and Technology, and Turkish Online 
Journal of Distance Education (TOJDE), using the keywords 
(and their plurals) “Video-based learning”, “VBL”, “teaching 
with interactive video”, and “Video Instruction”. As a result, 
98 peer-reviewed papers were found. 
Thirdly, a set of selection criteria were identified as 
follows: 
1. Studies 
must 
focus 
on 
VBL 
in 
educational 
development. Studies on video coding and semantic 
retrieval of video were excluded. 
2. Experimental or empirical case studies on how learners 
learn with and from videos were included. Studies of 
video recording strategies were excluded. 
3. Studies that focus on ability of teachers to reflect on 
their teaching via video recording were included.  
4. Studies evaluating the VBL activities and effectiveness 
in education were included. Studies that focused on 
video-games and video conferencing tools were 
excluded. 
This resulted in a final set of 67 peer-reviewed studies, 
which met the selection criteria above. Figure 1 shows the 
number of VBL publications between 2003 and 2013, which 
were found to be relevant for this study. 
 
Figure 1. VBL studies by publication year. 
B. Cognitive Mapping Approach 
Cognitive mapping approach is a method enabling the 
researchers to clarify and categorize the research literature 
conceptions into several dimensions regarding to the 
research questions. These dimensions are recorded in graphic 
flowchart to show the hierarchy of VBL terms [72].  We 
applied the cognitive mapping approach as a classification 
technique for dividing the VBL literature into four 
dimensions relevant to the research questions, namely 
effectiveness, teaching methods, reflection, and design (see 
Figure 2). 
 
Figure 2. VBL classification map. 
In order to capture the information gained from the literature 
analysis, we created a VBL field diagram (see Figure 3), 
which has been partitioned into four categories and ten sub-
categories. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
In this section, we critically discuss in details the VBL 
literature based on the cognitive map dimensions that have 
been identified in Section III. For the critical discussion part, 
113

we apply the meta-analysis method, which aims to contrast 
and combine results from several studies into a single 
scientific work [2]. 
 
Figure 3. VBL cognitive map. 
A. Effectiveness 
Effectiveness of VBL has received a great deal of 
attention from academic scientists. 33% of the studies 
reviewed in this paper examined the effectiveness of VBL. 
Most of the reviewed case studies asserted the effectiveness 
of VBL as a powerful medium used in education. We 
analyzed each study for the following characteristics: 
research goal, subject, target group, sample size, and 
summary of results. In the following sections, we discuss the 
effectiveness of VBL in terms of learning outcome, 
interaction, and learners’ satisfaction. 
1) Learning 
Outcome: 
A 
learning 
outcome 
(or 
achievement) can be described as knowledge, skills, and 
abilities that learners have to achieve as a result of the 
learning process [47]. Many scholars believe that VBL has 
the potential to promote the learning outcome. VBL can, for 
instance, present knowledge in an attractive and consistent 
manner [19][51]. Further, Kay and Edward [60] and Balslev 
et al. [74] compared VBL supported by a cognitive 
approach with text-based learning. The results showed 
statistically significant differences in improving learners’ 
skills. Moreover, the authors reported that learners liked the 
followed cognitive approach in which knowledge was 
generated through step by step learning in video lectures. 
In addition, Lin and Tseng [8] and Hsu et al. [13] 
conducted two studies to investigate the effect of different 
VBL designs to improve English language skills of K-12 
students. The findings indicated that the groups which used 
VBL outperformed the other groups. Other studies reported 
the invaluable impact of using VBL in improving teachers’ 
performance. The results asserted that using videos as 
educational tools improved teaching methods and increased 
the learning outcome [4][50][63][71]. 
On the other hand, some studies indicated that there 
were no statistically significant differences between 
teaching with video and other methods, and that both are 
equivalent [23][42][61]. Moreover, Chuang and Rosenbusch 
[28] pointed out that using only video technology without 
pedagogy approach doesn’t make sense. The authors 
stressed that video technology should go side by side with 
pedagogy and provided a constructivist framework to 
engage learners to learn with videos.     
In sum, the reviewed studies indicated that there were 
conflicting 
results 
of 
using 
VBL 
in 
educational 
environments as some found it valuable while others 
reported no significant results. There was, however, an 
agreement among researchers that VBL in conjunction with 
appropriate pedagogical methods has the potential to 
improve the learning outcome. 
2) Interaction: Improved interaction and communication 
among participants is another effectiveness aspect in VBL. 
DeLoache and Korac [40] reviewed some case studies of 
using videos with infants. The authors pointed out that video 
stories indeed improved  communication between children. 
Hakkarainen and Vapalahti [52] investigated learning with 
video in the forum-theatre. This study showed that VBL can 
enhance interaction among learners and improve the ability 
to solve every day social problems. 
On the contrary, Muhirwa [37] investigated VBL in TEL 
environments in Africa pointed out that VBL has a  less 
important role in increasing the interaction among learners 
due to internet disconnectivity, limited student access to 
computers, and lack of trained instructors in Africa. 
3) Satisfaction: The level of learning satisfaction is 
important in evaluating the effectiveness of VBL 
environments. Zhang et al. [19] examined the level of 
satisfaction through interactive VBL in a study involving 
138 students. As a result, students who used a TEL 
environment that provides interactive instructional video 
reported higher levels of satisfaction than those in the 
control group without video.  
Moreover, it has been shown that interactive videos have 
an impact on the emotional side of the learners’ behaviour 
(e.g., real-life interaction,  incorporate the different sound 
and musical effects that can fit the emotional contents of the 
learning subject) and that videos can improve the attention

to the subject of the lecture in addition to the positive impact 
on the learners’ motivation level [3][54][68]. 
B. Teaching Methods 
Educationists and scholars use a broad range of teaching 
methodologies in VBL environments. In this literature 
review, collaborative learning is a key aspect underlying 
most of the studies. Other methods involved micro teaching, 
video summarization, video assessment, hybrid learning, 
and student-centered learning. 
1) Collaborative Learning: In video-based collaborative 
learning, 
which 
focuses 
on developing, discussing, 
exploring alternatives rather than directions, learners are 
able to share responsibilities for their learning [16][19][36]. 
Most of the reviewed studies validate the efficacy of 
collaborative VBL, where learners can develop their 
problem-solving abilities via collaboration with others [1]. 
These studies reported various educational benefits for 
learners working cooperatively in teams such as shared 
goals, ideas, resources, activities, and supporting each other 
[17][18][29][38]. For instance, Pea and Lindgren [62] 
investigated which collaboration design patterns are used by 
learners when they have access to a Web-based video 
collaboration platform. Five collaboration patterns were 
identified, namely collective interpretation, distributed 
design, performance feedback, distributed data coding, and 
video-based prompting. These patterns support teacher-
centred learning by providing knowledge and allowing 
learners to discuss and find solutions. 
2) Micro Teaching: The micro teaching method was 
used in some studies as a teaching practice with a smaller 
class size and time (e.g., four to nine learners in a class that 
is held for five to ten minutes). Educators are able to give 
learners some quick and easy feedback on their learning 
performance through video podcasts [21]. Finlay et al. [34] 
reported that learners’ responses on micro teaching with 
video podcasts are very positive. The authors, however, 
noted that the video of 10 minutes length was too long for 
many learners and found that the shorter video podcasts (4-5 
minutes) have the advantage of giving greater flexibility in 
micro teaching lessons. Other studies showed that micro 
teaching provides a friendly and supportive learning 
environment [43][76]. 
3) Video 
Summarization: 
Video 
summarization 
technique extracts important information and provides short 
but informative summary of the lecture content [11][78]. 
Chang et al. [79] designed a keyword-based video 
summarization learning platform (KVSUM) which provides 
a keyword cloud as a textual surrogate to support learners to 
organize information of videos and enhance them to follow 
the videos and reducing the learning time. 
4) Video Assessment: A video assessment is short video 
that simulates real life activities and provides possible 
responses to the several daily problems. Learners are asked 
to select which of the responses they would take in these 
circumstances. Afterwards, teachers discuss each response 
and evaluate learner’s responses [22][56].  
5) Hybrid Learning: Hybrid Learning has become one 
important TEL model, by integrating online learning and 
traditional face-to-face classroom together [25][59]. Pang 
[81] conducted a study by following a hybrid learning 
approach that uses video-based learning materials in a  
Physical Education course. In this course, the trainer can 
review the learner’s actions video, pick out the wrong 
actions, and provide feedback. Then, students can reflect, 
find out mistakes. The experiment shows that 80.9% out of 
learners think that the video review indeed improved their 
physical skills. 
In other studies, Shih [58] and Kırkgöz [80] investigated a 
hybrid learning approach supported by video lectures for an 
English speaking course. The study showed that the learners 
made noticeable improvement in their oral communication 
skills, and that they were satisfied with the blended learning 
model. 
6) Student-Centred Learning: Most of the reviewed 
VBL studies followed a teacher-centred approach. Only 
15% of studies have focused on student-centred learning 
[35][67]. These studies don’t depend on teachers as content 
providers. They aimed at providing the space for students to 
be active participants in their learning environment, interact 
to build and construct knowledge, and get mutual support to 
make decisions using reflection and critical judgement. 
C. Design 
Several researchers in TEL have explored how to design 
effective VBL environments. Annotation and authoring tools 
are the most used design tools in the reviewed VBL 
literature.  
1) Annotation Tools: Annotation means adding note, 
comment, explanation, and presentational mark-up attached 
to a document, image, or video [53]. In VBL, annotation 
refers to the additional notes added to the video without 
modifying the resource itself, which help in searching, 
highlighting, analysis, retrieval, and providing feedback 
[41]. Moreover, video annotation provides an easy way for 
indexing, discussion, reflection, and conclusion of content 
[49][66]. 
Colasante [45] examined the integration of a video 
annotation tool (MAT) into the learning and assessment 
activities of a third year class “Physical Education” course 
at RMIT University. This tool allowed learners to select and 
annotate parts of a video. These annotations are then used 
by students and teachers to discuss, receive feedback, 
reflect, and evaluate their learning and teaching practice. 
The results showed that MAT was effective for receiving 
feedback form teachers and peers. But, some issues 
regarding the quality of the collaborative input from peers 
were noted.

2) Authoring Tools: A number of studies have 
developed a wide range of authoring tools for VBL content. 
The primary function of these authoring tool is to increase 
the interactivity with the VBL environment, thus engaging 
learners in the learning processe [73]. The following tools 
were used in various VBL environments: 
 
Synchronize lecture note: The aim of this tool is to 
synchronize a video stream with the presentation 
slide by means of video clip timing [73]. 
 
Content summarization tool: This tool is able to 
extract summary information from lecture videos and 
provide it to the learners automatically [33] [55]. 
 
Digital Video Library: This tool uses indexing to 
enable 
content-based 
search 
for 
a 
particular 
information of a video lecture [48]. 
 
Discussion forum: A space integrated in the VBL 
environment where learners can discuss and share 
common interests or goals on a learning topic 
[30][32]. 
D. Reflection 
There is an interest in using VBL to support teachers’ 
and students’ reflection on their teaching and learning 
activities [69][77]. 
1) Teacher Reflection: Video recording of the classroom 
lessons enables teachers to reflect on their teaching [20]. 
Teachers can record their own teaching, watch what they 
did in the classroom, think about it, and reflect on the 
performance using both individual and collaborative 
reflection [5][9]. 
Studies examined both individual and collaborative 
reflection. 85% of the studies on reflection in VBL noted 
that teachers prefer to reflect on their teaching performance 
with colleagues [9][20][46]. Similarly, Calandra et al. [5] 
and Calandra et al. [6] stressed that the teacher’s reflective 
process should be collaborative where groups of teachers 
provide comments or feedback to each other. Several 
reflection methods were used, e.g., daily reflection, weekly 
reflection, and end of semester reflection [64][65]. 
Only 15% of studies examined self-reflection where 
teachers reflected individually on their teaching. Teachers 
used video-taped lesson analysis and wrote comments for 
self-reflection [14]. Likewise, Gainsburg, [35] implemented 
video annotation tools to scaffold, structure, and transform 
teacher reflection. 
2) Learner Reflection: Recording classroom activities is 
also important for learners to reflect on their own learning 
experience, evaluate their performance, and get a clearer 
overview of their learning progress. Video recordings 
further help learners in revision prior to exams [31][69].  
V. 
FUTURE VISIONS 
In this section, we will present the future visions carried 
out from the critical analysis of the VBL literature. In the last 
few years, the expansion of new open VBL models, such as 
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and flipped 
classrooms has changed the TEL landscape by providing 
more opportunities for informal learners than ever before, 
regardless of their educational level, culture, location, age, 
income, and admission requirements. 
A. MOOCs 
 MOOCs are leading the new revolution of TEL, by 
providing new opportunities to a massive number of 
learners to attend online courses from anywhere all over the 
world [75]. Different forms of MOOCs have been 
introduced in the MOOC literature. Siemens [27] 
characterize MOOCs into cMOOCs-based on a theory of 
connectivism, and xMOOCs by virtue of behaviorism and 
cognitivist theories with some social constructivism aspects 
as more institutional model, e.g., Coursera, edX and 
Udacity. cMOOCs enable learners to build their own 
networks via blogs, wikis, Google groups, Twitter, 
Facebook, and other social networking tools outside the 
learning platform without any restrictions from the teacher 
[26]. In xMOOCs, by contrast, learning objectives are pre-
defined by teachers who impart their knowledge through 
short video lectures, often followed by simple e-assessment 
tasks (e.g. quiz, eTest) [70]. Recently, new forms of MOOCs 
have emerged. These include smOOCs as open online 
courses with a relatively small number of participants and 
blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) as hybrid MOOCs including 
in-class and online video-based learning activities [27]. 
In general, MOOCs require key stakeholders to address 
a number of challenges, including questions about hybrid 
education, the role of the university/teacher, plagiarism, 
certification, completion rates, and innovation beyond 
traditional learning models. These challenges will need to be 
addressed as the understanding of the technical and 
pedagogical issues surrounding MOOCs evolves. 
B. Flipped Classroom 
In the flipped classroom model, learners watch video 
lectures as homework. The class is then an active learning 
session where the teacher use case studies, labs, games, 
simulations, or experiments to discuss the concepts presented 
in the video lecture [10]. The flipped classroom is also an 
instance of VBL model that enables to save time in the 
classroom by discussing only difficulties, problems, and 
practical aspects of the learning course [7]. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
VBL is a rich and powerful model used in TEL to 
improve learning outcomes as well as learner satisfaction. In 
this paper, we analysed the research on VBL published in 
2003-2013. 67 peer reviewed papers were selected in this 
review. A cognitive mapping approach was used to map the 
conducted research on VBL into four main dimensions 
namely, effectiveness, teaching methods, design, and 
reflection.

The following is a summary of the main findings in our 
study as well as aspects of VBL that need further research, 
according to each dimension.  
A. Effectivness 
The analysis of the VBL research showed mixed results 
in terms of learning outcomes in VBL environments. There 
is, however, a tendency that users of VBL environments rate 
interaction and learner satisfaction significantly higher than 
in traditional classroom environments. Despite these 
possible 
advantages, 
several 
aspects 
concerning 
effectiveness in VBL need further investigation: (1) what 
are the positive and negative attitudes towards using video 
lectures? (2) How can VBL motivate learners? (3) How can 
a MOOC as VBL environment personalize the learning 
experience for learners? This would enable learners to select 
the educational resources and the learning style that meet 
their characteristics best, thus increasing the effectiveness of 
the learning experience. 
B. Teaching Methods  
 Educators use a broad range of teaching methodologies 
in VBL environments. These include collaborative learning, 
micro teaching, video summarization, video assessment, 
hybrid learning, and student-centered learning. Most of 
VBL implementations so far still follow a top-down, 
controlled, teacher-centered, and centralized learning model. 
Only, 15% of the reviewed research papers describe 
attempts 
to 
implement 
bottom-up, 
student-cantered 
approaches. Additional research is needed to investigate the 
benefits of new ways of VBL based on new learning 
concepts such as personal learning environments [1] and 
network learning [9].  
C. Design 
Several tools were used in VBL to increase interactivity, 
collaboration, and learners’ satisfaction with the VBL 
environment. Annotation tools are utilized in searching, 
highlighting, analysis, retrieval, and providing feedback. To 
increase interactivity a number of authoring tools were used. 
These include lecture note synchronization and content 
summarization tools as well as video libraries and forums. 
Future research needs to find out how to design more open 
models of VBL such as MOOCs and flipped classroom.  
D. Reflection 
VBL facilitates teachers’ as well as learners’ reflection. 
Our study showed that teachers prefer to reflect on their 
teaching 
performance 
with 
colleagues 
rather 
than 
individually. And, learners think that videos have the 
potential to be used as a reflection tool. Future research is 
needed to investigate how learning analytics can help to 
better understand and improve reflection and awareness in 
VBL environments, such as MOOCs.
