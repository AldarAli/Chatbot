Abstract—Many recent research works have investigated the 
potential of an Ontology-based approach to support the 
standardization of the information in industrial scenarios. A 
key success factor in this regard is the effective and efficient 
reuse of existing knowledge sources because the building of 
new ones from scratch is an expensive and time-consuming 
activity. Although there are many advantages for reuse in the 
knowledge engineering, the topic is not explored in depth and 
the current state of the art in this field demands further 
investigation. The study introduced in this paper addresses the 
applicability of an approach to knowledge reuse based on the 
combination of existing techniques and methods proposed in 
the literature. Specifically, the experimentation has been 
carried out in the context of the ongoing European research 
project Apps4aME, where an automated framework for 
knowledge reuse has been tested and validated, focusing in 
particular on the food knowledge domain. The paper 
summarizes the main results of the research work and includes 
the emerging issues as well as some proposals to overcome 
them. 
Keywords-knowledge reuse; ontology engineering; semantic 
matching. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Reuse is an intrinsic practice in traditional engineering 
fields. The designers of different disciplines, from mechanics 
to electronics, apply it successfully whenever they build a 
new component, thus saving cost and time and improving the 
overall system quality. In this regard, an important example 
in the context of electronics is the reuse of standard 
components 
with 
well-documented 
and 
well-defined 
interfaces during the design of electrical circuits. Contrary to 
the traditional disciplines of engineering and despite intense 
efforts, reuse remains an underexplored and not standard 
process of the knowledge engineering. In this area, the key 
resources that can be reused are the reference models, which 
represent an abstract framework to understand significant 
relationships between defined concepts related to a specific 
domain, by developing consistent specifications. 
Nowadays, a large number of reference models, covering 
a wide range of domains, are available in literature and can 
be considered a valid starting point for the knowledge reuse. 
In particular, at this stage, it is essential to refer to the state-
of-the-art technical standards covering different domains, 
e.g., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), the Standard for 
the Exchange of Product model data (STEP), and the 
International Society of Automation standards (e.g., ISA-95). 
In fact, they contribute to enable a comprehensive 
conceptualization 
of 
the 
represented 
domains, 
thus 
simplifying the communication and collaboration between 
the involved actors. The ability to perform effectively and 
efficiently knowledge reuse plays also a crucial role in the 
development of ontologies, which are one of the most 
debated topics in data modelling research community 
because they represent a potential solution to the problem of 
standardization of information [1][2]. In the context of 
ontology engineering, reuse of existing reference models has 
several advantages. First, it reduces the cost and the time 
required for the conceptualization of specific domains from 
scratch [3]. Moreover, it increases the quality of newly 
implemented ontologies as the reused components have 
already been validated. Finally, it avoids the confusion and 
the inconsistencies that may be generated from multiple 
representations of the same domain; thus, it strengthens the 
orchestration and harmonization of knowledge [4]. 
A lot of efforts has been devoted towards the application 
of knowledge reuse in the field of ontology engineering. In 
this regard, Pinto and Martins [5] have analyzed the process 
from a methodological point of view, thus introducing an 
approach that comprises several phases and activities. 
Moreover, the European research project NeOn proposed a 
novel methodology for building ontology which emphasizes 
the role of existing ontological and non-ontological resources 
for the knowledge reuse [6]. However, some open issues still 
remain, especially with regards to the difficulty of dealing 
with the extreme formalisms heterogeneity of the increasing 
number of models available in literature [3]. The absence of 
an automatic framework for the rigorous evaluation of the 
knowledge sources is also a severe limitation to overcome. 
Finally, some sub-processes of the reuse process have been 
defined and formalized only at the theoretical level. 
Therefore, it is essential to carry out the experimentation 
within practical cases. 
This paper presents an extended feasibility study of an 
approach to knowledge reuse based on the combination of 
existing techniques and methods proposed in the literature. 
The approach has been tested on the real industrial case of 
the Romanian company CarmOlimp, where existing

knowledge sources have been explored for the development 
of new ontologies in the Food domain, thanks to the 
contribution of domain experts. Through the analysis of a 
real case study based on empirical evidences, the idea behind 
this study is to encourage and support the reuse of existing 
reference models, enhancing its real-world usability and 
identifying the challenges to make this practice a viable 
alternative to the development of ontologies from scratch. 
The reminder of the paper is structured as follows. 
Section II describes the CarmOlimp case study, whereas 
Section III introduces and illustrates the knowledge reuse 
framework. Finally, Section IV draws the conclusions, 
summarizing the major findings and the future steps. 
II. 
THE  CARMOLIMP CASE STUDY  
 Modern enterprises have to face the challenge of 
handling a large amount of data, which are expressed in 
different and heterogeneous formats and are also distributed 
in various sources, while aiming at improving the 
effectiveness 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
their 
production 
processes [7][8]. This problem is relevant also for the 
Romanian company CarmOlimp that plays the meat market 
covering a large part of the meat production chain with a 
wide range of products (e.g., fresh meat, processed meat, 
dairy products, etc.). Since the effects of globalization are 
forcing this company to adapt its market to lower prices and 
high quality, it is needed to optimize its planning and 
monitoring activities to reduce the time for distribution, 
improve its packaging and optimize the monitoring of the 
meat temperature. The performance of such business process 
can be improved if they are supported by interoperable 
software tools. Semantic web technologies can be adopted to 
develop interoperable approaches [9] supporting the 
collaboration between all the involved actors and resources, 
while taking in consideration the storage of data [10], data 
definition via proper meta-models [11] and the inference of 
new knowledge [12]. 
The first step towards the realization of an ontology-
based approach consists in the creation of an ontology, which 
is a common shared representation of the objects and their 
relationships and is intended to be used by the apps involved 
in the scenarios. The problem of developing comprehensive 
data models for various domains has already been addressed 
by researchers and a large number of them is available in 
literature. In the belief that their reuse could greatly reduce 
the costs of a new implementation, the next section 
introduces a framework that aims at identifying relevant data 
models for the formal conceptualization of a generic 
industrial case, while using CarmOlimp as a reference case 
study. 
III. 
THE FRAMEWORK  
The proposed framework requires as input a conceptual 
representation of the data model that highlights the 
hierarchy of concepts and their logical relations together 
with useful metadata description (target model). This 
representation can be the result of several interviews with 
the company’s stakeholders and can be expressed in several 
languages, e.g., plain-text, XSD (XML Schema Definition), 
UML (Unified Modelling Language) Class Diagrams, E-R 
(Entity-Relationship) diagrams, etc.  
As shown in Figure 1, the framework requires the 
contribution of two different figures: domain experts and 
knowledge engineers. The domain experts are people who 
have deep knowledge of a specific domain, whereas the 
knowledge engineers are employed to elicit and translate 
this knowledge in terms of ontology axioms. The 
contribution of both occur during the whole process and 
comprises three phases, which are briefly summarized as 
follows: 
• 
identification of the knowledge domains covering the 
target model; 
• 
search for the candidate reference models related to 
each specific domain; 
• 
selection of the proper models to be reused.  
Each of these phases is described in the next subsections, 
showing also how it can be applied to the specific case of 
CarmOlimp. 
 
 
Figure 1. Framework workflow 
A. The first phase: the identification of the knowledge 
domains 
The first phase identifies the knowledge domains covering 
the target data model by a deep understanding of the 
concepts and of the metadata description within the case 
study. The contribution of domain experts is essential in 
order to clarify the meaning of some poorly defined 
concepts and to enable knowledge engineers to identify the 
right resources for this phase. Many of them are available in 
literature and can be used by knowledge engineers as a 
valuable aid to carry out the domains identification. The 
most important are the following:  
1. Wordnet [13], a freely and publicly available large 
lexical database of English words. 
2. General purpose or content-specific encyclopedia, 
e.g., Wikipedia and The Oxford Encyclopedia of 
Food and Drink in America. 
3. Web 
directories, 
e.g., 
DMOZ 
(from 
directory.mozilla.org) and Yahoo! Directory.

4. Standard classifications, e.g., the International 
Classification for Standards (ICS) compiled by ISO 
(International Standardization Organization).  
5. Other electronic and hard-copy knowledge sources, 
including technical manuals, reports and any other 
documentation that the domain experts may consider 
useful to identify the knowledge domains. 
 
 
Figure 2. CarmOlimp knowledge domains 
 
For the CarmOlimp case study, the knowledge engineers 
have identified the domains reported in Figure 2, which can 
be also mapped onto the following categories and sub-
categories of ICS:

Since several domains have emerged during the analysis, the 
rest of the discussion will briefly overview their description 
and will focus mainly only on the food domain. This latter 
can be considered particularly significant for the analyzed 
scenario, as the core business of Carmolimp is meat 
processing. 
B. Second phase: the search for candidate reference 
models 
During this phase, knowledge engineers and domain 
experts continue to collaborate in order to identify the best 
tools and resources supporting the search for the relevant 
sources covering the selected knowledge domains. Within 
this study, the following sources were explored:  
1. Specialized portals and websites within public or 
private organizations. 
2. Search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, etc.), directory-
based engines, e.g., Yahoo!, BOTW (Best of the Web 
Directory), DMOZ, etc., specialized semantic-based engines, 
e.g., Yummly (specialized on food), True Knowledge, etc. 
3. Ontology 
repositories 
including: 
BioPortal, 
Cupboard, Schemapedia, Knoodl, etc., and search engines 
for semantic web ontologies, e.g., Swoogle and the Watson 
Semantic search engine. 
4. Available standards and non-standard reference 
models that provide requirements, specifications, guidelines 
and characteristics of a service or a product (ISO standards, 
the IFC Industry Foundation Classes, Ansi/ISA-95, STEP, 
mentioned above, and the Core Product Model). 
On the basis of these sources, the search has yielded a set 
of ten relevant candidates (Table II) for the food domain in 
the Carmolimp case study. They are the input for the next 
step of the framework. 
C. Third phase: candidates selection 
This phase identifies the best candidates for the formal 
conceptualization of the target model. The identification is 
performed by an initial qualitative analysis that yields the 
ranking of candidates according to some preference criteria. 
Afterwards, a linguistic analysis is carried out in order to 
identify the candidates which are conceptually closer to the 
target model (relatedness), by a measure of their similarity 
level. 
Reference models can be rated according to relevant 
technical characteristics and other general information. The 
most important ones, considered in this study for the 
qualitative analysis of the sources, are shown in Table I and 
summarized in the following list:  
(c1) Model formality level. It describes the formality of 
the conceptual model representation that can range from 
plain text to description logic-based languages. 
(c2) Model type generality. It evaluates the model type 
from the viewpoint of its generality (upper-level model or 
application specific model).

(c3) Model type structure. It evaluates the model type 
from the viewpoint of its structure (simple classifications or 
taxonomies versus semantic enriched ontologies).  
(c4) Model language. It describes the language used to 
represent the conceptual model, including RDF/OWL 
(Resource 
Description 
Framework/Ontology 
Web 
Language), graphic-based languages and pure text.  
(c5) Model provenance. It evaluates the model from the 
viewpoint of its origin, thus giving higher rates to standards 
or conceptual models authored by influential scientific 
groups. 
(c6) Model license. It evaluates the availability of the 
conceptual model (open data-model versus proprietary and 
licensed models). 
A higher rate will be given to formal models because the 
aim of the framework is to reuse existing models for a formal 
conceptualization of the target model.

With regards to the type generality, a domain model is 
more appropriate than upper level ontologies and application 
specific ontologies, because the latter may be too specific or 
too generic for the purpose of this study. The preferred 
model structure is Ontology because it generally provides 
logical links between concepts, thus adding more semantics 
to the data model than simple taxonomies and other types of 
classifications. The preferred representational language is 
RDF [14] and OWL [15] because the target model will be 
realized in those languages. With regard to the provenance, 
models delivered by standardization organizations or well-
known research groups will be preferred to those produced 
by non-standard or unknown organizations. Finally, only 
open data models are passed onto the linguistic analysis, 
because their free availability is a mandatory requirement in 
this evaluation. Table I reports the values corresponding to 
the preference criteria mentioned above (with rates 
decreasing from left to right). On the basis of the criteria 
previously defined, a comparison of the set of pre-selected 
models is carried out. In order to facilitate the analysis of the 
technical characteristics, a synopsis of the main outcomes of 
this study is reported in Table II. In view of these results, the 
knowledge engineer has selected the following candidate to 
be promoted for the linguistic analysis: National Cancer 
Institute Thesaurus, AGROVOC Ontology, BBC Food 
Ontology, Linked Recipe Schema and LIRMM Food 
Ontology.  
The linguistic analysis uses WordNet and some of its 
APIs (Application Program Interfaces) [16] for estimating 
the linguistic matching measures between the target model 
and the candidate models. In WordNet, nouns, verbs, 
adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive 
synonyms (synsets), each expressing a different concept 
[17]. The synsets are interlinked by conceptual-semantic and 
lexical relations, thus realizing a graph-based structure where 
synsets are nodes and lexical-relations are the edges.

As shown in Figure 3, the linguistic analysis comprises 
three different steps. First, a list of terms is extracted from all 
the concepts of the candidate models and the target model. 
This process has been automatized using specific tools, e.g. 
XMI (XML Metadata Interchange) parsers, Ontology APIs 
including Jena, or Simple Access XML APIs, depending on 
the format used to represent the model. Then, all terms of the 
target model are compared to all those of each candidate 
model, in order to estimate the maximum Wu-Palmer [18] 
similarity between their synsets. This measure is calculated 
exploiting the Wordnet graph-based representation and 
indicates how much two terms are close to each other by 
counting the number of edges between them and also by 
taking into account their proximity to the root concept of the 
hierarchy [19]. According to Lin [20], Wu-Palmer similarity 
has the advantage of being simple to calculate, in addition to 
its performances while remaining as expressive as the others. 
Table III shows an example of these calculations performed 
for the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus and the 
CarmOlimp target model. Finally, after the Wu-Palmer 
measures are calculated for each pair of terms, the average 
similarity (i.e., the sum of the Wu-Palmer similarities 
divided by the number of analyzed pairs) has been estimated 
for each candidate.

These measures are reported in Table IV together with 
the number of 100%-matching concepts and the number of 
concepts having a value of the Wu-Palmer measure greater 
than 0.5. The values of the average similarity are all very 
close and they range from 0.64 to 0.68. However, the 
National Cancer Institute Thesaurus proves to be the model 
more semantically related to the target model, since it has the 
largest number of 100%-matching concepts and the higher 
number of concepts having a value of the Wu-Palmer 
measure greater than 0.5.  
A preliminary validation of these results has been 
performed by the domain experts through an empirical 
method based on their expertise. Moreover, this validation 
has been paired with an evaluation of the accuracy of the 
similarity scores with respect to some existing gold 
standards. This  verification is currently under study.

IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
This work has demonstrated that an approach based on 
linguistic matching can help to identify the most relevant 
reference models that are available to cover concepts of the 
considered domain. Nonetheless, this approach still requires 
a significant amount of manual work, even when it deals 
with common and formal models. This requirement may be 
a severe limitation for a widespread adoption of the 
knowledge reuse, but it represents also a relevant 
technological gap to be addressed in future works by 
developing new methods and tools. Moreover, new 
similarity measures can be studied to improve the accuracy 
of the herein presented matching framework also with 
respect to some existing gold standards.
