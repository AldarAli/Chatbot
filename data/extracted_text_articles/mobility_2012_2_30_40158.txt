Abstract— The e-reader is a mobile electronic device designed 
specifically for reading electronic books. E-readers have 
captured public attention all over the world, making it 
essential to better understand the patterns of user adoption 
and intention behaviour regarding these devices. In this paper, 
we examine two adoption models, the Theory of Reasoned 
Action (TRA) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), 
and four Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour (DTPB) 
models with our proposed extended antecedents (hedonic and 
utilitarian) and determine that the DTPB model-2 is, relatively 
speaking, the best among all of these models. In terms of the 
Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Browne–Cudeck 
criterion (BCC), the TRA is more accurate than the TPB. 
However, the other fit index, the Root Mean Square Error of 
Approximation RMSEA (RMSEA) is not acceptable for the 
TRA and the TPB (> 0.1) although it is for the DTPB models. 
As e-readers offer an increasing variety of products to use (e-
books, music, applications, etc), this will change users’ beliefs 
regarding the opportunities that are needed to perform a 
behaviour. In our conclusion, the utilitarian products offering 
by e-reader are an important variable that influences 
consumer intention to use e-book reader, but the variable of 
hedonic product is not.

 INTRODUCTION 
An e-reader is a mobile electronic device designed 
primarily for the purpose of reading digital e-books and 
periodicals [1]. The main advantages of the e-reader are 
convenience and information access. Users have the ability 
to access information anytime, anywhere, and will 
appreciate that this access is fast and easy. E-readers are 
becoming ever more popular in high-tech cultures, such as 
that in Japan, the US, and Europe. According to the latest 
research from Informa Telecoms & Media (2012), e-reader 
sales are expected to peak at 14 million in 2013 [2]. The 
consumption of e-books is also growing in Japan. 
Interestingly, 80% of all e-books read in Japan are 
consumed on mobile devices [3].  
As Japanese youth are technology savvy, they typically 
feel great enthusiasm towards new technologies. However, 
e-readers are not yet as popular among young Japanese as 
other new technologies (e.g., smart phones). It has become 
extremely important for the e-book industry to explore the 
consumer attitudes and adoption behaviours regarding this 
technology. Examining Japanese consumer perceptions of e-
reading devices is essential for current and future device 
development.  
Our main objectives are, first, to achieve a clear 
understanding of consumer attitudes towards e-readers; we 
have investigated the antecedents related to their adoption 
and usage. Second, we aim to generate a research model that 
accurately describes Japanese youths’ e-reader usage 
behaviour and belief structure. There is no prior research 
comparing the TRA [4], TPB [5], and DTPB [6] models 
regarding e-book usage in this population. To accomplish 
these objectives, the TRA, TPB, and DTPB models have 
been used as a guideline, and we have considered both 
hedonic [7] and utilitarian products [7] as the two extended 
antecedents of our DTPB models.  
One general research question drove this study: how do 
students’ multidimensional beliefs influence their adoption 
of or intention to use e-readers. In an effort to answer this 
question, here we examined four different DTPB models. 
Among them, DTPB model-2 is better in terms of 
RMSEA and chi-square. It also explains how potential 
users’ intentions are influenced by significant paths of 
attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural 
control, regarding their decomposed antecedents. DTPB 
model-2 was statistically significant for our proposed 
antecedent of utilitarian products, which improves our 
understanding of users’ perceived behavioural control 
regarding e-readers; however, the hedonic product was 
not found to be significant. Users appeared to be more 
focused on the utilitarian aspects of e-readers rather than 
their hedonic aspects, rendering the latter statistically 
insignificant to our results. 
This paper is organized as follows: the next section 
focuses on the literature review and the theoretical 
background. Then, we conceptualize the research model and 
propose our hypotheses. The subsequent section describes 
the research methodology and empirical findings. Finally, 
the study discusses the implications of the research in terms 
of theoretical and practical contributions and provides 
concluding remarks with limitations and future research 
directions.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. e-Reader market in Japan 
In a recent edition of the eBook Journal, Yashio Uemura 
of Tokyo Denki University [8] laments that the current e-
book boom in Japan is in reality a boom in e-book seminars. 
This sense of frustration within the industry may seem at 
odds with its annual revenues, as reported by Impress R&D, 
of $600 million and growth in excess of 20% per year. These 
impressive numbers belie the fact that comics make up 75% 
of this revenue and that, apart from comics and magazines, 
there seems little significant advance in broadening the e-
book consumer base within Japan [9]. Currently, there are 
two e-reader devices in the Japanese market, the Sony 
Reader and the Biblio Leaf, which is available through the 
mobile retailer KDDI [10]. It is expected that the increased 
volume and richness of e-book content will spur the 
formation of new e-reader markets. As shown in Fig. 1, the 
e-reader market includes any device that can be used for 
reading, including tablet personal computers, such as the 
iPad [4]. 
B. e-Reader adoption models 
One of the important and significant issues related to IT 
is the identification of factors that cause people to accept 
new technologies and information systems and to use them 
[11]. Several relevant theories are offered, such as Theory of 
Reasoned Action [4], the Technology Acceptance Model 
(TAM) [12], the Theory of Innovation Diffusion [13], the 
TPB [5], and the DTPB [6]. In addition, Venkatesh, Morris 
et al. [14] developed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and 
Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. 
MA Jiah et al. [15] proposed a model that would test the 
TAM’s effectiveness in determining the influence factors on 
the acceptance and use of e-readers. Sungjoon Lee [116] 
examined the factors that lead to the adoption of the mobile 
e-book in South Korea. Jaemin Jung et al. [17] identified the 
predictors of e-reader diffusion with regard to consumer 
awareness, 
interest, and 
intention 
to use. Malathi 
Lectumanan et al. [18] have investigated consumer 
intentions of using e-books as educational aids by using the 
TAM. Brown [19] has developed a research framework 
demonstrating college professors’ and students’ acceptance 
of e-books and e-readers as a viable alternative to traditional 
paper textbooks, as well as their acceptance of these 
technologies for use in the classroom. Shih-Chun Chou 
[120] has compared pre-adoption and post-adoption beliefs 
to determinants of e-reader adoption and continuation. Bram 
Pynoon et al. [21] examined secondary school teachers’ 
acceptance of a digital learning environment (DLE) using 
the UTAUT model. Jung-Yu lai et al. [22] has explored the 
factors that drive users to use dedicated e-readers for 
reading e-books.  
However, no previous research has attempted to 
understand the behaviour of e-reader consumers by using 
the TRA, the TPB, and the DTPB. Here, these three models, 
that is, the theory of reasoned action, theory of planned 
behaviour, and decomposed theory of planned behaviour, 
are considered and compared in order to investigate the 
attitudes of e-reader users. In the next section, I explain the 
TRA, TPB, and DTPB models. 
 
Model 1: Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) 
This theory, developed by Fishbein and Ajzen [4], is one 
of the most important theories used to explain the human 
behaviours [23]. According to the theory, behavioural 
intention (to use a technology) is explained by people’s 
attitudes toward that behaviour and subjective norms.  
 
 Model 2: Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)  
Ajzen [5] developed the theory of reasoned action by 
adding the construct ‘perceived behavioural control’ into the 
model as a determinant of behavioural intention and 
behaviour. It determines the impact of three factors, which 
are ‘attitude’, ‘subjective norms’, and ‘perceived behaviour 
control’ on the tendency to behave in a certain fashion [6].  
 
Model 3: Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour 
(DTPB) 
The Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour was 
developed by Taylor and Todd in 1995 [6], as illustrated in 
Fig. 2. They developed the theory of planned behaviour 
through breaking down the structure of attitude, subjective 
norm, and perceived behavioural control [24]. This provided 
an increased ability to explain behavioural intentions and 
enable the accurate understanding of behavioural events 
[25]. According to the DTPB, individuals’ use behaviours 
vis-a-vis information technology are determined by their 
‘intention to use’. ‘Intention to use’, in turn, is determined 
by the attitude toward behaviour, subjective norm, and 
perceived behavioural control. Perceived usefulness is the 
extent to which a person believes using a particular 
technology will improve their job performance [26]. 
Perceived compatibility is the extent to which an innovation 
is consistent with the existing values, past experiences, and 
current needs of potential adopters [23]. Relative advantage 
occurs when the perceived advantages resulting from the 
use of a technology exceeds other alternatives [27]. While 
the theory of planned behaviour simply explains the 
relationship between the structure of beliefs and the 
prerequisite of intention, the decomposed theory of planned 
behaviour offer a comprehensive approach to understanding 
the factors affecting users’ intentions to use information 
technology [28]. Within this theoretical framework, 
complexity plays a significant role in the technology 
adoption decision, while there is a direct relationship 
between other features of model and behavioural intention 
[6]. 
Here, we use the DTPB model instead of the UTAUT 
model because the UTAUT model attempts to explain the 
relationship between perceived usefulness, ease of use, and 
intention to use as modified by age, gender, and experience. 
This model will be diversified more by demographic factors 
than belief factors. Additionally, as we wanted to focus on 
students’ behaviours as situated within an immature e-reader 
market, we did not use the UTAUT model.

Our research is an extended version of an unpublished e-
reader study [10] that used the basic DTPB model with 
limited sample size. 
C. Our proposed model 
With respect to e-reader research, MA Jiah et al [15] 
have shown in their technology acceptance model that there 
is a significant relationship among product features and 
perceived ease of use. Perceived behaviour control is that 
which refers to the perceived ease or difficulty of 
performing the behaviour [4]. Sanjukta et al. [7] have shown 
that the type of product is likely to be an important driver of 
PBC for internet shopping behaviour. Products can be 
classified as hedonic or utilitarian. These classifications are 
primarily intended to better understand how consumers 
search for, evaluate, choose, take delivery of, and consume 
different types of products [7]. Both hedonic and utilitarian 
products offer benefits to the consumer, the former 
primarily in the form of experiential enjoyment and the 
latter in practical functionality [7]. The hedonic products 
offered by e-readers are games, music players, voice 
recorders, etc. The utilitarian products offered by e-readers 
are calendar applications, contact list applications, and ｒ
eading Essentials (zoom/size, page jump, bookmarks, search, 
and auto page). Perceived behavioural control (PBC) 
reflects consumer beliefs regarding access to the resources 
and opportunities needed to perform a behaviour [6]. The 
type of product (e.g., e-books, music) featured on e-readers 
can be an important driver of consumer purchase behaviour 
[7]. Therefore, we hypothesise that both hedonic and 
utilitarian products have influence on PBC in the case of e-
readers and we add these antecedents to our proposed DTPB 
models. Figure 3 shows our proposed model with the 
addition of the new antecedents of hedonic and utilitarian 
products, along with the basic DTPB model used in 
previous studies [6], [10]. 
The same hypotheses (H1–H10) by Taylor et al. [6] and 
Koeder et al. [10] are included and illustrated in Figure 2. 
H11 and H12 are our proposed hypotheses for e-readers. 
The hypotheses are as follows: 
H11: That the hedonic products offered by e-readers 
positively affect perceived behavioural control. 
H12: That the utilitarian products offered by e-readers 
positively affect perceived behavioural control

METHODOLOGY 
A. Data collection 
 
Question Development 
In developed countries, including Japan, research has 
been conducted to develop initial models for the adoption 
and usage of these devices. For our initial qualitative 
research interviews, the survey items were adapted from 
previous studies [4], [6], [10] to develop our initial survey 
instrument. Items to measure behavioural intention, attitude, 
subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control were 
based on scales developed by Ajzen and Fishben [4]. Items 
to 
measure 
relative 
advantage, 
complexity, 
and 
compatibility were based on scales developed by Taylor et 
al. [6]. Facilitating condition and self-efficacy items were 
generated based on the work of Ajzen [5]. The survey 
instrument was pretested with students (N = 13) at the 
University of Tsukuba, Japan. Based on pretest results, 
items were revised to ensure reliability and the logical flow 
of questions. The pretest sample was not included in the 
final data set. 
Behavioural beliefs were adapted from the scale 
developed by Koeder et al. [10]. The scale included seven 
items on a 7-point range bipolar-scale: 1 = ‘strongly disagree’ 
to 7 = ‘strongly agree’. The attitudes toward e-readers were 
measured using a scale developed by Taylor & Todd [6]. The 
7-point semantic differential scales included the following 
sets: stupid/wise, bad/good, very bad/very good, very 
unimportant/very important. The other items were measured 
using a 7-point range bipolar scale (1 = ‘less likely’ to 7 = 
‘more likely’) adapted from Taylor and Todd [6]. Consumer 
demographic characteristics were measured for a descriptive

reading habits. 
 
Subjects 
Participation in the survey was voluntary and the survey 
instrument was developed using the software Qualtrics and 
was administrated online. The English version of the 
questionnaire was translated to Japanese. This has been 
checked to ensure its accuracy. The students of the 
University of Tsukuba, Japan, were selected as the 
population of interest. Students comprised our sample 
because it is mainly students who are, or will be, the primary 
users of e-readers for reading, convenience, and information 
access. In an effort to determine the intention of students to 
adopt e-readers as tools, a survey was conducted towards the 
end of 2011. With a total of 164 completed responses 
obtained, 151 usable data sets were analyzed to describe the 
hypothesised paths using structure equation model.

RESULTS 
A. Descriptive statistics 
A proﬁle of the respondents who participated in this 
study is displayed in Table 1, which shows that 24.4% of the 
responding students were female and 75.6% were male. 
B. Reliability and validity 
We have tested the Cronbach α coefficient for our 
research, a reliability coefficient of the measured value of 
questionnaire items for each construct from the point of view 
of internal consistency, which is used to verify whether each 
item shows common parts. If the coefficient is 0.7 or more, 
the internal consistency of the measurement scale is 
considered to be high and its reliabilities are adequate. The 
coefficients for each factor are shown in Table 2. Since all 
values exceed 0.7, the items in this intention model are 
judged to have shown common parts [29], which render the 
model acceptable for exploratory research [30]. Test items 
with lower values than 0.7 have been excluded.

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a visual 
representation that specifies the model’s constructs, indicator 
variables, and interrelationships. CFA provides quantitative 
measures of the reliability and validity of the constructs. In 
order to check the properties of the measurement scales, we 
conducted CFA to assess reliability, convergent validity, and 
discriminant validity. In order to assess the reliability of all 
the measurement scales, we calculated composite reliabilities 
(CR) for internal consistency and average variance extracted 
(AVE) for construct convergence for each construct by using 
the formula proposed by Fornell et al. [31]. The 
recommended value of CR is suggested as 0.7 by Hulland et 
al. [32]. A marginal but acceptable AVE value is 0.4 or 
higher, as has been reported and used in marketing literature 
[33], [34], [35]. In addition, we calculated AVE that exceeds 
the squared intercorrelations (SIC) of the construct with 
other constructs in the model in order to ensure discriminant 
validity [32]. CR, AVE, and SIC for each construct of the e-
reader are shown in Table 3 where AVE > SIC, AVE > 0.5, 
and CR > 0.7. Therefore, we may be able to conclude that 
the reliability of the constructs developed for the e-reader 
was acceptable.

C. Model fitting test 
Fit statistics, including chi-square, normed fit index 
(NFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), 
goodness of fit (GFI), and adjusted goodness of fit (AGFI), 
AIC, and BCC were used to assess model fit. An omnibus 
cut-off point of 0.90 has been recommended for GFI. For 
GFI, it is generally accepted that values of 0.90 or greater 
indicate well fitting models [36]. A value of about 0.08 or 
less for the RMSEA would indicate a reasonable error of 
approximation [37].   to degrees of freedom ratios in the 
range of 2 to 1 is indicative of an acceptable fit between the 
hypothetical model and the sample data [38]. With 
parsimony ﬁt measures, such as the AIC and the BCC, 
smaller values of these criteria indicate a better ﬁt of the 
model [39]. In explanation, the total coefficient of 
determination (TCD) R2 for the structural equations has 
shown in this study. The fit statistics and the R2 values for 
each are shown in Table 4. These results indicate a 
preference for DTPB model 2.  
 
Theory of reasoned action 
In Table 4, the statistics indicate that the TRA model 
provides a measurable fit to the data.    to degrees of 
freedom ratio is 3.56, GFI = 0.90, AGFI = 0.82, CFI = 0.90, 
AIC = 186.87, BCC = 130.55, RMSEA = 0.13. In terms of 
predictive power, the variance in all dependent variables are 
R2BI = 0.17, R2AU = 0.32, respectively. The path 
coefficients are as hypothesised in each case (p > 0.05 in all 
instances). Attitude and subjective norm are a significant 
determinant of behavioural intention. A further significant 
determinant of actual use is behavioural intention. 
 
Theory of planned behaviour 
In Table 4, the statistics indicate that the TPB model 
provides slightly same fit to the data as the TRA fit. 
However, there is a slight improvement in the fit and the 
explanatory power of behavioural intention.   to degrees of 
freedom ratio is 2.61, GFI = 0.88, AGFI = 0.82, CFI = 0.90, 
AIC = 127.55, BCC = 192.19, RMSEA = 0.1. In terms of 
predictive power, the variance in all dependent variables is 
R2BI = 0.20 and R2AU = 0.32, respectively.  
The path coefficients are as hypothesised in each case (p > 
0.05 in all instances). Attitude, subjective norm, and 
perceived behaviour control are significant determinants of 
behavioural intention. A further significant determinant of 
actual use is behavioural intention. 
 
Decomposed Theory of planned behaviour 
We have conducted four DTPB models in order to 
establish the best-fit index. The four DTPB models are as 
follows: 
DTPB-1 (with FC): DTPB model with the path of facilitating 
condition perceived behavioural control.  
DTPB-2 (with UTI): DTPB model with the path of utilitarian 
product  perceived behavioural control. We have tested 
these two paths individually because they have a correlation 
of 0.49.  
DTPB-3 (with FC and UTI): DTPB model with both paths: 
facilitating condition  perceived behavioural control; 
utilitarian product  perceived behavioural control.  
DTPB-4 (without PBC): model without PBC construct. Here, 
this has low R2 = 0.02-0.03 as with some previous studies 
[10], [40].  
Among the four DTPB models, the better models are 
DTPB-1 and DTPB-2. For model 1,   to degrees of freedom 
ratio is 2.044, GFI = 0.761, AGFI = 0.713, RMSEA = 0.083, 
CFI = 0.848, AIC = 796.959, BIC = 960.047, BCC = 
798.877, and CAIC = 1023.047. For model 2,   to degrees 
of freedom ratio is 1.969, GFI = 0.77, AGFI = 0.723, 
RMSEA = 0.080, CFI = 0.86, AIC = 801.395, BIC = 
1009.588, BCC = 834.470, and CAIC = 1078.588. In terms 
of predictive power, the DTPB-2 explains attitude, subjective 
norm, and behavioural intention. The variances in all 
dependent variables are as follows: R2BI = 0.20, R2AU = 
0.31, R2ATT = .32, R2SN = .30, R2PBC = .02, respectively 
for model 2. The low R square value of PBC indicates that 
utilitarian products and facilitating conditions alone could 
not provide a powerful explanation of PBC. Mathieson et al. 
[40] found that PBC did have a significant relationship with 
behavioural intention, though it did not provide substantial 
explanatory power. 
In Figure 4 and Figure 5, the path coefficients are 
significantly positive in each case (p > 0.05 in all instances) 
for DTPB-1 and DTPB-2. Attitude, subjective norm, and 
perceived behaviour control are significant determinants of 
behavioural intention. A further significant determinant of 
actual use is behavioural intention. Normative influence is 
significantly related to SN. Self-efficacy and hedonic 
products do not significantly and positively influence PBC. 
However, utilitarian products are significantly and positively 
related to PBC in model 2 and facilitating conditions are 
significantly and positively related to PBC in model 1. Taken

together, utilitarian products and facilitating conditions do 
not give a good fit for model 3 as because they have 
correlation = 0.5. Attitude, subjective norm, and PBC are 
positively and significantly related to behavioural intention. 
Behavioural intention is positively and significantly related 
to actual usage for both DTPB models 1 and 2.

DISCUSSION 
This study compared the T R A ,  TPB, and DTPB 
models with the extension of product characteristics. The 
aim was to provide useful and interesting results that 
demonstrate the best model for predicting consumer 
behaviour with regard to the adoption of e-readers, thus 
helping e-readers’ developers refine their strategic planning 
and enhance their competitive advantage with a better 
understanding of the constructs that influence consumers’ 
behavioural intention. We adopted reasonable fit and 
explanatory power to evaluate these models and to determine 
which version was best [6]. The findings of the study show 
that the decomposed theory of planned behaviour model 2 
better predicts the users’ intention to use e-readers than do 
other models (although there is no big difference in the 
goodness of fitness index of the DTPB model 1 and 2). The 
R2 for each dependent construct is used to assess predictive 
power. The decomposed TPB model-2 has explanatory 
power for behavioural intention, attitude, and subjective 
norm and perceived behavioural control. 
Based on the findings, we examined the following ten 
hypotheses: from H1 to H8, H10, and H12 (attitude  
behavioural intention; subjective norm  behavioural 
intention; perceived behavioural control  behavioural 
intention; behavioural intention  actual usage; relative 
advantage  attitude; complexity  attitude; compatibility 
 attitude; normative influence  subjective norm; 
utilitarian product  perceived behavioural control). Two 
hypotheses, H9 and H11, (self-efficacy  perceived 
behavioural control and hedonic product  perceived 
behavioural control) were not supported. Our results are in 
agreement with the result of a previous study by Koeder et al. 
[10], apart from two hypotheses, H2 (subjective norm  
behavioural intention) and H10 (facilitating condition  
perceived behavioural control). In terms of H10, their model 
has the same component as our DTPB-1. DTPB-1 has the 
component of facilitating conditions and DTPB-2 has the 
component of utilitarian products. DTPB-1 is not much 
different from model-2, which has component facilitating 
conditions, as also shown by Koeder et al. [10]. Utilitarian 
products have correlations with facilitating conditions. 
Therefore, we tried these components individually for good 
model fit. 
In terms of non-agreement on H2 with Koeder et al. [10], 
their results showed that the subjective norm was negatively 
correlated with behavioural intention for e-reader consumers 
in Japan; however, our result is positively correlated. The

special role and importance of society in Japan has been 
discussed in several sociological publications [41], [42]. In a 
strong social culture such as Japan, it is reasonable to find 
that there are positive relations between the subjective norm 
and the behavioural intention to purchase or use e-readers. 
This finding is in agreement with other research: Taylor et al. 
[6], Sanjukta et al. [7], Paul et al. [43], Majali et al. [44], 
Ozer et al. [45], and Mathieson et al. [40] also found a 
significant relationship between SN and BI. 
In our study, the type of product is an important variable 
that influences consumer choices to purchase specific 
products (e-books, audio recordings, etc.). Hedonic products 
are not a significant predictor for the PBC variable but 
utilitarian ones are. This result coincides with the findings of 
Sanjukta et al [7]. In that study, they found that the Internet 
is used more for utilitarian product shopping. Consumers use 
e-readers when their main focus is on the functional 
attributes of products/services. E-readers offer various kinds 
of utilitarian products/services (e-books, applications and so 
on) to use or purchase, so this will change users’ beliefs 
regarding the opportunities that are needed to perform a 
particular behaviour. The absence of this construct represents 
barriers to usage of e-readers. Hedonic products were not a 
significant predictor for PBC variable, which is again in 
agreement with previous research [36] in case of Internet 
shopping 
behaviour. 
The 
absence 
of 
hedonic 
products/services (games, music and so on) may not, per se, 
encourage users’ intention behaviour. 
Here, we examined three adoption models: the TRA, 
TPB, and DTPB (4 different models) with extended 
antecedents (hedonic and utilitarian products). We chose 
DTPB-2 as the best model. Utilitarian products are a newly 
founded component of the model that can improve 
understanding of users’ perceived behavioural control 
regarding e-readers. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This study developed a model with the extension of 
utilitarian and hedonic products for explaining consumers’ 
behavioural intention to use e-readers. The results indicate 
that the decomposition of beliefs can provide additional 
insights into consumers’ behavioural intention to use e-
readers.  
To make e-readers more adoptable, their developers 
should pay attention to a number of important factors. This 
study, on the basis of empirical results, provides such 
developers with suggestions in three areas: (1) system design 
that makes reading more enjoyable (2) improved network 
facilities and (3) technological support aimed at increasing e-
reader acceptance among consumers. With more complex 
devices, such as Internet-enabled e-readers, it is essential that 
they are perceived as relatively easy to use and are 
compatible with their users’ current lifestyle [28]. E-readers 
should be designed in such way that technology is easy to 
understand and use. User-friendliness is essential to 
increasing users’ acceptance of e-readers. The newly found 
factor (utilitarian products) that influences Japanese 
consumer adoption of e-readers transforms users’ beliefs 
regarding the opportunities that are needed in order to 
perform a behaviour. Therefore, the absence of utilitarian 
products represents a barrier to greater adoption of e-readers. 
Users’ main focus is on the utilitarian products of e-readers 
rather than on their hedonic aspects. This finding will be 
crucial for the current and future development of e-reader 
devices. This paper will help to provide a better 
understanding of user perception of e-readers and what roles 
cost, connectivity, usability, and content play for users. The 
DTPB provides useful, easily understood, and relevant 
information for discerning consumer behavioural intention 
regarding e-reader adoption. 
VII. LIMITATIONS AND FURTHURE RESEARCH 
Our study was limited to student sample data. 
Furthermore, all respondents were from the same university. 
Future studies could collect data from people of multiple age 
groups and occupations, and/or from multiple universities, 
noting that there are correlations between utilitarian products 
and facilitating conditions. Further investigation into these 
interrelationships may help to better understand consumer 
behaviour towards e-readers. The explanatory power of PBC 
was low and further research is necessary.
