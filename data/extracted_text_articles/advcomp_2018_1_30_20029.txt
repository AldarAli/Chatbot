Abstract—Here, we give a short overview of hierarchical multi-
scale simulation methodologies for predicting structure-
property relations of macromolecular systems. In the first 
stage, detailed microscopic (atomistic) Molecular Dynamics 
(MD) simulations are performed. Various properties related to 
thermodynamics, structure and dynamics of polymeric systems 
are being examined at the atomistic level. In the second stage, 
our work involves an extension to a mesoscopic, Coarse 
Grained (CG) description of the simulated systems. Finally, 
CG simulations of larger systems and for longer times are 
performed. The proposed approach allows us to extend the 
simulated spatio-temporal scales of macromolecular systems. 
Keywords-Hierarchical modeling; Multi-scale; Molecular 
dynamics simulation; Coarse-graining. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Design and innovation in materials science requires 
nowadays the use of computer simulations. As the 
computational power continuously improves, it is possible to 
study, 
using 
molecular 
simulations, 
multiphase and 
nanocomposites systems with various applications in energy 
storage, biomaterials, elastomers, electronics,  etc. [1]–[3].  
By employing Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and 
having an accurate force field that is parameterized on 
quantum calculations, someone can reproduce the dynamics 
at bulk or interphases and extract information about 
interfacial properties. Nevertheless, the representation at the 
atomistic level does not always permit us to model realistic 
systems, due to the enormous range of length and time scales 
associated with complex macromolecular-based materials 
[1][4]. Therefore, the investigation of the structural and 
dynamical properties in complex molecular systems requires 
dimensionality reduction techniques. Such a technique is the 
Coarse Graining (CG), in which a group of atoms is 
represented as a CG super-atom. The CG level of 
representation allows the description of the involved 
structure and dynamics, and the temperature dependence of 
various properties, such as the density, the heat capacity, the 
viscosity, the modulus, etc., with fewer parameters [5][6]. 
Thus, hierarchical multi-scale computational methods can 
provide low cost tools for the industrial design of materials, 
but also for answering fundamental questions in soft matter 
science. 
Coarse graining can be realized as a procedure of 
mapping the microscopic (atomistic) space, determined by N 
particles,

of fewer M particles [7], i.e., q

and 
M<N. The probability of a certain macromolecular 
configuration in the microscopic space should be the same 
with the probability of the same configuration in the CG 
representation, 
in 
the 
mesoscopic 
space, 
thus 
the 
corresponding CG potential of the super-atom should 
incorporate the free energy of the building atoms.  
The n-body Potential of Mean Force (PMF) can be 
defined as [7]:

The first step towards the mesoscopic representation is 
the definition of the CG sites/super-atoms. Usually, in a low 
degree of CG, 5-10 atoms or 1-2 monomers constitute a 
super-atom [5][7]. The advantage of such a mapping scheme 
is that it retains the ability to predict properties at the 
atomistic level, while at the same time it is possible for the 
equilibrated CG system to re-insert atomistic detail following 
a back-mapping procedure [5]. An example of PolyStyrene 
(PS) mapping onto CG representation has been presented in 
[5][8] and is depicted in Figure 1.

In the next step, we are interested in the development of 
a force field that governs the CG simulation. There exist 
several methods that allow the derivation of the CG 
potentials, based on (mainly structural) data derived from 
detailed atomistic simulations. All of them are characterized 
by an observable Φ and a minimization over a set of 
parameters Θ (cost functions) [7]. In structural or correlation 
methods the observable is the pair radial distribution 
function, g(r). In the Force Matching (FM) or Multi Scale 
(MS) CG methods we focus on the description of the forces 
acting on a CG bead in order to reproduce the atomistic 
dynamics. Also, in the Relative Entropy (RE) approach the 
observable is related to the microscopic probability 
distribution [7]. 
For the intramolecular potentials that determine the 
internal structure of the macromolecule, in most cases we 
assume that they are described by the product of the 
probability distribution of each of the potentials [9]: 
P(l,θ,φ) = P(l)P(θ)P(φ) ,                              (3) 
where P(l), P(θ) and P(φ) refer to the distribution of the CG 
bond lengths, the angle between three consequent CG super-
atoms and the dihedral angle formed by four consequent CG 
super-atoms respectively. The probability is defined based on 
the Boltzmann factor:

, i = l,θ,φ.                       (4) 
Concerning the effective PMF (
Ueff
) that defines the 
non-bonded interaction in the CG level, several numerical 
methods have been presented in the literature [1][2][4][7]. 
The structure-based methods are the Direct or Iterative 
Boltzmann Inversion (DBI or IBI respectively) and the 
Inverse Monte Carlo (IMC) method [4]. The force matching 
techniques solve a typical least squares problem [10], while 
the relative entropy methods use stochastic optimization and 
Newton-Raphson approaches. In case of the interaction 
between a super-atom and a surface, the effective potential 
can be calculated at a fixed distance via the constraint force 
required to keep the bead at this specific distance [8]. The 
latter can be determined based on oligomeric chains and then 
used for the description of longer polymeric chains, i.e., 
higher molecular weights.    
In order to produce CG dynamics consistent with the 
atomistic simulation, one typical way is the use of the 
stochastic Langevin method [11] based on the equation of 
motion [9]:

where m is the mass of the particle a, Γ is the background 
friction and W is the statistical force of the heat bath. The 
use of a friction coefficient can allow us to correct the 
acceleration in the CG dynamics that is usually present due 
to the reduction in the degrees of freedoms compared to the 
atomistic representation [1]. 
The main goal of this work is to present the CG 
methodology focusing on polymer-based nanocomposites, 
i.e. a polymer matrix with nanoparticles or graphene as an 
additive phase. We intend to investigate the structural and 
dynamical properties at the polymer/nanofiller interface. The 
long relaxations times involved in such systems, even at 
temperatures well above the glass transition temperature (Tg), 
highlight the need for a mesoscopic approach. For this 
reason, the two stages of the hierarchical multi-scale 
methodology are elucidated. The first part includes atomistic 
simulations and the second part refers to the derivation of the 
needed CG force field for simulations at the mesoscopic 
level. As an example, a polyethylene (PE)/graphene 
nanocomposite is studied.  
In the Section 2a, we present the parameters that 
describe the simulation at the atomistic level of PE in 
confined conditions formed by the presence of a modified 
(carboxylated) graphene sheet. In Section 2b, we give details 
of the CG procedure concerning the derivation of the force 
field for the simulation of the PE chain. Moreover, in Section 
3, we present some preliminary results. The CG 
methodology is analyzed for the derivation of the non-
bonded interactions, in the case of bulk PE. We close with 
Section 4, where the conclusions of our study and future 
plans are mentioned.

METHODOLOGY 
A. Atomistic Simulation Details  
The parameters of the force-field for PE were taken 
from the TraPPE (Transferable Potentials for Phase 
Equilibria) all-atom model [12] and in the case of the 
functionalized graphene we used the combination of all-
atom OPLS (Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations) 
and a force field previously used for carbon structures (for 
more details see [13]). The bonds were constrained by 
LINCS (LINear Constraint Solver) algorithm [14] and the 
Coulomb cut-off [15] scheme with a cut-off distance of 1 
nm was applied to account for the Coulomb interactions. 
The nanocomposite system consists of one edge-
functionalized graphene embedded in an oligomeric 
PolyEthylene (PE) matrix. Each polyethylene chain contains 
11 monomeric units (11-mer, i.e., 22 carbons) and the 
number of chains in the systems has been adjusted to 
achieve 3.6 % weight percentage of the graphene nanofiller

in polymer. The size of the graphene sheet is 5x5 nm2 and 
its hexagonal lattice made of carbon atoms has been 
modified on the edges by attaching functional groups, 
namely either hydrogen or carboxyl groups.  
We use the GROMACS [15] simulation package to 
perform the simulations. The temperature 450 K was kept 
constant by the stochastic velocity-rescaling algorithm and 
the Berendsen barostat was applied to maintain the pressure 
of 1 atm. The time step was 1 fs and a typical production 
run was about 100 ns long. 
 
B. Coarse Graining Details 
In the case of the bulk PE system used for the CG 
simulation, a first level of CG representation was performed 
by the use of the united atom approach. Each methyl (CH3) 
and methylene (CH2) group along the chain backbone is 
treated as one interaction site [12][16]. Nonbonded 
interactions were described again by the TraPPE force field 
[12]. The atomistic bulk system consists of 420 chains of 
11-mer PE, at 450 K. 
In order to produce the CG force field that is consistent 
with the structure of the atomistic MD simulations, we have 
used the IBI method. The methodology is based on an 
iterative numerical minimization procedure having as target 
the extraction of an effective mean potential that agrees with 
the atomistic pair distribution function (
(
g ref )
). The CG 
potential is refined at each iteration according to following 
recursive relation [7]:

where c is a constant to ensure the stability of the iteration 
procedure. The criterion for convergence is whether in each 
iteration (i) the CG non-bonded distribution function 
g ( )i
 
matches the one derived from the atomistic run, within the 
numerical accuracy. Thus, the two-body potential of mean 
force, also converges to the (two-body) reference effective 
potential. The same procedure is also applied for the bonded 
part of the potential, based on bonded distribution functions.

RESULTS ANS DISCUSSION 
  In Figure 2, we present a snapshot of the simulated 
PE/graphene system in atomistic detail. At the edges of the 
graphene sheet we may identify the hydrogen and the 
carboxyl groups. The normalized density  as a function of 
the radial distance from the center of the graphene (data 
shown in [17]) indicates that at short distances close to 0.5 
nm, a peak in the density of PE is present. This is 
accompanied by an orientation of the polymer chains 
parallel to the graphene, similar to the behavior observed in 
different systems [18][19]. At longer distances, as we 
approach the edges of the nanosheet the density reaches 
bulk values. The results verify structural heterogeneities. 
Concerning 
the 
dynamical 
properties 
in 
the 
nanocomposite system, results based on the AutoCorrelation 
Functions (ACF) for the case of segmental (1-3 atoms 
vector) relaxation and the relaxation of the end-to-end 
vector (at T=450 K), are presented in Figure 3. The ACFs 
concern the whole nanocomposite system and confirm the 
different time scales that govern the relaxation at different 
length scales. The dynamical heterogeneities are expected to 
become more pronounced as the temperature decreases 
reaching values closer to the Tg (220 K [20]), where the 
diffusion is characterized by increased cooperativity [6].

By defining the coordination systems of the nanosheet, 
based on the eigen vectors of the gyration tensor, we can 
also study the dynamics in different layers from the surface 
[21]. The layers’ definition was based on the minimums in 
the density profile fluctuations. It is observed that the 
nanofiller also imposes a distribution in the relaxation times 
in layers parallel to to the nanosheet, that covers a wide 
range in the time scale (data shown in [8][21]). The 
adsorbed layer is characterized by adsorption/desorption 
times of the order of ms, while the bulk depicts 
decorrelation times close to ns. Because of this wide spread 
of time scales CG models could be of great importance.  
In order to give a general idea of the CG methodology, 
here we present new results on a 11-mer bulk PE, focusing 
on the derivation of the effective PMF for the non-bonded 
interaction. In Figure 4, we show the chosen CG mapping. 
Four united atom carbons build a super-atom. The non-
bonded pair distribution fuction of the CG beads, g(r), using 
the atomistic simulation data, is shown in Figure 5 as 
“target”.

Figure 5. Radial distribution function evolution in the IBI iteration 
procedure. 
Using the IBI method (5), we may determine the non-
bonded potential for the CG simulation. In Figure 6, we 
show the first estimation based on the DBI approach (first 
iteration), while the evolution of the CG effective potential 
and respective evolution of the g(r) are depicted by the same 
kind of lines in Figures 5 and 6. We may conclude that a 
convergence is succeeded at the 89th step of the iteration. 
The final CG effective potential is depicted with asterisks in 
Figure 6. It consists of a repulsive part at distances lower 
than 0.6 nm and an attractive part at further distances. A 
similar procedure is followed for the bonded potentials (not 
shown).  
Structure based CG models using a pair potential 
usually do not determine adequately the (long-range) 
atractive part of the effective potential and the virial 
pressure of the system, as the structure is more affected by 
the repulsive part of the effective pair potential [3][7]. 
Incorporation of ideas [6] concerning the temperature 
depedence of the cohesion energy at the super-Arrhenius 
region may lead to different approaches in the calculation of 
the effective potential that could allow the transferability in 
different temperatures and molecular weights.

g(r) in each iteration is depicted in Figure 5.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
 
In this work we have provided an overview of atomistic 
and coarse-grained simulations of macromolecular systems. 
A hierarchical description of such systems requires at the 
first stage an atomistic description, which was presented for 
the case of PE/graphene system. We have computed results 
concerning the structure and the dynamics of polymeric 
chains at the polymer/graphene interface. The results depict 
increased structural and dynamics heterogeneities in the 
nanocomposite system and underline the significance of CG 
modelling. Derivation of CG potentials that describe the 
non-bonded interaction were illustrated for the case of bulk 
PE chains. Moreover, we have presented ideas for the 
extension of the transferability and predictivity of such 
methods based on universal characteristics at the super-
Arrhenius region.
