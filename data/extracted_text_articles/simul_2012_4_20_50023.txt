to analyze ballistic characteristics. According to analysis of the 
whole trajectory simulation process of electromagnetic rail 
gun, the whole trajectory models including inner ballistics 
model and exterior model are developed to perform simulation 
task. Several simulation experiments are accomplished under

 INTRODUCTION 
Electromagnetic launch is a new concept in military 
technology, 
which 
utilizes 
electromagnetic 
force 
to 
accelerate the projectile and transform the electric energy of 
power into kinetic energy of launch package to complete 
many missions [1]. The system consists of energy storage 
devices, pulsed power, rails, armature, projectile and other 
related devices. Pulsed power, the core of Electromagnetic 
Rail Gun (EMRG), is controlled by adjusting the working 
state to perform charging and acceleration mission.  Pulsed 
power, composed of sets of high-capacity capacitor modules, 
thyristor switch, pulse-shaping inductor, crowbar diode, can 
generate very powerful instantaneous current pulse. When 
the rail is connected power, current flows into armature 
along one rail and flows back along the other to form close 
circuit. When strong currents flow along the two parallel 
rails, a great magnetic field, formed between the two rails, 
interacts with the current flowing through armature to 
generate powerful electromagnetic force. This force 
accelerates armature and projectile along the rails to the bore 
with high speed, as shown in Figure 1.  
EMRG has obvious advantages. Firstly, it has strong 
survivability and is very safe in application. Secondly, the 
launch velocity can be controlled by the magnitude of 
current to increase the shooting accuracy. Thirdly, it has low 
costs and allows continuous multi-shot. Lastly, the projectile 
shot from the bore with high initial speed can achieve wide 
range. 
 
Figure 1.  Principle of electromagnetic rail gun 
Currently, the development of electromagnetic rail gun 
mainly focuses on key components, such as pulsed power, 
rail, armature and projectile [2-4], while researches on 
ballistics performance, especially on whole-trajectory 
characteristics, are relatively weak.  
The Department of the Navy’s science and technology 
corporate board chartered the Innovative Naval Prototype 
(INP) construct to foster game-changing and disruptive 
technologies ahead of the normal requirements process [5]. 
This paper analyzes the whole trajectory simulation 
process of EMRG system and, the system requirements of 
EMRG simulation are determined. The ballistics model 
including inner ballistics model and exterior ballistics model 
is established. Then, the EMRG simulation is realized to 
perform the whole-trajectory simulation and analysis. 
II. 
WHOLE TRAJECTORY SIMULATION PROCESS 
OF EMRG SYSTEM 
There are five stages about the whole trajectory 
simulation process of electromagnetic rail gun system [6]. 
 --Firstly, discharging and attacking Stage: Pulsed power 
is charged by energy storage device and launching 
equipment prepares to launch. Projectile is pushed into the 
launching rails; Pulsed power discharges to supply 
appropriate powerful current, which generates a strong 
magnetic field between rails. 
--Secondly, projectile accelerating stage: The projectile is 
accelerated along the rails by the great Lorentz force. Due to 
the drag forces, the projectile and rails generate much heat, 
and the thermal aggregation causes the characteristic 
alteration of component material. 
--Thirdly, projectile flight stage: The off-rail projectile, 
affected by aerodynamic force and gravity, flies in 
atmosphere with high speed.

--Fourthly, attack completion stage: The projectile enters 
the target area and causes the attacking effect, so that the 
mission of single shot is accomplished.  
--Lastly, launching ending stage: The motion state of the 
projectile in the barrel is calculated, and analysis of the 
ballistics performance for rail gun is performed.

DEVELOPMENT OF EMRG SIMULATION 
MODEL 
A. Requirement of EMRG Simulation 
The functions of the electromagnetic rail gun simulation 
system include: 
Firstly, simulation system should simulate the launch 
process of the electromagnetic rail gun and the flight process 
of the projectile. 
Secondly, simulation system can manage the various 
simulation processes including inner ballistics process, 
exterior ballistics process and whole trajectory to meet many 
demands. 
B. Inner Ballistics Model of EMRG

C. Exterior Ballistics Model of EMRG 
When the projectile flies to the target, the projectile 
launched by EMRG is assumed to be a pellet with six 
degrees of freedom in the air. During the flight, the projectile 
with high speed is affected by the aerodynamics and gravity. 
In the study, we make assumptions that the effects of the 
aerodynamic heating and the earth’s rotation on the projectile 
are ignored. The dynamic and kinematic equations of the 
projectile in the air are expressed by (10)-(13).

EMRG SIMULATION AND RESULTS 
Simulation experiments are performed by utilizing the 
described model including inner ballistics model and exterior 
ballistics model to analyze the ballistics performance. In 
these experiments, length of rail is 3 meter, mass of 
projectile is 50 gram, and six capacitor modules are triggered 
to supply pulsed current. Some simulation results of position 
and velocity of projectile are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. 
It indicates that the velocity of the projectile is about 2095 
m/s and the launch time is 3.3 ms. Slope of the velocity 
curve is decreased to zero at the final stage in launch process 
and the shot out velocity achieved the peak value for this 
experiment.

The curve of discharging at 6 kv is shown in Figure 5. 
The performance of pulsed power is 1.1 ms flat-top pulse 
duration, 0.59 MA peak current and 0.22 MA residual 
current. The six capacitor modules are switched by thyristor 
in a certain time sequence to supply flat top current pulse, 
which makes the rising time of current reduced and the peak 
current increased greatly.

The simulation results of Lorentz force, friction force and

it is obvious that the Lorentz force proportional to the current 
plays a major effect and friction force is very small and 
stable during launch. The air drag force is relatively small at 
the initial stage of acceleration process, but it will increase 
dramatically with the velocity of the projectile.

The range of projectile is 6785 m and the flight height is

flight the projectile is descend in the air. To improve the 
exterior ballistics characteristics of the electromagnetic rail 
gun, decreasing departure angle is an effective way.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Some whole trajectory simulations for electromagnetic 
rail gun are proposed based on the development of whole 
trajectory simulation models of EMRG. The system can 
simulate the launching process and the flight process of 
projectile. The simulation result comparison to the real data 
will be done in the future work once the data of the prototype 
or existing system can be obtained. 
The application of the simulation system contributes to 
improve the efficiency of EMRG system designing and lays 
foundation for the ballistics integration design of EMRG in 
early design stage.
