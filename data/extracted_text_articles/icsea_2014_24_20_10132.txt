Abstract—This paper examines web accessibility compliance in 
a sample of universities in Thailand.  The Thai government has 
made a commitment to higher education and e-learning and 
has also signed on to the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities (CRPD).  This paper shows that the web 
accessibility does not appear to be adopted by the universities 
examined in this study, with minimal compliance to the W3C 
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0.  In particular, the 
Perceivable and Operable aspects of the guidelines seemed 
problematic in terms of the numbers of reported accessibility 
errors. 
Keywords-web accessibility, higher education, WCAG, 
evaluation.

 INTRODUCTION  
In the context of a web connected world, it falls to 
governments and organizations to focus on how they develop 
online information that is accessible to all, including people 
with disabilities. The World Health Organization (WHO) 
estimates that there are over 600 million people with 
disabilities living across the world moreover, some of those 
people experience barriers in accessing information and 
communication technologies [1]. As a result, countries such 
as Australia, the United States of America and Canada have 
developed and promoted web accessibility in their policies in 
order to minimize the barriers which prevent disabled people 
from participating in those societies. This paper examines 
accessibility in the Thai context, as the Thai government has 
made a formal commitment to the development of e-learning 
in Thailand as well as that of web accessibility. 
The Thai government has been a signatory to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
(CRPD) since 2007 [2]. In terms of the CRPD, the Thai 
government devotes significant resources to ensuring that 
people with disabilities in Thailand have equal rights with 
others. The Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons Act 1991 and 
the National Education Act 1999 were passed in order to 
improve learning opportunities of Thai students with 
disabilities [3][4].  However, research indicates that there is 
still a lack of educational facilities for students with 
disabilities in Thailand resulting from insufficient law 
enforcement and negative attitude of stakeholders [5]. 
Consequently, the needs of students with disabilities are not 
adequately supported through educational options. It is the 
belief of these authors, and of the wider literature that 
students with disabilities should be treated as equals, 
especially in the context of access to education suitable to 
their needs. As higher learning predominately takes place 
within a nation’s university sector, this research aims to 
investigate the accessibility of Thai higher education 
websites.  The rationale is that the level of accessibility of 
these university websites will in some small way reflect 
Thailand’s adherence to its own legal requirements for 
equitable access to higher education. 
II. 
RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
This paper examines the research questions of ‘what 
level of web accessibility is apparent in Thai universities 
against WCAG 2.0 guidelines’ and ‘against which aspects of 
the WCAG are the most issues seen’?  The paper will 
address these questions by examining a number of Thai 
university websites, looking at both the main university 
webpages and publically visible pages containing e-learning 
content.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Accessibility Guidelines 
Web accessibility is not a new concept and one can trace 
its origins back to the mid twentieth-century. The Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA) approved by the U.S. Congress 
in 1990 cemented protections against discrimination to 
Americans with disabilities. It guarantees equal opportunity 
for individuals with disabilities in terms of public 
transportation (in Title II), public accommodations (in Title 
III) and telecommunications relay services (in Title IV) [6]. 
The potential protections of the Rehabilitation Act, ADA and 
the popularization of the Internet support the need to make 
the web accessible [7].  
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created the 
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) on 7 April 1997 in order 
to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure the web for 
all [8]. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 
were created in order to promote the accessibility of 
websites. The WCAG 1.0 guidelines were released on 5 May 
1999 and were replaced with WCAG 2.0 in 2008. The aim of 
WCAG 2.0 is to increase the accessibility of websites for 
people with disabilities according to the four POUR 
principles [9].  
“Perceivable” means that web content and user interface 
modules must be offered to users in multiple formats in order 
645

ICSEA 2014 : The Ninth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

to meet users' perceptions. “Operable” means that the user 
interface and navigation components should be designed in a 
way that they work properly, especially in terms of assistive 
technologies. “Understandable” is about making websites 
understandable in terms of language levels, correcting errors 
and predictability. “Robust” refers to the capacity of 
websites to be interpreted by a variety of user agents. 
WCAG 2.0 is divided into 12 guidelines, which are 
classified according to three conformance levels (A, AA and 
AAA) in order to respond to the different needs of people 
with disabilities. Moreover, WCAG 2.0 concerns problems 
of interference on the use of the page by unsupported 
technologies through four critical failures:   
1. Checkpoint 1.4.2 Audio control - the control over 
audio is available to pause or stop. 
2. Checkpoint 2.1.2 Keyboard trap - keyboard focus 
can be moved throughout webpage. 
3. Checkpoint 2.2.2 Pause, stop or hide – providing 
the control over moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-
updating information which display more than five 
seconds. 
4. Checkpoint 2.3.1 Three flashes or below threshold 
– content must not flash more than three times in one 
second. 
WCAG claims that if a webpage does not meet those 
requirements, then people with disabilities will not be able to 
utilize the content of the given web page.  There is a body of 
literature which argues that WCAG 2.0 provides guidelines 
only, and that they are not definitive when it comes to 
deciding if a webpage is accessible or not.  However, this 
paper will be using WCAG 2.0 as the standard against which 
webpages will be evaluated. 
B. Web Accessibility Evaluation 
Automated tools are powerful evaluation tools for 
locating inaccessible elements in a website, however, relying 
on one tool cannot guarantee the accessibility of whole 
website [10]. The W3C provides a list of over 100 checkers 
in term of “Complete List Web Accessibility Evaluation 
Tools”, with these tools ranging from page-at-a-time 
checkers through to whole of site conformance evaluators 
[11]. Generally, automated tools are based around web 
accessibility standards and can typically be locally installed 
on a desktop environment, as a cloud service or as a local 
browser extension. One of the advantages of cloud based 
tools is that they do not platform specific as are most 
browser based plug-ins.  
Manual testing is an alternative method, though in most 
cases should be considered a complimentary method to 
automated assessment.  The evaluation of websites for 
accessibility requires human inspection moreover, W3C also 
recommends the combination of expertise and users in 
evaluation processes [12]. Automated tools are also 
troublesome in terms of presenting false positives and false 
negatives, issues that can usually be overcome by human 
evaluation.  Obviously, the trade-of is that an automated 
assessment can cover a lot of pages or an entire site in a short 
period of time, whereas human evaluations can typically 
address only a small number of the total pages in a site. 
C. Related Work 
The evaluation of web accessibility for top international 
university websites reported that the websites of universities 
across different countries and regions had accessibility 
issues [13]. The study utilized a multi method approach 
using four automatic tools and manual tests, with the 
websites being selected from Times Higher Education 
Ranking. By looking at the average accessibility errors, 
universities in Asia were the most inaccessible websites 
followed by North America, Europe and Oceania (Australia 
and New Zealand). Moreover, the results when examining 
university policy indicated that less than half of those 
policies provide specific technical actions for resolving 
accessible websites issues. This implies that university 
websites may not be reliable resources to find accessibility 
solutions.  
A study comparing the accessibility of one hundred 
universities’ website in The United States of America 
indicated that the university webpages failed to meet basic 
WCAG 1.0 guidelines, especially priority 2; moreover, the 
university homepages had the highest number of errors [14]. 
The authors suggest that universities should ensure 
compliance with web accessibility standards such Section 
508 and WCAG guidelines in order to support services and 
facilities available to students with disabilities. However, 
the study used the superseded WCAG 1.0 guidelines and an 
automated tool called “Test Accesibilidad Web (TAW)”. 
 A study of the accessibility of Spanish university 
websites demonstrated that there was low level of 
accessibility conformance on Spanish university websites 
with 95.50% of webpages failing to meet the UNE 139803 
[15]. The UNE 139808 is based on WCAG 1.0 and is the 
Spanish government’s policy document regarding accessible 
web content. Moreover, the study showed that over 60% of 
webpages failed HTML and CSS Validations. Again, this 
study use automatic tools, such as TAW, the W3C 
Validation Service and the W3C CSS Validation Service.  
The investigation of accessibility in 20 Finnish higher 
education‘s institutes websites revealed that the tested 
websites had low inaccessibility levels in priority 1 (14 
websites) and priority 2 (12 websites), followed by the high 
inaccessibility levels in priority 2 (8 websites) and the full 
accessibility level in priority 1 (6 websites) [16]. The study 
used TAW with the recommendations of Finnish Quality 
Criteria for web Services which is based on WCAG 1.0 and 
is published by the Finnish government. The authors 
suggest that those websites should be modified in order to 
achieve the full accessibility level (as defined in their 
study). 
Finally, a study evaluating web accessibility and 
usability at Thailand Cyber University (TCU) for totally 
blind users stated that none of the selected webpages met a 
minimum requirement of WCAG 2.0 in automated testing 
[17]. The author claims that TCU which is the biggest e-
learning provider in Thailand and that the entire website has 
endemic accessibility problems.

IV. 
RESEARCH DESIGN 
A. Scope of Investigation 
From the larger study on which this paper is based, nine 
higher education websites in Thailand were selected from the 
top five ranked Thai universities [18], two open universities, 
one special college for students with disabilities and one 
online institution. We chose this list as it offered a variety of 
institutions and delivery modes, from online only through to 
mixed mode and disability specific. Seven representative 
webpages were tested from within each of the university web 
sites, including the university homepage, library, webmail 
login page, contact us, e-learning portal homepage, e-
learning forums and publically available e-learning content. 
There is a significant body of literature regarding web 
accessibility auditing methodology, most of which indicate 
that common pages (that most web sites would have) should 
be evaluated as a priority. The Website Accessibility 
Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) 1.0 
also indicates that accessibility evaluation should include the 
common webpages of the target website such as homepage, 
login page and contacts page [19].  Moreover, homepage and 
level one (all links visible from the homepage) of a website 
are appropriate for accessibility auditing [20][21]. As this 
paper examined university web pages, an effort was made to 
audit pages from the university websites as well as any 
available e-learning content, which are typically housed in 
systems different to those containing the main university 
website.  The universities examined in this study represented 
a number of different types, including; 
• 
Common: primarily an on-campus teaching mode 
with some support for online delivery 
• 
Open: primarily an online institution, with some 
required on-campus delivery, such as exams and 
tests. 
• 
Online: a purely online teaching environment. 
• 
Special: mixed mode of delivery aiming at 
supporting students with a variety of disabilities 
The breakdown of the four groups in this study in terms 
of web pages (N = 189) examined by automated assessment 
is Common (105 webpages), Open (42 webpages), Online 
(21 webpages) and Special (21 webpages). 
B. Method 
A number of researchers suggest the advantages of 
combining automated and manual testing techniques in 
order to ascertain the level of accessibility of websites 
[12][22]. Automated testing is driven by those systems that 
can scan a web page or an entire site and report on the errors 
that can be tested without human intervention, such as 
issues with alt text, color contrast and markup validation.  
Manual testing sees ‘expert’ human evaluators examine a 
smaller subset of pages, looking at visual and coding 
elements to see where violations against WCAG 2.0 exist, 
as well as where actual usability issues may be apparent.  
The webpages were evaluated by automated and manual 
testing based on WCAG 2.0 guideline at level A and AA. 
SortSite [28] was used to audit all pages at level one of 
each of the websites (i.e., all pages linked from the 
homepage), whilst WAVE was used on each of the seven 
pages being examined (as WAVE is page-at-a-time tool) 
manually.  Manual evaluations were conducted for the same 
seven pages, and for each of the seven pages we counted the 
number of failures identified based on WCAG requirements, 
with the results being categorized by POUR principles.  
Table I shows the breakdown of WCAG 2.0 in terms of 
checkpoints, for A and AA only.  As Table I illustrates, the 
Perceivable principle contains the most checkpoints (and 
points of potential failure), with nine at level A and five at 
level AA, through to Robust with only two checkpoints at 
level A.

The scoring values are ‘0’ and ‘1’, with a ‘0’ score meaning 
that no violation of a checkpoint was identified using either 
the automated tools or via manual assessment. A score of 
‘1’ did indicate that the page in question produced a 
violation of a given WCAG 2.0 checkpoint.  Figure 1 shows 
an example of the data collection against the POUR 
principles using the various testing methods used in this 
research, being automated multi-page, automated page at a 
time and manual assessment.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The collected data was tested for normal distribution. The 
Shapiro-Wilk test was used and found to be non-normally 
distributed with p < .05 [30].  Therefore, the analysis used 
nonparametric tests for comparing the differences in the 
647

mean scores. The focus of the analysis was on the errors 
found overall as well as the distribution of errors across the 
POUR principles.

Table II demonstrates that there were statistically 
significant differences in mean scores of the webpages 
regarding POUR violations at Perceivable, X2 (3, N = 189) = 
12.89, p = .01, Operable, X2 (3, N = 189) = 10.95, p = .01 
however, there were not statistically significant differences 
in mean scores of the webpages regrading the course mode 
category at Understandable, X2 (3, N = 189) = 4.49, p = .21  
and Robust, X2 (3, N = 189) = 4.14, p = .25. It can be 
interpreted that there are differences in the mean scores of 
the webpages (in terms of errors) regarding POUR 
violations at Perceivable and Operable principles, but not 
Understandable and Robust principles, which could be 
caused by the lower number of checkpoints and thus lower 
number of potential error points available within these 
principles. A Post hoc test was conducted to determine 
which university groups are different (Table III).

By looking at the average errors in the POUR principle 
per page, most errors were found at the Perceivable 
followed by Operable, Understandable and then Robust 
principles. The Perceivable and Operable outnumber Robust 
violations, with almost double the number of errors. For 
example, the Common group had the average error at 
Perceivable (2.74 errors per page) and Operable (2.18) 
compared to Robust (0.75). This dataset indicates that most 
Thai institution websites have common accessibility 
problems related to providing information in multiple 
formats and lack awareness of control over the web 
interface (see Figures 2 and 3). By looking at the different 
course modes, the results indicate that the Special group 
performs the best in terms of web accessibility with the 
lowest numbers of errors at all POUR principles with 
average 1.22, 1.06, 1.17 and 0.33 respectively (see Table 
III). This may be because the special institutions are 
strongly committed to providing accessible resources and 
educational services for students with disabilities and is 
perhaps not surprising that those webpages contain content 
which is fit for purpose. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Breakdown of violations within Perceivable 
 
By looking at the Perceivable principle, the highest total 
numbers of errors were found at checkpoints 1.1.1-Non text 
Content and the checkpoint 1.3.1-Info and Relationships 
with 108 errors (see Figure 2). Furthermore, the highest 
number of errors were found at checkpoint 1.1.1-Non text 
Content with 69 errors (Common), 23 errors (Open), 9 
errors (Online) and 7 errors (Special) and the checkpoint 
1.3.1-Info and Relationships with 75 errors (Common), 17 
errors (Open), 10 errors (Online) and 6 errors (Special) 
respectively. This implies that most Thai institution 
websites have serious problems related to alternatives for 
non-text content and web structure and relationships (such 
as inconsistent use of heading styles to denote page 
structure).

Figure 3. Breakdown of violations within Operable 
 
By looking at the Operable principle, the highest total 
numbers of errors were found at the checkpoint 2.4.4-Link 
purpose with 96 errors (see Figure 3). The breakdown of 
errors at checkpoint 2.4.4-Link purpose were 64 errors 
(Common), 21 errors (Open) and 5 errors (Online and 
Special). The dataset indicates that the websites would have 
critical problems in terms of descriptive links, with the most 
prevalent issue being the ‘read more’ link issues, which 
users of assistive technologies find to be singly 
uninformative. 
 
 
Figure 4. Breakdown of critical failures 
 
By looking at the critical failures, most errors were 
found at the checkpoint 2.2.2 followed by 2.3.1, 2.1.2 and 
1.4.2 for all groups. The most errors were found at the 
checkpoint 2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide with 17 errors 
(Common), 6 errors (Open), 4 errors (Online) and 1 errors 
(Special) (see Figure 4). The dataset indicates that Thai 
institutions have problems involving the control over 
moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information 
which displays for more than five seconds – especially in 
terms of slideshows and carousels found on website 
homepages. 
Figure 5 indicates the total number of errors found 
across the nine university sites for the seven pages tested in 
each of those sites.  The results show that the university 
homepages had the most number of accessibility errors, not 
an uncommon finding in the literature [23][24] followed 
closely by the library pages.  This is due in part to the 
number of links, content and multimedia items that both of 
these pages tended to contain, with contact us pages being 
problematic due to poor form design (lack of labels) and 
that the correct page language was not indicated (having 
English instead of Thai).  Whilst the latter issue is not 
something every user would notice, lack of correct language 
identification for a page is an automatic fail of the 
Understandable principle, level A. 
 
 
Figure 5. Total violations across tested pages 
 
The e-learning pages that were tested tended to fair 
better than the main university pages due to their general 
lack of multimedia content, with most of the content being 
text based materials coming out of e-learning tools such as 
Moodle [29].  Content management systems such as Moodle 
also address WCAG 2.0 guidelines to varying degrees [25], 
which is likely to have also contributed to a slightly higher 
level of accessibility for these pages as opposed to the main 
university pages. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Whilst this paper represents the analysis of part of a 
larger research project, it does show that in terms of the Thai 
university system, there is still much work to be done in the 
web accessibility space.  The results indicate that these 
university websites have accessibility problems even though 
the Thai government has signed the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). In particular, 
special institutions were created to provide an accessible 
online learning experience for students with a variety of 
disabilities, though in this study it seems even the web pages 
in that site were far from accessible (though better than the 
other non-specialist sites).  
The limitation of this research is that the number of tested 
webpages is relatively small because there are only two open 
universities and one online institution in Thailand, which 
were examined in this study along with the top five 
universities.  Moreover, the limitation of scoring method is 
that is essentially a binary one or zero, picking up the 
presence of an error but not the specifics of the error (which 
will be detailed in the larger study).  However, we feel that 
649

ICSEA 2014 : The Ninth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

the data presented here indicates that Thai universities are 
not offering an accessible online learning experience to 
people with disabilities. Whilst the possible causes of the 
current situation are beyond the scope of this paper, it seems 
likely they are the same as other institutions across the globe, 
including lack of awareness, lack of policy and lack of 
WCAG 2.0 implementation, testing and knowledge [26][27]. 
We recommend that the Thai government strengthen its 
policy and requirements around accessibility of online 
technologies, and that this policy is clearly communicated to 
stakeholders in the government and education arenas.
