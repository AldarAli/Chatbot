Abstract— In this paper, a method to determine the 
configurational structure of a chain of atoms, based in the 
application of an electric field is proposed. This method gives 
the possibility to detect the existence and localization of 
dislocations and the presence of impurities inside the particle. 
This is a simple example of the so-called inverse problems, 
which consist in specifying the configuration of a system from 
the knowledge of the spectrum. On the other hand, in the so-
called direct problems, which are studied much more 
frequently in the literature, one must obtain the spectrum from 
the knowledge of the characteristics of the system. 
Keywords-quasiperiodic systems; electron states; Stark ladders.

INTRODUCTION  
The study of the electronic properties of materials that 
do not have translational symmetry has been a very active 
field in the last years. Among the important properties of 
these structures are: the Anderson localization, the fractal 
properties of the spectrum of the quasi crystals, etc. In 
particular, the discovery of the Anderson localization 
phenomenon of quantum mechanics [1] gave origin to one 
of the most important subjects in condensed matter physics. 
On the other hand, the systems whose structural order is 
described by means of deterministic sequences like those of 
Fibonacci [2], Thue-Morse [3], Godreche-Luck [4], etc. can 
be seen as an intermediate case between periodic and 
disordered 1-D systems. It has been observed that the 
electronic spectra of some of these systems are self-similar, 
and the energy bands divide into several sub-bands, each of 
which further subdivides into more sub-bands and so on [5-
7].  
Most of these studies have been direct problems in the 
sense that they begin with a given system, and then the 
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained. Here, we 
consider a particular case of an inverse problem [8]. We 
follow here the same path at the beginning, but then, we 
return to the characteristics of the systems and we establish 
a correlation between the configuration of the system and 
the characteristics of the spectrum. We show that the 
configuration of the systems considered here can be 
deduced from the knowledge of the spectra. The main idea 
is to employ the capability of the electric field to produce 
well-separated eigenvalues. In particular, if the systems are 
periodic, the electric field produces the well-known 
Wannier-Stark Ladders (WSL), which consists of a series of 
equally spaced energy levels appearing in the spectrum [9]. 
The distance between the neighboring energies is 
proportional to the field intensity. This property of the 
electric field allows the prediction of the approximate 
configuration of the imperfect crystal, in spite of the chaotic 
appearance of the spectrum at first view. 
The article is organized as follows: In Section II the 
model for a deformed crystal is described. The properties of 
the calculated spectra are discussed in Section III. Section 
IV is devoted to explain the main conclusions derived from 
this work.  
II. 
MODEL FOR THE DEFORMED CRYSTAL  
In order to show how an electric field can be used for the 
aforementioned objectives, we consider a one-dimensional 
crystal that has suffered a deformation under control.  Then, 
the structure of the spectrum is analyzed and a correlation 
between the structure of the particle and the spectrum is 
established. The electrified imperfect crystal is modeled as 
follows. Let us suppose that the potential for one electron in 
a 1-D system can be described by means of the following 
expression (see Fig. 1).

PROPERTIES OF THE SPECTRUM 
Briefly, in the following, we use the phrase "periodic 
system" or "locally periodic system" to denote a section of a 
periodic system inside the potential well of Fig. 1. For 
future reference, we start by discussing the well-known 
effect of an electric field on the spectrum of a periodic 
system. By means of the transfer matrix method, we have 
calculated the energies and the results which are shown in 
Fig. 2. The figure shows the evolution of the energy levels 
as a function of the electric field intensity f . Each line 
corresponds with an energy level. The characteristics of a 
similar spectrum were discussed many years ago in [11]. On 
the left of these figures, we see that all the levels are 
grouped in bands, as must be for f
 0,
 since in this case, 
the system is periodic. Each band in Fig. 2 has 8 levels, 
because the potential considered in the figure has exactly 8 
cells. 
It is easy to prove that the upper limit of the n th band 
of a finite periodic sequence is equal to the upper limit 
n
E  
of the n th band of the infinite Kronig-Penney model 
[12]. Furthermore, it is also equal to the n th level of an 
infinite

periodic structure with 8 cells (see inset) as functions of the electric field 
intensity. 
 
For the lower level of the n th band, there is not a 
closed expression, but it can be proved [13] that it is very 
close to the lower limit 
ne  of the n th band of the infinite 
Kronig-Penney model, which satisfies the following 
expression [12]

We have verified that 
1
E , 
2
E , 
1e and 
2e  obtained from 
these formulas are in agreement with the plotted values on 
the left sides of Fig. 2, where we have used p
 2.
 On the 
right of this figure (corresponding with the value 
f
 0.55
), the levels appear separated due to the presence 
of the electric field. We clearly see that all the levels coming 
from the first band appear equally spaced (except the two 
levels of the extremes that are a little more separated). This 
structure is precisely the WSL predicted by Wannier [6]. 
According to Wannier, the nearest-neighbor energy level 
spacing 
E
 is equal to pf . However, due to our systems 
being finite, the WSL are not perfect. So, the levels of the 
ladders are not exactly equally spaced. This is frequently 
more evident with the extreme levels of the ladders, as 
occurs with the first ladder of Fig. 2 at f
 0.55.
 If one 
neglects these two levels, the rest of the levels have a quite 
reasonable behavior. 
A superficial analysis of Fig. 2 could yield to the 
conclusion that the second WSL comes from the second 
band. However, this is not true. Indeed, a detailed analysis 
of the lines shows that the fifth level of the first band is 
bending at f
 0.44,
 giving rise to the first level of the 
second ladder, etc. However, because a fast view of the lines 
induce to consider that the n th ladder is generated by the 
n  th band, and in order to make the discussion of figures 
easier, we are taking this consideration valid. 
On the other hand, it is well known [12] that, for the 
case f
 0,
 the level density in each band is not uniform. 
In contrast, when f  is large enough and the WSL are well 
established, the level density is uniform for all values of f  
greater than a certain minimum value. As a consequence, 
the trajectories that the eigenvalues follow, as f  increases, 
are slightly curved lines in the region of small values of f , 
as can be verified with a detailed analysis of each trajectory. 
In the following, we analyze the effects of disorder. We 
show in the insets of Fig. 3 six configurations of potentials 
for the case f
 0.
 The inset of Fig. 3a shows a finite 
periodic potential with 8 wide cells and 8 thin cells 
distributed as

where 
w
C  represents a wide cell of length 
wl
 and 
t
C , a 
thin cell of length 
tl .  We are taking 
wl
 2,
 
tl
 1.
 
Therefore, the period p  is equal to 3 and the number of 
periods is equal to 8. The above sequence of cells can be 
constructed by assigning the sequence of blocks AAB  with 
the cells 
w
C  and the sequence AB  with the cells 
t
C . So, 
the block sequence 
 
AABAB AABAB AABAB AABAB AABAB     
AABAB AABAB AABAB   
 
 
(5) 
 
is equivalent to the sequence of cells (4). 
We now transform step by step the above periodic 
system into the system 
8
S , given by expression (2). In the 
inset of Fig. 3b, we have moved the eight thin cells to the 
right. For brevity, the corresponding configurations of cells 
and blocks are not written here. 
In the inset of Fig. 3c, we have dropped three thin cells 
and in the inset (d), we have moved one of the thin cells to 
the place that it must have in a Fibonacci sequence of 
blocks. In the inset (e), we have moved a second thin cell to 
the place that it had in a Fibonacci sequence. At the end of 
this process, we obtain the inset of Fig. 3f, which 
corresponds with the configuration of blocks given by the 
sequence 
8
S  of expression (2). 
The spectra associated with the insets of Fig. 3 are 
shown in the whole figures, respectively. The set of points 
at the left ends of the lines (at f
 0
) form the electronic

spectra associated with the potentials of the insets. The other 
points of the lines show, as before, the evolution of the 
energy levels as a function of f . 
On the left of Fig. 3a, we see at least two groups of 
levels which evolve into a complex structure when the 
intensity f , is increased. Since the system has a total 
amount of 16 cells, each band must have 16 levels. 
However, because each period has an internal structure 
consisting of the two cells 
w
C  and 
t
C , each band must 
have an internal structure consisting of two sub-bands, each 
of them having 8 levels. The 8 levels of lower energy shown 
in Fig. 3a are just the levels of the first sub-band of the first 
band 
1
B . The other 8 levels forming the second sub-band 
of 
1
B  are in the same zone as the first sub-band of the 
second band. The second sub-band of  
2
B  is not shown in 
the figure. The first sub-band must be associated with the 
wide cells, and the second sub-band with the thin cells. The 
first sub-band of 
1
B  generates the WSL shown by means of 
gross points on the right of the figure. 
As mentioned, at f
 0,
 the second sub-band of 
1
B  
overlaps with the first sub-band of 
2
B . In particular, one 
obtains that the upper level 
w
E2
 of the second band of a 
periodic system formed uniquely of wide cells is equal to 
the upper level 
t
1
E  of the first band of a periodic system 
formed 
uniquely 
of 
thin 
cells. 
Their

 as can be seen on the left of Fig. 3a. 
However, the 16 levels of this group evolve to form two 
different Stark ladders. One of them is due to the thin cells 
and the other to the wide cells. We have attached crosses at 
the right ends of the levels forming one of these Stark 
ladders, and arrows to the levels forming the other WSL. 
We observe that each level associated with a cross is always 
beside a level associated with an arrow. So, we have a 
composed ladder in which each of its rungs are indeed 
coupled closely together. The most important point here, 
according with the objectives of this work, is to observe that 
this distribution of levels is similar to the distribution of the 
cells, that is, a wide cell is always beside a thin cell. 
This last effect is shown more clearly in Fig. 3b, where 
we have put the 8 wide cells together and the 8 thin cells 
together, as depicted in the inset. On the right of this figure, 
we see a first WSL generated by the first band of the wide 
cells, with a nearest-neighbour level spacing of the order of 
1.1 at f
 0.55.
 However, for higher energies, we observe 
a more complicated structure. It consists in two WSL 
separated at distance S

 and each of them having 8 levels 
and 7 spaces. One can understand this characteristic if one 
observes that now the local period associated with the wide 
cells is equal to 2, and therefore, the levels associated with 
these cells must be separated a distance of the order of 1.1 at 
f
 0.55.
 Similarly, the local period associated with the 
thin cells is equal to 1, and therefore, their levels must be 
separated a distance of the order of .55 at f
 0.55.
 These 
two WSL ladders are separated one from each other because 
the cells are also distributed in that way. 
When one continues moving the other thin cells to the 
place that they have in the final sequence 
8
S , one gets the 
corresponding spectrum shown in Fig. 3f.  This figure 
shows a rather complex structure, which appears as chaotic. 
However, by using the reasoning above discussed, it is easy 
to deduce the configuration of the cells produced by these 
spectra. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
We have shown that an external electric field can be 
used as a tool to establish a close correlation between the 
spectrum of a small one-dimensional disordered quantum 
system and its geometric configuration. We have taken 
advantage of the capability of the electric field to produce 
sets of equally spaced levels in the spectrum of a periodic 
system, that is, the WSL. This property allows us to analyze 
the evolution of the energy levels as the system becomes 
gradually disordered. In this way, we were able to explain 
why the levels acquire the observed arrangement in the 
disordered systems. The use of Fibonacci sequences, as a 
particular case of non-periodic structure, was not crucial and 
one can analyze any other type of disordered sequences, 
provided the amount of disorder is large enough. Since the 
WSL have been observed in three dimensional systems [14], 
the use of an electric field to analyze the effect of disorder 
in real three dimensional systems could be a real possibility.
