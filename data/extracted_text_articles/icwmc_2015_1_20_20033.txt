Abstract—Based on the cancellation and reinforcement of the
autocorrelation side-peaks and main-peak, respectively, this paper
proposes an improved unambiguous tracking scheme for com-
posite binary offset carrier (CBOC) signals used in the Galileo
system. Dividing the CBOC autocorrelation into multiple partial
correlations, ﬁrst, we obtain individual correlation components
making up the autocorrelation side-peaks and main-peak. Then,
we re-combine the components to cancel out the side-peaks,
and at the same time, to reinforce the main-peak, thus yielding
a correlation function with no side-peaks and a sharp main-
peak. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme
provides a signiﬁcant improvement in tracking performance over
the conventional schemes.

INTRODUCTION
Galileo is a European alternative global navigation satel-
lite system (GNSS) to the United States’ global positioning
system (GPS) [1]-[3], where the composite binary offset
carrier (CBOC) modulation has been adopted instead of the
conventional phase shift keying (PSK) modulation, since the
CBOC provides a higher signal tracking accuracy and an
efﬁcient bandwidth sharing capability [2]. The CBOC signal is
generated as a weighted sum of two kinds of sine-phased BOC
signals, and in this paper, we consider the CBOC(6,1,1/11)
signal used most widely, where ‘(6,1,1/11)’ means that the
CBOC signal is generated as a weighted sum of the sine-
phased BOC(6,1) and BOC(1,1) signals with a power split ratio
of 1/11 (i.e., the power of the sine-phased BOC(6,1) accounts
for 1/11 of the whole CBOC signal power) [4][5].
The major problem in the CBOC signal is ambiguity
in signal tracking caused by the multiple side-peaks of the
CBOC autocorrelation function, i.e., the tracking loop may
lock on one of the side-peaks. Thus, various schemes [6]-
[12] have been proposed to alleviate this problem. [6]-[8]
proposed unambiguous tracking schemes for the BOC signal,
and so, they are not appropriate for the CBOC signal. In
[9], a side-peak cancellation scheme applicable for the CBOC
signal was proposed; however, its tracking performance is
worse than that of the CBOC autocorrelation. [10] and [11]
proposed autocorrelation side-peaks cancellation schemes for
the CBOC signal using various auxiliary signals; however, the
improvement in tracking performance over the conventional
autocorrelation is not signiﬁcant, and also, the auxiliary signals
increase the system complexity. Although [12] proposed a
tracking structure for the CBOC signal that does not use
the autocorrelation, and thus, is free from the side-peaks,
†Corresponding author
it has a much worse tracking performance than that of the
autocorrelation-based tracking.
In this paper, we propose a novel unambiguous CBOC
signal tracking scheme providing a signiﬁcant improvement
in tracking performance without any auxiliary signal. We
ﬁrst divide the autocorrelation function into multiple partial
correlations, and then, we perform a re-combining process with
the partial correlations to yield a correlation function with
no side-peaks (unambiguous) and a sharp main-peak (good
performance). In numerical results, the proposed scheme is
found to offer a much better tracking performance than those
of the conventional schemes.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II,
we describe the CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal model. In Section III,
we present the proposed scheme. In Section IV, the tracking
error performances of the proposed and conventional schemes
are compared, and in Section V, conclusion and future work
are presented.

The aim of this paper is to propose a novel correlation
generator yielding an unambiguous correlation function with
a sharp main-peak. We ﬁrst observe that the autocorrelation
side-peaks arise due to changes in the CBOC sub-carrier value,
and then, to remove the value changes, we divide the CBOC
sub-carrier into 12 pulses, each of which has a duration of
Tc
12 = Ts, which are called partial sub-carriers and are used as
locally generated sub-carriers instead of the CBOC sub-carrier.
Thus, the CBOC sub-carrier can be expressed as the sum of
the partial sub-carriers, i.e.,
ci
sc(t) =

where pi
m(t) is the mth partial sub-carrier for the ith PRN code

autocorrelation function can be expressed as

function height.
A. Removing ambiguity
First, we focus on C0(τ) and C11(τ) to remove the ambi-
guity. From Figure 3, we can observe that C0(τ)C11(τ) > 0
for |τ| ≤ Tc/12 and C0(τ)C11(τ) = 0 otherwise.
Thus, we can obtain an unambiguous correlation function
by the arithmetic property |x| + |y| − |x − y| = 0 for xy ≤ 0
and |x| + |y| − |x − y| > 0 otherwise, i.e., an unambiguous
correlation R0(τ) can be obtained as
R0(τ) = C0(τ) ⊙ C11(τ),
= |C0(τ)| + |C11(τ)| − |C0(τ) − C11(τ)|,
(7)
where A ⊙ B denotes |A| + |B| − |A − B|.

B. Narrowing the correlation function width
Even though the side-peaks are removed completely by (7),
we can make R0(τ) narrower by using the remaining partial
correlations. From Figure 3, we can observe that the half-width
of R0(τ) depends on the zero-crossings of C0(τ) and C11(τ).
Thus, to reduce the width of R0(τ), we generate the following
two correlations
T0(τ) = (C5(τ) − C6(τ)) ⊗ R0(τ),
T1(τ) = (C6(τ) − C5(τ)) ⊗ R0(τ),
(8)
where A⊗B denotes |A+B|−|A|, which have smaller zero-
crossings than those of C0(τ) and C11(τ), and we obtain a
narrower correlation
R1(τ) = T0(τ) ⊙ T1(τ),
(9)
which is narrower than R0(τ) as shown in Figure 4.
C. Elevating the correlation function height
To make the correlation function sharper, and consequently,
to improve the tracking performance, we combine the partial

and its generation process is described in Figure 5. The
proposed and conventional correlation functions are depicted
in Figure 6 (note that [12] is not a correlation-based scheme
and so does not have a correlation function), where we can
see that the proposed correlation function is the sharpest with
the height and half width of 1.475 and 0.013Tc, respectively,
and thus, we anticipate that the proposed scheme provides an
improvement in tracking performance over the conventional
schemes.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have proposed a novel unambiguous
CBOC signal tracking scheme providing a signiﬁcant improve-
ment in tracking performance. Dividing the CBOC autocorre-
lation into multiple partial correlations, ﬁrst, we have obtained
individual components making up the autocorrelation side-
peaks and main-peak, and then, re-combining the individual
components, we have canceled out and reinforced the side-
peaks and main-peak, respectively, and have generated a cor-
relation function with no side-peaks and a sharp main-peak.
In numerical results, it has been conﬁrmed that the proposed
scheme has a much better tracking performance than those of
the conventional schemes. In future work, we will investigate
design parameters affecting the width and height of the cor-
relation function, thus allowing us to adjust the sharpness of
the proposed correlation function according to system design
requirements. In addition, we will discuss the performance of
the proposed scheme in multipath environments in terms of
the multipath error envelop.
