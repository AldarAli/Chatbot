Abstract— 
Many 
eye 
diseases, 
such 
as 
Diabetic 
Retinopathy (DR), can lead to blindness without early clinical 
diagnosis, and it is extremely important to take the necessary 
measures before it is too late. A reliable system to detect such a 
disease in an early stage would be a great addition to the health 
care providers. In this paper, a comparative analysis of different 
classifiers was done for the classification of the DR dataset using 
different machine learning classification algorithms, such as, 
Naïve Bayes, J48, Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient 
Decent (SGD), Logistic Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron 
(MP), Simple Logistic (SL) and Logistic Model Tree (LMT) 
classifiers, and to measure the classification accuracy, the Area 
Under Curve (ROC), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Square 
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for classifying the DR 
dataset. The results showed that the Logistic Regression 
classifier outperformed all other classifiers in the classification 
of the DR dataset for a classification accuracy of 74.8914%, area 
under curve ROC = 0.831, and RMSE = 0.4061. Then a 
sensitivity analysis for MP classifier was investigated in term of 
changing its learning rate. Also, a feature extraction method was 
performed on LR, MP, SL and LMT classifiers to evaluate the 
classification 
performance 
after 
selecting 
the 
relevant 
attributes, and the results showed that an accuracy of 72.3719% 
can be obtained to predict a DR case using Multilayer 
Perceptron by only applying a combination of up to 8 attributes 
instead of 19 attributes of the full dataset.

INTRODUCTION 
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), along with other eye’s 
diseases, can lead to blindness without early clinical 
diagnosis. DR has a preclinical phase that can not be observed 
by potential patients, and such phase would be extremely 
important to take the necessary measures before it is too late. 
A reliable system to help health care providers to detect such 
a disease in an early stage would be a great addition to the 
available tools for the health care providers. Many researchers 
applied number of data analytics tools, as the model proposed 
in our paper, to classify or predict similar diseases, and to help 
doctors to identify these diseases on early stages. DR dataset 
has its own fair share from data analytics, and some of their 
work in this regard is presented in what follows.  
Authors in [1] presented a screening of DR dataset using 
computer aided tools, and a reliable automatic screening 
system was proposed in [2][3]. Regression of DR dataset was 
shown in [4], and a computerized DR analysis was developed 
in [5], where pattern recognition techniques were presented in 
[6]. Authors in [7] used feature selections techniques to 
classify retina images, and analysis of screening systems was 
presented in [8]. Reliable detection techniques were presented 
in [9]-[12], and the role of bright lesions for DR grading with 
positive outcomes was investigated in [13], where retina 
image-level recognition was presented in [14]. A novel 
proposed screening algorithm was presented in [15], which 
was an extended algorithm with added pre-screening 
techniques proposed in [16]. Feature extraction was also 
suggested in [17], and minimizing energy cost between DR 
images was proposed in [18]. Machine learning classification 
algorithms to classify DR dataset using different classifiers 
were presented in [19]-[23], and deep learning was also used 
to classify DR dataset [24]-[26]. Decision making for 
automatic screening was proposed in [27]-[29], and prediction 
methods were applied in [30][31], and segmentation was 
applied in [32] to produce an efficient framework, and K-
mean clustering was used in [33], and segmentation of none 
layers boundary for DR images was presented in [34]. Early 
detection of DR using deep learning for classification was 
proposed in [35], an ensemble based machine learning model 
for DR classification was presented in [36], and an 
automated analysis of retinal images 
for 
detection 
was 
presented in [37]. 
In this paper, a comparative analysis for the classification 
of the DR dataset using different machine learning 
classification algorithms, such as, Naïve Bayes, J48, Random 
Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD), Logistic 
Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MP), Simple 
Logistic (SL) and Logistic Model Tree (LMT) classifiers, 
were used to measure the classification accuracy, the Area 
Under Curve (ROC), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Square 
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for classifying the 
mentioned dataset. A sensitivity analysis for Multilayer 
Perceptron classifier was investigated to study the change of 
performance of the classifier in term of changing its Learning 
Rate parameter. Last, a feature extraction method was 
performed using Classifier Subset Evaluator on some

classifiers, such as LR, MP, SL and LMT, to measure the 
quality of the generated subsets in order to evaluate the 
classification performance after selecting the relevant 
attributes per selected classification algorithm. More details of 
these statistical tools used can be found in [38]. The 
importance of this study is to find the most suitable classifier 
to classify the DR dataset to help healthcare providers in early 
diagnosis of the DR cases, and to provide a subset DR cases’ 
prediction based on the selected features per classifier. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains 
Introduction and Preparation of the DR Dataset, Section 3 
introduces classification methods, Section 4 discusses 
methodology, and results and discussion are presented in 
Section 5, and Section 6 presents conclusion and future work.

INTRODUCTION AND PREPARATION OF THE DIABETIC 
RETINOPATHY DATASET 
Retina images can be found in the literature and Table 1 
shows some samples of these images, where the raw images 
are shown in the second column, and the Vessel and MSF 
Vessels are shown in the third and fourth columns 
respectively.

This DR dataset used in this paper contains features 
extracted from the Messidor image set presented in Table 2, 
and this dataset is used to predict whether an image contains 
signs of diabetic retinopathy or not as examples seen in Table 
1. The original dataset contains 1052 samples and 20 attributes 
(features), including the class attribute, and 611 cases with DR 
and 540 healthy samples. All presented features are converted 
from the mentioned dataset and can be seen in [3][39][40].  
Table 2 contains the attributes and their given values, 
based on the preformed test. If we take the first row as an 
example, the binary values of the first attribute, denoted by 0 
and 1, indicate if the image has a bad or sufficient quality, and 
if we take the second row as another example, the binary 
values of this attribute, denoted by 0 and 1, indicate if the 
image of the retina lacks or has a retinal abnormality,

will be used in our analysis, in which they will be used for

model performance comparison for different classifications 
algorithms to classify the DR dataset. 
A. Logistic Regression 
We can consider the following logistic model to explain 
this algorithm and to see how the coefficient can be estimated 
form data. Given two predictors in the model 𝑥1 and 𝑥2 and a 
binary class𝑌, then a linear relation between 𝑥1 and 𝑥2 and the 
log-odd of the response of  𝑌, 𝑝 (𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑌),  is given 
by: 
𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑏
𝑝
1−𝑝 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝑥1 + 𝛽2𝑥2  
 
(1) 
and this method is used to estimates 𝛽𝑖 that can be used for 
prediction of the true and false values. Such model performs 
best when data separation is available in term of the positive 
and negative values of the data set elements. 
B. NaiveBayes 
Given the Bayes theorem: 
𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) =
𝑃(𝐵|𝐴)𝑃(𝐴)
𝑃(𝐵)
  
 
 
(2) 
For a given elements A and B and their probability of 
occurrence 𝑃(𝑋) is calculated, and such a theorem will be 
used to perform the classification. So for independent features, 
the mentioned theorem would perform a direct multiplication 
of the probability of each feature happening.  
C. Decision Tree (DT) 
A decision tree model is a model that runs number of 
comparison questions to divide the dataset into different 
smaller sets based on a given questions (Boolean for instance), 
and it keeps repeating the task with different set of questions 
for different level of the available subsets until it covers all 
available attributes in the dataset. We can have different type 
of decision tree classifiers based on the nature of the provided 
questions and their decision rules and based on the nature of 
the data set.  
a. 
Decision tree J48 is a special case and it is used for a 
unified variable associated with the dataset.  
b. Logistic Model Tree (LMT): which are classification 
trees with logistic regression functions at the leaves. 
D. Random Forest (RF) 
Random forest classifier is a collection of multiple random 
trees classifiers and usually an average of all trees 
classification results will be combined to give the performance 
of the random forest classification. Randomness is introduced 
to these trees in two different aspects: 
a. 
Random number of rows for each tree containing the 
original dataset element  
b. Random number of columns, or decision branches, 
for each tree 
E. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) 
Gradient descent is an algorithm that optimizes many loss 
functions, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and 
Logistic Regression models, and is usually used to optimize 
the linear function, and the stochastic concept is introduced 
here based on the roots finding nature of the optimization task. 
F. Multilayer Perceptron (MP) 
A class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), 
and it utilizes a supervised learning technique called 
backpropagation for training for instances classification. 
G. Simple Logistics (SL) 
Simple Logistics (SL) is a binary classification model with 
logistic transfer function of the conditional probability of the 
realizations of the output variable, which is assumed to have 
linear combination of the input variables. 
IV. METHODOLOGY 
In this paper, different mentioned classification algorithms 
were used to compare these classifiers’ performance in term 
of the classification of the mentioned DR dataset. For each 
classifier, a detailed results will be presented to compare these 
classifiers in terms of their classification accuracy, MAE, 
RMSE and ROC to select the best classifier that can be used 
to classify the DR dataset. Then a feature extraction method 
was performed using Classifier Subset Evaluator to measure 
the quality of the generated subsets in order to evaluate the 
classification performance after selecting the relevant 
attributes per classification algorithm, where a partial set of 
the full attributes will be selected for the prediction of the DR 
cases instead of using the full features of the original dataset. 
Figure 1 shows the workflow for the two used methods.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
This section shows the results of the performance of the 
classification of the DR dataset using different classifiers, as 
mentioned earlier, as well as the performance of the MP 
classifier with some tuned parameter, mainly its learning rate, 
and at the end, a feature selection method on the available 
dataset was applied for DR prediction.

classification of the DR dataset for a classification accuracy 
of 74.8914%, area under curve ROC = 0.831, and RMSE = 
0.4061, and it can be seen that the SGD classifier gives the 
best MAE results of an error value of 0.3093. Visual

Table 4 shows the result of the performance of the 
MP classifier to classify the DR dataset as changes of its 
learning rate occurs, and we can see that the best accuracy 
performance is for LR = 0.01, with an accuracy of 
73.4144%, ROC = 0.809 and RMSE = 0.4192, and Figure

different values of LR, and we can see that changing LR 
would have a small impact on the MP classifier for the 
classification of the DR dataset.

Classifier Subset Evaluator by applying a training 
classification data to estimate the accuracy of these subsets for 
all used classifiers on the DR dataset, and measuring the 
quality of the generated subsets in order to evaluate the 
classification performance after selecting the relevant 
attributes per classification algorithm, and the results of the 
classifiers are shown in Table 5, and a visual representation of 
the results are shown in Figure 6.

Absolute Error (MAE) and Square Root Mean Square Error 
(RMSE) for classifying the DR dataset, The results showed 
that the Logistic Regression classifier outperformed all other 
classifiers in the classification of the DR dataset for a 
classification accuracy of 74.8914%, area under curve ROC = 
0.831, and RMSE = 0.4061. Then a sensitivity analysis for MP 
classifier was investigated in term of changing its learning rate 
for the best performance for LR = 0.01, with an accuracy of 
73.4144%, ROC = 0.809 and RMSE = 0.4192. At last, a 
feature extraction method was performed on LR, MP, SL and 
LMT classifiers to evaluate the classification performance 
after 
selecting 
the 
relevant 
attributes 
per 
selected 
classification algorithm, and a reasonable accuracy of 
72.3719% can be obtain to predict a DR case using Multilayer 
Perceptron by only applying a combination of up to 8 
attributes instead of 20 attributes of the full dataset attributes. 
As an extension to this work, different types of classifiers can 
be included in the analysis, and more in depth sensitivity 
analysis can be performed on these classifiers, also an 
extension can be made by applying same analysis to other 
bioinformatics dataset and see the performance of these 
classifiers to classify these datasets.
