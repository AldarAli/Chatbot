Abstract—In future autonomous vehicles, drivers will be 
allowed to do anything else but driving. However, those 
autonomous cars may call the driver back to driving if all 
requirements for autonomous navigation are not met. 
Therefore, a call back sequence must be designed. The call 
back sequence must be efficient, as well as satisfying, in order 
not to annihilate the benefit of autonomous driving. Recent 
studies show the interest of using tactile channel for in-vehicle 
interfaces. In this study, we investigate the subjective 
contribution of vibrotactile signal instead or in addition to 
auditory modality for takeover sequences in an autonomous 
vehicle. We conducted a simulator survey on 41 subjects. The 
participants had to score their satisfaction and to evaluate the 
efficiency and some hedonic aspects of the sequence. According 
to the results, we recommend a multimodal signal for the 
takeover sequences in an autonomous vehicle. This must be 
confirmed with an evaluation of objective efficiency of the 
signal.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
During autonomous navigation phases, drivers can do 
anything they want but sleeping. Their attention may not be 
triggered by signals that may appear. According to NHTSA, 
level 3 of automation called “Limited Safe Driving 
Automation”, implies that drivers must remain available to 
intervene with comfortable transition time if all conditions 
necessary to allow autonomous navigation are not met (e.g., 
the vehicle leaves highway, etc.) [1]. To ensure a safe and 
comfortable transition, a sequence of call back signals must 
be designed. To date, there are no standards about those call 
back signals. 
Traditionally in an automobile environment, auditory 
and visual signals are used to convey information to the 
driver. However, many applications could benefit by using 
vibrations in the seat to transmit information [2], for 
instance lane departure warning [3][4], collision warning 
[4][5], hypovigilance alert [6], situation awareness [7], 
navigation [6][8], notifications [6][9] and even relaxing 
activities [10].  
Several studies reported pros & cons of using tactile 
modality in vehicle (see [11] for a review). Even though no 
reason is given, this modality is rarely used in cars [10][12]. 
According to Wickens’ multiple resource theories [13], 
tactile channel can convey information while auditory and 
visual channels are overloaded [14][15]. Firstly, a few 
studies reported that tactile modality has good alert 
properties. For instance, the reaction time decreases for a 
tactile or an auditory collision warning compared to a visual 
warning or no warning, or even an auditory warning when 
the driver is involved in an oral conversation [5][16]. 
Moreover, the tactile modality decreases the reaction time 
compared to the auditory modality for a navigation system 
and a Bluetooth hand-free system [6]. Secondly, depending 
on the context, the properties inherent to tactile modality 
can be relevant. For instance, tactile interactions are private, 
and subtle [17]. Furthermore, in most of the cases, it does 
not interrupt the current activity, which could let the subject 
choose the exact moment of interruption, and therefore 
reduce frustration. 
There are also some practical limitations of using tactile 
modality. Tactile interfaces can convey limited information. 
Yet studies showed the possibility to recognize 7 haptic 
icons during a high visual load task [18].  The best 
compromise between number of possible in-vehicle tactile 
alerts, and efficiency and adequacy of reaction, could be 
with only 3 different tactile alerts [19]. Finally, there are 
some situations that may adversely affect perception of 
tactile warning. Some drivers are wearing thick clothes, 
which could affect their perception of vibrotactile stimuli in 
the seat [2] even though this effect may be relatively low 
[20]. Also, ambient vibration could mask the signal’s 
vibrations [21][22]. Recent studies show the influence of 
attention, movement [23][24] and back pain [25] on tactile 
sensation. 
Acceptability 
studies 
show 
mitigate 
results 
for 
vibrotactile interfaces. For a collision warning, it has better 
scored including on items like “trust”, “overall benefit to 
driving” or “annoyance” [4]. Auditory warnings was clearly 
better accepted than tactile warning in the seat for a lane 
departure warning [3]. The subjective workload associated 
with a navigation system, and hand-free system were scored 
higher, and items like “quick to understand” or “easy to 
learn” were scored lower for tactile modality compared to 
auditory. This can adversely affect the acceptability of a 
tactile signal.  The satisfaction evaluation may be influenced

by the innovative nature of tactile feedback in the seat [6]. 
The meaning of the signal and the context may also have a 
great influence on acceptability. 
Multimodality is proposed to find a good compromise 
between efficiency and acceptability [26]. However, it has 
been shown to increase perceived urgency [8][27]. 
In brief, tactile modality shows interesting performances 
for in-vehicle interfaces, but it must be tested for each given 
application. In this paper, we focus on takeover notifications 
in autonomous vehicles. 
At least two types of evaluations are necessary to choose 
the most appropriate modality [28]: objective evaluation, on 
the measured performance, and subjective measure on 
acceptability. This study focused on the second one: we 
aimed to evaluate the subjective contribution of vibrotactile 
modality instead of, or in addition to auditory modality 
during a takeover phase in an autonomous vehicle. 
Moreover, we investigated on the relevance of a reminder: a 
second notification when half of the allocated time to take 
over has passed. 
To answer our problematic, we conducted a customer 
study, described in Section II. The results are presented in 
Section III and discussed in Section IV. Lastly, we give our 
recommendations and perspectives in Section V. 
II. 
MATERIAL AND METHOD 
To evaluate the signal in a realistic context, we conducted 
a customer survey in an autonomous driving simulated 
context. 
A. Products 
A takeover sequence, begins with a takeover notification 
one minute before the end of the autonomous driving mode. 
In our study, we used tactile modality, auditory modality or 
both. 
1) 
Tactile signal 
A haptic seat mock-up was created based on a 
commercialized seat (Renault, Espace 5). Several actuators 
were integrated in the seat backrest and cushion. The chosen 
actuators (voice-coil type, furnished by Lofelt) enable to 
independently set the frequency and the amplitude of the 
vibrotactile 
stimuli. 
Two 
preliminary 
studies 
were 
conducted before the present study: the first one aimed to 
define the right location of the actuators in the seat, and the 
second one aimed to define the pattern of the signal. 
The locations of the actuators were chosen after a 
preliminary 
experiment 
for 
which 
eleven 
subjects 
participated. The participants of this first preliminary 
experiment were chosen to ensure a diversity of morphology 
in the panel. There were 6 men and 5 women. Height was 
from 147 to 200cm (mean: 176; sd: 13), and Body Mass 
Index (BMI) from 18.4 to 30 kg/m² (mean: 23.3; sd: 4). The 
actuators’ locations allow an effective and acceptable 
perception of the vibration of each actuator, for all 
participants. Because we wanted to have a symmetric signal, 
and because it was not acceptable to place the actuators 
under the spine, they were set in two columns. 
The tactile signal was designed after a second 
preliminary study measuring detection and acceptability of 
16 signals. Those signals were designed based on a design 
of experiments, which enabled us to model detection rate 
and acceptability depending on signal characteristics. It was 
conducted on a large panel: 80 participants from 30 to 75 
year old (mean: 49; sd: 11), BMI from 17.7 to 53.5 kg/m² 
(mean: 26.2; sd: 5.4). This signal is above detection 
threshold and supposed to be well accepted (estimated 
satisfaction score: 8.3/10). 
2) 
Auditory signal 
In this study, auditory signals previously designed for 
partially autonomous driving studies [29] were used. We 
only used the signal designed for a takeover notification, 
which is the equivalent of the vibrotactile signal. The signal 
was previously used in a few customer studies and was 
never reported as disturbing. 
3) 
Takeover sequences 
Five different takeover sequences were tested (see Table 
1). Three are composed by a single notification occurring 1 
minute before the end of autonomous mode. The other two 
were composed by two notifications: the first notification 
occurring 1 minute before the end of autonomous mode, 
followed by a second notification when half of the time to 
take over has passed (Fig. 1). We used either vibrotactile 
signal, auditory signal or a combination of those two 
signals.

The study was conducted in a fixed-base simulator 
consisting of driver and passenger seats, steering wheel, and 
pedals (Fig. 2 a). The road was projected on a 60 inch

Machine Interface) were disposed on two screens. The first 
one was a 15’’ screen corresponding to the dashboard (Fig. 
2 b, Litemax®, SSD 1515 ENB G01).  The second was a 
10,4’’ touchscreen and corresponds to the central screen 
(Fig. 2 c, Litemax®, SLO1068 EGB I51). Visual interfaces 
related to autonomous system were developed to conduct 
autonomous driving studies at Renault. They remain the 
same for each takeover sequence. They continually display 
the state of the autonomous system (unavailable, available, 
activated, takeover notification, takeover required). The 
scenario was navigation on a highway road. The takeover 
notification was triggered by the experimenter without any 
scenario reason. The autonomous driving system used in 
this study was developed for an intern ergonomics study 
[30]. The simulation was generated using the simulation 
software SCANeRTM (v 1.4 ; Oktal), and the HMI were 
synchronized with the software RTMaps (v.4 ; Intempora).

C. Observers 
41 volunteers were recruited after an internet screening 
survey. This screening survey had two objectives: 
 
Recruit people without motion sickness and 
without negative opinion on testing autonomous 
driving. This way we avoid eventual rejection 
effect due to this particular technology. 
 
Selecting observers by the activity they declared 
they want to do during autonomous phases: 
observers had to choose an activity among three 
before the test: reading on a hard copy, working or 
watching a movie. We tried to form three 
equivalent groups of people performing those three 
activities: 15 participants were reading, 15 were 
watching a movie and 11 were working. 
The participants had to bring their own device or book 
with them for the test. We assumed that letting them choose 
and provide their own activity would give them more 
interest for the non-related to driving task (NRD) that they 
would perform during the autonomous driving phases, and 
therefore make the situation closer to the implication they 
would have in real situations. 
The volunteers were all employees working at the 
Technocentre Renault (Guyancourt, France). There were 39 
males and only 2 females from 21 to 60 years old (mean: 
40; sd: 12) and their body mass index varied from 14,5 to 32 
kg/m² (mean: 21; sd:4). They were unaware of the nature of 
the research, except the fact that it deals with autonomous 
driving. 
D. Procedure 
First of all, the autonomous driving HMI were explained 
to participants. Moreover, the autonomous driving interfaces 
were presented. The experimenter explained that when the 
first takeover notification rings, there is 1 minute left to 
takeover. He also explained that driver safety is ensured by 
the system anyway, even if the driver does not take over on 
time.  
After a familiarization phase with the autonomous 
driving HMI and with the simulator, the test procedure was 
explained to the participants.  
The session consisted of five tests. For each test, the 
participant started to drive, engaged the autonomous mode, 
focused on a “non-related to driving” task, and then, 
resumed the driving after the takeover signal of the current 
test. 
The current call back sequence was played before each 
test in order to make the subject identify the takeover 
notification. 
After each sequence, the participants had to fill a survey 
with a global satisfaction score and to score 9 adjectives 
relative to hedonic evaluation (“pleasant”, “soothing”, 
“stressful”, “frustrating”, and “disturbing”) and to perceived 
efficiency 
(“noticeable”, 
“stimulating”, 
“clear” 
and 
“efficient”). 
The test order was balanced among participants, using a 
Latin square design: each sequence was tested an equal 
number of times at a given rank.  
The test took about 1 hour per participant. The experiment 
lasted one month during the summer of 2016. 
III. 
RESULTS 
As the 41 subjects evaluated the 5 different sequences, 
there were 205 observations. 
A. Satisfaction scores 
We performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the 
satisfaction score with sequence, NRD task and presentation 
rank as explicative variables. The sequence does have a 
significant influence on satisfaction but NRD task and 
presentation rank do not (Table 2). 
There was no significant difference between the two 
unimodal sequences. The two unimodal sequences were 
worse scored than bimodal sequences. The reminder does 
not have any significant effect (Fig. 3).

The interaction type of sequence*NRD task and 
presentation rank had no effect on any adjective. In other 
words, the effect of the sequence was not dependent on the 
NRD task, and vice-versa.  
1) Influence of the sequence 
The sequence had a significant effect on the four 
adjectives about perceived efficiency (Fig. 4). For each, the 
score of the sequence with a single auditory signal was 
lower than the score of the other sequences. The reminder 
had no effect compared to single vibrotactile notification or 
a mixed single notification. 
The adjectives “pleasant”, “soothing”, “stressful”, 
“frustrating” and “disturbing” could not be explained with 
the chosen explicative variables.

2) Influence of the NRD task 
The NRD task had a significant influence on three 
adjectives about perceived efficiency: “stimulating”, “clear” 
and “efficient” (Fig. 5). For each adjective, the scores given 
by participants who were watching a movie were lower than 
the scores given by those reading. 
Moreover, the NRD task had an influence on one 
adjective related with hedonic evaluation: “frustrating”. The 
participants who were working declared to be less frustrated 
than those who were reading a book or watching a movie. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS 
41 people participated to the study, who were divided in 
three group of activity. Those groups were composed by at 
least 11 participants. This was sufficient to find significant 
results. Increasing the number of participant could enhance 
the differences. 
A. Effect of the modalites used in the sequence 
Previous studies show that vibrotactile modality has 
mitigate results in terms of satisfaction. The hedonic 
properties of a signal seem to be dependent on the 
application. In our case, i.e., takeover phase in an 
autonomous 
vehicle, 
the 
vibrotactile 
modality 
in 
combination with the auditory modality increases the 
satisfaction score. The presence of a reminder has no effect 
compared to a mixed single notification. Our data show no 
differences for the satisfaction scores between the tactile 
signal and the auditory signal. Those results may not be 
generalized to other tactile and auditory signals because the 
two evaluated signals were previously optimized.  
The vibrotactile modality in addition to, or instead of 
auditory modality increases the perceived efficiency. Most 
of the study show that tactile and auditory modality have 
comparable efficiency, unless in some cases including the 
driver involved in an oral conversation, where tactile alert 
has been shown to be more efficient [16]. We could assume 
that auditory background disturbs the efficiency of an 
auditory signal, but in our study, the interaction 
sequence*NRD task has no significant effect on the 
adjectives. Another explanation of the better perceived 
efficiency of tactile modality is the low familiarity of the 
participants with this kind of signal, whereas the automobile 
environment is full of auditory signals. 
B. Effect of the non related to driving task 
We found that watching a movie decreases the score on 
three adjectives related to efficiency. Two reasons could 
explain this. First, the auditory background of the movie 
disturbs the detection of the signals, regardless of their 
modality. Then the involvement of the subject in their task 
may be more important for those watching a movie than 
those working, which is consistent with the greater 
frustration of the first compared to the second.  
C. Limitations 
The 41 participants were mainly males with a low body 
mass index. The results should be validated with a more 
diversified panel, for instance, in terms of gender, age, body 
mass index. 
As those results were obtained in a low fidelity 
simulator, a validation in real driving situation, taking into 
account vibro-acoustical background, as well as real risk 
perception for the driver is needed. To evaluate the takeover 
sequence, it is crucial, that the participant feels in the 
position of the driver. Because, we did not have an 
autonomous vehicle prototype for the experimentation, we 
conducted the study in a simulator.  
It could also be interesting to reproduce the study with 
others tactile or auditory signals to evaluate the influence of 
the nature of the signal.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper focuses on the subjective evaluation of tactile 
modality in addition to, or instead of auditory modality 
during the takeover sequences in an autonomous vehicle. 
According to our results, we recommend the combination of 
vibro-tactile and auditory modality to improve the subject’s 
satisfaction as well as the perceived efficiency of the 
takeover sequence.  
Future studies must investigate on the objective 
efficiency of the five sequences, such as time to take over, 
situation awareness at takeover, in order to link the objective 
and the subjective evaluations.
