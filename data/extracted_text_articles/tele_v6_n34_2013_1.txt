Abstract—This paper proposes the design of an efficient 
optical-electrical-optical (OEO)-based remote terminal (RT) 
that can provide the higher power budget required for a long-
reach transmission in an asymmetric 10 Gbit/s Ethernet 
passive optical network (10/1G-EPON). The current 10/1G-
EPON specification supports a maximum physical distance of 
only 20km in a 32-way split due to a power budget limitation. 
However, many service providers prefer a transmission reach 
of over 40km in a 64-way split for an efficient access network 
design. In this paper, the proposed OEO-based RT provides 
quad-port architecture for a cost-effective design, supports a 
high power budget of 58 dB through 3R signal regeneration, 
and offers over a 50 km reach and 128-way split per port with 
no modification of a legacy 10/1G-EPON system. In addition, it 
can satisfy a packet loss rate (PLR) of 10-10 in the downstream 
and upstream paths. The current 1G-EPON RT included 
within this proposed 10/1G-EPON RT is being the pilot service 
at a large residential apartment over 2,000 subscribers.

 INTRODUCTION 
A 10 Gbit/s Ethernet passive optical network (10G-
EPON) is one of the fastest access technologies for providing 
next-generation ultra-broadband services to subscribers. In 
the current fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) optical access system, 
1 Gbit/s EPON (1G-EPON) is being extensively utilized, 
particularly in Asian nations, including Japan, South Korea, 
and China. However, with the recent growth of user traffic, a 
10G-EPON is expected to provide end users with a more 
comfortable online environment in the near future [1], [2]. 
The 10G-EPON specification was ratified as the IEEE 
802.3av standard in 2009, and supports two configuration 
modes: symmetric mode, operating at a 10 Gbit/s data rate in 
both directions; and asymmetric mode, operating at a 10 
Gbit/s in the downstream direction and 1 Gbit/s in the 
upstream direction [3]. Additionally, to reduce the costs for 
laying fibers and equipment, 1G-EPON and 10G-EPON use 
the same outside plant. In particular, an asymmetric 10G-
EPON (i.e., 10/1G-EPON) can be easily applied to the single 
family unit (SFU) market as a cost-effective next-generation 
solution, as its upstream transmission is identical to that of 
1G-EPON, and its downstream transmission relies on the 
maturity of 10Gbit/s Ethernet devices. 
The current 10/1G-EPON is defined into three classes of 
power 
budget: 
PRX10, 
PRX20, 
and 
PRX30. 
For 
compatibility with the PX10 and PX20 power budgets 
defined for a 1G-EPON, a 10/1G-EPON should mainly use 
the PRX10 and PRX20 power budgets. These power budgets 
support channel insertion losses of 20 and 24 dB, 
respectively. Therefore, a legacy 10/1G-EPON can support a 
physical distance of only 20 km for single mode fiber (SMF) 
in a 1:32 split ratio [4], [5]. 
However, many network operators worldwide have 
placed an increased emphasis on combining an optical access 
network with a metro network by consolidating their central 
offices (COs) through a long-distance EPON solution. This 
combination results in a considerable reduction in capital 
expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) 
budgets. In particular, EPON service providers require the 
high power budget to support long distances of 40 km and a 
high 64-way split. In addition, they hope to discover a 
solution satisfying the following key questions: how to 
leverage the EPON architecture in rural areas, how to further 
increase subscriber density in their COs, how to decrease the 
connection cost per subscriber, and how to serve more 
people at a larger distance from the COs using IEEE802.3 
EPON equipment [6]. 
To satisfy these requirements, we suggest the cost-
effective 3R-type optical-electrical-optical (OEO)-based 
remote terminal (RT) that can provide a higher power budget 
of a 58 dB in a legacy 10/1G-EPON without modification. 
We also demonstrate the performance of the OEO-based RT 
using a commercialized EPON optical line terminal (OLT) 
and 64 optical network terminals (ONTs) [1]. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, we briefly review related work, while in section 
III we describe the detailed structure and design scheme of 
the proposed OEO-based RT. In Section IV, we show 
experimental results proving the effectiveness of our method 
and provide an analysis of its performance. We also present 
the pilot service site for Giga internet service in S. Korea. 
Finally, we present a brief summary of our work in Section 
V.

RELATED WORK 
An extended EPON solution helps with network 
evolution, and reduces network levels and nodes from an 
increased high power budget. It can also provide significant

cost savings by reducing the amount of electronic equipment 
and real estate required at a local exchange. Moreover, it can 
support service to small towns, suburbs, and rural areas [7]. 
To achieve these purposes, the IEEE P802.3bk extended 
EPON working group is standardizing a new definition of 
the power budgets or reach extender solutions that can 
support a higher power budget [12]. Recently, several 
methods were suggested by the extended EPON working 
group. The first method is to define new power budget 
classes (i.e., PX30, PX40, PR(X)40) through an increase in 
the receiver sensitivity and launch power of the transmitter. 
The second method is optionally to use an extender box 
providing optical amplification (OA) or OEO for passing 
data streams. The final method is to decrease optical 
distribution network (ODN) loss through an improved 
splitter design [8-9].  
As a first option, the current extended EPON working 
group is focusing mainly on the physical media dependent 
(PMD) development of new power budget classes for 
application in the multiple dwelling unit (MDU) market, as 
many operators would prefer a completely passive solution. 
However, much of the market demand for high split ratios of 
over 1:64 also requires a 40 km reach through a high power 
budget of over 33 dB [13].  
Among the methods described above, only the use of an 
extender box can easily satisfy this requirement. In an 
extended EPON working group, the line cost and power 
consumption per subscriber are also primary considerations 
when designing a high power budget solution for a 10G-
EPON [10].  
 Figure 1 shows the 10G-EPON link structure ratified by 
the IEEE802.3av standard, and suggested by the IEEE 
P802.3bk extended EPON working group [3]. This 10G-
EPON can support a maximum transmission reach of 10 km 
in a 1:64 split ratio when using a PR(X)30 with a high power 
budget of 29 dB under worst-case ODN design scenarios 
without any problems, as shown in Figure 1-(a). An extended 
PMD solution is provided through the insertion of an optical 
amplifier within the transceiver, and can support a power 
budget of 33 dB using the newly defined PR(X)40 PMD, as 
shown in Figure 1-(b). A 10G-EPON using a PR(X)40 PMD 
can support a long distance of up to 40 km in a 1:32 split 
ratio without an extender box in the remote node, and can 
also support a high split ratio of 1:128 at the distance of 10 
km and  a very high split ratio of 1:256 within a very short 
distance of 2 km [11].  
However, an efficient 10/1G-EPON extender box 
solution supporting a cost-effective design, low power 
consumption, and a power budget of about 58 dB using the 
already developed legacy PRX30 PMD has yet to be 
reported. Therefore, to support a physical distance of over 40 
km and a greater than 1:64 split ratio under the worst-case 
ODN design scenarios without any problems, a 10/1G-
EPON must apply a remote terminal as an extender box 
utilizing an active device. Active in-field components are 
also acceptable to many operators. 
In this paper, our proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT 
can efficiently provide a high power budget of 58 dB using 
the following functions: bit-level 3R-based signal retiming, 
remote management through a simple network management 
protocol (SNMP) agent and an embedded ONT, and 
upstream burst-mode to continuous-mode signal conversion 
to support the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-
enabled reach extension.

PROPOSED OEO-BASED REMOTE TERMINAL FOR 
ASYMMETRIC EXTENDED 10/1G-EPON 
 Figure 2 illustrates the 10/1G-EPON link structure 
applied to the proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT in the 
remote office to support a long distance and high split ratio. 
A extended 10/1G-EPON system utilizing the 10/1G-EPON 
RT can provide a physical reach of over 60 km using an 
existing PRX30 PMD in the feeder fiber, and can support a 
1:128 high split ratio for a 10 km reach, respectively, using 
the legacy PRX30 PMD supporting the link budget of 29 dB 
under the worst-case ODN design scenarios without any 
problems.  
That is, when considering an optical fiber loss of 0.4 
dB/km, the extended 10/1G-EPON applied to our 10/1G-
EPON RT can easily support a high split ratio of 1:128 at a 
80 km reach from a central office to end users. This is 
possible to make the flexible access network configuration. 
The 
10/1G-EPON 
RT 
mainly 
provides 
wavelength 
conversion and a signal retiming function based on 3R-based 
signal regeneration between a 10/1G-EPON OLT and 
10/1G-EPON ONTs or 1G-EPON ONTs at the remote office.

In addition, it provides an optional upstream burst-to-
continuous signal conversion to apply continuous mode 
WDM solutions in the trunk fiber. In particular, because the 
10/1G-EPON RT is necessary for electrical power, it 
requires a remote management function and low-cost, low-
power design. The extended asymmetric 10/1G-EPON 
provides the transmission rate of 11 Gbit/s at a downstream 
direction and 1 Gbit/s at an upstream path the allows to 
access of the asymmetric 10/1G-EPON ONTs and 
symmetric 1G-EPON ONTs as shown in Fig. 2. 
Figure 3 shows the design architecture and quad-port 
prototype of the proposed 10/1G-EPON RT. The proposed 
10/1G-EPON RT is composed of a 3-port edge WDM filter 
for interconnection with the 10/1G-EPON OLT equipment, a 
single low-cost FPGA(Field Programmable Gated Array) for 
the retiming of a 1 Gbit/s downstream signal, an embedded 
ONT for SNMP packet transmission to the 10/1G-EPON 
OLT, a CPU processor providing SNMP for remote 
management, a burst-mode clock and data recovery (BCDR) 
device for retiming of the burst-mode upstream signals, a 
crosspoint switch (CS) device for electrical signal division, a 
1G-EPON ONU transceiver for receiving and transmitting a 
1 Gbit/s optical signal, a 10/1G-EPON ONU transceiver for 
receiving a 10 Gbit/s downstream optical signal, and a 
10/1G-EPON OLT optical transceiver for interconnection 
with the ODN [15]. 
The 10/1G-EPON RT divides a 10 Gbit/s wavelength 
into 1 Gbit/s wavelength channel using a 3-port edge WDM 
filter. These wavelength channels are then inserted into each 
EPON ONU transceiver, and an optical signal is then 
converted into an electrical signal. These electrical signals 
are retimed by an FPGA and 10 Gbit/s CDR in the electrical 
domain. The retimed signals then are retransmitted to the 
optical domain using a 10/1G-EPON OLT transceiver. In 
Figure 2. The extended asymmetric 10/1G-EPON link structure utilizing the proposed bit-level OEO-based RT.

contrast, the signal retiming for a 1 Gbit/s signal in the 
upstream is performed using a BCDR device, which then 
converts the retimed upstream burst-mode signal into a 
continuous-mode signal through the FPGA. 
The proposed 10/1G-EPON RT is designed using a quad-
port architecture, and provides a signal retiming function 
through a Virtex-5 FPGA (i.e., XC5VLX-30T) for lower 
design costs and power consumption. However, the signal 
retiming function for a 10 Gbit/s downstream signal is 
performed using a commercialized low-cost 10 Gbit/s CDR 
device. Each port of the 10/1G-EPON RT was also designed 
as a plug-and-play type. That is, the 10/1G-EPON RT can 
support a total transmission rate of 44 Gbit/s in the 
downstream and 4 Gbit/s in the upstream by using the 
cheaper solutions. 
To provide remote management of the 10/1G-EPON RT, 
an embedded ONT is activated using a 10/1G-EPON OLT 
system through a CS device, BCDR device, and FPGA. An 
embedded ONT is provided using a compact-type of 
commercialized 1G-EPON ONU MAC as shown in Figure 3. 
That is, the 10/1G-EPON RT is connected with a 1 Gbit/s 
data channel of the 10/1G-EPON OLT, and only port 0 of 
the 10/1G-EPON RT is supported.  
An embedded ONT receives a downstream signal 
through a CS device, and transmits an upstream signal to the 
10/1G-EPON OLT using a BCDR device and FPGA, as 
shown in Figure 3. This upstream signal is merged with the 
upstream signal of port 0. The CPU processor gathers and 
manages the status of the installed optical transceivers based 
on the SFF-8472 and FPGA through a local CPU interface. 
The CPU processor is also connected directly with a user 
network interface (UNI) port of an embedded ONT at the 
electronic domain using a CS device without an external 
optical tap (e.g., an optical splitter), which is unlikely to have 
been used in previous methods. The proposed 10/1G-EPON 
RT can use optionally as a hybrid-type remote terminal by 
replacing the 10/1G-EPON and 1G-EPON ONU optical 
modules with 10 Gbit/s and 1 Gbit/s coarse WDM (CWDM) 
optical modules. 
Figure 4 illustrates the internal architecture of the signal 
retiming logic within the FPGA based on a quad-port used to 
recover the 1G-EPON signals. Because the 10/1G-EPON 
OLT transceiver does not require a burst-mode reset signal, 
the 10/1G-EPON RT can easily provide a signal retiming 
function using the CDR within the FPGA for a downstream 
signal and the BCDR device for an upstream signal. 
In the downstream direction, the FPGA provides a 3R 
signal retiming using a recovery clock extracted from the 
CDR, which is included in the dual gigabit transfer protocol 
(GTP). The dual GTP extracts a 156.25 MHz recovery clock 
and 8-bit data from a 1.25 Gbit/s continuous-mode 
downstream signal using an external 156.25 MHz reference 
clock. This recovery clock is then used as a reference clock 
source necessary for an external BCDR device. On the other 
hand, in the upstream direction, the 10/1G-EPON RT 
performs a signal recovery using the BCDR device and 
transmits this recovered signal to an input serializer and 
deserializer (ISERDES) as shown in Figure 4. This burst-
mode parallel is transmitted the continuous-mode 1.25 Gbit/s 
to EPON OLT through the GTP block and BM-to-CM 
convertor [14]. 
Also, a burst-mode reset signal for the burst-mode 
upstream signal detection at a BCDR device is generated by 
a loss of signal (LOS) output from the 10/1G-EPON OLT 
transceiver. The BCDR device aligns with the input data 
within the 12-bit start of the preamble, and changes a 1-bit 
serial signal into a 4-bit parallel signal to provide the lower 
clock speed at the data transmission to the FPGA. The burst-
to-continuous convertor within the FPGA optionally changes 
a burst-mode signal into a continuous-mode signal through 
the insertion of a particular pattern (e.g., h’55 or 8B/10B 
idle) during a laser off time. 
In this paper, our proposed OEO-type 10/1G-EPON RT 
can provide low-power consumption and a cost-efficient 
design through a quad-port structure using a single cheaper 
FPGA and legacy cheaper EPON optical transceivers. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND RESULTS 
A. Experimental setup 
The experimental setup for a performance measurement 
of the proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT is shown in 
Figure 5. As there is no commercialized 10/1G-EPON 
systems at present, we used the existing 1G-EPON system 
and a 10 Gbit/s jig board for the performance test of the 
10/1G-EPON RT. The legacy 1G-EPON system generates 
downstream and upstream signals with a line rate of 1.25 
Gbit/s, while the 10 Gbit/s jig board transmits a downstream 
signal with a line rate of 10.3125 Gbit/s using a pulse pattern 
generator (PPG). 
For the 1 Gbit/s path link configuration, we used a single 
legacy 1G-EPON OLT and two 1G-EPON ONTs, and 
connected the trunk fiber using a 50 km SMF between the 
1G-EPON OLT and 10/1G-EPON RT. In addition, we 
configured a fixed 5 dB attenuator and 128-way split as the 
drop fiber between the 10/1G-EPON RT and 1G-EPON 
ONUs. For the 10 Gbit/s path link configuration, we also 
connected the trunk fiber using a 20 km SMF between the 10

Gbit/s jig board and 10/1G-EPON RT, as the 10/1G-EPON 
PMDs used in this experimental setup are unable to provide 
a transmission reach of 40 km owing to a dispersion problem. 
The 1G-EPON used optical modules supporting both the 
IEEE 802.3ahTM-2004-PX20 and PX10, while the 10/1G-
EPON RT used a 1G-EPON ONU optical module compliant 
with an IEEE 802.3ahTM-2008-PX20 supporting the link 
budget of 28 dB, and a 10/1G-EPON OLT/ONU optical 
module compliant with an IEEE802.3avTM-10/1GBASE-
PRX30.  
The 1.25 Gbit/s and 10.3125 Gbit/s optical signals 
generated were merged using a 3-port edge WDM filter, and 
then separated again into 1.25 Gbit/s and 10.3125 Gbit/s 
optical signals using a 3-port edge WDM filter in the 10/1G-
EPON RT. The 10/1G-EPON RT transmits the retimed 1.25 
Gbit/s and 10.3125 Gbit/s optical signals to the optical 
splitter via the 10/1G-EPON OLT optical module. The 
optical power budget in the trunk fiber is adjusted using a 
variable attenuator (VA) value. In this experimental setup, 
the insertion losses in the trunk and drop fibers are about -
12.8 dB and -26.8 dB, respectively. 
B. Optical eye digrams and analysis 
Figure 5 shows also the optical eye diagrams of each 
measurement point (MP) in the experimental setup link for 
the proposed 10/1G-EPON RT. Our 10/1G-EPON RT 
performs signal retiming using a recovery clock extracted 
through a 1 Gbit/s CDR within the FPGA and 10 Gbit/s CDR 
device, and this retimed signal is again recovered by the 1G-
EPON ONUs.  
In a 1.25 Gbit/s path, the downstream optical signal 
measured at MP1 is received by the 1G-EPON ONU optical 
module installed in the 10/1G-EPON RT through a 50 km 
SMF and two 3-port edge WDM filters. In an optical eye 
diagram measured at MP2 and MP3, shown in Fig. 5-(b), we 
can see a clear eye-pattern satisfying the optical eye mask 
adapted from the IEEE Gigabit Ethernet standard through a 
bit-level 3R-based signal regeneration. We can confirm that a 
jitter of about 31 ps is added by the signal recovery.  
In a 10.3125 Gbit/s path, MP5 shows the results of a 
transmission dispersion problem caused by the 20 km SMF. 
We can also confirm that the output optical eye diagram 
measured at MP6 satisfies the optical eye mask adapted from 
the IEEE 10.3125 Gbit/s Ethernet standard by the 3R signal 
retiming, as shown in Fig. 5-(c), although a slight amount of 
jitter is added. This means that is possible to support a 
transmission reach of over 20 km through our proposed 
10/1G-EPON RT, including a legacy 10G-EPON PMD in a 
10 Gbit/s channel. 
C. Packet transmission results and analysis 
Using a commercially available router tester (i.e., Agilent 
N2X), the performance of the proposed 10/1G-EPON RT 
was evaluated in terms of packet loss rate (PLR) through 
(a)

Ethernet frames with random lengths ranging from 64 to 
1518 bytes at a downstream and upstream path. We 
transmitted 1010 frames to two ONTs for the PLR test. 
Figure 6 shows the packet transmission results measured 
at the 1.25 Gbit/s path of the proposed 10/1G-EPON RT 
using a legacy 1G-EPON OLT/ONTs according to the VA 
value. Because a 1-Gb/s EPON OLT and ONU transceivers 
use an avalanche photodiode (APD) and a positive intrinsic 
negative photo-detector (PIN-PD), respectively, we can show 
that the upstream link budget increases by about 3 dB more 
than that of the downstream. 
Our experimental results confirm that the 1G-EPON 
system supports a physical distance of 50 km in a 1:128 split 
ratio using the proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT, and 
satisfies a loss-free service up to -29 dBm in a downstream 
path, and -32 dBm in an upstream path as shown in Fig. 6-(a). 
This means that the 10/1G-EPON RT is able to provide 
transmission service at a distance of about 50 km with a 128-
way split at PLR of the minimum 10-10, when we take into 
account a budget loss of a 0.4 dB/km in an optical fiber.  
Figure 6-(b) shows the result of a long-term packet 
transmission test of the proposed 10/1G-EPON RT. Over a 
66-hour period, we transmit a packet load of 19 % (i.e., 190 
Mbit/s) from an EPON OLT to each EPON ONT, and assign 
a packet load of 98 % (i.e., 98 Mbit/s) at each EPON ONT to 
measure the upstream PLRs, as a commercialized EPON 
ONT supports a Fast Ethernet port. From Fig. 6-(b), we can 
confirm the possibility of 1010 packet loss-free service in the 
downstream and upstream paths. 
D. BMT environment and analysis 
The 1G-EPON RT technologies included in the proposed 
10/1G-EPON RT are commercialized since last year and we 
have performed the benchmark test (BMT) to multiple 
system operators (MSOs) (i.e., CJ HelloVision) in S. Korea 
on October 2012. 
Figure 7 shows the experimental setup environment for 
the BMT of commercialized 16-port 1G-EPON RT platform 
with an existing EPON OLT and 64 ONU. For BMT, we 
configured a physical distance of 50 km with a 64-way split 
using a commercialized EPON OLT (i.e., Ubiquoss U9024a), 
64 ONTs (i.e., Ubiquoss C504L), and the 16-port 1G-EPON 
RT platform. We applied a 50 km service profile map 
applying a window discovery size of 40,800 (i.e., 40,800 x 
16-byte = 652 ms) and a maximum propagation delay time of 
15,625 (i.e., 250 ms) to the EPON OLT. 
As shown in Fig. 7, we configured a trunk fiber using 
two 20-km SMFs, a fixed attenuator of 10 dB and a VA to 
adjust the downstream signal power to -27 dBm in front of 
the 1G-EPON RT. For the drop section, we used a 10-km 
SMF, followed by a 1:4 optical splitter, and four 1:16 optical 
splitters. The loss budgets of the feeder and drop sections are

29.8 and 25.2 dB, respectively. 
Because the downstream throughput does not degrade 
depending on the transmission reach, at the only upstream 
path, we measured the maximum packet throughput that can 
be transmitted from one of the ONT and the average latency 
according to the traffic load in a single ONT. 
For the measurement of the maximum packet throughput, 
we transmitted the packet with random lengths ranging from 
64 to 1,518 bytes to only a single ONT. As shown in Fig. 8, 
although an EPON link at a back-to-back link (i.e., 0 km 
transmission reach) supports the maximum upstream packet 
throughput of about 920 Mbps, however, the extended 
EPON link of 50 km transmission reach utilizing the 1G-
EPON RT platform provides a maximum packet throughput 
of about 700 Mbps regardless of the number of registered 
ONTs. 
This is because of an an increased window discovery size 
(i.e., 391 ms) than existing window discovery (i.e., 261 ms) 
and an arrival time delay of the gate message (i.e., 300 ms) in 
order to allow 50-km reach. A maximum average latency is 
3.2 ms at a traffic load of above 80 % (i.e., 800 Mbit/s) , as 
the input packet rate is faster than the bandwidth allocation 
time. Therefore, when extending an EPON with a 1G-EPON 
RT, to support over a 50-km transmission reach, a greater

byuffer size should be considered at the ONTs to cope with 
the increased latency of Gate message. 
For performance analysis in actual environment, we 
transmitted 109 packets to 32 ONTs among 64 ONTs. Here, 
the downstream and upstream bandwidths per ONT were 
assigned about 30 and 28 Mbps, respectively.  
Figures 9 and 10 show the results of packet throughput 
measured at the downstream and upstream paths according 
to the traffic load with 32 ONTs. 
From the experimental results, we can confirm that the 
1G-EPON RT platform satisfies the packet throughput of 
100 % when traffic load is 96 % (960 Mbit/s) at the 
downstream path as shown in Fig. 9. On the other hand, at 
the upstream path, it can confirm that the 1G-EPON RT 
platform satisfies the packet throughput of 100 % when 
traffic load is 88 % (880 Mbit/s) as shown in Fig. 10. This is

because the packets are distribute to 32 ONTs. Therefore, the 
input packet rate at each ONT is lower than the asigned 
bandwidth allocation time from EPON OLT. 
From the experimental results, we confirm that it 
provides loss-free service during a 1.6 x 1010 and 1.48 x 1010 
packet transmission at the downstream and upstream path, 
respectively, when the received power at 1G-EPON RT 
platform is -27 dBm. Consequently, the extended EPON link 
based on the 1G-EPON RT platform can provide the 
maximum downstream bandwidths of 960 Mbps and 
upstream bandwidth of 880 Mbps similar to legacy EPON 
performance under the condition of packet loss-free. 
E. Pilot services and link structure 
The currently 16-port 1G-EPON RT had been installed 
with a DWDM solution at the feeder section to provide a 
Giga internet service at Gimpo area by Korean cable 
operator (i.e., CJ HelloVision) as shown in Fig. 11. The 1G-
EPON RT had commercial service at the main distribution 
frame (MDF) within Humancia apartment to accommodate 
2,234 subscribers, respectively, on December, 2012.  
Each port of 1G-EPON RT platform is connected to end 
users through a 1:64 optical splitter as shown in Fig. 11. 
Therefore, cable operator can support a bandwidth of 16 
Gbps per optical fiber, and reduce significantly the leased 
cost of the optical fiber using the designed a 16-port hybrid-
type 1G-EPON RT platform. 
F. Technical comparisons 
Table I shows the results of a technology comparison of 
10/1G-EPON using the proposed OEO-based 10/1G-EPON 
RT, a 10G-EPON standardized by IEEE802.3av-2009, and 
an extended 10/1G-EPON suggested by IEEE P802.3bk 
working group. As the table shows, with the exception of an 
active component used in a remote node, our proposed 
10/1G-EPON RT can provide greater efficiency with respect 
to power budget, distance and user accommodation, cost per 
subscriber, and long-distance trunk fiber costs. However, to 
make up for the weak point above, we adopted quad-port 
architecture at the proposed 10/1G-EPON-RT. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
We proposed and experimentally demonstrated an 
efficient bit-level OEO-based 10/1G-EPON RT based on 
quad-port architecture to overcome the physical limitations 
of a legacy asymmetric 10/1G-EPON system. We also 
confirmed that our proposed 10/1G-EPON RT can achieve a 
high power budget of 58 dB through 3R-based signal 
retiming using an existing 10/1G-EPON PMD without new 
PMD solution, and can be a cost-effective solution for an 
extended asymmetric 10/1G-EPON system.  
Our experimental results verified that the proposed 
10/1G-EPON RT can provide a distance of more than 40 km 
in a 1:64 split ratio, which many service providers desire. If 
10/1G-EPON PMDs use the PRX30 power budget class, the 
10/1G-EPON RT can be expected to support a reach of over 
80 km in a 1:128 split ratio with no modifications of the 
legacy 10/1G-EPON standard. 
In our future work, we will perform a feasibility test with 
either a commercial 10/1G-EPON OLT/ONTs, and apply 
WDM multiplexing to a trunk fiber with an asymmetric 
10/1G-EPON wavelength converter performing wavelength 
conversion between the EPON and WDM.
