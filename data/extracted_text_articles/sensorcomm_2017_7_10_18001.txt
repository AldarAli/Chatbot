Abstract—The advances in electronics allowed the develop-
ment of smart miniature devices called medical sensors, that
can collect physiological data from the human body and its
surrounding and send it wirelessly to healthcare providers in
order to help avoiding life threatening events. This article
presents a general overview on the types of medical sensors, their
properties, and the wireless technologies used to convey collected
data. Also, this article is the ﬁrst to provide a summary about
the wearable sensors’ brands available on the market, along with
their interface and connection types [1, 2].
Keywords—wearable sensors; body sensors; medical sensors.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are formed of small
computing devices called sensor nodes that can be implanted
in or placed around the human body. These intelligent sensors
collect physiological data from the body and send them wire-
lessly to medical personnel through personal devices like PDA
or smartphone, allowing continuous health monitoring of the
current state of the person to make proper decisions [3, 4].
There are two applications for sensor nodes: medical
and non-medical [5]. In medical applications, sensors collect
physical attributes from human body like blood pressure,
respiration, and temperature to detect any anomaly as early as
possible and take appropriate action before it is too late. These
sensors can be implanted in the human body (i.e. implanted
sensors), either under the skin or in the blood stream, to detect
abnormalities like cancer and cardiovascular diseases, or they
can be placed on the human body (i.e. wearable sensors)
to be used for disability assistance like fall detection and
blinds’ assistance in obstacles avoidance, and for performance
assessment like soldiers’ status evaluation in a battle and ath-
letes’ condition assessment during sports training, besides of
anomaly detection like asthma and heart beat problems. As for
non-medical applications, examples include emotion detection
applications, secure authentication, entertainment applications,
and non-medical emergencies through gathering data from the
environment and warning people in case of disaster or danger
like ﬁre or possibility of ﬂood.
There are numerous sensors used in medical applications.
Table I summarizes the most used sensors along with their
position [6]. Depending on their type, sensors are either placed
on the human body (wearable), or in the surrounding, or
implanted inside the human body. These sensors include the
accelerometer that is used to perceive the expenditure of
human energy, the artiﬁcial cochlea utilized for hearing aid,
the artiﬁcial retina used for visual aid, the camera pill deployed
to monitor the gastrointestinal track, the carbon dioxide sensor
used to measure the content of carbon dioxide from various
gas, the ECG utilized to detect heart diseases, the EEG used
to detect brain anomalies, and the EMG deployed to perceive
muscles and nerve cells problems. This is in addition to
many other sensors measuring blood pressure, humidity, blood
oxygen, pressure, respiration, and temperature.
These sensors face many challenges like self-calibration
requirements to adjust the sensitivity of the sensors based
on the environment where they are placed, low- maintenance
requirements, compatibility and interference problems induced
by integrating multiple sensors operating at different frequen-
cies and need to communicate between each other, and limited
energy resources [16].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The major
properties of sensors are presented in Section II; sensor wire-
less communication technologies are listed in Section III, and
a summary on the available sensors in the market is presented
in Section IV, to conclude in Section V.
II.
MAJOR PROPERTIES OF SENSORS
Since sensor nodes are small wireless devices placed on,
around and in the human body, and can capture various
physiological parameters, they usually have the following
properties [3]:
•
The size of the sensor nodes is very small (not
more than 1 cm3), thus the battery size inside
sensors is miniature and the energy available is
often restricted. Also, sensors are requested to serve
for a long period of time, and it is very hard to
86

replace sensors’ batteries specially when they are
implanted inside the human body. Therefore ﬁnding
ways to reduce energy consumption and to harvest
additional energy is always needed in medical sensors.
•
Sensor nodes are usually heterogeneous and require
different data rates, bandwidth, and energy resources
form the network depending on the type of data
they are collecting. Table II illustrates sensors’
heterogeneity
based
on
the
different
data
rate
requirements [5, 6]. The table shows that the data rate
can vary considerably from few Kbps to several Mbps.
•
There are no redundant nodes. All nodes have the
same level of importance and are added depending
on their need in the application.
•
Nodes have very limited transmit power in order to
avoid interference and to address health concerns.
•
Nodes should support self-organization and self-
maintenance characteristics since they are usually op-
erated by medical staff and not engineers. Once a node
is added to the human body and turned on, it should
be able to join the network and set up connections
without any involvement.
III.
SENSORS’ WIRELESS COMMUNICATION
TECHNOLOGIES
In general, there are three types of networks formed by the
sensors wireless communication [7, 8]:
•
In-body network communication: used for commu-
nication between wearable sensors, or between im-
planted sensors in the body and the receiver located
outside the body.
•
On-body network communication: used for communi-
cation between wearable sensors and the coordinator
or sink device used to gather data and transfer sensing
data to a local processing.
•
External Network communication: Used for communi-
cation between the coordinator and a remote back-end
server.
Table III presents the different technologies and standards
used for both short range and long range communication
between sensors, coordinator device and external back-end
server. It shows that the radio standards used to implement
in-body and on-body network communications are short-range
communication standards including Industrial Scientiﬁc and
Medical (ISM) band, Medical Implant Communication Service
(MICS) band, Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS),
Radio-Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID), Bluetooth, Zigbee,
and WLAN (Wi- Fi) technologies; whereas the radio stan-
dards used to implement external network communication are
medium and long-range communication standards including
Cellular Networks, WiFi, GPRS, Zifbee, Wibro, and Satellite
technologies.

AVAILABLE SENSORS IN THE MARKET
There are many companies specialized in wearable medical
sensors designed to collect data from the human body and
the surrounding environment. Table IV presents the sensors
provided by some of the well-known companies in the sensor
business, along with the corresponding connection type [9–17].
Table IV shows that the parameters captured by these
sensors include body temperature, ECG and activity sensor,
EMG, respiration, heart rate estimate, weight, force, SpO2,
humidity, body position, fall alert, invasive blood pressure,
barometric air pressure, and ambient light acquisition. It also
shows that most sensors send the collected data via Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE). Some sensors have micro-USB interface,
and many sensors are equipped with microSD card for local
storage of data. In addition, many sensors are provided with
external connector to connect to an external dock used to
program and charge the sensor and to access the microSD
card, whereas few others have digital serial interfaces.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this article, the different types of medical sensors
were presented, along with their properties and the wireless
communication technologies used to send collected data.
Also, the wearable medical sensors available on the market
were listed along with their communication interface. The
main aim of this article is to provide a clear understanding
on the medical sensors, and to make it easier for the end
user to select the appropriate sensor brand available on the
market based on the type of data collected by the sensor and
its interface and connection type.
