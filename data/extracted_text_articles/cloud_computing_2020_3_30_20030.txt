Abstract—SharePoint Online (SPO) is a Microsoft cloud-based 
business collaboration platform that is very robust and 
dynamic. Organizations can deploy and manage SharePoint 
Server on-Premises or can use SharePoint Online with an 
Office 365 Enterprise subscription. The platform has been in 
the market for almost two decades and last year SharePoint hit 
100 million active monthly users in the cloud. The platform has 
become larger in scale, richer in features, and is improving 
consistently. Thus, SharePoint migration has become even 
more 
important, 
especially 
migrating 
into 
its 
online 
version. The SharePoint support cycle changes when a new 
version is released, which affects also the support for various 
features.  Namely, newly added features and functionalities 
somehow enforce one to upgrade/migrate to the new 
SharePoint version. This paper seeks to show the best practices 
on how to do the migration of the SharePoint platform from 
one 
version 
to 
another. 
Five 
SharePoint 
migration 
projects have been described to serve as a case study. Engaging 
users during the migration process resulted in easier adoption 
of the new environment by the users and more efficient work 
from developers’ perspective. Moreover, the study identifies 
‘must have actions’ and ‘nice to have ones’ within each 
phase in order to do the migration properly. In particular, 
content owners should be given a date when to finish the clean-
up of old/unused data; if they do not do that properly or at all, 
then at least it should be requested from them to clean-up 
workflows, solutions, and pages which are not in use, in order 
to save the time while developing/recreating them.

Online. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that 
integrates with Microsoft Office [1]. SharePoint can be 
deployed and managed on-Premises (SharePoint Server 2019 
is the latest version) or can be used Online with an Office 
365 Enterprise subscription. It is also available in hybrid 
scenarios.  
 On the one hand, both platforms (SharePoint on-
Premises and Online) include out of the box a bunch of 
collaboration, communication, document management and 
business processes modeling features; and on the other hand, 
they include the building blocks for many kinds of Modern 
Workplace solutions through a set of rich application 
program interfaces (API) and extensibility mechanisms [2]. 
SharePoint can be used as a secure place to store, organize, 
share, and access information from any device [3]. Microsoft 
states that more than 200,000 organizations and 190 million 
people have SharePoint for intranets, team sites and content 
management [4]. 
Like any other application, platform, or framework, 
SharePoint is evolving continuously over the years. We have 
a new version of SharePoint on-Premises almost every three 
years. There can be many reasons, why one should upgrade 
to the latest versions of SharePoint; few of them are 
listed below [5]: 
1. Support Cycle changes when Microsoft releases a 
new version – To do proper support we need a deep 
knowledge & understanding of SharePoint’s features 
& 
functionalities 
and 
help 
from 
Microsoft 
support to keep it running smoothly [5]. At the end 
of mainstream support, Microsoft no longer issues 
product updates, only issues security patches. 
After the expiration of extended support, Microsoft 
stops issuing patches for that product, which makes 
that version a security liability to continue using [6]. 
In Table I, there are shown some version of 
SharePoint Server together with their Service Pack 
and the dates when Microsoft will stop supporting 
them. 
2. Features may be deprecated, and additions do occur 
with new versions - Microsoft stops supporting 
various features with every new release. A 
feature can be deprecated in the immediate new 
version 
and 
completely 
removed 
in 
the subsequent versions [5]. The list of features and 
functionalities 
that have 
been 
discontinued or 
changed in the SharePoint versions 2013 [7], 2016 
[8], and 2019 [9] and the workaround or replacement 
for them can be found for further reading in the 
references. There are two options to upgrade in 
SharePoint on-Premises: upgrade to the new next 
version, then to the other and so on or use third-party 
migration tools to upgrade to the desired new 
SharePoint server version or SharePoint Online.

3. One important thing is that when Microsoft releases 
the new features in any version like SharePoint 
2016 or 2019, those features are already tested and 
are used in Office 365 for several years. SPO/Office 
365 includes some distinguishing features [5]. 
Firstly, SharePoint farms are hosted in Microsoft’s 
cloud infrastructure and Microsoft applies security 
patches and pushes platform updates. Secondly, 
Office 365 has committed to 99.9% availability in 
their Service Level Agreement (SLA) and the cloud 
version receives more new features [5]. Finally, 
SPO is licensed on a per-user basis and can be 
purchased as a standalone service or as part of 
an Office 365 plan.  
SharePoint on-Premises has some notable features. 
Firstly, SharePoint farms are hosted within the 
organization, the organization’s IT is responsible for 
everything like patches, updates, etc. and also 
maintaining the Active Directory Domain Services 
on-Premises. Lastly, licensing is done buying Client 
Access Licenses (CALs) for either each device or 
person accessing the SharePoint server [5]. 
      As with other data migration projects, the most 
important things in SharePoint migrations are 
planning and analysis. Based on [11], the following 
steps should be carefully taken into account before 
and during the migration process: 
 
Make a detailed inventory of the environment – this 
helps us to make better decisions and estimates on 
the effort of the migration. We should have an 
inventory list of whole structure like site 
collections, sites, and lists, custom solutions, 
workflows, pages, users, and groups used retention 
policies, permissions, large lists or libraries, lists 
with lookup columns/dependencies to other lists 
and User Interface (UI) customizations (JavaScript, 
altered menus, etc.). Nice to have is an inventory 
list of content types, records, site columns, user 
alerts, and branding. 
 
Clean up the old environment - Contact the 
site/content owners and ask them to do this before 
the migration starts. They must find and delete 
unused and duplicated content; break large site 
collections into multiple site collections; promote 
large sites into site collections, review and 
reorganize very large lists. Removing “orphaned 
users”, 
empty 
SharePoint 
groups, 
unwanted 
versions and reorganizing lists and libraries with too 
many columns would be nice too. 
 
Prepare the destination environment –We must take 
the time to plan and structure a new home 
according to the new requirements/needs. It is nice 
to redesign the landing page if the stakeholders 
agree with this. 
 
Communicate with users – Users should be 
informed about migration before starting it, 
downtime planned, estimated timeline, the reason 
for the change and the value for them and possible 
changes in the environments. 
 
Start the migration – We must choose the 
appropriate site template, map SharePoint groups, 
migrate one by one Site Collection according to the 
plan, review the migration report/log file and fix the 
issues, redesign/recreate pages to modern ones and 
workflows and solutions. 
 
Post migration – We have to make sure that 
everything was migrated successfully, test all 
workflows, check user permissions, set access to 
read-only/remove in the old SharePoint and redirect 
users to the new one. 
In Section 2 we will explain in details five case studies 
and the approach used during these migrations. In Section 3 
we have a discussion part, where we have discussed lessons 
learned from these migrations, some critical pitfalls that one 
must be aware before the migration, comparing the 
migration methods used here and also what happens when 
the size is way bigger than the largest size of our case study. 
In section 4 we have the conclusion, where we have 
explained the steps for successful migration process, the 
finding of this paper and also the future works. 
 
II. 
CASE STUDIES 
As a case study, we have used five SharePoint migration 
projects with which we had experience in the past. The first 
two are completed in Cacttus Company in Pristina and the 
others in McKesson Europe AG in Stuttgart for three 
McKesson Business Units: McKesson UK, Admenta – Italy, 
and Lloydsapotek – Sweden. In the context of versions, one 
of them is from SharePoint Server 2007 to SharePoint 
Server 2010 and the other four from SharePoint Server to 
SharePoint Online.

A. Upgrade/Migrate SharePoint Server 2007 to SharePoint 
Server 2010 
There are two basic upgrade approaches for the upgrade 
from SharePoint Server 2007 to SharePoint Server 2010: in-
place upgrade and database attach upgrade. An in-place 
upgrade is used to upgrade all Microsoft SharePoint sites on 
the same hardware. A database attach upgrade is used to 
move the content to a new farm or new hardware. One can 
also combine these two types of the upgrade in hybrid 
approaches that reduce downtime during an upgrade [12]. 
There were more than 30 site collections in the old 
SharePoint 2007 Intranet and the first thing was getting 
approval from the content owner and delete the unused site 
collections and move some of the data from different site 
collections to a new one named Archive. The other 12 
frequently-used site collections were prepared for the 
upgrade. Then database attach upgrade was used with the 
following steps:  
1. Run the Pre-Upgrade Check command in stsadm on 
the SharePoint 2007 Server to identify and fix the 
potential upgrade issues before upgrade 
2. Set up and configure a new SharePoint Server 2010 
farm. Then transfer all customizations to the new 
farm and tests the environment. 
3. Detach the content databases from the old Office 
SharePoint Server 2007 farm. 
4. Attach the content databases to the new farm and 
upgrade the content. 
5. Confirmation that the upgrade has finished 
successfully and then configures the new farm to 
start serving requests at the new URL. 
B. Migrate of SharePoint Server 2010 to SharePoint Online 
The manual migration process, in this case, was 
performed with the following order:  
 
First, we created a similar structure of the 
Intranet including Site Collections 
 
Then the sites were saved as templates and 
then moved over to SharePoint Online to the 
appropriate site collections 
 
Then the lists/libraries were saved as 
templates and then moved over to SharePoint 
Online to the appropriate site collections/sites 
 
Some of the libraries the documents were 
moved from the old into the new environment 
using the explorer view 
 
Then the forms developed in InfoPath 2010 
were moved to SPO by first changing the 
connection strings in the form 
 
Workflows have been exported to Visio and 
then import in the new site and then the 
config files were modified. Since SharePoint 
Designer does not provide a direct way to 
move list workflows and we could not use 
third-party tools, we used the above way of 
migrating them by manually changing the 
config.xoml files between the sites [13]. 
C. Migrate of SharePoint Server 2013 to SharePoint Online 
ShareGate Desktop third party application was used to 
make the move to SharePoint Online seamless, without 
impacting the users regardless of how complex the migration 
project was. It provides a user-friendly interface and it is 
cost-effective. ShareGate, with its intuitive features, helps to 
prepare, execute, and validate the data migration whether one 
is migrating an entire environment or just a few lists [14]. 
C1. Migration of Swedish Intranet 
Swedish Intranet is mainly used to share news and 
documents with pharmacies. An overview of the Swedish 
Intranet Inventory is depicted in Figure 1. The Intranet 
consisted of one site collection with eight sites. The total size 
was 2.46 GB. There were eight sites with custom master 
pages, and nine custom features in five of them. The number 
of checked-out files was nine in six libraries. 
Firstly, content owners have been informed to clean up 
old/unused data from the old environment until a specific 
date. In order to make it a little bit easier for them, two 
specific reports in Excel with Unused Documents and 
Unused Lists for more than 6 months were sent to them. 
New SharePoint Online Site was created and then the initial 
content migration was done, from the old one into the new 
environment. After the initial migration, some issues were 
found and immediately were fixed. Moreover, all the pages 
on the new environment were recreated to new modern ones. 
On the Intranet landing page Newsfeed capability was 
heavily used to communicate with pharmacies. Since the 
Newsfeed is not available in the new Office 365 tenants it 
was decided to use Yammer instead of it. Links in the Top 
Navigation were also recreated. 
After finishing all the above tasks, the end-users were 
informed that the old Intranet will be set to Read Only for all 
the users on a specific date and they should update 
bookmarks in their browsers. After this notification, the site 
was set to Read Only and a visible banner on the landing 
page with the PowerShell script and then the final migration 
has been done. A similar approach can be achieved by 
setting the site as Read Only in Central Admin and adding a 
banner on the site landing page with SharePoint Designer, 
editing page, or a content editor web part.  
The visible banner was set on the old Intranet landing page 
informing the users that the migration is done to the new 
Intranet. Link to the new Intranet was also present and the 
information whom to contact if they encounter any error or 
have any issues using the new version.

C2. Migration of Italian Intranet 
An overview of the Italian Intranet Inventory is depicted 
in Figure 2. It consists of one site collection with four sites. 
The total size was 4.80 GB and there were 21 workflows. 
There were five custom features in four sites. The number of 
checked-out files was 84 in 14 libraries. 
Since Italian Intranet had similarities with the Swedish one, 
we followed the same approach during the migration except 
that Italian Intranet had a huge number of workflows that 
needed to be migrated/recreated. Also, it was decided that 
the workflow history list will be migrated only as an 
‘archive’ list and the running instances of workflows will not 
be migrated. All the items on the lists were workflows were 
attached were migrated before migrating workflows.  
 Workflows were migrated from the old to the new 
environment using ShareGate tool by stopping first the list 
workflows from starting when the new item is created or 
modified, and publish them in the old environment. Then the 
workflows were migrated from the old to the new Intranet 
and the actions were rebuilt in the new workflows which 
were not migrated because they were not supported in Nintex 
Online. Then the conditions to start the workflow were 
changed to be the same as in the old Intranet and the new 
workflows were published. Lastly, the content owners were 
asked to test the workflows. 
After finishing all workflows, communication has been done 
to the end-users, old Intranet was set to Read Only and the 
final content incremental migration has been done. The 
banner was set on the old Intranet to inform users about the 
changes and the new URL of the new environment. 
C3. Migration of UK Intranet 
UK Intranet is mainly used to share news and documents 
with all participants and for managing documents within 
different departments/projects there. As illustrated in Figure 
3, the UK Intranet consisted of 30 site collections with 95 
sites. The total size was 65.40 GB. There were 14 sites with 
custom master pages, and 55 custom features in 42 sites. The 
number of checked-out files was 43 in 19 libraries.  
Here we have used a different approach compared with 
the previous migration of Intranets. It was decided first 
migrating only the root site collection into the new SPO site  
 
 
Figure 2. Italian Intranet Inventory 
 
Figure 3. UK Intranet Inventory 
 
and then to go live with this site. All the links to the other 
site collections in the new site were pointing to the old site 
collections. Then the other site collections have been 
migrated one by one and after that, the links in the root site 
to that specific site collection have been updated. Before 
going live with this solution, the following things were 
previously done: 
 
An initial communication has been sent to all users 
to inform that migration of their Intranet will start.  
 
The content owners have been informed to clean up 
old/unused data from the old environment. 
 
All the news articles of the actual year were created 
in new modern pages since previously ones were as 
the blog posts which is not supported in modern sites 
 
Training to the communication team was done and a 
manual was delivered on how to create news articles 
with modern pages 
 
The old root site collection was migrated to the new 
separated site collection 
 
The new root site collection was used to hold only 
the news part and some subsites 
 
IIS redirect was used to redirect users from the old to 
the new UK Intranet 
 
The new banner was added to the new root site 
collection to inform the users about the migration 
A new page for the migration plan was created to inform 
users about timescales and support contact. A report was 
viewed on the page with the information about when the 
migration will start and end for each site collections/sites. 
Also, chart and pie graphics were added with information on 
how many site collections or sites were migrated and how 
many others are waiting for. The information on this page 
was updated frequently when new sites/site collections were 
migrated and the rows on Excel report were set to green for 
the migrated ones.  
The migration of the site collections was done one by 
one. Using the script, the site was set to Read Only for 1-3 
business days based on the predefined schedule/plan, and 
banner was added to inform the users that the migration is 
ongoing in that area. Then the migration started and all the 
pages on the new site collection were recreated to modern 
ones. After the migration of the site was finished the banner 
was changed to the migration is finished and the new URL 
was there. Since there were lots of pages in each site/site 
collection we have used a ModernizingPages [15] 
PowerShell script to do the conversion between the classic 
pages to the modern ones, and then redo the web parts which 
were not migrated properly. The description of the code is 
shown below.

line 4 will get all the pages in the library named “SitePages”. 
Code in line 5 will iterate over all pages which are saved on 
variable $pages. Finally, code from lines 6-7 will create a 
modern version for the classic pages, which will be saved to 
Site Pages library and named to ex. Migrated_Home.aspx. 
After finishing all the site collections based on the 
migration plan, another final communication was sent to the 
users to inform them that their Intranet migration is done, 
and they should ask the Local Support Desk team about any 
issue. 
 
III. 
DISCUSSIONS 
SharePoint Online is a cloud-based service that helps 
organizations share and manage content, knowledge, and 
applications 
to 
empower 
teamwork, 
quickly 
find 
information, 
and 
seamlessly 
collaborate 
across 
the 
organization [16]. Capabilities of SharePoint have expanded 
greatly from the original 2001 version to SharePoint 2019 
and SharePoint Online. SharePoint support cycle changes 
when Microsoft releases a new version, which affects also 
the support for various features by Microsoft. Because of this 
and the coming of new features and functionalities with the 
new version, there is a must to upgrade/migrate to the new 
SharePoint version. There are two options to upgrade in 
SharePoint on-Premises, move through each version as one 
upgrade or use third-party migration tools to upgrade to the 
desired version directly and to SharePoint Online. Moving 
forward, Microsoft will continue its focus on SharePoint 
Online/Office 365 to make it available and useful for 
organizations of every shape and size. Office 365 has some 
distinguishing features. Firstly, SharePoint farms are hosted 
in Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure and Microsoft applies 
security patches and pushes platform updates. Secondly, 
Office 365 has committed to 99.9% availability in its service 
level agreement (SLA) and the cloud version receives more 
new features. Lastly, some features will never be available 
on-Premises: Microsoft Graph, Delve, Power Automate, and 
Power Apps. 
After a specified period that the migration has been 
completed, one should lock the old Intranet to enforce users 
who still use it in Read-Only mode to switch to the new 
migrated Intranet. Probably users will complain that they do 
not have access but they can be informed that they were 
accessing the old Intranet and they should use the new one in 
the appropriate URL that is going to be shared with them. 
As it is explained in a blog [17], it is always required that 
the migrations to be of the highest quality and often must 
balance costs and time while defining their migration 
roadmap. The lack of resources adds another layer of 
complexity to the migration process. During our experience 
with many projects, we found that there is a tendency to take 
an inexpensive approach, whereby data is directly transferred 
to the new environment, without much analysis or clean-up. 
While this may be a relatively inexpensive way to balance 
the two important parameters of cost and time, it is certainly 
not the most efficient way. There are some critical pitfalls 
one must be aware of before upgrading or migrating to a new 
SharePoint environment [17]:  
 
SharePoint Upgrade is the responsibility only of the 
IT team. All stakeholders should be consulted, and a 
consensus 
emerges 
regarding 
the 
SharePoint 
roadmap of an organization [17]. 
 
To migrate, we need only a source and a destination 
environment. The new environment must support all 
the components present in the current environment 
[17].  
 
Consider compatibility requirements of third-party 
applications’ integration. Before starting with any 
migration, one must check for the compatibility of 
all third-party tools with the new environment. 
Eventually, one should update the tools to a version 
that is more compatible with the new environment 
[17]. 
 
Scatter information. A SharePoint migration team 
must map all the information with the relevant 
metadata. The right set of documents must be 
identified, along with their versions to be transferred 
to the destination [17]. 
 
No documentation of the current legacy system. 
Documentation should contain an overview of the 
architectural and system considerations, with web 
parts & external data sources. The document should 
provide also details of all previous migrations or 
SharePoint upgrade experiences, along with the type 
of approach used to migrate [17].  
External sharing. Users in SharePoint Online can share sites, 
folders, and individual documents with anyone, who has a 
Microsoft Account linked to their corporate e-mail address. 
There is also the possibility to generate Guest Links, which 
allow Read or Edit permissions to be granted without 
requiring authentication while allowing the Guest Links to 
be revoked at any time. 
Stay up to date, always. Users of the online version are 
privileged to get early updates on new releases upgrades than 
those who use SharePoint On-Premises. Moreover, some 
features might not be available for the on-Premises at all.

In Table II, there are shown inventories of the Intranets’ 
contents, from the three last projects before migration took 
place. Comparing migration method of the Italian and 
Swedish Intranet with the UK, we have found that the 
migration pattern we followed in the UK case proved to be 
the best one. Giving the users direct access to the new 
Intranet (SPO) at the initial stage of the migration project 
resulted in more engagement and adoption by the users. 
Addressing issues appearing in early stages resulted in a 
smoother migration process, which to the best of our 
knowledge has not been considered by other related works.  
If the total size is way bigger than the largest size of our 
case studies (65.4GB) or much more workflows or sites are 
to be migrated, then it will require more time, planning and 
efforts. Also, we have to keep in mind that the migration 
performance can be affected by network infrastructure, file 
size, migration time, and throttling.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The migration of data and applications on the cloud 
outlines one of the most important processes after each 
application version publishing. A summary of the 
recommended steps needed for a successful migration 
process includes the following [11]:  
1. Make a detailed inventory of the environment   
2. Clean up the old environment   
3. Prepare the destination environment   
4. Communicate with users  
5. Start the migration  
6. Post- migration 
Content owners should be given a date when to finish the 
clean-up of old/unused data; if they do not do it properly or 
at all, then at least we should request from them to clean-up 
workflows, pages and, solutions which are not used, to save 
our time while recreating them. The findings in this paper 
show that in order to have a smoother migration and better 
users’ adoption one should engage users with the new 
environment as earlier as possible during the migration 
process.. An insight into user experience with the migration 
process would be understood by conducting a questionnaire,

applications to get them ready for migration to SPO.
