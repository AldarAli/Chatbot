Abstract—The mathematical modelling of complex 
physical 
processes 
(objects) 
is 
based 
on 
the 
approximation of their experimental output variables 
(point data sets). It is well known that the respective 
mathematical 
models 
are 
multidimensional 
and 
significantly nonlinear, thus various mathematical 
methods were developed to approximate the experimental 
point data, each having its own inherent approximation 
advantages and disadvantages. However, these methods 
did not take into account the data structural and 
parametric characteristics. and thus motivated this 
research to develop a more universal approximation 
methodology to this kind of problem. The applied 
approximation method, named Cut-Glue Approximation, 
takes into account any data order and/or any nonlinear 
dependency based on 3 principles: fragmentation of the 
initial data approximated by known methods; high-
precision analytical approximation of local fragments; 
multiplicative analytic fragmentation of local functions 
isolated in the factor space. This paper considers the 
second stage of the Cut-Glue Approximation - analytical 
approximation of local fragments. The direct advantage 
of this approximation is the resulting mathematical model 
differentiability, 
which 
enables 
their 
analytical 
investigation, 
appropriate 
for 
modelling 
complex 
dynamical systems.

 INTRODUCTION 
In the process of scientific and technological progress for 
the majority of real technical and technological objects, the 
experimental construction of Mathematical Models (MM) and 
their study by computer simulation methods are the only 
effective methods for solving problems. 
This is because, due to the lack of a priori knowledge, 
theoretical research methods are not available for such 
objects. In addition, in the presence of significant 
nonlinearities of the internal relationships of the input and 
output data, the dependences for these objects are not always 
amenable for manipulation by known numerical methods. 
For example, when modelling the aerodynamic 
characteristics of aeronautical vehicles, researchers often 
encounter significant nonlinearity and ambiguity of the 
aerodynamic laws of their own movement and interaction 
with the environment. For example, mechanical production 
processes, apparatuses of the chemical industry and land 
vehicles, have substantially nonlinear characteristics. 
The experimental MM construction of such objects is 
the mathematical data processing task. The complexity of 
the approximation of such nonlinear dependences is 
obvious and can be the source of the significant errors. The 
errors reduction is achieved through the use of effective 
approaches based on the original array fragmentation of 
Experimental Data (ED). The effective approaches are the 
following: piecewise approximation [1][2], methods of 
spline functions [3][4], and also radial basis functions 
[5][6]. These approaches significantly increase the 
approximation accuracy when compared to the ED array 
methods as a whole (polynomial expansions [5]–[8], 
regression analysis [9], etc.). However, this excludes or 
makes it difficult for using them for the analytical MM 
transformation due to their conditional logical form. 
One of the effective means of expanding the 
possibilities 
and 
increasing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
experimental methods for constructing MM was a method 
oriented to a highly formalized approach by constructing 
MM for essentially nonlinear objects based on the ED 
conducted in active experiments. In a number of papers, 
starting from 2012, the Cut-Glue Approximation method 
(CGA) was developed [10][11][12][13]. It is based on the 
special multiplicative processing of individual MM 
dependency sections, fairly accurately approximated by 
analytical functions. The result of such processing is a 
function that describes only isolated (at each site) areas of 
their definition. With similar properties of these functions, 
subjected to multiplicative processing, it is admissible to 
additively combine them into a single function that has the 
MM object properties [3][8]. 
The CGA method includes the sequential execution of 
a number of stages: fragmentation of ED - partitioning an 
array into separate sections - fragments (FED), local 
approximation of each of the FED by a certain function and 
the multiplicative processing that follows it and the 
additive combination of these functions of the MM object 
under study [12][13]. In this case, the phase of local FED 
approximation [10][12], for the constructed MM, is 
decisive for the overall final quantitative accuracy. 
However, despite the rather large number of publications 
on the topic [8][13] the absence of fundamental restrictions 
on the dimensionality of the simulated nonlinear

dependencies is missing, and they were mainly illustrated by 
examples applying the CGA method for objects not higher 
than the second order. This was partly due to the need to 
illustrate the transformations and simulation results. Within 
the framework of this problem (approximation), there are 
mathematical and technological difficulties. Therefore, a 
detailed analysis of the solution for the 3-dimensional 
problem and its influence on the model dimension and 
methods applied with the obtained results seem relevant. 
This paper is dedicated to this topic. 
It is necessary to develop an algorithm for the 
mathematical modelling of ED fragments with fairly simple 
analytical functions in structure that allow variation of their 
structural complexity and supplement it with a search 
algorithm for supporting structural parametric optimization. 
The aggregate (hybrid) algorithm finds a mathematical model 
of minimal complexity for any ED fragment being of any 
dimension ensuring the specified fragment approximation 
accuracy. 
Section 2 explains the possible options for defining the 
applied polynomial approximation and the method to 
compute the related regression coefficients. Section 3 
describes the importance of structural and parametric 
optimization of the proposed polynomial approximation, and 
section 4 describes the structural and parametric searches 
enabling to find the optimal fragment model of experimental 
data. The respective example is described in Section 5, where 
the optimal structural and parametric representation for the 
3rd dimensional fragment is computed. 
II. PERFORMANCE ALGORITHM FOR 3-DIMENSIONAL 
DATA FRACTURES IN CGA 
The already published research results [10]-[13], 
performed during the development of the CGA method, as 
well as, numerous studies of the ED approximation problem 
[3][8], showed that to build Locally Approximating 
Functions (LAF), i.e. implementation of the phase of the FED 
approximation, it is appropriate to use a well-developed 
apparatus of classical regression analysis (CRA) [8][9]. In 
this case, the fragmentary nature of the approximation, which 
implies a not too large amount of experimental data included 
in the ED, makes it expedient to restrict oneself to methods 
of polynomial approximation. They guarantee both the 
analyticity of LAF and the regularity of its structure. The 
importance of the latter property will become clear from the 
further description of the problem. 
The fragmentary nature of the approximation of the 
array of ED in the CGA method means that the number of 
components of its FED can be quite large, and the 
complexity of the LAF for each FED will depend both on its 
size by the amount of data and on the dimension of the ED. 
In other words, the complexity of the LAF in approximation 
on the basis of only an accuracy criterion can be very high. 
When combining a large number of complex LAF in a single 
MM, the complexity of the latter may be unacceptably high. 
This circumstance indicates the need to state and solve the 
problem of the structural-parametric optimization of each 
LAF, which, in turn, requires the regularity of their structure 
in order to be able to control its complexity. 
The Power Polynomials (PP) have this property due to 
their regular structure, which allows to implement 
unambiguous algorithms for constructing joint ventures and 
their combinatorial variation. For the dependence of any 
dimension of PP has a canonical structure. The uniqueness 
of its complication relies on maintaining a clear sequence of 
the introduced members [13]. The following is an example 
of PP for a 3-dimensional fragment of experimental data: 
 
𝑌(𝑥) = 𝑏0 + 𝑏1𝑥1 + ⋯ + 𝑏𝑛𝑥𝑛 + 𝑏11𝑥1
2 + 𝑏12𝑥1𝑥2 + 𝑏13𝑥1𝑥3 + ⋯+ 𝑏1𝑛𝑥1𝑥𝑛 + 𝑏22𝑥2
2 + 
+𝑏23𝑥2𝑥3 + ⋯ + 𝑏2𝑛𝑥2𝑥𝑛 + ⋯ + 𝑏(𝑛−1)𝑛𝑥𝑛−1𝑥𝑛 + 𝑏𝑛𝑛𝑥𝑛2 + 𝑏111𝑥1
3 + 𝑏112𝑥1
2𝑥2 + ⋯ 
+ 𝑏11𝑛𝑥1
2𝑥𝑛 + ⋯ + 𝑏122𝑥1𝑥2
2 + ⋯ + 𝑏1𝑛𝑛𝑥1𝑥𝑛2 + 𝑏222𝑥2
3 + 𝑏223𝑥2
2𝑥3 + ⋯ + 𝑏22𝑛𝑥2
2𝑥𝑛 + ⋯

where 
 – coefficients of a polynomial of the 4th 
degree with the 3rd dimensionality of the simulated 
dependence. Their indices indicate the variables to be 
multiplied. For example, 
– product multiplier 
; 
 indexed independent variables of the 
experimental dependence under study. 
The PP Universal Structure (PP US) applies 2 loops. The 
internal loop is used to explore different factors values, 𝑥𝑖 of 
minimum to maximum index, as well as for the members of 
the same power order, and during their transition to a higher 
order. The outer loop ensures a consistent order increase to 
the next group of polynomial members starting from zero to 
the specified order, following after the exhaustion of 
combinatorial variants when multiplying factors. 
This approach and the shape of PP simplify the formal 
evaluation and comparison of  the PP complexity in respect 
to their structures. However, their use in the FED regression 
modelling complicates the finding of the optimal regression 
coefficients. One of the most simple and well-known 
simplification methods is the possibility of representing the 
nonlinear terms with PP arguments for the extended pseudo-
linear factor space with a new vector modelling the 
conditionally independent variables of higher dimension:

of

Interdependence part 
 determines the calculated sub-
optimal coefficients 
 with respect to the criterion used in 
CRA: in the Least Squares Method (LSM) - this critera is 
only heuristic. Therefore, the non-quadratic criterion solves 
the problem successfully with a combinatorial approach. 
It should be noted that the СRA apparatus is used in its 
standard form without any modification, since the obtained 
best approximation variant is performed with the structural-
parametric optimization (STR), as explained in this paper 
follow up. The parametric sub-optimization of polynomial 
coefficients is solved by CRA for each structural variant of 
PP.  
The developed software supports the first CGA method 
stage when approximating a fragmented ED with the 
approximating PP optimal or suboptimal variant. The low 
problem complexity is solved (the approximating PP 
dimension and order) applying the direct variants search. If 
the complexity of the problem results in an unacceptable 
computing time, then the heuristic search optimization 
algorithms is applied, as already proven themselves in such 
cases. Therefore, the developed EGA modifications are 
subject-oriented for the FED approximation. 
 
III. 
STRUCTURAL-PARAMETRIC OPTIMIZATION OF FED 
MATHEMATICAL MODEL  
The need for not only parametric search, requires in 
addition the optimal structural variant search, due to the fact 
that all included components cannot provide the required 
accuracy, since the properties of some nonlinear functions 
contradict the nature of the experimental dependences. Such 
specific functions that approximate well the curvature of the 
FED hyper-surface are unknown in advance for each 
individual fragment. The universal structure definition of the 
approximation function, with sufficient variety of elementary 
functions and their forms becomes a problem. A full PP 
meets this requirement. Within the search, first of all, it is 
necessary to identify its order m, which sets the  data 
approximation accuracy, which is decreased when compared 
to the full polynomial of order m-1. In addition, the effective 
FP members search increases the approximation accuracy. 
The advantage of using the regression PP resolves this 
problem, as its structure can be implemented by a regular 
mathematical record of the “mask” type, which represents 
the PP structure of the nth dimension and the mth degree 
(special digital code). This code is convenient for the FP 
structure, which has a similar dimension and degree. The 
initial arrangement of the FP elements corresponds to the 
combinatorial rules for increasing the indexes of coefficients 
described above. This corresponds to a structural and 
parametric increasing series of the polynomial coefficients, 
where the prime numbers 0, 1, 2 ... indicate the number of 
the multiplicative factor in the polynomial member. Their 
combination specifies all the factors constituting a member, 
and the number of nonzero numbers determines the order of 
PP. The code description example for the 4th order FP 
structure of the 3rd dimension follows: 
0,1,2,3,11,12,13,22, 
23,33,111,112,113,122,123,133, 
222,223, 233,333, 
 
(4) 
1111,1112,1122,1123,1133, 
1222,1223,1233,1333,2222,2223, 2233,2333,3333 
 
In (4) it is an enumeration of the terms of a fourth order 
polynomial of 3 dimensions, where “1” - corresponds to x1, 
“2” - corresponds to x2, “3” - corresponds to x3, “4” - 
corresponds to x4. 
It should be noted, when approximating a fragment 
consisting of q elements by CRA methods, it is possible to 
describe it by a polynomial of the same order. The number of 
polynomial members is less than the number of members of 
the fragment p < q. Thus, the maximum possible order for 
the FED approximation is its structure order. 
By varying the PP terms, the optimal structure search is 
made for the FED PP under consideration. The use of the NP-
complete exhaustive search taking into consideration all the 
possible combinations for an incomplete polynomial is found 
unacceptable for the high-dimensional FED. Thus the 
subject-oriented modification of EGA is used, and 
implemented as a tool for the variation search of terms 
included in the resulting polynomial. It should be noted that 
the use of the combinatorial exhaustive search for all the 
possible PP combinations is possible, and only applicable to 
small dependence dimensions with a small polynomial order. 
IV. 
POLYNOMIALS APPROXIMATION  FOR STRUCTURAL 
AND PARAMETRIC OPTIMIZATION 
The structural optimization search to find the suboptimal 
structure variant is based on a criterion in respect to which its 
complexity is calculated. Therefore, to assess the PP 
complexity criterion, it is worth noting that this difficult task

requires additional research. Intuitively, as in our case, the 
MM complexity depends on a discrete components number 
that determines the polynomial structure. The known 
approaches for the discrete complexity estimation use of the 
so-called “complexity scale” [13], and in the present 
research, the assessment of the structure complexity could be 
based on 2 types of scales: 
1. Heuristic, in which the quantitative components of 
the overall polynomial complexity are associated 
with its parameters, such as the number of members 
of the "symbols", the order of the member, etc., and 
are set by the developer or expert; 
2. Theoretical or experimental estimate of time 
resources for calculating the resulting value of each 
PP member. 
According to them, and on the formula proposed below, 
the structure complexity of the polynomial variant is 
calculated as follows: 
𝐸(𝑃) = ∑
𝑒𝑖 × 𝑥𝑖
𝑁
𝑖=1
 
 
 
(5) 
where P – PP structure under consideration;  
N – full PP member’s number, which includes the 
maximum possible number of members to define the 
fragment;  
e – estimate for the ith member listed in table 2;  
x – indicator of the occurrence or non-occurrence of the 
ith member in the considered PP structure.  
For the first approach, a scale was heuristically designed, 
see example given in Table 1 (2nd line). This scale is 
constructed for the 4th order FP having 2-dimensional 
dependency. In the second case, as shown in Table 1 (3rd and 
4th line), the scale fixes the time resources for calculating 
each PP member. The calculation is performed on a large 
sample (> 100000) using the desktop computer (CPU 
Pentium (R) Dual-Core 2.10 GHz, RAM 3 GB). 
The 
Microsoft 
Visual 
Studio 
(MVS) 
software 
development environment is used for the implementation in 
the 
C# 
programming 
language. 
This 
development 
environment enables measuring the computation time for 
each PP member operations. 
In Table 1, the 2nd column shows the 4th order FP 
coefficients, in the 3rd column the heuristic complexity 
estimates are shown for each FP member, in the 4th and 5th 
column the computing time (measured in MVS) respectively 
the corresponding estimates for the (t-estimate) computing 
time for the 4th  order FP members is shown.

MATHEMATICAL MODEL EXAMPLE FOR STRUCTURAL 
AND PARAMETRIC OPTIMIZATION  
As example for the proposed structural-parametric 
approximation  of the ED array fragment, the complex 
balloon movement is considered. The balloon total air 
resistance force (its vertical component) is simulated with its 
ascending velocity v (m/s), angle α (angle), and height h(m), 
adopting the following notation: v ~ x1; α ~ x2; h ~ x3. 
The ED fragment, see Figure 1, contains 36 elements. 
The full 4th order polynomial for the 3-dimensional 
dependency modelling contains 35 terms. Therefore, the 
limit FP fragment order is 4. Thus, the fragment modelling 
with 36 elements that contains 35 polynomial members is not 
a statistically acceptable option, since it takes into account 
only one of the existing degrees of freedom, and this is not 
enough to evaluate the resulting model. However, it should

be noted that often the PP variants, having a smaller number 
of members (but larger number of freedom degrees) are 
better modelling the approximation fragment than the full 
polynomial having the maximum possible order. Therefore, 
the maximum PP structure order is chosen, since it allows the 
search for the best approximation accuracy. This is enabled 
by varying its members, for example, using the combinatorial 
search algorithm, as described previously, and the search 
approach based on the modified EGA. 
  
 
 
Figure 1: 3rd  dimensional fragment results 
 
To illustrate the 3-dimensional data source, we use a non-
standard mathematical form writing. In the top rows and left 
columns of the ED matrices the fragments and the polynomial 
approximating it, see Figure 1, where the values x1 and x2 are 
shown. In the left part, the Fx (experimental data) matrix is 
shown,  and in the right part, the analytically calculated 
values using STR are shown. The variation of the polynomial 
structure is carried out with the choice of PP variants 
satisfying the range of the ED relative error: 0.01–1% with a 
subsequent search in the resulting set of options for finding 
the minimal complexity structure. 
Due to the fact that there is no universal and reliable 
theory of assessing the complexity of the joint, 2 types of 
criteria are proposed and validated: (1) Heuristic complexity 
scale, in which the polynomial members have assigned 
conditional estimate appropriate for their order and equal to 
it; (2) Considered to be more reasonable, since its complexity 
scale is based on the experimental estimates of the 
computational time for each PP member (see Table 1). By 
using them based on equation (5), the calculated structure 
complexity of the polynomial variant is shown. 
The 4th order, PP members, with marks for their entry into 
the ranking of the 10 best structural-parametric polynomials 
indicators are shown in columns of Table 2. The best PP 
options with relative error within specified limits are 
considered. In each column, "1" indicates the inclusion of the 
corresponding term in the final PP structure (zi=1), and the 
sign "-", on the contrary, indicates its exclusion from the final 
PP structure (zi=0). The bottom lines below these columns 
show the estimates for each option. 
In Table 2, in the last 6 lines, the following notation is 
used: 
• 
“Absolute error" and "Relative error" characterize 
the values of absolute and relative approximation errors; 
• 
“Sum. 4 "means the number of 4th order PP 
members is used as an additional criterion for assessing the 
complexity of the structure; 
• 
“S1” denotes the total PP complexity based on the 
theoretical or experimental computational time estimates of 
the resulting value for each PP member; 
• 
“S2” denotes the total PP complexity, based on the 
proposed heuristic scale; 
• 
“SC” denotes the total PP complexity, based on 2 
proposed scales.

Rows S1, S2 and SC show the criteria values on the basis 
of which the PP structural complexity is estimated. In 
addition, the 4th order PP member’s number is taken into 
account leading to a more complex structure. 
The joint structure, which is shown in the 6th column 
for the accepted formulation, can be considered as an 
absolute structural-parametric optimum, since, with 
sufficient accuracy, it has the least structural complexity. 
It can be noted that PP, shown in the 1–5th columns, have 
an advantage over PP shown in the 6th column, in terms of 
the absolute and relative errors. However, PP in the 6th 
column is simpler than all the other 9 variations of the PP 
according to the 2 criteria formed in this  
 work (S1, S2) and includes only 4th order members, which 
joint includes 6 members of the 4th  order, as shown in the 
4thcolumn.

CONCLUSION 
The proposed coding pattern for the polynomial 
approximation structure provides the unified and efficient 
approach for the formulation of the universal MM for 
describing 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-dimensional data fragments. 
Moreover, the possibility of using the applied algorithm to 
increase the order for their large values is outside the scope 
of this research. The proposed MM-s for estimating the PP 
structural complexity make possible to perform their 
structural optimizations by applying any discrete methods 
opening up new possibilities in finding optimal 
approximations methods. The combined heuristic search 
for parametric optimization and the combinatorial 
algorithm for the polynomial structural optimization 
enable solving the conditional optimization problem of the 
subject-based 
criteria. 
The 
heuristic 
polynomial 
optimization algorithm improves the approximation 
accuracy, based on the EGA modification, which makes 
possible to find a suboptimal mathematical description of 
the high-dimensional fragments for which the use of a 
combinatorial optimization method is not an effective 
approach in terms of time costs. However, the plans still 
have a lot of work to finalize the proposed approach to the 
approximation of fragments, for example, filtering 
descriptions of FED regarding their behavior between the 
FED points.
