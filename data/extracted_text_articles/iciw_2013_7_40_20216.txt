Abstract - Online communities in social networking sites exist 
and thrive in the environment provided by them. The study of 
online communities becomes important for marketers, 
academicians and business practitioners because of the huge 
rise in the user base of these social networking sites in recent 
years. In this study, we adopt the approach to focus on the 
user’s perceptions about online communities and establish 
various relationships among them leading to predict the 
intention to use such online communities. Technology 
Acceptance Model and flow theory are used to identify the user 
beliefs affecting the intention to use online communities. We 
also study the effect of online trust in form of system trust and 
interpersonal trust on the intention to use online community. 
We further incorporate the knowledge of user beliefs to 
establish the benefits in form of online social capital resulting 
from use of such online communities.

 INTRODUCTION  
Social networking on the Internet is becoming important 
not only for individuals but also for organizations. It has 
penetrated every phase of people’s lives from making new 
friends, to maintaining existing relationships, job search or 
brand building exercise for organizations. The online social 
networks 
(OSNs) 
provide 
a 
shared 
communication 
environment with inbuilt features which facilitates the 
formation of online communities (OC). The study of online 
communities in social networks thus becomes an integral 
part of social network researchers. 
In today’s digital era, information and communication 
technologies (ICTs) act as a major player or catalyst in the 
processes of community formation. The communities formed 
online vary vastly from one another either based on age, 
culture, economic benefits, interest, language, and other 
dimensions 
that 
would 
hinder, 
if 
not 
prohibit, 
communication in the physical world. There could be various 
reasons for a user to join and remain in a particular online 
community. These community formations give rise to 
fundamental questions like, why do people join a 
community? What factors motivate an online user to share 
his views and ideas on social networking sites? Do the 
features like trust and security stops someone from joining a 
particular online community? How do these variables change 
over time as the members of a community become more 
informed about each other? 
These issues have been dealt in various studies in 
different forms like dealing with identity of user in online 
social networks [1], defining the communities [2], the 
relative strength of relationship ties among community 
members, the trust between the community members [3] etc. 
In this study, we try to address the fundamental aspect of 
understanding the reasons behind joining an online 
community. 
The objective of our study is twofold in nature. The first 
objective is to use theories such as Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM) [4, 5] and flow theory [6] to identify the 
factors which can be important determinants for joining an 
online community. The second objective of our study is to 
identify the benefits derived by an individual from the online 
community formation process. We use social capital theory 
in the form it is applied for online information systems. 
In order to accomplish our study, we formulate our 
research questions as given below:  
 RQ1: Why do people join online communities? What 
are the underlying reasons for an individual to join an online 
community? 
RQ2: What are the benefits associated with people 
joining online communities in context of social networking 
sites? 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we 
present the theoretical background study. In Section III, we 
present the methodology followed by discussion in Section 
IV. Finally, we conclude in Section V with the future scope 
of the study. 
II. 
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
The objective of this research is to understand the 
underlying factors which can influence the user to join a 
particular community, thereby facilitating the community 
formation process in an online social network. To investigate 
these factors we start with technology adoption studies and 
thus use the most widely used Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM) [4, 5]. 
The approach of using theories such as TAM to answer 
our research question listed in section I, provides us with the 
user perspective for online community formation process. As 
suggested by Legris et al. [4] TAM seldom explains the 
whole picture for technology acceptance problems. So along 
with TAM we also use factors from flow theory [6], social 
capital [7] and trust [8] to investigate our research questions 
more holistically. We build our research model based on the 
factors from these proven theoretical backgrounds. 
A. Intention to use an online community 
Technology adoption studies’ usual focus is to 
investigate the intention to use a particular information 
system and thereby facilitate and translate that intention into 
167

actual use of the information system. This factor becomes the 
consequence in our research model. It is very important for 
organizations to know it because it would provide them a 
way to harness these online communities to reach their 
organizational goals. Also for marketers it is essential to 
know the factors impacting the use of an online community.  
B. Bonding and Bridging Social Capital 
To investigate the benefits associated with joining an 
online community we use the social capital theory. Social 
capital broadly refers to the resources accumulated through 
the relationships among people [10] which provide us two 
benefits in online social networking sites context. These two 
benefits are bonding social capital and bridging social capital 
associated with the type of relationships from which they are 
derived from online social networks.  
C. Perceived ease of use and Peceived usefulness 
According to TAM, the attitude towards a technology 
affects its use. The two belief variables used in TAM which 
explains the impact on attitude and in turn determine the 
intention to use, are Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and 
Perceived Usefulness (PU) [23].  As TAM has been applied 
to online websites or computers at workplace, the following 
hypotheses follows   
Hypothesis 1a: Perceived ease of use will positively 
affect intention to use an online community. 
Hypothesis 1b: Perceived usefulness will positively 
affect intention to use an online community. 
Davis et al. [12] suggest that perceived ease of use affects 
perceived usefulness and thereby affects the intention to use 
an information system. Thus follows the hypothesis 
Hypothesis 1c: Perceived ease of use will positively 
affect perceived usefulness of an online community. 
As people find merit in perceived ease of use and 
perceived usefulness of an online community, the more 
likely they are to use that community and thereby make new 
ties with other users. The weaker ties contribute to the 
bridging social capital and stronger ties to the bonding social 
capital. Thus, we hypothesize  
Hypothesis 1d: Perceived ease of use will positively 
affect bonding social capital. 
Hypothesis 1e: Perceived ease of use will positively 
affect bridging social capital. 
Hypothesis 1f: Perceived usefulness will positively affect 
bonding social capital. 
Hypothesis 1g: Perceived usefulness will positively 
affect bridging social capital. 
D. Perceived enjoyment 
Past studies have verified that the use of computer 
technology was influenced by perceived enjoyment (PE) 
[13]. The concept of perceived enjoyment is borrowed from 
flow theory [6] where flow is defined as “the holistic 
sensation that people feel when they act with total 
involvement”.  A common measure of flow is the level of 
intrinsic enjoyment of an activity. An online community 
interaction is a volitional activity where a factor such as 
enjoyment is likely to play an extremely important role. 
Thus, we hypothesize 
Hypothesis 2a: Perceived enjoyment will positively 
affect intention to use an online community. 
Intrinsic motivation drives a user for joining an online 
community voluntarily. Therefore, the more a user of a 
social networking site enjoys the activities within an online 
community, the more likely he/she will form new ties and 
thus contribute to social capital. Again the weaker ties 
contribute to the bridging social capital and stronger ties to 
the bonding social capital. So the perceived enjoyment 
resulting from such ties can be hypothesized as follows  
Hypothesis 2b: Perceived enjoyment will positively 
affect bridging social capital 
Hypothesis 2c: Perceived enjoyment will positively 
affect bonding social capital 
Venkatesh [14] argues that perceived ease of use is 
affected by perceived enjoyment. Further Venkatesh [14] 
found that by manipulating the perceived enjoyment 
associated with information system not only increased the 
perceived ease of use of information system but also it 
became more salient to the intended use of system. Thus, we 
hypothesize 
Hypothesis 2d: Perceived enjoyment will positively 
affect perceived ease of use of an online community. 
E. System trust and Interpersonal trust 
Trust is a multidimensional construct whose causes and 
effects have been studied in various scientific disciplines 
such as sociology, psychology, and marketing. Trust in 
online context has been studied by Friedman [8], as a means 
for enriching social capital, while Ba [3] and Lu et al.[22] 
studied  trust involved with e-commerce transactions etc. 
In online community context the trust is derived from the 
relationships existing among users. This becomes the part of 
our research model in form of interpersonal trust. 
Interpersonal trust is defined as “an expectancy held by an 
individual or a group that the word, promise, verbal, or 
written statement of another individual or group can be relied 
on” [15].  Another dimension for trust in online community 
to be considered is the trust of an individual on the overall 
system. This type of trust is attributed to system trust which 
is defined as perceived integrity, benevolence, and ability of 
the system operator which in our case is any social 
networking site. 
Benlian and Hess [16] establish trust as an important 
antecedent for the participation in online communities. The 
greater trust we have in an online community of a social 
networking site and its users the more likely we are to join 
that community and use it. Thus, we hypothesize  
Hypothesis 3a: System trust will positively affect 
intention to use an online community. 
Hypothesis 3b: Interpersonal trust will positively affect 
intention to use an online community. 
Since both system trust and interpersonal trust factors 
into the intended use of an online community, thus they are 
more likely to form new ties with other users in an online 
community. Since system trust depends on the individual 
168

perceptions of the institutional environment of a system and 
the structural assurances it provides, thus it is likely to affect 
both formation of weak ties and strong ties hence, we 
hypothesize  
Hypothesis 3c: System trust will positively affect 
bonding social capital 
Hypothesis 3d: System trust will positively affect 
bridging social capital 
On the other hand interpersonal trust is a result of 
interaction among user and is an experience-based trust. 
Interpersonal trust is contributed to by interaction among 
users which is more likely to be for the strong ties formed 
between close friends and family. Thus interpersonal trust 
would affect the bonding social capital. Thus, we 
hypothesize as   
Hypothesis 3e: Interpersonal trust will positively affect 
bonding social capital. 
F. Social networking site usage, self efficacy and social 
influence 
We now elaborate on the external variables for our 
research model which are likely to be the antecedents for the 
user beliefs mentioned earlier.  
Eastin and LaRose [17] studied the effect of Internet use 
on social, informational and entertainment outcomes. More 
recently Facebook usage has been studied as an antecedent 
in building of online social capital [9].  We study the usage 
in our context as social networking site usage (SNS usage) 
and its effect on the user beliefs to use an online 
community. Thus in our context of online community 
interaction we believe that more SNS usage is likely to 
contribute to greater familiarity with the features of SNS 
and hence should impact user beliefs to use an online 
community. Thus, we hypothesize as  
Hypothesis 4a: Social networking site usage will 
positively affect perceived usefulness of an online 
community. 
Hypothesis 4b: Social networking site usage will 
positively affect perceived ease of use of an online 
community. 
Hypothesis 4c: Social networking site usage will 
positively affect perceived enjoyment of an online 
community. 
Self-efficacy (SE) in the context of information system 
adoption studies has been studied extensively [17, 18] as an 
antecedent [17] to the user beliefs involved in the adoption 
theories. Self-efficacy is a behavioral concept which was 
first proposed by Bandura [18] and is defined as the belief 
“in one’s capabilities to organize and execute the courses of 
action required to produce given attainments”.  Earlier it has 
been studied in information system literature as computer 
self-efficacy and Internet self-efficacy [17]. We, in the 
context of our study of online communities in social 
networking sites, use it as social networking site self-efficacy 
(SNS self-efficacy). Again Internet self-efficacy has been 
studied as an antecedent for the social, informational and 
entertainment outcomes [17] and is an important determinant 
of perceived ease of use of an information system. Liu et al. 
[19] found that previous online learning experience (an 
external variable for TAM) is an antecedent for user beliefs 
such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of 
TAM. Since SNS self-efficacy relates to the ability and skills 
that an individual possesses to use a social networking site 
which can contribute positively to its usefulness, ease of use 
and enjoyment of an online community. Thus, we 
hypothesize as 
Hypothesis 5a: Social networking site self-efficacy will 
positively affect perceived usefulness of an online 
community. 
Hypothesis 5b: Social networking site self-efficacy will 
positively affect perceived ease of use of an online 
community. 
Hypothesis 5c: Social networking site self-efficacy will 
positively affect perceived enjoyment of an online 
community. 
Other users’ actions and thoughts may sometimes 
influence the choices involved in our decision making.  Thus 
social influence becomes extremely important in social 
networking studies. Venkatesh et al. [20] define social 
influence as ‘the degree to which an individual perceives that 
important others believe he or she should use the new 
system’. Social influence, sometimes termed as subjective 
norm, has been used as a direct determinant of behavioural 
intention to use an information system [20].  Venkatesh et al. 
[20] argues that this relation exists when use of information 
system is mandated and thus the relation’s existence is 
driven by the compliance factor of social influence.  In case 
of voluntary context, such as use of online communities 
existing in social networking sites, the social influence exists 
by virtue of influencing the perceptions about the technology 
[20].  Thus, we hypothesize 
Hypothesis 6a: Social influence will positively affect 
perceived usefulness of an online community. 
Hypothesis 6b: Social influence will positively affect 
perceived ease of use of an online community. 
Hypothesis 6c: Social influence will positively affect 
perceived enjoyment of an online community.

Since social influence in voluntary context can influence 
the perceptions about an online community, hence it can 
also contribute in building of trust of users in an online 
community. Thus, we hypothesize   
Hypothesis 6d: Social influence will positively affect 
system trust of an online community. 
The complete theoretical framework is shown in Fig. 1 
with the arrows representing the hypothesized relationships 
between the various constructs. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
For capturing the user’s perception we built a survey 
instrument based on measurement scales borrowed from the 
literature. While the measures are based on previously 
validated instruments in the literature, the current study re-
validates these measures.  
Both online and offline modes were used for collecting 
the responses from the survey respondents. A total of 132 
responses were collected after rejecting incomplete and 
invalid responses. For online mode a survey was created on 
an online survey hosting site and the link was sent with 
emails to the respondent explaining the nature of study. Each 
respondent was asked to fill the survey if they had any prior 
experience of the Internet and also any online community in 
any social networking site. Participation in the survey was 
voluntary so that there are no confounding effects from 
coercing subjects into participation. They were also asked to 
mention the online community with which they mostly 
associate with and were part of. Most of the respondents 
were users of Facebook owing to its largest reach among 
social networking users.  
Table 1 summarizes the reliability and validity of all the 
scales used in our research model. The average variance 
extracted (AVE) for every construct was above 0.5, which 
means the scales had a good convergent validity [21]. We 
used composite reliabilities (CRs) to evaluate the internal 
consistency of the measurement model. As shown in Table I, 
the CRs were all above 0.7, indicating the scales had good 
reliabilities. All Chronbach’s alpha values were above the 
0.70 threshold, indicating that the scales had high 
reliabilities. As Intention to use an online community was 
measured using single item scale hence the Chronbach’s 
alpha for it cannot be calculated. Also, since social influence 
is a two item scale we calculate the Spearman-Brown 
statistic for it, which is 0.742 indicating a good reliability.  
We show the correlation matrix and the square roots of 
the AVEs in Table II. The square roots of the AVEs are the 
diagonal elements and they were all larger than their 
corresponding correlation coefficients with other factors. 
This suggests that the scales had good discriminant validity. 
To test the hypotheses we conducted linear regression for 
each of the dependent variables.  The results are shown in 
Table III and Table IV. 
Table III shows the three linear regressions with 
dependent variable as intention to use an online community, 
bonding 
social 
capital 
and 
bridging 
social 
capital 
respectively. 
The first linear regression in Table III has intention to use 
an online community as the dependent variable and user 
beliefs such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use 
and perceived enjoyment as independent variables. Along 
with them, system trust and interpersonal trust are also

independent variables. This model has a good fit and 
explains variance with R2 = 0.303.  With this result we infer 
that 
perceived 
usefulness 
was 
the 
most 
important 
determinant for intention to use an online community. 
Perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment are not found 
to be significant because they are indirectly influencing 
intention to use an online community through perceived 
usefulness.  System trust and Interpersonal trust are also not 
found to be statistically significant.  Hence only hypothesis 
H1b is supported but hypotheses H1a, H2a, H2b, H3a and 
H3b are not supported.  
The second linear regression in Table III shows the linear 
regression with bonding social capital as the dependent 
variable and user beliefs such as perceived usefulness, 
perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment as 
independent 
variable 
along 
with 
system 
trust 
and 
interpersonal trust. This linear regression model has good fit 
and explains about 39.5% variance.  The coefficients for 
perceived usefulness and system trust are found to be 
significant but perceived ease-of-use, perceived enjoyment 
and interpersonal trust are not significant. Hence hypotheses 
H1f and H3c are supported but hypotheses H1d and H2c are 
not supported.  
The third linear regression in Table III shows the linear 
regression with bridging social capital as the dependent 
variable and user beliefs such as perceived usefulness, 
perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment as 
independent 
variable 
along 
with 
system 
trust 
and 
interpersonal trust. This linear regression model has good fit 
and explains about 42% variance.  The coefficients for 
perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment are found to 
be significant but perceived ease-of-use and system trust are 
not significant. Hence hypotheses H1g and H2b are 
supported but hypotheses H1e and H3d are not supported. 
Table IV shows the four linear regressions with 
dependent variable as perceived usefulness, perceived ease-
of-use, perceived enjoyment and system trust respectively. 
The first linear regression in Table IV shows the linear 
regression with perceived usefulness as the dependent 
variable and external variables such as SNS usage, social 
influence and SNS self-efficacy along with perceived ease-
of-use as independent variable. This linear regression model 
has good fit and explains about 52% variance. The 
coefficients for SNS usage, social influence, SNS self-
efficacy and perceived ease-of-use are found to be 
significant. Hence all hypotheses related with this linear 
regression model viz. H1c, H4a, H5a and H6a are supported. 
The second linear regression in Table IV shows the linear 
regression with perceived ease-of-use as the dependent 
variable and external variables such as SNS usage, social 
influence and SNS self-efficacy along with perceived 
enjoyment as independent variable. This linear regression 
model has good fit and explains variance with R2 = 0.377. 
The coefficients for social influence, SNS self-efficacy and 
perceived enjoyment are found to be significant but SNS 
usage are not significant. Hence hypotheses H2d, H5b and 
H6b are supported while hypothesis H4b is not supported.  
The third linear regression in Table IV shows the linear 
regression with perceived enjoyment as the dependent 
variable and external variables such as SNS usage, social 
influence and SNS self-efficacy as independent variable. 
This linear regression model has good fit and explains 
variance with R2 = 0.385. The coefficients for social 
influence, SNS self-efficacy and SNS usage are found to be 
significant. Hence all hypotheses related with this linear 
regression model viz. H4c, H5c and H6c are supported. 
The fourth linear regression in Table IV shows the linear 
regression for system trust as the dependent variable and 
social influence as independent variable. This linear 
regression model has good fit and explains variance with R2 
= 0.362. The coefficient for social influence is found to be 
significant hence we conclude hypothesis H6d is supported. 
Fig. 2 shows the relationships supported in theoretical model 
by our empirical study.

IV. 
DISCUSSION  
In our study, first we tried to establish the 
relationships between the external variables, user 
beliefs and their consequences. The benefits in form 
of bonding social capital and bridging social capital 
were also incorporated and the effect of user beliefs 
and external variables on them was also tested. The 
results show that intention to use an online community 
is directly driven by its perceived usefulness, because 
the more a user finds an online community useful, more 
likely he/she is to join and use that community. The 
perceived enjoyment and perceived ease-of-use do not have 
a direct impact on use of online community but they 
influence the user’s decision indirectly by increasing the 
usefulness aspect of an online community. This is in line 
with the voluntary context of online community usage, 
whereby the perceived enjoyment and ease-of use of online 
community increases its perceived usefulness. For example, 
the easier a user finds an online community features, the 
more useful that community will become for him/her, 
because he/she would now be able to derive more from the 
community experience using those features. Therefore, 
while it may not be expected that an online community may 
be used for the purpose of enjoyment, but if a user enjoys 
the experience then it may contribute towards the usefulness 
of that online community. Also with our study we once 
again established the robustness of TAM in being able to 
predict the intention to use an information system. 
Furthermore, the usage, social influence and self-efficacy of 
social networking sites influence the user beliefs. Thus, the 
more time a user spends on a social networking site, the 
more likely he/she is to gain the ability and skills, and 
therefore become comfortable with the social networking 
site features. Also this would help in the formation of 
positive beliefs about using an online community. The 
social influence in voluntary context is driven by 
internalization and identification component [20] which 
affects the user perceptions about technology and thus it is 
seen to be influencing the TAM variables as well as system 
trust. However we did not find any influence of system trust 
and interpersonal trust on intention to use an online 
community. This is in contrast with the expected effect and 
thus needs to be further tested and investigated. It may be 
the case that since respondents in this study were majorly 
college students, they may have known each other through 
earlier interactions thus they were able to trust the online 
community and its members. We may test this effect on 
respondents who are likely to join an online community 
which is not as much influenced by their offline 
interactions. Still we found that in terms of benefits of 
joining an online community the bonding social capital is 
influenced both by user beliefs about online community as 
well as the system trust component on the online 
community.  Thus members who are joining an online 
community and remain with that community for a long time 
are able to strengthen the system trust component and hence 
would be able to benefit in terms of their bonding social 
capital. The strong tie formation with community members 
would provide emotional support to the user. The

information exchange benefits from a diverse set of users of 
an online community in form of bridging social capital is 
seen to be derived directly/indirectly from the user beliefs 
i.e. TAM variables perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-
use and perceived enjoyment.  A user finding the online 
community useful and enjoyable is likely to develop new 
relationships with online community members and thus 
would be exposed to diverse information exchanges 
contributing to the bridging social capital. However, again, 
we could not establish the relationship of trust on bridging 
social capital which thus needs to be investigated further 
with a more diverse sample of users for our study.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE 
In this study, we have developed a theoretical model 
which incorporates the theories such as TAM and flow 
theory to explain the user behavior in the community 
formation process.  We conclude that usefulness of online 
community is an important driver for joining an online 
community. The factors, identified from our research study, 
such as self-efficacy and social influence can be used 
towards making an online community useful. We also found 
that online social capital for both strong and weak ties is 
built mainly due to the usefulness of an online community. 
Trust in online communities also strengthen the relationships 
among users of an online community and thus contributes 
towards bonding social capital. 
Future direction can be to compare the results from our 
study with results from different type of online communities. 
This approach can either strengthen or provide more insight 
into the results from our study.
