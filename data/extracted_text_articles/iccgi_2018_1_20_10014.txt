Abstract— Augmented Reality (AR) has changed the style of
education, where students control their way of learning and
understanding aspects. AR in education has made learning
easier
and
fun.
Interactive
applications
based
on
AR
technology are evolving rapidly. They unite virtual objects into
a real environment, which brings a deeper involvement to the
users, increasing the interest towards the application. Many
people who encounter AR for the first time have an eye-
opening experience, but fail to consider classroom applications
as important as they are for teaching purpose. The main
motive behind developing the application Vision Augmented
Reality in Enhanced Education (VisionAREE) is to introduce
AR in education for the children of age 4 to 6 years and to
enhance their way of learning. This paper provides an
overview of AR and the study of the application VisionAREE
including its features, design and implementation phases.
Survey results are conducted to aid the utilization of AR for
children aged 4 to 6 years old.

Application; K-1 Classroom.
I.
INTRODUCTION
AR is the induction of digital content in real world
environment. Users discern physical objects enriched with
digital content [1]. AR is considered as one of the latest
technology
that
has
spread
all
over
the
Information
Technology (IT) market successfully and is still progressing
to achieve more.
AR technology is being rapidly adopted in educational
areas. The researchers discussed that technologies are
playing an important role in the improvement of learning and
teaching criteria in classrooms in the last few years. One of
the emerging technologies is AR which is basically the
coverage of virtual information on real world environment
and is concerned with the objective to enhance and improve
the
understandability
[2].
VisionAREE
is
an
android
application that speciﬁcally targets children of ages 4 to 6 
years. The application aims to reinforce concepts at younger
age
with
educational
subjects
and
fun
activities.
VisionAREE has a friendly user interface and does not
require any technical knowledge. Our motive is to ﬁll the gap 
between the young generation and technology in educational
area.
This paper includes all the features of the application
with their brief description. It also includes the methodology
used and the people feedbacks as well as the obtained results.
Moreover, some future enhancements are suggested for
making the application more versatile.
In this study, the implementation of the application and
its learning potential is evaluated. The limitations and
difficulties of its development and implementation are
discussed. Most people are unfamiliar with new trending
technology in Pakistan. The first limitation occurred was
limited information and help availability. This limitation was
overcome
through
self-study
and
research.
Another
limitation was to explain the audience about AR and then
inform about the importance of using such tool in education.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the use of AR in education. Section III describes
the methodology which is used to evaluate the effects of AR.
Section IV describes the experiments and results. Section V,
provides
future
enhancement
of
the
VisionAREE
application. The conclusion closes the article.
II.
AUGMENTED REALITY IN EDUCATION
AR is a combination of basically two worlds, i.e., Reality
and Virtual Reality. AR is not just limited to old books.
Through the 20th century, AR became a vast and strained
technology. It is extensively used in many contexts such as
advertising and IT. Its actual typical use is through AR
games
that
are
much
obliging
for
children.
The
superimposition of illustrations on real world objects is
called AR. AR network is simply based on how a person
witness digital information on real objects by simply using
smart-phone or any other device that can be worn like
goggles.
This technology improves experience of viewing the real
world and does not make the person feel distant from it [3].
AR is now considered as one of the fastest growing and
newest technologies offering new ways of learning in the era
in which the technology has changed the view of education.
The use of AR into smart phones has been a growing
phenomenon because smartphones are gaining so much
popularity all over the world [4].
AR technology, having the capabilities of the induction
of digital content in real world environment, opens the door
for the development of educational fun applications that
connect real and conceptual matter [5]. AR has changed the
style of education, where students control their way of
learning and understanding aspects. More new methods are
being sketched and implemented to overcome the gap
between the physical and virtual world.
AR provides different advantages in the educational
context [2]:
1)
Promoting learning through physical activities.

ICCGI 2018 : The Thirteenth International Multi-Conference on Computing in the Global Information Technology

2)
Viewing 3D content from different viewpoints
boosts learning.
3)
Encouraging students to participate in educational
tasks.
4)
Yielding information about real world entities
concerned with the activities for understanding.
The forms of AR can be described as [6]:
1)
Maker based.
2)
Object based.
3)
Location based.
The devices of AR can be [7]:
1)
Mobile devices (smart-phones) enabling to see a 3D
model.
2)
Personal Computers having a webcam.
3)
Glasses and lenses.
There are two main processing architectures in ARS:
autonomous and distributed. Autonomous systems carry out
all tasks simply in a single device which is generally
inexpensive such as mobile phone or computer with
webcam. Distributed systems transfer the processing to a
server while Mobile AR (MAR) achieved valid significance
and acceptance from customers and mobile manufacturing
companies [8].
AR has become commonly practical on exclusive smart-
phones by 2009. This became possible with the support of
advanced features in ubiquitous devices [9]. Figure 1 shows
the brands implementing AR and MAR [10]. AR in
education can be characterized into 3 main categories of
applications, as seen in the article AR in education published
in [11].
1)
The most deliberated and specialized, best suited
for students.
2)
Easy and fascinating, created for children to engage
them in learning.
3)
Best suited for everyone, mainly to improve one’s
knowledge.
Figure 1. Major Brands Using AR
The article clearly specified that AR in education
motivates and engages learners to understand things better
and faster. AR helps educators to capture the attention of
their students and make them learn in more fascinating way.
The authors of [11] highlighted the main areas where
work for pupils has been done. The areas include math,
alphabets, animals, insects, fishes, birds and reptiles, life
cycle of Monarch butterfly, coloring activities, plants and
constructive games. Many educational approaches using AR
are better and easier, as the technologies that have made AR
possible are stronger than they have been ever before and
are
sufficiently
compactable
to
deliver
AR
related
experiences to educational places with the help of smart-
phones and computers.
By covering the area of school, it was explained how
professionals are eager to introduce AR to classroom
learning in various subjects and to introduce it into students’
guides and augmented books. On the other hand, AR will not
be very famous and adopted due to low financial support
from the government and less knowledge of AR in
educational phase [12].
The researchers explain how feedback can be worthy for
teachers as they can provide much insight into children mind.
The need for feedback and evaluation sessions with teachers,
educational experts and student can pave the way for the
development of successful prototypes [5]. The authors of
[13] specified that 73% have access to touch-screen devices
at their home, whereas in [14] the authors mentioned that
75% of American children under 8 have access to media
devices.
A study was done for CPB-PBS in [15] to understand
and learn about the AR games. The games are especially
being designed for the age group 6-8 years to help them learn
in a better way. These games engage children in classroom
by providing fascinating activities and developing their
interests in technology. Through these activities there is a
slight gain in students’ enactment. The teachers are also
rapidly using these AR games to help students improve their
promptness and precision rather than individual teaching
tools. The questions to be answered in this context are:
1)
Can children learn the targeted math skills in an AR
experience?
2)
What added value could AR technology bring to
class- room settings?
As for results, data was collected by them from the
students attending an Out-of-School-Time (OST) program
and few of the teachers unaffiliated with the OST program.
No remarkable improvement was seen from the result of the
students as they faced problems in the usability of AR
applications and also the clues were not enough to solve a
math
problem.
Most
of
the
applications
lack
proper
instructions, which might be problematic for children.
According to the results of the above study, WestEd also
provided few of the recommendations and conclusions that
will surely help in future development of AR technology.
Some of the recommendations include that proper hints
should be provided according to the given question so that it
eases help for children in solving it.

AR games, designed for learning must contain many
levels in it and children self-select the level according to
their class or age. The game should also include training
materials for teachers as well to help them learn. The use of
AR must be, in such a manner, gainful over outdated paper-
and-pencil or purely computer-based math instruction.
The above study being conducted by WestEd mainly
focuses on two of the AR games i.e. Monster Plus developed
by Georgia Institute of Technology and Fetch! Lunch Rush
developed by CPB-PBS. Both games run on Apple devices
and are marker based.
An entire report in the book [16] I am a little monster,
Kingston University has been written on the research of how
AR books can become fascinating for children. Parents no
longer need videos and games to entertain their children. The
entire team for a research trip visited Waterstones (leading
book retailer in UK). The purpose was to find out what
elements engage children fun reading.
Younger children = touch-feel and audio. Older children
= audio, video, pop-ups and games
Parents sometimes find it difficult to create imaginative
stories in order to make the book more interesting for
children. More than 90% of parents have allowed their kids
to play with online games and use educational applications.
This means that there would be low barrier while trying AR
books. AR books are considered as standalone form of
entertainment.
The target audience was children of 2 to 5 years as there
is less mental pressure on them.
The top educational applications of AR listed through
study and research are:
•
One of the most popular applications is FETCH!
Lunch Rush, which lets the students learn addition and
subtraction in an interesting way [17].
•
Quiver, a 3D color AR application which allow
students to color and play. They also provide educational
discounts to schools [17].
•
Matching Objects and words (MOW), words from
different languages are taught through this application [18].
•
Zoo Burst, an AR application which changed a
simple story telling to a different world of 3D characters
[19].
•
Elements4D, an AR application which changed a
simple subject chemistry into an interesting world of
animation [19].
In order to engage in more cognitive operations,
children should operate and read by themselves rather than
have their parents do it for them as it may not be
constructive. Parents should refrain from controlling and
narrating to their children so that their children can gain
higher level of understanding and perception during the
process [20].
A.
Features of VisionAREE
VisionAREE distinct feature from existing educational
AR applications is that it just not only includes exercises but
it also provides entertainment in the form of coloring book
and 3D animations. It brings objects to life and aims to grasp
children attention. The features include:
•
Mathematics, which includes addition, subtraction,
multiplication, even and odd numbers.
•
English, which includes grammar (vowels, nouns,
verbs),
easy
sentences
completion,
poems
with
3D
animation.
•
General Knowledge (Info Bee), which includes
infor- mative 3D animation that will help them learn about
seasons, flags, plants.
•
Coloring Book Activity (Color Me), which includes
coloring on paper that will make the 3D animated character
being colored the same, comparison with original picture.
•
Know
Me:
Real
World
environment
object
recognition, specifically the class room objects.
•
Text-to-Speech, playback audio and Demo.
•
Evaluation Quiz and Progress Report generation.

METHODOLOGY
The whole research has been done by conducting
surveys, analyzing the results and reading research papers.
During the development process, all four group members of
the project tested the application. Around 40 users used and
evaluated the final results of the application and tested it in
all respects. Evaluation on the basis of comparison with
other traditional methods was also performed which resulted
in the favor of usage of AR application. By using survey
forms, we tried to observe how parents think about the
usage of smartphones for their children and whether they are
aware of AR technology. We assured to cover and include
all those types of questions that can conclude the views and
aspects
of
people
for
the
project.
Throughout
the
development of the project VisionAREE, feedbacks were
taken from various people we came across at home,
institutes, workplace, exhibitions and competitions. This led
to the successful designing and development. Reviews from
users were taken under consideration and the application
was reshaped each and every time for better UX/UI, so that
the main purpose of the application is met. The idea was
supported and appreciated. The project VisionAREE was
also demonstrated in Montessori Complex High School,
Karachi where a class of 40 first grade students was present.
The application was not included in a specific course
environment. Moreover, it was also presented in exhibitions
and
competitions
several
times
where
it
earned
top
positions.
A.
Implementation Phase
VisionAREE
is
using
Vuforia
SDK
for
AR
functionality and the marker based approach. The markers
are referred to as the image-targets. The user has nothing to
do with the knowledge of the image-target but with the
cards,
pictures
and
stickers
that
has
the
answers
understandable by them. The user hovers the phone on
cards, pictures or stickers and sees 3D content augmented
on them. The 3D content provides more information and
insight. The user taps on the 3D model to answer. Figure 2
shows
the
Winter
Card
and
Figure
3
shows
its

corresponding AR model for the visualization of Winter
Season. Similarly, Figures 4 to Figure 7 show other
implemented 3D models.
Figure 2. Winter Card
Figure 3. Animated 3D model
The user is provided with demo videos, definitions and
hints to learn more. VisionAREE also has the text-to-speech
feature that opens the door for children to understand more
and answer efficiently. The application has two modes to
select between, quiz mode and demo mode. Demo mode
beings very friendly and helpful with demo videos and other
help available while quiz mode has more test-like interface
where there is timer and scores are calculated and stored.
The modes provide the child with the flexibility to learn and
to test. The content of the application is unchangeable, so it
is not possible for teachers or anyone to add or update
content.
B.
Testing Phase
The implementation was tested at each and every stage of
the module both during the development and then on the
android phone by building and testing. Another important
thing taken into consideration is that the 3D model is stable
enough on the image-target. This thing is achieved by testing
and editing the images and checking their ratings.

The image-targets are then placed on the cards that are
designed and are easily understandable by the users.

The
other
thing
taken
under
consideration
is
the
efficiency and the response time of the application. In
interface is designed in accordance with the age level.
C.
Evaluation Phase
The evaluation of the project is determined by the
completion of each of the sub module specified. Each sub
module for example in math, a logical question generation
followed by user input and performing system calculations
and verifying the answer and also keeping track on the user
progress should all work properly. Figure 13 shows the
evaluation of the application.

IV.
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
According to the survey conducted, 46.2% of the parents
in Pakistan do not support the idea that children should use
smartphones. 64% of children do not have their own
smartphone but 77% of parents do allow them to play with it.
The thing which is worth noting is that the same percentage
of parents that is 77% said that they have installed
educational applications for their children and 74.4% let their
children use a smartphone for 1-2hr per day while 20.5%
reported 3-4hr and the rest, 5-6hr. Upon asking if the parents
have prior knowledge about AR the result was slightly more
in favor with the percentage of only 51.3%, but when asked
if they have ever used the famous AR applications by name,
particularly Snapchat and Pokemon GO, 64% responded
saying yes. This shows that many parents are using AR
applications but are not familiar with the term. 61.5% parents
rejected the view that smart-phones are a waste of time.
There was not a single negative response to the question, Do
you think smart-phones can be used for educational purpose,
with 87.2% saying yes and 12.8% saying maybe. 82.1% that
is a significant majority supported the idea that educational
application should be implemented in schools and the same
percentage of parents that is 82.1% responded that it will not
be hard for them to teach their children through smartphones.

ICCGI 2018 : The Thirteenth International Multi-Conference on Computing in the Global Information Technology

77% of the parents reported that educational applications will
develop interest in children. On visiting Montessori Complex
High school, Karachi we demonstrated VisionAREE to first
grade students. Prior to that, we had talked to the school
representative
who
had
concerns
about
the
usage of
smartphones by children. On demonstrating and explaining
the project and idea to the representative we were able to
change his thoughts and were appreciated. The project was
loved by the children and tremendous amount of interest was
shown
by
them.
Every
child
eagerly
and
excitedly
participated in the activity. However, we noticed a traditional
learning way of students where it was hard for them to
understand the question in a way other than they are familiar
with. Reading out the question as 4 multiply by 4 they were
getting confused but after saying ”4 4 za” they answered
promptly. In a class of 40 first grade students, approximately
80% said that they use smartphones and tablets at home.
62% said that they use educational applications.
Some significant feedbacks that are implemented and
must be highlighted are:
•
Adding the feature Know Me so that the children
can learn about classroom objects.
•
Adding a demo picture in Color Me so that the child
can compare the colored picture with it.
•
Adding timer in quiz mode.
•
Not to let the question change unless it is answered
correctly in demo mode.
•
Other correction related to UX and UI for better
accessibility.
•
Adding
text
to
speech
feature
for
better
understandability.
•
Resetting the scores in scoreboard if another user
wants to play on the same device.
•
Demonstration videos and manual are made easily
available.
V.
FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
VisionAREE’s specialty is that it has flexibility with
respect to enhancements. It provides enough space in
which it can
be easily enhanced in future.
Extending age limit
Enhancements can be done by upgrading the age group
and subjects. As the application is designed according to
the level of 4 to 6 years, it can be made for higher grade
students.
As a desktop application
The application although uses smart-phones but can be
deployed on computers and can be used as a desktop
application. Therefore, the students will be able to use this
application according to their choice and feasibility. As
many
parents
do
not
have
smart-phones
but
have
computers in their house, so in this way it will be helpful
for them.
Modification by adding more subjects
The application targets the pre-primary level of
education. Modification can be done for almost any
subject so that, students can gain more interactivity with
this application.
Building for IOS
The application is currently developed for android
devices and
can be developed
for IOS as a future
enhancement so
that the non-android users can also use the
application.
VI. CONCLUSION
Technology is endlessly evolving, and the development
of new applications sometimes acts as a touchstone to the
arrival of a completely new technological paradigm. It is to
conclude
that
our
application
VisionAREE
is
mainly
designed for the purpose of education using the AR
technology. It aims to help students in ways that can
strengthen their concepts and boost their skills, making
complex information easier to understand and fun. Breaking
the barriers of traditional learning is one of the main focus
of the application. The apparition behind VisionAREE is of
great significance for the betterment of education sector in
Pakistan.
