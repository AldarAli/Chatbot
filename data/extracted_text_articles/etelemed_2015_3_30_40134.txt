Abstract—The analysis of the impact of the number of sensor 
nodes, the transmission rate, buffer size, source types and the 
authorization packet in a Wireless Body Sensor Network 
(WBSN) based on polling technique is carried out in this paper. 
A simulation platform is developed in Matlab, contemplating 
different models of sensor nodes with limited buffer and the 
polling mechanism to control the transmission to the centralized 
node. The used performance parameters are the packet loss and 
the packet waiting time in the queue. The obtained results show 
that the transmission rate has the greatest influence in the 
network. Additionally, the ideal configuration obtained uses 
fourteen sensor nodes with three buffer positions and mixed 
sources.  
Keywords—WBSN; parameters; polling; waiting time, packet 
loss. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN), currently in 
developing, is a special network for medical application which 
needs very low energy consumption, very low packet loss and 
an insignificant packet delay.  To achieve such characteristics 
in a network, the Medium Access Control (MAC) is the most 
important. There are many MAC proposals based on IEEE 
802.15.4 standard with beacon - enabled star configuration for 
WBSN [1]. However, since this standard is not designed for 
WBSN applications, some drawbacks were presented in [2] 
which led to new MAC proposals [2] - [16]. Some of these are 
variations of the standard [3] - [5]. Others are based on Time 
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique [3] [6] - [11]. 
All of them exploit some specific medical needs. For example, 
in [6] [12] MAC protocols that deal with light and heavy loads 
considering normal and emergency situations are proposed. A 
MAC based on random access technique is proposed in [13] to 
ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of a WBSN. The heart 
beating is used for clock synchronization in the proposal 
described in [8]. In [14], to increase the network lifetime, the 
battery is charged using the beacon that wakes up the sensor 
nodes. In the 802.15.6, which is the standard for the wireless 
body area network [17], one of operation mode, the non-
beacon mode without superframe boundaries, can be based on 
polling access technique. A MAC based on hierarchical 
polling scheme for WBSN is proposed in [18]. The first level 
of proposed hierarchical MAC consists of sensors nodes 
divided into groups, and the communication among sensor 
nodes of a group and a sink node (an external device) is 
carried out by using the polling technique. In the second level 
of hierarchy, the sink nodes communicate with a master node 
that collects data by using also the polling technique. The 
performance of the proposed scheme is studied by analytical 
modeling, and studies show its efficiency in WBSN 
application.  
In [19], the MAC scheme based on flexible polling 
guaranteeing QoS for WBSN is proposed. The proposed MAC 
has two modes of operation: normal and urgent. In the normal 
mode each sensor is polled once in each cycle and in the urgent 
operation a priority of sensors is defined and the higher 
priorities sensors are served first. The performance analysis 
was carried out using mathematical models and the results for 
normal mode showed that the exhaustive service is better than 
the single buffer in terms of waiting time and the transfer 
times. For the urgent mode the analysis showed that for light 
input load the scheme works very well, but for heavier load the 
system operates in unstable conditions.  
A MAC scheme based on polling denoted Fast Polling is 
proposed in [20].  A simple modification is proposed by adding 
the authorization packet into ACKnowledgement (ACK) 
packet. The analysis carried out using OMNeT ++ simulator 
showed that the throughput improved and the latency was 
reduced.  
The Human Energy Harvesting Medium Access Control 
Protocol (HEH-BMAC) is proposed in [21] as MAC suitable 
for WBSN for capturing human energy. The HEH-BMAC is 
based on two MACs: i) namely polling (polling-ID) and ii) 
Probabilistic Contention (PC). The idea is to adapt its operation 
to the different energy and state (active/inactive) variations that 
the sensor nodes may capture. 
The MAC based on polling for WBSN is analyzed in [22] 
using different scenarios, verifying the packet loss and waiting 
time in the buffer of a sensor node. The study is carried out 
through a simulation platform developed in C++ Builder, 
containing different types of sources. Three scenarios were 
composed by seven sensors placed in different parts of the 
body, forming a star topology, with sink node in the network 
core. The first scenario used a configuration with constant 
source in all nodes, while in the second scenario three constant 
sources are mixed with other types of sources. In the last 
scenario, five sources are mixed in different parts of body. The 
results showed that three positions buffer is sufficient for 
WBSN applications using seven sensors. 
The impact of source parameters and link capacity on 
WBSN using polling access technique is investigated in this 
paper. More specifically,  a numerical study using Matlab is 
carried out to understand the relationship between the polling 
access scheme and i) the number of sensors on the human

body, ii) sensors’ parameters (such as traffic types and buffer 
size), and iii) the radio link capacity between the sensors and 
the sink. This study is conducted measuring the packet waiting 
time and loss in the sensor node buffer. 
The paper is organized in five sections. In Section 2, the 
concepts underlying the functioning of WBSN and the choices 
made for the simulation are presented. The models and 
parameters of the sources for the study are described in Section 
3. In Section 4, the analysis of results is presented. Finally, in 
Section 5, the conclusions are evidenced. 
II. 
WBSN AND POLLING ACCESS SCHEME 
WBSN consists of many sensor nodes with limited capacity 
attached at different locations of a human body, and are 
continuously monitoring the vital signs of a patient for 
diagnosis and prescription. WBSN provides real-time updates 
of patient medical records via Internet, being an economical 
solution to health systems [23]. 
A WBSN is illustrated in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1.  
Environment of the WBSN studied. 
As shown in Figure 1, several sensor nodes are arranged in 
the human body to monitor various activities. The sensor nodes 
collect information and send to the sink node, which has 
greater storage capacity and processing. In its turn, the sink 
node works as interface among sensors and external networks. 
Since the sensor nodes transmit their information to the 
sink node, and according to [24] the structure of the network is 
a star, the sink node is inserted in the middle of the sensor 
nodes as in [21].  
In the polling used in this paper, the sink node establishes 
the cycle of service to the sensor nodes. Based on this cycle, 
the sink node interrogates individually the sensor node to see if 
there are packets to transmit. If there are, the sensor node 
receives permission to start transmission while others wait their 
turn. Thus, while a sensor node transmits packets, the others 
are performing their monitoring activities, waiting their turn to 
transmit and may store the generated packets in the buffer. 
After data transmission, the sensor node can activate the 
sleeping mode, saving energy. 
The limited polling is a kind of polling that constrains 
packet transmission, either in time or in number of packets, so 
when the limit is reached, the current sensor node stops to 
transmit and the permission passes to the next sensor node, 
independent the state of the buffer of the current sensor node. 
The limited polling is adopted in this paper because can save 
energy.  
III. 
MODEL AND PARAMETERS OF SOURCE AND LINK 
CAPACITY 
The need for an accurate traffic model to evaluate the 
performance of the whole system is very important [25]. Since 
there are no practical traffic traces yet, some assumptions are 
made.  In the practical environment that will be considered the 
sensors are divided into two types: continuous and event 
oriented modes. The continuous mode of operation is the case 
where data are generated continuously as the sensors 
measuring the heart beating, body temperature or blood 
pressure constantly. This kind of traffic is called Constant Bit 
Rate (CBR) source. In the event oriented mode the event 
occurs occasionally.  This kind of traffic could be the 
measurement of body temperature outside of a range, that is, a 
sensor sends information only in abnormal situation. In the 
event oriented mode, the sources can be modeled with intervals 
On (with packet transmission) and Off  (no packet 
transmission). It is important to mention that the On/Off 
exponential traffic model for each source is simple to 
implement and, moreover, the aggregate of these sources 
represents with good approximation the self-similar traffic. For 
this reason the model On/Off exponential is adopted in this 
paper.  
 
The five On/Off exponential sources developed in 
[22] are used in this paper. A summary of developed sources is 
shown in Table I.

The packet size used in Table II is the average of the packet 
sizes presented in eight papers as mentioned in [22]. 
The packet peak rate corresponds to the Mica2Dot which is 
used in most of the literature. The On time corresponds to the 
packet size divided by the peak rate. The Off time is obtained 
considering the sensor nodes are 90% of time in the Off state 
[26][27].

The transmission rates adopted among the sensor nodes and 
sink node in the simulation are 19.2 Kbits/sec used in 
Mica2Dot  [28], 38.4 Kbits/sec also used in Mica2Dot and 250 
Kbits/sec used in MicaZ [28] [29] which is mentioned in most 
of the literature. 
The numbers of sensor nodes adopted in the simulation for 
this work are seven (7), fourteen (14), twenty-one (21) and 
twenty-eight (28).  
The buffer sizes in the sensor nodes are restricted in one 
(1), three (3), five (5) and one thousand (1000) positions, the 
latter being equivalent to infinite buffer. In the First In, First 
Out (FIFO) buffer at the sink node is adopted ten positions for 
packet storing.   
To calculate the confidence interval, each simulation was 
performed three times and an average of the results obtained is 
presented. 10.000 packets are generated in each sensor, and the 
transient period is discarded. Thus, the initial 2000 packets are 
discarded for statistical purposes. Moreover, the sources that 
use the control parameter, in a group of ten packets not 
transmitted, a packet indicating that the sensor is active is sent. 
To assure that the results are reliable, the results were 
compared to those obtained in [22]. In [22], three scenarios are 
analyzed with the same sources and parameters, using seven 
sensors in the system, and the simulator was developed in C++ 
Builder. 
In [22], the analyzed scenarios are based on five sources 
listed in Table I, configured with the same parameters showed 
in Table II of this work. However, it was not considered the 
walk and propagation times, which is taken into account in the 
present work. The three scenarios were consisted of: a) only 
constant sources; b) three constant sources and other four 
sources using different kind of sources listed in Table 1; c) 
mixed sources. The analysis was made based on the output link 
of 250 kbits/sec, and one, three, five and thousand buffer 
positions. The performance parameters were the packet loss 
and the average waiting time in the queues of the sensor nodes. 
The results of the simulations in the scenarios of paper [22]  
are consistent with those obtained in this new program because, 
it was found that the polling performs certain admission 
control, and with the FIFO scheduler the queue time is zero and 
there are not packet losses. For the polling, a summary of some 
of the results obtained in [22] are shown in Table III.

As shown in Table III, the smaller the buffer size is,the 
higher the number of dropped packets is, but the queue time is 
less. In this sense, depending on the application being 
performed is important to consider the ideal buffer size. 
The packet losses are small if compared to the amount of 
packets on the system, corresponding to 70000 packets. It is 
noteworthy that most sources do not transmit all packets, which 
is achieved only by the constant source. In this respect, if the 
loss occurs in one of the sources that transmitted only relevant 
data, although being an approximate percentage of 7%, this 
value can be prohibitive. 
Analyzing scenarios regarding the packet loss and the 
queue time, the ideal is the Scenario II. 
IV. 
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS 
The first result to observe is that the polling access scheme 
performs a kind of admission control in relation to the sink 
node buffer and regardless of transmission rate, buffer size and 
number of sensors, there is no packet loss and the queue time is 
zero. 
Figure 2 shows the packet discarding in the sensor nodes by 
using polling access scheme. In the figure, the discarding is 
plotted as a function of buffer size, link capacity and number of 
sensors.  
From Figure 2 it can be seen that using transmission rate of 
MicaZ, that is, 250 Kbits/sec, there are no dropped packets, 
regardless of the buffer size or the number of sensors.  
It is also noted that with the rate of 38.4 Kbits/sec, 
corresponding to the Mica2Dot the discarding with seven 
sensors is small, or 97 packets lost with one buffer position and 
none if the buffer is increased. Increasing the number of sensor 
nodes to fourteen, the discarding is 2503, 48, 2, 0 for the buffer 
sizes 1, 3, 5 and 1000, respectively. There is no longer impact 
with twenty-one sensor nodes in the system, because with three 
and five positions in the buffer the difference in the loss is the 
nine packets, which is negligible. With twenty-eight sensors in 
the system the same occur, where the discarding is less with 
one thousand buffer positions which resulted in 48460 
discarded packets. 
The packet loss increases considerably if the capacity is 
reduced by half to 19.2 Kbits/sec. For seven sensors and one 
position buffer the lost is 1909 packets, whereas the loss for 
twice of the capacity is only 97. For fourteen sensors in the 
system the discarding is approximately 19000 for one, three 
and five positions buffer and the 10000 packets for thousand 
positions. For twenty-one sensors and twenty eight sensors in 
the system the discarding has similar behavior but higher than 
last case analyzed as is shown in Figure 2.  
 It can be concluded that the transmission rate and number 
of sensor nodes are the most impacting factors regarding to the 
packet loss in a WBSN based on polling access scheme. The 
analysis shows that the capacity of 250 Kbits/sec has better 
performance, but there are no studies yet showing the influence 
of this rate in the human body in the literature searched. Thus, 
it seems that the capacity of 38.4 Kbits/sec is most appropriate 
for a WBSN in study.   
In relation to the number of sensors, the human body could 
be divided into seven regions and   two sensors could be placed 
in each region, totaling fourteen sensors, giving a system 
without considerable loss. At last, the buffer with three 
positions could be chosen because there is no much difference 
in packet loss between three and five positions when the 
number of sensors exceeds twenty.  
Table IV shows the results of the queue waiting time in 
function of the buffer size, the number of sensors and the 
channel capacity.

Discarded packets using the polling 
The channel capacity is the parameter that most affect the 
queue waiting time as can be observed in Table IV. The use of 
transmission rate of 250 Kbit/sec becomes the waiting time 
almost insensitive to the variations of number of sensor nodes 
or buffer sizes, keeping very low from 1.55 to 7.93 msec. For 
the transmission rate of 38.4 Kbit/sec, up to fourteen sensor 
nodes the waiting time is low from 7.10 to 39.77 msec for any 
size buffer. However, for number of nodes of 21 and 28, the 
waiting time increases drastically for 1000 size buffer, meaning 
that load is too high for the system. For the transmission rate of 
19.2 Kbit/sec, the waiting time is reasonable only for 7 sensor 
nodes; for other cases the waiting times are prohibitive.

Keeping the tradeoff between queue waiting time and the 
transmission rate, it seems that the number of fourteen sensor 
nodes and the transmission rate of 38.4 Kbits/sec are good 
choices for WBSN based on polling access scheme. 
The third parameter analyzed is the number of authorization 
packets as shown in Figure 3. 
As can be noticed in Figure 3, higher the transmission rate 
is greater is the amount of authorization packets. This occurs 
because the data packets are quickly transmitted and not 
always that the sensor authorized to transmit has the data 
packets in the queue at that time. In addition, none packet is 
dropped.  
If the network is operating with low load, in stable 
condition, there is no significant variation in the amount of 
authorization packet when buffer sizes are considered. For 
example, considering the transmission rate of 250 Kbits/sec, 
seven sensors in the system and one position of the buffer, the 
amount of authorizations is the 5392633. Whereas considering 
thousand positions in the buffer the amount is 5481470. With 
fourteen sensors in the system this difference is 2683 packets, 
which indicates that fourteen sensor nodes are best for the 
WBSN based on polling access scheme.  
Another factor analyzed is the source models. Considering 
the transmission rate of 250 Kbits/sec and any kind of source 
there is no packet loss. For other rates, the loss is greater in 
constant source, because it sends all packets generated. For 
example, the loss considering transmission rate of 38.4 
Kbits/sec is shown in Table V.

As can be seen in Table IV, the packet loss in the constant 
source is higher than any other type of sources, especially when 
there are more sensors in the system.  
Since there are twice more sources with the control 
parameter, the packet loss in these sources is divided by two, 
and the influence of these sources is few. This division is 
necessary to compare equally the amount of packets generated 
by all sources.  The packet loss in the oriented event sources is 
small until fourteen sensors and similar. However, it can be 
representative, since only packets indicating changes in 
measurements are send.  
In Table V, it can also be seen that fourteen sensors and the 
three positions buffer in the system is better if the system is in 
stable operation. However, with twenty-one sensors the system 
is already operating in overload condition, so that the discards 
are greatly increased, and the same occurs when using the rate 
of 19.2 kbits/sec. This fact can be seen in Figure 2, while in 
Table IV it is evident that the constant source has higher losses.   
Analyzing the influence of source types in queue time, it 
can be noticed that for transmission rate of 250 Kbits/sec, the

impact is low independent of the buffer sizes, since all have the 
same time, which is 1.55 sec with seven sensors, 3.3 sec with 
fourteen sensors, 5.5 sec with twenty-one sensors and with 
twenty eight sensors is 8 sec.  
For other transmission rates, the behavior of the queue 
times is similar to the packet discarding. For example, with the 
rate of 38.4 Kbits/sec, seven sensors, independent of the buffer 
size and type of the source, the queue time is 7.33 sec. For 
fourteen sensors in the system the average queue time does not 
have many differences between sources, which are 36.5 sec. 
However, from fourteen sensors and the rate of 19.2 Kbits/sec, 
where the system is already operating in overload condition, 
the variations are considerable, and the constant source has the 
longest waiting time. The influence of other source types is low 
because they don’t transmit all data generated and the 
degradation occurs in the following order: Controlled Out-
range, Out-range, Controlled Threshold, Threshold.

CONCLUSIONS 
The impact of source parameters and radio link capacity on 
a WBSN based on polling access scheme was analyzed in this 
paper. The influence of different source types and link 
capacities on packet waiting time and packet loss at sensor 
node buffers was examined. A simulation platform was 
developed in Matlab to carry out the study. The used 
parameters were the number of sensor nodes, the transmission 
rate, number of positions in the buffer, amount of authorization 
packet and the source type.  
The first result is that the polling access scheme performs a 
kind of admission control in relation to the sink node because 
at output buffer of sink node does not occur packets loss and 
the queue waiting time is zero regardless of the scenario 
considered.  
When the system is in stable operation, the amount of 
packets discarded is little or nonexistent, as occurs using the 
transmission rates of 250 Kbits/sec and 38.4 Kbits/sec with 
seven and fourteen sensor nodes. However, if the system is 
operating in overload condition, a significant packet loss is 
observed. The analysis of results shows that the use of three 
position buffer and fourteen sensors for a WBSN based on 
polling access scheme are recommended when the packet 
waiting time and packet loss are considered. These results can 
be used to establish practical environment when using polling 
access scheme, ie, do not used  transmission rates under of 38.4 
Kbits/sec, more than fourteen sensor nodes and the five 
position buffer with this scheduler.   
It was observed that the constant source generates more 
packets discarded, and packet waiting time is longer. This is 
because all packets are transmitted. However, in other types of 
source that send only controlled information, the packet loss, 
although smaller, can be more critical because there is no 
redundancy in the transmitted data. Therefore, the use of mixed 
sources is more recommended.  
In future work, the impact of polling cycle of the sensor 
nodes on packet waiting time and loss will be analyzed in 
function of source types, as well as changing the size of the 
authorization packet. The problems of interference of many 
people who wear a WBSN based on polling scheme and 
gathered in a small area such as a coach will be also 
investigated.
