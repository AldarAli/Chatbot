Abstract—Many not yet discovered volcanoes may be hidden
under thick layers of ice in Antarctica. Discovery of two
volcanoes active under the ice (from seismic network), new
gravitational field models with high resolution (like EIGEN
6C4) based also on gradiometry data from satellite GOCE and
progress in mapping topography of bedrock (BEDMAP 2),
mostly from remote sensing by satellites, has been inspiring to
seek for hypothetic volcanoes hidden under ice of Antarctica
by using these data sources. Our method is novel. We do not
work
with
direct
measurements
like
terrestrial
gravity
anomalies
or
airborne
gradiometry,
but
with
spherical
harmonic expansion for the gravitational potential.
This
approach is not local, but regional and global, thus it has a
lower resolution than the local data. We make use of analogy
with the “gravitational signal” known for volcanoes and other
structures in other parts of the Earth. We utilize various
functionals
and
functions
(not
only
ordinary
gravity
anomalies) of the disturbing geopotential (being represented by
harmonic coefficients in expansion of the potential to spherical
harmonic series, namely by EIGEN 6C4 to degree and order
2160). We claim that our method is promising for future
successful search for subglacial volcanoes, having of course in
hands also other than satellite data. Our present-day attempts
to discover such volcanoes hardly can be of big success,
because of low resolution (mainly) of the existing gravity data
and (partly) due to a low resolution of even the best bedrock
topography of Antarctica now available.

INTRODUCTION
Many not yet discovered volcanoes may be hidden
under thick layers of ice of Antarctica. New gravity and
topography data now available (see Section III) inspired us
to try to detect such objects. We had experience with studies
of other objects in other parts of the world [3][4] and we
utilized it here. But, there are some problems specific to
Antarctica. We had to answer the following questions. Are
the best present-day available gravitational and topographic
data of sufficient precision and resolution? How fast is an
attenuation of the “gravitational signal” of a volcano with
increasing depth under the ice?
We have not found any principal problem precluding a
successful detection of large volcanoes under the ice. But,
there is a practical obstacle in the low resolution of the
gravity (mainly) and topography data (also), even coming
from the best now available data sets, so practical examples
of detected volcanoes are limited to a few cases in Queen
Maud Land and near the Lake Vostok.
The attenuation of the signal under the ice for the
gravity anomaly is not significant; the attenuation for the
second radial derivative of the disturbing potential is
negligible.

THEORY
Theory related to the present work in progress comes
mainly from Pedersen and Rasmussen (1990) [1], Beiki and
Pedersen (2010) [2] and from our previous research work
[3][4].
III.
DATA
Data are of two types of data of interest: gravitational
and topographic, both with significant contribution to remote
sensing methods. (1) The gravitational data are the harmonic
geopotential coefficients (also known as Stokes parameters)
in the spherical expansion of the disturbing gravitational
potential into the spherical series. European Improved
Gravity model of the Earth by New techniques (EIGEN 6C4,
[5]) is expanded to degree and order 2190 in spherical
harmonics. It corresponds to a resolution of 5x5 arc minutes,
which is ~9 km half-wavelength on the Earth’s surface. But
the resolution in Antarctica is lower due to the fact that there
we have solely satellite data (GRACE and GOCE) available
in EIGEN 6C4. (2) The topography of the ground under ice
(bedrock, base of the ice sheets) in Antarctica is known as
BEDMAP 2 [6], being compiled from measurements of
various kinds, with penetrating radars to the ground or water
under the ice, with a resolution reaching 1x1 km in some
areas of Antarctica and a few kilometres in the others. A
combination of both sources is also possible, but a mutual
independency of EIGEN 6C4 and BEDMAP 2 is lost.

COMPUTATIONS AND RESULTS
The gravity anomalies or disturbances, the Marussi
tensor of the second derivatives, with the invariants and their
ratios, the strike angle and with the virtual deformations are
computed with our own software [7][8] in 5x5 arcmin grid
everywhere where we need it. We learnt how the typical
signal of volcanoes looks like outside Antarctica (e.g.,
[3][4]) and we now extrapolate to Antarctica under ice. We
combine the gravitational data and the bedrock topography
and seek for signal typical for a volcano simultaneously for
more functionals or functions of the geopotential (examples
in Figure 1 below). We indicate localities in the Gamburtsev
Mountains, Queen Maud Land and other places (one
example is in Figure 3) with candidates for volcanoes.
V.
CONCLUSION
Our
method,
based
on
combining
gravity
and
topography data, is promising for future successful search
(with new forthcoming data with higher resolution) for
subglacial volcanoes and other objects hidden under the ice
(or elsewhere, for example under the sand of the Sahara),
having of course in hand also other than satellite data only.
Our present-day attempts to discover such volcanoes hardly
can be of big success, because of low resolution (mainly) of
the existing gravity data and (partly) due to low resolution
of the best bedrock topography of Antarctica now available.
But we achieved some results, of those we present here one
example to show how it works in the case of known
volcanoes (Figure 2) and one case of predicted, hypothetical
volcano (Figure 3).
