Abstract—In recent years, various economic reports are 
published and they are important tools in all markets. However, 
it is necessary to consult a lot of news articles in order to write 
an economic report. In this paper, we propose a method for 
effectively extracting news articles including important events 
related to the fluctuation of the Nikkei Stock Average by using 
Japanese sentiment lexicons. The results of the experiments 
show that the proposed method reduces the number of articles 
by about half and retrieves relevant documents better than the 
method using only stock price fluctuations. Therefore, the 
Japanese sentiment lexicons is effective for extracting news 
articles including important events. 
Keywords- economic articles extraction; sentiment analysis;

 INTRODUCTION 
In today's information society, many individual investors 
try to stay up to date with the latest situations by reading news 
articles on the web. The news articles describe happenings that 
are currently occurring in the world and contain information 
valuable for various purposes. Thus, it is important for 
investors and traders to be aware of current market situations. 
However, with the exponentially increasing amount of 
available news articles, it has become a critical matter to 
utilize the information from these data in decision making 
process. 
There are various approaches to perform event detection 
in news articles to help analysts to analyse large amounts of 
financial news articles. For example, Nakayama et al. propose 
a method that adds the words appearing in the article and the 
words appearing in the web page of the company, and uses 
these words as input for Support Vector Machine (SVM) [1]. 
In addition, Sakai et al. proposed a method to extract causal 
information as a causal expression using statistical 
information and initial cue expressions [2] , and Milea et al. 
proposed a method using fuzzy grammars [3]. In this existing 
approaches, we focus on research that analyses the 
relationship between stock price fluctuations and news articles 
using text mining techniques. Valuable and significant 
information related to the financial markets is now available 
easily on the Internet. Hence, it is neither insignificant nor 
simple to obtain valuable information and analyse the 
relationship between the information obtained and the 
financial markets. However, some existing studies have 
automatically generated reports by extracting important 
events and performance factors from previously extracted 
important news articles. Therefore, there were few studies that 
automatically extracted important news articles from a large 
number of news articles.  
In this paper, we propose a method to extract important 
articles related to the fluctuation of the Nikkei Stock Average 
by using Japanese sentiment lexicons from financial news 
articles. In the proposed method, we show that the use of the 
Japanese sentiment lexicons is effective for extracting useful 
news articles. By using the proposed method, it is possible to 
automatically extract useful articles for making reports from a 
large amount of news article data. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is 
devoted to the related works in the literature. Section 3 
describes the proposed important news extraction method. We 
describe an outline of experiments in Section 4 and 
experimental results in Section 5. Finally, we discuss the 
results in Section 6 and concludes the paper in Section 7.

RELATED WORKS AND METHODS 
This section presents the related works and methods 
related to our research. 
 
A. Related Works 
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in 
applying neural networks and machine learning techniques to 
solve this task. First, we introduce some researches related to 
the analysis of fluctuation of the Nikkei Stock Average.  
 Nakayama et al. used the Nihon Keizai Shimbun to 
extract articles that describe events that affect the stock prices 
of some selected companies [1]. In this paper, they propose a 
method that adds the words appearing in the article and the 
words appearing in the web page of the company, and uses 
these words as input for SVM. This method improved the 
accuracy by 27.2% compared to the method before adding the 
words in the web page. However, this experiment does not 
take into account the combination with the Nikkei Stock 
Average. 
Sakai et al proposed to use Japanese financial news to 
extract information on the causes of fluctuations in corporate 
performance [2]. In this paper, causal information is extracted 
as causal expressions using statistical information and initial 
cue expressions. As a result, the accuracy of the method was 
79.2%, which is better than the result of the conventional 
method. 
Milea et al, proposed to predict the movement of the MSCI 
Euro Index from the report prepared by the European Central 
Bank (ECB) [3]. In this paper, they used a fuzzy grammar to 
32

PATTERNS 2021 : The Thirteenth International Conference on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

create their model. As a result, the results are the same as in 
previous studies, but the model is simplified. 
As mentioned above, there have been many studies on 
predicting and extracting the causes of fluctuations from 
various texts, but few studies have focused on extraction of 
important articles related to the stock price fluctuation to 
generate investor reports. In this study, we focused on the 
extraction of important articles related to the Nikkei Stock 
Average. 
Next, we introduce some researches related to the financial 
text analysis based on sentiment dictionary. 
Sato et al. investigated the correlation with stock price 
fluctuations using a sentiment analysis for news articles in 
Japan [4]. The results showed that all correlations were low 
and no correlation could be found between them. 
Yazdani et al. proposed a classification method to classify 
financial news articles into positive or negative class [5]. In 
their experiments, they used the N-gram models unigram, 
bigram, and a combination of unigram and bigram as feature 
extraction, and used Document Frequency (DF) to evaluate 
the N-gram models and traditional feature weighting methods.  
The results show that the feature selection and feature 
weighting methods play a significant role in the negative-
positive classification of articles. 
Yadav et al. proposed an unsupervised learning model for 
sentiment classification of financial news articles [6]. The 
experiment was conducted by using POS based feature 
extraction with seed set and noun-verb combination in the 
traditional method. The results showed that using the noun-
verb combination was better than the traditional method. 
With reference to the above studies, we decided to focus 
on sentiment expressions. 
 
B. Sentiment Expression  
There are two types of words: those that give a good 
impression (positive) and those that give a bad impression 
(negative). These words are expressed by converting them 
into numerical values, which is called sentiment information. 
One of the ways to convert sentiment information is to use a 
sentiment dictionary. A sentiment dictionary is a dictionary of 
values determined for each word. The sentiment dictionary we 
used this time was provided by the Okumura-Takamura 
Laboratory at Tokyo Institute of Technology [7]. The 
sentiment dictionary is expressed using numbers between 1 
and -1, where the closer the number is to 1, the more positive 
the word is, and the closer the number is to -1, the more 
negative the word is. In this study, we use this method to 
convert news articles into numerical values. 
 
C. Morphological Analysis 
Unlike other languages, Japanese is characterized by the 
fact that words are not separated, but are written consecutively. 
Therefore, it is necessary to divide a sentence into separate 
words. Morphological analysis is a technology that allows a 
machine to do this automatically. 
In this study, we used a morphological analysis package 
called janome. This janome uses dictionaries used by a 
morphological analysis engine called MeCab, which can 
perform morphological analysis with high accuracy, so it can 
perform morphological analysis with the same high accuracy 
as MeCab. 
In addition, these morphological analysis engines can not 
only segment each word, but also analyse the parts of speech 
and conjugations of the segmented words.

As an example, the morphological analysis of "私は明日
東京へ出発します"( I am leaving for Tokyo tomorrow) is 
shown in Figure 1. 
 
III. 
EXTRACTION METHOD USING SENTIMENT 
EXPRESSION 
In this section, we present a method to extract news 
articles that have information related to the fluctuation of the 
Nikkei Stock Average. 
 
A. Overview of the Proposed Method 
Figure 2 shows a rough sequence of the proposed method.  
"Headline" in the figure is the title of the news article. 
"Date" is the date when the news article was published. 
"Open" is the opening price of the Nikkei Stock Average. 
"Close" is the closing price of the Nikkei Stock Average. 
"Positive", "neutral", and "negative" are numerical values for 
each word in the headline. "Positive score", "neutral score", 
and "negative score" are each summarized for each day.  
First, we select data from article data and stock price data. 
Since the article data contains some articles that may be noisy, 
we select articles under certain conditions. The details are 
introduced in Section B. We considered the correct article to 
be an article about a major event related to the fluctuation of 
the Nikkei Stock Average.  
Next, the selected articles are polarity transformed. Before 
polarity transformation, it is necessary to divide the keywords 
of the articles into the smallest units of words. Therefore, the 
keywords are first analysed by morphological analysis, and 
then converted into numerical values by the polarity 
dictionary. The detailed conversion method will be explained 
in Section C. 
Then, we use the obtained polarity to calculate whether the 
article is a positive or negative article on stock prices. The 
method is to calculate the three percentages of whether the 
33

{headline,date} 
{date, open, close} 
{headline,date} 
{date, positive score, 
neutral score, negative score} 
{date, positive, neutral, negative} 
article is positive, negative, or irrelevant (neutral). The 
detailed calculation method will be explained in Section D. 
Finally, we extract articles from the results of polarity 
representation. Articles with positive values in the top 75% 
and negative values in the bottom 25% are extracted. At this 
time, if duplicates often occur in both values, the duplicates 
are removed. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Flow of the Proposed Method 
 
We compare the percentage of articles that contain major 
events related to the fluctuation of the Nikkei Stock Average 
between the extracted set of articles and the unextracted set of 
articles to verify the effectiveness of sentiment expression. 
 
B. Preprocessing 
First of all, we need to sort out the data from Nikkei 
QUICK News, which we use, because there are some news 
articles that are not related to the Nikkei Stock Average, such 
as sports articles. The first step is to limit the news articles to 
two sources, "QUICK" and "NQN". Since these two sources 
only provide news about stocks, we limited ourselves to these 
two sources. 
Next, news articles distributed by "QUICK" and "NQN" 
include a mixture of news articles summarizing the past and 
news articles about a company's sales. These articles can have 
a negative impact on the use of sentiment expressions. 
Therefore, we removed such articles. 
In addition, we considered that news articles related to the 
fluctuation of the Nikkei Stock Average were likely to be 
transmitted on the days when major fluctuations occurred. 
Therefore, we limited ourselves to the news articles that were 
published on days when the Nikkei Stock Average was more 
than 1% or less than -1% compared to the previous day. In this 
paper, such days are referred to as Fluctuation Day. 
Finally, in some of the data used in this study, the 
keywords of the news articles are empty. In this paper, the 
articles with empty keywords are also removed in order to use 
these keywords for polarity conversion. 
 
C. Sentiment Conversion 
Sentiment conversion of articles limited by preprocessing 
into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. Neutral 
means a word that is neither positive nor negative. For this 
conversion, we morphologically analyse the keywords in the 
news article. This is because the words present in the 
sentiment dictionary are the smallest words registered in 
natural 
language. 
The 
words 
obtained 
from 
this 
morphological analysis are compared with the sentiment 
dictionary and converted into numerical values. Positive 
values are considered positive, and negative values are 
considered negative. If the word does not exist in the 
sentiment dictionary, it is considered a neutral word and 
converted to 0. If the word is not in the sentiment dictionary, 
it is considered a neutral word and converted to 0. 
Furthermore, words that are replaced with 0 when converted 
to numerical values are treated as neutral words. This is done 
for all articles. 
 
D. Negative-Positive Calculation 
Each of the positive, negative, and neutral values 
converted in the previous section are combined into one. In 
this experiment, we averaged the positive, negative, and 
neutral values for each article and used the individual values 
to find the percentage of each. The reason for using 
percentages is that the number of keywords in each article is 
different, and it is easy to extract articles with many keywords 
using only the average. Therefore, this time we will use the 
average value to obtain the percentage. Specifically, we used 
the formula below to calculate the percentage. Since neutral 
words are less important than positive and negative words, 
the average of all neutral words is set to 1 if neutral words 
exist, and 0 otherwise.

IV. 
EXPERIMENTS 
The experimental procedure based on the proposed 
method is shown. 
A. Data Set 
In this study, we used data compiled from Nikkei QUICK 
News for 2016 and 2017 and the prices of the Nikkei Stock 
Average for 1747 days from 2011 to 2017, as well as a polar 
dictionary provided by Okumura and Takamura laboratories 
at Tokyo Institute of Technology [7]. 
 
B. Settings 
In this experiment, we decided to focus on three important 
events: the Ise-Shima Summit, the U.S. presidential election, 
and the North Korean missile launch. Therefore, the 
experiment was conducted every month in the month in which 
these events occurred. In doing so, articles that included "サ
ミット"(summit), "選挙"(election), and "地政学リスク
"(geopolitical risk) as keywords in their articles were 
considered as correct articles. 
• 
May 2016: Ise-Shima Summit 
• 
November 2016: U.S. presidential election 
• 
August 2017: geopolitical risk 
In addition, the U.S. is often involved in the fluctuations 
of the Nikkei Stock Average. Therefore, we conducted an 
experiment with an article set that was limited to articles that 
contained "米国"(U.S.) or "アメリカ"(America) in the 
keywords of the articles. In this study, we refer to this set of 
articles as the set of articles containing "U.S.". 
Thus, this study was conducted using two patterns of data 
for each of the three events. 
 
V. 
RESULTS 
The results of an experiment conducted based on the 
experimental method are shown below. 
 
A. Results of the May 2016 Article Set 
The results done in May 2016 are shown in Table 1 below. 
Also, there are six Fluctuation Days: 2, 10, 13, 17, 25, and 30. 
 
TABLE I. 
RESULTS OF THE MAY 2016 ARTICLE SET 
 
In the table, "F.D" refers to Fuctuation Day.  Also, "F.D + 
U.S." refers to the set of articles that include "U.S.". In 
addition, "F.D +senti" and “F.D +U.S. +senti” are the results 
of extraction using sentiment expressions. "Total correct 
articles" is the number of correct articles for each condition. 
"Total articles" is the number of articles when the data is 
sorted under each condition. "Percentage" is the ratio of 
correct articles to the total number of articles. "Rise in value" 
is the increase in percentage after the experiment.

DISCUSSIONS 
In this section, we discuss the experimental results and 
show 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
problems 
of 
polarity 
representation. 
 
A. Validity of Sentiment Expression 
The results of Section 5 show that all article sets have a 
better percentage of articles containing information related to 
the fluctuation of the Nikkei Stock Average, except for the 
extraction performed on the article set for the Fluctuation Day 
of November 2016. In addition, this extraction method

reduced the original article set by almost half, which means 
that we were able to reduce the number of articles that need 
to be manually examined. 
The reason for the worse results in November 2016 was 
that there were articles on Clinton's email problem and 
articles on the current status of the presidential election that 
did not include "選挙"(election) as a keyword. Therefore, it 
is thought that such articles were extracted rather than articles 
containing "選挙"(election) and thus the good results were 
not obtained. 
Considering the above, we believe that the use of 
sentiment expressions is effective in extracting articles that 
have information related to the fluctuation of the Nikkei 
Stock Average. 
 
B. Inadequate Preprocessing 
From the results of Section 5, we can see that both the 
percentage and the upward value of the set of articles 
including "U.S." are better than the set of Fluctuation Day. 
This was probably due to the fact that we were able to remove 
articles that were not so relevant to the fluctuation of the 
Nikkei Stock Average, such as news about companies, since 
the percentage was better just by limiting the articles to those 
that included "U.S.". Therefore, the pre-processing of this 
experiment alone is not enough to sort out the data. 
In the future, it is necessary to review the data selection 
process and to improve the weighting of each article. 
 
C. Optimal Threshold for Front-to-back Comparison 
This study was limited to the days when the Nikkei Stock 
Average was more than 1% or less than -1% compared to the 
previous day. Therefore, differences occur in the number of 
days examined in different months. In this study, there were 
six days in May 2016 and seven days in November 2016, but 
in August 2017, there were only three days, less than half. 
Furthermore, in August 2017, only the 9th, 15th, and 18th 
were Fluctuation Day, so it was not possible to take articles 
from the beginning and end of the month. Therefore, it is 
necessary to adjust this threshold of the Nikkei Stock 
Average compared to the previous day from month to month. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this study, news articles related to the fluctuation of the 
Nikkei Stock Average were extracted from the price 
information of the Nikkei Stock Average and Nikkei QUICK 
News by using sentiment expressions. The news articles were 
converted into numerical values from the sentiment 
dictionary, and the articles were extracted from these values. 
To verify the effectiveness of the extraction method using 
sentiment expressions, we compared the percentage of news 
articles related to the fluctuation with the original set of 
articles. As a result, the number of articles in the article set 
was reduced by almost half when the extraction method using 
sentiment expressions was used, and the percentage of 
articles included in the articles related to fluctuations also 
increased. Thus, we were able to confirm the effectiveness of 
polar expressions. 
Future tasks include improving the pre-processing data 
selection method, weighting of each article, and adjustment 
of the fluctuation date threshold for each month.
