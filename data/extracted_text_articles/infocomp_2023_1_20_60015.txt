Abstract—This paper presents the results of the methodological
discovery and parallelisation of workﬂow logic of prehistorical
archaeology discipline’s contextualisation, based on coherent
multi-disciplinary
conceptual
knowledge.
The
goal
is
the
creation of eﬃcient, ﬂexible, and sustainable contextualisation
workﬂows, also providing eﬃcient parallelised frame conversion.
Implementations and realisations are enabled by the latest
versions
of
the
prehistory-protohistory
and
archaeology
conceptual
knowledge
reference
implementation
and
the
component reference implementations framework. The paper
provides
the
results
on
archaeological / prehistorical
facts,
universal contexts, and logical and formal entities, factual,
conceptual,
and
procedural
complements,
components,
and
results required for exemplary practical hard criteria and
fact-based contextualisation by the disciplines and even for
consequent
creative
historico-cultural
exploitation.
Future
research will address the creation and further development
of
a
conceptual
knowledge
reference
implementation
and
a
component
reference
framework
for
coherent
multi-
disciplinary
conceptual
contextualisation,
enabling
multi-
disciplinary equal footing with contributions from all scientiﬁc
disciplines for example for prehistorical archaeology knowledge
integration, contextualisation and analysis with prehistorical and
archaeological knowledge resources.

Introduction
The need to implement workﬂows of many disciplines
beyond ‘manual operation’ has been continuously increasing
over the last decades. In practice, we can also see a strong
motivation for sustainable Knowledge Resources (KR) creation
and development and eﬃcient employment of resources, e.g.,
with high performance computation and storage.
After reading, writing, and arithmetic are established and
accepted as general competences, the capabilities of achieving
eﬃcient analysis and contextualisation solutions are becoming
‘state-of-the-art’ increasingly important personal competences
in the sciences. Eﬃciently and sustainably organising and
de-isolating knowledge complements, the results of research,
within a discipline is at least as important as its short term
analysis. These organisation processes cannot refer only to
the data if they should be useful for reuse of knowledge
and insight. Therefore, such organisation can in no ways be
seen technically or being task of third parties without risk
of losing the competence on fact-based methods, insight,
and interpretation. Additionally, organisation of its knowledge
complements is a core scientiﬁc matter of any discipline
and closely associated with the methods employed, with the
ongoing analysis processes, and with the further interpretation
potential. In accordance with best practice, any scientists
dealing with methodological workﬂows in a discipline, e.g.,
when applying a method, should know and practice themselves
the way steps can be created, organised, and implemented, e.g.,
the algorithms, symbolic representation, and the structure and
computation related characteristics. This practice is especially
relevant with all knowledge complements or in other words
the non-technical aspects of workﬂows in prehistorical ar-
chaeology. Scientiﬁc work, including state-of-the-art practices
in archaeological disciplines and humanities, comprise of a
number of essential principles, including further continuous
employment of valuation methods for new factual knowl-
edge and insights, re-contextualisation and resources devel-
opment, and consequent fact-based contextualisation, analysis,
and interpretation. When done properly, the tasks including
contextualisation allow to practice equal footing with con-
tributing scientiﬁc disciplines. Numerous surveys and studies
were conducted for archaeological and prehistorical cases
and multi-disciplinary contexts during the last decades, e.g.,
speciﬁc object groups’ contextualisation [1] and discovery [2]
and providing factual knowledge for interpretation, including
historico-cultural contexts. The Prehistory and Archaeology
Knowledge Archive (PAKA) is continuously collecting [3] new
knowledge and insight. This research delivers the respective
blueprints resulting from previously unpublished contexts and
workﬂows and eﬃcient workﬂow implementations proven sus-
tainable over many years and widely reusable.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II
presents the fundaments and state-of-the-art methodologi-
cal implementations and realisations employed. Section III
presents the results of the contexts and workﬂow logic for
processes in prehistorical archaeology, factual/conceptual and
procedural complements. Section IV delivers the discipline’s
results, eﬃciency results, and discussion for the presented
contexts and workﬂow logic cases. Section V summarises
lessons learned, conclusions, and future work.

Fundaments and Previous Work
Two major practical reference implementations were de-
ployed for full implementations, realisations, and continuous
further developments: the latest versions of the prehistory-
protohistory and archaeology Conceptual Knowledge Refer-
ence Implementation (CKRI) [1] and the Component Ref-
erence Implementations (CRI) framework [4] for conceptual
knowledge-based context integration, complements processing,
and geoscientiﬁc visualisation. CKRI provides the universal
knowledge framework, including multi-disciplinary contexts of
natural sciences and humanities [5]. CRI provides the required
component groups and components for the implementation

and realisation of all the procedural modules. The reference
implementations are based on the fundamental methodology
of knowledge complements [6], considering that many facets
of knowledge, including prehistory, need to be continuously
acquired and reviewed [7]. Creating contextualisation requires
to coherently integrate multi-disciplinary knowledge and to
enable symbolic representations. Realisations need to integrate
a wide range of components as required from participating dis-
ciplines, e.g., for dynamical processing, geoprocessing, spatial
contextualisation. Prehistoric object groups and contexts are
taken from the latest edition of PAKA, which is in continuous
development for more than three decades [8], and from The
Natural Sciences KR (NatSciKR), all released by DIMF [3].
The PAKA and The NatSciKR support Factual, Concep-
tual, Procedural, Metacognitive, Structural (FCPMS) knowl-
edge complements [9] and enable seamless coherent multi-
disciplinary conceptual knowledge integration for workﬂow
procedures. systematical and methodological approaches based
on CKRI. CKRI references are illustrated for demonstration

summary [10] released by the UDC Consortium under Creative

III.
Discipline’s Contexts and Workflow Logic
Prehistorical archaeology discipline’s resulting contexts and
workﬂow logic are often matter of multi-disciplinary long-term
research, which requires universal context identiﬁcation and
assignment to contributing scientiﬁc disciplines.
A. Resulting Factual and Conceptual Complements Blueprint
The discipline’s factual and conceptual knowledge comple-
ments and major logical and formal entities resulting from
the long-term surveys and practical implementations are given
in Table I. Employed resources are High Resolution (HR)
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, e.g., (Space) Shuttle
Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data [12], updates [13],
and further satellite data. Common DEM can be supplemented
by local Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data for
special features and resolutions. DEM data for spatial contexts
is used via Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) [14],
developed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research (UCAR/Unidata), National Center for Atmospheric
Research (NCAR). KR and complement implementations in
contributing contexts and disciplines are PAKA and NatSciKR
[3] accompanied by HR Digital Chart of the World (DCW)
[15], and Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution
Geography (GSHHG) [16]. The symbolic representation of the
contextualisation can be done with a wide range of methods,
algorithms, and available components, e.g., via LX Profes-
sional Scientiﬁc Content-Context-Suite (LX PSCC Suite) [17]
deploying the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) and integrated
modules [18] for visualisation. The GMT suite application
components are used for handling the spatial data, applying the
related criteria, and for the visualisation. For sustainability we
also consequently employ xyz ﬁles in GMT, e.g., Point of Inter-
est (PoI) and Point of Discovery (PoD) contexts. Signatures and
Colour Palettes (CPT) can also be ﬂexibly integrated via GMT.
Mostly all contexts and object groups are in continuous devel-
opment, based on their structural implementations. Practically
all contexts are dealt with employing the CKRI and its facets
and operation facilities. Many properties of the contexts, e.g.,
chorological and chronological properties, can be addressed
using international standards, e.g., for georeferencing and time.
The consequent knowledge approach enables a wide range of
workﬂow creation and analysis, in the scenarios discussed here
ranging from fact-based contextualisation to consequent fact-
based historico-cultural interpretation. The results allow even
further consequent creative historico-cultural exploitation.
B. Resulting Procedural Complements Blueprint
The discipline’s resulting procedural complements (the
knowledge complements) and the corresponding workﬂow im-
plementation resulting from the long-term surveys and practi-
cal implementations are given in Table II. The implementations
are designed for end-user deployment by members of every
responsible discipline dealing with their major logical and
formal entities. The matrix shows context / object groups,
required logical and formal workﬂow entities (major pro-
cessing groups pre, main, post), examples of their symbolic
representation, structure and procedure implementations. The
table conﬁrms that all contexts and object groups are in con-
tinuous further development, including the implementations of
knowledge complements, e.g., factual, conceptual, procedural,
and structural, which is a major achievement for scientiﬁc
best practice and sustainability. The characteristics include the
contexts addressed with CKRI and georeferencing, as well
as the potential of mostly all contexts can be deployed in
workﬂow parallelisation. The table especially lists excerpts
of embarrassingly (E) and loosely (L) parallelisation features.
The components of the workﬂow blueprint allow very high
ﬂexibility for fact-based methods and context integration of sci-
entiﬁc, fact-based symbolic representation, e.g., the symbolic
representation of archaeological, prehistorical contexts requires
the employment of diﬀerent geographic projections, e.g., geo-
spherical orthographic, isometrical, and equal area. Projections
can be ﬂexibly implemented via GMT [19] and via PROJ
[20]. Besides the implemented components we already named:
The workﬂow allows processing usable for most disciplines,
Area of Interest (AoI) calculations, regular expression pat-
terns for context structures, e.g., via Perl Compatible Regular
Expressions (PCRE) [21]. Attributations not applicable (n.a.)
are marked accordingly. Workﬂow output, e.g., frames and
visualisation can be created for many common structures, e.g.,
Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPG), Portable Network
Graphics (PNG), and Portable Document Format (PDF), as
well as Motion/Moving Pictures Expert Group, version 4
(MP4). Transformation can also be done for Keyhole Markup
Language generation.
Multi-dimensional or sequences of view, e.g., focus depen-
dent views for knowledge dimensional computation per object,
are implemented via OpenMP [22] and speciﬁcations [23], e.g.,
. Job parallel procedures, e.g., knowledge objects and resources
localities, are supported by respective modular solutions [24].

Discipline’s Results and Workflow Efficiency
A. Discipline’s Workﬂow: Parallelisation and Results
Table III shows the scalability of the example workﬂow
procedure for parallelised processing parts (pre, timing; main,
parallelisation; post, batch) of the coherent multi-disciplinary
conceptual knowledge. The results are referring to a scenario
of a set of 1440 frames created in parallel for 4 k canvas size
for a 60 s sequence with a rate of 24 FPS (Frames Per Second).

The architecture choosen for this realisation is an eﬃcient
36-core-based Central Processing Unit (CPU) (Intel Xeon),
which is taking into account that we commonly use 36 cores for
many basic global approaches, e.g., considering 360 degrees
of a global model. Precondition for parallelisation is suﬃcient
memory for parallel use of integrated resources. Considering
the employed resources, especially SRTM / NetCDF and KR,
128 GB RAM (Random Access Memory) for 36 parallel pro-
cesses is comfortable when data limits are cut to the limits
required for the algorithms with the range of a few hundred
kilometres area per object entity.

The parallel instances are allowed for 90 GB HDD (Hard
Disk Drive) space and separate 50 GB SSD (Solid State Disk)
space for highly volatile data of parallel instances. Wall and
compute times, especially of multi-dimensional workﬂow re-
sults, can greatly be reduced from the integrated parallelisation,
which makes the procedural solution highly scalable. The wall
times for thread numbers conﬁrm the high scalability when
implementations of the workﬂow are using higher numbers
of threads. Many practical workﬂows may contain some parts
which cannot be reasonably parallelised. This is especially true
for scientiﬁc tasks with a certain complexity. Anyhow, the
percentage of non parallelised parts is very low with CKRI
and the CRI framework. However, individual instances may
show non-linear characteristics due to instance content and
references, e.g., diﬀerent satellite data, diﬀerent data types, and
diﬀerent knowledge complements. For large sets, hundreds up
to thousands of CPU cores were employed, so parallelised wall
times per object can be very reasonably reduced from days to
hours or even minutes, e.g., for warning and tracking systems.

quence for calculated Areas of Interest (AoI) contexts in

this publication. Generated representations include integrated
CKRI references, projection of topographic and bathymetric
results, and further knowledge for respective areas, based
on the coherent conceptual knowledge. The frame sequence
of symbolic representations enable to contextualise named

Major multi-disciplinary results are the shown insights re-
garding the details of prehistoric settlement infrastructures /
Holocene maars for which we ﬁnd larger numbers of prehis-
torical settlements were set and used in the volcanic regions
Eifel (DE) and Auvergne (FR) areas than in the other areas, all
of which can be precisely assigned and further contextualised.
Ongoing analysis and discussion of the multitude of resulting
historico-cultural meanings will be given in later publications.
B. Discipline’s Workﬂow: Frame Conversion Benchmark
The number of parallel cores used for the making of
individual frames can be eﬃciently controlled. The parallel
processing itself does not depend on OpenMP. Table IV gives
the dimensions of canvas sizes for an excerpt of common
formats, represented by pixel (p) scales. The given formats
High Deﬁnition (HD), Ultra High Deﬁnition (UHD), Ultra
Extended Graphics Array (UXGA), Extended Graphics Array
(XGA), and Super XGA Plus (SXGA+) are commonly used in
resources development and practical high resolution workﬂows.

The conversion of frames can be done in parallel using

Processing Project (GOMP). Table V shows the frame conver-
sion benchmark results for diﬀerent canvas sizes as used in
the parallel implementations of practical case scenarios. The
results compare number of threads, iterations, user time, total
time, iterations per second, iterations per CPU, speedup, and

granite texture pattern iteration for standardisation. The bench-
mark uses the Karp-Flatt metric [27], which is a measure of
code parallelisation in parallel processor systems. The resulting
implementation is very scalable and can use practical workﬂow
parallelisations from small canvas sizes up to deﬁned sizes
even beyond UHD-2. Sizes of UHD are very appropriate
for many HR scenarios with commonly available technical
infrastructures while being relatively eﬃcient with resources.

Conclusion
This paper presented the results achieved for the method-
ological discovery and parallelisation of workﬂow logic of
contextualisation in prehistorical archaeology, based on coher-
ent multi-disciplinary conceptual knowledge. The implemented
workﬂows employed the latest versions of the prehistory-
protohistory and archaeology CKRI and the CRI framework.
The implemented and realised contextualisation workﬂows
proved eﬃcient, ﬂexible, and sustainable. The presented con-
texts, entities, and workﬂow implementations provide solid
fact-based fundaments for contextualisation and consequent
fact-based historico-cultural interpretation, procedures, which
should be deployed by members of the contributing disciplines.
Ongoing, the reference implementations and procedures
will be extended for generation of symbolic representation
for advanced multi-dimensional knowledge models. Future
research will address the creation and further development
of the prehistory-protohistory and archaeology CKRI and the
CRI framework for coherent multi-disciplinary conceptual con-
textualisation, enabling multi-disciplinary equal footing with
contributions from all scientiﬁc disciplines, e.g., natural sci-
ences, soil science, and linguistics, especially supporting new
advanced methods in prehistorical archaeology for knowledge
integration, contextualisation, and analysis.
