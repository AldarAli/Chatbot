Abstract—The usage and acceptance of Twitter microblogging
differs from region to region as various works have shown. As this
platform is gaining importance as a channel to reach customers
in the E-commerce, the question arises whether this differences
get apparent in the Twitter usage of online retailers as well. This
paper investigates this question by comparing German and UK
based online retailers empirically. A data set composed of the top
selling companies from both countries is analyzed quantitatively.
For this purpose, a conceptual model is presented to classify dif-
ferent interaction strategies for microblogging in the E-commerce
domain. There are four different strategies used to distinguish
between a more bidirectional, interactive communication and
a more unidirectional, promotional communication. The model
used distinguishes between direct dialogs inside the borders of
Twitters and the redirection of users to other social networks.

INTRODUCTION
The transformation of the Web from an unidirectional
media of linked content towards an interactive communica-
tion platform affects the E-commerce massively. Due to its
distributed nature, the Web 2.0 extends the range of channels
for distributing information to the (potential) customers re-
spectively. Another aspect is the bidirectional ﬂow of commu-
nication. This requires companies to take care of information
published by users and to react somehow to this.
A major actor in the social web is the microblogging
platform Twitter. Every day, about 500 million status messages
are published on this platform. Reasons for its success can be
found in its simplicity, scalability, ubiquity, and interactivity.
Due to its publish/subscribe capabilities, traditional newsfeeds
based on Rich Site Summary (RSS) or Atom are shifting grad-
ually to Twitter. This development applies to the E-commerce
as well, as within this domain microblogging plays the role of a
update notiﬁcation capability for tools for personalization and
direct customer interaction, e.g., discussion boards, weblogs or
newsfeeds.
In academia, a considerable amount of research was already
conducted to understand the usage of Twitter, in particular the
communication conventions, user intentions and the network
structure. Several works suggest that the usage of this platform
is related to regional characteristics (1)(2). A blog post by The
Economist states that Twitter is in Germany less popular than
in other countries (3). The data shows that the ratio of Twitter
accounts related to the size of population is a multiple times
higher in Great Britain than in Germany.
But to the best knowledge, there is no study that explicitly
investigated the Twitter usage of online retailers and compares
two different samples against each other. This paper examines
the following research questions:
1)
How many retailers in Germany are using Twitter
compared to the UK?
2)
Are there differences in how German retailers are
using Twitter compared to the UK?
To answer the above questions, an empirical study was
conducted. A sample was collected to compare the Twitter
usage in the E-commerce in Germany and UK. Question 1
is answered by hand of account related data retrieved from
the Twitter proﬁles. In order to answer question 2, a model
is presented to classify a communication strategy based on
directed messages and embedded URLs.
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, the
theoretical background is presented. Then, the research design
of the empirical study is explained in Section III. After that, the
results of the collection and analysis are presented in Section
IV and discussed in Section V. Finally, this paper concludes
with an outlook for future research.
II.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The main research areas addressed in this paper comprise
the social web and E-commerce. The combination of social
media and E-commerce are often denoted as Social Commerce
(4)(5). Most of the studies in Social Commerce investigate the
customers’ perspective to the platform Twitter. This study is
focused on the retailers’ perspective instead.
A. Conventions
The publish/subscribe capability is Twitter’s fundamental
pattern. The different possibilities for routing a status message
to other users are summarized in Fig 1. Users subscribe either
to other users or add another user to a list. Every message
issued gets by default submitted to the following users and to
all lists. To broaden the audience, one can embed Hashtags
(HTs). The use of HTs is a communication convention that
enables authors to post a message either to a community or to
add a content information (6). Besides that, messages can be
directed to a single user by annotating the user’s name with an
@-sign, which is called User Mention. Retweeting means the
redistribution of a Tweet to a user’s own audience (7). From
the Twitter API’s view, Hashtags, User Mentions and URLs
are treated as special entities. The use of these entities are
examined by (2) in a large scale study.

B. Purposes
Previous works have investigated that Twitter is used for
various communication purposes (8)(6). Twitter entries can be
classiﬁed in ﬁve different genres (9)(10): personal updates,
directed dialog, real-time sharing of news and links, business
broadcasting, and information seeking. For the study of E-
commerce related communication, the broadcasting behaviour
and dialogs are interesting. The success of broadcasting activ-
ities can be measured in the size of audience, redistribution
rate, and the ability to engage users in a dialog (11)(12)(13).
Dialogs can be identiﬁed by the use of the @-sign, which is
often used to direct a message to the user mentioned. Though,
this is no exact measure, the vast majority of @-signs are used
for UMs in Twitter (14) and, thus, can be used for indicating
the interactivity of an online relationship (15, p. 21 - 25).
Related to the E-commerce, by means of an explorative
observation of 200 Tweets from 10 online-retailers domain-
speciﬁc communication practices could be discovered:
•
News: Published news that are related to the business
domain of the retailer, without any direct relation to a
product or service offered by the company.
•
Review: Messages that contain links to a review about
a procuct or service offered by the company. The
status can be issued by the retailer or by a customer
an republished (retweeted) by the company.
•
Promotion: Tweets that promote products or services
directly. Those kind of messages often contain an URL
linking to the product page and the respective price of
the offer.
•
Dialog: Directed messages ﬂow betweet the retailer
and a customer. The purpose of such dialogs vary:
there are examples, where customers request further
information about a product or date of delivery via
Twitter.
•
Agent: Retailers mark their messages with an attribute
representing the issuing agent personally. This is a
communication convention, which is not explicitely
supported by Twitter, but used to facilitate directing
a message to a certain agent acting on behalf of a
company’s account. Mainly, the circumﬂex notation
(ˆName) is used to annotate an agent.
C. Linking
Another interesting aspect about the communication on
Twitter are URLs that are embedded in Tweets. URLs are
by default shortened by the platform’s own shortening service
http://t.co (16). The targeted URLs can be categorized as self-
links, social media links and other external links. For the study
presented, the former two contain interesting information. A
self-link points to the own website of an online retailer and
indicates the promotion of a product. Social media URLs direct
users to discussions on other social networks, e.g., Facebook.
This indicates a more community-centric activity than links to
product pages.
III.
STUDY DESIGN
In this section, the design of the empirical study will be
presented.
A. Data Collection
To acquire a sample of E-commerce related communi-
cations, two lists of the 115 best-selling online-retailers in
Germany (17) and the 100 best-selling shops in UK (18)
were used. The selection of retailers for further analysis was
performed in four consecutive steps:
1)
Find account: Twitter accounts were matched to the
shop sites by querying search engines. In case that
the query did not return a valid result, the search
process was continued by examining the shopping
site manually.
2)
Targeting speciﬁc country: With this step, it was
checked, if a given Twitter account is really targeting
the respective country (Germany of UK). For this
purpose, a manual examination of each proﬁle’s de-
scription and timeline was performed.
3)
Retrieval of account data: The proﬁle information
was collected, including the accounts’ lifetime, the
number of connections to other accounts (followers,
friends, listed) and the number of statuses issued
since creation.
4)
Activity check: In order to ﬁlter out inactive accouts,
the last status, issued by the regarding account was
retrieved. Then, the time elapsed between the publica-
tion of the last Tweet and the retrieval was calculated.
If the last status was issued more than 30 days ago, an
account was considered as not being active anymore.
After the selection and retrieval of proﬁle information,
the timeline consisting of the last 100 status messages were
collected for each account passing the preceding process.
Twitter’s REST API was queried to retrieve the data set. The
data collection was performed on 14th of February, 2014 for
the German subset and on 25th of February for UK.
B. Account data
First, the proﬁle information was analyzed. The lifetime of
an account in days is deﬁned as L. In order to calculate the
Tweet rate RT per lifetime as an indicator for broadcasting
activity, the total number of Tweets since the creation of the
account (T) was related to L (see (1)).

RT = T
L
(1)
In order to analyze the links to other users, the number
of followers fin, the number of friends fout, and the listed
count lin can be used. As stated in Section II, those values
are considered as in- and outdegree measures. To reﬂect the
lifetime of an account, those values were related to L and,
thus, they deﬁne the indregree rate Rin and Rout in (2) and
(3).
Rin = fin + lin

Rout = fout

C. Interaction strategies
First, different strategical categories were deﬁned for the
study. As described in Section II-B, there are different purposes
of Twitter communication. One purpose is the dialog with
users, which is called interactive strategies subsequently. Two
major forms of such strategies can be distinguished: S1 for
communicating inside Twitter and S2 for distributing links
pointing to social networks for dialogs outside Twitter. While
S1 and S2 were used, when the corresponding attribute dom-
inates, a third form S3 is introduced for cases, where both
attributes dominate only when combined. Thus, S3 describes
an interactive focus, combining both Twitter dialogs and
linking to other Web 2.0 sites. A promotional strategy S4 is
indicated by the use of URLs pointing to the shop, owned
by the issueing account. Sx is assigned, when none of those
attributes dominates in such a manner that one of the other
strategies could be assigned.
To determine the Twitter interaction strategies of the con-
ducted accounts, the following deﬁnitions are introduced:
•
A: All Twitter accounts whereas each element a
represents an online retailer from the sample.
•
PM: The fraction of Tweets that address other Twitter
users relative to.
•
PS: The fraction of Tweets that contain at least one
URL linking to another social network.
•
PP : The fraction of Tweets that contain at least one
URL pointing to the online store of the issuer.
A conceptual model was derived, which is based on the
Tweets that contain User Mentions (PM), URLs to social
networks (PS) and URLs to the online store of the account
owner (PP ). As shown in Figure 2, we identiﬁed four different
strategies, which will be explained below.
The ﬁrst strategy S1 is characterized by a frequent com-
munication with other Twitter users. Accounts that apply this
strategy make use of User Mentions in at least two-thirds of
their Tweets.
Strategy S2 is applied by accounts that intend to direct
Twitter users either to the weblog of the company or to a

website of another social network (e.g., Facebook) to continue
communication there. Accounts were assigned with this strat-
egy when at least two-thirds of their Tweets contain URLs to
other social networks or to a company weblog.
Strategy S3 is categorized by accounts that use strategy
S1 and S2 moderately, i.e., accounts that make moderate
use of User Mentions and moderate use of URLs to other
social networks or weblogs. ,,Moderate use“ means that User
Mentions and social network URLs are present in at least one
third, but no more than two-thirds of the Tweets.
The last strategy S4 is based on the URLs in Tweets that
refer to the website of the online retailer. An account is using
this strategy, when at least two-thirds of the Tweets contain
URLs to the retailers online store, i.e., URLs for promotional
purposes.
Finally, all accounts that did not ﬁt into the four above
strategies were classiﬁed as having no clear strategy (SX).
IV.
RESULTS
In this section the results of the study are presented. First,
an analysis of the proﬁle information is given, and, second,
accounts are assigned with interaction strategies.
A. Analysis of accounts
For each step of the selection and retrieval process de-
scribed in III-A, the resulting population size of retailers
passing the respective step is examined. The passing of this
process is summarized in Table I and divided into the two
samples Germany and UK. The value
xi
n is the percentage
of the number of accounts passing the step i relatively to
the sample’s n. The fraction
xi
xi−1 represents the number of
accounts passing the step i relatively to the previous step i−1.
It can be noted that both subsets differ from each other
strongly in steps 1 and 4. While the corresponding Twitter

account for 95% of the retailers could be identiﬁed for the
UK subset, only 77% of the account could be matched for the
German subset. While passing 96% of the incoming accounts
the activity check for the UK set, only 77% are considered as
being active in the German sample.
The variables lifetime, status per day, indegree and out-
degree derived from the proﬁle information are summarized
in Table II both for Germany and UK. For those values, the
.25, .50 and .75 quantiles and Geary’s skewness indicator were
calculated. For a easier comparison of the location parameters
of these values, boxplots visualizing the differences of both
samples are depiced in Figure 3. For the sake of readability,
the outliers on the right side were cut out, mainly affecting the
UK plots.
The German sample is characterized as follows: The mean
account lifetime is slightly above 4 years, while the values
are slightly left-skewed. Since its creation, an account issued
on average about seven Tweets per day, whereas the data is
strongly right-skewed. The majority of accounts issued less
than two Tweets per day. The mean increase of indegree is
about 1.6 users per day, while the data is right-skewed. For
75% of the retailers, this value is at about 1.5 or less. The
outdegree value for 75% of the accounts is at about 0.6 or
less.
The UK sample is characterized as follows: The mean
account lifetime is 41/2 years, and the values are slightly left-
skewed. Since creation, an account issued on average about
17 statuses per day, whereas the values are right-skewed. The
mean increase of indegree is at about 33 users per day, while
the values are right-skewed. The average increase of outdegree
is slightly above two user per day, which is almost identical
to the third quantile.
B. Twitter interaction strategies
In order to analyze interaction strategies, each URL was
resolved and classiﬁed by the hostname in one of the categories
self-link, social media and other for both data sets. The German
sample consisted of 5792 Tweets (99.86 per account) with
4661 URLs (79%). 4479 of those links could be resolved
(96%) and those pointed to 411 unique hosts. The UK sample
consisted of 6997 Tweets (99.96 per account) that contained
2726 URLs (39%), therefrom 2546 (93%) could be resolved.
Those URLs were pointing to 431 unique hosts. Both sets
differ notably in the overall URL usage in microblogging (UK:
39%, Germany: 80%) which indicates that in the German
sample, Twitter is dominantly used to direct users to other
content located on the web, whereas among the retailers in
the UK, Tweets are more self-contained.

Table III shows the comparison of strategies for Germany
and UK. Strategies as described in Section III-C were assigned
to each account. 80% of the retailers in UK use one of the
interactive strategies (S1, S2, S3), while only 48% of the
German retailers are assigned such a strategy. While in the
German subset, the values distribute somehow across those
three, in the UK sample, the whole category is concentrated
on S1. The promotional strategy S4 is much more prevalent
in the German subset, as well as SX.
V.
DISCUSSION
In Section IV-A, a comparison of the overall activity by
Twitter accounts managed by online retail companies is given.
The results of the retrieval process distinguish the two samples
from each other in two major aspects: The ratio of assigned
Twitter accounts is substantially higher in UK compared to
Germany, as well as the ratio of active accounts among all
accounts. The account lifetime value is used as an indicator
for the adoption behaviour among the retailers. The UK sample
of accounts is characterized by a slightly longer account
lifetime, which indicates an earlier adoption of this technology.
Another interesting measure for the adoption is the frequency
of usage. According to the number of status messages issued
per day, UK retailers are publishing Tweets more frequently.
Besides that, a comparison of common inﬂuence measures
was performed. The data showed that UK retailers are more
successful in generating user followers. Another interesting
observation is that the UK retailers are also a more likely to
follow other accounts.
For the identiﬁcation of different communication strategies,
the use of URLs and UMs in Section IV-B was compared. The
collected data shows that among the UK sample, interactive
strategies – particularly dialogs inside Twitter – are much
more prevalent in the German sample. In return, the ratio of
promotional strategies is much higher among German retailers.
This is also true for the share of retailers, that could not be
assigned a strategical category. Although the model deﬁned
in Section III allows the occurrence of multiple strategies per
account, there were no accounts that actually applied more
than one strategy. This shows that the deﬁned strategies are
disjunctive and clearly separated from each other.
But the choosen approach has also several limitations:
First, the use of UMs and URLs for the indication of the
communication purpose. As a previous work showed, the
special communication conventions supported by the Twitter
platform are not always used correctly (14). Thus, e.g., a
locational “@” can be mistaken as indicator for a directed
message by the classiﬁcation approach. Besides that, only the
target of an URL points to was examined and not the content

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper contains contributions to the subjects E-
commerce and the social web. The comparison of the usage
of communication strategies in the Web 2.0 on hand of the
example Twitter shows a different adoption between German
online retailers and the UK. For studying the usage of Twitter
in general this work provides a model for assigning of four ba-
sic communication strategies to an examined account. Besides
that, an interesting ﬁnding is that there are enormous differ-
ences in the communication between retailers and customers.
The ratio of dialogs on the Twitter platform is much higher
among the UK sample. This could reﬂect the earlier adoption
and higher acceptance of Twitter in the UK as other works
suggest.
Since there are some limitations, the reﬁnement and im-
provement of the approach used in this paper will be the next
steps. Besides the sole quantitative analysis of communication
patterns presented, it is planned to analyze a subset of the
data qualitatively to evaluate the precision of the classiﬁcation
process described in Section III-C. Another limitation of this
work lies within the composition of the sample’s population,
consisting of various different business domains. An examina-
tion based on a sample narrowed down to single branch will
be carried out.
