Abstract— Amide functionalized graphene oxide (AGO) was 
synthesized by chemical method at room temperature. Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and 
scanning electron microscopy measurements were carried out 
to verify the functionalization. Thin films of graphene oxide 
(GO) and AGO were formed by spin coating on SiO2/p-Si (100) 
substrate. The variation in the I-V characteristics was 
recorded at different humidity level. It has been observed that 
in GO the variation in resistance with humidity is relatively 
small as compared to AGO. The resistance of the AGO film 
was approximately 9.87 kΩ at 10% relative humidity (RH), 
and decreases to 1.5 kΩ at 90% RH.   
Keywords- Amide functionalized graphene oxide; relative 
humidity; I-V characteristics.

 INTRODUCTION 
Humidity plays an important role in every part of the 
earth 
processes. 
To 
have 
a 
desirable 
surrounding 
environment, it is necessary to monitor, detect and control 
the ambient humidity by precise sensors [1]. In today's 
modern world, there exist various kinds of humidity sensors 
that have applications in industrial processing and 
environmental control. Like for fabrication of integrated 
circuits in semiconductor industry it is essential to monitor 
moisture levels constantly. In medical field, humidity 
sensors are essential for respiratory equipment, sterilizers, 
incubators and biological processing. In agriculture, 
humidity sensors are used for green-house air-conditioning, 
plantation protection, soil moisture monitoring, etc. In 
general, humidity sensors are used for moisture detection by 
various paper, textile and food processing industries. In 
modern humidity sensor there is requirement of high 
sensitivity and wide detection range for fast response and 
short recovery time to meet industry applications. Thus 
nanomaterials, such as silicon nanostructures, ceramic 
nanomaterials, semiconductor nanoparticles and metal oxide 
are widely used for moisture sensing application due to high 
surface to volume ratio [2][3].  
Graphene oxide (GO) because of its large surface area 
and electrical properties can be potentially used for 
ultrasensitive sensor applications [1][3]. As GO has 
hydroxyl, epoxy and carboxylic acid functional group 
bonded in two-dimensional network of sp2 and sp3 
hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure 
[2]. The oxygen containing functional groups of GO 
enhance hydrophilic properties of it but these groups makes 
it an insulator by decreasing its conductivity [1][4]. But 
oxygen functional groups of GO allow fast passage of water 
within the GO layers [5], which makes fast response of the 
sensor based on GO. But improving the electrical properties 
of GO by surface modification via noncovalent or covalent 
functionalization is a promising way for fabrication of high 
performance 
GO-based 
sensor 
[6][7]. 
Already 
functionalized GO have been successfully used for detection 
of acetone, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), etc 
[8][9]. Covalent functionalization of GO enhance its 
physicochemical properties, for instance, isocyanate-treated 
GO has been exfoliated and form a stable dispersion in polar 
aprotic solvents [10]. Such functionalization improves the 
mechanical, electrical, thermal properties [7] and dispersion 
of functionalization GO in to organic solvents [11].  
In view of above observations, heteroaryl/phenyl amine 
was grafted onto GO sheets by the amide formation between 
amine functionality of heteroaryl/phenyl amine and oxygen-
containing groups (e.g., carboxyl and lactone groups) of GO 
to give amide functionalized GO (AGO). Section 2, explains 
the synthesis and amide functionalization of GO. In Section 
3, there is discussion about the various characterization of 
prepared 
GO 
and 
AGO. 
The 
effect 
of 
surface 
functionalization on humidity sensing application of GO 
was also discussed in Section 3. The conclusion of the work 
is given in Section 4.

EXPERIMENTAL 
A. Materials 
Graphite powder (purity 99.99%), sodium nitrate 
(99.0%), sulphuric acid, potassium permanganate (99%), 
hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide 
(NaOH), hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), 2-aminothiazole, 
N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) were used to prepare 
GO and AGO.  
B. Preparation of GO 
Graphite (2 g) and NaNO3 (1 g) were mixed in cooled 
concentrated sulphuric acid (46 ml) under stirring in ice 
bath. KMnO4 (6 g) was gradually added to the above placed 
mixture with stirring and cooling so that the temperature of 
mixture was maintained between 10–15°C [12]. The 
reaction mixture was then stirred at 40°C for 30 minutes. 
Subsequently, 80 ml of high purity water was added to the 
142

formed paste, followed by another 90 minutes stirring at 
90°C. Successively, to stop the oxidation reaction additional 
200 ml water was added. 6 ml of 30% H2O2 was added in 
above mixture sequentially to destroy the excess KMnO4. 
The complete removal of KMnO4 was indicated by color 
changed to yellow. Sometimes the solution’s color was 
yellow before addition of H2O2 which indicated complete 
reduction of KMnO4. The solution was then washed with 
HCl (10%) to remove sulphate. Subsequently, it was filtered 
and washed several times with DI water. The filtered paste 
was dissolved in 100 ml DI water. The solution was 
ultrasonicated for 1 hour and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 
4000rpm. GO powder thus obtained was collected and dried 
at room temperature. 
C. Preparation of AGO 
The AGO was obtained by condensation of amine group 
of heteroaryl/phenyl amine with lactone group of GO. AGO 
was synthesized by dispersing GO (0.3 g) in 30 ml DMF by 
ultrasonication for 60 minutes at room temperature. Then, 
NaOH (0.3 g; 7.5 mmol) was added and resulting solution 
was stirred for 60 minutes at room temperature. 
Subsequently, 2-aminothiazole (3.1 mmol), HOBt (3.1 
mmol) followed by DCC (3.1 mmol) addition to the above 
reaction mixture and stirred for 24 hours at room 
temperature. AGO powder collected by centrifugation was 
added to pure DMF and the resulting suspension was again 
centrifuged to remove side products. This process was 
repeated twice with DMF and then with water to remove 
DMF to give pure AGO. The prepared AGO was dried at 
60°C overnight. 
D. Characterization 
The crystal phase was characterized by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) XPERT-PRO diffractometer (45 kV, 40 mA) 
equipped with a Giono-meter PW3050/60 working with Cu 
Kα radiation of wavelength 1.5406Å in the 2θ range from 5 
to 80°). The functional surface group was studied by Perkin 
Elmer Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) model SPETRUM 
65 system. Dried solid samples were mixed with KBr 
powder and were pelletized before performing the scan from 
wave number 4000 to 400 cm-1. SEM characterization was 
carried out by using JSM-6510LV Series Scanning Electron 
Microscope (SEM) having pre centered W hairpin filament 
(with continuous auto bias) and equipped with accelerating 
voltage of 500 V to 30 kV with high magnification of 
300,000.  
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The oxygenated GO sheet prepared by the chemical 
method was treated with NaOH to open the lactone groups 
(–CO-O–) on the basal plane and convert them into 
hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Treatment of resulting 
reaction mixture with organic amines in the presence of 
DCC and HOBt leads to the amidation of the carboxyl 
groups to give AGO. The chemical changes occurring in the 
GO after treatment with amine can be verified easily by 
FTIR, XRD, and SEM techniques.  
Structural changes of AGO were investigated by 
comparing the FTIR spectra of GO and AGO (Figure 1). 
The most characteristic features in the FTIR spectrum of 
GO was the adsorption bands corresponding to the C=O 
carbonyl stretching at 1721 cm-1, the stretching bands for 
C=C bonds at 1591 cm-1, the O–H deformation vibration at 
1392 cm-1 and the C–O stretching at 1051 cm-1[13][14]. The 
FTIR spectra of AGO reveals a new peak at about 1634 cm-1 
corresponding to the amide carbonyl (C=O) stretch (amide 
I) and the peak at about 1585 cm-1 for amide II (C–N in-
plane stretching and CHN deformation) [15], which 
demonstrate that amines has been grafted onto GO as amide 
bond.

XRD patterns for graphite, GO and AGO are shown in 
Figure 2. GO shows a diffraction peak at 2θ = 11.42˚, which 
is the characteristic peak of the GO, with increase in 
interspacing from 0.34 nm (graphite) to 0.77 nm.

Due to the functionalization of GO the peaks shift to the 
lower value of angle (2θ) and increase in the interlayer 
spacing from 0.77 nm (GO) to 0.84 nm for AGO, was 
observed. The larger value of interlayer spacing suggests the 
incorporation of additional functionality on the surface of 
the basal plane of GO. AGO shows peaks at 17.08˚, 20.1˚ 
and 21.69˚ correspond to 2-aminothiazole group.  
The SEM images represent the surface morphology of 
the GO and AGO (Figure 3).  These images show that the 
resulting sample of AGO was obviously different from GO. 
Morphology of GO was observed to have flaky texture 
indicating its layered microstructure. Different surface 
morphology of AGO clearly indicates the surface 
modification of GO after functionalization. 
 
Figure 3. SEM image of GO and AGO 
The DC electrical properties, i.e., current–voltage (I-V) 
characteristics of the GO and AGO films were measured 
with a voltage sweeping mode at various humidity points. 
To measure the I-V characteristics one electrode was loaded 
with the sweeping voltage bias, and the other electrode is 
grounded. I-V characteristics of GO and AGO films was 
investigated for 2 to 5 V sweeping voltages at various 
humidity levels, respectively. The different percentage of 
humidity level was achieved in sensing chamber by 
introducing the water vapors. 
Figure 4a shows the measured I-V characteristics of GO 
film in the relative humidity (RH) range of 10% to 90%. 
From Figure 4a it is clear that the channel current of the GO 
film increases with increasing RH, indicating that the water 
adsorption results in a decrease in the resistance of GO films 
[16]. Water adsorption easily takes place in GO because of 
presence of large number of oxygen containing functional 
groups in it. The result revealed that GO is a weak 
conductor with a continuous water adsorption onto GO 
films. It is also clear that the current increases with increase 
in humidity level. At higher humidity (>60%) GO films 
gives good response.  
The sensor resistance (Rs), as a function of humidity is 
calculated by : 
Rs=δV/δI 
where, δV is incremental voltage and δI is incremental 
current.  
The variation of Rs with humidity is shown in Figure 5. 
The Rs of the GO film was 0.76 MΩ at 10% RH, which 
decreases to 0.48 MΩ at 90% RH  It can be observed from 
Figure 4b that for AGO, the variation in current is more as 
compared to GO. So, AGO is preferred for moisture sensing 
as compared to GO. The resistance of the AGO film was 
9.87 kΩ at 10% RH, which decreases to 3.52 kΩ at 30% 
RH. The resistance decrease further with increase in 
humidity and it become 1.5 kΩ at 90% RH. The resistance 
of film at 90% RH was approximately seven times smaller 
than that at 10% RH.

from 2V to 5V sweeping voltage 
 
Figure 5. Variation in sensor resistance with humidity 
The decrease in the resistance of GO and AGO film can 
be explained on the basis interaction of water molecules 
with the film material. At high sweeping voltage, water 
molecules on the films are ionized and leads to formation of 
hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions due to the strong electric

field. The generated hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions 
deceases the oxygen containing functional groups of GO 
and AGO and hence the current increases with humidity. 
However, in AGO there are less number of oxygen 
containing groups as compared to GO, so AGO gives better 
sensitivity. When ambient RH is high, the numbers of 
adsorbed water molecules are large. As a result, the 
ionization process generates more hydrogen ions, result in 
reduction of GO and AGO film. Thereby, AGO exhibits 
high conductivity at higher applied voltage and at high 
humidity level. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
An efficient and easy approach has been used to 
synthesize the covalent functionalized GO by a simple 
amidation reaction using 2-aminothiazole. DC measurement 
method was used to investigate the effect of humidity on the 
electrical properties of AGO films. Through electrical 
characterizations, the strong interaction of water molecules 
with AGO films was observed. The electrical properties of 
GO and AGO films were affected by humidity and the 
amplitude of applied voltage. At low RH (<60%), GO films 
exhibited small variation in current due to the presence of 
sp3-bonded hybridized carbon atoms and presence of 
oxygen containing functional groups. AGO shows much 
better response at lower and higher RH (10% to 90%) 
indicates its effectiveness as compared to GO. The results 
are useful for the development of graphene-based sensors.
