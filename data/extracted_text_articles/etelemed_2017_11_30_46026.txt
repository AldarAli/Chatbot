Abstract— The work studies the acceleration of a single tri-
axial accelerometer fixed at the sacrum position on the back of 
subject next to the COM (Center of Mass). The correlation 
between the cycle of the COM and the cycle of the walking is 
analyzed by using a harmonic oscillator as a model for human 
locomotion. The COM position is calculated without any 
integration of its acceleration. A double integration of raw 
accelerometer data can result in an accumulation of drift error 
resulting in wrong position and distance or step length 
evaluation. The acceleration of a harmonic oscillator is directly 
proportional to the position. We evaluate the COM position 
and translation into a sinusoidal pattern. For every step cycle, 
the maximum of COM amplitude is used to give the relative S 
step length. This kinematic model generates the properly 
attended values; all steps are detected and the absolute 
accuracy error in the measurement of the step length, ranges 
from 0.32% to 3.33% with a mean value 2.17%. In the model, 
many output parameters are processed to study the subject 
movement analysis, but all that parameters should be 
compared with the gold standard values using appropriate 
protocols. We use data of Swedish adult people to obtain 
coefficients C to evaluate Smean (mean anthropometric step 
length). Smean is used only as a reference, but is not the S value 
measured by the model. New protocols and data verification 
are carried out. The expectation is to develop a dedicated tool 
to support diagnosis and rehabilitation.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Gait analysis is a complex and expensive technology. 
The setup of a limited working area in laboratory, the use of 
markers on the subject and the data analysis are not simple 
to approach. Outside the laboratory, the use of the system is 
not artless. Healthcare requires a novel ecologic approach to 
the movement analysis in order to make it friendly and 
designed under ergonomic constraints as well as the 
performance assessment in agonistic sports and/or clinical 
follow up in home monitoring. The wearable sensors are a 
possible solution to this problem. They are easy to use and 
not intrusive, so that it is possible to monitor subjects 
everywhere [1][2]. The introduction of smart fabrics and 
wearable sensors improves and simplifies the development 
of these sensors, the evaluation of the movements and also 
the rehabilitation of patients in their clinical pathway. In 
fact, the possibility to embed sensors directly into the user’s 
garments becomes real [3][4]. In this way, their use allows 
for a natural walk while monitoring is in progress. Clinical 
tests are often conducted with manual counting of times, 
steps and distances; their confirmation is carried out through 
the support of concurrent video analysis. The use of 
wearable devices for the gait analysis without optoelectronic 
analysis is possible. This matter is still under investigation. 
The need to monitor health status of patients drives an 
improvement and an evolution to use remote control 
systems for analyzing data through a trained medical center. 
Transmission and storage of clinical data is driven by 
attention to the security and privacy [1][5]. On the research 
side, more accurate biomechanical models are being 
implemented, the improvement of signal processing and 
advanced analysis algorithms are a focus of development so 
to enhance the interpretation of the output data of wearable 
sensors for decision making [2][6][7]. Every new wearable 
analysis tool for gait analysis is a strong target; better results 
need to be introduced into the clinical practice in order to 
exploit for example a wearable 6MWT (Six Minutes 
Walking Test), or a wearable TUG (Timed Up and Go), or 
other trials, without the particular limitations of a 
laboratory. Our work goes into this direction: we developed 
a novel kinematic model and related method to process 3D 
inertial accelerometer data and to compute parameters of 
gait analysis. The structure of the paper is as follows: 
section 2.1 the Biomechanical model; section 2.2 the 
experimental setup; sections 2.3 and 2.4 the Methods A and 
B to analyze raw data; sections 3.1 and 3.2 the Data 
Analysis with Method A and B; section 4 the conclusions. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This section reports the description of the methodology 
used for the kinematic model. We divided the section in four 
subsections in which we explain the Biomechanical model, 
the experimental setup, the processing methods for bot the 
parts. 
 
2.1 Biomechanical Model 
Describing the movement of a subject, we have to 
consider the external forces and, therefore, the accelerations 
acting on his/her body. In absence of other forces, we 
always have the action of the gravity force, and then the 
subject has to produce a counterbalanced force to remain in

equilibrium even when stationary. The COM (Center of 
Mass) is a single point where we can think that the whole 
mass of the body is concentrated, so that it is equivalent to 
the entire considered object, where the external forces act 
according to the Newton’s laws of motion. In a standing 
posture, its position is typically about 10 cm lower than the 
navel, in the sagittal plane and in correspondence of the 
anterior superior iliac crests (the top of the hip bones). To 
know as the COM moves, it means to know how the object 
moves. For this reason, we studied human walking by 
evaluating the acceleration signals of a single tri-axial 
accelerometer fixed on the pelvis of subjects next to the 
COM, i.e. in correspondence of the second sacral vertebra.  
In the FIGURE 1 a subject walk and the positions in time of 
the COM are presented with circles and a trajectory. L is the 
leg length, θ is the hip angle in the sagittal plane and S is the 
step length. While the subject moves a step S, the COM 
moves vertically along an oscillating path; the maximum 
oscillation amplitude is hCOM. When the subject moves the 
next steps, the cycle repeats. While walking, the COM 
oscillation pattern is considered sinusoidal in the vertical 
and mediolateral directions [8]. In this work we describe the 
COM vertical oscillation, but the same method is applicable 
to the COM mediolateral oscillation. To describe human 
locomotion, it is analyzed the correlation between the cycle 
of COM and the cycle of walking, by using a harmonic 
oscillator model. The legs are considered rigid bodies. The 
swinging movement is described by a pendulum model [9].

According to this model, we can define: 
• 
S = the length of the step; 
• 
L = the length of a lower limb; 
• 
hCOM = the maximum amplitude of the vertical 
variation of COM trajectory (distance between the 
maximum and the minimum height of the COM); 
• 
θ = the hip angle in the sagittal plane;

. 
 
The COM position must be calculated. A direct double 
integration of raw accelerometer data gives the position 
which can result in an accumulation of drift error giving 
wrong position and wrong distance or wrong step length. 
Other studies chose to double integrate and report solution 
to solve the drift error [6]. We do not carry out a double 
integration. Some information may be obtained using the 
property that the acceleration of a harmonic oscillator is 
directly proportional to the position. For every step cycle, 
the maximum of COM amplitude is used to give the relative 
S step length and distance. 
 
2.2 Experimental setup 
We used a wearable 3D accelerometer (Protheo SXT 
s.r.l., Lecco, Italy) [10]. Protheo technical details are: 85 (l) 
x 53 (w) x 16 (h) mm of size, 70 g of weight, 4 digits LCD, 
on board ARM7 microprocessor and raw acceleration 
sampling frequency of 128 Hz. This device is able to log tri-
axial accelerometer signals into the internal memory (up to 
three days of continuous monitoring) which can be 
downloaded at the end of the acquisition by Bluetooth® 
data transmission. The data storage allows for recording 
different tests in sequence. When we carry out different tests 
in sequence, we have no way to monitor over the data 
recording until the recording is downloaded. We calibrated 
the output raw signals when the data processing is carry out. 
Protheo could record also an electrocardiogram of the 
subject while he is making the test, but this option is not 
used for this study. The system is worn at sacrum position 
on the back of the subject, by means of an elastic band with 
a pocket for fixing the device firmly to the body. We 
recorded six independent walking tests of a single subject. 
In the test protocol the subject walked with shoes at self-
selected speed over a linear path of 31.2 m; the walking 
time is not a constant. To control the test, the step length 
was kept fixed at 60 cm, so that 52 steps were necessary to 
complete the path. These values are the true imposed values 
used for accuracy assessment. For this purpose, a linear set 
of 60 cm interspaced lines was drawn to drive the position 
of the tip of the foot at each step. This step value is very 
close to the subject natural one that has the anthropometric 
estimated value of Smean = 61.9 cm (mean anthropometric 
step length). We evaluate Smean using data of Swedish adult 
people but different values are possible compared with 
different cultural background [11][12]. From this data we 
obtain the C coefficients depending on gender, speed and H 
(height) of the subject as in TABLE I.

Smean = C

Smean is a reference and S the measured step length. C 
permits the evaluation of the mean anthropometric step 
length depending on gender, heigth and speed. Gender, age, 
weight and following anthropometric measurements of the 
subject under analysis were taken to complete the 
biomechanical model: a) lower limb (ground-greater 
trochanter); b) ground-malleolus; c) lateral condyle-greater 
trochanter; d) malleolus-lateral condyle; e) fifth metatarsal-
malleolus; f) width of the foot; g) length of the foot to the 
ground; h) outer distance between the feet. The subject is a 
healthy male (w = 80 kg, h = 181 cm, age = 51 years) with 
normal BMI (Body Mass Index) 24.4. TABLE II reports his 
anthropometric measures. In the model, we use the Tanaka

formula [13] to compute the HRmax (maximum Heart Rate) 
in bpm unit and the HRR (Heart Rate Reserve); we need the 
heartbeat as an input value at the beginning of the test with 
the resting subject and at the end of the test to compute the 
cardiac effort during exercise. The energy expenditure is 
evaluated in [METS]. Raw accelerometer data processing 
was implemented in Matlab© software suite. Two different 
processing methods were compared (Method A and B).

2.3. The Processing Method A 
The peaks in raw data were detected by peakdet.m 
function [14], using a 5th order pass-band Butterworth filter 
(band: 0.5 - 4 Hz). To identify S, we used the peak positions 
detected by the previous peakdet routine, applying the 
harmonic oscillator model to the original raw signals filtered 
with a low-pass 19th order Butterworth filter, with these 
cut-off frequencies for each acceleration: 
• 
Antero Posterior acceleration: 6 Hz; 
• 
Vertical acceleration: 7 Hz; 
• 
Medio Lateral acceleration: 8 Hz. 
The evaluation of hCOM was carried out by applying a cut-
off threshold of 6 cm to the double of maxima amplitude of 
COM sinusoidal pattern. The amplitude to be considered in 
the model is the length between the maximum and the 
minimum for every COM oscillation. The time between two 
consecutive vertical peaks is the single step time. In order to 
identify the starting step (left or right), the analysis of 
mediolateral acceleration was made. The same analysis can 
be applied in order to extract the asymmetry of right and left 
steps [15]. The kinematic model can extract the following 
parameters: 
• 
BMI [kg/m^2]; 
• 
cadence [step/min] and frequency [step/s]; 
• 
stepping time [s]; 
• 
stride's periods [s]; 
• 
right and left step's periods [s]; 
• 
displacement of COM [m]; 
• 
speed [m/s]; 
• 
speed for the right and left steps [m/s]; 
• 
right and left step lengths [m]; 
• 
length of steps [m]; 
• 
incremental distance traveled at each step [m]; 
• 
pace distances [m]; 
• 
pace angles [degrees]; 
• 
pace coefficients of walking efficiency; 
• 
number of steps and strides; 
• 
sagittal hip angle [degrees]; 
• 
the first right or left leg support; 
• 
base of support both with aids that without [m^2]; 
• 
width of steps [m]; 
• 
acceleration peaks at ground support phase [g]; 
• 
step and stride indices of regularity and symmetry; 
• 
total and incremental energy expenditure [METS]; 
• 
the power spectrum of the accelerometer signal; 
• 
maximum heart rate and heart rate reserve; 
• 
6MWT predicted normal distance value [m]; 
• 
report with office format. 
 
2.4. The Processing Method B 
Method A is consistent if subject walks with a constant 
step, but this is not a normal constrain; if there is a velocity 
variation for external causes or other voluntary choices, a 
new set of processing filters has to be applied to the 
acquired data for the research of peak acceleration and the 
relative values. To verify this hypothesis, we carried out a 
set of experiments by asking the subject to walk on a 
treadmill and progressively increasing its speed (from 0.5 to 
1.7 m/s). The same concept could be applied to pathological 
patients, walking slower and asymmetrically, such as stroke 
patients (walking speed < 0.5 m/s).  
This issue was faced in the second approach here proposed 
(Method B), as an evolution of Method A.  
The peaks of raw signals that identify steps, were detected 
by peakdet.m function; the low-pass filter used is different 
according to the walking speed: 
• 
at high velocity, a 5th order low-pass Butterworth 
filter is applied with the following cut-off 
frequencies: 
o 
Antero Posterior acceleration: 1.8 Hz; 
o 
Vertical acceleration: 1.8 Hz; 
o 
Medio Lateral acceleration: 0.9 Hz; 
• 
at low velocity, a 4th order low-pass Butterworth 
filter: 
o 
Antero Posterior acceleration: 35 Hz; 
o 
Vertical acceleration: 5 Hz; 
o 
Medio Lateral acceleration: 3 Hz. 
To identify S, we used the previous peak identification, 
applying the harmonic oscillator model to the original raw 
signals filtered by a 19th order Butterworth filter with the 
following cut-off frequencies: 
o 
Antero Posterior acceleration: 6 Hz; 
o 
Vertical acceleration: 35 Hz; 
o 
Medio Lateral acceleration: 8 Hz. 
We used six different approaches to define hCOM 
threshold:

Mode 0: if we do not know S, the length of the expected 
step, hCOM threshold is estimated by the median 
of twice the absolute value of the COM amplitude 
trend; this value is multiplied by weights that 
depend on the average walking speed; 
Mode 1: if we know the expected step S, we impose the 
hCOM threshold equal to the expected hCOM

Mode 2: as in mode 1, but the expected hCOM threshold is 
increased of the 20%; 
Mode 3: the hCOM threshold is the product of hCOM value 
evaluated by linear interpolation and a set of 
weight correction factors depending on speeds, so 
to matching the value of COM displacement 
measured by Orendurff [8], with the expected 
COM displacement of the model; 
Mode 4: the hCOM threshold is the Lulic’s COM amplitude 
[16] with the weights of Mode 3; 
Mode 5: the hCOM threshold is 0.6 m. 
Through the proper choice of the mode according to 
subject’s feature in his/her different scenarios, the model 
calculates the correct length values and the number of 
strides and steps.  
III. RESULTS 
The step counting obtained from the device was 
compared with the true reference value i.e. that one taken 
manually by the observing operator. 
 
3.1 The Data Analysis with Method A 
The Method A (TABLE III) detected all 52 steps in the test 
(1, 2, 3, 5). In the tests (4, 6), 51 steps are detected. The 
absolute accuracy error in the measurement of the step 
length, ranges from 0.37% to 10.78% with a mean value 
4.94%; the absolute accuracy error in the measurement of 
the walking total path, ranges from 0.37% to 10.78% with a 
mean value 5.22%. The subject covers the path from a 
standing start; the first steps are not regular because the 
subject is still not in a steady state. If we replace the initial 
steps with the next ones, we have a steady state for all the 
path. If the high frequencies contribute in the oscillator 
modeling, the removal of the low-pass filter during the step 
evaluation, should give a better result. The analysis with the 
Modified Method A is presented in TABLE IV. The 
absolute accuracy error in the measurement of the step 
length, ranges from 0.32% to 3.33% with a mean value 
2.17%. The error is less that in the original Method A. The 
anthropometric distance is evaluated with C coefficient of 
TABLE I. With the Method A (TABLE V), the absolute 
accuracy error in the walking speed ranges from 0.37% to 
10.77% with a mean value 5.55%. The stride and step 
frequencies measured are presented in the same table. With 
the modified method, A (TABLE VI), the absolute accuracy 
error in the walking speed ranges from 0.52% to 3.31% with 
a mean value 1.70%.

The stride and step frequencies measured are presented in 
the same table. The error is less that in the original Method 
A. In the Method A (TABLE VII), the absolute error in the 
COM amplitude versus expected ranges from 1.04% to 
18.92% with a mean value 11.05%. In the Modified Method 
A (TABLE VIII), the absolute error in the COM amplitude 
versus expected ranges from 0.18% to 5.92% with a mean 
value 3.88%. The Modified Method A is good: all steps are 
detected, except in some tests where one is missed, and the 
accuracy error is acceptable. We have the need for a 
development of this method for a better detection of all 
steps and for a more flexible tool to analyze data: the 
Method B.

3.2 The Data Analysis with Method B 
The Method B (TABLE XI) detected all 52 steps in every 
test. We do not yet used the correction for steady state but if 
we did, the results will be better. By using Mode 5, the 
absolute accuracy error in the measurement of the walking 
total path, as well as the step length (error is the same), 
ranges from 0.27% to 6.31% with a mean value 3.00%. 
With this modality, the relative values are both positives and 
negatives.

By using Mode 1 (TABLE X), the absolute accuracy error 
in the measurement of the walking total path, as well as the 
step length (error is the same), ranges from 1.58% to 6.80% 
with a mean value 3.72%. The Mode 1 underestimates the 
step length in every test. We can think of using a special 
correction factor to correct this underestimation to have 
more accuracy. This allows the definition of the proper 
filtering to be adopted by the two processing methods.

In the two conditions 1) and 2) the BMI of the subject was 
very different. In the trial repetitions of the first protocol 
(six tests of a single healthy subject) and their data 
processing, is demonstrated that the model produced the 
expected values with very good accuracy. The use of 
coefficients C for evaluating Smean (mean anthropometric 
step length) carry out a good reference, but is not the 
measured value S by the model. In the Method A, non-all 
the steps are detected (one step is lost in two tests), but if the 
filter is changed as in the Method B, the 100% of the 52 
steps are detected. In the Modified Method A, the absolute 
accuracy error in the measurement of the step length, ranges 
from a minimum 0.32% to a maximum 3.33% with a mean 
value 2.17%; in the Method B, it ranges from a minimum 
0.27% to a maximum 6.31% with a mean value 3.00%. 
These values do not yet use the correction for the steady 
state (used by Modified Method A), but if we did, the 
results should be better, so the equivalent values of the 
Method A to be compared are the minimum 0.37%, the 
maximum 10.77% and the mean value 5.55%. The Method 
B is better and more flexible. The parameters extracted by 
the model are very complete, but should be compared with 
the gold standard values using appropriate protocols. 
Preliminary reliability of both methods is more than good. 
This first validation is now followed by a protocol 
application on a wider population of healthy subjects and 
post stroke patients, to validate also its clinical application. 
The tests with an electronically controlled treadmill are 
carried out on healthy subjects following the dedicated 
protocol. We are also investigating the clinical applicability 
of the approach on a group of stroke patients undergoing 
rehabilitation programs. The tests performed are the 10m 
test at low and high walking speed, the 6MWT and the 
TUG. A control group of healthy subjects is considered. The 
expectation is to develop a dedicated tool for supporting 
diagnosis and rehabilitation. This will also allow for 
investigation of model sensitivity in detecting the gait 
parameters improvements.
