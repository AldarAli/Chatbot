Abstract—Recent research has shown that digital online geo-
location traces are new and valuable sources to predict social
interactions between users, e.g. , check-ins via FourSquare or
geo-location information in Flickr images. Interestingly, if we
look at related work in this area, research studying the extent
to which social interactions can be predicted between users
by taking more than one location-based knowledge source into
account does not exist. To contribute to this ﬁeld of research, we
have collected social interaction data of users in an online social
network called My Second Life and three related location-based
knowledge sources of these users (monitored locations, shared
locations and favored locations), to show the extent to which social
interactions between users can be predicted. Using supervised
and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we ﬁnd that on
the one hand the same location-based features (e.g. the common
regions and common observations) perform well across the three
different sources. On the other hand, we ﬁnd that the shared
location information is better suited to predict social interactions
between users than monitored or favored location information of
the user.

INTRODUCTION
There is no doubt that tomorrow’s world will be mobile
and social. It is therefore not surprising that recent research has
rigorously followed this trend to study new methods to predict
social ties or links between people in such an environment.
Interestingly, if we look at related work in this area (e.g.
[1], [2], [3]), research studying the extent to which social
links can be predicted between users typically takes just one
knowledge source into account, e.g. , online social network
data from Facebook, or location-based social network data
from FourSquare. To contribute to this emergent and still
sparse ﬁeld of research, we have recently started a project
(see [4], [5], [6]) with the overall goal to predict links and
tie strength between users from various sources of social and
mobile data. Since it is nearly impossible to obtain a complete
dataset containing both kinds of knowledge sources in the real
world, we focused our experiments on a virtual environment
called My Second Life. This allowed us to easily mine any
kind of information needed for such a type of a project on
a large scale. So far, we have studied the extent to which
partnership [6] and in general interactions can be predicted
[5] by looking at homophilic features such as for instance
common interests, common groups, or common-places vis-
ited and network topological features where we investigated
common friends features such as Adamic Adar or Jaccard’s
coefﬁcient. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that the location information
of users is to a great extent useful to predict tie strength for the
interactions between them in the virtual world of Second Life,
most of the time outperforming online social network features.
While we only used one particular type of location-based
knowledge source about users, namely monitored locations, in
our previous research, in this paper we are interested to overall
study three different types of knowledge sources: monitored
locations, shared locations and favored locations. We employed
10 different features to predict social interactions between
users and unveil what type of location-based knowledge source
and what types of features were most valuable. Overall, we
would like to answer the following research questions in this
paper:
RQ1. Are there any statistically signiﬁcant differences
between the users having and not having social interaction
with each other based on the features induced from our three
different kinds of location-based knowledge sources?
RQ2. Which features perform best across those three types
of location-based knowledge sources?
RQ3. What kind of knowledge sources is in the end the
most valuable to predict social interactions between users?
To answer the ﬁrst question we analyzed the datasets with
statistical methods according to our features. This evaluation
showed that there were signiﬁcant differences between user-
pairs with a social interaction and users without a social
interaction across all computed features and all three sources
of location information. For instance, user-pairs with a social
interaction share more common regions compared to user-
pairs without social interaction. To answer the second research
question, we employed Collaborative Filtering for each feature
independently to predict the social interactions between the
users to ﬁnd the most valuable features. Among others we
found that common regions and common observations of two
users were a good indicator for a social interaction between
them. For the last question we combined the best features
for each region source and showed that the user’s Shared
Locations were more valuable to predict social interactions
than Monitored or Favored locations.
In detail the paper is structured as follows: In Section II,
we shortly discuss related work in the area. In Section III,
we introduce the collected datasets and the features to predict
social interactions between users in Section IV. The setup
of the experiments is depicted in Section V followed by
the results in Section VI. Finally, Section VII, discusses the
ﬁndings and concludes the paper.

where greatly enhanced with the advent of user’s location
data. One of the ﬁrst studies in this ﬁeld was conducted
by Cranshaw et al. [2] who combined the interaction of the
online social network Facebook with the location-based social
network of Loccaccino. They introduced various metrics to
compute users homophily and found a signiﬁcant correlation
between social interactions and location-based features. Simi-
lar observations were made by Thelwall et al. [9] who revealed
signiﬁcant homophily between interacting users in MySpace
and even inferred an real-life friendship from the online social
network. This goes inline with Bischoff et al. [3] who found
relations between connections in Last.FM and visited music
concerts based on demographic, structural and taste-related
attributes. Scellato et al. [1] investigated in the location-
based social network of Gowalla and found 30% of newly
created links as “place friends”. Research by Wang et al. [10]
follows this direction. They investigated in the prediction of
social relations using mobility data obtained from mobile
phones and found mobile information signiﬁcantly outperform-
ing simple network measures. Another paper by Scellato et
al. [11] focuses on the structural differences between the three
location-based social networks of Brighknight, Foursquare,
and Gowalla. In contrast to our work, they did not have
different location sources for one single online social network
and their focus was on the actual spatial distance between user.

DATA SETS
Our experiments were based on a social interaction dataset
of users in an online social network and three indepen-
dent location-based knowledge sources: Monitored Locations,
Shared Locations, and Favored Locations from a virtual world.
In particular, we focused in our experiments on a virtual
environment called Second Life, where we could easily mine
the necessary information needed for the experiments on a
large scale (see [4], [5], [6] for more details).
A. Social Interaction Dataset
The online social network My Second Life was introduced
by Linden Labs, the company behind Second Life, in July
2011. It is a social network that can be compared to Facebook
regarding postings and check-ins but aims only at residents of
the virtual world: just as in Facebook, residents can interact
with each other sharing text messages, and comment or love
(similar to a “like” in Facebook) these messages. Figure 1
depicts a typical proﬁle of a user with postings, comments,
and loves from others. A user’s proﬁle can be accessed
with a unique URI derived from the user name and we
attempted to download the proﬁle data of over 400,000 users
with a web-crawler. We extracted their interaction partners
and downloaded the missing proﬁles iteratively. With this
approach, we found 152,509 proﬁles with interactions on their
proﬁle and identiﬁed 1,084,002 postings, 459,734 comments
and 1,631,568 loves.
B. Location-based Dataset
To predict the social interactions between users we em-
ployed location information obtained from three different
sources of data.
Fig. 1. User proﬁle of an Second Life resident in the online social network My
Second Life showing a posting, a shared snapshot with location information
(Silver Sea), and a comment.
a) Monitored Locations: As in the real life, residents
of Second Life can host events in the virtual world for other
residents and publicly announce this information on an event
calendar. We implemented a web-crawler that harvested this
calendar periodically to extract all events with accurate event-
location and start time. Based on this information we have
implemented 15 avatar-bots that visited these events with an
interval of 15 minutes and collected the accurate location
of the participating users. Starting in March 2012 we were
able to collect 262,234 events over a period of 12 months
yielding in a dataset of nearly 19 million data samples, i.e.
user-location tuples, of over 410,616 different users in 4,132
unique locations.
b) Shared Locations: Users of My Second Life can not
only interact with each other using postings, comments, or
loves, they can also share location information about their cur-
rent in-world location through in-world pictures. The idea of
sharing these locations can be compared to pictures uploaded
to Flickr or Facebook enriched with GPS information (see
Figure 1). Overall, we identiﬁed 496,912 snapshots in 13,583
unique locations on 45,835 proﬁles.
c) Favored Locations: Every user of Second Life can
specify up to 10 so-called “Picks” on it’s proﬁle representing
the favorite locations of users. Users can enhance these picks
with a picture and personal text note. These favored locations
are visible to other users and hence it can be easily accessed
with a Web browser using a URI derived from the user’s
name. We found 191,610 proﬁles, sharing 811,386 locations
in 25,311 unique regions.
Figure 2 depicts the number of observations of the col-
lected users for the three location sources. Both, Shared and
Monitored Locations show power law qualities which is in
contrast to the Favored Locations due to Linden’s limitations
of 10 picks per user.
IV.
FEATURES
Based on the collected location-based user data we induced
overall 10 different features in order to measure the homophily
between the users and to predict social interactions between
them [2], [5], [6]. For the reminder of this paper the sequence
of observations O(u) of a user u are denoted as 1) Om(u) for
Monitored Locations, 2) Os(u) for Shared Location, and 3)

knowledge sources.
Of(u) for Favored Locations. In contrast, the set of locations
where a user was observed is deﬁned as P(u) = {ρ ∈ O(u)}.
The actual features we used in our experiments are as follows:
a) Common Locations RC(u, v): The simplest metric
to determine the homophiliy between two users u and v is the
number of regions they have visited in common. In particular
this can be computed as RC(u, v) = |P(u) ∩ P(v)|.
b) Total Locations RT (u, v): Analogous to the com-
mon regions, one can also deﬁne the regions two users have
in total and use it as a homophilic feature RT (u, v) =
|P(u) ∪ P(v)|.
c) Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient RJC(u, v): A combination of
the common regions of two users and their total regions is the
overlap of locations which is deﬁned as the fraction of common
locations and locations visited by both users [2]. This feature is
also known as Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient RJC(u, v) = |P (u)∩P (v)|
|P (u)∪P (v)|.
d) Location Observations RO(u, v): Another feature
taken from Cranshaw [2] is the location observations that
is similar to the Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient between two users. It
is computed as the number of locations two users have in
common divided by the sum of locations either user have
RO(u, v) =
|P (u)∩P (v)|
|P (u)|+|P (v)|.
e) Location User-Count RU(u, v): The following three
features were ﬁrst introduced by Cranshaw et al. [2] and try
model the location diversity of regions two users visited in
common. The ﬁrst and most simple feature to include the
popularity of a region is the overall number of observations
of unique users at a certain region. According to this we
calculated the mean user-count RU,µ(u, v) and the standard
deviation of the mean RU,σ(u, v) of all regions two users
visited in common P(u) ∩ P(v).
f) Location Frequency RF (u, v): The second feature
taken from [2] is similar to the previous feature of counting
users at a certain location. We computed the frequency deﬁned
as the overall observations of users at a certain location.
Again we calculated the mean frequency RF,µ(u, v) and the
according standard deviation RF,σ(u, v) of the frequency of
regions two users u and v have in common.
g) Location Entropy RE(u, v): A reﬁnement of the two
previous features, is the entropy that also takes the probabilities
of observations at a location L into account. The probability
that a user has visited a certain region is deﬁned as the number
of observations of the actual users divided by the overall
number of observations at this regions. Let Ou,L be the obser-
vations of a user u at a location L and OL be all observations
at the location L. The probability can then be computed as
probL(u) = |Ou,L|
|OL| . Based on this we can compute the entropy
of a certain location L as EL = − P
u∈UL PL(u)·log(PL(u))
with UL representing all users observed a the location L. With
this deﬁnition we computed the mean entropy RE,µ(u, v) of
the locations two users visited in common and the according
standard deviation of the mean RE,σ(u, v).
V.
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We conducted different kinds of experiments to study the
social interactions between users based on the three different
sources of location information.
In order to conduct these experiments, we created a net-
work from the social interactions obtained from the online
social network of Second Life. In this network, nodes rep-
resented the users and edges indicate the social interactions
between them. These edges were considered as unweighted and
so we add an edge between two users no matter how often they
communicated with each other. Further we did not distinguish
the actual type of interaction and considered text messages,
comments and loves equally. This ﬁnally yielded in a network
of 152,509 users connected by 270,567 edges. Formally, this
can be written as G′
O⟨V ′
O, E′
O⟩ with V ′
O representing the users
with an interaction on their feed and e = (u, v) ∈ E′
O
if user u interacted with user v (comment, posting, love).
Then we enriched the nodes with the observations O(u) from
all three location data sources and removed nodes from the
network if this data was not available in all three sources.
Formally this new network can be deﬁned as GO⟨VO, EO⟩
where VO = {u | u ∈ V ′
O, u ∈ OM, u ∈ OS, u ∈ OF }
and e = (u, v) ∈ EO if user u interacted with user v
(comment, posting, love). This reduced the network size to
14,508 nodes and 23,446 edges. For the actual experiments we
followed Guha et al. [12] who suggest to create a balanced
set of user-pairs with an interaction and without interaction
for the prediction task. In particular we randomly selected
15,000 user-pairs with interaction {e+ = (u, v)|(u, v) ∈
EO, u and v ∈ VO} connecting users V +
O . The remaining
15,000 edges without interaction in between were created by
selecting random user-pairs from the network without inter-
action {e− = (u, v)|(u, v) /∈ EO, u and v ∈ VO}. Using this
network we computed the features described in Section IV for
all 30.000 user-pairs and each location source separately. This
network-setup implies a baseline of 0.5 for the prediction task
in case of random guessing whether a user-pair has interactions
or not.
A. Analysis of Homophily
In the ﬁrst experiment we analyzed similarities and dis-
similarities of user-pairs with interaction e+ and user-pairs
without interaction e− for each location source separately. We
computed the mean values of the features and the according
standard error in either sources separately. Using a one-
sampled Kolmogorov-Smirnov and a Anderson-Darling test
showed that none of the distributions of the features was
from the family of normal distribution. As a consequence

SOTICS 2013 : The Third International Conference on Social Eco-Informatics

and similarly to Bischoff [3], we compared the variances
of all features between interacting and non-interacting user-
pairs with a Levene test (p < 0.01). To test for signiﬁcant
differences of the means, we employed a Mann-Whitney-
Wilcoxon test in case of equal variances and a two-sided
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in case of unequal variances.
B. Feature Engineering
In order to utilize the supervised machine learning algo-
rithms to predict whether or not a user-pair interacted with each
other, we had to determine the features that are most suited for
this task. To assess the impact of each feature separately we
used a simple Collaborative Filtering algorithm for a ﬁrst rough
overview and implemented a method proposed by Liben et
al. [13]: For every user in the network we created ranked lists
of the remaining users in the network based on the homophily
obtained from the single features. To evaluate the performance
of this approach we compared lists with different length to the
actual interaction partners of each user. This was computed as
the fraction of correctly identiﬁed interaction partners divided
by the length of the overall retrieved users also referred to
as the positive predictive value or precision. To validate the
results of this approach we additionally employed the built-
in Information Gain and the Correlation-Based Feature Subset
Selection of the WEKA learning suite [14] to ﬁnd the most
valuable features for supervised learning.
C. Predicting Social Interactions with Supervised Learning
Based on the most valuable features determined for every
region source separately, we tried to predict whether two
users have a social interaction in the online social network.
We combined features selected by the Correlation-Based Fea-
ture Subset Selection for each location source separately and
obtained the three feature sets used for supervised learning
algorithms. Due to the split into 15,000 user-pairs with inter-
actions and 15,000 user-pairs without interactions we reduced
the experiment to a binary classiﬁcation problem. To compare
the different location-based knowledge sources against each
other, we applied the WEKA machine learning suite onto the
combined set of features obtained with feature engineering
for each region source separately. To do so, we applied
three learning algorithms: “Logistic Regression” as it can be
easily interpreted, and “Random Forest” and “Support Vector
Machine” as both of them are suited for high-dimensional data.
For the veriﬁcation of the results provided by the machine
learning tool, we used a ten-fold approach for the split of
training set and test set.

1) Monitored Locations: On average user-pairs with in-
teraction could be found in 0.5 common regions RC(u, v),
had over 12 total regions RT (u, v), and Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient
RJC(u, v) and observations RO(u, v) of around 0.05. For user-
pairs with interaction we furthermore found an average user
count RU,µ(u, v) of over 179, an entropy RE,µ(u, v) of 1.52
and a user frequency RF,µ(u, v) of 637 for commonly visited
regions. For user-pairs without interaction we observed less
commonly visited regions and total regions as well as Jaccard’s
Coefﬁcient and observations. In contrast, for features based
on the location diversity, i.e. entropy, frequency, and user-
count, we observed higher values. With the tests described
in Section V we found signiﬁcant differences for all applied
features.
2) Shared Locations: The characteristics of the features
applied to the Shared Locations were similar to the features
applied to the Monitored Locations. For user-pairs with in-
teraction we observed around 1 common region RC(u, v), 63
total regions RT (u, v), and a Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient RJC(u, v)
and observations RO(u, v) in the same regions of around
0.03. For common regions we observed a average user-count
RU,µ(u, v) of 22, region entropy RE,µ(u, v) of 0.8, and
region frequency RF,µ(u, v) of 92. Similar to the Monitored
Locations dataset we observed higher values for common
regions, Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient, observations, and total regions
for user-pairs with interaction, whereas frequency, user-count
and entropy were lower.
3) Favored Locations: Again we observed similar results as
already described for the previous locations dataset but due to
the reduced number of picks per user the absolute values were
lower. We observed 0.11 common regions RC(u, v) for users
interacting with each other, respectively 0.02 for observations
11

RO(u, v) and Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient RJC(u, v). In contrast
these values were nearly 0 for user-pairs without interaction.
Interacting users had around 8 total regions RT (u, v) whereas
user-pairs without interaction had only around 7 total regions.
For features that model the location diversity (RE(u, v),
RF (u, v), RU(u, v)) we again observed lower values for users
interacting with each other if compared to users without
interaction.
B. Feature Engineering
For a rough estimation of the predictability of interactions
we employed a Collaborative Filtering algorithm using fea-
tures applied to the three location-based knowledge sources.
Previous results of the analysis of homophily showed that user-
pairs with interactions had higher values for common regions,
total regions, Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient and observations. Hence,
we rank this features in this experiment in descending order.
Contrary, features based on the location diversity (RE(u, v),
RF (u, v), RU(u, v)) showed signiﬁcantly lower values for
interacting user-pairs and so we ranked them in ascending
order. In addition to Collaborative Filtering, we used WEKA’s
Information Gain algorithm for veriﬁcation of these results and
ﬁnally a Correlation-Based Feature Subset Selection to ﬁnd
valuable features for further prediction. In Table II we present
the results of Collaborative Filtering and the according values
of the Information Gain algorithm for the features applied to
the three location sources.
1) Monitored Locations: The Collaborative Filtering ap-
proach unveiled a high predictive power for common regions
RC(u, v), total regions RT (u, v), respectively Jaccard’ Co-
efﬁcient RJC(u, v) and common observations RO(u, v) for
different list lengths. However, features modeling location
diversity like user-count, entropy, frequency of user’s common
regions performed inferior. This results were inline with the
Information Gain algorithm that showed similar results for
the computed features. Additionally, Correlation-Based Feature
Subset Selection identiﬁed these features as most valuable.
2) Shared Locations: Collaborative Filtering exposed com-
mon region RC(u, v), Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient RJC(u, v), and
observations RO(u, v) as most valuable. These three features
plus the total number of regions RT (u, v) were also identiﬁed
as best features using the Information Gain algorithm. Similar-
ily, the Correlation-Based Feature Subset Selection algorithm
unveiled Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient RJC(u, v), common observa-
tions RO(u, v), and the total number of regions RT (u, v) as
the most valuable features in the set.
3) Favored Locations: Similar to the previous result the
Collaborative Filtering approach identiﬁed the common re-
gions RC(u, v), Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient RJC(u, v) and common
observations RO(u, v) as most valuable. Information Gain
additionally puts the total number of regions RT (u, v) on
the list which is also inline with the previous result. Finally,
Correlation-Based Feature Subset Selection found common
regions RC(u, v), Jaccard’s Coefﬁcient RJC(u, v) and the
total number of regions RT (u, v) to be best suited for further

Selection for predicting whether two users have an interaction
with each other or not. One can ﬁnd these features highlighted
in bold letters in Table II for different region sources. We
combined these individual features to feature-sets for every
location source separately and predicted the interaction be-
tween user-pairs with three different learning algorithms. We
utilized Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest and used the Area under the ROC curve
(AUC) as main evaluation metric. In Table III the results of
these evaluations are shown and one can see that Logistic
Regression outperforms the two remaining algorithms on each
of the three location-datasets. In particular, we found that the
feature-set applied to the Shared Location dataset predicted
interactions between users with 0.849 AUC which is a boost
of +34.9% if compared to baseline for random guessing. For
the remaining two region sources we observed a predictability
of around 0.63 which is +13% over baseline. Random Forest
and SVM showed similar results but performed inferior.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
In this paper we have harvested data from different sources
of the virtual world of Second Life: First we collected social in-
teraction data between users from the online social network My
Second Life and second, we collected data from three different
and independent location sources, i.e. locations monitored
while users were attending events, locations they explicitely
share, and their favorite locations. For every single location
source we computed 10 features representing the homophily
of user-pairs and employed them to predict whether two users
had social interaction with each other or not. This section
concludes the paper and tries to give answers to the research
questions from Section I and provides possible explanations
for the results derived from the conducted experiments.

RQ1. To answer the ﬁrst research question, we evaluated
the differences between user-pairs that had an interaction in the
online social network and user-pairs without this interaction.
This analysis revealed statistically signiﬁcant differences for
nearly all features: User-pairs with interactions on average vis-
ited more common regions and had more common observations
together. In contrast to this, they visited regions with a lower
user-count, frequency, and entropy which can be interpreted
as sign of intimacy: Users with interactions already know
each other and therefore they meet in places that are less
frequented by other users. We could observe this for all three
data sources but due to the diverse datasets the characteristics
were different: the Shared Locations dataset showed more
distinct tendencies than, for instance the picks dataset with
the given limit of 10 picks per user.
RQ2. To answer the second research question we employed
Collaborative Filtering to predict the social interactions be-
tween the users based on 10 different features independently
across all location sources. We found that the most valuable
features over all the location-based knowledge sources were
the number of common regions RC(u, v), the Jaccard’s Co-
efﬁcient RJC(u, v), and the total number of regions of two
users RT (u, v). Although these characteristics were similar
over all sources, we observed differences in the Information
Gain. Features applied to the Shared Locations seemed best
suited for predicting interactions as the Information Gain was
higher if compared to Favored or Monitored Locations.
RQ3. Considering the Information Gain of features applied
to the three location sources, we already had the premonition
that data obtained from a user’s Shared Locations has the
highest potential to predict interactions. Indeed, a detailed look
at the combined feature sets to predict interactions unveiled
that this dataset worked best among all sources. We believe
that this is for the following two reasons: First, users can
share message from everywhere within the virtual world over
their social network and the data collection approach does
not miss any data. Second, users explicitly share locations
and places they like and spend time in. Other users that visit
their proﬁles because they already know each other, see these
locations, and also visit them. This can be seen as an explicit
promotion of Shared Locations of a user. We believe that
Monitored Location data performed inferior as we only have
a clipping of the actual user’s visited regions due to limited
resources. A similar explanation can be made for the picks
data source but here the limiting factor was not the lack of
crawling resources but the restriction of 10 picks per user.
Overall, the three different learning algorithms applied to the
datasets were stable and show similar results over all three
sources – Logistic Regression showed the best results whereas
Support Vector Machine and Random Forrest were inferior.
For future work we plan to also incorporate the number
of social interactions in our predictive model to better account
for the strengths of social ties between the users. Furthermore,
we plan to account for the variation of time, which we did not
consider in this paper.
