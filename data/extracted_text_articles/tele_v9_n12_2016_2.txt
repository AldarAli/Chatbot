Abstract—The
Orthogonal
Frequency
Division
Multiplexing
(OFDM) is the most commonly used multicarrier modulation
in telecommunication systems because of its efﬁcient use of
frequency resources and its robustness to multipath fading
channels. However, as any multicarrier signal, the Peak-to-
Average-Power Ratio (PAPR) is one of the major drawbacks of
OFDM signals. Many research papers have dealt with the PAPR
mitigation methods, such as clipping methods, tone reservation
based approaches, and partial transmit signals. However, in this
paper we focus on the clipping method. This method is one of
the most efﬁcient adding signal techniques for PAPR reduction
in terms of complexity. Nevertheless, clipping presents many
drawbacks such as a bit error rate degradation, an out-of-band
emission, and a mean power degradation. In this paper, a clipping
method featuring a threshold that adapts to the desired upper
bounded output PAPR is presented. Once the desired output
PAPR has been predeﬁned, the proposed AC approach consists
of clipping each OFDM symbol with an adaptive threshold so
that the PAPR value of the clipped symbol is equal to this
desired output PAPR. This paper proposes three different ways to
compute the adaptive threshold of each OFDM symbol we want
to clip according to the desired output PAPR. The theoretical
analysis and the simulation results validate the interest and
potential of this new clipping method.

INTRODUCTION
The work presented by the authors in the previous AICT
2016 conference in Bruxelles [1], was focusing on the reduc-
tion of the complexity of the Adaptive Clipping (AC) method,
previously presented in [2]. The present paper extends the
work in [1] by introducing a new way to compute the adapted
algorithm to reach the targeted PAPR. The proposed work,
allows to reach the exact solution of the problem, whereas
the computed threshold in [1] and in [2] just allows to get an
approximation. Furthermore, we illustrate, in this paper, the
achieved performances by extensive results, which prove the
interest of our proposal.
The Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) is one of the
main issues of the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex
(OFDM) signal [3]. Many works such as the coding based
techniques [4], [5], the probabilistic based approaches [6],
[7] and the ”adding signal for high peak cancellation” based
techniques [8], [9], [10] have been documented in the literature
for the purpose of PAPR mitigation. The clipping method [11],
[12] is an efﬁcient technique for PAPR mitigation where the
peak-cancellation signal is computed thanks to the clipping
of the signal amplitudes that exceed a predeﬁned threshold A.
This paper focuses on classical clipping method (CC), detailed
in [11]. The main objective of the presented is to propose a
new clipping technique that offers better outcomes than that
of the CC methods in terms of signal degradation, and similar
outcomes in terms of PAPR reduction. In others words, the
proposed clipping method achieves:
1)
A better bit error rate (BER), a lesser out-of-band
(OOB) emission and mean power degradation.
2)
Same performances in terms of PAPR reduction.
Note that, in practice, in CC method, a normalized threshold
is used: ρ = 10log10( A2
Px ) , where Px represents the mean
power of the discrete signal x, whose PAPR has to be reduced.
It can be noted that the normalized threshold deﬁnes the
PAPR, below which the signal is not clipped. Due to the large
amplitude variations of the OFDM signals in the time domain,
the PAPR value of each OFDM symbol highly depends on its
content. Therefore, after achieving the PAPR mitigation thanks
to the CC method [11] by featuring a predeﬁned normalized
threshold, the obtained PAPR value also depends on its content.
Therefore, the upper bounded PAPR of the clipped signal,
at each value of its Complementary Cumulative Distribution
Function (CCDF), increases when the CCDF decreases. This
is illustrated by the left curve depicted in Fig. 1. Note that
this is also the case for the original OFDM CCDF curve. That
means that there is no deterministic upper bounded PAPR for
CC method. This is exactly what we target in this work. This
deterministic value corresponds to the vertical solid blue line
depicted in Fig. 1.
In practice, the suitable upper bounded PAPR value of the
signal for the Input Back Off (IBO) deﬁnition at the High
Power Ampliﬁer (HPA) is chosen where CCDF(Φ) is close
to zero (usually 10−4). In this paper, which is an extension
of the work presented in [1], this value is called the desired
upper bounded PAPR and denoted as PAPR0. Thus, in [1],
[2] the authors have shown that in CC method many OFDM
symbols are either severely clipped or unnecessarily clipped
with respect to this desired upper bounded PAPR0. To illustrate

this assertion, let us depict in Fig. 2 the result of zooming
the zone around 10−1 for the CCDF in Fig. 1. Note that
our main objective is to have a PAPR clipping output whose
value is close to 4.72 dB (the vertical blue line). Therefore,
all the symbols that have a PAPR value between 4.1 dB and
4.72 dB are clipped unnecessarily (see ∆1 in Fig. 2). Besides
this, all the symbols whose PAPR values are between 4.72 dB
and 8.4 dB are too severally clipped by the CC technique in
comparison with the ideal clipping (indicated by ∆2 in Fig. 2).
If we extend these considerations to all CCDF values, we then
obtain the two areas indicated in Fig. 3 as:
•
Area1: symbols are unnecessarily clipped
•
Area2: Symbols are clipped more severely than nec-
essary
In order to avoid these drawbacks, the authors have pro-

posed an AC algorithm in [1], [2], where the threshold is
adapted to the content of each OFDM symbol, according to the
desired upper bounded PAPR value PAPR0. Other AC methods
exist in the literature [13], [14]. In [14], the authors proposed
to adapt the normalized threshold ρ depending on the mapping
constellation of the OFDM signal for a better compromise
between the PAPR reduction and the BER degradation. In [13],
the authors proposed an adaptive iterative clipping and ﬁltering
scheme [15], in which the computation of the amplitude
threshold A, is ﬁrst computed on the basis of the predeﬁned
normalized threshold, and done at each iteration. This latter
approach improves the performances of the system in terms of
PAPR reduction but further degrades the signal. In contrast, in
[2], the proposed AC approach and the CC method [11] achieve
similar performance in terms of PAPR reduction. However,
a better bit error rate (BER), a lesser out-of-band (OOB)
emission, and a lesser mean power degradation are achieved.
Nevertheless, the computational complexity of the proposed
algorithm is high. In fact, an exhaustive search, by means of
a constant step (ϵ) is performed, so as to ﬁnd the optimal
threshold. Therefore, the number of required iterations to ﬁnd
the optimal threshold ρ(x) will depend on both the content of
each OFDM symbol and the step ϵ.
In [1], a fast AC method has been proposed to compute
the value of ρ(x). Presented approach consists of adapting
the step ϵ at each iteration to the content of each OFDM
symbol, this is equivalent to clipp the signal iteratively by
adapting the clipping magnitude at each iteration as a function
of PAPR0 and the content of the clipped signal at the previous
iteration. Therefore, this approach requires less iterations to
ﬁnd the adaptive threshold [2]. This approach is called the
Iterative Adaptive Clipping (IAC). The AC and IAC methods
give both an approximation of the adaptive threshold ρx via
an exhaustive search featuring respectively a constant and a
non constant step. This paper is an extension of the analysis
presented in [1], where we will ﬁrst provide a complete
analysis of both the AC and IAC methods. Then, we will

extend our analysis to present a new approach that allows us
to ﬁnd the exact adaptive threshold ρx. This new approach
is named power approximation based method for adaptive
clipping (PAC).
The paper is organized as follows: In Section II, the problem’s
formulation of the AC principle will be brieﬂy presented. In
Sections III-A and III-B, we will review the AC and the
IAC approaches and we will show that IAC method needs
fewer iterations than AC approach so as to reach ρ(x). In
Section (III-C) the new proposed approach will be presented. A
comparative study pertaining to signal degradation will then be
conducted in Section IV. Finally, conclusions will be presented
in Section V.
II.
PROPOSED APPROACH PRINCIPLE
In this section, after reminding some deﬁnitions and nota-
tions, the AC method is hereafter described.
A. Notations and deﬁnitions
Throughout this paper an OFDM symbol x(t) of duration
Tu is given by the following equation
x(t) =
M−1
X
m=0
Xm ej2πmF t, with 0 ≤ t ≤ Tu,
(1)
where M is the total number of carriers, F =
1
Tu is the inter-
carrier space, mF the mth frequency, and Xm the symbol
carried out by the mth carrier at time Tu.
We denote x = [x0, . . . , xLM−1] the vector containing
the discrete samples of x(t) after the oversampling operation.
It has been demonstrated that it can be efﬁciently computed
thanks to use of Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IDFT)1. As
described in [16], since the PAPR mitigation operation is
generally undertaken in the discrete time domain, the over-
sampling factor L should be greater than 4 in order to get
a good approximation of the PAPR of the analogue OFDM
symbol x(t). The PAPR value of x is given by the following
expression
PAPR[x]
=
max
m=0,...,ML−1

|xm|2	
Px
,
(2)
where Px is the mean power of the discrete OFDM symbol x.
Since x is a random variable, the Complementary Cumu-
lative Distribution Function (CCDF) deﬁned by (3) is used
to characterize the useful upper bounded PAPR for the IBO’s
characterization. In practice, this upper bounded PAPR value
can be chosen at CCDF(.)(Φ) = 10−4 as
CCDFx(Φ) = Prob

PAPR[x] ≥ Φ

(3)
In this paper, this upper bounded PAPR value will be denoted
by γ4 and will be referred to as the achieved PAPR or output
PAPR. Note that, in our proposed approach, this value will be
denoted by PAPR0. More generally, the positive scalar γe will
represent in this paper the upper bounded PAPR of symbols

where CCDFy(Φ) = Prob[PAPR[y] ≥ Φ]
and y = [y0, . . . , yML−1] is the OFDM symbol after clipping.
B. The proposed AC approach principle
The CC proposed in [11] is one of the most popular
clipping technique for PAPR reduction known in the literature.
It is sometimes called hard clipping or soft clipping. To avoid
any confusion, the term CC will be used thereafter in this
paper. In [11], its effects on the performance of OFDM,
which include the determination of the power spectral density,
the PAPR and the BER, are evaluated. The function-based
clipping, used in CC technique, is deﬁned as
f (r, A) =

r,
r ≤ A
A,
r > A ,
(5)
where A is the magnitude clipping threshold. From (5) we can
say that, if some samples of x are greater than the clipping
threshold A, then the PAPR value of the output signal y,
obtained after PAPR reduction that uses the CC method, can
be expressed as follows
PAPRy
=
A2
Py
.
(6)
Given, A =

Having determined the PAPR0 value, the signal x
needs to be clipped. On that basis, the AC method
consists ﬁrstly in ﬁnding ρ(x) so that the PAPR value
of y, obtained after clipping x featuring ρ(x), is equal
to PAPR0. In other words, the AC method consists of
adapting the clipping threshold ρ(x) of each OFDM
symbol x that we want to clip with according to
the desired upper bounded PAPR value, i.e., PAPR0.
Therefore, this stage consists of solving the following
equation
PAPR0 = γ4 =

,
(8)
where Py is the mean power of the clipped signal y.
2)
Clip the OFDM symbol x as in (5) thanks to its
adaptive threshold ρ(x).
From (7), it can be noticed that Py depends on the unknown
parameter ρn. Therefore, solving (8) is not a trivial problem.
Thus, the main challenge of the AC is the computation of
the adaptive threshold for each OFDM symbol. In [1], [2],
two approaches based on a exhaustive search are proposed,
so as to approximate the adaptive threshold. These approaches
will be reviewed more clearly hereafter in Section III-A and
Section III-B, respectively.
The following section presents a complete analysis of the
AC and IAC method [1] and the description of the new
proposed approaches for the computation of the adaptive
threshold ρ(x).
III.
THE ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD COMPUTATION
After having described the AC method principle in the
previous section, we propose, here, a complete analysis of three
different methods for computing the adaptive threshold.
A. Comprehensive search carried out by means of a constant
step: AC method
As it is noticed in Section II, the computation of the adap-
tive threshold for each OFDM symbol is not a trivial problem
since the mean power Py of the clipped symbol depends on
the unknown ρ(x), see (8). In order to bypass this difﬁculty,
the authors propose in [2] to ﬁnd an approximation of ρ(x)
thanks to a exhaustive search within the interval [0, PAPR0].
In fact, from (7) it can be noticed that, for each value of
PAPR0 and x that we want to clip, their adaptive threshold
is less than PAPR0. Besides, if ρ1 and ρ2 are two clipping
thresholds such that (ρ1 − ρ2) is close to zero, the PAPR
values of the clipped OFDM symbols using these thresholds
are approximately equal. Thus, where ϵ > 0 and δ > 0, the
authors propose to check successively ρ0 = γ4, ρ1 = ρ0 − ϵ,
. . . , ρm = ρm−1 − ϵ,. . ., to reach ρ(x) , which satisﬁes
(γ4 − PAPRy) ≤ δ
(9)
Fig. 4 describes the chart of the adaptive threshold compu-
tation. In the rest of the paper, this approach will be named the
AC method. From Fig. 4, it can be noted that, for each OFDM
symbol x featuring with a PAPR value greater that PAPR0,
the PAPR value PAPR[y] obtained after a clipping process
featuring its adaptive threshold ρx is less than PAPR0+δ. Thus,
if δ is sufﬁciently small, then PAPRy ≃ PAPR0. Therefore, the
CCDF curve of the AC method will approach the CCDF curve

of the ideal clipping depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 5 depicts the PAPR
values (PAPR[y]) obtained after a PAPR reduction carried out
by means of the AC and CC method, versus their PAPR values
before clipping (the initial PAPR values).
Figure 5. PAPR values after a PAPR reduction obtained by means of the AC
and CC methods for OFDM symbols, versus the associated PAPR value
before PAPR reduction. M = 64, L = 4, ρ = 5 dB and
PAPR0 = γ4(ρ) = 5.82 dB.
The simulation results depicted in Fig. 5 conﬁrm that in the
AC method the output PAPR value of each clipped symbol, i.e.,
PAPR[y] is approximately equal to the desired output PAPR
value, i.e., PAPR0. Therefore, where PAPR0 = γ4(ρ), the
AC method allows us to prevent from clipping the symbol
unnecessarily or more severely than necessary as it is the
case where the CC method is used. In fact, from Fig. 5, we
remark that the symbols, which feature an initial PAPR value
that is included in [5, 5.82] (in dB), are unnecessarily clipped.
We can also note that those featuring an initial PAPR value
greater than 5.82 dB are severely clipped with respect to the
obtained useful PAPR value that is γ4(ρ) = 5.82 dB, i.e., the

upper bounded PAPR at a CCDF clip that is close to zero
(here 10−4). Therefore, the AC will degrade less the OFDM
symbol obtained by means of clipping than the CC method and
and offers similar performances in terms of PAPR reduction.
Further simulation pertaining to this aspect will be presented
in Section IV.
Since the adaptive threshold has to be computed the AC
method is very complex compared to the CC method. From
Fig. 4, it can be noticed that, at each iteration, a CC operation is
required. Thus, in what follows, the convergence spread, i.e.,
the mean of number of iterations required so as to ﬁnd the
adaptive threshold of each OFDM symbol, will be discussed.
To this end, let us consider N[x,AC] the number of performed
iterations that is needed in order to ﬁnd the adaptive threshold
of the OFDM symbol x. For each x, let us consider ∆Ex as
the mean power variation after PAPR reduction using the CC
method or proposed clipping method, and that is deﬁned as
follows
∆Ex = 10log10
Py
Px

(10)
Fig. 6 depicts the number of iterations performed by the
AC method, so as to come close ρx versus the value of ∆Ex.
The results depicted in Fig. 6 show that the number of
iterations performed so as to ﬁnd the adaptive of each OFDM
symbol depends on its content (∆Ex). In fact, for each OFDM
symbol x, it can be noted that when ∆Ex increases, the
number of iterations that are required to ﬁnd ρx increases
signiﬁcantly and the contrary is also true.
B. Comprehensive search carried out by mean a non constant
step (IAC method)
In this section, we present the IAC method, and the theo-
retical analysis of its performances in terms of PAPR reduction
and convergence spread (number of required iterations to ﬁnd
the ρ(ρ)). The theoretical comparison with AC, as regards the
convergence speed, will be also presented.
Figure 7. Flow chart of the IAC approach.
Since δ > 0 and since there exist an OFDM symbol
x featuring a PAPR value greater than PAPR0, the IAC
approach consists of searching the adaptive threshold ρ(x),
which satisﬁes (9). In order to ﬁnd this threshold we check
successively ρ0 = PAPR0, ρ1 = ρ0 − ϵ1,...,ρm = ρm−1 − ϵm
where ϵm is the step that allows us to go from stage m − 1 to
the stage m. In contrast to the work presented in [2], the step
ϵm is not constant and depends on the content of each OFDM
symbol and its clipped version at the previous iteration. To this
end, we denote y(m)where m = 1, 2, ..., as being the clipped
OFDM symbol featuring the threshold ρm, and the step ϵm at
the mth iteration is expressed as follows
ϵm = 10log10

with the notation Py(−1) = Px at the ﬁrst iteration. The ﬂow
chart of the adaptive threshold ρ(x) search in the IAC approach
is depicted in Fig. 7.
The clipping level magnitude Am at the mth iteration can
be expressed, from the normalized threshold ρm, as

Then, from (11) we obtain after some derivation the following

(13)
Therefore, by substituting (13) in (6) the PAPR of the
clipped signal at the mth iteration satisﬁes the following
expression
PAPR[y(m)] − PAPR0 = ϵm+1.
(14)
If we deﬁne ϵm+1 ≤ δ as the criteria for stopping the IAC
method at the mth iteration, then, for each OFDM symbol, the
PAPR value of the signal, after PAPR reduction by IAC, is
less than PAPR0 + δ. Thus, the CCDF curve of the IAC will
approach the ideal clipping CCDF. Therefore, the IAC method
allows us to get the desired deterministic upper bounded PAPR.
From (13) we remark that, as it is noticed in the in-
troduction, the IAC method is equivalent to clipping the
signal iteratively, via an adaptation of the clipping magnitude
according to PAPR0 and the content of the clipped signal
at the previous iteration. The following Algorithm 1 describes
the proposed IAC technique.

(15)
Proposition 3.1: For each OFDM symbol x, we need to
ﬁnd the value of ρN[xn,IAC] that depends on the number of
iterations performed by AC, and the used step ϵx.
To prove this statement (see the proof details in Appendix(A)),
it is sufﬁcient to show that the AC method performs N[xn,IAC]
iterations, so as to ﬁnd the ρNx,AC, where the used step is
ϵ = ϵx. In other words, it is sufﬁcient to show that N[xn,IAC] =
N[xn,AC] when ϵ = ϵx.
Thus, for each OFDM symbol, the comparison between
N[x,AC] and N[x,IAC] can be made by means of a comparison
between ϵx and ϵ. Since x is random, we will compare IAC and
AC, in terms of convergence spread, on the basis of the average
number of iterations required by each algorithms, which is
equivalent to compare E [ϵx], as deﬁned in (16), with ϵ (the
constant step in AC).

Since, in the IAC method, the stopping criterion is ϵm < ϵ
(see Algorithm 1), the comparison between E[ϵx] and ϵ can
be achieved by comparing E[ϵ1] (the ﬁrst step in IAC method)
with ϵ. Therefore, we can deduce that, for each PAPR0 NAC ≥

The AC and IAC methods give both an approximation of
the adaptive threshold ρx, via respectively an exhaustive search
featuring a constant and a non constant step. In this paper, we
propose a new approach that allows to ﬁnd the exact solution
of (8). This approach is based on an approximation of the
mean power Py and is presented in the Section III-C.
C. Mean power approximation based approach: the PAC
method
In this section, a new approach to compute the adaptive
threshold ρx is presented. This approach consists of using an
approximation of the mean power Py, see (8), to compute
ρx. Thus, it will be named PAC (Power approximation based
approach for AC).
Let us consider A(x) the clipping magnitude obtained from
the normalized adaptive threshold ρ(x), i.e.,
A(x) =
p
Px

10
ρx


(19)
From (8), it can be easily remarked that 0 ≤ ρ(x) ≤ PAPR0,
therefore,
A0 ≤ A(x) ≤ A1
(20)
where
A0
=
p
Px
A1
=

PAPR0

(21)
For each clipping magnitude A, let us consider I(A) the
set comprising the index of the x values, which exceed the
clipping magnitude A, i.e.,
I(A) = {l, such that |xl| > A}
(22)
Therefore, from (20) we have
I(A1) ⊂ I(A(x)) ⊂ I(A0),
(23)
Since the value of I(A(x)) is known, (8) can be expressed as
a function of the unknown value A(x) as follows

It can be noted from (24), that if I(A(x)) is known, then the
mean power of the clipped symbol that uses, i.e., Py, can be
expressed explicitly as a function of x and A(x). Therefore, the
suitable clipping magnitude can be computed thanks to (24).
Thus, using (23), the PAC method comprises two stages:
Stage 1: Computation of I(A(x)).
Since A0 and A1 have been determined, the goal consists
of ﬁnding Amin and Amax via a dichotomy search method so
that:

Graphically, as A0 and A1 are known, the dichotomy search
allows us to move from the conﬁguration shown in Fig. 12 to
the conﬁguration shown in Fig. 13.

clipping, for each OFDM symbol where PAPR0 = γ4(ρ) (see
Fig 15). In fact, we note that, when the CC method is used,
the symbols whose initial PAPR value is included in [5, 5.82]
(in dB) are unnecessarily clipped and those with an initial
PAPR value is greater than 5.82 dB are severely clipped with
respect to the obtained useful PAPR value γ4(ρ) = 5.82 dB
(i.e., the upper bounded PAPR of the CCDF at a clip rate
that is close to zero (here 10−4)). Therefore, the PAC method
will degrade less the OFDM symbols after the clipping than
the CC method for the same PAPR reduction performances.
Besides, unlike the AC and IAC methods, the PAPR value of
each clipped symbol, in the PAC method, is exactly equal to
PAPR0 = γ4(ρ). More simulation results will be presented in
Section IV. As in the previous section, we will evaluate, in
what follows, the number of required iteration so as to ﬁnd
A(x). To this end, for each OFDM symbol x, let us consider
N[x,PAC] the number of performed iterations so as to ﬁnd A(x).
Fig. 16 depicts the number of iterations performed by the
AC method in order to approach ρx versus ∆Ex. Obtained
results depicted in Fig. 16 show that the number of iterations
performed, so as to ﬁnd the adaptive threshold of each OFDM
symbol does not depend on ∆Ex. In fact, the curve depicting
the number of iterations in function of ∆Ex is not monotonic.
On the basis of the simulation results depicted in Figs. 6 and 9,
it appears that this approach requires generally more iterations
than the AC and IAC approaches. In Section IV, the previous
approaches and the PAC method will be compared as regards
the average number of required iterations versus PAPR0. In
other words, we will compare E[N[x,AC]], E[N[x,IAC]] and
E[N[x,PAC]] where E[.] is the expectation. The Monte Carlo
method will be used for this estimation.
IV.
SIMULATION RESULTS
As in the previous section, the performance of the proposed
AC, IAC and PAC methods versus that of the CC method are
analysed within the framework of a speciﬁc PAPR reduction.
In other words, if the CC method is performed by means of
the predeﬁned normalized threshold ρ, the AC, IAC and PAC
will be performed using and PAPR0 = γ4(ρ) and PAPR0 =
γ4(ρ)−ϵ, where γ4(ρ) denotes the PAPR achieved via the CC
method. Note that, γ4(ρ) is the upper bounded PAPR for a
10γ4 value. The simulations are performed for an OFDM signal
featuring 16-QAM modulation, M = 64 and an oversampling
factor L = 4.
Figs. 17 and 18, with ρ = 3.5 dB and 5 dB, respectively,
conﬁrm that the CCDF curves of the AC, IAC and PAC
approximate the ideal clipping CCDF curve. Besides, the
proposed AC methods and the CC method achieve the same
upper bounded PAPR value for a CCDF curves clip rate equal
to 10−4. It is worth noting that given the depicted results
the AC, IAC and PAC methods reach a deterministic upper
bounded PAPR. In the following, the AC, IAC and PAC
methods are compared with the CC method as regards the
BER degradation.
The results depicted in Figs. 19 and 20 show that the AC,
IAC, and PAC methods outperform the CC method in terms
of BER degradation. The gain obtained for a BER of 10−4, is
approximately equal to 0.5 dB in Fig. 20 and 3 dB in Fig. 19.
These results conﬁrm the theoretical analysis undertaken in
Sections III-A, III-B and III-C, where the authors have shown
that, where the CC method is used many OFDM symbols are
clipped more severely (see AREA 2 in Fig. 3) than necessary
or clipped unnecessarily (see AREA 1 in Fig. 3) with respect
to γ4.
The mean power degradation and the adjacent channels
pollution, which is due to the effect of the OOB components,
are depicted in Fig. 21 and Fig. 22.
From the simulation results depicted in Fig. 21, it can
be noticed that the AC, IAC, and PAC methods decrease
less the mean power of the OFDM symbol after a PAPR
reduction than the CC method featuring the same achieved
PAPR for a CCDF’s clip rate equal to 10−4. For example,
where γ4 = 4.72 dB, ∆E = −0.47 dB in CC method and
Figure 16. Number of iterations performed by the PAC method so as to ﬁnd
A(x) versus ∆Ex. M = 64, L = 4, ρ = 3.5 dB and
PAPR0 = γ4(ρ) = 4.62 dB.

∆E = −0.25 dB in the proposed AC methods.
Fig. 22 depicts the Power Spectrum Density (PSD) of the
OFDM signal before and after PAPR reduction where using
the proposed AC method and the CC method.
Besides the achieved BER performance in Figs. 19, 20, and
attained mean power variation in Fig. 21, it can be noted from
Fig. 22 that the proposed AC methods are less polluting than
the CC method when PAPR0 = γ4−ϵ, i.e., for the same PAPR
value. As a general conclusion, the obtained results pertaining
to mean power degradation, Out-Of-Band emission and BER
degradations conﬁrm that where PAPR0 = γ4 − ϵ, i.e., within
the framework of a similar achieved output PAPR, the AC,
IAC and PAC methods induce less degradation than the CC
method (see Figs. 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23, which is a zoom of
Fig. 22).
In the following, we compare the required average number
of iterations performed by the proposed AC method so as to
ﬁnd the adaptive threshold of each OFDM symbol that we
want to clip. Fig. 24 shows that IAC method converges more
quickly than AC and PAC methods. The simulation results
show also that the PAC method required more iterations than
the AC and IAC methods so as to ﬁnd the suitable bound of
the adaptive magnitude clipping A(x). However, it is important
to note that the PAC method gives an exact solution of (8)
whereas the AC and IAC give an approximation of the solution.
Besides, it can be remarked that N1 ≥ N2 when γ4 ≤ 6,
which is coherent with equation (18) (with ϵ = 0.1 dB ⇒

= 5.77 dB ≃ 6 dB).
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, a new clipping method is presented. In the
latter, each OFDM symbol is clipped with respect to the
desired output upper bounded PAPR0, which is obtained thanks
to an adaptive threshold. Three methods (AC, IAC, and PAC)
are proposed for the computation of the adaptive threshold.

this paper show that the adaptive threshold can be efﬁciently
computed by means of the IAC method. This approach con-
verges more quickly than the one based on exhaustive research
featuring a constant step and than the PAC method. However,
the PAC method allows ﬁnding the exact adaptive threshold
for each OFDM symbol. Thanks to these approaches, the
proposed AC method achieves the best performances whatever
the method to compute the threshold is, and offers similar
performances in terms of PAPR reduction. Furthermore, the
proposed AC method gives a deterministic desired upper
bounded PAPR, which is very important for the IBO deﬁnition
in the case of high power ampliﬁers (HPA). Our future work
will focus on the extension of the proposed work to other
clipping functions such as deep clipping and smooth clipping,
combined with Out Of Band noise suppression approaches.

Proof: In this section, we detail the proof related to (15).
Therefore, let ρm, m = 1, 2, . . . , be the checked step at the
m-th iteration (see Fig. 4). Then, from (7), the PAPR value of
the clipped OFDM symbol using the threshold ρm in the AC
method can be expressed as follows
PAPR[y(m)]
=
PAPR0 − (m − 1)ϵ + 10log10( Px
