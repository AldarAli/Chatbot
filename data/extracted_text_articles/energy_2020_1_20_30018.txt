Abstract—This study aims to address the question “How to
predict power outages?” A statistical model in Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) is used to predict power-
outage-event duration and customer calls using a stepwise
regression algorithm. The model presented in this study can
help advance smart-grid reliability
by
predicting
power
outages and taking the necessary steps to prevent them. Future
work may involve enhancing the model’s success and adding
significant predictive variables.
Keywords—data analytics; power-failure; smart-grid.
I. INTRODUCTION
In a short time, electrical power has become a necessity
of modern life. Our work, healthcare, leisure, economy, and
livelihood depend on the constant supply of electrical power.
Even a temporary power outage can lead to relative chaos,
financial setbacks, and possible loss of life. U.S. cities
dangle on electricity and, without a constant supply from the
power grid, pandemonium would ensue. Power outages can
be especially tragic when they endanger life-support systems
in hospitals and nursing homes or systems in synchronization
facilities such as airports, train stations, and traffic control.
The economic cost of power interruptions to U.S. electricity
consumers is $79 billion annually in damages and lost
economic activity [1]. In 2017, Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory
provided
an
update,
estimating
power-
interruption costs have increased more than 68% per year
since their 2004 study [2].
Many reasons underlie current power failures. Among
these reasons are severe weather, damage to electric
transmission lines, shortage of circuits, and the aging of the
power-grid infrastructure. Severe weather is the leading
cause of power outages in the United States [3]. In 2019,
weather events as a whole cost U.S. utilities $306 billion: the
highest figure ever recorded by the federal government [4].
The aging of the grid infrastructure is another noteworthy
reason for power failures. In 2008, the American Society of
Civil Engineers gave the U.S. power-grid infrastructure an
unsatisfactory grade [5]. They stated in a report that the
power-transmission system in the United States required
immediate attention. Furthermore, the report mentioned that
the U.S. electric-power grid is similar to those of third-world
countries. According to the Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI), equipment such as transformers controlling power
transmission need to be replaced, as they have exceeded their
expected lifespan considering the materials’ original design
[6].
Electrical outages have three main causes: (1) hardware
and technical failures, (2) environment-related, and (3)
human error [7]. Hardware and technical failures are due to
equipment
overload,
short
circuits,
brownouts,
and
blackouts, to name a few [8]–[10]. These failures are often
attributed to unmet peak usage, outdated equipment, and
malfunctioning back-up power systems. Environment-related
causes for power outages comprise weather, wildlife, and
trees that come into contact with power lines. Lightning,
high winds, and ice are common causes of weather-related
power interruptions. Also, squirrels, snakes, and birds that
come in contact with equipment such as transformers and
fuses can cause equipment to momentarily fail or shut down
completely [8]. As for the third main cause for electrical
outages, human error, the Uptime Institute estimated that
human error causes roughly 70% of the problems that plague
data centers. Hacking can be included in the human-error
category [11].
Analytics have been a popular topic in research and
practice, particularly in the energy field. The use of analytics
can help advance smart-grid reliability through, for example,
elucidating a root cause of power failure, defining a solution
for a blackout through data, or implementing a solution with
continuous monitoring and management. In this research
paper, the aim is to unveil the novel use of data analytics in
predicting power-outage-event duration and customer calls.
As the objective in this research is to advance smart-grid
reliability, this paper explores ways to create a predictive
model for power outages.
II. DATA SELECTION AND METHODOLOGY
EPRI’s data repository includes the primary datasets used
to conduct this analysis. The data sets include data from
advanced metering systems, supervisory-control and data-
acquisition
systems,
Geographic
Information
Systems,
outage-management
systems,
distribution-management
systems,
asset-management
systems,
work-management
systems,
customer-information
systems,
and
intelligent
electronic-device databases. Access to datasets was provided
as part of EPRI’s data-mining initiative; the initiative
provides a test bed for data exploration and innovation and
seeks to solve major challenges faced by the utility industry
[12].

To further enhance EPRI’s dataset, data from other
institutions
are
collected
and
aggregated.
Specifically,
Georgia Spatial Data Infrastructure and the Georgia GIS
Clearinghouse are the sources for monthly temperature and
precipitation data [13]. Additional data regarding storm
events and storm details come from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration website (NOAA) [14]. The
data size is about 76,000 outages with 13 attributes.
The first step of the project methodology was to load data
files
from
EPRI’s
Data
Repository
along
with
all
aforementioned weather data to ArcGIS, the Geographic
Information
Systems
platform
created
by
ESRI.
To
streamline and make sure that the process is reusable and
repeatable, ModelBuilder tool in ArcGIS is utilized to design
data workflow. The workflow models spatially join the 48
map layers of weather data (from the Georgia Spatial Data
Infrastructure and the Georgia GIS Clearinghouse website)
with the outage map layer provided by EPRI. This serves as
a final dataset for the study. Next, data exploration through
correlational analysis in SPSS and GeoDa software has been
conducted. The final step was to run a stepwise regression in
SPSS.
Prior to all statistical analyses, data preparation follows
these steps:
•
Several variables need expert interpretation. For
instance, the following variables: forestry expected pruning
staff hours, average standard tree-pruning miles with bucket,
average mechanical tree-pruning miles, average climbing
tree-pruning miles, and actual pruning staff hours/circuit
mile,
had
missing
data.
Aligned
with
the
expert’s
instruction, missing data for these variables is replaced with
a zero (0).
•
The variable pole age had missing data. Per the
instruction of the client’s expert, transformer age replaces the
missing data on pole age, with the reasoning that poles and
transformers are routinely installed in tandem.
•
The following variables: average climbing tree
pruning miles, average standard tree-pruning miles with
bucket, average mechanical tree-pruning miles, and forestry
expected pruning staff hours either perfectly correlated (r =
1.00) with each other or nearly perfectly correlated (r > 0.90)
with
each
other.
Thus,
these
variables
injected
multicollinearity
issues
into
the
stepwise-regression
equations. Due to the high level of multicollinearity, all of
these variables are removed from the regression equation
except one, forestry expected pruning staff hours.
•
A stepwise regression algorithm is employed to
create two regression equations. As Vogt [16] notes,
researchers use a stepwise regression algorithm to find the
“best” equation possible when regressing a dependent
variable onto multiple independent variables.
In other
words,
only
sstatistically
significant
predictors
of the
dependent variable in a stepwise regression.
III. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
A. Descriptive Statistics in SPSS
Figures 1 and 2 were the outcomes of the initial data
exploration
of
power-outage
events.
Percentages
and
frequencies were calculated for two main categories of
outages: either based on storm event or due to forestry
management. The breakdown is shown in Table I.
Ritchey
[15]
notes
that
for
categorical
variables,
percentages and frequencies are the appropriate descriptive
statistics to report. A statistical summary was calculated for
all continuous variables in the sample. These data appear in
Table II.

Ritchey [15] notes that for continuous variables, means

statistics to report.
B. Correlational Results
Results of correlation analysis in SPSS indicated a strong
positive correlation between variables, such as storm events
and outage-event duration . As expected, a storm event,
precipitation, older poles, higher forestry expected pruning
human hours, and higher levels of transformer age increased
outage-event
duration.
A
negative correlation between
variables appeared between variables such as forestry
management and outage-event customer calls. Surprisingly,
engaging in forestry management, having older poles, and
having lower levels of actual pruning human hours/circuit
mile decreases the number of outage-event customer calls.

Statistically significant correlations were flagged in the
correlation table (Table III) in the following manner:

A single star (*) denotes a significant correlation at
the p = .05 alpha level.

A double star (**) denotes a significant correlation at
the p = .01 alpha level.

No stars means the correlation is not statistically
significant, and no relationship exists among the two
variables in question.

An inverse correlation was denoted by a negative sign
(-). An inverse correlation means that as one variable
increases in value, the other variable decreases in
value.

A positive correlation was denoted by the absence of
a negative sign (-). A positive correlation means that
as one variable increases in value, the other variable
increases in value.

C. Multiple Linear Regression Results
As Ritchey [15] notes, a multiple linear regression
technique is appropriate when the dependent variable is
continuous in nature and two or more independent variables
are in use. The current circumstances satisfy these criteria.
The idea of stepwise regression is to add all independent
variables into a regression equation that relates to the
dependent variables. Then, the process involves iteratively
peruse the regression, removes the variables that are not
statistically contribute to the dependent variable. In this
paper, we have 2 dependent variables of interest: outage-
event customer calls and outage-event duration. These
dependent variables will result in two regression equations
that will be described below.
Table IV presents the results of the stepwise multiple
linear regression of outage-event customer calls onto the
several independent predictors. The Omnibus F-test, shown
in Table IV, is statistically significant (F = 18.217; df = 5,
76841; p < .001). Thus, the decomposition of effects in the
regression model can proceed.

the
number
of

Specifically, having higher levels of forestry expected
pruning staff hours (B = 0.004, p < .001) and higher levels of
transformer age (B = 0.499, p = .003) increase the number of
outage-event customer calls. The adjusted R2 value was
identical to the R2 value.

linear regression of outage-event duration onto the several
independent predictors. The Omnibus F-Test in Table V is
statistically significant (F = 218.672; df = 5, 76841; p <

Thus, decomposition of effects in the regression
model can proceed.

event duration.
Specifically, having a storm event (B =

IV. CONCLUSION
This study aimed to address “How to predict power
outages.” To address the research, A predictive novel model
was developed in SPSS to predict the power-outage-event
duration and customer calls. A stepwise regression algorithm
was used for the two regression equations. The SPSS model
presented
in
this
study
can
help
advance
smart-grid
reliability by predicting power outages and taking the
necessary steps to prevent them. Future work may involve
enhancing the model’s success and adding significant
predictive variables. Data analytics can be a major resource
of assistance for managing power-failure events.
One limitation of this research is that pole-age data was
used as a proxy for infrastructure age and the rest of the
equipment data. Future work may involve connecting to
virtually any type of streaming data feed and transforming
data-analytics
applications
into
frontline
decision
applications,
predicting
and
updating
power-outage
incidents as they occur.
From this research, it was concluded that SPSS and GIS
tools offers a solution to analyze the electric-grid distribution
system. This model provides evidence that SPSS can
perform the analysis to predict power-outage-event duration
and customer calls. If additional funds and data are made
available, one can expand on this analysis to create a custom
solution for the utility industry to control and forecast power
outages. Data analytics can be a major resource of assistance
for electronic-inspection systems, to lower the duration of
customer outages, to improve crew-response time, and to
reduce labor and overtime costs.
