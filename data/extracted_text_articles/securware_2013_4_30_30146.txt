Abstract—Social network services have become one of the
dominant human communication and interaction paradigms.
However, the emergence of highly stealth attacks perpetrated by
bots in social-networks lead to an increasing need for efﬁcient
detection methodologies. The bots objectives can be as varied
as those of traditional human criminality by acting as agents
of multiple scams. Bots may operate as independent entities
that create fake (extremely convincing) proﬁles or hijack the
proﬁle of a real person using his infected computer. Detecting
social networks bots may be extremely difﬁcult by using human
common sense or automated algorithms that evaluate social
relations. However, bots are not able to fake the characteristic
human behavior interactions over time. The pseudo-periodicity
mixed with random and sometimes chaotic actions characteristic
of human behavior is still very difﬁcult to emulate/simulate.
Nevertheless, this human uniqueness is very easy to differentiate
from other behavioral patterns. As so, novel behavior analysis
and identiﬁcation methodologies are necessary for an accurate
detection of social network bots. In this work, we propose a new
paradigm that, by jointly analyzing the multiple scales of users’
interactions within a social network, can accurately discriminate
the characteristic behaviors of humans and bots within a social
network. Consequently, different behavior patterns can be built
for the different social network bot classes and typical humans
interactions, enabling the accurate detection of one of most recent
stealth Internet threats.

I. INTRODUCTION
Together with the growing predominance of social networking
services in human communication, a set of scam attacks
perpetrated by bots [1], [2] have emerged. We are currently
witnessing a major increasing in cybercrime attacks against
individuals targeting their personal data and ﬁnancial assets
[3], [4]. Most of the current Internet malware threats dissem-
inate themselves using social engineering and, mainly, using
social networks [5], since social networking provides an open
ﬁeld for illicit activities [6]. Social networking sites are always
improving their security but this is a constant race behind
the leading criminals [7]. Existing botnets [8], [9] can use
social networking services to spread themselves, but more
importantly, can use social networks to impersonate the owner
of the controlled machine in order to obtain valuable personal
information or force the person to interact with unwanted in-
dividuals or services. One of the better documented examples
of social networking services abuse for malicious purposes
was Koobface [10], [11]. Being currently the largest social
networking service, Facebook is the main vector of attack via
social networking services [12]. Current techniques to detect
bots within a social network rely on automated algorithms that
evaluate social relations. Based on graph-theory techniques,
they try to detect unnatural relations in social networks [13],
[9]. Another technique used to detect bot activity measures
mouse movements and keystrokes produced while interacting
in the generation of online contents. In [14] this class of
behavioral analysis was applied in blogging activities, but
it can also be easily applied to social networks interfaces.
The main downside of this approach is that it must rely on
software loaded on the client browser, which can be difﬁcult to
implement and certainly impossible to generalize to all users
due to conﬁdentiality constrains. A viable solution should only
rely on ubiquitous statistics that do not compromise the users
privacy, namely counting the number of social interactions per
time interval (e.g., number of posts, number of likes, number
of photo uploads).
It is extremely difﬁcult to program a bot to replicate
the characteristic human behavior of social interactions over
time. Humans actions have an inherent pseudo-periodicity
mixed with random (and sometimes chaotic) actions which
are almost impossible to emulate/simulate. Nevertheless, this
human uniqueness is very easy to differentiate from other
behavioral patterns. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new
methodology that, by jointly analyzing the multiple scales of
the users’ interactions within a social network, can accurately
discriminate the characteristic behaviors of humans and bots
within a social network. Consequently, different behavior
signatures can be use to accurately detect bots acting with
a social network.
The proposed methodology applies the concept of multi-
scalling analysis based on scalograms to the statistical pro-
cesses that describe the interaction of a user within the social
network. Scalograms reveal much information about the nature
of non-stationary processes that was previously hidden, so they
are applied to a lot of different scientiﬁc areas: diagnosis
of special events in structural behavior during earthquake
excitation, ground motion analysis, transient building response
to wind storms, analysis of bridge response due to vortex
shedding, among others [15].
The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows:
Section II presents some important background on multiscal-
ing analysis; Section III presents the characteristic behaviors

differ; Section IV presents the results of a proof-of-concept of
the proposed detection methodologies and, ﬁnally, Section V
presents some brief conclusions about the presented detection
methodologies.
II. MULTISCALING ANALYSIS
The main purposes of a multiscaling analysis is to identify the
most important time-scales of (pseudo-periodicity) activity and
quantify the constancy of that pseudo-periodicity. In order to
achieve that objective, it is necessary to quantify the activity
over time for multiple timescales.
Wavelets are mathematical functions that are used to di-
vide a given signal into its different timescales components.
Wavelets enable the analysis of each one of the signal compo-
nents in an appropriate scale. Starting with a mother wavelet
ψ(t), a family ψτ,s(t) of ”wavelet daughters” can be obtained
by simply scaling and translating ψ(t):
ψτ,s(t) =
1
p
|s|
ψ(t − τ
s
)
(1)
where s is a scaling or dilation factor that controls the width of
the wavelet (factor
1
√
|s| is introduced to guarantee the energy
preservation, ∥ψτ,s∥ = |ψ|) and τ is a translation parameter
controlling the time location of the wavelet. Scaling a wavelet
simply means stretching it (if |s| > 1) or compressing it (if
|s| < 1), while translating it simply means shifting its position
in time.
Given a signal x(t), its Continuous Wavelet Transform
(CWT) with respect to the wavelet ψ is a function of time (τ)
and scale (s), Wx;ψ(τ, s), obtained by projecting x(t) onto the
wavelet family {ψτ,s}:
Wx;ψ(τ, s) =
Z −∞
+∞
x(t)
1
p
|s|
ψ(t − τ
s
)dt
(2)
By analogy with the terminology used in the Fourier case,
the energy components of the signal are given by the square
of the CWT components of the signal and the (local) Wavelet
Power Spectrum (sometimes called Scalogram or Wavelet
Periodogram) is deﬁned as the normalized energy over time
and scales:
Ex(τ, s) = 100
|Wx;ψ(τ, s)|2
P
τ ′
P
s′ |Wx;ψ(τ ′, s′)|2

An example of a scalogram can be observed in Figure 1
(bottom-left).
III. SOCIAL-NETWORKING BEHAVIOR
CHARACTERIZATION
A. Single User Behavior Inference
Within the context of this paper, signal x(t) is a counting
process that quantiﬁes the number of social network interac-
tions (i.e., number of posts, number of likes and number of
posted photos) in a time-interval (e.g., 30 minutes, as used
in section IV) over time. An example of a counting process
(Facebook posts) can be observed in Figure 1 (top-left). In
order to characterize the user multiscale behaviour over time,
it is possible to estimate (i) the Average Activity Energy of
signal x(t), µEx(s), by averaging the normalized energy of
the signal over time for all timescales (see (4)) and (ii) the
Activity Energy Standard Deviation of signal x(t), σEx(s),
by calculating the standard deviation of the normalized energy
of the signal over time for all timescales (see (5)):
µEx(s) = 1

An example of these metrics can be observed in Figure 1, in
the bottom middle and right plots, respectively.

B. User Group Behavior Inference
In order to characterize the behavior of a group of users, it is
necessary to deﬁne metrics that can quantify their behavior as
a group. Assuming a group size of U users and assuming that
xu(t) represents a counting process that describes the activity
of user u in the social network, we can quantify the mean and
variance values of the (i) group average activity energy (see
(6) and (7)) and (ii) group activity energy standard deviation
(see (8) and (9)), for all timescales and users within the group:
µE(s) = 1

IV. RESULTS
The proposed methodology was applied to two different data-
sets. The ﬁrst data-set comprises Facebook posted between
January 1st, 2007 and December 31, 2008 by a group of 160
users, which individually posted more than 300 posts in this
two year time frame. The total number of recorded Facebook
posts is 72893. This 2007-2008 data-set was extracted from
the data presented by Viswanath et al. [16] and is freely
available online. The second data-set was extracted from a
group of Facebook friends of this paper authors using the
Facebook Graph API [17]. Facebook Graph API is a low
level HTTP-based API used to query data from Facebook’s
Social Graph. The data queried using Facebook Graph API is
returned in JSON format and can be easily post-processed in
order to extract its relevant statistics. This data-set contains
all social networking activities of 140 users between January
1st, 2011 and December 31, 2012. Only users with more than
300 interactions with the social network in the two years
time frame were considered. The total number of Facebook
interactions in this data-set are 167171 Facebook posts, 90882
likes and 48755 photo uploads. The second data-set is hereafter
referred as 2011-2012 data-set.
Based on the timestamps of each social network interaction,
time processes were extracted from the data-sets by counting
the number of interactions in 20-minute time intervals. For the
2007-2008 data-set only Facebook posts were considered due
the the limited information of the original data. However, for
the 2011-2012 data-set we considered separately the Facebook
posts, likes and photo uploads.
A. Facebook User Behavior Evolution
We have applied the proposed multiscale user activity char-
acterization to Facebook posts time processes extracted from
both data-sets. The obtained results are depicted in Figure 2.

from 2007-2008 to 2011-2012: (top) average energy activity over time for all
scales and (bottom) standard deviation of energy activity over time for all
scales.
The average energy activity reveals that pseudo-periodicity
with a 24 hours period is predominant for both data-sets.
This fact reveals that humans behave and interact with social
networks in 24 hour cycles, although humans also spread their
pseudo-periodic intervals between activity over a wide range of
timescales. Another fact that can be observed is that nowadays
users tend to have a more spread usage when compared to the
older data-set; this reveals that human users have evolved to
a more frequent Facebook interactivity, so their proﬁles are
not so deeply shaped according to the 24-hour cycle. This
evolution on the characteristics of the human activities is more
visible when analyzing the activity energy standard deviation,
which is much higher on the newer data-set. This also show
that human users have a very variable behavior in terms of
intervals between activities on Facebook.
B. Human and Bot Differentiation
In order to present a proof-of-concept for our methodology as
a social network bot detection tool, we created two different
bots that emulate Facebook posts, likes and photo uploads
according to different behavioral proﬁles, namely, one periodic
bot and one exponential bot. A periodic bot interacts with
Facebook in exact intervals (in this paper, we have considered
a periodicity of 24 hours) and an exponential bot interacts with
Facebook in exponential distributed intervals (in this paper, we
considered an average interval of 24 hours).
We have applied the proposed multiscale user activity
characterization to human users of 2011-2012 data-set and to
the emulated bots. Figures 3, 4 and 5 depict the multiscale
characteristics (with 98% conﬁdence intervals) of human and
bot Facebook users when making posts, likes and uploading
photos, respectively. The results show that the multiscale
behaviors are similar when observing the Facebook posts, likes
and photo uploads. From the obtained results it is also possible

to observe that bots and humans have distinct multiscale
behaviors. Periodic bots have their average activity energy
centered on a 24-hour timescale and have low energy variation.
Exponential bots and human users have a similar average
activity energy distribution over the timescales, however, hu-
man users still have slighter higher energy around the 24-hour
timescale. However, the variation of activity energy over time
is much higher in human users.
The multiscale characteristics of human activities in social
networks have a pseudo-periodicity of 24-hour, however, the
human analysis reveals an inherent chaotic and unpredictable
behavior shown by the much higher variation of activity energy

difﬁcult to emulate by bots and can be used to differentiate
human from bot users within a social network.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, a novel paradigm was proposed to perform the
joint analysis of multiple scales of users’ interactions within a
social network. The presented methodology allows an accurate
discrimination between human and bot behaviors within social
networks. The results obtained reveal that multiscale behavior
signatures can be built for different social network bot classes
and typical human interactions, which will enable the devel-
opment of accurate tools for the detection of social networks
bots.
