Abstract – This paper explores a MAC (Medium Access 
Control) 
layer 
throughput 
with 
DCF 
(Distributed 
Coordination Function) protocol in the IEEE 802.11a/g/n-
based mobile LAN. It is evaluated in Rayleigh fading wireless 
channel, using theoretical analysis method. The DCF  
throughput performance is analyzed by using the number of 
stations with both variable payload size and mobile speed on 
the condition that fading margin and transmission probability 
are fixed. In the IEEE 802.11n, A-MSDU (MAC Service Data 
Unit Aggregation) scheme is considered and number of 
subframe is used as the variable parameter. It is identified that 
MAC efficiency of IEEE 802.11n is the best out of four schemes.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
Over the past few years, mobile networks have emerged as 
a promising approach for future mobile IP applications. 
With limited frequency resources, designing an effective 
MAC protocol is a hot challenge. IEEE 802.11b/g/a/n 
networks are currently the most popular wireless LAN 
products on the market [1]. The conventional IEEE 802.11b 
and 802.11g/a specification provide up to 11 and 54 Mbps 
data rates, respectively. However, the MAC protocol that 
they are based upon is the same and employs a CSMA/CA 
(Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance) 
protocol with binary exponential back-off.  IEEE 802.11 
DCF is the de facto MAC protocol for wireless  LAN 
because of its simplicity and robustness [2]. Therefore, 
considerable research efforts have been put on the 
investigation of the DCF performance over wireless LAN 
[2][3][4]. With the successful deployment of IEEE 
802.11a/b/g wireless LAN and the increasing demand for 
real-time applications over wireless, the IEEE 802.11n 
Working Group standardized a new MAC and Physical 
Layer (PHY) specification to increase the bit rate to be up to 
600 Mbps [5]. The throughput performance at the MAC 
layer can be improved by aggregating several frames before 
transmission [6]. Frame aggregation not only reduces the 
transmission time for preamble and frame headers, but also 
reduces the waiting time during CSMA/CA random backoff 
period for successive frame transmissions. The frame  
 
 
aggregation can be performed within different sub-layers.  
In 802.11n, frame aggregation can be performed either by 
MAC Protocol Data Unit Aggregation (A-MPDU) or MAC 
Service Data Unit Aggregation (A-MSDU). Although frame 
aggregation can increase the throughput at the MAC layer 
under ideal channel conditions, a larger aggregated frame 
will cause each station to wait longer before its next chance 
for channel access. Under error-prone channels, corrupting a 
large aggregated frame may waste a long period of channel 
time and lead to a lower MAC efficiency [6]. On the other 
hand, wireless LAN mobile stations that are defined as the 
stations that access the LAN while in motion are considered 
in this paper [4]. The previous paper analyzed the IEEE 
802.11b/g/n MAC performance for wireless LAN with fixed 
stations, not for wireless LAN with mobile stations 
[2][3][7][8]. On the contrary, Xi Yong [4] and Ha Cheol 
Lee [9] analyzed the MAC performance for IEEE 802.11 
wireless LAN with mobile stations, but considered only 
IEEE 802.11 and 802.11g/a wireless LAN specification. So, 
this paper extends the previous researches and analyzes the 
IEEE 802.11n MAC performance for wireless LAN with 
mobile stations. In other words, we will present the 
analytical evaluation of saturation throughput with bit errors 
appearing in the transmitting channel. IEEE 802.11g/a/n 
PHY and MAC layer focused in this paper are reviewed and 
frame error rate of mobile wireless channel is derived in 
Section 2. The DCF saturation throughput is theoretically 
derived in Section 3 and numerical results are analyzed in 
Section 4. Finally, it is concluded with Section 5. 
 
II.  WIRELESS ACCESS ARCHITECTURE 
 
Fig. 1 shows ad hoc mode operation of wireless access 
architecture in the 802.11a/g/n-based mobile LAN. The 
protocols of the various layers are called the protocol stack. 
The TCP/IP protocol stack consists of five layers: the 
physical, data link, network, transport and application layers. 
802.11 of Fig. 1 means physical layer and data link layer 
which consists of MAC and LLC (Logical Link Control) 
sub-layers. And this paper is focused on physical layer and 
MAC sublayer. An ad hoc network might be formed when 
people with laptops get together and want to exchange data 
in the absence of a centralized AP (Access Point).

A. 802.11a/g PHY/MAC layer 
Fig. 2 shows the 802.11a/g-based physical and MAC layer 
protocol stack and typical frame structure focused in this 
paper. When a higher layer pushes a user packet down to the 
MAC layer as a MAC-SDU (MSDU), the MAC layer 
header (M-HDR) and trailer (FCS) are added before and 
after the MSDU, respectively and form a MAC-PDU 
(MPDU). The PHY (Physical) layer is again divided into a 
PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol) sub-layer and 
a PMD (Physical Medium Dependent) sub-layer. Similarly 
the PLCP preamble and PLCP header (P-HDR) are attached 
to the MPDU at the PLCP sub-layer. Different IFS (Inter 
Frame Space)s are added depending on the type of MPDU. 
IEEE 802.11a operates in the 5 GHz band and uses OFDM 
(Multiple-Input Multiple-Output). The achievable data rates 
are 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. 802.11g uses 
DSSS, OFDM, or both at the 2.4 GHz ISM band to provide 
high data rates of up to 54 Mbps. 802.11g device can 
operate with an 802.11b device. Combined use of both 
DSSS and OFDM is achieved through the provision of four 
different physical layers. The four different physical layers 
defined in the 802.11g standards are ERP-DSSS/CCK, 
ERP-OFDM, ERP-DSSS/PBCC and DSSS-OFDM. The 
standards that support the highest data rate of 54 Mbps are 
ERP-OFDM and DSSS-OFDM. ERP-OFDM is a new 
physical layer in IEEE 802.11g and OFDM is used to 
provide IEEE 802.11a data rates at the 2.4 GHz band. 
DSSS-OFDM is a new physical layer that uses a hybrid 
combination of DSSS and OFDM. The packet physical 
header is transmitted using DSSS, while the packet payload 
is transmitted using OFDM. Fig. 3 shows basic access 
scheme of CSMA/CA mechanism. The SIFS (Short Inter-
Frame Space) and the slot time are determined by the 
physical layer. DIFS (Distributed Inter-Frame Space) is 
defined based on the above two intervals.

B. 802.11n PHY/MAC  layer 
At the MAC layer, 802.11n use  several new MAC, 
including the frame aggregation, block acknowledgement, 
and bi-directional data transmission. There are two ways to 
perform frame aggregation at the MAC layer as shown in 
Fig. 4. The first technique is by concatenating several MAC 
Service Data Units (MSDUs) to form the data payload of a 
large MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU). The PHY header 
and MAC header, along with the frame check sequence 
(FCS), are then appended to form the Physical Service Data 
Unit (PSDU). This technique is known as A-MSDU. The 
second technique is called A-MPDU. It begins with each 
MSDU appending with its own MAC header and FCS to 
form a sub-MPDU. An MPDU delimiter is then inserted 
before each sub-MPDU. Padding bits are also inserted so 
that each sub-MPDU is a multiple of 4 bytes in length, 
which can facilitate subframe delineation at the receiver. 
Then, all the sub-MPDUs are concatenated to form a large 
PSDU. Figure 4 also shows timing of the preamble fields in 
legacy, MF(Mixed Format) and GF (Green Field). At the 
PHY layer, 802.11n will use MIMO  and OFDM 
(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing). It supports 
up to a transmission rate of 600 Mbps and is backward 
compatible with 802.11a/b/g. 802.11n provides support for 
both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands at the same time. 
802.11n defines implicit and explicit transmit beamforming 
(TxBF) methods and space-time block coding (STBC),

which improves link performance over MIMO with basic 
spatial-division multiplexing (SDM). It also defines a new 
optional low density parity check (LDPC) encoding scheme, 
which provides better coding performance over the basic 
convolutional code. The possible timing sequences for A-
MPDU and A-MSDU in the uni-directional transfer case are 
shown in Figure 5. If RTS/CTS (Request To Send/Clear To 
Send) is used, the current transmission sequence of RTS–
DATA (Data frame)–ACK (Acknowledgement) only allows 
the sender to transmit a single data frame. The DATA frame 
represents either an A-MPDU or an A-MSDU frame. The 
system time can be broken down into virtual time slots 
where each slot is the time interval between two consecutive 
countdown of backoff timers by non-transmitting stations. 
The 802.11n also specifies a bi-directional data transfer 
method. In the bi-directional data transfer method, the 
receiver may request a reverse data transmission in the CTS 
control frame. The sender can then grant a certain medium 
time for the receiver on the reverse link. The transmission 
sequence will then become RTS-CTS-DATAf-DATAr-
ACK. This facilitates the  transmission of some small 
feedback packets from the receiver and may also enhance 
the performance of TCP which requires the transmission of 
TCP ACK segments. Block Acknowledgement (BACK) can  
 
 
 
Figure 5.  IEEE 802.11n Uni-directional RTS/CTS Access Scheme 
 
be used to replace the previous ACK frame. The BACK can 
use a bit map to efficiently acknowledge each individual 
sub-frame within the aggregated frame. 
 
C. Frame error rate  
Mobile wireless channel is assumed to be flat fading 
Rayleigh channel with Jake spectrum. The channel is in 
fading states or inter-fading states by evaluating a certain 
threshold value of received signal power level. If and only if 
the whole frame is in inter-fading state, there is the 
successful frame transmission. If any part of frame is in 
fading duration, the frame is received in error. In the fading 
channel fading margin is considered and defined as ρ = 
Rreq/Rrms, Where Rreq is the required received power level 
and Rrms is the mean received power. Generally, the fading 
duration and inter-fading duration can be taken to be 
exponentially distributed for ρ<-10dB. With the above 
assumptions, let  Tpi be the frame duration, then the frame 
error rate is given by (1) [4].

fading margin, maximum Doppler frequency and frame 
duration. Since fading margin and maximum Doppler

III.  DCF THROUGHPUT ANALYSIS 
 
The back-off procedure of the DCF protocol is modeled 
as a discrete-time, two-dimensional Markov chain. Fig. 4 
shows the Bianchi’s Markov chain model for the back-off 
window size [7]. We define 
W = CWmin
. Let m , the 
maximum 
back-off 
stage, 
be 
such 
value 
that

)
(0,...,
m  
of the station at time t . p is the probability that a 
transmission is collided or unsuccessfully executed.  
We will present the analytical evaluation of saturation 
throughput with bit errors appearing in the transmitting 
channel. The number of stations n is assumed to be fixed 
and each station always has packets for transmission. In 
other words, we operate in saturation conditions, the 
transmission queue of each station is assumed to be always 
nonempty.   
Let S  be the normalized system throughput, defined as 
the fraction of time in which the channel is used to 
successfully transmit payload bits. 
tr
P  is the probability that 
there is at least one transmission in the considered slot time.

IV.  NUMERICAL RESULTS 
 
This section evaluated DCF throughput of the IEEE 
802.11a/g-based mobile LAN. The maximum physical 
transmission rate of IEEE 802.11a/g is 54 Mbps and that of  
IEEE 802.11n-based mobile LAN is 600 Mbps. In this 
paper, bandwidth of 20 MHz, long guard interval and MCS 
(modulation and coding scheme) index of 15 for two spatial 
streams are used in Fig. 7. MCS index 15 uses 64-QAM 
modulation scheme and coding rate of 5/6. So, the physical 
transmission rate of 130 Mbps is assumed. Also, both ERP-
OFDM and DSSS-OFDM standard are only used in this 
evaluation for the IEEE 802.11g standard because of 
considering their maximum transmission rate of 54 Mbps 
[14]. Generally, the three common packets passed down to 
the MAC layer are 60 bytes (TCP ACK), 576 bytes (typical 
size for web browsing) and 1,500 bytes (the maximum size 
for Ethernet) in length. In the IEEE 802.11n-based mobile 
LAN, the two common packets are only considered and the 
number of packets aggregated in one MAC frame varies 
from 1 to 80, which leads to an aggregated frame’s payload 
length (
p
L ) from 576 and 1,500 bytes to 46.08 and 120 
Kbytes. In the Fig. 7(a) ~ Fig. 7(c), the symbol S ( P , ρ, ν , 
n , τ ) shows the saturation throughput over error-prone 
channel according to the number of stations ( n ) for 
common packet sizes ( P ) on the condition that packet 
transmission probability ( τ ), mobile velocity (ν ) and 
fading margin (ρ) are fixed. In the Fig. 8(a) and Fig. 8(b), 
the symbol S (
sn , P, ρ, ν , n , τ ) and S (P, 
sn , ρ, ν , n , 
τ ) respectively shows the saturation throughput over error-
prone channel according to the number of stations ( n ) and 
the typical number of packets aggregated in one MAC frame 
(
sn ) for two subframe length on the condition that packet 
transmission probability ( τ ), mobile velocity (ν ) and 
fading margin (ρ) are fixed. For example, in the Fig. 7(a), if 
the number of stations is 7, packet transmission probability 
is 0.05,  packet length is 1,500 and fading margin is 0.01, 
mobile station with the speed of 1.25 m/s can get the 
throughput of 27.238 Mbps, whereas mobile station with the 
speed of 25 m/s can get the throughput of 26.968 Mbps. In 
the Fig. 8(a), if the number of subframe is 30 and the same 
conditions mentioned above are applied, mobile station with 
the speed of 1.25 m/s can get the throughput of 113.511 
Mbps with six stations, whereas mobile station with the 
speed of 25 m/s can get the throughput of 84.607 Mbps. 
Also, Fig. 7(a~c) and Fig. 8(a) show that the longer frame 
(or subframe) length is, the higher throughput is. And, for 
the same frame (or subframe) length, the higher speed is, the 
lower throughput is. As the results of evaluation, we also 
know that there is optimum number of stations to maximize 
saturation throughput under the error-prone channel. 
Specially, in Fig. 8(b), the number of subframes is 
considered and it is identified that there is optimum number 
of subframes to maximize saturation throughput under the 
error-prone channel. In conclusion, we obtained the fact that 
there exist an optimal number of stations (or subframes) to 
maximize the saturation throughput under the error-prone 
channel. Also, we can identify that the larger payload (or 
subpayload) size be, the higher saturation throughput be. 
And if a mobile velocity of station is increased, the 
throughput is decreased a little. Out of the three different 
physical layers defined in this analysis with the maximum 
transmission rate of 54 Mbps, which are 802.11g ERP-
OFDM, 802.11g DSSS-OFDM and 802.11a OFDM, the 
DCF saturation throughput of 802.11a OFDM is the highest.

In the case of 802.11n, because A-MSDU (MAC Service 
Data Unit Aggregation) scheme is applied, it is identified 
that MAC efficiency of IEEE 802.11n is better than any 
other mobile LAN specifications.

V.  CONCLUSIONS 
 
This 
paper 
explored 
the 
saturation 
throughput 
performance of DCF protocol in the IEEE 802.11a/g/n-
based mobile LAN under the error-prone channel. IEEE 
802.11a and IEEE 802.11g have the same maximum 
transmission rate of 54 Mbps, but the DCF saturation 
throughput of 802.11a is higher than that of 802.11g. Of the 
two 802.11g standards, DCF saturation throughput of 
802.11g ERP-OFDM is higher than that of 802.11g DSSS-
OFDM. We are recognizing that a 802.11n-based device can 
operate with a 802.11 legacy devices, but 802.11a-based 
device does not operate with a 802.11b/g-based device. So 
either constructing 802.11a/n-based mobile LAN or 
constructing 802.11g/n-based mobile LAN have to be 
considered for interoperability.
