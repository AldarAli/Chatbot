Abstract. This paper discuses an analysis of the 
characteristics of fingerprint biometric scanners based on 
biometric standards compliance, taking into account of the 
features provided by manufacturers to conduct a comparative 
analysis of their physical characteristics, its certifications and 
standards supported. Because there is a huge fingerprint 
scanners variety, this paper studies only 30 devices from 13 
different vendors using the characteristics obtained from the 
specification sheets for each device. A fingerprint device 
classification was performed based on the number of 
fingerprints that each device can capture, for example 4-4-2 
devices or a single fingerprint capture and type of biometric 
standard compliant. As a result of this devices classification, 
73% of them comply with at least one biometric standard or 
certification and 27% of them do not specify if they meet some 
kind of standard; however, they have the requirements to be 
considered for the acquisition of a fingerprint image. 
Keywords - fingerprint scanners; Biometric Standards; 
physical characteristics. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
A biometric system is an automated system to capture 
biometric sensor data from a user, extract feature data from 
that processed acquired data, compare the processed feature 
data with that contained in one or more biometric templates, 
decide how well they match and indicate whether or not an 
identification or verification of identity has been achieved 
[1][6][8]. 
Biometric systems are used to provide greater security 
for systems that are used as mechanisms for identifying and 
verifying people. Biometric sensors are devices that are 
located within a biometric system, which have the function 
of acquire data or images for biometric feature extraction. 
The biometric technologies designers have the need to 
work with biometric standards that define the characteristics 
and minimum requirements to develop devices and 
appropriate models for the biometric data management for 
public and private entities, law enforcement and government 
areas. 
The fingerprint scanner must produce images that 
exhibit good geometric fidelity, sharpness, detail rendition, 
gray-level uniformity and gray-scale dynamic range, with 
low noise characteristics. The images must be true 
representations of the input fingerprints, without creating 
any significant artifacts, anomalies, false detail, or cosmetic 
image restoration effects [2]. 
According to the International Standard Organization, 
the minimal requirements that a fingerprint scanner must 
meet are: image resolution, size, gray level color range, 
sample rate, light intensity and signal to noise ratio [1]. 
The requirements provide criteria to guarantee the image 
quality of fingerprint scanners and printers that input 
fingerprint images or generate fingerprint images [2]. 
Electronic images must be of sufficient quality to allow for: 
(1) conclusive fingerprint comparisons (identification or 
non-identification decision), (2) fingerprint classification, 
(3) automatic feature detection; and (4) overall Automated 
Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) search reliability 
[8]. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 relates on 
general 
international 
biometric 
standards 
that 
are 
contemplated for realization the analysis. Section 3 refers to 
requirements that were considered for the analysis based in 
international biometric standards. In Section 4, devices that 
are considered for analysis are listed, and, in Section 5, there 
are the results of comparative analysis between the devices 
according to international biometric standards compliant. 
II. 
BIOMETRIC STANDARDS 
The fingerprint scanners, in addition to meeting the 
minimum requirements for use in various applications, 
support different features provided by international 
biometric 
standards 
like 
ISO/IEC 
19794-4, 
and 
ANSI/INCITS 381, this allows to meet interoperability 
between systems [6][7].

International biometric standards that support biometric 
fingerprint scanners are mainly focused on scanner physical 
characteristics, 
data 
transmission 
characteristics, 
management for biometric exchange formats and fingerprint 
image quality. 
Some international biometric standards are described 
below that which are used to define the devices technical 
specification. 
Electronic 
Fingerprint 
Transmission 
Specification 
(EFTS) by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) the 
purpose of this document is to specify certain requirements 
to 
which 
agencies 
must 
adhere 
to 
communicate 
electronically with the FBI’s IAFIS (Integrated Automated 
Fingerprint 
Identification 
System), 
electronic 
communications do not include fingerprints, and the 
requirements [2].  
Personal Identity Verification (PIV) , this specification 
apply to fingerprint capture devices which scan and capture 
at least a single fingerprint in digital, softcopy form [3]. 
 FIPS PUB 201: Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of 
Federal Employees and Contractors, this standard specifies 
the architecture and technical requirements for a common 
identification 
standard 
for 
Federal 
employees 
and 
contractors. The overall goal is to achieve appropriate 
security assurance for multiple applications by efficiently 
verifying the claimed identity of individuals seeking 
physical access to federally controlled government facilities 
and electronic access to government information systems 
[4]. 
BioAPI Specification or 
ISO/IEC 19784-1, this 
specification defines the Application Programming Interface 
(API) and Service Provider Interface (SPI) for standard 
interfaces within a biometric system that support the 
provision of that biometric system using components from 
multiple vendors. It provides interworking between such 
components through adherence to this and to other 
International Standards. The BioAPI specification is 
applicable to a broad range of biometric technology types. It 
is also applicable to a wide variety of biometrically enabled 
applications, from personal devices, through network 
security, to large complex identification systems [5]. 
ISO/IEC 19794-4 and ANSI 381, this  standards 
specifies a data record interchange format for storing, 
recording and transmitting the information from one or 
more finger or palm image areas. There have a section of 
image acquisition requirements are made aware of the 
minimum requirements for selected image acquisition 
settings level desired [6][7]. 
ISO/IEC 19794-2 and ANSI 378, define interoperability 
is based on the definition of the rules or standards of 
minutiae extraction of the finger and the formats of the 
records that are common in many matching procedures. The 
minutiae are points located in a fingerprint image where a 
friction ridge begins, ends or splits into two or more peaks, 
these features can be used to identify a person [8][9]. 
Data Format for the Interchange of Fingerprint, Facial, 
& Other Biometric Information ANSI/NIST-ITL this 
standard defines the content, format, and units of 
measurement for the exchange of fingerprint, palmprint, 
facial/mugshot, scar mark & tattoo (SMT), iris, and other 
biometric sample information that may be used in the 
identification or verification process of a subject. The 
information consists of a variety of mandatory and optional 
items, including scanning parameters, related descriptive 
and record data, digitized fingerprint information, and 
compressed or uncompressed images [10].  
III. 
REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS OF 
FINGERPRINT SCANNERS 
There are requirements that must be considered by 
providers of biometric technologies for the development of 
a fingerprint scanner. 
The fingerprint comparison process requires a high 
fidelity image without any banding, streaking or other visual 
defects. Finer detail such as pores and incipient ridges are 
needed since they can play an important role in the 
comparison. Additionally, the gray-scale dynamic range 
must be captured with sufficient depth to support image 
enhancement and restoration algorithms [8]. 
Binary and grayscale fingerprint images to be exchanged 
shall be captured by an AFIS, live-scan reader, or other 
image capture device operating at a specific native scanning 
resolution. The minimum scanning resolution for this 
capture process shall be 19.69 ppmm plus or minus 0.20 
ppmm (500 ppi plus or minus 5 ppi). Scanning resolutions 
greater than this minimum value and with a device tolerance 
of plus or minus 1% may be used [10].  
Table I shows the preferred capture sizes, applicable to 
live scan systems. Scanner capture dimensions should never 
be less than 90% of those given.

The ISO/IEC 19794-4 sets the standards for the 
acquisition of a fingerprint image by defining the specific 
requirements that must be considered for the data exchange

IV. FINGERPRINT SCANNERS 
The biometric scanners vendors give the technical 
specification datasheet when a fingerprint scanner is sold. 
The main technical specifications are the following: 
resolution, image size, gray level, certifications, and 
standards compliance. 
In some fingerprint scanner specification datasheets 
also give information about the percentage of geometric 
distortion. 
A fingerprint devices classification was performed based 
on the number of fingerprints that each device can capture.  
Tables IV, V and VI show the description of the devices 
that were selected for analysis depending on your fingers the 
number of images that can be acquired in a single capture.

D. General 
 
In the comparative analysis of biometric fingerprint 
scanners, 30 datasheets specification were revised, where 
73% compliance with any international biometric standard 
or have a certification. 
Fig. 3 shows the number of devices that specify 
compliance with at least one biometric standard and the 
number of devices that do not specify. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Devices number that satisfy or not with an international 
biometric standard. 
 
From the 22 scanners that satisfy some certification or 
international biometric standard, the 63.63% devices 
complied with some physical characteristics standards, 
18.18% with any biometric data interchange formats and the 
other 18.18% complied with both. 
 
Fig. 4 shows the number of devices that satisfy   
biometric standard type of that were considered for this 
analysis.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
A comparative analysis was performed in relation to 
standards that meet the data acquisition devices biometric 
fingerprint taking into account the information provided in 
the specification datasheets for each of them. Most devices 
have a certification in relation to physical characteristics. 
Devices that do not present information on compliance 
with standards meet the minimum requirements to be 
considered for the acquisition of a fingerprint image and are 
used in conjunction with software development kits, which 
use or comply with any type of international biometric 
standard for its use in various applications. 
The 
international 
biometric 
standards 
are 
very 
important due they mark the minimum requirements that 
must take into account by devices manufacturers. 
These minimum requirements must also be taken into 
account by people who use the scanner in various biometric 
applications. There are devices that meet the minimum 
requirements for physical characteristics, as well as 
compliance to unveil common structures in the biometric 
data interchange formats for interoperability in biometric 
systems. 
As future work, tests will be done to devices that were 
considered for this analysis to verify compliance with the 
requirements of international biometric standard.
