Abstract—This study presents a solution to enhance the cities’
trafﬁc control by classifying particular vehicles’ behaviors. A
Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach is presented, enabling
the system to classify cars that are looking to park and those
that are simply transiting through a city. Through this paper,
we also propose a new way of managing the high density of
trafﬁc data using a grid. The results show that the system is
able to distinguish the two different behaviors with an accuracy
averaging 80%.

INTRODUCTION
Today’s big cities are getting submerged by the trafﬁc
growth. It started to become critical as the trafﬁc grew and
the cities are now facing problems like trafﬁc congestion
and others, although a desperate try to mitigate them. Thus,
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and research in that
sense, are also getting more attention. Most cities struggle to
counteract such issues due to the lack of ﬂexibility in their
architecture. The use of ITS solutions is therefore helpful
when a city tries to understand the possible bottlenecks or
other particular behaviors observable in its streets. Through
these identiﬁcation capabilities the cities are trying to solve
the problems linked to their architecture.
We based our research on [1] data, which provides the
Global Positioning System (GPS) location of many smart-
phones at a given interval in the city of Aracaju (Brazil).
The dataset is composed of either people simply walking,
taking a bus or a car. Using such location technology has been
motivated by the wide amount of device capable of using it,
considering the growth of the smartphone market.
The following study is oriented towards enriching a city’s
knowledge of its trafﬁc by differentiating the parking patterns
of the transiting patterns by extracting it from the Global
Positioning System’s data of a moving vehicle. The Section III
show details about the dataset and the features that we selected
or created, our system is explained in the Section III-C, its
results and a ﬁnal discussion are presented in Section IV and
Section V respectively.

RELATED WORK
Behavior detection or classiﬁcation is a ﬁeld where many
research projects are trying to respond the best they can, it is
even deﬁned as the ﬁeld having the least research by [2]. In
the agricultural domain, farmers are trying to understand how
their cattle behave during a certain period of time. Therefore,
they use speciﬁc sensors but also couple them with the GPS
information they get [3]- [5].
Researchers identiﬁed that the raw GPS points cannot be
used very efﬁciently. Therefore, information like the speed,
direction or distance was inferred from the GPS records and
the time of the capture [6]. Most of the reviewed papers would
rather focus their models on determining the users’ actual
activity across the time. This means that they were ﬁrst trying
to determine if the participant was moving, if so what the
transportation mode he was using. [7] proposed a system based
on fuzzy logic to identify if a person was walking, taking
some sort of transportation method or simply staying. Their
model is capable of determining the three situations according
to the angle between the points and the speed computed from
it. Based on few features, the model is capable of giving the
probability of the actual segment to pertain to one of the three
sets.
A machine learning approach was used in an article from
[8] which labelled multiple segments of a GPS trace. La-
belled segments were checked for errors using some fuzzy
logic rules, ending in a multi-staged technique to provide the
corresponding label to a segment. The usage of SVM was
helpful in classifying the mode of transportation used, since
the model was capable of identifying four types of vehicle
types (car, bus, train or tram). [9] also proposed a multilayered
classiﬁcation model, composed of a decision tree and a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM). Using their pipeline, they were able to
categorise transportation modes like running, walking, biking,
stationary position and motorised transport (no distinction).
The work from researchers in [10] are exposing different
ways of training an Artiﬁcial Neural Network for pattern
recognition, and the results tend to demonstrate that this
depends on the amount of data available. [11] developed a
neural network, based on a multi-layer perceptron model that is
capable of identifying the mode of transportation used by a per-
son. They offer, through a mobile application called TRACIT,
the capabilities to determine when a trip began and ﬁnished
and how the person travelled in order to enhance surveys’
processes and ease their use. They also note the importance
of certain features in determining the type of transportation,
like the acceleration and the total distance of the trip. The
previously presented systems were beaten by TrajectoryNet, a
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model proposed by [12]. It
was able to classify GPS trajectories in four categories; bike,
car, walk and bus, with the precision of 98% which is beating
at least by 4% the results of [8]. Similarly, [13] presented two
different approaches of managing the raw GPS tracking points.
They used fuzzy logic rules and a random forest model in order
to recognise indoor and in-vehicle travels and mentioned some
problems to determine if a pedestrian was walking or not.
Researchers like [14] also tried to predict potential acci-
dents or trafﬁc congestion based on data inferred from the
GPS location of vehicles. They segmented roads using vari-
ous points along them and then computed different variables
relatively to them. [15] were able to extract and classify three
trafﬁc congestion levels using a Decision Tree algorithm with

a high accuracy. In order to assess highway trafﬁc conditions,
[16] have demonstrated that the SVM and information inferred
from vehicles’ positions could provide results above 75%.

METHODS
A. Data Generation
UCI’s dataset is composed of GPS points series that
describe the movements of people using their mobile phone
GPS antenna. This statement induces that the data had to be
ﬁltered while being labelled. The GPS series were displayed
and labelled visually, meaning that we relied on the actual
position of paths’ segments in order to attribute a speciﬁc
label to them. Going through such process also helped to
identify paths that were done by people walking and not using
a vehicle.
The second step in the process was to create an appropriate
tracks’ dataset. Therefore, we decided to create a grid around
the city center. Each of the cell is covering a parcel of a
hundred meters squared and the total coverage of the city
was ten thousand meters squared. We then computed for each
grid cell the number of unique tracks going through it. This
count helped us understand and ﬁlter the useless parts of the
grid, reducing the total matrix. Tracks were then processed
to produce the dataset which contains four different features.
We decided to keep the track id (which was unique for each
record), the “from win id” which is the origin’s cell id of a
track, the “to win id” which is the destination cell id, and
ﬁnally “delta t” the time delta between the origin to the
destination in seconds. An example of the grid with a path
is given in the Figure 1 and its matching Table I.
All the records were labelled using two different classes:
“transit” meaning the vehicle is transiting through the city and
“parking” identifying a car looking for a parking. A path could
be segmented with both transiting and parking segments. We
additionally created a dataset ﬁltering the paths containing at
least two different classes (“parking” or “transit”).

B. Data Analysis
The dataset generated includes a few features, but to assess
their variance and to ensure a good usage of them during the
training and testing phase we decided to run multiple feature
selection techniques. We ﬁrst tried to understand the variance
ratio of each feature and so understand their importance in the

Analysis (PCA) to get a clear observation of the ratios, as
demonstrated in Figure 2. Obviously, the track id revealed to

be the most important feature, but we will not use it as it may
skew the results by relying too much on this value which may
be dynamic in future usage. Another observation from Figure
2 is that the delta between the cell movement has a lot of same
values, but this is understandable since the vehicles could take
the same time to transit through cells. We further explored
with two types of feature selection techniques, the ﬁlters and
the wrappers. Filters are based upon statistical measure results
and provide a score for each feature, while wrappers are
using machine learning models in order to determine a feature
ranking depending on the score obtained by the classiﬁer using
a particular set of them.
We started with the ﬁlters and therefore selected the
ANOVA-F measure as demonstrated in Figure 3 and the χ2
which is observable through Figure 4.

by the two measures are slightly different, especially looking
at the track id and delta t features which are interpreted
differently. This is due to their speciﬁc characteristics, where

the χ2 is a measure taking more the number of times the same
observations is made between a feature value and the class
and ANOVA-F is scoring features by analysing the variance
of Fisher’s test values.
As for the wrappers, we used a Decision Tree where we
selected the two best features. The model and approach is
based on the scikit-learn python library [17]. Using the model,
we obtained a new histogram for the Decision Tree as shown
in and Figure 5. By omitting the track id feature from Figure

2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5, one can still make the
observation that the origin cell is determinant in the dataset
generated.
C. Model Selection
We ran the whole dataset in a pipeline composed of
multiple classiﬁers. We dedicated 70% of the dataset to be
the training set and used it to make a 5-fold cross-validation.
Results of the classiﬁcations were then compared as in Figure
6. We observed the standard deviation of the results and the
accuracy for each classiﬁer and came to the conclusion that
the SVM was the promising model to use.
We decided to further explore the SVM classiﬁer and made
the ﬁne-tuning of its hyper-parameters using a grid searching
approach. The algorithm was given four different parameters
range conﬁgurations and used a 3-fold cross-validation. The
best scores were obtained using the following parameters:
•
Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF)
•
C: 1.0
•
Tolerance: 0.001

RESULTS
We ran each dataset through the feature selection tech-
niques described earlier and compared the results. At each

deviation.
step, the resulting dataset containing only the selected features
were used to classify the 30% test set that has never been used
during the previous steps.
By comparing the two confusion matrices in Figure 7a and
Figure 7b resulting from the classiﬁcation using the whole set
of features, we observed that the ﬁltered paths’ classiﬁcation
was harder. The model is providing 3.56% of false positive for
the transit class while for the whole dataset it represented only
0.06%. We observed an inverted tendency on the false positives
of the parking class with this error representing 16.35% and
13.91% respectively for the non-ﬁltered and the ﬁltered dataset.
This is certainly due to an unbalance between the number of
transit records and the parking ones.
By running the results of each feature selection subsets we
observed that the best-performing one was the whole dataset.
This is demonstrated by Table II, which summarizes different
scores of three different measures. Reducing the features did
not enhance the results, even if the results are still good. As
the paths were entirely present in either the training or testing
set, using all the features was not skewing the algorithm. The
results also demonstrate that our model is capable of providing
a classiﬁcation precision of 86%.

CONCLUSION
To conclude our study, we demonstrated a new approach
attempting to answer the problematic linked to one of the
least researched domains in Intelligent Transportation Sys-
tems. We were able to obtain signiﬁcantly good results in
detecting whether a car was looking for a parking place or
simply transiting through the city. We compared results of
many different subsets, using techniques normally used for
dimensionality reduction. Unfortunately, these subsets did not
provide better results, but at least we identiﬁed that a key factor
in the decision-making was the origin of the vehicle, if we
ignore the path’s id.
Results might even be further enhanced by a better an-
notation technique, and a better data collection quality as the

UCI dataset was based on people’s smartphone location system
and not directly from cars. This will be the subject of a future
work as this study is part of an HES-SO directed project named
Mobicam, speciﬁcally meant to solve the data collection and
data treatment problematic.
Further work could also investigate more classes for be-
haviors like stopping to get somebody, waiting for somebody
or trafﬁc congestion.
