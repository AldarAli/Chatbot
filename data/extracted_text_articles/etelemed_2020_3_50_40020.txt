Abstract—Despite
developing
several
successful
mHealth
interventions, researchers have struggled with implementation
in practice. Key stakeholders in New Zealand were interviewed
for their perspectives on barriers and enablers. Their feedback
was
mapped
to
the
Consolidated
Framework
for
Implementation Research (CFIR), and, from there, to the
Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC)
framework. In this way, twenty recommended implementation
strategies were identified. Some of these may be beyond the
ability of researchers to influence, however, many can be
employed during the development and research phases and
may increase the likelihood of translation into real world
implementation.
Keywords-mHealth; implementation.
I.
INTRODUCTION
mHealth
describes
health
interventions
and
health
information that is provided to people using their mobile
phones. Although the mHealth field is progressing at a rapid
pace, there continues to be a lack of significant large-scale
implementations.
There have been various studies regarding the success or
failure of implementing mHealth innovations in practice.
Often, barriers to implementation concern the structural and
cultural aspects of the system rather than the intervention or
technology itself [1]. In fact, a WHO study from 2011 found
that competing priorities in an overworked health system
were the main barrier to implementing mHealth, followed
by a lack of knowledge about its applications, a need for
policy that recognises mHealth as a legitimate approach for
addressing health, and cost-effectiveness [2]. Other studies
of barriers have included usability of the intervention,
integration of the tool into existing systems, data security
and privacy, resistance to change, and a lack of planning,
funding, capacity, training, and support [3]-[6].
We
set
out
to
examine
the
perspectives
of
key
stakeholders in New Zealand to the enablers and barriers
impacting mHealth implementation. Our group (the National
Institute for Health Innovation (NIHI) at the University of
Auckland) has developed many mHealth programmes. Some
were successful in large randomised controlled trials [7]-
[11], or pilots [12][13], and some were not proven effective
in the research phase [14][15]. One was developed as an
ongoing service rather than out of a research project [16]. To
date, only one programme has successfully moved from
proven research evidence to implementation [7][8], being
run for many years as a national smoking cessation service
and
stimulating
many
other
such
cessation
services
internationally
[17].
Considering
other
successful
programmes
languishing
between
publication
and
implementation, we wished to learn if there was more that
we could do to prepare our planned future research
developments for eventual implementation. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to obtain input from decision
makers in the health sector to inform our current and future
mHealth research programmes for greater translation into
practice.
This paper describes our original research with Section II
outlining the methods used, Section III describing the key
findings from interviews and the results of our mapping to
constructs and implementation strategies, and in Section IV
we discuss how we could use these strategies and our next
steps.
II.
METHODS
Key
senior
stakeholders
in
New
Zealand
were
interviewed as part of several ongoing mobile health
development and implementation projects being conducted
by
NIHI
at
the
University
of
Auckland.
These
ten
stakeholders covered the spectrum from the Ministry of
Health to local funding organisations, primary health care
organisations, a University, and an academic/industry/health
service research partnership. Their roles included funding,
contracting, health service improvement, clinical leadership,
research and innovation. Stakeholders were identified by the
lead mHealth researcher (RW) as key people familiar with
the implementation of previous, existing or planned NIHI
mHealth programmes. These programmes focus on various
health topics such as smoking cessation, diabetes self-
management support, cardiac rehabilitation and pulmonary
rehabilitation.
Potential
interviewees
were
asked
to
participate by the lead mHealth researcher. All those
approached consented and were interviewed.
Interviewees were asked about their role in mHealth
implementation and both barriers and enablers that they
have faced in the past or would anticipate for future
projects.
Semi-structured
interview
guidelines
were
developed by the entire team. All interviews were conducted
by an independent student (LF) during an international
internship at NIHI. The interviewer also conducted all

analyses independently of the researchers at NIHI. Interview
notes were summarised and main ideas were identified and
mapped.
As this study was focused on enablers and barriers, the
Consolidated
Framework
for
Implementation
Research
(CFIR), developed by Damschroder et al. [18], was chosen
as
a
means
to
frame
interview
responses
and
recommendations. This model provides a comprehensive
structure for identifying what has/has not worked in the past
and what might work/not work in future mHealth projects. It
brings together the various existing implementation theories
and key constructs. The goal of the CFIR is to look at the
context of an intervention and assess possible barriers and
enablers to its implementation. CFIR consists of five
domains, and a total of 39 specific constructs within these:

The intervention domain comprises the flexibility,
complexity, adaptability, and other characteristics
of the intervention itself.

The inner setting involves organisational elements
such as culture, structure, leadership, and readiness
for change.

The outer setting involves the economic, social,
and political context of the organisation. The outer
setting also includes patient needs.

The individual level looks at choice and behaviour
of those involved in the implementation and is
driven by their personalities, mind-sets, and so on.

The process level examines the actual change
process surrounding the intervention—this includes
engagement,
planning,
executing,
and
reflecting/evaluating.
The
Expert
Recommendations
for
Implementing
Change (ERIC) framework developed by Powell et al. [19]
proposes 73 different implementation strategies that can be
used
in
isolation
or
conjunction.
These
have
been
categorised under nine domain headings by Waltz et al.
[20]:

Use evaluative and iterative strategies

Provide interactive assistance

Adapt and tailor to context

Develop stakeholder interrelationships

Train and educate stakeholders

Support clinicians

Engage consumers

Utilise financial strategies

Change infrastructure
These strategies were then mapped to the CFIR (framed
as
barriers
to
implementation)
based
on
respondents
choosing the most appropriate ones for each construct [18].
A matching tool is available at [21].

RESULTS
All of the interviewees were enthusiastic about the
potential for mHealth to positively impact health outcomes.
However, interviewees indicated that despite evidence of
positive health outcomes, there is a lack of funds and other
resources in the system to implement and maintain the use
of these tools. There was a general tone of frustration
around inertia and a feeling that tools that are shown to be
effective in supporting and improving patient wellbeing
cannot get implemented.
Overall the tone was pessimistic, with a general feeling
that
systemic
changes
were
needed
to
successfully
implement mHealth and that these changes were a long way
off. While technology advances, the challenges of its
implementation remain constant.
The most popular responses were:

Tools/interventions are often viewed as additive, rather
than substitutive, and therefore compete with other
demands and priorities

There is difficulty working across health service
organisations (eg. primary and secondary care) to
implement interventions - in terms of competing
priorities, disconnect in data and information, many
different stakeholders, and varying structures

It is incredibly important to manage relationships
between clinical and management staff and ensure
clinical engagement with the intervention

The innovation and its impact should be aligned with
wider organisational (and national) strategies, goals,
and
priorities—however,
this
can
be
difficult
as
priorities change

It is difficult to integrate a new technology into current
processes where old legacy systems exist and there is a
lack
of interoperability across
units,
departments,
hospitals, and organisations

There is a general culture of risk aversion that is
resistant to change

Using intensive on-site training, ongoing support, and
multi-disciplinary teams to plan and implement the tool
is helpful

Having consumer champions in addition to clinical
champions is important

Funding needs to be committed and secured early so
that work can continue after a successful pilot finishes –
agree outcomes to be demonstrated to release funds
Key points brought up by interviewees were categorised
as either enablers or barriers and mapped to the specific
CFIR constructs (Table I). This shows that planning,
engaging,
networks
and communications, and
external
policies and incentives were the most commonly cited CFIR
constructs.

CONCLUSION
Our key stakeholders believe in the potential for mhealth
to have positive impacts on helping our patients, however,
they feel these programmes are unlikely to be implemented
due to lack of funds and other resources to implement and
maintain the use of these tools. Our findings are not
dissimilar to those previously identified - lack of policy or
national standards around the provision of mHealth, a need
for compatibility with current work systems and processes,
and insufficient resources and funding [22].
We
mapped
identified
enablers
and
barriers
to
implementation framework constructs and, from there, to
recommended implementation strategies. These fall into
three groups. First are those strategies that are outside our
control, such as altering incentive structures to promote
adoption and implementation, and organising clinician
implementation
team
meetings.
Developing
a
formal
implementation blueprint is something that we could
perhaps conduct with a willing implementing organization,
but in our experience is unlikely to be supported until there
is actually approved funding for an implementation.
Second is the group of strategies that NIHI already uses
in the development and research phases of our mHealth
programmes [23]. From the start we try to involve clinical
champions, advisory boards and workgroups, and build a
coalition of relevant local organisations. In this way we
build on local knowledge and networks and tailor for local
needs. We work with the target audience in focus groups,
surveys and other formative research methods to determine
their needs, whether an mHealth initiative could be helpful,
and their preferred tools. Recruitment methods are tailored
according to
how we think the programme
will be
implemented locally.
The third group of identified strategies included areas that
NIHI could focus more on in our current and future mHealth
developments. Our existing methods tend to focus on
particular levels in the system – that is, the consumers/end
users, clinicians, champions and local services – but not at
the executive board or funder level. We could spend more
time engaging at this higher level, assessing readiness and
identifying barriers and facilitators upfront. This could have
a greater focus on the longer term implementation strategy
to fit with national and regional priorities and programmes,
and therefore increase the likelihood of committing funding.
This may also align with the He Pikinga Waiora
Implementation Framework developed in New Zealand that
has indigenous self-determination at its core [24]. Under
four
over-arching
elements
(cultural
centredness,
community engagement, systems thinking and integrated
knowledge translation) seven components can be scored as
high/medium/low/negative in order to assess the likely
effectiveness of proposed interventions. One of these
components includes the degree to which different levels of
change (macro, meso and micro) are taken into account,
with rationale and context for each level.
The next step will be to deliberately consider the
identified strategies and how they apply at each of these
levels, in the early stages of our mHealth programme
development in New Zealand, and to evaluate whether these
strategies have an impact on implementation.
