Abstract—Body information is needed in product design, 
medical, archaeological, forensic and many other disciplines. 
Therefore, anthropometric studies and databases have been 
developed. Anthropometric measures are useful to some extent, 
but due to technological innovations, there is a shift toward 
surface anatomy. As a result, there is a need to shift from linear 
anthropometry tables to surface model databases. This study 
provides a general modelling technique, to convert linear 
anthropometry to complex surface model using recursive 
regression equations technique (RRET) and scaling technique. 
The technique makes use of similarities and differences 
between people. The similarities or standard shape are 
represented by averaging, while the differences are captured 
by using anthropometric measures. In order to build the 
surface model, some scanned data is needed for generating the 
standard shape. Using RRET techniques a few anthropometric 
measures are used to predict more anthropometric measures 
that are then used to scale the standard shape in order to 
generate a predicted 3D shape. Results indicate that the 
prediction model is accurate to few millimeters. This level of 
error is acceptable in different applications. This technique can 
be applied to generate 3D shape from anthropometry of 
external shape as well as internal organs. This model is 
essential to convert the existing large scale anthropometric 
databases into surface models. It can be applied to product 
design, sizing and grading, reconstructive surgery, forensic, 
anthropology and other fields.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Shape modelling from linear anthropometry is a new 
field of study with important applications [1]. It takes 
advantages of anthropometry, is an old field of study dating 
back to Renaissance [1,2] and merging it with new 
technologies to create human shape models. Luximon and 
Chao [1] proposed a basic model for shape modelling from 
linear anthropometry. This paper expands the previous paper 
to including validation of the model on foot model. 
Anthropometry emerged in the nineteenth century largely 
by German investigators in the physical anthropology 
discipline, while they needed to study the quantitative 
description of the human body reliably [3,4]. Anthropometry 
techniques can be applied to humans as well as plants and 
animal. According to the World Health Organization [5], 
Anthropometry is a method to assess size proportion and 
composition of the human body. Some of anthropometric 
measures include weight, lengths (e.g., foot length), widths 
(e.g., Head width), heights (e.g., Stature), girths (e.g., Chest 
Girth), angles (e.g., hand flexion angle), and calculated 
indexes (e.g., Body mass Index (BMI)). Anthropometric 
studies are carried out internationally because it requires 
inexpensive, non-invasive simple tools such as rulers, tapes, 
callipers and goniometers. These tools can be easily 
transported to any location. World Health Organization [5], 
uses anthropometric measures to assess medical conditions 
of people by comparing with average values. 
The basic anthropometric techniques developed during 
the nineteenth century are still used today [3]. The different 
anthropometric measures are represented in percentile values 
in anthropometric tables [2,6] and since the values are 
statistical values, they cannot be combined to create a single 
human body [7]. The anthropometric percentage values are 
generally used to compare different populations and to 
design for a given population. Anthropometric data has been 
widely used in fields ranging from engineering to arts.  It has 
been widely used in product and workplace design [7,8]to 
determine sizing, grading, proper fit and comfortable design 
based on different body sizes and proportions. It has been 
used in forensic investigation [9,10] for better estimation and 
narrow down the forensic search. It has been used in growth 
and nutrition evaluation [5,11] worldwide to check 
malnutrition, proper growth and early detection of growth 
and nutrition problems. It has been used in medicine [12-14] 
and 
reconstructive 
surgery 
for 
screening 
problem, 
evaluations and corrections.  It has been used in archaeology 
and 
cultural 
studies 
[15-17] 
to 
identification 
and 
classification. It has been used in many other studies 
including sports science and fitness evaluation [18-20], since 
the body proportion and composition is different for different 
sports.  
Even now, anthropometric studies are carried out because 
of its non-invasiveness [5], inexpensiveness [4], simplicity 
[5], portability [21] and reliability [22]. Furthermore, as the 
anthropometric dimensions vary among different groups of 
population, anthropometric tables have been developed 
based 
on 
age, race, region, 
and 
occupation 
[5]. 
Anthropometric studies are very important; however, in 
many applications, anthropometric data alone is not 
sufficient. Surface geometry is required. Recently, due to 

214
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 6 no 3 & 4, year 2013, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

technological innovations, it is possible to acquire whole 
body or selected body parts surface data.   
Surface model describe the size and shape as well as the 
3D surface geometry of the human body [23]. It is possible 
to combine surface scan data and internal measurements 
[24], thus anthropometric techniques can be used to find the 
size, shape and proportion of the external as well as internal 
structures of the body.  Thus in this modern world, data 
collected from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), 
Computed 
Tomography 
(CT) 
or 
Computed 
Aided 
Tomography (CAT), sound, optical (laser or structured light) 
or any scanning devices can be used to create surface model 
of the external as well as the internal structures of the body. 
Since surface model provides information on the complex 
surfaces of the human parts, in addition to the common linear 
anthropometry measures, it can be used for many 
applications such as planning and assessment of facial 
surgery, design and manufacture of implants and prostheses, 
facial reconstruction in forensic applications, archaeology, 
psychology, genetics, and comparative and evolutionary 
anatomy [25]. In addition, there are growing uses of 
synthesize 3D digital animated images of human models in 
science fiction movies and 3D digital dummies for 
equipment testing [26]. Although surface model seems to be 
very useful, it has several disadvantages. Surface scanning 
equipment is relatively expensive and is not widely 
available. It is relatively difficult to operate and require 
special skilled technicians to capture the dynamic and 
complex body shape. Furthermore, the data obtained from 
the scanning equipment requires additional processing and 
statistical data analyses are not trivial resulting in only few 
large-scale studies. Still, surface model is very useful for 
different applications and there is a need to simplify the 
method to acquire surface model, reduce the cost of 
equipments and develop surface model databases. In this 
study, a method to predict accurately the surface model by 
using simple, reliable and non-invasive linear anthropometry 
measurement techniques are proposed. As a result, the use of 
expensive surface scanning devices is minimized to model 
building and simple cost effective linear anthropometry 
measures can be used for surface model prediction. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The basic technique for 3D Surface (Surface model) 
prediction is to determine the similarities and then modify 
based on differences (Figure 1). For example, although we 
know there are variations in shape and sizes of face, we can 
easily know a human face from other body parts or other 
animals. There are similarities between faces. The 
similarities can be grouped based on age, gender, and 
culture. The differences are related to some dimensions 
which can be captured based on anthropometric studies. 
Surface model prediction involves spline curve and surface 
fitting [27], recursive regression equations [28,29] and 
scaling techniques [28]. In this study, a general prediction 
model with several variations is provided so that more body 
parts can be predicted using this simple method. Then, an 
example related to foot prediction is discussed. The main 
parts are data pre-processing and standard shape generation; 
model 
development; 
surface 
model 
prediction; and 
prediction model validation.

The paper is organization in five major sections in order 
to 
develop 
a 
general 
surface 
model 
from linear 
anthropometry. These include data pre-processing; standard 
shape generation; model development; surface model 
prediction; and validation. During the model building a 
generic model method is used that can be applied to all body 
parts. For the validation, an accurate foot shape model 
prediction has been developed and error calculated. The 
conclusion and future work provide the importance of this 
method and its future application are further emphasized.  
III. 
DATA PRE-PROCESSING 
Most scanning technologies have error resulting in 
missing data or noisy data points. The flow chart for data 
preprocessing is shown in Figure 2. The steps involve 
surface data acquisition. Then the data is ‘cleaned’. Human 
body shape has variations hence, there is a need for careful 
alignment of the data. The cleaned and alignment data 
provide a representation of the body shape, which may be 
affected by accuracy of scanning system, but in this study 
this data is considered the ‘true’ shape.  
 
A. 3D scanning  
For 3D scanning, any type of scanner to capture the 
external shape of the body or any specific part can be used. 
Figure 3 shows a whole body scanner at the Hong Kong 
polytechnic university. There are also specific scanners for 
head [29] and foot [28], since the whole body scanner does 
not provide accurate data for these extremities (Figure 4). 
Since a general method to build the prediction model has 
been proposed, some changes may be required to adopt for 
specific parts. It is assumed that Ns number of participants is 
used for the model development. In this formulation, left and 
right sides of the parts are not distinguished, but during the 

215

formation of a specific part, the differences between left and 
right sides can be included as in Luximon and Goonetilleke 
[29]. For the ith participant the scanned part has Psi number of 
points. The points are pik (where i = 1,...,Ns; k = 1,..., Psi). The 
coordinates of the point pik is (xik, yik, zik). The point cloud 
from the scanner is unstructured and includes hundreds of 
thousands of data points.

B. Data cleaning 
Since scanning is usually disturbed by noises arising 
from various sources, the noise can be cleaned manually 
using software such as Rapidform (www.rapidform.com) or 
using algorithm methods such as Adaptive Moving Least 
Squares method [30]. Furthermore, there are cases of 
missing data that are filled using commercial software 
Rapidform2006 software. The points after data cleaning is 
represented by pik (where i = 1,...,Ns; k= 1,...,Pi). Pi is the 
number of points. 
 
C. Alignment  
Since all the scanned part might not be aligned in the 
same reference axis, all the parts have to be aligned on a 
consistent axis. The axis of alignment can be based on some 
anthropometric landmarks, commonly used axis or based on 
mathematical and statistical methods (such as principle 
component methods). For example, for the case of the human 
foot, heel centre line is commonly used [31]. For the arm, leg 
and body principal component can be used. For head data, 
eye and ear landmarks can be used for alignment [32]. After 
alignment, the coordinates of point apik is (axik,ayik,azik) as 
shown in Figure 5. The part is aligned to have the axis with 
the highest variation along the Z-axis.

STANDARD SHAPE GENERATION 
In order to generate the standard shape, first the scanned 
data that has been cleaned and aligned (‘true’ shape) is 
sectioned and sampled (Figure 6). Sampling creates same 
number of points for all participants. The participants’ data 
are then averaged to create a standard shape.  
 
 
Figure 6.  Flow chart to create standard shape. 
 
A. Sectioning and sampling 
During sampling fixed number of points is created for all 
participants. Different sampling methods can be used. When 
using cylindrical coordinate system, the part can be sectioned 
along the Z-Axis, which represents the maximum variation 
(Figure 7).  
 
 
Figure 7.  Sectioning and sampling in cylindrical coordinate system. 
 
Figure 8.  Sectioning and sampling in spherical coordinate system. 
Cylindrical coordinate system can be used for most body 
parts. Once the part has been aligned, cross sections are 
extracted perpendicular to the Z-axis, called the ‘main’ axis. 
The length of the aligned part along the main axis is Li 
(where i = 1,...,Ns). Cross-sections perpendicular to the main

axis at δj (where j = 1,...,Nsec) of Li are extracted, where Nsec 
is the total number of cross-sections extracted (Figure 7). δj 
is monotonically increasing with j. The separation between 
the sampled cross sections needs not be uniform, but it has to 
be consistent between the different participants. The 
extracted sections are Sij(where i = 1,..., Ns; j = 1,...,Nsec) and 
the z-value for the sections are given by Equation (1). Then, 
for each section, a fixed number of points are extracted using 
different sampling methods [30]. When using spherical 
coordinate system, the shape can be sectioned based on angle 
 (Figure 8). Spherical coordinate system is more 
appropriate for the head and face model [32].  
Once the shape has been sectioned either using 
cylindrical coordinate system or spherical coordinate system, 
data points are extracted from the sections. Uniform polar 
sampling at β degrees intervals (Figure 9) and uniform 
sampling at δ mm along the edge (Figure 10) are common 
methods. The number of points for section Sij is sNj. For 
participant i, the number of points is same. The points after 
sampling are spijk ,where i = 1,..., Ns; j = 1,...,Nsec; j= 1,...,sNj.  
 
szij  =δj *Li

B. Standard shape 
Some of the part shape data can be used to generate the 
model, while other shape data can be used for model 
validation. Assuming that the standardmodel is generated 
using part shape data of Nm subjects where Nm<Ns. The 
coordinates of the point used to generate the standard part 
are (sxijk, syijk, syijk) where where i = 1,...,Nm; j= 1,...,Nsec; j= 
1,..., sNj. The standard shape is the representation of the 
given part for a given population. There can be several 
methods to generate the standard shape, based on different 
statistical methods such as geometric mean, arithmetic 
mean, mode, median etc. Equations (2), (3), and (4) show 
the x, y, and z coordinates of the standard shape when 
arithmetic mean is used. The standard foot shape has Nsec 
number of sections. The standard shape represents the shape 
of a given population and it can be stored in a database.

MODEL DEVELOPMENT 
While the standard shape is being developed, parameters 
of each section can be extracted from the cross sections of 
the sampled shape. The flow chart for the RRET model 
development is shown in Figure 11. The number of 
parameters per section will determine the accuracy of the 
model. Parameters for a section can be length and widths. 
Then regression equations are developed to generate 
equation between parameter of one section to another 
section.

Since there are many equations between the parameters, 
if we know the value of one parameter we will be able to 
predict the value of other parameters. Hence there is a need 
to determine the best starting parameter or ‘seed’ parameter. 
A. Parametization 
Each cross section can be parameterized using several 
anthropometric variables. Figure 12 shows some of the 
parameters that can be used, such as maximum y 
deviation(H+), minimum y deviation(H-), maximum x 
deviation(W+), minimum x deviation(W-), height (H), width 
(W) and radius (Rθ) at θ degrees and circumference (C). The 
number of parameterization will determine the accuracy and 
complexity of the model. Furthermore, anthropometric 
studies are needed to determine the importance of the 
different parameters. Goonetilleke et al. [33] and Luximon 
and Goonetilleke [34] have used principle component and 
factor analysis to find the relative importance of different 
foot related parameters. 
 
Figure 12.  Anthropometric parametization. 
B. Recursive regression equation 
The purpose of the recursive regression equation is to 
find the relationship of the anthropometric dimensions of all 
the sections of the part given the anthropometric dimension 
of one section. For example, one regression equation is build 
from anthropometric measure height (H) at section i and 
height at section j. The R2 values are also recorded. If we 
have Na anthropometric measures and Nsec sections, we can 
generate Na x (Nsec- 1) equations if we consider consecutive 
sections. Using these regressions equations, knowledge of 
one set of values for Na anthropometric measures (‘seed 
section), we will be able to predict all the Na x Nsec 
anthropometric measure values.  
 
C. ‘Seed’ section 
There are some ways to find the best ‘seed’ section and 
build the regression equations. Luximon and Goonetilleke 
[29] developed linear regression equations between the 
anthropometric measures of adjacent sections. The best 
‘seed’ section was found by using different ‘seed’ section to 
predict the anthropometric measures and choosing section 
that provided the highest correlation between the original set 
of anthropometric measures. For complex models Na x (Nsec -
1) x (Nsec -2) equations may be needed. This problem can be 
solved using travelling salesman method [34]. The salesman 
need to travel between cities (1,2,…,8). The traveling 
distance between each city is given. The salesman needs to 
travel all the cities without repetition and take the least 
distance. In the case of the proposed method, the distance 
can be substituted by 1/R2.  
 
VI. 
SURFACE MODEL PREDICTION 
Using few anthropometric measures, the parameters of 
the seed section is predicted. The flow chart for shape 
prediction is shown in Figure 13. Using the parameter values 
of the seed section and the linear regression equations 
between the parameter of the sections, the parameter values 
of all the sections are predicted recursively. The predicted 
parameter values are used to scale the sections of the 
standard shape creating a predicted shape.

Figure 14.  Scaling. 
The model can be validated using 3D scanned data of a 
different set of Nv participants where Nv<Ns and Nv+ Nm= Ns. 
The model validation involves measurement or extraction of 
parameters of the ‘seed’ section, prediction of parameters of 
all the section based on the ‘seed’ section, scaling of the 
standard shape. Once the shape is predicted, the prediction 
error can be calculated when we compare it with the original 
data. Once we have the predicted parameters of the sections, 
the standard shape has to be scaled. There can be different 
scaling methods based on the different parameters. Luximon 
and Goonetilleke [29] have discussed proportional scaling. 
If the parameters are orthogonal (such as width and height) 
then the sections can be scaled independently (Figure 14). 
However, if the parameters are not orthogonal different 
scaling methods need to be developed. After scaling, the 
predicted shape has coordinates (pxijk, pyijk, pzijk) where i = 
1,...,Nv; j= 1,..., Nsec; k= 1,...,sNj. 
 
VII. 
PREDICTION MODEL VALIDATION 
The flow chart for the validation of the predicted model 
is shown in Figure 15. The main component is the 
comparison of the ‘true’ shape with the predicted shape. For 
participant i the original shape after alignment has 
coordinates (axik,ayik,azik), where i = 1,...,Nv; k= 1,...,Pi. The 
coordinates of the predicted foot is (pxijk, pyijk, pzijk) where i = 
1,...,Nv; j= 1,..., Nsec; k= 1,...,sNj.The error is computed based 
on the shortest distance [Equation (5)] from the predicted 
foot to the real foot [35]. The error can have signed (+ or -) 
to indicate either the predicted point is inside or outside the 
original shape. Different statistics can easily be calculated to 
compare prediction accuracy. Error plots are also useful to 
show the error distribution at different regions [29].

VIII. FOOT SHAPE MODELING 
The accuracy of the RRET technique is illustrated by 
using foot modeling as an example. The data was collected 
using a foot scanner (Figure 16) shows the scanned foot data. 
Pi is about 100,000 points. The sampled foot is shown in 
Figure 17. The foot is sectioned at 1% interval creating 99 
sections. The extracted sections for participant i are Sij 
(where j = 1,...,99). For each section points are sampled at 
1degree interval based on polar coordinate sampling. The 
points after sampling are spijk , where j = 1,...,99; j= 1,..., 360.  
Using data from 40 participants, a standard foot shape 
was created (Figure 18). The average age of the participants 
used for generating the standard shape was 22 years 
(standard deviation = 3.6). The average weight was 62.8 Kg 
(standard deviation = 8.5). The average stature was 171 cm 
(standard deviation = 5.5). The average foot length was 
245mm (standard deviation = 11mm). The average foot 
width was 99 mm (standard deviation = 5mm).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Linear anthropometrics have existed for centuries and it 
is relatively very easy to measure linear anthropometric 
dimensions. Linear anthropometric is widely available based 
on age, race, region, and occupation and methods to capture 
linear anthropometry are non-invasive, inexpensive, simple, 
portable and reliable. For instance, if we want to buy 
custom-made shoes through the internet, it is much easier to 
provide a set of anthropometric measures (such as length, 
width, height, heel width). 
Anthropometric measures have been widely used, but 
recently, there is a shift from linear anthropometric 
measures to surface anthropometric data in order to satisfy 
the ever-changing needs of the society. Anthropometry may 
be useful for sizing and selecting product, but in the design 
phase 3D shape information is required. For example, it is 
difficult to design shoes with only few measures.  People are 
constantly looking for comfortable and ‘proper’ fitting 
wearable that not only match the linear anthropometric 
dimensions but also accommodate the complex surface of 
the body. In addition, more surface information is needed in 
medical, archaeological and forensic disciplines. As a result, 
the linear anthropometric table even though useful is not 
able to satisfy with the current demands. Thus, in order to 
have accurate information on body dimensions, surface 
model database has to be developed. Hence, many types of 
equipment (e.g., 3D scanners) to capture surface model have 
been developed. 
In one side we have low cost traditional anthropometric 
measures and the other side we have accurate but expensive 
3D scanners. Both of them are use full in some applications.  
The general method is to acquire anthropometric measures 
from surface scan data. This implies that existing huge 
database on anthropometric measures are not well utilized. 
In this study, a general model was proposed to generate 
surface model from linear anthropometry and standard 
shape. The standard shape can be stored in database based 
on age, sex, race, gender, etc. Simple recursive regression 
equations technique and scaling technique were used to 
build the prediction model. Model building involved data 
collection, alignment, cross sectioning, point sampling, 
averaging and regression equations development. Once the 
model has been built, given a few anthropometric measures, 
the standard shape can be scaled to generate a predicted 3D 
shape. Studies in foot modelling have shown that this 
method can predict the foot shape accurately using only 4 
parameters including length, width, height and curvature. 
The accuracy of the predicted shape will generally be higher 
if more anthropometric measures are used. The model 
parameters can be adjusted to obtain the required accuracy 
depending on different applications. The application of this 
study is reconstructive surgery, forensic, anthropology, 
design, psychology, and other fields involving digital human 
models.  
Further studies include making use of the most common 
anthropometric measures to create whole surface model; 
accurate model for specific parts; sensitivity analysis on the
