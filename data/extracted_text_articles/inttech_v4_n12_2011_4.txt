Abstract — Wireless Local Area Networks are important and 
necessary in university campuses and large enterprise areas. 
Such networks allow us to have data connection anywhere 
without wires and many other benefits such as to obtain the 
location of the users. Moreover, they can be used to track the 
users. Tracking the user’s mobility we can know which places 
are most visited, if people have to go to places that are far from 
their office, detect the best location for emergency points, etc. 
Moreover, we can study the mobility pattern of several users. 
According to this pattern, the network can use reconfiguration 
systems to reallocate resources and improve its connectivity. 
This paper shows us the case study of a university campus of 
two square kilometers and how we have taken advantage of the 
information gathered from the wireless network. Two studies 
(macro and micro mobility) have been done in order to make 
this survey. This approach can be used by the enterprises to 
optimize the sites to place their resources (network printers, 
servers, meeting rooms, etc.). Furthermore, the network’s 
administrators can use these parameters to improve the 
network’s behavior by providing a better connection, better 
roaming, etc.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays, wireless local area networks are widely 
implemented. The public organisms such as universities, 
governments, etc. are well known examples. These wireless 
networks are usually based on the IEEE 802.11 b/g standard 
[1]. The standard presents many advantages. We can 
emphasize some of them: 
• 
The use of a free band in the 2.4 GHz.  
• 
Speeds up to 54 Mbps. 
• 
The user’s comfort is bigger than in wired networks.   
• 
Wireless networks allow the access of multiple 
computers with a smaller infrastructure cost.   
• 
The compatibility among different devices is very 
high, because of the organization Wi-Fi [2]. 
The IEEE 802.11 b/g networks present the intrinsic 
problems of any wireless technology. Some of them are:   
• 
The wireless connections bandwidth is smaller than 
in wired connections.   
• 
Wireless connections are more prone to be attacked 
because they can be accessed from anywhere, 
although there are several methods to encrypt the 
communication.   
• 
The roaming can stop any communication between 
the devices of the network.   
• 
WLAN is not compatible with other wireless 
technologies like Bluetooth [3], UMTS [4], etc. 
The wireless LAN network is mainly used to transmit 
data, but there are many other applications. One of the most 
well known applications is the indoor positioning system. 
The localization is made using the access point’s received 
signal strength and the use of different mathematical 
methods is possible [5]. There are many other applications 
such as providing connectivity in meetings, wireless VoIP, 
wireless IPTV and so on. Most of them are a service guided 
to end-user. 
In this paper, we use the data obtained from the WLAN 
in order to study the mobility of the users. The roaming 
information can be used to know the behavior of the people 
in a place, to relocate the bandwidth and how they move 
from one building to another. This information will let us 
know the movement of the users, what buildings are most 
visited, etc.  
We will study the mobility from several points of view: 
macro-mobility, that relates to the behavior of users between 
buildings and big areas, micro-mobility that relates to the 
movement of users inside a building and from that data we 
will extract the attractor points of the area, that are the focal 
points that have to be considered for the movement of 
people. 
This paper is based on a previous work [6] presented by 
the same authors. In this paper we have added a micro 
mobility study and improved several main parts of that 
conference paper. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we 
discuss the related work about mobility tracked by wireless 
networks. Section 3 explains our university wireless 
network. Section 4 describes the steps performed to gather 
mobility 
data. 
Macro-mobility 
and 
people 
tracking 
measurements can be observed in Section 5. Section 6 is 
devoted to micro-mobility and what is the mobility profile of 
mobile users in our wireless network. Moreover, we show 
the behavior of a regular user. Finally, Section 7 presents our 
conclusions and future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
We have found several works related to people mobility 
and tracking. 
In [7], Z. Chen et al. presented a system that works like 
an indoor GPS. It uses RFID and provides directional 
instructions for users while tracking things. It is called 
DynaTrack and consists of three key parts which are the 
RFID tags and readers, database servers that hold 
information about things’ location and the DynaTrack client

side interface. This system uses a dynamic or static system 
tags, depending on if it is an object or a person. Also, they 
tell us that if an object, initially labeled as static, begins to 
move, the system is able to change its address dynamically. 
Another example of a tracking system is presented by 
J.G. Markoulidakis et al. in [8]. In this paper, we can see a 
new 
system 
based 
on 
Third 
Generation 
Mobile 
Telecommunication Systems (TGMTS) and the three basic 
types of mobility models that are appropriate for the full 
range of the TGMTS design issues. They propose a 
methodological 
modeling 
approach 
called 
Integrated 
Mobility Modeling Tool (IMMT). IMMT tries to improve 
some aspects of other systems like the validation of the 
theoretical input assumptions and analytical models or the 
effect of the mobility model accuracy. 
The authors in [9] show the possibilities of utilizing 
RFID, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless technologies to 
determinate their limitations in personnel/equipment tracking 
and mapping mine works of Pollyanna (underground mine in 
Oklahoma). Other wireless technologies, as the conventional 
satellite GPS technology, are not feasible there. They 
evaluate the advantages in the real-time location services 
(RTLS) technology to determine their applicability and 
limitations to underground mining at the Pollyanna. 
In [10], B. Issac et al. presented a predictive mobility 
management system which could make mobility on an IEEE 
802.11 network more proactive with minimum loss and 
delay, when compared to existing schemes. Their proposal is 
focused on WLAN installations within a restricted campus 
and to predict the mobility path of a mobile node and use that 
information to lessen the handoff delay. 
A wireless indoor tracking system, based purely in 
software because no additional hardware is required, is 
described in [11]. It can be used to track and locate both 
moving and static WLAN-enabled devices inside a building. 
The system uses complex mathematic algorithms and 
determines the locations of the mobile devices according to 
the received signal strength from visible access points. The 
author categorizes the WLAN-based location determination 
algorithms, into two groups: deterministic and probabilistic 
algorithms. Finally, the paper is concluded making some 
reflections about the number of APs and their correct 
localization in order to obtain reliable results. 
There are other works that show a study and even try to 
imitate the human behavior movements through simulations. 
One of them is the paper presented by T. Liu et al. in [12]. 
They present a model in order to mimic human movement 
behavior. It is built as a two-level hierarchy in which the top 
level is the global mobility model (GMM): a deterministic 
model that is used to create intercell movements and the 
bottom level is the local mobility model (LMM): a stochastic 
model with dynamically changing state variables to model 
intracell movement. 
Another example of a human behavior simulation is 
given in the paper presented by C. Bettstetter [13]. It shows a 
model that can be used in simulations of mobile and wireless 
networks.  He uses a combination of principles for direction 
and speed control to provide the movement of the users. It 
shows the calculation process to simulate changes of speed, 
stop-and-go behaviors or address control, among others.  
In [14], the authors present a general methodology for 
obtaining the mobility information from wireless network 
traces, and for classifying mobile users and APs. In order to 
develop this methodology they use Fourier transform and 
Bayes’ theory. The authors find some relations between 
several parameters, but in their study they say that the data is 
too variable because it depends on seasonal cycles, trend, 
regression term and irregular effects. 
In [15], J. Gosh et al. analyze a yearlong wireless 
network users' mobility by tracing the data collected. They 
propose an efficient method to determine the main mobility 
profiles of a user using a mixture of Bernoulli's distribution. 
This method allows the authors to predict from 10% to 30% 
of the user's mobility. 
In summary, the works presented previously carried out 
studies only related with users' tracking, except for [12] and 
[13] that develop simulation models of people's mobility. In 
all of these previous papers, the buildings are considered as 
passive objects (they do not give information). In contrast, in 
our work, each building is considered a group of several 
APs, and we use these groups to see the user’s mobility 
around our university. With these data we could relocate 
some services and the displacement of the users would be 
more efficient.

WIRELESS NETWORK DESCRIPTION 
The Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV) is 
distributed on three Campuses. One of them is located in 
Valencia and contains about 80% of the students and staff of 
the University. It has a dimension of about three kilometers 
long and one kilometer wide. There are two smaller 
campuses in the nearby cities Gandia and Alcoy. There are 
around 4,000 researchers and educational personnel, around 
1,500 staff and around 36,000 students among the three 
campuses. The distribution of students in each faculty is 
shown in Table I. 
On these Campuses, a wireless IEEE 802.11 b/g network 
is deployed. It comprises more than 575 access points to get 
full coverage, including not only the buildings and offices, 
but the surrounding gardens and open space between these 
buildings. So, any person in the UPV can roam seamlessly 
between any locations. The distribution of these access 
points is: 33 APs are in the Campus of Gandia, 42 APs are in 
the Campus of Alcoy and 500 APs are in the main Campus 
(Campus de Vera). The APs are installed to allow the users a 
continuous coverage as they roam throughout a facility. The 
coverage of each access point varies between 30 m at 54 
Mbps and 137 m at 1 Mbps for indoor environments. 
The access points are from Cisco Systems Inc. (models 
1130, 1140 and 1300) and they are configured with three 
simultaneous SSIDs, one with VPN authentication, another 
one with 802.1X authentication and the last one interacted 
into the EDUROAM (European roaming project) for visitors. 
Any member of the University, and from others via 
EDUROAM, has free access to that wireless network.

PEOPLE TRACKING MEASUREMENTS 
It is quite complicated to predict if the students will visit 
more times some buildings than others. This study could be 
used to relocate some schools and services in order to obtain 
a more effective and efficient distribution or even to help 
planning the construction of a new university. In this section, 
the measurement process will be explained in order to 
analyze the number of users' change between buildings. 
Baseline measurement 
In order to gather information from the wireless network, 
the SNMP agent was activated in all wireless APs using only 
the required messages. Every time a MAC address is 
associated to an AP, it sends a SNMP trap message to a 
central server. This information is stored in a database to be 
processed and analyzed. 
First, APs are grouped according to the building where 
they are placed. This activity was not difficult because in our 
university each AP has a unique identifier, formed by the 
name from the building and the MAC address. All the APs in 
a building can be grouped easily using the same badge. 
The database contains several tables in order to analyze 
the information. There is a table that stores the day and the 
month of the information jointly with the AP DNS name and 
the MAC that has been associated. Another table relates 
every access point with the building where it is placed. These 
tables allow us to make several queries such as: 
• 
MACs registered 
• 
Buildings with wireless access points 
• 
MACs in every building 
• 
MACs in every campus 
• 
MACs that roam between buildings 
• 
MACs that roam between buildings every day 
• 
MACs that roam between buildings every month 
• 
MACs associated to every AP during a day 
• 
MACs associated to every AP during a month 
• 
APs in every building 
• 
APs where each MAC has been associated in a day  
• 
APs where each MAC has been associated in a 
month 
As we have said before, in this paper we are going to do 
a study where we analyze the macro-mobility and the micro-
mobility. Knowing this starting point we will treat the data in 
different ways. Firstly we will group the associations that 
occurs in each building (macro-mobility), on the other hand 
we analyze the MAC addresses, which travel more and 
which are the access points with more visits.   In order to 
process the information recollected in the database, we have 
used several SQL queries to extract the data needed and then 
we analyze the mobility of users. 
Moreover, when we have selected the data, we have used 
a spread sheet to calculate some parameters as average 
number of visits in a building, percentage of visits, etc. With 
this spread sheet we have made some figures to represent 
better the information collected.  
V. 
MOBILITY BEHAVIOUR OF USERS BETWEEN BUILINGS 
(MACRO-MOBILITY) 
In this section, the macro-mobility in our campuses will 
be studied. In this part of the study we analyze the mobility 
between buildings and campuses, besides we try to describe 
the people behavior using these data. 
A. Data processing 
The people tracking measurement process is based on the 
number of people roaming among buildings. It is also 
measured where the people stop during a period of time. 
These measurements let us know the quantity of movements 
among all the buildings in the campus. In order to estimate 
the time that a user takes to go from the A building to 
another B building, we keep in mind that it could be the C 
building inside this itinerary. Roaming will exist among the 
A building, the C building and the B building, but the 
displacement will be considered from the building A to the B 
building. This study cannot be considered as a system of 
privacy intrusion, because this system does neither save a 
correspondence list of each person, nor their MAC 
addresses. Only the amount of movements is interesting.  
Moreover, the MACs used in this study are not real. The 
system changes a real MAC to another one (fictional) to 
preserve the privacy of people 
Once all APs of each building have been grouped, the 
roaming among the APs of the same building will not be 
taken into account because these movements are inside the 
same building and the user does not move among buildings. 
All these data has been stored in a database during a 
month to carry out this study. Firstly, the data have been 
purified because there was some information that was not 
useful to this study. These data have been taken daily and, 
therefore, we can show the information gathered during a 
regular day or show the information about monthly activity.   
In order to process the data we have used a spreadsheet 
Excel 2007 with the NodeXL tool [16]. NodeXL is an 
extendible toolkit for network overview, discovery and 
exploration. The core of NodeXL is a special Excel 2007 
workbook template that structures data for network analysis 
and visualization. Six main worksheets currently form the 
template. There are worksheets for “Edges”, “Vertices”, and 
“Images” in addition to worksheets for “Clusters,” mappings 
of nodes to clusters (“Cluster Vertices”), and a global 
overview of the network’s metrics (“Overall Metrics”).

As we will see in the following section, this software tool 
allows visualize the roaming among the buildings, the 
quantity of roaming made, filter the quantity of roaming, etc. 
NodeXL is a powerful tool that can help us analyze the 
behavior of the network. NodeXL aims to make analysis and 
visualization of network data easier by combining the 
common analysis and visualization functions with the 
familiar spreadsheet paradigm for data handling. The tool 
enables essential network analysis tasks and thus supports a 
wide audience of users in a broad range of network analysis 
scenarios. 
B. Roaming during a day in the Vera Campus 
Table II shows the numbers of changes among the 
buildings in one day. The rows represent the number of users 
that roam from that building to another. The situations where 
there is no mobility among a pair of buildings, that is, there 
is no MAC roaming between that two buildings in a day, are 
represented with a dash (-). The biggest value obtained in the 
user’s mobility during a day is carried out from the building 
“E.T.S. de Gestión en la Edificación” and the “E.T.S. 
Ingeniería Informática” (4912 roamings). This is because of 
the buildings situation. The easiest way to access the “E.T.S. 
Ingeniería Informática” building is through the “E.T.S. de 
Gestión de la edificación” building. Furthermore, this last 
building is located in front of a tram stop, so it is an entry 
zone to this part of the university.  
In Table II, it can be seen that “E.T.S. of 
Telecommunication” building has many roamings to other 
buildings. The reason is similar to the previous one, in front 
of this building there is also a tram stop and this building is 
located in the central area of the main campus. Among the 
“E.T.S. de Telecomunicación” and “E.T.S. de Caminos, 
Canales y Puertos” there are 2290 roamings in a day, this is 
because 
it 
is 
needed 
to 
cross 
the 
“E.T.S. 
de 
Telecomunicación” building to arrive to “E.T.S. de Caminos, 
Canales y Puertos” building. Another building that has a lot 
of roamings is the “E.T.S.I. Geodésica, Cartográfica y 
Topografía” building. In this case these roamings were 
caused because it is placed near the snack bar. This snack bar 
has wireless coverage thanks to the APs of the “E.T.S.I. 
Geodésica, Cartográfica y Topografía” building. We will see 
several movements related with this building in our studies. 
Lastly, among the “E.T.S.I. Caminos, Canales y Puertos” 
building and “E.T.S. Arquitectura” building there are 2202 
roamings by day. These roamings could be due to:  
a) The proximity between both buildings  
b) The relationship of contents that are taught in both 
buildings. May be students and/or professors walk from one 
building to the other in order to carry out theoretical or 
practice classes.   
C. Roaming during a month in the Vera Campus 
Table III shows the roaming value carried out during a 
month among the buildings of the Vera Campus of the 
Universitat Politècnica de Valéncia. In this table, the data 
movements from one building to another, and vice versa, 
have been added. That is, we have not considered the 
direction of the roaming. 
The maximum number of roamings in one month is 
carried out among the “E.T.S. de Gestión en la Edificación” 
building and “E.T.S. Ingeniería Informática” building. We 
explained why before. The number of roamings between 
“E.T.S. de Telecomunicación” and “E.T.S. de Caminos, 
Canales y Puertos” buildings was 26746.  In this case 
roamings were due to the proximity of the buildings and 
because it is necessary to cross the building “E.T.S. de 
Telecomunicación” to arrive to “E.T.S. de Caminos, Canales 
y Puertos” when the people come from the tram.  
There were also many user movements between “E.T.S. 
Arquitectura” 
building 
and 
the 
“E.T.S. 
de 
Telecomunicación” building (17704 user movements in a 
month). 
The “E.T.S. Ingeniería del Diseño” and “E.T.S.I. 
Industriales” buildings have also a lot of roamings. These 
buildings have many users registered (see Table I). There are 
many roamings between these buildings due to the likeness 
of the studies. It seems that there are many subjects imparted 
by the same department, so there are professors moving 
between these buildings indistinctly. 
“F. de Bellas Artes” building had less roamings. We 
think that it is because “fine arts” students do not use too 
much computers, laptops or mobile devices to connect to the 
wireless data network, as it happens with the students of the 
other buildings (this is a technical university).  
Lastly, “E.T.S. Medio Rural y Enología”, the “E.P.S. 
Alcoy”, and “E.P.S. Gandia” have very few movements 
between them (there are 1350 roamings among “E.P.S. 
Alcoy” and “E.P.S. Gandia”). This is because these buildings 
belong to different campus located in different cities. There 
are users that one day can be in a campus and, after some 
hours, they are in another campus. In this case there is a 
hard-roaming because the user loses the connection during a 
large time because the user is travelling. If we take into 
account the buildings of the Vera Campus we observe that 
the most number of roamings are between the Vera Campus 
and the rest of campuses. 
D. Roaming between Campuses 
Figure 1 shows the values of the roamings carried out 
among the different campuses of the Universitat Politècnica 
de Valéncia during a month. These campuses are Escuela 
Politécnica Superior de Gandia (located in Gandia city), 
Escuela Politécnica Superior de Alcoy (located in Alcoy 
city), E.T.S. Medio Rural y Enología (located in one of the 
main avenues of Valencia City). 
The number of movements in a month between the 
Gandia's campus and the Vera's campus are 5497. It is the 
highest value between campuses. There are quite a lot of 
movements between Gandia’s campus and Vera’s campus 
because they are relatively near (around 56 km.). There is a 
good public transport communication and many professors 
of Gandia's campus also work in Vera's campus. Moreover, a 
lot of lecturers of E.P.S. de Gandia have in Vera’s campus 
their place, where they do their researches. The roamings 
between Alcoy's campus and Vera's campus is quite lower 
(1844 roamings), the reasons are very similar but there are 
fewer movements because in Alcoy there are less people.

The number of roamings among “E.T.S. Medio Rural y 
Enología” and Vera's campus is 2768, but there are very few 
movements between “E.T.S. Medio Rural y Enología” and 
Gandia’s campus, and between “E.T.S. Medio Rural y 
Enología” and Alcoy's campus.  
We can see in Figure 1 that Vera's campus is the campus 
that receives more visits. This result is a prospective fact 
because Vera's campus is the main campus of our university 
and most of the formalities, documentation procedures, 
applications and administrative issues have to be made there. 
Lastly, we can see that 1350 movements per month are 
carried out among "E.P.S. de Gandia" and "E.P.S. de Alcoy". 
The main reason of these movements is the existence of 
many professors that teach classes in both campuses so they 
must move between them. 
 
 
Figure 1.  
Roaming between Campuses 
E. People Behavior 
In this section, we will evaluate the users' movements by 
day in the Vera's campus. We will also analyze the number 
of changes carried out per user in a day.   
In Figure 2, the 5 highest roaming values between 
buildings are shown. The situation of more mobility is given 
among “FI” and “GE”. It has a value of 4912. In this figure, 
all of displacements shown have a higher value than 1834 
movements/day. In this case, the movements are given 
among “IND”-“BIB”, “DSIC”-“EI”, “ARQ”-“BIB” and 
"CASALU”-“BIB”. With these data we can obtain some 
information. E.g. the students of “E.T.S. Arquitectura” and 
“E.T.S.I. Industriales” visit the university library more times 
than the other students of the university. On the other hand, 
there are many movements among the university library 
building and the “Student's house” building (this building is 
used by the students to study, to connect to Internet and to 
develop any activity). This movement is due to the vicinity 
of buildings (see Figure 2) and many users that are in one of 
the buildings usually visit the other building. In Figure 3, the 
10 highest roaming values are shown. In this case, we have 
the 5 previous movements (see Figures 2) and 5 more. These 
5 new displacements are carried out among “GE”-“DSIC”, 
“GE”-“ARQ”, “FI”-“EI”, “ARQ”-“ASIC” and “ARQ”-
“CCP”. The minimum number of roamings of all 
displacements seen in Figure 3 is 1483 per day. One of the 
buildings that had more movements is “ARQ” (E.T.S. 
Arquitectura). The main reason seems to be because some 
services are offered in this building. For example, this 
building has some snack bars, and there are some banks in 
the bottom plant. We can also find a hairdresser, bookstores, 
etc. and it can be found a great number of movements among 
this place and other buildings. 
Figure 4 represents all the Vera's campus movements 
during one day. Almost all of buildings have users' mobility. 
We can state that the wireless network of our university is 
very robust. This network can support the mobility of all 
users giving the appropriate service. 
Lastly, we analyzed the number of changes per person. 
This information is shown in Table IV.

The buildings that have the biggest number of 
movements per person are “E.T.S. de Gestión en la

value of 0.797 movements per person. The movements 
among “IND”-“BIB” and “ARQ”-“BIB” also possess a high 
number of changes per person, 0.644 and 0.608 respectively. 
VI. 
MOBILITY OF USERS INSIDE OF A BUILDING (MICRO-
MOBILITY) 
In the previous section we have analyzed the mobility 
between buildings and campuses. Now in this section we are 
going to study the mobility of the most mobile users from the 
point of view of small-scale mobility.  
A. First steps in micro-mobility 
In this subsection we are going to present the data from 
the point of view of micro-mobility. Firstly, we have selected 
the number of clients per day, which visit only one AP, two 
APs, and so on until 9 APs. This is depicted on table V.

Figure 4.  
All roaming values in the Vera’s Campus 
These data were taken for a month. We assume that 
clients with 1 or 2 APs visited are statics because the 
wireless coverage in our campuses is nearly 100% so there 
are a lot APs to cover the maximum number of sites. Other 
users visit about 3 or 4 APs a day, meaning that they are 
limited mobile clients. From now on we will call that kind of 
clients as “laptop clients” because this type of users take 
their laptops and they go from their offices to another site to 
make a meeting. Finally we have the true mobile users, and 
we consider any user as a mobile user when a client has been 
detected in 5 or more than 5 different APs. 
In Figure 5, it is represented the visits collected per day 
in each case. In this figure we can observe that all lines have 
the same pattern. We can extract several conclusions from 
this figure. First there are more static people than mobile 
people, because we can see that the line referenced to 1 AP 
visited per day is higher than others. Moreover, there are 
some days that break the normal pattern, this is due to these 
days are Sundays (on Sundays, faculties are close and only 
the library and the student house are open), e.g. the eighth 
day. Besides, between the 14th and the 20th day, there are few 
visits registered in APs, because for these days we had 
holiday time. As we can see, these maximum and minimum 
values are in all patterns, independently if we have a mobile 
or a static user. In mobile users these values are softer 
because we have fewer users. 
Total numbers in this test can be viewed in the table V. In 
this table we shown the total visits that have only one AP, 2 
AP and so on until 9 AP. Apart from that, we have calculated 
the percentage of these total visits and the percentage of 
visits when a client has visited more than x APs, being x the 
number of APs visited. In this table we can observer that the 
58.6% of the users in our university are static. The 23.1% are 
laptop users and the rest are mobile users (18.3%). Although 
this percentage seems a bit low, in our community means 
that 7686 people are mobile users. So, it is important to 
know this data when we redesign the wireless network or 
when we try to implement roaming systems to improve the 
quality of the end-applications. 
In order to analyze our collected data we need to select 
the correct data and the data that disturb our analysis. 
According to these criteria, the holiday days and Sundays we 
have to delete. In Figure 6 we represent a boxplot to see 
where the most important data are.  This figure shows the 
maximums and minimums (start and end of lines) clients 
who have been associated to 1 AP, 2 AP, 3 AP, etc. In each 
AP, the green box represents that the most of data are 
between these intervals. For example, if we pay attention in 
the users who visit two APs, minimum value is 179 visits (it 
occurred the 20th day), the maximum value was obtained on 
the 2nd day and the number of visits was 1541. For this case 
the most of visits are between 812.5 and 1167. We can 
observe that the boxes are smaller according to the number 
of APs are higher, it is due to the number of mobile clients 
are lower than static or laptop clients. When we have clients, 
which have visited 7, 8 or 9 access points, the variability of 
their associations is very small compared with the static 
clients, it occurs for the same reason. In table V we can see 
that the most mobile clients (7, 8 or 9 APs visited) represent 
the 5.6 % of total registered users. 
Finally in this subsection we want to show another 
figure, which represents the APs needed according to the 
different visits number (see Figure 7). In order to make this 
figure we have deleted the data, which could get worse our 
analysis, we have deleted the 2nd day and the holiday period 
(14th – 20th, both included). In this figure we have used the 
average number of visits to print the line called data and then 
we have made a mathematical approximation with the trend 
line.

Figure 7.  
AP needed according to is tythe visits. 
According to Figure 7, we can affirm that if we had few 
visits in our APs, we should configure our APs to manage 
mobile user correctly. However, if we had a lot of visits in 
our APs, we should configure our wireless network to 
provide the service to static users. So, the question is 
regarding to the number of visits, how I know if a user is 
mobile?  
We relate the mobility of a user according to the different 
number of APs visited. When 1 or 2 APs are visited, we say 
that the user is static, but when 3 or 4 APs are visited, the 
user is light itinerant and when more APs visited, the user is 
mobile. 
We have estimated relationship between the number of 
visits and the number of APs visited, in this scenario. This 
relationship is shown in expression 2. APv is the number of 
access points visited and visits are the different visits 
registered by the access point.

This expression has a R2 equals to 0.9961. R2 means the 
proportion of variability in a data set that is accounted for by 
the statistical model. It provides a measure of how well 
future outcomes are likely to be defined by the model. In our 
case the 99.61% of data follow the model, but this model is 
calculated with average visits. For this reason, we have 
checked our real data with this model and we have obtained 
that the 84.48% of data follow this model. It is a good result 
and our model could be used for our university to make some 
changes in the network as we will see in the conclusions. 
B. Mobile users 
In this subsection we analyze the behavior of the most 
mobile users. In order to know who is he or she, we have 
defined several SQL queries (but always maintaining the 
anonymity of the persons). In order to have a better study, 
we have observed more data. In this case, the observation 
time period has been two months (March and April of the 
year 2010). 
Figure 8 plots the visits that a regular user makes during 
2 months. We have observed that during this time, this user 
does not have mobility every day, so this figure shows only 
the days that the user has had mobility. 
According to Figure 8, we can state that the user has 
quite mobility, because in many cases it has had more than 
10 visits per day (even up to 55 visits in one day), so it is an 
important value. It seems that this user works only with a 
mobile device and it is always connected to the wireless 
network, which allows us to register all the user's 
movements.

Figure 9.  
Gandia’s Campus. 
C. Micro-mobility in Gandia’s Campus 
Now, we are going to fix in a smaller place than Vera’s 
Campus, this is Gandia’s Campus. This campus is the second 
biggest one, if we pay attention to the number of people 
(according to Table I, 2039 people are registered).  
We can see the campus in Figure 9. This figure 
represents several buildings; each one has its name according 
to a letter. In this map, we have located the access points 
(black points) approximately in the correct place. We say 
approximately because all buildings have several floors and 
in order to make a good design, sometimes the APs are 
situated in other places because we want more coverage or 
less interference. 
Moreover, the name of each AP in our university helps us 
to know where it is more or less located. The names follow a 
structure. We are going to explain it with an example.  
The access point called ac1-gnd1a0e.net.upv.es has the 
following explanation. First three letters “ac1” is the model 
of the access point used. Then, the following three ones, in 
this case “gnd1”, is the location. “gnd1” is Gandia, but this 
part of the name is the same for all names in Table IV. Then, 
there is the name of building and the floor, in this case “a0” 
means building A and floor 0. Next, there is the orientation: 
north = n, south = s, west = o and east = e. In the example we 
have an access point located in the east, “e”. Finally, we 
have “net.upv.es” means that this device belongs to UPV. 
In order to analyze the movement of a user, we have 
selected the most mobile user of Gandia’s Campus. We are 
going to see his movement using the Table VI. It shows us 
the access point name, where the user has visited, the day 
and the time. 
In this case we can see that this user has quite mobility in 
few hours. The mobility of this user starts at 11:00. First he 
connects to “ac1-gnd.1a0c.net.upv.es”, so he is located on 
building A, in floor 0 and on the AP of the center. He moves 
to the east (“ac1-gnd.1a0e.net.upv.es”) on the same floor 
and then he goes up to the first floor. He stays there during 
an hour. Then, the user does the similar movement steps. At 
13:34 he stays at the AP of the center of building A, in floor 
0. Then, he goes to the east direction and to the first floor. At 
14:42 he changes to the D building, firstly to the ground 
floor, and then to the first floor. Next, he goes to the E 
building, 
and 
he 
goes 
up 
to 
6th 
floor 
(“ac1-
gnd1e6c.net.upv.es”). Finally, he goes to the outside of the 
buildings (“ac3-extgnd1.net.upv.es”) until 16:05.

At 4 p.m he starts to move a lot. He is on the first floor of 
building A, then, he moved to building C. When he finished 
his activities on this building he went to building D, and 
then, he went to building E, staying in the first floor, the 5th 
floor and, finally, the 7th floor. Next, he went to the 1st floor 
of building F. Then he went to the 2nd floor of building G 
and, finally, he moved to the outdoor zone. Finally, at 5 p.m. 
he went from the 1st floor of building D to building E. In this 
building he moved from the 2nd, to the 3rd and, finally to the 
6th floor. And, then, he finished his movements. 
According to these movements we could indicate what 
kind of person has this behavior. In this case, we think that 
he could be a language lecturer because, first, he was on 
building A, where the classrooms are placed, maybe he is 
teaching his lessons. Then, he went to his office (language 
offices are on building E). From 14:42 to 16:05 he went to 
take his lunch outside of the university. Then, he went to 
building A. May be he enters to the university through this 
building. He went to his office again and, then, he went to 
building F (another place where are language offices) to see 
a colleague and they went to the bar (building C). Finally he 
came back to his office. With this type of micro-mobility we 
can observe the people behavior only by using wireless 
networks. When the same movements are done by many 
people at the same time, we can predict the needed resources 
for a period of time in a specific place. May be, the network 
will require more devices in an specific part of the network 
because of the number of connections during a limited period 
of time one day in a week. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we presented a user mobility study based 
on the roaming of the MACs in the wireless network of the 
Universitat Politècnica of València. We made two types of 
studies. First we have analyzed the macro-mobility. In this 
case, the mobility between buildings and campuses has been 
studied. Second, we studied the micro-mobility that let us 
know the mobility inside buildings.  
Using the measured data we can analyze the behavior of 
students and professors in the campus. This study let us build 
reallocation bandwidth scenarios to increase the comfort of 
the end user, i.e., if we note that a set of users go far to an 
area, we could determine in detail where will they go. May 
be this information could be used to reallocate services and 
departments in the campus by changing their place or putting 
a branch near the appropriate place. 
Besides, we could see that making a detailed WLAN 
study (micro-mobility), and knowing behavior of some 
people allow us to know the type of person that is walking 
through the areas. This type of study could let us know 
where we should place the network printers, the coffee and 
drinks machines, and some internal services. 
We have also shown that we can obtain some 
information about the user just studying his mobility profile. 
This kind of information could be used also for advertising 
services, direct marketing and similar tasks. 
Finally, this analysis will be the basis for our future work 
on a dynamic management and control system of the 
wireless network. According to the user mobility, the system 
will be able to give more bandwidth in those areas where 
more users are, and the roaming system will be more 
efficient. Even we are thinking on talking with the transport 
services to let them know which is the mobility between our 
campuses in order to provide an adequate transport service.
