Abstract—Quantitative
analysis of
wrist
actigraphy
data
recorded in real life is a topic of growing interest. For
historical reasons, most of that data is collected using a one
minute epoch, i.e. the system stores one piece of data each
minute, and recordings are limited to a few days. When the
data is used for wake/sleep studies, the “gold standard”
reference is the Polysomnography (PSG) and little is known
about the correlation of actigraphy data with epochs shorter
than one minute. It is unknown what is the quantitative impact
of infradian rhythms, that could be longer than one year, on
shorter recordings. To explore those two areas, the only option
is to make longer recordings with shorter epochs. We present a
set of data, collected as part of a larger project. For the first
time, this paper makes available one year of wrist actimetry in
real life, stored at one second epochs. A first evaluation of that
data calls for new ways for actimetry analysis and actigraphy
display. The raw data is available to the public.
Keywords-Actimetry; Actigraphy; Circadian rhythms.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The terms “actimetry” and “actigraphy” are used as
synonymous for motion activity measures where ”actimetry
emphasizes the measurement aspect of the technique and
actigraphy
emphasizes
the
descriptive
aspects
of
the
technique” [1]. Wrist actigraphy has been used in the past 30
years to monitor motion activity. Clinical guidelines and
researches suggest that wrist actimetry is particularly useful
in
the
documentation
of circadian
rhythms,
of sleep
disorders, of treatment outcomes and as an adjunct to home
monitoring of several pathologies. During the day, it is
possible
to
quantify
the
physical
exercise
and
(with
calibration) recognize some type and intensity of the
exercise. Reviews are available in several application areas
[2]-[7]. Most published data use a one minute epoch, i.e. the
system stores one piece of data each minute, and recordings
are limited to a few days. The reasons for that selection of
parameters are mainly practical, due to the characteristics of
the available instrumentation and the logistic/organizational
issues of the recordings, especially in real life.
That selection of parameters sets limits on the possible
evaluations of the data. When the data is used for wake/sleep
studies,
the
“gold
standard”
reference
is
the
Polysomnography (PSG), where data is presented in pages
30s long with signals in the range of 0-100 Hz, so short
epochs could allow better correlations. There are infradian
rhythms spanning over years and without long continuous
recordings it is unknown if and how much those rhythms
have an impact on shorter recordings. The technology
advances offer today the possibility to record more data and
in an easier way, but still few long term recordings are
described in literature [8]-[14] and only few groups explore
shorter epochs [19]. None of those “extended” recording is
available to the public. To explore those two areas, the only
option is to make longer recordings with shorter epochs and
here we describe one of them.
Section II describes the modality of the recording, the
export of the data from the original format and the creation
of an activity file of one year. Section III explains the main
characteristic of the data and options to study it. Section IV
notes the most important findings of those preliminary
results. We conclude our work in Section V.
II.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The subject of the recording is the author: age 62 at the
start of the recording, male, BMI= 26.3, no known major
chronic pathologies. Data is collected using a Motionwatch8
logger (CamNtech Ltd., Cambridge, UK) on the non-
dominant
wrist.
Motionwatch8
is
a
clinical
system
extensively used in research [23] and it is a recognized
reference in the field. The logger is programmed and data
managed using the MotionWare software (CamNtech Ltd –
Cambridge – UK). The logger is set to store data in an epoch
of one second in "normal" mode. That means that the
intensity of the movement on the axis perpendicular to the
surface of the unit, is measured by an accelerometer sampled
at 50 Hz. Data is transformed in a single value of a custom
unit (Counts) each second. The logger acquires also a value
of light intensity (Lux) each second. Details are described
elsewhere by the manufacturer [15]. A maximum of 36 hours
of activity and lights data is stored at 1s epoch in the unit and
therefore there is the need for a data download every day. A
diary is kept of major events (travels, flu, mismanagements,
etc.). As usual in this kind of recordings, it is not possible to
know the exact position of the unit on the wrist and if and
when the photocell of the unit could be somehow obscured
(garments, tools, etc.). The marker available on the logger is
used to signal when the unit is not worn.
Using the MotionWare software, the values inside the
marked intervals are modified from 0 to “n/a”. Then, the
recordings are joined in files containing more or less 10 days
(one million lines) and exported as .CSV files. Using a
spreadsheet (OpenCalc – Apache OpenOffice – Apache
Open Foundation), lines with “n/a” are changed to “-1” and
the data is divided in 9 columns: year, month, day, hour,
minute, seconds, counts, lux integers, lux decimals. That
format allows the files to be easily accepted by several
software programming languages.

With programs we wrote in Octave [21], activity Counts
are extracted, saved as .MAT files and joined in one year
long file, for a total of 31.576.501 data lines. The time of the
file is continuous, aligned to “summer” time used in Italy in
June, at the beginning of the recording (UTC+2: 27 March to
30
October
2016;
26
March
to
29
October
2017).
Evaluations and graphics of this article are computed from
that file using programs we wrote in Octave.

RESULTS
Out of 31,576,501 samples, there are 24,936,212 zeros
(78.97%), 1,034,485 n/a (3.28%) and 5,605,804 (17.75%)
non-zero values. If we compare data stored at one second
epoch with data stored at one minute epoch (most used
epoch in published articles), we find a completely different
ratio between zero and non-zero samples. Over the 1440
minutes of a day, a typical result for one minute epoch would
be 555 (39%) zero and 884 (61%) non-zero epochs while for
the one second epoch, zeros are about 80 % of the total. How
is that possible? The answer is that one minute epochs are
computed as the arithmetical sum of 60 one second samples
and most of those samples are zero, as shown in Figure 1.
For instance, in the lower line, minutes 02.41, 42 and 43
would be counted as 3 active minutes using a one minute
epoch, while there are only 5 seconds of movement.
Figure 1. Examples of recordings at epochs of one second: day upper side,
night lower. Actimetry in Counts (black) with range on the left, light in Lux
(yellow) with range on the right.
Then, we need to extract information from those zero
values. A first option for data analysis of zero values could
be to consider the percent of zeros inside a time interval. For
instance, we may consider one day, divide it in two pieces,
like from 10 am to 11. pm and from 11 pm to 10 am, and
compute for each day the zero values percent of the two
segments. If we plot those values for the full year (Figure 2),
the two segments show a quite different behaviour. (Few
days with more than 5% of n/a data is removed for a better
graph display.). We can get further details if we divide the
day in eight segments of 3 hours (Figure 3). It is possible to
see that also in that segmentation, a percent of zero values
lower than 50% (internal circumference) is exceptional. The
circadian behaviour is consistent over the year. The change
of the clock to summertime (27 March to 30 October 2016;
26 March to 29 October 2017) may be responsible for some
asymmetry that is noted both in Figure 2 and in Figure 3;
solar time is from day 135 to day 285.
Another option for data analysis of zero values could be
to show not the single epoch values, but the length of the
succession of series of zero and non-zero values.

intervals 10am-11pm (blue) 11pm-10am (red).

For instance, the sequence ...,0,m,n,0,0,0,p,q,r,0.... will be
described using positive and negative integers as …,2,-3,
3,...In the recorded year, there is a sequence of 1.429.113
zero series and, of course, the same amount of non-zeros
ones. The distribution of lengths of series at one second
epoch in the year is shown in Figure 4, with non-zero series
on the right and zero series on the left. The zero series can be
long up to 7400 seconds, the non-zero series up to 623
seconds. There is a peak of several hundred thousand series
around few short lengths. If we zoom in Figure 4, we see
(Figure 5) that over one year, the number of zero and non-

zero series longer than 10 seconds is a small percent of the
total.

non-zero series on the right. Y axis: number of series.

zero series on the right Y axis– number of series.
Figure 6. Day one, Start time 09:52:00. X axis: 100,000 seconds – Y-axis:
length of the series in seconds: non-zero series up, zero series down.
But, that small percent of lengths are not distributed
randomly. If we plot the series, with non-zero series up and
zero series down and the distance between the series equal to
the length of the series, we get a graph as shown in Figure 6.
The pattern is clearly bimodal and that daily profile is
consistent over the year.
We may also imagine studying those series as states and
search for models of their dynamics. For instance, we may
evaluate one step from zero series or from non-zero series. If
we plot the length of zero series as negative values and non-
zero series that follows them as positive, as in Figure 7, we
see that only short zero series can move to long non-zero
ones. In the same way, Figure 8 shows that only short non-
zero series can move to long zero ones, This suggests that,
for instance, a model like the one in Figure 9 and the
possibility to make statements on the data dynamics without
any a priori hypothesis on the physiology.

DISCUSSION
A first qualitative description of the dataset offers 3
unexpected results. First of all, there is the large number of
zero values in the one second epoch recordings compared
with the one's with one minute epoch. Traditionally,
actigraphy is analysed as a table of a dependent variable
(activity counts) and an independent one (time) with fitting
methods like Cosinor [16]. That approach is quite difficult
when 80% of values are zeros and push to focus on the study
of those zero values. Over the years, there were studies on
zero values, also called “immobility” [17]. It is one area of
studies that is getting new attention [18] and the higher
granularity of one second epochs has already shown some
potential [19]. The quantity of non-zero values (activity
intensity) and quantity of light (light intensity) could provide
useful additional information to the study of zero values even
if their contribution is based on data more open to artefacts
and noise.
The second unexpected result is the permanent circadian
distribution of the percent of zero values as shown in Figure
2 and Figure 3. Finding which time interval, and which
segmentation of it, would better suit to describe the data, is a
research task similar to the well-known Non-Parametric
Circadian Rhythm Analysis (NPCRA) method [20].
Last, the pattern in Figure 6 shows, in a different data
space, the information of Figure 2 (higher zero percent
during the night) but with a more detailed time relationship.
It also shows that very long series of zero values, during this
year,
are
allowed
only
during
sleep
(personal
communication). Their length seems not to be related to
sleep stages and co-recording of polygraphic data is needed
to explore that relationship. The exploration of series and
their dynamics is , as far as I know, a new area of research
for actigraphy analysis.
All the above information is easy to see from the
proposed graphic displays. That means that there is a very
high probability that artificial intelligence algorithms will be
able to recognise those patterns and offer better insights
(hopefully quantitative) on the data.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
For the first time, we make available one year of wrist
actimetry in real life, stored at one seconds epochs. Most of
the activity values stored by the Motionwatch8 are equal to
zero. Examples of ways to study those zeros and to display
them are introduced. The raw data described in this article
are freely available to researchers on the National Sleep
Research Resource (NSRR) platform [22]. Hopefully, other
researchers will look for new tools to analyse human motor
activity and clarify the role of actigraphy in the personalised
medicine.
