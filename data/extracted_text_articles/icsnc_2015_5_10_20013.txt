Abstract— In this paper, we proposed efficient partial decoding 
algorithm for high efficiency video coding (HEVC). HEVC is 
the new video coding standard for next generation video 
industry. However, it needs massive memory and consumes 
battery power since the resolution of video sequences became 
larger. The goal of our approach is to reduce video resolution 
and memory size for mobile devices. Our algorithm is 
implemented to HEVC decoder. Experimental results show 
that the proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce video 
resolution during decoding process. 
Keywords- HEVC; Video codec; Partial decoding; Low 
resolution decoding. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
High efficiency video coding is the latest international 
video coding standard, which is established by Joint 
Collaborative Team in Video Coding (JCT-VC) consists of 
Video Coding Experts Group (VCEG) by ITU-T and 
Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) of ISO/IEC. HEVC 
achieves half bit-rate reduction compared with H.264/AVC 
and deals with various video sequence like Ultra High 
Definition (UHD), High Definition (HD), screen contents 
and video conferencing sequences. HEVC employs new 
technologies [2], for instance, quad-tree based block 
partitioning structure, 35 intra prediction direction, DCT-
based interpolation filter for fractional inter prediction, 
sample adaptive offset (SAO). However, Decoded Picture 
Buffer (DPB) size and memory bandwidth of encoder and 
decoder of HEVC is dramatically increased caused by high 
resolution. In case of mobile devices, memory and battery 
capacity are very limited resources and important issue for 
both of customer and engineer. In low resolution decoding 
for high efficiency video coding (LRD) [3], for reducing 
battery consumption, authors proposed simple partial 
decoding algorithm for HEVC. The goal of LRD is to 
switch on low power decode mode when necessary to 
saving battery power. However, LRD is implemented only 
for the encoder and it is not concerned with decoder side. 
Also, using LRD algorithm, we cannot reduce actual video 
resolution. 
In this paper, we propose partial decoding algorithm with 
resizing resolution of video sequences for HEVC decoder. 
In Section II, the conventional algorithm is briefly reviewed. 
The proposed algorithm is explained in Section III and 
experimental results and their discussion are presented in 
Section IV. Finally, we conclude our study in Section V.

CONVENTIONAL ALGORITHM 
In [3], authors proposed low power decode mode in 
HEVC. First, LRD decomposes a video sequence into two 
components, which are low resolution component (LR) and 
high resolution component (HR), as shown in Figure 1. 
When low power decode mode is switched on, only the low 
resolution component is decoded following LRD algorithm. 
Also, LRD employs lossless buffer compression algorithm 
[4] for additional data reduction using absolute moment 
block truncation.  
 
Figure 2. Direct pixel copy for intra prediction 
Intra prediction is used to reduce spatial redundancy 
using high correlation between adjacent pixels. Reference 
pixels located upper and left of current block is utilized for 
predicting current pixels. When the low power decode mode 
is on, HR components do not exist in the reference pixels 
and it should be interpolated for decoding current Prediction

Unit (PU). The authors proposed the “direct pixel copy” 
method, which replaces missing pixels to nearby pixels, as 
shown in Figure 2. Missing HR components are substituted 
by its left LR pixels or upper LR pixels, which are already 
decoded for low resolution intra prediction. This method has 
the similar computational complexity for full decoding and 
it only need half computing power when the low power 
decode mode is switched on. 
Motion Estimation (ME) and Motion Compensation 
(MC) using temporal correlation of video sequences are 
important part for video coding. To utilize MC module in 
HEVC with LRD, decoder should interpolate HR pixels in 
reference pictures, like intra prediction. LRD employs 
bilinear interpolation to keep original MC in HEVC. For full 
decoding, HR components are brought back from memory 
and, with LR components, full decoding can be successfully 
operated in LRD. 
 
Figure 3. Pixel positions for bilinear filter 
The authors proposed cascading structure for LRD de-
blocking process. First, as shown in Figure 3, the authors 
interpolate missing HR component using bilinear filter, HRm 
= LRu + LRb, where HRm is missing HR component, LRu 
and LRb are upper and bottom low resolution component, 
respectively. Boundary strength and decision process is 
applied on LR component and interpolated HR component. 
Finally, de-blocking filter operates only for LR component 
and, for full decoding, HR component is fetched from buffer 
and applied de-blocking filter as well. 
  In LRD, the authors proposed partial decoding algorithm 
for memory bandwidth and power saving. Partial decoding 
is the method for decoder, but LRD algorithm is 
implemented at encoder. Therefore, we cannot measure 
partial decoding algorithm properly. Partial decoding 
algorithm should be applied for decoder since its purpose is 
to reduce memory and resolution during decoding process. 
In the next section, we propose partial decoding algorithm 
for HEVC decoder. 
III. 
PROPOSED ALGORITHM 
The goal of proposed algorithm is to reduce resolution 
and DPB size by 25% of HEVC DPB size during decoding 
process. Implementing partial decoding algorithm in 
decoder can cause severe error propagation; therefore, 
minimizing error is an important issue. First, we decompose 
pixels into two: Not Decoded Pixel (NDP) and Decoded 
Pixel (DP), as shown in Figure 4. In our method, DPs that 
are 1/4 pixels of video sequences will be stored in DPB after 
reconstructing. The proposed algorithm consists of 3 sub-
sections, which are partial decoding method for intra 
prediction, DCT-based interpolation and modification in de-
blocking filter.  
A. Intra prediction for partial decoding  
 
Figure 5. Pixel classification for proposed intra prediction 
Intra prediction of HEVC is significantly improved 
compared with H.264/AVC by employing 35 prediction 
directions and related techniques for coding efficiency. For 
decoding intra predicted picture, reference pixels located 
upper and left PU should be stored in buffer. However, the 
NDPs in reference line are missing during partial decoding 
process described in Figure 5. Intra predicted picture would 
be a most important reference picture since it affects the 
whole picture in Group of Picture (GOP). To prevent error 
propagation in intra predicted pictures, we propose full 
decoding method only for Future Reference Pixel (FRP), as 
described in Figure 5. Excepting FRPs, the proposed 
algorithm reconstruct only DPs for reducing DPB size.

DCT-based interpolation filter (DCTIF) in motion 
compensation process is adopted for HEVC. It has coding 
efficiency about 4% bitrate reduction for luminance 
component. The details of calculating DCTIF coefficients is 
specified in [5]. 
To reconstruct inter predicted picture by using HEVC 
standard, reference pictures in reference lists and 
corresponding motion vectors should be prepared. DCT-
based interpolation process is applied for fractional sample 
position. However, in Figure 6, we do not have some integer 
pixels 
causing 
partial 
decoding 
and 
DCT-based 
interpolation cannot operate without them. To solve this 
problem, we consider missing pixels (white pixels) as also 
fractional pixel to be interpolated, so we calculate filter taps 
to DCT-based interpolation filter for 8 fractional pixels in

C. De-blocking filter for partial decoding 
In video codec, de-blocking filter is employed to improve 
not only visual result but also coding efficiency. Blocking 
artifact on block boundary caused by quantization is 
removed by low-pass filtering. There are 6 steps for HEVC-
de-blocking filter; first of all, determine Transform Unit 
(TU) or PU block boundary and then calculate boundary 
strength. HEVC should decides whether the de-blocking 
filter is applied or not, and select appropriate filter (strong or 
weak). In proposed algorithm, for de-blocking filter process 
in partial decoding algorithm, we use DPs in Figure 4 
without NDPs. For instance, when HEVC determines 
whether filter is applied or not, the first and fourth line of 
the 4ⅹ4 block is used. However, in proposed algorithm, 
DPs on first and third line of 4ⅹ4 block are used for the de-
blocking process. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The proposed algorithm is implemented in decoder of 
HEVC test model (HM) 15.0 for evaluating its performance. 
The encoded bit streams of test sequences are used under 
the HEVC common test conditions [6] and we run the 
experiment for test sequences of the JCT-VC [7]. We 
experiment proposed partial decoding algorithm with All-
Intra (AI) and Random Access (RA) configuration and 
compare the performance of proposed algorithm with 
subsampled and decoded video sequences in Table III. 
TABLE III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Experimental results of proposed algorithm are showed in 
Table III. Luminance Peak Signal To Noise Ratio (Y-
PSNR) results are average values when quantization 
parameters are 22, 27, 32 and 37. We have observed the 
PSNR loss is more severe when QP is higher because of 
blocking artifact. Also, in case of small video sequences 
(class D, E), the blurring effect occurred since the length of 
DCT-based interpolation becomes longer. The error 
propagation occurs under RA configuration by inter 
predicted pictures.
