Abstract - Wind speed forecasting is an essential 
prerequisite for the planning, operation, and maintenance 
works associated with wind energy engineering. This paper 
attempts to forecast fluctuations based only on observed wind 
data using the data-driven artificial neural network approach. 
Wind fluctuations with varying lead times ranging from a half 
year to a full year are predicted at Al-Hijana, Syria with the 
pre-preparation for the available data. Two layers of feed-
forward back-propagation networks were used along with the 
conjugate gradient algorithm and other tested training 
functions.  The results show that artificial neural network 
models perform extremely well as low values of errors 
resulting between the measured and predicted data are 
obtained. The present work contributes to previous work in 
the field of wind energy independent power producer market 
and may be of significant value to Syria, considering that the 
country is currently in the process of transitioning into a free 
energy market. It is likely that this modeling approach will 
become a useful tool to enable power producer companies to 
better forecast or supplement wind speed data. Two main types 
of wind speed prediction tool is discussed in this paper. One 
prediction tool with no time shift and the other prediction tool 
with time shift, where in the second type two different time 
periods were used to show the different between long term 
prediction and short term prediction.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The wind-energy spread usage in recent years is an 
attempt to address the environmental problems that result 
from the consumption of energy and especially from nuclear 
power plant disasters like the one that recently occurred in 
Fukushima, Japan [1]. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change) indicated that [2] human activities are 
directly related to increased atmospheric levels of 
greenhouse 
gasses, 
i.e., 
carbon 
dioxide, 
methane, 
chlorofluocarbons, and carbon monoxide. Additionally, a 
correlation also exists between global warming involving 
greenhouse gas and environmental problems. It is generally 
agreed that of those harmful greenhouse gasses, carbon 
dioxide contributes the most to global warming. The main 
artificial source of carbon dioxide discharge is derived from 
fossil fuels (conventional power plants). Therefore, much 
recent research has focused on reducing the consumption of 
fossil 
fuels 
and 
replacing 
those 
with 
renewable, 
environment-friendly energy sources. Currently, wind 
energy is considered as one of the most promising energy 
sources. However, since wind is difficult to manage, 
generating wind energy is still a challenge. Due to a variety 
of factors, the wind speed characteristic curve can change 
with time, location and height. Wind blows as a result of an 
imbalance in the quantity of heat on the earth by the energy 
from the sun.  Experimentally, it is known that wind speed 
is intermittent, irregular, and frequently fluctuates in the 
short term. Since wind energy is directly related to the cubic 
value of the wind speed, any changes in the wind speed will 
greatly impact the amount of the energy.  In order to better 
support the transition to a free energy market, a more 
accurate means of estimating the energy generated from the 
wind farm and pumped in the grid is needed.  
This paper thus introduces an ANN (Artificial Neural 
Networks) for wind speed predictions to estimate the wind 
speed in a suggested location in Syria that involves two 
main approaches. 
1- 
No time shift approach. 
2- 
Time shift approach: which contain: 
a. 
A one year prediction tool (old 
approach – long term-). 
b. A half year prediction tool (new 
approach, see the next point -3- ). 
3- 
Time shift new approach (short term): is 
suggested in is work as result of analysis the 
outputs generated from the previous tools. 
 
Also, the different possible ways that can be used in order to 
improve the prediction output (e.g., choosing different 
training functions, which are introduced by Matlab). This 
paper also introduces a model for energy estimation using 
the output of the wind speed prediction tool as an input for 
the energy model. Using the Matlab computing program for 
building the suggested ANN is one of the future computing 
methods for wind prediction. 
Finally the steps needed for building the suggested wind 
speed prediction tool & the energy module are presented in 
the same order as done is this research, from the part of 
getting the row data and analyzing the importance of every 
used input using speerman analysis, till getting the final 
results obtained from the energy module. A suggestion for 
new approach is ales presented in this paper for predicting

the wind speed (with time shift) taking into consideration 
the unexpected changes in the wind speed function 
 
 
Figure 1. Prediction techniques 
 
Figure 1 shows the different prediction techniques used in 
the wind energy field. The physical module in wind energy 
prediction section is not discussed in this paper and the 
variable time prediction technique is the time shift tool (old 
and new approach). The constant time range is the not time 
shift approach.    
II. WIND SPEED PREDICTION TECHNIQUES  
In this part a detailed description will be illustrated for 
the actual steps used in this research in order to build an 
acceptable wind speed prediction tool using the artificial 
neural networks approach.   
A. state of the art 
The wind speed characteristic can be considered a non-
linear fluctuation. Therefore, the forecasting of this function 
using 
traditional 
methods 
(e.g., 
numerical 
weather 
prediction (NWP) which is used in Germany nowadays) can 
be very difficult and time consuming. In this case, the 
intelligent engineering represented by a neural network, a 
chaos fractal, and a genetic algorithm, etc. can be applied. 
While these techniques are already adopted in numerical 
predictions, the usage of the ANN gives a better 
performance in terms of pattern recognition and finding 
location peculiarities, especially when information on the 
used wind turbine and power curve is given [3]. That is why 
the focus in this work will be on developing an acceptable 
wind speed prediction tool using ANN’s and showing the 
different possibilities of sizing this tool with a new approach 
for minimizing the errors resulting from the used prediction 
tool.  
 
B. The usage of the proposed wind speed prediction tool 
There are two different types of wind speed predictions 
[4]:  
The vertical wind speed prediction or the prediction of 
the expected wind speed curve in one point on the 
geographical map with different height. This can be seen, 
for example, when the wind measurement device is at a 
height of 40 m and the wind turbine is installed in the same 
location yet in a different hub height like 105 m 
The horizontal wind speed prediction or the prediction 
of the expected wind speed curve in one point on the 
geographical map that has a horizontal difference from the 
point of measured data. This is witnessed when the wind 
measurement device is in one location and the wind turbine 
is installed in another location (top of a mountain where the 
measurement is very difficult to be obtained) [5].  
In both cases the no time shift tool can be used in order 
to get the predicted wind speed at the height of the used 
wind turbine in a new location with no available 
measurements. In this tool it is enough to know the pressure 
and temperature of a nearby location (not at the same place 
of the location of interest). 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Wind speed prediction and energy module connections 
                 
The historical wind data shown in Figure 2 indicates that 
the atmospheric parameter measurements such as the 
pressure and temperature that were available for the location 
in our case. The energy historical data indicates a previous 
energy output for a previous wind turbine installed in the 
location of interest, which was not available in our case (as 
this was the first wind farm to be installed in this location).  
Finally a wind prediction tool was built in order to 
predict the wind speed in locations where no wind speed 
measurement devices are available which means to predict 
the wind speed from the available data of a specific site 
(Like pressure, temperature …etc.). In this case no time 
shift is introduced, which mean that the prediction is done 
for the measured data for the same time.    
   
C. Feed Forward Neural Network with Backpropogation 
A neural network is a computational structure that 
resembles a biological neuron. It can be defined as a 
150

“massively parallel distributed processor made up of 
storing processing units, which has a natural propensity for 
storing experimental knowledge and making it available for 
use” [6]. 
A feed-forward neural network consists of layers.  Every 
layer will be connected to the previous once with more than 
one connection that has a weight to determine the 
importance of this connection. Every network has at least 
three layers.  These include the input layer, output layer, and 
the hidden layer(s). The strength of a set of inputs can be 
determined by the activation function after adding the whole 
input signals as shown in Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3.  Basic structure of a neuron [6] 
 
The raw data was provided in a form of Excel file. 
Patterns were generated and a statistical analysis performed 
to get a good correlation among the input values. Some data 
was fed as an input in the prediction network for training 
purposes while other data was specifically employed for 
network testing purposes. 
The following steps were taken to get the wind speed 
prediction: 
1- Data Acquisition & Pre-processing. 
2- Data conversion & Normalization. 
3- Statistical Analysis.  
4- Design of the Neural Network &Training. 
5- Testing. 
D. Data Acquisition,  Pre-processing, and Data 
Conversion 
The different weather parameter values were collected 
from the used measurement devices in the location of 
interest [7]. Time series was provided for every ten minutes 
with the help of the Syrian National Energy Center for 
Research and Development.  The values of three different 
parameters 
were 
utilized 
to 
include 
the 
pressure, 
temperature and wind direction as shown in Table I. 
 
 
TABLE I.         LIST OF NETWORK PARAMETERS[8] 
 
 
During the data acquisition stage, the maximum value 
among 
each 
parameter 
was 
computed 
after 
that 
normalization was carried out for all the used parameters 
[9].  
During the visit to the Syrian National Energy Center we 
have learned that not in all cases a wind speed data is 
available, which means that sometimes it is needed to 
predict the wind speed from the available information in 
location of interest, that is why a scenario of wind speed 
prediction tool with no time shift is introduced and 
compared with that used for wind speed prediction with 
time (the ANN is trained with the available wind speed data 
and get as a results the wind speed for the next year or six 
months).   
E. Statistical Analysis 
Since the amount of available data is massive and the 
characteristic curve of the wind speed continually changes 
with time, a statistical analysis is needed in order to measure 
the extent of the relationship between each of the 
meteorological values and to get rid of the redundant values 
that might be present in the data set. Therefore, a 
“Spearman rank correlation” was applied. The amount of 
correlation in a sample (of data) is measured by the sample 
coefficient of correlation, generally denoted by ‘r’ or by ‘ ’. 
This analysis is very important for the “no time shift 
scenario”. The results of this analysis can determine, which 
data are a must for the wind speed prediction tool (As input) 
and which data have a secondary effect on the output of the 
prediction tool. As a result of this analysis the measurement 
devices that should be installed in any location can be 
determined.  
F. Spearman’s Correlation 
Spearman’s correlation allows testing the direction and 
strength of a relationship [10]. For example the relationship 
between the pressure and the wind speed will be shown (one 
of the inputs of the prediction tool and the output) to help 
determine the importance of this parameter on the output of 
the prediction.  This in turn can give a good vision of the 
expected output of the suggested ANN tool. This approach 
can also be applied to problems in which data cannot be 
measured quantitatively but in which a qualitative 
assessment is possible. In this case, the best individual is 
151

given rank number 1, the next rank 2, etc. (In our case the 
highest wind speed, which is the rated wind speed for the 
wind turbine in which the wind turbine generate its rated 
power in kW, will get the rank number 1). 
The correlation coefficient takes values between [1,-1]. 
A value of /1/ indicates that the relationship between the 
two different parameters is very strong and has a positive 
effect (when “X” increases, “Y” value will also increase). 
The value/-1/ has the same strength meaning of /1/ yet the 
relation is inverse. A value of /0/ means that no relationship 
exists between the two different studied parameters.  
Steps for achieving a Spearman’s ranking: 
A- Rank both sets of data from highest to lowest value 
(make sure to check for tied ranks - readings of the 
same value and to obtain the same sequence of 
readings). 
B- Subtract the two sets of ranking data to get the 
difference /d/. 
C- Square the values of /d/. 
D- Add up the squared values of the differences. 
E- Calculate the values using Spearman’s Ranking 
Formula [10]:  
 
               
     
 (    )                       (1)  
Table II shows the results obtained from this analysis for   
one year data (2008). It can be seen that the pressure has an 
inverse influence on the wind speed and that the temperature 
has an indirect effect on the wind speed through an inverse 
relationship with the pressure [11].  
 
TABLE II.   SPEARMEN’S RANKING RESULTS FOR 2008 
 
 
Figure 4 gives a statistical analysis for 6 years of 
available data.  The figure can be used to clarify the results 
obtained from the prediction tool as it shows that the 
atmospheric parameters and the character curve of the wind 
speed changes on a yearly basis. The information obtained 
from Spearmen’s ranking can help determine which data 
should be selected as training data in order to contain the 
best possible situation and get better prediction results for 
this specific location. What is more it can be noted that the 
pressure has the most direct influence on the wind speed so 
it should be used as an input for the prediction tool in any 
case (with or without time shift scenarios). Although the 
temperature has no big effect on the wind speed as the 
pressure it still should be included in the wind prediction 
tool as it has a good effect on the pressure. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Spearman’s analysis 
 
It is important to mention that some ANN tool uses a 
“helping function”. The helping function is normally 
determined by carrying out a statistical analysis (in our case 
speerman). This helping function works as pre-determining 
function, which will help the ANN tool by telling what the 
expected output should look like avoiding unexpected 
outputs by the ANN tool. Unfortunately this approach was 
not used in this work as the purpose of this work was to get 
the differences of using different internal parameters used in 
the ANN tool itself (e.g. Training functions, number of 
neurons, number of the hidden layers, Activation functions, 
…etc.).      
G. Design of the Neural Network & Training 
Designing the neural network means sizing the network 
in order to fit our need. Unfortunately, there is currently no 
mathematical equation for sizing the network or determining 
which training functions to use [12]. Thus, engineers often 
rely on trial and error and personal experience to solve these 
issues. In our case, the sizing of the number of hidden 
layers, training functions, activation functions, number of 
neurons in the hidden layers, and determining the best 
training input pattern was accomplished through trial and 
error and, as shown in Figure 5, a comparison of the results. 
Finally, 2 hidden layers with feed forward activity were 
chosen (as the differences in the results between 2 and 3 
hidden layers were very small and neglectable see Table III 
in comparison to Table IX ). 
 
TABLE III.  RMS VALUES WHEN USING 3 HIDDEN LAYER PREDICTION TOOL 
 
 
Using the back propagation algorithm in each training 
set, the weights were modified in order to reduce the root 
mean squared error (deviation) (RMSE/D/) between the 
predicted values and the actual readings as target values. 
Thus, the modification takes place in the reverse direction

from the output layer until the terminating condition is 
reached. The steps are: 
 
Initialize the weights. 
 
Propagate the inputs forward. 
 
Back propagate the error. 
 
Terminating condition. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Deviation of predicted and measured wind speed for 2008 
 
Figure 5 shows both the predicted wind speed and the 
measured wind speed for the year 2008. It is clear that in 
some points the measured wind speed takes a drastic change 
is speed (between X=2000 and X=3000 on the time axis in 
Figure 5) that the prediction tool did not expect, in this case 
a helping function can be useful to correct the prediction 
tool results. 
H. Testing 
Testing is the final stage needed to finalize the proposed 
wind speed prediction tool. While different methods can be 
used to evaluate the results obtained from the prediction 
tool, in this case the Mean Square Error method was used 
[13].  
 
TABLE IV.   RMSE OF THE WIND PREDICTION TOOL WITH DIFFERENT 
INPUT POSSIBILITIES FOR DIFFERING YEARS. 
 
 
TABLE V.   RMSE OF THE WIND PREDICTION TOOL WITH DIFFERENT 
TRAINING DATA FOR DIFFERING YEARS. 
 
 
TABLE VI.  RMSE OF THE DIFFERENT YEARS WIND PREDICTION TOOL WITH 
DIFFERENT TRAINING FUNCTIONS. 
 
 
The previous tables give the results of the differing 
sizing possibilities that can be used for the prediction tool.  
It can be seen that the usage of the pressure, temperature 
and wind direction as inputs for the prediction tool is more 
effective than using each parameter alone.  Also, the 2007-
2008 input data gives better results than the 2006-2007 data 
because the MSE is better in the first case. After 
determining which training data to be used as input for the 
suggested prediction tool, different training functions are 
tested in order to see which training function results in the 
lowest RMS values. The next step will be to determine the 
activation function which is very important to determine 
which input summation is enough to get a high output 
values. More information about the different training 
function and activation function can be found in Matlab 
help, with a definition of the different properties of every 
function. 
The results for using the “no time shift scenario” are as 
follows:

ACTIVATION FUCNTIONS. 
 
 
TABLE VIII.  RMSE OF THE WIND PREDICTION TOOL WITH 
DIFFERENT TRAINING FUCNTIONS. 
 
 
TABLE IX.  RMSE OF THE WIND PREDICTION TOOL WITH 
DIFFERENT TRAINING DATA. 
 
 
It is clear from the above tables that the RMS errors of a 
wind speed prediction tool without time shift is better than 
the one done with time shift, which lead to the conclusion 
that the same tool can be used for both type of prediction

(with or without time shift with acceptable errors). 
The most important conclusion that can be driven from 
the data in the previous tables is that if the error to be 
reduced a new approach is needed in order to overcome the 
errors generated from the unaccounted character changes of 
the wind speed. In this new approach is to take only half a 
year into account. Also this half year was divided among 
collecting testing (or validation) data and training data.  The 
half year period was divided into days, with one day 
allocated for training and the next one for testing and so on 
as shown in Figure 6. 
 
 
Figure 6.  The new wind prediction tool (Tr= training, Ts= testing). 
  
The new approach can be described as a short term 
prediction tool with a nonconventional way of selecting the 
training and testing data. The old approach can be described 
as a conventional long term approach.  
Figure 7 compares the results of the old approach with 
the results of the new one.  The first two columns shows the 
results of the old approach along with the best results from 
the different input data and training data respectively ( 
shown in the previous RMS results tables) , and the second 
two columns show the same results but for the new 
approach.  An error of /RMSD=0.0449/ was obtained. 
 
 
Figure 7.  The error reduction due to the usage of the new approach. 
 
Although the results shown in Figure 7 only describe 
one year (2008), if applied to more than one year as shown 
in Figure 8 it can be seen that the RMSD for the old 
approach is better than the new approach. However, since 
the purpose of this research is for energy calculations and 
the energy market (in other words, for engineering not 
meteorological applications -short term prediction is enough 
in this case-) the approach needs to have a very small value 
of error. For this reason, the new approach can be 
considered more effective in this situation as shown in 
Figure 5 or Figure 9, which show the deviation between the 
measured and predicted wind speed using the old and new 
approach respectively.  
It should be mentioned that in the European energy 
market a 4 day wind energy prediction is needed and 
considered as a short term prediction period. Every grid 
operator should be able to provide the expected available 
energy for the next day in order to finish the bidding on the 
energy soled amount (this process normally takes one day).      
 
 
Figure 8.  Comparison of the RMSE for the old and new approach for 
differing years. 
 
Thus the usage of proposed prediction tool has a great 
influence on the selection of which scenario to work with.

approach using the preasure, the temperature and the wind speed diraction 
as an input. 
 
When comparing the different prediction scenario’s 
results (with time shift and without time shift) in Figure 8 
and Figure 11, it can be seen that the RMS values of the not 
time shift scenario are lower than the other one for the 
whole year range which lead to the conclusion that the used 
input variables (pressure, temperature) are good enough for 
getting a reliable output (wind speed). Those results were 
also compared with the WASP program calculation for the

wind speed with a result of /RMS=0.004/ (as the WASP 
program uses NWP module in order to calculate the vertical 
wind speed difference between the measurement mass and 
the wind park selected location).

program 
 
 The difference in the location between the measurement 
mass and the wind park is clear in Figure 10, which shows 
the map of wind park location in Syria using the WASP 
program for calculating the expected energy output from the 
suggested wind park.    
 
 
Figure 11. The best errors values that are resulting from using different 
training fucntion and training data and activation fucntion . 
 
The best training function selection is done by 
comparing the regression figures of the different training 
functions, like in Figure 12 where the fit line shows the 
trend line of training, validation, testing and all. The more 
the trend line is adjacent to the orange line (Y=T) the better 
prediction results can be obtained from the ANN prediction 
tool. The dotted line presents the case where the output 
results of the ANN tool are the same of with the target data 
which mean the best case scenario for the prediction tool. 
  
 
Figure 12. The best errors values that are resulting from using different 
training fucntion and training data and activation fucntion 
 
Finally it should be mentioned that comparing Figure 9, 
which shows a comparison between measured wind speed 
values and the predicted one for the new approach, and 
Figure 5, which shows the same information for the old 
approach, for the same time interval (e.g. same moth) will 
reveal the fact that the new approach give a better output 
results. And it is also necessary to emphasis that the 
prediction errors can fall into two main categories: 
1- Amplitude errors: This type of error results from 
the difference between the predicted wind speed 
value and measured wind speed value for the same 
point of time (same point on the x-axis). 
2- Time shift errors: This type of error results from 
the difference between two wind speed points with 
the same value.(different X-axis /time/ values but 
the same Y-axis /wind speed in m/s/ values). 
The second type of errors is more critical compared to 
the first one. As the results of this prediction will be used 
after that to determine the available energy that can be 
produced, which in its turn will be sold in an energy market. 
Assuming that the first type of errors (Amplitude errors) 
appears during a real time situation the conserved energy 
should be able to cover the difference (this is the case in 
European energy market) yet if the other type of errors 
accurse in a real time situation it might result in a complete 
black out as the preserved energy may not be able to cover

difference in energy values (Y-axis /wind speed that results 
eventually in Energy/ has a big difference in values 
(Amplitude) at the same time point on the x-axis that is not 
expected and not taken into consideration during the biding 
period done earlier) that is not considered. 
  
 
Figure 13. Measured and predicted wind speed for 2008 using the new 
approach and wind speed as input data 
 
In other words, it is difficult to overcome an unexpected 
shortage in the energy (Like, in the second error type) than 
to overcome an expected value of shortage in the energy 
(Like, in the first error type). Figure 13 is a good example 
for showing the time shift error, which occur between X=0  
and X=500 s. it was expected (predicted) that we will have 
about Y= 10 m/s wind speed but in realty we got only Y=8 
m/s this difference will be tripled in the energy point of 
view and in its turn will result is some kind of problem to 
the Grid operator when no enough reserved energy is 
available to cover this difference.       
I. Energy Module 
After getting acceptable results as an output from the 
previously built prediction tool, those results are used as an 
input for the energy module. Figure 14 shows the suggested 
energy model, which has the following components: 
1. A signal Builder: contains the predicted wind 
speed data.  
2. Lookup Table: contains the power curve data of 
the used power turbine [14]. 
3. Integrator: is used to get the output energy from 
the wind turbine [15]. 
4. Scope: is used to show the results in Figure 14. 
5. Display: is used to show the accumulated value 
of the energy. 
 
 
Figure 14.  Block diagram of the energy module. 
 
Putting the previous component together give us the 
energy which can be produced by the used turbine. As the 
energy is the area under the power curve of an electrical 
generation unit. The integration of the power function over a 
certain time period can result with the energy generated in 
the same time period. The energy calculated in this module 
results from the integration of the combined wind speed data 
(one input is the predicted values and the other input is the 
measured values) and the power curve of the used wind 
turbine (in order to make sure that  only the useful wind 
speed values will result in the corresponding power).   
Vestas Wind System /V90/ was selected as the working 
wind turbine with a 90 m rotor diameter, 105 m height, and 
2 MW power [8]. Figure 15 shows the power curve of this 
wind turbine. 
 
 
Figure 15.  Power curve of V90 wind turbine. 
 
Using all of above information, the energy can be 
obtained as shown in Figure 16 where the error is tripled 
due to the relation between the energy and the cubic wind 
speed.   For this reason, the error of the predicted wind 
speed should be at its minimum with no time deviation 
errors [16][17].

Figure 16.  The difference between the energy calculated from the 
predicted and measured wind speed 
 
It is important to mention here, that integrating the wind 
turbine curve in the energy module helped to avoid using 
the yield energy equation from the wind speed ( the energy 
equation [17]) where other parameters like the density of the 
air is not included.  
III. CONCLUSION 
As a conclusion of this work it is observed that the 
prediction errors can be reduced by the usage of same 
characteristic properties of the predicted wind speed and 
that in its turns will lead to less errors in the Energy module 
(the error of the energy is cubical to the wind speed errors 
due to the cubic relationship between the Energy and the 
wind speed). More understanding of the data lead to better 
results in the prediction tool that is why spearman’s analysis 
is an important method of determining the strength of 
connection between the different data used as input to get 
the output of the prediction tool. Finally, the short term 
prediction helps of reducing the errors in the prediction tool 
and also the work load on the computing device. 
From all the information presented in this work it can be 
concluded that the time shift wind speed prediction tool is 
used in order to estimate the wind speed changes in the 
future in the location where the measurement is available. 
After that the no time shift wind speed prediction tool can 
be used to transfer these results from the previous tool to the 
location of interest and the height of the wind turbine’s hub. 
Finally those results can be used as input for the energy 
module which in its turn will results in the estimated energy 
that will be generated from the chosen wind turbine in the 
future (the same time interval as the one predicted by the 
time shift wind speed prediction tool).
