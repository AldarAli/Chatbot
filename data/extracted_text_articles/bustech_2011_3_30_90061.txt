Abstract - The design process is a critical component in 
competitive product development and in the industrial 
innovation process.  The work reported in the paper tries to 
map the different patterns of design engineering practices as 
industrial innovation indicators as they occur in firms 
located within the National Capital Region (NCR) of India 
representing New Delhi and its surrounding regions and 
highlights the role of developing suitable indicators to tap 
specific design engineering practices and the network 
linkages. The results indicate that majority of firms 
possessing a separate design department exhibit a better 
appreciation of what constitutes a successful innovation and 
follow it up by formulating design engineering agreements 
with a networked partner simultaneous to marketing, service 
or R&D arrangements, and also that firms with more open 
cooperation with the outside research environments almost 
always have been more technically successful in designing 
new products.

1. INTRODUCTION 
   National governments in many countries launch specific 
schemes in order to promote innovative activities in the 
manufacturing sectors like providing fiscal incentives for 
research and development (R&D) and quality control [1, 
2, 3]. This is especially true for developing countries like 
India.  Such schemes are often monitored through 
indicators devised for this purpose.   
 
   The significance of the term design, its definition, its 
conceptual construct, and also the critical role it plays in 
innovation policy framework, are increasingly being 
recognized [4, 6, 8, 9, 10]. A very concise definition of 
design describes it as a creative process by which product 
innovations and ideas are reduced to an economically 
viable arrangement, this arrangement being set down on 
paper as a proper schedule. The concept of economic 
viability can be expanded to include (i) the economic 
objective; (ii) a product to meet that objective; (iii) how 
effectively the product meets the economic objective; (iv) 
how well the product work; (v) how the product can be 
made; (vi) hence, how much the product will cost to 
make; and (vii) what the product will cost to maintain. 
When a firm moves into new product areas and 
technologies, and as the firm’s competitive context

that engineering design has a strong relationship with the 
management practices being adopted for successful 
innovation, and plays a significant part in improving the 
competitiveness of products or firms [4, 5]. Li and Boyle 
[6] presents review of papers published in the Journal of 
Engineering Design from 2007-2008 probing the 
perspectives, 
challenges 
and 
recent 
advances 
in 
engineering design. 
 
   The aforementioned discussion clearly brings into focus 
the imperative and the need to bring design, consciously, 
within the framework of an innovation policy. A 
manufacturing firm that seeks to compete effectively in 
the market needs to formulate and implement innovation-
based strategies where design forms an integral part, for 
instance, in developing new products and in meeting 
customer satisfaction, but empirical or theoretical research 
on design engineering practices as indicators of industrial 
innovation have been few.  The work reported in the 
present paper aims to fill this gap.  The study attempts to 
map the different patterns of design engineering as are 
being practiced in the firms located within the National 
Capital Region (NCR) of India, meaning New Delhi and 
its surrounding areas. After a thorough review of the 
literature in the next section, methods employed and the 
data sources have been explained in the following section.  
The last two sections deal with the results of the analysis 
and the broad conclusions of the study, respectively. 
 
2. DESIGN 
IN 
THE 
CONTEXT 
OF 
INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION 
   When a firm moves into new product areas and 
technologies, and as the firm’s competitive context 
becomes 
less 
predictable 
and 
more 
complex, 
communication between the firm and the world outside 
will increase. Kalogerakis, Luthje, and Herstatt [7] report 
a work where in-depth interviews were carried out with 
project leaders of 18 design and engineering consulting 
firms located in Germany and Scandinavia in order to 
probe the links between design innovations and analogies. 
Other studies have highlighted that engineering design has 
a strong relationship with the management practices being 
adopted for successful innovation, and plays a significant 
part in improving the competitiveness of products, firms 
or even national economies [8, 9, 10].  In this regard, it

could be pertinent to mention that a special issue of the 
International Journal of Production Research on data 
mining applications in engineering design, manufacturing 
and logistics was brought out in the year 2006 [11].  There 
is also the issue of outsourcing the engineering design 
process by a firm.  The limits of design and engineering 
outsourcing in product development, and the sources of 
these limits have been a subject of debate [12]. About 100 
research papers and 30 commercial systems/international 
standards launched have been reviewed in terms of 
underlying 
algorithms, 
mechanisms 
and 
system 
architectures with a view to focus on research being 
carried out to develop methodologies and technologies to 
support geographically dispersed teams to organise 
collaborative design based on the quickly evolving 
information technologies [13].    
 
  The role of design engineering becomes very critical in 
cases where the project requires too advanced a 
technology and/or the transition to manufacturing is 
complex and requires very large scale-up. This is typically 
true for technology transfer agreements from the national 
R&D laboratories to the industries. The products and the 
processes are found to be most satisfactory in the bench-
scale on lab-scale work but in the commercial scale 
operations, these often fail to live up to the expectations 
and the innovative efforts might lead to a failure [14, 15, 
16, 17].  The issues raised, therefore, focus on identifying 
appropriate customers and working closely with them 
[18].  
 
   Other studies have highlighted the significance of 
design in the innovation process and the criticality of 
recognizing the same. By focusing on the environmental 
impacts of the electronics industry, the perspectives for 
design for environment have been debated [19].  In a 
separate study of 203 new products - both winners and 
losers that were launched into the market place - three 
hypothesized factors, all of them directly or indirectly 
related to design were found to be most significantly 
related to design new product success [20]. The factors 
were 
(i) 
product 
advantage 
(ii) 
proficiency 
of 
predevelopment activities, and (iii) protocol, including 
product concept, specifications and requirements. Among 
recent works in the Indian context, a case study was 
carried out in an Indian manufacturing organization for 
probing the role of computer aided design and engineering 
as enablers of agile manufacturing [21]. In the same vein, 
engineering firms in Thailand have been probed to 
propose a decision support methodology for the 
development and application of product eco-design, with 
special reference to their use in these firms [22].  
 
   Information about the user's needs helps to clarify the 
firm's activity. A firm that has achieved a through 
understanding of the needs of the buyer can use the 
knowledge to guide innovative effort. A firm that faces a 
technology adoption decision engage in an extension 
effort reduce uncertainty associated with that decision 
[23], and information about the buyer is an important part 
of this exercise. In situations where the clarity of 
innovation objectives is higher, the firm is expected to be 
more willing to engage in innovation. The information-
seeking networks of marketing managers are closely tied 
to sources that clarify the customer's needs. When a firm 
moves into new product areas and technologies, and as the 
firm’s competitive context becomes less predicable and 
more complex, communications between the firm and the 
world outside will increase [24].   
 
   It has been observed that one of the most important 
factors affecting the competitiveness of American 
manufacturing sectors is the long-standing neglect of 
engineering design [25]. The authors assert the following: 
(i) in terms of long-range strategy, the factors of cost, 
quality and time-to-market are design problems more than 
manufacturing problems; (ii) market loss by US 
companies is due to design deficiencies more than 
manufacturing deficiencies; (iii) manufacturing process 
themselves are designed; (iv) many technical problems 
commonly associated with manufacturing process are 
traceable to design problems; and (v) opportunities to 
surpass foreign competitors are best found in engineering 
design.  Spitas [26] has reported a work carried out 
through a questionnaire-based survey of design engineers 
to evaluate the industry’s perception and use of systematic 
design paradigms.  
 
   As already mentioned, a particular new product failure 
might act as the seed for the germination of successful 
redesigned product. The design process is an important 
stage in new product development.  Based on graph 
theory and the weighting concept, a quantified design 
structure matrix (a systematic planning method of 
optimizing design priorities and product architecture for 
managing product variety from an informational structure 
perspective) has been presented in the literature [27]. In 
another study, the relationship between different retail 
channel structures and channel strategies (for instance, an 
exclusive channel strategy) and the engineering design of 
a new product, conditional on consumer preference 
distributions and competitor product attributes have been 
examined [28]. Even other researchers have emphasized 
that by and large designs are modifications from previous 
products and lessons learned from earlier designs can be 
beneficial when developing new products [29]. Based on 
the example of a new generation of diesel engine design, 
the authors have shown how the ability to predict change 
propagation can guide designers through conceptual 
design allowing them to analyse design alternatives and 
foresee potential problems arising from the product 
architecture.

3. METHODS/DATA 
   For the study, a stratified sample out of a population of 
industrial concerns operating within the National Capital 
Region (NCR) of India has been considered. Data were 
collected from 53 firms operating within the NCR of 
varying 
annual turnover, size and 
belonging 
to 
automobiles, 
engineering, 
chemicals/pharmaceuticals/textiles, 
and 
electrical/electronics sectors. A questionnaire, formulated 
on our preliminary understanding of the innovation 
process, was later modified with inputs from a pilot 
survey to be used in the later part of field investigations. 
The responses were subject to detailed analysis in terms 
of dimensions like design objectives, sources of 
information, network partners in the design processes, etc.   
 
   The analysis has been carried out in various stages to 
bring out the critical importance of design engineering in 
industrial innovation, and the factors related to the success 
of innovative efforts. Category 1 (numbering 23) firms 
refer to those firms that have a separate design department 
while Category 2 (numbering 30) firms have no separate 
design department.   
 
4. RESULTS 
   Table 1 presents the total value of machinery as a 
percentage of gross turnover of the firms.   Set against the 
importance of establishing and running a separate design 
engineering department in a firm, it is observed from the 
Table that this percentage value is 15.58% for firms with 
a separate design department that is substantially lower as 
compared to 33.59% for firms without a separate design 
department. On a closer examination, it is found that this 
difference is most conspicuous for small (up to INR 20 
million turnover) and very large firms (a turnover of 
higher than INR 200 million) where 45 INR=1 USD. 
     
   Further analysis has been carried out separately for 
Category 1 and Category 2 firms.  
 
   Table 2 presents the extent of database maintenance by 
different industrial sectors.  It is observed from this Table 
that except for the chemicals and pharmaceutical sector 
industries, all others maintain engineering databases to a 
reasonable extent.

   On the contrary, formulation databases are not 
maintained to any significant extent by any industrial 
sector.  Although all the sectors maintain manufacturing 
databases, the percentage of firms maintaining such a 
database is indeed very high for the automobile sector 
(77.36%). 
 
   This sector exhibits a similar response regarding 
maintenance of inventory databases that otherwise are 
also maintained by engineering sector industries to a fair 
extent but not by chemicals/pharmaceuticals and 
electrical/electronics sector industries.  Significantly, 
marketing databases are not maintained by automobiles 
and engineering sectors and these are maintained only to a 
limited extent by the other sectors.  
  
   Table 3 presents the design objectives of the firms (first 
choice objectives). It is found that for firms possessing a 
design department (category 1 firms), meeting unique 
demands of the customer is the predominant design 
objective (79.2%) whereas reliability (13.9%) is also 
important. For firms without a separate design department 
(category 2 firms), the predominant first choice design 
objective is meeting unique customer demands whereas 
minimum consumption of materials and resources, 
surpassing 
the 
features 
of competitors’ products, 
ergonomics and ease of operation, optimality, and 
reliability are also relevant.  
 
   Table 4 presents the second choice design objectives. 
For the first category of firms, ensuring minimum 
consumption of materials and resources is the most 
important design objective. Other prominent design 
objectives for this category include ergonomics and ease 
of operation (21.0%), optimality (14.2%), and surpassing 
the features of competitors’ products (14.2%). For 
category 2 firms, the prominent ones include ease of 
manufacturing, surpassing the features of competitors’ 
products (that is, in fact common to both categories of 
firms), and minimum consumption of materials and 
resources but the most significant one is reliability (45%) 
of the designed product. 
 
A. Design and industrial innovation: Significance of 
networks 
   Table 5 through Table 8 help illustrate the significance 
of networks in technological innovation. Aspects of 
design engineering as industrial innovation indicators do 
not act in isolation but linked with other relevant actors. 
 
   Table 5 presents the first choice sources of information 
for the design function. For category 1 
firms, the marketing team is the most important source of 
information (60.7%) followed by dealers (32.2%). There 
are the only two prominent sources for this category of 
firms.

   For category 2 firms, this distribution is more 
widespread with marketing team (37.7%), dealers 
(13.2%), vendors/suppliers (18.8%), the service team 
(13.2%), and joint venture/network partner (13.2%) 
as important sources of information. 
 
   Table 6 presents the second choice sources of 
information for the design function.  Regarding this  
second choice, the important ones both for category 
1and 2 firms include the marketing team, the dealers, 
market surveys and the service team. The only 
additional sources of information of category 2 firms 
are the joint venture/network partners. 
 
   Table 7 displays what other agreements are 
simultaneous 
to 
a 
designing 
agreement 
or 
arrangement among firms and their network partners. 
The findings re-emphasize of a network approach for 
successful industrial innovation. For firms with a 
separate design department (category 1), the design 
agreements are often simultaneous to a marketing 
arrangement (36.4%), servicing/training arrangement 
(36.4%), R&D arrangement (42.2%), and design 
engineering arrangement (42.2%). For category 2 
firms, all these arrangements (except marketing 
arrangement) are at times entered into but much less 
frequently (15%). 
 
   Illustrating this network approach further, Table 8 
points out that among all the network partners of a 
firm, except for joint venture partner/technical 
collaborators, all others take part in the design of the 
prototypes for category 1 firms.  For such firms, the 
in-house design departments are most of the time 
doing this job (75.0%), though there are other 
categories too like the business associates/partners 
(25.0%), the engineering consultants (25.0%), R&D 
or software consultants (16.6%), and even outsiders 
(32.3%). For category 2 firms as well, the prototypes 
are mostly designed in-house (38.1%) but this 
percentage is much lower than that for firms which 
do possess a separate design department.  Others who 
design the prototypes include the joint venture 
partners/technological collaborators (19.0%), and 
outsiders (19.0%). 
 
5. CONCLUSION 
   The study thus highlights the critical aspects of the 
design process as industrial innovation indicators.  
These results can be related to some other studies on 
different aspects of the design process.  Reference 
could be made to the results of a study conducted in a 
medium-sized aerospace company according to 
which the percentage of time spent by engineers in 
different activities had a high component of 
documentation (28.5%), solving thinking (28.0%), 
support and consulting (17.1%), and information 
gathering (13.7%) [27].  In yet another study, it was 
shown that competitiveness of a manufactured 
product can be improved by (i) good product design; 
(ii) product innovation, and (iii) production process 
improvements [28].  Their study results have also 
shown that product design could affect both price 
competition 
through 
design 
for 
economic 
manufacture and low life-cycle costs, and non-price 
competition, either through the technical design of 
the 
product 
itself 
to 
improve 
performance, 
appearance, quality, etc., or by taking into account 
associated service-related non-price factors.   
 
   The results of our study, similarly, are in line with 
the findings of another empirical study carried out 
that has shown that two main strategic dimensions are 
related to success in technically designing new 
products [29]. The first is the R&D orientation of the 
firm and the second is the technology use. The data 
shows that regardless of industry, firms with more 
open 
cooperation 
with 
the 
outside 
research 
environment, that is more external R&D strategies, 
almost always have been more technically successful 
in designing new products. Network positioning, 
gaining access to external information and assistance 
by having wide and flexible contacts with the 
external environment was, therefore, one of the most 
strategic variables in their analysis.  The results of 
our study corroborate the above and establish the 
significance of the network approach in formulating a 
design engineering policy for a firm that promotes 
industrial innovation.   
  
   The results of the study indicate that design 
engineering plays a critical role in fostering 
innovations in industrial firms.  It highlights the role 
of developing suitable indicators to tap specific 
design engineering practices, the network linkages, 
and what all factors need to be looked into while 
initiating policy measures to promote industrial 
innovation in the manufacturing sectors. It has been 
observed, for instance, that majority of firms 
possessing a separate DD exhibit a better appreciation 
of what constitutes a successful innovation and 
follow it up by formulating design engineering 
agreements with a networked partner simultaneous to 
marketing, service or R&D arrangements. The results 
have implications for formulating policies that seek to 
promote industrial innovation and the incentive 
schemes that go along with it.  Industrial innovation 
strategies in force at the national or local levels have 
largely overlooked the importance of design 
engineering in fostering industrial innovation and the 
process intricacies inherent in it.  The present study 
aims to do just that.  There is, therefore, a need for a 
55

more extensive empirical research on a larger sample 
size and spread over a larger geographical spread to 
further consolidate the insights gained from the 
present study.
