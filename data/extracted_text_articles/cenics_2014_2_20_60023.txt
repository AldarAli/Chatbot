Abstract—Excessive test power consumption is a great concern
in modern VLSI testing. This paper presents an efﬁcient scan-shift
power reduction scheme based on scan chain partitioning and
¯Q-D connection. After partitioning the scan chains into several
segments equally, selective ¯Q-D connection is introduced to re-
conﬁgure each segment, which only exploits the ¯Q output port of
the scan ﬂip-ﬂop and no additional hardware or routing overhead
will be introduced. Experimental results show that the proposal
can achieve 3.43% scan-shift power reduction on average with
the help of selective ¯Q-D reconnection after scan partitioning.
Furthermore, the proposed scan-shift power reduction technique
can be acceptable for Built-In Self-Test (BIST) and non-BIST
scan-based testing architecture without affecting test application
time, test fault coverage, performance and routing overhead of
the circuit under test.
Keywords—scan partition; ¯Q-D connection; low power test; scan-
shift power.
I.
INTRODUCTION
With the complexity and performance of very large scale
integrated (VLSI) circuits growing, the power consumption
density of advanced VLSI is rapidly increasing since the
supply voltage cannot be reduced so much due to its noise
margin [1]. Furthermore, power consumption in at-speed scan
testing is signiﬁcantly higher than that during normal func-
tional operation, while modern VLSI testing aims to perform
at-speed or even faster than at-speed testing to test the chip for
high-quality screening [2][3]. Therefore, the increasing power
consumption during testing has been a serious concern, which
can result in voltage drop, yield loss, reliability problems and
even heat damage of the Circuit Under Test (CUT) [4]–[6].
To address these problems, many testing power reduc-
tion methodologies have been proposed, such as X-ﬁlling
approaches which explore the reassignment of don’t care
bits in test cubes to reduce switch activities [7]–[9], low
power Test Pattern Generation (TPG) techniques that modify
the architecture of TPG like Linear Feedback Shift Register
(LFSR) to reduce the transitions of inputs of the CUT [10]–
[12], test vector reordering methods through changing the order
of the test vectors to reduce the number of transitions between
two consecutive vectors [13][14], and power-aware Automatic
Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) techniques [15][16], and so
on.
For scan-based testing, scan-shift power is deﬁned as the
dynamic power consumption dissipated by serial shift opera-
tions during scan-in of test stimuli and scan-out of responses,
while capture power is deﬁned as the power consumption
occurred in responses capturing mode [12][17]. Scan-shift
power can be effectively reduced by scan cells reordering,
which is one of the most attractive techniques to reduce scan-
in and scan-out transitions by rearranging every scan cell
with proper position [18][19]. However, this approach usually
costs excessive high routing hardware and computation time
according to the increasing number of scan cells. Selective
reconﬁgurable inverters are inserted between scan cells to
decrease the switching activities in the scan chains during shift
operation in [20], which is claimed to be suitable for any scan
architecture. Unfortunately, this technique not only requires
large area and control cost, but also inﬂuences the performance
of the CUT. Scan architecture modiﬁcation techniques through
modifying the scan architecture to reduce scan test power
by inserting gates or partitioning scan chains into several
segments [21]–[26]. Low power jump scan architecture is
utilized by Chiu and Li [21] to reduce test power with penalty
of speed performance degradation, while low power Illinois
scan architecture is proposed by Chandra et al. [22] to reduce
scan-in shift power but not suitable for decreasing the test
power dissipated during scan-out shift operation.
Scan partitioning/segmentation is another scan architecture
modiﬁcation technique, which divides a given scan chain
into several segments to cut down the shift process for full
scan chain into a sequence of segment-wise shifts [23][24].
Scan partitioning scheme with scan freeze ﬂip-ﬂops and status
registers is introduced by Kim et al. [23] to reduce the scan-
shift power consumption. The test application time of the
previous scheme will be raised since it requires additional test
clock cycles to scan-in the conﬁguration data stored in status
registers. In [24], the given scan chain is partitioned into s
segments, and only one segment is active during the scan shift
operations, while all other segments are clock gated in hold
mode to retain the scan test data. This approach is very efﬁcient
to reduce scan-shift power and can be applicable to Built-
In Self-Test (BIST) and non-BIST schemes without affecting
test application time, fault coverage, performance of the CUT
and/or the scan cell routing cost.
In this paper, we propose a scan-shift power reduction
scheme based on scan partition and ¯Q-D connection. After
evenly partitioned each scan chain into several segments
as in [24], ¯Q-D connection is introduced to reconnect two
consecutive scan cell for every segments, which will reduce
the scan-shift power further. The proposed scheme requires
no additional hardware with respect to [24] and keeps all
advantages of [24], which is suitable for BIST and non-BIST
test environments without penalty of test quality, performance
degradation or additional hardware of the CUT.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the scan-shift power metric and related works.
Section III presents the proposed scan-shift power reduction
scheme. The experimental results and comparison are shown
in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes this paper.

RELATED WORK
A. Scan-shift Power Metric
As mentioned above, scan-shift power is the dynamic
power consumption dissipated during shift operations, which
generally depends on the switching activity or transitions

Figure 1. Shift operations of original scan chain and partitioned scan
segments
occurred in the scan chain. Therefore, we utilize the widely
used Weighted Transition Metric (WTM) [27][28] for the scan-
shift power evaluation in this work. Scan-in power is the
dynamic power consumption dissipated during scan-in of test
stimuli, which can be calculated as (1), according to WTM
[27][28].
WTMin =
N
∑
i=1
[ L−1
∑
j=1
(ti,j ⊕ ti,j+1) × j
]
(1)
where N is the number of test vectors, L is the length of scan
chain and ti,j is the jth bit of test vector ti.
According to WTM [27][28], scan-out power can be
calculated as (2), which is the dynamic power consumption
dissipated during scan-in/out of test responses.
WTMout =
N
∑
i=1
[ L−1
∑
j=1
(ri,j ⊕ ri,j+1) × (L − j)
]
(2)
where N is the number of test vectors, L is the length of scan
chain and ri,j is the jth bit of test response ri.
Therefore, the total number of weighted transitions of
scan-shift power can be calculated as (3) according to WTM
[27][28], since it is the sum of scan-in power, scan-out power
and the total number of transitions between the MSB of the
previous test response and the LSB of current test vector, which
will propagate from the ﬁrst scan cell to the last in the scan
chains during scan-out operations.
WTM = WTMin +WTMout +
N−1
∑
i=1
(ti+1,L ⊕ri,1)×L (3)
where ti+1,L is the LSB of test vector ti+1, ri,1 is the MSB of
test response ri, and ri is the corresponding response of test
vector ti.
B. Scan Partition and Scan Hold
In [24], a low power scheme based on scan partition and
hold is proposed, which is shown in Figure 1. After equally
partitioning the scan chain into s segments, a multiplexer
is utilized to connect two consecutive segments and each
multiplexer is controlled by signal Cj (1 ≤ j ≤ s). During
scan shift operations, only single signal of Cj is set to high,
and the corresponding segment j is working in scan-in/out
operations, while others are hold in bypass state. Note that,
working in hold mode means that the scan cells of this segment
will retain their scan test data unless the corresponding control
signal Ck jumps to high. Therefore, the scan test data of every
segment only require to scan-in/out through itself after scan
chain partition and hold, while it need to shift through the
Figure 2. Example of selective ¯Q-D connection [25]
full scan chain until it arrive at the appropriate position before
scan partitioning. For example, if a transition exists between
the last two scan cells of the scan chain (Length = L) for
a test vector, this transition will propagate from the ﬁrst scan
cell to the L − 1 scan cell before utilizing the low power
scheme in [24], where it will cause L − 1 scan cell transitions
during scan-in operations. After partitioning the scan chain as
shown in Figure 1, this transition will only propagate through
the last segment, where only L/s − 1 scan cell transitions
will occur. Hence, the scheme in [24] can reduce the scan-
shift power signiﬁcantly without affecting test application time,
fault coverage, performance and/or the scan cell routing cost
of the CUT. Furthermore, this low power scheme can be easily
extended to multiple scan chains test architecture.
C. ¯Q-D Connection
Without introducing additional hardware and routing cost,
selectively replacing the Q-D connection with ¯Q-D connection
between two consecutive scan cells in the scan chain can
also reduce the switching activity during scan shift operations
effectively [25][26]. For example, assume the scan chain
include 6 scan cells and test vector t=110010 be applied to
the chain. If only the Q-D connection is utilized to chain all
scan cells, 11 transitions will occur in order to apply the test
vector t, as shown in Figure 2(a). However, if we selectively
conﬁgure the sub-chain of scan cells SFF2-SFF3, SFF4-SFF5
and SFF5-SFF6 with ¯Q-D connection, the reconﬁgured pattern
t’=111111 will be shifted into the scan chain instead to actually
apply the original test vector t to the CUT, where no transition
will occur during scan-in shift operations, as shown in Figure
2(b). It is obvious that, the scan-shift power can be reduced
similarly without requiring any additional logic or routing cost,
and it can be simply extended to multiple scan chains with
multiple test patterns.
III.
PROPOSED SCHEME
In order to further reduce the scan-shift power, we apply
the ¯Q-D connection technique as in [25][26] into the segments

Figure 3. Proposed low power scan architecture
after partitioning the scan chains as in [24]. The proposed
low power scan test architecture is shown in Figure 3. Firstly,
every original scan chain is equally partitioned into s segments,
where each segment has L/s scan cells and L is the length of
scan chain. The scan-in and scan-out ports of each segment are
connected to a multiplexer, and a signal Ci is utilized to control
it. If and only if single Ci is set to high, each ith segment
for every scan chain is active for scan-in stimuli and scan-out
responses, and others are hold to retain their scan test data
and bypass the scan data of the corresponding active segment
during scan shift operations as in [24]. Unlike in [24], where
all scan cells are chained in Q-D connection, we selectively
introduce ¯Q-D connection as shown in the broken blue block
in Figure 3 to reconﬁgure each segment after scan partitioning
to further reduce the scan-shift power. It is obvious that, no
additional hardware or routing overhead will be introduced
to apply the selective ¯Q-D connection technique after scan
partitioning as shown in Figure 3.
Then, we will describe the procedure how to select Q-
D or ¯Q-D connection to chain each two consecutive scan
cells for all segments in detail. The proposed selective ¯Q-D
connection ﬂow is shown in Figure 4. First of all, we will
show the calculation of WTj/NWTj , which denotes the the
total number of weighted transitions/nontransitions between
the jth and (j + 1)th scan cells in a given segment after
scan partitioning for scan-in/out all test stimuli and responses.
Assume each segment has Ls = L/s scan cells, according to
the scan-shift power metric WTM [27][28] described above,
WTj and NWTj (1 ≤ j ≤ Ls − 1) can be calculated as (4)
and (5), respectively.

number of transitions/nontransitions after scan-out all test
responses.
As shown in Figure 4, after calculating all WTj and
NWTj of each segment for all positions between every two
consecutive scan cells, we can selective ¯Q-D connection to
connect the jth and (j + 1)th scan cells if WTj is greater
than NWTj like in [27], then the reconﬁgured WTj will be
lower than NWTj and the scan-shift power will decrease.
Otherwise, the Q-D connection will be utilized to chain these
two scan cells. It should be noted that the corresponding actual
test vectors and expected responses would be changed exactly
according to the selective ¯Q-D connection modiﬁcation in
segments.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
To validate the efﬁciency of the proposed scan-shift test
power reduction scheme, experiments on several compre-
hensive large full scanned ISCAS’89 [29] and ITC’99 [30]
benchmark circuits have been performed. The proposed test
power reduction algorithm for simulation was implemented in
MATLAB language, and the test patterns and corresponding
expected responses utilized for experiments were generated by
ATALANTA [31] (ATPG program developed at the Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University) with X-bits random
ﬁlling.

cuits is shown in Table I. The ﬁrst column lists the names of

Table II illustrates the experimental results. Column Chains
lists the number of scan chains of each circuit used for
simulation, which ranges from 2 to 8. Columns 3-5, 6-9 and
10-13 present the experimental results of each circuit after each
scan chain partitioned into 1, 4 and 10 segments, respectively.
The total original WTM calculated by (3) for each original
scan circuit under different number of scan chains is shown in
column WTM org, and the WTM after scan chain partitioned
as in [24] is shown in column WTM[24], while the WTM
of the proposed scheme is listed in column Proposed. To
clearly illustrate the efﬁciency of the proposal, the scan-shift
power reduction percentage of the proposal with respect to the
original scan circuit and scan partition in [24] are presented
in columns Red1% and Red%, respectively. The last row of
TABLE II gives the average percentage of scan-shift power
reduction under different scan partition.
As shown in Table II, compared with the original scan
CUT, the proposed scheme can obtain scan-shift power reduc-
tion about 75.87% and 90.24% on average under partitioned
segments number in 4 and 10 respectively, which is a little
more than
s−1
s
× 100% (s is the number of partitioned
segments). While compared with the scan partition in [24],
with the help of the selective ¯Q-D connection technique,
the proposed scheme can achieve 3.61%, 3.46% and 3.21%
scan-shift power reduction on average for different circuit
with different scan chains under scan partitioned segments
number in 1, 4 and 10, respectively. The average scan-shift
power reduction under different partitioning is about 3.43%.
Furthermore, the proposal need no additional hardware or
routing overhead over [24] to reduce the test power further.
Therefore, the proposed scheme is a efﬁcient scan-shift power
reduction technique. It should be noted that, a careful trade-off
between hardware overhead and scan-shift test power reduction
should be made before determining the number of partitioned
segments for each scan chain, since more segments means
more hardware overhead and higher power reduction together.

CONCLUSION
Scan partitioning is an attractive technique to reduce
the scan-shift test power. In this paper, the selective ¯Q-D
connection technique was introduced after scan partition to
further reduce the scan-shift power. Since ¯Q-D connection
only exploit the ¯Q output of the scan ﬂip-ﬂops instead Q
to scan the test data to the next scan ﬂip-ﬂop, it won’t
require any additional test hardware or routing overhead. The
experimental results indicate that the proposal can achieve
more about 3.43% scan-shift power reduction on average after
introducing selective ¯Q-D connection technique to scan chain
partitioned segments. Furthermore, the proposed scheme keeps
