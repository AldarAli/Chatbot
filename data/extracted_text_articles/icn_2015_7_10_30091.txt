Abstract— Currently, an increasing number of vehicles are 
getting equipped with components which offer the possibility 
of an Internet access with low expenditure. Therefore, 
entertainment services in VANETs are becoming more and 
more important. An interesting class of entertainment services 
comprises IP television (IPTV) services and, therefore, studies 
regarding the quality of experience (QoE) for IPTV in 
VANETs are becoming increasingly relevant. Such QoE 
analyses also constitute the main goal of this paper where we 
focus on QoE in terms of availability of IPTV services. Up to 
now, studies of IPTV service availability in VANETs have 
primarily been executed based on simulation models. In this 
paper, we make use of analytical models to predict availability 
of IPTV for VANET scenarios. For this purpose, we have 
elaborated an analytical model of rather low complexity which, 
nevertheless, is rather realistic as we will show by means of 
comprehensive validation studies. In addition, we propose a 
general proceeding which makes use of our analytical model 
and can be applied as a straight-forward approach to predict 
the availability of IPTV services in a flexible and efficient 
manner. Case studies demonstrate how our analytical model 
can be applied by a provider of IPTV services, offered via 
VANETs, in order to satisfy QoE requirements regarding the 
service availability as given by the IPTV users.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Current predictions for the car market claim that, in 2016, 
more than 80 % of all new cars sold will have access to the 
Internet (e.g., FOCUS Online [5]). Therefore, one can expect 
that the usage of Internet services by car passengers will 
become more and more wide-spread in the near future. 
Besides search-, information- and communication services 
also entertainment services (such as IPTV or Video-on-
Demand) will probably play a significant role [3]. For that 
reason, quality assessment of Internet services with real-time 
requirements (as they are present, e.g., in IPTV services 
offered in vehicular ad-hoc networks – or VANETs for 
short) is getting increasingly important. Therefore, this topic 
is in the main focus of this paper.  
Quality of service provisioning is relevant, in particular 
as it is experienced by the (human) end-users and thus it is 
denoted by Quality of Experience (QoE) [9]. In case of IPTV 
services, QoE on the one hand refers to the quality of the 
received audio/video stream as perceived by the end-user 
[15]. But, on the other hand, it also comprises the degree of 
availability with which the user is able to access the IPTV 
service [8]. As a measure of availability, we will take the 
probability that a desired TV channel can indeed be provided 
to the corresponding user though the bandwidth in the 
(access) network may be quite limited. Availability studies 
for IPTV services have been done in the past (by means of 
simulation models) in particular for DSL based access 
networks [7] as well as for WiMAX based access networks 
[1]. 
As currently no vehicular networks offering IPTV 
services are available to us for carrying out measurements, 
the only alternative for corresponding service availability 
studies is the use of models. To the best of our knowledge, 
up to now, only very few models exist which allow one to 
predict the availability of IPTV services in VANETs. 
Detailed simulation models have been elaborated and applied 
in case studies by Momeni et al. [10] [11]. Moreover, in 
recent past, first successful trials have been undertaken to 
predict IPTV availability in VANETs by means of analytical 
models, cf. Wolfinger et al. [16]. 
This paper now significantly extends the results of [16] 
as we carry out an in-depth validation of the analytical model 
and, as a major new contribution, it presents a generalized 
procedure which allows us to predict the IPTV availability in 
a straight-forward manner for very different traffic scenarios 
and network technologies. We also apply our procedure in 
various comprehensive case studies.  
The paper is structured as follows: Section II will give a 
short overview on IPTV services offered via VANETs 
including the availability measures which we will apply. The 
analytical model used will be introduced in Section III 
followed, in Section IV, by a thorough validation of this 
model.  A generalized procedure for a highly efficient usage 
of this model then is presented in Section V. Application of 
the generalized procedure will be illustrated in the case 
studies of Section VI. These studies also show how our 
model can support a provider of an IPTV service (offered via 
a VANET) in dimensioning and configuring a network

which satisfies the given QoE requirements of the IPTV 
subscribers.  
II. 
IPTV SERVICES IN VANETS AND AVAILABILITY 
MEASURES FOR THEIR ASSESSMENT  
A. Provisioning of IPTV Services in VANETs 
Two main classes of vehicular networks are typically 
distinguished: networks supporting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) 
and 
those 
supporting 
vehicle-to-infrastructure 
(V2I) 
communication. For our studies, only V2I configurations are 
relevant because communication between vehicles is not of 
interest to us. V2I communication can be achieved in two 
variants which differ in the way how users in the vehicles 
can get access to the Internet: in the first variant (V1), the 
mobile station (e.g., a smart phone) could be communicating 
via a non-IP-based public mobile network and from there get 
access to the Internet. In the second variant (V2), the mobile 
station would access a dedicated road-side unit (RSU) via the 
base station (BS) / the access point (AP) of its local cell and 
from there get direct access to IP based routers (cf. proposal 
and prototype for so-called road-side backbone networks 
using RSUs to interconnect the Internet with the vehicles as 
described, e.g., by Krohn et al. [6]). In this paper, we assume 
that the IPTV services which we analyze are provided in 
networks in which Internet access is established according to 
variant V2. Different network technologies (such as WLAN, 
LTE, WiMAX) can be used in principle to achieve 
communication between the mobile stations (in the vehicles) 
and the base station resp. access point in the corresponding 
cell. From point of view of IPTV service, provisioning 
different network technologies in the access network can 
have a strong impact on the service quality because they will 
typically support very different data rates and lead to very 
different cell sizes. 
In the vehicular networks which we investigate, the fact 
that ad-hoc networking is possible between vehicles is not 
really important for us. On the contrary, we are mainly 
interested in the delivery of IPTV services to the vehicles by 
means of vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications. 
Nevertheless, we argue that the IPTV service delivery 
studied in this paper does not only cover vehicular networks, 
but also VANETs and, accordingly, we use the formulation 
“IPTV Services in VANETs” throughout this paper. 
 
If an IPTV service is offered in a network with V2I 
communication where Internet access is achieved by means 
of RSUs (as assumed in our studies) the basic network 
architecture will comprise the main components as depicted 
by Figure 1: 
• the IPTV Head-end, where all the TV channels are 
available which can be demanded by the IPTV users, 
• that part of the Internet which is used to make 
communication between the Head-end and the set of 
RSUs possible (this subsystem could be the IP based 
network of an ISP providing the IPTV service), 
• the access network representing the infrastructure for 
communication between an RSU and the mobile 
stations within the cells for which RSU is responsible. 
  
Provisioning of IPTV services typically makes use of 
multicast (e.g., IP multicast [13]) leading to the advantage 
that a TV channel having been desired in an access network 
has only to be provided once by the corresponding RSU even 
in the case that the TV channel is currently watched by more 
than one user in this cell. A TV channel is no longer 
transmitted in a cell as soon as the last user watching this 
channel releases the channel (e.g., because he/she switches to 
another channel or is involved in a handover thus leaving the 
cell or the user may temporarily terminate usage of the IPTV 
service). 
As a consequence of the limited data rate (bandwidth) of 
the cells representing the access networks it is, of course, 
possible that a TV channel newly desired by a user cannot be 
provided at that moment when the request for the channel is 
issued. This happens exactly in the case that the desired 
channel currently is not yet delivered in the cell AND the 
total transmission capacity available for IPTV is completely 
exhausted currently because of having to transmit other 
channels. If a request for channel delivery has to be denied, 
we say that the channel is “blocked” for the user and call this 
event a “blocking (event)”. 
So, we see that studies of IPTV service availability in 
VANETs which are based on detailed models will require 
that the corresponding models reflect 
 the bandwidth utilized for IPTV at any instant, 
 the list of TV channels currently being multicast in the 
corresponding cell 
 the behavior of the IPTV users in terms of the time 
instants at which TV channels are switched/changed 
and in terms of the id. (e.g., channel number) of the 
channel newly demanded. 
 
Former investigations with respect to a realistic 
characterization of IPTV user behavior [1] [2] have shown 
that the popularity of TV channels can be approximated quite 
well by Zipf distributions [12].

In particular, the probability pi that the i-th popular 
channel is requested is determined by the Zipf distribution as 
follows: 
𝑝𝑖 = 
1/𝑖𝜃
  𝑁

𝑘 = 1
(1/𝑘𝜃)
 
 
where N denotes the total no of different channels offered, k 
is their rank and θ is the Zipf parameter reflecting the degree 
of popularity skew. A value of θ = 1.3 is realistic according 
to measurements of IPTV user behavior [1]. 
B. Measures for IPTV Availability 
The following two reasons exist that an IPTV user will 
demand a TV channel within a cell: 
(1) A channel-switching event: Here, the user will 
demand a new channel to which he currently 
switches to (e.g., because he is “zapping” 
through a sequence of channels at time 
durations of just a few seconds or after he 
terminates a “viewing phase” with duration of 
several minutes or even hours during which he 
has received and watched just a single TV 
channel). 
(2) A handover event: Here, the car will change the 
cell and, as a consequence, the channel currently 
received by a user in this car will no longer be 
needed by him in the “old” cell left but it will be 
needed in the “new” cell reached now. 
In both cases, blocking of the desired channel may occur. 
Thus, we distinguish: 
 
switching-induced or switching-related blocking, 
and 
 
handover-induced or handover-related blocking. 
 
Therefore, three channel blocking probabilities are of 
interest to us: 
 
Channel Blocking Probability (CBP) referring 
to all blocking events 
 
Switching-induced Blocking Probability (SBP) 
referring only to blockings being a consequence 
of channel switching 
 
Handover-induced Blocking Probability (HBP) 
referring only to blockings being a consequence 
of handover events. 
As it is usual, we can approximate the three probabilities 
by the relative frequencies of the corresponding blockings 
choosing an observation interval which is sufficiently large. 
Let T = [t1, t2] denote the observation interval and 
|T|=t2-t1 its length. 
Let further denote: 
 
#r(T): no of all channel requests issued by all users in 
T 
 
#rh(T): no of all handover-related requests in T 
 
#rs(T): no  of all switching-related requests in T 
 
#b(T): no of all blocked requests (blockings) in T 
 
#bh(T): no of all handover-related blockings in T 
 
#bs(T): no of all switching-related blockings in T. 
Based on these variables, we can now define the 
following channel blocking frequencies for the interval T:  
 
CBF(T)  ≜
#𝑏(𝑇)
#𝑟(𝑇)   denoting the overall channel 
blocking frequency 
 
HBF(T) ≜
#𝑏ℎ(𝑇)
#𝑟(𝑇)
 denoting 
the 
relative 
frequency of handover-related blockings 
 
SBF(T) ≜
#𝑏𝑠(𝑇)
#𝑟(𝑇)
 denoting 
the 
relative 
frequency of switching-related blockings. 
Evidently, 
HBF(T) + SBF(T)  =  
#𝑏ℎ (𝑇)
#𝑟(𝑇)   +  
#𝑏𝑠 (𝑇)
#𝑟(𝑇)   =   
#𝑏ℎ(𝑇) + #𝑏𝑠(𝑇)
#𝑟(𝑇)
  =  
#𝑏(𝑇)
#𝑟(𝑇)  =  CBF(T) 
and – as the relative frequency converges to the 
probability for an interval length |T| tending to infinity:  
CBP = lim|T|   CBF(T) 
HBP = lim|T|   HBF(T) 
SBP = lim|T|   SBF(T) 
 
which implies that also CBP = HBP + SBP holds.  
Instead of CBP we can alternatively use  
CA  ≜ 1 - CBP  
denoting the overall channel availability.  
III. 
AN ANALYTICAL MODEL TO PREDICT TV CHANNEL 
AVAILABILITY 
In [16], an analytical model was elaborated which is the 
basis of this paper. This analytical model is used to 
determine CBP and it is able to take into account various 
traffic scenarios, access network technologies and IPTV 
service characteristics. 
To present this model in this section and in the following 
sections we use the variables and model parameters as 
introduced in Table I.  
The basic ideas underlying the analytical model are the 
following ones:  
 
TABLE I.  LIST OF PARAMETERS AND VARIABLES USED

(1) Calculate the probability that the system is in a 
state in which blocking can occur, also called a 
“potential blocking state”. 
(2) Calculate the probability that a currently 
unavailable channel is demanded when the 
system is in a “potential blocking state”. 
Calculation of CBP in our analytical model is based on 
the following four steps: 
 
STEP 1:  
Determine the probabilities Pi 
that, for given N and Nc, exactly i different 
channels are needed to satisfy the channel 
requests of Nc users, if N different channels are 
offered. Pi can be estimated by the relative 
frequency fi that Nc users require exactly i 
different channels, where fi can be determined in 
a straight-forward manner by means of Monte-
Carlo simulation [4] [14]. Throughout this 
paper, all of our Monte-Carlo experiments are 
repeated one million times and, therefore, the 
size of the sample to calculate fi  is 106. 
 
STEP 2: 
Assume a certain cell bandwidth 
BWc available for IPTV and determine P* as 
probability that Nc users require more than BWc 
different TV channels. So, P* denotes the 
probability that the system is in a “potential 
blocking state”. 
 
STEP 3: 
Assume that an IPTV user will 
require a new channel (channel number 
determined according to Zipf distribution) and 
determine the probability that the number of the 
channel demanded is larger than BWc , which 
happens with probability  
∑ pi
N
i > BWc
 
 
STEP 4: 
We determine the probability 
(CBP) that a newly requested channel cannot be 
delivered which happens with probability 
 
 
 
 
CBP =  P∗    ∑
pi 
N
i>BWc
,  
if we make the favorable assumption that, in 
case of a “potential blocking situation (state)”, 
exactly those channels are transmitted in the 
corresponding cell, which are the BWc most 
 popular ones. 
Remark: It should be noted that, astonishingly, 
the (favorable) assumption that “if the system is 
in a potential blocking state then just the most 
popular channels are transmitted” is quite 
realistic indeed. This has been observed by us in 
simulation experiments based on detailed 
models of IPTV services in VANETs (cf. 
simulation models described in [11] and also 
used during our model validation in Section IV).      
 
Figure 2 illustrates STEP 1 and STEP 2, by way of 
example, if we assume N = 50, BWc = 30, Nc = 150. This 
figure depicts the histogram for Pi  , i  {1, 2, …, 50}.

1 and 2 of our calculation algorithm for the analytical model (Nc = 150). 
IV. 
MODEL VALIDATION  
What is left is the validation of our analytical model. We 
validate it by means of simulation and care mainly about the 
late (stationary) phase and situations where CBP  0.1, 
because we assume that if CBP > 0.1 this means that QoE is 
too low anyway and, therefore, model accuracy is not really 
important for those cases.  
 
We validate the model by means of two series of 
experiments and observed good agreement between the 
analytical model and the simulation results. Therefore, we 
consider the analytical model as being sufficiently realistic. 
Of course, our validation phase is limited by the fact that we 
do not have any access to measurements regarding IPTV 
service availability in vehicular networks because those 
systems currently do not yet exist. So, we find it acceptable 
to rely on IPTV service availability predictions based on a 
detailed and (hopefully) sufficiently realistic simulation 
model. 
A. Series I of Validation Experiments  
In Series I, we changed Nc (the number of users in the 
cell) and kept N (the number of channels available) and BWc 
(the maximum number of channels that can be broadcasted 
at the same time) constant per set of experiments, with N = 
50 and BWc = 30 for set 1 of Series I and N = 100 and BWc = 
40 for set 2. As can be seen in Table II, the analytical model 
and the simulation model are matching quite well with a few 
minor outliers at Nc = 200 in both sets. Also, the values of 
the analytical model in set 1 do not increase as fast as the 
values of the simulation model (with increasing Nc).  
B. Series II of Validation Experiments  
In Series II, we kept the number of users per cell 
constant (Nc = 300) and changed N (the number of channels 
available) and BWc (the maximum number of channels that 
can be broadcasted at the same time). We, again, observe a 
good agreement between the analytical model and the 
simulation results, with a few minor outliers at higher values 
for N, where the analytical model is a close upper bound; for 
details regarding the deviations, cf. Table III.

V. 
A GENERALIZED APPROACH TO PREDICT CHANNEL 
BLOCKING PROBABILITIES  
In the following, our goal will be to use our analytical 
model, presented in Section III, to predict with only very 
little expenditure the availability of IPTV services in 
VANETs. In particular, our approach should cover a broad 
spectrum of traffic situations and of network technologies 
used to establish the access network for vehicle to RBU 
communication and, last not least, it should also cover 
numerous characteristics of the IPTV service offered.  
Calculation of CBP based on our analytical model yields to 
the following formula: 
CBP = P∗  ∑ pi
N
i>BWc
 , 
and this shows that CBP can be seen as a product of only 
two terms T1 and T2 with 
T1  ≜  P∗   and    T2  ≜  ∑ pi
N
i>BWc
 
If we fix the value of the parameter  in the Zipf distribution 
used to model IPTV user behavior, it becomes evident that  
T1 = T1 (N, Nc , BWc)     and     T2 = T2 (N, BWc). 
Therefore, it is possible to characterize T1, as well as T2 by 
means of elementary sets of curves. Moreover, T1 is a 
general upper bound for CBP because 
T1   =   P∗  >  P∗  ∑ pi
N
i > BWc
 =  CBP  
 
This is why the sets of curves related to term T1 (resp. P*) 
are of particularly strong interest. Similarly, T2 is an upper 
bound of CBP, too.

available bandwidth BWc on P* assuming that a certain 
number N of channels is offered and that the number Nc of 
IPTV users in the cell varies. In this study of P*, we assume 
N  {20, 50, 100} because N = 20 presents a small, N = 50 a 
medium and N = 100 a quite large number of channels 
offered. 
Moreover, we suppose Nc  {50, 100, 200, 300, 400} 
because in realistic scenarios (e.g., for  = 0.05) one nearly 
always will have no more than 400 IPTV users in a single  
cell (cf. below). Evidently, variation of BWc only makes 
sense in the interval [1, N]. 
Fig. 3, e.g., directly shows that if N = 100 channels are 
offered, spending a bandwidth BWc = 70 for IPTV will lead 
to a negligible value of P* and, therefore, also to a 
negligibly small CBP for all realistic cell populations 
considered by us (Nc  400). And even a bandwidth BWc = 
65 reserved for IPTV will ensure that CBP < 10 % holds, if 
again Nc  400 can be assumed.  
B. Characterization of term T2  
As T2 is no longer dependent on Nc , investigations 
concerning this term become even more straight-forward 
than for T1. In particular, the dependency of T2 on the

bandwidth BWc reserved for IPTV can be directly depicted 
for a given value of N.  
Figure 4 shows those dependencies for N  {20, 50, 75, 
100, 150}. This figure provides in-depth insight regarding 
the difficult decision of how much bandwidth should be 
spent for a given number N of offered channels. As 
examples, let us look at the case of N = 20 where it seems to  
be a good idea to choose BWc  18 (at least), for N = 75 a 
bandwidth of at least BWc = 50 seems to be desirable and for 
N = 150 a chosen bandwidth of BWc  80 seems to be quite 
risky.

will just depend on:  
 
average  distance d between two adjacent vehicles 
(driving in the same lane), where the avg. is taken 
over all lanes  
 
the no  of lanes per direction (k) 
 
the probability that in a vehicle IPTV is used ()  
 
the cell radius (Cr). 
In particular, Nc can be easily determined as follows: 
Nc =   2k  2Cr / d 
If we set  = 0.05 and k = 3 to be constant and if we vary d 
 {5m, 10m, 20 m, 50 m, 100 m} and assume cell radiuses 
of Cr  {1 km, 3 km, 5 km, 10 km}, we get Nc  values as 
depicted by Table IV. We see that with our assumptions, 
which we consider to be quite realistic, the value of Nc 
varies between 6 and 1200. We also can observe that rather

different combinations of parameter values will lead to the 
same value of Nc which facilitates the characterization of P* 
and thus also of CBP. 
 
D. Straight-forward calculation of CBP for numerous 
scenarios of IPTV in VANETs  
Combining the results achieved in this section up to 
now, we are able to propose a generalized proceeding which 
allows us to predict CBP for nearly any scenario of interest 
with nearly negligible expenditure (if we compare this with 
a CBP prediction based on simulation models for assessing 
IPTV availability in VANETs). 
In particular, Table IV showed us which Nc to assume to be 
realistic and the results of Fig. 3 and 4 can be directly 
combined (i.e., T1 and T2 can be multiplied) to determine 
CBP. Table V contains CBP predictions based on our 
analytical model for numerous scenarios of IPTV in 
VANETs. The results of Table V cover a broad spectrum of 
traffic situations (low, medium and high traffic load up to 
traffic jam), of access network technologies used having an 
impact on Cr and BWc and of characteristics of the IPTV 
service (e.g., number N of channels offered). 
 
To summarize, the results obtained in this section can 
allow one to significantly improve the understanding of the 
main factors and their mutual dependencies which influence 
IPTV availability in VANETs.  
VI. 
CASE STUDY  
In the previous section, we have shown how it is possible to 
determine CBP just as a function of N, Nc and BWc, where, 
of course, Nc itself is a function of  d, Cr, k and  . We now 
want to indicate how the handover- and the switching-
induced blocking probabilities HBP and SBP can be 
determined based on CBP.   
 
A. Calculation of #hoph 
Let #hoph denote the total number of handovers per hour 
of all vehicles using IPTV and leaving a given cell. We 
assume a mean speed of those vehicles of v and a mean 
distance between adjacent vehicles of d, a cell radius Cr, k 
lanes per direction, as well as an IPTV watching probability 
of . With these assumptions we can directly calculate Nc 
(cf. Section V.C.).  
#hoph can be determined in a straight-forward manner as 
follows: 
 
#hoph =   2k  
𝑣 [𝑘𝑚
ℎ ]
𝑑  10−3 [𝑘𝑚] =   2k  
𝑣 
𝑑  10−3  [
1
ℎ]  
B. Calculation of #swph  
Let #swph denote the total number of switching events 
per hour of all Nc vehicles using IPTV in a given cell. Let us 
assume a mean time t [min] between two successive 
channel switching events, where t = 3 [min].  
Then, #swph can be determined as follows: 
 
 
#swph =  
60
𝑡    Nc [
1
ℎ]  
C. Calculation of HBP and SBP 
HBP can be determined based on #hoph, #swph and CBP 
as follows: 
 
 
HBP  = (CBP  #hoph)/( #hoph + #swph)  
 
   
Correspondingly: 
 
 
SBP  = (CBP  #swph)/( #hoph + #swph) 
D. Case Studies 
Let us now apply the formulae for HBP and SBP to 
concrete scenarios for VANETs offering IPTV service. 
We assume a medium traffic situation with k = 3, d = 50 m, 
v = 120 km/h (averaged over all 2k lanes), Cr = 5 km, N = 
100,  = 0.05, BWc  {50, 60, 70}.

Fig. 5 shows the values of CBP, SBP and HBP in 
dependence of Nc for the 3 values assumed for BWc. Of 
course, increasing Nc just corresponds to increasing the cell 
radius Cr. Curves for SBP have been included in Fig. 5 
because of our trial to facilitate result interpretation, though 
the SBP curves are a direct consequence of the two other 
ones as SBP is just the difference SBP = CBP – HBP.  
 
Among others, Fig. 5 shows that for BWc = 70 CBP 
remains rather small for all values of Nc considered and 
even for Nc = 500 the value of CBP still remains well below 
0.005. Results such as in Fig. 5 may be highly valuable for a 
provider of an IPTV service in VANETs because they allow 
one to answer questions such as: 
 
How many users are acceptable in a cell if a certain 
bandwidth BWc is available for IPTV and we want 
to keep CBP below a certain threshold? The 
threshold for CBP could be 0.01 as it is indicated in 
Fig. 5 and we can observe that if BWc = 50 then Nc 
 220 is still acceptable or if BWc = 60 then Nc  
350 will still lead to the desired QoE. 
 
How strongly will HBP, SBP and CBP depend on 
Nc (Nc here mainly being a function of the cell 
size)? 
 
How much does an increase of BWc help in 
reducing the blocking probabilities? 
 
What proportion of CBP is due to handover 
respectively switching events, i.e., how much does 
handover-related blocking “hurt” QoE? 
VII. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 
The goal of this paper has been to evaluate the 
availability of IPTV services in VANETs based on an 
analytical modeling approach. The analytical model 
elaborated allows one to predict TV channel availability in a 
quite flexible and highly efficient manner (if, e.g., compared 
to simulation models). Our comprehensive validation 
studies indicate that the analytical model achieves a 
satisfactory degree of validity. The general proceeding for 
making use of the model demonstrates that studies are 
possible in a straight-forward manner covering strongly 
different scenarios. The proceeding proposed is primarily 
based on a highly relevant discovery made by us, namely, 
that we realized that the terms T1 and T2 , the product of 
which yield CBP, (cf. Section V) are both upper bounds of 
CBP. The case studies illustrate how the general proceeding 
for efficient experimentation can lead to a valuable 
understanding of the main factors influencing (switching- as 
well 
as 
handover-induced) 
TV 
channel 
blocking 
probabilities in VANETs. 
In our future research, we plan to elaborate an algorithm 
which allows one to reduce the probability of handover-
induced channel blockings (at the expense of an increasing 
number of switching-induced blockings). Such an algorithm 
seems to be highly desirable in order to alleviate the 
strongly 
negative 
impact, 
which 
handover-induced 
blockings may have onto QoE in the provisioning of IPTV 
services in VANETs.
