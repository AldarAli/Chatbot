Abstract—In this paper, we consider a conceptual model in
which, for the ﬁrst time, a queuing system is included in
an overall telecommunication system including users’ behavior.
On the basis of this model, analytical expressions for some
of the important parameters of the model are derived. The
results obtained allow deﬁnitions of new overall performance
indicators of human-cyber-physical-systems, including interaction
among human users, telecommunication network (including its
protocols and management rules) and the nature-socio-economic
environment.

nication system; Queuing systems; Conceptual modeling; Human-

I.
INTRODUCTION
The classical model of overall telecommunication system
is described in [1] and developed in more detail in [2]. It
considers users’ behavior, ﬁnite number of homogenous users
and terminals, losses due to abandoned and interrupted dialing,
blocked and interrupted switching, unavailable intent terminal,
blocked and abandoned ringing and abandoned communica-
tion. The trafﬁc of the calling (denoted by A) and the called
(denoted by B) terminals and user’s trafﬁc are considered
separately, but in their interrelation.
At the bottom of the structural model presentation, we
consider base virtual devices that do not contain any other
virtual devices.
The parameters of a base virtual device named x are the
following (see [3] for terms deﬁnitions): Fx - intensity or
incoming rate (frequency) of the ﬂow of requests (i.e., the
number of requests per time unit) to device x; Px - probability
of directing the requests towards device x; Tx - service time
(duration of servicing of a request) in device x; Y x - trafﬁc
intensity [Erlang]; V x - trafﬁc volume [Erlang - time unit];
Nx - number of lines (service resources, positions, capacity)
of device x.
We consider an extension of the classical model of over-
all telecommunication system in which a queuing system is
included in the switching stage. It is proposed and described
in detail in [4]. The graphical representation of the model is
shown in Figure 1. Two types of virtual devices are included
in the model: base and comprising base devices. The graphic
representations of the base virtual devices together with their
names and types are also shown in Figure 1 (see [2]). Each
base virtual device belongs to one of the following types:
Generator, Terminator, Modiﬁer, Server, Enter Switch, Switch,
Queue and Graphic connector.
The names of the virtual devices are concatenations of the
ﬁrst letters of the branch exit, branch and stage, in that order
(see Figure 1). For example, ad stands for the virtual device
“abandoned dialling” while rad – for “repeated abandoned
dialling”.
For better understanding of the model and for a more
convenient description of the intensity of the ﬂow, a special
notation including qualiﬁers (see [3]) is used. For example,
dem.F stands for demand ﬂow; inc.Y for incoming trafﬁc;
ofr.Y for offered trafﬁc; rep.Y for repeated trafﬁc.
The following comprising virtual devices denoted by a, b,
s and ab are considered in the model.
•
a comprises all calling terminals (A-terminals) in the
system. It is not shown in Figure 1, but includes
the four shown stages: dialing, switching, ringing and
communication;
•
b comprises all called terminals (B-terminals) in the
system. It is shown in a bold line box in Figure 1;
•
ab comprises all the terminals (calling and called) in
the system. It is not shown in Figure 1;
•
s virtual device corresponding to the switching system.
In our model, the queuing system in the switching stage of
the telecommunication network in Kendall’s notation (see [5])
is represented as M|M|Ns|Ns + Nq|Nab|FIFO, where M
stands for exponential distribution, Ns is the capacity of the
Switching system (number of equivalent internal switching
lines), Nq is the buffer length and Nab is the total number
of active terminals which can be calling and called. This is
related to the derivation of the analytical model of the system.
The queuing system in the model differs from other well
known and studied queuing systems [6]–[8] in that: it has
more than one exit to the server; the duration of service of
the requests in the server depends on the overall state of the
telecommunication system; there is a feedback in terms of call
attempts.

are all probabilites for directing the call to a device (the P–
parameters), the holding time parameters of the base virtual
devices (T – parameters) and the values of the intensity of the
incoming calls ﬂow – inc.Fa = Fa. The unknown parameters
are the parameters of the comprising virtual devices except Fa
and Nab.
To obtain simple analytical expressions in the process of
solving different teletrafﬁc tasks, as in [1], we need to state
the following assumptions:
1)
We consider a closed telecommunication system
which is represented graphically and functionally in
Figure 1.
2)
All base virtual devices except the Queue device
have unlimited capacity. The Queue has capacity
Nq, which is the buffer size. The comprising virtual
devices have limited capacity: the ab device contains
all active terminals Nab ∈ [2, ∞). The switching
system (s) has capacity Ns. One internal switching
line can carry only one call for both incoming and
outgoing calls.
3)
Every call from the incoming ﬂow to the system
(inc.Fa) occupies only a free terminal which be-
comes a busy A-terminal.
4)
The system is in a stationary state and the Little’s
theorem [5] can be applied for every device.
5)
Every call occupies one place in a base virtual device
independently from the other devices.
6)
Any calls in the telecommunication network’s envi-
ronment (outside the a and b devices) do not occupy
any of the telecommunication system’s devices.
7)
The probabilities of directing the calls to the base
virtual devices and the holding time in the devices are
independent of each other and of the intensity of the
incoming ﬂows inc.Fa. Their values are determined
by the users’ behavior and the technical characteris-
tics of the telecommunication system. Exception to
this assumption are the devices of type Enter Switch
corresponding to Pbq and Pbs, and Pbr (see Figure
1).
8)
For the base virtual devices ar, cr, ac and cc, the
probabilities of directing the calls to them and the
duration of occupation of the device are the same for
the a and the b comprise virtual devices.
9)
The variables in the model are random with ﬁxed
distributions. The Little’s theorem allows us to use
their mean values.
10)
Every call occupies simultaneously all base virtual
devices through which it has passed, including the
device where it is at the current moment of observa-
tion. When a call leaves the comprising devices a or
b, the places occupied by it in all base virtual devices
are released.

The following propositions proved for the classical concep-
tual model of overall telecommunication system in [1] can be
used without proof due to analogy. They obviously hold for
the conceptual model of overall telecommunication network
with queue, considered in the present paper.
Proposition 1: The trafﬁc intensity of all terminals (Y ab)
is a sum of the trafﬁc intensities of the calling terminals (Y a)
and the called terminals (Y b):
Y ab = Y a + Y b .
(1)
Proposition 2: (Total terminal trafﬁc (Yab) is restricted)
0 ≤ Y ab ≤ Nab ,
(2)
and here Nab is the total number of all active terminals.
Proposition 3: The calls ﬂow intensity occupying all A
and B terminals (Fab) is a sum of the intensities of the calls
ﬂow occupying the A-terminals (Fa) and the B-terminals (Fb):
Fab = Fa + Fb .
(3)
The Little’s formula for the comprised virtual devices a
and b gives dependences for the intensities of the calling (Y a)
and called (Y b):
Proposition 4:
Y a = Fa Ta .
(4)
Proposition 5:
Y b = Fb Tb .
(5)
In [4], with the help of the above assumptions, analytical
expressions for the parameters of the queuing system – ex-
pected length of the queue (Y q), mean time of service in the
q device (Tq) and the probability of blocked queuing (Pbq)
are derived. Here, we present them without proof, but using a
more appropriate notation.
Proposition 6:
Y q =
p0rNsρ
Ns!(1 − ρ)2 [(ρ − 1)ρNq(Nq + 1) + 1 − ρNq+1] . (6)
Proposition 7:
Tq =
p0rNsρ
Ns!(1 − ρ)2
[(ρ − 1)ρNq(Nq + 1) + 1 − ρNq+1]
λ(1 − Pbq)
.
(7)
Proposition 8:
Pbq =
λNs+Nq
NsNqNs!µNs+Nq p0 .

DERIVATION OF ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS FOR
SOME OF THE PARAMETERS OF OVERALL
TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM WITH QUEUE
Here, we demonstrate how the conceptual model shown in
Figure 1 can be used for derivation of analytical expressions for
some of the parameters of the model. In particular, we shall
derive expressions for the mean intensity of the B-terminals
(Fb), the mean service time of the A-terminals (Ta) and the
intensity of the repeated ﬂow of the A-terminals (rep.Fa).
Theorem 1:
Fb = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)
·(1 − Pbr) .
(10)
Proof: Before occupying the intent B-terminals with mean
intensity Fb, the a-calls have to avoid all six types of losses
considered in the model in Figure 1 with probability 1 minus
the corresponding probabilities for directing the calls to each
of the devices ad, id, bq, is, ns, br. These probabilities are
multiplied since we have independent events. Here, we use
assumptions 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
Theorem 2:
Ta = Ted+Pad Tad+(1−Pad)[Pid Tid+(1−Pid)[Tcd+
+Pbq Tbq + (1 − Pbq) [Tq + Pis Tis + (1 − Pis)[Pns Tns
+(1 − Pns)[Tcs + Pbr Tbr + (1 − Pbr)Tb]]]]] .
(11)
Proof: From the conceptual model on Figure 1, the pa-
rameters’ independence (Assumption 7) and the virtual channel
switching (Assumption 10), we have that Y a is a sum of the
trafﬁcs of all base virtual devices included in the comprising
a device.
Y a = Y ed+Y ad+Y cd+Y id+Y bq+Y q+Y is+Y cs+Y ns
+Y br + Y ar + Y cr + Y ac + Y cc .
(12)
Using Little’s formula, we can express the trafﬁc intensities in
the following way:
Y ed = Fa Ted ,
(13)
Y ad = Fad Tad = Fa Pad Tad ,
(14)
Y id = Fid Tid = Fa(1 − Pad)Pid Tid ,
(15)
Y cd = Fcd Tcd = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)Tcd ,
(16)
Y bq = Fbq Tbq = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)Pbq Tbq ,
(17)
Y q = Fq Tq = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)Tq , (18)
Y is = Fis Tis = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)Pis Tis ,
(19)
Y ns = Fns Tns = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)

·(1 − Pis)Pns Tns ,
(20)
Y cs = Fcs Tcs = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)
·(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)Tcs ,
(21)
Y br = Fbr Tbr = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)
·(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)Pbr Tbr .
(22)
From Assumption 8, we have that Y ar, Y cr, Y ac, and Y cc
are the same for the A and B terminals. Therefore, using
Theorem 1, we obtain
Y b = Y ar + Y cr + Y ac + Y cc = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)
·(1 − Pbq)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)(1 − Pbr)Tb .
(23)
After substitution of (13)-(23) in (12) and using (4) we
obtain (11).
Theorem 3:
rep.Fa = Fa{Pad Prad + (1 − Pad)[Pid Prid + (1 − Pid)
·[Pbq Prbq + (1 − Pbq)[Pis Pris + (1 − Pis)
·[Pns Prns + (1 − Pns)[Pbr Prbr + (1 − Pbr)
·[Par Prar + (1 − Par)[Pac Prac+
+(1 − Pac)Prcc]]]]]]]} .
(24)
Proof: Using Figure 1 and Assumption 1, rep.Fa can be
expressed as a sum of intensities of repeated attempts ﬂows in
all branches:
rep.Fa = Frad + Frid + Frbq + Fris + Frns + Frbr
+Frar + Frac + Frcc .
(25)
Using the graphical representation in Figure 1, the intensities
of the reapeated attempts ﬂows in all branches can be ex-
pressed as a function of Fa in the following ways:
Frad = Fa Pad Prad ,
(26)
Frid = Fa(1 − Pad)Pid Prid ,
(27)
Frbq = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)Pbq Prbq ,
(28)
Fris = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)Pis Pris ,
(29)
Frns = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)(1 − Pis)
·Pns Prns ,
(30)
Frbr = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)(1 − Pis)
·(1 − Pns)Pbr Prbr ,
(31)
Frar = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)(1 − Pis)
·(1 − Pns)(1 − Pbr) Par Prar ,
(32)
Frac = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)(1 − Pis)
·(1 − Pns)(1 − Pbr)(1 − Par)Pac Prac ,
(33)
Frcc = Fa(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pbq)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)
·(1 − Pbr)(1 − Par)(1 − Pac)Prcc .
(34)
Adding equations (26)-(34) and performing elementary oper-
ations, we obtain the right-hand side of (24). This completes
the proof.
Using Theorem 3, we can determine the intensity of the
input ﬂow to the telecommunication system (Fa = inc.Fa).
From the graphical representation of the system shown in
Figure 1, we have that the intensity of the incoming ﬂow can
be represented as a sum of the intensities of the demand calls
(dem.Fa) and the repeated attempts (rep.Fa):
Fa = dem.Fa + rep.Fa .
(35)
As in the classical model of overall telecommunication system
[1], we use the following equation for the intensity of the
demand calls:
dem.Fa = Fo(Nab + M Y ab) ,
(36)
where Fo is the intensity of the input ﬂow from one idle
terminal, Nab is the number of active terminals and M is a
parameter characterizing Bernoulli-Poisson-Pascal (BPP) ﬂow
of demand calls [1]. When M = −1, demand ﬂow corresponds
to Bernoulli (Engset) distribution. When M = 0 – to Poisson
(Erlang) and when M = 1 – to Pascal (Negative binomial)
distribution. In general, M can take every value in the interval
[−1, 1].
The following classiﬁcation of the parameters is proposed
in [4]:
•
Static parameters: M, Nab, Ns, Ted, Pad, Tad, Prad,
Pid, Tid, Prid, Ted, Pis, Tis, Pris, Pns, Tns, Tes,
Prns, Tbr, Prbr, Par, Tar, Prar, Tcr, Pac, Tac,
Prac, Tcc, Prcc, Nq, Tbq, Trbq, Prbq. Their values
are considered independent of the system state Y ab
(see [9]) but may depend on other factors. For the
model time interval, they are considered constants.
•
Dynamic parameters: Fo, Y ab, Fa, dem.Fa, rep.Fa,
Pbs, Pbr, ofr.Fq, crr.Fs, Tq, Pbq. Their values are
mutually dependent.
Using this classiﬁcation, we can express rep.Fa as a function
of the dynamic parameters Fa, Pbr and Pbq.
Theorem 4: The intensity of the calls of repeated attempts
rep.Fa can be determined by
rep.Fa = Fa[R1 + R2(1 − Pbq)Pbr + R3Pbq] ,
(37)

where
R1 = PadPrad + (1 − Pad)[PidPrid + (1 − Pid)[PisPris
+(1 − Pis)[PnsPrns + (1 − Pns)[ParPrar
+(1 − Par)[PacPrac + (1 − Pac)Prcc]]]]] ,
(38)
R2 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)[Prbr
−ParPrar − (1 − Par)[PacPrac + (1 − Pac)Prcc]] , (39)
R3 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)[Prbq − [PisPris
+(1 − Pis)[PnsPrns + (1 − Pns)[ParPrar
+(1 − Par)[PacPrac + (1 − Pac)Prcc]]]]] .
(40)
Proof: Adding equations (26)-(34), taking into account
(25) and separating static from dynamic parameters, we obtain
rep.Fa = Fa{PadPrad + (1 − Pad)[PidPrid
+(1 − Pid)[PisPris + (1 − Pis)[PnsPrns + (1 − Pns)
· [ParPrar + (1 − Par)[PacPrac + (1 − Pac)Prcc]]]]]
+(1− Pbq)Pbr(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)[Prbr
−ParPrar − (1 − Par)[PacPrac + (1 − Pac)Prcc]]
+Pbq(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)[Prbq − [PisPris
+(1 − Pis)[PnsPrns + (1 − Pns)[ParPrar
+(1 − Par)[PacPrac + (1 − Pac)Prcc]]]]]} .
(41)
Now, we denote the expression in (41) which does not contain
dynamic parameters by R1, the coefﬁcient of (1 − Pbq)Pbr
by R2 and the coefﬁcient of Pbq by R3 and we obtain (37).
This proves the theorem.
Similarly, after separating static from dynamic parameters
in (11) and using the Little’s formula for the A-terminals’
trafﬁc intensity (Y a), we obtain the following representation:
Theorem 5:
Y a = Fa[Sa1+Sa2(1−Pbq)Tq+Sa3(1−Pbq)Pbr+Sa4Pbq] ,
(42)
where
Sa1 = Ted + PadTad + (1 − Pad)[PidTid + (1 − Pid)[Tcd
+PisTis+(1−Pis)[PnsTns+(1−Pns)[Tcs+Tb]]]] , (43)
Sa2 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid) ,
(44)
Sa3 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)(Tbr − Tb) .
(45)
Sa4 = (1−Pad)(1−Pid)[Tbq−PisTis−(1−Pis)[PnsTns
+(1 − Pns)[Tcs + Tb]]] .
(46)
Proof: We denote by Sa1 the sum of all expressions in
(11) that do not include dynamic parameters:
Sa1 = Ted + PadTad + (1 − Pad)[PidTid + (1 − Pid)[Tcd
+PisTis+(1−Pis)[PnsTns+(1−Pns)[Tcs+Tb]]]] . (47)
We denote by Sa2 the coefﬁcient of (1 − Pbq)Tq in (11):
Sa2 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid) .
(48)
We denote by Sa3 the coefﬁcient of the expression (1 −
Pbq)Pbr in (11) :
Sa3 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)(Tbr − Tb) .
(49)
We denote by Sa4 the coefﬁcient of Pbq in (11):
Sa4 = (1−Pad)(1−Pid)[Tbq−PisTis−(1−Pis)[PnsTns
+(1 − Pns)[Tcs + Tb]]] .
(50)
In this way, for Ta we obtain the representation:
Ta = Sa1 +Sa2(1−Pbq)Tq +Sa3(1−Pbq)Pbr +Sa4Pbq .
(51)
After substitution of (51) in (4), we conﬁrm the validity of
(42).
Theorem 6: The trafﬁc of all simultaneously busy termi-
nals Y ab as a function of Fa and other parameters is given
by
Y ab = Fa[S1 + S2(1 − Pbq)Tq + S3(1 − Pbq)Pbr
+S4Pbq] ,
(52)
where
S1 = Ted + PadTad + (1 − Pad)[PidTid + (1 − Pid)[Tcd
+PisTis + (1 − Pis)[PnsTns + (1 − Pns)[Tcs + 2Tb]]]] ,
(53)
S2 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid) ,
(54)
S3 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)(Tbr − 2Tb) ,
(55)
S4 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)[Tbq − PisTis − (1 − Pis)[Pns
+(1 − Pns)[Tcs + 2Tb]]] .
(56)
Proof: From (1), (4), (5) and Theorem 1 we have
Y ab = Y a + Y b = FaTa + FbTb = Fa{Ta
+(1−Pad)(1−Pid)(1−Pbq)(1−Pis)(1−Pns)(1−Pbr)Tb} .
(57)
After substitution of Ta in the above equation with its equal
expression from (51), we obtain:
Y ab = Fa{Sa1 + Sa2(1 − Pbq)Pbr + Sa3(1 − Pbq)Pbr
+Sa4Pbq − (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)
·(1 − Pbq)PbrTb + (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)
·(1 − Pns)(1 − Pbq)Tb} .
(58)
In the above expression, we denote by S1 the part which
does not contain Tq, Pbq and Pbr:

S1 = Sa1 + (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)Tb =
Ted+PadTad+(1−Pad)[PidTid+(1−Pid)[Tcd+PisTis
+(1 − Pis)[PnsTns + (1 − Pns)[Tcs + 2Tb]]]] .
(59)
By S2 we denote the coefﬁcient of (1−Pbq)Tq and it is equal
to Sa2:
S2 = Sa2 = (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid) .
(60)
By S3 we denote the coefﬁcient of (1 − Pbq)Pbr:
S3 = Sa3 − (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)Tb
= (1−Pad)(1−Pid)(1−Pis)(1−Pns)(Tbr−2Tb) . (61)
Finally,we denote the coefﬁcient of Pbq in (58) by S4:
S4 = Sa4 − (1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)(1 − Pis)(1 − Pns)Tb =
(1 − Pad)(1 − Pid)[Tbq − PisTis − (1 − Pis)[PnsTns
+(1 − Pns)[Tcs + 2Tb]]] .
(62)
This proves Theorem 6.
Now, we can express Fa as a function of the intensity of
the input ﬂow of one idle terminal (Fo), Pbr, Pbq and Tq.
Theorem 7:
Fa[1 − Fo M[S1 + S2(1 − Pbq)Tq + S3(1 − Pbq)Pbr
+S4Pbq] − R1 − R2(1 − Pbq)Pbr − R3] = Fo Nab . (63)
Proof: From (35) and (36), we have
Fa = Fo Nab + Fo M Y ab + rep.Fa .
(64)
After substitution of Y ab and rep.Fa with their equal ex-
pressions from (52) and (37), respectively, and regrouping we
obtain (63).

CONLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The analytical expressions derived here are the ﬁrst step
towards the construction of a complete analytical model of
the overall telecommunication system with queue. The an-
alytical model can be used for solving different teletrafﬁc
tasks such as Quality of Service (QoS) prediction task, tech-
nical characteristics task (e.g., network dimensioning / re-
dimensioning for guaranteeing the target QoS), human behav-
ior task (investigate possible effects of users’ behavior and
prepare recommendations and administrative limitations, e.g.,
of the maximal duration of ringing and busy tone), etc. For
the purpose of constructing an analytical model that is easier
to work with, in the expression for Ta derived here, the static
and dynamic parameters are separated. The presented results
allow deﬁnitions of new overall telecommunication system
performance indicators, including human users’ characteristics,
following the approach described in [10]. A problem will be
the numerical solution of the derived system of equations,
because it is non-linear due to comprising Erlang-type queuing
blocking formula. The current investigations conﬁrm our belief
in a successful numerical solution of the system, using the
methods discussed in [1] and [11].
