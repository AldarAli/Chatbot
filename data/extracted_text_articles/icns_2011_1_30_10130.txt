Abstract—This 
paper 
presents 
preemptive 
channel 
allocations (PCA) for multiple-sector cellular networks, 
where directional antennas are used to divide the coverage of 
a cell into a number of same-sized sectors. When traffic in a 
sector unexpectedly increases, call blocking probability will 
increase accordingly. To remedy channel insufficient 
problem in a single sector, two aspects of channel 
preemptions are utilized. First, to reduce the blocking 
probability of new calls, the proposed PCA allows a new call 
to preempt an ongoing call when the ongoing call is located 
in the overlapping regions of two adjacent sectors or two 
neighboring cells. Second, the reserved channels not only can 
be used by the handoff calls, but also by the preempted calls. 
For the purpose of performance evaluation, we build an 
analytical model with four-tuple Markov chains. Numerical 
results show that the proposed PCA scheme improve the 
system performance in terms of the blocking and preemption 
probabilities.

 INTRODUCTION 
Over the past decade, the rapid growth of the cellular 
technology (2G/3G/3.5G or even the upcoming 4G) has 
been proven that it can provide high reliability, stability, 
and ubiquity for personal communications [1]. A basic 
cellular network is composed of a base station (BS) and 
numerous mobile terminals (MTs). Channel capacity of a 
cellular network may become insufficient when MTs are 
attached to the network or moving between cells or sectors. 
There have been many previous works focused on the 
preemption mechanisms for cellular networks. A scheme 
called Adjusted Multimode Dynamic Guard Bandwidth 
(AM-DGB) [1] can temporarily block one or more lower-
priority calls to guarantee longer connection time for 
higher-priority calls. A centralized and decentralized 
preemption algorithm was proposed by Lau et al. [3] for a 
connection-oriented network to minimize the service 
disruptions of ongoing calls. Recently, there were copious 
researches on sector-based cellular networks, such as 
WiMAX and LTE (Long Term Evolution)/LTE-A (Long 
Term Evolution-Advanced) networks. For example, to 
improve the throughput and capacity and to alleviate the 
inter-cell interference, numerous schemes on frequency 
reuse were proposed. Among them, Lei et al. [4] proposed 
a frequency reuse scheme to divide the available 
subcarriers into two groups, the super group used for the 
central region of a cell and the regular group used for the 
boundary of a cell. Similarly, Ali et al. [5] proposed the 
architecture of a dynamic fractional frequency reused (FFR) 
cell. Dynamic FFR scheme only partitions subcarriers into 
two physical groups. In our work, the main objective is to 
design a novel preemption scheme for ongoing calls 
residing in the overlapping areas of any two adjacent 
sectors. The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. Section II introduces the proposed channel 
preemption algorithms. Performance evaluation model is 
described in Section III. Section IV shows the analytical 
results along with discussions. Finally, Section V contains 
our concluding remarks.

PREEMPTIVE CHANNEL ALLOCATIONS 
A. Sector-based Cellular Networks 
 
Figure 1. Generalized topology of a sector-based cellular network 
A sector-based cellular network consists of multiple 
sectors divided by directional antennas. Figure 1 shows a 
generalized topology of a sector-based cellular network, 
consisting of one central cell and six neighboring cells. In 
the sector-based cellular network, we assume the cell has 
radius R. Due to the different coverage areas, an MT in a 
sector may reside in the following four regions. Region 1 
(R1): MT resides in the clockwise overlapping region of

two adjacent sectors (e.g., MT-A). Region 2 (R2): MT 
resides in the counterclockwise overlapping region of two 
adjacent sectors (e.g., MT-B). Region 3 (R3): MT resides 
in the overlapping regions of two adjacent cells (e.g., MT-
C). Region 4 (R4): MT resides in a sector other than the 
Regions of 1, 2 and 3 (e.g., MT-D). We design two 
different types of handoffs; (i) Inter-sector handoff: an MT 
originally residing in the sector is moving out to the 
neighboring sectors by passing through R1 or R2, and (ii) 
Inter-cell handoff: an MT originally residing in a cell is 
moving out to one of its six neighboring cells by passing 
through R3. A cell is divided into
S
N sectors, and the n-th 
sector has channel capacity, 
n
T
C , among which certain 
amount of channels are purposely reserved for inter-
sector/inter-cell handoff and preempted MTs, where 
n=1,2,……

 represent the channels 
reserved by the n-th sector of the central cell and that of 
the neighboring cell respectively for inter-cell handoff and

generalized cases of frequency reuse and channel 
allocations in a sector-based cellular network. 
A preemptive channel allocations (PCA) algorithm is 
designed for the cellular network with multiple sectors. 
Under this assumption, three phases of channel preemption, 
PCA-cws, PCA-ccs, and PCA-nbc, could be invoked by an 
MT. They are explained one by one as below. PCA-cws: 
When the available channels in the n-th sector are used up, 
a new call generated in the sector can be blocked. However, 
PCA-cws can be invoked by the new call if: (i) one active 
MT residing in R1 is employing an available channel of 
the n-th sector, and (ii) at least one reserved channel of the 
clockwise neighboring sector

PCA-cws is not possible. However, PCA-ccs can be

in R3 is employing an available channel of the n-th sector, 
and (ii) at least one channel of

following four types of ongoing calls which currently use 
the available channels in a sector according to the four 
regions; (i) i = the number of ongoing calls which reside in 
R4 of a sector, (ii) j = the number of ongoing calls which 
reside in R1 of a sector, (iii) k = the number of ongoing 
calls which reside in R2 of a sector, and (iv) l = the 
number of ongoing calls which reside in R3 of a sector. In

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION MODEL OF PCA 
In this section, we are interested in evaluating the 
proposed PCA algorithm on the sector-based cellular 
networks. Using 4-D (i, j, k, l) in a Markovian state, we 
can capture the characteristics of the proposed PCA. 
A. Model Assumptions 
The following assumptions are made in the analytical 
model: (i) it needs one and only one channel for an MT to 
become active; and (ii) the co-channel interference is 
ignored when an active MT resides in the overlapping 
regions of two adjacent sectors or cells. To facilitate our 
analysis, as shown in Figure 3, we approximate a single 
hexagon cell with six overlapping areas into an equivalent 
topology with two concentric circles [6], the outer circle

converted to the area of inner circle by excluding R1 and

To derive the state transition rates in Table I and Table

the handoff-area service rate by referring to [7] and [8]. In 
the model, we assume that the new-call arrival rate is a 
Poisson process with mean 
N

T, is exponentially distributed with mean

of four regions (denoted as

 and

be computed as shown in Eq. (1).

When an MT resides in R1 or R2, the probability of 
moving out the overlapping region of two adjacent sectors 
is determined by the area ratio of R3 and R4. Thus, the 
inter-sector handoff rates of an MT residing in R1 and R2, 
denotes as

. Figure 4 shows the new-call blocking 
probability as ρ increases from 0.3 to 1.2. It is interesting 
to notice that new-call blocking probabilities can be 
significantly reduced under the cell with four or five 
sectors due to the expanded available channels. There is 
another phenomenon worthy to observe that new-call 
blocking probability will be slightly increased when the 
speed of MT decreases from 10 to 50 km/h. The reason is 
because that by referring to Eq. (1), low-speed MT will 
increase the dwell time in the sector. In other words, the 
channel occupancy time of low-speed MT (e.g., V = 10 
km/h) is much longer than that of high-speed MT (e.g., V = 
50 km/h).

Figure 5 shows the preemption probability of PCA in 
the n-th sector (

PPCA
) as the angle of two overlapping 
sectors increases from 10∘to 25∘. It is observed that 
n
PPCA
 is increased more rapidly as α increases when a cell 
is divided into five sectors. This is because increasing α 
in a cell with more sectors (e.g.,
NS = 5
) has higher 
possibility to let the MT residing in R1 be preempted than 
18

with less sectors (e.g., 
NS = 2
). Another interesting 
phenomenon is that 
n
PPCA
 is continuous increased when the 
reserved channels becomes more (e.g., 
= 3
n
CSR
) in a sector, 
because the preempted calls have higher possibility to 
sustain their connections when PCA mechanism is invoked. 
 
Figure 5. Preemption probability of PCA versus the angle of two 
overlapping sectors 
 
Figure 6. Preemption probability of PCA versus the ratio a/b 
Figure 6 shows the preemption probability of PCA in 
the n-th sector is increased as the inter-cell overlapping 
region ratio increases from 1.2 to 1.8. In the figure, it is 
observed that 
n
PPCA
 at 
NS = 5
 is higher than that at 
NS = 2
. This result reveals that more number of sectors 
have higher possibility to invoke the preemption scheme 
because of the more overlapping regions. We can also 
observe that by simply increasing 
n
CNR
 from 1 to 3 can 
significantly increase the preemption probability. It should 
be noticed that although incrementing 
n
CNR
 can increase 
the increasing preemption probability, it may adversely 
increase the new-call blocking probability, since available 
channels in the neighboring cell could be reduced. 
Finally, let us investigate the average speed of MT 
versus 
n
PPCA
 when the overlapping regions are changed. 
Figure 7 shows the preemption probability of PCA is 
decreased as the speed of MT increases from 20 km/h to 
80 km/h due to the channel occupancy time (by referring 
to Eq. (1)). By fixing

for the preempted calls to execute PCA mechanism. Thus, 
when the overlapping regions of two sectors or cells are 
increased, 
n

 is still increased.

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper has presented an analytical model of 
adaptive channel preemption (PCA) for sector-based 
cellular networks. Three different preemption phases, 
PCA-cws, PCA-ccs, and PCA-nbc were proposed to fully 
utilize the capacity of the cellular networks with multiple 
sectors. One of the novelties presented in this paper is right 
in that the proposed PCA allows a new call to preempt an 
ongoing call when the latter is located in the inter-sector or 
inter-cell overlapping region. Analytical results have 
revealed two annotations: (i) the reserved channels can not 
only used by the inter-sector/inter-cell handoff calls but 
also used by the preempted calls, and (ii) the low-speed 
MT makes more impact on the new-call blocking 
probability than the high-speed MT due to the longer 
channel occupancy time.
