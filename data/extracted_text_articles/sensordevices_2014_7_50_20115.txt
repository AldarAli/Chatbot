Abstract— This article describes sensors for concentration
measurement based on the electro-chemical properties of the
liquid being measured. Herein two electrical methods, namely
cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, are being
presented.

be
performed
quasi
simultaneously using the same measurement medium. Further
optimization of the combined methods are possible by adapting
the geometric design of the electrode structure, the electrode
material, the optional passivation and the electric coupling
(galvanically or capacitively). In summary, by combining
multiple sensory principles on a device it becomes possible to
analyze mixtures of substances contained in a solution with
respect to their composition.

INTRODUCTION
Sensors for concentration measurements are a very vast
area of research. A concentration measurement is used when
the components are known, but not their content. For their
determination several substance-specific sensor principles
are known. In this article, two electrical methods are
presented using the implementation as the sensing element is
reported. These methods are based on cyclic voltammetry
and impedance spectroscopy. In cyclic voltammetry a rising
and then sloping current is applied between the working
electrode and the counter electrode in a solution. The
potential is determined by a reference electrode. If there is a
redox-active substance in the solution, it will be oxidized or
reduced at a characteristic potential. The current is recorded
as a function of voltage. The voltage in the oxidation and
reduction and the corresponding maximum current are of
interest. Impedance spectroscopy detects both the dielectric
properties of a medium and its conductivity as a function of
frequency.
In
aqueous
solution,
these
properties
are
dependent on the concentration.
The base of the sensors is an interdigital structure. Figure
1 shows different variations of designs. The main features
can be combined freely. A galvanic or capacitive coupling is
possible. The DUT can be a liquid or a solid. The organic or
inorganic sensitive solid is applied directly to the sensor
surface. The thickness is only a few 100 nm and is micro- or
nano-porous. This binds substances (DUT) by absorption
from the surrounding atmosphere, such as water or carbon
dioxide. The electrical properties change due to this and are
determined by the spectroscopy. Table 1 shows the different
materials for the sensor.

In addition to the measurement of purely chemical
parameters,
such
as
concentration,
measurement
of
biological
media
is
possible.
The
evaluation
of
the
measurement results, however, requires great experience. In
[1] and [2], the dielectric measurement of a biological
medium is described by some examples.
Often the signal is not very selective on the type of
material. In the DUT (device under test) the selectivity of the
sensor can be increased adding an indicator; using the
mixing ratio and the associated change in impedance even a
multi-component
system
can
be
analyzed.
Further
optimization of the combined methods are possible by the
geometric design of the electrode structure, the electrode
material, the optional passivation and the electric coupling.
The combination of multiple sensory principles on a
device can be used to analyze a multicomponent system with
a simple sensor.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
For the evaluation and adaptation of the sensor's design, a
test setup was constructed. The design is configured such
that the distances can be selected in a range of 200 microns
with free a resolution of 5 microns. In Figure 2, the
measuring principle is shown. By choosing the connections
of the electrode gap can be selected. In [1] and [2], this
method is described in detail.

The measurement setup for impedance spectroscopy can
be seen in Figure 3. Here, the analysis-chip with the
interdigital structure on it is seen in the middle. It is
surrounded by 12 dual multiplexer, which can be used to
select the 24 measurement channels (12 per page). On the
left side of the figure there are SMA connectors for
connecting an external LCR meter to chip, with which the
impedance of the device can be measured.
Through the recess in the middle, the liquid which is to
be investigated can be applied to the interdigital structure
either directly, or a flow chamber can be installed to then
perform the impedance spectroscopy using the desired
channels.

MEASUREMENTS FOR EVALUATION
For
the
evaluation
and
calibration
of
the
sensor
measurements are performed on an aqueous solution of KCl,
ranging from 0.00002 mol/l to 1 mol/l. Figure 5 shows the
frequency dependent measurement of the impedance |Z| of
the
aqueous
KCl
solution,
the
distance
between
the
electrodes is constant.

In Figure 6 the result when measurement is being
performed at different distances of the electrodes is shown.
In this way, the appropriate geometric structure is found for
the measuring task.

Figure 6. Concentration measurement, variation of the electrode distance
With the aid of the measured values, the amount and
phase |Z|, an equivalent circuit diagram is developed. The
values for the components are determined by a curve fitting.
The results are shown in the Figure 7. The equivalent circuit
is now allowing for the calculation of the resistor R1 from
the measured values and the calibration of the sensor to the
conductance. Figure 8 shows the graph of the curve fitting.

Figure 8. Graph of the curve fitting
In Figure 9 the resistances as a function of concentration
from the curve fitting are plotted. Various layer structures,
geometries and measurement strategies are explored. The
aim is to explore a multi-component system with various
sensors at the same location. The concentration of the
components is derived from the signal pattern. If the sensor
is calibrated, the concentration of the ingredients can be
determined from the signal pattern. One application is the in-
line measurement in biogas plants to optimize the output.

An overview of the previous work done is detailed in [3]-
[5]. The cyclic voltammetry is partially used in micro-
sensors,
but
not
in
combination
with
the
impedance
spectroscopy. The essential idea and novelty are related to
the connection of several measurement principles and
sensitivities to determine the concentration at the same
location. In summary, by combining multiple sensory
principles on a device it becomes possible to determine the
composition of substances contained in solution.
IV.
EXPERIMENTS ON THE TERNARY SYSTEM WATER-
ACETIC ACID-PROPIONIC ACID
The ratio of acetic acid-propionic acid is a control
parameter for the operation of biogas plants [6]. The
sequence of processes in biogas plants is not explained here,
an
intrigued
reader
might
take
a
look
at
[7].
The
concentration
measurement
in
this
mixture
is
very
challenging because acetic acid and propionic acid share
similar chemical properties. The separate determination of
the concentration of acetic acid and propionic acid in the
mixture of the two materials is difficult because both
materials differ structurally only by an additional-CH2-
group, which is insignificant in terms of responsiveness and
many physical properties
Cyclic voltammetry is preferably used to investigate
redox processes in terms of their mechanism. It turns the
electrode material used as a limit to the administrable
voltage. Since acetic and propionic acid can be reduced only
under very drastic conditions to the aldehyde, it can be
expected that the cyclic voltammetry for the quantitative
determination of these two components provides no useful
results.
For the same reason, actually, no significant differences
in the dielectric properties of both substances in the
impedance spectroscopy arise. A variety of electrochemical
processes are modeled in the equivalent circuit with a CPE
(constant phase element). This reflects the ion mobility in the
solution, which also depends on the mass of the moving
particle. Thus the different molar masses of acetic and
propionic-acid could be used for the analysis in this way. In
Table 2, the two substances are shown.

R1 and C3 in this case represent the influence of the used
multiplexer on the recorded spectra, while the remaining
elements result from the properties of the comb structure
used and of the measured liquid. First results show the
practicability of this method. In addition, by varying the
electrode spacing, all the other parameters which are
characteristic of the liquid can be varied in order to eliminate
them by a subsequent subtraction.

CONCLUSION SECTION
With the sensor platform described in the article could be
shown that a combination by cyclic voltammetrie and
impedance spectroscopy in a measuring system is possible
and above all useful. Furthermore it could be shown by the
various sensor adjustments (geometry, material, etc.) of the
sensors used, and that this increased sensitivity liquids can be
analyzed optimal. These optimizations are thus of crucial
importance and represent an important decision process for
the
application
areas
of
the
sensor
platform.
These
improvements will also enforce the ability to distinguish
between liquids in a liquid mixture. For the sample
application in Section IV, this means: To optimze the sensor,
the geometrical layout will be modified
increasing
the
sensitivity to discriminate better between acetic acid and
propionic acid.
