Abstract—The employment of medical devices and sensors
in healthcare is growing rapidly each year, as their contribu-
tion in diagnosis and treatment is immeasurable. Given the
paramount importance of security and privacy in the healthcare
sector, the increasing number of devices in the industry also
brings a rise in potential targets for exploitation and security
misconfigurations. Most of these devices communicate using
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and despite BLE’s advantage
in providing a communication protocol characterized by low
energy consumption, an indispensable requirement for medical
applications, its simplified protocol stack and general architecture
render it susceptible to various security and privacy flaws.
Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of the BLE protocol
becomes imperative in order to assess the security aspects of
medical devices thoroughly. Furthermore, this analysis aims to
identify the most critical vulnerabilities and specific attacks
targeting the Bluetooth protocol that necessitate mitigation and
remediation.

I. INTRODUCTION
The development and widespread adoption of the Internet
of Things (IoT) have given rise to a significant proliferation
of smart medical devices and sensors designed to record,
store, and transmit data. These technological advancements
find diverse applications, with a notable emphasis on their
integration into the medical field. Within the healthcare sector,
such medical devices and sensors are deployed to enhance the
quality of patient care, encompassing a range of examples such
as heart rate monitors, blood pressure monitors, blood glucose
monitors, insulin pumps, and implantable cardiac devices.
In order to achieve seamless interoperability, many of these
medical devices and sensors rely on wireless communica-
tion protocols. Among the key considerations in choosing
a communication technology that enables interconnection in
IoT applications is low power consumption, making Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) an increasingly favored option, as stated in
the Bluetooth Marker Research report of 2020 [4]. However,
as mentioned in [9], [13] and [14] the simplicity of Bluetooth’s
protocol stack also gives rise to certain inherent security and
privacy vulnerabilities.
The issue of medical device security has garnered significant
concern within the healthcare sector, particularly in the wake
of several incidents involving malicious attacks. R. Horton
in [1] shared his research, which uncovered plenty of cases
where, Bluetooth was the reason for the recall of thousands
of medical devices, which raised a lot of concerns in the
patients that were in need of these devices. BLE, has potential
security risks, which in turn can impact the security of the
interconnected devices. Consequently, a more robust security
and vulnerability assessment process becomes imperative to
identify flaws in BLE’s security architecture, delineate specific
Bluetooth-related attack vectors, and propose effective mitiga-
tion strategies. These measures are essential to uphold security
and privacy standards within healthcare IoT environments.
In Section 2, we provide a background for medical devices
and the Bluetooth protocol followed by a presentation of
the security issues of the BLE protocol and an overview
of various attacks against it in Section 3. In the concluding
section, a detailed examination of Bluetooth attack incidents
in healthcare is presented along with an analysis of pertinent
mitigation techniques.
II. BACKGROUND
Medical devices have changed from the once non-networked
and isolated equipment to devices with one-way vendor moni-
toring, to fully networked equipment with bi-directional com-
munications, remote access, wireless connectivity, and soft-
ware. Thus, with software increasingly embedded into med-
ical devices, the transition to Software-as-a-Medical-Device
(SaMD) has occurred [2]. The global wearable medical devices
market size was estimated at USD 28.15 billion in 2022

and is expected to hit over USD 169.58 billion by 2030
with a registered Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
of 25.6% from 2022 to 2030 [3]. Further accentuating the
expansion of wearable medical devices, the 2020 Bluetooth
Market Research report highlights the significant impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on this sector. Consequently, the health-
care wearable market, encompassing connected blood pressure
monitors, continuous glucose monitors, pulse oximeters, and
electrocardiogram monitors, witnessed a surge in demand,
resulting in 12 million shipments in 2020 alone. This upward
trajectory is anticipated to continue, with projected shipments
reaching 52 million in 2025 [4]. BLE is currently used in many
types of medical devices that have been approved and cleared
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including Blood
pressure, Blood Glucose Meter, Continuous Glucose Meter,
Pulse oximeter, Thermometer, Weight scale, Insulin pump,
Cardiac implant, Electrocardiogram and Prosthetics [12].
A. Security and privacy in healthcare
Many consumers and clinicians are eager to adopt and use
medical devices and health-related technologies to promote
health and well-being. Nevertheless, despite the potential ben-
efits in terms of enhanced efficiency and cost, the integration
of such technologies also necessitates the careful examination
and resolution of concerns pertaining to security and privacy.
Vulnerabilities identified in the Bluetooth protocol have ren-
dered certain Bluetooth-enabled medical devices susceptible
to exploitation. This concern has been further underscored by
reported incidents of Bluetooth attacks against defibrillators,
according to a recent report by WIRED [5]. The study,
conducted by security experts affiliated with a Midwestern
medical facility chain over a span of two years, revealed
critical security weaknesses in medical devices utilizing Blue-
tooth technology. Despite the fact that Bluetooth technology
has given diabetes patients a more efficient and effective way
to manage their diabetes by providing them with the ability
to easily monitor their blood glucose levels, it is crucial to
acknowledge the potential risks associated with its usage. As
presented in [6], individuals in close proximity can potentially
exploit this technology through Man-in-the-Middle and eaves-
dropping attacks. Notably, even seemingly innocuous wearable
devices like smartwatches and smart bracelets, which also
employ Bluetooth communication channels, are not exempt
from vulnerability to Bluetooth-based attacks, as demonstrated
by the findings of Bitdefender experts [7], [8].
B. Basic architecture of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol
BLE was first introduced in the Bluetooth 4.x version, re-
leased in June 2010. Bluetooth, specifically BLE, has become
the preferred technology for IoT devices [9]. Bluetooth Low
Energy is regarded as a different technology that specifically
targets markets where the demand is for ultra-low power
rather than high throughput [48]. This low energy version of
Bluetooth could positively affect IoT technology, by giving
devices the ability to exist and successfully function in a wide
variety of application scenarios [9].
The main building blocks of the BLE protocol stack [13]
are the controller, which includes the hardware to transmit and
receive data and the host, which enables applications to scan,
discover, connect, and exchange information with peer devices.
The communication between those two parts is done through
the Host Controller Interface (HCI). The BLE Protocol Stack
has the following functionalities [48]:
• ATT (Attribute Control Protocol) : is a client-server-based
stateless low-level protocol that defines data exchange
between a client and a server.
• GAP (Generic Access Profile): specifies device roles,
modes and procedures for the discovery of devices and
services, the management of connection establishment
and security.
• SM (Security Manager): controls the pairing mechanism,
key distribution and key management of a device. It is
also responsible to encrypt and decrypt data.
• GATT (Generic Attribute Profile): defines a framework
that uses the ATT for the discovery of services, and the
exchange of characteristics from one device to another.
The security properties of a BLE connection are defined
primarily through the selected security mode, security level
and the used pairing method. BLE protocol was introduced in
version 4.0 and was later developed through versions 4.1, 4.2,
and 5.0x.
III. PROBLEM STATEMENT
A. Inherent security issues of the BLE protocol
The pairing process in Bluetooth and BLE has been iden-
tified as a significant contributor to security issues, as high-
lighted in [14]. Attacks can be executed at various stages, both
prior to its completion and after successful device pairing.
Notably, the authentication challenge requests during pair-
ing are unrestricted in number, thereby providing a poten-
tial attack surface for adversaries to accumulate challenge
responses, which may reveal information about the secret link
key [14].
Furthermore, if the storage of link keys is poorly imple-
mented, then an adversary can view or even modify them.
An additional vulnerability derives from the encryption key’s
minimum length, which can be as short as a single byte. This
relatively limited key length could undermine the overall se-
curity of the system. Additionally, it is crucial to acknowledge
that the Bluetooth standard incorporates only device authen-
tication, lacking the additional layer of user authentication.
Finally, another vulnerability lies in the indefinite duration of a
device’s discoverable/connectable mode. This opens a window
of opportunity for potential attackers to exploit the device’s
accessibility over an extended period [14].
B. BLE attacks
In this section, we describe attacks like Man in The Middle
(MiTM), Denial of Service (DOS), Eavesdropping and how
to implement them against the BLE protocol, but also some
BLE-specific attacks like the treacherous attacks, distortion
70

CYBER 2023 : The Eighth International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

and others that can be implemented because of specific BLE
vulnerabilities.
Passive Eavesdropping attacks
This type of attack as mentioned in [15], refers to the unau-
thorized access and monitoring of Bluetooth communications
and involves the use of specialized software and hardware tools
capable of intercepting and analyzing Bluetooth traffic. Within
this context, attackers can execute a passive sniffing attack,
wherein they position themselves along the data transmission
path. The susceptibility of BLE to this attack is particularly
pronounced due to its simplified and predictable channel
hopping design.
Active Eavesdropping attacks
In addition to the previous type of attack, where an attacker
monitors Bluetooth communication, in this attack he also tries
to steal sensitive data. MiTM and Replay are two variations
of active eavesdropping attacks.
• In the context of BLE, a conventional MiTM approach
faces a limitation, as it cannot establish simultaneous
connections to both communication endpoints. Hence,
executing a BLE MiTM attack necessitates the utilization
of two components with the capability to act in unison.
For instance, in a scenario involving a mobile app at-
tempting to communicate with a smart device, one of the
components can be employed to establish a connection
with the mobile app while posing as the smart device,
while the other component simultaneously connects to
the smart device while posing as the mobile app. This
dual-component approach enables the MiTM attacker
to intercept and manipulate the data being exchanged
between the communication parties [8].
• Replay attack is a common form of attack for wireless
communications where the attacker captures legit com-
munication packets and then re-transmits those packets at
a later time. After intercepting the packets, the attacker
can simply re-transmit the whole intercepted packet; an
example of such attack, performed on a smart lock, is
described in [16].
Device Cloning
In this type of attack, the attacker tries to deceive the
target by assuming the identity of a trusted device, thereby
misleading them into establishing a connection. Afterwards,
in the case of successful connection, he tries to actively steal
the victim’s data and cause notable damage to the victim’s
devices. To perform this type of attack, an attacker should
spoof his MAC address, name, and GATT characteristics to
confuse the victim.
• MAC spoofing : The attacker spoofs the MAC address
as well as GATT services. By employing specialized
software tools like Gattacker, the attacker effectively
replicates the GATT services of the original peripheral
device, thereby assuming the role of a counterfeit pe-
ripheral entity [17].
• Forced Repairing : BLE devices, upon their initial con-
nection, undergo a process of pairing and bonding,
wherein a Long-Term Key (LTK) is generated. In this
attack, the attacker tricks the paired devices to undergo
the unpairing process and initiate a new connection. Un-
pairing two connected devices itself is not an inherently
malicious act, however after successfully carrying out this
attack, the malicious actor has the ability to launch more
severe attacks such as eavesdropping passively or even
actively performing a MiTM attack.
Cryptographic Vulnerabilities
In these type of attacks, the attackers try to compromise the
encryption of the communication protocol, exploiting inherent
cryptographic weaknesses and flawed key exchange mecha-
nisms within the BLE protocol. Some of the most prominent
attacks in the aforementioned category are the following:
• Offline PIN cracking attack : PIN Cracking attack can be
done in many ways, such as using brute force to crack
the PIN, another way is to use a dictionary with a set
of possible given PINs, also known as dictionary attack.
The security vulnerability of BLE is that the length of
the Temporary Key (TK) to generate the encryption key
is too short, as described in [18].
• Device Authentication attack : This attack is feasible
because of a cryptographic weakness of the passkey-
based pairing of BLE. The authors of [19] describe
how an active fraudulent Responder can bypass passkey
authentication, despite it being based on a one-time
generated PIN.
• BlueMirror attacks : BlueMirror is a collection of seven
attacks published in May 2021 [29] of which three
affect BLE pairing. During a reflection attack an intruder
collects a message in the authentication protocol, then
sends it without modification to the original sender.
• BLUR attacks : The Bluetooth standard (v4.2) introduced
Cross-Transport Key Derivation (CTKD). CTKD allows
establishing BT and BLE pairing keys just by pairing over
one of the two transports. The authors in [30] present
the first complete description of CTKD obtained by
merging the information from the Bluetooth standard with
the results from their reverse-engineering experiments.
These attacks allow to impersonate, MiTM, and establish
connectins with arbitrary devices.
Denial of Service
Similarly to traditional DoS attacks, the goal is to make the
resources of the system unavailable to the intended users. In
BLE, the attacker primarily targets the master, so that the slave
cannot get proper services in the BLE mesh network. Some
of the most prominent attacks in the literature are:
• Battery Exhaustion Attack : One of the main features of
BLE is its brief wake period, during which it facilitates
data transfers before returning to its sleep mode once
more. [20]. This attack targets this unique feature of BLE
by keeping the device awake. Bluetooth piconet is subject
to this form of attack [21].
• Denial of Sleep : When data from the base sensing layer
is provided by low power technologies, such as BLE, a
71

CYBER 2023 : The Eighth International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

class of vulnerabilities called Denial of Sleep attacks can
be especially damaging to the network. These attacks can
reduce the lifespan of the sensing nodes by several orders
of magnitude, rendering the network unusable [22].
• Jamming : Jamming describes the deliberate blocking,
and therefore suppression of specific parts of a communi-
cation or the target medium as a whole [13]. By jamming
only packets sent by the peripheral to the central device,
an attacker can trigger the timeout in the central device.
Since the timeout was triggered only in the central device
the attacker can step in as central device and hijack the
BLE connection. This attack was published in 2018 by
Damien Cauquil and implemented in the tool BtleJack
[23].
Treacherous
The authors of [36] describe the treacherous attacks, as the
type of attacks that are based on establishing a trusted relation
between the devices and then breaking the trust. That way, the
attacker can gain full access to the system and exploit it. There
are two different attacks mentioned:
• The Backdoor Attack is the method of gaining trust of the
victim device through the pairing mechanism. It ensures
that the attacker’s device does not appear on the victims
list of paired devices. In this way, the attacker can monitor
the activities of the victim device.
• Blue-Bump is a social engineering technique [47]. First,
the attacker sends a file and gains the trust of the victim.
Then the attacker persuades the victim to delete the link
key that was established during the transaction by keeping
the connection open. While the victim is unaware of
the open connection, the attacker requests the victim to
initiate another link-key. Now, the attacker device remains
concealed in the paired list of the victim device and
remains connected with the victim. To the victim the
attacker device seems like a complete new device.
Distortion
Here, the attacker exploits the vulnerability of BLE proto-
col services like GATT, L2CAP (Logical Link Control and
Adaptation Layer Protocol) or BLE data packets and tries to
disrupt the services of the BLE devices.
• Fuzzing : Fuzzing involves writing invalid values to
characteristics [24]. Characteristics are data fields which
hold atomic values. As a consequence of fuzzing, the
BLE server can start behaving abnormally, and in severe
cases, it can even lead to the crashing of the GATT
server. Prior to commencing the attack, a comprehensive
understanding of the characteristics present in the victim’s
GATT server is required. This can be easily done by an
active scan, but once the characteristic handle is obtained
and is writable, then the attacker can write random values
to it.
• Blue Smack : Both Bluetooth classic and BLE use
L2CAP for data transmission services. In this attack, the
attacker targets L2CAP protocol and disrupts its services.
This is also known as the ping of death attack [25].
Surveillance
Due to the architectural design issues of the protocol and
lack of proper security enforcement, attackers can gather
information about a person’s identity as well as personal data.
• Fingerprinting : Device fingerprinting is a technique of
identifying a device uniquely using different device-
specific features, such as MAC Addresses, Universal
Unique Identifier (UUID), advertisement packets, GATT
services, etc. [26].
• Blue Printing : Blue Printing is a technique to collect
detailed information, such as device model, manufacturer,
International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), and
software versions. It is not a severe attack, but it results
in privacy leakage issues, as shown in [27].
• Blue-stumbling : It is the method of randomly searching
for Bluetooth devices to find suitable targets to attack. It
is mostly done in crowded places where a large number
of Bluetooth devices are available. In this case, attackers
mainly search for victims, marking the devices with more
security flaws that could be potentially be exploited. This
process, even though does not cause any harm to the
victims directly, serves as the initial step to initiate an
attack [36].
• Blue-Tracking is the method of tracing the location of a
victim by following the signal of their Bluetooth Device.
It is not meant to steal information from the victim. The
attacker has no access to any content of the victim device
[28].
IV. CHALLENGES AND COUNTERMEASURES
The Sweyn-Tooth vulnerabilities [31], one of the most
recent sets of vulnerabilities, have the potential to affect
devices using the BLE protocol. The vulnerabilities expose
flaws in particular BLE SoC implementations, which enable
an attacker within radio range to initiate deadlocks, crashes,
buffer overflows, or completely bypass security.
One of the earliest works showing the vulnerabilities of
medical devices is the seminal study by Halperinet al. [32],
which introduced attacks on an Implantable Cardiac Defib-
rillator (ICD), compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the device. Similar attacks were also later shown
in insulin pumps [33], Fitbit trackers [34], medical infusion
pumps [35]. Several studies have also explored information
disclosure vulnerabilities in Bluetooth-enabled wearable de-
vices [36].
A proof-of-concept attack, executed by experts at Bitde-
fender [46], targeted a Samsung smartwatch that was paired
with a Google Nexus smartphone. Exploiting sniffing tools,
researchers were able to uncover the PIN used to protect
the smartwatch and the smartphone connection. In this case,
an attacker could easily perform a brute-force attack on the
PIN, as the “key space” is composed of only 1 million
possible key combinations. The vulnerability is in the Link
Manager Protocol and can be remediated by the manufacturer
by requiring a password for Bluetooth pairing, as well as
implementing encryption for the data communication.

CYBER 2023 : The Eighth International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

Concerning BLE fitness bands [40] and health devices [34],
it has been shown that an attacker can very easily access a lot
of personal data, read the various health sensor data [41] or
even guess what the user is typing by analyzing the motion
sensors data from wearable wrist devices [42].
Glucose monitors can be connected to companion smart
apps on smartphones, which not only capture data, but also
send alerts to patients. The technology can be exploited by
individuals in close range, and MiTM and eavesdropping
attacks can be executed [43]. During these attacks, data
being communicated between the devices could be intercepted,
decrypted, and captured.
A. Mitigation strategies
Given the open nature of wireless technologies, preventing
all attacks and guaranteeing security is a very challenging task,
however, there are several countermeasures that can be applied
to provide a reasonable security level.
Several mitigation strategies designed specifically for BLE
applications have been proposed over the years. Notably, in
reference to [37], the authors present various sets of rules for
users to help them perform actions safely, thereby minimizing
the susceptibility to potential attacks. They describe how to use
your BLE devices in your environment as well as underscore
the significance of regularly updating the firmware of such
devices. Of particular importance is the usage of a lengthy PIN
during the authentication phase when establishing connections
with other devices. Ensuring that this PIN is not only lengthy
but also randomly generated enhances its resilience against
brute-force attacks, akin to the practice employed in altering
phone passwords, as also mentioned in [14]. The authors
also suggest the adoption of link encryption for all data
transmissions as a means to prevent eavesdropping, while the
utilization of the maximum encryption key size is emphasized
to fortify protection against brute-force attacks.
In recent times, there has been a notable emergence of BLE
security testing frameworks aimed at evaluating the security
of applications. One such framework, as described in [24],
encompasses various software components designed to carry
out attacks like MiTM, DoS by flooding, and fuzzing. The
principal objective of this particular BLE security testing
framework is to present an integrated approach for assessing
the security of BLE networks through the execution of multiple
attacks on the network and its associated devices.
Additionally, [38] introduces an innovative framework,
known as MARC, which is specifically tailored to identifying
MiTM attacks in HealthCare BLE systems. The primary
purpose of this framework is to detect, analyze, and mitigate
Bluetooth security vulnerabilities, with a specific focus on
MiTM attacks targeting NiNo devices. To achieve this, a
comprehensive solution has been proposed which utilizes four
novel anomaly detection metrics for detecting MiTM signa-
tures. These metrics involve the analysis of malicious scan
requests, advertisement intervals, Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI) levels, and cloned node addresses.
The authors in [39] present an automated security assess-
ment framework designed specifically for Wearable BLE-
enabled Health Monitoring Devices. This framework encom-
passes four distinct stages, beginning with the initial phase
of information gathering. During this stage, the focus is on
identifying the assets, their interactions, and comprehending
the overall system workflow. Subsequently, the threat mod-
elling phase is executed, followed by a thorough vulnerability
analysis, and ultimately, the exploitation phase.
The efficiency of this framework has been empirically eval-
uated by conducting tests on a variety of medical devices, such
as the Athos Smart Apparel. This particular wearable system
seamlessly integrates surface electromyography (sEMG) tech-
nology, Smart Fitness Trackers, and Electrocardiogram (ECG)
trackers. The outcomes of these assessments have revealed
interesting findings, underscoring the framework’s value in
enhancing the security posture of such health monitoring
devices.
V. CONCLUSION
Maintaining a balance between security and design goals
remains a challenging task and requires closer collaboration
between manufacturers, security researchers, and clinicians.
As the popularity of Bluetooth continues to grow and it is
incorporated into more aspects of everyday life, it’s very
important that users understand the risks involved with using
Bluetooth. Even more important is that they work to mitigate
those risks by following the recommended security guidelines.
Both academia and industry researchers and practitioners
are presently collaborating to address certain open research
challenges aiming to enhance the performance of BLE, like
the improvement and design of the physical layer, specifically
the radio or PHY mode introduced in BLE v5.x. [44]. Addi-
tionally, the investigation of adaptive parameter settings [48]
and the utilization of random back-off mechanisms to retry
channel sensing for more efficient device discovery appears
to be quite promising in identifying devices within crowded
environments. Finally, research topics such as the role switch-
ing between central and peripheral devices based on events,
the coexistence of BLE with other wireless technologies,
as well as adaptive frequency hopping techniques to avoid
interference, are expected to enrich our understanding, inform
practical applications, and stimulate further research.
