Abstract—This paper presents the results of an acceptance 
analysis of existing mobile payment services (MPS) and MPS 
concepts. The analysis was conducted by means of technical 
documentation on features and functionalities, usage tests and 
interviews with experts from the MPS ecosystem. The results 
indicate high acceptance of wallet MPS that support additional 
functionalities such as loyalty card inclusion. In addition, card-
based MPS obtain high values for ease of use, and thus, might 
serve as transitional solution until technical standards are 
implemented in the ecosystem. Subsequent to a short 
introduction and presentation of the state of the art, the 
development of the evaluation framework of this study will be 
presented on which the analysis of the MPS at hand is based. 
The paper concludes with the design of a field study that will 
evaluate the acceptance of the suggested MPS in a real-world 
context.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Recent market research indicates a growing importance 
of mobile payment. At the beginning of 2013, Gartner [1] 
predicted that the value of the mobile payment transactions 
will increase by 44 percent in 2013 compared to 2012, to an 
estimated $235.4 billion worldwide by the end of the year. 
In some regions, such as Japan and the US, mobile 
payment is already part of people’s everyday lives. The 
development on the European markets, on the other hand, is 
still behind prior expectations. There exists high insecurity 
among many potential stakeholders within the complex 
ecosystem of mobile payment. The insecurity refers to 
technology standards as well as service designs and business 
models.  
What makes the ecosystem of different MPS "complex" 
is the fact that different pre-conditions and circumstances are 
relevant for each solution. Some examples include relevant 
partners in the value creation/delivery and supply chain 
process, a variety of contract forms, agreements, legal 
aspects, and responsibilities. For the user of a single MPS 
this complex ecosystem means that they might not be able to 
use the chosen MPS for the payment at a certain retailer, 
because the involved parties and companies are not in a 
contractual relationship that is necessary for a successful 
transaction at the point of sale.  
Acceptance of mobile payment is an issue that has been 
addressed in various empirical studies. These resulted in 
interesting causal models of mobile payment acceptance with 
high explanatory power, e.g., [2], [3], and [4]. Acceptance by 
itself, defined as the decision to adopt or not adopt a MPS, is 
not sufficient to predict the market success of a particular 
payment service as their success is highly dependent on the 
ecosystem in which they operate and their actual design. 
Thus, there is a need to connect theoretical foundations from 
acceptance research to practical design issues of actual 
mobile payment services and to context factors that arise 
from the complex ecosystem in which mobile payment 
services operate.  
The main objective of the present research project is 
therefore a systematic analysis of generic mobile payment 
services (MPS) within a novel acceptance evaluation 
framework that is derived from validated causal models of 
mobile payment acceptance. In a first step, it is necessary to 
develop the evaluation framework based on an extensive 
literature review. Mobile payment services are classified 
based on a market analysis and representative services are 
selected for each generic service. These are then analysed 
within the acceptance evaluation framework. Data for the 
analysis is obtained from service features and mobile 
payment service usage tests and expert interviews with 
service providers, banking and payment experts. The 
comparison of acceptance factors for each service results in a 
systematic assessment and enables conclusions regarding 
acceptance of the analysed mobile payment services. The 
paper concludes with an outlook on a subsequent field study. 
The research design of the field study is based on the major 
findings of the presented project and is necessary to evaluate 
the results of this research project in a real world context. 
The paper is structured as follows: Section II presents the 
state of the art. In Section III, we describe how the 
evaluation framework was developed, which is the basis for 
the analysis of different payment services (Section IV). The 
paper concludes in Section V, with an outlook to our future 
work and study design. 
II. 
STATE OF THE ART 
Analysis of the state of the art will start with Section A, 
in which the technological implementations of mobile 
payment services will be presented, followed by Section B,

which will provide an introduction to the acceptance factors 
of mobile payment services. 
 
A. Technological implementations of mobile payment 
services 
Mobile payment services can be classified according to 
technological designs and features that influence the 
payment process. The following classification is based on [5] 
and [6]: 
 
carrier medium, 
 
payment method, 
 
technology, 
 
type of payment system, 
 
payment process, and 
 
storage of sensitive customer data. 
Mobile payment services are differentiated according to 
the carrier medium that is used. In this study, smart phones 
and Near Field Communication (NFC)-cards are considered 
as media types. The second criterion is payment method. 
Possible types are debit as well as credit cards, pre-paid 
mechanisms and direct debit processes. Debit card payment 
either initiates account debiting immediately after the 
transaction at the point of sale or a couple of days later. 
Credit card payment does not initiate immediate debiting of 
the account, but enables a loan without interest for the rest of 
the month. The amounts of several transactions are 
accumulated and account debiting takes place at the end of 
each month. Pre-paid payment requires money to be 
deposited on a card or smart phone in advance. The payment 
method is accepted at the point of sale as long as the account 
balance is positive. 
An important issue is the technology that is used to 
communicate with the payment terminal at the point of sale. 
Common technologies are NFC, 2D-codes and bar codes. 
Payment systems operate either in form of so called open-
loop systems or closed-loop systems. Closed-loop systems 
involve one single bank that processes the transactions 
whereas open-loop systems involve several banks in the 
transaction process. Payment processes are either offline or 
online. Online payment processes require input of a PIN by 
the user at the terminal. This is necessary for identification of 
the card holder. The card is checked online and the 
transaction will be completed only after successful 
verification. Offline payment, on the other hand, does not 
include verification of the available payment limit at the 
bank in charge of the account. There is no identification and 
card verification at the point of sale and communication 
takes place only between smart phone or card and the 
terminal. There exist four main types of sensitive customer 
data storage. The construction-wise inclusion of the secure 
element embedded in the smart phone is one technical 
option. A major disadvantage of this type is the connection 
of the secure element and its data to a particular phone that 
cannot be transferred to another device. Another option is 
usage of micro-SD cards that are equipped with a secure 
element. These can be put in the micro-SD slot of the smart 
phone and transferred in case of device changes. The secure 
element can also be stored on the SIM card. As these are 
bound to a certain mobile network operator this might 
hamper changes of the mobile network operator. The fourth 
option is storage of sensitive customer data on a card that is 
equipped with an NFC chip. 
B. Acceptance factors of mobile payment services 
Many acceptance research studies of mobile payment 
acceptance are based on technology acceptance model 
(TAM) [7], and thus, incorporate perceived usefulness (PU) 
and perceived ease of use (PEOU) as main factors 
influencing behavioral intention (BI) to use, e.g., [8], [9], 
[10], etc. A comparative study in different cultural settings 
[8] included technology readiness as a personality trait in the 
original TAM. Results of this study indicate a significant 
positive effect of technology readiness on PEOU and PU as 
well as BI in most cultural settings. Individual mobility as a 
personal requirement regarding technology characteristics 
and perceived security resulted in positive effects on BI or 
attitude 
towards 
mobile 
payment 
in 
[4]. 
Personal 
innovativeness is another personality factor that has been 
tested with significant positive effects within the TAM 
framework [10]. This study also included technology 
characteristics such as convenience and reachability that 
showed positive effects on either PEOU or PU.  
Security is one of the most often tested technology 
characteristics. In most cases, it is operationalized as a 
perception of security [4]. It has also been empirically tested 
in the particular setting of mobile payment acceptance in 
tourism [11]. In some studies, security issues are regarded as 
aspects of perceived risk and operationalized within this 
construct [9] and [12].  
Trust is a construct that obtained particular interest within 
mobile payment acceptance research. Trust has been tested 
as an antecedent of PEOU and PU [3] and it has been found 
that it is affected by characteristics of the mobile technology 
itself and characteristics of the service provider, such as 
reputation. An examination of trust within the valence 
framework indicated highly dynamic effects of trust in 
internet payment and initial trust in mobile payment on 
negative valences (perceived cost and risk) and positive 
valence (relative advantage) that is affecting BI [2]. 
Other studies are based on unified theory of acceptance 
and use of technology (UTAUT) [13] and include social 
influence and other constructs in addition to PU and PEOU 
to explain BI. In [14], UTAUT was extended by the mobile 
payment specific factors trust and perceived security. Both 
factors resulted in significant effects on intention to use 
mobile wallets in the research model.  
Contextual issues have been included in various studies 
in different forms. We apply the multidisciplinary context 
model from [15] in order to classify these constructs and 
variables in a systematic way.  
 
Social context refers to people around the subject, 
their relationships to the subject, and interactions 
with the subject. Social context includes, for 
example, subjective norm [4], reference group 
evaluation [12], friends’ evaluation [12], etc.

ICDS 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Digital Society

 
Task context considers the particular objective of the 
present usage situation. It is interpreted [16] as a 
breadth of mobile payment use situations [12] or 
circumstances in use situations. 
 
Physical context includes all objects that are 
surrounding the subject and their current status and 
direction. Examples for the inclusion are the 
construct individual mobility [4] and compatibility 
[17], [2]. 
 
Temporal context is what gives the current usage 
situation a meaning like, e.g., past mobile payment 
use [12]. 
Value is a neglected factor in empirical research on 
mobile payment acceptance but is included in a theoretical 
model of mobile wallet adoption that has been applied in a 
case study [18]. N. Guhr et al. [8] define perceived value as 
“a trade-off between what customers receive, such as quality, 
benefits, and utilities, and what they sacrifice, such as price, 
opportunity cost, transaction cost, time and efforts” [18]. 
Finance-related risks, such as perceived costs, did not show 
significant effects on BI in an empirical study on acceptance 
of a card-based payment service [9]. A study on consumers’ 
willingness to pay for mobile payment services indicated that 
consumers are either not willing to pay any fee for using 
mobile payment or the fee varies between different 
purchased goods [16]. Value is not only important in the 
context of user acceptance but also in the bigger context of 
the eco-system. Cost for the bank server and security as 
technology quality were included in an analytic hierarchy 
process and turned out to be important factors within the 
context of technological mobile payment decisions [19].  
III. 
DEVELOPMENT OF EVALUATION FRAMEWORK 
In this chapter, the evaluation framework will be 
described. First, an overview to the Evaluation Process 
(Section A) will be provided, followed by the selection of 
acceptance factors in Section B. These factors will be 
operationalized in Section C. 
A. Evaluation Process 
The evaluation is illustrated in Figure 1 (Sequence 
Diagram Evaluation Process). It shows that the process was 
based on the identification of relevant acceptance factors 
through literature review. These factors were operationalized 
and applied to all selected MPS by the means of usage tests 
and expert interviews. MPS were selected based on a 
thorough desk research, in which all information and data 
available were collected. Further and deeper information was 
gathered through usage tests and expert interviews. As a 
result, for each MPS and each of the relevant acceptance 
factors, a classification was suggested, whether the potential 
of acceptance of the MPS at hand is to be considered high, 
medium, or low. The evaluation process was carried out 
from February to August 2013.  
This classification was based on a discussion process 
within the project team and double-checked by external MPS 
experts. Usability tests were not part of the analysis, as it can 
be assumed that this aspect will be covered in time before 
market launch of the MPS.  
 
Figure 1.  Sequence Diagram Evaluation Process 
B. Selecting acceptance factors 
Acceptance factors for the evaluation framework are 
derived from the literature review. PEOU and PU are the 
most widely used constructs to explain acceptance of mobile 
payment. Their concepts are provided in Table 1.

The original definition from [7] “the degree 
to which a prospective adopter believes that 
by using a particular system would improve 
his or her job performance” 
Attitude [12] 
“This construct can be taken to reflect an 
individual’s attitude towards a MPS, 
ranging from a very positive to a very 
negative assessment of the system’s utility.” 
PU [4] 
“[…] users are only willing to accept 
innovations if those innovations provide a 
unique advantage compared to existing 
solutions […]” 
Convenience 
[10] 
“Convenience is nothing but a combination 
of time and place utilities, which are clearly 
principal characteristics of m-payment.” 
 
Trust, perceived risks and (perceived) security were also 
included in many studies. Table 2 lists the various tested 
concepts.

TABLE II.  
SECURITY-RELATED FACTORS 
Construct 
Definition 
Perceived risk 
[2] 
“[…] extent to which prospective users expect mobile 
payment services to be uncertain or risky.” 
Initial mobile 
payment trust 
[2] 
“Trust is a subjective belief that a party will fulfill his or 
her obligations according to the expectations of the 
trusting party.” 
Perceived risk 
[9] 
“[…] the expectation of losses related to purchase […]” 
Perceived 
security [11] 
“[…] a threat which creates circumstance, condition or 
event with the potential to cause economic hardship 
[…]” 
MPS risk [12] 
“The MPS risk construct refers to the possible harmful 
consequences an individual expects from MPS use […]” 
Consumer 
trust [3] 
“[…] in the context of m-payments, the two dimensions 
of consumer trust are trust in mobile service provider 
and trust in technology facilitated by mobile service 
provider characteristics and mobile technology 
characteristics respectively.” 
Perceived 
environmental 
risk [3] 
“[…] is the risk associated with the underlying 
technological infrastructure […]” 
Perceived 
structural 
assurance [3] 
“[…] the consumer’s perception about the institutional 
environment […] 
Perceived 
security [4] 
“In the context of electronic services, security risk, 
conceptualized as the likelihood of privacy invasion, has 
been found to be a particularly critical concern […]” 
Perceived 
security [14] 
“[…] the degree to which a customer believes that using 
a particular mobile payment procedure will be secure.” 
Trust [14] 
“[…] the belief that vendors will perform some activity 
in accordance with customers’ expectations.” 
 
External factors, such as necessary hardware or software 
adaptations, are included in the analysis due to their 
influence on provider decisions whereas other factors, such 
as availability and provider characteristics, are excluded 
from this analysis as these are highly influenced by time and 
location of assessment, e.g., Google wallet is currently not 
available in Austria but might be in future. Personal 
character traits and social influence are also excluded for this 
analysis as they are strictly individual but will be included in 
a future field study. The same is true for the different 
concepts of value which will be in the focus of the field 
study. 
 
C. Operationalization of acceptance factors 
In a next step, the four major constructs were 
operationalized in order to obtain measures for mobile 
payment service usage tests and issues for the expert 
interviews. These methods were necessary, as detailed desk 
research on the technical features and functionalities was 
only partly able to cover the complexity of the topic at hand 
and usage tests were only possible for existing MPS. Details 
and functionalities regarding conceptualized MPS were 
obtained from interviews. 
The process of operationalization focused on mobile 
payment procedures and features of different services. 
Ease of use is analyzed considering the steps a user needs 
to take before using the mobile payment service and the 
process of each transaction. Moreover, some additional 
processes are considered such as PIN changes and payment 
history or analysis features. 
Usefulness is analyzed with regard to transaction speed, 
i.e., average time that is required per transaction, considering 
quicker transactions as more useful. Also, additional 
functionalities are examined, such as integration of loyalty 
cards or shop finder.  
Security is analyzed considering storage of sensitive 
customer data and risks that occur in operation. 
External factors that affect the ecosystem are considered 
in terms of required adaptations at the bank and point of sale 
in order to enable the MPS to operate. 
 
IV. 
ANALYSIS OF MOBILE PAYMENT SYSTEMS 
Ten different existing mobile payment services and 
feasible mobile payment concepts were included in the 
analysis. They cover different combinations of technical 
implementations and designs. As a limitation, it has to be 
stated that the selection of MPS is based on desk research 
and the project team’s understanding of the most possible 
combinations of technology and designs, no study or 
literature exists in this regard to suggest a different mode of 
selection: 
1. NFC debit card in an open-loop system enabling online 
and offline payments (e.g. PSA Payment Services 
Austria GmbH with all Austrian banks) 
2. NFC pre-paid card in a closed-loop system enabling 
offline payments (e.g. Quick by PayLife) 
3. NFC credit card in an open-loop system enabling online 
and offline payments (e.g. Mastercard PayPass and 
Visa PayWave) 
4. Debit/credit application for smart phones with 
additional NFC hardware in an open-loop system 
enabling online and offline payments (e.g. CardMobile) 
5. Barcode debit application for smart phones in an open-
loop system enabling online payments (e.g. Secure 
Payment Technologies GmbH - pilot test) 
6. Account-based 2D-code application for smart phone in 
an open-loop system enabling online and offline 
payments (e.g. CellumPay) 
7. NFC debit/credit wallet application for smart phone in 
an open-loop system enabling online payments (e.g. 
Google Wallet) 
8. NFC credit wallet application for smart phone in an 
open-loop system enabling online payments (e.g. 
myWallet by German Telekom) 
9. 2D-code debit/credit application for smart phone in a 
closed-loop system enabling online payments (e.g. 
Starbucks and Square) 
10. NFC debit application for smart phone in an open-loop 
system enabling online and offline payments (concept 
only) 
 
Table 3 provides an overview on relevant factors for 
assessing ease of use, taking into account aspects before 
usage, the process of transaction and additional aspects.

With regard to the required effort of users before usage 
and during each transaction, card-based MPS are most easy 
to use. Wallet applications are also easy to use and in most 
cases offer additional functionalities like in-application PIN 
changes that increase ease of use. Barcode-based MPS are 
least easy to use as they require additional activities in the 
course of each transaction process.

Usefulness (see Table 4) ought to be highest for wallet 
solutions as they include additional functionalities. The same 
is true for code-based MPS, but there is no information 
available regarding transaction speed of these services. Card-
based MPS are considered to be very fast considering 
transaction speed, and thus, increase user perceptions of 
usefulness but do not enable any additional functionalities.

Security issues, which are analyzed in Table 5, are rather 
balanced among MPS except for stored value technologies.

These might cause actual loss of money for the customer. 
Storage of sensitive customer data can influence ease of use 
as mobile phone and mobile network operator respectively 
are not easy to change in case of embedded secure elements 
or SIM-based secure elements. Transaction limits increase 
security, but may also harm ease of use and, in some cases, 
even usefulness, e.g., when transactions are made 
impossible. A similar effect is caused by PIN requirements. 
They increase security of the MPS but decrease ease of use 
and transaction speed.

Table 6 provides an overview of the relevant external 
factors for MPS analysis. Considering the point of sale, most 
MPS require adaptations with regard to terminals and 
software. Some are based on cash desk software adaptations 
as well. The most intrusive MPS design (number 6) even 
requires a connection between the point of sale and the 
remote server of the MPS provider. Effects on participating 
banks are minor to those on participating retailers. Those that 
require adaptations of the bank-wise core system are less 
likely to succeed unless initiated by the bank.

V. 
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK ON FUTURE WORK 
(FIELD STUDY DESIGN) 
Table 7 presents the results of the analysis, that indicate 
high potential of acceptance for NFC-based wallet MPS 
(number 7 and 8) and NFC card-based MPS (number 1, 2 
and 10). Face verification did obtain optimistic results in the 
analysis, but requires very intrusive external adaptations, 
and, moreover, does not support open-loop payment systems. 
Whereas high ease of use and high usefulness are positive 
indicators of overall acceptance, the effects of security on 
ease of use and usefulness can be either positive or negative.

In the field study design, card-based solutions will be 
tested against wallet MPS according to the obtained analysis 
results, taking the complex eco-system of mobile payment 
solutions into consideration. Therefore, a central aim of the 
field study will be the identification of those factors that add 
specific value to mobile payment and how these factors 
could be implemented successfully. “Success” will not only 
be measured by the extent of technology acceptance, but also 
by the extent to which the solutions are suitable for different 
personalities, use situations, social constellations etc., hence, 
taking a variety of context factors into account. The main 
research questions are: 
 What kind of differences with regard to acceptance can 
be identified between card-based solutions and MPS?  
 Are there acceptance differences between transaction 
types (debit vs. credit)?  
 Differences could be stated regarding relative benefits, 
perception of value, perceived complexity, security, 
trustworthiness, and consequences of PIN requirements 
and the like. 
 Which MPS is believed to be most successful (wisdom 
of crowds)? 
 How is the concept of “wallet” perceived and rated and 
what are customers’ associations and demands in this 
regard? 
 Are there any influences/changes on daily routines 
expected? What kind of influences/changes are there? 
Are they the same for all MPS? 
In order to tackle this huge variety of research questions 
and also taking the complex eco-system of MPS into 
account, the field study will consist of three parts, each 
applying different methods. In a field trial, 70 respondents 
will use two card-based solutions (debit, credit) and two 
mobile-phone-based MPS (debit, credit) over a period of two 
to three months complementing their common payment 
methods and provide feedback continually via standardized 
questionnaires, before, during and after the survey period. In 
addition in situ feedback will be provided via mobile 
questionnaire after each purchase. In total, each participant 
will be using MPS between eight and ten times at least, using 
each solution at least once. 
After the trial, a small number of participants will be 
invited to take part in a co-creation session in order to further 
optimize the identified most promising MPS and also in 
order to explore possible consequences for their daily lives. 
Besides the users’ point-of-view, the experiences and 
perspectives of the major stakeholders in the MPS eco-
system providing the test-setting (financial institute, 
acquirers, issuers, and retailers) will be thoroughly analysed 
by means of expert interviews.
