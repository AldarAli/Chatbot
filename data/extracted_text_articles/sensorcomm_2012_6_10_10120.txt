Abstract—Data for the availability of ambient light for a wrist-
attached senor node was gathered. The average energy harvest 
totaled 0.074 J/cm2/day when using a 1.8% efficiency, 0.6V 
DSSC (dye-sensitized solar cell) and 0.48 J/cm2/day when using 
a standard 16% efficiency, 0.65V mono-crystalline Si cell. The 
irradiance averaged for both indoor and outdoor activity of 
office employees was found to be equivalent to 0.78 W/m2 of 
solar spectrum light. At lower irradiation, the DSSC produced 
a higher open-circuit voltage but harvested less power than the 
Si solar cell.

 INTRODUCTION 
Solar power may be a viable solution for powering 
wearable sensor nodes. However, there is a scarcity of data 
on the actual harvestable power for wearable sensor nodes 
using photovoltaic cells. The actual power depends on the 
following factors: 
Primary (light-related) factors: 
The total irradiance (W/m2) 
The angular distribution of light from light sources 
The spectrum of the light sources 
The daily variability of the light sources 
The seasonal variability of light sources 
Secondary (harvester-related) factors: 
Type of solar cell 
Lifestyle of wearer 
Harvesting location on body 
 
Because of the many unknowns, solar cells have been 
considered too unpredictable to serve as a power source for 
wearable sensor nodes without using additional power 
management methods [1] [2]. Even for the total irradiance 
metric, wide and conflicting ranges have been reported, as 
summarized in Table 1. Therefore, experimental data on 
solar energy harvesting for wearable sensor nodes attached to 
the users’ wrists is provided in this paper. The reason 
irradiation data for wearable nodes has not been gathered 
before is because of the obtrusiveness and unreliability of 
past wearable sensor nodes. Previous sensor nodes required 
frequent maintenance, charging, and data downloading, thus 
affecting behavioral patterns of the person wearing a node. 
Because the behavioral patterns affect the irradiation 
measurements, a smaller, more autonomous sensor node was 
necessary for unbiased measurements. 
Recently, 
there 
have 
been 
several 
attempted 
implementations [3][4][5] of a wearable sensor node system 
utilizing solar cells. Therefore, a detailed assessment of the 
properties of ambient light is necessary for the proper 
selection of solar cell type – either high-efficiency at high 
irradiation level (Si cell) or more stable at lower irradiation 
and lower efficiency (DSSC).

In this paper, Section II describes measurement 
conditions and algorithms used for data processing. 
Section III presents the irradiance measurement results and 
calculations of the harvestable energy for the DSSC and Si 
solar cells. Section IV concludes that although the Si solar 
cell was more effective in overall energy harvesting, the 
DSSC cell provides more reliable energy harvesting.

MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE 
The measurement of light levels was done using the 
Indy2050 DSSC [11] attached to the wearable sensor node 
prototype LM03 provided by the University of Hyogo. The 
location of the experiment was Himeji, Japan. A photograph 
of the sensor node with solar cell is provided in Figure 1. 
The solar cell was connected directly to the voltage input of 
the ADC of the sensor node. To convert photocurrent (and 
hence the irradiance) to a voltage signal, a resistor was 
connected in parallel with the solar cell.

Figure 1.  Photo of the measurement setup. 
Because the ADC embedded in the sensor node had 
insufficient dynamic range, two setups were prepared: first 
with a 100 Ohm resistor, giving a measurement range of 1 to 
400 W/m2, and second with a 10 kOhm resistor, giving a 
measurement range 0.01 to 4 W/m2. The two setups were 
worn by different users (both working in the same lab), and 
were swapped between users twice per week. A larger 
number of experimental setups was prepared, but severe 
hardware problems of the highly-experimental LM03 sensor 
node resulted in only two setups being operational. The ADC 
was sampled 20 times per second, and data was stored on a 
MicroSD card inside the sensor node. Ten days of recorded 
data (from April 1 to April 11) were downloaded to the PC 
on April 12, 2012 and processed. Processing included the 
removal of anomalous data (whenever time stamp showed 
discontinuity due sensor node being shut down) and simple 
averaging of samples down to a data rate of 1 sample per 
second. Also, the data from both setups was merged into a 
single dataset using the measured photocurrent-to-voltage 
gain and the ADC’s offset voltages. The solar cell efficiency 
versus irradiance for the Indy2050 DSSC solar cell and 
typical Si cell was measured before starting energy 
harvesting measurements. The data on the efficiency of the 
Indy2050 solar cell and typical Si cell (extracted from [1]) is 
shown in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2.  Efficiency of the DSSC and Si cells versus irradiance. 
Power efficiency of the solar cell is not the only 
important property for energy harvesting. The open circuit 
voltage is also important. Since dark current is the dominant 
cause of efficiency loss, the open-circuit voltage drops to 
half of the nominal value at a corresponding power 
efficiency of 25% of nominal. At low irradiation levels, the 
DSSC cell [11] produces higher open-circuit voltages (0.6V), 
enabling the use of less demanding power converters in the 
sensor node. Below that point, energy harvesting for the 
solar cells becomes complicated because the supplied 
voltage becomes insufficient to drive CMOS low-leakage 
transistors above their threshold voltage. For the DSSC, the 
voltage-limited harvesting threshold was found to be 0.7 
W/m2 compared to 2.0 W/m2 for the mono-crystalline Si cell. 
III. 
MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
The raw irradiance data averaged over 10 days was 
normalized for 1-day intervals (86,400 seconds) with a 
sampling rate of 1 sample/s (see Figure 3) and binned using 
thresholds listed in Table 2. The data from Table 2 is plotted 
on Figure 3. The probability peak at 0.2-0.5 W/m2 most 
likely corresponds to indoor conditions, while the smaller 
peak at 2-5 W/m2 may be attributed to outdoor light. The 
averaged time series of the irradiance can be seen in Figure 4. 
The peak at about 9am corresponds to transit to the 
workplace. The broad peak about midday corresponds to 
daylight leaking through the office windows and to 
lunchtime activity, and the peak around 5pm corresponds to 
the transit from the workplace to home.

Figure 3.  The probability distribuiton of irradiance. 
Multiplying the probability distribution from Figure 3 
with the geometric average of the power flux (irradiance) in 
a given bin results in a new metric: the harvestable energy 
per irradiance bin. Integrating the harvestable energy per 
irradiance bin results in the cumulative harvestable energy 
metric. This metric is useful if it is necessary to decide at 
which irradiance level the solar battery should start 
harvesting and to determine what losses are expected from 
not harvesting at lower irradiance levels. The harvestable 
energy and cumulative harvestable energy plots are shown in 
Figure 5. From Figure 5 it is shown that 99% of the 
harvestable radiant flux occurs at irradiances above 0.2 
W/m2 and 50% occurs at irradiancies above 5 W/m2.

Figure 5.   Harvestable energy and cumulative harvestable energy. 
Finally, the effect of the reduced efficiency of solar cells at 
lower irradiance levels should be taken into account. 
Multiplying solar cell efficiency from Figure 1 by the 
harvestable energy from Figure 5 results in harvested energy 
as a function of irradiance. Figure 6 shows that because of 
the low performance of existing solar cells in low light 
conditions, most energy is harvested at irradiance 10-50 
W/m2. The DSSC cell used (designated by maker as an 
indoor energy harvester) performs more consistently at 
various light levels compared to Si cell, but it still fails to 
harvest energy efficiently at irradiation range 0.2-0.5 W/m2 
corresponding to typical indoor lighting conditions.

CONCLUSION 
The parameters of harvestable light for wearable sensor 
nodes worn on the wrist of a typical office worker were 
measured. Harvestable solar energy for the DSSC and mono-
crystalline silicon solar cell was estimated. The results are 
written in Table 3.

For the tested DSSC solar cell, average power available 
at the solar cell terminals was 7.7uW (for cell area of 9 cm2). 
Because the LM03 sensor node does not have any facility for 
power conversion, estimation of the conversion efficiency 
and storage efficiency was not attempted. Typical conversion 
and storage efficiency reported in literature was 11-18%  
[12]. 
The authors are continuing to gather data in order to 
reduce random errors and ultimately to acquire the 
dependence of the harvested energy on the season of year.  
The authors believe that DSSC is more promising for 
indoor light energy harvesting. The important property of 
DSSC is the ability to deliver high voltages at low irradiation 
levels. Harvesting energy at low levels of irradiation reduces 
the probability of sensor node brownout, because low-light 
conditions (0.2-0.5 W/m2) are very common for a typical 
office employee lifestyle (see Figure 2). Therefore, DSSC-
based sensor node may have a smaller, cheaper battery 
subsystem. To more fully utilize energy from indoor lighting, 
further effort is necessary to reduce the dark current by 65% 
to 75% and simultaneously increase the efficiency of the 
commercially available DSSC to at least 8%.
