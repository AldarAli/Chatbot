Abstract—The aim of this study is to investigate whether it is
possible to estimate internal power in walking and running with a
smart sock which is equipped with textile pressure sensors. Since
commercially available smart socks are already used by runners
to classify injury-prone running styles, such as running with
low cadence and heel-striking, incorporating power measurement
into the socks would make the usage of a separate power meter
obsolete. While walking and running with different velocities and
gradients on a treadmill, four subjects wore a pair of smart
socks as well as a Stryd power meter as a reference system.
The measurements from the pressure sensors were used to train
regression algorithms, such as linear regression, trees of linear
regressions (M5P), random forest, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
to predict power. Preliminary results after a total of 42 runs
show that depending on the actually used regression algorithm
correlation coefﬁcients between 0.75 and 0.99 and a mean absolute
error between 1.5 and 21.8 Watts could be achieved. Although
these results appear promising, the number of participants and
test runs must be increased signiﬁcantly in order to arrive at
valid conclusions.

INTRODUCTION
Together with measuring training volume, determining
intensity is one of the most important measures to quantify
physical stress or training load on athletes [1] which can
subsequently be used to prescribe and adapt training [2] as well
as make predictions [3]. While in the past heart rate or velocity
have been mainly used to gauge intensity, we can nowadays
observe an increased use of power meters in distance running
[4]. They are superior to heart-rate measurements since they
react instantly and are not prone to cardiac drift, and they are
better than deriving the intensity from the velocity because
changing external conditions such as wind and hills can be
taken into account [5].
Commercially available power meters, such as Stryd [6] or
RunScribe [7] are based on inertial measurements units and
designed as small footpods, which are mounted directly on
the shoe. With the increasing popularity of smart textiles in
sports, such as Sensoria’s smart socks [8] or Hexoskin’s smart
garments [9], it seems promising to investigate whether it is
basically possible to estimate power in walking and running
with a smart sock equipped with textile pressure sensors [10].
Incorporating power measurement into the socks would make
the usage of a separate power meter obsolete.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In
Section 2 we review the related work, in Section 3 we describe
the study design, then we continue with a discussion of the
results in Section 4, and conclude with Section 5, in which
we brieﬂy summarize our ﬁndings and discuss possible future
work.

RELATED WORK
Because power is deﬁned as the derivative of work, it is
sufﬁcient for our discussion to ﬁrst deal with the determination
of work while walking or running. Cavagna [11] measures the
external work by means of a force plate to record the horizontal
and vertical components of the resultant force applied by the
body to the ground and air. Forward and vertical velocities
are then calculated by integrating the force signals, which
allows determining the kinetic energy in forward and upward
directions, as well as the potential energy caused by the vertical
displacement of the center of mass. However, as this only
gives external work, i.e., it does not take into account the
energy needed to swing the legs and arms, internal energy
is determined by means of a cinematographic analysis [12]
which calculates the kinetic and potential energy of the body
segments relative to the center of mass.
Since this is difﬁcult to perform outside a controlled
laboratory environment, van Dijk and van Megen [5] assume
the energy expenditure of running (Cr) which is based on
indirect calorimetry with 0.98 J/kg/m and add the energy to
overcome the air resistance, as well as the inﬂuence of uphill
and downhill running. Of course, assuming a ﬁxed Cr value
does not allow for different running surfaces [13] or running
economy, nor does it consider walking where the energy cost
varies as a function of velocity. Contemporary power meters

for running therefore combine both approaches: they estimate
external power with accelerometers mounted on the subject
and then assume a gross metabolic efﬁciency of around 25%
to map mechanical energy to metabolic energy [14].
Oks et al. [15] show that ground contact time can be
adequately measured with a smart sock system with piezo-
resistive knitted structures. One sock has six pressure sensors
to gather the data. Validation was performed for walking, race-
walking and running with an optical system as well as a force
plate. Petz et al. [10] show that a smart sock system with
three piezo-resistive pressure sensors can be used to detect
steps and to make reasonable statements about the subject’s
activity. Smart sock systems are also used for gait analysis
and foot pressure control for human locomotion and to detect
excessive pronation and supination [16][17]. Again, the system
consists of piezo-resistive sensors and conductive lines knitted
in. Foot strike patterns are important characteristics in human
locomotion. The strike types – heel strike, mid foot and fore
foot strike [18][19] – can be classiﬁed with a smart socks
system [20].
Since smart socks with pressure sensors have been previ-
ously successfully used to detect various gait-related param-
eters and to the best of our knowledge there are no studies
trying to predict internal power with smart socks, the aim of
this study is to investigate, whether it is possible to estimate
internal power with a smart textile.

METHODS
In this section we describe how we gathered the training
data from numerous runs on a treadmill and show how we
processed the data so that it could be fed into the machine
learning suite to derive regression algorithms.
A. Participants
Four recreational runners (two male, two female) took
part in our study. The runners’ age is between 18 and 28
(average age: 26.5, SD=0.5) and their weekly running volume
is between 10 and 20 kilometers. All of them are heel-strikers.
In total, 42 test runs have been gathered so far. The study is
still work in progress and therefore the number of participants
and test runs is quite small.
B. Study design
Participants had to wear a pair of smart socks [10] (Figure
1), as well as a Stryd sensor together with a Garmin Fenix 3
sports watch to record the power data from the Stryd power
meter (Figure 2). They were then instructed to walk or run
100 meters on a treadmill with velocities of 4 km/h, 6 km/h, 8
km/h, and 10 km/h, each velocity with different gradients (0,
4, 6, and 8 percent).
For each run, we measured and recorded the power output
with a Stryd sensor, as well as the sensor data from the smart
sock system, which in addition to the pressure measurements
also contains rotation and acceleration, which, however, are not
yet used in the analysis. Using various regression algorithms,
we then predicted the power measurement given by Stryd with
sensor data gathered with the smart sock. We used the Stryd
sensor instead of a test setup with a force plate such as in
[11][12], or a metabolic cart because our aim is simply to
ﬁnd out whether a correlation between pressure measurements
from the socks and internal power can be found and according
Figure 1. Smart socks with sensors and data acquisition unit provide the
independent variables for the analysis.
to Cerezuela-Espejo et al. [4] there is a close relation between
power output and VO2.
Figure 2. The dependent variable power output is measured with the Stryd
sensor and recorded on a Garmin watch.
C. Devices
Measurements were performed on a Technogym MYRUN
treadmill. Our smart socks developed by Petz et al. [10] (see
Figure 1) have three piezo-resistive sensors placed according
to the foot strike pattern, six conductive lines and a data
acquisition unit. One sensor (referred to as MTB1) is placed
in the left front, one sensor (MTB5) is in the right front and
the third sensor (Heel) is located in the heel part of the sock.
The sensors are sampled at a rate of 160 Hz and the recorded
data is transferred to an Android smartphone and stored as a
CSV ﬁle.
The Stryd power meter (ﬁrmware version 2.0.2) is con-
nected to a Garmin Fenix 3 sports watch (ﬁrmware version
5.40) that stores power data and cadence. The Garmin watch
stores data in the .ﬁt ﬁle format and uploads the recordings

to the Garmin Connect website. We use the FIT File Explorer
[21], version 2.3, to retrieve the data from the .ﬁt ﬁle.
D. Data Processing
After collecting the smart sock data from the smartphone
and power data as well as cadence from the .ﬁt ﬁle, we
calculate an arithmetic mean over the measured sensor values
to generate features for the regression analyses (Figure 3).

Since we use the WEKA machine learning suite [22],
the features are stored in the Attribute Relation File Format
(ARFF). To process the data, ten input variables have been
considered from the smart socks, and two input variables from
the Garmin watch along with the output from Stryd. These
are averages of the three sensor pressure sensors (MTB1 (p1),
MTB5 (p2), heel (p3), cadence (c) and power (p). Additionally,
velocity (v) of the run, gradient (g), and related user infor-
mation such as age (a), height (h), and mass (m) are also
recorded. The units of measurements are shown in the ARFF

We then tried different combinations of independent vari-
ables and different regression algorithms to ﬁnd out which
combination performed best. Since the number of instances in
our data set is yet quite small and we want models that are
computationally inexpensive, we go for simple algorithms such
as linear regression, decision trees with regressions (M5P),
random forest and K-nearest neighbours. In WEKA, we used
the default settings for each regression algorithm, as well as
tenfold cross-validation.
IV.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Since most runners nowadays routinely wear a GPS-
enabled device such as a smart phone or sports watch, we
ﬁrst try to deﬁne a baseline by determining how well we
can estimate power based on velocity, gradient, and mass.
Hence, we can ﬁnd out whether estimating power with the
smart sock offers any added value at all. Even a simple
linear regression with v, g, and m as independent variables
(p = 23.220v − 0.0568m − 0.3489g − 24.2518) is able to
approximate the Stryd data quite well (see Tables I and II for
correlation coefﬁcients and mean absolute errors).
Next, we want to predict the power output based solely
on the signals coming from the pressure sensors. The linear
regression model p = −0.0418p1 − 0.0385p2 + 0.0915p3 +
35.819 (r = 0.74) can be minimally improved by additionally
considering mass which gives p = 1.8752m − 0.0468p1 −
0.0356p2 + 0.1679p3 − 290.0082 (r = 0.75).
Since the cost of locomotion and therefore power is quite
different for walking and running [23], with a U-shaped curve
and a distinct minimum at the preferred walking speed of
approx. 1.3 m s−1, while it remains constant across run-
ning speeds, non-linear regression-algorithms perform better.
Weka’s M5P approximates a continuous function by building
a decision tree where each leaf has a linear regression model;
with p1, p2, p3 as independent variables, the regression coef-
ﬁcient r is 0.88.
Random forest and KNN achieve even better results (see
Tables I and II). However, both methods are not able to
extrapolate and therefore – with our limited data set – will
perform poorly for power data outside of 61 to 206 Watts.

Since steps can be easily detected and derived from either
acceleration or pressure signals which is done in [10], we could
determine cadence c and estimate the power output with p =
0.0323m+2.9232c (r = 0.98). Currently, we use cadence data
from Stryd. Combining c with the pressure readings does not
improve the result (p = −0.6921m + 0.0143p2 − 0.0437p3 +
3.2741c+38.0002, r = 0.98), which means that we can predict
Stryd’s power data with cadence and mass alone quite well.

However, this is certainly only possible when running on
a treadmill without external inﬂuences, such as headwind
or tailwind and the uniform nature of the running surface.
Deriving VO2 and hence power from step-rate alone is well
known and, e.g., used in pedometers [24].

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we described how to estimate internal power
using smart socks equipped with three piezo-resistive pressure
sensors.
Under ideal conditions on a treadmill without any head-
wind or tailwind and on a uniform running surface, using the
pressure sensors alone does not perform better than basing the
estimation on velocity and gradient or cadence. However, given
the right regression algorithm, the estimation is also not much
worse which means that it can provide power data without
GPS, which would be the case under dense foliage or indoors.
Basing the estimation on cadence, which can be derived
from the pressure sensors, gives – at least under ideal con-
ditions – a better result than using the average pressure data.
However, when running on sand or grass or with headwind,
the assumption of approx. 0.98 J/kg/m is not valid anymore
and using pressure data might be applicable.
Since the preliminary results seem promising, we plan to
increase the number of participants, and perform more runs
at different velocities and gradients as well as take different
running surfaces such as sand or grass into account.
