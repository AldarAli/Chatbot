Abstract—In this paper, we introduce new concept for femtocells
with the purpose to minimize cross-tier interference to the macro-
cell users (MUEs). The cross-tier interference is mitigated by the
power control algorithm minimizing the power level and, thus,
ensuring that all currently active femto users (FUEs) can attach
to the femto access points (FAPs). To guarantee quality of service
to the FUEs even at heavy load, despite low transmitting power,
the FAPs can opportunistically utilize also SU bands. To that end,
we denote our scheme as a hybrid cognitive approach, which is
distinguished by the fact that the FAPs can access bandwidth as
a primary users (PU) and secondary users (SU) at the same time.
In order to generate less overhead introduced by sensing for the
purpose of determining available spectrum, we also propose an
algorithm that adaptively changes a sensing period. The results
show that our proposal is able to signiﬁcantly reduce cross-tier
interference nearly to the same level as achieved by algorithms
focusing on maximization of the MUEs’ performance. At the same
time, our proposal ensures that the performance of the FUEs is
kept at satisfactory level similarly as in the case of the algorithms
focusing solely on the performance of the FUEs.

INTRODUCTION
The Femto Access Points (FAPs) are small base stations
deployed mostly indoor to cover locations with weak signal
from a Macro Base Station (MBS) and to enhance performance
of indoor users. The FAP can be classiﬁed depending on its
access strategy into three types [1]: i) open access - the users
have no restriction in accessing the FAPs, ii) closed access -
only small group of users can connect to the FAPs, and iii)
hybrid access a combination of both previous strategies. The
FAPs can use either different frequency bands than the MBS
(i.e., dedicated channel deployment) or share (fully/partly) the
same bandwidth as the MBS (i.e., co-channel deployment) [2].
As pointed out by Hobby and Claussen [3], the main con-
cern regarding the implementation of the FAPs is to guarantee
that the macrocell users (MUEs) are not negatively affected
by the FAPs, if closed access is considered and co-channel
deployment is used. At the same time, the challenge is to
achieve high performance of femtocell users (FUEs) to enable
high data transmission within the coverage of the FAP. This is
not a trivial problem, especially if a lot of FAPs are supposed
to be deployed.
One feasible option to reduce interference is to use various
power control approaches. Claussen et al. [4] propose three
self-optimization schemes aimed to minimize interference to
outdoor MUEs and to minimize number of generated han-
dovers. Although the proposed power control can signiﬁcantly
mitigate the amount of handovers, the MUEs close to the
FAP experience low SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise
Ratio). In addition, the self-optimization schemes do not
always guarantee sufﬁcient house coverage. Jo et al. [5] aim to
minimize interference caused by the FAPs to passersby users,
while providing sufﬁcient indoor coverage. Yun and Cho [6]
propose to adapt the FAPs power depending on the queue
length at the FAP. If the queue length is low, the FAP decreases
its transmitting power. In the opposite case, the FAPs power
is increased in order to serve all generated data. In [7], we
have designed Quality of Service guaranteed power control
(QPC) algorithm. The transmitting power of the FAP is adapted
not only according to current trafﬁc load like in [6] but also
according to the signal quality among the FUEs and the FAP
in order to fully utilize data frame at physical layer. Still,
schemes based on [6][7] are highly effective only for lower
trafﬁc loads. At heavy trafﬁc loads, the power of the FAP has
to be increased to satisfy all FUEs requirements and cross-tier
interference rises as well.
Other eligible option for interference avoidance is to exploit
cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum management [8]. Yu et
al. [9] consider that the FAPs are able autonomously sense the
radio frequencies used by the MBS and, thus, to schedule their
transmission at unoccupied frequency spectrum. In addition,
the optimal period for sensing of free radio resources is
derived. Dynamic spectrum reuse in network with closed
access FAPs is proposed by Demirdogen et al. in [10]. If the
MUE is close to the FAP, the FAP equipped with cognitive
radio decides whether to occupy the same frequencies or not
(perfect sensing is assumed). Li and Sousa [11] view the
FAP as a secondary system, which autonomously allocates
orthogonal channels to avoid disturbing the MBS and its users.
The objective to minimize interference among the FAPs is
addressed by Li et al. in [12]. The FAPs cognitively recog-
nize unoccupied frequencies and schedule their transmission
accordingly. All above mentioned papers assume that the FAPs
use only resources not currently utilized by the MBSs.
Rubaye et al. [13] exploit wider bandwidth by the FAPs
than the MBS to support high demanding services in indoor
environment. This work is further elaborated by Xie et al. in
[14], where the idea is to use wider bandwidth by leasing
available spectrum from other PSs. The authors consider

leasing available spectrum among the MBSs only. Then, the
leased spectrum is dynamically assigned to the FAPs to support
high demanding services in indoor environment. Both [13] and
[14] are solely focused on performance of indoor users and the
negative impact of the FAPs on the MUEs is not addressed.
In summary, the power control alone is not always able
to mitigate cross-tier interference to the MUEs while satis-
fying QoS for the FUEs. At the same time, disadvantage of
conventional cognitive approaches is that the amount of radio
resources available to the secondary users (SUs) is highly
dependent on activity of primary users (PUs). In this paper,
the minimization of cross-tier interference is accomplished by
power control, which sets transmission power of the FAPs only
to such level that all active FUEs are able to connect to the
FAP. In order to compensate for low transmitting power, we
further introduce new concept, where the FAPs could access
radio resources as a PU and SU simultaneously. Hence, if the
PU bandwidth is not sufﬁcient, the FAP can opportunistically
use SU bands. The main advantage of this approach is that the
FAPs are not fully dependent on other PU(s) and have always
some radio resources at disposition. Since the FAPs are not
able to transmit or receive any data when sensing is being
performed [9], we try to maximize the proﬁt obtained from the
opportunistic usage of SU bands. To this end, we propose new
algorithm minimizing the sensing time and sensing overhead,
where the sensing period is adaptively changed depending on
the loads of the FAP and other PUs.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next
section describes the system model together with problem
formulation. Section III describes proposed power control
algorithm and algorithm for dynamic change of sensing pe-
riod. The simulation methodology and simulation results are
addressed in Section IV and Section V, respectively. The
discussion regarding simulation results are tackled in Section
VI. The last section gives our conclusions and future work
plans.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
The system model considers three cellular operators (de-
noted as Operator A, Operator B, and Operator C) covering
the same geographic area. The same frequency bandwidth is
assigned to each operator. In order not to interfere with each
other, allocated frequency bandwidths are not overlapping (i.e.,
each operator has dedicated its own bandwidth). We assume
that the FAPs deployed in the area use primarily frequency
bandwidth allocated to Operator A, i.e., the FAPs use this
bandwidth as a PUs and this frequency band is referred to as
a Primary Frequency (PF). Further, we assume that all FAPs
have cognitive sensing capabilities and can utilize frequency
bands of other two operators. Consequently, the FAPs use
frequencies of Operator B and Operator C as SUs. In this
paper, these bands are referred to as a Secondary Frequency
(SF). Note that the SF band can be composed from more than
one secondary system. In addition the FAPs could, in general,
access not just frequency bands assigned to other operators
but also other available free spectrum can be utilized for our
purpose.
Our study is narrowed down, without loss of generality,
to area covered by one MBS of every operator as indicated

OH represents
the number of REs in one RB dedicated for signaling overhead
(e.g., reference signals or control information). The parameter
Γ indicates the quantity of bits sent per RE and it depends
on selected modulation and coding scheme (MCS) assigned
according to the measured SINR. The amount of RBs per

where ηj is the amount of data sent in downlink (DL)

consisting of twenty RBs (mRB ) in time domain. In frequency
domain, quantity of RBs per one frame (χ) depends on selected
bandwidth (χ varies between 6 and 110). As a consequence,
the amount of RBs available for a FAP during one frame within
PF band is
np
RB = χ × mRB.

Similarly, the amount of radio resources available in SF
bands can be expressed as

RB represent the quantity of RBs cur-
rently used by the MBSs of Operator B and Operator C. To
decide, which radio resources at SF bands are not occupied,
the FAPs are equipped with sensing functionality. The physical
frames are sorted into sensing and data frames. The FAPs
perform sensing solely during the sensing frames while the
data frames are dedicated only for data transmission (including
signaling). The overhead caused by the sensing of the i-th
FAP is indirectly proportional to sensing period, Ts, and it is
calculated as
σi = np

(7)
where Tf represents length of one frame.
In general, the paper aims at addressing two problems. The
ﬁrst problem is to minimize FAPs transmitting power to avoid
cross-tier interference to the MUEs. Thus, if we deﬁne Pmin
and Pmax as the minimal and maximal transmitting power of
the FAPs and Sj = {si
1, si
2, ..., si
g} as a set of experienced
SINR of q active FUEs connected to FAP i, our goal is to

where Pmin ≤ pt,i ≤ Pmax, SINRmin represents the
minimal value of SINR guaranteeing that the FUE is able to
connect to the FAP and parameter δ stands for fading margin
to have certain reserve to protect FUEs again fading effects.
The second problem is to minimize the sensing overhead
and, thus, to maximize throughput for FUEs despite low
transmitting power of the FAPs. Sensing overhead is a function
of the current FUEs requirements (nRB,r), the amount of radio
resources in PF band (np
RB) and in SF bands (ns
RB). Hence,
the second objective is formulated as

PROPOSED SCHEME
The basic principle of the proposed scheme is depicted
in Fig. 2. The FAP accesses the frequency band of Operator
A as a PU. Note that the whole bandwidth of Operator A
can be used by the FAP when compared, e.g., to [9] or
[10], where only fraction of bandwidth, not occupied by the
MBS, is available to the FAPs. To guarantee minimal cross-
tier interference to MUEs of Operator A, the power of the
FAP is set only to such level to maintain reliable connection
between the FAP and its worst FUE (i.e., the FUE with the
lowest SINR). Thus, the worst FUE has to utilize a more robust
MCS (in Fig. 2, the FUE2 is the worst FUE and hence it uses
1/3 QPSK [16]). On the other hand, the radio channel between
the FAP and the FUE1 is of a better quality. As a result, more
efﬁcient MCS is applied (in Fig. 2, 2/3 16QAM is shown as an
example). The QoS of the FUEs would be degraded if only PF
band is used by the FAP and if FUE’s requirements exceed the
number of available RBs at PF. An increase of power of the
FAP can result in high cross-tier interference to the MUEs.
Therefore, we rather suggest utilizing additional RBs of the
Operator B and Operator C that are not currently used.
Our proposal is composed of two algorithms: power control
algorithm and algorithm for dynamic adaptation of sensing
period. These are described in detail in the next subsections.

A. Power control algorithm
The ﬂow chart of the power control algorithm is depicted
in Fig. 3. First, the FAP discovers whether there is at least one
active FUE. This is continuously determined after expiration
of adaptation interval ∆t. If no data are transmitted, the
power of the FAP is set to its minimal value (Pmin) to
decrease a probability of interference to the close MUEs.
In the opposite case, the transmitting power of the FAP is
adjusted according to channel quality between the FAP and
active FUEs. The transmitting power of the FAP is decreased
by power adaptation step ∆P if
∀sj ∈ Sj| sj > (SINRmin + δ + ∆P) .
(12)
The transmitting power after each iteration cannot exceed
its minimal allowed value (Pmin). Note that parameter ∆P
serves as a kind of hysteresis to guarantee that the power is
not decreased if the power was increased in the previous ∆t.
The transmitting power of the FAP is incremented by ∆P if
∃sj ∈ Sj| sj < (SINRmin + δ) .
(13)
Similarly as in previous case, the FAP can increase its
transmitting power only to Pmax.
The example of power adaptation according to the observed
SINR is depicted in Fig. 4 where we assume, for the sake of
clarity, that just one active FUE is attached to the FAP. At
the beginning of the process, the transmitting power is set to
Pmax and subsequently is decreased until sj = SINRmin +
δ +κ, where κ varies between 0 and ∆P (see Fig. 4). As long
as the SINR is within allowed limits (i.e., SINRmin + δ <
sj < SINRmin + δ + ∆P ), the power remains the same.
Note that slow ﬂuctuation of SINR in Fig. 4 can be caused by
slow movement of indoor users, not by different transmitting
power of the FAP. The FUEs SINR can be temporarily not
within allowed limits due to fading effects (in Fig. 4 indicated
by variable η). If the SINR is suddenly increased, there is
no harm for the FUE and transmitting power of the FAP is
subsequently decreased. In the opposite case when the SINR is
abruptly decreased, the outage can occur. This phenomenon is
illustrated in Fig. 4 by sudden drop of SINR below SINRmin
during ∆out. As a consequence, the transmission power of
the FAP is increased step by step as long as all active FUEs
experience sufﬁcient SINR. The time when the FUE is in the
outage needs to be minimized. This could be accomplished
by proper setting of the power control parameters such as ∆t,
∆P and δ. Due to space limitations and since the paper is
rather focused on introduction of hybrid cognitive approach,
the optimization setting of individual parameters is left for
future research.
B. Algorithm for dynamic adaptation of sensing period
If radio resources at the PF band are not sufﬁcient for
the FUEs, the FAP can access also SF bands, if available.
In order not to interfere with the MUEs of Operator B and
Operator C, the FAP has to be aware of which RBs are
currently utilized at SF bands. This is accomplished by sensing

the transmissions at SF to avoid interference. Contrary to [9],
where ﬁxed Ts is assumed we propose to set Ts dynamically
depending on current trafﬁc load of both the FAP and SF
bands. The objective is to minimize the overhead generated
by the sensing algorithm, i.e., to perform sensing only if it is
proﬁtable for the FAP.
The proposed algorithm for dynamic change of the Ts is
depicted in Fig. 5. The sensing procedure is initiated after
the power control is performed and once the required amount
of RBs for DL transmission is derived. After the sensing is
complete, it is evaluated if the amount of radio resources
available for the FAP at the PF band is sufﬁcient with respect to
users requirements (i.e., if np
RB > nRB,r). If this is the case,
the Ts is set to its maximal value to minimize the sensing
overhead. In this situation, the sensing is redundant, since
the FAP uses only PF band. Nevertheless, it is still proﬁtable
to perform sensing occasionally to have overview regarding
utilization of radio resources in SF bands. In this case, the
algorithm sets Secondary Spectrum Usage Indicator (SSUI) to
”0”. The SSUI distinguishes whether the FAP allocates data
only at PF or at both PF and SF.

Flow chart of proposed sensing algorithm.
As soon as the amount of RBs available for the FAP at
PF band is not sufﬁcient (i.e., if np
RB < nRB,r), the SSUI
is switched to 1. After that, Ts is decreased to Tmin. This
ensures that the FAP has up to date knowledge on utilization
of the SF. Hence, the possibility of the FAP’s interference
to other PSs is minimized. On the contrary, the amount of
generated overhead is increased. As long as the FAP requires
additional radio resources to transmit all data, the length of Ts
is dynamically changed depending on utilization of SF band
by its PUs. Note that the sensing decreases the performance
of the FAP if
np

(14)
since the sensing overhead is higher than available RBs at
SF bands.
If the SF bands are currently overloaded and most of their
radio resources are used, the proposed algorithm increases the
length of sensing and, thus, decreases sensing overhead. The Ts
is continuously increased until it is equal to Tmax or until the
load in SF band is decreased sufﬁciently. Contrary, Ts can be
shortened when the amount of RBs at SF band is sufﬁcient and,
hence, more up to date knowledge of SF utilization minimize
the probability of interference to other PSs.
The important aspect in sensing procedure is to estimate if
RBs are utilized by other PSs or not. In this paper, we assume
perfect sensing when the estimation whether RB is occupied
or not is without errors similarly as in [10]. The reason is that
the main purpose of this paper is not to propose new sensing
techniques but we just exploit the ability of the FAP to perform
the sensing.
IV.
SIMULATION SETUP
To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme,
simulations in MATLAB have been performed. Although the
proposal is applicable to any OFDMA-based system, we use
simulator based on FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) LTE-A
(Release 10) with parameters set-up aligned with Small cell
forum as presented in Table I. The movement of MUEs is
restricted by sidewalks boundary (see Fig. 1). The MUEs are
moving along straight trajectories from south to north with a
speed of 1 m/s. Their distance from the house boundary is
randomly generated with equal distribution between 1 and 3
meters. The intensity of MUEs arrival to the system follows
Poisson distribution and it corresponds approximately to 140
passing users per hour. The movement of the FUEs within
the house is based on [4]. At the beginning of the simulation,
a start position for all FUEs is randomly selected at some
waypoint (four FUEs are considered within each house).
After that, the FUEs are moving along predeﬁned trajectories
between waypoints and points of decision as depicted in Fig.
7. The time spent by a FUE at the waypoint is described by
normal distribution and differs for each room (parameters µ
and σ of the distribution are also derived from [4]).
In the simulation, seven positions of the FAPs are selected
in a distance varying between 1m to 7m from the house
boundaries (see Fig. 6).
The path loss in indoor environment is calculated according
to ITU-RP.1238 model. For evaluation of path loss in outdoor
environment, COST 231 empirical model is used. Both se-
lected path loss models are assumed, since these are widely
used in the evaluation of femtocell concepts [17].
The amount of RBs available in SF band is indirectly
proportional to trafﬁc loads experienced by the MBSs of
Operator B and Operator C. In the simulation, the trafﬁc load
of both MBSs varies between 50% and 100% with mean
trafﬁc load set approximately to 65%. This corresponds to the
scenario when system is at heavy load state. The variation
of the trafﬁc load of the MBSs depends on activity/inactivity
of MUEs of Operator B and Operator C. The MUEs change
their status from active to inactive and vice versa by means of
simple two state Markov model with the probability of 20%
Utility

Room

that the status of activity is changed. In addition, the outdoor
MUEs are supposed to use more voice than data and, thus,
voice is applied in 60% while FTP model is applied in 40%.
In the simulations, we have considered several performance
metrics. The ﬁrst one reﬂects the performance of FUEs, which
is measured by served trafﬁc in DL. In this case, model with
mean generated trafﬁc of 8.8 Mb/s is implemented in the
simulations. The model is a combination of VoIP and FTP
models according to [18]. The served trafﬁc load (TLs) in
the performed simulation can be characterized as a difference
between the generated trafﬁc load (TLg) and lost trafﬁc load
(TLl) due to insufﬁcient available radio resources formulated
as
TLs = TLg − TLl.
(15)
The second performance metric expresses the performance
of the MUEs and it is measured by the transmission efﬁciency
Γ. As already mentioned in Section II, Γ represents the amount
of bits that could be sent through one RE. The Γ is derived
from SINR, which sets the suitable MCS for data transmission.
In our simulation, Γ is derived from SINR of the MUEs
according to [16]. Note that the highest MCS (64QAM, coding
4/5) enables to transmit 4.8 bits per one RE [b/RE].
The third performance metric in our simulation is the
sensing overhead (see (7)). The minimal value of Ts is set
to 0.2 s, i.e., 20 frames. This value is selected in accordance
with [9]. On the other hand, the maximal value of Ts is set to
10 s when sensing overhead is negligible, that is, 0.1%.
V.
RESULTS
The performance of our approach (in simulation labeled as
Hybrid Cognitive Approach, HCA) is compared to the QPC
scheme based on [7] and Cognitive Femtocell (CF) approach
based on [9]-[12]. The QPC represents the case when the
performance of the FUEs is maximized (in terms of served
trafﬁc) disregarding impact on the MUEs. On the other hand,
the CF corresponds to a scenario when the FAPs use only radio
resources not currently occupied by the MBS. Thus, the CF
offers the highest performance to the MUEs even if the QoS
of the FUEs could be worsened due to insufﬁcient amount of
radio resources at the side of the FAP. Note that in case of the
CF, the FAPs transmission power is set according to simple
auto-conﬁguration scheme based on [4].
Fig. 7 illustrates the performance of outdoor MUEs moving
along the sidewalk. The best results are achieved by the CF
scheme, where performance is not negatively inﬂuenced by
the FAPs as the FAPs use different radio resources. Con-
sequently, the transmission efﬁciency is equal to 2.29 b/RE
disregarding the FAPs location or generated load. Note that
this value of Γ would be the same for the MUEs if no
FAPs were introduced, since perfect sensing is considered
and no interference is introduced to the MUEs. Further, it is
obvious that the FAPs utilizing the QPC scheme cause the most
signiﬁcant interference to the MUEs as the MUEs experience
DL transmission efﬁciency only in range between 1.02 to 2.07
b/RE. The situation is, in particular, unfavorable if the FAPs
are located close to house boundaries. The performance of the

HCA is only slightly lower than the performance of the CF in
case that the FAP is located between 4 m and 7 m from house
boundaries. But also for other cases the results are signiﬁcantly
better than the QPC.
Fig. 8 depicts the amount of served trafﬁc for the FUEs.
The highest amount of trafﬁc is served in case of the QPC.
This corresponds to the fact that the QPC tries, by all means, to
satisfy the FUEs in terms of QoS. Consequently, approximately
97% of all generated data are successfully transmitted to the
FUEs disregarding the FAPs position or generated load. On
the contrary, the CF scheme is able to serve the lowest ratio
of trafﬁc varying only between 75% and 82.5%. The HCA
scheme is able to ensure that up to 89% of generated trafﬁc
can be served indoor, which is substantially higher than in case
of the CF.
Fig. 9 shows the inﬂuence of the amount of radio resources
in SF band on trafﬁc served by the FAPs. The simulations
have been performed for all positions of the FAPs similarly
as in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 and subsequently the results were
averaged out for individual loads. The performance of the QPC

is the same as in Fig. 8, since it utilizes only PF band and
no SF bands are taken into account. On the other hand, the
CF performance is reliant only on the free radio resources in
the SF band. As a consequence, the CF is able to serve less
amount of trafﬁc than the QPC. In the extreme case if the
SF band is totally overloaded, no data can be transmitted by
the CF scheme. On the other hand, the proposed HCA is not
fully dependent on the utilization of SF bands by their users.
Consequently, if no SF bands are available, still 65% can be
served.
Fig. 10 presents sensing overhead generated by individual
schemes. The highest sensing overhead is caused by the CF
where ﬁxed Ts is considered. In this case, 5% of FAP radio
resources is required for the sensing. On the contrary, no
sensing overhead is produced by the QPC since this scheme
does not perform sensing at all. Regarding the HCA, the
sensing overhead could be decreased approximately to 3.5%.

DISCUSSION
The comparison of individual methods, when the results are
averaged out over all FAPs location, is summarized in Table
II. Regarding served trafﬁc for the FUEs, the performance
is the highest for the QPC, which serves 97.31% of trafﬁc.
Nevertheless, the main weakness of the QPC is its high
interference to the MUEs as transmission efﬁciency is only
1.55 b/RE. Thus, applicability of the QPC is not feasible.
When the performance of MUEs is the main objective,
the best results are achieved by the CF as the transmission
efﬁciency is the highest (2.29 b/RE). On the other hand, the
CF notably decreases performance of FUEs (only 80.05% is
served), which is also not desirable, since the main purpose
of the FAP is to enable high indoor data transmission. This
problem can be further emphasized if the CF has not enough
radio resources at SF. In this case, the CF fails and it is not
able to serve FUEs at all (Fig. 9).
Based on above mentioned, the QPC is not suitable for
the MUEs, whilst the CF is not sufﬁcient from the FUEs
point of view. The performed simulations indicate that the
HCA is a convenient compromise between the QPC and the
CF schemes. When compared to the CF, the transmission
efﬁciency of MUEs is decreased only negligibly (2.16 b/RE).
At the same time, the HCA ensures better performance for
FUEs in comparison to the CF (88.61%). Also the sensing
overhead is decreased in case of the HCA if compared to the
CF.
As already suggested in Section 3A, the performance of
the HCA can be further improved by optimization of several
parameters such as ∆t, ∆P and δ. The setting of individual
parameters should be varying in dependence on the position
of the FAPs. This way, the performance of the HCA in terms
of transmission efﬁciency of the MUEs can be signiﬁcantly
improved to close the gap between the CF and the HCA. Sim-
ilarly, the performance of the FUEs can be improved in terms
of the FUEs served trafﬁc to minimize a difference between
the HCA and the QPC. The setting of optimal parameters is
left to future research due to paper length limitation.

CONCLUSION
paper has proposed a new hybrid cognitive approach where
the FAPs can use both primary and secondary frequencies.
Low interference to the MUEs is achieved by proposed power
control algorithm. In addition, the minimization of sensing
overhead is accomplished by algorithm that adaptively changes
sensing period.
The results have been compared with two other competitive
schemes. In overall, a disadvantage of the QPC is that the
interference to the MUEs is signiﬁcant while the CF degrades
the performance of the FUEs, especially if the SF bands are
heavily loaded. To that end, the proposed scheme offers a good
TABLE II.

trade-off between the MUEs and the FUEs performance. The
results accomplished by the HCA can be further improved by
optimization of power control parameters, such as adaptation
interval, power adaptation step and fading margin. The opti-
mization itself will be done in our future work.
