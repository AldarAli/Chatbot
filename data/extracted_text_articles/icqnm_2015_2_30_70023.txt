Abstract  — The 
long 
induction 
period 
of 
degradation 
proceeding without a noticeable mass loss was found in the 
recent experiments on highly cross-linked photopolymerized 
polyanhydrides. In order to model the observed phenomenon, 
we describe the kinetics of several processes such as the intake 
of water followed by the hydrolytic degradation of the cross-
linked polyanhydride matrix. We survey the model and 
experimental data fitting, which suggest that the long induction 
interval is caused by the nonlinear dependence of the 
degradation rates on the local water concentration in the 
material, suggesting a breakdown of the standard rate-
equation approach. 
Keywords — Biomaterials; cross-linked polyanhydrides;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
A better understanding of the mechanisms and processes 
of degradation and erosion of various polymeric biomaterials 
[1]-[16] can be achieved by means of modeling. Here we 
review recent work on numerical modelling of cross-linked 
polyanhydrides [1], a specific biodegradable polymer 
material that has beneficial chemical and physical properties 
utilized in applications, because of its undergoing 
degradation and erosion in aqueous environments [2]-[5]. In 
a recently developed modeling approach [1], we aimed at 
explaining an important property found in the experiments 
[17][18]: a long induction interval of water intake prior to the 
noticeable erosion (mass loss) in highly cross-linked 
polyanhydrides produced via thiol-ene photopolymerization. 
This property might allow additional control in medical 
applications, such as drug release [19][20]. Utilizing a new 
theoretical model, we conclude that the observed long 
induction interval can be explained by a kinetic effect of the 
breakdown of the rate-equation approach, typically used for 
reaction-diffusion systems. 
Specifically for medical applications [5][21]-[24], 
predictable degradation of biodegradable polymer materials 
is crucial for drug delivery capsules. Furthermore, 
biocompatibility is important for orthopedic applications. 
Some polyanhydrides actually have compressive strengths 
similar to the human cortical bone [24][25]. In addition to 
predictable degradation and biocompatibility, polymer 
implants can help avoid multiple surgeries and incorporate 
healing drugs [22] for long-term delivery during the implant 
degradation and erosion. Other benefits include making 
stress shielding unnecessary and absence of corrosion 
processes [22]. Furthermore, such materials could facilitate 
in tissue engineering [5] and development of new bio-
adhesives [23]. 
In the experiments [17] that preceded the modeling work 
reported here, the authors investigated several aspects of the 
degradation kinetics of polyanhydrides synthetized by thiol-
ene photopolymerization. They experimentally measured and 
reported several quantities including the time-dependent 
mass of the surviving eroding cross-linked polyanhydride 
sample, release rate of a chosen drug-mimicking substance (a 
hydrophilic dye) in an aqueous environment, and rate of 
anhydride bond breakage by hydrolysis. Other quantities that 
might have affected the process kinetics included the pH-
dependent degradation product solubility, and the average 
pKa of that product. The hydrolysis-involving experiment 
leading to the polymer matrix swelling and connectivity 
reduction was carried out at 37° C in phosphate buffered 
saline (PBS) solution at pH 7.4. A substantial induction 
period of water intake, about 10 h, before the onset of the 
noticeable erosion was observed in these experiments, unlike 
the earlier degradation experiments [4][9][13][22][26]-[29] 
done for linear polymers only, where typically no indications 
of 
such 
a 
property 
were 
reported, 
for 
which 
phenomenological modeling was reported [12]. 
In the experiments of interest [17], as the sample takes up 
the water and the anhydride bonds are subjected to 
hydrolysis, the connectivity of the polymer network is 
reduced. Consequently, low molecular weight degradation 
products and possibly small pieces are released into the 
solution. We focused on explaining the cause of the 
experimentally observed [17] induction interval preceding 
substantial mass loss of the degrading sample [1]. The

aforementioned effect is illustrated on Figure 1, top panel, 
where the experimental data [17] and the model fit curves [1] 
are combined. The details of the system and of the modeling 
approach can be found in [1]; they are surveyed here.

whereas the dashed line is the polymer-fraction mass in the

For the recently developed and studied highly cross-
linked amorphous polyanhydrides [17][18][31][32], the 
existing modeling work [6]-[16][30] on bulk and surface 
eroding polymers is not applicable as it does not provide an 
explanation of the long induction interval, comparable to the 
overall erosion timescale. Figure 1 illustrates the primary 
modeling results of our new modeling approach [1], 
reviewed here. The objectives of the modeling were to 
explore the kinetic mechanisms of the relevant processes and 
influence of various system parameters. We concluded that 
the long induction interval of water intake without 
measurable erosion can be attributed to an effect of the rate-
equation description breakdown due to altered water 
reactivity.  
We note that the polymer materials examined in [17] are 
amorphous. Most of the previous modeling and experimental 
work was done on semi-crystalline polyanhydrides. For the 
latter, the presence of two phases adds complexity to the 
erosion, as the amorphous and crystalline phases can exhibit 
different degradation behaviors [8]. 
 
  
 
 
Fig. 2. The scheme shows PNA and PETMP molecules (top 
section) used in synthesizing polyanhydrides. In the cross-linked 
structure (middle section) the dashed-line boxes mark the 
anhydride functional groups, which degrade by hydrolysis, 
resulting  in the polymer breakup into small units (bottom section).  
  
For linear non-cross-linked polymers used in previous 
works, polymer molecular weight was a determining factor 
in the erosion process. Polyanhydrides explored here have 
highly cross-linked structure in addition to being amorphous. 
These polyanhydrides were synthesized [17] through the 
thiol-ene photopolymerization of pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-
mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) and 4-pentenoic anhydride 
(PNA); see Figure 2. This type of polymerization, termed a 
radical-mediated thiol-ene reaction, is often referred to as 
“click” chemistry, meaning it is highly efficient and easy to 
perform [33]-[35]. For the system considered here, reaction

of the PETMP (1 mole equivalent) and the PNA (2 mole 
equivalent), yields the highly cross-linked network structure 
shown in Figure 2. The PNA monomer contains the 
anhydride functionality that readily undergoes hydrolysis, 
thus these highly cross-linked polymers degrade in aqueous 
environments. The polymers were synthesized by combining 
0.27 ml PETMP, 0.26 ml PNA, and 0.6 mg photoinitiator (1-
hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone) in a silicone mold (10 × 
10 × 2 mm) and irradiating with UV light for 15 minutes.  
The samples were subsequently degraded in 100 mL of 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution at 37° C and pH 
7.4. Mass of the sample was measured every hour after 
removing it from the solution and wiping off the excess of 
the solution and loose (not cross-linked) layer. After each 
measurement, the PBS solution was renewed to maintain pH 
7.4. In the rest of this survey, in Section II we describe the 
modeling approach. Section III offers a concluding 
discussion. 
 
 
II. 
THE MODELING APPROACH 
The degradation and erosion processes are controlled by 
many parameters. The breakup of the polyanhydride bonds 
by hydrolysis is typically described using rate equations that 
introduce rate constants. For the process of erosion we 
considered diffusion of water into the structure and 
diffusion of the detached small degradation products within 
and out of the polymer matrix. Kinetic parameters might be 
pH-dependent, 
specifically, 
the 
rate 
of 
hydrolysis 
[9][11][26][28][36][37] and solubility of the degradation 
products [10][13][27].  
The buffer diffusion into the sample may also need to be 
included into the model. We introduced additional 
parameters for the receding sample boundary, at which 
variation of buffer, degradation products and water 
concentration occurs as the sample degrades. The swelling 
of the outer layer of the polymer sample [17] was also 
considered [1], yielding more parameters for modeling. 
The details of the model are described in [1]. Here, we 
survey the findings. Consider the standard rate equations, 
used in earlier modeling [6][7][12][30][38] for the 
degradation of the polymer matrix, here in a shape of a 
narrow slab as in the experiment [17], with x measured from 
the middle (and t representing time),

Here we have several adjustable parameters, including the 
rate constants ݇௜ୀଵ,ଶ,ଷ,ସ, molar concentrations ݑ௜ୀ଴,ଵ,ଶ,ଷ,ସ of 
the 4-, 3-, 2-, 1-(cross-)linked (within the network) units, as 
well as 0-linked disconnected small diffusing units. These 0-
linked units are assumed to diffuse with the average 
diffusion constant ܦ଴. The water (with molar concentration 
ݑ୵) diffuses into the matrix with diffusion constant ܦ୵. The 
reaction terms ݇௜ݑ௜ݑ୵, ݅ ൌ 1,2,3,4 , in the rate equations 
quantify the hydrolytic break up of the network. 
The sample boundary was defined at ݔ ൌ ܺ୆ሺݐሻ, such 
that the total amount of the cross-linked material at this x 
value dropped to some reference fraction, g (the parameter

Several modifications of the above description are required 
for ݔ൐ܺ୆ሺݐሻ where some quantities undergo qualitative 
changes in properties at the boundary.  
The set of equations (1) involves 7 parameters, and only 
some of them can be found in the literature at least 
approximately, e.g., ܦ୵  in such a polymeric material 
environment [6][39]-[42]. Other parameters can be only 
estimated, rather than obtained precisely from data fitting 
because of the noise in the experimental data, or possibly 
the model not fitting the considered data. Thus, we are left 
with several rate constants, etc., including some of the 
parameters defined at the boundary and outside the sample 
(described in [1]), and even more quantities that can be 
fitted in relation to the observed swelling, which we also 
modeled, see [1] where all the relevant parameter values are 
given. The available experimental data has only two well-
defined time scales as the key measurable properties to fit 
(see Figure 1). One is the induction time, the other is 
the erosion time scale measured by the rate of erosion in the 
approximately linear decay regime. 
These two time scales could not be reproduced, as 
discussed in [1], even when involving numerous adjustable 
parameters. The standard rate-equation model that included 
(1), with various boundary considerations and with the 
inclusion of swelling into the model, etc., was insufficient to 
fit the experiments data.  
Figure 3, top panel, demonstrates how for different 
values of the rate constants, ݇௜ୀଵ,ଶ,ଷ,ସ, no substantial delay 
time (the induction region) can be produced, cf. Figure 1. 
By changing some of the parameters (rate constants), the 
time scale of the fast erosion region can be adjusted, but the 
duration of the delay remains small, see Figure 3, bottom 
panel. Furthermore, there is a “bottleneck” effect, also 
exemplified in Figure 3, in that only a single rate constant is 
the rate-limiting one. This generally leaves much less 
freedom in the parameter determination by data fitting than 
one would expect from the large number of the introduced 
model parameters, which is actually typical for models of 
such chemical kinetics.

Fig. 3. Top panel: relative mass of the cross-linked polyanhydride 
sample as a function of time in the standard-rate-equation model. 
The solid red line was produced with all the rate constants, ݇௜, 
doubled as compared to the black line. The green line was obtained 
by instead halving all the rate constants together. The bottleneck 
effect is illustrated as follows: The dashed red line represents the 
case when only ݇ଶ is doubled. The dashed green line is for the case 
when ݇ଵ,ଶ are halved. Bottom panel: the initial fast variation time 
scale is magnified. The parameter values are given in [1]. 
 
 
 
The overall finding is that the standard rate equation 
model is not suitable to explain the experimentally observed 
large induction period. We mention again that several other 
experiments, which involved less cross-linked networks did 
not report the long induction time preceding erosion 
[4][9][13][22][26][27][29][37], however in some of them 
the delay stage can be observed [7][9][17][18][43]-[45]. For 
different model modifications, the rate constants in (1) were 
found [1] to be the basic rate-determining parameters. These 
equations were common to the different model variations 
considered. Therefore, the validity of the rate equations (1) 
should be questioned, and we found that the concentration-
of-water dependence is the reason. The model, even in its 
simplified variant provides a good fit of the data if each of 
the reaction terms in (1) is modified according to

that phenomenologically describes the deviation of the 
original ݑ୵-dependence of the reaction rates from linear, 
here saturating as a finite value, ݑஶ, for large ݑ୵ሺ≫ݑஶሻ. 
Only such a model modification yielded the curves in 
Figure 1, where the new parameter, ݑஶ , controls the 
induction time. We also noted that the shape and sharpness 
of the transition region from induction to fast erosion, see 
Figure 1, bottom panel, are mostly controlled by the 
assumed initial degree of cross-linking near the sample 
boundary and the diffusion constant, ܦ଴, for detached 
0-connected units. However, the given data are too noisy for 
the precise fitting of this diffusion constant. Additionally, 
the model-predicted sharp drop-off region at the end of the 
erosion time, see Figure 1, bottom panel, is difficult to 
measure experimentally as the sample integrity is mostly 
compromised when its remaining mass is below ~20%. 
 
III. 
CONCLUSION 
We found evidence that the induction delay time 
correlates with the water reactivity in hydrolysis in the 
considered system. One possible explanation of this 
property is that the dense amorphous network prevents fast 
enough local water equilibration by diffusion as the water 
concentration increases. The local reaction rates are then 
effectively slowed down. However, assuming a standard 
water diffusion mechanism in the amorphous polymer 
matrix, statistical-mechanics considerations [46][47] make 
this explanation questionable. 
An alternative explanation could be that a dense cross-
linked polymer network prevents resupply of buffer by 
diffusion from outside the sample, and the reaction rates are 
lowered due to local pH changes. Another possible 
explanation of the observed decrease in water reactivity is 
due to a completely different effect: During the erosion and 
continuous water intake, some of it will be entrapped in 
small crevices and only part of that water will be surface-
reacting with the surrounding network, causing further 
anhydride bonds breakup. Such explanation for surface-only 
reactivity has been noted in a different context [10][13].  
These possibilities cannot be sorted out by modeling 
alone, and they pose a challenge for experimental studies to 
yield microscopic, rather than the presently available
