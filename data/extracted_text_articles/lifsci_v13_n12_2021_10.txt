Abstract— More than 50 million adults living in the United 
States suffer from disordered sleep. Yet few safe, effective, 
drug-free interventions are available. In this 30-day open-
label home study, participants (n=25) reporting poor sleep 
were recruited to test a novel wearable mechanical 
stimulation device. The device is designed to modulate the 
interoceptive network by producing gentle, slow mechanical 
stimulation. After using the device each night before bed for 
30 days, significant improvements in sleep quality were 
reported. Additionally, participants reported improvements 
across multiple dimensions of interoception as measured by 
the 
Multidimensional 
Assessment 
for 
Interoceptive 
Awareness. On average, participants (n=22) reported a 43% 
improvement in the overall quality of their sleep, measured 
by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Participants (n=15) 
contacted 3 to 7 months after completing the study, 
maintained improvements in sleep quality and interoceptive 
regulation. 
These 
findings 
indicate 
that 
mechanical 
stimulation may offer an effective, safe, non-drug alternative 
to improving sleep via interoceptive regulation and suggest a 
novel approach to treatment. [1]

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The term ‘interoception,’ coined in 1906, initially 
described the total afferent input of the viscera to the brain 
[2]. The concept was mostly dormant until decades later 
when it evolved and expanded to include all afferent 
signaling to the central nervous system [3]. Most responses 
to interoceptive signals are understood to be autonomic, 
rarely rising to the level of consciousness (e.g., retracting a 
hand back when touching something hot), while others 
only indirectly reach awareness (e.g., filtration action of 
the kidneys only requires a response to the urge to void) 
[4]. Interoceptive signals such as those associated with 
emotion, can be mistakenly regarded as instinctual or 
autonomic; however, they are generally learned habits that 
remain malleable [5][6].  
Methods to assess interoceptive capacity in individuals 
(e.g., heart rate detection tasks) have been developed, as 
well as self-report measures to assess various aspects of 
interoception [7][8][9]. Lower interoceptive awareness 
(i.e., lack of response to interoceptive signals) and 
dysregulated interoception (i.e., misinterpretation of the 
interoceptive signals) are associated with impaired 
decision making, poor sleep quality, increased psychiatric 
disorders, and reduced empathy [10] [11]. With that 
considered, dysregulated interoception is often recognized 
as a common feature of many affective and somatic 
disorder and their symptoms, prompting researchers to 
investigate neural bases of interoception [12]. Studies have 
shown that areas in the brain such as the anterior insula (IA) 
and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which are essential 
for processing emotion, affect, and behavior, are also 
proving to be fundamental in interoceptive processing 
[17][18]. Multiple studies suggest that modulating activity 
in these areas through practices such as mindfulness and 
meditation, appear to improve interoception [19][20][21]. 
Similarly, the same practices reduce symptomology among 
many affective and somatic disorders [22][23][24].  
Disciplines of the mind and/or body, such as 
meditation, or yoga, or physical exercise, can improve 
interoceptive regulation because these activities stimulate 
the same areas of the brain as those dedicated to specific 
inputs from the periphery [12][13][15][22]. That specific 
interoceptive network is comprised of C-tactile afferent 
(CTAs) nerves [25]. CTAs are dermal mechanoreceptors, 
found only in hairy skin of mammals. They respond to a 
narrow range of slow, light touch stimuli, such as the kind 
of touch seen between a parent and child, the comforting 
caress of a partner, the grooming of baboons, and similar 
social behaviors [26]. This type of touch, called affective 
touch, also modulates areas of the brain involved in 
interoception, 
emotional 
regulation, 
and 
related 
functioning [27][28]. In turn, affective touch is associated 
with reduced stress, increased relaxation, a sense of 
belonging, and increased empathy [29][30][31].  
1) 
Interoception and Sleep 
Interoceptive signals such as those relating to 
temperature or pain, have been found to significantly 
impact sleep. For example, there is strong evidence in 
support of the relationship between internal body 
temperature and sleep regulation, where studies have 
shown that environmental temperature can alter sleep 
regulation [11] [32]. Similarly, as interoception includes 
processing nociceptive information, the present literature 
reveals a strong relationship between pain and sleep [11] 
[33]. Evidence of the relationship between pain and sleep 
is often observed in clinical populations such as chronic 

93

pain patients, where one study found that 53% of chronic 
pain patients reported also suffering from insomnia as well, 
compared to only 3% of the healthy population [34]. As 
discussed earlier, dysregulated interoceptive processing 
can produce a wide range of symptoms, often overlapping 
in different clinical populations, which may explain the 
relationship seen among disorders of sleep and chronic 
pain, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
disorders 
of 
affect 
[5][10][35][36][37].  
Neuroscience research, both electroencephalogram 
(EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
research, has provided evidence that cortical regions play a 
role in particular aspects of sleep, help regulate sleep-wake 
patterns, and are similar to those prominent in regulating 
the interoceptive system of interest here [38]. The ACC, a 
brain region found to stimulate wakefulness, AI, and 
orbitofrontal cortex have all been studied for their roles in 
insomnia disorder, a highly prevalent sleep disorder 
associated with impaired functioning during waking hours 
[38][39][40][41]. For instance, functional neuroimaging 
studies have found that those with insomnia have an 
increased insula coactivation with cortical networks 
associated with salience and arousal, such as the ACC, 
when compared to healthy controls [38][42]. Interestingly, 
these same brain regions are also recognized for their 
involvement in interoceptive processing and affect [10]. 
Insomnia disorder has also been associated with 
heightened interoceptive awareness, see [11] for review. 
When 
interoception 
is 
dysregulated, 
heightened 
interoceptive awareness may lead to a hyperawareness of 
physiological states that becomes disruptive to sleep, 
especially when falling asleep or staying asleep, as 
discussed earlier.  
The relationship between interoception and sleep 
quality has been observed in a study investigating the 
relationship between components of subjective sleep 
quality, measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
(PSQI), and dimensions of interoception, measured by the 
Multidimensional 
Assessment 
for 
Interoceptive 
Awareness (MAIA-II) [43]. In that sample of young adults 
(n=545), ages 18 to 25 years old, 90% were considerably 
poor sleepers, measured by Global PSQI scores., Poor 
sleep quality, was found to be significantly negatively 
correlated with dimensions of interoception including non-
distracting and trusting, with the strong effect sizes [43]. 
These results suggest that those who experience better 
quality sleep may be more adept at recognizing sensations 
such as pain and discomfort, and more trusting of the 
internal 
bodily 
information 
regarding 
various 
physiological states, which is consistent with previous 
work investigating sleep and pain tolerance, as well as 
subjective hunger [43]. Overall, these findings provide 
evidence that there is a relationship between perceivably 
improved sleep and improved interoception. Therefore, 
considering the overlap of brain regions and cortical 
networks involved in both interoceptive processing and 
sleep, as well as the relationship between interoception, 
disordered sleep, and subjective sleep quality, one may 
argue that interoceptive processes are salient to at least 
some sleep disturbances. 
2) 
Impact of Disordered Sleep 
Disordered sleep, including insomnia, obstructive sleep 
apnea, and hypersomnia, impacts between 50 and 70 
million Americans each year and an estimated 83.6 million 
U.S. adults get below the recommended 7 hours of sleep 
per night [44][45]. Roughly 15% of the U.S. population 
report insomnia related symptoms, and a quarter of the 
population are dissatisfied with their sleep. One study 
found that one in five adult females in Australia experience 
chronic insomnia, and one in seven experience obstructive 
sleep apnea [46]. 
The prevalence of disordered sleep can have a profound 
impact on both societal and individual levels. For example, 
insufficient and low-quality sleep decreases workplace 
productivity, increases the risk of motor vehicle accidents, 
and elevates the number of risk-factors for health 
outcomes. Poor-quality sleep and sleep deprivation have 
also been linked to metabolic dysfunction, cognitive 
impairment, alterations in neuroendocrine function and 
affective dysregulation [47][48]. Additionally, disordered 
sleep has been linked to a reduced quality of life and 
increases in anxiety related disorders [49]. 
In the primary care setting, patients complaining of 
sleep dysfunction have become a common occurrence and 
many people around the country have turned to available 
treatments. The most common agents of treatment include 
prescription 
drugs, 
such 
as 
benzodiazepines 
and 
antidepressants, and over the counter options, such as 
antihistamines and melatonin [50]. Between 1998 and 2006 
the number of Americans reliant on sleep aid prescriptions 
tripled and roughly 4% of the adult population reported use 
of a prescription sleep aid [44]. A review of 35 studies 
relating to the effectiveness of melatonin found that most 
of the studies were inconclusive and melatonin was rarely 
superior to placebo [51]. Several of the reviewed studies 
gave weak recommendations for the use of melatonin 
among healthy volunteers or those with a history of 
insomnia due to melatonin’s lack of effectiveness in 
initiating sleep or improving the quality of sleep [51]. 
Prescription drug such as. benzodiazepines leave users 
with a “hungover” feeling and often result in daytime 
drowsiness, impaired memory, difficulty concentrating, 
lack of coordination, amnesia, dizziness, and many other 
side effects that impact day-to-day activities [52]. Other 
prescription options, such as antidepressants, can lead to 
increases in suicidal ideation and mania [49]. The lack of 
reliable treatment options suggests a need for an alternative 
approach to a significant public health issue. 
Considering the apparent relationship between sleep 
and interoception, as well as the research showing how 
practices that improve interoception (e.g., mindfulness, 

94

yoga, and extreme sports/intense exercise), can also 
improve affective and somatic symptomology, we 
hypothesized that improving interoception will also 
improve sleep [22][23][24][53]. To do so, we developed a 
mechanical stimulation technology targeting CTAs (low 
intensity and low frequency (~5-15Hz) stimulation) [54]. 
This technology offers a non-invasive means of activating 
the affective touch pathway by targeting specific 
mechanoreceptors in the skin, and in turn, modulating 
interoceptive processing [1]. The objective of this research 
was to assess the effects, if any, of a device designed to 
improve interoceptive regulation via CTAs on symptoms 
of sleep disorder measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (PSQI) [55]. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 
II details the nature of our novel approach to improve sleep 
through regulating interoception. Section III outlines the 
study method, including a description of the participant 
sample and eligibility criteria, the device technology, and 
measures used to assess sleep quality and interoceptive 
characteristics. Section IV details all study procedures, 
including a statement of ethics, participant eligibility 
screening, 
participant 
responsibilities, 
and 
visit 
procedures. Section V contains the detailed results of the 
present study and Section VI closes out the paper with the 
conclusion and a discussion of future work.  
II. STATE OF THE ART 
Most sleep interventions, aside from known drug or 
comorbid causes, treat sleep as a primary disorder. Our 
interest, as in other work, is to approach sleep disturbances 
as a manifestation of dysregulated interoception and others 
have done preliminary work looking at that pathway [32] 
[43] [56]. While some interventions for sleep, such as 
mindfulness, are also known to improve interoceptive 
regulation [53], few interventions appear to make the 
explicit connection, with at least one exception [57]. More 
specifically, no study, to our knowledge, explicitly 
approaches 
sleep 
as 
a 
function 
of 
dysregulated 
interoception and further, none use mechanical stimulation 
of the affective touch pathway to improve interoceptive 
regulation. 
III. STUDY METHOD 
This section details the overall method for the 30-day 
study, including the recruitment of qualifying participants 
and exclusion criteria, description of our novel mechanical 
stimulation device, and the measures used to assess sleep 
quality and characteristics of interoception. 
A. 
Participants 
Participants for this trial included healthy adults (mean 
age=34) with self-reported poor sleep. The subject 
population included a distribution of female (n=13) and 
male (n=9) participants. Poor sleep was measured using the 
PSQI (Global Score >10) [55].  
Exclusion criteria included the use of sleep 
medication, current psychiatric disorder, a skin condition 
that may be exacerbated with device use, a metal implant 
in the head/neck region and finally if participants were 
pregnant or breastfeeding. These exclusion criteria aimed 
to control for any comorbid psychopathology and for any 
variance arising from interactions with other drugs.  
B. 
Mechanical Stimulation Device 
A simple headband with small piezoelectric actuators 
at the distal ends, seen in Figure 1 (a), was developed to 
deliver short bursts of very low intensity, low frequency 
mechanical stimulation, targeting CTAs associated with 
the affective touch pathway. The actuators were positioned 
behind the ears, on the mastoid, for convenience. The 
specific wave form was derived from a combination of 
empirical study (changes in alpha power pre/post 
stimulation in in-lab studies over 2 years) and known 
response characteristics of the CTA mechanoreceptors 
(low intensity, low frequency ~10 Hz). 
C. 
Measures 
The subsections below describe the measures used to 
assess sleep, including both behavioral and subjective 
measures, as well a subjective measure to assess various 
aspects of interoception. 
1) 
Behavioral Sleep  
A daily sleep diary with a 1- item sleep rating scale was 
used to track 
sleep quality throughout 
subject’s 
participation in the study.  
A Garmin Vivosmart 4 (https://buy.garmin.com/en-
US/US/p/605739) watch was used to measure sleep 
duration during the study. The Garmin watch uses a wrist-
based Pulse Ox sensor to measure sleep activity. Although 
the watch reports detailed sleep stages as well, that was 
excluded from this study due to the lack of reliability in 
those assessments [58][unpublished internal testing].  
2) 
Subjective Sleep 
Changes in sleep quality were assessed via PSQI and a 
1-Item Sleep Quality Rating Scale. The Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-report measure assessing 
sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month timeframe. 
It is an 18-item questionnaire with seven component scores 
(range 0–3) that result in a global sleep quality score (range 
0–21). Scores of five or greater indicate a probable sleep 
disorder [55]. The seven component measures include 
subjective sleep quality (PSQI_C1), sleep latency 
(PSQI_C2), sleep duration (PSQI_C3), habitual sleep 
efficiency (PSQI_C4), sleep disturbances (PSQI_C5), use 
of sleep medication (PSQI_C6) and daytime drowsiness 
(PSQI_C7).  
The 1-Item Sleep Quality Rating Scale is a self-report 
measure utilizing a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents little 
to no sleep at all, and 5 represents great sleep (no problems 
falling or staying asleep).

An exit interview was conducted by a study coordinator 
at the end of the study to assess the usability of the device. 
3) 
Affective/Interoception Characteristics 
The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive 
Accuracy (MAIA) is a 32-item self-reported measure of 
interoception (scale of 0 Never – 5 Always) that tracks 
changes 
in 
interoceptive 
awareness 
across 
eight 
dimensions [7]. The eight dimensions are Noticing 
(MAIA_MN), 
Not-Distracting 
(MAIA_MND), 
Not-
Worrying 
(MAIA_MNW), 
Attention 
Regulation 
(MAIA_MAR), Emotional Awareness (MAIA_MER), 
Self-Regulation 
(MAIA_MSR), 
Body 
Listening 
(MAIA_MBL), and Trust (MAIA_MT). 
IV. STUDY PROCEDURE 
Subjects were enrolled in the sleep protocol for 30 days 
and instructed to use the device at home at least once a day, 
within one hour of their regular bedtime. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all participants. During 
enrollment, 
subjects 
were 
provided 
with 
device 
instructions, device calibration and their first stimulation 
session. A subset of participants (n=13) wore a wrist device 
to track sleep (Garmin VivoSmart 4). Subjects were 
compensated up to $300 at the end of the study in the form 
of a gift card. Refer to Figure 1 (b) below for a visualization 
of the 30-day study protocol. All study procedures were 
reviewed 
and 
approved 
by 
Solutions 
IRB 
(#: 
FWA00021831) [59].  
A. 
Screening 
Participants were recruited for the study via digital ads 
on Facebook, as well as flyers posted around the 
community. Interested subjects were then screened for the 
use of sleep medication, and participants that did not use 
any sleep medication were then invited to fill out an 
application via Google Forms. All applications were 
reviewed and those subjects meeting the inclusion criteria 
(n=39) were invited to schedule their enrollment 
appointments, of whom 25 participants (14 females, 11 
males) were enrolled into the study, displayed in Figure 2. 
B. 
Study Visits 
Eligible participants were enrolled via a written 
informed consent in the lab. They completed a set of 
baseline questionnaires, which included demographic 
information, subjective sleep measures and interoception 
measures. Upon completion of these assessments, all 
participants were instructed on device use and went 
through calibration to find the lowest level at which they 
could perceive the stimulation. Participants then had their 
first 20-minute stimulation session in the lab to ensure 
proper training and use of the device. Participants in the 
cohort with the Garmin sleep tracker were given additional 
instruction. 
Participants returned to the lab after 30 days of home 
use for the final assessment of sleep and interoception 
measures and an exit interview was conducted with a study 
coordinator to discuss usability of the device.

C. 
Protocol 
All participants were instructed to use the stimulation 
device for 30 days at home within one hour of their regular 
bedtime. Participants received a text message each 
morning with a link to fill in their daily sleep diary via 
Google Forms. Participants in the Garmin tracker cohort 
were asked to wear the Garmin watch each day and night 
during the 30-day study, and data from the watch was 
collected at the end of the study. 
D. 
Analysis 
     Data analysis was performed on MATLAB and 
Microsoft Excel. Due to the small sample size of the study, 
t tests were conducted, and p values (with a 95% 
confidence interval) are reported as outcome measures in 
the following section.  
V. RESULTS 
This section outlines the detailed results of the 30-day 
study, including descriptive characteristics of the 
participant sample, observed changes in sleep quality via 
self-report measures and a wearable sleep tracking device, 
as well as changes in aspects of interoception. 
A. 
Descriptive Characteristics of Participants 
In the sample of 25 participants, 3 were excluded from 
the primary analysis due to lack of compliance with the 30-
day study protocol (i.e., device usage, completing the 
study). More specifically, those that used the device less 
than 33% of the time (based on usage 1x/day for 30 days) 
were considered noncompliant and removed from analysis. 
The results discussed in this section will be reported as 
mean ± standard deviation. The characteristics of the 
sample of compliant participants (n=22) are displayed in 
Table 1. In short, the sample (n=22) included 13 females 
and 9 males with ages ranging from 24 to 60 years old 
(34.27 ± 9.64). 
B. 
Sleep Characteristics 
After using the MDS device before bed for 30 days, 
86% 
of 
participants (n=22) reported 
an 
overall 
improvement in sleep, measured by Global PSQI scores 
seen in Figure 3 (a), where lower scores indicate 
improvement in symptoms. Global PSQI scores improved 
significantly by 43% on average (Pre: 9.77 ± 3.04, Post: 
5.18 ± 2.58, p=0.00), displayed in Table 2. In terms of 
individual characteristics of sleep measured by the PSQI 
(PSQI component scores), we observed significant 
improvements in Subjective Sleep Quality (p=0.00), Sleep 
Latency (p=0.00), Sleep Disturbances (p=0.04), and 
Daytime Drowsiness (p=0.00), shown in Table 2. On 
average, Subjective Sleep Quality improved by 67% (Pre: 
2.0 ± 0.53, Post: 0.64 ± 0.58), Sleep Latency improved by 
51% (Pre: 1.32 ± 0.48, Post: 1.05 ± 0.38), Sleep 
Disturbances improved by 14% (Pre: 1.86 ± 0.89, Post: 
0.86 ± 0.64) and Daytime Drowsiness improved by 45% 
(Pre: 1.86 ± 0.89, Post: 0.86 ± 0.64), seen in Figure 3 (a). 
Similarly, we saw significant improvements in sleep 
quality ratings after 30 days of device use (p=0.00), 
displayed in Table 2. On average, sleep quality ratings 
increased by 45% (Pre: 3.09 ± 0.53, Post: 0.64 ± 0.58), 
shown in Figure 3 (b) (c), where higher scores indicate 
better sleep quality.  
Sleep hours were assessed via a commercial wrist 
Photoplethysmography (PPG) device (Garmin VivoSmart 
4) for a subset of compliant participants (n=13). This PPG 
device was chosen as it was most reliable for sleep time 
based on earlier studies, where we found that no devices to 
our knowledge appeared to accurately measure sleep 
stages, nor is PPG a suitable substitute for a hypnogram. 
After 30 days of using the MDS device, sleep hours 
increased by 65 minutes on average (Pre: 6.60 ± 0.29, Post: 
7.45 ± 0.45), shown in Figure 3 (d).

C. 
Affective/Interoception Characteristics 
After 30 days of using the MDS device, on average 
participants (n=22) reported an overall improvement in 
interoception, measured by the MAIA, displayed in Table 
2. Most notably, participants improved in the following 
dimensions of interoception: Noticing (Pre: 3.34 ± 0.79, 
Post: 3.8 ± 0.84), Not Worrying (Pre: 2.61 ± 1.45, Post: 
2.62 ± 1.16), Attention Regulation (Pre: 2.69 ± 0.91, Post: 
2.98 ± 0.96), Body Listening (Pre: 2.47 ± 1.07, Post: 3.02 
± 1.16), and Trusting (Pre: 3 ± 1.42, Post: 3.23 ± 1.04), 
shown in Figure 3 (e).  
D. 
Follow Up Results 
Approximately 3 to 7 months following the 30-day 
study, a subgroup of compliant participants (n=15) 
completed follow-up assessments. The follow-up sample 
(n=15) included 8 females and 7 males, with ages ranging 
from 24 to 44 years old (31.73 ± 5.71), shown in Table 3. 
Despite discontinued use of the MDS device for 3 to 7 
months, 
participants 
(n=15) 
maintained 
some 
improvements in sleep from their 30-day study 
participation. When compared to baseline scores, 
participants reported significant improvements in overall 
sleep quality (p=0.03), represented by Global PSQI scores 
displayed in Table 4. On average, Global PSQI scores at 
follow up improved by 26% when compared to baseline 
(Pre: 9.93 ± 3.15, Post: 5.4 ± 2.8, Follow Up: 7.07 ± 3.75), 
where lower scores represent improved sleep, displayed in 
Figure 4(a). Apart from Global PSQI scores, significant 
improvements were also found in Subjective Sleep Quality 
(p=0.04), and Sleep Duration (p=0.00) when comparing 
follow-up PSQI component scores to baseline, displayed in 
Table 4. On average, Subjective Sleep Quality improved 
by 22% (Pre: 2.07 ± 0.59, Post: 0.67 ± 0.62, Follow Up: 
1.53 ± 0.74) and Sleep Duration improved by 53% (Pre: 
1.27 ± 1.16, Post: 0.93 ± 1.03, Follow Up: 0.2± 0.41), and 
although not significant, Daytime Drowsiness improved by 
22% (Pre: 2.07 ± 0.88, Post: 0.87 ± 0.64, Follow Up: 1.47± 
1.13), shown in Figure 4(a). Similarly, on a scale of 1 to 
10, where higher scores indicate better sleep, sleep quality 
ratings did not return to baseline, shown in Table 4. On 
average, participants (n=15) reported an improvement in 
sleep by 12% at follow up when compared to baseline (Pre: 
3.07 ± 0.8, Post: 4.33 ± 0.62, Follow Up: 3.27± 0.96), 
displayed in Figure 4(b).  
Overall, the improvements reported in interoception 
following 30 days of MDS device use were maintained 
following cessation of the MDS device for 3 to 7 months, 
shown in Table 4. Most notably, participants (n=15) 
maintained an improvement in not distracting, attentional 
regulation, self-regulation, body listening, and trusting 
dimensions of interoception, measured by the MAIA. On 
average, participants reported a 28% improvement in Not 
Distracting (Pre: 2.36 ± 1.16, Post: 2.13 ± 1.19, Follow Up:

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
To our knowledge, this is the first human study to 
evaluate mechanical stimulation of the affective touch 
pathway in a sleep-disordered population. Although the 
trial is small, open-label, and used early prototypes, the 
results were significant, and participants benefited from the 
use of the MDS device [1]. Overall sleep quality, 
represented by Global PSQI scores, significantly improved 
after using the MDS device for 30 days. Participants 
reported falling asleep faster, experiencing fewer sleep 
disturbances, and experiencing less daytime drowsiness. 
Participants also reported an overall improvement in

aspects of interoception. These findings suggest that 
mechanical stimulation of CTAs can lead to improvements 
in sleep.  There is a need for further research to better 
understand the relationship between sleep, sleep disorders 
and interoception, and more robust clinical trials to assess 
the effects of mechanical stimulation on sleep and other 
symptoms of dysregulated interoception.  
A confirmatory Randomized Control Trial (RCT) is 
underway to address limitations such as sample size and 
inclusion of a control group, which will be completed in 
late 2021. 
An abundance of sleep research has provided evidence 
suggesting that impaired sleep has potentially serious 
implications on a wide variety of health conditions 
involving cardiovascular, immune, endocrine, and nervous 
systems [43]. Even in healthy populations, insufficient and 
disordered sleep can still have profound impacts on health. 
For example, in a sample of healthy adolescents, sleep 
deprivation was found to induce mood deficits [60]. These 
findings are supported by how the same brain structures 
recognized for their roles in interoception and regulating 
mood and emotion, such as the insula, have also shown 
evidence to be sensitive to sleep-dependent modulation 
[2][61] [62]. Clinically diagnosed sleep disorders, 
especially Insomnia Disorder, are commonly comorbid to 
other conditions like chronic pain, as well as affective 
disorders, all of which have been associated with 
dysregulated interoception [11]. The relationship between 
chronic pain and subjective sleep quality is well-
established, where those reporting poor sleep quality also 
report an increased level of pain, and vice-versa [11] [43] 
[63]. In a sample of patients with affective disorders, 
including anxiety and major depression, those who 
reported poor sleep quality via PSQI, performed worse on 
a measure of interoception (heart-rate discrimination task), 
representing a reduction in interoceptive accuracy when 
compared to healthy controls [56]. With consideration of 
the above research findings regarding the relationship 
between sleep and various health conditions, disorders, and 
physiological processing, it is worth investigating what 
may 
be 
the 
underlying 
connection: 
dysregulated 
interoception. 
In this pilot trial of sleep-disordered subjects, regular 
use of the mechanical dermal stimulation device appears to 
have produced significant improvements in sleep and 
related areas. What is of potential interest to others in the 
nascent field of affective touch therapeutics is that the 
proposed underlying mechanism of action is not 
particularly salient to sleep. The intervention is not 
designed to specifically and differentially affect sleep. The 
intent is to improve interoceptive regulation. In the course 
of our work, we have used other markers of interoception, 
like stress, fear, depression, and anxiety, as outcome 
measures.  In general, we find that improving interoceptive 
regulation 
in 
some 
domain 
is 
correlated 
with 
improvements in the specific feature of interest. 
It should be the case that improving interoceptive 
regulation would lead to improvements in function in 
multiple domains as interoception is a key driver of 
emotional responses. The current, dominant psychiatric 
and even lay nosology around distress has a variety of 
classifications based on symptoms and complaints. A 
nosology based on mechanisms of action, such as 
dysregulated interoception, collapse many of the older 
‘symptom-based’ nosology into that singular category. 
Although much of the therapeutic ‘infrastructure’ in 
psychiatry and psychology is rooted in the distinctiveness 
of disorders, practitioners recognize that, in the clinic, there 
is vast overlap among disorders and many comorbidities 
[10]. As we continue to work in developing therapeutic 
interventions around interoceptive regulation, we will 
continue to report using the existing symptom-based 
nosology, but always tie that back into the larger goal of 
improving interoceptive regulation. Future work that can 
help tie many currently disparate disorders (anxiety, eating 
disorders, sleep disturbances, etc.) to a common 
mechanism will help forge more common treatment 
methodologies and measures of improvement.
