Abstract—There are many situations where speech is affected 
by different kind of acoustic noise. We propose an improved 
spectral subtraction method for the reduction of colored 
acoustic noise added to the speech. Our implementation uses a 
multi-band spectral over subtraction method to reduce the 
colored noise. We use a non-linear Bark scale distribution to 
estimate the over-subtraction factor. The noise power spectral 
density is estimated, using a time-recursive algorithm, by 
tracking the minimum of the noisy speech spectrum in each 
frequency band. Simulations show a better quality in terms of 
Itakura Saito distance and perceptual evaluation of quality for 
the enhanced speech. Using the proposed speech enhancement 
method, a very good speech quality with less musical noise and 
with minimal speech distortion is obtained.

 INTRODUCTION  
The speech signal is often accompanied by the 
background noise of the environment. There are many 
negative effects when processing the degraded speech for 
some applications like: voice command systems, voice 
recognition, speaker authentication, hands-free systems. 
The main objective of speech enhancement is to improve 
the perceptual aspects of speech such as overall quality or 
intelligibility. Enhancement techniques can be classified as 
single channel and dual channel or multi channel 
enhancement techniques. Single channel enhancement 
techniques apply to situations in which only one acquisition 
channel is available. In multi channel enhancement 
techniques, a reference signal for the noise is available and 
hence adaptive noise cancellation technique can be applied. 
The spectral subtraction method is a well-known single 
channel noise reduction technique. The basic spectral 
subtraction technique proposed by Boll [2] apply subtraction 
of the noise spectrum estimate over the speech spectrum. 
The conventional power spectral subtraction method 
substantially reduces the noise levels in the noisy speech. 
However, it also introduces an annoying distortion in the 
speech signal called musical noise. Due to the inaccuracies in 
the short-time noise spectrum estimate, large spectral 
variations exist in the enhanced spectrum causing these 
distortions. 
Berouti [3] proposed an important variation of spectral 
subtraction for reduction of residual musical noise. The 
proposed method subtracts an overestimate of the noise 
power spectrum from the speech power spectrum. This 
operation minimizes the presence of residual noise by 
decreasing the spectral excursions in the enhanced spectrum. 
The over-subtraction factor provides a degree of control over 
the noise removal process between periods of noise update. 
A nonlinear approach to the subtraction procedure was 
proposed in recent studies [4], [5], [6], [7], which takes into 
account the variation of the signal-to-noise ratio across the 
entire speech spectrum. The real-world noise spectrum is not 
flat, therefore the noise signal does not affect the speech 
signal uniformly over the whole spectrum. Hence, it 
becomes imperative to estimate a suitable factor that will 
subtract just the necessary amount of the noise spectrum 
from each frequency sub-band, to prevent destructive 
subtraction of the speech while removing most of the 
residual noise. 
Noise spectrum estimation is also a challenging situation. 
Several noise-estimation algorithms have been proposed for 
speech enhancement applications. For rather stationary noise 
sources, the noise power spectral density (PSD) can be 
estimated by tracking the minimum of the noisy speech 
spectrum in each frequency band [8], [9]. However, in case 
of non-stationary noise sources, more advanced methods can 
be used [10]. 
In this paper we used a modified spectral over-
subtraction approach that allows better and more suppression 
of the noise. We propose to use the noise PSD estimation to 
compute the a posteriori SNR in each frequency subband. 
Then we calculate the corresponding over-subtraction factor 
and we apply the nonlinear multi-band spectral subtraction 
that reduces colored noise, using a different over-subtraction 
factor in each frequency band. 
This paper is organized as follows: a overview of the 
spectral subtraction methods is presented in Section II. 
Section III presents the human auditory system and the 
critical band and Bark scale model of speech analysis. 
Section IV describes the time-recursive averaging type of 
algorithms in which the noise spectrum is estimated in order 
to be used by the spectral subtraction method. Section V 
presents the improved multi-band spectral over-subtraction

method proposed to reduce the colored noise. Section VI

SPECTRAL SUBTRACTION METHODS  
A. Basic Spectral Subtraction Method 
The spectral subtraction method proposed by Boll [2] 
consists in obtaining an estimate of the noise-free signal 
spectrum by subtracting an estimate of the noise spectrum 
from the input noisy signal spectrum. The background noise 
is considered acoustically added to the speech. It is assumed 
that the background noise remains locally stationary to the 
degree that its spectral magnitude expected value prior to 
speech activity equals its expected value during speech 
activity. 
The noise is assumed to be uncorrelated and additive to 
the speech signal. An estimate of the noise signal is 
measured during silence or non-speech activity in the signal. 
We assume that the speech signal ( )
s n  has been degraded by 
the additive noise signal ( )

The phase

 of the input signal is used for 
reconstruction of the estimated signal spectrum based on the 
fact that for human perception the short time spectral 
magnitude is more important than the phase for intelligibility 
and quality. This conclusion was made by Lim and Wang in 
their work [11], when using the actual phase rather than the 
degraded speech phase does not improve the quality of the 
enhanced speech.

The time reconstructed speech signal is obtained taken

Since the noise spectrum cannot be directly obtained, 
there are some significant variations between the estimated 
noise spectrum and the actual noise content present in the 
instantaneous speech spectrum. This residual spectral content 
manifest themselves in the reconstructed time signal as 
varying tonal sounds resulting in a musical disturbance of an 
unnatural quality. This sounds like a musical noise and is the 
main drawback of the spectral subtraction method. 
B. Generalized Spectral Subtraction

proposed by Berouti [3]. The estimate of the enhanced 
speech is given by

A significant improvement to minimize the presence of 
residual noise and musical noise in the processed speech was 
proposed by Berouti et al. [3]. The average noise power 
spectrum is multiplied by the over-subtraction factor α and 
subtracted from the noisy speech spectrum in order to 
minimize the residual and musical noise:

This method improves the noise suppression better than 
basic spectral subtraction technique and also eliminates the 
musical noise. Besides it adapts to wide range of signal to 
noise ratios. 
After subtracting an overestimate of the noise power 
spectrum the resulting estimated speech spectrum is down-
limited at a minimum β level (spectral floor):

where the spectral floor parameter was set to
β = 0.001
. 
These modifications lead to minimizing the perception of 
the narrow spectral peaks by decreasing the spectral 
excursions and thus lower the musical noise perception. 
To reduce the speech distortion caused by large values of 
α, its value is adapted from frame to frame. The basic idea is 
to take into account that the subtraction process must depend 
on the a posteriori SNR of the frame, in order to apply less 
subtraction with high a posteriori SNR and vice versa. 
The a posteriori SNR is calculated for every frame with:

information in the same frame for frequency domains where 
noise PSD is lower, if noise spectrum is not flat.

C. Multi-Band Spectral Subtraction 
In real environments, the noise spectrum is not uniform 
for all frequencies. For example, in the case of engine noise, 
most of the noise energy is concentrated in the low-
frequency area. To take into account the fact that colored 
noise affects the speech spectrum differently at different 
frequencies, a multi-band linear frequency spacing approach 
to spectral over-subtraction was proposed in [5]. 
The speech spectrum is divided into a number of non-
overlapping bands, and spectral subtraction is performed 
independently in each band. The estimate of the clean speech 
spectrum in the i-th band is obtained by:

In Fig. 2 it is plotted the spectrogram of speech sentence 
“The sky this morning was clear and light blue” affected by 
colored noise. Fig. 3 shows the over-subtraction factor 
computed after dividing the frequency domain into four 
linearly-spaced frequency subbands. It can be seen that the 
over-subtraction factor takes different values depending on 
the SNR in each frequency subband, allowing a better 
distribution of noise reduction over the entire frequency 
domain. 
Because the human ear sensibility depends nonlinearly 
on the frequency, a nonlinear frequency spacing approach for 
multi-band over-subtraction factor estimation is proposed in 
this paper. The method is presented in Section V. 
III. 
CRITICAL BANDS AND BARK SCALE  
The human auditory system is a highly complicated 
mechanism. During the last decades, a considerable progress 
has been made within the research of the human hearing. The 
field of psychoacoustics examines directly the relationships 
between acoustic stimuli and the associated sensations. The 
concept of hearing area refers to the ranges of frequency and 
sound pressure values within which the human ear generally 
perceives sound.  
The absolute threshold of hearing, also known as the 
threshold in quiet, signifies the minimum sound pressure 
level of a pure tone that is enough for the tone to be audible 
in the absence of any interfering voices, i.e., in quiet. 
A prominent contributor to the idea of auditory filters 
was Fletcher who measured the detection threshold of a 
sinusoidal signal in the presence of a bandpass noise masker. 
In his experiment, the noise power density was held constant 
and its centre frequency was always the same as the signal 
frequency. As the noise bandwidth was increased, the 
threshold of the signal also increased at first, but after a 
certain noise bandwidth had been achieved, the signal 
threshold levelled off. 
Basically, the power spectrum model suggests that the 
peripheral auditory system contains a bank of linear 
overlapping bandpass filters called auditory filters. It is 
assumed that when trying to detect a signal in a noisy 
environment, only one filter whose centre frequency is close 
to the frequency of the signal is being used. According to the 
model, this auditory filter blocks out most of the noise and 
only the part passing through the filter affects the masking of 
the signal. In reality, the perception of complex signals, e.g. 
speech, depends on the outputs of several auditory filters and 
not just one.

Figure 5.  Frequency in Hertz and the critical-band rate scale in Bark [13]. 
The assumption of linear auditory filters is also incorrect 
since, strictly speaking, the shape of the filter changes 
slightly with the input level. As the level of the stimulus is 
increased, the slope on the low-frequency side of the 
auditory filter becomes less sharp while the high-frequency 
skirt becomes steeper. This is illustrated in Fig.4. 
In his band-widening experiment, Fletcher introduced the 
concept of critical bandwidth (CB), denoting the noise 
bandwidth limit at which the detection threshold of the signal 
(tone) ceased to increase. For simplicity, he thought that the 
auditory filter could be approximated as having a rectangular 
shape and a passband width equal to CB. Fletcher suggested 
that, with this rectangular model, CB could be evaluated by 
measuring the threshold of a sinusoidal signal in broadband 
white noise [12]. In this method, the power of the tone and 
the power spectral density of the noise masker are first 
measured. The noise power within the same critical band 
with the signal is then equal to the product of the measured 
power spectral density and the CB of the band in question. 
The critical bandwidth can also be explained based on the 
physical structure of the inner ear. Each point on the basilar 
membrane (BM) responds only to a certain range of 
frequencies, which leads to the idea that these different 
points correspond to auditory filters with different centre 
frequencies [12]. 
A commonly used scale for specifying the critical bands 
is the Bark scale which divides the audible frequency range 
of 16 kHz into 24 bands. Fig. 5 illustrates the relationship 
between the frequency in Hertz and the critical-band rate in 
Bark [13]. 
An approximate analytical expression to describe the 
conversion from linear frequency, f, into the critical band 
number z (in Bark) is [13]:

NOISE ESTIMATION 
The noise signal typically has a nonuniform effect on the 
spectrum of the speech. Each spectral component will 
typically have a different effective SNR. Consequently, we 
can estimate and update individual frequency bands of the 
noise spectrum whenever the effective SNR at a particular 
frequency band is extremely low. This observation led to the 
recursive-averaging type of algorithms [8],[9] in which the 
noise spectrum is estimated as a weighted average of past 
noise  estimates and the present noisy speech spectrum. 
The time-recursive algorithms have the following form:

The main advantage of using the time smoothing factor

 given by (22) or (24), as opposed to using a fixed 
value for

frequency dependent. This means that the noise PSD will be 
adapted differently and at different rates in the various 
frequency bins, depending on the estimate of the a posteriori 
SNR

λ
 in that bin. This is particularly suited in 
situations in which the additive noise is colored. 
A different and simpler approach [14] to recursive 
averaging noise estimation is to choose a fixed smoothing 
factor and to control the update of the noise PSD based on 
the comparison of the estimated a posteriori SNR to a 
threshold.

If the a posteriori SNR 
kγ ( )
λ  is found to be smaller than 
a specified threshold ε, suggesting speech absence, then the 
noise spectrum is updated, else, if the a posteriori SNR is 
found to be larger than a specified threshold, suggesting 
speech presence, then the noise spectrum update is stopped. 
The threshold ε can have significant effect on the noise 
spectrum estimation. If ε is chosen too small, then the noise 
spectrum is not updated often enough and is underestimated. 
Else, if ε is chosen too large, then the noise spectrum is 
overestimated. Simulations in [14] showed that choosing 
ε = 2.5
 gave a good compromise.

THE PROPOSED OVER-SUBTRACTION METHOD 
The main drawback of the spectral subtraction method is 
the residual noise resulted as the difference between the 
estimated noise spectrum and the actual noise content present 
in the instantaneous speech spectrum. This residual spectral 
content manifest themselves in the reconstructed time signal 
as varying tonal sounds resulting in a musical like noise.

This residual noise can be reduced by a good estimation 
of the noise PSD and by using the multi-band spectral over-
subtraction. Because the human ear sensibility depends 
nonlinearly on the frequency, a nonlinear frequency spacing 
approach for multi-band over-subtraction factor estimation is 
proposed in this paper. 
The speech spectrum is divided into N non-overlapping 
bands over the Bark scale of frequency distribution, and 
spectral subtraction is performed independently in each band.  
Also, for the noise spectrum estimate, we used the noise PSD

In the frequency domain of 0-4 kHz, specific for the 
speech signal, there are 16 critical bands. Experiments 
showed that there is computational inefficient to separate the 
spectrum into such a large number of intervals. An 
equivalent performance is obtained if there are grouped 
together 3 or 4 critical bands, therefore the spectrum analysis 
to be performed in a total number of 4 or 5 frequency 
domains, keeping the nonlinearity frequency spacing given 
by the human auditory system.

IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The speech signals, sampled at a frequency of 8 kHz, are 
degraded by the various noise types with segmental SNR’s 
of -5 and 0 dB. Different types of noise taken from the 
Noisex92 database [15] are added to the speech signal. The 
noise is chosen with varying spectral distribution simulating 
colored noise (car engine, factory noise, babble noise).  
We used both linear and nonlinear frequency spacing for 
multi-band spectral over-subtraction, in which the over-
subtraction factor 
i
α  is computed as in equation (29) for 
each frequency band. To determine the number of bands that 
gives an optimal speech quality, we varied the number of 
bands from 1 to 8 and examined speech enhancement using 
both types of frequency spacing. 
Objective and subjective quality evaluation methods 
were applied to establish the performance of the algorithms 
presented in this study. 
The Itakura-Saito (IS) distance method is used as an 
objective measure to evaluate the performance of the 
algorithm. The IS measure is based on the similarity or 
difference between the all-pole model of the clean signal and 
the corrupted or processed speech signal. 
In Fig. 7, the mean IS values are plotted as a function of 
the number of bands. These values are obtained using the 
proposed time-recursive estimation for the a posteriori SNR 
used in the over-subtraction factor and a multi-band linear 
scaled frequency at 0, 5, 10 and 15 dB SNR An improvement 
in terms of the IS distance can be seen when the number of 
bands increases from one to six; afterwards, the 
improvement in quality is no longer perceivable. 
Also, we used the ITU-T Recommendation P.862 
(PESQ) [16] to obtain a perceptual evaluation of the 
enhanced speech quality. The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) 
obtained in the evaluation process is between 0 and 5 where 
0 represents a very annoying distortion of the perceived 
signal and 5 represents imperceptible quality degradation.

In Table 2 the simulations show that for a single band 
analysis the results are similar with the standard spectral 
over-subtraction method. The MOS is increasing when using 
more than one band, having a maximum when there are four 
bands, for both methods. Increasing the number of bands 
more than four bands does not give an increasing of quality 
since the resolution in frequency analysis is getting worse.  A 
better quality can be noticed for the time recursive estimation 
of the noise PSD. 
Subjective listening tests indicate that, using the multi-
band approach and the time-recursive estimation, a very 
good speech quality with less musical noise and with 
minimal speech distortion is obtained. 
Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show the spectrograms for speech of 
speech sentence “The sky this morning was clear and light 
blue” affected by train noise and car engine noise, at a SNR 
of 10dB, and the spectrograms of the enhanced speech 
obtained with standard spectral subtraction, spectral over-
subtraction using single-band subtraction factor, multi-band 
spectral 
over-subtraction 
using 
four 
linearly-spaced 
frequency bands, multi-band spectral over-subtraction using 
four non-linear Bark spaced bands and multi-band spectral 
subtraction using the time-recursive estimation of the noise 
PSD. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents an improved spectral subtraction 
method that takes into account the non-uniform effect of 
colored noise on the speech spectrum. A nonlinear frequency 
spacing approach for multi-band over-subtraction factor 
estimation is based on the fact that human ear sensibility 
varies nonlinear in frequency spectrum. This gives a better 
perceived quality to the enhanced speech.  
Also, time-recursive estimation of the noise PSD is used 
to compute the multi-band over-subtraction factor in the 
nonlinear frequency spacing approach. The proposed method 
reduces the residual musical tones that appear in the case of 
conventional power spectral subtraction. Simulations with 
different types of noise show a better quality for the 
enhanced speech when using time recursive multi-band 
spectral subtraction.
