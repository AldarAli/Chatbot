I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, with the spread of smartphones, tablet 
terminals and PCs, the demand for wireless communication is 
expanding. Furthermore, with the advent of video distribution 
and streaming services, the amount of data has increased 
rapidly. Therefore, an Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplex (OFDM) scheme is widely used in wireless 
communication, due to its great advantage of high spectrum 
utilization that is about twice spectral efficiency compared 
with single carrier scheme. Moreover, the OFDM scheme has 
resistance properties to multipath fading.  
Unfortunately, OFDM scheme has high Peak-to-Average 
Power Ratio (PAPR). Many kinds of method have been 
proposed to solve this PAPR problem [1]. The OFDM scheme 
with Constant Amplitude Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) 
precoding, CAZAC-OFDM, is a known modulation 
technique aimed at alleviating the PAPR problem [2][3]. It 
has been reported that one CAZAC sequence in cooperation 
with Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) process converts 
the PAPR of the M-array Quadrature Amplitude Modulation 
(M-QAM) OFDM signal into the PAPR of an M-QAM 
single-carrier signal [4]-[7]. 
In wireless systems under multipath fading environment, 
interference between delayed waves makes amplitude 
fluctuation and phase fluctuation at the receiver front-end. The 
Frequency Domain Equalization (FDE) using pilot subcarriers, 
which is ordinary used in conventional OFDM systems, 
cannot apply the CAZAC-OFDM. In the CAZAC-OFDM 
scheme, IFFT input signal for each subcarrier includes all 
QAM signal components, and each subcarrier carries 
uniformly distributed QAM data. The CAZAC-OFDM has a 
nature of spread-spectrum just like a Code Division Multiple 
Access (CDMA) or convolutional coding. Therefore, the 
CAZAC-OFDM scheme cannot have any pilot subcarriers 
although it has a frequency diversity effect itself.  
In this paper, we study a fading compensation technique 
by applying a transversal filter using Least Mean Square 
(LMS) algorithm to the CAZAC-OFDM. A waveform 
equalizer represented by a transversal filter equalizes the 
transmission channel characteristics by inserting it in front of 
the receiver. When the characteristics of the transmission 
channel are dynamically changing and not in the steady state, 
an adaptive equalizer must be used. In this case, the training 
signal should be sent periodically. The tap coefficients of the 
filter are iteratively updated so that the output signal 
converges to the transmission signal. One type of adaptive 
algorithm used in the adaptive equalizer is the LMS algorithm 
[8]-[10].  
We have confirmed that the CAZAC-OFDM system with 
the proposed transversal filter maintains enough low Bit Error 
Rate (BER) performance under flat fading and frequency 
selective fading channels. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, 
we describe the CAZAC-OFDM system. In Section 3, we 
describe the method of channel estimation. In Section 4, we 
describe the transversal filter. In Section 5, we describe LMS 
algorithm. In Section 6, we show how convergence is 
achieved by updating the tap coefficients of the filter. In 
Section 7, we describe the effect of the proposed transversal 
filter in the CAZAC-OFDM system. Finally, we conclude this 
paper in Section 8.

CAZAC-OFDM SYSTEM 
A. OFDM System 
OFDM system is a kind of multi-carrier modulation 
scheme that digitally modulates and multiplexes a number of 
orthogonal subcarriers in the frequency domain. In the OFDM 
system, data signals are mapped by digital modulation such as 
QAM or PSK. Then, it is converted from frequency domain 
signal to discrete-time domain signal by 𝑁𝑁 size IFFT. The 
discrete-time OFDM signal 𝑥𝑥[𝑛𝑛]  with 𝑁𝑁  subcarriers is 
represented as follows. 
 
𝑥𝑥[𝑛𝑛] = 1
𝑁𝑁 ෍ 𝑋𝑋[𝑘𝑘]𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗2𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋
𝑁𝑁
𝑁𝑁−1
𝜋𝜋=0
 
(1) 
where 𝑗𝑗 = √−1, 𝑛𝑛 is the discrete-time index and 𝑋𝑋[𝑘𝑘] is the 
frequency domain signal [11]. 
In general, OFDM has high PAPR. PAPR is the ratio of 
peak power to average power and is defined by the following 
equation. 
 
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 10 log10
max
0≤𝜋𝜋≤𝑁𝑁−1|𝑥𝑥[𝑛𝑛]|2
mean
0≤𝜋𝜋≤𝑁𝑁−1|𝑥𝑥[𝑛𝑛]|2 [dB] 
(2) 
The value of PAPR increases as the peak power increases 
compared to the average power. As PAPR increases, power 
consumption of the transmitter increases, so PAPR should be 
reduced as much as possible.

B. CAZAC Precoding 
Figure 1 shows the configurations of CAZAC-OFDM 
transmitter and receiver. CAZAC-OFDM reduces PAPR by 
performing precoding using Zadoff-Chu sequence, which is a 
type of CAZAC sequence. The Zadoff-Chu sequence is 
expressed by the following equation. 
 
𝑐𝑐𝜋𝜋 =
⎩⎪⎨
⎪⎧ exp ൬𝑗𝑗 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘(𝑘𝑘 + 1)
𝐿𝐿
൰  (𝐿𝐿 is odd)
exp ቆ𝑗𝑗 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘2
𝐿𝐿

                      𝑘𝑘 = 0,1, ⋯ , 𝐿𝐿 − 1 
(3) 
where 𝐿𝐿 is the sequence length and 𝜋𝜋 is the sequence number. 
Assuming that 𝜋𝜋 = 1 and 𝐿𝐿 = 𝑁𝑁2 in the above equation, the 
Zadoff-Chu sequence is as follows. 
 
𝑐𝑐𝜋𝜋 = exp ቆ𝑗𝑗 𝜋𝜋𝑘𝑘2
𝑁𝑁2 ቇ 
(4) 
where 𝑁𝑁  is the number of subcarriers. Using the above 
equation, CAZAC precoding generates an 𝑁𝑁 × 𝑁𝑁  square 
matrix 𝑴𝑴. 
 
𝑴𝑴 = 1

⋯

The transmission data sequence 𝑿𝑿  with 𝑁𝑁  subcarriers is 
expressed as follows. 
 
𝑿𝑿 = ൦
𝑋𝑋0
𝑋𝑋1
⋮
𝑋𝑋𝑁𝑁−1

(6) 
When the transmission data sequence 𝑿𝑿 is multiplied by the 
square matrix 𝑴𝑴 , the output by CAZAC precoding 𝑷𝑷  is 
expressed by the following equation. 
 
𝑷𝑷 = 𝑴𝑴𝑿𝑿 
= 1

(7) 
When IFFT is performed on the output by CAZAC precoding 
𝑷𝑷, the time signal of CAZAC-OFDM 𝑠𝑠𝜋𝜋 is expressed by the 
following equation. 
 
𝑠𝑠𝜋𝜋 = 𝑐𝑐ቀ𝑁𝑁
2−𝜋𝜋ቁ𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑁𝑁 ∙ 𝑋𝑋ቀ𝑁𝑁
2−𝜋𝜋ቁ𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑁𝑁 
(8) 
Therefore, as shown in Figure 2, the time domain signal of 
CAZAC-OFDM is obtained by rotating the phase of the 
mapping data while maintaining the amplitude of the mapping 
data. As a result, CAZAC-OFDM has reduced PAPR 
compared to conventional OFDM.

In the conventional OFDM, the mapped value 𝑿𝑿 is directly 
input to the IFFT. Therefore, in the frequency domain, each 
data is allocated to each subcarrier as shown in Figure 3a. On 
the other hand, in CAZAC-OFDM, 𝑷𝑷 obtained by multiplying 
the mapped value 𝑿𝑿 by the matrix 𝑴𝑴 generated from the 
Zadoff-Chu sequence is input to the IFFT. In this case, the 
data loaded on the subcarrier is represented by the sum of the

components of 𝑿𝑿 with different phase rotations. Therefore, in 
the frequency domain, as shown in Figure 3b, all data are 
included in each subcarrier. This is the frequency diversity 
effect.

III. 
CHANNEL ESTIMATION 
A. Channel Estimation in Conventional OFDM 
In wireless communication, amplitude fluctuation and 
phase fluctuation occur in the transmission channel due to the 
influence of multipath fading. Therefore, the error rate of data 
becomes large. So, in the conventional OFDM, pilot 
subcarriers are used as a method to estimate the characteristics 
of multipath fading. The pilot subcarriers are known signals 
on the receiving side added for channel estimation, and is 
periodically inserted into the data subcarriers as shown in 
Figure 4. By examining how much the pilot subcarriers are 
fluctuated on the receiving side, it becomes possible to 
estimate the characteristics of multipath fading at that time. 
 
Figure 4.  The example of pilot subcarriers. 
 
B. Pilot Subcarriers in CAZAC-OFDM 
As described above, in the conventional OFDM, the 
characteristics of multipath fading are estimated by inserting 
pilot subcarriers, and correction is performed accordingly. 
However, this method cannot be used in CAZAC-OFDM. 
This is due to the frequency diversity effect of CAZAC-
OFDM. In the IFFT output after CAZAC precoding, all data 
in the time domain will be distributed to each subcarrier. 
Therefore, even if pilot subcarriers are inserted as shown in 
Figure 5, in the IFFT output, the information as the pilot 
subcarriers is dispersed to all the subcarriers, so that it cannot 
function as pilot subcarriers. Therefore, CAZAC-OFDM 
cannot correct the effect of multipath fading. Therefore, it is 
necessary to correct the influence of multipath fading without 
using pilot subcarriers.

TRANSVERSAL FILTER 
A. Structure 
The model of the transversal filter is shown in Figure 6. The 
transmitted signal is received under the influence of multipath 
fading. Therefore, by inserting the transversal filter in front of 
the receiver on the receiving side, it is possible to estimate the 
transmission signal and correct the influence of multipath 
fading. 
 
Figure 6.  Transversal filter. 
 
B. Principle 
In the transversal filter of Figure 6, the output signal 𝑦𝑦(𝑡𝑡) 
is expressed by the following equation. 
 
𝑦𝑦(𝑡𝑡) = 𝒙𝒙𝑇𝑇(𝑡𝑡)𝒘𝒘(𝑡𝑡) 
(9) 
The input signal 𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡)  and the tap coefficient 𝑤𝑤(𝑡𝑡)  are 
respectively expressed as follows. 
 
𝒙𝒙(𝑡𝑡) = ൦

𝑥𝑥(𝑡𝑡 − 1)

where the number of taps is 𝑁𝑁 + 1 . The input signal is 
assumed to be in steady state. Here, let the training signal be 
𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡). An error signal ε(𝑡𝑡), which is the difference between the 
output signal and the training signal is expressed by the 
following equation. 
 
𝜀𝜀(𝑡𝑡) = 𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡) − 𝑦𝑦(𝑡𝑡) 
(12) 
The tap coefficient 𝒘𝒘 is set such that the error signal ε(𝑡𝑡) 
is minimized. As a result, the optimal tap coefficient 𝒘𝒘𝒐𝒐𝒐𝒐𝒐𝒐 is 
as follows [10]. 
 
𝒘𝒘𝒐𝒐𝒐𝒐𝒐𝒐 = 𝑹𝑹−1𝑷𝑷 
(13) 
where 𝑹𝑹 and 𝑷𝑷 are the following formulas, respectively. 
 
𝑹𝑹 = 𝐸𝐸[𝒙𝒙(𝑡𝑡)𝒙𝒙𝑇𝑇(𝑡𝑡)] 
(14) 
 
𝑷𝑷 = 𝐸𝐸[𝑑𝑑(𝑡𝑡)𝒙𝒙(𝑡𝑡)] 
(15) 
where 𝐸𝐸[∙]  is the ensemble average. This equation is the 
solution of the Wiener filter. From the above equation, the 
optimal tap coefficient can be determined by examining the 
autocorrelation of the input signal and the cross-correlation 
between the input signal and the training signal. 
However, to determine the correlation of signals, it is 
necessary to collect the input signal for a long time, so it takes 
a long time to determine the tap coefficient. In addition, it is 
assumed that the signal is stationary, and it is decided to be the 
only optimal tap coefficient, so it cannot cope with the case 
where the characteristics of the transmission channel change 
dynamically. Therefore, these problems are solved by using 
an adaptive filter. 
 
V. 
LMS ALGORITHM 
In the adaptive filter, by iteratively updating the tap 
coefficient, it gradually approaches the optimal value. 
Therefore, if the change of the signal characteristics is slower 
than the convergence time of the adaptive filter, it can 
correspond to the change. 
The steepest descent method is used as a method to update 
the tap coefficient iteratively so as to minimize the error. This 
is to update the tap coefficient in the direction of decreasing 
the gradient of 𝐸𝐸[𝜀𝜀2(𝑡𝑡)] at a certain time 𝑡𝑡, and is expressed 
by the following equation.  
 
𝒘𝒘(𝑡𝑡 + 1) = 𝒘𝒘(𝑡𝑡) − 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸[𝜀𝜀2(𝑡𝑡)]
2𝜇𝜇𝒘𝒘(𝑡𝑡)  
     = 𝒘𝒘(𝑡𝑡) + 𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸[𝜀𝜀(𝑡𝑡)𝒙𝒙(𝑡𝑡)] 
(16) 
where 𝜇𝜇 is the step size parameter, which is the parameter that 
determines the size of the slope down in one update. As the 
above equation shows, it requires ensemble average. 
Therefore, frequent updating of the tap coefficient cannot be 
performed. Therefore, LMS algorithm uses instantaneous 
estimates instead. As a result, the equation for updating the tap 
coefficient is as follows [9]. 
 
 
𝒘𝒘(𝑡𝑡 + 1) = 𝒘𝒘(𝑡𝑡) − 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜀𝜀2(𝑡𝑡)
2𝜇𝜇𝒘𝒘(𝑡𝑡) 
     = 𝒘𝒘(𝑡𝑡) + 𝜇𝜇𝜀𝜀(𝑡𝑡)𝒙𝒙(𝑡𝑡) 
(17) 
The convergence condition of the LMS algorithm is as 
follows [10]. 
 
0 < 𝜇𝜇 < 2
𝑁𝑁∗ 
(18) 
where 𝑁𝑁∗ is the maximum value of the eigenvalues of the 
correlation matrix of the input signal. When the step size is 
increased, the convergence speed becomes faster but the 
steady-state error after convergence is increased. On the other 
hand, when the step size is reduced, the steady-state error after 
convergence is decreased but the convergence speed becomes 
slower. Therefore, it is necessary to decide the step size in 
consideration of the tradeoff between the convergence speed 
and the steady-state error. 
 
VI. 
CONVERGENCE BY UPDATING TAP COEFFICIENTS 
We simulated the convergence of constellation and time 
domain signals on the receiving side by updating the tap 
coefficient using MATLAB / Simulink. The simulation results 
are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively. Note that as the 
constellation and the time domain signals progress from 
Figure 7a to 7d, it indicates that time has elapsed. 
The following figure shows that the constellation and the 
time domain signals converge as the tap coefficients are 
updated iteratively. As a result, communication becomes 
possible as usual only after convergence.

VII. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION BY SIMULATION 
A. Simulation Specification 
In this paper, in order to confirm how much the error rate 
of the signal is improved by using the transversal filter, the 
BER performance of CAZAC-OFDM and conventional 
OFDM are compared using MATLAB / Simulink. 
Figures 9 and 10 show the configurations of CAZAC-
OFDM transmitter and receiver, respectively. In addition, the 
transmitter and receiver configurations of the conventional 
OFDM, which does not use CAZAC precoding are structures, 
which removed the block of CAZAC precoding from Figures 
9 and 10. 
On the transmitting side, mapping (16QAM) is first 
performed on transmission data. Then, CAZAC-OFDM signal 
is generated by performing parallelization by serial-to-parallel 
conversion, CAZAC precoding and IFFT. At this time, if 
IFFT is performed without CAZAC precoding, a conventional 
OFDM signal is generated. After that, guard intervals are 
inserted, 
serialized 
by 
parallel-to-serial 
conversion, 
quadrature modulation is performed, and the signal is 
transmitted. 
On the receiving side, fading in the transmission channel is 
corrected by passing through a transversal filter after 
quadrature demodulation. Then, received data is generated by 
serial-to-parallel conversion, removal of guard intervals, FFT, 
CAZAC 
decoding, 
parallel-to-serial 
conversion, 
and 
demapping.

this result, it is proved that CAZAC-OFDM can obtain almost 
the same BER performance as conventional OFDM when the 
transversal filter is used.

We compared the BER performance under flat fading and 
frequency selective fading channels. The simulation results 
are shown in Figure 12. From this result, it is proved that 
CAZAC-OFDM can obtain almost the same BER 
performance as that of the conventional OFDM by using the 
transversal filter even under fading environment. That is, it is 
concluded that CAZAC-OFDM is effective even under flat 
fading and frequency selective fading channels by using the 
transversal filter.

VIII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed a method to improve the 
negative effect of multipath fading by applying the transversal 
filter to CAZAC-OFDM system. Moreover, it has been 
confirmed by simulation that the CAZAC-OFDM system with 
the transversal filter maintains enough low BER performance 
under flat fading and frequency selective fading channels. The 
result shows that the CAZAC-OFDM system is effective 
under fading environment.
