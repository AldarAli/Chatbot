Abstract— The paper describes an approach that utilizes 
Visible Light Communication (VLC) to generate landmark 
route and alert instructions for supporting people's wayfinding 
activities. The system consists of multiple transmitters, which 
are ceiling luminaries that transmit map information, alerts, 
and path messages necessary for wayfinding. Optical receivers 
are used to collect this information. The system operates in real 
time, providing users with the most optimal route to their 
destination, thereby helping them avoid congested areas. The 
transmitters employ tetrachromatic identifier white sources, 
which serve the dual purpose of providing lighting and 
different data channels for each chip. The data is encoded, 
modulated, and converted into light signals. By employing 
joint transmission, mobile optical receivers can capture data at 
high frame rates, determine their own location, and 
simultaneously read transmitted data from each transmitter. 
The communication is bidirectional, allowing users to interact 
with the received information. The system calculates the best 
route through the venue, taking into account static or dynamic 
destinations. 
Additionally, 
the 
paper 
mentions 
the 
consideration of buddy wayfinding services. According to the 
results presented, the system not only enables self-location but 
also deduces the travel direction and interacts with the 
received information. This optimization process helps users 
navigate efficiently towards their desired destination, whether 
it is a static or dynamic location.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Navigation systems have traditionally relied on Global 
Positioning System (GPS) for outdoor positioning, providing 
users with direct and shortest routes based on their current 
location and intended destination. However, when it comes 
to indoor navigation, GPS is not suitable due to the difficulty 
of satellite signals penetrating buildings' roofs, tunnels, or 
floors. This limitation has led to the development of 
alternative indoor positioning systems based on various radio 
technologies. 
One commonly used technology for indoor positioning is 
Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi signals can be utilized to estimate a user's 
location within a building by measuring signal strengths 
from 
multiple 
access 
points. 
By 
comparing 
these 
measurements, the system can determine the user's position. 
Bluetooth is another technology used for indoor positioning. 
Bluetooth beacons or tags placed strategically within a 
building emit signals that can be detected by users' devices. 
The strength and proximity of these signals allow the system 
to 
calculate 
the 
user's 
position. 
Radio-Frequency 
Identification (RFID) [1][2] is also employed in some indoor 
positioning systems. RFID tags attached to objects or worn 
by users emit radio signals that can be detected and used for 
determining location. Visible Light Communication (VLC) 
[ 3 ] is a relatively newer technology used for indoor 
positioning. As mentioned, VLC can be utilized to transmit 
data, including map information and path messages, to aid in 
wayfinding activities. VLC systems use light signals emitted 
by transmitters and collected by optical receivers to 
determine the user's location and provide navigation 
instructions. 
These 
radio-based 
technologies 
provide 
alternatives to GPS for indoor positioning and have been 
employed in various indoor navigation systems. Each 
technology has its own advantages and limitations, and the 
choice of technology depends on factors such as the specific 
use 
case, 
accuracy 
requirements, 
and 
infrastructure 
availability. In order to solve the contradiction between the 
explosive growth of data and the consumption of spectrum 
resources, VLC has become the development direction of the 
next generation communication network with its huge 
spectrum resources, high security, low cost, and so on [4][5]. 
 Visible light can be used as an Identifier (ID) system and 
can be employed for identifying the building itself. The main 
idea is to divide the service area into spatial beams 
originating from the different ID light sources and identify 
each beam with a unique timed sequence of light signals. 
The signboards, based on arrays of LEDs, positioned in 
strategic directions [6], can be modulated acting as down- 
and up-link channels in the bidirectional communication. For 
the consumer services, the applications are enormous. 
Positioning, navigation, security and even mission critical

services are possible use cases that should be implemented. 
VLC is a data transmission technology that can easily be 
employed in indoor environments since it can use the 
existing 
LED 
lighting 
infrastructure 
with 
simple 
modifications [7] [8]. The use of white polychromatic LEDs 
offers the possibility of Wavelength Division Multiplexing 
(WDM), which enhances the transmission data rate. A WDM 
receiver based on tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin light-
controlled filter can be used [9] [10] to decode the received 
information. Here, when different visible signals are encoded 
in the same optical transmission path, the device multiplexes 
the different optical channels, performs different filtering 
processes 
(amplification, 
switching, 
and 
wavelength 
conversion) and finally decodes the encoded signals 
recovering the transmitted information. 
In this paper, a VLC based guidance system to be used 
by mobile users inside large buildings is proposed. After the 
Introduction, in Section 2, a model for the system is 
proposed and the communication system described. In 
Section 3, the main experimental results are presented, 
downlink and uplink transmission is implemented and the 
best route to navigate calculated. In Section 4, the 
conclusions are drawn. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The main goal is to specify the system conceptual design 
and define a set of use cases for a VLC based guidance 
system to be used by mobile users inside large buildings. 
A. Background Theory  
The system model consists of two main modules: the 
transmitter and the receiver, as depicted in Figure 1.

Fig. 1. a) Transmitters and receivers 3D relative positions and footprints 
in the square topology. b) Configuration and operation of the pin/pin 
receiver. 
The transmitter module is responsible for converting data 
from the sender into an intermediate data representation in 
byte format. This byte-format data is then converted into 
light signals emitted by the transmitter. To achieve this, the 
data bit stream is input to a modulator, which utilizes an ON-
OFF Keying (OOK) modulation scheme. The OOK 
modulation modulates the light signal to represent the digital 
data being transmitted. On the transmission side, the digital 
data is converted into analog data, and a modulation process 
takes place. The driver circuit will keep an average value 
(DC power level) for illumination, combining it with the 
analog data intended for communication. The visible light 
emitted by the LEDs passes through the transmission 
medium and is then received by the MUX device.  
To realize both the communication and the building 
illumination, white light tetra-chromatic sources (WLEDs) 
are used providing a different data channel for each chip. 
The transmitter and receiver relative positions are displayed 
in Figure 1a. Each luminaire is composed of four 
polychromatic WLEDs framed at the corners of a square. At 
each node, only one chip is modulated for data transmission 
(see Figure 1a), the Red (R: 626 nm¸ 25 μW/cm2), the Green 
(G: 530 nm, 46 μW/cm2), the Blue (B: 470 nm, 60 μW/cm2) 
or the Violet (V, 400 nm, 150 μW/cm2).  A fundamental 
difference between VLC and regular radio frequency (RF) 
communication is that VLC does not allow amplitude or 
phase modulation, and it must encode information by 
varying emitted light intensity. The LED can be dimmed 
(“off”) when transmitting data bit '0’ and at its maximum 
brightness ("on") when transmitting data bit '1'. This way, 
digital data is represented by the presence or absence of a 
carrier wave. The signal is propagating through the optical 
channel, and a VLC receiver, at the reception end of the 
communication link, is responsible to extract the data from 
the modulated light beam. In the receiving system, a MUX 
photodetector acts as an active filter for the visible spectrum. 
The integrated filter consists of a p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-
n heterostructure with low conductivity doped layers [10] as 
displayed in Figure 1b. It transforms the light signal into an 
electrical signal that is subsequently decoded to extract the 
transmitted information. The obtained voltage is then 
processed, by using signal conditioning techniques (adaptive 
bandpass 
filtering 
and amplification, 
triggering and 
demultiplexing), until the data signal is reconstructed at the 
data processing unit (digital conversion, decoding and 
decision) [11] [12]. At last, the message will be output to the 
users. In order to receive information from several 
transmitters, the receiver must position itself so that the 
circles corresponding to the range of each transmitter 
overlap. This results in a multiplexed (MUX) signal that acts 
both as a positioning system and as a data transmitter. The 
grid sizes were chosen to avoid overlap in the receiver from 
adjacent grid points. The nine possible overlaps (#1-#9), 
defined as fingerprint regions are also pointed out for the unit 
square cell, in Figure 1a. 
B. Lighting Plan layout and Building model  
In VLC geotracking, geographic coordinates are 
generated to provide location information. However, the 
14

usefulness of this feature is further enhanced by using these 
coordinates to determine meaningful locations within a 
building and guide users through unfamiliar spaces or 
towards specific destinations, such as meeting rooms. To 
facilitate this process, VLC employs cells for positioning and 
a Central Manager (CM) that oversees and manages the 
entire system, including generating optimal routes. In Figure 
2 the 3D building model is depicted.

Fig. 2. a) Indoor layout and proposed scenario. b) Clusters of cells in 
square topology. c) 3D optical scenario (RGBV).  
Building a geometry model of buildings’ interiors is 
complex. A square lattice topology was considered for each 
level [13]. A user navigates from outdoor to indoor (Figure 
2a). This topology is represented using x, y and z axes to 
simplify the distance between any pair of nodes. Each 
room/crossing/exit represents a node, and a path as the links 
between nodes. The user positions can be represented as 𝑃 
(𝑥, 𝑦, z) by providing the horizontal positions (𝑥, 𝑦) and the 
correct floor number z. The ground floor is level 0 and the 
user can go both below (z<0) and above (z>0) from there. 
Lighting in large environments is designed to illuminate the 
entire space in a uniform way. Ceiling plans for the LED 
array layout, in floor 1 is shown in Figure 2b.  Each node 
emits light all around it and up to a certain range, which 
allows each cell to be divided into nine footprints depending 
on which LEDs are covering any given space (Figure 2b), 
thus allowing the system to determine the position of a user 
or device in any given cell, q(x,y,z,).  is one of the eight 
possible steering angles (arrows along the cardinal points in 
Figure 2b) and guides the user across his path. The 3D model 
generation is based on footprints of a multi-level building 
that are collected from available sources (luminaires), and 
are displayed on the user receiver for user orientation. It is a 
requirement that the destination can be targeted by user 
request to the CM and that floor changes are notified. Each 
unit cell can be referred as Ci,j,k were i, j, k  are the x, y 
position in the square unit cell of the top left node and k the 
floor  level. 
C. Architecture and Geolocation 
Fog/Edge computing is a paradigm that brings computing 
capabilities closer to IoT devices by utilizing network nodes 
in the proximity of these devices. It enables tasks such as 
computing, storage, networking, and data management to be 
performed on these nodes, thereby reducing latency and 
bandwidth usage by offloading processing from the cloud. 
A mesh cellular hybrid structure is proposed and 
displayed in Figure 3. This architecture consists of VLC-
ready access equipment, that provides the computing 
resources, end devices, and a controller that is in charge of 
receiving service requests and distributing tasks to fog nodes.

Fig. 3. Mesh and cellular hybrid architecture.  
A user moves from outdoor to indoor and requests 
assistance in finding the right track (D2I). They can 
customize their points of interest for wayfinding services. 
The requested information (I2D) is sent by the emitters, at 
the ceiling, to its receiver. This architecture serves two 
purposes: enabling edge computing and device-to-cloud 
communication, and enabling peer-to-peer communication 
for information exchange.  
Under this architecture, the short-range mesh network 
purpose is twofold: enable edge computing and device-to-
cloud communication, by ensuring a secure communication 
from a luminaire controller to the edge computer or 
datacenter (I2CM), through a neighbor luminaire/signboard 
controller with an active cellular connection; and enable 
peer-to-peer communication (I2I), to exchange information.

Each WLED emits a unique VLC signal for identification, 
and the optical receiver calculates the user's track using this 
information and a position algorithm The indoor route (track; 
q(x, y, z, , t)) is presented to the user via messages (I2D)  
transmitted by the ceiling luminaires acting as routers or 
mesh/cellular nodes. 
III. 
COOPERATIVE GUIDANCE SYSTEM 
Cooperative guidance systems enhance navigation accuracy by 
integrating data from multiple sources for seamless and reliable 
guidance. 
A. Communication protocol, coding/decoding techniques  
To code the information, an OOK modulation scheme was 
used, and it was considered a synchronous transmission 
based on a 64- bits data frame. The frame is divided into 
three main blocks (Sync, Navigation data and Payload) as 
displayed in the top of Figure 4 where a received MUX 
signal is displayed and decoded.

The header block is the synchronization block [10101].  
This first block refers to the starting bit sequence that is 
repeated in every data frame and allows the receiver to 
determine from an array of incoming bits where each frame 
begins. For this purpose, the same header bit sequence is 
imposed simultaneously to all emitters, in this case in an 
alternating “on”- “off” pattern [10101]. The second block 
contains the ID, 4+4+4 bits, gives the geolocation (x,y,z 
coordinates) of the emitters inside the array (Xi,j,k). These IDs 
were encoded using a 4-bit binary representation for the 
decimal number. The z coordinate refers to the floor number, 
which can be negative thus the first bit is used to represent 
the floor number’s sign (‘0’ when a positive number, ‘1’ 
when a negative number) and the remaining three bits 
indicating the coordinate’s value. When bidirectional 
communication is required, the user must register by 
choosing a username (pin1) with 4 decimal numbers, each 
one associated to a RGBV channel. If buddy friend services 
are required a 4-binary code of the meeting (pin2) must be 
inserted. The  block (steering angle ()), a 4-bit sequence, 
completes the user’s pose in a frame time q(x,y, , t). Eight 
steering angles along the cardinal points are possible from a 
start point to the next goal as pointed out as dotted arrows in 
Figure 2. The codes assigned to the pin2 and to  are the 
same in all the channels. If no wayfinding services are 
required these last three blocks are set at zero and the user 
only receives its own location. The third and final block is 
named the payload and refers to sequence of bits that is not 
necessary for the navigation service. It is made up of 
miscellaneous data and followed by a stop bit. Using the 
photocurrent signal measured by the photodetector, it is 
necessary to decode the received information. A calibration 
curve is previously defined to establish this assignment 
[14].The calibration curve refers to a sequence of bits that, 
when received, is purposefully meant to reach each of the 
possible decoding levels. calibration curve (MUX signal) 
make use of 16 distinct photocurrent thresholds which 
correspond to a bit sequence that allows all the sixteen 
combinations of the four RGBV input channels (24). If the 
calibrated levels (d0-d15) are compared to the different four-
digit binary codes assigned to each level, then the decoding 
is obvious, and the message may be read [14].

The footprint position comes directly from the 
synchronism block, where all the received channels are, 
simultaneously, on or off.  The binary code from the higher 
amplitude (horizontal lines in Figure 4) gives the received 
channel. So, two different signals were received by user 
“7261” at footprints #1  [1111] and  # 4 [1011].  The next 
block of 12 bits gives de ID of the received nodes R3,4,1, 
G33,1, B44,1 and V4,3,1 (#1)  or R3,4,1, B44,1 and V4,3,1 in #4. 
Then the user code (pin1/”7261”) and the meeting code 
(pin2/”3”) as well as the  steering angle (/S) are decoded . 
The last block is reserved for the transmission of the 
wayfinding message.

Fig. 5. Fine-grained indoor localization and navigation in successive 
instants. On the top the transmitted channels packets are decoded [R, 
G, B, V]. 
Data shows that at t0 the network location of the received 
signals is R3,2,1, G3,1,1, B4,2,1 and V4,1,1, at t1 the user receives 
the signal only from the R3,2,1, B4,2,1 nodes and at t2 he was 
moved to the next cell since the node G3,1,1 was added at the 
receiver. Hence, the mobile user “7261” begins his route into 
position #1 (t0) and wants to be directed to his goal position, 
in the next cell (# 9). During the route the navigator is guided 
to E (code 3) and, at t1, steers to SE (code 2), cross footprint 
#2 (t3) and arrives to #9. The ceiling lamps (landmarks) 
spread over all the building and act as edge/fog nodes in the 
network, providing well-structured paths that maintain a 
navigator’s orientation with respect to both the next 
landmark along the path and the distance to the eventual 
destination. 
Also, the VLC dynamic system enables cooperative and 
oppositional geolocation. In some cases, it is in the user’s 
interest to be accurately located, so that they can be offered 
information relevant to their location and orientation (pin 1, 
pin2 and  blocks). In other cases, users prefer not to disclose 
their location for privacy, in this case these last three blocks 
are set at zero and the user only receives its own location. 
C. Multi-person cooperative localization and guidance 
services 
In Figure 6, the MUX synchronized signals received by two 
users that have requested guidance services, at different 
times, are displayed. In the top of the figure, the decoded 
information is shown and the simulated scenario is inserted 
to guide the eyes. At the right hand the request/response 
information is inserted.

Fig. 6. MUX/DEMUX signals assigned requests from two users (“3009” 
and “7261”) at different poses (C4,4,,1; #1W and C2,3,-1; #6 W ) and in 
successive instants (t1 and t3). 
 
We have assumed that a user located at C2,3,-1,  arrived 
first (t1), auto-identified as (qi (t1 ), i="7261",) and informed 
the controller of his intention to find a friend for a previously 
scheduled meeting (code 3). A buddy list is then generated 
and will include all the users who have the same meeting 
code. User “3009” arrives later (qj (t3 ), sends the alert 
notification (C4,4,1; t3) to be triggered when his friend is in his 
floor vicinity, level 1, identifies himself (“3009”) and uses 
the same code (code 3), to track the best way to his meeting . 
The “request” message includes, beyond synchronism, the 
identification of the user (“3009”), its address and 
orientation, qi(t), (C4,4,1, #1W) and the help requested 
(Wayfinding Data). Since a meet-up between users is 
expected, its code was inserted before the right track request. 
Upon receiving this request (t3), the buddy finder service 
uses the location information from both devices to determine

the proximity of their owners (qij (t3)) and provides the best 
route to the meeting, avoiding crowded areas. In the 
“response”, the block CM identifies the CM [0000] and the 
next blocks the cell address (C4,4,1), the user (3009) for which 
the message is intended and finally the requested 
information: meeting code 3, orientation NE (code 4) and 
wayfinding instructions.  
Results show that, with VLC's dynamic LED-aided 
guidance system, users can get accurate route guidance and 
perform navigation and geotracking. Users of VLC in large 
buildings will be able to find the shortest route to their 
destination, providing directions as they go. 
Moreover, the bidirectional communication capabilities 
of the system open up possibilities for various services. For 
example, mission-critical services can utilize the reliable 
and low-latency communication provided by the ID system. 
Furthermore, consumer-oriented services such as location-
based advertisements, personalized information delivery, 
and indoor wayfinding can be implemented to enhance user 
experiences within the building.

CONCLUSIONS 
We have proposed and characterized a VLC-based 
guidance system for mobile users inside large buildings. A 
mesh cellular hybrid structure was chosen as the architecture, 
and the communication protocol was defined for a multi-
level building scenario. An analysis of bidirectional 
communication between the infrastructure and the mobile 
receiver was conducted.  
According to global results, the location of a mobile 
receiver is found in conjunction with data transmission. The 
dynamic LED-aided guidance system provides accurate 
route guidance, allows navigation, and keeps track of the 
route. Localization tasks are automatically rescheduled in 
crowded regions by the cooperative localization system, 
which provides guidance information and alerts the user to 
reschedule.  
Additionally, the ID system based on visible light can 
enhance security 
within the building. The unique 
identification of spatial beams enables the implementation 
of access control systems, ensuring that only authorized 
individuals can access specific areas. Overall, the utilization 
of visible light as an ID system offers significant potential 
for a wide range of applications, including positioning, 
navigation, security, and various consumer services.
