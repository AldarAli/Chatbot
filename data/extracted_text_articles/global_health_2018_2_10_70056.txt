Abstract–Academic performance and students' success are 
closely related to school attendance based on the evidence 
provided by literature. Influenza, an infectious disease, is one 
of the factors that prevent the students from attending classes. 
To study the role of school administration in controlling and 
preventing this disease and its effect on the students' 
performance, a field study was conducted in the schools of 
West Bekaa, Lebanon. Data was collected from private and 
public schools, in addition to the data collected from the 
Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.  The findings revealed 
that influenza is one of the important reasons behind students' 
absence, which affects their performance. Immunization and 
general infection-control measures can be organized by the 
schools' administration to control and prevent the spread of 
this disease.  
Keywords-influenza; communicable diseases; controlling 
measures; immunization; absenteeism; administration. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Influenza is a pandemic disease that spreads worldwide. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 
global health partners record that between 291,000 and 
646,000 people are dying each year from seasonal influenza 
[1]. Unfortunately, schools in the region of Bekaa, Lebanon, 
are not aware of the risks of influenza and they consider it as 
a regular infection. Schools’ administration can play an 
important role in controlling and preventing the spread of 
this disease among students and staff and, therefore, their 
family members. 
High class attendance is correlated with better school 
performance. Absence from school is one of many factors 
that affect students' academic success [2]. School absence 
could be a common source of knowledge to monitor and 
detect the early propagation of diseases in schools especially 
in the case of influenza [3]. Students in schools are exposed 
to many communicable diseases that spread easily among 
them due to direct contact, so an absenteeism reporting 
system is needed in order to control the prevalence of the 
disease and control students' absenteeism [3].  
Kids of school age are the ones who transmit influenza 
the most in society [4]. As stated by American Academy of 
Pediatrics [5], the flu is a communicable disease caused by 
an influenza virus which is extremely contagious and causes 
serious symptoms, which may end in hospitalization or 
death. In addition to affecting the respiratory system, it 
affects the whole body.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II reviews the literature. Section III describes the 
methodology used. Section IV presents the results. Section V 
discusses the obtained results. Section VI sets the conclusion.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Schools have a major role in controlling and preventing 
the transfer of Communicable Diseases (CDs) among 
students [6]. According to Michigan Department of 
Education [7], these diseases can transfer through fecal, oral 
and respiratory contact, direct skin-to-skin contact, indirect 
contact with contaminated objects and surfaces and blood 
borne contact. They also listed the most common 
communicable diseases that can affect students in school 
such as: influenza, common cold, diarrheal illness, E-coli, 
hand- foot and mouth disease, head lice, pink eye, ring 
worm, chickenpox, tuberculosis, measles and many others.  
CD, such as influenza, affects both the global health and 
the economy if they are not controlled as fast as possible [8]. 
So non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies, such as: 
"wearing masks, continuous hand washing and school 
closure" should be done in order to control the spread of the 
diseases [8]. School closure is one of these intervention 
strategies because children can be easily affected and schools 
are the most places where children get contact with each 
other. After applying the strategy of school closure, the 
results showed that closing schools for several weeks can 
decrease the spread of disease but in a very low percentage 
because the patients are still active in the community outside 
the school. Also, this strategy leads to a negative economic 
impact, that’s why other strategies should be applied inside

the schools such as reducing the contact among students as 
much as possible [8].  
Influenza is one of the most common communicable 
diseases that affect the students and the staff members [9]. 
It is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza 
viruses that infect the nose, throat and the lungs [10]. It can 
be transferred though coughing and sneezing when the 
distance between the infected and sick persons is less than 
one meter. The most effective way to prevent the infection 
could be to get immunized against the viruses through 
vaccination [10].  Antivirals, nutritional supplements such 
as vitamin D and physical barriers can also be used to 
decrease the viral infection among children [11].   
Plaspohl et al. [12] stated that literature provides proof 
that 
school 
attendance 
correlates 
with 
educational 
performance and student success. Respiratory illness could 
be a conducive factor in high absences percentages of 
school students. The primary protection for respiratory 
illness is immunization. School-Located Influenza Vaccine 
(SLIV) programs offer larger access for college students to 
be vaccinated. A retrospective review of pre-existing 
information from four educational years was conducted to 
look at the link between SLIV participation and absence 
among students at eight public elementary faculties in 
Effingham County, Georgia. For the two SLIV years, results 
showed variations in average frequency of absences between 
SLIV and non-SLIV years also as between SLIV participants 
and nonparticipants. Implications for apply, embrace the 
potential for exaggerated herd immunity among students, 
which can conjointly reach different parties inside the 
college community and reception, so promoting overall 
healthy and successful students [12].  
In this study, the aims were to analyze the role of school 
administration in controlling influenza in some Lebanese 
schools in West Bekaa region. Also the study aimed to assess 
the current situation of schools in coping with guidelines in 
terms of decisions, infection pathways, information sharing, 
communication, surveillance and to which extend they 
cooperate in this regard.

METHODOLOGY 
A. Research and instrument design  
As shown in the Figure 1, the research design used in this 
study is a mixed method that is called concurrent 
triangulation method (also called an integrative or 
convergent design) [13]. 
As per the conventions of mixed method notation, 
QUAN refers to quantitative methods and QUAL refers to 
qualitative methods. By using concurrent triangular design, 
described in the Figure 2, the researcher collects both 
qualitative and qualitative data, analyzes them and then 
interprets the results together for a better understanding of 
the topic [15]. 
In this research, a questionnaire was used – after being 
validated by the University’s Institutional Research Board –  
to study the role of principals in controlling and preventing 
the prevalence of the influenza virus in West Bakaa's schools 
and its effect on students' performance. The questionnaire 
questions were translated into Arabic to make sure that all 
the participants (principals) understand all the questions and 
answer accurately (validation).  
The second source of data used in this study was the 
Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) database.  All the 
information concerning the prevalence of the influenza virus 
in school aged children and its distribution according to the 
governorate was collected from the ministry’s website [16].

B. Data collection  
Based on Figure 2, a questionnaire was distributed to 25 
schools' principals in West Bekaa schools.  
    After that, a statistical data was collected from the 
Ministry of Public Health about the % of the infected people, 
their distribution according to the governorate and their age 
group. Data collected from the Ministry of Public Health 
covered the year 2017.  
      Then, the Concurrent Triangulation Design was 
applied in this study by analyzing all collected data and 
interpreting them. Finally, we combined and compared 
obtained results.

IV. 
RESULTS 
14.2% of the private schools' principals attended a 
workshop about communicable diseases under the title of 
H1N1 and health care in schools. 57.1% didn't attend any 
workshop, but they are interested in attending one, 14.2% 
didn't attend any workshop and they are not interested in that 
and 14.2 didn't answer this question.  
Concerning the public schools, no one attended any 
workshop about this topic, but 81.8% are interested in 
attending such workshops and 18.1% didn't attend and they 
are not interested in that.  
14% of the private schools' principals knew the number 
of the immunized students in the school (very low numbers) 
and the rest didn't know. 28.5% of them knew the number of 
the immunized staff (very low percentage) and the rest 
didn't. 63% of the public schools' principals knew the 
number of the immunized students and staff in the school, 
while the rest didn't.  
85.5% of the private schools' principals stated the number 
of the students that absent due to influenza (the numbers 
varied between 1 to 10 students per day), 7% stated that no 
one absent and the rest didn’t know or they didn't answer 
(Figure 3). 42% of them stated that the number of the staff 
absent due to influenza varied between 1 to 2 members per 
day, 14.2% stated that none of the staff members were absent 
due to influenza and the rest didn't know or they didn't 
answer (Figure 4). Concerning the public schools, 81% knew 
the number of the students absent due to influenza (the 
numbers varied between 2 to 10 students per day), 9% of 
them said that no one of them absent and the rest didn't know 
(Figure 5). 63.6% of the public schools' principals 
announced that one of the staff members was absent due to 
influenza per day and the rest announced that no one was 
absent due to that (Figure 6). 
78% of the private schools' principals and 54% of the 
public ones considered that influenza was a serious disease 
and the rest of both didn’t consider it serious. 92.8% of the 
private schools' principals and 81.8% of the public ones 
agreed that all the students and the staff members should be 
immunized against influenza and the rest didn’t.  
None of the private schools provided vaccines for 
students against influenza although they had a nurse in each 
of the schools, and 18.8% of the public schools did that, yet 
they all didn't have a nurse in any of the schools. 42.8% of 
the private schools and 27.2% of the public schools educated 
the students and the staff members about the symptoms of 
this virus, while the rest of both didn't.

All of the principals of private schools and 92.8% of the 
public ones were aware of the symptoms of the influenza and 
each one mentioned at least two of them. The answers varied 
between (fever, body aches, red eyes, runny nose, coughing, 
sneezing, sore throat and nasal congestion).

schools. 
 
Principals were not aware enough about of the different 
types of influenza (A, B and C) and the one that affects 
students the most. 64.3% of the private schools' principals 
and 72.8% of the public ones were not aware about that. The 
rest answered that they were aware, but they incorrectly 
named the types such as swine and bird flu. Only few said 
that types A and B are the most common among students, 
they come from animals and have vaccine while C has no 
vaccine.

All of the principals in both schools knew the ways of 
spreading of influenza. Each one of them mentioned at least 
one way. The answers were: touching, direct contact, sharing 
the same materials, coughing, sneezing, play grounds, toilets, 
low hygiene and drink tap water.

85.7% of the private schools' principals and 90.9% of the 
public schools' principals took decisions to control the spread 
of the influenza among the students in the school. Most of 
them focus on hygiene (personal hygiene, hand hygiene, the 
places where the students sit, and the materials that they use 
and share). The rest of the decisions were: eat healthy food, 
use tissues when coughing and sneezing and stay at home the 
first 48 hours when the symptoms appear. 7.1% of the 
private schools' principals said that they need to attend 
workshops concerning that. The rest didn't answer.  
All the public schools and 92.8% of the private ones took 
measures concerning the infected students. Most of them 
called the parents and asked them to keep the student at 
home until full recovery. Around 4% of all exposed the 
patient to a specialist to receive the suitable medicine, 
advised the patient to drink more liquids, not to have direct 
contact with others and to get rest when feeling tired. Few of 
them asked the infected student to stay away and wear a 
mask. The decisions were taken by a health counselor and 
not by the administration in 9% of the public schools. 7.1% 
of the private schools' principals said that they need a 
workshop concerning that.  
57.1% of the private schools' principals and 72.7% of the 
public ones believed that influenza can be prevented from 
spreading by following several ways such as: spread 
awareness, take the suitable decisions, remind them about the 
importance of the hygiene, eat healthy food, and provide 
vaccine. The rest of both didn't believe that influenza can be 
prevented from spreading. 
57.1% of the private schools' principals and 72.7% of the 
public ones agreed that influenza affects the students' 
performance. Some said that it makes them loose their focus 
and concentration; the others said it is due to absence 
because students depend on working in the class and doing 
activities. Few of them said that it affects their performance 
if the teacher is absent for a long time due to influenza. The 
rest of both said that it has poorly or no effect. 
To analyze the collected data, the results were compared 
to data retrieved from the website of the Ministry of Public 
Health. Table 1 shows the data collected from the Ministry 
of Public Health. Out of 1214 SARI cases from 11 sentinel 
sites in Lebanon 98% of the cases were tested (1186), where 
9% of these cases were influenza (105). Out of these 9% 
cases 58% of them were influenza A (H3N2) (61). This % 
decreased to 42 % for influenza B (44). As for influenza A 
(H1N1), (H5N1), (H7N9) and others the % decreased to null 
(0%). As for the geographical distribution (Table 2), the % of 
influenza in Great North (North and Akkar) was the lowest 
(9%) followed by 26% in Great Bekaa, Beirut and Mount 
Lebanon (28%) and the highest recorded was in Great South 
(38%). 
The % of influenza was 10% in age group between 5 and 
14. This % increased slightly to 11% as the age group ranges 
between 50 and 64 and then it increased slightly to 13% as 
the age group ranges between 2 and 4. The influenza % 
increased to 16% as the age group ranges between 0 and 1. 
This % increased to 24% with a slight increase to 25% as the 
age group ranges between 15 and 49 and 65+ respectively. 
As shown in Figure 7, at week 46, in 2016 and from 
week 10 to week 13, number of H3N2 cases was reported. 
However influenza B was reported but the number of cases 
was very low varying between 1% and 4% but with reported 
cases of H1N. However H3N2 appeared between week 49, 
2016 and week 6, 2017 with a peak at week 52, 2016 with a 
value of 18% and type B also appeared between week 52, 
2016 to week 8, 2017 with a peak at week 6, 2017 with a 
value of 10%.

slightly to become around 40% and influenza testing showed 
a slight increase to 2% and such value increased to 20% with 
the increase of SARI cases from 40% to 90% between weeks 
50 and 52. However, such value decreased to nil with the 
decrease of SARI cases to 20% in the second week of 2017 
while it peaked back to 28% at the 6th week of 2017 with the 
increase in SARI cases. But it decreased back with the

Most principals in public schools and private ones were 
aware of severity and seriousness of the effect of influenza 
infection on students' performance and this was greatly 
obvious in the quantitative data since the percentage of the 
principals attended workshops on communicable diseases 
was very low (14.2% in private schools and null in public 
ones).

V. 
DISCUSSION 
   
Regarding the question of being interested in attending 
workshops on communicable diseases and based on the 
measurements of principals who didn't attend any workshop 
but interested in, we can tell that both private and public 
schools show a high motivation and interest towards 
attending workshops that might come in handy in decreasing 
the severity of communicable diseases in schools. Thus, this 
can be shown by the high percentage that is scored in the 
data analysis (57.1 % for private schools and 81.8% for 
public ones).    
86% of the principals of the private schools and 71.5% of 
the public ones didn't know the number of the immunized 
students against influenza in their schools. This is indeed a 
high percentage and consequently it shows that neither the 
principals of the private schools nor the public ones knew 
well the health status of their students. In addition, they aren't 
aware of the consequences that infection with influenza virus 
will reveal sooner on their achievement and academic 
performance. 
A significant hope can be observed based on the analyzed 
data regarding the presence of the foundation of the prior 
knowledge concerning the main issue of our study.  This can 
be shown in the percentage recorded by both private and 
public 
schools 
principals 
about 
the 
agreement 
on 
immunizing both the students and the staff members (92.8% 
and 81.8% respectively).  
Despite the fact that the percentage of providing vaccine 
in public schools is low in comparison with the average 
percentage however, it is still acceptable compared with the 
private ones, which is null. Therefore, public schools took 
the initiative even if it is very slight to be observed as it is 
known regarding fighting against influenza virus but private 
ones didn't.  
There is a low percentage in both private and public 
concerning raising the awareness among students and staff 
members about the symptoms of this virus (42.8% and 
27.2% respectively).  
Now, let us move towards discussing if the principals are 
aware of the symptoms of influenza.  We could tell that they 
are totally aware of them. On the contrary, they aren't aware 
of the different types of influenza. This is absolutely 
referring back to the fact that they aren't enrolled in any 
workshops under this issue.  
There is a high percentage which is observed in reference 
to both schools' principals with respect to taking decisions in 
controlling the spreading of influenza. This might be a good 
indicator if the taken decisions are right ones however, it 
might be not if vice versa.  
Most of the principals of the schools followed the same 
strategies when dealing with infected students; however, few 
of them advocated different strategies that also came in 
handy in healing.  
There is a great agreement by both principals on the fact 
that influenza can be prevented from spreading according to 
the percentage (57.1% for the private schools' principals and 
72.7% for the public ones) whereas, the rest believe the 
opposite.  
The majority of the principals of both schools agreed on 
the fact that influenza directly affects the performance and 
the achievement of the students whether the teacher is absent 
or the student is absent because of the influenza (57.1% for 
the private schools' principals and 72.7% for the public 
ones). Moreover, they also agreed that influenza affects their 
performance in different ways.  
Based on the data collected from the Ministry of Public 
Health, influenza A and B are the most spread types of 
influenza and they are highly exposed to have Severe Acute 
Respiratory Infections. 
Despite the fact that the percentage of influenza in Great 
Bekaa might appear low (26%) and with respect to the age

group from 2-14 (23%) however, we can't deny its severity 
as one of the communicable diseases. Thus, it might be 
alerted percentage. 
After analyzing Figure 3,  " Distribution of Influenza 
positive patients by week of admission, 2016W36-
2017W48" we concluded that influenza is mostly spread in 
winter season which is consistent with the results about 
influenza illness in England [17]. 
Our findings necessitate having a trained nurse in each 
school and establishing an awareness program to educate the 
school managers about the importance of management 
practices such as immunization programs, send sick students 
back to their homes, hand hygiene [18], school closure [19], 
and balanced meals with more fruits and vegetables. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The results of the current study revealed that influenza is 
one of the important reasons behind students' absence. This 
affects their performance and achievements. Although most 
of the schools’ principals were aware of some symptoms of 
influenza, they were not aware of the prevention measures 
to be taken to minimize transmission of the virus. Proper 
management of influenza in schools requires a plan to 
educate the schools principals about prevention measures 
and the ways to implement them.
