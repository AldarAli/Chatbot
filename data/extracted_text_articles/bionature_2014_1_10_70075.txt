Abstract— The biomass pyrolysis technology (carried out at 
moderate temperatures up to 1000˚C) allows improving of 
energy efficiency and workability of biomass utilization. The 
pyrolysis process controlling (with desired composition of 
products) is possible by changing the process parameters 
(temperature, pressure, heating rate, the biomass hold up time 
in pyrolysis reactor). Availability of kinetic equations linking 
technological parameters and vent of the pyrolysis products 
with biomass hold up time at preset temperature range is the 
necessary 
condition 
for 
pyrolysis 
process 
controlling. 
Obtaining of the pyrolysis kinetic parameters based on 
experimental data of the thermogravimetric analysis was the 
purpose of this study. Then, kinetic constants were obtained 
for various types of plant biomass, such as wood, corn straw, 
rice husk, and chicken litter, namely, the order of the pyrolysis 
process, the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. 
Obtained 
constants 
allow 
the 
reactor 
characteristics 
calculating for fixed products of pyrolysis process receiving.

 INTRODUCTION  
Biomass thermochemical conversion in the power-
producing purposes is subdivided into two technologies: 
gasification and pyrolysis. Gasification purpose is reception 
of gaseous fuel with the maximal degree of energy 
conversion (0,70-0,75) to the combustion heat of received 
fuel. The gasifier maximal temperature exceeds 1000 ˚С. 
Carbon of ash content is gasified to the limit by gasifying 
agents. However, gas thermotechnical characteristics do not 
satisfy to the modern power technologies with high intensity 
of heat and mass exchange: combustion heat does not exceed 
10,5-10,9 MJ/nm3, adiabatic combustion temperature is 
about 1400-1500 ˚С. The chemical compound of many kinds 
of biomass (crop residues, abilities to live, sewage sludge, 
etc.) limits the maximal temperature of conversion due to the 
formation of low-melting eutectics.  
The biomass pyrolysis technology (carried out at 
moderate temperatures up to 1000˚C) allows to improve 
energy efficiency and workability of biomass utilization. In 
the pyrolysis process decomposition of organic compounds 
of the initial biomass is carried out with forming of non-
condensable gases (CO, CO2, H2, CH4, etc.), the solid 
residue, and vapors. The vapors are condensated under 
cooling in a mixture of high-molecular liquids (bio-oil) with 
a high energy density [1][2]. The pyrolysis process 
controlling (with desired composition of products) is 
possible by changing the process parameters (temperature, 
pressure, heating rate, the gas environment composition, the 
biomass hold up time in pyrolysis reactor). Availability of 
kinetic equations linking technological parameters and vent 
of the pyrolysis products with biomass hold up time at preset 
temperature range is the necessary condition for pyrolysis 
process controlling. Obtaining of the pyrolysis kinetic 
parameters 
based 
on 
experimental 
data 
of 
the 
thermogravimetric analysis was the purpose of this study. 
The authors studied many types of biomass, not only well-
known, i.e., wood, but also those data which is under-
explored: crop wastes and chicken litter [3]. 
This paper contains theoretical calculation of kinetic 
parameters, using experimental data, and experimental 
method description and obtained data. In conclusion, there is 
a discussion of legality of using this method to determine the 
kinetic parameters for different types of biomass. 
II. 
THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS 
The physical-chemical basis of our method is [4]: 
Biomass pyrolysis process is a simultaneous occurrence 
of many reactions. However, total reaction can be 
schematically represented by a single-component model as: 
Initial sample => Volatile compounds + solid residue 
Reaction rate can be written as a standard kinetic 
equation:

c – sample current mass, n – the order of the reaction, 
݇−rate constant of the total-reaction;

௏೅೑
௏ೖ   
 ்ܸ೑ – volatile matter loss at the temperature  ܶ௙ , ܸ௞- 
volatile matter loss at the end of the pyrolysis process. 
We can finally get the formula for the rate constant using 
the Arrhenius equation:

ߚ and ܼ – heating rate and pre-exponental factor, ܧ – 
activation energy. 
 In (2), there are three unknowns: the activation energy E, 
pre-exponential factor Z, and the reaction order n. 
Obtaining of a system of three equations is required to 
find these unknowns. The inflection point is the 
characteristic point of the kinetic curve. Exactly for this point 
required three equations could be found. 
The first equation is obtained by applying (2) for the 
inflection point. The maximum of decomposition rate with 
certainty is obtained from the experimental derivative 
thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) curve:

EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES 
Thermogravimetric data were obtained on a modern 
thermoanalyzer SDT Q600 firm "TA Instruments" (USA). It 
is a high-precision instrument with a wide range of 
opportunities. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and DTG 
curves can be received with different heating rates in an 
artificially created gas atmosphere during pyrolysis process 
at the different final temperatures, etc. The pyrolysis process 
parameters for all kinds of biomass have a decisive influence 
on the kinetic regularities of this process. 
At the studies first stage, namely, a thermal analysis of all 
types of biomass was carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere 
with a heating rate of 10 K/min. TGA and DTG 
measurements were performed simultaneously. The DTG 
curve could precisely determine undecomposed biomass 
content, rate of decomposition and temperature at the 
inflection point. All these values correspond to the maximum 
on the DTG curve. This method allows receiving the correct 
input data for solving the system of equations (3). 
Sample weight was measured by comparing the mass 
microbalance empty cup and cup with sample. 
Low sample weight (less than 100 mg) and size suggest 
pyrolysis proceeding in the kinetic mode without internal 
and external diffusion limitations. 
Sample weight was measured by comparing the mass 
microbalance empty cup and cup with sample. Table I shows 
sample weight data.

Based on these results, we can conclude that the 
pyrolysis process is a sum of the parallel-serial reactions 
(because the order of the process is not an integer number). 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The obtained data indicate the correctness of using this 
method to determine the kinetic parameters for different 
types of biomass. The largest discrepancy between 
calculated and experimental curve is 7%, which can be 
considered as acceptable. The obtained data can be used for 
pyrolysis reactor characteristics calculations. Explored 
phytogenic kinds of biomass (wood, corn straw, rice husk, 
chicken litter) have only one inflection point at TGA curve 
and one extreme at DTG curve. The main components of 
these biomass types are lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose 
which determine the thermal decomposition kinetics of the 
thermochemical degradation. The complex nature of the 
thermal decomposition and differed kinetic parameters of 
chicken litter due to its structure: biomass, which contains 
the minimum amount of lignin and cellulose (chicken 
manure) and phytogenic biomass (litter). On the DTA curve 
there are several clear-cut inflection points, in which the rate 
of decomposition passes through an extreme. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Based on the proposed method, the following kinetic 
constants were obtained: the order of the pyrolysis process, 
the activation energy and pre-exponential factor - for various 
types of plant biomass: wood, corn straw, rice husk, chicken 
litter. 
Obtained constants allow calculating the reactor 
characteristics for fixed products of pyrolysis process 
receiving. 
Waste made of biomass utilization is of considerable 
interest from both an ecological and power-engineering point 
of view. 
Some further research directions: 
- 
the kinetics constants for different heating rates 
determination; 
- 
the pyrolysis kinetics in various gas atmospheres 
exploration; 
- 
study the effect of internal thermal effects 
(exothermic) on the kinetics of pyrolysis.
