Abstract–An important factor in modern development are 
promising nanotechnologies. One of the most popular areas of 
research in this field is modeling the nonlinear gas-dynamic 
processes in micro- and nanochannels. This problem is 
relevant for many applications on introducing and using the 
nanotechnology 
in 
various 
industries. 
A 
feature 
of 
mathematical problems in this area is the simultaneous study 
of processes at many scales, including micro- and nanoscales. 
In this paper, technology of the supercomputer realization of 
multiscale two-level approach to modeling the gas flow in 
microchannel is presented. The approach is based on 
combining the models of continuum mechanics and the 
Newton's dynamics for single particles. Two scale levels are 
considered: 
macroscopic 
and 
microscopic. 
The 
quasigasdynamic equations system is used as a mathematical 
model at the macrolevel. The molecular dynamics method is 
used as a mathematical model at microlevel. Numerical 
implementation of approach is based on the method of splitting 
into physical processes. The quasigasdynamic equations are 
solved by finite volume method on grids of different types. The 
Newton's equations of motion are solved by Verlet integration 
in each cell of grid independently or in groups of connected 
cells. Within the framework of common methodology, the four 
classes of algorithms and methods of their parallelization are 
offered. Parallelization technology is based on the principles of 
geometric 
parallelism 
and 
efficient 
partitioning 
the 
computational domain. Special dynamic algorithm is used for 
load balancing the computational units. The approach testing 
was made by the example of the nitrogen flow in the nickel 
microchannel. Obtained results confirmed the high efficiency 
of the developed methodology.

 INTRODUCTION 
Modern computer technology allows modeling very large 
technical systems and complex physical processes at the 
level of detailing that was previously not available. In 
computer models of past years, the lack of detail was often 
compensated by introducing the correction coefficients in the 
model that reflected the data obtained experimentally. This 
approach is still being applied, but with the development of 
massively parallel computing systems, it becomes possible to 
get rid of many limitations inherent in simplified models and 
perform direct predictive modeling of a large set of 
interacting 
nonlinear 
and 
multiscale 
processes. 
The 
foregoing is relevant to the study of complex gas-dynamic 
processes in technical micro- and nanosystems, developed 
with the aim of introducing the nanotechnology in industry. 
A feature of mathematical problems in this area is the 
simultaneous study of processes on many scales, including 
micro- and nanoscale. One of the modern and actively 
developing approaches to solving such problems is a 
multiscale approach that combines the methods of continuum 
mechanics and particle methods. This combination allows 
you to replace an expensive and difficult realized physical 
experiment with computer calculations. 
In the paper, the problem of gas flow through a 
microchannel is considered as an example. A multiscale 
approach [1][2] is used for modeling the process, which has 
two levels of detail related to the dimensions of the specific 
geometry of the problem (tens of mean free paths of gas 
molecules and more) and the distance between interacting 
particles (on the order of 1 nm). The implementation of the 
approach is based on splitting by physical processes. At the 
macrolevel of detail, a description of the flow of gas media 
occurs. At the microlevel, the interactions are calculated for: 
1) gas molecules among themselves (forming the equation of 
state, determining transport coefficients); 2) gas molecules 
and atoms of solid surfaces (describing phenomena in 
boundary layers). The system of QuasiGasDynamic (QGD) 
[3] equations is used as the macrolevel model, the Molecular 
Dynamics (MD) [4] method is used as the microlevel model. 
Modeling of tasks with many scales should occur 
according to certain rules. In the approach used, these rules 
also apply. The MD calculations can be carried out in a 
direct way, combining QGD and MD in one implementation, 
and indirectly, by accumulating a corresponding database, 
calculated in advance. It is also possible to use partially the 
MD database and partial direct MD modeling in conjunction 
with the QGD calculations. As a result, computational 
technology contains four main classes of algorithms. 
The main goal of the work is to describe the details of 
algorithms in which the QGD and MD models are used 
directly, alternating at each step, and the results of 
calculations for these algorithms and analysis of the 
calculated data obtained will also be presented. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes 
the state of the art. Section III states the problem and the 
mathematical model. Section IV describes what methods and 
computing algorithms are used in the research. Section V 
presents the results of the current research.

II. STATE OF ART 
The computing complexity of modeling the gas flows in 
microchannels is associated with the violation of continuity 
hypothesis in some parts of the computational domain. The 
physics for functioning of the similar systems is usually 
described by whole hierarchy of mathematical models up to 
the atomic level. The difference in the scales of the 
computational domain and near-surface interaction of the gas 
with the metal lead to the necessity to take into account the 
relief and the properties of the microchannel at the molecular 
level. As a result, the mathematical model of the research 
flow can not be fully formulated within the framework of the 
macroscopic approach. 
The way to overcome the problem of boundary processes 
is molecular modeling of flow-wall interactions [5][6]. In the 
proposed approach, a joint solution of the gas-metal problem 
taking into account the wall structure is carried out within the 
framework of direct MD simulation. Previously, the structure 
of the walls was not taken into account due to the complexity 
of the calculations and the lack of computing power. 
The way to overcome the problem of discontinuity is 
using a multiscale approach [7]-[12]. Multiscale approaches 
have become popular, but existing combinations have many 
limitations on the type of problems, the size of systems, on 
taking into account the real boundary conditions, and so on. 
Most often within the framework of the multiscale approach, 
the Navier-Stokes equations with a continuous model of the 
boundary layer are used without taking into account the real 
structure of the walls. In the proposed approach, there is a 
combination of two models (QGD, MD) and various 
methods of this combination (4 classes of algorithms) are 
presented, and a database calculated by the first class of 
algorithms is also created. Such an integrated approach did 
not exist before.  
Why and when it is necessary to choose the proposed 
approach: when precision calculation is needed; when the 
simulated process is not represented enough and a detailed 
picture of what is happening is necessary; there is computing 
power to apply the approach. 
Advantages of the developed approach are the possibility 
of calculations from the first principles; the ability to vary 
the different parameters of the technique in order to obtain 
acceptable accuracy results within a reasonable time. 
The motivation for a particular study of this work is to 
show that in reality a continuous boundary layer model can 
not give an accurate picture of the flow, since all important 
factors are not known, especially in the case of microflows. 
In this situation, algorithms of class 4 or direct MD modeling 
can give an adequate result to reality. 
III. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
The mathematical model includes two components 
corresponding to the scale levels. 
At the macroscopic level, the QGD equations are used. In 
the case of a pure gas of one kind, the system of QGD 
equations in the three-dimensional case in a form invariant 
with respect to the coordinate system in dimensional 
variables, together with the equations of state is written as:

 coincide, up to sign, with the 
fluxes of mass density, momentum density of the 
corresponding components, and energy density. 
The system of equations (1)-(2) is closed by the 
corresponding initial and boundary conditions. The initial 
conditions are taken in accordance with the equilibrium state 
of the gas medium in the absence of interaction with external 
factors. The boundary conditions for the QGD equations on 
the microchannel walls can be specified by determining the 
fluxes of mass density, momentum density and energy 
density across the boundary using Newton's conditions, or by 
the normal components of them near the walls by the MD 
method. On the free surfaces of the computational domain, 
the so-called "soft" boundary conditions [3] are given. 
Near the walls, the particles (atoms or molecules) that 
make up the material of the walls and are potentially capable 
of detaching from the microchannel surface should be added 
to the consideration. The evolution of the investigated 
system of particles is described by Newton's equations [4].

 is the force of interaction with the environment, 
U  is the total potential energy and it depends on choosing 
the interaction potential of molecules. The potential energy 
of the system is represented as a function that depends on the 
coordinates of considered particles and describes the 
interaction between the particles of the system. 
The initial conditions at the microlevel are determined by 
the equilibrium or quasiequilibrium thermodynamic state of 
the particle system at a given temperature, pressure, and 
average momentum. The boundary conditions at the 
molecular level depend on the simulated situation. 
In the presented technique, there is a choice between the 
accuracy of the result and arithmetic complexity in 
combination with a large amount of computation. The 
compromise is to get the solution with the required accuracy 
in the minimum time. What parameters can we control: the 
size of the grid cells at the macrolevel. If the size is large, 
then QGD is considered fast, the MD is considered very 
slow; if the size is small, then a statistics for MD calculations 
is not very representative. In addition, there is a technique for 
allocating a virtual volume within a cell (see [2]). Also, the 
database, accumulated from the first principles, makes it 
possible to reduce the amount of computation in those flow 
zones where there are no strongly nonequilibrium processes. 
In particular, most of the metal can be frozen. 
A set of benchmarking tests was carried out. For 
example, the calculations of kinetic coefficients were carried 
out according to the algorithms of class 1 [13], calculations 
of gas flows by algorithms 2-4 were carried out in [14][15]. 
IV. COMPUTING ALGORITHMS 
The calculation of the macroparameters according to the 
QGD equations (1) is carried out using an explicit on time 
grid numerical algorithm, which is based on the finite 
volume method on grids of arbitrary type [16][17]. For the 
convenience of solving the problem in areas of complex 
geometry, the hybrid block meshes consisting of cells of 
various shapes and sizes can be used. 
In the presented variant of computational technology, a 
hybrid spatial grid is introduced in the computational domain 
at the macrolevel. All parameters of gas components 
(density, pressure, temperature, velocity vector components, 
etc.) refer to the mass centers of the cells. Flux variables 
refer to the faces centers of the cells. Spatial approximations 
of the basic terms of the QGD equations are performed by 
standard methods (see, for example, [18][19]). The 
computing scheme on time is chosen explicit and two-stage 
(predictor-corrector) and is integrated with the variable step. 
The system of MD equations (3), (4) is used in additional 
calculations independently, or as a subgrid algorithm applied 
within each control volume. To integrate the equations of 
motion (3), (4), the Verlet integration [20] is used. 
To carry out a correct calculation of the QGD, the 
model is supplemented by real gas equations of state, 
transport coefficients and other accompanying parameters 
(enthalpies, average mean free paths, etc.), as well as real 
boundary conditions. Calculation of these dependencies, 
coefficients, and conditions is made using MD methods. 
Modeling of problems on the basis of the multiscale 
approach under consideration with two levels of detail is 
carried out with the help of special algorithms that in 
general, depending on the degree of microlevel use, are 
divided into four classes [15]. 
Algorithms of class 1 suggest the study of the properties 
of gas medium and the properties of solid surfaces with 
which the gas medium contacts in technical applications. As 
a numerical implementation of the approach in this case, the 
Velocity Verlet scheme acts. With the help of 1 class 
algorithms, a DataBase of Molecular dynamic Calculations 
(DBMC) is accumulated for the properties of gases and solid 
materials, which can be used in the framework of other 
algorithms. 
Algorithms of class 2 assume the solution of problems 
only at macrolevel based on QGD system of equations. In 
this case, the properties of the gas (the equations of state by 
pressure and energy, the kinetic coefficients such as viscosity 
and thermal conductivity, the parameters of the boundary 
conditions) are determined from the above-mentioned 
DBMC accumulated in advance for the desired temperature 
and pressure range. 
Algorithms of class 3 imply the simultaneous use of 
QGD equations in the calculations and equations of 
Newtonian mechanics for molecules of a gaseous medium. 
Algorithms of class 3 are realized within the framework of 
the method of splitting into physical processes. It is assumed 
here that in the gaseous medium and on its boundaries it is 
possible to confine ourselves to a local consideration of the 
processes of the gases and gases with a solid wall. 
Algorithms of class 4 also imply the simultaneous use in 
the calculation of QGD equations and equations of 
Newtonian mechanics for molecules of the gaseous medium 
and atoms of the surface layer of the wall. The difference of 
this case from the previous one is that in some areas of the 
medium (usually at the boundary and in the zones of a strong 
drop of the gas parameters), molecular dynamics calculations 
are carried out continuously without going to the macrolevel. 
In the same areas, the principle of locality of molecular 
interactions is not used, that is, in the general case, the 
algorithms of class 4 are nonlocal at the molecular level. 
Direct MD calculation in the framework of algorithms of 
3 and 4 classes seems to be the most justified, since it allows 
to coordinate the interaction processes at micro- and 
macrolevels. Also, a direct MD calculation can be performed 
for a specific set of physical conditions that are not present in 
the DBMC and appear in it as a result of this calculation. 
In this work, the algorithms of class 4 are used for 
calculation the gas flow in microchannel. The resulting grid 
equations in the framework of the algorithms of class 4 at the 
predictor stage are solved not on the whole grid, but on its 
subset. 
In algorithms of class 4, some of the cells are 
permanently assigned to molecular computations (produced 
in parallel with the QGD computations at each time step 
using (1)) and are not considered at the macroscopic level. 
As a rule, these are grid boundary cells. In some cases, 
internal 
cells 
are 
added 
to 
them, 
where 
highly 
nonequilibrium processes occur, characterized by large

gradients of gas-dynamic parameters. Denote the set of all 
such cells as 
B
  (QGD equations in these cells are not 
used). The remaining cells of the grid will be denoted by 
V
 (in these cells, both QGD and MD calculations are 
realized). As a result, the grid is represented as a union of 
two disjoint sets: 
V
B

U
. The transition to the MD 
calculations in the cells of the set 
B
  is carried out once at 
the beginning of the general calculation. In cells from the set 
V
  the transition to MD calculations is performed at each 
step in time. 
The corrector stage includes the use of MD calculations 
and is associated with obtaining corrective values of the 
main gas-dynamic parameters. In algorithms of class 4, this 
correction is used only in cells of the set 
V
 . 
Before the calculation begins, a grid is constructed that is 
split into sets of cells 
V
  and 
B
 . Then in the cells of the 
set 
V
 , the equilibrium state of the macrosystem is set; in 
the cells of the set
B
, the equilibrium state of the 
microsystem, corresponding to the equilibrium state of the 
macrosystem, is given. 
Then, at each step in time, a two-stage procedure is 
carried out. A two-level calculation is carried out in the cells 
of the set 
V
 , presupposing first the solution of the QGD 
equations, and then the correction of the obtained gas 
dynamic characteristics by means of MD calculations. In the 
cells of the set 
B
 , a one-level two-stage calculation is 
performed on the basis of the equations of molecular 
dynamics. 
At the first stage, gas-dynamic variables are calculated in 
the cells of the set 
V
  according to the QGD equations. 
Variables are transferred to the MD unit to recalculate the 
parameters of the conditions at the boundaries of the sets 
V
  and 
B
 . In the cells of the set 
B
 , the evolution of the 
boundary microsystems is calculated, the data of which will 
then form the parameters of the conditions on the boundaries 
of the sets 
B
  and 
V
 . 
At the second stage, in cell sets 
V
  and 
B
  the direct 
calculations are made, which allow obtaining all gas-
dynamic variables at the macrolevel taking into account all 
physical processes. 
The calculation step is completed by testing the 
breakdown criterion, which consists in determining the 
relative time derivatives of the mass density and the energy 
density of the gas. 
Parallel implementation of algorithms of classes 1-4 is 
considered in detail in [15] and earlier works. Here, however, 
it should be noted that the parallel decomposition at the 
macrolevel is based on the method of static decomposition of 
the calculated grid into microdomains. Such a partitioning, 
even with large configurations of computers, is deliberately 
redundant. It allows to equalize the load of processors and/or 
special calculators at various stages of calculations by 
"transferring" a part of microdomains from one calculator to 
another. In the implementation of MD calculations, in 
addition to geometric decomposition, the particle partitioning 
and dynamic load balancing are used. 
The developed approach can be generalized and applied 
to different types of flows, but additional calibration 
calculations and the addition of a database for specific gases 
and metals are needed. The algorithm itself will not change. 
V. RESULTS AND DISSCUSSION 
In this section, we will briefly present the results of 
testing the developed modeling technology. For this, we 
have chosen the problem of the nitrogen flow in a thin 
microchannel with a nickel coating of the inner walls. The 
scheme of the computational experiment consisted in 
calculating, on the basis of the algorithm of class 4, the 
interaction of a gas with a real crystal lattice of nickel. For 
simplicity, we chose a channel of rectangular shape, in the 
middle section of which the gas moves with supersonic 
speed (Mach is 14), and on the periphery the gas is strongly 
retarded by the wall. In this case, we took into account the 
effect of nitrogen adsorption on the nickel surface and heat 
exchange of the gas with the wall. The calculated region in 
one of the transverse directions (y) was considered extended 
and periodic boundary conditions were used along it. This 
approximation made it possible to reduce the amount of 
computation and take the following dimensions of the 
computational domain:

 (See Figure 1). Within this region, two 
boundary layers were identified, in which the interaction of

 the gas flow

the boundary layers, the total number of metal and gas atoms 
was approximately 488 million particles. In the middle part, 
a Cartesian mesh measuring 305x10x46 was used. With this 
size of the QGD grid, the computation takes up no more than 
3% of the total computation. Therefore, the general time 
characteristics of the developed algorithm were analyzed 
below.

Let us briefly discuss the results obtained. On the whole, 
it follows from the calculations carried out that the 
developed 
numerical 
approach 
and 
its 
parallel 
implementation make it possible to solve the chosen class of 
problems. A large amount of calculations in the MD block 
allows us to use rather large configurations of computer 
systems. However, the effective use of these systems lies in 
the ways of optimizing both the source algorithm and the 
developed code. In the case of using the CPU, the 
concurrency resource is not exhausted and the efficiency of 
the generated code is quite high. When using VPU of the 
specified type, there are 2 problems: 1) the cores of these 
processors are 10-15 times weaker than the CPU cores; 2) 
the fast VPU memory has a relatively small amount. As a 
result, in order to get the maximum effect from the VPU, 
you need to take order of magnitude larger configurations 
(in this example, containing about 160 nodes or more). 
We also give some data on the simulated process. In 
accordance with the boundary value problem, the evolution 
of the jet is associated with the dissipative processes of the 
channel walls. They cause the jet to broaden with time, the 
flow rate decreases, the energy of the stream is transferred 
to the walls. This is illustrated by the distribution of the 
Mach number (Figure 4).

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK 
The presented approach, computational algorithms and 
their program implementations work and allow specifying 
the flow parameters in the required place with the required 
accuracy. 
The results are presented; they show the difference in 
performance between different computing systems when 
calculating the same problem. It should be noted that it is 
not possible to perform the calculation of one problem on 
one fixed computer system by other methods with the same 
or higher accuracy. Knowing the results of calculations for 
this approach, it is possible to form a QGD model or a 
Navier-Stokes model with a boundary layer and obtain the 
same result with the same accuracy in less time. However, 
"blindly" this can not be done. 
The prospects of this work lie in further optimizing the 
code and adapting it to new generations of CPU, VPU and 
GPU and carrying out of detailed numerical experiments. 
Future work involves expanding the database and 
analyzing the flows of various gases and liquids, as well as 
multiphase flows.
