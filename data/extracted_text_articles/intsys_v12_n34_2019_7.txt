Abstract— The visual representation of Information System 
(IS) artefacts is an important aspect of the practical 
application of visual representations. However, important and 
known visual representation principles are often undervalued, 
which could lead to decreased effectiveness in using a visual 
representation. Decision Management (DM) is one field of 
study in which stakeholders must be able to utilize visual 
notations to model business decisions and underlying business 
logic, which are executed by machines. In the current body of 
knowledge, few contributions focus on evaluating visual 
representation principles to identify the suitability of visual 
notations for stakeholders. In this paper, the Physics of 
Notations framework of Moody is operationalized and utilized 
to evaluate five different DM visual notations. The results show 
several points of improvement with regards to these visual 
notations. Furthermore, the results show the authors of DM 
visual notations that well-known visual representation 
principles need to be adequately taken into account when 
defining or modifying DM visual notations. Additionally, 
operationalization is added extending on the work of [1].

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Decisions are amongst the most important assets of an 
organization [2], and therefore should be managed 
adequately. A decision is defined as: “A conclusion that a 
business arrives at through business logic and which the 
business is interested in managing” [3]. Furthermore, 
business logic can be defined as “a collection of business 
rules, business decision tables, or executable analytic 
models to make individual business decisions” [4]. 
Examples of decisions are: 1) diagnose a specific illness a 
patient has, 2) determine the loan default risk factor for a 
specific customer, or 3) determine the maximum credit 
rating of an organization. If an organization cannot 
consistently make and execute the right decision(s), large 
risks are taken that can eventually lead to high costs, 
reputation damage, or even bankruptcy. Following the 
previous example, imagine what will happen when an MD 
makes the wrong decision continuously or a customer with a 
high-risk classification gets a low-risk classification. 
One important aspect of Decision Management (DM) is 
modelling decisions and business logic using a visual 
representation. Such visual representations are often referred 
to as notations or modelling standards. An example of a 
notation to model decisions is the Decision Modeling and 
Notation (DMN) proposed by the Object Management 
Group [3] or The Decision Model, defined by von Halle and 
Goldberg [5]. 
While empowering the semantic modelling capabilities 
of notations is desirable, notations also need to be 
cognitively effective [6]. Cognitive effectiveness, in the 
context of visual notations, refers to ‘‘the speed, ease and 
accuracy with which a representation can be processed by 
the human mind’’ [7]. Important and known visual 
representation principles are often undervalued in the design 
of visual notations, which could lead to decreased cognitive 
effectiveness [8], [9]. Furthermore, these notations are 
usually not designed with all stakeholders and their different 
expertise in mind. For example, someone who never 
modelled on the one hand (Decision modelling novice) to a 
Decision modelling expert on the other hand [7]. Modelling 
novices do have different requirements in comparison to 
users who are considered an expert [7], [10]. An expert will 
need more advanced functionalities in comparison to a 
novice, however, a novice should be able to learn the 
notation quickly to get started.  
This paper examines the cognitive effectiveness of 
current notations designed for the DM domain. As, to the 
knowledge of the authors, no earlier studies exist that focus 
on evaluating multiple DM notations. To do so, a proper 
framework to evaluate known visual representation 
principles needs to be selected.  
Several frameworks to evaluate visual notations exist, 
for example, the Cognitive Dimensions (CD) frameworks 
[11]–[13], Ontological Analysis (OA) frameworks [14], and 
the Physics of Notations (PoN) framework [7]. 
OA frameworks consist of a two-way mapping between 
the visual notation and an ontology. The interpretation 
mapping describes the mapping from the visual notation to 
the ontology and the representation mapping describes the 
inverse comparison [18], [19]. Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) 
ontology is the leading ontology and represents OA

frameworks in this study. Multiple OAs have been 
conducted on different software engineering notations, e.g., 
[20]–[23]. When conducting an OA, there should be a one-
to-one correspondence between a concept in the ontology 
and the construct in the visual notation. When this is not the 
case one or more of the following four anomalies will occur 
[18]: 1) Construct deficit exist when no construct exists 
which corresponds to a concept during this occurrence the 
notation is said to be incomplete, 2) Construct overload 
exists when a single construct can represent multiple 
concepts, 3) Construct redundancy exists when multiple 
constructs can represent a single concept, 4) Construct 
excess when a construct does not correspond to a concept. 
Ontological clear and complete notations are predicted to be 
more effective [22]. OAs evaluate the semantics of notations 
and specifically excludes aspects of visual representation, 
preferring content above form [7]. OAs cannot distinguish 
between notations with the same semantics but different 
syntax. A framework with the ability to differentiate syntax 
is preferred in the context of evaluating visual notations. 
The goal of the CD frameworks is to evaluate the 
usability of information artefacts and to serve as a guide to 
create new artefacts [11]–[13]. CD frameworks have 
theoretical and practical limitations when dealing with the 
evaluation and designing of visual notations [15]: The 
frameworks are not created specifically for visual notations, 
only as a special case (particular class of cognitive artefacts) 
[16], the dimensions are not specific enough for evaluation, 
leading to confusion or misinterpretation [16], [17], 
theoretical and empirical foundations are poorly defined 
[16], the operationalization of the dimensions is lacking, 
which makes the application subjective [16], [17], visual 
representation issues are excluded and are mainly focused 
on structure [11], evaluation is not supported, the 
dimensions only define properties and cannot be specified 
as correct or incorrect [11], [13], design is not supported due 
to the fact that the dimensions are not guidelines and 
effectiveness is left out of scope [11], [13], the general level 
of the CD frameworks excludes specific predictions [11] 
(unfalsifiable). 
Due 
to 
these 
limitations, 
the 
CD 
Frameworks do not provide a scientifically fundamental 
basis for the evaluation of DM visual notations. 
The PoN theory [7] is partly based on CD frameworks, 
which were the predominant theoretical paradigm in visual 
notations research [24]. PoN is developed and devoted to 
design, evaluate, and compare visual notations and is based 
on theory and empirical evidence obtained from different 
disciplines, such as perceptual psychology, cognitive 
psychology, cartography, graphic design, human-computer 
interfacing, linguistics, and communication theory. The PoN 
framework was specifically developed for visual notations 
compared to other frameworks which are adapted for this 
purpose [7]. Therefore, it reduces its generality but supports 
detailed prescriptions and predictions [7]. Multiple 
limitations exist for the CD frameworks and the OA 
frameworks and are developed into mitigating elements of 
the PoN framework which are the following [7]: 1) symbol-
by-symbol analysis is supported in detail, 2) principles are 
justified explicitly supported by theory and empirical 
evidence, 3) principles are defined, in detail, and 
operationalization is supported by evaluation procedures 
and metrics, 4) desirable properties of visual notations are 
defined which supports evaluation and makes comparison 
possible, 5) visual notations could be designed and 
improved by the provided prescriptive guidelines, and 6) 
predictions can be generated and empirically tested 
(falsifiable). 
Multiple studies have focused on applying the PoN 
framework for evaluating visual notations [24][25]. This 
study focusses on clarifying the criteria of operationalizing 
the PoN framework. Since we selected the PoN framework 
to evaluate DM visual notations, the following research 
question is stated: “How do the selected DM visual 
notations score with regards to the PoN framework?” 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. 
First, the theory underlying visual notations and PoN are 
elaborated upon in the background and related work. This is 
followed by the research method utilized to conduct the 
research presented in this paper. Then, the data collection 
and analysis processes are explained. Next, in the results 
section, the PoN scores for the selected visual notations are 
presented. Lastly, the paper concludes with a discussion, 
conclusions, and directions for future research. 
II. 
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
DM notations can best be categorized by their 
complexity and linguistic power. Complexity refers to the 
ease of understanding the DM notation and linguistic power 
refers to the number of results it can produce, indicating its 
richness [26]. Five different types of DM notations have 
been defined [27]: 1) labels, 2) graphical aids, 3) structured 
languages, 4) constrained natural languages, and 5) pure 
natural languages, see Fig. 1.

The PoN framework attempts to evaluate notations 
(graphical aids) based on their visual representation, as these 
are often undervalued principles. It offers nine different 
principles by which the visual representation of a notation is 
measured against. The principles are as follows [7]: 
Semiotic Clarity refers to every symbol having a one-
to-one correspondence to its referent concept. When this is 
not the case one or more of the following four anomalies 
will occur: 1) symbol redundancy occurs when multiple 
symbols can be used to represent the same concept, 2) 
symbol overload occurs when different concepts can be 
represented by the same symbol, 3) symbol excess occurs 
when symbols do not correspond to any concept, and 4) 
symbol deficit occurs when there are concepts that do not 
correspond with any symbols. 
Perceptual Discriminability refers to the ability to 
differentiate symbols based on their graphical appearance. 
This can be improved by increasing the number of graphical 
attributes a symbol represents. For example, adding colour, 
additional shapes, or text to a notation can improve the 
ability to differentiate between symbols.  
Semantic Transparency refers to the extent to which 
the meaning of a symbol can be inferred from its 
appearance. For example, an icon of a calculator 
representing a formula has a high Semantic Transparency, 
while a rectangle representing a decision has a scarce 
Semantic Transparency. 
Complexity Management refers to the ability of a 
visual notation to represent information without overloading 
the human brain [7]. The complexity our brain can handle 
can be improved by the usage of different concepts [21]. 
Modularization can be used to reduce the complexity of a 
large system by dividing it into smaller parts or making use 
of subsystems [21], [28], as shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, a 
hierarchy can be incorporated into the notation by 
representing information on different levels of detail. 
 
 
Figure 2. Example of the utilization of modularization in TDM notation [5] 
 
Cognitive Integration refers to the extent to which a 
notation enables multiple diagrams to represent a system 
without overloading the human brain. This can be supported 
by two concepts, conceptual integration and perceptual 
integration [7]. Conceptual integration can be achieved by 
providing a summary diagram as a whole or parts of the 
diagram or by contextualization, a technique where 
contextual information on each diagram is showing its 
relation to elements on other diagrams [29], [30]. Perceptual 
integration is achieved by providing navigational tools in 
the notation [31]. Commonly used navigational tools are, for 
example, lines to provide direction of the flow or a map in 
which the entire diagram is shown if only a part of the 
diagram is to be shown on the screen. 
Visual Expressiveness is defined as the number of 
visual variables used in a notation [7]. If a notation has a 
high 
number 
of 
visual 
variables, 
the 
Perceptual 
Discriminability increases, making the notation easier to 
use. Visual variables are size, brightness, colour, texture, 
shape, orientation, and text [7].  
Dual Coding refers to the use of both visual and textual 
attributes in a notation [7]. For example, the Semantic 
Transparency can be increased by adding a keyword of the 
semantic concept to the visual representation of the symbol, 
consequently achieving Dual Coding.  
Graphic Economy refers to the number of graphical 
symbols used in a notation [7]. The human brain can 
discriminate around six categories simultaneously, defining 
the limit of graphical symbols a notation should contain 
[32], [33]. There are three concepts by which excessive 
graphic complexity can be reduced: 1) reduce semantic 
complexity, 2) introduce symbol deficit, and 3) increase 
Visual Expressiveness. 
Cognitive Fit refers to the Cognitive Fit theory, which 
states 
that 
different 
methods 
of 
representation 
of 
information are suitable for different tasks and different 
audiences [7]. This can be respected by creating multiple 
visual filters for, for example, expert-novice differences or 
representational mediums [34]–[37]. 
III. 
RESEARCH METHOD 
The goal of this research is to evaluate DM visual 
notations with regards to the PoN framework [7]. When 
selecting an appropriate research method, one should take 
into account the maturity of the research domain [38]. 
Research with regards to visual notations to express 
business decisions and business logic is scarce [11]. 
Therefore, a qualitative research approach is selected as our 
research method. 
Based on the available evaluation frameworks, we 
selected the PoN framework as the most suitable regarding 
visual notation evaluation. Based on the PoN framework, 
the researchers constructed a template (see Appendix A) 
which covers the nine principles of visual notations 
indicated in [7]. Each of the nine principles consists of 
specific elements characterizing each principle, e.g., the 
principle ‘Semiotic Clarity’ has four elements of which one 
represents ‘symbol overload’. Every principle, and its 
205

containing elements, are represented by a question of 
whether the principle is present in the visual notation and, if 
present, to what extent. This is evaluated with a five-point 
Likert-scale or indicated with a percentage.  
Instead of a purely quantitative approach to evaluate the 
DM visual notations, it is more appropriate to use a mix of 
quantitative collection and analysis with qualitative thematic 
coding, as our template also aims to collect motivations of 
researchers evaluating the visual notations and fits with the 
goal of operationalizing the PoN framework. The coding of 
the evaluations for the selected visual notations consists of 
three rounds of pre-defined coding based on a template [39]. 
During the coding rounds, four researchers coded the five 
graphical aids-type notations separately from each other. 
The results of the coding rounds were compared and their 
meaning discussed among the four researchers. The process 
of data collection and analysis is described in more detail in 
the following section.  
IV. 
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS 
Before the data collection and analysis started, the 
research team needed to decide which visual notations to 
evaluate. For this study, the number of visual notations to 
evaluate was five. The DM visual notations are selected 
based on the following criteria: 1) the notation should be 
applied in practice by multiple organizations, 2) the 
documentation for the notation should be accessible to be 
able to evaluate it in detail, 3) the notations are not a related 
visual notation (e.g., family of UML) and 4) the notation 
should be a DM graphical aid type. The following five DM 
visual notations are randomly selected out of a set of 42 
visual notations fitting the previous described criterion: 
Beinformed [40], Berkeley Bridge [41], Decision Model and 
Notation (DMN) [3], The Decision Model (TDM) [5], and 
Visual Rules [42].  
The data collection for this study occurred over a period 
of two months, between March 2018 and April 2018. The 
data collection is conducted by four researchers representing 
different levels of expertise on visual notations. Two 
researchers representing the expert group (researcher 1 and 
2) and two researchers representing the novice group 
(researcher 3 and 4). Separating the coders increases the 
inter-reliability in the coding [43] and the internal validity of 
the research [44]. Besides increasing inter-reliability and 
inter validity, their position of evaluating if a visual notation 
can be utilized by an expert or novice should be evaluated as 
an actual expert or novice. The separation of being an expert 
or novice user of visual notations is based on the difference 
of years of research experience and their position in 
academia [34]–[37], [45], [46]. The most important novice-
expert differences are: novices have more difficulty in 
discriminating symbols [34], [47], novices have to 
consciously remember the meaning of a symbol [35], 
complexity affect novices more than experts, as the lack 
strategies to handle this complexity [48]. Researcher 1 is a 
lecturer and associate professor with eight years of practical 
and research experience in the field of DM; Researcher 2 is 
a PhD-candidate with six years of practical and research 
experience in the field of DM; Researcher 3 is a Master 
student with five years of practical and research experience 
in the field of DM; Researcher 4 is a Master student with 
three years of research experience in the field of DM. The 
experts have experience with visual notations and completed 
at least two or more projects in which DM models had to be 
produced to be utilized in practice and the novices had little 
to no experience in actual DM notation projects. It took the 
research team a week to gather all data required to evaluate 
the visual notations. The data consisted of webpages, client 
case documents, learning documents, meta-models, demo 
applications, and video repositories with tutorials.  
A template (included in Appendix A) is created and 
utilized by the researchers to cover the nine principles of 
Moody [7]. Every principle with each their own 
characteristics is further specified in the template with 
questions to guide the operationalization of the PoN 
framework. For each element, a five-point Likert-scale 
ranging from 1) very poor; 2) poor; 3) neutral; 4) good; 5) 
very good is used. Additionally, the value 6) Not Applicable 
(NA) could be chosen. If NA was chosen it needed to be 
further specified why. Therefore, the dataset represents a 
total of four filled-in templates for each of the five visual 
notations selected.  
The data analysis comprised three rounds of pre-defined 
coding based on the data analysis techniques described by 
Strauss & Corbin [39]. The first round of coding identifies 
the symbols and constructs of each notation, e.g., the 
different node-types as part of the BeInformed visual 
notation or the transition-types as part of DMN.

The second round of coding refines and differentiates 
concepts that are already available and code them into 
categories [49]. This coding round consisted of the 
indication of the values (using a five-point Likert-scale) for 
each visual notation together with the principles of Moody 
[7], as shown in Table I. 
The first and second coding rounds were based on 
knowledge derived from sources described earlier, however, 
the coders did not follow courses or applied the visual 
notation in practice for this specific research.  
The third and last round of coding represents the 
identification of functional categories [49]. This round

included the identification of any consistencies or 
inconsistencies (using the colour grey) within the notations 
or difference in expertise (expert/novice), as shown in Table 
I.  
The five-point Likert-scale is used to enable calculation 
of averages used for the comparison of notations, and to 
create a standard quantification mechanism for the coders to 
use during the coding of the notations. If doing any 
quantitative analysis, the Likert-scale is the most accepted 
and used scale for this purpose [50]. 
V. 
RESULTS 
In this section, the results from the data collection and 
analysis phase are shown and further discussed. The results 
include the differences in values, based on percentages or a 
five-point Likert-scale, by the coders of different expert 
levels (expert/novice). The main reason that a five-point 
Likert scale is utilized is to express the difference of the 
visual notations for each principle. Table II shows the 
average of all the analysed visual notations against the nine 
principles mentioned by Moody [7]. Further on in this 
section, the results of each PoN principle are discussed in 
detail. The average totals of the DM notations are 
influenced by the presence of excess and redundant symbols 
which is for each a minus one on the total sum before 
average calculation. Exceeding the graphic economy 
threshold of six also results in the deduction of minus one 
on the total sum before average calculation. Different 
perspectives exist between coders and therefore the 
occurrence of missing values (no value provided) exists 
during the evaluation of a notation. This results in the fact 
that missing values are possible, as shown in Tables III-VI, 
and X.

 
Semiotic Clarity  
A notation with high semiotic clarity does not have any 
Excess, Deficit, Redundant, or Overload in symbols. 
Therefore, any occurrence in this is seen as a negative (as 
shown in Table III). The Beinformed and Visual Rules 
notation have excess, and/or redundant symbols. The 
researchers identified 18.75% of the BeInformed symbols as 
Excess and Redundant, as shown in Table III. The Visual 
Rules notation was identified with a 7.69% Excess in 
symbols.

An example of a notation with high Semiotic Clarity is 
Berkeley Bridge as shown in Figure 3; the Berkeley Bridge 
notation only consists of two symbols.

 
Perceptual Discriminability  
Perceptual Dscriminability covers the use of text, icons, 
and visual spacing, in order to stimulate faster identification 
of the different symbols. Therefore, a higher value is an 
indication that the notation has a high perceptual 
discriminability and thereby consists of symbols that are 
identified faster. The BeInformed notation with a 3.06 (as 
shown in Fig. 4) has the highest Perceptual Discriminability 
of the analyzed notations, compared to the DMN notation 
with a 1.50 (lowest). Fig. 4 shows the comparison of the 
Product, Decision, and Condition symbols used in 
BeInformed [40] showing the discriminability between the 
symbols of BeInformed by using text and icons.

 
Semantic Transparency  
Semantic Transparency covers if the visual appearance 
of the symbols suggests their meaning. A higher value in 
this principle is an indication that the notation seems to have 
semantic transparent symbols. The Berkeley Bridge notation 
has the highest Semantic Transparency (as shown in Fig. 5) 
with a 4.4. This seems the result of the low number of 
symbols, which is two. The BeInformed (as shown in Fig.5) 
notation seems to be affected by its high number of 
symbols, and therefore BeInformed is together with Visual 
Rules then notation with the lowest Semantic Transparency 
(BeInformed 2.88, and Visual Rules 2.71).

 
Complexity Management  
The Complexity Management principle covers the 
ability to scale the notation for a clearer overview for the 
user. A higher value in this principle is an indication that the 
notation is useful with regards to larger systems with 
multiple 
diagrams 
by 
utilizing 
modularization 
and 
hierarchical structuring. The BeInformed notation has the 
highest value (4.17) in Complexity Management and is 
better when dealing with large scale systems with multiple 
diagrams. The TDM notation seems to be impacted by the

(2.17) in Complexity Management. The coding of the

 
Visual Expressiveness  
The Visual Expressiveness principle covers the use of 
visual variables (colour, 3d symbols, and textual encoding). 
A higher value indicates that the notations are visually 
expressive. The TDM notation has a total score of 4.5 and 
thereby 
he 
highest-scoring 
notation 
in 
Visual 
Expressiveness, compared to the Berkeley Bridge notation 
with a 1.5 (lowest). The coding of the Visual 
Expressiveness of TDM is shown in Table VII.

 
Graphic Economy 
The Graphic Economy principle covers the number of 
symbols a human brain is able to discriminate between, this 
number is estimated to be limited to six. A value above six 
would be a negative impact on the Graphic Economy of the 
notation, which is the case for BeInformed (16), Visual 
Rules (13), and DMN (9). The coding of the Graphic 
Economy of BeInformed is shown in Table VIII.

 
Dual Coding  
The Dual Coding principle covers the complement of 
graphics with text, which is more effective than using each 
of them on their own. A higher value in this principle 
indicates that the notation utilizes Dual Coding. The 
Beinformed (4.25) and Visual Rules (4.00) notations are the 
only notations, out of the analyzed five notations, where 
Dual Coding was identified. The coding of the Dual Coding 
of BeInformed is shown in Table IX.

 
Cognitive Fit  
The Cognitive Fit principle covers the theory that 
different representations of information are suitable for 
different audiences. The difference in experience between 
coders is utilized and classified as expert (R1 and R2) and 
novice (R3 and R4). The expert and novice coders stated 
from their experience perspective if there is an expert-
novice difference and to what extent (as shown in Table X). 
The Visual Rules notation scored the lowest with a 2.25, 
compared to that of TDM, which scored the highest with a 
4.50. The coding of the Cognitive Fit of Visual Rules is 
shown in Table X.

for experts and novices to be utilized.

 
Cognitive Integration  
The Cognitive Integration principle covers the range of 
mechanisms available for dealing with multiple diagrams 
thereby, helping the reader assemble information from 
separate diagrams. Concepts supporting are Conceptual 
Integration (e.g., a summary diagram) and Perceptual 
Integration (e.g., navigational tools). A higher value 
indicates that the notation has the mechanisms available to 
help the reader assemble information when multiple 
diagrams are shown. The Visual Rules notation (as shown in 
Fig. 10) has the highest value (3.83) in Cognitive 
Integration, compared to the Berkeley Bridge (as shown in 
Fig. 10) notation (1.92) which does not have the 
mechanisms to support the reader when dealing with 
separate diagrams (lowest).

Taking into account that having experience in the use of 
a visual notation, in this case, a modelling language, 
influences the attitude towards several of the Moody 
principles. For example, a notation could be more complex 
for a novice but not for an expert. Therefore, a difference is 
made between the results of the expert researchers and 
novice researchers. The coding of the difference between

CONCLUSION, DISCUSSION AND FUTURE 
RESEARCH 
In this paper, a study is conducted in which five DM 
visual notations, namely: Visual Rules, Berkeley Bridge, 
Decision Model and Notation, The Decision Model, and 
BeInformed, were evaluated using the PoN framework [7]. 
From our analysis, Visual Rules scores best according to the 
average total of all PoN framework principles. From a 
theoretical perspective, our study and its results give 
meaning to the operationalization of the PoN framework. 
Furthermore, it will enable further exploration of the 
application of the PoN principles, as well as other DM 
visual notations not included in this study. Moody [1, p.772] 
describes the theoretical interactions between the described 
principles. Our results show that these interactions are, to a 
large extent, verified. From a practical perspective, the 
results presented in this paper contribute towards a better 
awareness for taking into account validated visual notation 
principles and guidelines. Our results could be utilized by 
organizations to either evaluate for themselves which visual 
notation is most adequate or to utilize a visual notation 
based on our results. 
This study has multiple limitations. The first limitation 
concerns the research team that carried out the evaluation of 
the visual notations using the PoN framework. This study 
included evaluations of four researchers, two novice level 
researchers and two expert-level researchers on the DM 
topic. Therefore, one could argue that the results and 
conclusions are potentially biased by a low amount of data 
points for the evaluation of the visual notations included. 
However, most studies conducted with a focus on evaluating 
one or multiple visual notations are often centred on the 
evaluation of the visual notation using one or two 
researchers [24], [25], [51]. Future research should focus on 
evaluating visual notations utilizing a larger sample of 
participants that will add to the generalizability of the results 
and conclusions about the evaluated visual notations. 
The second limitation concerns the method and 
framework utilized to evaluate the visual notations, the PoN 
framework and its operationalization by creating and 
utilizing a template with the goal to structure data collection 
and analysis. Utilizing the PoN framework is an explicit 
choice, however, limits the results because the PoN 
framework represents a specific lens. Future research could, 
therefore, focus on applying other frameworks and theories 
that focus on uncovering and describing essential notational 
principles, e.g., Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) [52]. 
Furthermore, the operationalization of the PoN framework 
described in [7] is left open for interpretation and perception 
of the researchers applying it, a good example is the lack of 
weighting of the nine PoN principles. Therefore, our 
template is another limitation. This phenomenon becomes 
clear in the work of [6], which shows that the 
operationalization of the PoN framework by different 
research teams often do not always seem to take into 
account all principles described. This is tackled by utilizing 
the created template in this study, see Appendix A. Future 
research, however, should focus on how these principles are 
best measured in practice, i.e., whether Likert scales or other 
less quantitative measurements are adequate or not. A first 
step is taken with the addition of user scenarios to support 
the operationalization of the PoN framework.  
The last limitation concerns the visual notations 
selected. Although we choose two well-known visual 
notations, as well as three visual notations applied in the 
DM practice a lot, the selection of visual notations could 
210

coincidentally have resulted in bias and affect the 
generalizability of our results. We argue that this risk is 
more or less mitigated as most studies conducted that utilize 
the PoN framework focus on only one visual notation, see 
also [6], while this study reports upon the evaluation of five 
visual notations. Future research could also focus on 
evaluating additional DM visual notations.

APPENDIX A – TEMPLATE CHECKLIST GRAPHICAL NOTATIONS 
 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
This is the template for the checklist. The checklist is based on the theory of "The Physics of Notations" [7]. Therefore, 
before using this template it is required to have read "The Physics of Notations" [7] paper. The structure of this document is 
derived from the following figure: 
 
Figure 1 - The Physics of Notations [7] 
 
In addition, this template makes use of a five-point scale for the assessment of the properties of the notations, wherein the 
numeral 1= very poor, 2=poor, 3= poor/good, 4=good, and 5=very good. Some concepts start with a question if the concept 
occurs in the notation, these questions should be answered with yes or no. If the answer is yes, the 5-point Likert scale should 
be applied. 
At the end of the document, we inserted a section named “Additional notes”. In this section you can provide us extra 
information besides the information needed by the template about the notation. 
II. 
SEMIOTIC CLARITY 
According to Goodman’s theory of symbols, for a notation to satisfy the requirements of a notational system, there must be a 
one-to-one correspondence between symbols and their referent concepts. When there is not a one-to-one correspondence 
between constructs and symbols, one or more of the following anomalies can occur: 
 
Symbol excess occurs when graphical symbols do not correspond to any semantic construct. 
 
Symbol deficit occurs when there are semantic constructs that are not represented by any graphical 
symbol. 
 
Symbol redundancy occurs when multiple graphical symbols can be used to represent the same semantic 
construct. 
 
Symbol overload occurs when two different constructs can be represented by the same graphical symbol. 
 
Step 1: List all the symbols used by the notation.

 
Symbol deficit occurs when there are semantic constructs that are not represented by any graphical 
symbol. 
 
Symbol redundancy occurs when multiple graphical symbols can be used to represent the same semantic 
construct. 
 
Symbol overload occurs when two different constructs can be represented by the same graphical symbol.

PERCEPTUAL DISCRIMINABILITY 
Perceptual discriminability is the ease and accuracy with which graphical symbols can be differentiated from each other. This 
relates to the first phase of human visual information processing: perceptual discrimination. Accurate discrimination between 
symbols is a prerequisite for accurate interpretation of diagrams. 
To describe the notation’s score for this principle, perform the following step(s): 
 
Step 1: Gather the visual variables per symbol. 
Describe the symbols VV’s (Visual Variables) in the following table(s).

A. 
Redundant coding 
Redundancy is an important technique in communication theory to reduce errors and counteract noise. The visual distance 
between symbols can be increased by redundant coding: using multiple visual variables to distinguish between them. As an 
example, colour could be used to improve discriminability between entities and relationships in ER diagrams

Perceptual popout 
According to feature integration theory, visual elements with unique values for at least one visual variable can be detected 
pre-attentively and in parallel across the visual field. Such elements appear to “pop-out” from a display without conscious 
effort. On the other hand, visual elements that are differentiated by unique combinations of values (conjunctions) require 
serial search, which is much slower and error-prone.

Textual differentiation 
SE notations sometimes rely on text to distinguish between symbols. For example, UML frequently uses text and typographic 
characteristics (bold, italics, underlining) to distinguish between element and relationship types.

Iconic differentiation 
Icons are symbols that perceptually resemble the concepts they represent. This reflects a basic distinction in semiotics, 
between symbolic and iconic signs. Iconic representations speed up recognition and recall and improve intelligibility of 
diagrams to naïve users. They also make diagrams more accessible to novices: a representation composed of pictures appears 
less daunting than one composed of abstract symbols. Finally, they make diagrams more visually appealing: people prefer 
real objects to abstract shapes.

SEMANTICS TRANSPARENCY 
Semantic Transparency is defined as the extent to which the meaning of a symbol can be inferred from its appearance. While 
Perceptual Discriminability simply requires that symbols should be different from each other, this principle requires that they 
provide cues to their meaning (form implies content). The concept of Semantic Transparency formalizes informal notions of 
“naturalness” or “intuitiveness” that are often used when discussing visual notations, as it can be evaluated experimentally. 
To describe the notation’s score for this principle, perform the following step(s):

COMPLEXITY MANAGEMENT 
Complexity Management refers to the ability of a visual notation to represent information without overloading the human 
mind. Complexity is also one of the defining characteristics of the SE field, where complexity levels exceed those in any 
other discipline. 
To describe the notation’s score for this principle, perform the following step(s): 
A. 
Modularization 
The most common way of reducing complexity of large systems is to divide them into smaller parts or subsystems: this is 
called modularization.

Hierarchically structuring 
Hierarchy is one of the most effective ways of organizing complexity for human comprehension as it allows systems to be 
represented at different levels of detail, with complexity manageable at each level. This supports top-down understanding, 
which has been shown to improve understanding of SE diagrams.

Visual Expressiveness is defined as the number of visual variables used in a notation. This measures utilisation of the graphic 
design space.

To describe the notation’s score for this principle, perform the following step(s):

VIII. 
DUAL CODING 
Perceptual Discriminability and Visual Expressiveness both advise against using text to encode information in visual 
notations. However, this does not mean that text has no place in visual notation design. Pictures and words are not enemies 
and should not be mutually exclusive. According to Dual Coding theory, using text and graphics together to convey 
information is more effective than using either on their own. Textual encoding can be used to reinforce and expand the 
meaning of graphical symbols, as shown in the figure below. 
 
To describe the notation’s score for this principle, perform the following step(s): 
 
Step 1: Determining the possibilities of Dual Coding.

COGNITIVE FIT 
Cognitive Fit theory states that different representations of information are suitable for different tasks and different audiences. 
Problem-solving performance (which corresponds roughly to cognitive effectiveness) is determined by a three-way fit 
between the problem representation, task characteristics and problem solver skills. 
To describe the notation’s score for this principle, perform the following step(s): 
A. 
Expert-novice differences 
One of the major challenges in designing SE notations is the need to develop representations that are understandable by both 
business and technical experts. This adds to the difficulty of the task as in most engineering contexts, diagrams are only used 
to communicate among experts.

B. 
Representational medium 
Another situation that may require different visual dialects is different representational media. In particular, requirements for 
sketching on whiteboards or paper (an important use of visual notations in early design stages), are different to those for 
using computer-based drawing tools. Some of the most important differences are:  
Perceptual Discriminability: discriminability requirements are higher due to variations in how symbols are drawn by 
different people. As within-symbol variations increase, between-symbol differences need to be more pronounced. 
Semantic Transparency: pictures and icons are more difficult to draw than simple geometric shapes, especially for the 
artistically challenged. 
Visual Expressiveness: some visual variables (colour, value and texture) are more difficult to use (due to limited drawing 
ability and availability of equipment e.g., colour pens). 
 
 
Step 1: Determining the difficulty of transferring information between users in the notation’s language. 
Describe the possibilities (and difficulty) regarding the notation as a representational medium in the 
following table(s).

COGNITIVE INTEGRATION 
Cognitive Integration only applies when multiple diagrams are used to represent a system. This is a critical issue in SE, where 
problems are typically represented by systems of diagrams rather than single diagrams. It applies equally to diagrams of the 
same type (homogeneous integration) – for example, a set of levelled DFDs – or diagrams of different types (heterogeneous 
integration) – for example, a suite of UML diagrams or ArchiMate views. 
To describe the notation’s score for this principle, perform the following step(s): 
A. 
 Perceptual integration 
Perceptual integration: perceptual cues to simplify navigation and transitions between diagrams. There are a range of 
mechanisms that can be used to support perceptual integration, which draw on the design of physical spaces (urban planning), 
virtual spaces (HCI) and graphical spaces(cartography and information visualization). Whether navigating around a city, a 
website, an atlas, or a set of diagrams, wayfinding follows the same four stages: 
 
 
Orientation: where am I?  
 
Route choice: where can I go 
 
Route monitoring: am I on the right path?  
 
Destination recognition: am I there yet? 
Step 1: Determining the perceptual integration.

B. 
 Conceptual integration 
Conceptual integration: mechanisms to help the reader assemble information from separate diagrams into a coherent mental 
representation of the system. One important mechanism to support conceptual integration is a summary (longshot) diagram, 
which provides a view of the system as a whole.
