Abstract—Spectrum detection is the prerequisite for the 
Cognitive Radio. Energy detection is often used to sense the 
spectrum hole in Cognitive Radio network, and the threshold 
plays a vital role. In this paper, a method of setting threshold is 
proposed. In the low SNR environment, to protect the primary 
user, each secondary user observes the environment adaptively 
and then sets the threshold independently. The simulation 
results prove that, under the method proposed in this paper, 
the detection performance can be greatly improved, comparing 
with the traditional one, i.e., the threshold is set by the 
spectrum broker and all the secondary users have a same fixed 
threshold.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, with the rapid development of radio 
services, more and more wireless spectrum resources are 
needed to meet the communication requirements. However, 
because of the fixed spectrum allocation scheme and the 
spectrum monopolized principle, the spectrum resources are 
believed to be scarce resources. Although there are some 
measures such as Frequency Division Multipexing (FDM), 
Time 
Division 
Multipexing 
(TDM), 
Code 
Division 
Multiplexing (CDM), etc., to improve the spectrum 
utilization, but these can not ultimately solve the lack of 
spectrum resources. As a result, the technology of Cognitive 
Radio (CR) emerges as the times require. It proposes a 
opportunists way to share the frequency spectrum, under the 
premise of not disturbing PU. This method can open the 
spectrum resources and improve spectrum utilization 
effectively. 
The core ideology of CR is that the unlicensed user 
(secondary user, SU) senses the radio environment 
automatically, adjusts the system parameters intelligently to 
adapt to the changes in the environment, and uses idle 
spectrum resources to do some communications without 
disturbing licensed user (primary user, PU). Therefore, idle 
spectrum sensing is a critical task for CR networks [1][2].  
There have been many kinds of classic spectrum sensing 
technologies, such as energy detection, match filter detection 
and cyclic-feature detection. However, energy detection is 
the most commonly used method to estimate if there are any 
PUs, because of its simple and practical operation. 
In the actual communication environments, there are 
shadowing, fading and other adverse factors which would 
greatly deteriorate the SU’s local decisions. So, the 
cooperative spectrum sensing is always used in CR network 
to improve the detection performance, that is, on the base of 
local detection, all the SUs transmit their local decisions to 
the spectrum broker through error-free channels, the 
spectrum broker analyses these data and makes the final 
decision.  
In energy detection, how to set the threshold is very 
crucial, as the threshold would influence the local decision of 
SU, and then influence the performance of the system. There 
have been some studies about how to set the threshold in 
energy detection [3-7]. In [3], the authors, combining with 
cooperative sensing, proposed a method to determine the 
threshold, and the proposed optimal threshold which is 
decided by spectrum broker minimizes the probability of 
global error. However, this threshold is not the best one for 
various SUs who are in different environments. In [4], the 
authors, combining with the K/N voting rule, discussed the 
optimal threshold. Depending on K, they only proposed the 
range of the threshold instead of the exact value. In [5], a 
tradeoff threshold is proposed, and when the system has a 
higher requirment of protecting PU, it will set an actual value 
which is higher than the proposed optimal one to obtain a 
higher detection probability. In [6], the authors suggested a 
double-threshold based energy sensing algorithm to improve 
the performance of the local detection. Under the restriction 
of the two thresholds, the results of local detection can be 
more credible, but the authors only considered that all the 
SUs sensed the idle spectrum over Additive White Gaussian 
Noise (AWGN) channels, and not taken the fading channels 
into account. However, in [7], the authors provided a method 
about how to set a double-threshold in fading channel, and 
the simulation results proved that the double-threshold 
proposed can improve the sensing performance. 
The detection thresholds mentioned above are all set by 
the spectrum broker, the spectrum broker bases on some 
rules to set the threshold uniformly and then distributes it to 
every SU, each SU, who takes part in cooperation owns a 
same threshold. However, SUs are in different environments, 
and they catch PU signals of different intensity. Those ways 
mentioned above did not take this problem into 
consideration, but generalized, Thus, all the SUs had a same 
threshold, which wound reduce the local detection 
performance.

In this paper, in order to protect the interests of PU in 
the low SNR environments, a threshold setting way to 
improve the performance of local energy detection is 
proposed. 
SUs 
monitor 
and 
estimate 
their 
radio 
environments, and then set their own optimal thresholds 
independently. This optimal one maximizes the difference 
of SU’s the local detection probability and the local false-
alarm probability. That is to say, in this way, the system 
protects the interests of PU to greatest extent, when it allows 
SUs to share the spectrum resource. The simulation results 
prove that this method of setting threshold improves the 
performance of detection significantly, comparing with the 
traditional method, i.e., the threshold is set by the spectrum 
broker and all the SUs have a same fixed detection threshold. 
In addition, the SUs do not need to transmit their signal-to-
noise (SNR) radio and some other reliable information to 
the spectrum broker, so it is also an effective way to save 
the sensing time and the channel bandwidth. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The 
energy detection is introduced in Section Ⅱ. The issue 
about setting threshold uniformly is discussed in Section Ⅲ. 
The new distributed setting threshold method is described in 
Section Ⅳ. Simulation results, conclusion and future work 
are given in Section Ⅴ and Section Ⅵ, respectively.

estimate if there are any PUs, because of its simple and 
practical operation.

sensing channel. The SU lets  
y t  pass the bandpass filter 
(BPF) to filter the out-of-band noise and adjacent signals, 
and then pass the A/D converter, the squarer and the 
summation device, then the test statistic Y  is obtained [2]:

where   is the instantaneous SNR at the secondary node, 
TW  is the product of observation time and interested 
bandwidth, it is usually written as m
TW
, and m  is an 
integer. As shown in (2)，when PU is absent, Y obeys the 
central chi-square distribution with 2TW  degrees of 
freedom, when the PU is present, Y obeys the noncentral 
chi-square distribution with 2TW  degrees of freedom and a 
non-centrality parameter 2 . 
Letting Y  compare to a pre-set threshold  , SU can 
decide whether PU is present or not. If Y  is bigger than the 
threshold  , then SU makes the judgment that PU is 
working, otherwise, SU believes PU do not occupy this 
licensed band, and then uses it to do some its own 
communications. Thus, how to select the threshold is very 
critical and it influences the local decision of SU 
immediately, thereby, influences the performance of the 
system. 
In an AWGN environment where the complex channel 
gain

In the actual communication environments, fading and 
shadowing, etc., would deteriorate the local spectrum sensing 
performance of the SU, so, multiple SUs are needed to sense 
the idle spectrum cooperatively, that is the cooperative 
spectrum sensing. In cooperative spectrum sensing, each SU 
who takes part in collaboration makes a binary judgment 
according to the local observation (0 or 1, 0 stands for the 
absence of PU, and 1 stands for the existence of PU), and 
then sends the decision to the spectrum broker through ideal 
channels, the spectrum broker applies the classic K/N voting 
rule (when K=N, the rule is the AND rule; when K=1, the 
rule is OR rule) to fuse all the results, and then makes the 
final decision [2]:

III. 
THE ISSUE ABOUT SETTING THRESHOLD UNIFORMLY 
BY SPECTRUM BROKER 
How to set the threshold in energy detection is very 
critical. The threshold can influence the false-alarm 
probability and the detection probability at the same time, 
when it is set too high, the false-alarm probability would 
reduce and so does the detection probability. The decrease of 
the false-alarm probability would increase the radio 
frequency spectrum utilization, but the decrease of the 
detection probability would increase the probability of 
disturbing PU.  
As shown in Figure 1, SU1, SU2 and SU3 are all affected 
by shadowing; SU4 is out of the coverage of the PU 
transmitter. They can not capture the PU signal no matter it 
exists or not, and then, they may make error decisions. 
Although collaborative spectrum sensing can be applied to 
ameliorate the performance, but the authors of [8] have 
proved that collaborative spectrum sensing can do little 
improvement to the performance in the case that secondary 
nodes are all in harsh environments. In some low SNR 
environments, SUs would be easy to interfere PU, but the 
precondition of CR network is that SUs share the spectrum 
resources without bothering PU. So, In some low SNR 
environments, especially, in some systems which need to put 
the interests of PU to the first place, more attention must be 
paid to protect the interests of PU. 
In [3], the authors based on collaborative spectrum 
sensing, and proposed a method to set the threshold of 
energy detection. In that way, the threshold (
*
 ) minimizes 
the total error probability (the sum of the missed detection 
probability and the false-alarm probability). Shown as the 
following equations:

Six SUs are assumed to join in the collaborative 
spectrum sensing, and their SNR are -10dB, -5dB, -3dB, -
1dB, 0dB, 1dB respectively, the OR rule is applied to fuse 
data at the spectrum broker. Letting threshold be the 
abscissa, the difference of the detection probability and the 
false-alarm probability (
Qdiff
) be the ordinate, the 
simulation figure about the relationship between the 
threshold and the difference of detection probability and 
false-alarm probability can be obtained, shown as Figure 2. 
From Figure 2, it is easy to see that the difference of the 
detection probability and the false-alarm probability varies 
with the threshold, and a optimal one (
*
), which 
maximizes the difference of the detection probability and 
the false-alarm probability can be obtained. That is to say, 
according to [3], when the SUs who take part in cooperation 
all let 
*
  be their threshold of energy detection, it would 
provide the uttermost protection of PU, comparing with 
some other threshold setting methods.  
However, because of the adverse factors such as 
interference, noise and temperature, the SUs who join in 
cooperation are in different environments. The threshold 
mentioned in [3] is set by spectrum broker, and then the 
spectrum broker distributed it to SUs uniformly, but this 
threshold is not the optimal one to each SU who is with

different SNR.So, in order to provide better protection to 
PU, SUs according to their environments, set their own 
thresholds by maximizing the difference of the detection 
probability and the false-alarm probability [9], and then 
make their own optimal decisions independently, that is the 
distributed setting threshold algorithm. In some harsh 
environments, this distributed setting threshold method can 
improve the detection probability, and then achieve the 
purpose of protecting PU. 
IV. 
THE NEW DISTRIBUTED SETTING THRESHOLD 
METHOD 
We will present the new distributed setting threshold 
method. 
A. The Setting Threshold Method 
The following gives a method to set the threshold of 
energy detection. SUs set their own thresholds according to 
their environments, and then make their own optimal 
decisions independently, after that, transmit their decisions to 
the spectrum broker to complete collaborative spectrum 
sensing. If the distributed setting threshold method is applied, 
SUs do not need to convey the SNR and some other reliable 
informations to the spectrum broker in advance [9][10], and 
do not need to wait for the uniform fixed threshold which is 
made by the spectrum broker to finish the energy detection. 
Obviously, this method can not only save the sensing time, 
but the bandwidth, more importantly, it can improve the 
system detection probability, reduce the risk of disturbing 
PU. 
The number of secondary users who participate in 
collaborative spectrum sensing is N , the SNR of i th SU is 
assumed to be

B. Performance Analyse  
SUs set their own thresholds independently according to 
their environments, and then make their own optimal 
decisions independently, after that, transmit their decisions to 
spectrum broker to complete collaborative spectrum 
detection. Because the issue we study is how to set the 
threshold to achieve the goal, and the goal is that we not only 
allow SUs to share spectrum resources, but protect the 
interests of PU as far as possible. So we apply the OR rule to

fuse data in spectrum broker, and devote to improve the 
probability of detection. 
If the SNR of each SU is assumed to be a instantaneous 
value, and SUs use the independent setting threshold method 
to complete energy detection, the system detection

SIMULATION RESULTS 
The number of the SUs who participate in collaborative 
spectrum sensing is assumed to be 
N 6
, and the 
simulations are did to compare the unified setting threshold 
method in [3] with the distributed setting threshold method 
(the algorithm mentioned in this paper) over 10 kinds of 
environments (the average SNR is -5dB，-4dB，-3dB，-
2dB，-1dB，0dB，1dB，2dB，3dB，4dB respectively). 
The relationships of their system detection probability are 
shown as Figure 3，Figure 4 and Figure 5.  
Figure 3 shows the relationship between the system 
detection probability and the average SNR under the two 
methods. From Figure 3, under the distributed setting 
threshold method, the system detection probability is 
improved significantly, that is to say, the method proposed in

Figure 3.  Considering the instantaneous signal-to-noise, the relationship 
between global detection probability and the average signal-to-noise 
this paper can provide better protection to PU system, 
comparing with the unified setting threshold method. 
Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the simulations over 
Rayleigh channel and additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) 
channel respectively. Form the figures, the distributed setting 
threshold method proposed in this paper is equally applicable 
to the Rayleigh channel and AWGN channel, this method 
can also improve the system detection probability, reduce the 
risk of bothering PU, and achieve the goal of protecting PU.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
When all the SUs are in low SNR environments, 
collaborative spectrum sensing can do little improvement to 
the performance of the system, in this case, we should 
devote to improve the local detection performance of SU, 
and then improve the global detection performance. In this 
paper, each SU according to its environment sets the most 
suitable threshold independently, and then makes the 
optimal local decision. The simulation results prove that, 
under the method proposed in this paper, the local detection

Figure 5.  Over AWGN channel, the relationship between global detection 
probability and the average signal-to-noise 
probability is improved, after collaborative detection, the 
system detection probability is improved too; so, the risk of 
disturbing PU is reduced. In future work, we will devote to 
find a more effective way to improve the detection 
performance of system.
