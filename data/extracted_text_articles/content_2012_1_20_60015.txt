Abstract— In fields of community and relationship analysis for 
online social medium, there are lots of researches focusing on 
interest detection and similarity. From those we know people 
are similar in some interests, but do not know why. Among 
conventional studies, personal profile information (explicit 
data) is often the main foundation to analyze. However it may 
occur inconsistency between a real fact and subjective 
information written by users. Thus, we think objective 
information and potential factor are essential to help us to 
understand the real conditions and progress in the future. So 
that we proposed a novel model and proposed methods to 
construct resonance-relationship network with behavioral 
pattern analysis and coordinate opinion analysis. We leverage 
interactive and time-varying data to extract resonance-
relationship, and model the distribution of interactions. Finally, 
we showed our observation and result, and explained an actual 
situation with photography in case study. In summary, we 
proposed a novel model to analyze and solve potential 
problems for online social relationships.  
Keywords-resonance-relationship;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays, the explicit and implicit data analyses of 
social community and social relationship are used to mine 
hidden information, such as the mutual interests between 
users. The explicit data includes raw text or tag presented in 
personal profile that is always wrote by users themselves. 
However, the implicit data was implied in users‟ behaviors . 
In the previous modeling studies, behaviors of browse and 
click on webpage are discussed [3, 4] mostly, and then 
behaviors are used to analyze user interests. Then, similarity 
of interests between two nodes are computed. The goal of 
this kind studies is to improve quality of personal service in 
networks, 
there 
are 
lots 
of 
applications 
such 
as 
recommendation system and matching system. 
Online social networks have become more popular 
because of the blog prevailing. Some traditional methods 
may have been in deficiency gradually. Firstly, we perceive 
some important information in each personal profile, which 
is the main foundation to determine user‟s affinity.  We 
expect an objective fact instead of personal subjective 
opinion; however, if the information includes too much 
subjective opinion, the inconsistency between fact and the 
information users wrote might occur. In some scenarios, we 
prefer objective facts, but the results happened via personal 
profile would not suit our requirements. Therefore, we 
proposed a method of analyzing interactive information 
based on online social platform, and expected to provide 
objective information.  
Secondly, past studies in detecting users‟ interests 
realized people come together due to similarity of interests [9, 
10], but they did not know why people got high similarity 
score in these fields (interests). In fact, people come together 
not only the similar interests but also other reasons. For 
example, people are curious about different characteristics, 
reliable comments, meeting frequently, and so on. In short, 
we think there are some key causes to make people come 
together, so that we made attempt on this study. 
In the following section, we will give the detail 
explanation, definition and comparison. Section 2 reviews 
the literature on user behavior modeling in OSNs (online 
social networks), semantic orientation analysis, social 
relationship discovery and matching systems. Section 3 
details the model and the procedure that we proposed 
method/algorithm. Section 4 discuss the results of our 
experiment and explain by case study, and finally conclude 
this paper and give a future work.

RELATED WORK 
A. User Behavior Modeling 
A number of studies observing properties of online social 
networks recently, and now most people are inseparable 
from the social networks. So, how do we understand the 
implicit information in the social medium is an important 
task. Based on this concept, there are two key issues [1] 
addressed for the measurements: characterization of user 
activities and usage patterns. This paper proposed a question: 
the information of user interaction is really an indicator of 
analysis on OSNs? Due to the motivation they try to quantify 
their observing factor and verify their assumption [2]. In 
order to characterize user behavior in online social network, 
the methodologies proposed to identify different classes of 
user behavior by evaluating the feature vector, which they 
defined [3] and analyze the user workloads in different 
online social networks to get the usage patterns [4]. 
Moreover, feature selection is also significant, because 
concept drift [5] is often caused by poor feature selection. 
Therefore, major studies chose the key impacting factors

cautiously by modeling extracted features and coefficient of 
variation. 
B. Social Relationship and Matching 
In the field of community analysis, a part of researches 
aimed at discovering hidden information and relation. In a 
study, two algorithms were designed by the original concept 
of feature extraction to accomplish relation extraction [6]. 
Regression-based algorithm is suitable when a user provides 
multiple community examples, but MinCut-based algorithm 
is suitable when a user provides single community example 
[6]. 
The applications of social matching system are often 
online social website and applications in some well-known 
social networks, such as iPartment [7] of Taiwan, Australia 
online dating website, RSVP [8] and so on. However, the 
conventional matching processes are almost according to 
users‟ profile and some questionnaires, which are all fixed 
fields for choose; the matching process of applications in 
some well-known social networks is providing the mutual 
friends between two users. [9] That study did matching 
process based on the personal information and their 
preferable conditions written in RSVP. The method 
classified users into several groups and matched male 
groups and female groups according to which male personal 
conditions are corresponding to female preferences. In 
addition, a social matching model was proposed [10] based 
in Twitter, they first detected personal information and 
interests, and then identify the user and his/her knowledge. 
Finally, they calculate similarity of interests between users 
then recommend. Another kind matching is recommending 
items, and then evolutionary computing method [11] is also 
used to improve the traditional methods in recommendation 
system. 
Modularity [12] is common in evaluation of community 
analysis. It is an index to evaluate strength of a community 
(group), so that it is often used to partition a whole network 
into several groups. And it is used to understand intensity of 
one community or group according to the adjacent matrix 
and expectation value of degrees in a network (graph). 
Recently, Lu et al. [13] proposed a novel framework to 
evaluate user’s condition in online social networks. It 
contains three parts, people rank, social rank, relationship 
weight individually. 
III. 
OUR MODEL 
The core issue we researched for online social medium is 
to understand the hidden relationship, called resonance-
relationship, and then construct a resonance network. We 
give this phrase a definition: people have a) coordinate 
opinions and b) enthusiasms for some themes. 
Here, we mined referable user‟s opinion and potential 
tendentiousness by their posts and comments, and then 
regarded enthusiasms as the degree of participation. 
However, in order to target the potential users, we carry out 
“Active Cluster Detection” first. The overall framework is 
shown as Figure 1. 
We believe this study will be in favor of future applications 
development. 
A. Environment 
This study is based on online social platform: Facebook 
[14]. We collected data from fanspages in Facebook, where 
could obtain enough large amount of raw data. Each 
fanspage has specific theme, it is a platform for online users 
to exchange ideas. 
We try to solve a problem that the raw data in Facebook 
is miscellaneous. We assume condition of our environment: 
“we know there are some hot topics in one theme”, because 
the goal of our research is resonance-relationship based on 
themes and topics. In addition, we need a terminology 
database in the coordinate opinion model beforehand, here 
we set “photography” as our query text, the terminology 
database is obtained from PHOTOGRAPHYTIPS.COM™ 
[15]. We retrieved data includes theme title, posts, 
comments and the corresponding behaviors by each user. 
See the example as Figure 2.

B. Active Cluster Detection 
After data collection, we proceed to detect active cluster 
(AC) in a theme. Since there is one kind of people called 
“flash mob”, which means they just come and appear one 
time and exit rapidly, they do not attend interactions in at all. 
Here, we leveraged interactive information to achieve our 
goal that is finding the potential users.  
The challenge is that some users are aggressive to 
express their views but some users are relative passive to 
interact, so that we probe the problem for two parts. We 
assume the users are positivity if they post actively, users 
just comment or do other actions occasionally passively, so 
that we think they are relative inactive and they always need 
someone to lead their opinion. We sought out active users 
preferentially, and next discovered passive users by setting a 
threshold. The model is presented as (1), where PT is the 
function to gather statistics in theme k, surf is the function 
to calculate attending ratio in topics of theme k, and AC(ui) 
is the function to determine whether ui active is. We will 
compute post-times (PT) and visiting ratio (surf) by raw 
data. Here,   is a Boolean value, then   and   are 
control parameters. We set   value 0.5.   is equal to m 
multiplied by acting times.

C. Coordinate opinion Analysis 
In level of opinion orientation analysis, our goal is to 
analysis and determine the potential users‟ level of comment 
orientation in specific topics. The algorithm is shown as 
Figure 3. Firstly, word and phrase are mentioned by a user 
in the specific topic  then we look them up in the 
terminology database. In Figure 3, Line5 to Line8 are 
claclulated the factoring value of a specific theme. Line10 is 
the process to decide users‟ temporary orientation by words. 
SO function is a method of semantic orientation [16]. Then, 
we calculate the value of importance weighting for a user by 
line13 (Z is set as a normalized factor). Recursively, we 
could conclude users‟ personal orientation and levels in 
line15. Consequenctly, the user who has strong personal 
orientation is regarding as strong concious level to some 
topics. We do that algorithm for every posts under a topic 
until their orientation in convergence. So that we could 
know users‟ conscious orientation in each attending topic.  
In the following, we obtained OPL value via the 
algorithm in Figure 3, and then compute the coordinate 
value between pairwise users by (2). Define

D. Degree of Participation Analysis 
In behavioral feedback analysis, we would analyze 
different types of behaviors and attending level in some 
topics to discover the degree of preferences. (Assume each 
user‟s personal behavior patten is changed in different 
topics.) Here, we regarded user behaviors as three states. s1 
is like button reply or simple text reply; s2 is pure text reply; 
s3 is additional remark such as outer link reply. S=[s1,s2,s3]. 
And each state has a feedback set value. 
We analyze each user‟s behavioral patterns in different 
topics and themes they attended by (3), which calculates the 
maxmum likelihood of behavioral patterns via markov 
model (The algorithm is shown in Figure 4.). The 
behavioral patterns are regared as behavioral sequences 
under one of the topics that user attended, and then we 
leverage (4) to calculate the participation score. 
i z
Y , is represented the probability of user i who has actions 
on topic z;

Eventually, we would like to construct a resonating 
network using the hidden features we analyzed in part C and 
D. This network is represented as a graph

. Each 
node indicates an user that has a feature vector to stand for 
himself/herself. And each edge is the resonance-relationship 
between users, if the score of resonance-relationship is 
larger than the threshold, then the edge will be set up. We 
leverage (5) to compute resonance score between user s and 
user t.

conditions changed according to the whole circumstance,

EXPERIMENT AND CASE STUDY 
In this paragraph, we set the experiments based on 
Facebook raw data (explained in Environment and Figure 
2.). Our preliminary experiments focus on observing active 
cluster and acquiring behavioral pattern. Moreover, we find 
some worth discussing phenomenon and then explain in 
discussion. 
A. Experiment Results 
The number of attending user and interaction are 83 and 
100 in dataset 1. Likewise, the number of attending user and 
interaction are 175 and 205 in dataset 2.  
We query “Photography” to get related themes 
(fanspages) then obtain hot topics via posts. The difference 
between dataset1 and dataset2 is the type. This is due to 
human factors and inherent properties in target platform. 
When we query target text, lots of related fanspages appear, 
and how shall we choose? If the type of dataset is cross-
theme, it means we may filter some people we don‟t know 
whether they are important. 
We know there is 9.8% active rate in dataset 1 and there 
is 5.1% active rate in dataset 2 by (1). Here, we set the 
threshold value 0.2. See TABLE I., we understand the real 
active cluster is minority. While a dataset is huge, the active 
cluster is also colossal but manageable. Re-visit indicates 
how many re-interactions are in whole datasets.

After active cluster detection, we do the algorithm of 
behavioral pattern by user generated contents (UGCs). We 
picked up part of attending users with topics and bsq   
(behavior sequence) shown in TABLE II. If an user has 
several bsq in one topic and then we get the maximum 
likelihood bsq to be his/her behavior pattern. Then we could 
use (4) to calculate participation score. We adjust 
wstate
 
according to the conditions in topic. (An example is in 
Figure 5.)

B. Case Study 
We leverage our model to apply for “opportunistic 
social matching”. This idea we proposed is different from 
the existing social matching. Previous studies matched users 
according to the explicit information and past records in 
their profiles or even the questionnaire of personal 
requirement. Thus,  the differences are explained in our 
novel model, it leveraged user behaviors and comments in a 
short period and discovered preferences and resonance-
relationships among users. Therefore, oppotunistic social 
matching could well reflect real user„s conditions and 
socialization. 
The environment is designed based on facebook platform. 
Users participate in activities on Photography page in 
publishing media category that we regard it as a specific 
theme. Then, there were two topics with ten posts in three 
days (2012 Jan. tenth to twenty-fourth): “Canon lover”, 
“single-lens-reflex cameras/SLR” and “Quiz Time”. The 
number of attending users is 175, and the number of 
interactions is 205. Therefore we could know a section of 
users have higher frequency of attending interactions 
(Dataset 2). 
Firstly, attending conditions of all attending users‟ are 
calculated by (1) in order to obtain the AC cluster. Secondly, 
if the outputs of all comments and posts for each topic are 
looked up in the terminology database the ever talked 
function is triggered. Then, check whether user talks about 
the terminology again. For instance, a user talked “DSLR” 
in this terminology database repeatedly, we accumulate the 
times, and vice versa. In case that a user just acts “good” or 
“I love it” frequently, we thought it is not useful information 
for a specific theme. We obtain users‟ opinion after getting 
value of temporary orientation iteratively. In other words, 
the orientation is convergent in an interval value. When the 
value of user‟s 
IM(u,Th)
 is large enough, and the interval 
value of OP is positive, we could say that an user tends to 
post referable comments on this theme. After obtaining 
user‟s OPL, we leverage (2) to understand coordinate 
opinion between users. 
Thirdly, we obtain a user‟s behavioral patterns to 
understand user‟s attending score. For example an user 
commented a sentence “I did not understand, can you 
explain with another…”. Then we found they usually did 
actions in this topic, so that we set their pattern <s2> in this 
topic. If an user always clicks like button or says “wow”, we 
set their pattern <s1>. Each user has a feature vector 
including AttendS, Co_op and characteristic decided by 
potential 
parameters, 
and 
these 
features 
are 
all 
corresponding to topics of themes. In the end, we get RS 
score by (5) to construct the resonance-relationship network.   
C. Discussion 
We give another example about photography; there are 
two topics: “some photo shots about 2012 New Year” and 
“the shots about weather in Taiwan” in a period of time we 
crawled. (Topic3 is dataset 2.) The number of attending 
users in the first topic is nine, and we could obtain the each 
number of states of behaviors. Simultaneously, we also 
obtained the number of attending users and each state of 
behaviors in the second topic is 211. The simple observation 
is shown as Figure 5. X-axis is represented each state. Y-
axis is represented the corresponding occupying ratio with 
the topic. We calculate the average weight of each state 
according to the observation Figure 5. The number of 
attending users in topic one is few to refer to; therefore, we 
would select datasets carefully to make them in real 
condition. (The tendency may be changed in different social 
medium, because each social media owns its limitations.)

In Table III, we compare our model on social matching

Comparing to ours, the affinities could be modified with 
time goes by, so as to reflect the real users‟ conditions. 
Alsaleh‟s  research [9] matched similar condition users after 
clustering attributes of male and preferences of female and 
considering the target user and “yes or no” of email and kiss 
actions. In addition, #twintera social matching model [10] 
collected profile information and user‟s interest then

proposed knowledge indicators from several aspects by 
Twitter API. On the contrary, ours analyzed the time-
varying hybrid data so the result will be changed according 
to user‟s interaction in social medium. 
In addition, we realized behavioral distribution varies 
obviously. The distribution is not regular, we know the 
more trivial and intuitive action the more popular. Of course, 
it depends on the contents of posts. If the issue of post is 
suitable for discussion, the state-2 type will become more.  
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND PROSPECT 
This research mainly proposed and dicussed a novel model 
and methods. Instead of the conventional methods, which 
almost analyzed by personal profile information, and then 
calculate similar interests relationship. In order to solve the 
problem of inconsistency between  subjective opinion and 
objective fact, and understanding hidden causes, we 
perceive that people know each others in several factors and 
not at all by similarity. So that we leverage users‟ interactive 
data: posts, comments and behaviors to develop our method, 
instead of static personal profile information (even explicit 
links). This model is useful to construct resonance-
relationship network, we could understand the relationship 
factoring by some hidden causes. Thus it could be applied to 
several scenarios such as social matching, marketing. And 
we expect it will be in favor of future applications 
development.
