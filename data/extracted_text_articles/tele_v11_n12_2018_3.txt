Abstract — Enhanced Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC) are 
required 
for 
the 
current 
demand 
of 
flexibility 
and 
reconfigurability in telecommunications networks. However, 
the technical and functional requirements of the PIC demand a 
thorough characterization and testing to provide an accurate 
prediction of the PIC performance. In the characterization and 
testing context, the use of Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) can 
be beneficial. SLM is a diffractive device to reconstruct images 
from Computer Generated Holograms (CGH) that allows to 
modulate the wavefront of a light beam. This capability can be 
explored to feed/receive optical signals to the PIC, i.e., as a 
flexible SLM based coupling platform. The feasibility of this 
approach 
was 
tested 
with 
the 
generation 
of 
a 
multiplexing/demultiplexing CGH to be applied into an optical 
chip for data compression based on Haar wavelet transform. 
Simulation results for building blocks as well as the all-optical 
network for the optical data compression chip are presented, 
supporting their theoretical feasibility. A new concept to use a 
SLM as a flexible coupling platform to complement PIC 
characterization process is proposed and a Haar transform data 
compression PIC described.

INTRODUCTION 
In the recent years, we have witnessed a significant 
increase in the data traffic, which the traditional copper based 
electronic media fail to carry [1]–[3]. Furthermore, the 
increasing demand for higher image/video storage capacity 
and data transmission rates led to the search of new bandwidth 
optimization solutions. Integrated photonics appears as a 
promising technology to achieve this outcome. Photonic 
Integrated Circuits (PIC) are the equivalent of Electronic 
Integrated Circuits (EIC) in the optical domain. As an 
alternative to transistors and other electronic components, PIC 
contain optical elements, such as modulators, detectors, 
attenuators, multiplexers, optical amplifiers and lasers. PIC 
advantages can be attributed to their lower power 
consumption, smaller volume and weight, higher thermal and 
mechanical stability, and the easier assembly of numerous and 
complex 
systems. 
In 
summary, 
PIC-based 
optical 
communication systems offer an efficient and cost-effective 
solution to data transmission driving to a significant boost in 
the segment [2]. An annual growth rate of 25.2% in the PIC 
market during the period of 2015 to 2022 is foreseen [3]. 
There is also an increasing demand for PIC driven by 
innovative applications in biophotonics [2]. 
PIC can be characterized as a multiport device composed 
of an integrated system of optical elements embedded onto a 
single chip using a waveguide architecture [4]. The testing of 
optical components is more difficult than on electrical 
components and for an accurate prediction of the PIC 
performance, an extensive characterization/testing is required 
[5]. Moreover, optical component testing is difficult and time-
consuming, e.g., due to the tight 3D alignment tolerances for 
accurate coupling of light [5]. 
Given increasing demand for data transmission and 
storage, data compression emerges as an important field of 
study with different available techniques explored to release 
additional 
bandwidth. 
Specifically, 
for 
faster image 
processing, compression methods are fundamental tools to 
decrease 
redundant 
data. 
Different 
compression 
transformation techniques can be used, with the wavelet-based 
transforms as the most promising ones due to their simplicity 
and fast computation [6]. All-optical network design appears 
as a prominent solution for the application of such 
compression methods. By applying this architecture into a 
PIC, image compression can be attained with lower cost, less 
power consumption and high data rate due to an all-optical 
processing implementation [7]. Among the wavelet-based 
methods, Haar transform (HT) offers a good approach for 
image processing and pattern recognition due to its simple 
design, fast computation power and efficiency, being easily 
implemented by optical planar interferometry [4] [6] [7]. The 
HT implementation can be achieved with a two level network 
of asymmetric coupler devices [4]. 
The capability of a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) to 
dynamically reconfigure the optical wavefronts makes it an 
attractive technology to excite cores or modes of optical 
waveguides [8] [9], as it allows the arbitrary addition or

removal of channels by the software and it is anticipated that 
it can achieve some basic channel equalization. This feature 
can then be explored to feed/receive optical signal from PIC 
[1]. 
SLM is an electronically programmable device that 
modulates light using an array of reconfigurable pixels [10]. 
This device can control incident light in amplitude-only, 
phase-only or a combination of phase-amplitude [10] [11]. 
One of the most commonly used modulation mechanisms is 
the electro-optical SLM containing liquid crystals as the 
modulation material [11] [12]. The liquid crystal spatial light 
modulators have a microdisplay that is used to collect and 
modulate the incident light, in a transmissive (liquid crystal 
display – LCD) or reflective (Liquid Crystal on Silicon – 
LCoS) form. Another distinguishing characteristic of these 
modulators is the alignment of the liquid crystal molecules, 
which is typically either parallel, vertical, or with twisted 
formation. In combination with appropriate polarizing optics, 
this determines which properties of the incident light beam 
can be altered, i.e., phase, amplitude or a combination of the 
two [11] [12]. 
Nonetheless, common hologram generation methods 
cannot arbitrarily modulate the amplitude and phase of a beam 
simultaneously [13] [14]. It is not then possible to simply 
address the inverse Fourier transform of the desired pattern 
into the far-field and replicate the resulting distribution of 
amplitude and phase directly on the SLM [13]. Thus, it is 
necessary to apply optimization algorithms to calculate the 
best hologram possible within the constraints of the device 
[13]. 
The SLM based on nematic LCoS technology is an 
electrically addressed reflection type phase-only SLM in 
which the liquid crystal is controlled by a direct and accurate 
voltage and can modulate the wave front of a light beam [11] 
[15], as shown in Figure 1.

LCoS SLM is used as a diffractive device to reconstruct 
images from Computer Generated Holography (CGH) [16]. 
Appropriate holograms can be generated using a range of 
different optimization techniques, e.g., linear Fourier 
transform (i.e., linear phase mask) [17][18], Iterative Fourier 
Transform Algorithm (IFTA) [19] [20], Gerchberg-Saxton 
algorithm [21] and simulated annealing [22]. The use of a 
SLM as a diffractive device to reconstruct images from CGH 
allows to modulate the wavefront of a light beam. 
In this study, we proposed the use of the SLM technology 
as a flexible coupling platform for feeding photonic integrated 
processors, i.e., to feed/receive optical signal from a PIC [1]. 
Furthermore, it can be used as a parallel implementation of the 
HT image compression algorithm. Preliminary results were 
obtained to produce an expected CGH to be applied into an 
optical chip for data compression based on Haar wavelet 
transform [1]. 
The paper is organized in four sections. Section II 
describes the methodology applied for the design of the HT 
two level network, building blocks, and PIC; the generation of 
the CGH; and the setup for the flexible SLM coupling 
platform. Subsection II-A presents the all-optical system 
architecture for data compression based in HT; Subsection II-
B presents the design of the PIC for data compression, 
addressing the asymmetric coupler and chip design; 
Subsection II-C presents the generation and optimization of 
the CGH. Sections III and IV present the obtained results and 
its discussion, respectively. Section V concludes the study. 
 
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
The methodology is divided into three subsections: (A) the 
design of an all-optical system architecture for data 
compression based in Haar wavelet transform; (B) the 
algorithms used for the generation and optimization of the 
CGH; and (C) the implementation of the SLM setup to acquire 
the CGH. 
 
A. All-optical system architecture for data compression 
based in HT 
A digital image can be seen as a group of pixels, where 
neighboring pixels are correlated and usually redundant. 
Through the decreasing of this redundancy (by compression 
techniques) the transmission speed and the bandwidth of the 
system can be optimized. Transforms based on orthogonal 
functions are the most frequently used in signal compression 
techniques. The orthogonality is an important property for 
multi-resolution analysis, where the original signal can be split 
into low and high frequency components without duplicating 
information. These functions only require subtractions and 
additions for their forward and inverse transforms. Examples 
of these transforms are the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), 
the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and the Discrete 
Wavelet Transforms (DWT) [23]. DWT have the advantage 
of representing a fundamental tool for local spectral 
decomposition and nonstationary signal analysis, used in the 
JPEG2000 standard as wavelet-based compression algorithms 
[24]. DWT represent an image as a sum of wavelet functions, 
with different location and scale [25], i.e., High-pass (detail) 
and Low-pass (approximate) coefficients. Low-Pass (LP) and 
High-Pass (HP) filters are applied to the input data with a two 
level signal decomposition architecture, as depicted in Figure 
2.  
The Haar wavelet transforms [7] [26] [27] (an example of 
multiresolution analysis) were chosen due to their simplicity 
and fast computation.

Figure 2. Two level band decomposition using multi-resolution analysis 
based on wavelet transform. Low-Pass (LP) and High-Pass (HP) filters are 
applied two times to obtain the 1D transform (L and H components) and 
the 2D transform (LL, LH, HL and HH components). 
 
The sub-band decomposition achieved through the 
wavelet transform enables the compression directly on a 
specific portion of the spectrum, through spatial frequency 
characterization. 
 
 
 
 Figure 3.  All-optical scheme of system building blocks for Haar wavelet 
transform processing and compression. 2D transform process schematic 
describes Low-pass (L) and High-pass (H) filtering through sub-band 
decomposition [7]. 
The all-optical system architecture for data compression 
based in the HT can be divided in four main building blocks: 
i) optical sensors array; ii) Haar wavelet transform; iii) 
compression; and iv) data encoding section. 
The scheme for all-optical image acquisition, processing, 
and transmission is depicted in Figure 3.  
The first building block entails the acquisition level with 
optical sensors for light detection and two dimensional (2D) 
data sampling. The HT is implemented in the second building 
block, to extract the image properties by exploiting the energy 
compaction features of the wavelet decomposition.  
The HT block (second building block) includes Low-pass 
(L) and High-pass (H) filters associated with the Haar wavelet, 
applied over one dimension (1D) at time. The filtering 
operation can be simplified as the calculation of the average 
between two neighbors’ pixels values (LP) or the difference 
between them (HP). Equation (1) presents the Haar transform 
scattering matrix for a generic 1D input (ai coefficients), i.e., 
pixel line or column. LP and HP filters are applied two times 
to obtain the 1D transform (L and H component) and the 2D 
transform with the four  LL, LH, HL and HH components, see 
Figure 2 and Figure 3. 
The coefficients on the left side of (1) are the scaling cij 
and detail dij coefficients (where i refers to the transform level 
and j to the coefficient index) obtained from the LP and HP 
filtering, respectively, for each pixel pair, which corresponds 
to the 1D first level of the Haar discrete wavelet transform. In 
a 2D matrix input (NN) this operation is performed twice, 
i.e., horizontally and vertically, for each transformation level, 
to guarantee that image intensity variations are evaluated 
along the two dimensions.

The same filtering operation is performed in the LL sub-
band for the next level of the transform, whereas the other sub-
bands (i.e., LH, HL and HH) can be stored, transmitted or 
discarded, being the transform coefficients related to higher-
frequency components. 
The third building block carries out the compression and 
extracts the desirable information from the 2D transform, e.g., 
LL component. The all-optical system ends with the encoding 
building block where the data stream is delivered through the 
optical channel [7]. 
The optical device chosen to implement the HT was a 3 
dB asymmetric coupler, also known as a magic-T, depicted in 
Figure 4. The asymmetric coupler is characterized by having 
different waveguides widths, which can present a wide range 
of coupling ratios and low value of excess loss (0.7 dB),

[28].

To perform the HT operations the asymmetric coupler 
must be designed in order to perform a 50% coupling ratio. 
 
B. PIC design for data compression  
A data compression chip based on Haar wavelet transform 
was designed in accordance with the rules and using building 
blocks available from “Application Specific Photonic 
Integrated Circuit” (ASPIC) foundries [29], as well as 
proprietary building blocks created and simulated by the 
authors [4].  
The chip was fabricated through a Multi-Project Wafer 
(MPW) offered by the consortium “Joint European Platform 
for Indium Phosphide based Photonic Integration of 
Components and Circuits” (JePPIX) [30].  
This platform allows the development of low-cost ASPIC 
using generic foundry model and it supplies design kits for 
MPW. The fabrication process was achieved under the 
program “Photonic Advanced Research and Development for 
Integrated Generic Manufacturing” (PARADIGM) [31], 
developed to allow Universities to access to foundry 
processes. This program reduces the costs of the design, 
development and manufacture by establishing library-based 
design combined with technology process flows and design 
tools.  
 
1) Asymmetric adiabatic coupler  
An asymmetric adiabatic coupler in Indium Phosphide 
(InP) platform, based on adiabatic coupling arrangement was 
designed using the medium-index-contrast waveguide E600 
structure, provided from Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Heinrich 
Hertz Institute (FhG-HHI) design manual structures [32]. 
 Due to non-disclosure agreement (NDA) of Oclaro and 
HHI generic foundry processes, further details about the 
waveguide structure (e.g., structure dimensions and refractive 
indexes) cannot be provided. The wavelength supported by 
the developed structure is infrared C-band.  
To achieve the phase and coupling ratios necessary for the 
asymmetric coupler requirements, extensive simulations and 
fine tuning of all design parameters were performed to attain 
the right profiles and outputs. Design and propagation analysis 
was conducted under the Beam Propagation Method (BPM) 
in OptoDesigner, a tool provided by Phoenix Software [33] 
[34]. The generic design of the developed InP asymmetric 
coupler is depicted in Figure 5. 
A set of several sections of different sizes was applied in 
the waveguides design to guarantee the expected coupler 
behavior.

To perform the Haar wavelet transform a two levels 
network with three asymmetric couplers was designed, as 
depicted in Figure 7. 
 
2) Chip design 
An InP data compression chip to address the Haar wavelet 
transform was designed [4]. The optical chip is composed by 
four Distributed Feedback (DFB) lasers (L1-L4), three 
asymmetric couplers (C1-C3), six PIN photodiodes for 
network monitoring, two spot size converters, six multimode 
interferometers (MMI) 12 and one MMI 22. The e PIC 
includes one coupler network for compression and another 
one for decompression. The compression network is 
composed by the three asymmetric adiabatic couplers, 
arranged in a two level network, as depicted in Figure 7.  
The inputs of the compression network are fed by four 
DFB lasers.

The outputs are connected to two spot size converters 
(providing optical output signal) and PIN photodiodes 
(providing electrical output signal), see Figure 8. 
The decompression network is composed by four MMI 
12 and one MMI 11. Four optical outputs are provided, as 
depicted in the bottom right corner of Figure 8B. The 
complete circuit architecture is presented in Figure 8. 
The HT operations include Low-pass (L) and High-pass 
(H) filters applied over one dimension at a time. This filtering 
operation corresponds to the calculation of the average 
between two neighbors’ pixels values (LP) or the difference 
between them (HP) [7]. The HT is implemented with a two 
level network composed by three asymmetric adiabatic 
couplers (22), reproducing the required operations, i.e., the 
average (sum) and the difference (subtraction) between the 
optical input pair [4].  
The 2D HT can be decomposed in four sub-bands, LL, LH, 
HL and HH [7]. The LL gives the data compressed. In the chip 
these four sub-bands can be extrapolated from the four output 
waveguides (WG) at the end of the three asymmetric couplers 
network, as depicted in Figure 9. 
The measurements of the distance between the four WG at 
the end of the three asymmetric coupler network are 𝑑1 =
241.3 𝜇𝑚, 𝑑2 = 278.6 𝜇𝑚, and 𝑑3 = 248.0 𝜇𝑚, see Figure 9. 
Measurements were performed with a Leica microscope (DM 
750M; 1CC50 HD) and an objective of 20 (HI Plan EPI, 
20/0.40) [36]. 
BPM simulations from OptoDesigner of the asymmetric 
adiabatic coupler and the two level network are provided in 
Results subsection A. 
 
C. Generation of the CGH 
The CGH is a phase mask or diffractive optical element 
that can be displayed on an SLM [17].  
 
 
 
 
The information to be transformed (in the Fourier domain) 
is introduced into the optical system by the SLM, with a phase 
mask that is appropriate to the input function of interest [37].  
The following calculations applied for the generation of 
the CGH were based in the Fourier optical principles 
presented in [37]. 
The CGH was obtained with a linear phase mask 
calculated in the frequency domain (2), where 𝑐𝑥 and 𝑐𝑦 are 
the horizontal and vertical tilt parameters, respectively; and 𝑓𝑥 
and 𝑓𝑦 are the components of the spatial frequency vector 
corresponding to the image to be generated in the 𝑋 and 𝑌 
axis, respectively. 
 
𝑀(𝑓𝑥, 𝑓𝑦) = −2𝜋(𝑐𝑥 𝑓𝑥 + 𝑐𝑦 𝑓𝑦) 
(2) 
 
The mask transfer function to be sent to the SLM, is given 
by 𝐻𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘 = 𝑀 (𝑓𝑥 , 𝑓𝑦) 𝑚𝑜𝑑2𝜋, ensuring that the phase values 
are set in the range of [−𝜋, 𝜋].  
A collimated Gaussian beam with transverse profile 𝑆𝑖𝑛 is 
imaged onto the SLM via a lens. Using the Fraunhofer 
approximation this produces the Fourier transform at the SLM 
plane, 𝑓𝑓𝑡(𝑆𝑖𝑛). Next, this illumination profile is multiplied 
with the phase mask, 𝑒𝑖𝐻𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘.  
Finally, the result is Fourier transformed by a second lens 
through an inverse Fourier transform to give 𝑆𝑜𝑢𝑡, the field at 
the input plane of the PIC. 
 
An estimation of the output signal is given by (3).

1) Optimization of the CGH 
To obtain a hologram that replicates the output of the four 
WG of the optical chip (see Figure 9) was computed a 
composite hologram of four beams by approximate phase-
only superimposition of four independent holograms 
generated by (2). The correspondent linear transformations in 
the Fourier domain presented in (5), (6) were applied [1]. 
 
 
 
𝐻 = ∠(𝑒𝑖𝐻1 + 𝑒𝑖𝐻2 + 𝑒𝑖𝐻3 + 𝑒𝑖𝐻4) 
(5) 
𝐻1 = exp (𝑖2𝜋(𝑐𝑥1𝑓𝑥 + 𝑐𝑦1𝑓𝑦)) 
(6) 
 
A phase-only SLM does not allow to simply address the 
inverse Fourier of the desired pattern into the far-field and 
replicate the resulting distribution of amplitude and phase 
directly on the SLM [13], thus it is challenging to spatially 
modulate the light with the expected resolution and accuracy. 
To overcome this difficulty, an iterative algorithm to 
obtain the desired hologram with an error factor 𝛿 ≤ 10% 
was implemented. This threshold was set to avoid an infinite 
loop in the optimization algorithm, while ensuring an 
accuracy ≥ 90% in the output result. 
 
The main steps of the algorithm can be described as: 
i) 
generate a 1st linear phase mask to produce the 
expected initial field based on (5); 
ii) 
initially set the four values 𝑎1−4  to 1, from 𝐻 =
∠(𝑎1𝑒𝑖𝐻1 + 𝑎2𝑒𝑖𝐻2 + 𝑎3𝑒𝑖𝐻3 + 𝑎4𝑒𝑖𝐻4);  
iii) acquire the replay field form the hologram generated 
by SLM (𝐼𝑆𝐿𝑀) with a camera and feed this data to 
the algorithm;  
iv) calculate the difference between the hologram 
generated and the initial field expected, defined as 
error factor: 𝛿 = |𝐼𝑆𝐿𝑀 − 𝐼1| ≤ 0.1;  
v) 
if the condition 𝛿 ≤ 0.1 is not satisfied repeat steps 
(ii-iv) by iteratively adjusting the values of 𝑎1−4 to 
compensate the error factor.

The algorithm developed in Matlab® [38] was able to 
control both SLM and camera hardware. The block diagram 
of the algorithm is presented in Figure 11. 
The error factor ( 𝛿 ) quantifies the deviation of the 
generated hologram when compared with the expected output 
of the optical chip, i.e., the dimensions of the four WG. 
 
D. Setup to generate the CGH 
A reflective LCoS phase only SLM, model PLUTO-
TELCO-012, with a wavelength range of 1400-1700 nm, an 
active area of 15.36 mm × 8.64 mm, a pixel pitch of 8.0 µm, 
a fill factor of 92% and reflectivity of 80% [11] was used to 
display the hologram. 
To remove the phase distortion and have the full Fourier 
transform scaled by the factor of the focal length (𝑓) the 
optical system was design based in the 4𝑓  system 
configuration, i.e., four distances of length 𝑓 separating the 
input plane from the output plane [37]. This forms the basis of 
a low distortion optical system.

using an infrared (IR) laser of 1550nm, a polarization controller, lens L1, a 
LCoS-SLM, lens L2 and a IR camera. Bottom figure: Photography of the 
setup presented. 
 
The setup was composed of: a laser (1550 nm 
wavelength); a polarization controller; two lenses (AC254-
050-C-ML, AR coating 1050-1620 nm) L1 and L2 with a 
focal length of 75 mm and 250 mm, respectively; a Near-
Infrared (IR) (1460-1600 nm) camera (sensing area: 6.44.8 
mm, resolution: 752582, pixel size: 8.68.3 m) to capture 
the hologram produced; and a neutral density filter to avoid 
saturation in the camera acquisition, see Figure 12.

As depicted in Figure 13-A and Figure 13-B, the behavior 
as a 50% splitter is observed, when only one of the input 
waveguides carries an optical signal.

the same input signal is provided on both WG1 and WG2. Output power 
values are presented in percentage. 
 
When both of the input waveguides carry an optical signal, 
sum and subtraction are achieved at the output waveguides. 
As can be seen by the duplication of power in the WG1 (99% 
of the output signal) and the absence of power in the WG2 
(0.3%), see Figure 14.

The power propagation result for the two level network 
composed by three InP asymmetric adiabatic couplers is 
presented in Figure 15. As expected, the HT operations are 
carried out correctly, which can be confirmed by the power at 
the four output waveguide ports, i.e., sum at the output WG2 
(98% of the overlap output signal). 
 
B. Experimental CGH results 
A hologram was generated so as to produce four beam 
profiles in the first order of diffraction when displayed on the 
SLM.  
Figure 16 presents the image acquired from the replay 
field of the hologram generated with the initial (𝐼1 ) and 
optimized (𝐼𝑜𝑢𝑡) CGH. 
 
 
Figure 16. Replay field of the hologram acquired by the IR camera using 
an: i) initial hologram (left figure), and ii) optimized hologram (right 
figure). 
 
The analysis of the obtained replay field images can be 
described by the following steps:  
 
(1) calculate the intensity integration of the image 
matrix, i.e. sum of all elements along each line of the 
image matrix, depicted as 𝑆𝑟𝑎𝑤; 
(2) application of the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter to 
smooth the intensity integration signal obtained in 
step (1), depicted as 𝑆𝑆𝐺; 
(3) implementation of a first order Gaussian fit curve to 
the filtered signal, depicted as Gauss fit; 
(4) extraction of Gaussian parameters to calculate the 
distances between the four beams (obtained from the 
CGH) and compare with the expected results (d1, d2 
and d3 from the optical chip).

Figure 18. Gaussian fit (Gauss fit – blue line) of smoothed integrated 
intensity signal from the replay field image (𝑆𝑆𝐺 – red dots). Left: Initial 
CGH; Right: Optimized CGH.  
 
The signal smoothing of the intensity integration was 
obtained with the Savitzky-Golay filter, which can be 
characterized by a generalized moving average with filter 
coefficients determined by an unweighted linear least-squares 
regression and a polynomial model of specified degree [38]. 
The parameters applied in the filter were a polynomial order 9 
and a window length 19. 
Results after steps (1) and (2) are depicted in Figure 17, 
and Gaussian curve fitting application are presented in Figure 
18. 
The distance between the four beams was calculated from 
the center position of each beam profile, given by the Gaussian 
fit coefficient corresponding to the position of the center of the 
peak. The coefficients were obtained with 95% confidence 
bounds.  
The deviation values (𝛿) of the generated hologram (i.e., 
initial 𝐼1 and optimized 𝐼𝑜𝑢𝑡 holograms) when compared with 
the expected output of the optical chip (i.e., d1, d2 and d3 from 
Figure 9) are presented in Table III.

An error factor 𝛿 ≤ 20% was obtained for the initial CGH

integration intensity profiles, i.e., the integral of the Gaussian 
fit. Table IV presents the integration of the intensity profiles 
for each beam when applying the initial an optimized CGH. 
Correspondent mean and standard deviation values of the

Integration of the normalized Gaussian fits presented in Figure 18. The four beams are 
numbered from 1 to 4 from top to down, as depicted in Figure 16. Std: Standard

A beam mean power loss of 1.1 dB between the initial and 
the optimized CGH was observed. Nonetheless, a better beam 
equalization was achieved in the optimized CGH with a 
standard deviation reduction of 2%. 
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The design of the asymmetric adiabatic coupler and the 
all-optical network implemented to perform the Haar wavelet 
transform in InP were demonstrate to operate according to 
predictions as confirmed by the BPM simulations, supporting 
their feasibility for compression purposes. 
An improvement in the generated hologram is achieved 
with CGH optimization, i.e., a major reduction of 11% 
(difference between initial and optimized) in the error factor 
(𝛿) was obtained. Nevertheless, the loss of 1.1 dB identified 
on the mean beam power for the optimized CGH an improved 
equalization between the beams was observed, with a 2% 
reduction in the standard deviation.  
Algorithm improvements will be addressed to mitigate the 
power discrepancies between the four beams and optical 
artefacts associated with the diffraction of light not yet 
completely eliminated, which can cause a reduction of signal 
expected at the four output WG of the optical chip.  
An alternative approach to correct some of this artefacts 
would be the implementation of the Gerchberg-Saxton [21] or 
simulated annealing [22] algorithms, nonetheless due to the 
power-loss (up to 9dB [13]) associated with these approaches 
they were not addressed in this study.  
The phase mask that replicates the expected output of the 
optical chip can be used to multiplex/demultiplex the obtained 
result. Furthermore, a phase mask, which addresses the HT 
operations can also be applied to invert the compression 
induced by the HT (optically implemented in the chip with the 
three asymmetric couplers network).  
The use of the SLM coupling platform will allow to 
provide a proof of concept of the PIC operation.

CONCLUSION 
An extensive PIC characterization and testing is essential 
to provide an accurate prediction of its performance. In this 
study, we proposed a new concept to use the SLM as a flexible 
platform for feeding photonic integrated processors in order to 
complement the PIC characterization process. The capacity of 
the SLM to dynamically reconfigure light allows to feed 
and/or receive information to the PIC and can be used as a 
parallel implementation of the HT image compression 
algorithm. This data can be used to provide a proof of concept 
of the operation performed by the optical chip, e.g., 2D HT. 
The design of building blocks for the HT implementation as 
well as the all-optical network were proposed and simulated, 
demonstrating their viability for compression. A first result 
was obtained, i.e., a phase mask that can be used to receive the 
output of an optical chip for data compression based in the HT.  
Further developments will be conducted to provide a more 
robust SLM based flexible coupling platform, e.g., by 
improving the optical system components and the 
implemented phase masks.
