Abstract-Chlorpyrifos 
(CPF) 
is 
an 
organophosphorus 
pesticide widely used in the world, which acts by inhibiting 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Exposure to this compound is 
harmful to the respiratory system during in utero and 
postnatal period. Such perturbations during prenatal and 
intrauterine life are associated with further diseases at 
adulthood through fetal programming. Some of these 
disturbances 
are 
linked 
to 
food 
composition 
and 
environmental pollutants. The aim of this study is to examine 
the effects of perigestational exposure to CPF and to a High-
Fat Diet (HFD) on the occurrence of sleep apnea in young 
adult rats. Female rats were exposed for four months before 
and later during gestation and lactation periods to CPF 
(1mg/kg/day vs vehicle) with or without HFD. In vivo 
measurements of sleep apnea were performed by whole-body 
plethysmography for male pups at post-natal day (PND) 60. 
Then diaphragm, an essential respiratory muscle, were 
dissected and used for in vitro measurements of AChE 
activity assessment. The perigestational exposure to low dose 
of CPF and/or HFD induced an increase in the sleep apnea 
index in males at early adulthood, which was associated with 
a significant decrease in the AchE activity compared to 
controls. In conclusion, the chronic perigestational exposure 
to CPF combined with HFD feeding is associated with 
increased sleep apnea occurrence and reduced AchE activity 
at early adulthood in rats. Other studies are required to 
investigate 
the 
mechanisms 
underlying 
respiratory 
perturbations during development due to early life 
perturbations.

INTRODUCTION 
The perinatal period is characterized by high plasticity 
of the physiological systems, exposing the individual to 
higher vulnerability to his environmental factors. Then, 
any disruption in these physiological processes is 
described in the concept of Developmental Origin of 
Health and Diseases (DOHaD) [1]. 
Maternal obesity constitutes an environmental risk 
favoring the occurrence of obesity or type 2 diabetes at 
adulthood [2][3].  
Organophosphate (OP)  insecticides are compounds 
commonly used for a variety of agricultural, industrial, 
and household applications [4] and are detected in food 
and drinking water [5]. They are potent AChE inhibitors 
resulting in the accumulation of acetylcholine at 
cholinergic synapses and consequent overstimulation of 
the central nervous system and neuromuscular junctions 
[6]. Recently, it has been shown that exposure to 
Carbofuran, an AChE inhibator, is positively associated 
with sleep apnea in US Farmers [7]. Central respiratory 
failure associated with apnea is considered to be the major 
cause of death following OP poisonings [8]-[10]. CPF, an 
OP pesticide, is suspected to affect the metabolic 
programming from the fetal period until adulthood [11]. 
Pre- and postnatal exposure to CPF has been shown to 
increase sleep apnea index during development [12].
However, continuous perigestational exposure for four 
months, before gestation till the end of lactation, without 
exposing the rats directly to CPF during early adulthood 
has not been examined. 
It has been shown that sleep apnea is associated with 
moderate to severe levels of obesity [13]. Studies in obese 
populations have reported an association between 
metabolic 
dysfunctions 
and 
sleep 
apnea 
[14]. 
Furthermore, the increase in the incidence of apnea during 
sleep has been shown to be dependent on the metabolic 
disturbances such as insulin resistance induced by High-
Fat Diet (HFD) feeding in rats despite the absence of 
obesity as reported by Ramadan et al. 2006 [15]. 
In this context, the present study aimed at determining 
the effects of long term perigestational exposure to CPF 
and/or HFD, 4 months before gestation and throughout 
gestational and lactational periods, on the occurrence of 
sleep apnea in young adult rats who were not exposed 
directly to CPF or HFD. Also, we measured the AChE

activity in the diaphragm, an essential respiratory skeletal 
muscle. The paper procedes as follow: Section II

Section III, and, finally, Section IV presents the discusion 
and draws the conclusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This section describes the methodology and the 
experimental tools used. 
A. Experimental Design  
Female Wistar rats (age on arrival: 7 weeks) receiving 
a standard diet or HFD (60% kcal from fat) were force-fed 
with CPF (1 mg/kg/day) vs vehicle (rapeseed oil) for four 
consecutive months. Then, the females were mated with 
the male rats. During gestation, the females were 
subjected to the same treatment as before gestation until 
the end of the lactation period. At weaning; postnatal day 
(PND) 21, pups were separated from their mothers and 
four groups of male rats (n=7 per group) were identified 
according to their maternal exposure into: Control group 
(standard diet and vehicle), HFD group (HFD and 
vehicle), CPF group (standard diet and CPF), and 
HFD+CPF group (HFD and CPF). After weaning, the 
pups received only a standard diet without CPF until the 
PND60. Whole-body plethysmography was used to score 
apnea index during sleep for all male pups. Only male rats 
were selected for this study since female rats were used in 
another study.   
B. Protocol for sleep apnea assessment 
Each animal was familiarized for 60 min to the 
plethysmograph chamber during two consecutive days 
before the onset of measurements. On the second day, 
during 
the 
60 
min 
of 
measurement, 
behavioral 
observations were performed. We continuously noted 
whether the rat was awake (i.e., lying or standing with 
opened eyes) or was asleep (i.e., lying down without 
movements with closed eyes). Sleep apneas were scored 
using a previously described procedure, i.e., defined as 
two missed breaths [16]. Sleep apnea indexes were 
calculated as the number of apneas/h of behavioral sleep.  
C. Acetylcholinesterase activity measurement  
The Acetylcholinesterase activity in the diaphragm 
dissected from the midcostal region was measured 
according to the modified Ellman method [17]. The 
diaphragm samples were homogenized in lysis buffer 
(Abcam) and then centrifuged. 1 μl of protease inhibitor 
(Abcam) was added to the supernatant. The supernatant 
(diluted 1:2) was incubated with 100 μm of the butyryl 
cholinesterase 
inhibitor, 
tetra 
isopropyl 
pyrophosphoramide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 minutes 
before measuring AchE activity using the AChE 
colorimetric assay kit (ab138871; Abcam) according to 
the manufacturer's instructions. The AchE activity is 
expressed in μmol/min/mg protein. 
D. Statistical Analysis 
A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used 
to study the main effects of diet (standard diet/HFD) or 
exposure (Control/CPF) and the interaction between diet 
and CPF exposure. If a significant interaction was found, 
a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was then 
performed. Statistical significance was set to p˂0.05 and 
indicative results (p<0.1) were shown when needed. 
III. RESULTS 
The main results obtained are presented in this 
section.  
A.
Sleep apnea index 
A significant increase in sleep apnea index with either 
maternal CPF exposure (p0.05) or HFD feeding (p0.05) 
was observed. Indeed, there was a significant increase in 
the sleep apnea index by 96% in each of CPF group 
(p0.01) and HFD group (p0.01) and by 88% in 
CPF+HFD group (p0.05) compared to the control group 
(Figure 1).

by 29% respectively compared to controls. A significant 
decrease was also reported in CPF+HFD group by 40% 
(p0.05 vs control) (Figure 2).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
This study is in line with the DOHaD concept. Since 
fetal development depends mainly on the maternal 
nutritional supply, then any disruption in the intrauterine 
milieu could predispose offspring to further diseases in 
later life. The present study was designed to evaluate, for 
the first time, the impacts of long term maternal exposure 
to two major alimentary risk factors; junk food and OP 
pesticide residues on the respiratory performance during 
early adulthood. The perigestational effects were studied 
through continuous exposure of female rats to CPF (1 
mg/kg/day) and HFD (60% kcal from fat) four months 
before gestation till the end of lactation period at the 
PND21 and without exposing the pups after PND21 to 
neither CPF nor HFD. 
The present study showed that perigestational 
exposure to CPF and/or HFD is associated with increased 
sleep apnea index. An increase of 67% in the sleep apnea 
index was reported in developing rats that are pre and 
postnatally exposed to CPF [12]. In our study, the 
increase in the sleep apnea was higher (around 100%) in 
CPF and/or HFD exposed rats. This incremental increase 
can approve the concept of DOHaD where maternal 
exposure to environmental toxicants can affect the life of 
the offspring even if they are not exposed to the same 
toxicants as shown in our study. The apnea episodes 
observed following OPs exposure can be attributed to 
either central effects caused by the AChE inhibition in the 
respiratory centers [18][19] or to peripheral effect 
resulting from airway obstruction [20]. On the other hand, 
HFD has been shown to increase apnea incidence in 
sleeping rats as a result of the induced metabolic 
disruptions [15].  
The increase in the sleep apnea index could be linked 
to the reduced AchE activity in the diaphragm resulting in 
the overstimulation of the motor end plates. Obesity can 
affect the muscle force production by altering fiber type 
composition of the muscle and by disrupting calcium 
cycling mediated by the major calcium channels, 
ryanodine receptor and SERCA pump [21][22].  
In conclusion, the maternal exposure of rats to CPF 
and/or HFD during the perigestational period alters the 
respiratory performance in their offspring at early 
adulthood despite they are not in direct contact to either 
CPF and/or HFD. Further studies are needed to determine 
the mechanisms underlying respiratory perturbations 
during development due to early life disturbances. The 
integration of this study can help in the prevention of 
chronic respiratory diseases in adults.
