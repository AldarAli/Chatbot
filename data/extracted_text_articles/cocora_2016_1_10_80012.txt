Abstract—Even though wireless Internet service has grown
rapidly, the available wireless bandwidth resource is limited. So,
efficient network bandwidth resources management has become
an important issue. Recently, cognitive radio technology has been
getting a lot of attention to improve bandwidth efficiency. In this
paper, we propose an adaptive bandwidth management scheme
based
on
the
mechanism
design
and
negotiation
theory.
According to the user`s utility, Quality of Service (QoS) and trust
value, the proposed scheme allocates total resources while
dynamically
controlling
the selfish
users. In addition,
the
proposed scheme is able to make a control decision in a
distributed manner. This approach can reduce the excessive
number of operations and increase the primary user`s profit; it is
practical for real world network operations. Simulation results
show
that
the
proposed
scheme
provides
much
better
performance than the existing schemes.

INTRODUCTION
Radio spectrum is the scarcest resource for wireless
communications. Therefore, in the next generation wireless
network, it may become congested due to diverse types of
users and applications. Recently, regulatory bodies like the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United
States are recognizing that traditional fixed spectrum allocation
can be very inefficient. In order to fully utilize the scarce
spectrum resources, Cognitive Radio (CR) technology has
becomes a promising approach, which allows unlicensed
wireless users (secondary users: SUs) to dynamically access
the licensed bands from legacy spectrum holders (primary
users: PUs) on a negotiated or an opportunistic basis. Dynamic
spectrum access in CR networks can enhance the radio
resource utilization. To realize efficient spectrum usage, we
must migrate from the current static spectrum access to a
dynamic spectrum [1]-[3].
Most existing resource allocation approaches for CR
networks assume that SUs are truthful, cooperative and always
successful in operation. Therefore, SUs always send truthful
information in interference environment, even though they can
fail resource allocation. These assumptions are only available
in an ideal theoretical situation. However, in the real world,
untruthful SUs exist; they can lie in order to get more spectrum
resource by using untruthful information. In such cases, the CR
network administrator wishes to design a new protocol that
extracts the missing information from the SUs. Due to this
reason, we need a new game model to force selfish SUs to
cooperate.
To effectively manage the limited spectrum resource,
extensive research has been carried out. Nowadays, game
theory has become a powerful tool to analyze and improve the
performance of CR network control protocols. Game theory is
the mathematical theory of interactions between self-interested
agents. It can describe the possibility to react to the actions of
the other decision makers and analyze the situations of conflict
and cooperation. In particular, it focuses on decision making in
settings where each player’s decision can influence the
outcomes of other players. In such settings, each player must
consider how each other player will act in order to make an
optimal choice. In the game theory, a game consists of player,
strategies and payoff function [4]-[6].
Recently, researchers have proposed various algorithms to
optimally share the spectrum resource using cognitive radio
technologies. Auction game models also have been proposed
for efficient spectrum sharing in CR networks. Initially, auction
game has been studied extensively in the economics literature.
Usually,
it is implemented with
efficient
social choice
functions; participants have private information about their
preferences. An auction is a process of buying and selling
goods or services by offering them up for bid, taking bids, and
then selling the item to the highest bidder. In game theory, an
auction game may refer to any mechanism or set of trading
rules for exchange. A well-known auction mechanism is the
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves
(VCG)
mechanism
[7].
It
is
a
generalization of the famous Vickery auction where bidders
submit written bids without knowing the bid of the other
bidders in the auction. The important properties of the VCG
mechanism are direct-revelation and strategy proof [8]; each
bidder reveals his/her true value no matter what strategies the
other bidder chooses. However, the VCG mechanism needs a
huge computational overhead. Therefore, the traditional VCG
mechanism might be impractical for the system’s overall
operations.
In 1982, Israeli economist Ariel Rubinstein built up an
alternating-offer bargain model based on the Stahl’s limited
negotiation model; it is known as a Rubinstein bargaining
process. This model can provide a possible solution to the
problem that two players are bargaining with the division of the
benefits [9]. Most of all, the Rubinstein can significantly

reduce the computational complexity and overhead. It is
practical and suitable for real implementation.
In this paper, we propose a new spectrum allocation scheme
for CR networks. In our game model, SUs are game players,
and
can
make
strategic
decisions
independently
while
maximizing their payoffs. By using the VCG mechanism, our
proposed scheme is designed as a cooperative game model. In
addition, to effectively reduce the computational overhead of
VCG mechanism, we adopt the Rubinstein bargaining model.
This integrated approach can simplify the implementation of
VCG mechanism. Therefore, our proposed scheme effective
controls selfish SUs to increase the total system utility while
reducing the VCG mechanism time complexity.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II explains the
related works. In Section III, we present the proposed
algorithms in detail. In Section IV, performance evaluation
results are presented along with comparisons with other
schemes. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section V.
II. RELATED WORKS
In this section, we introduce two game-theoretic models
for the effective resource allocation in CR networks. In
Section II-A, we present the desired properties of a VCG
mechanism design to effectively control selfish SUs. In
Section II-B, we introduce the Rubinstein Bargaining Model,
which can help VCG mechanism design to decrease time
complexity.
A. VCG mechanism
VCG mechanism is a field of Mechanism Design (MD) to
study a solution concept for the class of private information
games. Traditional MD consists of a specification of possible
agent strategies and the mapping of each strategy from a set of
strategies
to
an
outcome.
Agents
are
assumed
to
be
autonomous and economically rational; they select a best-
response strategy to maximize their expected utility with other
agents. The family of direct-revelation and strategy-proof
mechanisms has been derived from the MD theory and are
referred to as VCG mechanism. The VCG mechanism has
better computational properties than the original MD and
provides a normative guide for outcomes and payments. When
applying the VCG mechanism to complex MD problems, a
feasible outcome can be obtained from the results
of
computationally tractable heuristic algorithms [10]. Each
agent in the VCG mechanism is of a specific type. According
to its type, an agent selects a specific strategy, which defines
the agent’s actions. Generally, an agent type is represented
byߠ,(e.g., each agent i is of typeߠ௜).
The VCG mechanism is a special case among traditional
mechanisms, in which the agent-announced type (ߠ෠) is no
longer necessarily truthful; the symbolߠ෠ indicates that agents
can misreport their true types. Based on agent-announced
types, the choice rule (݇∗൫ߠ෠൯) is defined as follows [11]
݇∗൫ߠ෠൯ = argmax௞∈ࣥ ෍ݒ௜൫݇,ߠ෠௜൯
(1)
୧
where k is a feasible choice of the set of all possible
choices andݒ௜൫݇,ߠ෠௜൯ defines the agent i’s outcome of a choice
k with its typeߠ෠௜; the VCG mechanism implements the choice
k*
that
maximizes
∑ݒ௜(݇,ߠ෠௜)௜.
Therefore,
the
VCG
mechanism maximizes the total outcome of the system to the
agents. Based on ݇∗൫ߠ෠൯ , the payment rule ( ݌௩௖௚,௜(ߠ෠)) is
defined as follows
݌௩௖௚,௜൫ߠ෠൯ =ݒ௜൫݇∗൫ߠ෠൯,ߠ෠௜൯ − {ܸே − ܸேି௜}
(2)
where ܸே is the total reported outcome of k* and ܸேି௜ is
the total reported outcome of the choice that would be gotten
without agent i, i.e., ܸே = max௞∈ࣥ ∑ݒ௜൫݇,ߠ෠௜൯
୧
and ܸேି௜ =
max௞∈ࣥ ∑ݒ௝൫݇,ߠ෠௝൯
௝ஷ௜
.
B. Rubinstein Bargaining Model
In Rubinstein-Stahl bargaining model, players have their
own bargaining power (δ). The division proportion of the
benefits can be obtained according to the bargaining power,
which can be computed at each player individually. The
higher the bargaining power, the more a player benefits from
the bargaining. Players negotiate with each other by proposing
offers alternately. After several rounds of negotiation, they
finally reach an agreement as follows
(ݔଵ
∗,ݔଶ
∗)

That is to say, there is a first-proposer advantage in the
bargaining process. Traditionally, the bargaining power in the
Rubinstein-Stahl's model is defined as follows
ߜ=݁ିక×∆,ݏ.ݐ.,ߦ>0(4)
where ∆ is the time period of the negotiation round. Given
the ∆ is fixed (i.e., unit_time),ߜ is monotonic decreasing with
theߦ.ߦ is an instantaneous discount factor to adaptively adjust
the bargaining power.

a

of

games
that

alternating offers through an infinite time horizon. For a long
time, the solution to this type of bargaining game was a
mystery. Therefore, Rubinstein’s solution is one of the most
influential findings in cooperative game theory [11].
III. PROPOSED SCHEME
In this section, the proposed scheme is explained in detail.
The proposed scheme is designed to provide an effective
resource allocation for CR network. The main objective of our
2

scheme is to maximize social welfare by the optimal resource
allocation.
A. Bargaining process for distribution of resources
In CR network, SUs use the spectrum bandwidth that
should not have interference. Due to this reason, only SUs who
are in available interference distance can use spectrum
bandwidth. To secure enough interference distance, SUs are
grouped as clusters by exchanging SU’s distance information,
and can guarantee the mutual interference. The SUs are
clustered as follows, i) all SUs exchange their distance
information and perform the cluster operation only with SUs
that are in their mutual interference, ii) in each cluster, leaders
are selected by random process, iii) all SUs in each cluster send
request message to leader, iv) leaders in each cluster send
cluster request message to administrator, v) the administrator
calculates each cluster leader’s Signal to Interference plus
Noise Ratio (SINR), and allocates allocation sequence number
by using SINR.
To allocate the total resource, the administrator starts to
bargain with each cluster leader, sequentially. In this paper,
Rubinstein bargaining approach is used for the fairness
allocation. In the Rubinstein bargaining model, the decision of
patience factor values is a key issue. For the SU’s patience
factor on the aggregated SUs’ payoff. If the sum of SU’s utility
increases, the total system payoff also increases. Therefore,
δ௚ can be defined as follows
δ௚ =
1
ߙ×ݒ+ߚ×ݍ+ߛ×ݐݎ,
ݏ.ݐ.,݀δ௚(ݒ)
݀ݒ>0, δ௚(0) = 1 and δ௚(∞) = 0
(5)
whereߙ,ߚ,ߛ are weighted factors for value (ݒ), importance
of traffic (ݍ) and trust value (ݐݎ). In the proposed scheme, to
provide the fairness for each leader, administrator decides
patience factor (δ஺) to be the midpoint of all leaders’ payoffs
like as
δ஺ =
2
∑
(݃௝(ݒ)+݃௝(ݍ)+݃௝(ݐݎ))௠
௝ୀଵ
(6)
Based on the obtained δ௚ and δ஺ values, we can develop
the Rubinstein bargaining process. The administrator collects
each leader’s bandwidth request, and defines each cluster’s
total request (g) as follows,
g௝ = ෍ r௜
௡
௜ୀଵ
(7)
where r௜ is the agent i’s bandwidth request, and g௝ is the
cluster ݆’s total request. According to the administrator’s offer
(x) and cluster ݆’s offer (y), the equilibrium point of Rubinstein
bargaining model can be obtained. Finally, the Rubinstein
bargaining equilibrium point can be expressed as follows:
ݔ∗=
1− δ௚ೕ
1 − δ஺δ௚ೕ
,ݕ∗=1− 
1− δ௚ೕ
1 − δ஺δ௚ೕ
(8)
In this work, VCG mechanism is used to effectively control
selfish users and resource allocation, which can increase a
social welfare. However, the main disadvantage of VCG
mechanism is the higher computation complexity. To reduce
the computation complexity, firstly, we group all SUs into each
cluster, and the Rubinstein bargaining model is applied to each
cluster, iteratively. According to the Rubinstein bargaining
process, we can distribute the total bandwidth resource (R) to
each cluster. Finally, the VCG mechanism is used in each
cluster to effectively control selfish users and resource
allocation, which can increase a social welfare. Our distributed
approach is more practical and justified for real network
operations.
B. Resource allocation based on trust VCG mechanism
In the VCG model, vector of allocation K is defined as
follows
ࡷ={∅,߬ଵழି௔௟௟௢, ߬ଶழି௔௟௟௢, … , ߬௜ழି௔௟௟௢}
(9)
Let ∅ and < −݈݈ܽ݋ be
respective
non-allocation
and
resource allocation, respectively. If the SU ݅ gets the resource
(k=߬௜ழି௔௟௟௢,ࡷ=∅), his cost function (c௜(ࡷ)) is defined as
c௜(τ) . The total system value function (ݒ௔௟௟௢(ࡷ)) can be
defined asݒ௔௟௟௢(ࡷ)=ݒ௔௟௟௢(߬). We define the vector of
successful probability = [݌ଵ(τ), … , ݌௜(τ)] , and the SU ݅ ’s
successful probability (݌୧(߬)) can be defined as the ratio of the
total successful task operation (∑
(߬௟ೞೠ೎೎೐ೞೞ
௜
)
௅
௟ୀଵ
) to the total task
(∑
(߬௟
௜)
௅
௟ୀଵ
).
݌୧(߬) =
∑
(߬௟ೞೠ೎೎೐ೞೞ
௜
)
௅
௟ୀଵ
∑
(߬௟
௜)
௅
௟ୀଵ
,ݏ.ݐ.,(݌୧(߬) ∈ [0,1]
(10)
where ߬௟
௜ represents whether the task allocation is allocated
(0) or not (1), and ߬௟ೞೠ೎೎೐ೞೞ
௜
represents whether the task is
successfully operated or not. The expected value function
(ݒ̅௔௟௟௢(ࡷ,݌)) is defined based on the probability ݌୧(߬).
ݒ̅௔௟௟௢(ࡷ,݌)=ݒ௔௟௟௢(ࡷ)×݌௜(τ)
(11)
Each SU should send his own information about the
probability (݌̂) and cost function (ܿ̂) to the administrator. At the
same time, each SU also can send the un-trust information
(ܿ̂, ݌̂) to maximize his profit. In the proposed scheme, the
resource allocation is adaptively controlled based on the
accurate analysis of costs and payoffs. In more detail, the

Similar to the traditional VCG mechanism, the payoff of
each SU is defined as the marginal contribution of the selected
SU to the CR system; it is extracted by comparing the second
best decision, excluding the selected SU. Without the best SU,
the second-best expected payoff for the CR service, which
allocates resource can be obtained as follows by considering
success and fail cases.

(13)
whereࡷି௜ is a set of allocation without the SU i. With
probability (݌௜(߬)), the expected utility (ݑത௜(ܿ̂, ݌̂)) is achieved
based on the expected marginal contribution, which is the
difference between the best and the second-best expected
utility.
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme
is validated through simulation. To emulate a real-world
CR environment and for a fair comparison, we carefully
select the system parameters as shown in Table 1. Using
our simulation model, the performance of the proposed
scheme is compared with the two CR resource allocation
schemes; the traditional VCG scheme [12] and the single
TBMs scheme [13].

Usually, the performance of CR systems depends on the
sum of SUs’ payoff, total system payoff, the SUs’ satisfaction
and task succession probability. In this paper, the performance
measures are plotted as the number of SUs.
Figure. 1. Total system efficiency due to the number of SUs
In Figure 1, the system revenues of each scheme are
compared to each other. System revenue is estimated as the
total sum of successful SU task profits. From the service
providers’ point of view, it is a very important performance
factor. From the simulation results, we can see that the system
revenue of our proposed scheme is higher than the other
existing schemes.
Figure. 2. Satisfaction of QoS with interference
Figure 2 shows the QoS satisfaction of SUs. From the
viewpoint of SUs, QoS satisfaction is a critical issue. Usually,
QoS evaluation factors are availability (uptime), bandwidth
(throughput), latency (delay), error rate, and so on. However,
as mentioned earlier, the proposed scheme is designed to

concentrate
on
the
social

aspect
of
bandwidth
allocation. Therefore, the total amount of allocated bandwidth
for successful task is assumed as a major QoS satisfaction
factor. Under various operation times or the number of SUs,
the proposed scheme can provide much better QoS satisfaction
than other schemes.
Figure. 3. Satisfaction of Trust with distance
Figure 3 shows the performance evaluation about trust
satisfaction. When the administrator allocates the spectrum
resource, trust satisfaction for all SUs is obtained. These results
represent the system’s satisfaction. Our proposed scheme
considers the trust value, QoS satisfaction and SU’s utility.
Therefore, the proposed scheme can maintain a better trust
satisfaction than other existing schemes.
V. CONCLUSION
Recently,
the
design
of
effective
CR
management
algorithms has been one of intense research issues. In this
paper, we propose a new adaptive bandwidth management
scheme based on the VCG mechanism and Rubinstein
bargaining model. Based on the SU’s payoff, QoS and trust
information, the proposed scheme can dynamically allocate
the total bandwidth resources while maximizing PU`s profit.
In addition, we make a control decision in a distributed
manner. This distributed approach can reduce the excessive
computation complexity of original VCG mechanism. It is a
highly desirable feature for real-world CR system operations.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can
provides much better system performance than the existing
schemes.
