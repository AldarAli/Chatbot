Abstract— Low-intensity Laser acupuncture (LA) has been 
applied as an alternative to needling along the past three 
decades. The ST36 (Zusanli) acupoint is used to treat 
inflammatory processes, acute pain and gastrointestinal 
disturbs. For this reason, the aim of the present study was to 
evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of Laser acupuncture 
(830 nm, 4 J/cm2) on ST36 acupoint on paw edema induced by 
carrageenan in mice, a model of acute inflammation. Mice 
were treated with LA 30 min before intraplantar injection of 
carrageenan (300 µg/paw). The formation of edema was 
assessed using a digital micrometer and temperature analyzed 
through thermography. The results indicate that ST36 LA 
significantly inhibited the paw edema induced by carrageenan 
and reduced the temperature on skin plantar surface. In 
conclusion, these results demonstrated that ST36 photonic 
stimuli have anti-inflammatory effect in acute model of 
inflammation in mice. 
     Keywords: Laser acupuncture; inflammation; edema. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Acupuncture is an effective procedure for pain relief, 
nausea and vomiting, bronchial asthma, musculoskeletal 
disorders and inflammatory conditions [1]. There are 
different acupuncture techniques, which traditionally use 
needle puncture [2]. However, laser acupuncture (LA) is a 
noninvasive and noninfectious method that can avoid pain 
and psychological fear promoted by the insertion of needles 
[2-5]. Indeed, LA is a form of phototherapy at acupoint 
similar to needle acupuncture, differing in the type of 
stimulus [6].  
The ST36 (Zusanli) acupoint has been used to treat 
inflammation, acute pain and gastrointestinal disturbs [7]. 
Previous studies showed that ST36 acupoint stimulated with 
Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), during 2, 6 and 10 min, 
inhibited the nociceptive response induced by formalin in 
mice [8]. Recently, Erthal et al. [4] also demonstrated that 
ST36 stimulation with Gallium Aluminium Arsenide 
(GaAlAs) laser elicited significant antinociceptive effect 
against acetic acid- and formalin-induced nociception in 
rats, with participation of opioidergic and serotonergic 
systems. Moreover, it has been reported that the application 
of ultra low level laser therapy (ULLLT) on ST36 and TB5 
acupoints also reduced acute and chronic inflammation 
induced by carrageenan and complete Freund's adjuvant, 
respectively (for review see Baratto et al. [9]). Interestingly, 
a clinical study with LA, set to 830 nm and 30 mW, applied 
on ST36 and IG4 acupoints reduced significantly the 
migraine in children [10].  
Carrageenan is a substance widely used for induction of 
inflammation in animal models, and is a test employed to 
assess the effects of alternative methods, as LA, for 
inflammation and pain control [11]. It is well known that 
temperature can be a parameter in models of inflammation 
and several studies with acupuncture use the local 
measuring of temperature to evaluate its effect on 
inflammatory processes. Sanchez et al. [12] demonstrated 
that the thermal imaging technology (thermography) is a 
rapid, highly reproducible method to quantify the degree of 
inflammation in rat models of general inflammation.   
However, further studies must be done to deeply assess 
its clinical efficacy and to investigate the molecular 
mechanisms involved in its effect. Despite the stimulation 
of ST36 acupoint being used to treat inflammatory 
conditions, there are few evidences demonstrating the 
effectiveness 
of 
LA 
for 
reducing 
edema 
due 
to 
inflammation. For this reason, the aim of the present study 
was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of LA on ST36 
acupoint using the acute inflammatory model in mice.  
The paper was divided into four parts: (I) Introduction, in 
which we present the scientific fundamentals involved in 
anti-inflammatory effect of Laser acupuncture, and the goal 
of the experimental study proposed; (II) Material and 
Methods performed on this research, as well as the main 
experimental models involved; (III) Results related to the 
application of the experimental protocols and Discussion 
about the main results; and (IV) Conclusion, where we 
highlight findings on the performed study.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
A. Animals 
Experiments were conducted using female Swiss mice 
(25–35 g), housed at 22 ± 2 °C under a 12/12 h light/dark 
cycle (lights on at 06:00 h) and with free access to food and

water. All experimental protocols were performed after they 
were 
approved 
by 
the 
Committee 
of 
Animal 
Experimentation of the Federal University of Paraná (CEUA 
- UFPR, protocol number 514).  
 
B. LLLT treatment procedures and body location 
 
    For the experiments, a low-intensity GaAlAs laser 
equipment was used. Its main parameters were: wavelength 
of 830 nm (in continuous-mode), fluence of 4 J/cm², power 
of 30 mW, irradiation area reached 6 mm², duration of 8 s 
on the acupoint. The animals were randomly divided into 
four groups (n=8 animals per group): (1) Control group, 
which was not treated; (2) Laser on group, which was 
treated with unilateral ST36 laser acupuncture; and (3) 
Laser off group, in which laser device was turned off but 
holding the probe in contact with ST36 acupoint; (4) 
Dexamethasone group [DEXA, 0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal 
(i.p.)], a positive control of the test. ST36 (Zusanli) acupoint 
is located between the tibia and the fibula, approximately 5 
mm lateral to the anterior tubercle of the tibia [4]. 
 
C. Acute inflammation induced by carrageenan 
 
The animals were treated with laser and DEXA and, after 30 
min, an intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of carrageenan (300 
µg/paw, 20 µl) was administered into the right hind paw of 
the mice. The thickness of the paw was measured using a 
digital micrometer (Great, MT-045B) before the induction 
of edema (B: basal) and at different time points after the 
injection of the phlogistic agent. All of the assessments were 
performed by the same investigator in order to reduce any 
potential inter-operator differences.  
 
D. Thermografic analysis 
 
Temperature measurements of the hind paw´s plantar 
surface were obtained by an Infrared Camera, model A325 
(FLIR Systems, Inc.). The main parameters of the 
thermographic camera are: acquisition frequency of 60 Hz 
with 16 bits-resolution, 320 x 240 pixels image resolution, 
detecting wavelengths  from 7.5 up to 13 μm, lens 
incorporating autofocus, temperature measurement in the 
range of -20 to +120 °C, with 2% accuracy, thermal 
resolution of 0.08 °C and 0.1 mm of spatial resolution. The 
software used for thermographic images acquisition, storage 
and analysis was the ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2.9, 
developed by FLIR Systems, Inc. Skin temperature was 
measured after leaving each animal at least one hour to 
acclimate with the laboratory temperature. Animals were 
lightly anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30-40 
mg/kg, i.p., Cristália, Brazil) to suppress the righting reflex 
while preserving the withdrawal reflex. Anesthetized mice 
were gently placed on the box, and the dorsal surface of the 
hind paw was fixed. The hind paws were positioned, and the 
heat emitted from the plantar region was measured using the 
infrared camera. 
 
E. Statistical analysis 
 
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean 
(S.E.M.). Comparisons between experimental and control 
groups were performed by one- or two-way analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's test when 
appropriate. P values less than 0.05 were considered as 
indicative of significance.  
 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Inflammation is the body’s immediate response to the tissue 
damage and defined by vasodilation, exudation of fluid and 
cell 
migration. 
In 
1962, 
the 
carrageenan-induced 
inflammatory response was described for the rat paw, and in 
1969 for mice [13]. Since that time, edema on mice´s paw 
has been increasingly used to test new anti-inflammatory 
drugs and treatments [14]. Then, we used this model of 
acute inflammation induced by carrageenan to evaluate the 
anti-inflammatory 
effect 
of 
LA 
treatment. 
In 
our 
experiments, it was observed a rapid onset of paw edema in 
the control group after i.pl. injection of carrageenan. 
Interestingly, the results depicted in Fig. 1 indicate that 
ST36 LA significantly inhibited the paw edema at 2 and 3 h 
after phlogistic agent injection, with inhibitions of 13 and 
18%, respectively. However, the treatment with laser device 
turned off was not able to reduce the edema when compared 
to the control group. DEXA, a steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drug and positive control of the test, also reduced the paw 
edema at 2 and 3 h (Fig. 1). It is known that laser therapy 
activates 
both 
local 
microcirculation 
and 
cellular 
metabolism, and produces anti-inflammatory, analgesic and 
regenerative effects [15], suggesting that these factors could 
be involved in our LA treatment. In accordance with our 
findings, another type of LA, the ULLLT, is also able to 
inhibit the paw edema induced by carrageenan [16]. Lee et 
al. [17] showed that electroacupuncture, applied on ST36 
and SP6 acupoint, on different frequencies such as 2, 15 and 
120 Hz, produced relevant anti-edema effects compared 
with control group. For laser therapy, a range of 
wavelengths 633.8 up to 904 nm can be applied [18]. 
Besides, 
according 
to 
the 
Arndt–Schultz 
law 
for 
biostimulation, anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects 
occur at doses between 0.05 and 10 J/cm2 [19]. In this study, 
LA with wavelength of 830 nm and radiant exposure of 4 
J/cm2 showed significant effects on the inflammatory model. 
In previous experimental studies in our laboratory, the 
applied dose of 3 J/cm2 demonstrated best responses on 
inflammatory and nociception models. In studies applying 
eletroacupuncture on ST36 point, Park and colleagues [20]

reported effectiveness of this acupoint for anti-inflammatory 
and anti-arthritic on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), via 
suppressing 
autoimmunity 
and 
modulating 
immune 
abnormality. Kim et al. demonstrated that EA stimulation of 
the Zusanli acupoints produced significant suppressive 
effect on carrageenan-induced paw inflammation and 
hyperalgesia [21]. Thermography has been useful for 
diagnosis of inflammatory processes because it can assess 
variations in skin surface temperature. It is highly sensitive 
and noninvasive, capable of detecting very small alterations 
on skin temperature [22]. The thermal image analysis 
involves measurements of the surface temperature the body 
using an array of infrared sensors installed inside the 
camera. This image allows the simultaneous measurement 
of temperatures of multiple points on the skin [23]. The 
images and the graphic illustrated in Fig. 2 show the skin 
temperature change for the plantar surface of the hind paw. 
Changes were measured through the infrared camera 
adjusted to the range of 25 to 37 °C. Fig. 2c shows that the 
inflammation promoted by carrageenan increased the 
temperature of plantar surface in 14% (Naive: 26.5 ± 0.5 
°C). However, the treatment of animals with LA on 
acupoint ST36 reduced the temperature in 12% when 
compared with control group (Control: 30.1 ± 1.0 °C). By 
means of the thermographic analysis, we can conclude that 
LA on the ST36 acupoint has an anti-inflammatory action. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
Several years of research have produced a steady stream of 
laser 
acupuncture 
studies; 
however, 
the 
objective 
assessment and reproducibility of results are difficult 
because of the lack of information about the main physical 
parameters set. However, recent studies have shown that 
laser therapy when administered by a specific emission 
mode may elicit significant biological effects

 Finally, this study allows us to conclude that stimulation 
of the acupoint ST36 with LLLT produces relevant 
suppression of carrageenan-induced paw edema. Further 
studies have been and will be carried out in our laboratory to 
understand the effects of LA on inflammation.
