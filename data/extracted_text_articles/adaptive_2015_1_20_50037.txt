Abstract— A substitution network is a temporary network
that self-deploys to dynamically replace a portion of a damaged
infrastructure by means of a ﬂeet of mobile routers. In this
paper, we evaluate the performance of a previous self-deployment
scheme, adaptive positioning algorithm (APOLO), for substitu-
tion networks and we show the beneﬁt of the controlled mobility
in such a network. To that end, we evaluate APOLO in terms of
throughput under several scenarios and different metrics. These
results constitute a comprehensive evaluation of APOLO and
enable to envision new ways of optimization and future paths of
research. We prove that APOLO is an efﬁcient deployment and
redeployment algorithm for mobile relay networks.

I. INTRODUCTION
A Rapidly Deployable Network (RDN) is a solution to
provide communication services in disaster scenarios. Specif-
ically, we focus on a wireless solution named the substitution
networks [1]. A substitution network is a temporary network to
replace a portion of a damaged infrastructure (called hereafter
base network) by means of mobile routers (called substitution
routers) capable of moving on demand and connecting to the
base network through bridge routers (Figure 1a).
Bridge routers are connected in between the base and the
substitution networks, and used to forward the trafﬁc from the
base network to the substitution network and vice versa.
Mobile substitution routers are wireless routers of the
substitution network, possibly connected to bridge routers, and
whose union provides alternative path(s) to the base network.
Figure 1 depicts the complete overview of using a Substitu-
tion Network, where the bridge routers are deployed together
with the base network (Figure 1a). In this example, the base
network operates without the help of the mobile routers.
When a failure occurs (Figure 1b), the mobile routers are
deployed. In this architecture, the failure detection and the
deployment are done autonomously by the base network itself.
Mobile routers try to ﬁnd an optimal position to restore the
connectivity service and to ensure Quality of Service (QoS)
(Figure 1c). In some cases, the continuous redeployment of
the routers may be necessary to adapt to an evolving network
and to QoS conditions (see Figure 1d).

Particularly, our goal is to have an autonomous router
deployment, as well as a possible redeployment of the mobile
routing devices. Therefore, it is necessary to design algorithms
and protocols to deploy and re-deploy such devices [2]. Since
the routing devices are autonomously provided with a limited
battery, it is also necessary to consider energy constraints dur-
ing the deployment. Moreover, the deployment computation
process does not consider a central entity in the network,
hence, this process should be executed in a distributed man-
ner [3]. An efﬁcient router/relay (mobile or static) deployment
algorithm must take the link quality into account in order
to decide when and where to deploy a relay [4]. For that
purpose, the deployment algorithms must be able to measure
the wireless link quality. We have presented in a previous work
the Adaptive POsitioning aLgOrithm (APOLO) [5].
This paper presents the extended results of APOLO [5]
developed for substitution networks obtained under stress and
some results under different assumptions, especially regarding
channel states. The remaining of the paper is structured as
follows. After browsing the literature in Section II, Section III
describes the background and the basic concepts used in
this paper. Then, Section IV depicts the proposed algorithm
APOLO. Section V and Section VI present the simulation
settings and results. Finally, we discuss these results and
conclude in Section VII.

II. STATE OF THE ART
A self-deployable network is composed of several mobile
routers. Such mobile routers perform the same tasks as their
static similars distributing the data trafﬁc; however, the mobile
routers must self-position in a given area. We can ﬁnd in the
literature few proposals to self-deploy a network. In [2], the
authors present the Spreadable Connected Autonomic Network
(SCAN) algorithm where the mobile routers move to expand
the covered area. In order to maintain connectivity, mobile
routers are allowed to move as long as there is no risk of
disconnection, if a possible disconnection is detected, the
mobile routers must stop moving. A different strategy is
presented in [3], where the mobile routers follow a leader
router on a straight-line formation, once the leader reaches the
desired point it stops and the rest of the routers start stopping
as well. Finally, Kim et al. [6] propose a string-type formation
to deploy the mobile routers, all with identical characteristics.
Each mobile router seeks and adjusts its position according to
the packet delivery ratio or bandwidth. These approaches differ
from ours in the sense that they do not consider link quality.
Such proposals have succeeded to autonomously deploy a net-
work; nevertheless, an efﬁcient self-deploy algorithm should
adapt dynamically to the environment changes, for example,
different zone sizes, changes on mobile users’ distribution, or
changes on the channel conditions.
III. PRELIMINARIES
We consider a wireless network composed of mobile routers
that are located and may move on the two-dimensional Eu-
clidean space. We use “node” as a generic term for any device
in the simulation neighborhood, for instance, the mobile or
classic routers. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that
the transmission range R of a node u is the area in which
another node v can receive/send messages from/to u, i.e.,
d(u,v) < R(u), where d(u,v) represents the Euclidean distance
between u and v, and therefore, it exists a link X between u
and v. We assume that two nodes are “neighbors” when they
are within the communication range of each other.
In the following, we use Xprev and Xnext to refer to the links
of the previous and next hops, respectively, of a mobile router.
Likewise, we assume that some of the devices are ﬁxed, that
trafﬁc needs to be transferred between two ﬁxed devices, and
that the wireless routers dynamically move in the scenario and
act as relays, regardless of the routing protocol. And, as many
link layer protocols, we assume that each node is equipped
with a timer and an 802.11 wireless card, as well as with an
identiﬁer that is unique in the network (MAC address).
We deﬁne the quality of a communication link, or just
“link quality”, as the probability that a message transmitted
on the link is successfully received, that is, the reliability of
the link [4]. The link quality can be assessed as a function of
the received signal strength (RSS) or the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) [7], for example. In general, higher SNR leads to lower
probability of error in the packet. Hence, a link with high SNR
is considered a high-quality link [8]. We use the RSS, SNR,
RTT, and TxRate as values to measure the link quality because
their values retrieve insight of the performance of a wireless
network [9]. Therefore, we call RSS, SNR, RTT, and TxRate
“link metrics” or “link parameters” in general.
We use the term “broadcast” to refer to the message
propagation in a router’s neighborhood in order to obtain the
link measurements. Also, we refer to the control packets of
routing protocols as “hello” messages or beacons and to the
packets used in active measurements as probe packets. Finally,
we deﬁne the term controlled mobility as the ability of some
nodes to move by themselves to a speciﬁc destination or with
a speciﬁc goal, i.e., the opposite of randomly [10].
In this paper, we use the Dynamic Source Routing
(DSR) [11] protocol for our set of simulations. The DSR
protocol is a self-maintaining routing protocol designed for
multi-hop wireless networks composed of mobile nodes. DSR
uses on demand routing allowing each source to determine
the route used to transmit its packets to the corresponding
destinations.
IV. ADAPTIVE POSITIONING ALGORITHM
A new quality-of-service-based architecture for substitution
networks, presented in [1], envisions a wireless network com-
posed of mobile routers/relays that provide alternative paths to
the base network. Such substitution routers are able to move
on demand, so, they can self-deploy and adapt to the network
topology accordingly to the environment conditions.
Previously, we have presented APOLO for self-deploying
mobile routers in a substitution network [5]. During the
substitution network lifetime, APOLO is executed in each
mobile router to determine whether it has to move by using
the feedback of the link quality coming from one-hop neigh-
bors. APOLO consists of three major stages. Firstly, APOLO
measures the link quality by means of one link parameter,
e.g., RSSI, SNR, or delay. Secondly, APOLO computes the
gathered data and makes the movement decision, i.e., if the
router needs to move or not to improve the link quality. And
ﬁnally, APOLO determines direction of the movement and the
router moves accordingly.
The results presented in [5][12] are restricted to only one
propagation model (two-ray ground) and three simulation
scenarios. In this paper, we extend these results with extra
propagation models and scenarios. First, we present the results
obtained when the router’s initial position is random. Second,
we study the behavior of our algorithm when there exist
multiple mobile routers between the source and the destination.
Then, we evaluate the redeployment capacity of the mobile
router when a new node arrives. Finally, we compare the
deployment performance of each link parameter under three
different propagation models (two-ray ground, shadowing, and
ricean).
V. SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT
We present an extension to the experimental performance
evaluation of APOLO. Our main goal is to present the effec-
tiveness of the algorithm to deploy wireless mobile routers in a
given area. To that end, we evaluate our proposal by using the

NS-2 network simulator [13]. In our previous work [12], we
have chosen three scenarios proposed in [14] as a result of the
study on relay wireless networks. We propose three additional
scenarios plus a propagation model comparison.
Since our goal is to assess the impact of controlled mobility
in wireless routers, we use the DSR protocol for our simula-
tions, although, APOLO is not tied to any routing particular
protocol. Table I summarizes the basic parameters used in our
simulations in NS-2. In this paper, we use the instantaneous
throughput (THins) deﬁned as he number of bits transferred
to the ﬁnal destination in any given instant to assess the
performance of our deployment algorithm.
VI. RESULTS
A. Random initial position
In our previous work, the basic scenario is composed of one
mobile router, one source node (S), and a destination node (D).
The source and the destination are placed 250 m away from
each other, i.e., the source is placed at coordinates (0,0) and
the destination at coordinates (250,0). Finally, at the beginning
of the simulation, the router node is placed 10 m away from
the source node, that is, at coordinates (10,0), as depicted in
Figure 2. Then, the router starts moving based on APOLO.
Nevertheless, the mobile router may reach the position that
equalizes the parameter values regardless of its initial position.
Hence, we take again this basic scenario. We run a set
of simulations choosing the initial position of the router
randomly. We use the 802.11b standard along with the two-
ray ground model. Figure 3 plots the x coordinates along time
to illustrate the movement evolution. Figure 3(a) presents the
results while using the RSS as link metric and Figure 3(b)
presents the results while using the SNR as link metric. In
Figure 3(a) the router’s initial coordinates are (23,0), (128,0),
and (160,0), respectively. The theoretical position that equal-
izes should be (125,0) where the router is placed at exactly

the middle point between the source and the destination,
and therefore, the link values of Xprev and Xnext should be
the same. We observe in Figure 3(a) that the router reaches
such a position regardless of its initial position, an expected
result since the two-ray ground model calculates the RSS as a
function of the distance. Similarly, in Figure 3(b), the router’s
initial coordinates are (42,0), (147,0), and (206,0), respectively.
Despite the router does not reach a steady position, this
behavior corresponds to the previous simulations where the
router’s initial position is (10,0), in other words, the initial
position of the router does not affect the movement behavior
by using SNR as link metric. We believe that such a behavior
is due to the propagation model we have used. In order to
corroborate this, we perform a set of simulations with different
propagation models. The results are presented in Section VI-E.
B. Multiple routers scenario
In [12], we studied the performance of APOLO by con-
sidering a scenario with two routers. In such a scenario,
there is a source and a destination communicating though two
mobile routers, so, we extend this scenario by considering
three and four intermediate routers between the source and
the destination, as shown in Figure 4.
1) Three routers: Regarding the three router scenario, the
source, once again, is placed at coordinates (0,0) and the
destination at coordinates (300,0), that is, 300 m away from
each other. At the beginning of the simulation, Router 1 is
placed at coordinates (10,0), Router 2 is placed at (150,0),
11

and Router 3 is placed at (290,0). Then, the routers execute
APOLO to adjust their position using the RSS as link metric,
the results are presented in Figure 5. The deployment evolution
is plotted as x coordinates as function of simulation time where
we observe that the behavior of the routers follows the results
obtained with the two router scenario (Figure 5(a)). The routers
travel the corresponding distance to equalize the values of
the link metric. In this case, Router 1 and Router 3 travel
a similar distance. The routers reach their ﬁnal position after
550 s, which are, Router 1 at 75 m, Router 2 at 150 m, and
Router 3 at 225 m from the source, that means a distance of
75 m between each node. Figure 5(b) plots the instantaneous
throughput obtained during the routers deployment.
2) Four routers: Regarding the four router scenario, the
source is placed at coordinates (0,0) and the destination at
coordinates (400,0), that means, 400 m away from each other.
At the beginning of the simulation, Router 1 is placed at
coordinates (10,0), Router 2 is placed at (140,0), Router 3
is placed at (260,0), and Router 4 is placed at (390,0).
Subsequently, each router adjusts its own position by executing
APOLO using RSS as link metric. Figure 6(a) shows the
routers deployment through the simulation time. Once again,
the ﬁnal position of the routers equalize the link metric
and it is equidistant between nodes. These results, three and
four routers, show that the behavior experienced with only
one mobile router is duplicated, and therefore, APOLO is a
scalable solution and it is able to deal with multiple router
scenarios.
C. Two sources and one destination scenario
By the same token, we evaluate APOLO in a multiple
destination scenario [5]. In addition, we present a topology
with multiple sources by using the topology depicted in
Figure 7, where we illustrate two sources (n0, n1) and one
destination (n3) out of range. Thus, a mobile router (n2)
is used to connect the sources and the destination. At the
beginning of the simulation, the router (n2) is placed 10 m
away from the source nodes (n0, n1) on the straight line

that connects the sources from the middle position between
the receiver node (n3), and ﬁnally, we use User Datagram
Protocol packets with a size of 1 MB since UDP is used in
most multimedia applications.
In this scenario, two identical CBR/UDP ﬂows are trans-
mitted from the source nodes (n0, n1) to destination node
(n0) starting and ﬁnishing at the same time. A priori, we
assume that the best position is located at the coordinates
(83,125), which is the triangle centroid. Then, the router uses
APOLO to decide where to move and RSS as link metric.
The movement trace is depicted in Figure 8(a). During the
ﬁrst 500 s, the router moves in a straight line from (10,125)
to (94,125), i.e., it travels 84 m. After this time, the router
moves from left to right (in the y axis domain) in a range of
±3 m, i.e., from (94,128) to (94,122). This behavior is very
different from that one experimented in a similar scenario with
two source nodes and one destination. In the latter scenario, the
router moves mostly in the x axis range and stops very close
to the triangle centroid. Hence, the oscillation experienced in
two source scenario is caused by the two ﬂows arriving to the
router, that means, the router moves to improve the link quality
accordingly to the data ﬂow arriving at the time. In order
to avoid wasting energy with short distance movements, it is
possible to implement a movement threshold, for example, the
router moves if the RSS value drops under certain threshold.
D. Redeployment
One issue that remains open is the routers redeployment.
The redeployment is specially important in dynamic scenarios.
In the following, we present a simulation campaign where the
redeployment is needed. As in the previous set of simulations,

the mobile router executes APOLO to redeploy and uses
RSS as link metric. At the beginning of the simulation, the
scenario is the one depicted in Figure 2, one source node, one
destination node, and one mobile router. The source (n0), the
router (n1), and the destination (n2) are located at coordinates
(0,0), (10,0), and (250,0), respectively. Then, after 650 s a
new source node (n3) arrives to transmit data to (n2), and
therefore, the router must adapt its position. Node (n3) appears
at coordinates (0,125).
Figure 9 plots the movement of the router in the Cartesian
space. The ﬁrst seconds of the simulation, the router follows
the same behavior than in the previous simulation, in other
words, the router reaches the position at (125,0). Then, when
the second source appears, the router starts to move to equalize
the quality of the new link between (n3) and (n1). Finally,
the router reaches its ﬁnal position at coordinates (124,60).
These results are very interesting for two reasons. Firstly, they
prove that APOLO is useful to redeploy automatically mobile
routers, and hence, it is well suited in dynamic scenarios.
And secondly, the results prove the importance of the hello
messages to advertise the eventual changes in the network
topology, if the transmission rate of such hello messages is too
low, the information gathered may not reﬂect the changes in
the topology over the time. Nevertheless, it is also important to
consider the cost of such hello messages in terms of energy and
overhead. To overcome this problem, it is interesting to study
the optimal transmission frequency of the hello packets [17],
as well as the overhead reduction techniques.
E. Propagation model comparison
The propagation models are empirical mathematical formu-
lations to characterize the radio wave propagation based on
physical phenomena such as distance, used frequency, or fad-
ing effects. In wireless network simulations, the propagation
models are used to simulate the wireless channel by computing
the wireless signal strength at the receivers for any packet
transmitted by a single sender. Particularly, NS-2 simulator
provides three propagation models: Free space model, Two
Ray Ground model, and Shadowing model. Moreover, it is
possible to add a fourth model called Ricean.
Each propagation model computes the attenuation of the
signal strength between the sender and the receiver by using a
Carrier Sensing Threshold (CSThresh_). If the signal strength
is lower than CSThresh_, the packet is discarded at the
physical layer. Otherwise, the signal strength is compared to
a second threshold at the receiver (RxThresh_) to determine
whether the packet is received with errors or not. If so, the
MAC layer discards the packet.
Free space model represents the transmission range as a
perfect circle around the sender. Basically, if the receiver is
within the circle, it will receive all the packets; otherwise, it
loses them. Two-ray ground reﬂection model considers both
the direct path and a ground reﬂection path, a difference
from the free space model, which only considers a single
line-of-sight path. The two-ray ground model gives more
accurate prediction at a long distance than the free space
model. Nevertheless, the free space model is used when the
distance is small because the two-ray model does not give a
good result for a short distance due to the oscillation caused
by the constructive and destructive combination of the two
rays. It is important to notice that both models represent the
communication range as a prefect circle, i.e., the received
power is a deterministic function of distance. On the other
hand, the shadowing model takes the fading phenomenon into
account. Finally, the Ricean model characterizes the effect of
small-scale fading (Rayleigh and Ricean). Such a fading is
caused by movement of the sender, receiver, or of other objects
in the environment. This movement may be characterized by
the Doppler spreading.
As in the previous sections, we evaluate the performance
of APOLO under three different propagation models, Ricean,
Two ray ground, and Shadowing. To that end, we use the
one source-one destination scenario (Figure 2), the router is
placed at coordinates (10,0). Then, we vary the propagation
model for each of the link parameters, i.e., RSSI, SNR,
RTT, and transmission rate. The results obtained are presented
in Figure 10. Figure 10(a) presents the comparison of the
router deployment by using all the APOLO variants for each
model propagation. The Two-ray ground plot was presented
in [5], where router using the RSS variant reaches exactly
the middle point between the source and the destination,
i.e., at coordinates (125,0) while the router using the SNR
and TxRate does not reach a steady point. However, this
behavior changes completely when we evaluate APOLO by

using the Ricean and Shadowing models. Under both models,
Ricean, and Shadowing the performance of the three variants
is similar. None of the variants reaches a steady point still
the router moves ±10 m away from the middle point (125,0).
Nonetheless, this behavior conﬁrms our observation about the
SNR performance obtained in Section VI-A, that is, since
each propagation model characterizes in different way the
events at the physical layer, the values of the link metrics
correspond to such characterization and behave accordingly.
We also include a comparison of each link parameter under all
the propagation models to clarify the difference in the behavior
(Figure 10(b)). Because the link quality values depend largely
on the propagation model, it is important to choose the one
that characterizes better our case of study. In general, the NS-2
community uses the two ray ground model but the shadowing
model corresponds better to the real scenarios.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have presented the impact of controlled mobility to self-
deploy routers in substitution networks. The results provide a
wide view of the performance of the Adaptive POsitioning
aLgOrithm (APOLO). They prove that APOLO is able to
successfully deploy the mobile routers in several scenarios
and by using different propagation models. Moreover, APOLO
performs well also when router redeployment is needed. The
comparison of different deployment algorithms is not a trivial
task since each proposal considers different metrics such
as coverage, number of nodes, devices connected, delay, or
throughput. We believe that a careful election of the perfor-
mance metrics is the next step to continue on this direction.
We have already set the metrics and we are currently compar-
ing several deployment algorithms by means of simulations.
Eventually, we will evaluate such algorithms by means of a
real implementation with WiFiBots®.
We observed that by using the Ricean and Shadowing
models the deployment performance of the SNR and TxRate
variants outperform the two-ray ground one even if in the
former case the router does no reach a steady point. This
disadvantage may be overcome by adding a threshold to avoid
useless movements. Thus, we are interested in studying how
the threshold choice may (or may not) impact the performance.
