Abstract—The H.264/AVC video encoding standard has many 
advanced features that can be tailored to suit a wide range of 
applications. In order to obtain optimal coding performance in 
video sensor networks (VSNs), it is essential to find the right 
setting parameters for the encoder. There is a trade-off 
between required energy for encoding and transmission of 
video content in VSNs that can be exploited to minimize total 
power consumption. In this study, we model the complexity 
and bitrate in H.264/AVC codec. By using the model, the 
trade-off 
between 
encoding 
and 
transmission 
energy 
consumption is further exploited. Our experiments show that 
the complexity modeling error is less than or equal to 3.45%. 
However, the bitrate modeling error that we obtain is less than 
or equal to 11.6%.

INTRODUCTION 
With the increasing concern about security in homes or 
public spaces, the demands for monitoring and surveillance 
systems is growing. In this regard, video sensor networks 
(VSNs) offer an alternative to several existing monitoring 
technologies [1], [2]. However, unlike the traditional sensor 
networks which require negligible power to process captured 
data in the sensor nodes, VSNs need significant processing 
power to encode and transmit the captured videos. With the 
limitations of energy resources in VSNs, maximizing the 
power efficiency of coding and transmission operations 
becomes very important. In general, there is a tradeoff 
between encoding complexity and compression performance 
in the sense that to obtain higher compression performance 
(i.e., lower bit rate), more complex and computationally 
expensive encoding scheme is required. On the other hand, 
transmission of lower bitrate content requires less amount of 
energy. Fig. 1 illustrates the relationship between coding 
complexity, compression performance and the required 
power for encoding and transmission of the content. It can be 
observed that, to minimize the overall VSN power 
consumption, encoding process needs to be handled 
carefully. Among the existing video coding standards, 
H.264/AVC is the most widely used standard in the 
consumer market [3], [4]. Some of the existing studies on the 
performance of H.264/AVC codec look into maximizing the 
coding performance without considering the total power 
consumption of the coding process [3], [5]. J.J. Ahmad et al. 
[6] studied the required energy for encoding and 
transmission of video content in the case of using 
H.264/AVC 
codec. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
number 
of 
configuration settings considered for the encoder in that 
study is limited. To address this issue, we extended the study 
in [6] by including more encoder configuration settings in 
our previous work [7]. We proposed a guideline table for 
encoder configuration setting which include different 
combinations of coding complexity and coding efficiency in 
terms of bitrate that produces compressed videos with similar 
quality in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).  Our 
study shows that the energy consumption of a VSN can be 
reduced by carefully selecting the encoder settings at each 
VSN node based on the proposed table. 
This paper is an extension to our previous work [7] where 
the relationship between coding complexity and coding 
efficiency (in terms of bitrate) of H.264/AVC codec is 
modeled. By using this model, the trade-off between 
encoder complexity and bitrate can be further elaborated, 
unrestrained with the encoder setting parameters. The rest of 
the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the 
H.264/AVC encoding complexity and bitrate modeling. The 
encoding and transmission power consumption model is 
then discussed in Section III. Conclusions are drawn in 
Section IV.

II. 
H.264/AVC COMPLEXITY AND BITRATE MODELING 
H.264/AVC is a block-based hybrid video coding 
standard utilizing intra-frame and inter-frame prediction. 
While inter-frame prediction is more involved than intra-
frame prediction, it results in lower bitrate. By increasing 
the number of inter-frames coded picture within a 
successive video stream, i.e., group of picture (GOP) size, 
the bitrate of the coded video is reduced at the cost of higher 
encoding complexity. In the case of inter-frame prediction, 
the complexity and bitrate can be controlled by adjusting the 
search range (SR) in motion estimation process. The SR 
determines the size of searching area in the reference frame 
to find the best match to be used for inter prediction. 
Increasing the SR size may result in better compression 
performance at the cost of increased complexity. However 
this observation is quite content dependant and there are 
cases where increasing the value of SR does not provide 
significant benefit in terms of compression performance [7]. 
The other factor that controls the complexity and the 
performance of the H.264/AVC codec is the number of 
block sizes used in the inter prediction process. Increasing 
the number of used block sizes  results in better prediction 
and consequently higher compression performance at the 
expense of increased complexity. The complexity of motion 
estimation (ME) can be classified into different level of 
complexity, depending on the number of block size 
candidates used. In general, there are seven block sizes 
defined for inter-prediction in H.264/AVC.  
In this paper, we analyze the effect of different coding 
parameters on the coding complexity using a set of training 
videos and propose a model for the relationship between 
coding configuration and coding complexity, and later this 
model is tested on a set of unseen test video set. The 
following subsections provide more details on our 
experiment settings and the proposed model. 
A. Experiment Settings 
In VSN applications, due to the limitations in energy and 
processing resources, less complex encoder configurations 
are used. To this end, we used baseline profile of 
H.264/AVC that is suitable for low complexity applications 
and uses only I and P frames (no B-frames) in our study. The 
other encoding parameters in our experiments include using 
context-adaptive variable-length coding (CAVLC) entropy 
coding and one reference frame, setting SR equal to 8, and 
disabling the rate distortion optimization (RDO), rate 
control, deblocking filter and Intra coding for P frames 
options. Furthermore, to have an objective measure for the 
encoding complexity, we use the instruction level profiler 
iprof [8], which provides us with the total number of 
instruction counts. The H.264/AVC reference software, JM 
version 18.2 is used in our experiments. Five representative 
videos from [9] are used in our study  (BQMall, Traffic, 
Race Horse, PeopleOnStreet and Vidyo1). To mimic a 
common VSN data, these sequences are downsampled to the 
common intermediate format (CIF) resolution (352x288 
pixels) and also their frame rate was reduced to 15 frames 
per second  (fps). The BQMall and Traffic video sequences 
are used as the training set for the model and the rest of 
videos as the test set. 
B. Complexity Modelling 
The coding process complexity of a video sequence (CS) 
is formulated as follows: 
 
CS = CI ⋅ nI +CP ⋅nP 
(1) 
where CI is the complexity to encode an I-frame, CP is the 
complexity to encode a P-frame, nI is the number of I-
frames in the sequence and nP is the number of P-frames in 
the sequence. For a video sequence with no scene change, 
the value of CI can be considered almost constant. On the 
other hand, CP depends on the complexity level of the ME 
process. In our study, the complexity level of ME process 
(called ML) is classified based on the used block-size 
candidates in the encoding process as shown in Table I. 
As illustrated in Fig. 2, the GOP size does not affect the 
normalized coding complexity of P frames at each ML. Note 
that the complexity of coding P-frame (CP) is normalized 
with respect to Cp when ML is equal to one. Furthermore, as 
it can be seen from Fig. 3, the plot of normalized CP for 
different training videos has the same slope but scaled by a 
constant. It can be seen from this figure that the normalized 
CP for the Traffic video ranges from 1 to 1.485, which also

means that the normalized CP range for this video is 0.485. 
On the other hand, the normalized CP range for the BQMall 
video is equal to 0.66. Scaling the range of the normalized 
CP to one, we can plot the fractional increase of normalized 
CP as shown in Fig. 4. It is interesting to see that the 
increase of normalized CP with respect to ML is almost 
similar for both videos. We define δCP as the amount of 
increase normalized CP at different ML. δCP is calculated by 
averaging the values obtained in Fig. 4, as shown in Table 
II. 
Another interesting observation is that, the value of range 
of normalized CP shown in Fig. 2 is proportional to the 
value of 
. Therefore, using the values obtained from 
the training videos, the range of normalized CP values for a 
specific video sequence is calculated as: 
 
ω1= 0.0135⋅
−2.13   
(2) 
Using ω1, the complexity to encode a P-frame is formulated 
as: 
 
  
(3) 
Considering that nI=N/GOP, where N is total number of 
frames and nP=N−N/GOP, then the average complexity per 
frame is computed as follows: 
 
  
(4) 
C. Bitrate Modelling 
The bitrate of the encoded video is modeled as R=Rf ⋅Fr, 
where Rf is the average bitrate of a frame and Fr is the frame 
rate. The total size of the encoded sequence (in bit) is then 
modeled as: 
 
 
(5) 
where RI is the average size of an I-frame and RP is the 
average size of a P-frame. The value of RP depends on the 
ML and GOP used by the encoder.  
Fig. 5 shows that, the value of RP decreases as ML 
increases. Therefore, for a certain GOP value, the RP is 
modeled as: 
 
 
(6) 
where ωRi is the bitrate of a P-frame when GOP=i and 
ML=1, and f(ML) is a decay function with respect to ML, 
which is modeled using the generalized logistic function. 
The logistic function is a widely used sigmoid function for 
growth/decay 
modeling 
where 
the 
growth/decay 
is 
exponential at first, but eventually slower and then levels 
off. This matches the way RP is reduced with the increase of

where a and b indicate the minimum and maximum

while d signify the time for maximum growth (see Fig. 6). 
Furthermore, Fig. 5 also shows that the slope of the RP 
plot for different GOP sizes is the same. Therefore, RP is 
modeled equal to: 
 
 
(8) 
where ωRp is the bitrate of P-frame when GOP=2 and ML=1, 
and ω2 is the weight for f(GOP). To obtain the parameters 
for the f(ML),  we applied least mean square approach using 
the normalized RP of training video sequences when 
GOP=2. Also to estimate f(GOP), we applied curve fitting 
approach on the Rp values of training video sequences at 
different GOP size settings, and found that ω2⋅ln(GOP) 
provides a good estimate for f(GOP). The value of ω2 is 
estimated using least square regression from the training 
sequences. Assuming that the average bitrate of an I-frame 
is equal to RI the average bitrate of a frame (Rf) is estimated 
as:

D. Implementation of the Proposed Model 
To implement the proposed model, we need to obtain 
several variables from each video sequence. To this end, we 
encode the first two frames of each video sequence. 
Assuming that there is no scene change in the video 
sequence, the bitrate of each I-frame will be almost similar. 
Therefore, RI is assumed to be equal to the bitrate of the 
encoded first frame while ωRp is equal to the bitrate of the 
second frame. For the complexity modeling, the iprof tool 
will provide us with the complexity of encoding the first 
two frames of the video sequence, i.e., C2-frames=CI+
. 
Since we already have the value of RI from encoding the 
first two frames of each test sequence, we can estimate the 
value of CI of these sequences. The value of 
can then 
be calculated using C2-frames – CI. Consequently, the value of 
ω1 is calculated using (2). 
To estimate the modeling error, the average percentage of 
complexity and bitrate error for GOP={1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 
64} and ML={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} is calculated. As Table III 
shows, the average error for complexity modeling is less 
than or equal to 3.45% for the test video sequences, while 
the average error of bitrate modeling is less than or equal to 
11.6% as reported in Table IV.

ENCODING AND TRANSMISSION POWER

where λ is a constant coefficient representing energy cost 
for receiving 1 bit. Table V shows the parameters used for 
our experiments. 
In this paper, we analyze a simple topology consisting of 
one video node and the sink. The total power consumption 
of a video node for different transmission distances for 
PeopleOnStreet video sequence is shown in Fig. 7. In this 
figure, we analyze two scenarios: a) the GOP size is fixed 
while the ML varies, and b) the ML is fixed while the GOP 
size changes. In Fig. 7a, the GOP size is set equal to eight 
and ML changes. It is observed that for transmission distance 
less than 200m, the use of bigger ML results in higher total 
power consumption. This result shows that varying ML 
values do not significantly affect the trade-off between 
computation and communication. This trend is also seen in 
other test video sequences.  
Fig. 7b shows the plot of total power consumption when 
ML is equal to four and the GOP size changes. The figure 
shows that when the transmission distance is small, the 
configuration that leads to low power consumption is the 
one using smaller GOP. It means that the low encoding 
power consumption (due to the use of smaller GOP) is 
compensating the higher transmission power consumption 
(due to higher bitrate). However, when the transmission 
distance is large, the energy cost to transmit the data 
increased significantly. Therefore, we need to use the 
configuration with better compression performance, i.e., 
larger GOP size, to reduce the transmission energy 
consumption.  
The trade-off between computation and communication 
can be clearly seen when the transmission distance is less 
than 100m as shown in Fig. 8. However, it can be seen that 
the transmission distance at which the use of bigger GOP 
minimizes power consumption is content dependent. For 
example, in the case of PeopleOnStreet video sequence, 
using GOP equal to one will minimize the total power 
consumption when the transmission distance is less than 
63m (see Fig. 8a). However, for the RaceHorses video 
sequence, the use of GOP equal to one will minimize total 
power consumption when the transmission distance is less 
than 88m (see Fig. 8b).

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we propose the encoding complexity and 
bitrate model of H.264-based video sensor networks. The 
experimental results show that the proposed complexity 
model provides a very small prediction error (less than or 
equal to 3.45%), while the bitrate modeling error is from 
8.57% to 11.6% for the video sequences tested. The 
proposed model is used to show the trade-off between 
encoding and communication that can be exploited to 
minimize the total power consumption of VSNs.
