Abstract— There are several forms of electricity generation,
first, by burning fuels, such as coal, natural gas or oil, which
have an effect
on the atmosphere, especially increasing
greenhouse gases, or, second, from renewable sources, such as
wind, hydro and solar, which are clean and renewable sources
of energy. Our work focuses on solar sources, especially
photovoltaics; we have treated the steering part of photovoltaic
generators using artificial intelligence methods, specifically,
case-based reasoning.
The system we have built generates
actions to be applied to the generator based on its current state
and reasoning from previous cases recorded in the case base.
Keywords-

I.
INTRODUCTION
Algeria is one of the sunniest countries in the world.
Consequently, there are many programs for the installation
of huge photovoltaic (PV) stations [17]. In PV systems, we
face three important problems: sizing, diagnosis and fault
detection, and tracking the maximum power point. These
problems
need
to
be addressed
before setting
up
a
photovoltaic
generator.
Our
intervention
is
in
the
maintenance, as well as detection of faults of the PV
generator; it helps regulate the operation of the generator to
achieve its objectives. This is achieved by the application
we developed to steer the PV generator using a case-based
reasoning methodology and
intervenes
automatically
to
regulate the effects of an anomaly.
PV generators connected to the grid are usually located in
isolated areas where human intervention is late or absent.
The objectives of our system are:

Improve generator productivity by decreasing the defects
of the solar panels. This is done by reconfiguring the
generator to achieve maximum production of the non-
faulty modules.

Increase the availability of the generator keeping the
generator in partial production state when a failure has
occurred.

Increase the life of the system in the case of partial
shading of the module that generates the hot spot and
automatically isolates the module and invokes the
maintenance team when it persists over time.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2
concerns the related
works. We present the steering
functions and its problematics in Section 3. Section 4 is
dedicated to the approach of artificial intelligence followed
case-based
reasoning
(CBR).
Section
5
presents
the
objectives and multiple configurations of the proposed
steering system. The deployment of the proposed system
with the different stages of CBR and the tests of presented
cases are discussed in Section 6. Finally, we conclude our
work presenting perspectives in Section 7.

RELATED WORKS
Research in the supervision and management of PV
systems is increasing not only in Algeria but also in the rest
of the world. In the photovoltaic field, most researches are
focused on dimensioning, diagnosis, fault detection and
maximum power point tracking problematic. Hence, several
artificial intelligence methods are used such as fuzzy logic,
neuronal networks and genetic algorithms to solve these
problematics. In this paper, we address another problematic
namely, the photovoltaic field steering, which is not directly
addressed in other works. So, in the state of the art, we will
mention some research works that solve problematics that
have an influence on the photovoltaic steering problematic.
We start with fault detection using artificial intelligence
techniques. Fault detection is a crucial task to increase the
reliability, efficiency and safety of photovoltaic systems.
The detection and manual removal of faults in photovoltaic
systems is very expensive, and, in some cases, impossible,
like the photovoltaic systems of satellites. Therefore,
automatic fault detection techniques are required [1].
Several methods are used, because of the non-linear
nature of the photovoltaic system and some faults are
difficult to detect by conventional protection devices. Zhao
et al. [2] proposed in their work a model based semi-
supervised learning graph for the detection of faults. The
proposed model not only detects defects, but also identifies
their possible type. In another work, Zhao et al. [3]
developed
a
decision
tree
model
for
detecting
and
classifying photovoltaic field faults. This model analyzes
the current-voltage characteristic (I-V) to make detections.
Artificial intelligence techniques are also used for the
detection of faults. Zhihua et al. [4] have used neural
networks in their work for the detection of faults. At first,
the temperature of the module determines the occurrence of
defects in a photovoltaic module. Then, the artificial neuron
is used to make the diagnosis and define the type of defect.
The input parameters of the neuron are: temperature,
current, and voltage, while the output is the detection result.
Inside of the fault detection, the maximum power point

tracking is an important issue in the photovoltaic field. The
Maximum Power Point (MPPT) tracking technique is an
important requirement in improving the efficiency of power
extraction from PV modules. The main goal of all MPPT
techniques is to extract the true maximum power of the PV
module in any atmospheric condition. However, in the
conditions of rapid climate change and partial shading,
conventional techniques have not been able to follow the
true peak power point. For this reason, artificial intelligence
methods have been developed with the ability to search for
the true maximum power point with a good convergence
speed [5].
Patchara Prakriti et al. [6] have proposed a method of
tracking maximum power points using an adaptive fuzzy
controller for PV systems connected to the network. From
simulation and experimental results, the adaptive blur
controller can provide more power than the conventional
blur controller. Bahgat et al. [7] presented a maximum
power point tracking algorithm for photovoltaic systems
using neural networks. According to the authors, the
experimental results showed that the photovoltaic plant with
MPPT always listens to the maximum power point of the
PV module under various operating conditions. The MPPT
transmits approximately 97% of the actual maximum power
generated by the photovoltaic module.
III. THE STEERING FUNCTIONS AND PROBLEMATICS
A.
The steering of production process
The steering is the function of controlling the future and
immediate behaviour of the production process according to
a given process to achieve the production objectives
expressed in terms of quality and productivity [8].
The steering is responsible for carrying out the planned
production. It must solve all the problems that are not solved
by the forecast level (local loads or constraints). It must also
take into account all the manufacturing constraints (quality
control, maintenance-related downtime, staff qualification
level, etc.), all present at this level, and react to hazards so
that the planned production be possible.
Figure 1. Position of the steering in supervision process [13]
Figure 1 shows the position of steering in the supervision
process of production system. It is jointed to action after
decision supported by the preliminary steps of surveillance,
detection and diagnosis.
We can distinguish three main classes of functions of
steering to ensure:
• Communication: with the scheduling function (recovery of
forward orders and transmission of order tracking), with
the order of the production system (sending orders for
launch, control and reception of real-time monitoring),
with the other industrial functions (request for intervention,
analysis,
taking
into
account
urgent orders,
transfer
availabilities, etc.);
• Data management: concerning products, resources, tasks to
be performed;
• Historical and statistical: equipment breakdown statistics,
team activity, time spent by batch, by product, etc.
B.
The steering problematics
Here,
we
discuss
the
problems
of operating
and
analysing steering systems [9].

Exploitation: the problem of operating the steering
systems can be seen as a particularization of man-
machine cooperation problems. In the field of human-
machine cooperation, horizontal cooperation is defined as
a means of regulating the human activity of supervision
by means of a division of tasks between the operator and
a decision-making tool. In vertical cooperation, the tool
only offers advice to the operator who remains the final
decision maker. The difficulty of operating the steering
system lies in the division of tasks between the human
operator and the material part of the system. Some
authors
advocate
permanently
keeping
the
human
operator in the steering loop by regulating his workload.

Analysis: the analysis of a control system uses, at least in
the same way as its design and operation, very complex
and highly variable interpretative processes. Based on
purely quantitative criteria, the difficulty of the analysis
is due to the causal and temporal distances between the
implementation of the steering system and the resulting
performance. On a more qualitative level, the analysis of
the steering system is based on the value it brings to the
different actors of the production system: better feedback
on everyone's actions, facilitation of monitoring and
diagnostic tasks, better organization of the workshop, etc.
IV. CASE-BASED REASONNING
Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is an approach for solving
and learning problems. A new problem or case is solved by
remembering (recalling) similar cases already pre-analyzed
and stored in memory. The solution found is then adapted
(reused) to the new problem. The new case is then revised
or repaired (by the expert or by the use of the general
knowledge of the system). This new case can also be
learned
from
the
system
(memorization)
as
a
new
experience [10][11]. The CBR approach reduces knowledge

acquisition efforts. It allows the use of existing data and can
adapt to changes in their environment. Figure 2 illustrates
the CBR cycle:

Retrieve: Recovery of previously experienced similar
cases
(e.g.,
solution-problem-result
triples)
whose
problem is deemed similar.

Reuse: propose a solution to solve the new problem
using information and knowledge of the recovered case.

Revise: aims to evaluate the applicability of the proposed
solution.

Memorize: Maintaining the new solution once it has
been confirmed or validated.
Figure 2. Case-based reasonning process [14]
In many practical applications, the reuse and revision
stages are sometimes difficult to distinguish, and many
researchers use a single adaptation phase that replaces and
combines them. However, fitting into a RAC system is still
an open question because it is a complicated process that
tries to manipulate case solutions. The cases recorded in the
case base have been enriched by general knowledge, which
often depends on the domain of the problem [12]. The
selection of an appropriate method for each step depends on
the problem and requires knowledge in the field of
application. In situations where information is incomplete or
missing and we want to exploit tolerance for inaccuracy,
uncertainty,
rough
reasoning,
and

techniques
could
provide
solutions
with
traceability, robustness, and low cost.
V.
PRINCIPLES AND MULTIPLE CONFIGURATIONS OF THE
PROPOSED STEERING SYSTEM USING CBR
A.
Architecture of the proposed steering system and case
presentation
Figure 3 illustrates the global architecture of the
developed steering system. It contains a formulation of
cases to set them as a vector of attributes, a case
management, a history management and an automatic
steering (the cycle of CBR).
Figure 3. Architecture of the proposed steering system
The case is a state of photovoltaic generator represented
by attribute vector to be usable by CBR (Figure 4).
Figure 4. Generator state (target case) attributes
A case is composed of two parts: the problem part and
the solution part. The attributes of a case are represented in
Figure 4.
B.
Principles of the application of CBR process in the
proposed steer system
Retrieve: Select the most similar cases calculating the
distance between the appeared case and the cases of the base
cases. We used the types of distances in a developed system
and the user has to choose one of them.

Distance between blocks,
(1)

Euclidian distance with weights,
(2)
The first (1) method only measures the distance between
2 cases; however, the second (2) allows us to give
importance to attributes that others and exclude some by
giving them a 0 weight because in reality not all attributes
have the same importance. It is noted that in the second
method the sum of the weights must be equal to one (1) [14].
The calculation is done only on the problem part of the case.
The objective of the calculation of the distance is to find the

closest cases to the target case (problem), from the base case.
We chose the K nearest neighbors method with K=3 to find
the 3 closest cases to the target.
Reuse: is the proposal of a solution to solve the new
problem by reusing information and knowledge of the three
cases found. If the distance is zero (0), the solution is
reproduced. If not, an adaptation step is necessary.
Adaptation of the case: The adaptation of the cases
consists in giving a coherent solution, one must not find
contradictions between the values of the problem part and
the solution part. The verification is done using rules of type
"if condition then result":
IF <Action on module = Replace and type of failure =
Sane>
Then incoherent values
For each attribute of the solution of the nearest case:
•
IF <the value conflicts with the attributes of the problem
part of the target case>
Then we move to the values of the next case.
•
IF <all the values of the three cases are in conflict>
Then the case is recorded in the database of untreated
cases.
Revise: It validates the obtained solution, by evaluation
with simulation using a model of the generator. After
application of the solution:
IF < PE/PT>minimum threshold>
Then the solution is registered in the base.
Otherwise the case is recorded in the database of
unprocessed cases.
C.
Generator models
Calculation of the generated current: The photovoltaic
cells could be presented with one diode or bishop model
(Figure 5a, Figure 5b).
Figure 5a. One diode model [15]
Figure 5b. Bishope model [16]
The bishope model takes the avalanche effect of the cell
into consideration by adding to the diode model a nonlinear
multiplier in series with the shunt resistor. The user will
configure the developed system according to the PV cells
used. The electric currents generated are obviously different.
These were calculated according to different formulas.
D.
Calculation of current and voltage
The current and the voltage of the PV generator are
calculated by the formulas (3) and (4) respectively.
•
Igenerator= Nstring x Nmodule x Ncell x Icell
(3)
•
Vgenerator = Mmodule x Mgroupe x Mcell x Vcell
(4)
Where
•
Nstring: number of strings in parallel ;
•
Nmodule: number of groups of modules in parallel in a
string;
•
Ncellule: number of groups of cells in parallel in a module;
•
Mmodule: number of modules in series in a string;
•
Mgroupe: number of groups of cells in series in a module;
•
Mcellule: number of cells in series in a cell group;

General operation of proposed steering system
Figure 6 presents the proposed generic algorithm of the
steering system.
Figure 6. General operation of steering system
The proposed system was developed with LabVIEW
(Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench). It
is ideal for data acquisition, automation and instrument
control. The integrated user interfaces make it easy to use
and apply, and, they offer a rapid prototyping.
VI. DEPLOYEMENT OF THE PROPOSED STEERING SYSTEM

modules: system status, system settings, model of the
photovoltaic cell, test & simulation and historical. Figure 7

The results of the tests are acceptable. For the cases
TestCase 1 and TestCase 2, the obtained solutions are the
optimal ones. The most similar case to TestCase 1 is Case 1,
so the solution part of this case is applied. The same is true
for TestCase 2, the most similar case is Case 2. The result
obtained for TestCase 3 is great. The system finds that the
most similar case is Case 4, whose solution is tilt
adjustment. The system automatically provides the exact
angle of inclination based on the situation information
geographical location and the current date.
The adjustment of this anomaly is to enrich the case base
with this case by assigning the correct solution to it, or
assigning a weight to the attribute "tracking system".

However, the result of TestCase 4 is not optimal. It can
be seen that the PE/PT ratio is less than 0.85 and the
solution contains no action. So, we analyse how the system
handled this case. We found that the most similar case for
TestCase 4 is Case 4, so the system takes its part solution is
goes to the adaptation stage of the solution. In the tilt
adjustment attribute, the system finds a conflict: "tilt angle
setting but the tracker system exists and is running", in
which case the system proceeds to the next similar case
solution and applies the adaptation rules on it. It finds it to
be valid, despite the fact that it is not optimal.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Oil is an exhaustible energy, so renewable energies are
those of the future. In our work, we have presented the
renewable
sources
available
in
Algeria
and
their
exploitation, the methods of artificial intelligence used in
the supervision and finally the reasoned steering based on
cases. The current exploitation of renewable energies is not
extensive, but the program launched for the development of
these energies gives importance to these energies, especially
photovoltaics.
In
our
work,
we
have
illustrated
that
photovoltaic solar installations require real-time monitoring
of
their
operation
to
increase
their
production
and
availability. This is done by steering. Our steering system
generates the right actions to apply to the generator when its
state changes using the case-based reasoning methodology.
During this work, we found that the use of case-based
reasoning methodology is tricky, especially in the choice of
type of case representation and similarity and adaptation
calculation methods. The richness of the case base has an
important influence on the quality of the solutions obtained.
The richer the base, the more appropriate the solutions.
As a perspective, we propose to add to this application a
generator fault detection subsystem, an automatic optimal
reconfiguration subsystem for better production and a
system that allows the exchange of cases between the
systems implanted in different sites.
