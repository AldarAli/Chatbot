Abstract—3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Evolved 
Packet Core (EPC) are the most advanced technologies in the 
wireless and mobility field, since they provide high speed data 
and various sophisticated applications to Mobile Users. LTE is 
a key technology to various high speed applications, which 
require efficient performance. Packet Jitter is one of the most 
important performance parameters for those applications. 
Thus, several researches have been conducted in the LTE radio 
layer to study the Jitter performance, but they lack the EPC 
core network layer effect. This paper presents intensive 
simulation study of LTE-EPC traffic Jitter performance over 
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) core network using a 
Poisson Process traffic generator. MPLS is proposed in 
conjunction with the EPC to provide better efficiency in 
modern integrated networks in terms of packet Jitter 
variations, which is shown to be much better than IP routing 
trends. The simulation investigates both of the IP and MPLS 
models, and evaluates the end-to-end performance. The MPLS 
Model is simulated by MPLS core routers attached to the 
Packet Data Gateway (P-GW) EPC data plane, while the IP 
model uses IP core routers instead. These two models are fed 
by a Poisson traffic source, which matches the statistical 
properties of real-time IP Internet traffic. The Jitter 
performance of the two LTE-EPC models shows the 
enhancement caused by MPLS.

I. INTRODUCTION 
3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) [1]‎[2]‎[3] is the most 
advanced wireless technology implemented nowadays. LTE 
is a high speed wireless technology based on Orthogonal 
Frequency-Division 
Multiple 
Access 
(OFDMA) 
on 
downlink and Single Carrier Orthogonal Frequency-Division 
Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) in uplink. The advanced LTE 
technology in wireless access is integrated with the EPC, 
which is the core network data carrying all network related 
procedures (e.g., mobility management and session 
management, etc.). The 3GPP organization defines the 
EUTRAN ‎[1] and EPC  ‎[2]‎[3] as the main architecture of the 
LTE-EPC Network. As shown in Figure 1, LTE-EPC is 
composed of Evolved Node B (eNodeB), Mobility 
Management Entity (MME), Home Subscriber Server (HSS), 
Serving Gateway (S-GW), Policy Control Charging Rules 
Function (PCRF), and P-GW.  
EPC supports various applications including web 
browsing, video streaming, machine-to-machine, peer-to-
peer, VoIP applications, video conferences, and social 
networking. All of these emerging IP applications are 
pushing the research communities to produce optimized 
network simulation model, not only for the LTE radio but 
also for the corresponding core network ‎[4], which is 
noticeable in the Advanced Long Term Evolution (LTE-A) 
research plans. In this paper, the end-to-end LTE-EPC 
research is studied using NS-3 simulator, which is an open 
source simulator with a satisfactory level of accuracy to run 
network simulation under Linux system machine ‎[5]. A 
previously published work on LTE ‎[6] is used to simulate 
UE, 
eNodeB, 
and 
S/P-GW 
with 
the 
user 
plane 
characteristics. 
The 
end-to-end 
LTE-EPC 
model 
is 
introduced by UDP transport between the source and the 
destination to test the EPC IP based solutions. 
A realistic traffic model is introduced by Poisson process 
traffic source. This model generates a long range dependent 
traffic, which can be viewed as the asymptotic case of heavy-
tailed on-off sources‎[7]. Normal Poisson source cannot be 
used to model mobile networks ‎[12] because it fails to 
simulate Long Range Dependent (LRD) traffic streams used 
in broadband networks ‎[8]‎[10]‎[11]. Therefore, a natural 
candidate is introduced to model the LRD packet data traffic 
streams. Modern research papers ‎[13] proved that Poisson 
Pareto Burst Process (PPBP) model provides an accurate 
model of the aggregated mobile user traffic because of its 
observations of heavy tail behavior of flow volumes and 
durations in mobile networks ‎[14]. 
The majority of the existing NS-3 LTE research papers 
target the radio mobility ‎[15] and related procedures, such as  
handover scenarios, algorithms ‎[16], and LTE schedulers 
‎[17], which are concentrated at the eNodeB interfaces like 
S1-U interface. It is clear that such researches lack the core 
EPC connectivity and performance with respect to the radio 
interface technology. However, due to the higher layers 
services demand, the behavior of the network as end-to-end 
is mandatory to our design. Since it is obvious that all-IP 
evolution has been the trend of LTE-EPC, LTE EPC user 
plane ‎[18]‎[19] is used this paper and integrated with the 
MPLS technology with the appropriate traffic model. PPBP 
is selected as an Internet traffic type to analyze its 
characteristics with respect to traffic Jitter, which is 
evaluated in case of IP network without MPLS. MPLS is a 
well-known technology, which is widely used in modern 
network design as a replacement for the traditional IP 
networks since it copes the IP network shortcomings ‎[20]. In 
fact, to the best of our knowledge, there is no previously 
published MPLS-based approach for LTE-EPC core 
networks with PPBP IP Internet traffic performance

evaluation. But, previous work was done on integrating 
MPLS with UMTS ‎[21]. 
The ultimate objective of the presented simulation is to 
become widely accepted evaluation reference for LTE-EPC 
and MPLS integration systems. LTE-EPC architecture, 
which was already developed by ‎[6] is integrated with MPLS 
core network traffic engineering strategies and investigated 
the performance with PPBP Internet traffic to have an end-
to-end vision. Poisson parameters were modeled based on 
real life network readings, which can be changed from one 
network to another based on the operator and country 
profiles. 
The rest of the paper is consists of four sections. Section 
II explains the high level design aspects of the proposed 
EPC architecture, and the NS-3 limitation with respect to 
the LTE technology, the EPC connectivity and the used 
uplink/downlink traffic design, while Section III details our 
design implementation steps in terms of LTE radio 
parameter 
values, 
Poisson 
source 
design, 
MPLS 
architecture, and EPC NS-3 configuration. The simulation 
results and analysis are provided in section IV. Finally, 
Section V concludes the paper.  
II. DESIGN CRITERIA AND ARCHITECTURE 
The EPC-MPLS module that is presented in this paper 
aims to evaluate and compare the Jitter of the two 
investigated modes under realistic traffic source. The Internet 
traffic model is Poisson, which is based on overlapped 
multiple bursts with heavy-tailed distributed lengths. The 
focus here is on the EPC data plane, the EPC control plane is 
currently outside our scope. The simulation focus is on EPS 
connection management (ECM) connected mode; ECM idle 
mode is not a part of the simulation. The uplink and 
downlink are separated in two different Traffic Flow Types 
(TFT). IPv4 is considered in this simulation but IPv6 is not 
yet included. One S/P-GW is selected in the design to 
simplify the simulation model without affecting the 
conclusive results. 
The simulation is done once with IP static Routers as 
shown in Figure 2; and secondly, with MPLS routers, as in 
Figure 3. Both of the simulation scenarios run on the same 
throughput and PPBP parameters; therefore, the IP and 
MPLS cases are compared at the same conditions. The

network topology supported by the proposed simulation is 
composed of two parts: the LTE-EPC part and MPLS part. 
LTE-EPC model includes, as in ‎[18]‎[19], the radio protocol 
stack (PDCP, RLC, MAC, and physical) and the core part. 
As shown in Figure 3, MPLS portion is composed of three 
parts namely, LER, LSR, and LER; and finally, the 
application server running over UDP protocol. 
The system architecture shown in Figure 3 represents an 
end-to-end LTE-EPC with MPLS core network and UDP 
server. Our case study is to evaluate the MPLS design flow 
and the end-to-end data delivery for LTE traffic. The MPLS 
uplink traffic is assigned with label different from the MPLS 
downlink traffic such that each Label Edge Router (LER) 
pushes a different label to the packets depending on the their 
flow. The Label Switch Router (LSR) does a packet swap to 
replace the initially pushed label with an intermediate one. 
At the other end, LER removes the labels and deliver the 
packets to the destination. 
III. IMPLEMENTATION 
LTE-EPC diagram is divided into three different layers, as 
illustrated in Figure 4. The first layer is the LTE radio layer, 
which‎involves‎the‎UE‎connectivity‎to‎UE’s. The EPC core 
is the second one and it involves the eNodeB IP connectivity 
to S/P-GW. Finally, the third layer is the application, which 
involves the S/P-GW connectivity to the application part. 
The following subsections describe those layers. 
A. Poisson Traffic Generator 
The used traffic source is Poisson traffic generator ‎[7], 
which is a process based on multiple overlapping bursts, 
where the burst lengths follow a heavy-tailed distribution. 
So, it appears to reflect the basic properties of at least some 
aggregated data traffic; and it is based on the models that are 
closely‎ related‎ to‎ the‎ M/G/∞‎ models as shown in Eq. (1), 
where the bursts arrive according to a rate (λ). The packet 
length follows a Pareto distribution characterized by Hurst 
parameter H, typically between 0.5 and 0.9, and a 
mean burst time length Ton . Each burst is modeled by a 
flow of constant bit rate (r), as shown in Eq. (2), and 
overlapping bursts form aggregated long range dependent 
traffic with burst length of infinite variance ‎[14]. For our 
design, the PPBP mean burst arrival is selected to be 10, and 
the mean burst time length to be 0.1, which matches the 
statistical properties of selected real-life IP Internet traffic. 
Thus, the burst data rate equals to the bursts‎arrival‎rate‎λ‎as 
shown in Eq. (3). The data rate speed is simulated from 
1Mbps up to a maximum throughput of 17.568 Mbps, which 
is selected based on the radio interface design;

where 1Mbps < r <17.568 Mbps andλpis the mean burst 
arrival, Ton  is the mean burst time length, λ is the bursts 
arrival rate. 
B. LTE Radio layer 
Significant radio parameters are used to simulate real 
traffic. NS3 Proportional Fair MAC Scheduler (PF) is used 
and the path loss is based on Friis spectrum propagation loss 
mode. The uplink/downlink bandwidth and related physical 
parameters are illustrated in TABLE I. The user is simulated 
at a negligible distance, i.e., zero downlink distance with 
MCS 28 (modulation and coding scheme) and transport 
block size (tbs) 26. From tables 7.1.7.2.1-1 of 3GPP 36.213 
‎[23] one user at 24 Physical Resource Block (PRB), tbs 26 
and packet size of 2196 would give a maximum throughput 
of 2196000 bytes/sec that is 17.568 Mbps. Therefore, all of 
our simulations would have a maximum throughput of 
17.568Mbps. 
C. EPC Core Layer 
As per ‎[6], UE is assigned a public IPv4 address in the 
7.0.0.0/8 network and the PGW is getting address 7.0.0.1, 
which is used as a gateway to all UEs to the Internet. All of 
the eNodeB is implemented with a set of point-to-point links 
towards the S/P-GW. By default, a 10.x.y.z/30 subnet is 
assigned to each point-to-point link. Different TFT instances 
are assigned based on local/remote IP address, and port 
number for uplink and downlink. Each TFT is mapped to a 
special packet and a special class creating two separate 
bearers for uplink and downlink traffic. This would add the 
advantage for traffic segregation on the LTE Radio, EPC 
core, and furthermore, on the MPLS core layer.

D. MPLS Core layer 
The third layer adds an end-to-end IP communication 
using MPLS core site. Subnet 192.168.1.0/30 is allocated 
between router and remote host, subnet 192.168.1.4/30 is 
allocated between router and S/P-GW, and private subnets 
10.1.1.0/24 and 10.1.3.0/24 are assigned internally between 
MPLS routers. The MPLS process implemented by NS-3 
simulator is powerful as it simulates the main rule of the 
MPLS label switching such as the Forwarding-Equivalence-
Class to Next-Hop-Label Forwarding-Entry (FEC-to-
NHLFE) map, which is a mapping from the FEC of any 
incoming packets to corresponding NHLFEs. The main task 
is the Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry (NHLFE), which 
represents an entry containing next-hop information 
(interface and next-hop address) and label manipulation 
instructions. It also contains all information required for 
processing packets such as label encoding, L2 encapsulation 
information, and others. The second main task is the 
Incoming Label Map (ILM) that maps the incoming labels to 
corresponding NHLFEs, which is mainly found in the 
intermediate nodes for fast label switching such as LSR. 
IV. DATA SIMULATION AND VERIFICATION 
The simulation is composed of two parts: the LTE-EPC 
part and MPLS part. The NS-3 LTE-EPC model includes the 
radio protocol stack (PDCP, RLC, MAC, and physical) and 
the core part resides with S-GW and P-GW; and it includes 
the GTP protocol. The MPLS nodes include the three types, 
LER, LSR, and LER. The application server, which runs 
over UDP protocol, represents the traffic source. Figure 4 
represents the end-to-end LTE-EPC with MPLS core 
network and UDP server. This setup allows us to validate the 
MPLS network efficiency from the user plane point of view. 
The user traffic is a PPBP UDP client-server model. The 
simulation is done with a normal MPLS routing versus a 
normal IP routing protocol, as in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The 
MPLS traffic is separated into uplink/downlink traffic in 
different paths via the traffic engineering with VPN label 
designed. 
A. Simulation Inputs 
Regarding to the simulation inputs, the simulation time is 
5 seconds, the maximum speed supported by the NS-3 
simulator RLC model is 17.568 Mbps according to the used 
scheduling technique. Accordingly, specific values are 
selected for verification from a speed of 10Mbps up to 
17Mbps with a step of 1Mbps.The packet size is selected to 
be 512 Bytes; the mean burst arrivals to be 10, and the mean 
burst time length to be 0.1, which matches the statistical 
properties of real-life selected IP Internet traffic. 
B. Simulation Results 
This paper provides the Jitter histogram comparison 
between the two introduced architectures at different selected 
data throughputs. The throughput is selected to be 13Mbps, 
15Mbps and 17 Mbps. The effect of MPLS is clearly 
noticeable with respect to the Jitter variation of the packets. 
The packets received by the UDP server using MPLS 
technology is having higher values at lower Jitter counts and 
the histogram is concentrated at the lower Jitter values, as 
shown in Figures 5, 6, and 7. 
The MPLS Jitter variation is enhanced with a much 
narrower curve and higher probability of low Jitter, this 
effect is mainly concentrated at lower speed values. As 
44

shown in Figure 5, at 13 Mbps, MPLS had a maximum Jitter 
value of 0.032, and the IP had a maximum Jitter value of 
0.036, i.e., MPLS has a better performance than IP. 
Furthermore, at higher data throughputs, MPLS effect is 
clearly noticeable. As shown in Figure 6, at 15 Mbps, 
MPLS Jitter increased to 0.42 while IP increased to 0.49. 
The difference between MPLS maximum Jitter and IP 
maximum Jitter increased at 17 Mbps, which is shown in 
Figure 7 with 0.051 for MPLS Jitter and 0.083 for IP Jitter. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Jitter histogram at 13Mbps 
 
Figure 6. Jitter histogram at 15 Mbps 
 
Figure 7. Jitter histogram at 17Mbps 
A mathematical calculation is done to prove the MPLS 
advantage with respect to IP routers. For each of the 
simulation trials, the maximum Jitter is calculated and 
counted for the IP and the MPLS system as in TABLE II. 
Furthermore, TABLE II defines Jitter Enhancement 
Percentage (𝜌) and in the average, it is calculated to be the 
difference between IP maximum Jitter and MPLS maximum 
Jitter as shown in Eq.(4). The IP maximum Jitter is assumed 
to be (β), and the MPLS maximum Jitter is assumed to be 
(𝛼). 
Thus, 
𝜌 =
100∗ (𝛽 − 𝛼)

                                                                                         (4) 
The Jitter enhancement percentage is calculated through 
multiple simulation trial. The Maximum value is 38.55 % at 
17Mbps and the lowest values is 16% at 11 Mbps. The 
average value is calculated over the simulation trials and it 
is found to be 19.9%, which is a reasonable effect. Thus, the 
packet Jitter increases with the throughput for both the IP 
and MPLS, where for the IP it is increasing more rapidly and 
for the MPLS the curve is more declined with a lower Jitter.

Figure 8. MPLS Maximum Jitter Values 
MPLS maximum Jitter is plotted versus the simulation 
throughput in Figure 8. It is found that the MPLS maximum 
Jitter is increasing slightly with respect to the throughput, 
which is much better than the IP trends 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The introduced core MPLS network approach is a novel 
one. This paper provided an overview of the design criteria 
using an MPLS label switching and normal IP routing to 
provide the LTE-EPC network manufacturer detailed 
analysis. MPLS packet Jitter variation is better than the 
normal IP routing trends. The Jitter simulation results proved 
that the effect of the MPLS is clearly noticeable, where the 
MPLS have a better performance with respect to UDP server 
received packets with lower Jitter and minimum variance. 
MPLS clearly enhanced the packet Jitter variations as

already discussed in the simulation graphs. A mathematical 
analysis is done, which shows that MPLS improves the 
network Jitter enhancement percentage parameter with 
average 19.9 %. This is not only the gain because MPLS has 
a lot of add features as well. If more MPLS features are 
added, such as load balancing, service resilience, and QoS 
support of LTE-EPC network, MPLS will be much more 
efficient with respect to packet forwarding through the 
MPLS labels, better load balancing through the MPLS traffic 
engineering, and better service resilience with respect to 
restoration of core networks disaster. Moreover, MPLS end-
to-end QoS is enhanced compared to that of IP. 
Further research point can address the challenges for Wi-
Fi and LTE-U with MPLS technology. This point should be 
important one for LTE-U, which is a new LTE technology 
developed for the unlicensed band ‎[24].
