Abstract— Credit card fraud describes cases in which a threat
actor gains unauthorized access in order to obtain money or
property. The importance of machine learning and Data
Science cannot be over emphasized. This work develops an
efficient
fraud
detection framework using
non-rule-based
approach of Multi-layer perceptron. It correctly predicts and
detects frauds on a given financial transaction dataset. The
algorithm on the datasets evaluates its effectiveness vis-à-vis
frauds
detection
in
bank
transactions.
The
results
are
compared and evaluated using various evaluation metrics.
Keywords- fraud; credit cards; Multi-layer perceptron;

INTRODUCTION
Recent
information
technology
(IT)
proliferation
deployed in major financial services by Nigerian banking
institutions has led to an increase in threats posed to these
systems. Debit/Credit cards are one of the most common
payment methods used over the Internet. It was asserted that
financial fraud can be viewed as an act intended for
deception involving financial transactions for personal gain
purpose [1]. Fraudsters have it easier as most transactions do
not require the presence of a bank account/card holder;
stealing relevant customers details or perform identity theft
by posing as the customer at point of payments is all that is
vital to perpetrating their acts. This includes phishing and
unsuspecting customers, redirection to malicious websites
with a hidden act of harvesting customers’ banking details
and information. Credit card fraud is equally viewed as a
type of theft and fraud done using a payment card, as a
fraudulent fund source in a transaction. Some security issues
are mostly faced by banks everywhere, but the prevention of
card fraud attracts high priority, and this is set to grow with
the exponential rate of Internet awareness and transactions.
Increase in online purchases has made criminals take
advantage of various weak authentication checks to commit
credit card fraud [2].
Models provide a way to mitigate these occurrences,
protect clients’ transactions and play an essential role in
payment service providers’ profitability and sustainability.
All the aforementioned can be achieved using a fraud
detection system (FDS). FDS is computational analysis
fraud
detection
techniques
via
fraud
identification
or
anomaly transactions in swift and proven techniques of
machine learning as presented in [3]. Modeling of past credit
card transactions has to do with detecting fraudulent
transactions via the existing knowledge fraud. This model is
then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent
or not in the two major existing fraud methods of physical
and virtual frauds. Physical fraud is done by stealing a card
and using it for the payment or purchasing while virtual
fraud is committed by using someone’s card details through
the internet for transactions. Further classification of credit
card fraud is given in Figure.1. Section I deals with the
introduction of various acts of fraud. A guide to available
credit card fraud is presented in Section II, while Section III
gives a detail of related study in the fraud detection domain.
In Section IV, multilayer perceptron methodology approach
to fraud detection is extensively discussed. Implementation
of a feed forward Artificial Neural Network for the machine
learning approach is presented in Section V in addition to
Section VI which further shows the implementation with
various parameters. Observations from the proposed model
and evaluation is given in Section VII with the performance
of the Logistic regression study based on the same dataset.

MAJOR METHODS USED TO MITIGATE CREDIT CARD
There are basically two major forms of mitigating credit card
fraud, it could be in the preventive or detective mode. The
preventive mode involves blocking fraudulent transaction at

the point of transaction. Such as passwords, pin and blocked
cards; while the detective mode identifies successful fraud
transaction through predictive models with machine learning
approach.
Traditionally, fraud resolution process usually involves:
fraud detection, investigation, confirmation, and prevention.
Therefore, a self-learning computer program automates the
above processes using various methods. Signature based
detection method detects fraud traces through the signature
technology using known patterns or byte sequence, it is
efficient
for known
frauds. However, fraudsters
have
continued to manipulate the system by finding creative ways
to beat signature strings. The anomaly detection method
comes with the ability to detect both known and novel
frauds; although, this method is limited by false positive
error, that is, previously unknown legitimate transactions.
Consequently, this paper exploits machine learning (see
Section IV) to detect fraudulent activities as well as
measuring its performance.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Financial fraud had been a major challenge for corporate
organizations, government and most specifically businesses
that utilize information technology. Financial fraud is
defined as an intentional act of deception involving financial
transactions for personal purpose gain. Another definition
for financial fraud is “to take advantage over another by
false representations” which include “surprise, trickery,
cunning and unfair ways through which another is cheated”
[1].
Globally,
fraud
costs
some
financial
industry
approximately $80 billion annually while the United States’
credit and debit card issuers alone lost $2.4 billion.
The financial fraud occurrence in any organization
undermines both the effort and prospects. Financial fraud
brings about losses owing to theft, distrust in transaction,
and litigation. These losses owing to fraud are grossly
detrimental to institutions in which they occur. As advances
in cloud technology plums and cyber-security measures is
not commensurate,, there exists high possibility of financial
fraud bound to threaten businesses worldwide. Detection of
financial fraud had not come so easy; it is mostly at a high
cost and time. The cost of financial fraud reported is about
$1 million per incident, occupational fraud costs $150 to
$200,000 per incident while losses due to fraud costs an
average of 5% of gross profit and take around 24 to 36
months to discover - usually via a tip (40%), by accident
(20%), or during an audit (10%). Some motivations for
committing financial fraud has been reported and identified
by senior management to be most responsible for most fraud
[4].
The authors in [4] argued that meeting external forecasts
emerged
as
the
primary
motivation
and
it
was
conceptualized that three elements common among all fraud
is called the fraud triangle. These elements include a
perceived
pressure,
a
perceived
opportunity,
and
a
rationalization of the fraud act. in addition to the trio, is
motivation for need, greed and addictions (or vices). This is
with the assertion that the motivation for greed in turn feeds
the motivation for vices. Capping it all, these motivations
become a vicious cycle leading to fraud. thus, financial fraud
is categorized mainly into three areas: bank fraud, corporate
fraud and insurance fraud. Bank fraud is subdivided into
credit card fraud, mortgage fraud and money laundering
fraud [5].
Fraud modelling is one important tool in addressing
financial fraud. It expands in importance as corporate
organizations and government determine which type of
models to use and continuous update in order to protect
against evolving threats. In the past, traditional fraud
models are used to automatically detect unauthorized
transactions such as determining when a card has been used
without the owner’s consent. Most card issuers use fraud
models to identify fraudulent card usage in order to
maintain the integrity and security of their network as it is
core to earning trust in online business world. However,
diverse range of payment services offered by organizations
and businesses to clients also presents higher opportunities
for fraud occurrence. Consequently, fraud models provide a
way
to
mitigate
these
occurrences,
protect
clients’
transactions and play an essential role in payment service
providers’ profitability and sustainability with attributes of a
given
transaction as
variables used
in
fraud
models.
Thereafter, it classifies or attempts to label the transaction
fraudulent
or
legitimate
(see
Section
V-VII).
Some
extensive models label the type or category of fraud. Some
of the common attributes used by fraud models include:
Merchant (the business charging the transaction), transaction
location, amount, type (online or offline), volume, account
history, transaction history, and so on, depending on the
amount of attribute information captured in a transaction.
The five basic fields, which describe type, time (hours,
minutes), location, amount, and date (week days) of a
transaction were used in the fraud model. While 16
significant ratios out of 29 financial ratios were used in
detection of fraud in the financial statements of banks which
were categorized into asset quality ratios, earnings and
profitability ratios, liquidity/solvency ratios, long term
solvency/leverage ratio, capital adequacy ratio, cash flow
analysis and trends. These fraud models utilized 29 variables
of which 24 are financial variables while 5 are non-financial
variables as it proved that model tools based on financial
numbers, linguistic behaviour, and non-verbal vocal cues
have each demonstrated the potential for detecting financial
fraud. Fifty-one (51) financial ratios were utilized in
detecting fraud in financial statements by means of financial
ratios [6].
Notable fraud detection models are mainly categorized as
rule-based models and algorithmic (or machine learning)
models. Rule-based models are collection of rules used to
detect fraudulent transactions with a single rule containing
as a set of conditions that, when present, labels a transaction
either as fraudulent or not. Rule-based models are made up

of an expert knowledge base. In addition, new rules evolve
from time to time because of inference action on streams of
time changing data. However, one major limitation of rule-
based fraud models is time complexity in handling big data.
Algorithmic models make use of machine-learning methods
to classify a transaction as either fraudulent or legitimate.
Algorithmic models are more complex than rule-based
models; this is dependent on the type of algorithm used.
These models are computationally complex than rule-based
models but achieve high performance. They are far better at
detecting complex relationships between variables than the
rule-based models. Machine-learning methods also require a
pre-requisite of having many variables to implement and
ensure learning. Therefore, when there is limited number of
variables usage, the benefit of algorithmic methods over
rule-based models is diminished.
The review on financial accounting fraud detection based
on data mining techniques was motivated by the idea that the
failure of internal auditing system of the organization in
identifying the accounting frauds has led to the use of
specialized procedures to detect financial accounting fraud.
The findings of this review showed that data mining
techniques
such
as
logistic
models,
neural
networks,
Bayesian belief network, and decision trees have been
applied most extensively to provide primary solutions to the
problems inherent in the detection and classification of
fraudulent data. In [6], financial fraud detection using vocal,
linguistic and financial cues is presented and observed that
these methods for automating financial fraud detection
(FFD) have mainly relied on financial statistics; although,
some recent studies have suggested that linguistic or vocal
cues may also be useful indicators of deception. The
hypothesis investigated in the study is that an improved tool
(based on financial numbers, linguistic behaviour, and non-
verbal vocal cues) could be developed if specific attributes
from these feature categories were analyzed concurrently. A
set of 1,572 public company quarterly earnings conference
call audio file samples was used in the study. The authors re-
affirmed that earnings from conference calls are ideal for
investigation because they involved corporate executives
publicly
discussing
financial
information,
thereby
simultaneously providing financial, linguistic and vocal
cues. The study proved that tools based on financial
numbers, linguistic behaviour, and non-verbal vocal cues
have each demonstrated the potential for detecting financial
fraud. However, it is quite tasking (and computationally
intensive) to concurrently source and compute large amount
of vocal and linguistic data [7].
In another study, a difference between precision-recall
and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves for
evaluating the performance of credit card fraud detection
models was motivated by the need to solve the problem of
fraudulent transactions detection with use of machine
learning
for
legitimate
or
fraudulent
the
credit
card
transactions classification. In order to solve this problem, the
precision-recall
curves
are
described
as
an
approach.
Weighted logistic regression is used as an algorithm level
technique and random under-sampling is proposed as data-
level
technique
to
build
credit
card
fraud
classifier.
Performance evaluation of these approaches adopted the
ROC curves, which showed the variance of the number of
correctly classified positive examples with the number of
incorrectly classified negative examples. However, ROC
curves present an overly optimistic performance view. It
established
that
precision-recall
curves
have
more
advantages than ROC curves in dealing with credit card
fraud detection. Nevertheless, the study was limited by
inability to find the best solution to the problem of
imbalanced data in the dataset [8].
In the same vein, a study on “Combatting Financial
Fraud: A Co-evolutionary Anomaly Detection Approach”
evolved around the motivation of the major difficulty in
anomaly detection which lies in discovering boundaries
between normal and anomalous behaviour. The objective
was to present a co-evolutionary algorithm which tackles the
anomaly detection problem and discover the boundary
between
normal
and
abnormal
behaviour.
The
co-
evolutionary algorithm was used to provide a competitive
interaction between different populations which minimize
detection errors and the adaptive evolutionary environment
accelerated by the process of finding good solution. The
authors
implemented
the
algorithm
using
anonymized
transactional data from a real financial institution. The data
set contains two-year Automated Bank Machine (ABM) and
Point of Sale (POS) fraud-free transaction history. The
research has contributed to knowledge by using concept of
evolution to detect anomalies in fraudulent transactions only
it was not applied to realistic data [9].
IV.
METHODOLOGY
The study deploys multilayer perceptron approach to detect
fraud
using financial datasets. Each transaction by a
customer on card contains the transaction API, which is
stripped into attributes. The attributes (model variables)
from the API include; Source IP address, Destination IP
address, Card pan, Location of transaction, Item bought,
Unit of items bought, Amount of transaction and the Date
and Time of transaction. The model architectural design is
depicted in Figure. 2. The Architecture is divided into 3
major parts, namely:
i.
Data preprocessing & Feature Selection
ii.
Data Training & Learning

Classification
Financial credit card datasets were selected (Dataset 1
and
Dataset

were
obtained
from
“Kaggle
Data
Repository”
which
are
publicly
available
containing
anonymized real-life credit card transactions with an evident
presence of fraudulent cases. Dataset 1 was obtained from
Kaggle Data Repository, and contains anonymized data to
protect user’s vital information. Data was from Credit Card
Transactions for users in Europe in 2013. It has 284,808

entries. It has 31 attributes with class labels The Dataset 1
sample is shown in Table 1.
Dataset 2 contains anonymized data to protect users’
vital information, Data contains credit card transactions. It
has 151,113 entries. It has 11 attributes with class labels,
partitioned into testing set and training set. Training set
contained 105,778 records and testing set had 45,335
records. Sample records of the Dataset 2 are shown in Table

SAMPLE OF DATASET 1
The data pre-processing and preparation was carried out
on the raw financial dataset to remove outliers using max-
min normalization technique. As shown in equation (1)

where fvalue, is the feature value to be normalized, fmin is the
minimum feature value and fmax is the maximum feature
value respectively.
Feature selection was performed by computing feature
importance. This is done using Information gain calculation.
Thus, given a set of financial transaction dataset Sc

MULTI LAYER PERCEPTRON (MLP)
The implementation is a feed-forward artificial neural
networks; MLP consists of the input layer, output layer, and
one or more hidden layers. Each layer of MLP includes one
or more neurons directionally linked with the neurons from
the previous and the next layer. Figure 3 represents a 3-layer
perceptron having three inputs, two outputs, and the hidden
layer including five neurons
The values retrieved from the previous layer are
summed up with certain weights, individual for each neuron,
plus the bias term [10]. The sum is transformed using the
activation function.

Figure 3: A Multi-Layer perceptron
The perceptron computes a single output from multiple
real-valued
inputs
by
forming
a
linear
combination
according to its input weights and then putting the output
through some nonlinear activation function:
Given output (ݑ௜)
ݑ௜=෍(ݓ௜,௝
௡
௝ୀଵ
ݔ௝+ܾ௜)(4)
With the activation function (߮) applied, mathematically the
MLP can be written as:
ݕ௜=߮ ቌ෍(ݓ௜,௝
௡
௝ୀଵ
ݔ௝+ܾ௜)ቍ
(5 )
where w = weight going to the hidden unit layer
x= Input to hidden unit
b= bias input
φ= Activation function
Figure 4. Representation of the MLP equation
A. Learning Algorithm
The MLP uses a backpropagation algorithm to learn and
train from the dataset
The back-propagation algorithm is in 2 phases:
•
The forward pass phase- computes ‘functional
signal’, feed forward propagation of input pattern
signals through network.
•
Backward pass phase- computes ‘error signal’,
propagates the error backwards through network
starting at output units (where the error is the
difference
between
actual
and
desired
output
values).
Forward pass Algorithm
•
Step 1: Initialize weights at random, choose a
learning rate η 
•
Until network is trained:
•
For each training example i.e. input pattern and
target output(s):
•
Step 2: Do forward pass through net (with fixed
weights) to produce output(s)
–
i.e., in Forward Direction, layer by layer:
•
Inputs applied
•
Multiplied by weights
•
Summed
•
‘Squashed’ by sigmoid activation
function
•
Output passed to each neuron in
next layer
–
Repeat
above
until
network
output(s)
produced
Backward pass /Back propagation of error
•
Compute error (delta or local gradient) for each
•
output unit δ k
•
Layer-by-layer, compute error (delta or local
•
gradient)
for
each
hidden
unit
δ
j
by
backpropagating
•
errors (as shown previously)
•
Next, update all the weights Δwij
•
By gradient descent, and go back to Step 2
The overall MLP learning algorithm, involving forward
pass and backpropagation of error (until the network
training completion), is known as the Generalized Delta
Rule (GDR), or more commonly, the Back Propagation
(BP) algorithm
VI.
MLP IMPLEMENTATION
The MLP model was implemented on a Personal
Computer with 2.30 GHz and 8GB of RAM in Microsoft
Windows 10 Operating system platform and Microsoft Excel
2013 with Python Programing Language. The MLP training
was defined with parameters epochs = 20, dim_size = 15,
num_seq = 30, batch_size = 200, activation function =
Sigmoid.
Due to the high imbalance in the datasets, the data were
synthetically balanced using the smote method, The datasets
1 and dataset 2 stored in csv format were loaded into python
3.6 IDLE via a read_csv () command. The datasets were
divided into two parts (Input and Output). The input data are
those with the attributes while the output data contain the
target class (‘Fraudulent’ and ‘Normal’).
A. Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation of the model was carried out using the
various evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, F1-
score, Recall and False alarm rate.
…

Accuracy: is defined as the number of correct predictions
made by the model. It is the proportion of the total number
of correct predictions.
ܣܿܿݑݎܽܿݕ=ܶܲ+ܶܰ
ܶܲ+ܶܰ+ܨܲ+ܨܰ(6)
False Alarm Rate (FAR)/False Positive rate: is a ratio of
wrongly classified normal instances.
ܨ݈ܽݏ݁ܣ݈ܽݎܴ݉ܽݐ݁=ܨܲ
ܶܰ+ܨܲ(7)
Precision: defines the results classified as positive by the
model, how many were actually positive. It is the number of
items correctly identified as positive out of total true
positives.
Precision=
୲୰୳ୣ ୮୭ୱ୧୲୧୴ୣ
୲୰୳ୣ ୮୭ୱ୧୲୧୴ୣ ା୤ୟ୪ୱୣ ୮୭ୱ୧୲୧୴ୣୱ
(8)
Recall: It is the number of items correctly identified as
positive out of the total items classified as positive.
Recall=
୲୰୳ୣ ୮୭ୱ୧୲୧୴ୣ
୲୰୳ୣ ୮୭ୱ୧୲୧୴ୣା୤ୟ୪ୱୣ ୬ୣ୥ୟ୲୧୴ୣୱ
(9)
F1-Score: is the weighted average of the precision and the
recall, it takes both false negatives and positives into the
account and gives a better outlook especially in an uneven
class distribution it is given as:
F1 Score = 2(Precision ∗ recall
Precision + recall )
(10)
where True positive (TP) represents data detected as
fraudulent, True negative (TN) represents data detected as
legitimate, False positive (FP) represents normal data
detected as fraudulent, and False Negative (FN) is denoted
as fraud data detected as normal.

This
model
performed
impressively
against
the
performance of the Logistic regression study with the same
dataset.
Weighted logistic regression was used as an
algorithm level technique and random under-sampling was
used as data-level technique to build credit card fraud
classifier. The classification used in the study was Logistic
Regression and the performance metrics are Recall and
Precision. A graphical evaluation report of the two models is
illustrated in Figure. 6.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the multilayer perceptron which used
information gain method as feature selection technique for
obtaining the most relevant features of the dataset was found
to be effective in fraud detection; this is hopeful to be of
high
importance
to
the
financial
sector.
This
study
established a fraud detection framework that is capable of
unmasking real-time fraudulent transactions. The prediction
of the proposed framework records high level of accuracy,
precision, recall, good F1-score and very low false alarm
rate. In addition, it is observed that the larger dataset, which
is Dataset I, yielded high evaluation values than Dataset II, a
smaller dataset- Dataset II. This corroborates facts from
literatures on the prediction accuracy in big data. Future
work will be extended to other algorithms as well as
hybridized
approach
with
minimal
computational
complexity.
