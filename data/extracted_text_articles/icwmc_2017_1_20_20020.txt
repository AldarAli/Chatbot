Abstract— The users in the next generation wireless networks 
will be offered with abundant services by the network 
operators. The objective of the network operators would be to 
enhance revenue by accommodating maximum number of 
users, while at the same time they need to ensure that the users 
are given with the quality of service promised. Call admission 
control is the process of accepting or rejecting the call in the 
system and has a direct control on the number of users in the 
system. The design of call admission controller will be of 
utmost importance to the network operators as increase in the 
number of users in the system will increase the revenue 
generated. In this paper, the working of five different user 
class based models for call admission control are explained and 
evaluated. The simulation results for system call blocking 
probability versus utilization rate of different models are 
presented. 
Keywords-Partitioning; Queuing; Threshold; Reservation; 
Differential Access.

 INTRODUCTION 
The network operators in the Next Generation Wireless 
Networks (NGWN) come up with wide array of services to 
their users thus increasing the customer base of the network 
operators. The users in NGWN demand for Quality of 
Service (QoS) requirements of varied types, as they may not 
be willing to use all the services provided by the network 
operator. Hence, user differentiation plays a vital role in 
NGWN and providing QoS guarantee to users in NGWN 
will become a challenging problem [1]. In this paper, we 
categorize the users into three classes namely, ClassP, 
ClassG and ClassS representing platinum class users, gold 
class users and silver class users, respectively. 
Accepting a user call or rejecting a call is totally 
determined by Call Admission Control (CAC) and hence, the 
number of users in the system is also directly controlled by 
CAC [2]. CAC is a prominent radio resource management 
technique that plays influential role in ensuring the desired 
QoS to the users and applications in NGWN [3][4]. General 
metrics used for CAC is Call Blocking Probability (CBP), 
call dropping probability and call rejection percentage [5]. 
This paper uses CBP as an appropriate parameter for 
evaluating the user class based CAC models. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section II surveys the 
related work. Section III provides the intricacies of partition, 
queuing, threshold, reservation and differential access 
techniques for admission control. The simulation results are 
presented in Section IV. Insight to further research and 
conclusion are provided in Section V. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Wide spectrum of CAC mechanisms are proposed in 
literature to guarantee QoS, primarily focusing on the 
application types, such as real time and non real time 
applications.  The majority of work related to CAC, as 
reported by surveys on CAC [5] - [9] is carried out under two 
major headings namely, number of users based CAC and 
interference based CAC. However, few works of CAC based 
on type of users are also reported.

Pal et al. [10] have proposed a QoS framework based on 
traffic class and user satisfaction. Kumar et al. [11] have 
proposed a user based bandwidth allocation technique for 
WiMAX named Differentiated Bandwidth Allocation 
Mechanism (DBAM). Algur et al. [12] have proposed a 
graded priority based admission control algorithm for LTE 
and WiMAX. AlQahtani [13] has proposed a user 
classification based CAC technique for LTE Advanced 
networks. Hosein [14] has proposed a QoS framework that 
allows an operator to provide class based connection 
admissions. Ozianyi et al. [15] have proposed a pricing 
approach that introduces three classes of user profiles 
platinum, gold and silver. Abraham et al. [16] have proposed 
a method and apparatus for adjustable QoS based admission 
control and scheduling in WLANs. Mahesh et al. [17] - [20] 
have proposed Partition Model (PM), Partition with Queuing 
Model (PQM), Reservation Model (RM) and Differential 
Access Model (DAM) for user class based CAC. A new 
classification of CAC techniques by adding "type of user" as 
an additional vertical to the existing classification is as 
shown in Figure 1. In this paper, the details of PM, PQM, 
RM and DAM are provided. The Threshold Model (TM) for 
user class based CAC is proposed and performance 
evaluation of  PM, PQM, RM, DAM and TM is done.  
III. 
USER CLASS BASED CAC MODELS 
In this paper, we consider five user class based admission 
control models for performance evaluation namely, PM, 
PQM, TM, RM and DAM. For all the five models, three 
classes of users are considered namely, ClassP (Platinum 
Class Users), ClassG (Gold Class Users) and ClassS (Silver 
Class Users). This classification is done based on users 
varying QoS requirement and their willingness to pay the 
extra cost for the opted priority class of service. It is assumed 
that the ClassP user calls are of highest priority, ClassS user 
calls are of lowest priority and ClassG user calls are in 
between ClassP and ClassS. The arrival rates of ClassS, 
ClassG and ClassP user calls are denoted by λS, λG, and λP, 
respectively and are assumed to follow Poisson process. The 
mean service time of calls for all classes of users is assumed 
to follow a negative exponential distribution with a mean 
rate of 1/µ. The total number of virtual channels in the 
system is assumed to be equal to N. 
A. Partition Model 
The channel partition model is proposed in [17]. In this 
model, the entire set of N channels is divided and grouped 
into three disjoint sets P1, P2 and P3. The first set of channels 
P1 is to be used only by ClassS user calls, the second set of 
channels P2 is to be used only by ClassG user calls and the 
third set of channels P3 is to be used by only ClassP user 
calls. It is assumed that the number of channels in the third 
set P3 is very much greater than the other two sets P1 and P2. 
Also, the number of channels in the second set P2 is very 
much greater than the first set P1.  
Upon arrival of a call, the admission controller will first 
determine the class of call and based on availability of 
channels for the arrived calls' class, the call gets accepted or 
rejected. If the arrived call is of ClassP and if there are no 
free channels available between 1 to P3, then the ClassP call 
gets rejected. The ClassP call gets accepted only if there are 
any free channels available between 1 to P3. Similarly, 
ClassG and ClassS call gets accepted only if there are free 
channels available between 1 to P2 and 1 to P1, respectively, 
else the calls get rejected.  
In [17], the expressions for call blocking probability for 
all the three classes of users namely ClassS, ClassG and 
ClassP are derived for partition model. The expressions for 
call blocking probability of ClassS, ClassG and ClassP users 
are denoted by BPS, BPG and BPP. (1), (2) and (3) represents 
the CBP of ClassS, ClassG and ClassP users, respectively.

B. Partition With Queuing Model 
The channel partition with queuing model is proposed in 
[18]. In this model, the entire set of N channels is divided 
into three disjoint groups P1, P2 and P3. The first set of 
channels P1 is to be used only by ClassS user calls, the 
second set of channels P2 is to be used only by ClassG user 
calls and the third set of channels P3 is to be used by only 
ClassP user calls. It is assumed that the number of channels 
in the third set P3 is very much greater than the other two sets 
P1 and P2. Also, the number of channels in the second set P2 
is very much greater than the first set P1.  
The model is built with an idea that a small amount of 
delay in providing the service is better than not providing the 
service at all and the major objective is to minimize the 
denial service to all classes of users. Hence, in this model, if 
a class of users finds that all channels belonging to its class 
are occupied, then instead of dropping the call they are 
queued in appropriate queue class. When a channel of a 
particular class is released and if the queue of that particular

class is not empty then the released channel is assigned to the 
user call in front of the queue.  
In [18], the expressions for call blocking probability for 
all the three classes of users namely ClassS, ClassG and 
ClassP are derived for partition with queuing model. The 
expressions for call blocking probability of ClassS, ClassG 
and ClassP users are denoted by BQS, BQG and BQP. (4), (5) 
and (6) represents the CBP of ClassS, ClassG and ClassP 
users, respectively. In (4), (5) and (6), QS, QG and QP 
represents the queue size for ClassS, ClassG and ClassP, 
respectively.

C. Threshold Model 
In this model, the entire set of N channels is divided into 
two disjoint groups, P1 and P2. The first set of channels P1 is 
to be used by ClassS and ClassP user calls and the second set 
of channels P2 is to be used by ClassG and ClassP user calls. 
It is assumed that the number of channels in the second set P2 
is much greater than the number of channels in the first set 
P1. TS and TG are the thresholds for ClassS and ClassG, 
respectively.  
Upon arrival of a call, the admission controller will first 
determine the class of call and based on availability of 
channels for the arrived calls' class, the call gets accepted or 
rejected. If the arrived call is of ClassP and if there are no 
free channels available between 1 to P1 and 1 to P2, then the 
ClassP call gets rejected. The ClassP call gets accepted as 
long as there are any free channels available in the system. A 
ClassG user call gets accepted only if there are free channels 
available between 1 to P2 and its utilization threshold is less 
than TG else it gets rejected. Similarly, a ClassS user call gets 
accepted only if there are free channels available between 1 
to P1 and its utilization threshold is less than TS else it gets 
rejected. 
The expressions for call blocking probability of ClassS, 
ClassG and ClassP users are denoted by BTS, BTG and BTP.  
(7), (8) and (9) represents the CBP of ClassS, ClassG and 
ClassP users, respectively.

D. Reservation Model 
The reservation model is proposed in [19]. In this model, 
exclusive reservation of channels is done for high priority 
users. ClassP users have an exclusive reservation of R1 
channels out of the N channels. Amongst the remaining 
C2=N–R1channels, ClassP and ClassG users have prioritized 
access to R2 channels. The remaining channels C1=C2–R2 
can be used by all the three classes of users.  
Upon arrival of a call, the admission controller will first 
determine the class of call and based on availability of 
channels for the arrived calls' class, the call gets accepted or 
rejected. If the arrived call is of ClassP and if there are no 
free channels available in the system, then the ClassP call 
gets rejected. The ClassP call gets accepted as long as there 
are any free channels available in the system. A ClassG user 
call gets accepted only if there are free channels available 
between 1 to C2 else it gets rejected. Similarly, A ClassS user 
call gets accepted only if there are free channels available 
between 1 to C1 else it gets rejected. 
In [19], the expressions for call blocking probability for 
all the three classes of users namely ClassS, ClassG and 
ClassP are derived for reservation model. The expressions 
for call blocking probability of ClassS, ClassG and ClassP 
users are denoted by BRS, BRG and BRP. (10), (11) and (12) 
represents the CBP of ClassS, ClassG and ClassP users, 
respectively.

E. Differential Access Model 
The differential access model is proposed in [20]. In this 
model, priority to users is given by allocating more number 
of channels for high priority user calls. It is assumed that 
ClassP user calls require 3 channels, ClassG user calls 
require 2 channels and ClassS user call requires 1 channel. 
BP, BG, and BS are the call blocking probabilities of ClassP, 
ClassG and ClassS users, respectively. When a user call 
requests for channels, the admission controller accepts the 
user call request if and only if there are free channels 
available to accommodate that particular user class (3 
channels for ClassP, 2 channels for ClassG and 1 channel for 
ClassS) else rejects the user call requests.  
In [20], the expressions for call blocking probability for 
all the three classes of users namely ClassS, ClassG and 
ClassP are derived for differential model. The expressions 
for call blocking probability of ClassS, ClassG and ClassP 
users are denoted by BDS, BDG and BDP. (13), (14) and (15) 
represents the CBP of ClassS, ClassG and ClassP users, 
respectively.

RESULTS 
In this section, we present the numerical results and 
compare the system call blocking probability of different 
models. Logarithmic scale bar graphs are used to interpret 
the results obtained. The bars in the graph represent the 
system CBP. It is to be noted that smaller the size of the bar, 
larger is the value and vice versa.  
 
Figure 2.  PM versus PQM (Ratio 2:3:5 and N=30) 
It is assumed that the total number of virtual channels 
available in the system is 30. Figure 2 shows the graph of 
system CBP versus utilization rate of partition model and 
partition with queuing model for partition ratio 2:3:5, N=30 
and queue size ranging from 0 to 10.  
 
Figure 3.  PM versus TM (Ratio 2:3:5, TS=6, TG=9 and N=30) 
It can be seen that when queue size is zero, partition 
model and partition with queuing behave alike i.e., their CBP 
is same. Also, it is observed that with increase in queue size, 
the CBP decreases. Figure 3 shows the graph of system CBP 
versus utilization rate of partition model and threshold model

for N= 30. It can be seen that threshold model exhibits lower 
CBP when compared to partition model in all cases. 
 
Figure 4.  TM versus RM (Ratio 2:3:5, R1=6, R2=15 and N=30) 
Figure 4 shows the graph of system CBP versus 
utilization rate of threshold model and reservation model for 
N= 30. It can be seen that reservation model exhibits lower 
CBP when compared to threshold model in all cases.  
 
Figure 5.  CBP of all 5 Models (N=30) 
Figure 5 shows the graph of system CBP versus 
utilization rate of all the five models for N= 30 and 
partitioning ratios 2:3:5. It can be seen that reservation model 
exhibits the lowest CBP in all cases when compared to all 
other models. 
The simulation study was conducted by considering 
different partition ratios with varied number of channels in 
the system; however the same observations were reported.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have evaluated performance of five 
different models for user class based CAC in NGWN. The 
models are simulated using Matlab and the simulation results 
are as shown in Figure 2 to Figure 5. The results clearly 
indicate that reservation model outperforms other models 
interms of CBP. Second in line is the threshold model, 
followed by partition with queuing model, partition model 
and finally differential access model. The CBP of partition 
with queuing improves with increase in queue size. The 
reason for differential access model to have greater CBP is 
that it allocates more than one channel for prioritized users 
and hence will be able to accommodate less number of users 
in the system. The pricing plays important role in 
commercialization of any experimental studies. NGWN is no 
exception and it has to primarily address pricing factor. 
Models of this nature are very essential to realize an optimal 
pricing model. The models evaluated in this paper are 
expected to bring delight to users and optimal revenue to 
service providers - ‘a win-win scenario’. Future work is to 
integrate pricing strategies of various players with the 
proposed CAC models. The proposed models are envisioned 
to realize optimal resource utilization, greater user flexibility 
and satisfaction.
