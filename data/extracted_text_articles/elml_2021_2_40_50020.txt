Abstract— The rapid technological developments in various 
fields have changed the usual patterns of human life. Clearly, 
technology has contributed to the diversification of the 
teaching and learning methods used in the education sectors 
and has changed the way that information is delivered to 
students, particularly during the eLearning 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 
stages.  The literature indicates that the Semantic Web 
(eLearning 3.0) has been researched extensively and few issues 
have yet to be investigated. However, since eLearning 4.0 is a 
new generation of eLearning, to the best of the researchers¶ 
knowledge, very few studies have examined the factors that 
facilitate its implementation. Given the recent emergence of 
eLearning 4.0, the aim of this research is to examine the 
implementation of this relatively new technology in the higher 
education sector, and a holistic eLearning 4.0 model for Saudi 
Arabia higher education will be proposed. This will contribute 
to the Saudi Arabian government¶s achievement of its goals for 
the education sector specified in its Vision 2030. In this 
research, nine factors that constitute the initial model will be 
thoroughly examined.  These factors are: Pedagogical Quality, 
Academic Success, Environment, Financial Cost, User 
Support, Behavioural Intention, Collaboration, Satisfaction 
and “Smart Technology 4.0 Adoption and Design”. The 
contribution of this research is that it examines the 
effectiveness of the nine factors with a focus on the new factor 
“Smart Technology 4.0 Adoption and Design”, and then 
improves the initial holistic eLearning 4.0 model. A mixed-
methods approach will be adopted. An explanatory sequential 
design will inform the data collection process. The target 
population for the online survey will be the academics and the 
students in public and private Saudi universities. For the 
collection of qualitative data, semi-structured interviews will 
be conducted with at least twenty-five e-learning experts. This 
paper is part of an ongoing research effort to develop and 
promote e-learning in Saudi Arabia.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
      In the introduction section, we defined eLearning, its 
generations, eLearning in Saudi higher education, and 
research questions.  
A. eLearning:  
     eLearning is defined as the education that the student 
obtains electronically through a computer network [1]. The 
delivery of education via information technology has several 
impacts on the way that teachers teach, and students learn.  
eLearning can be conducted through direct Internet 
connection at a specific time or at a time chosen by the 
students and via any device that suits them [2]. 
B. eLearning 1.0: 
     eLearning 1.0 was developed as a means of improving 
education by facilitating communication between teachers 
and learners using the technologies offered by Web 1.0. In 
the early transition of education to technology, several 
digital tools were available in the education system, but they 
were not connected simultaneously [3]. The use of the 
Internet was the first step in eLearning 1.0, making it easier 
for students to access educational material "anytime, 
anywhere, anyone" [4]. The technical capabilities of Web 
1.0 allowed the learner to read only, not write. Instructions 
were received in the traditional way because the educational 
materials were unidirectional (i.e., from the teacher) without 
interaction with the learners [5]. 
C. eLearning 2.0: 
     eLearning 2.0, according to the description given by [6], 
is what Web 2.0 provides for educational use. Unlike Web 
1.0, Web 2.0 enabled the user to write and save content [7]. 
It allowed people to discuss and express ideas among 
themselves, which helped build a social foundation that was 
missing in Web 1.0 [8]. More specifically, Web 2.0 
comprised social networks and their technologies, such as 
Facebook, Twitter, blogs, podcasts, discussion board, and 
wikis. eLearning 2.0 enabled the building of social 
knowledge 
through 
multi-directional 
interactive 
communication [5]. Moreover, it allowed the teacher to 
communicate with the students directly and evaluate their 
learning process. It also gave students the opportunity to 
contribute their own material and share it with others [3]. 
D. eLearning 3.0: 
     eLearning 3.0 is based on the Semantic Web, known as 
Web 3.0. It provides education in a meaningful and content-
related way [3]. Instead of documents, the Semantic Web is 
built on databases [9] that allow users to share data with

each other without being monopolized [10]. To build an 
eLearning 3.0 system in a way that facilitates the learning 
process for students, it is possible to rely on data mining and 
artificial intelligence to filter the huge and complex amount 
of data [8]. Modern technology, such as cloud computing, 
high resolution screens, and large data storage capacity, 
have contributed to the transition from previous eLearning 
to eLearning 3.0 [5]. One of the most prominent examples 
of a system implemented for eLearning 3.0 is the Adaptive 
Hypermedia Knowledge Management E-Learning Platform 
that complies with Web 3.0 educational requirements [11].  
E. eLearning 4.0:  
     eLearning 4.0 is the latest technology in digital 
transformation and innovation in the education sector along 
with other fields [12], and despite all the advantages that 
were provided by eLearning 3.0, it has shortcomings 
because of the nature of Web 3.0 and its technical issues 
including interoperability, inability of the server to check, 
inadequate privacy safeguards, and the security risks [13]. 
The successful implementation of eLearning 4.0 depends on 
machines as well as people, so it is vital that the two be 
coordinated. This coordination will find innovative 
solutions to various problems, which may contribute to 
improving 
modern 
life 
[14]. 
For 
the 
successful 
implementation of eLearning 4.0, teachers must be 
competent users of the eLearning 4.0 technologies. This 
could be achieved through training courses and workshops 
deVigQed WR iPSURYe WeacheUV¶ VNiOOV aQd efficieQc\ iQ XViQg 
eLearning 4.0 in the classroom [15]. eLearning 4.0 can 
contribute to making learning and teaching dynamic and 
engaging. In particular, higher education institutions should 
seek innovative ways to develop educational processes that 
are in sync with the needs of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 
[15]. The concept of Web 4.0 is connecting intelligence 
which has transferred to eLearning 4.0 [16].  
F. eLearning in Saudi higher education  
Education is the cornerstone of the Kingdom of Saudi 
AUabia¶V ViViRQ 2030 ageQda fRU bXiOdiQg a YibUaQW VRcieW\. 
Saudi Arabia, which seeks to develop and modernize its 
entire education system, aims to keep pace with modern 
technologies that help students develop their scientific 
outputs and practical skills during their educational journey 
to achieve the goals of 2030 Vision. This vision aims, 
through the educational and academic system, to obtain 
qualified graduates who can contribute to and help develop a 
prosperous economy for the country [17]. The higher 
education sector in Saudi Arabia comprises thirty-nine 
universities, both public and private, and has one hundred 
and thirty-nine university campuses [18][19]. In this country, 
computers have been used in education since the 1990s. At 
that time, specifically in 1996, the Computer and Information 
Centre was established, and was responsible for providing 
technical services to universities [20]. Public universities in 
Saudi Arabia, which constitute the majority of the higher 
education sector, have a policy for having a deanship for 
eLearning and distance education. These deanships build an 
infrastructure for the success of eLearning in universities by 
providing the technical means to convert traditional courses 
into those that can be offered through eLearning while 
providing support to users to ensure the quality of the 
education [21]. 
 
This paper aims to present the idea to develop a holistic 
eLearning 4.0 model for higher education in Saudi Arabia. 
Further research will be carried out in the future to examine 
the following research questions: 1-What are the essential 
factors that are required for developing a holistic eLearning 
4.0 model for Saudi Arabia? 2-What are the perceptions and 
attitudes of stakeholders toward a holistic eLearning 4.0 
model for Saudi Arabia higher education? 3-What is the 
Smart Technology 4.0 adoption and design factors required 
to develop a holistic eLearning 4.0 model for Saudi Arabia?  
 
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
summaries studies exploring eLearning factors. Section III 
explains the research gap. Section IV outlines the research 
significance. Section V explains the research methodology. 
Section VI about conclusion and future work.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Based on the studies listed in Table 1, the researchers 
proposed an initial holistic eLearning 4.0 model for Saudi 
Arabia (see Figure 1) as the first version of an eLearning 4.0 
model for the Saudi Arabian higher education sector. There 
are nine factors in this initial model: Pedagogical Quality, 
Academic Success, Environment, Financial Cost, User 
Support, Smart Technology 4.0 Adoption and Design 
Factors, Behavioural Intention Factors, Collaboration 
Factors, and Satisfaction Factors.  
 
 
TABLE 1. STUDIES EXPLORING ELEARNING FACTORS AND 
SUBFACTORS. 
 
Factor Name 
Definition/sub-factors 
Reference 
Pedagogical 
Quality 
The pedagogical quality factor plays an 
important role in eLearning system, since 
it has seven different sub-factors related 
to quality: information, instructor, 
instructor competencies, technical 
support, course delivery, tutor 
competence and facilitating conditions.  
[22]-[28] 
Academic 
Success 
Academic success has five factors: 
service quality, organizational factors, 
technology/systems factors, social 
facWRUV, aQd iQVWUXcWRUV¶ facWRUV.  
[29]-[32] 
Environment 
The environment factor has six sub-
factors: e-content development, student 
awareness, facilitating conditions, social 
presence, cognitive presence, and 
teaching presence.  
[33]-[37]

Financial 
Cost 
Price value is the first sub-factor under 
financial cost. Bates [38] states that the 
use of technology in education helps to 
reduce the costs of education incurred by 
students. Financial support is the second 
component of financial cost. Every 
organization and its departments need 
ongoing financial support in order to 
survive. 
[38]-[41] 
User Support 
User support has two sub-factors: 
resource support and training programs. 
Resource support enables students to 
communicate easily with both the 
technical support team and the teachers. 
The training programs play an influential 
role in the distance education process. 
[42][43] 
Behavioural 
Intention 
Behavioural intention is a central factor 
in eLearning. In this research, 
behavioural intention consists of six sub-
factors namely: social influence, trust, 
self-efficacy, performance expectancy, 
hedonic motivation and perceived 
enjoyment.  
[34][39] 
  [54]-[60] 
Collaboration 
Collaboration in education involves the 
activities in which a group of students 
jointly engage in order to accomplish the 
academic tasks required of them [61].  
[43] 
[61]-[66] 
Satisfaction 
Student satisfaction can be determined 
by their continuous evaluation of the 
quality of teachers in teaching and the 
quality of the educational material 
provided to them [26]. 
[26] 
[67]-[70] 
Smart 
Technology 
4.0 Adoption 
and Design 
Smart technology 4.0 adoption and 
design factors are essential for eLearning 
4.0, and to date have been under-
researched. This factor has six sub-
factors: flexibility, user acceptance, 
computer self-efficacy, design quality, 
infrastructure component, and 
accomplishment.

III. 
RESEARCH GAP 
eLearning 4.0 is a new term associated with other terms 
like Education 4.0, Pedagogical 4.0, Web 4.0, and Industry 
4.0. 
Numerous 
factors 
that 
facilitate 
eLearning 
implementation have been investigated by [39][71]-[75]. To 
the best of the researchers¶ knowledge, most aspects of 
eLearning 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 have been researched and reported in 
the literature [5][8][13]. Lately, researchers have been 
studying the concept of eLearning 4.0. Studies by 
[12][15][16] have explained eLearning 4.0, the new 
technologies involved, the value added to education, and 
how eLearning 4.0 will meet the needs of Industrial 
Revolution 4.0. eLearning 4.0 has been devolved to catch up 
with new technologies extending to the education 
environment. These technologies, such as 3D Printing, 
Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Cloud Computing, 
Hologram, Biometrics, Paper-thin Smartphone, Multi-touch 
LCD screen, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Big 
Data, and QR-code were studied by [12][15] who give 
details of each technology and its benefit to education. 
However, many aspects of eLearning 4.0 have yet to be 
covered as it is a relatively new technology, together with all 
the technologies related to it. To the best of the researchers¶ 
knowledge, no study has been conducted that focuses on the 
learner or that proposes a holistic eLearning 4.0 model for 
Saudi Arabia higher education. The available researches 
conducted on Saudi Arabia [20][76]-[81] have investigated 
YaUiRXV facWRUV, eiWheU fURP Whe WeacheUV¶ RU VWXdeQWV¶ 
perspectives, that influence the implementation of eLearning. 
IV. 
RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE  
     The overall goal of this research is to make a theoretical 
and practical contribution to eLearning 4.0, specifically in 
the higher education sector in Saudi Arabia. 
A. Theoretical Significance  
The significance of this research lies in the academic and 
theoretical contributions it will make to the existing literature 
pertaining to eLearning. Among other things, it offers a 
summary of the important factors required for the successful 
implementation of eLearning 4.0 in Saudi Arabia. Who 
benefits from this study? The major beneficiaries of this 
research are the stakeholders in the higher education sector 
in Saudi Arabia: Ministry of Education staff, university 
administrators and heads of departments, the IT departments 
of universities, researchers, and both undergraduate and 
postgraduate students. The benefit of the research will not be 
limited to Saudi Arabia, but could extend to neighboring 
Gulf countries, given the similar cultural, educational and 
administrative characteristics of the six countries. Overall, 
the study will make a theoretical contribution since there has 
been no investigation to date of new factors influencing the 
implementation of eLearning 4.0 in the higher education 
sector. The research limitations will open up avenues of 
future research for other students from Saudi Arabia who 
wish to pursue tertiary courses and conduct studies in this 
particular area.

B. Practical Significance  
As mentioned previously, eLearning 4.0 is an emerging 
topic in academia. Given the novelty of the concept, there are 
several aspects of eLearning 4.0 that researchers around the 
world have not addressed. Specifically, Saudi Arabia, which 
has a large area and a diverse geography, needs to adopt 
eLearning more so than other countries. There is an urgent 
need for studies to be conducted on the important factors that 
constitute a successful eLearning 4.0 model for Saudi 
Arabia. It is anticipated that the results of this study will be 
of value to all stakeholders in the higher education sector in 
Saudi Arabia as they will inform the strategies for the 
practical application of eLearning 4.0. In addition, a model is 
needed that can avoid the shortcomings, problems, and 
defects that surfaced during the implementation of eLearning 
3.0 in the education sector, which became more clearly 
evident during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Saudi Vision 
2030 specifies that education is a priority and explicitly 
stipulates the adoption of eLearning throughout the country. 
This research is well-aligned with the Saudi Arabia 2030 
Vision and its goal of improving education in the country. 
Applying eLearning 4.0 early and with quality, will be 
effective for Saudis in their journey to keep pace with the 
needs of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Finally, the 
benefits derived this study can be applied to all Gulf 
countries that have similar systems of education and face the 
same challenges as Saudi Arabia in this regard. 
V. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
     To examine the use of eLearning 4.0 in Saudi Arabia, 
and to develop an initial holistic model, the pragmatism 
philosophy will be adopted. Pragmatism is a method based 
on the abduction concept which oscillates between 
deduction and induction approaches [82]. For information 
systems researchers, pragmatism is considered as the ideal 
approach for their studies as it enables them to use more 
than one method to obtain a wide range of data, thereby 
facilitating the answering of research question [82]. The 
mixed-methods approach involves the collection and 
analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data [83]. In 
order WR achieYe Whe UeVeaUch RbMecWiYeV, a ³VeTXeQWiaO 
e[SOaQaWRU\ deVigQ´ ZiOO be adRSWed fRU WhiV VWXd\. The daWa 
collection process has two phases: the quantitative phase 
followed by the qualitative phase [83]. For this study, an 
online survey will be used for collecting quantitative data, 
and semi-structured interviews will be conducted to collect 
qualitative data. After these data have been collected and 
analysed separately, the results will be integrated so that 
conclusions can be drawn [84][85]. The significant benefit 
of adopting a sequential mixed-methods approach is that it 
provides a comprehensive picture of a phenomenon. 
Through this approach, statistical results can be obtained 
from the analysis of the quantitative data, and these can 
complement or be supported by the qualitative data obtained 
from, in this case, interviews [83]. The sequential 
explanatory design prioritises the collection of quantitative 
data which is considered the more significant of the two 
[83]. To achieve this aim, the views of stakeholders in 
higher education in Saudi Arabia in regard to the new 
eLearning 4.0 model will be collected and analysed. 
Quantitative data will be collected via an online survey of 
stakeholders (staff and students). The data will be analysed 
to determine whether new factors emerge that will improve 
the initial eLearning 4.0 model. In the second phase, the 
qualitative data is collected by means of semi-structured 
interviews conducted with IT experts who specialise in 
education in the Saudi higher education sector, to gather 
their opinions about essential eLearning factors that may 
improve the implementation and ensure the success of Web 
4.0 technology in the education sector. In order to obtain 
valid and accurate data, the sample for the qualitative phase 
will comprise at least twenty-five experts. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
       In conclusion, the drive of this research is to develop a 
holistic eLearning 4.0 model for higher education in Saudi 
Arabia. What was presented in this paper from: e-learning 
generations, research questions, literature review on factors 
and the proposed model accordingly, research gap, research 
significances, and research methodology will be used as the 
starting point and basis for future research.   
 
      We expect that the model proposed in this paper will 
undergo development following the next two research 
phases (the quantitative and the qualitative), and the results 
and modifications will be published in future papers 
including answers to the research questions. In addition, the 
research will suggest new factors that relate particularly to 
eLeaUQiQg 4.0 QaPeO\ ³VPaUW WechQRORg\ 4.0 adRSWiRQ´, 
which will be examined in more depth. It is anticipated that 
this work will encourage institutions to implement 
eLearning 4.0 successfully, thereby supporting the Saudi
