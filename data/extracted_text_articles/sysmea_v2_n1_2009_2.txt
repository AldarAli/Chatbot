Abstract 
 
The field measurement equipment that provides 
reliable results is essential in the quality verification of 
DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting, Hand held) 
networks. In addition, sufficiently in-depth analysis of 
the post-processed data is important. This paper 
presents a method to collect and analyze key 
performance indicators of the DVB-H radio interface 
by using a mobile device as a measurement and data 
collection unit.

1. Introduction 
 
The verification of the DVB-H quality of service 
level can be done by carrying out field measurements 
within the coverage area. Correct way to obtain the 
most relevant measurement data, as well as the right 
interpretation of it, are fundamental for the detailed 
network planning and optimization as described in the 
paper [1] (ICDT 2008). 
During the normal operation of the DVB-H 
network, there are only few possibilities to carry out 
long-lasting and in-depth measurements. A simple and 
fast field measurement method based on mobile DVB-
H receiver provides thus added value for the operator. 
The mobile equipment is easy to carry both in outdoor 
and indoor environment, and it stores sufficiently 
detailed performance data for the post-processing. 
The measurements are required for the network 
performance revisions and for the indication of 
potential problems. As an example, the transmitter site 
antenna element might move due to the loose 
mounting, which results outages in the designed 
coverage area. The antenna feeder might still remain 
connected correctly, keeping the reflected power in 
acceptable level. As there are no alarms triggered in 
this type of instance, and as the basic DVB-H is a 
broadcast system without uplink and its related 
monitoring / alarming system, the most efficient way 
to verify this kind of fails is to carry out field tests. 
This paper is an extension to the publication [1], 
presenting a method to post-process the field test data 
collected with DVB-H mobile terminal. The method 
can be considered as an addition to the usual network 
performance testing carried out by the operator and is 
suitable for the fast revisions of the radio quality levels 
and possible network faults. 
The results presented in this paper are meant as 
examples and for clarifying the analysis methodology. 
The more detailed guidelines and examples of the 
related results can be found e.g. in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The 
data was collected with a commercial DVB-H hand-
held terminal capable of measuring and storing the 
radio link related data. In this specific case, a Nokia N-
92 terminal was used with a field test program. The 
program has been developed by Nokia for displaying 
and storing the most relevant DVB-H radio per-
formance indicators. 
 
2. Coding of DVB-H 
 
In order to carry the DVB-H IP datagrams of the 
MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS), a Multi Protocol 
Encapsulator (MPE) is defined for DVB. Each IP 
datagram is encapsulated into single MPE section. 
Elementary Stream (ES) takes care of the transporting 
of these MPE sections. Elementary Stream is thus a 
stream of packets belonging to the MPEG-2 Transport 
Stream and with a respective program identifier (PID). 
The MPE section consists of 12 byte header, 4 byte 
CRC-32 (Cyclic Redundancy Check), as well as a tail 
and payload length as described in [2, 7]. 
The main idea of MPE-FEC is to protect the IP 
datagrams of the time sliced burst with an additional 
link layer Reed-Solomon (RS) parity data. The RS data 
is encapsulated into the same MPE-FEC sections of the 
burst with the actual data. The RS part of the burst 
belongs into the same elementary stream (MPE-FEC 
section), but they have different table identifications. 
18

The benefit of this solution is that the receiver can 
distinguish between these sections, and if the terminal 
does not have the capability to use the DVB-H specific 
MPE-FEC, it can anyway decode the bursts although 
with lower quality when it experiences difficult radio 
conditions, according to [7, 8, 9, 10]. 
The part of the MPE-FEC frame that includes the IP 
datagrams is called application data table (ADT). ADT 
has a total of 191 columns. In case the IP datagrams do 
not fill completely the ADT field, the remaining part is 
padded with zeros. The division between ADT and RS 
table is shown in Figure 1. 
In DVB-H system, the number of the RS rows can 
be selected from the values of 256, 512, 768 and 1024. 
The amount of the rows is indicated in the signaling 
via the Service Information (SI). RS data has a total of 
64 columns. 
For each row, the 191 IP datagram bytes are used 
for calculating 64 parity bytes of RS rows. Also in this 
case, if the row is not filled completely, padding is 
used. The result is a relative deep interleaving as the 
application data is distributed for the whole bust.

Figure 1. The MPE-FEC frame consists of 
application data table for IP datagrams and Reed-
Solomon data table for RS parity bytes. 
 
The error correction of DVB-H is carried out with 
the widely used Reed-Solomon coding. The Reed-
Solomon code is based on the polynomial correction 
method. 
The 
polynomial 
is 
encoded 
for 
the 
transmission over the air interface. If the data is 
corrupted during the transmission, the receiving end 
can calculate the expected values of the data within the 
certain limits that depends on the settings. 
The RS data of DVB-H is sent in encoded blocks 
with the total number of m-bit symbols in the encoded 
block is n=2m-1. With 8-bit symbols the amount of 
symbols per block is n= 28-1 = 255. This is thus the 
total size of the DVB-H frame. 
The actual user data inside of the frame is defined 
as a parameter with a value k, which is the number of 
data symbols per block. Normal value of k is 223 and 
the parity symbol is 32 (with 8 bits per symbol). The 
universal format of presenting these values is (n,k) = 
(255,223). In this case, the code is capable of correct-
ing up to 16 symbol errors per block. 
RS can correct errors depending on the redundancy 
of the block. For the erroneous symbols which location 
is not known in advance, the RS code is capable of 
correcting up to (n-k)/2 symbols that contains errors. 
This means that RS can correct half as many errors as 
the amount of redundancy symbols is added in the 
block. 
If the location of errors is known (i.e. in case of 
erasures) then RS can correct twice as many erasures 
as errors. If Nerr is the number of errors and Ners the 
number of erasures in the block, the combination of 
error correction capability is obtained according to the 
formula 2Nerr + Ners < n. 
The characteristic of RS error correction is thus 
well suited to the environment with high probability of 
errors occurring in bursts, like in DVB-H radio 
interface. This is because it does not matter how many 
bits in the symbol are erroneous – if multiple errors 
occur in byte, it is considered as a single error. 
It is possible to use also other block sizes. The 
shortening can be done by padding the remaining 
(empty) part of the block (bytes). These padded bytes 
are not transmitted, but the receiving end fills in 
automatically the empty space. 
FEC (Forward Error Correction) is widely used in 
telecommunication systems in order to control the 
errors. In this method, the transmitting party adds 
redundant data to the message. On the other side, the 
receiving end can detect and correct the errors 
accordingly without the need to acknowledge the data 
correction. The method is thus suitable for especially 
uni-directional broadcast networks. 
FEC consists of block coding and convolutional 
coding. RS is an example of the block coding, where 
blocks or packets of bits (symbols) are of fixed size 
whereas convolutional coding is based on bit or 
symbol lengths. 
In practice, the block and convolutional codes are 
combined in concatenated coding schemes; the 
convolutional coding has the major role whereas the 
block code like RS cleans the errors after the convo-
lutional coding has taken place. In mobile communica-
19

tions, the convolutional codes are mostly decoded with 
the Viterbi algorithm. It is an error-correction scheme 
especially suitable for noisy digital communication 
links. 
The MPE-FEC has been designed taking into 
account the backwards compatibility. The DVB-T de-
modulation procedure contains error correction so both 
DVB-T and DVB-H utilizes it for the basic coding 
with Viterbi and Reed-Solomon decoding, whereas 
DVB-H can use also a combination of Viterbi, Reed-
Solomon and additional MPE-FEC to improve the C/N 
and Doppler performance [7]. The detection of the 
presence of MPE-FEC is done based on the single 
demodulated TS packet, as its header contains the error 
flag. MPE-FEC adds the performance in moving 
environment as it uses so called virtual interleaving 
over several basic FEC sections. 
In this study, the bit rates before and after the 
Viterbi as well as the frame error rates of DVB-H 
MPE-FEC and DVB-T specific FEC were observed by 
collecting and analyzing data in radio interface. The 
measurement principles of WingTV guidelines [2] 
were taken into consideration in the selection (limiting) 
of the parameter values. 
The guideline defines the MFER (MPE Frame Error 
Ratio) as a ratio of the number of residual erroneous 
frames that can not be recovered to the total number of 
the received frames: 
 
frames
received
frames
erroneous
residual
MFER
_
_
_
(%) =100
 
 
There are possibilities to obtain the MFER value by 
observing the frames during certain time (e.g. 20 
seconds), or as proposed by DVB, at least 100 frames 
should be collected in order to calculate the MFER 
with sufficient statistical reliability. 
The measurement principles of WingTV were used 
as a basis in the study by collecting 25 minutes of field 
data during a drive test with varying speeds, and the 
data was later post-processed in order to obtain the 
more specific relation between the FER, MFER and 
received power level categories. Although WingTV 
does not recommend the use of QEF as a criterion, also 
the bit errors were analyzed by utilizing the same 
principles for the comparison purposes. 
 
3. Test setup 
 
A test setup with a functional DVB-H transmitter 
site was utilized in order to investigate the presented 
field test methodology with respective post-processing 
and analysis. The site antenna safety distance zone was 
estimated by applying [11]. The investigated area 
represents relatively open sub-urban environment as 
shown in Figure 2. There are mainly relatively small 
trees, 
residential 
areas 
and 
highways 
in 
the 
investigated area with nearly-LOS in major part of the 
investigated area. 
 
 
Figure 2. The environment in main lobe of the 
transmitter antenna. 
 
The methodology was verified by carrying out 
various field tests mostly in vehicle. There was also 
static and dynamic pedestrian type of measurements 
included in the test cases in order to verify the usability 
of the equipment and methodology for the analysis. 
The DVB-H test network consisted of a single 200 
watt DVB-H transmitter and a basic DVB-H core 
network. The source data was delivered to the radio 
interface by capturing real-time television program. 
The program was converted to DVB-H IP data stream 
with standard DVB-H encoders. There was a set of 3 
DVB-H channels defined in the same radio frequency, 
with audio / video bit rates of 128, 256 and 384 kb/s. 
The number of FEC rows was selected as 256 for 
MPE-FEC rate of 1/2, and 512 for MPE-FEC rate of 
2/3. The audio part of the channel was coded with 
AAC using a total of 64 kb/s for stereophonic sound. 
The bandwidth was 6 MHz in 701 MHz frequency. 
The antenna system consisted of directional antenna 
panel array with 2 elements as shown in Figure 3. Each 
element produces 65 degrees of horizontal beam width 
and provides a gain of +13.1 dBi. 
 
 
Figure 3. The antenna system setup.

The vertical beam width of the single antenna 
element was 27 degrees, which was narrowed by 
locating two antennas on top of each others via a 
power splitter. Taking into account the loss of cabling, 
jumpers, connectors, power splitter and transmitter 
filter, the radiating power was estimated to be +62.0 
dBm (EIRP) in the main lobe. 
The transmitter antenna system was installed on a 
rooftop with 30 meters of height from the ground. The 
environment consisted of sub-urban and residential 
types with LOS (line-of-sight) or nearly LOS in major 
part of the test route, excluding the back lobe direction 
of the site which was non-LOS due to the shadowing 
of the site building. Each test route consisted of two 
rounds in the main lobe of the antenna with a 
minimum received power level of about -90 dBm. The 
maximum distance between the antenna system and 
terminals was about 6.4 km during the drive tests. 
The terminals were kept in the same position inside 
the vehicle without external antenna, and the results of 
each test case were saved in separate text files. The 
terminal setup is shown in Figure 4. The external 
antenna was not used because the aim was to revise the 
quality that the end-user experiences in normal 
conditions inside the moving vehicle. On the other 
hand, the test cases were not designed for certain 
coverage area, but the aim was to classify the 
performance indicators in function of the received 
power levels. It does not matter thus if the received 
power level is interpreted via external or internal 
antenna.  
 
 
Figure 4. The terminal measurement setup. 
 
If the relevant data can be measured from the radio 
interface and stored in text format, the method 
presented in this paper is independent of the terminal 
type. It is important to notice, though, that the 
characteristics of the terminal affects on the analysis, 
i.e. the terminal noise factor and the antenna gain 
(which is normally negative in case of small DVB-H 
terminals) should be taken into account accordingly. 
On the other hand, unlike with the advanced field 
measurement equipment, the method gives a good idea 
about the quality that the DVB-H users observe in real 
life as the terminal type with its limitations is the same 
as used in commercial networks. 
There were a total of 3 terminals used in each test 
case for capturing the radio signal simultaneously. 
Multiple receptions provide respectively more data to 
be collected at the same time, which increases the 
statistical reliability of the measurements. It also makes 
possible the comparison of the differences between the 
terminal performances. 
 
4. Terminal measurement principles 
 
The DVB-H parameter set was adjusted according 
to each test case. The cases included the variation of 
the code rate (CR) with the values of 1/2 and 2/3, 
MPE-FEC rate with the values of 1/2 and 2/3 and 
interleaving size FFT with the values of 2k, 4k, 8k, in 
accordance with the Wing TV principles described in 
[3], [4], [5] and [6]. The guard interval (GI) was fixed 
to 1/4 in each case. The parameter set was tuned for 
each case, and the audio / video stream was received 
with all the terminals by driving the test route two 
consecutive times per each parameter setting. 
The needed input for the field test is the “on” and 
“off” time of the time sliced burst, PID (Packet 
Identifier) of the investigated burst, the number of FEC 
rows and the radio parameter values (frequency, 
modulation, code rate and bandwidth). The terminal 
stores the measurement results to a log file after the 
end of each burst until the field test execution is 
terminated. 
According to the DVB-H implementation guide-
lines [2], the target quality of service is the following: 
• 
For the bit error rate after Viterbi (BA), the 
reception should comply at least DVB-H specific 
QEF (quasi error free) point 2⋅10-4. 
• 
The frame error rate should be less than 5%. In 
case of FER, i.e. DVB-T, this criterion is called 
FER5, and for the DVB-H specific MPE-FEC, its 
name is MFER5. 
The field test software of N-92 is capable of 
collecting the RSSI (received power levels in dBm), 
FER (Frame Error Rate) and MFER (MPE Frame 
Error Rate, i.e. FER after MPE-FEC correction) 
values. In addition, there is possibility to collect 
information about the packet errors.

Figure 5 shows a high-level block diagram of the 
DVB-H receiver [2]. The reception of the Transport 
Stream (TS) is compatible with DVB-T system, and 
the demodulation is thus done with the same principles 
also in DVB-H. The additional DVB-H specific 
functionality consists of Time Sliced burst handling, 
MPE-FEC module and the DVB-H de-encapsulation.

As can be seen from Figure 5, the FER information, 
i.e. frame errors before MPE-FEC specific analysis, is 
obtained after the Time Slicing process, and the MFER 
is obtained after the MPE-FEC module. If the data 
after MPE-FEC is free of errors, the respective data 
frame is de-encapsulated correctly and the IP output 
stream can be observed without disturbances. 
The measurement point for the received power level 
is found after the antenna element and the optional 
GSM interference filter. In addition, there might be 
optional external antenna connector implemented in 
the terminal before the RF reference point. The 
presence of the filter and antenna connector has thus 
frequency-dependent loss effect on the measured 
received power level in the RF point. 
Figure 6 shows an example of the measurement 
data file. The example shows 4 consecutive test results. 
Each measurement field contains information about the 
occurred frame error (FER), frame error after MPE-
FEC correction (MFER), bit error rate before Viterbi 
(BB) and after Viterbi (BA), packet errors (PA) and 
received power level (RSSI) in dBm. In this case, there 
was a frame error in the reception of the first 
measurement sample because the value of FER was 
“1”. The FER value is either “0” for non-erroneous or 
“1” for erroneous frame. The MPE-FEC procedure 
could still recover the error in this case, because the 
MFER parameter is showing a value of “0”. The 
second sample shows that there were no frame errors 
before or after the MPE-FEC. The third sample shows 
again frame error that could be corrected with MPE-
FEC. The fourth sample shows an error that could not 
be corrected any more with MPE-FEC. In the latter 
case, the bit error information could not be calculated 
either. It seems that in this specific case, the RSSI 
value of about -87 dBm to -89 dBm has been the limit 
for the correct reception of the frames with MPE-FEC. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Example of the measured objects with 
four consecutive results for FER, MFER, BB, BA, 
PE and RSSI. 
 
The plain measurement data has to be post-
processed in order to analyze the breaking points for 
the edge of the performance. Microsoft Excel 
functionality was utilized in order to arrange the data 
in function of the received power levels. 
According to the first sample of Figure 6, the bit 
error level before Viterbi (BB) was close to the QEF 
point, i.e. 2.5⋅10-2. The bit error level after the Viterbi 
(BA) was 1.2⋅10-3 which is already better than the QEF 
point for the acceptable reception. The bit error rate 
had been thus low enough for the correct reception of 
the signal. In this example, the amount of packet errors 
(PE) was between 7 and 75, and the averaged received 
power level was measured and averaged to -87…-89 
dBm. It is worth noting that the RSSI resolution is 1 
dB for single measurement event in the used version of 
the field test software. 
Figure 7 shows the measured RSSI values during 
the complete test route. There were two rounds done 
during each test. The back lobe area of the test route 
can be seen in the middle of Figure, with fast 
momentarily drop of received power level. The 
received power level was about -50 dBm close to the 
site, and about -90 dBm in the cell edge. The duration 
of the single test route was approximately 25 minutes, 
and the total length of the route was 22.4 km. 
The maximum speed during the test route was about 
90 km/h, and the average speed was measured to 50 
km/h (excluding the full stop periods). The speed is 
sufficient for identifying the effect of the MPE-FEC.

Figures 8 and 9 present the estimated coverage area 
for QPSK and 16-QAM cases with the code rate of 1/2 
and MPE-FEC rate of 3/4. The Okumura-Hata based 
propagation model [10] was used with a digital map 
that contains the elevation data and cluster type 
information. The minimum received outdoor power 
level limit for QPSK was estimated as -84 dBm and for 
16-QAM as -78 dBm. 
The 80 % area location probability criterion was 
used in these coverage plots. The grid size is 1.6 km. 
(Background map source: Google Map).

direction form the site.

Based on the coverage plots, the test route was 
selected accordingly. The coverage plots correlated 
roughly with the drive tests, although the in-depth 
location-dependent signal level measurements were not 
carried out during this specific study. 
 
5. Method for the analysis 
 
The collected data was processed accordingly in 
order to obtain the breaking points, i.e. the QEF of 2 ⋅ 
10-4 and FER / MFER of 5% in function of the RSSI 
values for each test case. The processing was carried 
out by arranging the occurred events per RSSI value. 
For the BB and BA, the values were averaged per 
RSSI resolution of 1 dB. For the FER and MFER, the 
values represent the percentage of the erroneous 
frames compared to the total frame count per each 
individual RSSI value (with the resolution of 1 dB). 
Figure 10 shows an example of the processed data 
for the bit error rate before and after the Viterbi for 16-
QAM, CR 2/3, MPE-FEC 2/3 and FFT 2k. The results 
represent the situation over the whole test route in 
location-independent way, i.e. the results show the 
collected and averaged BB and BA values that have 
occurred related to each RSSI value in varying radio 
conditions. 
As can be noted in this specific example, the bit 
error rate before Viterbi does not comply with the QEF 
criteria of 2⋅10-4 even in relatively good radio 
conditions, whereas the Viterbi clearly enhances the 
performance. The resulting breaking point for the QEF 
23

with Viterbi can be found around -78 dBm of RSSI in 
this specific case.

For the frame error rate, the similar analysis yields 
an example that can be observed in Figure 12. Figure 
shows the occurred frame error counts (FER and 
MFER) as well as the amount of error-free events 
analyzed separately for each RSSI value. In this 
format, Figure 12 shows the amount of occurred 
samples in function of RSSI in 1 dB raster arranged to 
error free counts (“FER0, MFER0”), to counts that had 
error but could be corrected with MPE-FEC (“FER1, 
MFER0”), and to counts that were erroneous even 
after MPE-FEC (“FER1, MFER1”). 
It can be noted that the amount of the occurred 
events is relatively low in the best field strength cases 
and does not necessarily provide with sufficient 
statistical reliability in that range of RSSI values. 
Nevertheless, as the idea was to observe the 
performance especially in the limits of the coverage 
area, it is sufficient to collect reliable data around the 
critical RSSI value ranges.

In this type of analysis, the data begins to be 
statistically sufficiently reliable when several tens of 
occasions per RSSI value are obtained, preferably 
around 100 samples as stated in [3]. In practice, 
though, the problem arises from the available time for 
the measurements, i.e. in order to collect about 100 
samples per RSSI value in large scale it might take 
more than one hour to complete a single test case. 
There were a total of 32 test drive rounds carried out, 
25 minutes each. In this case, the post-processing and 
analysis was limited to 2 terminals though due to the 
extensive amount of data. 
The corresponding amount of total samples was 
normalized, i.e. scaled to 0-100% separately for each 
RSSI value. An example of this is shown in Figures 13 
and 14. 
By presenting the results in this way, the percentage 
of FER and MFER per RSSI and thus the breaking 
point of FER / MFER can be obtained graphically. 
The 5% FER and MFER levels, i.e. FER5 and 
MFER5, can be obtained graphically for each case 
observing the breaking point for the respective curves. 
The corresponding MPE-FEC gain can be interpreted 
by investigating the difference between FER5 and 
MFER5 values (in dB). The graphics shows the 
observation point directly along the 5% error line. The 
parameter values of the following examples are still 
16-QAM, CR 2/3, MPE-FEC 2/3 and FFT 2k.

Figure 15. The processed data can also be 
presented in cumulative format over the whole

about the RSSI range of the correction. 
As additional information about the FEC and MPE-
FEC performance in the whole scale of 0-100%, the 
cumulative presentation can be observed as shown in 
Figure 15. This format gives indication about the RSSI 
range where the MPE-FEC starts correcting. 
The results presented in this case can be post-
processed further in order to fragment the test routes 
into the more specific area and radio channel types.

Figure 16. The segments of the test route. 
 
Segments A and E represents the terminal moving 
away from the site in LOS within the main lobe of the 
antenna beam, with a maximum speed of about 70 
km/hour and with a good field strength. Segments B 
and F represents the LOS or nearly LOS with the 
terminal moving with a maximum speed of 70-80 
km/h, and the area represents the cell edge or near the 
cell edge, depending on the selected modes. Segment 
C represent the terminal moving towards the site with a 
maximum speed of 90 km/h, with a good field strength 
and LOS. Segment D represents the situation in back 
lobe of the antenna with N-LOS situation due to the 
shadowing of the site building, with the terminal speed 
varying between 0 and 80 km/h. 
Having the segmentation done according to Figure 
16, it can be seen that in the good field, as expected, 
the occurred FER and MFER instances are minimal 
and they do not affect on the reception of the DVB-H 
audio / video streams. Furthermore, the MPE-FEC 
does not bring enhancements for the performance 
within such a good field. 
The most interesting parts of the segments are thus 
the ones that represents the situation nearer to the cell 
edge, both in main lobe (B and F) and in back lobe 
(D).

Figure 18. The cumulative presentation of FER 
and MFER gives a rough indication about the 
performance within the investigated area. 
Compared to Figure 15, the main lobe analysis 
produces clearer picture about single radio 
channel type. 
 
 
It is worth noting, though, that this format gives 
only an indication about the RSSI range where the 
different modes of error correction tends to occur, i.e. 
the clean samples (FER0, MFER0), the successful 
MPE-FEC corrections (FER1, MFER0), and when the 
MPE-FEC is not able to correct the data (FER1, 
MFER1). 
As a comparison, the N-LOS segment D yields 
Figures 19 and 20. The behaviour of the curves is not 
as clear as it is in main lobe. In addition to the 
attenuated N-LOS, the multi-path propagated signals 
are not strong in this area. It is though worth noting 
that the amount of the collected data is quite low, in 
order of 100-150 samples, which reduces considerably 
the reliability of the back lobe analysis.

6. Terminal comparison 
 
The terminal measures the received power level 
after the possible GSM interference suppression filter. 
There might also be external antenna connectors in 
either side of the filter. The terminal characteristics 
thus affects on the received power level interpretation. 
In order to obtain information about the possible 
differences 
of 
the 
terminal 
displays, 
separate 
comparison measurements were carried out. 
There were a total of three terminals used during 
the testing. As the terminals were still prototypes, the 
calibration of the RSSI displays was not verified. This 
adds uncertainty factor to the test results. 
Figure 21 shows a test case that was carried out in 
laboratory by keeping all the terminals in the same 
position and making slow-moving rounds within 
relatively good coverage area.

Figure 21. An example of the laboratory test case 
for the comparison of the RSSI displays of the 
terminals. 
 
The systematic difference in RSSI displays can be 
noted, being about 2 dB between the extreme values. 
The same 2 dB difference between the terminals was 
noted in the field test analysis. The values obtained 
from the radio network tests cannot thus be considered 
accurate. Nevertheless, the idea of the testing was to 
investigate 
rather 
the 
methodology 
of 
the 
measurements than to obtain accurate values of the 
defined parameter settings. 
In the in-depth analysis, in addition to the RSSI, 
also more specific differences between the terminals 
can be investigated. As Figures 22, 23 and 24 show, 
there is a systematic difference margin between the 
three utilized terminals as for the QEF, FER5 and 
MFER5. As a conclusion of Figures, in order to 
minimize the error margin that arises from the 
differences of the BER, FER and MFER interpretation 
of different terminals, it is important to calibrate the 
models accordingly.

7. Building penetration loss 
 
For the comparison purposes, there was also a set of 
test cases carried out in pedestrian environment with 
the same measurement methodology as described 
previously. 
When designing the indoor coverage, the respective 
building loss should be taken into account. The loss 
depends on the building type and material. As an 
example, Figure 25 shows a relatively short 
measurement carried out in outdoor and indoor of a 
10-floor hotel building within the coverage area of the 
investigated DVB-H network.

Figure 25. An example of short snap-shot type 
indoor and outdoor measurements carried out in 
the DVB-H trial network coverage area. 
 
The building loss of Figure 25 can be obtained by 
calculating the difference of the received power values. 
The indoor average received power level is -73.4 dBm 
with a standard deviation of 5.7 dB. The outdoor 
values are -57.3 dBm and 3.9 dB, respectively. The 
building loss in this specific case is thus 16.1 dB. The 
value is logical as the building represents relatively 
heavy construction type, although the roof top was 
partially covered by large areas of class resulting 
relatively good signal propagation to interior of the 
building via the diffraction. 
The test was repeated in selected spots inside and 
outside of the buildings, in variable field strengths both 
in main lobe and back lobe of the site antenna radiation 
pattern. As a general note, the static or low-speed 
pedestrian cases did not initiate the MPE-FEC 
functionality. Obviously more multi-path propagated 
signals and/or higher terminal speed would have been 
needed in order to “wake up” the MPE-FEC. 
In the general case, the building loss should be 
estimated depending on the overall building type, 
height etc. in each environment type. In case of new 
areas, the best way for the estimation is to carry out 
sufficient amount of sample measurements for the 
most typical building types, although for the initial link 
budget estimations, the average of 12-16 dB could be a 
good starting point according to these tests. 
 
8. Effects on the coverage estimation 
 
Based on the measurement results, a tuned link 
budget can now be build up by using the essential 
radio parameters according to Figure 26.

Figure 26. The main principle of the DVB-H link 
budget. 
 
In order to estimate the useful cell radius of the 
DVB-H radio transmission, propagation prediction 
models can be used. One of the most used one in 
broadcast environment is the Okumura-Hata model, 
which is suitable as such for the macro cell type of 
environments [12]. The model functions sufficiently 
well in practice when the height of the transmitter site 
antenna is below 200 meters, and the frequency range 
is of 150-1500 MHz. The model is reliable for the cell 
ranges up to 20 km. The corrected Okumura-Hata 
prediction model for the distances over 20 km is 
defined in CCIR report 567-3. It is sufficient to 
estimate the cell radius for the high-power DVB-H 
transmitter sites with the radius up to 50 km. The most 
recent model that is especially suitable for the large 
variety of distances and transmitter antenna heights is 
ITU-R P.1546, which is based on the mapping of the 
pre-calculated curves. [13] 
Based on the field test examples shown previously, 
the MPE-FEC gain can be included for the sensitivity 
Figure, compared to the DVB-T case which contains 
only FEC. The gain varies depending on the terminal 
speed and environment type, so the fine-tuning of the 
link budget should be considered depending on the 
local conditions.

9. Field test results 
 
9.1. Complete route 
 
As a result of the vehicle based field tests 
performed in this study, the following Tables 1-3 
summarizes the RSSI thresholds for the QEF point of 
2⋅10-4 and FER / MFER of 5% criteria with different 
parameter values for the whole test route. In addition, 
the effect of MPE-FEC was obtained graphically for 
each parameter setting. The analysis was made for the 
post-processed data by observing the breaking points 
of BA, FER and MFER of the averaged values of 2 
terminals (the other one resulting 2 dB lower RSSI). 
The guard interval (GI) was set to 1/4 in each case. 
The MPE-FEC gain was obtained for each studied 
case. The effect seems to be lowest for the 64-QAM 
modulation, which might be an indication of too small 
amount of collected data in the relatively good field 
that this mode requires, although 64-QAM seems to be 
in general very sensible for errors. 
It should be noted, though, that the terminals were 
not calibrated especially for this study. The RSSI 
display might thus differ from the real received power 
levels with roughly 1-2 decibels. The calibration 
should be done e.g. by examining first the level of the 
noise floor of the terminal and secondly examining the 
QEF point, i.e. investigating the signal level which is 
just sufficient to provide the correct receiving. 
 
 
 
 
 
As stated in [2], the moving channel produces fast 
variations already in TU6 channel type (typical urban 6 
km/h) in the QEF criterion making the interpretation of 
the bit error rate before Viterbi very challenging. This 
also leads to the uncertainty of the correct calculation 
of the bit error rate after Viterbi. For the bit error rate 
before and after Viterbi, it is not thus necessarily clear 
how the terminal calculates the BB and BA values 
especially in the cell edge with high error rates. It has 
been also stated e.g. in [14] that QEF is not suitable for 
the instantaneous measurement due to the high 
variation that occurs in the mobile channel. This 
phenomena can be noted in the field test results as the 
breaking points of the QEF does not necessarily map 
to the corresponding FER / MFER criteria of 5% or 
near of it. It can thus be assumed that the most reliable 
results are obtained by observing the FER / MFER of 
the data, because their error detection is carried out 
after the whole demodulation and decoding process. 
Furthermore, especially the frame error rate reflects 
the practical situation as the user interpretation of the 
quality of the audio / video contents depends directly 
on the amount of correctly received frames. 
Nevertheless, the results correlate with the theory of 
different parameter settings, as well as with the MPE-
FEC gain although it varies largely in the obtained 
results depending on the mode. As the test route 
contained different radio channel types (different 
vehicle speeds, LOS, near-LOS and non-LOS behind 
the building), the mix of the propagation types causes 
this effect on the results. In order to obtain the values 
nearer to the theoretical ones, it is important to carry 
out the test cases in separate, uniform areas as the radio 
channel type is considered, but on the other hand, these 
results represent the real situation in the investigated 
area with a practical mix of radio channel types. 
 
9.2. Segmented route in main lobe

Figure 28. The summary of FER5 and MFER5 
analysis. 
 
It can be noted that the MPE-FEC functions more 
efficiently in this specific fragmented case, i.e. in the 
uniform radio channel of 80 km/h in cell edge area 
compared to the results obtained by analysing the 
whole test area with fixed radio channel types. 
As a comparison, the difference of the QEF point 
and FER / MFER can now be obtained as shown in 
Figures 29 and 30. 
In this case, it seems that the breaking point of QEF 
occurs somewhere between the FER5 and MFER5 
values. As stated before, the QEF calculation is not 
necessarily as reliable as FER and MFER can show, 
but nevertheless, it is interesting to note that in this 
specific setup the QEF breaking point is within ±1.6 
dB margin if we take simply the average of the FER 
and MFER values. QEF indicates thus the RSSI limits 
roughly in the same range as the FER and MFER does.

10. Conclusions 
 
The tests presented in this paper show that the 
realistic DVB-H measurement data can be collected 
with the terminals. The analysis showed correlation 
between the post-processed data and estimated 
coverage that was calculated and plotted separately 
with a network planning tool. The results correlate 
mostly with the theoretical DVB-H performance, 
although there was a set of uncertainty factors 
identified that affects on the accuracy of the results. 
This study was meant to develop and verify the 
functionality of the methodology for measurements, 
post-processing and analysis, and as a secondary 
result, it also gave performance values for selected 
parameter set. The test environment consisted of 
multiple radio channel types, and the terminal displays 
were not calibrated specifically for these tests. An 
error of 1-2 decibels in RSSI values is thus expected. 
The field test results show clearly the effect of the 
parameter values on radio performance in a typical 
sub-urban environment. Even if the hand-held terminal 
is not the most accurate device for the scientific 
purposes, it gives an overview about the general 
functioning and quality level of the network and the 
estimation of the effects of different network parameter 
settings. 
The vehicle related test cases showed a logical 
functioning of MPE-FEC for different parameter 
settings. The results are in align with the theories 
especially when the analyzed data is limited to a single 
radio channel type in coverage edge of the main lobe 
with nearly LOS situation and with a vehicle speed of 
about 80 km/h. This case showed relatively significant 
effect of the MPE-FEC functionality giving a gain of 
up to 7 dB, which thus enhances the link budget and 
extends the coverage area compared to the basic FEC. 
On the other side, in the good field, the MPE-FEC is 
not needed as there are no frame errors present. 
The whole test route can be analyzed also as one 
complete case, giving the overall information about the 
network performance in variable radio channels. It 
should be noted though that this case does not give 
comparable values for the performance measurements 
like the case is for the single radio channel. 
The pedestrian test cases showed that the building 
loss can be obtained in easy way with the test setup. 
The analysis also showed that the MPE-FEC does not 
take place with such a low speeds even in low field 
strengths if there is lack of reflected multi-path 
propagated components. As the city center areas 
contains normally relatively good field and their main 
usage can be estimated to be pedestrian cases, the 
results indicates that the MPE-FEC setting could thus 
be relatively light in city areas, in order of 3/4 or 5/6, 
which gives still some MPE-FEC gain for sufficiently 
fast moving terminals, yet saving the capacity. 
Regardless of the Excel sheet functionality that was 
developed for post-processing the data, there was a 
considerable amount of manual procedures in order to 
obtain the final results. As a possible future work item, 
basically all of the manual work can be automated by 
creating respective macro functionality for transferring 
the data from the terminal to the processing unit, to 
organize the data in function of the RSSI values, and to 
present the analysis in graphical and numerical format. 
Based on the methodology presented in this paper, the 
processing of the data is independent of the terminal 
type, but the special characteristics should be taken 
into account in the result tuning, as well as the proper 
calibration of the equipment. Furthermore, if the 
interface between the terminal and data processing unit 
supports proper protocols for fetching the data during 
the measurements, the post-processing and display can 
be performed in real time whilst carrying out the drive 
tests.
