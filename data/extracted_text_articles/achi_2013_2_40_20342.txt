Abstract— In this paper, we focus on a possibility to have a 
personal 3D GUI inside a virtual environment on tablet device. 
We describe the visual design process and user experience 
evaluation of four 3D GUIs in a virtual environment. A user 
evaluation was conducted by using a structured pair 
evaluation 
procedure, 
where 
we 
adapted 
a 
concept 
walkthrough method with non-functional visually high quality 
prototypes. We found that participants would like to have 
their personal 3D GUI in a virtual environment. However, the 
visual design of the 3D GUI should create a secure and private 
feeling for them. Also, participants did not want the GUI to 
occlude too much with the background. The visual indication 
is needed also when a user transfers items from personal GUI 
to the virtual environment and for showing the user's active 
position between the GUI and virtual environment. We point 
out also other issues for interaction and visual designers.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Three dimensional (3D) collaborative games, for 
example, Order and Chaos [20], have been developed 
already for touch screen tablet devices, such as Apple iPad. 
There have also been interests in bringing virtual 
environments (VEs) such as Second Life (SL) [18] to the 
tablets. The first 3D viewer for SL is Lumiya for Android 
tablets [19]. In 3D VEs, users can see 3D objects and other 
people's avatars in 3D space. To carry out other activities, 
such as reading personal emails, browsing files or playing 
games, a user cannot do this in VE, but she/he needs to 
switch to another application, which may weaken the 3D 
environment experience. In this paper, we explore different 
approaches to that problem by focusing on a possibility to 
have a personal 3D graphical user interface (GUI) inside a 
VE. By a personal GUI, we mean a private user interface 
(UI) showed only to the user, not visible publicly, in contrast 
to embedded elements in VEs visible to all users. 
3D UIs and VEs have been studied over many decades 
with PCs using several input devices. There is only little 
research done with tablet devices [23], as earlier studies 
have focused on larger touch displays such as tables [11][27] 
and screens on the wall [14].  Bowman et al. [5] define a 3D 
UI as a UI that involves 3D interaction, which means 
human-computer interaction (HCI) where a user performs 
tasks directly in a 3D context. Based on this definition, a 3D 
interaction can be defined so that it comprises navigation, 
object manipulation, application control [5][12][29] and 
visual design [7]. Many earlier 3D UI studies have focused 
on 3D file browsing, because 3D allows a larger set of items 
to be displayed at the same time [15][22][8]. Also 3D menus 
and metaphors have been investigated a lot over the years 
and the most popular 3D metaphors are: tree, mirror, 
elevator, book, art gallery, card and the hinged metaphor 
[10]. As tablet devices have been used for reading books and 
magazines, a bookshelf metaphor has become quite popular 
for displaying content, for example, in the Apple iPad [2]. 
Also 3D carousel metaphors have been under a large 
interest, both in industry and academy [14][21][30].  
Different kinds of 3D and 2½D desktops have been designed 
and studied as well [1][17][26].   
VEs are social in their nature, but if there are personal 
items in there, then privacy should be clearly visualized to 
the user. Culnan [9] defines privacy as: "The ability of 
individuals to control the terms under which their personal 
information is acquired and used". Privacy is a large 
research topic, but in this paper, we focus only on visual 
indication of the privacy in VEs. The prior research has 
focused mainly on e-commerce applications for selling 
either real world products or virtual products for avatars [24] 
or for information exchange between avatars [16]. Butz et al. 
[6] introduced two visual indication ways (vampire mirror 
and privacy lamps) for indicating which items are shared 
and which are private. However, they did not report any 
tests with users.  
The research of personal 3D UI elements (e.g. objects, 
menu items and files) in a collaborative virtual environment 
is still lacking from a visual design, user experience (UX) 
and mobile tablet device point of view. This paper 
investigates users' expectations of a personal 3D GUI in a 
collaborative VE in the early design phase and offers 
preliminary user feedback on visual design and indication of 
privacy. First, we present the visual design of metaphors and 
preparation of user experience evaluation study examples. 
Then, we describe the study with 40 participants conducted 
with non-functional visually high quality prototypes. 
Finally, we report the results and point out factors that 
designers should consider when designing 3D GUIs for VEs 
on touch screen tablet devices. 
II. 
USER EXPERIENCE CENTERED DESIGN 
ISO 9241-110:2010 [13] defines user experience as: "a 
person's perceptions and responses that results from the use 
and/or anticipated use of a product, system or service". User 
experience cannot be designed, because it is in people, but it 
is 
possible 
to 
'Design 
for 
experiencing' 
[25].

Figure 1.  3D GUI metaphors:  A) sketches, B) in a virtual environment and C) with a 'file searching and sharing' use case.
To 'design for experiencing', we used the industrial 
design process [28]. First, we explored approximately 40 
existing 3D UIs and concept designs. Then, based on this 
benchmarking, literature and lessons learned from our earlier 
studies [3][23] with 3D UIs we identified three major design 
goals: 1) Design a 3D GUI in a collaborative virtual 
environment, 2) Support the use of multiple applications 
within the 3D virtual environment and 3) Design for 3D 
interaction on a touch screen (for example, object selection 
from the back rear of a carousel UI). After this, we started 
the concept design for the 3D GUI metaphors. Finally, we 
prepared four designs for user experience evaluation.  
A. Two Design Phases 
We started the first design phase with the preparation of 
five different styled visual theme boards to help us create 
visuals for the concepts. These A4 sized boards were 
composed as a collage of images of different visual forms of 
the titled style. Then, we had the first brainstorming session 
utilizing 
the 
visual 
theme 
boards 
with 
two 
industrial/interaction designers and a UX researcher. This 
resulted in different kinds of ideas, advice and needs that 
were written down. Next, we had a one week individual 
sketching phase when we produced over 100 sketches of 3D 
GUI metaphors. Then, we had an expert evaluation of the 
concepts with eight project members. 
The second design phase was started with an individual 
sketching period. We developed the selected concepts of the 
first design phase further and in more detail. Then, the 
sketches (approximately 50) were evaluated by eight UI and 
UX professionals. Based on the evaluation, four 3D GUI 
metaphors: Room, Shelves, Pie, Keyring (Fig. 1, A) were 
selected for the 3D modeling phase, because they were 
comparable against each other. Room and Shelves metaphors 
have a similar visual style and both of them had a binder 
metaphor for files but a different amount of icons and depth 
of space. Pie and Keyring are examples of the carousel 
metaphor, but with different visual style, hierarchy level 
structure and amount of icons.  
B. File Searhing and Sharing Use Case 
We wanted to have an example with hierarchical 
structure in the GUIs; therefore, we designed also a step-by-
step use case (file searching and sharing) for each concept 
(Fig. 1, C), which are presented in Table 1. The idea of the 
use case was to search for a PDF file (named as PDF 2), 
copy and share it to a pre-named contact.  
C. Modeling of 3D GUI Metaphors and 3D Icons 
The 3D models of the selected concepts were created by 
using the Blender program. First, we designed and modeled 
the GUI elements and 3D icons for our 3D GUI metaphors. 
We selected applications that can be used in the tablet 
context (e.g. mail, phone, messaging, notebook, radio, maps, 
contacts, books, browsers, gallery, folder, trashcan, calendar, 
camera, games, music player and social media services). We 
had a set of 33 icons to be used in our GUI metaphor 
designs. The amount of icons in every design varied, because 
we wanted to have a different evaluation setup for each 
concept in order to evaluate UI hierarchy structures and the 
amount of objects displayed in the UI metaphor and on the 
screen at once. There were 31 icons in the Room concept's 
first view, but in the Shelves, there were only seventeen, 
which are either fully or partially shown icons. The Keyring

User:  Zooms in with a pinch zoom 
gesture.  
User: Taps the PDF binder icon. 
System:  Opens the binder in the center 
of the screen.  
User: Taps the 'PDF 2' index marker 
System: Turns the page and the 
intended PDF is in sight. 
User: Tap the PDF binder icon on the shelf 
on the left side of the screen. 
System: Activates and moves a shelf (that 
the binder is located on) near the center 
area of the screen and opens the binder in 
the center of the screen. 
User: Taps the binder icon which was located on 
a one piece of the Pie. 
System: The tapped piece of Pie drops one step 
down and the system opens three sub-pieces of 
the Pie on the same horizontal level. Three icons 
are located on top of the pieces; W (Word), PP 
(PowerPoint) and PDF (2nd hierarchy level).  
User: Taps the PDF icon. 
System: Sub-pieces opens under the Pie GUI in 
the format of a hierarchical helical stairs (3rd 
hierarchy level). 
User: Taps the binder icon. 
System: Vertically orientated sub-ring with 
three icons; W, PP and PDF appears to hang 
from the original ring. 
User: Tap the PDF icon. 
System: Another sub-ring opens horizontally 
to the icon's place  
User: Zooms in (Fig. 1, C, Keyring).

concept included 28 icons and Pie ten icons in the first menu 
hierarchy level. Finally, we made compositions for 'file 
searching and sharing' use cases by moving and duplicating 
modeled UI elements. 
D. Preparation of the Prototypes 
We decided to evaluate our four designs as non-
functional visually high quality prototypes in as early design 
phase as possible to get user feedback for the next iteration 
of our concepts with a fast, easy and cost-effective way.  
Because we were interested in finding out the user 
experiences of the visual aspects, it was important to make 
high quality looking evaluation examples. Based on our 
design goals, we wanted to evaluate how users perceive the 
3D GUIs in a virtual environment (Fig. 1, B). Therefore, we 
selected one 3D model of a collaborative looking virtual 
outdoor music environment from our earlier research work 
[3] and rendered out one image of it from Blender. Then, we 
rendered each image of the metaphors with the step-by-step 
use case and placed them on a VE background in Photoshop.   
We then added a life-sized 10 inch tablet frame around the 
images. Finally, we added images of hands which were 
representing the touch gestures on top of the use case images 
(Fig. 1, C) and saved the image series as PDFs. 
III. 
USER EXPERIENCE EVALUATION 
As we were interested in users' subjective experiences, 
we conducted the study by using structured pair evaluation 
and adapted the design walkthrough method in a controlled 
setting, which lasted from 25 to 59 minutes. We used 
different methods to gather user feedback and experiences: 
video recording, semi structured interviewing, observation 
with writing down comments. First, in the beginning of the 
evaluation, users filled up a short background questionnaire 
which had questions about participants' gender, age, prior 
touch screen and 3D experience. The actual design 
walkthrough was conducted as follows for each 3D GUI 
concepts: Showing the 3D GUIs on a 3D VE with the 'file 
searching and sharing' use case on a life-sized tablet frame as 
a PDF from a laptop where the moderator changed the image 
and led the discussion.  She asked participants to comment 
freely what they are thinking and also asked additional 
questions now and then. 
A. Participants  
In our user evaluation, we had 40 persons of which 63% 
were male. For recruiting participants, we used an online test 
user environment and also sent email invitations to friends 
and colleagues to be distributed. The criterion for selecting 
participants was that each of them should have at least two 
months’ experience with touch screen devices (mobile 
phones or tablets). Almost all of the participants (93%) had 
prior touch screen experience with smart phones and 85% of 
them had tried or used tablet devices. The participants' age 
varied from 23 to 52 years, with a mean of 35.  
I. 
 FINDINGS 
All the material was qualitative, which we analyzed by 
applying the affinity diagram method [4]. We wrote down 
participants comments on sticky-notes. Then, we made two 
analysis rounds for notes and grouped them based on their 
content. A summary of the analysis is presented in Table 2. 
In the following subsections, we present participants’ 
perceived aspects and comments on the 3D GUIs in 3D VE.  
A. Perceived Visual Appearance 
The Room metaphor (Fig. 1, B) was considered as a 
'homely' GUI where one's own applications are in order. The 
Room metaphor was also called as 'garage' or 'storage', but it 
was also regarded as childish and funny like 'a toy store'. 
18% of the participants thought that the Shelves concept was 
better, clearer, more approachable and pleasurable than the 
Room GUI. The Pie GUI metaphor (Fig. 1, B), in its turn, 
was perceived as interesting, new, exciting and visually 
43

ACHI 2013 : The Sixth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

attractive. On the other hand, the Pie was regarded as an 
official, masculine and engineering type of object and was 
called as 'a disk' or 'hard drive'. The visual style of the Pie's 
plate was perceived to be bulky, chunky and too thick and it 
was called 'a concrete plate', 'tray', 'puzzle', 'Battle Star 
Galactic' or 'puck'. It was even suggested that the plate could 
be translucent. The visual style of the Keyring (Fig. 1, B) 
was considered to be new, different, interesting and fun. On 
the other hand, one participant commented that it is:" a 
moment's wow". Compared to the Pie, the Keyring was 
regarded as a feminine object and it was called as a kitsch 
bracelet. It was also referred to movement, for example, to 'a 
shower curtain rack', 'coat hanger rack', 'mobile', and 
'janitor's key ring'. One person even said: "I don't like if it's 
swinging". 
Participants liked the fact that they can easily get an 
overview of the GUI with one glance, with other GUIs than 
the Shelves. 15% of the participants did not like that all of 
the icons are not showing. Also, it was perceived as odd and 
ugly that some of the icons on the shelves were cut in half. In 
contrast, 30% of the subjects liked the tighter view that the 
Pie concept offered even though there was even less content 
in sight. Pie and Keyring were perceived to look like 
launchers for applications. Participants thought that in the 
Room (18%) and Keyring (25%) GUIs, there were too many 
occluding application icons. It was perceived to be unclear 
and error prone while making selections.  
Participants thought that all GUIs except the Room, 
looked weird and distressing with the virtual environment 
background, because they seemed to be floating in the air, 
for example, the Pie GUI was perceived as a UFO. Also, one 
participant commented the meaning of the Pie metaphor 
because of its location in the 3D environment: "It looks like a 
tray when it is located near a bar".   
B. Perceived 3Dness 
When participants evaluated the 3Dness of the concepts, one 
factor was the depth of the space. Compared to other 
concepts, in the Shelves GUI, there was not enough depth to 
make it look like a 3D and it was considered to be only a 2D 
GUI with 3D icons. As one participant commented about it: 
"3D icons do not change the UI into 3D". Another factor was 
the perceived interaction. The Pie and Keyring had the round 
shape which made them look rotatable; therefore, they were 
perceived as 3D. Also the icon occlusion was considered to 
be an important factor for creating a 3D feeling; thus, the 
Shelves concept was not considered to be a 3D GUI. From 
the users' perspectives, 3Dness is made from occlusion, the 
shape of the UI and the depth of the space.  
C. Perceived Consumption of Space from VE 
The occlusion of the virtual environment by the GUI was 
evaluated by the participants. The Room and Pie were 
perceived to consume too much space from the VE. The 
Room GUI was showing the center area, but it was 
considered more like a little peak view to the VE. With the 
Pie GUI, the situation was quite the opposite; the plate of the 
Pie blocked the center area. In comparison, the Shelves and 
Keyring GUIs were considered to be lighter and airy on VE. 
D. Perceived Privacy and Safety 
The participants felt more secure with the Room concept, 
because there were walls separating the private area from the 
public background area. To create a secure feeling, there 
should be some kind of separation from the background 
environment. However, with the Shelves, Pie and Keyring 
GUIs, participants had concerns for their privacy. For 
example, one participant commented on the Pie GUI: "If I 
am in a public virtual space, can other people see my UI?" 
The Shelves and Keyring GUIs were perceived as visually 
unclear and confusing, because behind the icons and UI 
elements there were not any visual elements to separate it 
from the VE. With the Shelves GUI, participants wished for 
a back plate or curtain behind the shelves.  
  There should also be a clear visual indication for 
showing the user's active position between the personal 3D 
GUI and collaborative virtual environment, which could be 
indicated with color or dimming. Participants thought that a 
possibility to interact between spaces and share content 
directly to a friend in the VE was good. On the other hand,

they were concerned about a possibility to share something 
into the VE by accident. This could be prevented by giving a 
user visual indication with a highlight color when something 
is moved from their personal GUI to the collaborative VE. 
There were also concerns such as, 'can someone else see a 
shared file and to whom it is shared to'. The shared content 
should be invisible to other users and it should look like it is 
protected for the user who is sharing it and who is receiving 
it. For example, as one participant suggested: "Shared file 
could be protected with a folder?" 
E. Perceived Easy of Use 
Even though we did not have a functional prototype, 
participants commented a lot how they perceived the 
usability aspects of each GUI metaphors with the 'file 
searching and sharing' use case. Participants thought that the 
Shelves GUI (Fig. 1, c) was better than other GUIs from the 
usability point of view. It was perceived to have shorter 
dragging, simpler hierarchy, fewer steps and camera 
movements, such as view rotation and zooming in too near to 
the UI elements. Also, one person said that in the Shelves 
GUI the interaction can be done more "brainlessly". 
Even though a tablet is a gestural interface, participants 
did not like long dragging, because it was perceived difficult 
and prone to errors, such as an item is dragged to a wrong 
place. 15% of the participants suggested that instead of long 
dragging, a copy could be moved to a 'pocket' or virtual 
USB-memory stick and kept there until sharing. 15% of the 
participants suggested that the GUI could be intelligent, for 
example, the target object (in this case a contact), could 
automatically open beside of the binder while copying.  
 With the Pie and Keyring metaphor concepts (Fig. 1, C), 
the 2nd and 3rd hierarchy levels were found distressing, 
because there were too many items illustrated at the same 
time and it looked too messy. When the 3rd hierarchy level 
opened in the Keyring GUI, 30% of the given comments 
were negative. As one participant commented: "More and 
more jingling". Also the orientations of the sub-rings was 
found irritating, against the laws of physics and foolish. 
Therefore, it was suggested that rings could open 
horizontally either under the original ring, replacing it or 
earlier opened rings could move deeper into the space when 
the new ring opens. With the Pie GUI, the 3rd hierarchy 
level opening as a form of helical stairs was unexpected by 
the participants and over 50% of the given comments were 
negative For example, one participant described it: "It 
exploded, went broken". It was perceived as difficult, hard, 
complex and distressing. 13% of the participants commented 
that it looks like endless stairs. The helical stairs structure 
was perceived to prioritize the content. For example, with 
contacts, it creates a feeling that some of the contacts are 
more important than others. With PDF files, the structure 
was not that irritating, but the amount of items was 
considered to be critical for the controllability of the GUI. 
Participants suggested that instead of the 2nd and 3rd 
hierarchy levels in the Pie and Keyring GUIs, there could be 
a similar binder metaphor as in the Room and Shelves. Other 
suggestions for the Pie included: a drawer opening from it or 
another Pie could open under the first one. With the Keyring, 
there could be a binder metaphor or file cabinet instead of 
the 2nd and 3rd hierarchy levels.  
F. Perceived Utility by Customization 
Users thought that customization would be interesting 
and useful within all of the GUIS. The simplest thing with 
the UI customization is to let the users to adjust the amount 
of icons. Also, some people liked to categorize the GUI 
content. For example, with the Keyring, participants wanted 
to categorize icons in groups or pile them in stacks. With the 
Room and Shelves GUIs, participants would have liked to 
organize their icons by placing work and leisure items on 
different sides of the room or on different shelves. Also 30% 
of the participants were interested in decorating the Room 
GUI space, for example, with wallpapers.  
II. 
DISCUSSION 
Our study indicated that the participants would like to use 
their personal 3D GUI in a collaborative virtual environment, 
but they must know what others can see from their private or 
shared 3D UI components. Therefore, the visual design of 
the GUI is important for creating a secure and private look 
for the 3D GUI. It can be designed with visual elements, 
such as walls or curtains, which will distinguish the GUI and 
its elements from the background environment. However, 
these elements should not excessively occlude the virtual 
environment; therefore, they could be also translucent.  
There should also be a clear visual indication for showing 
the user's active position between the personal 3D GUI and 
collaborative virtual environment, which could be indicated 
with color or dimming.  Also, when something is transferred 
from the personal GUI to the public virtual environment, 
there should be a visual indication for the user, for example, 
a highlight color. Virtual environment also affects how 
participants perceive the visual design of the 3D GUI. 
Participants thought that all GUIs except the Room looked 
weird and distressing with the VE background, because they 
seem to be floating in the air and were unclear looking.  
From the users' perspectives, 3Dness in 3D GUI is made 
from icon occlusion, the shape of the UI and the depth of the 
UI space. The shape of the GUI and amount of the icons 
depends on the user's personal preferences. One user wishes 
to see all of the applications at one glance and another one 
would just want to see only the most important applications 
in their GUI. Therefore, there should be different kinds of 
GUI designs available to the participants. Also the hierarchy 
structure does not have to continue similarly through the 
hierarchy levels; it is more preferable is to use flat hierarchy 
on touch screen devices. Users need to have a possibility to 
organize icons, UI elements and decorate the GUI space as 
they wish. Therefore, the customization of the GUI is 
important for the users.  
Even thought this evaluation had limitations from the 
interaction point of view, it nevertheless provided useful 
information to us for the next iteration of the relevant 
concepts. It is not possible to evaluate touch screen 
interaction with a non-operational prototype, but it is 
possible to show the designed interaction ways and discuss 
about them with participants. Therefore, we can now give

these early design phase user perceptions to designers and 
developers to make more pleasurable VEs in the future.   
III. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we focused on a possibility to have a 
personal 3D GUI inside a VE on tablet device. Therefore, we 
did the visual design process of 3D GUIs with 'file searching 
and sharing' use cases. Then, we had an early design phase 
UX evaluation of four 3D GUIs in a virtual environment 
background with 40 participants. This evaluation with non-
functional visually high quality prototypes gave us a lot of 
user feedback for the design. Participants liked a possibility 
to have their personal 3D GUI in a virtual environment. 
However, the visual design of the 3D GUI should create a 
secure and private feeling for them. The secure feeling can 
be designed with visual elements, such as walls or curtains, 
which will distinguish the GUI and its elements from the 
background VE. However, the GUI should not occlude too 
much with the background VE. There should be visual 
indication presented when a user transfers items from the 
personal GUI to the virtual environment and also for 
showing the user's active position between the GUI and VE. 
We pointed out also other design issues relating to the visual 
design of the personal GUI for interaction and visual 
designers of 3D GUIs and virtual environments. 
In the future studies, we need to design and implement a 
functional prototype to test interactions as well. Especially 
we need more information about the dragging action length 
and camera movements.
