Abstract—The Taipei Metro is still very young compared to the 
other metropolitan metro systems in the world.  The data 
provided by Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation (TRTC) is 
analyzed, including: air conditioner, communication system, 
switcher, platform door, 22kV switchboard, Automated fare 
collection (AFC) door, Wenhu Line traffic control computer, 
Transmission system, elevator and escalator.  The research 
objective is to assess the performance based on the one-year-
long data from TRTC, to determine the equipment stage of its 
lifetime, and estimate the asset’s remaining life and 
maintenance condition.  Reported analysis of the data shows 
minute indication of the system current status; further analysis 
is in progress.

 INTRODUCTION 
We analyze the maintenance record of the Taipei Mass 
Rapid Transit (MRT) system, which is a well maintained 
system renown worldwide for its tidiness, stability and 
efficiency.  If the maintenance data can be analyzed to yield 
information about how to perfect the performance of the 
Taipei MRT system, the analysis can provide useful 
information to improving Taipei MRT, or, more generally, to 
assess the performance of other systems.   
Since the MRT system of Taipei Rapid Transit 
Corporation (TRTC) is relatively young (began operation on 
March 28, 1996, a total of 22 years to date [1]), most of the 
equipment has not yet been replaced; the records of repair and 
maintenance are detailed and are stored in digital form.  Thus, 
our research goal is to establish a degradation curve based on 
the maintenance and performance record, and use to assess the 
Taipei MRT system, and equipment of other metro systems. 
The performance and degradation of metropolitan metro 
systems have been the focus of general public.  Various 
studies have been reported, including technical issues of the 
MRT.  Rail track condition monitoring is an important 
technical concern of the MRT system [2].  However, it is 
infeasible to constantly inspect track conditions; an 
inspection once a month or less is more or less the usual 
maintenance.  Severe track condition degradation that isn’t 
detected early is a potential threat to the railway system.  
Hence, more attention has been devoted to monitoring track 
condition via in-service vehicles [3-5].  The general goal of 
the research and technical modifications is to improve the 
performance and reliability of a mass rapid transit system.   
We also looked into some older subway systems on the 
Internet.  As reported in [6], train R36 serviced from 1964 to 
2003, a total of 39 years.  R160s were used to replace 45-year-
old trains.  In another news report about the old trains [7], the 
oldest trains for New York City Subway were planned to serve 
for 58 years, and now this type of trains are actually found too 
old with very high failure rate and not appealing to meet 
passengers.  From the limited reference that we can access, an 
estimate of the subway train lifetime is estimated to be around 
40 to 50 years.  For example, some lines of Singapore Mass 
Rapid Transit (SMRT) have been operating since 1987, 30 
years from today.  On the other hand, TRTC operated from 
1996, which is only 21 years ago.  There is a difference of 9 
years.  The assets’ actual wear-out period may lie somewhere 
between 20 years (the oldest TRTC asset), and 40 years (New 
York City Subway).  All these metropolitan metro systems are 
different in various aspects, thus, the characteristics of these 
MRT systems are expected to differ; the predictability and 
accuracy of the estimation and extrapolation based on TRTC 
to assess other MRT systems using the TRTC system data is 
understandably incomplete; with unknown number of 
variables involved, the accuracy of assessment may be very 
limited. 
Assessment and quantification of the system current 
status is essential to enhance performance.  The degradation 
curve is commonly employed for estimation of the system 
current status.  Analysis of the reliability is commonly based 
on failure rate and maintenance records [8].  Based on the 
status of the system, possible improvement of the 
maintenance and performance can be assessed.  By means of 
the degradation analysis the research objective is to shed light 
on enhancing the metro system performance.   
To 
study 
the 
maintenance 
and 
performance 
characteristics, various approaches have been reported [9-18], 
including the popular bathtub curve analysis [19]-[24].  The 
Bathtub 
curve 
is 
commonly 
employed 
for 
system 
performance analysis [25].  Analysis based upon the bathtub 
curve has been extensively applied to various problems; 
various modifications to improve applicability have been 
reported [11][26]-[29].  It is suggested that bathtub curve

could be interfered by human factor [30]; for example, if the 
asset retired in its early stage, the curve may not rise up during 
the wear-out period and may even descend.  If properly 
maintained, the curve may not rise in the wear-out period, 
similar to the situation in airline industry.  However, few MRT 
systems in reality exhibit degradation behavior similar to the 
bathtub curve model [31].   
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the goal of this research project. Section III 
describes the research method.  Section IV summarizes the 
data analysis; finally, a summary is presented in Section V, 
followed by an acknowledgement. 
 
 
II. 
RESEARCH GOAL 
We proposed to thoroughly analyze the Taipei MRT data.  
We have data from Taipei MRT consisting of 11 systems: 
electric multiple unit (EMU), EMU air conditioner, EMU 
communication, switcher, platform door, 22kV switchboard, 
Automated fare collection (AFC) door, Wenhu Line traffic 
control computer, Transmission system, elevator, and 
escalator.  By analyzing the dataset with various state-of-the-
art approaches, such as deep learning, the research objective 
is to analyze the equipment present status and identify 
possible tendencies or features that may be indicative of the 
system performance. 
III. 
METHOD 
Ideally, analysis of the maintenance data would yield a 
simple bathtub-shaped degradation curve for each equipment.  
However, the bathtub-shaped degradation curve is a 
theoretical model; degradation curve of most cases do not 
follow the same degradation curve, not to mention each 
equipment may exhibit different characteristics.  Furthermore, 
each equipment in the Taipei metro system consists of various 
brands and various models that may possess different intrinsic 
characteristics.  Furthermore, since each equipment is 
maintained by human, the degradation curve is unlikely to be 
a simple universal bathtub-shaped curve.  Thus, it is infeasible 
to come up with a universal bathtub-shaped degradation curve 
for each Taipei MRT equipment.  Based on the experience we 
had from the initial attempt to analyze the data, we propose 
the following steps:   
First, based upon the original maintenance records, 
calculate the duration between: 1) when the equipment was 
first engaged in operation, and, 2) the failure date. This time 
interval represents the duration of malfunction-free operation, 
which is also the time for a malfunction to take place.  By 
analyzing the malfunction-free duration instead of the number 
of malfunctions each month may yield more realistic 
relationship.   
Second, calculate the failure times per month to acquire 
the failure rate for each individual equipment.  (For the 
equipment related to EMU, the failure rate is acquired by the 
failure time divided by the train mileage.) 
 
 
 
 
 
Third, average each equipment’s failure times to get the 
average failure rate.  Use a statistical software to calculate the 
regression curve, and extrapolate for comparison with other 
metro system performance data. 
Continue these steps to process another set of data 
accordingly; then compare the regression behavior.  Analyze 
the difference between the two datasets. 
 
IV. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
Initial attempt of analysis is performed.  We use the failure 
statistics for monthly failure rate provided by TRTC.  The 
AFC gates statistics is shown in Figure 1; the averaged 
malfunction rate is calculated and shown in Figure 2.  As 
shown in Figure 1, the equipment consists of mixed brand, 
model, age; thus, the total number of malfunctions is not 
representative of individual equipment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based upon the trend of the data, the failure rate has been 
declining yearly until it reaches low and stable end tail.  
Possible factors are speculated, this mostly likely is due to the 
improvement of MRT maintenance.  On the other hand, since 
the age of each equipment and the number of samples for each 
equipment are not consistent, the total failure rate is not a fair 
representation of a specific individual equipment.  Thus, we 
target to analyze the age’s effect of the individual equipment 
as far as possible.

With sufficient data for escalators and elevators, we try to 
quantify the failure rate vs. the age for each individual 
equipment with correlation analysis.  On the other hand, for 
some equipment that seem to have no variation among one 
another, e.g., EMU, platform door, switcher and 22kV 
switchboard, we propose to calculate the failure rate vs. 
failure date.  As shown in Figure 2., for the Wenhu line 
Central control computers, AFC gates and Transmission 
system, due to lack of sufficient data, the failure rate vs. 
failure date is analyzed.  The malfunction rate decreases then 
later increases, exhibiting behavior similar to a bathtub curve.  
The spikes at the center is likely due to lack of sufficient data 
points to reveal detail trend.   
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The data provided by TRTC contains no more than 
malfunctions each month; furthermore, there is no severity 
information of the malfunction event.  For a complex system, 
such as MRT, which involves enormous number of factors 
including human, there are all kinds of characteristics 
exhibited by the system in complex ways.  Thus, it is 
infeasible to determine the system status with just a single 
variable.  Nevertheless, undoubtedly a rich amount of 
information is contained in the maintenance data.  We believe 
the data contains rich information and can be further 
harnessed, possibly with big data analysis, to yield more 
information that may be essential to enhance the MRT 
performance.
