Abstract—The adaptiveness of Field Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs) is a key aspect in many mobile applications. Modern
vehicles contain up to 100 ”Electronic Control Units” (ECUs)
in order to implement all necessary functions for autonomous
driving. Due to the limited power resources of mobile applications,
an appropriate implementation of power reduction measures is
crucial for achieving an acceptable amount of power savings.
Commercial Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools support
the designers to implement low-power circuits on architectural
level. However, effective power reduction mechanisms have to be
applied to the backbone of each FPGA: the look-up table (LUT).
In this paper, we describe the implementation and comparison of
various LUTs based on different Static Random Access Memory
(SRAM) cells. All SRAM cells have been analyzed in order to
evaluate feasible modiﬁcations for the sake of lowering leakage
currents and modiﬁed in order to minimize static and dynamic
power consumption. Followed by a comparison of different LUT
implementations based on the optimized SRAM cell designs, we
derive further optimization approaches to achieve effective power
savings for the usage in environments like vehicles, smartphones,
etc. with limited power.
Keywords–FPGA; LUT architecture; SRAM cell optimization;

INTRODUCTION
During the last years, the number of classic desktop com-
puters used in domestic homes has constantly decreased. The
reason behind this phenomenon is the rising number of mobile
devices such as smartphones and tablets, taking over most
of the functionalities provided by desktop computers before.
Furthermore, upcoming features like highly automated driving
cars or fully autonomous vehicles require a high demand
for computing power. Whilst the computing performance of
mobile devices is improved constantly to face the challenges of
complex applications like video processing for adaptive cruise
control on long distance highway drives, the capacities of
batteries providing the needed energy resources have not been
extended in the same way. A modern, upper-class vehicle con-
tains more than 70 ECUs to provide all features desired by con-
sumers these days [1]. On-board communication networks like
Controller Area Network (CAN), FlexRay and ethernet ensure
the communication between these devices, but also introduce a
remarkable amount of additional weight of approximately up to
30% (depending on the used technology). In order to counter
the limits set by power consumption and overall weight, a
signiﬁcant reduction of the ECU number would be an efﬁcient
approach. This could lead to the application of more powerful
processors, taking over many of the functionalities from the
large number of slower ECUs used before. The downside
of this approach would be a higher power consumption due
to higher clock frequencies. A more comprehensive approach
focuses on the massive usage of FPGAs in mobile applications.
FPGAs offer various advantages compared to processors and
Application Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Being fully
conﬁgurable, FPGAs are well-suited for the execution of
various functions which have been spread over several ECUs
before, either purely by hardware implementations or soft-
ware execution running on a softcore processor implemented
on the FPGA’s fabric. However, FPGAs don’t offer similar
power saving mechanisms implemented on microprocessors
and lack of of a substantial power management system. Power
consumption saving mechanisms shall be applied to series
production passenger cars, which is a cost-sensitive market,
hence we choose the Xilinx Spartan-3 low-cost FPGA as a
baseline architecture for all further considerations [2]. FPGAs
play a major role for the realization of adaptive systems.
Partial, dynamic reconﬁguration [3], supported by various
FPGA designs, offer a vast potential for fast adaption of the
implemented functional range within a vehicle, e.g., realizing a
requested function by the driver and disengaging a previously
implemented vehicle function which is not required any more
[4].
In this paper, we evaluate selected SRAM cell designs on
their suitability for a low-leakage LUT implementation, which
are the elementar computational elements. Since the overhead
of reconﬁgurability leads to unused parts within the FPGA,
both static and dynamic power consumption are analyzed
for each cell design. In Section II, we give an overview
about a selection of existing designs and our motivation for
improvements. In Section III, we describe a number of leakage
reduction techniques and evaluate the feasible adaption on
current designs. In Section IV, we investigate the SRAM
cell designs on their assets and drawbacks and compare the
simulation results. In Section V circuit improvement methods
for standby and active currents reduction are introduced. All
investigated SRAM cells are enhanced with these additional
improvements and compared again. In Section VI, we use each
modiﬁed SRAM cell to implement a 4-input LUT reference
design and explore the power consumption during the idle and
active state. The advantages of reasonable SRAM cell design
modiﬁcations are presented based upon the simulation results.
In Section VII, all previous discussions are summarized and
concluded.

RELATED WORK
Various SRAM cell designs have been under research over
the years. Compared to dynamic RAM (DRAM), which is
widely used as main memory in many applications, SRAM
offers numerous advantages like quick read & write-cycles,
cell stability, data retention without refresh cycles, differential
outputs and many more. During the pre-Complementary Metal-
Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) era, the 4T cell [5] was com-
1

monly used for cache memories. Considering the additional
effort in terms of process variations for implementing the
resistor load and weaker signal to noise (SNM) margin, this
cell type was replaced by the 6T cell [6]. This design depicts
the mostly used approach for combining reliable functionality
with a proven in use fabrication process due to its CMOS
structure. Being the starting point for benchmarking, cell
variations like the 5T SRAM [5] design were developed to
eliminate the parasitic capacitance penalties of two bitlines.
Further derivations like the 7T cell implementation [7] inherit
the characteristics of the reference 6T design and provide
power savings by exploiting an effective writing mechanism,
putting no further requirements on adaptions to auxiliary
circuitry. Features like soft error rate robustness during low-
power operation have been explored in a 10T design varia-
tion [8]. All of these cell types have been designed during
research without applying additional, commonly used power
reduction measures. LUT designs have been evaluated and
improved on architectural level [9] for power reduction by
power gating mechanisms. New FPGA designs were presented
and compared to commercial products, by adding structural
improvements [10].
Our approach goes one step further and is based on circuit
level improvements to a LUT by reasonable selection of a
suitable SRAM cell design and substantial modiﬁcation of the
cell circuitry to achieve better leakage reduction and power
savings. The improvements achieved on that level are essential
for important leakage current suppression and are an inevitable
step to be combined with architectural amendments.

LEAKAGE REDUCTION
Three major components of leakage currents can be iden-
tiﬁed for a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) transistor of
gate lengths in nanometer scales:
•
Subthreshold leakage
•
Direct tunneling gate leakageshown in
•
Reverse biased p-n BTBT leakage
Whilst the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) leakage cur-
rents can be neglected for devices exceeding 50nm gate
lengths, subthreshold and direct tunneling gate leakage currents
come into consideration for our design. Tunneling electrons
through gates oxides can be countermeasured by carefully
setting an adequate oxide thickness of each transistor. This
dependency can be seen in (1):
JDT ∝A(Vox
Tox
)2
(1)
where
A = µoCox
W
Leff
(kT
q )2e1.8
By increasing the oxide thickness Tox, the direct tunneling
current density JDT can be efﬁciently lowered to a minimum
stage [11]. Increasing the gate length Leff would have a
similar effect, but lead to higher effort in the manufacturing
process due to a change in one of the basic technology
parameters like the gate length of a transistor. Therefore,
this option should be avoided. However, the usage of multi-
oxide thicknesses is a technology dependent parameter and
requires awareness for the selection of a suitable multi-oxide
technology.
Subthreshold currents can be expressed by the following
equation:
Isub∝ W
Leff
e(VGS−Vt0−γVSB+ηVDS)/nVt)(1−e
− VDS
Vt
)
(2)
Equation (2) shows the parameters which contribute to the
overall weak-inversion current, ﬂowing below the threshold
voltage Vth of each MOS transistor in the circuit. Several
leakage reduction measures can be applied by utilizing these
parameters to design a low leakage circuit:
•
W: setting the width of a transistor as small as
possible leads to a higher resistance of it and therefore
to smaller leakage currents
•
Vgs: Gate biasing is done by applying a Vgs voltage
lower than Gnd, which turns the transistor deeply off
•
Vsb: Body biasing by tweaking the body voltage of a
turned off transistor
•
Vdd: Lowering the supply voltage mitigates or even
completely removes the DIBL (drain-induced barrier
lowering) effect, represented by η in (2)
In general, we can distinguish between two classes of
leakage reduction techniques [12]. Some can be applied during
the design, whereas others can be used during operation time of
the circuit. A reasonable extract of these techniques is shown
in Table I:
TABLE I. LEAKAGE REDUCTION TECHNIQUES
Design leakage reduction
Static leakage reduction
Active leakage reduction
Dual-Vth
Stacking
DVS
Multi-Vdd
Sleep mode
VTCMOS
DVTS
Energy efﬁcient circuits should feature multiple supply
voltages and at least a dual threshold approach. As shown
in Table I, these characteristics need to be added during
the development phase. Furthermore, additional techniques
working during operation of the circuit can help to con-
tinuously reduce the overall power consumption. Dynamic
(threshold) voltage scaling (DVS & DVTS), as well as variable
threshold CMOS (VTCMOS) circuitry are powerful methods
to overcome the side-effects like subthreshold leakage due to
progressive scaling to smaller technology nodes.
We analyze the techniques listed in Table I on their careful
combination and application to volatile (SRAM) memory cells
and therefore automatically to LUTs.
IV.
SRAM CELL DESIGNS
The backbone of each computational activity within an
FPGA is the LUT [13]. Depending on the number of the LUT’s
inputs, a LUT can contain numerous SRAM cells. For exam-
ple, in case of a 4-input LUT, 16 SRAM cells are necessary
for the realization of all possible input value combinations.
Since the memory cells are used for conﬁguration, they are also
called conﬁguration RAM (CRAM). Once conﬁgured during
the start-up phase, the content of these memory cells won’t be

changed until the next reconﬁguration cycle. In consequence,
the static leakage current reduction is of higher signiﬁcance
for the overall power consumption.
The selection of a low-power SRAM cell design is crucial
for an appropriate energy-efﬁcient implementation of inte-
grated circuits. Many memory cell designs have been intro-
duced in the past. The common 6 transistor cell can be found
in most FPGAs nowadays [14]. In principle, this memory
cell consists of two cross-coupled inverter and two access
transistors, connecting the inverters to the bitlines, as shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1. 6T SRAM cell
As long as M5 and M6 are in cut-off mode, the cross-
coupled inverters are isolated from the bitlines and store the
complementary data value at the output nodes of each inverter.
Data retention is ensured as long as a sufﬁcient supply voltage
Vdd is applied. Before reading the stored data, both bitlines
BL and BL are precharged to Vdd by a special precharge
circuit and the access transistors M5 and M6 are turned on.
One of the bitlines will be discharged to Gnd, whereas the
other bitline will remain on Vdd. The voltage drop between
BL and BL will be sensed and evaluated by a sense ampliﬁer.
For writing data into the cell, one of the bitlines is kept at
Vdd, whereas the other bitline is kept at Gnd. By turning the
access transistors on, the desired value is written. For this
purpose, a suitable bitline driver circuit is needed to ensure
the propoer execution of the writing cycle. Careful transistor
sizing is required for avoiding the cell to ﬂip during, e.g., a
read cycle. This cell design is well-elaborated and used for
years in integrated circuits. Its stability and reliability is well-
known and therefore used in various applications. However,
the power consumption of the 6T SRAM cell can be further
optimized by some modiﬁcations resulting in the SRAM cells
described in the following paragraphs:
1) 4T SRAM cell: A typical implementation of a four
transistor SRAM cell is shown in Figure 2. In comparison
to the 6T cell, a smaller are of approximately 30% can be
achieved [15]. Due to the replacement of all pMOS transistors
by polysilicon resistors, only nMOS transistors are used for the
pure functionality of this cell. Despite of the space-savings,
which could lead to a higher yield after the manufacturing
process, the realization of high-resistivity polysilicon resistor
adds additional technological steps to the manufacturing pro-
cess, resulting in higher costs.
The 4T (polysilicon) SRAM is a predecessor of all CMOS-
based SRAM cells. Lower stability, lower tolerance against

soft-errors and a more technically demanding manufacturing
process exclude this cell type from further considerations [5].
2) 5T SRAM cell: The circuitry of a ﬁve transistor SRAM
cell is shown in Figure 3. The advantage of this cell design
compared to the 6T reference cell is the availability of just
one access transistor M5 and therefore only one bitline BL
[16]. The connecting bitlines in each slice of an FPGA add
undesired parasitic capacitances, which underly the process of
charging and discharging during each read- and write-cycle
and lead subsequently to higher power consumption. A cell
design working with just one access transistor adds space-
savings. For a proper and stable functionality of this cell,
asymmetric transistor sizing is required, which may complicate
the manufacturing process and to modiﬁcations of auxiliary
circuitry like sense ampliﬁers, precharge circuits, etc..

3) 7T SRAM cell: The seven transistor SRAM cell is shown
in Figure 4, which enhances the 6T reference cell design by
an additional feedback transistor M7 and 2 signal lines R and
W. The idea behind this design is a write mechanism, which
depends only on one of the two bitlines in order to execute a
write operation. This can be also expressed in equation 3 [11].
While the activity factor α equals 1 in conventional mem-
ory cells, the 7T SRAM cell reduces this factor to less than 0.5
by exploiting the fact, that most of the bits in memories and
caches are zeros [7]. The main asset of this implementation is
the reduction of the switching activity and therefore a reduction
of charging and discharging cycles of parasitic capacitances.
The drawback is the required additional control logic and

SRAM CELL DESIGN MODIFICATIONS
The simulation results showed that the choice of a suitable
SRAM cell design leads to a signiﬁcant impact on power
consumption of a LUT. In this section we present further
improvements on each cell design in order to achieve even
better power savings in this essential component. Since Xilinx’
Spartan 3(A) is manufactured in a 90nm process and has a
recommended internal supply voltage of 1.2V , we choose a
90nm TSMC technology library at an comparable operating
voltage of 1.2V .
Coming back to the proposed cell designs in Section IV,
we refer to the 4T SRAM cell since its compact design is of
interest for further considerations and performance comparison
to other design. The major drawback of the 4T SRAM cell is
the high-resistive polysilicon resistor, which should be replaced
or completely omitted in an improved cell. A possibility how
to bypass this drawback is shown in Figure 5.

The previous pull-down network (PDN) consisting of two
nMOS transistors is replaced by a pull-up network of two
pMOS M1 and M2 transistors [17]. In combination with both
nMOS access transistors M3 and M4 a stable and power
saving functionality is achieved. Instead of precharging both
bitlines to Vdd as a pre-step of the reading-phase, the bitlines
are ”precharged” to Gnd, due to the fact, that pMOS transistor
are used as drivers in this cell. This saves power and ensures
compatibility with CMOS logic processes. Nevertheless, minor
adaptions to the auxiliary circuitry around the cell have to be
done, e.g., modifying the bitline drivers.
A. Test results
All SRAM cells have been designed and simulated by
usage of the Cadence toolchain and a 90nm technology pro-
vided by TSMC at an ambient temperature of 27◦C. The main
challenge to achieve comparable results was to develop suitable
bitline drivers, precharge circuitry and a sense amplﬁer. Careful
design of the bitline drivers is crucial for avoiding the cell
to ﬂip during a read cycle. All simulations are performed
with a clock frequency of 200MHz and a load of 600aF.
Conﬁguration memory cells used in a LUT are not supposed
to be written and read at high frequencies, like e.g., memory
arrays in a microprocessor’s cache (up to 4GHz). Therefore, we
choose a lower frequency, nevertheless all cells have also been
successfully tested with a higher clock frequency of 500MHz.
For the ﬁrst step, the determination of the best SRAM cell
design in terms of power consumption without any further
improvements, is done. The simulation results of the 6T cell
design are shown in Figure 6:

Compared to the other designs, Table II shows clearly
the drawbacks of the reference 6T SRAM cell. Substantial
power savings can be achieved by the choice of alternative
cell design. For example, the average power consumption of
the 6T SRAM reference cell design is 927nW and about 3
times higher than the average power consumption of the 4T
loadless SRAM cell, which is only 334.5nW. That results in
power savings of approximately 65%.

B. Dual Threshold CMOS
Further optimizations can be achieved by the introduction
of high threshold voltage (Vth) transistors. High Vth transistors
require a higher VGS voltage at the gate in order to turn the
transistor on, which can lead to an increase of the propagation
delay within a signal path. Therefore, high Vth should be only
used in applications which are not timing-critical. However,
the SRAM cells in a LUT are used as conﬁguration RAM
(CRAM) and are pertinent for use with high threshold voltage
transistors. All cell designs have been modiﬁed and the simula-
tions were performed again. These modiﬁcations are limited to
the core cell only, the precharge circuitry, the sense ampliﬁer
and the bitline drivers have not been modiﬁed. The results are
summed up in Table III.

In comparison to the reference design of the 6T SRAM
cell, the introduction of the high Vth transistors adds power
savings of about 25%. The performance of the high Vth 4T
loadless SRAM cell is slightly improved and leads to energy
savings of approximately 10nW.
C. Transistor Stacking
Transistor stacking, shown in Figure 7, which is also
known as self-reverse biasing, is a strong technique to reduce
subthreshold leakage current by raising the voltage at the
source terminal of each transistor. By constantly increasing
the source voltage VS and keeping the gate voltage VG at the
same level, VGS becomes negative at a certain point of time,
which leads the transistor into super cut-off mode and turns it
deeply off. Subthreshold currents are exponentially reduced.

At the same time, the body to source potential VSB
also becomes negative, since the body terminal of a nMOS
transistor is usually kept at Gnd. In consequence, the body
effect is intensiﬁed, thus Vth is tuned by that effect to a
higher level. This fact can be further exploited by continuing
stacking transistors in series, but the effect of subthreshold
current reduction becomes diminished with a rising number of
transistors.This technique implies a trade-off between power
savings and size ratio of the chip. Despite the gradual tech-
nology shrink up to 16nm FinFET, on-chip space is not an
unlimited resource and should be used carefully. Therefore, we
choose to add two stacking transistors only in order to have
a reasonable compromise between leakage current reduction
and size-ratio of the cells. The simulation results are shown in
Table IV and Table V.

If the used manufacturing process doesn’t support dual-
threshold CMOS technology, Table IV shows that a noteworthy
reduction of leakage currents within the 4T SRAM cell is
achieved by approximately 90%. Even the standard 6T SRAM
cell features important amendments in terms of power savings
(≈ 12%) and leakage currents.

The combination of both techniques, dual-threshold CMOS
and transistor stacking, puts additional improvements to the
overall power savings parameters. Since most of the currently
available technologies feature dual-threshold CMOS, the fea-
sibility of this combination is high.
D. Dynamic Voltage Scaling
The higher the supply voltage is, the faster the operation
of the integrated circuit will be, since high Vdd allows fast
charging and discharging of parasitic capacitances. In case of
low demand on performance such as for CRAMs, the supply
voltage can be lowered while still ensuring data retention
within the cell. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) depends
usually at least on an operating system and a regulation loop
to recognize the circuit speed and to cover a wide range of
operating voltages. Our approach simpliﬁes this principle by
introducing two additional transistors, shown in Figure 8.
Both transistors M9 and M10 are used to connect the
SRAM cell to two different supply voltages, Vdd and VddL,
whereas Vdd equals the primary 1.2V. On the one hand, the
prerequisite of this method is a dual-Vdd setup, representing
a simple alternative to the mentioned operating system driven
regulation loop, and on the other hand a modiﬁed power gating
approach is implemented. Since the 4T SRAM cell has no
connection to Gnd in its core, power gating is achieved by
the possibility to fully cut-off the supply voltage, if needed.
However, power gating should be introduced at a coarse-grain
level, e.g., by powering or switching off groups of cells at
a higher abstraction layer. By lowering the supply voltage

In order to achieve an average power consumption of
232.9nW at a clock requency of 200MHz and full data re-
tention like shown in Table VI, we combined all three power
saving methods introduced in the chapters before with careful
transistor sizing of an efﬁcient memory cell design. We present
the modiﬁed, loadless 4T SRAM cell in Figure 9.
The simulation was done by injecting a 1 → 0 → 1
sequence and one read cycle at the end of the simulation time,
which can be seen in Figure 10. By comparing the results
of Figure 10 with the outputs shown in Figure 6, we see a
reduction in both, power and current spikes. Looking back
on the continuous improvements added to each cell type, we
see the beneﬁts in reduction of average power consumption in
Figure 11.

LUT SIMULATIONS
The LUT was implemented with each cell type investigated
in the previous chapters. In order to achieve an equal distribu-
tion of bits, all memory cells have alternating bits stored and
are not connected to the bitlines by switching off all access
transistors. As a matter of lucidity, we present a comparison
between the 6T SRAM- and 4T SRAM LUT implementa-
tion. As expected, the 4T SRAM cell design shows a better
performance in terms of power savings and leakage current
reduction than the 6T SRAM cell design does. By comparing
a LUT implementation with a standard 6T SRAM cell and our
modiﬁed 4T SRAM design, Table VII summarizes the results
and highlights the improvements in power dissipation, which

It should be mentioned that either the precharge circuit nor
the sense ampliﬁer have been optimized for power efﬁciency.
Optimizing these parts will lead to even better results and
raise the duration of a battery charge, independent of the
target application. Further optimization can be achieved by
coarse-grain power gating of CRAM blocks within the LUT
architecture. Unused CRAMs should be completely powered
off by adding additional, thick-oxide transistors, cutting off the
cell from Vdd and Gnd.
The modiﬁed 4T memory cell design introduced in Figure
9 is superior in terms of low power aspects compared to all
other investigated cell designs. However, this solution requires

CONCLUSION
We analyzed a typical LUT structure of an FPGA in terms
of power dissipation and leakage current. Our approach was to
integrate power savings mechanisms at the basic circuit level
before heading for further optimizations on architectural level.
Different SRAM cell structures have been investigated on their
power characteristics in order to evaluate the best design for
implementing a LUT, which features inherent low-power char-
acteristics. Simulations have shown that the 4T loadless SRAM
cell features the required properties. We applied various low-
power techniques and enhanced this cell for standby leakage
current mitigation. Hence, we presented a modiﬁed 4T loadless
SRAM cell design. By combining dedicated techniques during
design time and during operating time, we achieved a reduction
of the average power consumption within the LUT of 16% dur-
ing simulation time. Subsequently, this leads to overall energy
savings of 127aJ compared to the origin 150aJ of a 6T SRAM
cell based LUT implementation. The leakage current Ileak is
reduced dramatically from 1.741nA to approximately 0.2nA,
showing the strong impact of leakage reduction methods on
power-critical circuitry. FPGAs support adaptiveness of whole
systems by re-conﬁguration abilities on demand of the appli-
cation. The presented low-power cell design reduces power
consumption signiﬁcantly during the charging and discharging
cycles of re-conﬁguration tasks within an FPGA.
