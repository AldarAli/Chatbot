Abstract—This paper deals with the ranking of domain names, 
which is considered important because it is associated with 
their selling price. For this purpose, four well-known rating 
methods were used, the Massey method, the Colley method, the 
Keener method and finally, a method based on finite Markov 
chains and therefore, called Markov method. Although 
Massey’s, Colley’s and Keener’s methods have their origin in 
sports teams rating, they can be modified and successfully 
applied for domain names ranking. Our effort to correctly 
rank domain names is based on search volume of the keyword 
of each domain and therefore, we used Google trends. We have 
also considered  other factors, such as Alexa rank and keyword 
popularity. Information was collected via Internet and 
implementation of the models took place using computing 
tools. Our study is directly related to the global online 
information and for this reason allows us to do a more 
sophisticated rating model.

 INTRODUCTION 
This paper presents modifications of some sports teams 
rating methods, in order to use them in ranking of domain 
names. This kind of ranking is considered important because 
it is associated with the formation of the price at which 
domain names can be sold. Specifically, these two figures 
are proportional amounts, i.e., the higher the rank of a 
domain name, the higher its selling price will be. 
It is a fact that with the growth of Internet, multiple 
sources of profitability have appeared by its use [2][9]. 
Thus, the concept of domain name emerged, which mainly 
refers to names of websites and their extensions. It has also 
been proved that the ownership of domain names can be 
particularly lucrative for their owners. 
Specifically, each domain name can create value for its 
owner, through revenues from an active website or even 
without the existence of it [9]. Nowadays, due to the rapid 
development of e-commerce on a global level, the domain 
name market has already grown into a robust and profitable 
industry, where millions of customers search time after time 
for high quality domain names in order to promote their 
businesses. Currently, the actual value of a domain name is 
difficult to be accurately determined. However, there is a 
number of objective factors involved in determining the 
final selling price. The ownership of a domain name grants 
its owner two types of rights: 
1 ) Managerial flexibility  
2 ) Legal protection of trademarks. 
Therefore, value can be created from a domain name in two 
ways: either by the expected profits or by options for action, 
such as the creation of an active website. 
    Creating an active site is not so easy, because the 
development of its content requires hard work, thoroughness 
and imagination, contrary to domain name fortification, 
which is achieved by a few "clicks" at the website of the 
pertinent regulatory authority. Acquiring a domain name has 
always 
been 
speculative. 
Aspiring 
investors 
taking 
advantage of new profit opportunities offered by the 
Ιnternet, register a domain name and place a simple graphic 
like "page under construction". Then, they only have to wait 
for someone who has an exploitation plan for the domain 
name, but has however not acquired the appropriate website. 
    Another profitable and efficient strategy is to use a 
synonym for a domain name in conjunction with an 
intensive advertising campaign. The phenomenon of 
“cybersquatting” has also come of which concerns the 
creation of a website with a name, closely related to the 
name of an already popular website in order to exploit its 
reputation.  
Domain names purchase is usually made via an auction. 
Investors often need to know which domain trading is the 
most profitable. A domain name can be considered as an 
investment [3] similarly to the real estate market. However, 
it is not clear how to estimate domain names value, because 
this market is relatively new. Consequently, some domain 
name sellers set selling prices arbitrarily without taking into 
account the actual value of the domain name. Domain name 
ranking can help investors to choose which domain to 
negotiate. Ranking refers only to the domain name and not 
to the active website. 
In this paper, after Section I, which is a short introduction 
to the subject, follows Section II, where we discuss about 
some factors that determine domain names' rate. From these 
factors we chose the most frequently used by the majority of 
107

people involved in domain names market. Section III is an 
overview of the rating methods presented in the paper, while 
Section IV consists of some illustrative examples of how 
these methods can be applied in order to rank certain 
domain names. Finally, Section V presents the experimental 
results generated by these methods that refer to the ranking 
process of domain names. Indicatively, we present top 25 
domain names as a partial list of all the domains we tested. 
II. 
DETERMINANT FACTORS  
In order to rank a group of domain names, we must first 
clarify which are the factors that affect their importance, 
their value and consequently, their rank. It is worth 
mentioning that this market is in embryonic stage, i.e., there 
is no enough literature referring to the selection criteria of 
these factors and no other approaches for domain name 
ranking have yet been proposed. 
Though there are many factors that determine domain 
names’ rank, we indicatively mention these that are usually 
used by the majority of people (domain traders) involved in 
domain names market. These factors can be easily computed 
and are: 
1. keyword popularity: the number of search results 
on Google for a key-word is a good indicator of 
how efficient is the keyword. 
2. search volume of the keyword: the comparison of 
keyword popularity over a period of time. Google 
trends is the most popular and free tool used to 
accomplish this task. In Google trends up to five 
keywords can be queried simultaneously. 
3. traffic: classification of domain name in Alexa. 
Alexa.com is currently the most reliable counter of 
Internet traffic and the most popular service which 
publishes information on the popularity of a 
website. It calculates the global ranking of a domain 
name from the traffic it has. This calculation can be 
done per day, per week, per month etc. The higher 
the ranking is, the greater the value of the name. 
4. domain name extension: the extension of a domain 
name, in other words, the top level domain name 
can affect the value and the rank of the domain 
name. The most dominant extension is .com. Below 
.com, come .net, .org and domestic extensions. 
5. the size of the domain name word: Names with 
many characters are usually hard to memorize so 
those with the least possible characters are more 
preferred. 
Some other factors that also affect domain name rank but 
are difficult enough to be expressed quantitatively are 
industry popularity and brandability. Industry popularity  
relates to the market volume to which a specific domain 
name can be applied, while brandability refers to the case 
that someone comes up with such an interesting new word 
that can become a trademark [5].   
For this first approach of the subject and inspired by [12], 
we thought that keyword popularity, search volume of the 
keyword and traffic measures will have the greatest 
importance among five determinant factors mentioned 
above. 
III. 
OVERVIEW OF METHODS 
First of all, we should define what the terms rating and 
ranking exactly imply and realize the difference between 
them. Rating refers to the evaluation or assessment of an 
item in terms of quality, quantity or some combination of 
both and thus, assigns a numerical value to it. Ranking is a 
relationship between a set of items, i.e., for any two items, 
the first is either 'ranked higher than', 'ranked lower than' or 
'ranked equal to' the second. Therefore, a ranking vector is a 
permutation of the integers 1 through n or, in other words, a 
sorted rating vector [1]. The methods presented in this paper 
are due to K. Massey, W. Colley, J.P. Keener and finally, to 
finite Markov chains. They are being used many years ago 
and had initially been invented for very different purposes. 
Nevertheless, they can all be used for domain names 
ranking or webpages ranking and more generally, for the 
ranking of any set of objects. 
A. Massey’s Method 
This method was proposed by Kenneth Massey in 1997 
for ranking college football teams. Apart from numbers of 
wins and losses of a team, it also considers game scores in 
the ratings, i.e., spread of points, via a system of linear 
equations [4]. Massey’s method is based on the mathematical 
theory of least squares, which can be represented by the 
following equation: 
             
 
 
 
 (1) 
where ri and rj are the ratings of teams i and j, 
respectively and yk is the margin of victory for a game k 
between these teams. Each game k can be given by an 
equation of this form, so a system of m linear equations and 
n unknowns is created, where m is the number of the games 
that have already been played and n is the number of teams 
[1].This system can be written as:  
         
 
 
 
(2) 
and is overdetermined, because    , i.e., there are 
more equations than unknowns. To deal with this problem, 
Massey proposed the use of matrix         instead of    
therefore,  a least squares solution is obtained [7]: 
               
 
 
 
(3) 
Massey matrix M can be easily filled considering that 
every diagonal element      is the total number of games 
played by team   and every off-diagonal element     , for 
   ,  is the negation of the number of games played by 
team   against team  .  Consequently, the Massey least 
squares system now becomes: 
           
 
 
 
(4) 
where       is the Massey matrix described above, 
             is the vector of unknown ratings and  
           is the total difference in scores for each team.

Apart from its simple formation and its much smaller size 
than X, the columns of matrix   are linearly dependent, 
which leads to     ( )    and so, the linear system 
      does not have a unique solution [1]. Massey solved 
this problem by replacing any row in    with a row of all 
ones and the corresponding value of    with a zero. The row 
in   chosen by Massey is the last one. 
Summarizing the Massey Rating Method, firstly we have 
to form the Massey matrix   and the vector d, which 
represents the total difference in scores for team    then we 
have to force matrix M to have full rank by making some 
replacements and finally, we have to solve the linear system 
generated by these replacements in order to take ratings 
vector r [4]. More specifically, we can form the Massey 
matrix         using           , if      and 
       ,  if     , where    is the number of games played 
by team     and       is the number of games played by team   
against team  . The vector d of the total difference in scores 
for team i is given by equation      . We can make the 
rank of matrix M full either by replacing it with       , 
where e is a vector of all ones or by replacing one of the 
rows of M with e and the corresponding entry in d with c [4]. 
Finally, we compute the Massey rating vector   by solving 
the linear system generated by the previous replacement. 
B. Colley’s Method 
This method was proposed by astrophysicist Dr. Wesley 
Colley in 2001 for ranking sports teams. Colley’s method is 
based on very simple statistical principles. In fact, it is a 
modified form of one of the oldest rating systems, which 
uses the percentage of victories of each team. This 
percentage is given by: 
     
  
      
 
 
 
(5)  
where nw are the victories of group i  and  
ntot is the total number of games played for team i [14]. 
Colley’s method makes use of an idea from probability 
theory, known as Laplace’s ‘rule of succession’, which 
transforms the standard winning percentage as below [14]: 
    
     
           
 
 
 
(6) 
As follows from the above, the only information used by 
this model are wins, losses and number of games each team 
played, assuming no ties. Thus, the generated ratings are bias 
free, which implies that certain points gained by each team in 
a game are not included [4]. In other words, a win is a win 
regardless of the score [13]. Due to the use of Laplace’s 
‘rule of succession’, Colley’s method has several 
advantages over the traditional rating formula: 
1. At the beginning of the season, each team has a 
rating of  
 
  , instead of the preseason rating  
 
   of 
the traditional system, which does not make any 
sense. 
2. Colley’s method takes into consideration the 
strength of schedule, which is the strength of a 
team’s opponents. This implies that, if a team beats 
a strong opponent it ought to receive a greater 
reward than if it has beaten a weaker one [1]. 
Then follows a summary of the Colley Rating Method: 
At first, we can form the Colley matrix   using           , 
if      and          ,  if     , where    is the number 
of games played by team     and       is the number of games 
played by team   against team  . Then, we compute vector b 
given by: 
      
  (      )
 
   
 
 
 
(7) 
where    is the number of wins by team i and    is the 
number of loses by team i. Finally, we solve the linear 
system: 
          
 
 
 
 
(8)  
where the r is the rating vector for  the teams [4]. 
 
C. Keener’s Method 
This method has been proposed by James P. Keener in 
1993 for football teams ranking in uneven paired 
competition [6]. Keener’s method is based on the theory of 
nonnegative matrices and forms a smoothed matrix of 
scores [4] generated by Laplace’s rule of succession: 
 
     
            
 
 
 
 
(9) 
Laplace’s rule of succession refers to computing the 
entry i of the Keener matrix, where     is the points that 
team i scored and     is the points scored by team j. The 
reason that Keener uses Laplace's rule of succession ratio is 
to ensure that if a team scores 0 points, the other team does 
not get the entirety of the points [4]. 
    In contrast to Colley’s method, Keener’s method is 
biased, implying that a team can boost its ranking by 
running up its score in a game. In other words, score points 
do matter. 
    Summarizing this method, we can form Keener matrix K 
using: 
        (
     
         )  
 
 
 
(10) 
if team   played against team  , otherwise 0, where     is 
number of points scored by team i against team j and  
 ( )   
 
  
 
     (  
 
 ) √|    |      
 
(11) 
Finally, we can solve           to get Perron vector 
of matrix  ,  i.e., rating vector r. In the linear system given 
above,    is the spectral radius (dominant eigenvalue) of 
 [4]. 
 
D. Markov’s Method 
This method utilizes finite Markov chains theory and 
therefore, it is called Markov Method. It was first used by 
graduate students, Angela Govan and Luke Ingram to 
successfully rank NFL football and NCAA basketball teams 
109

respectively [1], where NFL is the National Football League 
and NCAA is the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
of the United States. 
Markov’s method is known as Generalized Markov 
(GeM) ranking model and is, indeed, an adjustment of the 
famous PageRank algorithm that Google uses for webpage 
ranking. Similarly to PageRank, GeM uses parts of finite 
Markov chains and graph theory in order to generate ratings 
of n objects in a finite set. Not only sports but also any 
problem that can be represented as a weighted directed 
graph can be solved using GeM model [4].  
The main idea behind the Markov Method is voting. In 
every game between two teams the weaker team casts a vote 
for the stronger team. There are many ways for a team to 
vote another. The simplest method uses wins and losses, 
implying that a winning team gains a vote by each team that 
has beaten. A better model would take into account game 
scores, namely, a winning team gets as much votes by a 
weaker opponent as is the margin of victory in the game 
between them. To make the voting method even more 
advanced both teams should be allowed to cast votes equal 
to the number of points given up in the game [1].                 
The main advantage of Markov’s method towards the 
other rating methods is the combination of more than one 
statistics to generate rating vector r. In order to get the GeM 
rating vector    we first form   using voting matrices for the 
  game statistics of interest [4]. This can be done by:  
                  
 
 
(12) 
where         and ∑     .  
Each stochastic matrix    is called a feature matrix and will 
be formed using another statistic. Finally, we compute 
rating vector    the stationary vector or dominant 
eigenvector  of   . If   is reducible, we  use  the  irreducible 
 ̅      (   )    ,         
 
(13) 
where   is the matrix of all ones. 
 
IV. 
ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES 
Methods referred at the previous section have a wide 
variety of applications except of sports. Our thought was to 
apply these methods for ranking domain names. Therefore, 
we used one of the most significant determinant factors 
shown at Section II, which is Google trends.  
Google Trends provides relative numbers. In fact, it 
analyzes a portion of searches done in Google in order to 
compute how many of them have been done for the terms 
entered, compared to the total number of searches done on 
Google over time. Google does not reveal absolute numbers 
for competitive reasons, but also because those numbers 
would not be exact. The fact that Google trends are relative 
numbers implies that there may have been done more 
searches for object A than for object B, but these searches 
may be less than those of another object C. For example, 
assuming that object A is Gauss and object B is Markov, the 
winner is Gauss with 54 Google trends points average 
against Markov’s 27 points average. However, if object C is 
Shannon, Gauss becomes the underdog with 9 points 
average, while Shannon is given 54. This much similarity 
between Google trends and points in a game is exactly the 
reason we decided to use Google trends as determinant factor 
for the ranking methods presented here. 
In the example described below, there are five domain 
names that have been sold in early 2014, which are jean.com, 
desirous.com, authorization.com, true.com and finally, 
peaked.com. We will attempt to rank these domains based on 
search volume average they get by Google trends during 
2013. The question is how can search volume average be 
related to the points that a team succeeded against another? 
There are many ways to define the notion of a game for 
domain names. For example, if statistics on domain names 
are given by Google trends, then we can say that domain   
beats domain   if       , where     and     are the Google 
trends measures for these domains. Therefore,        
represents the difference in trends’ value between domains i 
and j. Table I shows Google trends data for the five domains 
of our example.

Adjusting the Massey rating method  for domain names, 
we start with the same idealized function (1). Then, the 
Massey domain ranking method proceeds as usual, according 
to (4). Below this linear system is showed:

Table II gives rating and ranking data generated by 
Massey method:

As we conclude from the above matrix, jean.com has 
beaten all the other four domain names and, thus, it 
terminates at first position of ranking. Contrary to jean.com, 
domain desirous.com has been defeated by all others,

therefore, it has the lowest rating of all and so, it takes the 
last position of ranking. 
Using the Colley rating method (8) for domain names, we 
get the results below:

As we may see in the above table, jean.com terminates 
again first, while desirous.com gets again the last rank. 
Positions of the three other domains also remain the same.   
Then, we continue with the Keener rating method for 
domain names. Below, the values of Keener matrix K are 
shown: 
(

Table IV gives rating and ranking data generated by 
Keener method:

Table IV indicates more significant difference between 
true.com and authorization.com than before. This can be 
explained by the fact that Keener’s method is not bias-free, 
which means that all the points succeeded in a duel are taken 
into account for ranking. 
The last method we used in order to rank the five domain 
names of our example is Markov method. As we have 
mentioned in Section II, the main idea behind this method is 
voting. In Table V,  follows the trends voting matrix:

    In the small example described in this paper, all four 
methods generate same ranking results. However, Markov’s 
method has a vital difference of the other three. This 
difference comes from the fact that, as we have mentioned in 
Section III, Markov method allows the use of more than one 
statistics. Therefore, Markov method can be characterized as 
more representative than the others. The weights we have set 
for Google trends, Google results and Alexa rank were 0.4, 
0.3 and 0.3 respectively, due to our intention to rely mostly 
on Google trends, though these weights may vary in all the 
possible ways.     
    At this point, we will see the results generated by some 
other determinant factors, such as Google Result and Alexa 
Rank.

    As we have mentioned in Section II, Alexa classifies 
domain names counting the Internet traffic. Alexa ranks only 
domain names with an active website, thus dashes shown in 
Table VII represent domain names with a non-active 
website.    At this point, we should deal with a major issue, 
which is that though Alexa is a ranking system, we want to 
turn it into one that uses points. 
    This issue implies that, though Alexa assigns to rank “1” 
the most visited website, supposedly A, this value as a 
number is smaller than ranks of much less visited websites, 
supposedly B, C, etc. Therefore, we should modify Alexa 
rankings given in Table VII, so that the ordering of the 
ranking values is reversed. One solution to this problem is, 
for   items ranked by Alexa, to compute each item’s rank 
by:  
      
   {         }

where      is the adjusted Alexa rank for website i and     is 
the rank given by Alexa for website i. However, this solution 
is not so fair for some items of the set. For instance, in case 
we have to rank domains google.com, facebook.com and 
desirous.com,  rank given by Alexa is “1”, “2” and “no 
enough data to rank this website”, respectively. Thus, when 
dividing the total number of items ranked, namely “3”, with 
each item’s rank we get the results below: 
 
Three points are assigned to google.com  
 
Two points is assigned to facebook.com and 
 
One point is also assigned to desirous.com 
    The unfairness of this solution lies in that points of 
facebook.com, which is an active website, are very close to 
points of a non-active website, as is desirous.com. Thus, we 
should use a better solution, which is described below. 
    This better solution might be obtained using the following 
equation: 
       
    
    
 
 
 
 
(19)  
where     is the total number of websites ranked by Alexa. 
Despite of our thorough research, we have not found any 
official source referring exactly how many websites are 
currently ranked by Alexa. Therefore, we have chosen a 
typically large number, namely,       for     variable 
mentioned before, i.e., we divide        with each item’s 
rank to turn the ordering of the ranking values into 
descending. In Table VII, we have written the adjusted Alexa 
score value of each domain. 
    As we can see in Table VII, true.com has the higher traffic 
amount of all, while before adjustment it was at the third 
position of Alexa rank. Then comes jean.com and 
authorization.com, which is the domain showed up to be at 
the first position before adjustment. Domains desirous.com 
and peaked.com take both the value “1” for their traffic, 
which is the value assigned to non-active websites.  
   Finally, in Table VIII, we tested the five domains of our 
example applying Markov method with three determinant 
factors, which are Google trends, Google results and Alexa 
rank. The results generated are shown in the table below.

    Table IX is a summary table, which shows the domain

As we see, due to the use of more than one determinant 
factors in this ranking, rank positions between the first two 
domains have interchanged and this agrees with the selling 
prices. 
V. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
At first, we should describe our database, which contains 
information on transaction prices collected from publicly 
available tenders and values from databases of domain 
names coming from closed auctions data. Currently the 
database consists of 75,000 transaction prices that occurred 
during the period between 1999 and 2013. The database is 
updated regularly and it is worth mentioning that the 
collection of data required some effort since selling prices 
are not always available in digital form, even when they are 
published. In order to gather our data from Internet 
resources, we have implemented a web crawler in Java. Our 
crawler is typically programmed to visit sites, which contain 
domain names’ selling prices, Google trends, keyword 
popularity and traffic measures. The crawling process was 
held by taking into account the reliability of  information. 
The data gathering process also involved parsing data files.  
In any case, data gathering and parsing had to be 
automated. We have conducted thorough research and have 
already implemented some techniques for parallelization of 
collecting data, in order to keep our database updated in 
time. For more details about crawling, its parallelization and 
parsing processes we refer the reader to [8]. 
The rest of this paper presents the empirical results 
generated by the four methods described at Section III when 
we applied them to our database data. The numerical 
computations of the ratings were done using Matlab. Tables 
XI to XIV have been constructed in the following format: 
the first column represents the ranking of domains, the 
second column is the domain name itself, the third column 
represents the rating of each domain, the fourth column is 
the price at which the domain name was sold and finally, the 
last column consists of the date on which each domain was 
sold. Though we refer to selling price, it cannot be a reliable 
measure of comparison, due to its dependance of the time 
that happened.   
 In Tables XI to XIV, we present top 25 domain names as 
a partial list of all the domains we tested, using Google 
trends determinant factor for the year 2013. Each table 
shows the top 25 domains, according to one of the methods. 
We tested domain names with same Top Level Domain 
(TLD), i.e., .com. Table XIV shows the results of Markov 
method using three determinant factors, Google trends, 
Google results and Alexa rank. Similarly to Section IV, the 
weights we used for these factors were 0.4, 0.3 and 0.3 
respectively. Due to the reliability of method Markov that 
takes into account three determinant factors, we have also 
included in its table the importance degree given to the 
domain by Google PageRank (PR). Briefly, PageRank 
algorithm states that a website is important if it is 
shown by other important websites. This degree gets values

from 1 to 10 (PR1 - PR10). The higher the PageRank 
obtained from a website, the higher its ranking position 
in search results [11]. The comparison among Markov 
method and Google PageRank shows that there are many 
results in common between them. 
In order to compare the generated ranking lists, we make 
use of Kendall ‘s correlation measure  , which gives the 
degree to which one list agrees (or disagrees) with another 
[1] and is computed by: 
Kendall’ s tau    
     
 (   )   (19), where    is the number 
of concordant pairs and    is the number of discordant 
pairs. 
Kendall ‘s tau value varies between -1 and 1, i.e., 
      . If    , then the two lists are in perfect 
agreement, while if      , the two lists are totally 
opposite to each other [10]. Comparing the methods 
described in this paper, according to Kendall ‘s tau, we get 
the results below: 
TABLE X. KENDALL’S TAU TABLE 
Pair of Methods

Massey - Markov 
-0.451 
Colley - Keener 
0.9969 
Colley - Markov 
-0.4431 
Keener - Markov 
-0.44 
 
From Table X, we conclude that methods Massey, Colley 
and Keener are very alike, while Markov is differentiated 
due to the use of more than one determinant factors that 
provides. 
Then, follow the tables that show the top 25 domain 
names according to each of the four methods we described.

VI. 
CONCLUSIONS – FUTURE PLANS 
    In this paper, we saw how we can rank domain names 
with four different methods. These methods are mainly used 
in sports industry. Compared to the others, Markov method 
allows  ranking based on more than just one factor and as 
we saw in Section IV, this is crucial in the formation of 
ranking values.    
     For generating our empirical results using Massey, 
Colley and Keener method, we used Google trends as 
determinant factor, while in Markov method, we used 
Google trends, Google results and Alexa rank. Determinant 
factors were chosen according to what are people involved 
in domain name market looking for. In our empirical results, 
we cannot use the selling price as criterion to check if 
rankings lists generated via different ranking methods 
match. This is due to the fact that selling prices were formed 
based on past factors or data, while our ranking is based on 
current factors or data. This is also confirmed by PageRank 
indicator.  
    In conclusion, rating methods presented in the paper may 
be used by many groups of people, such as domain traders, 
portfolio managers and investors. Concerning to decision 
making process, i.e., if someone decides to purchase a 
domain name according to its rank, the methods presented 
in this paper can be a utility tool, but not the only one. 
    Finally, when we compared the ranking lists according to 
Kendall’s tau correlation method, we conclude that Massey, 
Colley and Keener have much in common, while Markov is 
different enough due to the factors it takes into account. 
    Our goal for the future is to use more determinant factors 
for domain names ranking, such as brandability and internet 
popularity, but also to test even more rating methods, such 
as Elo’s system or the Park-Newman method.
