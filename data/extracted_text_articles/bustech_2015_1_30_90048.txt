Abstract—The complexity of a system is generated by a lot of 
interactive and interdependent components with dynamic 
behaviors working together as a whole system. However, the 
quantitative analysis of the complexity generated by these 
components and their behaviors and its impact on the system 
still lacks practical methodology.  This paper aims to design a 
framework to measure the complexity of complex supply 
chain. The first step is to understand and represent the 
complexity using an extended conceptual model. Due to the 
similarity between system and process complexity, we can thus 
develop the formulas to measure system complexity based on 
the metrics of process complexity as well as the properties of 
complex system. The validation is done through a classical 
supply chain phenomenon – the bullwhip effect, which can be 
demonstrated using a serious game called beer distribution 
game. We set two scenarios in the game and compare their 
complexity values. This framework can also be applied to 
evaluate the impact and complexity of changes in a system. 
Keywords-complex system; process complexity; complexity 
measurement; supply chain; bullwhip effect 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
What is complex? Some intuitive understanding is that 
complex is “not easy to understand or analyze” [1] or 
complexity is “something difficult to replace”. There are 
many definitions of complex system from different fields 
and aspects.  The consensus is that a complex system has 
“enormous elements interact with one another and with the 
environment” [2]. 
From a scientific view, even though the complexity of 
various systems manifests in diverse ways, there is certain 
commonality among them. Bar-Yam [1] summarizes some 
universal properties of complex system: 
• Elements (and their number) 
• Interactions (and their strength) 
• Environment (and its demands) 
• Activities (and their objectives) 
• Diversity/Variability 
• Formation/Operation (and their time scales) 
Supply chain is viewed as a complex system [3] 
consisting of a set of activities, agents, technological and 
physical infrastructures which interact with each other 
through information exchange and material flows in order to 
reach business goals. It is also highly influenced by the 
environment, e.g., the policies and external markets, and the 
requests for customization of products and services. The 
formation of supply chain refers to the emergence, e.g., a 
global supply network emerges with not single one firm 
deliberately organizing and controlling it [4].  
Before measuring complexity, the first step is to 
understand the system, as the quantitative knowledge arises 
from this qualitative understanding [5]. 
As noticed, the difference between simple and complex 
system is that the latter one focuses on the “interconnected” 
or “interwoven” part. This requires that one must understand 
not only the behavior of the underlying parts but also how 
they act together to form the behavior of the whole complex 
system [1]. Experiments indicate that experts can have 
deeper understanding on a domain system by integrated 
thinking from the perspective of structural (elements of a 
system), behavioral (mechanisms), and functional aspects of 
a system; while the novices tend to focus on perceptually 
available, static components of the system. This can be 
explained by a framework called Structure–Behavior–
Function 
(SBF) 
theory, 
which 
focuses 
on 
causal 
understandings of the relationships among different aspects 
of the system [6]. Therefore, it is necessary to align the 
common understanding that the system needs to be 
understood from both aspects of components and their 
interrelationships.  
There are two basic strategies to model a general 
complex system: analytic tools dealing with elements and 
interactions and computer simulation handling descriptions 
and information [1]. Some researchers argue that the analytic 
thinking has limitations on processing human and 
organization elements in system design and less support to 
mathematical modeling for unstructured problems [5] 
comparing with the simulation techniques, which can be 
used to model the behaviors of agents.  
The application area of our research is the supply chain 
system and we can try to take the strong points of both 
analytic and simulation methods on it. The first step is to 
build a conceptual model via identification and description of 
the parts as well as their interactions in supply chain. After 
the key information is captured, we could go for the 
quantitative analysis using simulation approaches.

The objective of this paper is 1) To extend a conceptual 
model based on an existing one to represent the key 
information of the supply chain complex system 2) To set a 
framework with metrics to measure system complexity 3) To 
validate these metrics using an industrial example. 
This rest of this paper is structured as follows: in Section 
2, a conceptual model based on PROS is elaborated; the 
relevant factors to the system complexity and their value 
assignment are discussed; the complexity metrics of the 
whole system are formulated and demonstrated. In Section 3, 
the findings are summarized and further research is outlined. 
II. 
APPROACH 
Previous research proposed a conceptual model called 
Process, Role, Object and State (PROS) to extract the key 
elements and their various relationships of a supply chain 
[7]. It is used to describe a change management process.   
The quantity (size) of the elements and the relationships 
in a system can be easily calculated via this approach. 
However, this is not sufficient to reflect the “diversity” of 
each element, nor the various relationships among them.  
For example, there is only one type of serial relationship 
between two processes.  And current description for each 
element is still on the abstract level, without more details to 
distinguish them. When evaluating their impacts on the 
whole system, more precise information is needed.  
In this section, the conception of PROS idea is enriched 
and thus can be used to quantify the complex system. 
A. Basic definitions  
Since many terms have been defined in previous research 
[7], in this subsection we only focus on the new content and 
the parts which may cause ambiguity. 
1) Goals of the system 
A system usually has a definable objective or function [1]. 
From the supply chain view, the activities of a system are 
either directly related to cost reduction, turnover increase or 
have indirect benefits in general, e.g., quality (higher 
flexibility and better forecast accuracy), speed (shorter 
committable lead time), cost (enabler for cost reduction), 
customer service (better delivery reliability or delivery 
performance). By using these criteria as Key Performance 
Indicators (KPI) we have indication whether the activities in 
a system is valuable or not. 
2) Business system and boundary 
A business system has dynamic (processes) and static 
(objects) aspects. A business system refers to the value-
added chain, which describes the value-added process. The 
system has boundaries and interacts with other surrounding 
systems via interfaces [8][9]. 
3) Process and activities 
The supply chain process is recognized as one type of the 
business process. A process is made up of multiple steps, 
also referred to as activities, and has to be completed in a 
predetermined order. An atomic activity consists of a single 
process step or action and cannot be subdivided. There is 
interdependency among the activities within one process. A 
business process also has goals and can be viewed as a 
system [8][9]. 
4) Objects and states 
Two types of objects can be distinguished: an information 
object and a business object. An information object is 
described via a data structure in an IT system and a business 
object presents physical objects in real-world [8][10]. 
5) Roles (Agents) 
Roles can be replaced by the term agent in many 
situations. From the simulation view, agents are usually 
autonomous or intelligent, representing a human being, an 
organization or an autonomous machine [4].  
6) Relationships and others 
For this part please refer to our previous research [7]. 
The conception model can be illustrated by a serious 
game called beer distribution game, which was firstly 
invented by Jay Forrester at MIT in the 1960s to explain the 
bullwhip effect [11]. The purpose of this game is to 
understand the dynamics of a multi-roles supply chain and 
how demand fluctuates in the different distribution stages. 
A widely-accepted beer game setup usually has five 
stages: customer, retailer, wholesaler, distributor and 
factory. Two flows run in the supply chain, one up and one 
down. For the order flow, the customer orders units of beer 
from the retailer and the retailer sends its order to its 
upstream - the wholesaler until the final order is received by 
the upstream end of the chain- the factory. Vice versa is the 
delivery flow: the factory produces beers and delivers to 
other three downstream stages until it reaches the end 
customer. It is noticed that, there are possible delays in the 
flow between each stage considering the shipping and 
information time. 
The task for each supply chain partner is to fulfill 
incoming orders and keep the inventory/backorder cost at 
the minimum level.  
We thus identify all the key components in this beer 
supply chain system: five roles, two main processes (order 
flow, delivery flow) with time delay on different stages, one 
main object order and its two states (inventory, backorder).  
B. Complexity attributes and impact on system 
As mentioned in Subsection A.3, a process can also be 
viewed as a system. Similar to the system complexity, the 
process complexity has the “difficulty to describe and 
execute a process” [12]. Therefore, we assume the 
methodology to measure process complexity can be learned 
and adapted to the system complexity measurement.   
Based on the metrics and formulas to measure process 
complexity [12], in addition to the specific properties of 
complex system, we list the factors which affect the 
complexity of a system. The overall complexity of a system 
is represented as Cs.  
 
Environment: the part interacts with the internal 
components of a system. Environment E may have 
one of several variables. Let Z = number of external 
variables E1, E2 …Ez interacting with system.

 
Components: let N = quantity (size) of all 
components in a system; let M be the quantity of all 
(static) relationships among components. 
 
Diversity: the more diverse a system is, the higher 
the complexity it contains.  Let d be the value of 
diversity, for each component i, its diverse value d1, 
d2… di… dN; di ∈ (0, 1] with 1 being very diverse, 
and 0 not diverse. 
 
Emergence: this property depends on the entire 
system and reflects its relationships L, L ∈ (0, 1] 
with 1 the system being very cooperative, and 0 not 
cooperative at all. 
 
Interactions: complexity RE is interactions related to 
the environment and complexity RI is interactions 
within internal components. For each component i, 
Ri,z is the interaction with one environment factor z, 
RiE (𝑅𝑖𝐸 = ∑
𝑅𝑖,𝑧
𝑍
𝑧=1
 ) is the total interactions with 
all factors in environment; Ri,j is the interaction with 
one internal component j and RiN (𝑅𝑖𝑁 = ∑
𝑅𝑖,𝑗
𝑁
𝑗=1
 ) 
is the total interactions within the remaining part of 
the system. R value depends on the different types of 
interactions and the rules predefined (if there are 
any). For the types of interaction, if component i and 
j belongs to the same category of components, Ri,j 
has smaller value than if they belong to the different 
ones. For the rules, e.g., the value of interaction with 
outside system is assumed to be much higher than 
internal ones, Ri,z >> Ri,j.   
 
Activities and Goals: each activity and involved 
components have certain impact on the goals. The 
better the activity matches the goal, the less 
complexity the system has. This attribute can be 
subdivided into 3 factors: for each component, 1) its 
commitment to the overall goal 2) the importance 
(comparing with other components) to the goal 3) 
the collaboration with other components. 
 
Commitment to the intention (goal): let G be the 
numeric value of intention fulfillment, for each 
component i, G1, G2… Gi… GN; Gi ∈ (0, 1] with 1 
satisfying the intention perfectly, and 0 does not 
meet the goal at all. 
 
Order of importance to satisfy the intention: let α be 
the weight value of importance, for each component 
i, α 1, α 2… α i … α N, α i  ∈ (0,1] with 1 being most 
important, and 0 not important to the goal,  
 
Collaboration with other components: or conflicts. 
Let β be the weight value for collaboration, for each 
component i, β 1, β 2… β i… β N, β i ∈ (0, 1] with 1 
being very collaborative, and 0 not collaborative to 
others at all.  
Above analysis doesn’t differentiate the categories of 
components for each Ci, in this step we need to include the 
individual features for each type of element in PROS.  To 
make the analysis easier, we can simply add one coefficient 
γ for each type, γp, γr, γo, γs stands for the coefficient of 
process, role, object and state. Accordingly, for each 
component i, its complexity Ci = {Cp, Cr, Co, Cs}. 
For the role element, some additional features need to be 
highlighted.  In this paper, we only give some qualitative 
analysis:  
 
Intelligence: If Agent is intelligent, the influence is 
higher than non-intelligent ones on the system.  
 
Influence to the system: some agents have more 
power than others in the organization or system.  
 
Level 
of 
convergence: 
decided 
by 
skills, 
experiences, knowledge, etc. A higher level of 
convergence correlates to a lower level of 
complexity in the system.  
C. Formulation  
Based on the attributes listed in Subsection B, we can 
define some formulas to measure the system complexity Cs.

Equation (1) addresses the impact of one single 
component to the whole system; (2) focus on the interaction 
between one single component to the other components 
within and outside of system; and (3) is about the overall 
complexity. 
We also need to know how to set the values of variables 
in these formulas.  Based on the data sources and methods 
to obtain them, we can divide these variables into three 
types:  
 
N, M - the natural number, which can be acquired 
from the physical world directly from the statistic 
tools or the enumeration method.  
 
Ri,z , Ri,j –  the values can be perceived from the 
physical world on a certain degree, for example, it 
is easy to observe which types of relationships they 
are, however, for more precise weights for each 
relationships type, some predefined measures need 
to be done, which can be based on the empirical 
results. For example, Gruhn and Laue defined a 
table which summarizes all possible relationships 
as well as their cognitive weight values [13]. These 
rules are easy to understand, e.g., the weight of 
sequential relationship type is 1, and for the 
iterative type it is 4. It is obvious that the latter one 
is more complex than the former one.  
 
For these values α, β, γ, d, L and G – these values 
cannot be observed from the physical world 
directly. An easy way is to assign their values 
17

based on the domain experience, e.g., set three 
scales: low, medium and high.  For calculation, the 
scales can be assigned value with, e.g., 0.2, 0.5, 
and 0.8. These values can be easily tuned within 
the simulation environment.  A more accurate but 
complicated way is to collect the data via certain 
experiments and do statistical analysis. There are 
some other indirect approaches, e.g., we can 
subdivide one factor into several more detailed sub 
factors and thus get an accumulated value. Just like 
the γ for the agent element, it needs to consider the 
humans skills and influence, etc.  
III. 
VALIDATION 
We continue our validation with the beer game. It is 
played online via the platform provided by University of 
Houston and we choose the game “SCM_1409_24” for our 
analysis [14]. In this game, the participants were divided 
into two groups and each group performed one scenario.  
Scenario 1 with communication (S1): supply chain 
partners are allowed to exchange and share information with 
each other in order to get better forecasting about the order 
quantity and thus reduce the cost of inventory/backorder.  
Scenario 2 without communication (S2): supply chain 
players are not allowed to communicate and collaborate 
with each other. If the order from customer is not visible for 
the whole chain, the upstream stage has to forecast the 
demand by itself. In this game, the cost of one inventory 
unit is configured as 0.5, while one backorder unit costs 1.  
Hence the players tend to order more than necessary in 
order to have a safety stock. The deviations are accumulated 
and thus the overall supply chain cost is increased. 
Table I shows the results for each supply chain partner 
in two scenarios, including the order quantity per week and 
inventory/backorder cost.

We would like to compare the complexity of these two 
supply chain scenarios. For the simplicity, we only consider 
the changeable parts which have impact on the complexity. 
Some assumptions are given below: 
 
The external factors have the same impact for the 
two scenarios 
 
Diversity factor is the same for two scenarios  
 
The size of system components and their 
interrelationships (static part) are the same 
 
The role complexity of customer is the same; while 
the other 4 roles have different behaviors 
 
The order flow process execution time increased 
33% in S1 (γp1 = 1.33, γp2 = 1) 
From above analysis, we only need to extract the 
relevant factors: α, β, G, R and L.  
The values of α and G (see Table II) can be calculated 
from the results in Table I. The α value is decided by its cost 
percentage in the overall supply chain. E.g., the retailor in 
S1 has the lowest cost, so it contributes the most importance 
value to the goals (to reduce the overall cost). The G value 
is used to evaluate the demand forecast accuracy. The closer 
to the end customer demand, the higher value it has.

And the values of β, R (see Table III) can be acquired 
from the system configuration. For one single stage, β 
counts the total number of roles it collaborates with. R 
stands for the number of interactions, which is much higher 
in S1 than in S2.

The L value is difficult to obtain from above data; 
therefore we simply set three scales for it: low, medium and 
high.  From the observation in the game, the collaboration 
of S1 can be considered as the medium level. Because the 
highest value of L is 1, which means the total supply chain 
cost should be 0. In our case the total cost of S1 is 846 so 
we set L = 0.5; for S2 we choose L = 0.2. 
By using the equations in Subsection C, we get the ratio 
of complexity of S2 to S1 is 5.39, which is very close to the 
18

cost ratio of S2 to S1, 5.52. Although it is too early to 
conclude that there is some causal relationship between 
supply chain cost and complexity, we can at least state that: 
1) the supply chain complexity and cost have the same 
trend. 2) The communication and collaboration could reduce 
the overall supply chain complexity via information sharing.   
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEP 
This work-in-progress paper has proposed a framework 
to understand and measure the system complexity by 
capturing its key information. It analyzes the complexity 
influence factors and their impact on the system. Based on 
the process complexity and complex system attributes, the 
metrics to measure complexity for both individual 
components and the entire system are formulated. A supply 
chain example is used to demonstrate this framework.  
So far, our work is mainly built on the hypothesis of 
complexity measurement.  In the next step, our research will 
focus on the fine tuning of these metrics and further 
validation. 
A. Value assignment for influence factors  
Part of the variables, e.g., “L” is assigned based on the 
cognitive experience.  To obtain more accurate values, we 
can employ survey, e.g., having interviews with experts 
from industry; and investigate more empirical results for 
similar problems.   
B. The spatiotemporal features 
Current measurement only considers the execution time 
of process, which is not sufficient to reflect a complex 
system. Other features, e.g., objects with lifecycles; 
processes in different locations should also be included. 
The dynamic complexity is highly dependent on the time 
and space changes. Therefore, the quantitative impact of 
time and space need to be included in the future research.  
C. The complexity of system changes 
As soon as the spatiotemporal feature is considered, we 
could evaluate the impact of changes on system.  
By using the differentiation operation on (3), we can get 
the ∆Cs, which stands for the complexity of changes. 
D. Simulation and validation 
Simulation techniques have been widely used in the 
complex systems. Discrete-event simulation and agent-
based modeling are two popular methods.  
To validate our hypothesis, we can use the simulation 
tool because it could support batch data processing and track 
many parameters in one model. By setting different values 
for the input parameters, we can analyze the impact of each 
variable to the complexity of the entire system.  
The changes of system and their impact on the system 
can also be modeled. Fernandes, Arlindo and Henriques 
proposed a modeling framework to assess the impact of 
changes in a process, in which attributes are defined as 
variables and behaviors (process steps) are treated as the 
functions of variables [15]. This idea is worth considering 
for the further research on the change management of 
supply chain.
