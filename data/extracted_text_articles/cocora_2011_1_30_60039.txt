Abstract—We design a novel routing procedure for multihop
cognitive radio networks composed of adequate metrics and a
strategy to combine these metrics. In cognitive radio networks,
channels are not permanently available. The objective is then
to increase channel availability when the routes are established.
Two global metrics are deﬁned. The stability metric evaluates
the utilization efﬁciency of channels by capturing their sporadic
availability to cognitive users. The predicted power metric es-
timates the spectrum capabilities for the on-going transmission
without interrupting licensed users. We use fuzzy logic theory to
compute and combine these metrics in order to make suitable
routing decisions. Numerical analysis and simulation results show
that our procedure is able to ﬁnd the route that goes through
the nodes with better channel conditions. Fuzzy logic seems then
to be an appropriate technique to decide the routes to establish
in multihop cognitive radio networks.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cognitive Radio is an emerging and promising technology
that aims to increase the overall utilization of radio resources
by enabling dynamic allocation of portions of the wireless
spectrum. Unlicensed users, through cognitive radio devices,
can opportunistically operate over the current unused parts
of licensed bands called white spaces, spectrum holes, or
spectrum opportunity [1]. The unlicensed users should be
equipped with new smart and programmable radios that sense
large portions of the spectrum, learn their surrounding en-
vironment, analyze and make intelligent decisions, identify
the instantaneous unused channels, use multiple channels in
parallel, dynamically reconﬁgure their transmission parameters
to adapt to the current unused parts of the licensed bands.
Proposed traditional routing solutions in multi-channel mul-
tihop ad hoc and mesh networks are not appropriate for
cognitive radio networks (CRN). First, in CRN no static
spectrum allocation is possible hence nodes cannot assume
permanent access to the channels. Therefore, the channel
selection must be part of the routing decisions and must be
taken at the network layer jointly with the MAC (Medium
Access Control) layer. Second, the transmission of unlicensed
users on a channel can be interrupted by the licensed users
activity thus forcing cognitive radios (CR) to look for in-
stantaneously available opportunities. As a direct result, the
Part of this work was supported by the grant ANR-10-VERS-005-03
unlicensed users should permanently scan the spectrum and
choose the appropriate route to follow before starting the
transmission. The established path should avoid, if possible,
route handover. Third, the unlicensed users should adapt their
transmission power to avoid any interference with licensed
users operating over the primary radios (PR), which have the
absolute priority of using the channels.
In this paper, we introduce a novel routing procedure based
on the inferred behavior of licensed users. Each channel at
each node is evaluated by two metrics. First, the stability met-
ric aims to reﬂect the utilization efﬁciency of the spectrum by
studying the sporadic availability of the licensed bands to the
unlicensed users. Second, the transmission power estimation
metric aims to characterize allowed transmission power and
its variation over time. We use the fuzzy logic theory [2] to
combine these metrics in order to make good routing decisions.
In general, fuzzy logic allows the partial membership of a vari-
able x in a set A. The degree of membership is speciﬁed using
membership functions and linguistic variables. Fuzzy logic
theory is an adapted technique to solve the uncertainty, the
heterogeneity, and the information incompleteness of routing
problems in cognitive radio environment. Particularly, even if
the properties of channels are well identiﬁed, it is still difﬁcult
to assess with certainty the impact of these properties on the
performance of a given route.
The contribution of this paper is twofold. First in presenting
routing metrics that characterize the dynamic and unstable
aspects of cognitive radio networks and second in proposing
a technique that avoids combining these parameters through
inﬂexible methods similar to the weighted sum. Indeed, the
fuzzy logic allows partial membership of a channel to a metric
and a metric to a path thus capturing the dynamic and uncertain
behavior observed in cognitive radio networks. Besides, we
validate our metrics and routing procedure with simulations
and show that our routing ensures long term stability by
implicitly accounting for instantaneous channels variations.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Routing in Cognitive Radio Networks
Because in Cognitive Radio Networks channels are not
permanently available, proposed routing techniques for multi-
channel multi-hop ad hoc or mesh networks cannot be reused
for CRNs. Any proposed routing strategy in CRNs should
13

characterize the non-permanent availability and describe the
sporadic accessibility of the spectrum bands. Other CRN
routing proposals address the above issue by simply computing
the percentage of availability for each channel [3] [4].
B. Objective
We consider a multihop cognitive radio network where data
is forwarded through multiple cognitive radio nodes between a
source and a destination. Cognitive nodes try to share several
channels occupied by licensed users belonging to different
networks and thus having different properties. The objective
is then to design an appropriate routing strategy that builds
a single path from a source node to a destination using only
cognitive radio nodes as intermediate relays. The steps of the
design are as follows:
1) Given a multihop cognitive radio network, ﬁnd the best
routing metrics that best characterize the availability and
usability of the channels.
2) Given a number of computed metrics, propose a ﬂexible
method of combining parameters able to capture uncer-
tainty and variations of the computed metrics.
3) Given the metrics and their combination, ﬁnd the best
path between a source node and a destination. The path
is composed of an aggregated set of channels on every
hop.
III. ROUTING METRICS
We describe in this part the proposed routing metrics and
their combination using fuzzy logic. We ﬁrst emphasize on the
stability metric and the transmission power estimation. Then,
a channel weight is computed for every link by the means of
a fuzzy logic controller.
A. Stability
The goal of the stability metric is to capture the activity
behavior of PR nodes over the licensed channels and hence
the sporadic availability of these channels to CR nodes. In
other words, the stability aims to describe how the availability
of channels is distributed over time. The distribution model
of channels availability can be described by the number of
periods during which channels are available to CR transmis-
sions and the manner these periods are disposed in time,
such as the distance between two successive periods and
the difference in their durations. We call a channel stable
when it switches between long available periods and/or long
unavailable periods. When unavailable periods are small the
channel is of course excellent to use, but long unavailable
periods also provide us a good information which is avoiding
to use the channel for sure. An unstable channel switches
quickly between availability and unavailability. The degree of
stability can be speciﬁed according to its position between a
channel that is almost static and a highly unstable channel.
In this work, we use 3 parameters to compute the stability of
channels. The frequency of transitions between availability and
unavailability, the deviation in the duration of available periods
and the deviation in the duration of unavailable periods. In
the following, we describe the impact of each parameter on
the stability. Figure 1 shows an example of the impact of
the frequency of transitions between available and unavailable
periods on the stability of channels. It is clear that for the
same percentage of channel availability, the degree of stability
decreases proportionally with the increase of the frequency of
transitions.
(a) Stable channel
(b) Unstable channel
Fig. 1.
Impact of frequency of transitions on the stability
Figure 2 shows that two channels with the same percentage
of availability and the same frequency of transitions can have
two different degrees of stability. This can be captured by the
deviation of available periods. We notice that when the value
of deviation in the duration of available periods increases,
the distribution model of channel availability is more similar
to the stable case. In fact, the availability of the channel in
Figure 2(a) is composed of one long and several short available
periods. The long period is similar to the long available period
in the original stable case in Figure 1(a) and the short periods
are almost not useful and can offer in the rest of the time the
same performance as the long unavailable period in Figure
1(a). Similar remarks can be made about the unavailability
periods deviation where the increase of the unavailable periods
duration increases the system stability.

(b) Low σONperiods

Impact of availability deviation σONperiods on the stability
To compute the degree of stability of each channel, we
combine the 3 parameters using the Fuzzy Logic Controller
FLC 1. The FLC 1 consists of 3 inputs linguistic variables
(frequency of transitions between availability and unavail-
ability (input1), deviation in the duration of available pe-
riods (input2), and deviation in the duration of unavailable
periods (input3)). FLC 1 inputs are characterized by the
membership functions depicted in Figure 3(a), whereas its
output linguistic variable (Stability), is characterized by the
membership function depicted in Figure 3(b). Each input
linguistic variable is speciﬁed by a term of three fuzzy
sets, T(input) = [Low, Medium, High]. The output linguis-
tic variable is characterized by a term of four fuzzy sets,
T(output) = [V eryLow, Low, Medium, High].

The output is a value between 0 and 100. In order to
obtain the channel stability, we deﬁne the fuzzy Rule Base
shown in Table I. This table is a proposal for the FLC 1
determined via the analysis in the previous section but also
by observations during simulations. Note that the rule base
is malleable enough so that other researchers can argue and
propose different rules for different reasons. For instance, if
the frequency of transitions is medium and the deviations are
very high, one can consider that the stability is high rather
than medium.

B. Transmission Power Estimation
The stability metric characterizes the spectrum holes to
be used by cognitive radio transmissions. Nevertheless in
order to exploit these white spaces, CRs must judiciously
compute their transmission power in a way not to disturb
primary radios activity. Moreover, since interference at PRs is
additive, the estimated transmission power should also account
for neighboring CRs activity over the channel. Consequently
every CR should continuously estimate the maximum allowed
transmission power Pmax over every available channel. Practi-
cally, the estimated transmission power dictates the set of CR
receivers on every channel i.e the obtained CRN topology.
The predicted Pmax to be considered for next transmissions
can be computed based on a set of previously measured values
of Pmax, in addition to the current measured value. Many
methods exist in the literature to predict the next value of
random variables such as regression models or Kalman ﬁlters.
The appropriate prediction method to use is out of the scope
of this work. We rather focus on how we can beneﬁt from the
results obtained from the prediction method by considering a
general output from the prediction module. We assume in this
work that any considered estimation technique, provides the
predicted value PP redicted of Pmax and the conﬁdence interval
[PP redicted- β, PP redicted+β], where β is the error level.

The FLC2 consists of two linguistic variables inputs
(PP redicted and β) characterized by the membership functions
depicted in Figure 4(a) and 4(b), and one output linguis-
tic variable (FinalPredictedPower), characterized by the
membership function depicted in Figure 4(c). PP redicted is
characterized by a term of three fuzzy sets, T(PP redicted)
= [Low,Medium,High], and β is characterized by one fuzzy
set, T(β) = [High]. The output linguistic is characterized by
T(output) = [VeryLow,Low,Medium,High]. The exact output
power can be computed in Watts by normalization however
this operation is not necessary since the objective in our metric
is the comparison between channels.
Finally, note that FinalPredictedPower is the maximum
allowed transmission power beyond which primary users are
disturbed. It is not necessarily the power that is going to
be used when transmitting. Clearly, the used power can be
optimized based on the location of the receiver node.

The policy of FLC2 is based on six simple rules shown in
table II. Rules 1, 3, and 5 indicate that the ﬁnal result of the
predicted power (FinalPredictedPower) is proportional to
the value of PP redicted. Rules 2, 4, and 6 point that the ﬁnal
result of the predicted power of a channel with a high value
of β must be lower than a channel with a comparable value
of PP redicted and smaller value of β.

C. Channel grade
The Fuzzy Logic Controller FLC3 depicted in Figure 5
combines these two routing metrics to compute the grade of
each channel at each node. The best channel is the most stable
channel with a high ﬁnal predicted value of Pmax (greater than
the minimum needed for transmission). The higher the ﬁnal
predicted power, the higher the number of neighbors and thus
the higher the route possibilities to select. Also, a higher ﬁnal
predicted power provides a security margin before violating it.
Membership functions are depicted in Figure 5, while other
ﬁner rules are summarized in table III.

IV. ROUTE CONSTRUCTION
The computation of the routing metrics must take place
for each channel in all the routes from the source to the
destination. The grade of a link between two CR nodes (a
value between 0 and 100) is equal to the sum of the grades
of all channels that are going to be used for transmission

between these two nodes. As for the grade of a route we aim
at including in the ﬁnal grade also the number of hops. To
do so, the link grades are inverted, then the ﬁnal grade is the
inverse of their sum. The route with the highest grade is the
best route from the source to the destination since the lowest
sum of the inverted link grades tends intrinsically to reduce
the number of hops in addition to considering links with high
grades.
More formally, if we denote by R the set of all routes
between a source node S and a destination D, and by nr the
number of links that constitute route r, r ∈ R, then computing
the best route based on the grades of routes between S and D
can be written as
max
r∈R
 nr
X
l=1
1/gr
l
!−1
(1)
where gr
l is the grade of link l in route r (l ∈ 1 · · · nr, r ∈ R).
When the source wants to establish a connection, it is
possible to incorporate the computation of the route grades
in an AODV-like [5], [3] or a DSR-like [6] routing protocol
that allows also to reach the destination.
The predicted maximum allowed power for transmission
should be updated while the route is constructed towards
the destination. This is because the addition of a channel
to the route activates the channel for transmission and will
add possibly an interference at PR receivers. The predicted
power is then possibly reduced for the same channel of
next links in the route. This update cannot use the recent
measured powers received from the sensing module of the
cognitive radio since the transmission is not yet started. The
deployment of a procedure that updates the maximum power
during route construction is challenging and increases the
complexity of the route establishment especially that it would
require message exchange between CR nodes and distributed
power computations. However, in our case, channels with
higher maximum power are chosen ﬁrst, which reduces the
probability of violating the interference condition if more than
one CR node use the same channel in the route. Practically,
this will not affect PR activity but establishes a route where
some CR nodes will not be able to transmit as predicted.
Designing a lightweight procedure to update the maximum
power dynamically is one of our future work.

V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A. Metrics Validation
Before simulating the whole routing procedure, we ﬁrst
validate the effectiveness of using the fuzzy logic within the
proposed metrics. Since our proposed metrics are based on IF-
THEN rules and not on mathematical equations, we show how
these metrics change with the variation of the FLCs inputs. We
consider here a simple one hop network since the objective
is to show that the developed metrics capture efﬁciently the
cognitive radio environment. All simulations were conducted
using MATLAB.
Figure 7(a) represents how the output of the FLC2
(FinalPredictedPower) changes as a function of its two
inputs (PP redicted and β). It is clear that the Final Predicted
Power is proportional to the PP redicted obtained through
the prediction operation. However, if a CR node compares
between two channels, the channel that has the highest value
of PP redicted is not always selected. For instance, if two
channels have close values of PP redicted, a CR node chooses
the channel which has the lowest value of β. In other words,
the chosen channel is the one whose operation of prediction
gives the highest level of conﬁdence. Such result cannot be
obtained through the classical PP redicted − β function.

dicted Power and prediction error

Stability and Final Predicted Power
Fig. 7.
Stability and power estimation validation
Figure 7(b) shows how the channel grade varies based
on the stability and the FinalPredictedPower. Note that
if the stability is very low, the channel grade is also low
regardless of the FinalPredictedPower value. However, if
the stability is high, the channel grade switches between
very high and very low levels and it is highly dependent
on the FinalPredictedPower. The two previously obtained
results typically express the relation between the stability
and the FinalPredictedPower. In fact, a stable channel
should be selected based on the FinalPredictedPower since
the current state of the channel will mostly continue in the
future for a signiﬁcant period of the time. On the other
hand, an unstable channel will probably switch several times
between availability and unavailability during a short period,
and then the impact of the current state on channel selection is
widely reduced. It is also remarkable that during unavailability
periods, an unstable channel is preferred over a stable one
since the former allows starting the transmission faster than
the latter one and provides at least some throughput guarantee
even with intermittent connectivity. This example shows again
the ﬂexibility provided by the fuzzy logic to control carefully
the channel selection. Such ﬁgure cannot be obtained using a
traditional weighted sum equation.
B. Routes Construction Simulations
In order to simulate the routing procedure, we use 64 nodes
placed in a grid topology (Figure 8). The source node is
the node placed in the top left corner of the grid while the
destination node is the one placed in the bottom right corner.
There are 6 licensed channels between every two nodes. For
all the simulations, all channels have 50% availability ratio in
the long term. We simulate three types of channel models
corresponding to different degrees of stability. These types
are placed in the network in order to creates three regions
of channels as shown in Figure 8. The channels of the bottom
region behave following a high stability scheme, channels of
the top region behave as a low stability scheme whereas the
channels of the middle region behave as a medium stability
scheme. Schemes are similar to Figures 1 and 2 and they
are created randomly. This conﬁguration will show clearly
how routes are chosen through different links with different
conditions.
Fig. 8.
Simulated network topology
First, we run the routing algorithm to ﬁnd the best route
from the source to the destination. Figure 9(a) shows the
route constructed through links with highest grades. It also
highlights that the number of hops is considered in the route
construction, for this reason the route is close to the moderate
stability region. Hence, the chosen route is a good tradeoff
between the quality of links and the route hop count.
Second, we continue running the algorithm between the
same source and the same destination but for new connections
up to 9 routes which is the maximum possible in this topology.
We repeat this operation several times while varying randomly
and uniformly the starting time of each route establishment.
The obtained routes can be categorized into two types. Exam-
ples of these successive routes are shown in Figures 9 and 10.
In Figure 9, we notice that the ﬁrst four constructed routes
are in the bottom region of the topology where the stability is
higher, routes 5, 6, and 7 are hybrid between the higher and
the moderate stability region, and ﬁnally the last two routes
are totally in the lower stability region. This types of routes
looks indeed intuitive and validates the routing algorithm in
contrast to the second type shown in Figure 10.
In Figure 10, we highlight a different scenario observed
during our simulations. In some cases, the ﬁrst established
routes in the network start surprisingly from the unstable

The case where the ﬁrst constructed routes start from the low stability region of the network
region and they ﬁnish in the stable one. In fact, the routes with
stable channels have very low grades when the predicted power
is low and/or β is high. These routes were indeed established
when the ﬁnal predicted allowed power is too low or does
not allow transmission. Although the unstable links have low
grades, these grades are still greater than the grades of stable
ones during periods where the channels are not really available
for transmission. Here, among bad quality routes, our strategy
selects the less worse one.
VI. RELATED WORK
Some routing techniques for cognitive radio networks were
proposed in the literature. Sharma et al. proposed in [7] a way
to integrate the interference temperature into routing decisions.
Routing metrics are combined using a simple weighted sum.
Yet, this way is not ﬂexible enough and it was not evaluated
by simulation or models. Akyildiz et al. proposed in [3]
STOD-RP an on-demand routing protocol based on clustering
approach. In STOD-RP, a single channel is used within each
cluster and a recovery mechanism is provided to tolerate
spectrum loss. However, the throughput is much reduced
within each cluster and the cluster heads become quickly
bottleneck links. A new routing metric was proposed in [8]
based on a probabilistic deﬁnition of the available capacity of
channels in order to ﬁnd the route with the higher probability
of availability. After the route establishment, new channels are
added until the throughput demand is satisﬁed. Probabilistic
throughput computation is adequate to increase the long term
availability but it may not be adapted for short connections.
In [9], a new routing scheme was proposed in order to
reduce the power consumption. This usually leads to select
the nearest neighboring node, and then the number of hops
in the route is signiﬁcantly increased. Authors in [4] present
SAMER a new routing scheme to provide a tradeoff between
the local spectrum conditions at the forwarding nodes and the
global spectrum view of the entire routing path. However,
the complex distribution of channels availability is simply
presented by a general average of availability.
Our work differs from previous proposals in two aspects:
First, by presenting a new ﬂexible and efﬁcient way to
combine routing metrics in cognitive radio networks. Second,
by proposing new routing metrics able to capture the uncertain,
dynamic and sporadic availability of licensed bands.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper proposes a new routing approach for multihop
cognitive radio networks based on the sporadic availability of
channels. Two routing metrics are deﬁned based on the power
allocation at cognitive radio nodes. These metrics are com-
puted and combined using the fuzzy logic theory. Numerical
analysis and simulations show that our routing procedure is
able to exploit adequately all types of channels whenever there
are available spaces. The established routes achieve a good
tradeoff between availability, transmission ability and stability.
Based on our results, further investigations can be made
including especially experimenting other fuzzy rules that can
be tuned for speciﬁc application requirements. It is also
interesting to estimate the beneﬁt from designing a distributed
update of the maximum allowed power during the construction
of the route.
