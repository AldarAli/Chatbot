Abstract—A virtual Geo-Sensor is a software module with as-
sociated geo coordinates which recognizes the physical pres-
ence of traceable mobile devices within a distinct interaction 
radius. At spatial proximity of an authorized device the Geo-
Sensor automatically triggers electronically controlled actions 
(e.g., it opens gates, starts or stops engines, etc.) not distracting 
its users from their focused task by making them press buttons 
or glimpse at a display. This basic paradigm can be adopted 
for improving logistics processes inside premises, e.g., for sup-
porting the unloading task of trucks from various suppliers. At 
every unloading site within a closed compound a virtual Geo-
Sensor recognizes the arrival of trucks, detects congestion and 
automatically initiates re-routing procedures which are relayed 
to the drivers via a network of mobile devices carried within 
the trucks. This paper sketches the principles and the architec-
ture of virtual Geo-Sensors and demonstrates their potentials 
in logistics fields in the frame of an experimental survey at the 
MAN truck manufacturing site in Steyr, Austria.

 INTRODUCTION 
The improvement of supply chain event management in 
logistics domains utilizing new tracking and tracing technol-
ogies has been recognized as a key aspect for modern loca-
tion- and context-based services. The benefit of knowing the 
live-position of delivered consignment is apparent for sup-
plier and customer enabling them to carry out precise and 
concerted (pre-)calculations on the event chain with a sup-
posed positive impact in terms of processing time and costs 
[20][24].  
The technical prerequisites for implementing such a ser-
vice are no longer considered an obstacle, nowadays. It is 
more an issue in terms of organization, law and work coun-
cils when numerous involved suppliers should participate in 
a multilateral transparent delivery process outside company 
borders. However, the potentials in utilizing location-based 
information for logistics fields cannot only be found in time 
extrapolations for arriving freight from different suppliers. 
The potentials can also be exploited within compound bor-
ders where a passed transitional liability grants more legal 
freedom of action to the compound carrier. 
In the course of the nationally funded research program 
AGTIL [19] focusing on adaptive value creation by the 
means of the integration of technological, sociological and 
logistical issues the project consortium consisting of the 
University of Linz, the Upper Austrian University of Applied 
Sciences (Logistikum) and MAN Nutzfahrzeuge (truck man-
ufacturer) in Steyr, Austria, envision a mobile location-based 
compound logistics system for controlling and accelerating 
the unloading process of delivered consignment within yard 
borders.  
The technical approach for the vision is based on the use 
of an existing location-based service for mobile devices de-
veloped in the course of a research-cooperation between the 
University of Linz, Siemens Corporate Technology and the 
Ars Electronica Futurelab. The service is called “Digital 
Graffiti” [16][18] and is considered a social communication-, 
collaboration-, and interaction platform where arbitrary users 
are capable of observing their “friends”’ residences in near 
real-time (their revocable permission provided) and of con-
suming and placing location-bound information using their 
mobile phones. The novelty in this service is included in the 
type of information that can be placed: information does not 
only contain static data like text or pictures, it also encloses 
code fragments or triggers to external services which will 
automatically be executed when the appropriate privileged 
user reaches regional closeness to this information (virtual 
Geo-Sensor [17]). 
Upon the technological core of Digital Graffiti the 
AGTIL project consortium has developed a service infra-
structure for a mobile compound logistics system. The mov-
ing entities (trucks and their drivers) are identified and 
tracked by mobile devices. The cargo is modeled as a dy-
namic part of the driver’s personal user profile enabling a 
clear mapping of freight, driver and truck. Individually ad-
justable access- and visibility privileges guarantee privacy 
protection on a technical basis leaving legal privacy concerns 
up to negotiations among the participating parties. The con-
trol mechanism in this system is built upon the Geo-Sensors 
placed at all unloading sites and at neuralgic positions along 
the compound road network automatically announcing e.g., 
the arrival of trucks and re-calculating site stopover se-
quences on delays.

RELATED WORK 
The combination of methods, technology and available 
information of location-based services and the dynamics of 
logistics domains has been a focal point of investigation 
since the emergence of (mobile) tracking devices capable of 
wirelessly transmitting data [29][30][31]. Various publica-
tions present design issues for logistics systems considering 
location-, context-, and situation-awareness [21][22] for op-

timizing logistics processes through real-time vehicle routing 
and mobile technologies [23]. Many of them address the 
problem of cooperating different carriers within the supply 
chain and offer mathematical solutions based on location-
bound information. They hardly address closed logistics op-
timizations based on mobile platforms within compound 
barriers. 
Considering the technical basis of our proposed service 
(the Digital Graffiti system) we realize location-based ser-
vices as an emerging focal point of investigation for an in-
creasing number of research labs and industry [5][6][14][15] 
[27][28]. LocatioNet [9], Mobiloco [10], Plazes [12] or So-
cialight [13] are services for mobile phones that enable users 
to get in touch with friends and/or mark real physical loca-
tions with simple electronic tags. A comparable application 
is Google Latitude [4] connecting users to their friends and 
their current place of residence and providing location-based 
information within a virtual global public information space.  
The concept of the Geo-Sensor handles the issue of 
seamless transitions between the real and the digital world 
[11] without distracting the user's attention [7]. Modern solu-
tion approaches use Near Field Communication (NFC) 
[25][26] for contactless initiated actions following the same 
objectives of dismissing the conventional display and key-
controlled interaction paradigm in order to claim a minimum 
of attention for performing an action at a place of event (e.g. 
SkiData – contactless access control in skiing areas through 
RFID). However, the disadvantage in this solution lies with-
in the fact that every location which is supposed to trigger an 
electronic action has to consider mandatory structural meas-
ures for engaging the NFC principle. Beyond, a remaining 
part of attention is still required as users are supposed to 
know the position of the NFC system and bring up the RFID 
tag or reader (depending on which part of the components 
carries the reading unit) close to the system for proper detec-
tion. Regarding the structural measures for implementing 
NFC this technology is only marginally applicable causing 
financial and environmental impairments. 
Spontaneous interaction triggered upon physical proximi-
ty was further studied in numerous works [1][2][8]. These 
approaches share the aspect that radio sensors are used to 
determine mutual proximity between smart artifacts and hu-
mans. The simplest form of smart artifacts are Smart-Its [3], 
small computing devices that can be attached unobtrusively 
to arbitrary physical objects in order to empower these with 
processing, context-awareness and communication. Smart-Its 
are designed for ad hoc data exchange among themselves in 
spatial proximity. Gellersen et al. [3] underlined the impor-
tance of awareness of the environment and of the situation 
for inferring behavior of mobile entities. 
III. 
ARCHITECTURE 
Digital Graffiti as the technological basis is conceived as 
a platform to manage and visualize location-based informa-
tion within the context of a mobile user. It is built upon a 
flexible network of mobile GPS-enabled devices (i.e., mobile 
phones, PDAs, netbooks, etc.) wirelessly obtaining and stor-
ing location-based information from and to a central server 
system (see Figure 1). 
 
Figure 1.  Digital Graffiti System Components. 
It has been enhanced with functionality to fulfill the de-
mands for a social network, comprises a map server (e.g., for 
custom floor plans or industry areas), provides an elaborated 
user and privileges management concept and additionally 
handles chat messaging and communication encryption for 
secure data transfer.  
The clients are supposed to be executed on any mobile 
platform either as a native application particularly designed 
for the device (currently available for iOS, Android, Sym-
bian and Windows) or as a web application (utilizing the 
novel W3C standard and HTML5 for accessing GPS out of a 
browser and complying with the requirements of a bare de-
vice without the needs of installing client software).  
Once registered and logged in, the user is visualized as an 
avatar at his exact residing position in front of a map (see 
Figure 2) and his geographical position is textually resolved 
into a human readable address (e.g., building names, floor 
descriptions or office numbers). Alongside user’s own posi-
tion the system also offers to track the position of the user’s 
friends, provided that the respective friend has granted per-
mission. To sustain privacy this permission can be revoked 
by one click in the user interface. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  Digital Graffiti User Interface. 
Similar to conventional cellular telephony the system 
uses a distributed provider model for the server-side compo-
nent where users all over the world can join the provider of 
their choice in order to take part in the mobile location-based 
information service. This proven model distributes the load 
from (asynchronously) communicating users and guarantees 
scalability of the service all over the world as each provider 
only handles a limited number of clients.

Every provider stores a set of geographically linked in-
formation in appropriate fast traversable geo-data structures 
(e.g., r-trees) containing hierarchically combinable content 
modules (which we call gadgets) for text, pictures videos, 
sound, etc. The name gadget already refers to a possible ac-
tivity within a module and is the key for a generic approach 
of integrating arbitrary system connections or electronic ac-
tions to be triggered automatically on arriving users (Geo-
Sensors). They provide the basis for extensibility to third-
party systems for which the number and variety of electronic 
connections is unforeseeable and simultaneously enriches the 
potentials of such a service [18]. Figure 3 illustrates the 
common principles of the Geo-Sensor architecture which 
enables fast connections to third party systems: 
 
 
Figure 3.  Geo-Sensor Architecture. 
Clients repetitively transmit their own (commonly GPS-
based) position to a server (1), which evaluates the geo-data 
considering visibility radiuses and access constraints (2) and 
transmits the corresponding results back to the clients (3). 
Generally, when the transmitted information contains con-
ventional gadgets as text and pictures, it is immediately dis-
played on the output device of the client (4). The basic idea 
for executing code is to use the gadget metaphor and store 
executable code inside instead of text or binary picture data 
(smart gadgets). Therefore, we propose a web-service-based 
mechanism which is both effective and simple to extend: 
Smart gadgets contain a simple URL or XML-based web-
request to a remote web-service which is the actual compo-
nent to execute the code. When a client receives information 
containing a smart gadget, its URL is resolved (5) which is 
handled internally (6) and finally triggers the desired action 
at the third-party vendor (7). A response back to the client (8, 
9) can additionally be illustrated as a visual confirmation 
whether the action could have been executed or not (10). 
 
 
Figure 4.  Geo-Sensor Example using Digital Graffiti. 
This approach is simple because the clients just have to 
handle standardized web-requests. A majority of currently 
utilized mobile platforms support these mechanisms. Impor-
tant for third-party vendors: Their internal data representa-
tions, servers and control units are hidden from the publically 
accessible location-based service guaranteeing a maximum 
degree of data security for the vendors. 
Figure 4 gives an impression on this innovative interac-
tion paradigm: We have put a Geo-Sensor containing ex-
ecutable code near the Ars Electronica Center building in 
Linz, the LED-facade of which is capable of displaying mar-
quee text running around the walls of the building. An autho-
rized person approaching the Geo-Sensor automatically trig-
gers the execution of the contained code which causes the 
facade to welcome the user personally. Of course, this appli-
cation is more of a playful approach rather than a business 
scenario, however, it demonstrates the potentials of the ser-
vice enabling its users to initiate any electronically controlla-
ble action just by their physical presence. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Geo-Sensor Types. 
For even more flexibility the Digital Graffiti framework 
provides a series of differently triggering Geo-Sensors (see 
Figure 5) an application can select from in order to meet its 
particular requirements best possible: The simplest forms are 
Entry- and Exit-Sensors firing when a device either comes 
into or leaves the interaction radius of the sensor. A Single-
Transit-Sensor defines a virtual line within its radius which 
must be passed from one direction in order to trigger it. Sen-
sors of this type may be used in traffic scenarios where just 
the flow of a distinct direction is of interest. An extension of 
this sensor is the Double-Transit-Sensor firing twice at the 
entry and exit of a device from a given direction. Sensors of 
this type may e.g., detect congestion. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL SURVEY 
A Double-Transit-Sensor also recognizes the stopping 
times of every truck in the course of an experimental survey 
at the MAN truck manufacturing site in Steyr, Austria, where 
the unloading process of consignment should be ameliorated 
within compound borders using the location-based Digital 
Graffiti service. At every unloading site such a sensor both 
records arriving as well as the departure times and reports 
potential congestion to a control center where re-routing pro-
cedures can be initiated for further trucks scheduled for a 
congested site. Re-routing can both be done manually due to 
a visual impression of capacity utilization on the compound 
or automatically considering dynamically adjustable con-
straints like unloading sequences.

Figure 6.  Geo-Sensors at 25 Unloading Sites at MAN Steyr. 
Figure 6 gives an impression on the setup of the survey 
with in total 25 Double-Transit-Sensors at unloading sites 
(marked by green, yellow, red and blue dots) and several 
other Geo-Sensors at strategic points in the compound (e.g., 
at the two main entries or at the trailer yard where arriving 
drivers have to register and deposit their papers. 
The test scenario works as follows: When the driver ar-
rives at the trailer yard he is handed out a mobile device 
clearly identifying the truck and its cargo. A preceding regis-
tration click has been carried out by the operator connecting 
cargo data and device. Now the device provides tracking 
information to the control center and informs the drivers 
about the succeeding unloading site. At changes the operator 
is able to address an alternative destination directly to the 
appropriate driver and is therefore given a powerful instru-
ment to dynamically interfere into compound processes. 
The system architecture for this experimental survey (see 
Figure 7) contains an original unchanged Digital Graffiti 
kernel managing mobile users and Geo-Sensors (i.e., LBS 
data). It is controlled by a wrapping web-based Control Cen-
ter, the actual application core handling unloading sequences 
or re-routing procedures. Proprietary cargo data (hosted at a 
special server system at MAN) is transferred via EDI (Elec-
tronic Data Interchange) interfaces to a temporary OFTP-
server from where it is pushed to the Control Center. 
 
 
Figure 7.  System Architecture of Experimental Survey at MAN Steyr. 
 
Figure 8.  Compound System: Driver’s Client. 
Figure 8 shows the prototype mobile client application 
for the drivers (here: running on a Samsung 7” tablet with 
Android 2.2 mounted inside the windshield of a truck) 
which indicates the driver’s own position on a detailed 
compound map, his next goal (here: unloading site “22E”) 
and the route to it. 
In the first test phase the technical requirements concern-
ing feasibility, accuracy and real-time behavior have been 
evaluated: Is the compound system using Geo-Sensors ca-
pable and accurate enough to recognize waiting times in 
appropriate time intervals? Therefore, a number of selected 
trucks have carried mobile devices during their regular un-
loading process. The Geo-Sensors at the unloading sites 
have recorded all timestamps regarding entry- and exit times 
which have been cross-checked by manually noted time-
stamps of accompanying supervising persons.  
As the assessment of this technical precondition suc-
ceeded (i.e., there is a clear correspondence between ma-
nually and automatically recorded timestamps) the second 
test phase could be initiated evaluating the economic poten-
tials concerning time savings. In its final state this survey 
phase schedules for a compound-wide test with mobile de-
vices in every truck and an automatic re-routing process due 
to detected delays. As such a test scenario is both expensive 
and organizationally elaborate (about 150 trucks arrive at 
the compound during the day with a maximum number of 
40 trucks residing concurrently inside premises) only a 
light-weight version of this test has been carried out at this 
time of writing with an assortment of both manually and 
automatically recorded timestamps and a manual interfe-
rence of an expert operator due to visually recognized im-
pairments in the speed of the unloading processes. However, 
these data already reveal the economic potentials of this 
system in terms of reducing stopover times for individual 
trucks. 
V. 
PRELIMINARY RESULTS 
Figure 9 illustrates a glimpse on these data showing pre-
liminary results of the system tests. The picture lists operat-
ing times for one specific test day on November 22nd 2011 at 
seven unloading sites (named “22A”, “22B”, “56”, etc.) at 
the yard of MAN Steyr for 71 trucks and 112 unloading tasks 
performed by these trucks. So, the picture presents time mea-
surements on site level, not for individual trucks (i.e., several 
trucks are listed more than once in this picture).

Figure 9.  Recorded Timestamps at Unloading Sites. 
The red lines indicate waiting times and the gray lines the 
time for the unloading process itself. In total figures this 
means that the drivers spend 45.6 hours waiting and 50.7 
hours for the unloading tasks (or: approx. 25 minutes at 
every site for each driver waiting and half an hour unload-
ing), which reveals nearly half of the time spent waiting. 
Thus, the theoretical potential considering these figures is an 
average reduction of unloading times by half.

Figure 10.  Re-Routing due to Congestion. 
A closer look on the figures shows (see Figure 10) that 
the truck marked in yellow faces congestion at site 22A, 
whereas site 47 would be clear at the same time. It could be 
rerouted in order to switch the unloading sequence (assum-
ing that the order is variable what might not always be the 
case) and in addition avoid a second recorded congestion 
later at site 47. This example results in a time improvement 
of 40% for this individual truck (before: 75 min waiting 
time, after: 45 min) and impressively demonstrates the po-
tentials. However, it is still an excerpt for one individual 
entity and does not consider side effects which will likely 
occur on re-routing instructions, thus only an area-wide test 
which is still to be conducted will provide a clearer insight 
into the contingent average value of improvement. 
The tests have also provided valuable information con-
cerning social issues: Whereas drivers unaware of the re-
gional conditions embrace a mobile guide escorting them 
through the compound there are more than half of the drivers 
who repetitively come along and refuse an additional gadget 
providing them with information they know anyway. 
 
  
 
Figure 11.  User-Interface Adaptations. 
As a consequence, we have modified the user interface 
for the mobile device in a way that it does not show a map 
with one’s own position on it, anymore. Instead, we utilize 
the local direction signs and appropriately display them on 
the screen (see Figure 11). Drivers unfamiliar with the place 
are still guided by the system whereas the others may keep 
their devices in their pockets (not perceiving well-known 
information) but are also notified on re-routings by an acous-
tic alarm and a firm depiction of the change. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Although, the system presented in this paper is still under 
development first prototypical implementations and tests 
confirm applicability of the virtual Geo-Sensor metaphor for 
being used for closed compound logistics operations. The 
project consortium is convinced that Geo-Sensors offer large 
potentials in terms of reducing congestion times while carry-
ing out in-yard tasks. At every unloading site a virtual Geo-
Sensor detects the presence of trucks and automatically noti-
fies and re-routes on delays. 
For verifying the supposed economic potentials further 
tests within the compound of MAN in Steyr are still neces-
sary. Every truck driver will have to carry a mobile device

and is requested to follow re-routing instructions relayed by 
the mobile device in order to create a quantifiable statement 
considering side effects of this dynamic interference. The 
final goal will be a downloadable mobile app to be installed 
by the participating parties in order to avoid registration rou-
tines at the entry gates with benefits for both sides regarding 
an improved use of their resources.
