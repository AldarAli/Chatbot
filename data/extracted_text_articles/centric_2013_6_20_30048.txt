Abstract—The application of gesture changed the mobile 
interactive process greatly, as well as User Experience (UE). 
For better UE, it requires information feedback triggered by 
gesture to accord with users’ cognition, which is closely related 
to their culture and values. Many previous studies have 
described the differences of interaction under diverse cultural 
atmospheres, which confirms that cultural factors do affect the 
interaction process, but does this also hold for mobiles? 
Whether the UE is good? This study carries out a series of 
empirical research towards this end. The task flow of 20 apps 
based on Android was analyzed for extraction of gestures used 
with higher frequency. The ink-rhyme effect of Chinese 
calligraphy culture was integrated into interactive feedback to 
form gradient mode, which is applied to the three most 
familiar gestures to users— tap, press, slide. The participants 
judged the mode based on Hassenzahl’s surface usability 
questionnaire to assess UE. The results showed that cultural 
factors improve the user's emotional experience, but have little 
impact on the operating experience. It is demonstrated that the 
integration of cultural factors enhances UE, especially 
emotional experience, and shows no negative impact on 
usability.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Gestures based on touch screen help people get rid of the 
dependence on traditional input device. They shorten 
distance between people and equipment, enrich the pleasure 
of interactions and enhance users’ satisfaction. All of these 
provide infinite advantage for gesture interaction [1][2]. 
However, damage caused by improper cognition and 
recognition of gesture in practice will upset users. 
The feedback activated by gestures needs users’ rational 
cognition. In order to understand feedback mode better, 
cultural and value recognition from users are of great 
importance [1]. In a way, culture can be understood as the 
medium and tool used to think, work, and study [3]. Many 
studies have shown that selection, receiving and cognition of 
information will be affected due to different cultural 
backgrounds. Thus, the integration of culture and interactive 
system is very necessary [4]. However, what forms the 
culture will be absorbed, and whether it has positive 
influence on UE, are still problems that worth exploring. 
In order to further develop our investigation, the 
following research questions should be taken into account: i) 
How to choose the object of study in a wide variety of 
gestures? To answer this first question, the research of 20 
apps based on Android helped extract the typical gestures. ii) 
Which kind of form will cultural factors be blended into 
interaction? In this part of study, one of the representative of 
traditional Chinese culture — calligraphy was used as 
research object. The reason why we did not chose other 
cultural category is that we know it better than other items 
among countless cultural items. iii) How to evaluate the UE 
of interactive system integrated with cultural factors? In 
older to answer the third question, Hassenzahl’s surface 
usability questionnaire based on semantic scale was used to 
identify the UE [5]. 
The study reveals the relationship between feedback 
merged with culture elements and UE. It showed that better 
emotional experience was produced by cultural feedback, 
such as excitement, fun and deep impression. On the other 
hand, there was no much impact on operational experience, 
but a bit of cognitive burden for users. 
Section 2 of this present study carried out detailed 
induction and analysis of previous related research, which 
provided 
instructional 
method 
for 
the 
subsequent 
experiments. In Section 3, 20 apps were used to extract 
typical gestures used in higher frequency. The ink-rhyme 
effect of Chinese calligraphy culture developed into two 
different modes in Section 4. Through the experiment of the 
fourth section, we understand the relationships between 
cultural factors and UE of interactive system. Combined with 
the discussion about the UE in Section 5, the conclusion 
showed that culture factors had a positive impact on 
emotional experience, but added a certain cognitive burden 
to users.

RELATED WORK 
A. Gesture Interaction 
Touch gestures are considered to be the most direct way 
of human-computer interaction [6]; they have convenient 
way to input, and reflect abundant semantics [7]. Currently, 
gestures based on the mobile platform can be subdivided into 
multi-touch gestures, stroke gestures, and combinational 
gestures. Even if multi-touch gestures produce an advantage 
as being more mature, they have not fully realized in 
112

mainstream platforms, except operations related to rotation 
and scaling [1][8]. Multi-touch gestures, as they were, are 
mostly applied to a mobile platform, but have no unified 
standard. Previous Studies have pointed out that, integrating 
concepts of time and displacement, gesture can be reduced to 
action unit, which will converse into a basic set of gestures 
specific to whole system [9]. This research provides basis 
and reference for extraction of typical gesture based on 
mobile platforms. 
B. Cultural Factors in Interaction 
The effect of culture on interaction has been confirmed 
by many research institutes [10][34][35], e.g., in image 
search task, Chinese are more likely to generate search 
keywords describing the overall properties of the target 
images than European and Americans (EA); EA assigns 
more space to the main objects than Chinese [10]. However, 
how to blend culture factors with interactive system still 
needs further discussion. Chi-Hsiung Chen and his 
colleagues, scholars from Taiwan, suggested that culture 
reflected on three levels: surface layer (visual and material), 
middle layer (behavior and habits) and inner layer (thoughts 
and spirit) [11]. In 1993, Ockman proposed the fusion point 
of culture and design relied on users’ tastes, habits and 
lifestyles [12]. Tien-Li Chen and Pei-Fen Hong also pointed 
out those cultural images can be divided into two directions, 
namely, implicit and explicit [13]. Thus the integration of 
culture and design is from the inside to the outside. It is 
user-oriented and should consider users’ behavior and habits 
in some kind of conditions, through direct or indirect sensory 
effects. Then it is showed through the sensory effects directly 
or indirectly. 
Chinese aesthetic culture represented by the calligraphy 
is becoming a new source of design inspiration [14], the 
simulation technology of calligraphy effect has been the 
subject of many studies [15][16][17]. Imitations of 
calligraphy brush strokes; however, it is a kind of retrieving 
of outer appearance shape, which is in lack of behavioral 
interpretation for calligraphy culture. Calligraphists will 
strengthen the tendency of their creatures by controlling the 
ink-rhyme [18]. Ink-rhyme is an extremely subtle factor in 
calligraphy art, but also is directly controlled by the behavior. 
Taking ink-rhyme effect as a breakthrough point of culture 
and interactive systems, in conjunction with other conditions, 
is likely to promote re-creation of artistic context and UE. 
C. User Experience 
UE is related with the process of interaction, it is a 
combination of user’s behavior, results and emotion [19]. 
UE take emotion experience as more advanced level, 
including hedonics, aesthetic and pleasure [5][20]. Sascha 
Mahlke from Industrial University of Berlin thought UE 
could be defined from four dimensions: perceived 
usefulness, ease of use, perceived hedonic quality, perceived 
visual attractiveness [21]. UE, therefore, is a process of 
focus on cognition and feelings, based on usability and 
affection. However, there still exists a question whether 
cultural factors have a positive effect on UE.

STUDY 1: TYPICAL GESTURE EXTRACTION 
The purpose of this study was to extract typical one in a 
wide variety of gestures used in mobile terminal. The 
intention is to take gestures that users are most familiar with 
as variables for further research. 
A. Material 
We used 20 apps based on Android. According to the 
report that Linda Sui published in Strategy Analytics, which 
can be found at [28], there were 530000 smartphones 
supplied in the fourth quarter of 2012, 86% of which were 
based on Android. The selection of study platform was 
strongly supported, because the vast majority of the Chinese 
smartphone users were more familiar with Android. The 
apps were the top 20 selected from list at the end of May of 
Peasecod [29], which was reported to occupy more than 50% 
of mobile apps management market [30]. Table 1 contains 
the selected apps and games, together with their study IDs 
and times of installation.

B. Variable identification 
In order to understand how gestures operate on an 
interactive system of smartphones, each of the stimuli used 
for the evaluation was identified. Table 2 contains definition 
and legend of the gestures, which could be consulted in the 
touch gesture reference guide provided by Luke Wroblewski 
[31].

C. Task and Paocedure 
Firstly, these 20 apps and games were underway of the 
task flow analysis. After separating the function module of 
each app, every step of the task was refined to single 
gesture’s application, and marked with circle standing for 
the gesture ID. Take Tecent QQ [32] as the example: to 
enter the application, users first need to tap the icon to login, 
then tap their account and password to input box. After 
tapping “OK”, user will come to QQ’s message function 
module to continue their operation. From such a short task 
flow, it can be seen that the completion of this task requires 
at least four taps. Figure 1 shows task flow analysis of QQ 
on a wider scale. Corresponding to the analysis, type and 
frequency of gestures used in QQ are counted in Table 3. 
For the sake of an overall understanding of the whole 
situation, gesture analysis can be applied to the rest of apps 
in the same way.

D. Result 
All of the 20 apps were analyzed in the method shown in 
last part, the results were shown in Table 4. 
According to the frequency statistics, "tap" was at the 
highest frequency. The rest of the top four gestures were 
“slide” (M = 7.2, SD = 2.936), “press” (M = 2.3, SD = 
1.567), “drag” (M = 0.2, SD = 0.632). Among them, “tap” 
was the most favorite gesture with users, as the use of which 
was far more than other gestures. “Drag” was unusual 
gesture with the same level of “zoom” and “double tap”. 
“Rotate”, “press and slide”, while “press and tap” were 
barely used in smartphone based on Android.

The results may be due to the following points: i) The 
hardware limitations, e.g., the size of the screen limits the 
operations by two or more fingers, because of bad usability. 
It is proven in this view that some apps, like Meitu [33] use 
combination of tap and slide instead of rotation or zooming. 
ii) The standard of gesture design is faultiness. It will be 
easy to be accepted if the design meets users’ mental model 
and daily habits [1]. Intensive mapping is generated between 
gestures and computer mouse: the function of tap is similar 
with the left mouse button and press likes the right button. 
In summary, we took “tap”, “press”, and “slide” as 
stimuli in Study 2 to explore cultural factors effects on 
interactive UE. 
IV. 
STUDY 2: CULTURE FACTORS AND USER 
EXPERIENCE 
The purpose of Study 2 is to investigate the impacts of 
two different feedback models on UE. 
A. Participants 
40 participants, 20 males and 20 females were involved 
in this study. Two persons (males) gave invalid responses. 
Therefore, there were 38 valid responses from participants 
aged ranging from 20 to 34 years old. Thirty one (31) were 
undergraduate and postgraduate students from department 
of industrial design, while four were professionals with 
education, logistics and engineering. All of them were 
skilled users of Android and influenced by Chinese culture 
since childhood. 
B. Stimuli 
There were three experiments based on tap, press and 
slide, while included two contrast feedbacks in each group 
114

experiment. The independent variables were different 
feedback modes: gradient mode and flat mode. Gradient 
mode was dynamical feedback for integrating with 
ink–rhyme effect. Flat mode was a kind of feedback that 
responded directly after users’ action. 
The dependent variable was UE, which was measured 
by surface usability questionnaire. In previous studies, 
surface usability was gained through semantic scale. This 
method was developed by Hassenzahl in 7 aspects: 
intelligibility, 
predictability, 
clarity, 
dependability, 
controllability, familiarity [22]. In fact, emotion was also an 
important factor that affected UE, such as pleasure, 
innovation, impression and fun. Taking all of these into 
account, 11 items would be used to measure. 
The dependent variable would be influenced by plenty 
of other aspects. In this experiment, interfacial elements, 
interactive action, results of feedback were all the same, to 
shield the UE differences caused by them. Thus, feedback 
mode could be regarded as the main reason for perceptive 
diversity. 
C. Material 
Materials were three groups including six interfaces 
designed on independent variables and controlled variables. 
Each interface corresponded to one feedback mode. 
Experiments were performed on the same mobile phone, 
with 4.3 inch IPS screen, which had a resolution of 1280 * 
720 pixels, 342 ppi per inch. 
D. Task and Procedure 
Participants were first made to read an information sheet 
outlining the aim of the study. By agreeing to participate, a 
demographic form was filled. The main study was 
conducted in the second part. In this part, participants 
needed to enter the Task 1 according to the cue on the 
interface, tap the number “1” that appeared randomly on the 
screen. By this time, the background of the number changed 
from 10% black to 60% black directly. This task was 
repeated 10 times, in order to deepen the experience of 
feedback. When Task 1 was finished, participants had to 
give a ranking score on printed questionnaire for the 
stimulus they had just felt to its feedback effect. Task 2 was 
a contrast experiment with Task 1. The only difference 
between them was the gradient feedback mode with 
ink-rhyme effect. Task 3 and Task 4 were for “press”. The 
interface background of the former one deepened directly 
with the confirm button’s appear, tapped “OK” to go on the 
experiment. The latter one inherited from the gradient mode. 
In sliding experiments, the sequence of "1-2-3-4-5" 
appeared randomly, which required participants to connect 
numbers in sequence. Feedback modes of Task 5 and Task 6 
were flat and gradient feedback. 
In order to exclude the influence caused by position and 
order, controls and tasks appeared randomly in the 
experiment. 
E. Results 
Measure of concentricity and difference tendency were 
used here to analyze the general level and discrete case 
dependent variable. Table 5 was the results of the dependent 
variable descriptive statistics from UE experiment. It 
revealed that the experience of gradient was significantly 
higher than flat’s for the average level of innovation, 
excitement, impression, fun had clear differences between 
different feedback models. In addition, “press” task was 
showed stronger sense of operation from gradient feedback, 
which was not familiar with the users yet. Flat feedback of 
“slide” task seemed not easy to understand. As a whole, the 
variance of flat feedback being higher than gradient’s, 
indicated that users’ understanding of experience of gradient 
mode tended to be consistent.

Although the 11 items covered nearly all aspects of the 
UE, they were likely to have ranging overlap. Consequently, 
principal component analysis was applied to extract factors 
from three sets of data. Expression of principal component 
was obtained after rotation of Varimax with Kaiser 
Normalization, which is a kind of data rotation method. The 
results were as follows in Table 6. From the table, we can

know that at the tapping comparative experiments, four 
pairs of factors (innovation, excitement, impression, fun) 
had a high degree of positive correlation with Factor_1, 
which was named emotional factor as it reflected the 
emotional experience of users. Three pairs of factors 
(control, easy-operating, clean) were found to have positive 
impact on Factor 2, which mainly showed the operational 
experience. Rest of items had significantly higher load on 
Factor 3, which stood for the subjects' cognitive level. Thus 
Factor 2 and Factor 3 were named operational factor and 
cognitive factor. In comparative experiments of press and 
slide, emotional factor had similar state to experiments of 
tap, but operational and cognitive factors were not apart, 
indicating that emotional experience of subject was more 
obvious than the other two.

Combined with the results of descriptive statistics, 
emotional experience of gradient mode was clearly stronger 
than the flat one, namely, users considered gradient 
feedback more innovative and interesting, to create more 
passion and leave deeper impression. In contrast with 
experiment of tap, users thought there was no difference of 
operational and cognitive experience according to two 
feedback modes. Compared to experiment of press and slide, 
users got better cognition, but poorer operational experience 
of flat feedback than the gradient one. It is believed that the 
impact on UE of two different feedback modes was mainly 
focused on emotional experience. The gradient feedback 
improved UE to some extent, meantime, it increased users’ 
cognitive 
load, 
which 
was 
primarily 
caused 
by 
unfamiliarity. 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
The overall objective of this paper was to investigate the 
relationships between cultural factors in interactive systems 
and UE. In review of related work (Section 2), the 
application of cultural factors in design was considered as 
deep sense of users’ behavior or habits expressed by sensory 
effect directly or indirectly. In study 2 (Section 4), 
ink-rhyme effect was applied to mobile interactive feedback 
model, the results proved that interaction with cultural 
meaning feedback had an impact on the UE. On the 
emotional experience, the cultural element had a positive 
influence, but no significant improvement of operational 
experience. The application of cultural factors was so 
creative that it was unfamiliar to users, as a result, it caused 
some cognitive burden. 
UE is a complex sensory, consists of a comprehensive 
experience, which is highly susceptible to environment, 
users’ emotions and external factors. Emotional experience 
serves as one of the most important parts of UE; however, 
traditional human-computer interaction research is still 
concentrated upon functional usability [23]. With increasing 
concerns about emotional experience [24][25][26], feedback 
integrated with cultural elements has been proved to have 
better emotional experience. All of these offer much food 
for thought and different choices to designers. Combining 
cultural factors to interaction will help users to understand 
their cultural images, significance, stories and emotion [27], 
as well as usability. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, two studies were used to evaluate the 
relationships between feedback of cultural meaning and UE. 
Study 1 helped to extract typical gestures those were 
familiar to users. Study 2 was the experiment of UE 
measurement, which made us understand the complex 
relationships between feedback of cultural meaning and UE. 
The results showed that gradient mode had a positive 
correlation with emotional experience, users thought it more 
innovative and interesting in creating more passion and 
leaving deeper impression. Data also suggested that the 
integration of cultural factors did not affect the operational 
experience of interaction, but added a certain amount of 
cognitive load, which primarily caused by unfamiliarity. 
The direction of further research will focus on the 
application of ink-rhyme to practical interactive systems, 
which will be investigated in more complex interaction 
processes. We also hope to expand cultural factors to have a 
method or model to extract the elements from culture.
