Abstract- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) product 
selection can be seen as one of the most critical and difficult 
decision making stages for an organization. This research 
explores the application of a hybrid multi-criteria decision 
making (MCDM) procedure for the evaluation of various ERP 
alternatives. The proposed evaluation framework integrates 
three methodologies: Analytic Network Process (ANP), 
Choquet Integral (CI) and Measuring Attractiveness by a 
Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH). ANP 
produces the priorities of alternatives with respect to the 
interdependent evaluation criteria. The conjunctive or 
disjunctive behaviors between criteria are determined using 
MACBETH and CI. Numerical application of the proposed 
methodology is implemented on the decision making problem 
of a firm that faces with four ERP projects. The final ranking 
is compared to the one obtained by ignoring the interactions 
among criteria. The results demonstrate that the ignorance of 
the interactions may lead to erroneous decisions. 
Keywords- ERP, supplier selection, MCDM, ANP, Choquet 
Integral.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
An ERP system is a critical investment that can 
significantly 
influence 
future 
competitiveness 
and 
performance of a firm. It is increasingly important in today’s 
modern businesses because of its ability to integrate the flow 
of material, finance, and information and to support 
organizational strategies [1]. A successfully implemented 
ERP can offer organizations automating business process, 
timely access to management information and improving 
supply chain management through the use of e-commerce 
[2]. It standardizes processes and stores information as well 
as recalls that data when it is required in real time 
environment. Implementing an ERP system may be costly 
and time-consuming. Companies spend billions of dollars 
and use numerous amounts of man-hours for installing 
elaborate ERP software systems. However, the benefits of a 
successful ERP project are worthwhile. In order to 
implement an ERP software successfully, it is necessary to 
select an ERP system which can be aligned with the needs of 
the company. Thus, an efficient decision making approach 
for ERP software selection requires both company needs and 
characteristics of the ERP system and their interactions to be 
taken into account [3]. The selection process for determining 
the most appropriate ERP software among a set of possible 
alternatives in the market is a multi-criteria decision making 
problem. 
 
This paper introduces a hybrid multi criteria decision 
making (MCDM) model for ERP selection based on 
Analytic Network Process (ANP), Choquet Integral (CI) and 
Measuring 
Attractiveness 
by 
a 
Categorical 
Based 
Evaluation Technique (MACBETH). Initially, we have 
categorized ERP selection criteria into three main criteria 
set: Vendor related criteria (VRC), customer related criteria 
(CRC), and software related criteria (SRC). Each one 
consists of its own sub-criteria set. Since these sub-criteria 
and criteria have both inner and outher dependencies, we 
have made use of the ANP to determine these dependencies 
and relative priorities of all criteria. MACBETH is both an 
approach and a set of techniques that have the goal of 
providing an overall ordering of options, and that aid on the 
construction of interval numerical scales based on 
qualitative (non-numerical) pairwise comparison judgments 
[4, 5]. In this research, we have used MACHBETH and CI 
to determine conjunctive or disjunctive behaviors between 
criteria. The last phase of the proposed methodology 
involves ranking the given ERP alternatives according to 
their final performance scores. We have shown the 
feasibility of the proposed framework on the decision 
making problem of a company that needs to evaluate four 
ERP software alternatives and select the most suitable one 
according to its requirements.  
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: 
in Section 2 we give related literature. Section 3 briefly 
describes the methodologies that constitute the proposed 
framework. The steps and details of the proposed decision 
support framework and its implementation into the ERP 
selection problem is given in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 
concludes the study.

ERP software is a very serious and difficult task for a firm 
since it may cost hundreds of thousands and even millions of 
dollars. Therefore, in the academic literature there are many 
research on the selection process of ERP products. Wei et al. 
[1] have presented a comprehensive framework for selecting 
a suitable ERP system. Their selection framework is based 
on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach. Liao et al. [2] 
have presented a model which is based on linguistic 
information processing, for dealing with such a problem. 
Yazgan et al [6] have considered this selection problem as a 
multi-criteria decision making problem and they have 
integrated artificial neural network and analytic network 
process. This integration enables them to interview only one 
expert for the assessments. Karsak and Özoğul [3] have 
proposed a selection framework that enables both company 
demands and ERP system characteristics to be considered, 
and provides the means for incorporating not only the 
relationships between company demands and ERP system 
characteristics but also the interactions between ERP system 
characteristics through adopting quality function deployment 
principles. 
III. 
THE METHODS 
A. Analytic Network Process (ANP) 
ANP is a generalization of Saaty’s AHP, which is one of 
the most widely used multi-criteria decision support tools. 
AHP is limited to relatively static and unidirectional 
interactions with little feedback among decision components 
and alternatives [7]. 
Many real life decision problems cannot be structured as 
a hierarchy because of the fact that they involve the 
interaction and dependence of higher level elements in a 
hierarchy on lower level elements. So the hierarchy 
becomes more like a network. On this context, ANP and its 
supermatrix technique can be considered as an extension of 
AHP that can handle a more complex decision structure as 
the ANP framework has the flexibility to consider more 
complex 
interrelationships 
(outerdependence) 
among 
different elements [8, 9].   
AHP incorporates both qualitative and quantitative 
approaches to a decision problem [10]. It is also capable of 
capturing the tangible and intangible aspects of relative 
criteria that have some bearing on the decision making 
process, but AHP cannot deal with interconnections and 
innerdependences between decision factors in the same level 
[8]. This is because an AHP model is structured in a 
hierarchy in which no horizontal links are allowed. In other 
words, AHP can only be applied to a hierarchy that assumes 
unidirectional relation between decision levels. In fact, this 
weakness can be overcome by using the advance multi-
criteria making technique, which is ANP. So, ANP is very 
useful in these kinds of situations providing a general 
framework without the assumptions of independence of 
higher-level elements from lower ones, or independence on 
the same level [11].  
In this approach, comparison matrices, prioritization and 
the weights while considering the interdependencies are 
formed between various attributes of each level with the 
scale of 1–9 suggested by Saaty [12]. Also the consistencies 
of the pairwise comparisons, made by the experts or decision 
makers, have to be checked in order to make the necessary 
changes if there is any inconsistency above the allowed limit. 
Once the pairwise comparison matrices are formed, weighted 
vectors for all the matrices are calculated. The concept of 
supermatrix is employed to obtain the composite weights 
that 
overcome 
the 
existing 
interrelationships. 
The 
synthesizing step is to rate the alternatives according all the 
criteria, compute the overall score for the alternatives and 
make the final decision as to choose the best alternative or to 
obtain the final ranking of the alternatives. 
B. Choquet Integral (CI) 
The CI, which has been introduced in the fuzzy measure 
community by “Murofushi and Sugeno [13]” is a fuzzy 
integral proposed by “Gustave Choquet [14]” and considers 
the interactions between k out of n criteria of the problem, 
which is called the k-additivity property.  
Letting ,

 be the scores on the criteria, by 
using only the interaction index, it is possible to express CI 
in the case of 2-additive measures as follows [15]:

 and Iij, defined in the interval [-1; 1], is the 
interaction value between criteria i and j. Positive values of 
ijI  implies a conjunctive behavior between criteria i and j. 
i.e. simultaneous satisfaction of both criteria is significant 
for the global score. Negative values of 
ijI
 implies a 
disjunctive behavior between criteria i and j. i.e. the 
satisfaction of either one is sufficient to have a significant 
effect on the global score. If Iij is null, then there is no 
interaction between criteria i and j. If for all pairs of criteria, 
Iij are null then the 
i
 value acts as a weight vector in a 
weighted arithmetic mean.  
C. Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based 
Evaluation Technique (MACBETH) 
MACBETH is a multi-criteria decision analysis 
approach which has been proposed by studies of “Bana e 
65

Costa [16]”, “Bana e Costa & Vansnick [17]”, “Bana e 
Costa & Vansnick [18]”. The method requires only 
qualitative judgments about differences of value to help an 
individual or a group in quantifying the relative 
attractiveness of the elements of a finite set A and to 
associate a real number v(x) to each element x of A [19].  
Let X be the finite set of elements (alternatives) with at 
least two elements and J the group of decision makers who 
want to compare the relative attractiveness of these 
elements. Here, it is assumed that the DM or each DM is 
able to rank the elements of X either directly or through 
pairwise comparisons. Each DM is first asked to provide a 
judgment about the relative attractiveness of two elements at 
a time to retrieve the ordinal judgment. Then secondly, 
he/she is asked to provide a qualitative judgment on the 
difference of attractiveness of those two elements if they are 
not equally attractive using the following linguistic terms: 
Very weak, weak, moderate, strong, very strong and 
extreme.  
MACBETH method presents a procedure to transform 
qualitative preferences into coherent quantified elementary 
and aggregated performances. In order to solve the inter-
criteria commensurability problem, it is sufficient to 
determine, for all interval scales, two common reference 
points namely the good situation and the neutral situation 
with the performance values one and zero respectively. 
Let 
k
ip
 be the performance expression of the kth 
alternative for criterion i. Suppose the DM prefers for 
criterion i the alternative k to the alternative l and in addition 
to that information, DM will characterize the strength of his 
judgments with a level of strength that can take values from 
one to six (from the least to the most strong level) according 
to the six semantic categories of difference of attractiveness 
explained above and zero for a null strength. This level will 
be denoted with h. Therefore, if the DM prefers for criterion 
i the alternative k to the alternative l, with a strength h, then 
the following equation, where α is a coefficient necessary to 
meet the condition 
kp  and 

lp  0;1
, will be obtained:

Therefore, a preference ranking of alternatives for a 
specific criterion collected from a DM with the strength of 
the comparisons will give us a system of equation and after 
solving it the individual performance values of the 
alternatives for the criterion in question will be determined. 
In order to define CI parameters, the DM is asked to provide 
preferential information on the criteria and the couples of 
criteria including the strength of the preferences. This 
information will help us to build a system of equations with 
the Shapley and the Interaction parameters as variables. For 
the elementary performance expressions, MACBETH 
proposes to consider some particular and possibly fictive 
situations, S, in which the alternatives satisfies one criterion 
or two criteria simultaneously. A preference ranking of 
those situations collected from a DM with the strength of 
the comparisons will give us a system of equation and after 
solving it the CI parameters will be determined. 
In the situations where only one 
ip 1
 (i.e. criterion i is 
satisfied) and all others are equal to zero, the aggregated 
performance expression will be as follows (Cliville et al.

The aggregated performance expression of the situations 
where only one 
ip  0
 and all others are equal to one (i.e. 
all criteria except i is satisfied) will be as follows [5]:

where only two elementary performance expressions are

IV. 
ERP SYSTEM EVALUATION FRAMEWORK 
A. Evaluation procedure 
The evaluation procedure of this study consists of seven 
steps as follows: 
1. Identify the ERP software selection/ evaluation criteria 
that are considered the most important for the users. 
2. Once the model is built and the relations between criteria 
are defined, decide the method to use. This is not an 
arbitrary choice.   
3. If there is an outer-dependence between sub-criteria, 
then this is something to be analyzed with ANP because 
of the simple fact that CI cannot handle two elements 
that are connected to two different points. In this case, 
two sub-criteria in question belong to two different 
criteria. Hence, these dependencies will be handled with 
ANP. 
4. Analyze sub-criteria of the same cluster in order to 
define the conjunctive and disjunctive behavior between 
them. If there is such relation, use CI in order to find the 
interaction values. In case of no such interaction, handle 
the relations with ANP. 
5. After handling the sub-criteria, take in consideration the 
upper level, i.e. the criteria.   
6. A preference ranking of the criteria given by the DMs 
will define the conjunctive/disjunctive behavior between 
those. If there is not any interaction of this kind between 
criteria, then solve the model with ANP. Make the final 
aggregation and obtain a ranking.   
7. If there are conjunctive/disjunctive behavior between 
criteria, then use the Shapley indices and the interaction

values including the weights of the sub-criteria and the 
alternatives’ individual performance values for each of 
those sub-criteria in order to perform the final 
aggregation. 
B. Selection criteria 
Baki and Çakar have summarized the ERP selection 
criteria in their research after reviewing the related literature 
[21]. We have used the 16 criteria that they have proposed 
but we have grouped them under three main categories: 
vendor related, customer related and software related (Table 
1).

C. Proposed decision framework 
The hierarchical structure of the decision model of the 
paper with the alternatives and the identified criteria is 
portrayed in Fig. 4. The proposed decision model consists of 
three levels: at the highest level the objective of the problem 
is situated while in the second level, the criteria are listed. 
The lowest level belongs to the alternatives. As alternatives, 
A1, A2, A3 and A4 are selected since they are in the same 
interval of price. 
D. NUMERICAL APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED 
FRAMEWORK 
1) Part 1: ANP  
 
In the first part of the framework, pairwise comparison 
matrices for all the sub-criteria have been prepared and 
filled out by the DM. The consistency indexes of the 
matrices are all smaller than 0.10, which proves their 
consistency [12]. The pairwise comparisons enable us to 
retrieve 
relative 
weights 
for 
the 
sub-criteria. 
The 
supermatrix, which has the role of obtaining the composite 
weights, has been constructed (Table 2).

As the next step, cluster/criteria comparison matrices 
have been prepared and filled out by the DM in order to 
normalize the supermatrix (Table 2). Using the weights 
retrieved from these matrices, the cluster matrix is 
constructed and weighted supermatrix is calculated. The 
cluster matrix and the weighted supermatrix are represented 
in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively.

As the final step of ANP procedure, from the weighted 
supermatrix given in Table 4, the limit supermatrix has been 
calculated. The relative importances of the sub-criteria have 
been collected and then normalized with respect to the 
criteria (Table 5).

2) Part 2: CI 
 
In order to find out criteria weights and conjunctive/ 
disjunctive interactions between criteria, a preferential 
ranking, including the strength of the judgment, has been 
asked to the DM. The following ranking has been obtained:

Using Eq. 2-5, the resolution of this equation system has 
given the results shown in Table 6.

Table 6 shows that Vendor Related Criteria is the most 
important cluster for the DM with a relative importance (Φ1) 
of 0.4375, whereas Customer Related Criteria is the least 
important with a relative importance (Φ2) of 0.2083. 
Furthermore, it is possible to state that an employee must be 
successful on both VRC and CRC in order to be considered 
successful for the DM. The same situation is valid for CRC 
and SRC, as the interaction values (I12 and I23) are positive 
for those couples of criterion. On the other hand, there is no 
conjunctive/ disjunctive interaction between VRC and SRC 
as the interaction value for these (I13) is null.  
 
3) Part 3: Relative performance scores of alternatives 
 
For each sub-criterion, the DM has been asked to give us 
a preferential ranking, including the strength of the 
comparisons. For example, forVRC, the following ranking 
has been obtained.

Similarly, rankings for CRC and SRC has been obtained. 
The equations systems have been retrieved from these three 
preference rankings, using Eq. 2. The resolution of these 
equation systems are summarized in Table 7.

4) Part 4: Final aggregation 
 
As the last step of the proposed procedure, the scores of 
the alternatives for each criterion have been calculated 
(Table 8).  
TABLE VIII.  PERFORMANCE VALUES OF ALTERNATIVES 
WITH RESPECT TO CRITERIA.

0.5760 
0.4934 
A4 
0.4877 
0.4788 
0.4467 
 
 
In order to determine the final performance scores of 
four alternatives (Table 9), we have used the values in Table 
6 and Table 8 and Eq. 2.

The result indicates that the final performance score of 
alternative A1 is the highest (0.6867) and that of alternative 
A4 is the lowest (0.4705). The fact that VRC has the greatest 
relative importance (Φ1=0.4375) has played an important 
role for A1 and A2 to be ranked first two in the final ranking 
and for A3 and A4 to be ranked last two. Although A2 has 
greater performance values for CRC and SRC, VRC was the 
defining crieteria for A1 to be ranked first. The same 
situation is present between A3 and A4: A4 has lower 
performance values with respect to CRC and SRC and 
greater performance value with respect to VRC. However in 
this case, A3 is ranked before A4. The reason is the fact that 
the differences between performance values with respect to 
CRC and SRC for those two alternatives are greater than 
that for A1 and A2. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Enterprise resource planning is a software application 
package that integrates internal and external management 
information across an entire organization. As there are 
various ERP software product in the market, a client needs 
to choose the product that uses less resources and produces 
more output. In other words, the client needs to choose the 
most appropriate product for its own requirements.  
Our work presents a comprehensive framework for 
selecting a suitable ERP system based on an hybrid multi-
criteria decision analysis process. The procedure consists of 
three methodologies: Analytic Network Process (ANP), 
Choquet Integral (CI) and Measuring Attractiveness by a 
Categorical Based Evaluation Technique (MACBETH). We 
have illustrated the applicability of the framework through a 
case study of the ERP software selection of a company. The 
proposed decision making framework is flexible enough to 
fit other sectors with some specific characteristics changes 
and to incorporate different criteria in the evaluation 
process.
