Abstract—The inverse scattering problem of a quantum star
graph is shown to be solvable as a diagonalization problem
of Hermitian unitary matrix when the connection condition
is given by scale invariant Tsutsui-Fulop form. This enables
the construction of quantum graphs with desired properties in
tailor-made fashion. The quantum vertices with uniform and
reﬂectionless scatterings are examined, and their ﬁnite graph
approximations are constructed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The inverse scattering is one of the most intriguing problems
in quantum mechanics. The interest in the inverse scattering
problem of quantum graph [1], [2], [3], in particular, is two-
fold. Since the quantum graph is a prime example of nontrivial
solvable system [4], it presents a challenge for extending the
range of solvable inverse scattering problems. The inverse
scattering problem of quantum graph is also important for
its relevance as the design principle of nanowire-based single
electron devices.
In this article, we consider the inverse scattering problem on
a star graph with Fulop-Tsutsui vertices [5], the scale invariant
subset of most general vertex couplings [6]. A star graph is
the elementary building block of generic graph having many
half-lines connected together at a single point, the singular
vertex. The scattering matrix of star graph with Fulop-Tsutsui
condition is energy independent. We exploit this simplicity
to give the full answer to its inverse scattering problem in
the form of eigenvalue problem of Hermitian unitary matrix.
Two special examples of inverse scattering problems, that of
reﬂectionless transmission, and of equal-scattering including
the reﬂection, are examined. Intriguing designs emerge for the
realization of quantum device with such properties. Since any
singular vertex is effectively reduced to Fulop-Tsutsui vertex
in both high and low energy limits [7], our study hopefully
opens up a door for the full study of inverse scattering
problems for general singular vertex.
This article is organized as follows: In the second sec-
tion, we formulate the inverse scattering problem of scale
invariant graph vertices in terms of matrix diagonalization.
In the third section, a scheme to approximate the vertex with
small structures made up of δ-vertices is developed. In the
fourth section, the scheme is applied to obtain reﬂectionless
and equitransmitting quantum graphs. The accuracy of the
approximating procedure is examined in the ﬁfth section,
which is followed by the concluding sixth section.
II. INVERSE SCATTERING AS DIAGONALIZATION
Consider a singular quantum vertex of degree n, having
n half-lines sticking out of a point-like node. The scale
invariant subfamily of most general connection condition is
characterized by a complex matrix T of size (n − m) × m
where m can take the integer value m = 1, 2, ..., n − 1, and
is given by

I(m)
T

Ψ′ =
 0

−T †
I(n−m)

Ψ,
(1)
where I(l) signiﬁes the identity matrix of size l × l, and the
boundary vectors Ψ and Ψ′ are deﬁned by
Ψ =



ψ1(0)
...
ψn(0)


 ,
Ψ′ =



ψ′
1(0)
...
ψ′
n(0)


 ,
(2)
in which ψi(xi) and ψ′
i(xi) are the wave function and its
derivative on i-th line [8]. The coordinates xi on the i-th
line are labeled outwardly from the singular vertex, which is
assigned xi = 0 for all i. To achieve the from (1), we may have
to suitably renumber lines, in general. The quantum particle
coming in from the j-th line and scattered off the singular
vertex is described by the scattering wave function on the i-th
line, ψ(j)
i (x) which is given in the form
ψ(j)
i (x) = δi,je−ikx + Si,jeikx.
(3)
From (1) and (3), we obtain the equation

I(m) T

(S − I(n)) =

(S + I(n)).

We easily obtain the explicit solution of the scattering matrix
S = {Si,j} in the form
S = −I(n) + 2

Interestingly, (6) can also be viewed as the diagonalization
of Hermitian unitary matrix S by a non-unitary Hermitian
matrix Xm. We can show, in fact, that this form leads to
the path to the inverse scattering problem for quantum graph
vertex of Fulop-Tsutsui type: Let us suppose that the full set
of scattering data is given in terms of an arbitrary Hermitian
unitary matrix S. Let us signify the rank of the matrix S+I(n)
by m. After proper renumbering of lines, we can write this
matrix in the form
S + I(n) =

where the obvious notations Fij =

ril are adopted. Note that the equation (20) is exact
and does not involve any approximation. In the short range
limit d → 0, we have Fij = 1 + O(d2) and Gij = 1 + O(d2).
We can then show, with a straightforward calculation in the
manner of [8], that the limit d → 0 gives the desired
connection condition for Fulop-Tsutsui vertex (1).
IV. EXAMPLES
With the solution of the inverse scattering fully formulated,
it is now possible to ﬁnd a Fulop-Tsutsui vertex from a
given scattering matrix with speciﬁc requirement. Our previous
results detailed in [10] showing the reconstruction of “Free-
like” scattering is one such example, and could have been
achieved easier with current method. We now ask whether
there is fully reﬂectionless graph whose scattering matrix
has only zeros for its diagonal elements, Sii = 0. Vertices
yielding such scattering matrix is known to be useful in
developing semiclasical theory of quantum spectra [11]. If we
limit ourselves to real S, it becomes symmetric matrix with
Sij = Sji.
We note a useful relation concerning the trace of the scat-
tering matrix. Taking the trace of (6) and utilizing tr(AB) =
tr(BA), we have
tr S = tr Zm = 2m − n.
(21)
Since S for reﬂectionless scattering is traceless, we can have
such scattering only for n = 2m.
Our ﬁrst example is with n = 4 whose S is given by
S =

mission to all other lines. The smallest non-trivial example of
such matrix exists for n = 4, and given by

V. CONVERGENCE OF FINITE APPROXIMATIONS
Finally, we take a look at the convergence of the ﬁnite
size graph approximation by numerical calculations. In Figure
3, we display the scattering matrix of the ﬁnite graph that
is constructed to approximate equal-scattering reﬂectionless
matrix, (28). These are calculated directly from (20). The value
of the wave length k is in the unit of 1/d. The convergence
can be seen as quite good below kd ≲ 0.2. Numerical analysis
of other examples of different graphs give essentially the
same conclusion that the construction does represent physical
realization of singular Fulop-Tsutsui vertex.
VI. CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS
Now that the problem of ﬁnding desired property of Flulop-
Tsutsui graph is turned into mathematical one on Hermitian
unitary matrix, the search of system with S having other in-
teresting speciﬁcations should follow. various questions would
arise along the line, such as whether it is always trS = 0
for systems with “exchange symmetric” |Sij|. Generalization
to complex S is also an interesting problem [11]. Other
open questions include the generalization to non-Fulop-Tsutsui
connection which yields general unitary S not limited to
Hermitian ones. The study of the bound state spectra is one
thing we have completely neglected in this work. Application
to non-quantum waves, including electro-magnetic wave and
water wave should be another interesting subject.
In this work, through the ﬁnite construction of star graph
with no internal lines, we have actually studied the low energy
properties of graphs with internal lines all of whose edges
are connected to external lines, which we might term depth-
one graphs. The examination of depth-two graphs and beyond
seems to be the natural future direction. Our result showing
the full solution to the inverse scattering problem is, in a sense,
a partial fulﬁllment of the hope that quantum graph somehow
could be a solvable model and useful design tool at the same
time.
