Abstract— Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause 
of dementia in the elderly, accounting for 60-80% of all 
dementias.  Symptoms of AD include memory loss (initially 
short term, later on long term as well), changes in mood and 
sun-downing.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows 
diffuse cortical atrophy and enlargement of the lateral 
ventricles due to neuronal cell loss.  At the cellular level, 
neuroinflammation, activation of microglia, deposition of beta 
amyloid (Aβ) in the brain parenchyma and cerebral 
vasculature, and increases in the permeability of the blood-
brain barrier (BBB) have all been observed as well. A newly 
developed theory purports that the glymphatic system of the 
brain may play a significant role in AD pathogenesis.  This 
paper presents an initial mathematical model of the glymphatic 
system and studies how changes of transporter density and 
deposition of Aβ at the BBB changes clearance of Aβ.  Changes 
in local neuronal cell density were also modeled.  This 
represents one of the first attempts to computationally study 
the role of the glymphatic system in AD.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of 
dementia and affects nearly 1 in 6 people over the age of 65 
years.  The most common symptom associated with AD is 
the loss of short term memory (memory forming capability), 
followed by loss of long term memories important to the 
identity of the patient [7], [8].  Clinically, AD is diagnosed 
via post-mortem histology, and is identified from the 
presence of diffuse Aβ plaques throughout the cortices, 
which are particularly dense in the hippocampi and 
amygdala.  Beta amyloid is generated in response to several 
known stimuli, including: trauma, inflammation, infection 
and synaptic remodeling [13], [14], [15].  Enhancements in 
the capability of imaging modalities have demonstrated that 
many AD brains have diffuse cortical atrophy that is more 
severe than that seen for normal aging, as well as 
enlargement of the lateral ventricles believed to be due to 
neuronal cell loss.  Vascular dysfunction such as cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy (deposits of beta amyloid in the brain 
vasculature) and decreased cerebral blood flow have also 
been observed [11], [12].  
Other features seen on histology include an increased 
number 
of 
neurofibrillary 
tangles 
(NFTs) 
and 
neuroinflammatory markers.  Beta amyloid is known to 
activate microglia and induce the expression of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) and 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) [1].  This inflammation 
triggers further production of Aβ and creates a positive 
feedback loop if the inflammation is not controlled by IL-6 
inhibition and Aβ is not cleared effectively.  Such a local 
inflammatory environment is quite neurotoxic and can lead 
to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal cell death over time. 
Recent experimental research has shown that this 
paravascular space, an area located between the cerebral 
vasculature and astrocytes, functions as a “lymphatic” 
system, clearing cerebral waste products via active 
(membrane transporters) and passive (transport to cervical 
lymph nodes) transport [5].  Experimental results 
demonstrated that the majority (approximately 50%) of fluid 
in the paravascular space was transported via this pathway 
to the cervical lymph nodes [5].  The remainder of solutes 
are either cleared by receptors along the venule or at the 
arachnoid granulations. 
Conversely, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is believed to drain 
along cranial nerves, predominantly cranial nerve 1 via the 
cribiform plate [6].  CSF is mainly generated at the choroid 
plexus and travels through the ventricular system.  
Experiments have shown that significant changes in the 
choroid plexus occur in AD, aging and normal pressure 
hydrocephalus, and include: flattening and loss of the 
secretory epithelium; thickening of the basement membrane; 
cyst formation; lipid accumulation with fibrosis and 
calcification; hyalination; and especially important to AD 
pathogenesis, Aβ deposition in choroidal vessels [2].  The 
exact role of these changes is currently not well understood, 
but may contribute to abnormal clearance of Aβ from the 
brain which is studied in more detail in this paper. 
This paper studies the role of the glymphatic system in 
clearance of Aβ from the brain.  The generation of CSF and 
interstitial fluid (ISF), the effect of decreased densities of a 
key transport receptor, LRP-1 (low density lipoprotein-
related receptor protein 1) and the effect of increased Aβ 
generation rate were studied.  Section II will discuss more 
details on the model background information and it’s basis 
in currently available experimental data, as well as describe 
derivations of key equations that were used in modeling.  
Section III will describe the results of the model, while 
section IV will delve into the discussion of these results and 
how they relate to current ideas on the pathophysiology of 
the biological processes occurring in AD.  This represents 
one of the first mathematical models of the brain’s 
glymphatic system and applies it to an important clinical 
scenario (AD).

II. MODEL BACKGROUND 
In this model, the glymphatic system of the brain has 
been studied with respect to the clearance of Aβ.  The brain 
has 
been 
roughly 
divided 
into 
three 
overlapping 
compartments: the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the brain 
parenchyma and the paravascular space that runs between 
the two.  The CSF fills the cerebral ventricles and empties 
into the dural venous sinuses at the arachnoid granulations.  
Flow progresses from the choroid plexus inferiorly before 
splitting and heading either anteriorly towards the frontal 
lobe, or inferiorly, transversing around the cerebellum and 
occipital lobes until both pathways converge and drain to 
the superior sagittal sinus.  This is the location of the 
majority and largest of the arachnoid granulations, sites 
where the arachnoid delves into the dura and an exchange of 
CSF from the subarachnoid space to the venous blood 
occurs. 
The CSF serves several roles, including: buoyancy for the 
brain; acid-base buffering; and delivery of electrolytes, 
signaling molecules and micronutrients to cells within the 
brain parenchyma [4].  In addition to these roles, the ISF 
also has the task of clearing solutes and waste products from 
the intraparenchymal space.  At the cellular level, the 
abluminal Na+/K+ ATPase is responsible for generating 
both CSF and ISF; CSF is generated at a rate of about 350-
400 μL/min, while ISF is generated at about 0.17 μL/min 
[3], [4].  CSF is predominantly generated at the choroid 
plexus by secretory epithelium, while ISF is generated at the 
BBB.  Rate of production is a function of the following: 
 
       
  (                                                 ) 
It is important to note that CSF generation rates do not 
change with acute changes in CSF pressure; however, ISF 
generation rates may vary with the blood pressure of the 
involved vasculature and can be modeled according to 
Starling’s law: 
      (       )  
(1) 
  where Jv is the net fluid flux, Lp is the hydraulic 
conductivity, S is the surface area through which fluid is 
being transferred across, ΔP is the hydrostatic pressure 
difference, σ is the osmotic reflection coefficient and Δπ is 
the oncotic pressure difference.  The pressure differences 
(hydrostatic, oncotic) are taken across the BBB; that is, for 
ISF generation, the pressure gradient is the difference 
between the cerebral capillary and the interstitial space.   
Once the ISF is generated, it flows with a predominantly 
convective nature as diffusion coefficients are so trivial 
compared to the fluid flow rate that they can be considered 
negligible.  ISF generation at the BBB by astrocytes occurs 
at a constant rate k5 (12 μL/hr) and is also dependent on the 
amount of CSF that is recycled into the interstitial space as 
described by the following equation: 
     
  
                  
 
(2) 
where ISFa is the amount of ISF produced by astrocytes, 
k2 is the rate of CSF recycled into the ISF, and d1 is the 
amount degraded at each time step.  The total amount of ISF 
within the brain parenchyma (ISF) is modeled as the sum of 
that generated by astrocytes in addition to the amount 
produced by neurons: 
    
                     
 
(3) 
where k1 is the rate of ISF generation by neurons and d3 
is the degradation rate of ISF within the brain parenchyma 
(ISFb).  Beta amyloid is generated by neurons (k7) and 
cleared via LRP-1 at the BBB (k3), at brain endothelial cells 
at the venule and at the dural venous sinuses as defined by 
the following: 
    
  
                    
 
(4) 
    
  
                        
 
(5) 
      
  
     (          ) 
 
(6) 
where ABb is the amount of beta amyloid generated 
within the brain, ABp is the total amount beta amyloid, 
ABCSF is the amount of beta amyloid in the CSF, and k4 is 
the amount of Aβ transported to the CSF.  LRP-1 levels at 
the venule and dural venous sinus were varied linearly to 
study the effect of decreased LRP-1 density on Aβ clearance 
from the brain.  The system of equations was modeled using 
Matlab using a timestep of 1 day.  The total time modeled 
was 5 years.  For the simulations done here, the CSF 
concentration was held constant (blood pressure effect was 
not modeled here).  The number of neurons was also 
modeled, dependent on the local concentration of Aβ such 
that neuron number decreased a specified percent if a level 
above a specified threshold (>1x1010) was reached.  This 
threshold level was held constant for all simulations such 
that only very high levels of beta amyloid would lead to 
neuronal cell death.  The model did not take into account 
neuronal cell injury (and subsequent death) that can occur at 
lower levels of Aβ that occur for prolonged periods of time. 
III. RESULTS 
An initial simulation was run to verify that the system 
was stable (Figure 1).  The system of ODEs was simulated 
using Matlab and modeled over the course of a 5 year 
timespan.  Results showed the absence of any perturbations 
and the simulation was stable over the time course and the 
range of rate constants used.  
The highest concentration of Aβ is found within the 
brain, then within the dural venous sinuses and lastly in the 
CSF.  Neuron number was constant over time and was 
dependent on the concentration of Aβ within the brain, as 
well as the nutrients from the ISF.

Figure 2: The generation rate of Aβ was increased to (a) 2x  and (b) 10x   the normal rates.  In both cases, neither simulation showed any change in the neuronal 
density.  Only the levels of Aβ increased, demonstrating that having increased generation rate alone is not sufficient to lead to Aβ levels that are high enough to 
lead to neuronal cell loss.

Figure 3: LRP1 levels at the venule and dural venous sinus were varied to 
study the effect of decreased expression LRP1 expression levels on the level 
of Aβ within the brain, CSF and paravascular spaces. (a) 50% normal LRP1 
expression (b) 86% normal LRP1 expression; this is the transition point 
between a sustainable decrease in LRP1 and one that leads to neuron loss 
(c) 90% normal LRP1 expression. 
 
 
A.  
Alteration of Aβ generation rates 
Alteration of Aβ generation rates by two and ten times 
the basal rate demonstrated no change in neuron number.  
Only an increase in the level of Aβ proportionate to the 
increased generation rate was seen; however, these levels 
never crossed the threshold to lead to neuronal cell death 
(Figure 2).  
 
 B. 
 Alteration of LRP-1 levels 
LRP-1 levels were varied from 50-90% of normal levels 
to study whether decreased levels had a significant effect on 
the clearance of Aβ from the brain (Figure 3).  By 
decreasing LRP-1 levels by just 10%, the amount of Aβ 
within the CSF started to increase exponentially but not to a 
level that caused neuronal cell death. At 86% of the normal 
density of LRP-1, there was a late occurring, catastrophic 
loss of neurons within the local region modeled as Aβ levels 
climbed above the threshold that lead to neuronal cell death.  
Decreasing the LRP-1 density further simply shifted the 
point at which neuronal loss occurred to earlier time points.   
 
IV. 
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION 
In this paper, the role of the glymphatic system in the 
clearance of Aβ has been studied.  Reference simulations 
showed that the basic model developed here was stable over 
a total time course equivalent to 5 years and for a range of 
rate constants. 
 
Altering the 
Aβ 
generation rate 
demonstrated that although Aβ levels increased in response 
to the elevated generation rate, levels never reached the 
threshold where neuronal cell death started to occur.  This 
suggests that an increased Aβ generation rate alone is not 
sufficient enough to lead to the pathology seen in AD.  This 
conclusion, however, is dependent on the threshold value set 
for where acute increases in Aβ lead to neuronal cell death.  
An alternative approach to this situation would be to study 
how chronic increases in Aβ at lower concentrations can 
have a negative effect on neuronal cell density. 
Decreasing the density of LRP-1 receptors at the venule 
and dural venous sinuses did, however, have a significant 
effect on the neuronal cell number and Aβ level.  A decrease 
of just 10% led to an exponential rise in Aβ over the 
duration of the simulation.  This suggests that this clearance 
method is important in maintaining net balance of Aβ levels 
within the brain.  When the LRP-1 density was further 
decreased to 86% of the normal levels, neuronal cell death 
occurred.  Decreasing the density further to half of normal 
levels simply caused neuronal cell death to occur at an 
earlier time point.  Interestingly, Aβ levels continued to rise 
after neuronal cell death as inflammation was rampant at 
this point and neurons died, releasing their Aβ into the 
interstitial fluid to be cleared.  This is in accordance with the 
experimental literature which has shown that decreased

LRP-1 levels are common in AD and may be a significant 
contributing factor to the buildup of Aβ within the brain [9], 
[10].  The dramatic changes seen in neuronal cell number 
with this simulation suggest an important role for LRP-1 at 
the dural venous sinuses in maintaining normal Aβ levels 
within 
the 
brain, 
which 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
experimentally [9]. 
The mathematical model presented here is one of the first 
iterations that has been used to study the interaction between 
the glympahtic system and AD pathogenesis.  The model 
has been developed to study how changes in key steps of 
clearance can affect the Aβ levels within the brain, and has 
focused here on the importance of LRP-1 in Aβ clearance.  
The model here is just a starting point and will be expanded 
to study the roles that alterations in clearance to the cervical 
lymph nodes play; how chronic hypertension and 
hypotension can play a role in decreased Aβ clearance; how 
Aβ deposition in the cerebral vasculature changes the ability 
of Aβ to be cleared as well as induces the breakdown of the 
BBB and subsequently causes a local inflammatory 
response; and how inflammation can change the clearance 
of Aβ.  This work promises to be important in 
understanding how Aβ clearance mechanisms, especially 
how the glymphatic system, plays a significant role in the 
pathogenesis of AD and could be helpful in developing 
possible treatment modalities in the future.
