Abstract — Machine to Machine (M2M) communications have 
experienced very fast growth in recent times and several 
forecasts indicate that this trend is going to increase 
dramatically over the coming years. The traffic generated by 
M2M services can have very different characteristics as 
compared to conventional data or voice traffic, heavy 
burstiness being one its main features. This paper addresses 
the above issues in the context of cellular networks. Models for 
signaling and payload throughput in cellular core networks are 
derived, with particular focus on the effects of aggregated 
M2M services. These models were implemented in a 
computational tool that provides visualization of network 
performance and capacity metrics as function of different 
service orchestrations. This can be of great usefulness for 
Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and other entities that 
need to understand how to design M2M services and how to 
deal with their impacts on cellular networks.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Telecommunications services are on the verge of major 
changes 
with 
the 
rising 
of 
Machine 
to 
Machine 
communications and the Internet of Things (IoT). It is 
expected a growth on the number of connected devices up to 
50 billion by 2020 [1]. Such numbers might still be a few 
years away, but many M2M services are starting to roll out 
[2].  
The effects that M2M related traffic will imply to cellular 
networks are widely unknown and unstudied, thus it 
becomes the fundamental objective of this paper to provide 
models that can be of usefulness to understand such effects, 
to provide insights on how to design M2M services, and to 
study the changes that must be enforced on cellular 
networks. 
The focus on cellular networks, is justified by 
considering that this access technology is the only that can 
guarantee extremely high rates of coverage. Thus, it is 
believed that cellular infrastructures are going to be 
fundamental in the roll-out of services based on M2M 
technologies. 
Additionally, it is expected that traffic generated by many 
M2M services will present similar characteristics to traffic 
generated by modern smartphone applications, mainly social 
networks and instant messaging applications [3]. Thus, this 
work is believed to be of relevance to services other than 
M2M.  
The traffic generated by M2M services will present very 
different features when compared to conventional data and 
voice traffic. Such features will include different patterns of 
use, with some services presenting high predictability, and 
others high unpredictability. Many M2M services will 
generate data transmissions very few times a day, others, a 
high number of transmissions with very small payloads 
[4][5]. Burstiness, a statistics concept that refers to the 
intermittent increases and decreases in the activity or 
frequency of an event, will also be a typical characteristic for 
most M2M generated traffic [4][6]. 
Considering that cellular networks have not been design 
to deal with this kind of traffic, it becomes urgent to 
understand how a broad adoption of M2M services will 
affect the cellular networks. Particularly, considering the 
number of sessions, the number of subscriptions, and the 
amount of signaling generated by very small quantities of 
payload information. Such understanding will provide 
MNOs with the necessary knowledge to redesign and resize 
their cellular networks as well as design M2M services, 
applications, and platforms. 
This paper is comprised by eight sections. Section I 
presents an overview on the problem at study. Section II 
presents some of the main implications of M2M 
Communications 
on 
Cellular 
Telecommunications 
Networks. Section III proposes a model for Universal Mobile 
Telecommunications System (UMTS) Packet Core (PC) 
traffic and throughput analysis. Section IV proposes a model 
for UMTS PC network modeling. Section V proposes a 
model for service orchestration. Section VI describes a 
computational tool developed in order to apply the 
previously referred models. Section VII presents a case 
study, illustrative of the application of the proposed models, 
and finally, Section VIII presents the conclusion and 
discussion, as well as future work on this subject.

to deal with the foreseeable increase on signaling traffic. 
Such increase is driven by the growth on M2M and 
smartphone signaling traffic (growing 50% faster than data 
traffic [3]). Furthermore, the overall impacts on network 
capacity and performance, caused by adding a large number 
of M2M subscriptions to current networks are generally 
unknown, and may require new levels of scalability, in terms 
of subscription handling and in terms of mobility and 
resource management [7]. Considering the explosion of 
M2M communications, and given that designing a system 
based on the worst case is very costly [8], it is important to 
design models and algorithms to depict the networks on large 
M2M deployment scenarios, allowing for its dimensioning 
based on average values with some kind of overload control 
strategies.  
Some M2M related factors that might have impact on 
Core Network performance are: 
A. M2M Traffic Temporal Regime 
M2M communications present a broad number of 
applications and services. Thus, is no surprise that the M2M 
traffic temporal regime can be very heterogeneous among 
different applications and usage scenarios, and consequently 
its characteristics are diverse and hard to predict. This is a 
fundamental difference from most Circuit Switched (CS) 
traffic, adding up to the complexity of analysis of this issue. 
B. Burstiness 
Burstiness is a statistics concept that refers to the 
intermittent increases and decreases in the activity or 
frequency of an event, which is characteristic of most of 
M2M related traffic [4][6]. Understanding the burstiness 
behavior of data traffic is fundamental, since burstiness 
introduces sudden peak loads to the network, and is relevant 
for design and QoS purposes [8]. One of the fundamental 
design issues related to burstiness is to determine which 
solution is better: to have devices always in Packet Data 
Protocol (PDP) active state or to have them constantly 
activating and deactivating PDP sessions. 
C. Relation between information payloads and signaling 
overheads 
One of the implications of such decision is on the 
payload to signaling ratio. Sessions being constantly 
activated and deactivated will increase dramatically this 
ratio, with consequences that are not yet known. Some of 
them might be congestion on elements/functions, such as 
Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA), 
Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN), Online Charging 
System (OCS) and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN). 
D. Addressability 
On the other hand, if every single device is always with 
an active PDP session there will be a need for more IP 
addresses, and probability an expansion on several 
databases such as Home Location Register (HLR) and 
Authentication Center (AuC). Such a scenario could require 
the deployment of IPv6, since IPv4 would not sustain such a 
network for a long period. 
III. 
TRAFFIC AND THROUGHPUT ANALYSIS FOR UMTS 
PACKET CORE NETWORKS 
The presented work will now focus on UMTS networks, 
but it can be applicable to other 3GPP technologies. In order 
to identify the elements and interfaces of the 3G network 
whose performance and capacity are most critically exposed 
to negative effects of M2M traffic, a set of models has been 
developed to calculate payload and signaling throughput on a 
UMTS network. The following sections present models for 
Iu-Packet Switched (PS) and Gr interface. 
A. Iu-PS Interface 
The “Iu” interface is comprised of two connections, the 
Iu-PS interface that interconnects the Radio Network 
Controller (RNC) and the SGSN and the Iu-CS interface that 
connects the RNC to the Media Gateway (MGW). The 
MGW is part of the CS domain and therefore the Iu-CS 
interface will not be considered in the following calculations 
(M2M communications will be supported by the Packet 
Core). Adapting the work presented in [8][9], the following 
equations can be formulate: 
1) The overhead ratio in Iu-PS interface is given by: 
𝑅𝑂𝐼𝑢−𝑃𝑆 =
𝑆𝑃𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡+ 𝐻𝐼𝑢𝑈𝑃+ 𝐻𝐺𝑇𝑃+ 𝐻𝑈𝐷𝑃+ 𝐻𝐼𝑃+ 𝐻𝑀𝑃𝐿𝑆
𝑆𝑃𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡

    where: 
 
“𝑆𝑃𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡” is the average IP packet size [bytes];                 
 
“𝐻𝑥” is the header size of “x” packet, as depicted 
on Table I [bytes].

defined on Table IV; 
 
“𝑅𝑂𝐼𝑢−𝑃𝑆” is the overhead ratio in Iu-PS interface,

B. Gr interface 
Applying the same method is possible to define the

Using the throughput models from the previous section 
it is possible to design a mathematical model of the

In order to study such network, let us consider the model 
presented on Figure 2, where: 
 
“𝑤𝑖” is the raw throughput capacity for interface “𝑖” 
[bps]; 
 
“𝑆𝐼𝐺𝑖𝑋” is the signaling capacity for interface “𝑖” of 
Network Element (NE) “x” [bps]; 
 
“𝑤𝑖𝑋” is the raw throughput capacity for interface 
“𝑖” of NE/System “x” [bps].

This model is useful in order to develop a computational 
tool capable of applying the models proposed in Section III. 
V. 
SERVICE ORCHESTRATION 
The traffic models presented in previous sections require 
knowledge about the aggregated M2M traffic coming from 
the user side. This section presents an orchestration model 
capable of providing an approximation for this aggregated 
traffic as function of different usage profiles. 
Table IV presents the variables that must be defined for 
each service to consider on the orchestration operation.

VI. COMPUTATIONAL TOOL 
In order to provide a visualization and interactive 
environment based on the previously presented models, a 
computational tool has been developed with the objective of 
calculating and providing visual representations of network 
behavior as a function of different service orchestrations.

Although this paper studies UMTS, this tool can be

VII. CASE STUDY 
A. Example of Application 
To illustrate the applicability of proposed models, let us 
consider a case study where it will be studied the uplink 
capacity usage of Iu-PS and Gr interfaces as a function of 
M2M services usability. Let us consider a UMTS network 
with the following characteristics: 
 
𝑤𝐼𝑢−𝑃𝑆 =  𝑤𝐼𝑢−𝑃𝑆𝑆𝐺𝑆𝑁 = 100.000 Mbps; 
 
𝑤𝐺𝑟 =  𝑤𝐺𝑟𝑆𝐺𝑆𝑁 = 500 kbps. 
 
The service orchestration is based on the following 
elements: 
 
Baseline service set (CS and PS services already 
present in the network before the introduction of 
M2M services); 
 
M2M service set (e.g., Smart Metering, Home 
Automation, Healthcare, Security, etc.). 
 
In order to calculate the capacity usage prior to 
considering M2M services, i.e. the baseline service set, the 
model described in equations (6) to (9) will be applied to the 
various services under consideration (PS services such as 
browsing, email, social networks, streaming, etc., and PS 
services such as voice calls and Short Message Service 
(SMS)). As an example of the method applied, calculations 
for email are presented on Table V.  
Let us now consider that replicating these calculations 
for other services, and considering that 100,000 cellular 
subscribers (assumed to be, mainly, smartphone subscribers) 
are being served, the values for Iu-PS and Gr baseline usage 
(uplink) can be calculated [11] and will provide the 
following values: 
 
Iu-PS usage baseline: 105 Mbps (of which, 3% is 
signaling); 
 
Gr usage baseline: 350 kbps (of which, 100% is 
signaling).

For sake of simplicity, it shall be considered that the 
baseline usage is constant through the 24 hours of the day. 
The network at study will provide connectivity for a set 
of M2M services, which are considered to be as presented 
on Table VI and Figure 5.

In order to apply the proposed models, the header size 
for the protocol stack of the interface Iu-PS must be known. 
Assuming that header values for the Iu-PS interface are 
as presented on Table VII, and applying them to (1), it 
comes:  
𝑅𝑂𝐼𝑢−𝑃𝑆 = 1,40.

Figure 6.   Case study results. 
Now that every variable has been presented, it is 
possible to input the service orchestration parameters of 
Table VI into the computational tool, and visualize results. 
For this case study, the tool provides the results of Figure 6, 
which shows uplink usage rates (%) for the Iu-PS and Gr, 
prior and after the addition of M2M services.  
By analyzing this figure, it can be concluded that the 
impact of M2M traffic on Iu-PS interface is negligible, since 
the payload generated by these M2M services is small, and 
the amount of signaling is small relatively to the capacity of 
this interface. However, on Gr interface it is visible a 
considerable increase on capacity usage, showing that M2M 
services have increased significantly the amount of control 
information being carried by this interface (HLR, AuC). In 
the scenario at study, after considering M2M services, Gr 
interface is dangerously close to its full capacity, which 
could 
originate 
network 
congestion 
and 
QoS/QoE 
degradation. 
B. Sensitivity Analysis for Orchestration Parameters 
An important feature provided by the developed tool is 
that it allows service developers to foresee how the network 
will respond as a function of service orchestration and 
parameterization scenarios. In order to identify which 
service parameters could be problematic to the network 
performance, a sensitivity analysis for the M2M service 
orchestration parameters is presented as a function of 
different interface usage ratios when varying a set of service 
orchestration parameters. To this purpose, the tool was 
configured to consider a M2M service, characterized by the 
following parameter values (typical of a smart-metering 
service): 
 
8.500 Aggregation Nodes; 
 
Transmission Interval: 30 minutes; 
 
Ratio of authentication that needs to get parameters 
from HLR (𝑅𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝐻𝐿𝑅): 20%; 
 
Average Packet size (𝑃𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒): 130 bytes; 
 
Gr uplink capacity (𝑤𝐺𝑟): 1 Mbps; 
 
Other interfaces uplink capacity: 10Mbps. 
 
The parameters that were considered in this sensitivity 
analysis were the transmission interval, the ratio of 
authentication that needs to get parameters from HLR, the 
average Packet size and the number of SMSs per hour. 
The results of this analysis are presented on Figure 7, 
from where it can be observed that the transmission interval 
will be the most influential constraint for the considered 
M2M services. For small values of transmission interval, the 
impact of M2M overheads can vary noticeably, particularly 
in Gr and Iu-PS. Concerning the other parameters at study, 
no major design constraints are expected, except for services 
that will require a considerably large amount of SMSs.

VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented mathematical models that can be 
useful to better understand the effects of M2M related traffic 
into cellular telecommunications networks. As a result of 
this work a prototype for a computational tool was 
developed, that is believed to be of value to MNOs and 
future research in this field. The results presented, although 
mainly illustrative, support the usefulness of this models 
and tool. The presented work needs further developments 
and improvements, mainly in the orchestration of usage 
scenarios, which implies an extended development of the 
proposed models and a deeper knowledge on the 
characteristics of M2M traffic sources, accordingly to 
different types of services and usage scenarios. Although 
influenciated by previous work [8][9], the models presented 
on Section III represent a novel insight to study the UMTS 
Packet Core. Their application to the study of M2M 
communications is, to the best knowledge of the authors, a 
new application to such model. The resultant computational 
tool has already proven to be of practical benefit to real 
world application.
