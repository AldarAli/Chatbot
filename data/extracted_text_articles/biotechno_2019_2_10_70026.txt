Abstract – Many mothers experience maternal physical and 
mental health problems a few weeks after childbirth with 
unknown causes. To investigate this problem, Traditional 
Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory is applied to define 
individuals’ body constitution. As constitution refers to the 
relatively 
consistent 
characteristics 
of 
individual 
body 
structure and body function which affect the susceptibility 
towards different causing factors and the tendency of disease 
development, it is useful to predict the postnatal problems with 
body constitutions. The objective of this paper is to investigate 
the correlation between prenatal conditions (particularly TCM 
body constitution) and postnatal health problems with data 
mining approaches. Data was collected from pregnant women 
aged 21 to 45 through a standardized Constitution in Chinese 
Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) before childbirth and a face-
to-face assessment that was conducted by the TCM 
practitioner after childbirth. The collected data was analyzed 
by Pearson’s Chi-square test and three benchmark data 
mining models to discover significant correlation. This study 
confirms a strong correlation between imbalanced TCM body 
constitution 
and 
postnatal 
problems. 
The 
discovered 
correlation can help to provide personalized TCM treatment to 
prevent the potential postnatal problems through an early 
TCM intervention during pregnancy to regulate the imbalance 
condition of pregnant women. 
Keywords—TCM body constitution; postnatal problems; data 
mining; chi-square test; correlation. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Almost 
every 
mother 
experiences 
physical 
and 
psychological sicknesses after childbirth. Even though the 
results of prenatal check-up and tests, including ultrasound 
exams, blood tests, glucose challenge screening, etc., are 
normal, many women are still suffering from postnatal 
problems such as prolonged lochia, depression, tiredness, 
sleep disturbance, headache, constipation, etc. [2]-[4], while 
the reasons are unknown [6][7]. To ensure both mothers and 
babies are provided with the best care and protection, in 
addition to the Western medical check-up and tests, many 
mothers in Asian countries [8] adopt Traditional Chinese 
Medicine (TCM) as complementary maternal healthcare 
during their prenatal period, or even before becoming 
pregnant. They believe that TCM treatment before childbirth 
could help them to prevent miscarriage and sicknesses. 
TCM is widely used in maternal healthcare in both Asian 
[8] and Western countries [9] nowadays. TCM practitioners 
perform predictive, preventive and personalized diagnosis 
[10][11] to individuals. Treatments could be different for 
individuals with the same symptom, but the different 
diagnosis of TCM syndrome differentiation is due to their 
different body constitution types. TCM body constitution 
[12] could be divided into nine types: gentleness, qi-
deficiency, yang-deficiency, yin-deficiency, phlegm-damp, 
damp-heat, blood-stagnation, qi-stagnation and special 
diathesis, according to Q. Wang [18].  
In the theory of body constitution in TCM, every 
individual has his/her body constitution. Balanced body 
constitution (i.e., gentleness type) is considered as the most 
desirable constitution which represents good health [22].  A 
person with balanced status is the least susceptible to illness 
[13] because the body can maintain homeostasis physically 
and psychologically, and people with imbalanced status are 
considered as unhealthy and prone to sickness or diseases 
[23] [31]. The imbalanced health status can be caused by the 
deficiency of “qi” (vital energy), “yang” (masculine or 
positive principle that is characterized by light/warmth/ 
dryness/activity) or “yin” (feminine or negative principle that 
characterized by dark/wetness/cold/passivity/disintegration), 
the build-up of dampness, phlegm or heat, stagnation of “qi” 
and blood, or special diathesis (sensitive to external 
stimulants such as drugs, food, smells or seasonal triggers) 
[24].  
Prevention of disease is part of maintaining good health. 
The aim of this study is to discover the significant correlation 
between 
prenatal 
conditions 
(especially 
TCM 
body 
constitution) and postnatal problems from the personal 
profile for each pregnant woman from prenatal to postnatal 
period, so that postnatal problems can be predicted at an 
earlier stage. By matching the discovered correlation patterns 
with the prenatal conditions of pregnant women, it would be 
possible to predict if a mother will develop particular 
postpartum diseases or symptoms. This will allow TCM 
practitioners to provide an intervention procedure to adjust 
the imbalanced condition to prevent certain postnatal 
problems.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the methods of the data collection, preparation and 
modelling. Section III presents the experimental results. 
Finally, Sections IV and V are the discussion and conclusion.   
II. METHODS 
A. Selection of Participants 
The recruitment of participants was started in May, 2013 
in community TCM clinics in Hong Kong. The selection 
criteria were women who are over 18 years old and living in 
Hong Kong for more than 10 years. To avoid outliers or 
external factors, women with serious health problems 
including HIV/AIDS, cancer, viral infections (e.g., Ebola, 
Zika virus, etc.) within a year were excluded.  
B. Building Health Profiles 
Data was collected from 1) prenatal period (i.e., the time 
between conception and childbirth) and 2) postnatal period

(i.e., six weeks after childbirth) to build the health profiles 
that include the maternal health conditions of participants. 
1) Prenatal Profile 
In general medical practice, the TCM practitioner can 
determine the body constitution of patients by four 
diagnostic methods including observation (face, body form, 
tongue, etc.), smelling and hearing (odours from mouth/ 
body, loudness of speaking voice), inquiry (symptoms) and 
palpitation (pulse) [17]. To classify each participant into one 
or multiple body constitutions systematically, each patient 
needs to complete a standardized Constitution in Chinese 
Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) that was developed by Q. 
Wang [18] and China Association of Chinese Medicine [19] 
with the diagnosis and validation of the TCM practitioner. 
The CCMQ is a self-rating scale questionnaire that includes 
60 questions related to a variety of prenatal conditions (e.g., 
cold/warm hands and feet, anxiety level, dark circles around 
the eyes, dry mouth, etc.). The participants should complete 
the questionnaire in Google Forms according to their 
physical and mental health condition in the prenatal period.  
a) CCMQ Score 
 
A set of CCMQ scores S = {s1, s2, s3, …, s9} that are 
corresponding to the nine types of TCM body constitution 
(c1: gentleness, c2: qi-deficiency, c3: yang-deficiency, c4: yin-
deficiency, c5: phlegm-damp, c6: damp-heat, c7: blood-
stagnation, c8: qi-stagnation and c9: special diathesis) 
respectively are calculated from the CCMQ by following the 
equations in [20].  After calculating the scores, all 
participants are classified into one or multiple TCM body 
constitution types based on Table I .

b) Classification of TCM Body Constitution 
 
In the classification of TCM body constitution types, we 
can identify the likelihood (in terms of CCMQ score) of each 
body constitution type of each participant according to Table 
I. Each participant may have one or more dominant body 
constitution types, or even have a conflict between balanced 
and imbalanced body constitutions. Here are three sample 
cases: 
Case 1: Given a participant P1 with CCMQ scores S1 = {75, 
56, 27, 25, 12, 15, 20, 18, 10}. s1 is higher than 60, but s2 is 
also higher than 40. Hence, P1 is classified as c2 instead of c1. 
Case 2: Given a participant P2 with CCMQ scores S2 = {75, 
16, 27, 25, 32, 25, 10, 18, 10}. As s1 is higher than 60, s5 is 
higher than 30, and sn is less than 40 where n = 2 to 9, P2 is 
classified as c1 marginally. Also, s5 is between 30 and 39, so 
P2 has a mixture of two body constitution types: marginal c1 
and tends to c5. 
Case 3: Given a participant P3 with CCMQ scores S3 = {59, 
16, 27, 25, 12, 15, 20, 18, 10}. s1 is less than 60, and sn is less 
than 30 where n = 2 to 9, P3 is classified as undefined body 
constitution. 
2) Postnatal Profile 
All participants who completed the CCMQ in the first 
stage should arrange a face-to-face assessment with a 
registered TCM practitioner after childbirth. The TCM 
practitioner needs to complete the postnatal profile that 
includes two parts: a) demographics and maternal health 
information, and b) physical and mental postnatal health 
problems within six weeks after childbirth.  
a) Demographics and Maternal Health Information 
In the first part, the basic demographic data, such as age, 
occupation and blood type, are collected, and the other 
questions are related to the menses cycle and volume, 
ovulation, delivery method, and the number of fetuses of the 
participants.  
b) Physical and Mental Postnatal Health Problems 
In the second part, postnatal health problems including 
prolonged lochia (i.e., vaginal discharge after giving birth 
containing blood, mucus, and uterine tissue over 21 days), 
tiredness, abnormal sweating, etc. are examined. Since all the 
questions are TCM-specific, some factors, such as tongue 
appearance and pulse patterns, should be examined face-to-
face by a TCM practitioner.  
C. Data Preparation 
Firstly, the data of the prenatal and postnatal profiles was 
merged and stored into a database, which includes 132 rows 
(i.e., records) and 210 columns (i.e., attributes).  Secondly, 
incorrect and inconsistent data was identified by the TCM 
practitioner, and the identified fields and records were either 
corrected or removed from the data set. Lastly, the 
continuous data, such as age, age of first menses, period 
cycle and week of childbirth, were discretized into intervals, 
as advised by the TCM practitioner. 
D. Identify Dependent and Independent Attributes 
Dependent and independent attributes [21] were 
identified from our collected data, as shown in Table II. The 
dependent attributes represent the outcome that we want to 
predict (i.e., postnatal problems), and the independent 
attributes represent the input of potential causes (e.g., 
demographics, prenatal conditions, TCM body constitution, 
etc.).  
E. Data Modeling 
The correlation between prenatal health conditions 
(especially TCM body constitution) and postnatal problems 
can be discovered by supervised data mining models. We 
used an open-source data mining tool named Orange, which 
includes these three supervised data mining models: decision 
tree [26], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [27] and Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANN) [28][29] for discovering significant 
patterns from the collected maternal data and comparing the 
effectiveness of different data mining models on TCM data 
analysis. The Orange version 3.14 was installed. To obtain 
the best accuracy and results, the parameters of the decision 
tree, SVM and ANN were set as described below. 
In the decision tree modelling, the “Tree” widget was 
used. The parameters of the minimum number of instances in

leaves, the smallest number of instance of splitting subsets 
and maximal tree depth were set to 2, 5 and 100, respectively. 
In the SVM modelling, Radial basis function (RBF) kernel 
was used, and the parameters of C and ε were set to 1.00 and 
0.1, respectively to obtain the best accuracy. In the ANN 
modelling, the number of neurons per hidden layer was set to 
100, and the parameters of activation, solver and alpha were 
set to ReLu (rectified linear unit function), Adam (stochastic 
gradient-based optimizer) and 0.0001 respectively.

To prevent over fitting, the validation was carried out 
with 5-fold cross validation due to the small sample size. The 
data was split into a training set (80%) for building the model 
and test set (20%) for validating the built model. The data 
mining steps are summarized here: 
Step 1: Import the collected data with the “File” widget. 
Step 2: Define the input and output attributes by the “Select 
Columns” widget.  
Step 3: Feed the selected data to different data mining 
models: “Tree” (i.e., decision tree), “SVM” and “Neural 
Network” (i.e., ANN). 
Step 4: Perform cross-validation accuracy estimation with 
the “Test & Score” widget. 
Step 5: Predict the unknown output with the “Predictions” 
widget. 
Step 6: Repeat Step 2 to remove the outliers and adjust the 
parameter settings to obtain better accuracy. 
III. RESULTS 
A. Distributions  
1) Demographics 
A total of 132 pregnant women aged 21 to 45 were 
recruited from May, 2013 to May, 2017. Participants aged 31 
to 35 was the majority group (55.30%), followed by the age 
groups 26 to 30 (16.67%) and 36 to 40 (18.18%). Around 
half of the participants (56.8%) were working indoors, and 
some of them were not working (16.67%).  
2) Maternal Health Information 
According to the pregnancy information, 59.09% of the 
participants were at their first pregnancy, and over 90% of 
them had one fetus. Although most of the mothers were 
reported as healthy and had regular menses cycle and normal 
menses volume, there were 69.70% of them who mentioned 
that they were suffering from different kinds of discomforts 
during pregnancy. To reduce the risk of miscarriage or 
discomfort during pregnancy, most participants (88.64%) 
took Western supplements such as folic acid, Materna, and a 
few of them (37.12%) also took Chinese medicine. When 
they were sick, half of them did not take either Western or 
Chinese medicine because they were afraid the medicine 
would influence the health of their fetuses.  
3) Delivery Information 
The delivery dates of most of our participants (39.39%) 
were in winter, while the others who delivered in summer 
were the least (13.64%). Over 90% of them had full-term 
pregnancy (i.e., delivered within 37 to 42 weeks), and natural 
childbirth was the main type (61.36%) of delivery. Most of 
them (78.79%) were able to leave the hospital after childbirth 
within 4 days, and only a few (4.55%) were staying in the 
hospital for more than 6 days. After the delivery, 72.73% of 
the participants followed the traditional rituals of TCM (e.g., 
no hair wash, use TCM or ginger for body wash, avoid all 
cold and raw food and drinks, etc.) during their postnatal 
period.  
4) Physical and Mental Postnatal Health Problems 
Within the postnatal period, our participants were 
suffering from different postnatal health problems. We found 
that 92.42% of them suffered from four or more different 
health problems after childbirth, and the occurrence of 16 
common postnatal TCM symptoms are shown in Table III 
(in descending order).  
5) TCM Body Constitution 
In the prenatal profile, participants were classified into 
nine types of TCM body constitution: gentleness, qi-
deficiency, yang-deficiency, yin-deficiency, phlegm-damp, 
damp-heat, blood-stagnation, qi-stagnation and special 
diathesis according to the equations in Table I. Except for the 
gentleness type that is considered as balanced body 
constitution, the other types are considered as imbalanced. In 
15

our data, 100 women were classified as imbalanced body 
constitution, 28 were balanced, and 4 were unclassified.   
By considering the participants who were belonging to a 
certain body constitution type obviously (i.e., cn is “Yes”), 
the top three TCM body constitution types are Yin-
deficiency (37.12%), Yang-deficiency (35.61%) and blood-
stagnation (35.61%). 
It is important to note that not all individuals would have 
a single body constitution type; it is common to have a mixed 
body constitution (i.e., two or more body constitution types). 
Among 104 participants who were considered as having 
imbalanced body constitution, 30.77% participants had 
single body constitution type, 65.38% of them had two or 
more, and only a small proportion (3.85%) were unclassified.

B. Correlation between TCM Body Constitution and 
Postnatal Problems 
1) Statistical Test for Independence 
Pearson’s Chi-square test [30] was used to measure the 
correlations between TCM body constitution types and 
postnatal TCM symptoms, and the null hypothesis was 
applied to prove whether the occurrence of these two 
attributes was statistically independent. After carrying out 
the test in a statistical software package SPSS, we discovered 
that some postnatal symptoms from Table IV did not occur 
by chance, but were statistically dependent on certain TCM 
body constitution types. The significant pairs of attributes 
with a 95% confidence interval (i.e., p-value < 0.05) were 
listed in Table IV with the results of Cramer’s V that 
indicates the strength statistic. The coefficient of Cramer’s V 
ranges from 0 (no association) to 1 (strongest association). 
With the degree of freedom df = 2, the strength is considered 
as small, medium and large for the values 0.07, 0.21 and 
0.35, respectively [32]. 
Within the 45 significant pairs of attributes, 16 pairs were 
statistically significant (i.e., significance level < 0.01) with 
medium/ strong strength in Cramer’s V. However, the Chi-
square test with Cramer’s V can only determine the statistical 
significance between two attributes, but how exactly they are 
related to each other is unknown (e.g., Is qi-deficiency/ tends 
to qi-deficiency/ non-qi-deficiency related to emotional 
depression or not?). Thus, we need to use decision tree 
modelling to discover detailed relationships. 
2) Decision Tree Modeling 
From the results of Pearson’s Chi-square test in Table IV, 
we observed that some TCM body constitution types are 
highly correlated to certain postnatal symptoms. To further 
investigate the detailed relationships between these two 
attributes, we selected a significant pair of attributes (qi-
deficiency and dizziness) with 99% confidence interval (i.e., 
p-value is less than 0.01) to demonstrate how the decision 
tree is used to discover the correlations in the form of tree 
and rules.  
First, the collected data was imported into Orange. Next, 
it was connected to the other widgets (i.e., Select Columns, 
Tree, Test & Score and Tree Viewer). In the “Select 
Columns” widget, the TCM body constitution “qi-
deficiency” and the postnatal symptom “dizziness” were set 
as input and output, respectively. Finally, we obtained the 
decision tree model (in Figure 1) with an overall 
classification accuracy of 72.7%.

In this output of the decision tree model, we discovered 
three relationships between qi-deficiency and dizziness by 
following the paths from the root node to the leaf nodes. 
These paths are represented in the form of IF-THEN rules, 
where n refers to the number of participants who matched the  
following rules:  
Rule 1: IF qi-deficiency = “tends to Yes” THEN 
dizziness = “No” (n = 31, accuracy = 83.8%) 
Rule 2: IF qi-deficiency = “No” THEN dizziness = 
“No” (n = 40, accuracy = 78.4%) 
Rule 3: IF qi-deficiency = “Yes” THEN dizziness = 
“Yes” (n = 25, accuracy = 56.8%) 
In addition to the one-to-one correlation between qi-
deficiency and dizziness discovered by Pearson’s Chi-square 
test, a decision tree can define multiple inputs to find 
whether the output attribute (i.e., dizziness) is correlated to 
one or more input attributes. From Table IV, we found that 
dizziness is not only strongly correlated to qi-deficiency, but 
it is also correlated to the other six imbalanced TCM body 
constitution types. Instead of setting one input attribute in the 
decision tree, we set all eight imbalanced TCM body 
constitution types as input to predict the postnatal dizziness. 
Among the eight imbalanced TCM body constitution 
types, qi-deficiency was selected as the root node (i.e., best 
predictor) with the highest information gain. The leaf node 
with the highest classification accuracy and number of 
samples was extracted from the rightmost part of the tree and 
shown in Figure 2. The leaf node shows that all women with 
multiple TCM body constitution types: qi-deficiency, special 
diathesis and tends to phlegm-damp were suffering from 
dizziness in the postnatal period. This proved that dizziness 
is related to multiple TCM body constitution types instead of 
one only. Since there were over 60% of women with 
multiple body constitution types and different prenatal 
conditions, a decision tree with multiple input attributes is 
the better way to predict postnatal problems.  
In order to discover more possible prenatal factors that 
cause the postnatal problems, a decision tree and two other 
supervised data mining algorithms were applied to our data, 
including the attributes of TCM body constitution, 
demographics, maternal health information and delivery 
information, collected from the prenatal period to predict the 
postnatal problems. The independent (i.e., input) and 
dependent (i.e., output) attributes are listed in Table II. 
C. Significant Patterns with Data Mining Algorithms 
Supervised data mining was used to discover significant 
patterns from prenatal and postnatal data. The classification 
accuracies of predicting 36 postnatal problems, as shown in 
Table II, are reported in Figure 3. The classification accuracy 
of each postnatal problem (target attribute) in the decision 
tree, SVM and ANN are indicated by blue triangle dot, red 
circle dot and grey cross, respectively. 
Half of the postnatal problems can be predicted with 
classification accuracy over 70%, and the postnatal problem 
no. 36 (i.e., frequent nighttime urination) has the highest 
classification accuracy of 92.27%. Overall, the average 
accuracies of the three supervised data mining algorithms are 
above 64%, and SVM has the highest average accuracy of 
73.07%. 
To predict the postnatal problem of frequent nighttime 
urination, the ROC curves of the decision tree, SVM and 
neural network are given in Figure 4. It shows the 
performance of neural network is the best among three with 
higher AUC, followed by decision tree, and lastly SVM.

After consulting the TCM practitioner, four postnatal 
problems, including dizziness, prolonged lochia, tiredness, 
and emotional depression, were identifisssed as important to 
clinical care after pregnancy. We used a decision tree to 
discover the correlations between these postnatal problems 
and prenatal factors because it can show the results in terms 
of readable rules which are understandable by TCM 
practitioners.

1) Classification Rules of Dizziness 
As mentioned earlier, dizziness is highly correlated to 
multiple TCM body constitution types. From Rule 1.1 to 
Rule 1.4, we can predict if a woman will suffer from 
dizziness after pregnancy related to five prenatal factors: 1) 
the number of TCM body constitution type, 2) TCM body 
constitution types (including qi-stagnation, Yang-deficiency, 
Yi-deficiency and special diathesis), 3) blood type, 4) living 
environment, and 5) number of days of menstruation before 
pregnancy.  
Rule 1.1: IF the number of TCM body constitution types 
> 5 THEN postnatal problem = “dizziness” (n = 13, 
accuracy = 86.7%) 
Rule 1.2: IF the number of TCM body constitution types 
≤ 5 AND blood type = “AB, O or unknown” AND living 
environment = “Above the hill” THEN postnatal problem 
= “dizziness” (n = 5, accuracy = 100%) 
Rule 1.3: IF the number of TCM body constitution types 
≤ 5 AND days of menstruation ≤ 7 AND living 
environment ≠ “above the hill”, THEN postnatal problem 
≠ “dizziness” (n = 85, accuracy = 80.2%) 
Rule 1.4: IF the number of TCM body constitution types 
≤ 5 AND TCM body constitution type = “qi-stagnation, 
Yang-deficiency, Yi-deficiency or special diathesis” 
AND days of menstruation ≤ 7 AND living environment 
≠ “above the hill”, THEN postnatal problem ≠ 
“dizziness” (n = 18, accuracy = 100%) 
By comparing Rule 1.3 and Rule 1.4, we observed that 
when the additional factor, TCM body constitution, is 
considered when predicting dizziness, it can yield higher 
accuracy. Hence, the TCM body constitution is an important 
factor that can affect the accuracy of predicting dizziness.  
2) Classification Rules of Prolonged Lochia 
Prolonged lochia is the third most common postnatal 
problem in this study, and the abnormal duration of bleeding 
can be suspected as infection. According to Rule 2.1 to Rule 
2.4, we can detect this problem in the prenatal period by 
observing seven prenatal factors: 1) TCM body constitution 
type (special diathesis and qi-stagnation), 2) days of period 
cycle, 3) traditional rituals (avoid all cold/raw food), 4) 
tongue coating, 5) EDD, 6) blood type and 7) dysmenorrhea 
before or after menstruation.  
Rule 2.1: IF TCM body constitution type (special 
diathesis) ≠ “tends to Yes” AND avoid all cold/raw food 
= “No” THEN postnatal problem = “prolonged lochia” (n 
= 53, accuracy = 81.5%) 
Rule 2.2: IF TCM body constitution types ≠ “qi-
stagnation or special diathesis” AND avoid all cold/raw 
food = “No” AND days of period cycle > 31 THEN 
postnatal problem = “prolonged lochia” (n = 25, accuracy 
= 100%) 
Rule 2.3: IF TCM body constitution type (special 
diathesis) = “tends to yes” AND EDD = “spring or 
summer” THEN postnatal problem ≠ “prolonged lochia” 
(n = 7, accuracy = 100%) 
Rule 2.4: IF TCM body constitution (special diathesis) ≠ 
“tends to yes” AND avoid all cold/raw food = “Yes” 
AND blood type = “O or unknown” AND dysmenorrhea 
= “occurred before or after menstruation” THEN 
postnatal problem ≠ “prolonged lochia” (n = 7, accuracy 
= 100%) 
3) Classification Rules of Emotional Depression 
Emotional depression is one of the top 10 postnatal 
problems, and it is a type of mood disorder associated with 
childbirth. It can negatively affect the mother, her family and 
newborn child. This problem can be detected by monitoring 
five factors: 1) TCM body constitution type, 2) blood vessel 
under the tongue, 3) days of menstruation, 4) menses, and 5) 
dysmenorrhea based on Rule 4.1 to Rule 4.4: 
Rule 4.1: IF days of menstruation > 4 AND age of the 
first menses ≠ “11–12” AND TCM body constitution 
type (qi-deficiency) = “yes or tends to yes” THEN 
postnatal problem = “Emotional depression” (n = 31, 
accuracy = 81.6%)  
Rule 4.2: IF menses with blood clot = “no” AND 
menses colour ≠ “bright red or pale red” AND age of first 
menses = “11-12” AND TCM body constitution type (qi-
deficiency) = “yes or tends to yes” THEN postnatal 
problem = “Emotional depression” (n = 7, accuracy = 
87.5%) 
Rule 4.3: IF TCM body constitution type = “complex, 
unclassified, Yang-deficiency or Yi-deficiency” AND qi-
deficiency = “no” THEN postnatal problem ≠ “Emotional 
depression” (n = 29, accuracy = 90.6%) 
Rule 4.4: IF Menses colour = “bright red or pale red” 
AND Age of first menses = “11–12” AND TCM body 
constitution type (qi-deficiency) = “yes or tends to yes” 
THEN postnatal problem ≠ “Emotional depression” (n = 
5, accuracy = 100%) 
IV. DISCUSSION 
In this study, we found that 92.42% of the women 
suffered from four or more different health problems after 
childbirth. Women with “gentleness” body constitution type 
tended to have less postnatal discomfort; the finding was 
consistent with the TCM theory that individuals with 
balanced body constitution are more likely to stay healthy 
even in the stressful postnatal period. Contrarily, women 
with imbalanced TCM body constitution were found to have 
more postnatal problems, among which qi-deficiency and 
blood stagnation had the worse postnatal profiles.  
In our analysis, several factors were found to predict the 
outcome of dizziness. However, some factors, such as the 
week of childbirth, duration of period cycle and menses 
volume, were unmodifiable. Other factors, namely traditional 
rituals and the intake of calcium supplements could be 
changed easily through prenatal education and advice. 
Additionally, although TCM body constitution is constant 
and not easily changed at once, it can be adjusted in the long 
run through lifestyle modification, nutrition, exercise and 
herbal medications. Therefore, we believe that by knowing 
individuals’ body constitution and their prenatal habits could 
potentially improve women’s postnatal health. 
There are several limitations to our study. First, the study 
was conducted in Hong Kong, and only women with Chinese 
ethnicity were invited; therefore, the findings may not be 
generalizable. Second, the correlations between TCM body 
constitution and postnatal problems were not one-to-one 
relationships; in both Pearson’s Chi-square test and the three 
supervised data mining algorithms (SVM, decision tree and 
artificial neural networks), we can only set one attribute (one 
of the postnatal problems) as output at one time. Third, TCM 
body constitution is potentially adjustable before pregnancy; 
a future study can be conducted on the prediction of the other 
disease entities [13][14], especially emotional depression. 
Additional factors can be collected from Western medical 
records for building a better predictive model.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this study, we discovered that women with imbalanced 
TCM body constitution were more likely to suffer from 
postnatal health problems. Some body constitution types and 
prenatal habits were predictive of certain common and 
important postnatal symptoms, which were believed to be 
modifiable. Supervised data mining has been demonstrated 
as a useful way to discover correlations between multiple 
prenatal conditions (especially body constitutions) and 
postnatal problems. After discovering the significant 
correlations in terms of classification rules, the future step is 
to predict postnatal problems before childbirth. By using the 
associations between body constitution and postnatal 
problems in Table IV and the classification rules in Section 
III C), the TCM practitioners can apply early interventions, 
such as medicine, acupuncture, suggesting nutrition or 
supplements, to adjust individuals’ body constitution and 
prevent the postnatal problems during the prenatal period, or 
even before pregnancy.
