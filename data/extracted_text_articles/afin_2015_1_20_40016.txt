Abstract—It is a long-held belief that human personality affects
the preferred locations of humans. We used statistical regression
analysis in this research to examine the relationship between
human personality and favored locations. The personality data
is represented in accordance with the Big Five Factor (BFF) and
location data was acquired from smartphone apps used by the
volunteers. Instead of using raw location data, a total of 11,154
location datum was collected and then subject to further, more
detailed categorization. The categorized location data were then
classiﬁed into a higher-level aggregation. Finally, the relationship
and the statistical results from regression analysis are presented,
alongside categorized and classiﬁed location data. A summary of
the relationship is provided, whereas a Coefﬁcient of Determinant
(CoD) is used for the results of the regression analysis.
Keywords–Personality; Favorite location; Regression analysis,
Personality-location relationship, Big Five Factors.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The actions of humans can be predicted by time, personal-
ity factors, occupation, gender, and so on. Among these factors,
human personality factors are typically fundamental in the
prediction of human behavior, especially location preference.
In this research, the effect that personality factors exert on
a human’s preferred location was examined. The ﬁve-factor
model (FFM), a representative theoretical framework for un-
derstanding human personality, is comprised of the Big Five
Factor (BFF), which can be obtained by using the Big Five In-
ventory (BFI) questionnaire set [1]. For this research, the BFFs
of the 14 volunteer participants were obtained anonymously.
Nowadays, smartphones can be used to easily collect loca-
tion or position data. Numerous smartphone functions includ-
ing Global Positioning System (GPS), GLONASS, and indoor
positioning systems are used for positioning, and humans can
use smartphone apps to easily check-in wherever they are
located. The most popular location apps are Foursquare and
Swarm. This location data can be categorized into higher-level
categories using the categories-id; for example, Vietnamese
restaurant and Japanese restaurant can be categorized in the
higher-level category of Restaurant, while Coffee house and
Milk tea shop can be categorized in Beverage store. These
categories can be identiﬁed by the categories-id. However, for
the purpose of detailed research, lower-level categories are also
used in this paper.
Regression analysis [2] was a helpful tool for examining
the relationship between BFF and the categorized locations.
Collected data sets were formed as variables for the re-
gression analysis. In this research, an examination of the
relationship between human personality and location prefer-
ence was conducted. Apart from other research, regression
analysis on personality data and location data were utilized.
Mobile services which are strongly dependent on location can
utilize the beneﬁt of this research. For example, the result
of this research will be applied for recommendation system
which recommends a speciﬁc travelers attraction to a person
with certain personality. A possible scenario is that a travel
recommendation system based on our approach, which can
match the traveler’s personality with a property of travelers’
attractions and can recommend a speciﬁc travelers attraction
which ﬁts the traveler’s personality.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II will discuss
about related works on location and personality. In Section III,
personality data, location data, and the categories of locations
are described as parts of the preparation for the regression
analysis. Section IV will analyze the results of the regression
analysis and will present examples of the way in which the
BFF affects locations. Section V will present the conclusion
and possible future research topics.

RELATED WORKS
There has been little research into how our personality
relates to the categories of place that we visit. There are
mainly two reasons. The ﬁrst one is related with personal
information protection, meaning peoples do not like to totally
reveal personal information and only volunteers help to collect
personality data without any legal problem. The second one
is that the use of mobile device is not general at all, even
though the smartphones are widely spread. This restricts the
collection of location data. Therefore, only volunteers with
mobile devices can provide their personality data and location
data. Despite of these barriers of data collection, several related
researches have found in last few years.
The relationship between social network and human per-
sonality are conducted in [3]. The effect of human personality
on Facebook usage is researched. Self-report of participants
are used to extract object criteria and measurements from
Facebook data, and the result shows that strong relationship
between human personality and actions on Facebook.
Location Based Social Networks (LBSN) are being started
in this research area nowadays. One of the research [4]
is mostly related to our research. Personality factors and
foursquare check-ins are investigated and utilized, and the re-
lationship is founded. Conscientiousness, Openness, and Neu-
roticism are found related to speciﬁc locations in this research.

As a result of this research, the combination of personality
factors and LBSN can explain the human personality.
Regression analysis on personality data and location data
can be rarely found as shown in [5] in order to predict the
future human location with ﬁve volunteers’ data and Back
Propagation Network (BPN). An opposite of this research
can be found in [6] which deduces personality factors form
location data of volunteers. BFFs can be deduced from sets of
location data also by BPN. Apart from the other researches,
our research is a direct match between BFF (personality) and
location categories. Personality data and location data collected
by volunteers themselves are used with minimal treatment of
the raw data.
In the next sections we will present our method to reveal
the relationship between personality and location preference.
III.
PERSONALITY AND LOCATION DATA PREPARATION
Two different assortments of location data will be ad-
dressed in this section. The ﬁrst method is a classiﬁcation of lo-
cation data. From the location data source, several information
such as frequency of visit, name of location, category-id will be
extracted. The second method is the categorization of location
data. From the location data source, several information such
as frequency of visit, name of location, name of location cat-
egories will be extracted. Note that categorization of location
data is a more ramiﬁcation of location data comparing to
classiﬁcation of location data.
Total fourteen volunteers provided their personality and lo-
cation information. All volunteers are anonymous for personal
information protection and called by their numbers. Most of
the volunteers are university students and are in their twenties.
University students tend to go out lively and visits university,
restaurant, and other places frequently. BFF of each volunteer
is identiﬁed by BFI. Due to the nature of volunteers that they
are university students, places in university campus are taken
special care and categorized as detail as possible.

A. Personality data
Research has been conducted on the various theories that
seek to represent human personality. Among these theories,
McCrae and Costa’s [7] research on BFF is one of the foremost
studies on personality representation, whereby the ﬁve factors
are Openness (O), Conscientiousness (C), Extraversion (E),
Agreeableness (A), and Neuroticism (N). This distinguished
Five Factor Model (FFM) is composed with BFF which can
be obtained by Big Five Inventory (BFI) [8]. In order to obtain
BFF of volunteers, volunteers answer the questionnaire set
called BFI which is usually composed of 44 questions and
the answers are selections of a degree from one to ﬁve. The
BFI is designed to calculate every ﬁve factors of BFF from
a combination of degrees of the 44 answers.
The degree
of each ﬁve factor is designed to be represented from one
to ﬁve. A major merit of BFF is that the factors can be
quantized and it reﬂects the concept of normal distribution, i.e.,
each quantitative factor is in a numerical form that stands for
positions of normal distribution. Due to the properties of BFF,
corresponding numerical data can be utilized by any algorithm
and, of course, it can be applied to regression analysis as
shown in this research. It is notable that each factor of BFF is
mutually orthogonal, which stands that factors do not interfere
each other and thus can be used as independent variables in
regression analysis.

Table I shows BFFs for 14 volunteers, and the values can
be used to easily interpret the personality of a human. For
example, in Table I, Volunteer 4 has the highest Openness
rating among the 14 volunteers, implying that this volunteer
is highly creative in the arts, highly intellectual, curious, and
adventurous. The other BFF ratings of volunteer 4 imply
planning skills, propensity for action, and diligence in regard to
work. Volunteer 6 has the highest Extraversion rating, implying
an energetic, verbose, and positive-minded personality.
The above BFF of Volunteers data set will be used for this
research henceforth.

B. Classiﬁcation of location data
Location data, as different from positioning data, represent
conceptual locations such as home, restaurant, school, and
so on. Positioning data is typically numerical data, including
latitudinal and longitudinal pairs. The location data in this
research were collected using the smartphone apps named
Foursquare and Swarm. Volunteers checked-in on their pre-
ferred app whenever they visited a meaningful location. The
app then collated the location data based on the source data
provided by the volunteers, including count of visit (CoV),
the location’s name, and the categories-id. Table II shows a
sample of location data from volunteer 1 as an example of the
data representation of this study.
In Table II, both the formal and numerical forms of the
location information are presented; for example, two visits

were made to a location named Hongik Univ.T-819, which
has a predeﬁned categories-id of 4bf58dd8d48988dla8941735.
According to the Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation, higher
categories can be created by merging subcategories using
the categories-id; for example, Vietnamese restaurant and
Japanese restaurant can be merged into the higher category
of Restaurant. In another case, Coffee house and Milk tea
shop can be merged into Beverage Store, which is a higher
level category also classiﬁed in the Standard Industrial Clas-
siﬁcation. Using Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation prepared
by the National Tax Service and the Industry Classiﬁcation
Code (ICC), locations can be classiﬁed into higher-level ICC
categories. Table III shows several samples of the location
classiﬁcations using the data from Volunteer 1. Table III
shows the categories-id, the names of the classiﬁed cate-
gories, and the ICC; for example, Hongik Univ. T-819’s
categories-id is 4bf58dd8d48988d19e941735, and after it was
merged into Institutions of Education, a higher classiﬁcation,
the corresponding ICC became 8530. Similarly, categories-
id 4bf58dd8d48988d182941735 was merged into Theme Park
Operations with an ICC of 9121.
Table IV shows extracts of CoV values to each ICC; for
example, one visit was made to the ICC location of 4712 and
22 visits were made to the ICC location of 5611. Table II,
Table III, and Table IV show the sequence of the location-
classiﬁcation process for Volunteer 1.
It was necessary to arrange all of the data from the
14 volunteers in the same way. Table V summarizes the
classiﬁcation results of every volunteer. The meanings of the
location-classiﬁcation acronyms in Table V are:
•
FI = Foreign Institutions
•
RB = Retail Business
•
TI = Travel Industry
•
BS = Beverage Store
•
PAI = Public Administration Institutions
•
LS = Leasing Service
•
IE = Institutions of Education
•
CH = Concert Hall
•
LM = Library, Museum
•
SF = Sports Facilities
•
TP = Theme Park
•
BB = Beauty Business
Every number in Table V represents the ratio of visits
according to ( 1), as follows:
V isitingRatio(loc)
=
count of visit to(loc)
total count of visit
(1)
where loc is one of the locations in Table V.
For example, the CoV of Volunteer 1 to Foreign Institute is
89, while the total CoV is 593; therefore, visiting ratio (FI) =
0.15008. As shown in Table V, Volunteer 1 has a visiting ratio
of 0.15008 for Foreign Institute. In the case of Concert Hall,
Table V shows zero values for Volunteer 6 and Volunteer 7,
while other volunteers have a non-zero visiting ratio, meaning
that more than one visit was made.

C. Categorization of location data
From the source check-in data, each location category
was parsed, extracting the CoV, the location name, and the
categories-name. Table VI shows several of the extracted
samples, including one example where 58 visits were made
to a location named Hongik Univ.T, which is categorized as
University Buildings.
Instead of considering each location with the standards
of location classiﬁcation, the CoV was aggregated for each
categories-name as shown in Table VII. Table VII shows CoV
according to non-overlapped categories-name. Also, Table VII
has more detailed information for Volunteer 1 than Table III;
for example, bus terminals are clearly separated from train
stations, i.e., categorized rather than classiﬁed. An interpre-
tation of Table VII shows that Volunteer 1 visited Home 80
times, University Buildings 76 times, and Korean Restaurant
39 times. The sample data shown in Table VI and Table VII
was collected only from Volunteer 1. Table VII shows the
location data only from volunteer 1, meaning that there is a
total of 14 similar tables for each volunteer.
In sum, 96 categories-names were derived from the data of
the 14 volunteers with some overlapping of categories-names.
After the Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation and ICC, location
categories with a total CoV less than 10 for all volunteers were
merged into Etc. category. The ﬁnal data set consists of 55
categories-names of the 14 volunteers and provided dependent
variables for the regression analysis.

RELATIONSHIP RESULT ANALYSIS
In this section, two sorts of location data set from Sec-
tion III will be regarded as two sets of dependent variables.
Corresponding results will be addressed.
A. Regression analysis on location classiﬁcations
A basic regression analysis was conducted to further de-
velop the examination. Each volunteers’ BFF values, as shown
in Table I, was regarded as an independent variable. The
location information, as shown in Table V, was regarded as a
dependent variable. The regression analysis showed the effect
of personality on location preference. The basic result is shown
in Table VIII using Coefﬁcient of Determination (CoD).
Table VIII contains the following acronyms:
•
CoD = Coefﬁcient of Determination
•
IE = Institutions of Education
•
PAI = Public Administration Institutions
The relationship between each variable can be represented
by CoD. In Table IX, the range of CoD and the interpretations
of relationships are presented. In cases where the CoD value
is higher than 0.4, the relationship was considered to be high.
According to this criteria, a case with a CoD value higher than
0.4 was regarded as one in which the personality and location
are meaningfully related.

Table VIII shows location classiﬁcations and the cor-
responding CoD. The location classiﬁcations of Restaurant,
Bank, Public Administration Institutions, Leasing Service, In-
stitutions of Education, and Beauty Business show CoD values
higher than 0.4, meaning that only 6 classiﬁcations showed a
meaningful relationship between personality and location.
It may be meaningful to see the effect of the subcategories
of the location classiﬁcations. The next subsection will show
the results for location categories.
B. Regression analysis on location categories
The regression analysis on location categories found a
higher number of meaningful relationships. BFF values, as
shown in Table I, were also used as an independent variable,
while the total 55 location categories were used as a dependent
variable. The regression analysis showed that 31 location
categories had a CoD higher than 0.4, indicating a meaningful
relationship between personality and location.

Table X shows a selection of meaningful results from the
regression analysis and, in addition to the CoD, a coefﬁcient
for Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness,
and Neuroticism (O, C, E, A, N) was used.
The coefﬁcient of O, C, E, A, N shows the degree of
personality’s effect on corresponding location categories. First,
the absolute value of each coefﬁcient stands for the strength
of affection: positive coefﬁcient means positive effect, while
negative coefﬁcient means negative effect.
The criteria of each coefﬁcient are determined to be relative
when the absolute value of the coefﬁcient is more than 0.01,
and strongly related when the absolute value coefﬁcient is
more than 0.1. Table X contains a column titled RELATION
which represents the effect of personality on the location
categories. The RELATION column shows the ﬁnal results of
this research. As a factor of meaningfulness, the plus sign (+)
stands for the positive relation to the corresponding location,
and the minus sign (-) stands for the negative relation to the
corresponding location. For the strong positive relation, (++)
is used, while the strong negative relation is indicated with the
use of (- -). In addition, p-value must be considered. Once p-
value is greater than 0.05 for a relation, the personality factor
will be statistically disregarded and will not be presented in
RELATION column.
As an example, University Buildings have an O, C, E,
A, N coefﬁcient of -0.13274, 0.07956, 0.01043, 0.00477,
0.21439, respectively. Openness and Neuroticism, which are
also two factors of BFF, show an absolute value more than
0.1; therefore, - -O and ++N show that Openness strongly
affects the location of University Buildings positively and
Neuroticism strongly affects University Buildings negatively.
Conscientiousness and Extraversion have coefﬁcient values
more than 0.01 but lower than 0.1; therefore, +C and +E are
also applicable to the location category of University Building.
Overall, the corresponding relationship column may contain -
-O, +C, +E, and ++N. However, +C and +E must be excluded
since their corresponding p-values are greater than 0.05.
Some of the RELATION columns are remained blank
because the corresponding relation is negligible, whereby the
coefﬁcients of O, C, E, A, N are less than 0.01. The corre-
sponding locations may be related to BFF since CoD is bigger
than 0.4; however, the corresponding coefﬁcient for each BFF
is less than 0.01. For example, in the case of Museum, the
coefﬁcients for O, C, E, A, N are 0.00250，0.0008，0.00402,
-0.00828, -0.00541, respectively. Even though Agreeableness
has the largest absolute coefﬁcient value, implying a negative
relationship, it is not shown.
In terms of restaurants, categories such as Korean Restau-
rant, Asian Restaurant, and Japanese Restaurant sometimes
showed a strong relationship with BFF, while American
Restaurant and Italian Restaurant showed a more minor rela-
tionship with BFF. This phenomenon might have been affected
by CoV, which suggests that more data needs to be collected.
As shown in Table VII, the highest CoVs can be seen for
Home and University, which is unsurprising considering that
most of the volunteers were students at the time of the study.
However, in Table X, University-related locations are present,
while a Home location is not. The CoD for Home is less than
0.4, so maybe the location Home has a neutral relationship with
human personality. Such a large CoV for University, University
Buildings, University Library, University Lab, and University
Stores should be categorized and more closely investigated.
Table X has the highest CoD for University Buildings of
0.87732, and O and N are RELATED for University Buildings.
A similar BFF pattern could possibly be found for workers’
ofﬁces. In the case of Fast Food Shop, which has a CoD of
0.75860, negative Extraversion have relations but they are not
strong.
From the results in Table X, Openness, Extraversion and
Neuroticism are affective factors for location visit while Con-
scientiousness is the negligible factor for location visit. Maybe
the more data will reveal more relationship between BFF and
locations since it cannot be guaranteed that our data covers
all possible locations or covers all possible combinations of
personality factors.
V.
CONCLUSION
Regression analysis is usually an acceptable tool to use
when deducing statistical ﬁtness in a linear relationship be-
tween independent and dependent variables. BFF values were
used as independent variables in our research, while catego-
rized and classiﬁed location data were regarded as dependent
variables. The result of the regression analysis is meaning-
ful and, for several locations, the effect of personality was
revealed. It is meaningful that we used a scientiﬁc method,
instead of relying on conjecture, to identify the effect of
personality on several speciﬁc locations. We also identiﬁed
an aspect of the functional relationship between human per-
sonality and location preference.
Our research can be applied to many of related areas
in order to increase imposed value of each area, such as
enhancement of mobility model [9][10], personal travel rec-
ommendation system [11], mobile computing [12] and so on.
The key is personalized future Internet, especially for location
based social network related area.
An implication of this relationship emerged after the basic
stage of our research, when we had obtained 2,842 location
datum. Eventually, the total of 11,154 location datum was used
to provide more meaningful research results. It is possible
that, if more volunteer participants check-in at more locations,
further insight into the personality-location relationship will be
gained.
However, our research is likely to have biased results in two
reasons. Even though we collected enough number of locations
visited, only 14 volunteers are participating and we have a
small set of BFFs comparing to the size of location data. It is
an unavoidable bias and will be solved with more volunteers
are involved as we continue our research. Sometimes the bias
can be intentional supposing the travel recommendation system
which we mentioned as an application, where travelers can be
considered mostly. The second bias is that most of our volun-
teers are university students, which leads to lots of check-ins
to university buildings. Due to this bias, however, we obtained
meaningful results on the relationship between personality and
university buildings. Since we continue collecting more BFFs,
we expect that more distinct relationship can be found.
The more proper method of our research may be stepwise
regression. Independent application of independent variable
from BFF by stepwise regression will give more clear result

about the effect of each personality factors on location prefer-
ence based on the orthogonality of each ﬁve factor.
One more possible research would include temporal in-
formation as well as location information. The check-in time
and check-in duration will provide more information about the
mobility pattern of each volunteer and our understanding of
the personality-location relationship will become more precise.
The inclusion of other personal factors in future research,
including occupation, income, and gender, studies will give
keener insight into this relationship.
