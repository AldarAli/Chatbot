Abstract—This paper discusses the design of an engine to 
simulate a Very high-rate Power Line Communication (VPLC) 
infrastructure that handles up to a rate of 400 Mbps. The 
simulation engine complies with the ISO/IEC 12139-1 standard 
for power line communication protocols. The engine can be 
used as one of the access network elements deployed in the 
advanced metering infrastructure in a smart grid. We first 
propose a feasible system model of VPLC in line with the 
design goals with pre-simulations, i.e., an event-driven 
simulation and a timing-driven simulation. Next, we design a 
semiconductor Intellectual Property (IP) core, focusing on the 
implementation of two main functional IP cores of the entire 
system: a fast Fourier transform for modulation/demodulation 
and a low-density parity-check encoder/decoder for forward-
error correction. Finally, the designed VPLC based on the 
main functional IP cores is implemented on an available FPGA 
chipset, targeting the Virtex-6 xc6vlx240T.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The Smart Grid (SG) plays a major role in achieving a 
low carbon footprint and is therefore a key component of the 
sustainable energy infrastructure. Since 2010, to achieve the 
vision of “Low carbon, green growth,” an SG test-bed has 
been built in Jeju island, Korea. Several power IT projects 
have been initiated integrating electric power technology as 
well as Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 
in five implementation areas, namely the smart power grid, 
smart consumer, smart transportation, smart renewables, and 
smart electricity service [1].  
These implementation areas have completely different 
electrical environments and use different types PLC channels. 
Therefore, to meet various technical requirements for 
different 
network 
communication 
scenarios, 
several 
protocols and advanced modulation techniques are employed 
by Power Line Communication (PLC) systems in the SG. In 
addition, both the broadband spectrum from 1.8 MHz to 30 
MHz (or 205 MHz) as well as the narrowband spectrum 
from 3 kHz to 500 kHz [2,3] are used for PLC. Advanced 
Metering Infrastructure (AMI), a typical SG application, has 
been successfully implemented using broadband high-rate 
communication at 24 Mbps over the power grid in 
compliance with the ISO/IEC 12139-1 standard, which is 
based on the Korea Standard (KS) 4600-1 [3,4].  
In Section II, we briefly introduce the specifications of 
the engine designed for Very high-rate Power Line 
Communication (VPLC) that is compliant with ISO/IEC 
12139-1, by introducing a static simulation with an event-
driven operation and a dynamic simulation with a timing 
operation. In Section III, we explain the design and 
implementation of two Intellectual Property (IP) cores, 
namely 
MOD 
(for 
the 
functions 
of 
modulation/ 
demodulation) and FEC (for the function of error correction), 
at the system level with a cycle-based design approach, 
which is based on the design methodology at a clock-based 
register transfer level. Appropriate hardware-efficient 
algorithms are selected to design the hardware architectures, 
taking into account resource constraints of timing and area. 
All the design steps are carried out using both floating-point 
and fixed-point operations to ensure design consistency from 
the system level to the architecture level. Actually, both 
floating-point and fixed-point designs are useful to obtain a 
test bench for verifying the designed digital logic block at the 
32-bit level, compared with the results of the dynamic 
simulation. Section IV explains how for a hardware gate 
level, specific functional blocks are edited by a Hardware 
Description Language (HDL), which enables the synthesis of 
logic gates in a 32-bit process. The IP cores are designed to 
support high-speed digital signal processing using a 
pipelining technique, parallelizing technique, and retiming 
technique to meet the system requirements. Finally, the main 
IP core circuit of VPLC is realized using a Field-
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and is presented on the 
prototyping board. Conclusion is presented in Section V.

SYSTEM DESIGN ISSUES FOR VPLC 
A. IP Design Issues for VPLC 
VPLC is proposed to support utility applications in the 
implementation areas of the smart consumer and the smart 
transportation. To achieve this, we design a system with the 
following basic design goals: 
 Supporting maximum rates of 200 Mbps and 400 
Mbps in a dual transmission rate mode, in the 
frequency bandwidth less than 30 MHz and less 
than 80 MHz

 Adopting a multicarrier modulation technique for 
VPLC, such as Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) 
modulation 
or 
Orthogonal Frequency-Division 
Multiplexing (OFDM) 
 Adopting a Forward Error Correction technique 
(FEC) of a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) to 
improve the link margin by 8.8 to 9.4 dB at BER = 
10-5 
 Supporting coexistence of other systems compliant 
with ISO/IEC 12139-1 (or KS 4600-1) [3, 4]. 
B. Specifications of VPLC engine 
To set the specifications of the VPLC engine, we first 
extract the main parameters from the allowable spectral 
efficiency from the typical multicarrier transmission system. 
After estimating the main parameters, we consider ways of 
improve the system performance to meet the system design 
goals. The formula to calculate the multicarrier transmission 
rate can be written as follows:

       (1) 
where Bw is the entire signal bandwidth, Bu is the usable 
signal bandwidth, M is the number of bits in each subcarrier, 
TFFT is the signal time to process a Fast Fourier Transform 
(FFT), TCP is a cyclic prefix time, and Cr is the code rate for 
error correction. For designing a feasible system, the 
required overhead has to be adjusted, which can be decided 
by the factor of a guard band (Bu/Bw), a guard interval (GI) 
time (TFFT/(TFFT + TCP)), and a code rate (Cr). When 
considering a low frequency band of 0–28 MHz, the 
available bandwidth ratio becomes 0.8667. For convenience, 
we set the number of subcarriers to 2048 and the frequency 
band to 60 MHz in a high frequency band to reach a goal of 
greater than 400 Mbps. As shown in Table I, we need to set 
the main parameters as at least 1024-QAM modulation in 
the subcarrier for OFDM/DMT, the code rate greater than 
7/8, and the guard interval time less than 2.13 μs. 
By setting these parameters, we can achieve the required 
received SNR greater than 34 dB to meet the 1% packet 
error rate requirement for a typical multicarrier transceiver 
with a simple receiver structure in an ideal additive white 
Gaussian noise channel without any reflection phenomenon, 
as shown in Fig. 1.  
 
Figure 1. Performance of a Typical Multicarrier Transceiver. 
 
Even under the real channel environment conditions of a 
power grid, it is possible to ensure more margins to meet the 
basic performance requirements. We consider additive 
techniques such as a data frame header check sequence [4] 
for minimizing the SNR, and a channel encoder [7,8] to 
protect the data frame header such as the LDPC. For 
designing an LDPC with a variable code rate of 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 
5/6, and 7/8, the system complexity can be effectively 
reduced by using the circular shift technique, considering a 
size-limited unit matrix of 24 by 24, to operate the large 
matrix of the LDPC. 
 
In addition, to improve the system reliability, we 
consider a bit-loading technique to adjust variable 
modulation selection and variable channel code-rate 
selection in the subcarriers even at the cost of the 
transmission rate. Further, to overcome the performance 
degradation due to an impulsive noise on the power grid, we 
adopt a diversity technique, i.e. repeatedly transmitting a 
signal block in the time domain and using subcarrier 
utilization in the frequency domain. In other words, to 
ensure the compliance of the given deployed transceiver to

modulation in subcarriers, forward error correction of 
RS(5,3), and 512-point FFT. Table II lists the specifications 
of VPLC. As shown in Fig. 2, the transmitted VPLC Packet 
Service Data Unit (PSDU) signal consists of a preamble 
frame, a control frame, and the rest of frames. The Delimiter 
signal has the preamble frame and the control frame. The 
Extended Delimiter has additional frames of the Long 
Symbol frame and the Data Frame Header. The Long 
Symbol consists of 2 DMT symbols and the Data Frame 
Header consists of 3 DMT symbols. The Data Frame 
consists of n DMT symbols. Each DMT symbol has 1,536 
subcarriers in the frequency band of 75 MHz. The subcarrier 
bandwidth is 48.828125 kHz, and each DMT symbol length 
is 22.72 µs, because of the addition of a cyclic prefix with 
2.24 µs for minimizing multipath channel effects. The DMT 
symbol sets to the identical field of the Delimiter signal 
according to the Class-A version of ISO/IEC 12139-1 for 
supporting the function of coexistence. The structure of the 
PSDU can be divided into the long PSDU and the short 
PSDU whether the Data Frame is included or not. 
C. System Simulation for VPLC over Power Grid 
1) Event-Driven (ED) Simulation 
According to the proposed specification of VPLC, we 
first develop the ED simulator by using C++ to check the 
feasibility. The ED simulator can be independently operated 
by appropriate selection of the inter-frame types in PSDU. 
The transmit data, generated from a Medium Access Control 
(MAC) layer, pass through the first functional block viz. the 
scrambler that removes the unique pattern of the transmit 
data. In the following FEC block of LDPC, the transmit data 
is encoded to prevent data redundancy. At the Mapper block, 
the encoded data stream is converted to the bit-to-symbol 
data for the purpose of allotting it into each subcarrier. Next, 
the sequence of data is added to process the modulation step 
by using Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) [6], giving 
an orthogonal property between subcarriers. The rest of the 
transmit signals except a Preamble signal are added by a 
Cyclic Prefix sequence to minimize the effect of an Inter-
Symbol Interference (ISI) in the communication link channel. 
At the receiver side, the receive signal can be recognized by 
adding the Carrier Sensing block for detecting the signal 
frame, and by synchronizing the symbol to the starting point 
of the DMT symbol. Through the Windowing block, the size 
of the received signal sequence is reformatted to the length 
of FFT, and then it is demodulated through the FFT block.  
First of all, using the Long symbol, the receiver estimates the 
status of the given channel and compensates a timing error 
caused by the difference in the clock frequencies of the 
digital-to-analog 
converter 
and 
the 
analog-to-digital 
converter. The Demapper computes the log-likelihood ratio 
in each binary data. The LDPC decoder corrects the channel 
errors by using the parity information. Finally, in the 
descrambler block, the transmitted signal can be recovered. 
In this simulation, we use a conventional power line channel 
model such as a wireless Rayleigh channel model [5] as 
follows:

where i is the number of paths, gi is a weighting factor, k is 
an attenuation factor of exponent, a0 and a1 are attenuation 
parameters, and d1 is the length of the path [5]. Fig. 3 shows 
communication performance of the proposed VPLC in the 
ED simulation for the Rayleigh channel model in (2) with 
the parameter of time = 2.5 e-9 s and 10 paths. It meets the 
minimum communication requirement of the signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) of about 28 dB to guarantee the rate of 400 
Mbps. Without any FEC, to guarantee the rate of 400 Mbps, 
an SNR greater than approximately 37 dB is required.  
2) Timing-Driven (TD) Simulation 
The ED simulation is for a static design approach, 
whereas the TD simulation is for a more specific timing 
design approach, which operates in a symbol time basis. The 
GUI environment of the TD simulator is developed by using 
the S/W tool of the Simulink and the Matlab of MathWorks. 
The sample values can be analyzed and verified by both 
floating-point and fixed-point numerals, which support 
functional features required to design the architecture for 
controlling each parameter of the structural elements in the 
VPLC system. Besides, the status of the current signal 
stream can be checked by plotting the transmission symbols 
in both time and frequency domains. Fig. 4 shows the 
symbol-by-symbol transmission from the transmitter to 
receiver and a symbol-based scattering plot. The TD 
simulator developed was found to operate satisfactorily in 
accordance with the specifications of VPLC. 
III. 
IP DESIGN ISSUES FOR VPLC 
From the simulator introduced in previous section, 
reference vectors called a test bench can be extracted for 
basically designing and testing the specific logic architecture 
of IP in the chipset. In this section, we briefly study the IP 
design issues by introducing a couple of important IP 
engines, a MOD and a FEC for the proposed VPLC system.  
A. Designing Signal Process of MOD 
The MOD is one of core engines for signal processing 
and integrating the VPLC system. The engine supports the 
modulation/demodulation function in the proposed VPLC 
system, adopting an Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplex (OFDM) technique. Functionally, the MOD maps 
binary data into OFDM signals, based on the modulation 
coefficients, by computing the 4096-point FFT. However, 
the complex 4096-point FFT may cause a bottleneck related 
its processing in a given clock time period. Therefore, a 
special architecture needs to be considered to effectively 
resolve this design problem related to timing and sizing. For 
an OFDM transmitter, the MOD can be processed by the 
Inverse FFT (IFFT) and it can be structurally designed just 
by hardwiring and switching the input and output ports of 
the FFT. The typical formula of the FFT is as follows [6]:

We adopt a Decimation-In-Frequency (DIF) FFT

to have a semi-systolic parallel structure. The output

 Figs. 5 and 6 show the proposed architecture of the 
4096-point FFT with parallelizing and pipelining. When 
designing the architecture of the R4 FFT algorithm with an 
internal clock speed that takes into account the critical path 
delay by adopting the design approach of a Single-path 
Delay Commutator (SDC) with a pipelined architecture. This 
architecture has the advantage of improving the utilization of 
the Butterfly module used to compute the complex 
multiplication performed repeatedly in each stage of the 
4096-FFT. Each element of the Butterfly module consists of 
a 4-point DFT process.

Figure 6. Architecture of the Basic R4 Butterfly Module in i th Stage in 
FFT. 
 
Furthermore, to reduce the buffer size of the SDC, we 
logically design a RAM-type SDC to minimize quantization 
errors without any changes to the hardware architecture. By 
varying the magnitude of the input signal in the 4096-point 
FFT, the number of fixed point numerals can be 
automatically controlled. These are done in the front 
element of the data analysis process, which can be simply 
designed as a look-up table. In each stage, we consider 
controlling a variable twiddle-factor generator and complex 
multiplication with a fast complex adder. To reduce the 
complexity 
of 
the 
4096-point 
FFT 
chip-level 
implementation, the basic functional blocks are shared. By 
sharing, the utilization factor can be increased up to 75% for 
the computation of complex multiplications. We obtain the 
result of the physical timing simulation and a Netlist of 
synthesized logic gate for targeting the Xilinx Vertex-6 chip. 
For verification of the design, we perform a harness test 
between the input/output signal results of the upper design 
layer with floating point values and that of the lower design 
layer with fixed point values. Furthermore, the input/output 
signals with binary data from the result of the HDL timing 
simulation are also verified with the harness test using the 
test bench of the outputs from the TD simulator. 
B. Designing Signal Process of FEC 
We design a FEC core engine by using a LDPC, which 
has features of the parity-check matrix with code rates of 
1/2, 2/3, 3/4, (4/5), 5/6, (6/7), 7/8 and with code words of 
576, 864, 1152, (1440), 1728, (2016), 2304. When 
designing the FEC, the LDPC uses a very large parity-check 
matrix for improving the decoding performance. In addition, 
it has different code rates in the proposed specification for 
VPLC. It means that the structure of the LDPC uses an 
individual parity-check matrix. Thus, it severely causes the 
problem of complexity in chip implementation. To reduce 
the complexity, the concept of sharing the function of a base 
matrix effectively is used. It can be operated adaptively 
according to the constant variation informative matrix in the 
parity-check matrix. We adopt the Richardson’s algorithm 
for designing the architecture of the parity-check matrix and 
a structure of Quasi-Cycle (QC) for the submatrix [7,8]. 
Each submatrix uses a unit matrix with the size of G × G in 
accordance with the values of a circular cyclic shift in the 
parity-check matrix. It can be expressed as 
.                    (5) 
  
Figure 7. Structure of Parity-Check Matrix of LDPC for the FEC IP. 
 
For the structure of the parity-check matrix, a 
redundancy part has a fixed length of M, and it can be 
changed from M to 7M, as shown in Fig. 7. In the part of 
redundancy, the parity vector p1T and p2T can be derived as 
follows: 
.                             (6) 
Fig. 8 shows the architecture of the LDPC encoder, 
composed of the 24 × 24 submatrix (i.e., G = 24), with the 
length of information bits of 24 × 12 × n (where n = 1–7), 
and the final code words of 24 × 12 × (n + 1). For encoder 
design, we adopt the pipelining process technique with four 
stages, supporting the 24 clocks per each stage and the 
latency of 96 clocks. As shown in Fig. 8, we use circular 
shift registers for storing and dividing the input information 
bits according to code rates at the first step in the encoder. 
We devise on an arithmetic process for computing the 
sequential multiplication of the parity-check matrix and the 
information bits, and the parity vector arithmetic process (6) 
at the second step and the third step, respectively. In the last 
step, we obtain the output combining the parity vector. In 
other words, the decoder is designed for a variable iteration 
number (n) of the pipelining architecture with 2(n + 1) + 2 
stages, 288 clocks, and 288(2n + 4) latency clocks. Besides, 
we set a stop option of iteration as necessary. The decoder 
consists of a PreDecoder with two stages, followed by a 
IterationDecoder with two stages and a ParityChecker with 
two stages, and, lastly, a Terminator with two stages, as 
shown in Fig. 9. Thus, according to the channel

can be obtained by controlling the information bits.

IMPLEMENTATION OF TEST PLATFORM 
After the back-end design of the VHLC has been 
completed, the physically synthesized logic, combined with 
the IP of MCU, a 32-bit SE3208 microprocessor, is 
mounted on the Xilinx FPGA, targeting Virtex-6 
xc6vlx240T. 
The 
test 
platform 
is 
developed 
and 
demonstrated to transfer the data with a moving picture as a 
real operation, as shown in Fig. 10. It has an operational

system configurations on the test board.  
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this study, we proposed a VPLC and demonstrated its 
feasibility of operation at a rate of more than 400 Mbps in 
the physical layer of the power grid environment. Further, 
we designed and implemented two core engines, namely the 
MOD and the FEC, necessary for simulating the VPLC 
system. We proposed and adopted the appropriate design 
algorithms and the design architecture to meet system 
specifications and requirements so that sharing main 
functional modules will reduce the system complexity and 
parallelize it effectively. All the designs were achieved by 
step-by-step verification of the front-end design. These 
designs were successfully tested on the prototyping board of 
the implemented test platform. This fundamental work is 
expected to contribute significantly to achieve the single-run 
VPLC chipset implementation.
