Abstract— The proteins representing the structures of ordered 
form in respect to their tertiary structure are discussed. The 
hydrophobic core of 3-D Gauss function (“fuzzy oil drop” 
model) appeared to be present in some proteins. The proteins 
of the structure with ordered form of vdW and/or electrostatic 
internal interaction in protein body are discussed in the paper. 
The vdW interaction distribution in proteins appeared to be 
accordant with assumed 3-D Gauss function while the 
electrostatic represents the distribution of random form. This 
characteristics allows interpretation of the tertiary structure as 
the effect of external/internal force field influence expressed by 
3-D Gauss function in respect to hydrophobic and/or vdW 
interaction. It is postulated that the additional introduction of 
3-D Gauss function representing the influence of external 
environment (in contrast to internal force field of protein 
body) in the simulation of protein folding process in silico may 
simplify the optimization procedure leading to the appropriate 
order on the level of tertiary structure of protein molecule and 
directing the hydrophobic residues toward the center of the 
protein body with the exposure of hydrophilic residues on the 
surface. The procedure minimize the differences between 
internal interactions and the idealized one expressed by 
external force field.

 INTRODUCTION 
The procedure of protein structure prediction is based on 
the search for polypeptide structure of low internal energy 
expressed mostly by side chain - side chain interaction of 
electrostatic, vdW forms. Thus the optimization procedure 
(minimization of the energy) is the most important element 
of the procedure oriented on the protein structure prediction 
especially in ab initio (new fold – according to CASP 
nomenclature – Critical Assessment of Protein Structure 
Prediction) as well as homology search based (comparative 
modeling - according to CASP nomenclature) computational 
techniques. The CASP initiative organized every second year 
is the event assumed to monitor the progress in protein 
structure prediction [1]. 
The groups of proteins representing highly ordered 
structure in respect to the hydrophobic density distribution 
have been found: downhill proteins [2], antifreeze proteins 
[3] and some proteins acting in form of homodimers [4]. The 
high accordance with the 3-D Gauss function with the 
empirically observed hydrophobicity density distribution [5] 
in protein body suggested the search for possible ordered 
force field of other character like electrostatic, dipole-
interaction oriented etc.  
This is why the analysis of the distribution of the energy 
components 
like: 
electrostatic 
interaction 
and 
vdW 
interaction additionally to hydrophobic interaction in protein 
body was undertaken. The question was, whether other than 
hydrophobic interaction represents the ordered character on 
the tertiary structure level.  
The search for the order system on the level of tertiary 
structure of proteins is presented in this work based on 
earlier 
observed 
organization 
of 
hydrophobic 
core 
organization accordant with 3-D Gauss function.

MATERIAL AND METHODS  
A. Data  
The proteins representing different status of hydrophobic 
core organization were selected for analysis (Tab. I). The 
selection of proteins was done according to the analysis of 
down-hill proteins presented in [2].

B. Energy optimization using Gromacs   
The Gromacs program was applied to run the energy 
optimization procedure to relax the crystal structure.  
All EMs (energy minimization) have been performed with 
Gromacs software package v4.0.3 and Gromos96 43a1 force 
field [12-16]. The coordinates for starting structures have 
been taken from the Protein Data Bank. In first step, all EMs 
have been compared an in vacuo model to a solvated model.

Default protonation states and hydrogen positions were 
generated by pdb2gmx utility of the Gromacs package. The 
energy optimization procedure was performed in water 
solvent. SPC water model was used [16]. The total charge of 
the molecule was null.  
The parameters for energy minimization procedure were as 
follows:  
Maximum number of iterations - 100 steps; The 
minimization was converged when the max force was 
smaller than 1000.0 kJ mol-1 nm-1; Initial step size - 0,01 
nm; Method to determine neighbour list – Grid; Treatment 
of long range electrostatic interactions – cut-off; Long range 
electrostatic cut-off - 1.0 nm; Long range van der Waals cut-
off – 1.0nm; Cut-off distance for short-range neighbour list -
1.0nm; Constraint algorithm used to restrain bond lengths – 
none;  
Frequency to update the neighbour list -10 steps;  
The individual interactions of particular residues with the 
rest of the protein molecule was performed using the 
make_ndx 
procedure 
defining 
the 
“group” 
under 
consideration and g_energy program in order to extract  data 
from output energy files. 
Each residue was taken as one group while the rest of 
protein molecule was defined as second group. The energy 
calculation was performed for each amino acid in this 
system. The set of individual interactions was standardised 
to the unit making the interaction distribution unified 
allowing the comparison with other distributions (theoretical 
and random one). 
C. “Fuzzy oil drop” model   
The assumption of this model is the accordance of 
hydrophobic (and possible other) interactions in protein 
with the idealized one expressed by 3-D Gauss function [5]. 
The procedure allowing generation of this type of force field 
is shown below. 
1) The theoretical hydrophobicity density distribution:  
The geometric center of the protein molecule is localized in 
the origin of coordinate system. The longest distance 
between two effective atoms (averaged position of atoms 
belonging to side chain) determines the orientation of the X-
axis. The longest distance between two projections (on the 
YZ-plane) of effective atoms determines the orientation of 
the Y-axis. The longest distance between elements along 
each axis in coordinate system is expressed by 3σ. The 
hydrophobicity density in each position of effective atom 
can be calculated as follows:

are the coordinates of the geometric center of 
the molecule (usually located in the origin of the coordinate 
system). This is why these values can be considered equal to 
zero. The size of the molecule is expressed by the triple σx, 
σy, σz, which is calculated for each molecule individually 
provided that the orientation of the molecule with the longest 
possible inter-effective atoms distance is determined 
according to the appropriate coordinate system axis. The σ 
values are calculated as the 1/3 of the longest distance 
between two effective atoms calculated along each axis. The 
value of the Gauss function at any point of protein body is 
treated as the idealized hydrophobic density defining the 
hydrophobic core. 
2) Observed distribution: On the other hand, the 
empirical 
hydrophobicity 
distribution 
is 
calculated 
according to the function presented by Levitt [17]:

3) Electrostatic and vdW interactions: The individual 
interactions of particular residues with the rest of the protein 
molecule was performed using the make_ndx procedure 
defining the “group” under consideration. Each residue was 
taken as one group while the rest of protein molecule was 
defined as second group. The energy calculation was 
performed for each amino acid in this system. The set of 
individual interactions was standardised to the unit making 
the interaction distribution unified allowing the comparison 
with other distributions (theoretical and random one).

To

quantitatively the accordance between the idealized and 
empirically observed distribution of the density of selected 
parameter (interaction), divergence entropy (also known as

The values of Q(i) were taken according to the 3-G values 
for the ellipsoid of particular protein. This target (reference)

function was commonly used for all types of interaction 
(electrostatic and vdW) under consideration. The values of 
P(i) expressed the density of particular type of interaction 
calculated in relation to the sum of interaction of each 
residue with the entire protein molecule. The values 
expressing particular type of interaction were standardized 
to make the sum of all values equal to 1 after the unified 
rescaling of negative and positive values. 
Since the entropy values can be interpreted only in the 
relative scale the comparison of observed distribution with 
the random one was performed. The protein of the distance 
between observed distribution (O) and theoretical one (T) 
expressed as O/T lower in relation to the distance between 
O and random distribution (R) (O/R) was treated as the 
protein of distribution accordant with expected one. 
III. 
RESULTS 
Hydrophobicity distribution: the 3-D Gauss function was 
taken as the target distribution for hydrophobic force field. 
The Kulback Leibler entropy values are given in Tab. II. All 
the proteins classified as downhill proteins appeared to 
represent the structure accordant with the idealized 
hydrophobic core. 
A. Density distribution in proteins under consideration 
The distribution profile of each component of the force 
field for selected proteins: 1HZC and1BDC are shown in 
Fig. 1 and Fig.2 respectively.  
The profiles visualize the range of similarity/discrepancy 
between expected and observed distribution. The high 
accordance between idealized hydrophobic distribution and 
observed one can be seen except 1HZC. The high 
accordance between random and observed electrostatic 
density can be seen in all cases.

The proteins characterized in Tab. II. were selected to 
represent different status in respect to the order of energy 
components distribution.  
The protein 1HZC (cold shock protein) of the form of 
compact β-barrel proteins without disulfide bonds and  
cis-proline residues has been recognized as the molecule of 
low stability [6]. The absence of ordered form of 
hydrophobic core as well as absence of any ordered form of 
internal force field seems to explain the low stability of this 
molecule (Fig.1.). 
The protein 1BDC (immunoglobulin binding domain) 
represents the mainly helical structural form [7]. According 
to the analysis presented in this paper its stability may the 
result of the ordered structure of hydrophobic core as well as 
ordered vdW internal force field (Fig. 2.).  
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The results presented in this paper suggest that the 
tertiary level organization is expressed by the ordered form 
of hydrophobic as well as vdW interaction force field. No 
regularity (random distribution) was found for electrostatic 
interaction. The local, biological function related charge 
presence (enzymatic active site) was not taken into account. 
It was aimed to analyze the non-specific distribution of 
charges (the electrostatic interaction). 
The regularity of the hydrophobicity distribution 
identified in downhill proteins (as well as in antifreeze 
proteins [3] and some homodimers [4]) suggests that the 
folding process is directed by the hydrophobic interaction in 
the form accordant with the 3-D Gauss function. The 
introduction of the external force field of 3-D Gauss function 
during the folding process simulation may facilitate the 
structure optimization process in silico. The presence of 
external force field may direct the hydrophobic residues 
toward the center of the protein body with the exposure of 
hydropholic residues on the surface [18]. The folding process 
accordant with high density of vdW interactions in the center 
of the protein molecule may additionally introduce the 
expected order of residues in the space. The “fuzzy oil drop” 
model was proved performing the molecular dynamics 
simulation of trans-membrane protein. The simulation 
performed in the presence of external force field in form of 
3-D Gauss function for hydrophobic interaction revealed 
high accordance of results with those received using the 
traditional simulation performed in the presence of 
membrane and water molecules [20]. The regression 
function comparing the results received using the explicite 
water molecules and “fuzzy oil drop” model was of the form 
y=1*x. The time consumption for “fuzzy oil drop” model 
was significantly lower in comparison with traditional 
molecular dynamics simulation in all-atoms form [20].  
The proteins representing different secondary structures 
and different biological function appeared to represent also 
different accordance with the assumed model expecting the 
density distribution of particular type of interaction 
accordant with 3-D Gauss function. The ordered distribution 
of particular type of interaction seems to generate the 
ordered internal force field probably responsible for tertiary 
stabilization. The differences between proteins of different

structural (secondary structure) characteristics of the internal 
force field suggest different mechanism of the structure 
generation. The absence of the accordance of the assumed 
order in respect to electrostatic interactions suggests low 
influence of external force field of electrostatic character. 
The discordance between the expected (3-D Gauss 
distribution) and the observed one was recognized to appear 
due to the presence of ligand (including also the protein-
protein complexation interaction area) [5]. It may suggests 
the aim-oriented local disorder related to specific biological 
function [18].
