Abstract— The main goal of this paper is a Visible Light 
Communication (VLC) based guidance system to be used by 
mobile users inside large buildings. This system is composed of 
several transmitters (ceiling luminaries), which transmit map 
information and path guidance messages. Mobile devices, with 
VLC support, decode the information. A mesh cellular hybrid 
structure is proposed. The luminaires, via VLC, deliver their 
geographic position and specific information to the users, 
making them available for whatever use they request. The 
communication protocol, coding/decoding techniques, and 
error control are examined. Bidirectional communication is 
implemented and the best route to navigate through venue 
calculated. We propose several guidance services and multi-
person cooperative localization. By analyzing the results, it 
became clear that the system not only provides self-location, 
but also the capability to determine the direction of travel and 
to interact with information received in order to optimize the 
route towards a static or dynamic destination.

INTRODUCTION 
The main goal is to specify the system conceptual design 
and define a set of use cases for a VLC based guidance 
system to be used by mobile users inside large buildings. 
The most obvious method of using guidance signs is 
through billboards located in high traffic areas. Handheld 
devices allow customers to stay 
informed, gather 
information and communicate with others without being 
tied to a physical location.  
With the rapid increase in wireless mobile devices, the 
continuous increase of wireless data traffic has brought 
challenges to the continuous reduction of radio frequency 
(RF) spectrum, which has also driven the demand for 
alternative technologies  [ 1 ][ 2 ]. In order to solve the 
contradiction between the explosive growth of data and the 
consumption of spectrum resources, VLC has become the 
development 
direction 
of 
the 
next 
generation 
communication network with its huge spectrum resources, 
high security, low cost, and so on [3][4].  
With the increasing shortage of radio frequency 
spectrum and the development of Light-Emitting Diodes 
(LEDs), VLC has attracted extensive attention. Compared to 
conventional wireless communications, VLC has higher 
rates, lower power consumption, and less electromagnetic 
interferences. VLC is a data transmission technology that 
can easily be employed in indoor environments since it can 
use the existing LED lighting infrastructure with simple 
modifications [5] [6]. The use of white polychromatic LEDs 
offers the possibility of Wavelength Division Multiplexing 
(WDM), which enhances the transmission data rate. A 
WDM receiver based on tandem a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin 
light controlled filter can be used [7] [8] to decode the 
received information. Here, when different visible signals 
are encoded in the same optical transmission path, the 
device multiplexes the different optical channels, performs 
different filtering processes (amplification, switching, and 
wavelength conversion) and finally decodes the encoded 
signals recovering the transmitted information. 
Visible light can be used as an Identifier (ID) system and 
can be employed for identifying the building itself. The 
main idea is to divide the service area into spatial beams 
originating from the different ID light sources and identify 
each beam with a unique timed sequence of light signals. 
The signboards, based on arrays of LEDs, positioned in 
strategic directions [9], are modulated acting as down- and 
up-link channels in the bidirectional communication. For the 
consumer 
services, 
the 
applications 
are 
enormous. 
Positioning, navigation, security and even mission critical 
services are possible use cases that should be implemented.  
In this paper, a VLC based guidance system to be used 
by mobile users inside large buildings is proposed. After the 
Introduction, in Section II, a model for the system is 
proposed and the communication system described. In 
Section III, the main experimental results are presented, 
downlink and uplink transmission is implemented and the 
best route to navigate calculated. In Section IV, the 
conclusions are drawn.

SYSTEM MODEL 
The system model of the proposed system will be 
presented in this section.  
 
A. 
Communication system 
The system model is composed by two modules: the 
transmitter and the receiver. The block diagram is presented 
in Figure 1. Both communication modules are software 
defined, where modulation/demodulation can be programed.

Figure 1. Block diagram.  System model of the proposed control scheme 
applied to OOK modulation.  
Data from the sender is converted into an intermediate 
data representation, byte format, and converted into light 
signals emitted by the transmitter module. The data bit 
stream is input to a modulator where an ON–OFF Keying 
(OOK) modulation is utilized. On the transmission side, a 
modulation and conversion from digital to analog data is 
done. The driver circuit will keep an average value (DC 
power level) for illumination, combining it with the analog 
data intended for communication. The visible light emitted 
by the LEDs passes through the transmission medium and is 
then received by the MUX device.  
To realize both the communication and the building 
illumination, white light tetra-chromatic sources (WLEDs) 
are used providing a different data channel for each chip. 
The transmitter and receiver relative positions are displayed 
in Figure 2a. Each luminaire is composed of four 
polichromatic WLEDs framed at the corners of a square. At 
each node, only one chip is modulated for data transmission 
(see Figure 2b), the Red (R: 626 nm¸ 25 μW/cm2), the 
Green (G: 530 nm, 46 μW/cm2), the Blue (B: 470 nm, 60 
μW/cm2) or the Violet (V, 400 nm, 150 μW/cm2). Data is 
encoded, modulated and converted into light signals emitted 
by the transmitters. Modulation and digital-to-analog 
conversion of the information bits is done using signal 
processing techniques. An OOK modulation scheme was 
used to code the information. This way digital data is 
represented by the presence or absence of a carrier wave. 
 The signal is propagating through the optical channel, 
and a VLC receiver, at the reception end of the 
communication link, is responsible to extract the data from 
the modulated light beam. It transforms the light signal into 
an electrical signal that is subsequently decoded to extract 
the transmitted information. The obtained voltage is then 
processed, by using 
signal conditioning 
techniques 
(adaptive bandpass filtering and amplification, triggering 
and demultiplexing), until the data signal is reconstructed at 
the data processing unit (digital conversion, decoding and 
decision) [10] [11]. At last, the message will be output to 
the users.

Mux device 
On the receiving side, a MUX photodetector  acts as an 
active filter for the visible region of the light spectrum. The 
integrated filter consists of a p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n 
heterostructure with low conductivity doped layers [7] as 
displayed in Figure 2c. Independent tuning of each channel 
is performed by steady state violet optical bias (bias= 2300 
μW/cm2) superimposed from the front side of the device and 
the generated photocurrent measured at -8V. The generated 
photocurrent is processed using a transimpedance circuit 
obtaining a proportional voltage. Since the photodetector 
response is insensitive to the frequency, phase, or 
polarization of the carriers, this kind of receiver is useful for 
intensity-modulated signals. After receiving the signal, it is 
in turn filtered, amplified, and converted back to digital 
format for demodulation. The system controller consists of a 
set of programmable modules. 
In this system model, there are a few assumptions that 
should be noted: The channel state information is available 
both at the receiver and the transmitter; compared with the 
direct light, the reflected light is much weaker in the indoor 
VLC systems; only the Line OF Sight (LOS) path is 
considered and the multipath influence is not considered in 
the proposed indoor VLC system.

The received channel can be expresssed as: 
 
y=μhx+n         
 
where y represents the received signal, x the transmitted 
signal, μ is the photoelectric conversion factor which can be 
normalized as μ = 1, h is the channel gain and n is the 
additive white Gaussian noise of which the mean is 0. 
The LEDs are modeled as Lambertian sources where the 
luminance is distributed uniformly in all directions, whereas 
the luminous intensity is different in all directions. The 
luminous intensity for a Lambertian source is given by 
Equation (2) [12]: 
 Iሺ∅ =IN cosሺ∅ m  ;    m=
ln⁡(2)
ln⁡(cos⁡(1/2)) 
 
IN is the maximum luminous intensity in the axial 
direction,  is the angle of irradiance and m is the order 
derived from a Lambertian pattern. For the proposed 
system, the commercial white LEDs were designed for 
illumination purposes, exhibiting a wide half intensity angle 
(1/2) of 60º. Thus, the Lambertian order m is 1. Friis’ 
transmission equation is frequently used to calculate the 
maximum range by which a wireless link can operate. The 
coverage map is obtained by calculating the link budget 
from the Friis transmission equation [13].         
The Friis transmission equation relates the received 
power (PR) to the transmitted power (PE), path loss distance 
(LR), and gains from the emitter (GE) and receiver (GR) in a 
free-space communication link. 
 
          PR [dBm]=PE [dBm]+GE [dB]+GR [dB]-LR [dB] 
 
 
(3) 
Taking into account Figure 2a, the path loss distance and 
the emitter gain will be given by:  
 
LR [dB]=22 +20ln d

With A de area of the photodetector and dE_R the distance 
between each transmitter and every point on the receiver 
plane. Due to their filtering properties of the receptors the 
gains are strongly dependent on the wavelength of the 
pulsed LEDs. Gains (GR) of 5, 4, 1.7 and 0.8 were used, 
respectively, for the R, G, B and V LEDs. IN of 730 mcd, 
650 mcd, 800 mcd and 900 mcd were considered. The 
coverage map, for a square unit cell, (see Figure 5).

Building model and  Architecture 
Lighting in large environments is designed to illuminate 
the entire space in a uniform way. The proposed scenario is 
a multi-level building. Ceiling plans for the LED array 
layout, in floor level is shown in Figure 3. A square lattice 
topology was considered for each level.

In fog /edge computing, computing, storage, networking, 
and data management services are provided on nodes within 
close proximity to IoT devices, bridging the gap between 
the cloud and end devices. In Figure 4, the proposed 
architecture is illustrated. Under this architecture, the short-
range mesh network purpose is twofold: enable edge 
computing and device-to-cloud communication, by ensuring 
a secure communication from a luminaire controller to the 
edge computer or datacenter (I2CM), through a neighbor 
luminaire/signboard controller with an active cellular 
connection; and enable peer-to-peer communication (I2I), to 
exchange information.

(guidance services). The requested information (I2D) is sent 
by the emitters at the ceiling to its receiver. 
In this architecture, the polychromatic WLEDs are 
placed on the ceiling in a square lattice topology (see Figure 
3), but only one, chip is modulated (R, G, B, V). The 
principle is that each WLED transmits a VLC signal with a 
unique identifier. The optical receiver uses this information 
and a position algorithm, based on the received joint 
transmission, calculates the track of the user.  
To 
receive 
the 
I2D 
information 
from 
several 
transmitters, the receiver must be located at the overlap of 
the circles that set the transmission range (radial) of each 
transmitter.

Figure 5. Illustration of the coverage map in the unit cell: footprint 
regions (#1-#9) and steering angle codes (2-9). 
Taking into account (1)-(5), the coverage map for a 
square unit cell is displayed in Figure 5. All the values were 
converted to decibel (dB).The nine possible overlaps (#1-
#9), defined as fingerprint regions, as well as receiver 
orientations (2-9 steering angles; ) are also pointed out for 
the unit square cell, in Figure 5. The input of the aided 
navigation system is the coded signal sent by the 
transmitters to an identify user (I2D), and includes its 
position in the network P(x, y, z), inside the unit cell and the 
steering angle, , that guides the user across his path at a 
given time, t. The device receives multiple signals, finds the 
centroid of the received coordinates, and stores it as the 
reference point position. Nine reference points, for each unit 
cell, are identified giving a fine-grained resolution in the 
localization of the mobile device across each cell. 
The indoor route throughout the building (track; q(x, y, z, 
, t)) is presented to the user by a responding message (I2D) 
transmitted by the ceiling luminaires that work also either as 
router or mesh/cellular nodes.  
Two-way communication (D2I-I2D) between users and 
the infrastructure is carried out through a neighbor 
luminaire/signboard controller with an active cellular 
connection (I2CM). With this request/response concept, the 
generated landmark-based instructions help the user to 
unambiguously identify the correct decision point where a 
change of direction (pose) is needed, as well as offer 
information for the user to confirm that he/she is on the right 
way. 
C. Communication protocol, coding/decoding techniques 
and error control 
To code the information, an On-Off Keying (OOK) 
modulation scheme was used and it was considered a 
synchronous transmission based on a 64- bits data frame. 
The coded transmitted signals are shown in Figure 6 along 
with their respective MUX signals.

All messages, in a frame, start with the header labelled 
as Sync, a block of 5 bits. The same synchronization header 
[10101], in an ON-OFF pattern, is imposed simultaneously 
to all emitters. The next block (ID) gives the geolocation (x, 
y, z coordinates) of the emitters inside the array (Xi,j,k). 
Cell’s IDs are encoded using a 4 bits binary representation 
for the decimal number. So, the next 12 (4+4+4) bits in are 
assigned, respectively, to the x, y and z coordinates (i, j, k) 
of the emitter in the array. If the message is diffused by the 
CM transmitter, a pattern [0000] precedes this identification. 
When bidirectional communication is required, the user has 
to register by choosing a user name (pin1) with 4 decimal 
numbers, each one associated to a color channel. So, to 
compose the decimal code each digit (0-9) has its own color, 
codified in a 4-binary bit code. Whenever buddy friend

services are required, the 4-binary code of the meeting 
(pin2) must be entered. In a frame time, The  block 
(steering angle ()) completes the pose, q(x, y, , t). Eight 
steering angles along the cardinal points and coded with the 
same number of the footprints in the unit cell (Figure 5) are 
possible from a start point to the next goal. The codes 
assigned to the pin2 and to  are the same in all the channels. 
In the absence of wayfinding services these last three blocks 
are set to zero and the user receives only its own location. 
The last block is used to transmit the wayfinding message. 
A stop bit is used at the end of each frame.  
Using the photocurrent signal measured by the 
photodetector, it is necessary to decode the received 
information. A calibration curve is previously defined to 
establish this assignment [14]. As displayed in Figure 6b, 
calibration curves make use of 16 distinct photocurrent 
thresholds which correspond to a bit sequence that allows all 
the sixteen combinations of the four RGBV input channels 
(24). If the calibrated levels (d0-d15) are compared to the 
different four-digit binary codes assigned to each level, then 
the decoding is obvious, and the message may be read [14]. 
Due to the proximity of successive levels (see Figure 6a) 
occasional errors occur in the decoded information. A parity 
check is performed after the word has been read [15]. The 
parity bits are the SUM bits of the three-bit additions of 
violet pulsed signal with two additional RGB bits and 
defined as: 
 
PR= V  R  B; PG= V  R  G;  PB= V  G  B  (6) 
 
In Figure 6b, the MUX signal that arises from the 
transmission of the four calibrated RGBV wavelength 
channels and the MUX signal that results from the 
generation of the synchronized parity MUX are displayed. 
On the top the seven bit word [R,G,B,V, PR, PG, PB] of the 
transmitted inputs guides the eyes. The colours red, green, 
blue and violet were assigned respectively to PR, PG , PB and 
PV. For simplicity the received data (d0-15 levels) is marked 
in the correspondent MUX slots as well as the parity levels 
marked as horizontal lines. On the top the decoded 7-bit 
coded word is exhibited. In the right side 4-bit binary codes 
assigned to the eight parity sublevels are inserted.  
In Figure 6a we illustrate how error control is achieved 
using check parity bits. A request from user "7261" is 
shown at C4,3,1; #1 N, along with the matching parity signal. 
Results show that without check parity bits, decoding was 
difficult primarily when levels were close together (dotted 
arrow). Based on the results for the analysed cases, the BER 
is high (4.6% without error correction) whereas it is 
negligible with error correction. 
III. 
MULTI-PERSON COOPERATIVE LOCALIZATION AND 
GUIDANCE SERVICES 
 Via the control manager, a handheld device with VLC 
connectivity communicates bidirectionally with a signboard 
receiver in each unit cell (#1). Each user (D2I) uplinks to 
the local controller a “request” message with the pose, qi (t), 
(x, y, z, ), user code (pin1) and also adds its needs (code 
meeting and wayfinding data). For route coordination the 
CM, using the information of the network’s VLC location 
capability, downlinks a personalized “response” message to 
each client at the requested pose with his wayfinding needs 
(I2D).

Figure 7. MUX/DEMUX signals assigned requests from two users 
(“3009” and “7261”) at different poses (C4,4,,1; #1W and C2,3,-1; #6 W ) and 
in successive instants (t1 and t3). 
In Figure 7, the MUX synchronized signals received by 
two users that have requested guidance services, at different 
times, are displayed. We have assumed that a user located at 
C2,3,-1,  arrived first (t1), auto-identified as ("7261") and 
informed the controller of his intention to find a friend for a 
previously scheduled meeting (code 3). A buddy list is then 
generated and will include all the users who have the same 
meeting code. User “3009” arrives later (t3), sends the alert 
notification (C4,4,1; t3) to be triggered when his friend is in 
his floor vicinity, level 1, identifies himself (“3009”) and 
uses the same code (code 3), to track the best way to his 
meeting.  
Upon receiving this request (t3), the buddy finder service 
uses the location information from both devices to 
determine the proximity of their owners (qij (t)) and provides 
the best route to the meeting, avoiding crowded areas. 
The pedestrian movement along the path can be thought 
as a queue, where the pedestrians arrive at a path, wait if the 
path is congested and then move once the congestion 
reduces. In Figure 7, a graphical representation of the 
simultaneous localization and mapping problem using 
connectivity as a function of node density, mobility and 
transmission range is illustrated.  
The following parameters are therefore needed to model 
the queuing system: The initial arrival time (t0) and the path, 
defined as the time when the pedestrian leaves the previous 
path and the actual movement along the path, qi (t, t’). Here, 
the service time is calculated using walking speed and

distance of the path. The number of service units or 
resources is determined by the capacity of the pathway, n(qi 
(x,y,z, , t))  and walking speed which depends on the 
number of request services, and on the direction of 
movement along the pathway qi (x,y,z, , t). The pedestrians 
are served as soon as the request message is appended by 
the CM (response message) as displayed in Figure 8.

Graphical representation of the simultaneous localization and 
mapping problem using connectivity as a function of node density, mobility 
and transmission range. 
If the number of pedestrians exceeds the path capacity, a 
backlog is automatically formed until the starting node. The 
hybrid controller integrates the number of requests and 
individual positions received during the same time interval. 
Once the individual positions are known, qi (t), the relative 
positions are calculated, qij (t). If the relative position is less 
than a threshold distance, a crowded region locally exists, 
and an alert message is sent for the users. This alert allows 
the CM to recalculate, in real time, the best route for the 
users, qi (t,t´), that request wayfinding services avoiding 
crowded regions. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A VLC based guidance system to be used by mobile 
users inside large buildings was proposed and characterized. 
According to global results, the location of a mobile 
receiver is found in conjunction with data transmission. 
VLC's dynamic LED-aided guidance system is designed to 
give users accurate route guidance and enable navigation 
and geotracking. The multi-person cooperative localization 
system detects crowded regions and alerts the user to 
reschedule meetups, as well as provides guidance 
information. With those alerts, the CM can recalculate, in 
real time, the best route for users requesting wayfinding 
services, avoiding crowded areas.
