Abstract—This paper considers fair radio resource assignment
for secondary users operating in TV white space by means
of frequency hopping. The achieved throughput for different
secondary users is used to measure the degree of fairness. The
permissible transmission power for secondary users is set to
protect the TV transmission from excessive interference. Hence,
there are different limits on the secondary transmission power
when operating in different idle TV channels because different
adjacent channels generates different amounts of interference
based on the TV receiver transfer function in the frequency
domain. Moreover, different free TV channels experience dif-
ferent amounts of interference due to the non-linearities in the
TV transmission. A model for power assignment in each of
the free TV channels is developed based on the received TV
signal, TV receiver characteristics and secondary user location.
For the sake of fair resource allocation, frequency hopping
is proposed herein, and its performance is evaluated. In this
study, three different TV transmitters located in three different
cities in Sweden, namely, G¨avle, Stockholm and Link¨oping, are
exploited where the interference from the TV transmission into
the free channels is measured. For the secondary system, the
deployment of indoor WiFi access points in an ofﬁce environment
is considered and simulated. The main ﬁnding is that frequency
hopping can provide fair radio resource distribution in terms of
the obtainable throughput. Moreover, it is shown that the denser
the area is, the higher the achievable secondary throughput due
to the higher attenuation of the interfering signals.

INTRODUCTION
This paper is an extended version of [1] and it reports more
measurements analyses.
At the beginning of its appearance, designers of wire-
less communication systems designers were concerned about
coverage to provide as wide as possible wireless access.
Thereafter, capacity concern began to emerge where not only
coverage is considered but also data rates as high as needed
are pursued [2]. Previous studies realized that the capacity of
wireless networks had doubled every two and a half years over
a span of 104 years [2]. However, later studies have shown that
this rate is currently higher, but for the sake of illustration,
we can assume that this rate of wireless throughput increase
currently holds, then, we have a one million-fold increase since
1965. This explosive growth is attributed to the reduced cell
size and the availability of the spectrum with wider bandwidths
[3]. In fact, both factors have their roots in spectrum-related
aspects, as the former is feasible with the aid of spectrum reuse.
Consequently, a fundamental question that arises is do we have
sufﬁcient and wide spectrum to go further with smaller cell
sizes and provide higher data rates for the foreseeable future
wireless access trafﬁc demands? The answer to this question
might be yes up to now but it will change to no at some
point because we can not support inﬁnite increase of this data
trafﬁc due to the existence of ﬁnite resources. Here, resources
preliminary refer to the ﬁnancial resources, infrastructure and
electromagnetic radio spectrum. The concerns regarding the
radio spectrum availability to adopt the growth in mobile data
trafﬁc has translated into a phenomenon known as spectrum
scarcity [4].
Simultaneously with the emerging spectrum scarcity phe-
nomenon, many experimental investigations have determined
that the radio spectrum below 6 GHz is inefﬁciently utilized,
where the duty cycles of some wireless systems reaches
1% or less [5]–[7]. Considering both facts of the need for
more spectral resources and being inefﬁcient in utilizing the
current available spectrum forms a paradox. A framework
that makes use of this paradox by accessing the spectrum
opportunistically called cognitive radio (CR) was ﬁrst proposed
at [8]. CR enables ﬂexible access to the radio spectrum, which
can signiﬁcantly enhance spectrum utilization efﬁciency [9]–
[11]. Therefore, the ultimate objective of CR is to mitigate
the spectrum scarcity by enabling dynamic spectrum access
(DSA), which allows unlicensed users, so-called secondary
users (SUs), to identify unutilized channels in the licensed
spectrum and utilize them dynamically as long as they do not
cause unacceptable interference to the communication by the
legacy spectrum licensees known as primary users (PUs) in
CR and DSA terminologies [12], [13]. The temporarily unused
portions of the spectrum are called spectrum white spaces
(WS), spectrum holes or spectrum opportunities. Throughout
this paper,the term WS will be used, which may exist in time,
frequency, and space domains. To ﬁnd a WS, one of three
approaches can be used, namely, spectrum sensing, beacon
signal and geo-location database [14]. Both spectrum sensing
and beacon signals are beyond the scope of this paper.
Using a geo-location database for accessing spectrum holes
was proposed in [15] and has subsequently been extensively
used in literature. With a geo-location database approach,
the SU needs to reports its location into a database, which
then informs the SU about the available spectrum to use
with the associated constrains. A geo-location database is
potentially beneﬁcial when the activity pattern of the PU is
highly predictable or slowly varying (quasi-static) over time.
Such systems include the terrestrial TV transmission and the
radar systems [16]. With a TV transmitter as a PU, the free of
use channels are called TV white space (TVWS).
In the case of terrestrial TV broadcasting, to avoid exces-

sive interference into the TV transmission, SUs cannot use the
same channel. However, interference caused by SUs is not only
limited to co-channel interference. In particular, in short-range
scenarios, adjacent channel interference is an equally severe
problem. In [17], indoor home scenarios with cable, rooftop
antenna and set-top antenna reception of TV signals were
analyzed. The spectrum reuse opportunities for SUs have been
determined using the number of channels where it is possible to
transmit without causing harmful interference to TV receivers
as a performance measure. Consequently, the transmission
capacity depends on which of the free channels are assigned for
a speciﬁc SU. Free channels that are exposed to interference
from either local or neighboring TV masts will have lower
throughput. One approach to allocate the available channels
in a fair way among the users is to switch channels using a
pseudo-random sequence, i.e., using frequency hopping.
In the literature, the most related work is reported in [18]
and [19]. In [18], the potentials and performance of WiFi-
like network deployments in TVWS are studied. In [19], the
attainable throughput of WiFi systems deployed in TVWS is
studied in comparison to the current deployment approach in
the ISM band.
In contrast to the related work in the literature, the distinct
contributions of this paper are as follows:
•
TV reception protection, TV transmission interference
into free channels and the secondary to secondary
interference are all considered to provide a full picture
for a secondary access scenario.
•
A combination of measured data together with sim-
ulations are used to obtain a realistic representative
environment.
•
Frequency hopping is adopted as a technique to fairly
distribute the available free channels among the sec-
ondary users.
•
The interference from the TV transmission into the
free channels is empirically evaluated. This inter-
ference is because of the non-linearities in the TV
transmitter chain in forms of spectrum leakage and
intermodulation products.
•
The performance of secondary operation in TVWS is
evaluated in three different representative locations in
Sweden.
The reminder of this paper is structured as follows. Section
II introduces the system model, including the TV broadcasting
transmission, the sharing model, SU power assignment and
the propagation model. In Section III, the motivation for
the frequency hopping framework is presented and discussed.
The methodology for obtaining the parameters and for the
performance evaluation is presented in Section IV. Section
V shows the numerical results and interpretations. Finally,
Section VI concludes the paper.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL
This section addresses aspects related to the system model
and is further divided into three subsections. The ﬁrst sub-
section overviews the concept of WiFi-like secondary opera-
tions in TVWS. The proceeding subsection explains how the
maximum allowed transmission power of the APs is executed.
Finally, the last subsection shows the model used to determine
the received downlink power at the SUs terminals.
A. WiFi Secondary Access to the Terrestrial TV Band
The UHF terrestrial TV broadcasting band lies between
470−862 MHz and is divided into 49 of channels 8 MHz each.
7.6 MHz is used for TV signals within each channel, while 0.4
MHz is deducted and evenly distributed as two guard bands
at each side of the channel. The 49 channels are indexed as j,
where
21 ≤ j ≤ 49.
(1)
Each channel j location in the frequency domain is deter-
mined as
j : 470 + 8 × (j − 1) ≤ 470 + 8 × j.
(2)
A single TV transmitter serves a coverage area with a
radius of 30 − 50 km using a transmission power of 40 − 50
dBW. Due to the high power of the TV transmitter and high TV
masts, neighboring TV transmitters use different broadcasting
channels (typically less than 10 channels). Consequently, in
each geo-location, a number of TV channels (generally more
than 40 channels) exist that are unoccupied and potentially
usable for low-power short-range secondary operation. These
unoccupied TV channels are called TVWS. Figure 1 presents
a conceptual demonstration of TVWS.
According to [20], WiFi-like short-range indoor wireless
systems are the ’sweet point’ for secondary operations in
TVWS for techno-economical considerations. Therefore, the
deployment of WiFi access points (APs) is considered in
the studies conducted in this paper. It is assumed here that
among the unoccupied TV channels, a speciﬁc number of
channels M is available for the deployed APs. With secondary
indoor operation in TVWS, both secondary and TV reception
experience interference from TV and secondary transmissions
respectively. Figure 2 illustrates the entire system model in-
cluding mutually interfering signals and geo-location database
accessibility. Hereafter, WiFi APs are deployed following the
layout shown in Figure 3, where all APs are attached to the

spectrum opportunities model. The geo-location database is populated by the

device or network. SUs access the database to inspect the available radio
channels and their associated parameters. SUs also have to report their
existence to the database to update different transmission parameters.
building’s ceiling and equally spaced. Each SU terminal is
linked to the closest AP. Users are uniformally distributed
throughout the entire building and within each ﬂoor.
B. Permissible Transmission Power of APs
The permissible transmission power model is based on the
interference tolerance of adjacent channels of the TV receiver,
which guarantees a certain minimum level of TV reception
quality. In [21], interference of adjacent channels was exper-
imentally evaluated. The aggregate interference coming from
multiple SUs into channel L at speciﬁc location coordinates
(x, y) is denoted as Itot(x, y), which is calculated as
Itot(x, y) =
X
k
k̸=0
N
X
j=1
Ij,k+L(x, y),
(3)
where (x, y) are evaluated with a reference (0, 0) denoting the
TV transmitter mast location, N is the total number of SUs,
and Ij,k+L(x, y) is the interference injected by the jth SU
occupying channel k + L into a TV receiver located at (x, y).
If the TV received power on channel L at location (x, y)
is SL(x, y) and the minimum acceptable signal-to-interference
ratio (SIR) is γ, then to meet the TV reception requirements,
we should satisfy
SL(x, y) ≥ γ + Itot(x, y).
(4)
where all quantities in (4) are on the logarithmic scale, i.e.,
dB.
To determine the maximum permissible transmission power
on channel k + L, one needs to account for the aggregate
interference from multiple SUs. Hence, a margin of δ dB
can be used to compensate for this adjacent interference.
Accordingly, the maximum permissible transmission power for
a SU in channel k + L at location (x, y), say P t
k+L(x, y), is
found as
P t
k+L(x, y) = SL(x, y) − γ − ζ(k) − δ
(5)
where ζ(k) is the kth adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR),
which represents the difference between the power received

transfer function in the frequency domain. Both integration
terms of 6 are on their logarithmic scale.
C. Received Power at SU Terminals
To obtain the received power at each SU terminal, a
propagation model is required. In [22], a propagation model
based on combining the COST 231 [23] model and ITU-R
P.1238 [24] is developed. The model calculates the path loss
between the SU transmitter and receiver as
PL(d, f) = PLF S + αd + nwLw + nfLf + A,
(7)
where PL(d, f) is the path loss when the transmitter operates
at a frequency of f MHz and located at a distance of d
meters from the receiver. nw, nf, Lw and Lf are the number
of penetrated walls, number of penetrated ﬂoors, loss per
wall and loss per ﬂoor, respectively, α and A are constants.
Table I shows the model parameters for the case of an ofﬁce
environment.
To account for the shadow fading, the received power at
channel k + L in location (x, y) is denoted as P r
k+L(x, y) and
modeled as a log-normally distributed random variable with a
mean (P t
k+L(x, y) − PL(d, f)) and standard deviation σ.

FAIR RADIO RESOURCES DISTRIBUTION
In this section, the motivation for having a fair radio
resource allocation mechanism in TVWS is shown, which
is essentially the heterogeneity of the free TV channels.
Moreover, frequency hopping as an enabler for such fairness
is explained.
A. Heterogeneous Free Channels
Applying (5) to determine the maximum permissible AP
transmission power at a speciﬁc location provides different
values for different channels due to the following reasons.
First - and most importantly - there are different adjacent
channels indices; therefore, ζ(k) takes different values for
different channels depending on which channels are used by
the TV transmitter. Second, different used TV channels use
different transmission powers, which provides different values
of SL(x, y).
Not only is the AP transmission power different for dif-
ferent channels, but the TV transmission interference into
different unoccupied channels also considerably varies. Mea-
suring this interference in a speciﬁc area is a stand-alone
contribution of this paper as explained in Section V. This
PU interference originates from TV transmitter non-linearities
in the form of spectral leakage and intermodulation products.
Spectral leakage essentially affects the ﬁrst adjacent channels
while intermodulation products are found in different channels.
Moreover, channels used by neighboring TV transmitters can
also generates interference. Although TV transmission interfer-
ence is more severe in outdoor operations, our measurements
results presented in Section V show that the PU indoor interfer-
ence into free TV channels is not negligible and considerably
affects the performance of the SUs.
Having different permissible AP transmission power with
different primary TV transmission interferences at different
channels would result in having a wide range of throughput
achieved when using different channels. The following sub-
section proposes frequency hopping as a solution to provide a
fair distribution of the available channels among the APs.
B. Frequency Hopping
Frequency hopping is proposed in this paper to distribute
the available heterogeneous free TV channels in a fair manner
among the APs. By frequency hopping, it is meant that the APs

hop between the available channels in a random uncentralized
manner. Through the use of frequency hopping, it is ensured
that no APs will be holding all the time on the channels with a
high SINR and none will be forced to use the low SINR chan-
nels during the entire time of operation. Therefore, by means
of frequency hopping, all APs will eventually achieve similar
long-term throughput. The achievable downlink throughput
when transmitting on channel k + L with the maximum
permissible power is denoted as Ck+L and calculated as

Note that the throughput obtained using (8) and throughout
the reminder of this paper is per Hertz capacity and given
in [bits/sec/Hz]. For simplicity, the M available TV channels
are locally re-indexed by the indices 1 ≤ m ≤ M. Suppose
that the SU terminal is served by its nearest AP that has an
index i and hops among the M available channels with equal
probabilities. Denote the channel used by the serving AP as

A. Obtaining TV Received Signal Power
SPLAT (RF signal propagation, loss, and terrain analysis
tool) [27] is a simulation tool that is used to obtain the received
signal power at each point inside the area under investigation.
The input data to SPLAT are the transmitter properties (e.g.,
transmission power, mast height, and so forth) which were
obtained from the Post and Transport Agency (PTS), the
Swedish communication regulator. SPLAT uses the Longley-
Rrice propagation model [27] and terrain data that are available
online at [27]. The simulation results for channel 24 in the
surroundings of the G¨avle area are shown as an example in
Figure 11.
B. Measurements for Obtaining TV Interference into Free
Channels
The TV transmission interference into free channels is
not covered by the simulation model; rather, an empirical
model for this interference is developed. Measurements are
performed in three areas served by three different TV trans-
mitters in Sweden, namely in the cities of G¨avle, Stockholm
and Link¨oping. In G¨avle, the measurements were extensive

and performed in 6 different locations, marked as L1-L6. The
measurements in Stockholm and Link¨oping are complementary
and performed for comparisons and to consider areas with
different characteristics. Table III shows the GPS coordinates
and descriptions of the measurements locations. Google Maps
images for the measurements locations are also presented in
Figures 4, 5, and 7.
The measurements are performed using a set up that
consists of an antenna, a spectrum analyzer and a PC. The
antenna and the spectrum analyzer are used to capture the
signal in the entire TV band, which is then recorded using
the PC for further analysis. The PC also controls the spectrum
analyzer. Figure 8 presents a ﬁeld photo of the measurements
setup. Moreover, the equipments and other parameters are
provided in Table I.

achieved throughput.
A. Interference from TV Transmission into Free Channels
The interference from the TV transmission is caused by
the non-linearities introduced by the TV transmitter power
ampliﬁer. These non-linearities are divided into spectrum leak-
age and intermodulation products. Figure 9 is a qualitative
illustration of the measured leaked power at location L2
in G¨avle as an example. In Figure 10, the intermodulation
products are shown. For later analysis the quantitative ﬁndings
of both the spectrum leakage and the intermodulation products
are used.
To reﬂect the extent of the variety of the free TV channels,
let us deﬁne γ0(k+L) as the ratio between the permissible SU
transmission in channel k+L and the TV interference into the
same channel. In many channels, the value of γ0 approaches ∞
as the best case, while as the worst case in the measurements
locations, the value of γ(47) is equivalent to 26 dB in location
L5.
B. Obtaining Model Parameters
As described in Subsection IV, the received TV signal
power and the TV interference into free channels are needed.
The received TV signal power is obtained by SPLAT, as shown
in Figure 11 as an example of one channel.
Using the received TV signal power at all points in the
study area, the maximum permissible transmission power is

calculated using (5). Figure 6 shows this permissible transmis-
sion power density for channels 25, 48, and 35 in the G¨avle
area. These three channels have been chosen as representatives
for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd adjacent channels, respectively. The
ﬁgure shows how the permissible transmission power for SU
differs in different channels and different locations. For exam-
ple, SUs can transmitting in channel 35 with an approximately
20 dBm/Hz higher power density compared to transmit in

channel 25.
C. APs Throughput
At ﬁrst, to show the creditability of using the frequency
hopping scheme, the achieved throughput without and with
hopping is studied. Assume an AP serving area of 100 m2 and
three APs using three different TVWS channels without hop-
ping. AP1 uses channel 47, AP2 transmits on channel 34, and
AP3 operates on channel 36. These three channels are selected
to have three different classes of the provided throughput.
Figure 12 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
of the throughput on each channel when each AP holds on
its channel. As shown in this ﬁgure, user 1 served by AP1
obtains the lowest throughput all the time with an average
of 2.6 bits/sec/Hz, while user 3 served by AP3 achieves
the highest throughput with an average of 6.4 bits/sec/Hz.
Applying frequency hopping among the three channels for
all APs would then make the three users achieve the same
throughput with an average of 5.8 bits/sec/Hz. Therefore, the
three available channels are shared among the three APs in a
fair manner.
As another case, Figure 16 shows the achievable throughput
per square meter in Stockholm when using different numbers
of APs for different ﬂoor areas. All the ﬁndings shown in
Figure 16 consider a hopping set of 3 channels, which are
channels 24, 36, and 48 chosen randomly.
Now, suppose that frequency hopping is applied among
a certain set of channels, called a hopping set; then the
achieved throughput depends on the permissible transmission
power and the TV interference on this hopping set. As an
example, consider the following three cases. In Case 1, the
hopping set is three interfered channels with low permissible
transmission power; for this case, use channels 44, 45, and 47.
Case 2 uses better channels than Case 1, namely channels
25, 34 and 35. the case 3 hopping set is the best, where chan-

nels 35, 36, and 51 are used. As Figure 13 depicts, hopping
among the case 1 set provides the lowest throughput, while
using the channels in case 3 as a hopping set provides the
highest throughput. the throughput in case 2 is in between
that of cases 1 and 3. Quantitatively, the case 1 set provides
approximately 50% of the throughput that the case 3 set
achieves.
An important factor for the achieved throughput is the size
of the hopping set (i.e., the number of channels). In this regard,
a simulation is conducted in which the set size is changed. The
hopping set is chosen such that the average channel quality
is preserved when comparing different set sizes. Figure 14
shows that the achieved throughput changes almost linearly
when increasing the hopping set from 1 to 4 channels in
all regions of the CDF curve. However, for the mean and
above the 50 percentile, when increasing the hopping size
beyond 4 channels, the linear increase stops and the gain in
the throughput tends to saturate. This result is due to the fact
that APs using the same channel are more likely to be further

separated when higher hopping sets are used.
Together with the hopping set, the AP serving area, which
determines the number of APs in the building, determines the
achieved throughput in the entire building. Figure 15 shows
how the total throughput provided by the WiFi-like system is
affected by changes in the AP serving area and the hopping set.
Figure 15 shows that increasing the AP serving area decreases
the provided throughput for the entire building because there
are less resources to handle the trafﬁc. However, increasing the
AP serving area increases the distances between the APs using
the same channel while hopping, which in turn decreases the
interference among the APs. Therefore, the decrease in the
throughput does not occur linearly with the increase in the
AP serving area. It is important to study the throughput map
in the building. Figure 17 presents a color-coded map of the
throughput in one of the building ﬂoors with the APs locations.
The ﬁgure is generated considering a deployment of 25 APs.
In general, it is observed from the ﬁgure that the closer to the

AP that the user is, the higher the throughput that they receive.
This result is not only because of the higher received power
from the AP but also because of being further from the other
APs that use the same channel and hence, less interference is
experienced. Moreover, the APs located closer to the edges of
the building supply higher throughput because other interfering
APs are located at one side and therefore have longer distances
to APs located at the edges. On the other hand, the APs in
the middle receive interference from all directions with lower
distances from the interferes, which decreases their provided
throughput.
For comparison, Figure 18 shows the upper and lower
bounds for the entire building throughput for the simulated
ofﬁce building located in G¨avle, Stockholm and Link¨oing.
The bounds are considered when the hopping set is composed
of 3 channels. For the upper bounds, the best 3 channels
in each location are used for the hopping set, while the
worst 3 channels are used to reach the lower throughputs’

bounds. As shown in the ﬁgure, in the Stockholm area, higher
throughputs are attainable in both sides due to the existence of
higher buildings and more objects that attenuate more of the
interfering signals. An important observation here is that the
TV signal in Stockholm is still high compared to that in G¨avle
and Link¨oing, which enables high secondary transmission
power. This high received TV signal is observed despite the
high building and existence of attenuating objects, which is
due to some consideration in the system design of the TV
mast height and the transmission power. Comparing G¨avle and
Link¨oing, it is observed that the performance is nearly identical
with slightly higher performance in Link¨oing. Note that these
results are for the measurements locations which are speciﬁc
cases. However, the general tendency can be extrapolated.

CONCLUSION
Throughout this paper, the performance of a WiFi-like
secondary network deployed in an ofﬁce environment has
been studied. Three different locations in three different cities,
namely G¨avle, Stockholm and Link¨oing, all located in Sweden,
are considered for the studies within this paper. The secondary
WiFi-like network operates in a TVWS using the geo-location
database spectrum opportunities framework. The main metric
used in the performance evaluation is the achievable downlink
throughput for the access points. This achievable throughput
is determined using the permissible transmission power, which
protects the TV reception, the interference among the access
points and the TV transmission interference. All these pa-
rameters have been obtained using either measurements or
simulations for a realistic scenario. The results have shown
that different TV channels experience a large variety in their
provided throughput. Therefore, frequency hopping is applied
for fair resource distribution among the access points. More-
over, an investigation on the impacts of the size of the hopping
set and the number of deployed APs has also been conducted.
