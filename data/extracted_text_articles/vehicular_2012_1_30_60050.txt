Abstract—Future vehicle active safety applications will rely
on one-hop Periodic Broadcast Communication (oPBC) based
on a new standard IEEE 802.11p. In this work, we ﬁrst aim
at understanding the behavior of such oPBC under varying
load conditions by considering three important quality aspects
of vehicle safety applications: reliability, fairness, and delay.
Second, we investigate possible improvements of these quality
aspects. Our evaluation reveals that the Hidden Node (HN)
problem is the main cause of various quality degradations
especially when the network is unsaturated. We propose three
simple but effective broadcasting schemes to alleviate the
impact of the HNs.

I. INTRODUCTION
Vehicle safety applications will use two basic communi-
cations: event-driven and time-driven. In the former case, a
vehicle starts broadcasting a message for a certain duration
periodically when a hazardous situation is detected and,
hence, the messages are not sent in normal situation. In
the latter case, each vehicle continuously performs oPBC
to pro-actively deliver a beacon message to the neighboring
vehicles to make each vehicle aware of its vicinity such that
safety applications will leverage this to detect any hazardous
situation in a timely manner. A lane change advisor and
collision warning applications [1] are two typical examples
which require a frequency of 10 messages per second
with a maximum no message interval of [0.3sec,1.0sec]
[1], [2], [3]. In addition, the applications pose a strict
fairness requirement [4], [5], where each vehicle should
have equal opportunity. In this type of system, message loss
is unavoidable (we explain the causes below); however, it
must not be the case that one or a few vehicles take all the
loss, because this would result in these vehicles becoming
invisible to their surrounding vehicles.
When stations broadcast rather than making peer-to-peer
communication the 802.11p’s DCF does not use its full
functions [6]. As a result, when all stations use broadcast-
based communication, the collision problems, i.e., the con-
tention and the HN problems increase. The purpose of our
research is to understand the behavior of this oPBC based
under varying load conditions by considering three quality
aspects which are important for vehicle safety applications:
reliability (i.e., successful message reception ratio), fairness
(i.e., distribution of successful message reception ratio over
vehicles) and delay (i.e., no message interval between two
vehicles that are in their CRs.). In addition, we want to
investigate possible improvements. The remainder of the
paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the
mathematical model. Section III presents our evaluations.
Section IV presents our improvements and Section V gives
a conclusion.
II. MODEL OF OPBC
Here, we encounter two aspects: a simulation of the
movement of the vehicles and a simulation of the behavior
of the wireless communication as a function of the position
of the vehicles. Thus we have the trafﬁc model which
yields the position of vehicles as a function of time and
the communication model that describes the communication
events between vehicles as a function of time and vehicle
location. Hence, the communication model uses the trafﬁc
model’s output as one of its input parameters. The interface
between the two models is formed by the location of
the vehicles. Together with the radio channel model this
yields the neighborhood structure viz., a set of vehicles
that each vehicle can transmit to or receive from at any
point in time. The trafﬁc model can be very advanced,
even to the extent that life traces are simulated [7]. In
this work we are not concerned, however, with the trafﬁc
model and we stick to a simple highway model, represented
as a stretch of several kilometers with three lanes per
direction and periodic boundary conditions (which makes
it, in fact, a loop). Speeds per lane are assumed to be ﬁxed.
In simulations the main concern of the trafﬁc model is to
simulate with a small enough time step to have a realistic
and sufﬁciently accurate description for the communication
model. The motivation for this restriction is that we want
to study just the communication model under varying load
conditions. The communication model has two parts: First,
communication and radio channel model that generates the
events. Second, timing model of communicating vehicles to
deﬁne the concepts of interest.

1) The communication and the radio channel model:
We restrict ourself to describing the broadcast mode of the
802.11p DCF. Besides, we take a Signal to Interference
plus Noise Ratio (SINR) based signal reception model of
the updated NS-2 implementation of the 802.11p [8]. In
addition, we choose the Two-Ray Ground (TRG) signal
propagation model in order to study solely the effect of
message collisions.
2) The timing model: We assume a set V of N vehicles
v1, v2, ...vN periodically broadcasting messages. The behav-
ior of the system is described as a series of events happening
at certain times. As a convention we use a superscript to
denote a kth occurrence or instance. For example, e(k)
denotes the kth occurrence of an event e and m(k)
i
denotes
the kth message of vi. In addition, we often do not name
the event but only the time of occurrence using a similar
notation, as explained next. The activation time a(k)
i
is the
time at which vi becomes ready to broadcast m(k)
i
. The
start time s(k)
i
and ﬁnish time f (k)
i
are the times at which vi
actually starts and ﬁnishes the transmission of message m(k)
i
,
respectively. Note, from a receiver vehicle’s perspective, the
start time and the ﬁnish time at which the vehicle starts
and ﬁnishes receiving the message m(k)
i
are s(k)
i
+ δ and
f (k)
i
+ δ, respectively. δ is an air propagation delay that is
relatively small1, therefore we neglect this in our model. The
transmission interval tI(k)
i
of message m(k)
i
is deﬁned as
tI(k)
i
def
= [s(k)
i
, f (k)
i
) .
(1)
We require that
a(k)
i
< s(k)
i
≤ f (k)
i
≤ a(k+1)
i
(2)
holds. Message transmission is assumed to be periodic. If
a message is not sent at all or is delayed such that the
remaining part of the interval is not enough for successful
completion we say that the message is dropped. This may
mean a partial message transmission or, in the extreme case,
no transmission at all (s(k)
i
= f (k)
i
). In both cases, we deﬁne
f (k)
i
= a(k+1)
i
and we take that as the condition of message
dropping. Moreover, we deﬁne transmission power Pti(t) of
vehicle vi and its reception power at vehicle vj as Prij(t)
and cumulative reception power cPrj(t) of vehicle vj at
time t. Note, we always assume that i ̸= j holds whenever
we talk about two vehicles vi and vj. We require that
Pti(t) > 0 holds during tI(k)
i
and its value is determined
by the application. Prij(t) is determined by a given signal
propagation model, by Pti(t) and by the distance between
sender and receiver at time t. cPrj(t) is determined by all
receiving signal strengths at vj at time t plus a noise ﬂoor,
nF, as follows
cPrj(t) = nF +
X
vi
{Prij(t)|Prij(t) ≥ PsTh},
(3)
1δ ≪ 1µs [9], [10]
where PsTh is a Power Sense threshold of the receiver. Given
these notions, we deﬁne the neighborhood of a vehicle. At
any time t, each vehicle vi has a target neighbor set of other
vehicles, Nbi(t), where vj ∈ Nbi(t) means that vj is in the
CR of vi at time t. It is deﬁned as follows
vj ∈ Nbi(t)
def
= Prij(t)
nF
≥ SrTh,
(4)
where SrTh is a SINR threshold for receiving the message
successfully. Note, CR is the reception range, the places
where the message could be received disregarding interfer-
ence of other stations. A necessary condition for receiving a
message is that the receiving vehicle must be in the CR of the
sending vehicle for the duration of the message transmission.
A sufﬁcient condition for a message reception is that the
receiving signal power must be equal to or greater than SrTh
with respect to the cumulative power of all other signals
for the entire duration of the message transmission. This is
deﬁned as follows
∀t : t ∈ tI(k)
i
∧
Prij(t)
(cPrj(t) − Prij(t)) ≥ SrTh.
(5)
We extend the concept of a neighborhood to intervals by
↓Nbi(I) =
\
t∈I
Nbi(t) .
(6)
This interval represents all vehicles that have been in the
CR of vehicle vi during the entire interval I. Changes of
neighbor sets are represented by enter and leave events.
Entering time e(k)
ji
is the time at which vj enters the CR
of vi for the kth time while leaving time l(k)
ji
is the time
at which vj leaves the CR of vi for the kth time. The kth
encounter interval eI(k)
ij
of vj with vi is deﬁned as
eI(k)
ij
def
= [e(k)
ji , l(k)
ji ) .
(7)
During eI(k)
ij
we say that there is a link from i to j and we
call that the kth such link.
Message loss: The most important concern is whether
messages are actually received by vehicles that could receive
them. Considering message m(k)
i
there are three reasons why
another vehicle vj might not receive it.
(OOR) Out Of Range. In order for a vehicle vj to receive
m(k)
i
it must be in the neighborhood of vi for the duration
of the transmission. When vj ̸∈↓ Nbi(tI(k)
i
), vj does not
receive m(k)
i
.
(MD) Message Dropping. This happens, as described above,
if the back-off interval becomes so long that the message
transfer time does not ﬁt in the remaining part of the period.
In our model this is equivalent to
f (k)
i
= a(k+1)
i
.
(8)
No vehicle will receive message m(k)
i
.
(MC) Message Collision. The message is transmitted but

not received by vj since other vehicles may transmit at the
same time to vj and their interferences are strong enough
to corrupt the receiving message of vi. This is deﬁned as
follows
∃t : t ∈ tI(k)
i
∧
Prij(t)
(cPrj(t) − Prij(t)) < SrTh.
(9)
Given these reasons for loss we deﬁne the transmission
condition of message m(k)
i
and, accordingly, the reception
condition of m(k)
i
by a vehicle vj as follows
Tc(k)
i
=

if vj ∈↓Nbi(tI(k)

otherwise.
(11)
If Tc(k)
i
= XMT, message m(k)
i
is broadcast successfully. If
Rc(k)
ij = XMT, the message is received by vehicle vj at time
f (k)
i
successfully.
Metrics: We deﬁne the most appropriate metrics that
can judge the communication quality in the following three
aspects: reliability, fairness and delay. For the reliability as-
pect, we use the fraction of successfully delivered messages
(SMR, successful message ratio). This concept can be reﬁned
to links between vehicles and to individual messages. To
start we deﬁne the number of received messages from vi by
vj in a given interval, as well as the number of times that
such message could have been received.
Rsij(I) = |{k | tI(k)
i
⊆ I ∧ Rc(k)
ij = XMT}|
(12)
Nsij(I) = |{k | tI(k)
i
⊆ I ∧ Tc(k)
i
= XMT
∧vj ∈↓Nbi(tI(k)
i
)}|
(13)
The ratio is the successful message ratio in that interval.
SMRij(I)
=
( Rsij(I)
Nsij(I)
if Nsij(I) > 0
0
if Nsij(I) = 0
(14)
Generalizing this by summing over the receiving vehicles
gives the successful message ratio of vi in an interval.
SMRi(I) =



P
vj Rsij(I)
P
vj Nsij(I)
if P
vj Nsij(I) > 0
0
if P
vj Nsij(I) = 0
(15)
As a special case, SMRi(tI(k)
i
) is the SMR of m(k)
i
. Again,
generalizing by summing over the sending vehicles we
obtain the SMR of the entire network during that interval.
SMR(I) =



P
vi,vj Rsij(I)
P
vi,vj Nsij(I)
if P
vi,vj Nsij(I) > 0
0
if P
vi,vj Nsij(I) = 0
(16)
At the network level an interesting question is: how does
SMR([0, T)), where T represents a time of consideration,
behave as a function of vehicle density? From the fairness
perspective, the behavior of individual vehicles is more im-
portant than the average. This is why we also analyze SMRi
to see whether losses are distributed evenly (or fairly) over
the vehicles. The cumulative distribution function shows
this; a fair distribution would give a transition from 0 to
1 within a short interval.
cdfSMR(I, x) = |{vj | SMRj(I) ≤ x}|
N
, for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1
(17)
In addition, plotting SMRi as a function of time gives insight
in the visibility of vi for other vehicles. Finally, from the
delay perspective, an important further question is how
losses of a particular vehicle are distributed in time and
across vehicles: do losses happen in sequences and do they
affect the same links? To that end we deﬁne the concept of a
“No Message Interval” between two vehicles during a given
interval I which is the length of the longest subinterval of
I without a successful message transmission.
NoMij(I) = sup {|J| | J ⊆ I ∧ Rsij(J) = 0}
(18)
In addition, the “First Delay” is the length of the longest
initial subinterval and represents a delay in discovery in case
we apply it to an encounter interval.
FDij([a, b))
=
sup {x | [a, a + x) ⊆ [a, b)
∧ Rsij([a, a + x)) = 0}
(19)
In our analysis we look at genuine NoM and FD, viz., those
that correspond to encounter intervals. These are examined
as a function of their length and plotted as a density
(histogram) or as a cumulative distribution.
III. EVALUATION OF OPBC UNDER CSMA/CA
For the purpose of this evaluation, two different scenarios
are simulated. In the ﬁrst scenario (single domain (SD)),
vehicles are deployed at ﬁxed locations within a single
CR viz., all vehicles can receive each others messages.
This scenario allows us to study the collisions caused only
by the contention problem, i.e., NN collisions since there
are no HNs. In the second scenario (multi domain (MD)),
vehicles are deployed on a 3km long highway with three
lanes per direction. This scenario allows us to study both
HN and NN collisions. By having these two scenarios, we
can compare the impact of these two types of collisions.
The vehicles at the three lanes have ﬁxed velocities of 20,
30, and 40 m/s respectively. In both scenarios, different
inter-vehicle spacings are used in order to create different
Vehicle Densities (VD). We assume a single channel, a ﬁxed
broadcasting period and initially, a random phasing within
this period as
a(k)
i
def= φi + kTi.

Successful Message Ratio (SMR) of the entire network with
respect to the vehicle density (VD) shows the reliability. maxSMR, minSMR
are the max and min possible SMR, the former is calculated analytically and
the latter is obtained through simulations. SD (Single Domain) case shows
SMR degradation only due to the contention problem since all vehicles
are deployed at ﬁxed locations within a single CR (i.e., no HNs). MD
(Multi-Domain) shows SMR degradation due to both the contention and
HN problems (vehicles are deployed on a 3km long highway). CI = 99%.
Thus, each vi has a broadcasting period Ti ∈ R+ and an
initial broadcasting phase φi ∈ R+, where φi is uniformly
selected from an interval of [0, Ti). Moreover, we assume the
same signal strength (300m), the same broadcasting period
(0.1seconds), the same message size (555 bytes) ﬁxed over
time for all vehicles. The evaluation is based on 1 minute
of simulation.
Simulation results: First, we study the reliability by means
of the successful message reception ratio metric, i.e.,
SMR([0,60)). The SMR of the overall network with respect
to VD of the SD and MD cases are shown in Figure 1.
For each different VD case, we performed ten simulations
with a different random seed for selecting the initial phases.
Figure 1 presents the average values of these simulations
with a conﬁdence interval of 99%. In addition, the theoretical
maximum SMR (maxSMR) is plotted to show the upper
boundary. This maxSMR is given by
maxSMR(VD) =
 1
if VD ≤ SP
SP/VD
otherwise
,
(21)
where SP is the channel saturation point, i.e., the maximum
capacity of the channel in terms of the number of vehicles
that can ﬁt in one period duration without any overlap in
time for broadcasting. SP is given as
SP =
T
Ts + Td
,
(22)
where Ts is the inter-frame space, i.e., an AIFS duration, and
Td is the time to transmit a single message. When all vehicles
are optimally synchronized over the period for broadcasting,
the SMR should approach this maxSMR level. Besides, we
obtained the minimum possible SMR level (minSMR) by
means of simulations in which we deﬁned roughly the same
phases for all vehicles. From Figure 1, the HN problem
appears to be the main cause of SMR degradation when
the network is unsaturated. Once the network load exceeds
its maximum capacity, the NN collisions start occurring

in bursts thus yielding lower SMR. We now continue our
study at individual vehicle level to investigate the fairness.
Here, we select an unsaturated network condition where the
trafﬁc density is sparse, i.e., VD is about 50 vehicles (that
corresponds to about 85 vehicles per km over 6 lanes in our
settings). Figure 2 shows a relatively unfair distribution of
message receptions over vehicles where some vehicles have
a high SMR whereas others have a relatively low SMR. In
an ideal fair case, the dashed line is expected where the
distance between the best and worst cases should be close
to 0, however, the fact is 65%. Figures 3 and 4 show the
impact of the collision problems on the delay aspects at
the link level through a cumulative distribution of links by
their NoM and a histogram of links by their FD respectively.
During 60 seconds of simulation (VD=50), approximately
53000 links are established in total. Note, the link is an one-
way relationship. Some vehicles join the CR of a vehicle
whereas some may leave the CR due to the relative speed
between the vehicle and its neighbors. From Figure 3, we
can see that almost 30% of links experience more than one
second of NoM. This implies that a certain vehicle does
not receive a sequence of messages from another vehicle
although the vehicle could have received these messages in
the absence of interferences. From Figure 4, many vehicles,
i.e., about 350±50 are seen that did not even discover

some of their one-hop neighboring vehicles for their entire
encounter interval. Based on the above results, we conclude
that HN problem is the main cause of the SMR degradation
when the network is unsaturated. Once it is saturated, the
NN problem reduces the SMR dramatically. Therefore, the
latter one is more a network congestion problem. In fact,
this congestion problem is well-known and addressed in
many works, e.g., [3], [5], and [11]. The main approaches
are to reduce beacon generation rate, beacon size, or to
reduce the CR which are indeed all derived from (22). The
impact of the HN problem is clearly revealed by an unfair
SMR distribution and the delay characteristics such as NoM
and FD mainly due to synchronized HNs, because vehicles
traveling on a highway, particulary those traveling in the
same direction could have a rather static topology for a
relatively long period 2. In that topology, some vehicles
could be incidentally synchronized as HNs which leads to a
systematic message loss.
IV. SOLUTION FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF OPBC
We look at situations where the trafﬁc density is moderate
or sparse, i.e., unsaturated. We assume that in that situation
message loss is even more serious in terms of safety since
the vehicles have relatively higher speeds. Therefore, such
situations should have even stricter requirements on the
communication.
Elastic scheme (ES): In ES, the initial phase of broadcasting
is changed at a regular basis. The message activation time
is deﬁned as follows

where eri is the elastic rate that deﬁnes how often the phase
should be changed and r is a function that returns a random
value within the given interval. This value deﬁnes how much
the phase should be changed. φe is a phase for starting
elasticity and it is given as φe = ⌊r(eri)⌉. To keep the
expected number of generated messages the same as the
strict periodic scheme, 2Ti is selected as the interval. The
worst case delay between two messages is 2Ti. Figure 5, 6,
and 7 show the results of this scheme in which we use the
same er for all vehicles. From these graphs, we can make
several interesting observations. First, it is clearly seen that
the more often the phase is changed, the better the elastic
scheme improves the fairness and the delay characteristics.
Particularly, the fairness is improved drastically even at the
higher value of er which is in result of frequent change
of phasing in the elastic scheme that changes the channel
condition for the vehicle. Under changing channel condition,
the lifetime of a synchronized period of the vehicles (also
a period of favorable channel condition of the vehicle)
becomes shorter, i.e., highly likely to be at most the er
period. Figure 6 reﬂects the effect of the short living
synchronization when er is 6; we see somewhat discrete
and step-like effects. As a result, each vehicle experiences
more or less the same ﬂuctuating channel conditions in the
long run. Second, in Figure 5 we can see that the elastic
scheme does not affect SMR of the entire network. It only
affects SMRs of individual vehicles. For example, in the
case of pure CSMA/CA, roughly half of the vehicles shows
SMRs between 75-100%, while the other half shows SMRs
between 40-75%. But, in the case of elastic scheme, this is
completely changed and all vehicles show more or less the
same SMRs that is closer to SMR of the entire network.
Jitter Scheme (JS): In JS, the activation time is deﬁned as
a(k)
i
= φi + kTi + AJi − r(2AJi),
(24)
where AJi is an activation jitter that has a granularity of
one message transmission time (i.e., AJ = N ↔ AJ =
NTd). The worst delays between messages of this scheme,
therefore, is equal to Ti + 2AJi. Again for observations,
ﬁrst, similar as ES, JS improves the fairness and the delay

characteristics as shown in Figure 8, 9 and 10. We chose
the same AJ for all vehicles. The bigger AJ is chosen, the
better JS works. Note that a small jitter size does not show
much improvement. Compared to ES, JS needs a bigger
jitter size to improve the fairness though a small jitter size
already works pretty well on the delay characteristics. This
indeed makes sense, because, in JS, the channel condition of
a vehicle does not change completely compared to the ES.
Let’s say there are two vehicles synchronized with each other
causing message collisions on their receivers. For ES, we
showed that the lifetime of such synchronization becomes
relatively short. But, in JS, the two vehicles would remain
synchronized during their entire encounter interval. The jitter
only sometimes helps to prevent the message collisions
happening. In addition, we can say that JS works better than
ES on the delay characteristics. Particularly, from Figure 10
we learn that the number of links on a 0.2-1s interval is
much lower than that of ES.
Elastic + Jitter scheme (EJS): In addition to the previous
two schemes, we also look into a third approach which is
a combination of the elastic and the jitter schemes, namely
EJS deﬁned as

the links have less than 0.5s of NoM (i.e., better than ES). (VD = 50, CI

JS improves the FD signiﬁcantly. In case of AJ=2, the number
of cases for “5<” and “Never” are 31±6 and 29±9, respectively. In case
of AJ=20, these are both 0 and the number of the links in an interval of
(0.2:1] is much lower. (VD = 50, CI = 99%)
this solution outperforms both previous schemes as shown
in Figure 11, 13, and 12. This third solution features the
advantages of both schemes. Similar as ES, it does improve
the fairness drastically. Similar as JS, it improves the delay
characteristics to a greater extent. .
V. CONCLUDING REMARKS
We regard the following two as the main contributions.
The ﬁrst is an evaluation of oPBC, where we reveal that
the HN problem is the main cause of various quality
degradations especially when the network is unsaturated.
The detailed study shows that the (synchronized) HN causes
unfair SMR distribution and long no message interval in a

link of two vehicles. In some cases, such no message interval
equals to an entire link interval. The second contribution
is three simple but effective broadcasting schemes to ﬁx
the above issue that are fully compatible with the 802.11p
and can be very applicable in practice. Though the three
solutions do not affect the SMR (or reliability aspect) of the
entire network, they do show signiﬁcant improvements on
the fairness and delay aspects.
