Abstract—The composite Fe-C anode sputtering in a low 
pressure arc discharge has been used to produce Fe containing 
nanoparticles on a carbon matrix. The manufactured material 
was calcined stepwise in air from 300 to 1100 K. This 
procedure resulted in the formation of Fe oxides and oxidation 
of carbon and converting it into gas phase. The results show 
the change in morphology, chemical composition, crystalline 
phases and magnetic susceptibility properties with annealing 
temperature. This research is directed to elaborate on  new 
technologies for producing magnetic nanoparticles and 
ferrofluids from their basis. 
Keywords – magnetic nanoparticles; arc dicharge; ferrofluids.

 INTRODUCTION  
The magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are mainly used in 
ferrofluid technologies. Many chemical techniques are used 
to synthesize iron oxide nanoparticles for ferrofluids, 
including coprecipitation, hydrothermal reactions [1], sol–gel 
method [2], micro emulsions techniques [3], flow injection 
synthesis [4], aerosol/vapor methods, sonochemical reactions 
[5], electro spray synthesis [6], and electrochemical synthesis 
[7]. Nevertheless, the method mainly used for the generation 
of magnetite nanoparticles is chemical coprecipitation 
technique of iron salts [8] - [10]. Magnetic nanoparticles 
could not be kept as a powder because of their small size and 
strong interaction. Therefore, all the above mentioned 
technologies use surfactants to prevent agglomeration of 
magnetic nanoparticles directly in base fluids. In this paper, 
we present a new technology for manufacturing magnetic 
nanoparticles inside the carbon matrix, which allows the 
transportation of magnetic nanoparticles as a powder.  
The details of experimental setup and used probing 
techniques 
are 
presented 
in 
section 
“Experimental 
Development”. Section “Experimental Results” is devoted to 
the results obtained by Transmission Electron Microscopy 
(TEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Thermo gravimetric 
analysis (TGA), Raman scattering (RS) and magnetic 
susceptibility measurements. It is underlined in conclusion 
section that the arc discharge technology is perspective for 
ferrofluid applications. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL DEVELOPMENT 
The experiments were carried out in a direct current 
electric arc, which had a current of 120 A, in the buffer gas 
(helium) at 25 Torr. The spray electrode (anode) was a 
graphite rod 70 mm in length and 7 mm in diameter. A hole 
(with the diameter of 4 mm) was drilled in the center of the 
electrode to be filled with graphite – carbonyl iron mixture 
powder. Fe/C weight ratio was 2/1. Monatomic spray 
products were diffused in the buffer gas from the hot zone of 
the arc, which resulted in cooling and heterogeneous 
condensation of the spray products. The composite material 
was precipitated on a cooled shield located at 5 cm from the 
arc discharge area. The synthesized material consist of iron 
containing nanoparticles on a carbon matrix. For the second 
step, the synthesized Fe-C composite was calcined for two 
hours in air at 200, 300, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 700 and 
800 °C. This procedure resulted in the formation of Fe 
oxides and oxidation of carbon and removing it into the gas 
phase. TEM, XRD, TGA, RS and magnetic susceptibility 
measurements were used to test material properties at every 
step. 
High-resolution TEM images were obtained using the 
JEM-2010 electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with lattice-
fringe resolution of 0.14 nm and accelerating voltage of 200 
kV. The high-resolution images of periodic structures were 
analyzed by the Fourier method. Local energy-dispersive X-
ray analysis (EDXA) was carried out using the EDX 
spectrometer (EDAX Co.), which was fitted with a Si (Li) 
detector, at (!!!) resolution of 130 eV. The samples for the 
HRTEM study were prepared on a perforated carbon film 
mounted on a copper grid. 
XRD analysis was carried out using the Bruker 
D8Advance diffractometer, which was equipped with the 
Lynxeye (1D) linear detector, over the angular range of 10–
75◦ at 2Θ = 0.05◦ with the storage time of 1 s for each point. 
Monochromatic CuK-radiation (1.5418˚A) was applied in 
these experiments. 
TGA experiments were performed by the DTG60 H 
instrument (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments). 
The Raman spectra were taken on the Spex Triplemate 
instrument (Princeton Instruments, USA) at the wavelength 
of 488 nm. 
Magnetic 
susceptibility 
was 
measured 
by 
MS2 
susceptibility/temperature system (Bartington, Great Britain).

  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
A. Morphology of material  
Electron microscopy of the synthesized material 
indicated that it consist of amorphous carbon particles with 
inclusions of crystal nanoparticles of 2–10 nm (see Figure 1).  
Calcinations in air resulted in carbon removal g, oxidation of

iron and junction of nanoparticles (see Figures 2, 3). The 
morphology was transformed from separate nanoparticles 
into the 3-D random connected structures with expending 
size and the temperature of calcinations increasing. 
B. Thermogravimetric analysis 
Thermogravimetric analysis of synthesized materials has 
been carried out in two ways. Firstly, is the use of DTG60 
device, and secondly, is the step-wise calcinating at definite 
temperature for two hours and measuring the weight loss. 
Data are presented in Figure 4.

Both curves show the weight increase at the initial stage. 
Obviously, it is due to oxidation of iron containing particles. 
The step-wise analysis demonstrates that at 200 °C, most 
part of carbon reacts with oxygen (Fe nanoparticles 
probably served as catalyst) and it is removes from the 
sample.  The reason for the observed difference is the fact 
that the reaction times in both cases differed considerably. 
C. Phase composition   
X-ray 
diffraction 
spectroscopy 
shows 
that 
the 
synthesized material consists of graphite, iron and iron 
carbide (see Figure 5). Calcination of this material results in 
a change in composition. Even when calcinating at 300 °C, 
both α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 crystalline forms of iron oxide 
appeared, but iron and iron carbide lines disappeared in the 
spectrum (see Figure 6).

change in composition. Even when calcinating at 300 °C, 
both α-Fe2O3 and γ-Fe2O3 crystalline forms of iron oxide 
appeared, but iron and iron carbide lines disappeared in the 
spectrum (see Figure 6). 
Further calcinations resulted in γ-Fe2O3 disappearing and 
growing intensity of α-Fe2O3 (non-magnetic) as shown in 
Figure 7.  It is interesting to note that graphite line does not 
disappear even at 800 °C. 
D. Raman spectroscopy 
Raman spectra of materials calcinated at different 
temperatures are shown in Figure 8. Practically, no signals 
of iron oxides are seen up to the calcination temperature of 
300 °C. The main lines are: 225, 299, 400, 500, and 613 cm-
1.  Most lines identify α-Fe2O3, but line 500 cm-1 is the sum 
of γ-Fe2O3 (strong intensity) and α-Fe2O3 (week intensity) 
[11]. Data obtained by RS confirm XRD data, but we 
suppose that for our materials, XRD analysis is preferable 
for identification of phase composition with respect to 
Raman scattering.

temperatures. 
E. Magnetic susceptibility 
To measure magnetic susceptibility, about 200 mg of 
synthesized material was loaded into the measuring dish. The 
temperature dependency was measured by heating the 
sample and then cooling it in air. Results are shown in Figure 
9. Heating in air resulted in chemical reaction with oxygen 
and phase transition as it was noted before. So, the final 
weight of the sample was about 135 mg in accordance with 
TGA measurements (see Figure 4).  The same reason is that 
magnetic susceptibility was close to zero, while cooling.

CONCLUSIONS 
The arc discharge technology of manufacturing magnetic 
nanoparticles has been suggested and realized. The 
morphology, phase composition and magnetic susceptibility 
have been measured at calcination in air of up to 800 °C. We 
consider the synthesized material perspective for ferrofluid 
applications.  
The future research of this work is directed to 
optimization of the arc discharge parameters to reach the 
maximal value of magnetic susceptibility.
