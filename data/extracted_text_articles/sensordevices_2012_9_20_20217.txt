Abstract—This paper presents a concept to increase the 
performance of high frequency ultrasonic transducers. For a 
sandwich high frequency ultrasonic transducer, the top 
electrode should be smaller than the piezoelectric plate to 
avoid shortcuts and edge effects. However, its size can 
influence properties of the transducer, and until now there is 
no research about it published. A theoretical investigation 
about influence of the top electrode size on properties of a 
transducer is conducted in this paper. First, two factors related 
with the top electrode size based on transmission coefficient 
and stored energy are proposed; Then, analysis on an Al-AlN-
Al on silicon wafers with different electrode sizes are 
performed and the results prove the effectiveness and the 
validity of the proposed factors. Finally, electrical impedance 
matching experiments are conducted to improve the properties 
of transducers with different electrode sizes, and the 
experiment results show that the improved resolution and 
sensitivity after matching.

INTRODUCTION  
 In high-power ultrasonics and underwater acoustics, a 
sandwich piezoelectric structure is the most popular one. It is 
composed of piezoelectric elements, sandwiched between 
two metal films[1-2], and the analysis of sandwich 
piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers has been studied for 
many years[3-5].  
 Generally, sizes of the top electrode, the bottom 
electrode and the piezoelectric plate in a sandwich 
piezoelectric structure are same. However, for high 
frequency transducers, it is very easy for the two electrodes 
to get shortcuts or edge effects, as the thickness of the 
piezoelectric plate is very thin. Therefore, some researchers 
proposed the pyramid structure: the bottom electrode size is 
the biggest, then the smaller piezoelectric plate, and the top 
electrode is the smallest[1, 6-7]. Although, this structure can 
effectively avoid shortcuts and edge effects, the smaller top 
electrode can decrease the effective size of the active 
element, and it must have influence on the properties of the 
transducer. Therefore, it is important to research how the size 
of the top electrode can influence the properties of high 
frequency ultrasonic transducers. In this paper, through 
analysis on the echoes of transducers with different top 
electrode sizes and the Fourier transformation of them, we 
proposed two factors to explain the pattern that the top 
electrode size influences the transducers’ properties and 
conducted electrical impedance matching experiments to 
improve the properties of them.    
The content of the paper is listed as follows: in Section II, 
two factors are proposed to explain the relationship between 
the transducers’ properties and the top electrode size; then in 
Section III, analysis on an Al-AlN-Al structure on silicon 
wafers with different electrode sizes are performed and the 
results present the effectiveness of the proposed factors; 
Electrical impedance matching experiments are conducted to 
improve the properties of transducers with different electrode 
sizes in Section IV, and Section V is the conclusion. 
II. 
TWO IMPORTANT FACTORS 
       In a sandwich ultrasonic transducer with pyramid 
structure, the top electrode is smaller than the piezoelectric 
plate, and the active area of the piezoelectric plate is equal 
to the size of the top electrode, that means A=A′ in Fig. 1. So 
the size of the top electrode can influence the properties of 
the piezoelectric plate. In this section, we would explain its 
influence from the following two aspects.

A. Energy transmission coefficient  
      In electronics, when the electrical impedance of a load 
and a source is known, the fraction from the load can be 
calculated with Eq. (1), and the value produced is known as 
the reflection coefficient.

      The transmission coefficient, which represents the 
transmission fraction from the load to the source, is 
calculated by simple substrate the reflection coefficient from 
one,

Therefore, in order to transmit more energy into a 
transducer, the first important factor in practice is to match 
the electrical impedance of the transducer and the source, 
and increase the transmission coefficient.

where T is the transmission coefficient; PT is the energy 
transmitted into the transducer; Zin is the electrical 
impedance of the transducer. If the electrical impedance, 
which is in proportion with the top electrode size, is far away 
from the ideal value, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will be 
influenced and more noise will be received by the receiver 
[8].  
B. Stored Energy  
      For a sandwich ultrasonic transducer, energy stored in it 
can be calculated with voltage, electrode area and 
capacitance,

      Suppose Ps0=C0
′V2, if the thickness of the piezoelectric 
plate is fixed, the bigger the electrode is, the higher the 
stored energy. Therefore, the sensitivity, which is the ability 
of an ultrasonic system to defect defects, of a transducer with 
a constant thickness is proportional to the top electrode size. 
      
In order to design a transducer with high sensitivity, we 
should consider,

 Since both the transmission coefficient and the stored 
energy are related with the top electrode size, we should 
choose an optimal electrode size to improve the sensitivity 
and resolution of a transducer in real applications. 
III. 
ANALYSIS ON DIFFERENT ELECTRODE SIZE 
       In order to validate these factors, we analyzed Al-AlN-
Al transducers on silicon wafers with different top electrode 
sizes. In the experiment, a 500µm thick silicon substrate is 
used, on which a square shaped Al electrode with a large 
area is deposited. On the top of it, a squared shaped AlN 
layer with thickness of 10µm and area of 25mm2 is 
deposited, followed by a squared Al top electrode with an 
area of 25mm2, 1mm2, 0.25mm2 and 0.09mm2, respectively 
as shown in Fig. 2.   
 
Fig. 2 Our AlN transducer 
      First, we calculated the transmission coefficient from the 
source to the transducers with different electrode sizes and 
the energy stored on the capacitors with our theory, and the 
result can be seen in Table 1.

      From it, we can see that when the electrode size is 1mm2, 
both the transmission coefficient and the stored energy are 
high. While when the electrode is 25 mm2, even its 
transmission coefficient is as low as 19.8%, the energy 
stored on the capacitor is 12.5Ps0 in Joule, which is very high. 
So the amplitude of it should be higher than that of the 
echoes whose transmission coefficient is 51.9%, but the 
stored energy is only 0.125Ps0 in Joule.  When the electrode 
size is 0.09mm2, the stored energy and the transmission 
coefficient are both low, so the amplitude should be too low 
to be separated with noise.   
      Then, we measured the practical echoes of the 
transducers above and did Fourier transformation for them. 
The pulser and receiver DPR 500 (JSR Ultrasonics) was used 
138

to excite the transducers with a needle pulse at high 
amplitude (-143V) and very short pulse time (~1.4ns), and 
the input impedance of DRP 500 is 50 ohms. The receiver 
was set to a gain of 10 dB and a high frequency pass filter 
between 5MHz and 500MHz was used. The illustration in 
Fig. 3 shows the schematic setup of the measurement and the 
detailed measurement can be seen in Literature [9, 10]. Fig. 
4-5, Fig. 6-7, Fig. 8-9 and Fig. 10-11 are the results when the 
top electrode size is 25mm2, 1mm2, 0.25mm2 and 0.09mm2, 
respectively.

       From Fig. 4-5, we can see that when the electrode is 
25mm2, the maximal amplitude of the echoes is about 0.041 
V, which is related with the sensitivity of the transducer. 
That means the higher the amplitude of an echo is, the 
higher the sensitivity of the transducer is. However, the 
noise is also serious compared to the signal due to the lower 
transmission coefficient.  From the Fourier transformation 
result, we can see that there is an obvious narrow peak at 
232.5MHz. However, most frequency concentrates on the 
range from 50MHz to 200MHz, and there is a smaller peak 
around 100MHz because of noises.  
       Therefore, although the amplitude, or the sensitivity, of 
this kind of transducers is high, the transmission coefficient 
is lower and the bandwidth of the maximal frequency is 
only about 7.8 MHz.

      When the electrode is 1mm2, the maximal amplitude of 
the echoes is about 0.042 V and the noise is very small. That 
means the sensitivity of it is higher and at the same time the 
transmission coefficient is higher. From Fig. 7, we can see 
that there is only a peak at about 222MHz which is a little 
smaller than the peak frequency when the electrode is 
25mm2. However, on the both sides of the peak, the voltage 
decreases slowly, and there is no other peak. While in Fig. 
8, when the electrode is 0.25mm2, the maximal amplitude of 
the echoes is about 0.013 V and the noise is also obvious. 
There two obvious peaks at 235MHZ and 100MHz in Fig. 
9, and both of them are very sharp.

      When the electrode is 0.09mm2, the maximal amplitude 
of the echoes in Fig. 10 is about 0.001 V and the noise is too 
obvious that it is hard to distinguish the signal. From the 
Fourier transformation result in Fig. 11, we can see that 
there are two obvious peaks at 222MHz and 100MHz. At 
the both sides of the peaks, the voltage decreases sharply. 
Therefore, the sensitivity and revolution of the transducer 
are both lower.

      From these results, we can see the top electrode size of a 
transducer not only can influence the amplitude of echoes, 
but also can influence the maximal frequency and the 
bandwidth. For our transducers, when the area is 1mm2, the 
echoes from the substrate back wall are very clean, the 
resonant frequency of the transducer is high and the 
bandwidth is large. That means the sensitivity and 
resolution are both higher compared with other situations. In 
Table 1, from theoretical calculation the transmission 
coefficient of 1 is the highest, and the stored energy is 
0.5Ps0 in Joule which is also high. Therefore, the 
measurement results match our calculations in Table 1 very 
well.  
      During designing a transducer, both of the stored energy 
and the transmission coefficient need to be considered 
appropriately, and the top electrode size is a really important 
parameter. In real applications, we could choose an 
appropriate top electrode size of a transducer first and then 
improve the resolution and the sensitivity through electrical 
impedance matching. 
IV. 
ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE MATCHING 
During electrical impedance matching, normally the first 
step is to suppress the influence of the clamped capacitor C0 
with a parallel inductor, and use a transformer or a parallel 
resistor to regulate the input impedance, as shown in Fig. 
12.  For our transducer, when the electrode size is 1mm2, the 
inductor is10nH, and the electrical impedance after inductor 
matching is 414ohms, so we can use a parallel 55ohms 
resistor to match the electrical impedance to 50ohms. When 
the electrode size is 0.25 mm2, the matching inductor is 
40nH and the parallel resistor is 50ohms.

      First, we matched the electrical impedance with 
electrode size of 1mm2, and the echoes and the FFT of the 
first echo are shown in Fig. 13-14, where the blue line 
represents the result after matching and the red line with “x” 
represents the situation before matching.

 From them, we can see that the maximal amplitude of 
the first three echoes before matching is 0.0391V, while 
after matching it is 0.3438 V, so it increases 8.8 times; The 
peak frequency of the first echo before matching is 
225MHz, while after matching it is 275MHz. Therefore, 
after matching, the resolution and the sensitivity are both 
improved. 
 Second, we matched the electrical impedance with 
electrode size of 0.25mm2, and the result is shown in Fig. 
15-16. In this case, the maximal amplitude of the first three 
echoes before match is 0.0164V, while the maximal 
amplitude of the first echo after match is 0.0651V; the peak 
frequency of the first echo before match is 225MHz, while 
the peak frequency of the first echo after match is 275MHz.

       From these experiment results, we can see that through 
electrical impedance matching, the energy transmission 
coefficient can be improved and more energy can be 
transmitted into the transducers. So the amplitude of echoes 
improves so much and the working frequency of the 
transducers is close to the ideal frequency.

CONCLUSION 
      In this paper, we analyzed the influence of the top 
electrode size on the properties of a high frequency 
ultrasonic transducer based on transmission coefficient and 
stored energy in it. It turns out from our investigation that 
the top electrode size should be larger to improve the 
sensitivity of it, and the transmission coefficient, as well as 
SNR, can be improved by electrical impedance matching. 
Our contributions are as following aspects: 1) Two factors 
related with the top electrode size are proposed to explain 
the relationship between the top electrode size and the 
properties of the transducer; 2) Analysis on an Al-AlN-Al 
structure on Si wafers with different electrode sizes are 
performed and the results present the effectiveness and the 
validity of the proposed factors; 3) Electrical impedance 
matching experiments are conducted to improve the 
properties of transducers with different electrode sizes, and

it turns out that the resolution and sensitivity have been 
improved by electrical impedance matching.
