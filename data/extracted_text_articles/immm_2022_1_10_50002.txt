Abstract— In this work, we describe a Domain-Specific 
Language (DSL) demonstrator that controls the interaction 
with the user in an additive manufacturing environment. Its 
objective is to give appropriate answers to queries asked by a 
user. Several modules of the environment are used to bring 
theses answers: the DSL grammar, which lets users query the 
components of a complicated system without having to learn an 
unfamiliar query language; the user interface, which can be 
adaptable according to user needs; and the graph database 
management system developed to parse the knowledge base. All 
the modules share a central ontology describing the additive 
manufacturing domain. Our ontology is used both for building 
a formal grammar and as knowledge base, providing concept 
definitions.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The development of complex software systems within 
multidisciplinary sub-teams raises new software engineering 
challenges. It is important to understand complex problems 
and to give appropriate solutions. Model-Driven Engineering 
(MDE) [1] is the approach proposed to solve these 
challenges. It raises the level of abstraction in traditional 
programming languages by using models. MDE focuses on 
the use of models to understand, analyze, and develop 
complex software system.  MDE advocates the description of 
a system by a set of multiple Domain-Specific Languages 
(DSLs) [2].  
DSLs, as opposed to General Programing Languages 
(GPLs), are designed to describe a program at the adequate 
level of abstraction. DSLs narrow the gap between a problem 
domain and its implementation. Tools and collaboration of 
DSLs are among important research challenges [3] in model-
driving engineering. Particular challenges include tools for 
defining and composing domain-specific languages. Usually, 
different domain specific languages are used simultaneously 
to define the system from several viewpoints, hence the 
necessity of semantic interoperability and collaboration 
between them. 
In this work, we propose an approach based on ontology 
able to define DSL and which aims at a semantic 
interoperability between DSLs in a complex software system. 
The objective of this approach is to foster communication and 
collaboration among team members (developers, domain 
experts and end-users). This objective can be achieved since 
ontologies give a common semantic representation of the 
domain modeled, which can be shared by DSLs in Model-
Driven Software Engineering (MDSE).  
 In this paper, we propose a method to build a DSL in the 
context of the additive manufacturing domain. We define a 
Domain Specific Language describing the user Request 
(DSLReq) from Additive Manufacturing Ontology (AMO). 
The focus of this paper is to present a semantic support DSL 
demonstrator in Additive Manufacturing (AM) domain. Thus, 
our approach produces a grammar useful to parse an additive 
manufacturing knowledge base represented in a semantic 
graph. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:  In Section 
II, we present the research work related to our approach. In 
Section III, we present our grammar, its functionality and 
introduce its rules in part B. We also discuss the role of 
ontology in our approach in part A. In part C, we give a 
scenario example to explain our developed system. The paper 
ends with some concluding remarks and some guidelines for 
future work. 
II. RELATED WORK 
To understand the ontology role, we can refer to the 
ontology definition of Gruber [4] “explicit specification of 
conceptualization”, where conceptualization is “a set of 
objects, which an observer thinks exist in the world of interest 
and relations between them”. So, ontology O related to a 
domain D is a set of the concepts ® and relations ® among 
them as in (1). 
𝑂஽ =  {
஼∈஽
𝐶, 𝑅}  

Each ontology concept is defined by some properties and 
axioms. This definition makes ontologies very expressive and 
powerful means for domain modeling, and they are proposed 
as one of the approaches to create Domain Specific 
Languages (DSLs).  
Many research works use ontologies to support the 
development of DSLs. Ontologies help in the initial phase of 
DSL development called Domain Analysis Phase [5]. In this 
phase, the ontology defines the domain, its terminology, the 
concepts, and their dependencies.  
In [6], the authors proposed the OntoDSL tool that allows 
to use ontologies during the design phase and to guide the 
DSL programmer to develop an expressive language. 
OntoDSL provides automated reasoning services that can be

practically used by DSL designers and DSL users.  In other 
works, researchers emphasize the advantages of using 
ontologies to support DSLs development. For that reason, [7] 
proposes an Onto2Gra framework to automatically generate 
the DSL grammar from an ontology. This framework 
provides the mapping of concepts into grammar symbols 
based on Context Free Grammars (CFG), and the mapping of 
relations into grammar productions. These approaches used 
ontologies 
to 
solve 
DSL 
challenges, 
in particular 
interoperability with other languages, because more than one 
language must be combined in the modeling of systems.  
Ontologies have proved themselves in various domains as 
a tool for adding semantic to data and for achieving a 
desirable level of interoperability [6]. For that reason, we 
believe that ontology is the solution of both the interaction 
problem between heterogenous components within a 
complex computer system and the interaction problem 
between DSLs. 
 Our approach has the same goals as OntoDSL because it 
is a framework in a model-driven approach. Differently from 
OntoDSL our approach aims to build a DSL from an ontology 
able to parse the knowledge base. The result of our approach 
is a grammar describing a user request to get a response from 
the ontology and the AM domain without having to learn an 
unfamiliar query language. 
III. PRINCIPLE 
In this work, we present our approach in additive 
manufacturing context. The development and industrial 
adoption of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies 
required the development of computer systems able to aid 
decision making and the data management in a homogenous 
way.  Ontologies can answer these requirements because they 
have competencies [7] to both exchange data across 
applications and automatically reason over knowledge for 
decision making.  
Besides, additive manufacturing systems manifest a low 
degree of interoperability, and this creates an interaction 
problem between enterprises or different branches of an 
enterprise. Ontologies are valuable tools for solving such 
problems [8]. Given that,  an ontology builds on classes to 
represent 
materials, 
products 
components, 
process’s 
parameters, and process’s parts [9].  
Our approach is based on two pillars. The first pillar is a 
domain specific language that allows understanding, 
validation, and modification of the additive manufacturing 
domain. The second pillar is an ontology used both for the 
construction of a formal grammar and knowledge base, 
providing concept definitions.  
For that purpose, we define a framework based on 
ontology. This framework is structured around three 
interconnected models, as illustrated in Figure 1. AM 
ontology defines an additive manufacturing domain, a user 
interface, which generates a Cypher query [10] from our DSL 
grammar and a semantic graph database based on AM 
ontology. We have generated the DSLReq grammar from our 
ontology.  
 
 Figure 1. Approach Architecture 
 
In this section, we discuss firstly the ontology building 
method. Secondly, we explain the process of DSLReq 
generation and the role of ontology in this process. 
A. Additive Manufacturing Ontology (AMO) 
The methodology of developing an ontology is chosen 
according to the complexity of the domain and its 
requirements. For the manufacturing domain, the method 
MOP (Machine of a Process) [11] is used. MOP aims to reuse 
existent ontology to limit the development from scratch. 
Upper-level ontology for manufacturing was used as a 
reference to evaluate and to improve specific domain 
ontology. Thus, this method aims to hold interoperability 
among domain users.  In order to achieve a high-level of 
interoperability, we developed our additive manufacturing 
ontology according to the research work in [9].  
 [9] proposes first the reuse of upper-level ontology 
DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive 
Engineering) [12] to facilitate the grouping of classes sharing 
common high-level characteristics. Second, it proposes the 
extension 
of 
the 
upper-level 
branch 
to 
additive 
manufacturing.  
The AM ontology includes broad classes and relations, 
which can be easily specialized to meet specific modeling 
scenarios 
and 
requirements: 
MATERIAL, 
NON-
QUANTITATIVE VALUE SPACE, OBJECT, PROCESS 
and TYPE. OBJECT covers three classes: PYSICAL 
OBJECT, 
ORGANIZATION, 
and 
DESCRIPTION. 
PYSICAL OBJECT covers various classes, among which 
MFGDEVICE, PRODUCT, and FEATURE. MFGDEVICE 
is composed of various classes, the most important one being 
MFGMACHINE for the conceptualization of manufacturing 
machines. AMMACHINE defines an explicit model for 
additive manufacturing machines. AMMACHINE has a 
relationship 
with 
the 
AMPROCESS 
class 
called 
MecanismOf. This relationship gives all processes in which 
a machine can participate.   
Axioms are added to explain that a machine may never be 
employed in any manufacturing process, for example, as 
defined in (2):

The ontology supports the instances of concepts and 
relations between them. We use the Protégé plug-in to 
populate our ontology. 
B. From ontology to DSL grammar  
Within our system, grammar advocates the description of 
user queries by a set of domain-specific language rules. Each 
rule consists of an ontology element: concept, relation, or 
attribute. Our approach is to build a DSL grammar able to 
generate a Cypher request to parse AMO. For that purpose, 
we define the request structure according to the ontology 
structure.  
To convert the ontology into a grammar, we define a set 
of translation rules. The rules are defined in a hierarchical 
structure. Get is the super rule that connects all rules. It is 
composed of three sub-rules: Type, Where and Return. 
Firstly, the Type rule is the result of rule translation to map 
concepts and relations into the grammar. Secondly, the 
Where rule defines constraints of cardinality like RDFS range 
and RDFS domain within the grammar. Finally, the Return 
rule translates ontology instances corresponding to the 
request result (Figure 3).  
 
Figure 3. From ontology to DSL 
Each rule is related to an element in the ontology. So, the 
grammar is composed of three elements related to the 
ontology: Node, Relation and Property. The grammar 
always starts by Type rule. The request takes as its input the 
elements in the Type rule, operates on them as specified in the 
Where and Return rules, and then produces the RDF triple 
researched by the user. The grammar structure is presented in 
rule (3):  
 
𝐺𝑒𝑡:   
{Get}ᇱGetᇱ൫type = (Type)൯(′Whereᇱ(clauses+=
Clause) ∗)? (retours = (Return))     
The Type rule defines the input type of the request. An 
input may be a concept, a relation, or a property of the AM 
ontology. For that reason, the Type rule contains a Node 
element corresponding to an ontology concept.  It also 
contains a Relation rule. The Relation rule is composed of the 
ontology relation and a range of relation called destNode. The 
Type rule is presented in (4), where C, C’ are ontology 
concepts and Rel is the relation between them: 

𝐶 𝑟𝑒𝑙 𝐶′ ⟹ 𝑇𝑦𝑝𝑒 : 
{type}(firstNode = Node)(relations +  = RelationTo)) ∗ 
RelationTo: 
(relation = Rel)(destNode = Node) 
Rel: 
{Rel}(name = ID)?ᇱ :ᇱ (relationName = ID|ᇱAllᇱ) 
 Node: 
{Node}(name = ID)? ′: ′(className = ID|ᇱAll′) 
 
The Where rule defines constraints about an ontology 
element. The constraint is defined by an operator and its 
value. A constraint about an attribute is called data property 
in OWL [14]. We use a second rule in our grammar to define 
this constraint. Considering C, a concept of AM ontology and 
p its data type property. We define a restriction on p as 
follows (5): 

𝑝 𝐷𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑝 h𝑎𝑠 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 ⟹ 𝐶𝑙𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒: 
(property = ID)ᇱof ᇱ(node = [Node]) 
(operator = Operator)(value = Value) 
 
The Return rule lists the result of the query. The query 
result is defined in the Return rule, as seen in (6). A function 
is a facultative element, which presents any logic and 
mathematic functions that we can apply to a property. Our 
rule returns instances from the ontology according to type and 
constraints defined in the mentioned grammar rules in (4) and 
(5). 

𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛: 
{Return}ᇱReturnᇱ(properties+= Property) + 
Property: 
(function = Function)? propertyNam = IDᇱof ᇱnode
= [Node]

The elements defined in our DSL grammar are instances 
of EObject of Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) [15] 
Ecore models. To implement our DSL grammar, we use the 
Xtext [16] tool of the EMF ecosystem.  
C. Scenario example  
In this scenario example, we explain our system by 
considering the following user story: we seek the process list 
where the hatching in micrometer equals to 35. This list aims 
to classify processes in categories.  
To answer this user story, there are four steps: 
1. The user can write a simple query without having to 
learn a Cypher language like in (7).  In our interface, 
we define queries templates with our DSLReq, 
which can help the user to autocomplete the request. 
𝑮𝒆𝒕 𝑛: 𝐴𝑀𝑀𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑒 𝑟: 𝑚𝑒𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑚𝑂𝑓 𝑚: 𝐴𝑀𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠   
𝑾𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆 ℎ𝑎𝑠𝐻𝑎𝑡𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐼𝑛𝑀𝑖𝑐𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑚 = 35 
𝑹𝒆𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒏 𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙 𝑜𝑓 𝑚                             
 
2. The query must have a syntactic and semantic 
validation. Our DSL validator generates an error if 
the term given by the user is not in the AM ontology. 
3. The system generates a Cypher query by using the 
Query generator (Figure 4). 
 
Figure 4. Cypher query 
 
4. The system connects to the knowledge base and 
parses the ontology by using this request. Finally, it 
gives the AMProcess list appropriate to answer the 
user query. 
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we proposed a query demonstrator able to 
give appropriate results for user requests by using a DSL 
grammar. All modules of our system shared a central 
ontology describing the additive manufacturing domain. 
 This ontology is used for building and validation of a 
DSL request. It is also used to support queries for retrieving 
that knowledge. However, an additive manufacturing 
environment requires knowledge contributions from different 
stakeholders, so it is necessary for software engineering to 
interact with other engineering disciplines. For that reason, 
the presented approach needs to be complemented by a set of 
multiple Domain-Specific Languages. Each DSL will relate 
to an engineering discipline and will be in interaction with the 
other DSLs. To achieve these results, the ontology will 
provide interoperability between the DSLs in our system.
