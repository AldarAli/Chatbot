Abstract—Internet and web technologies have evolved over 
the past 50 years to a patchwork of architectures, frameworks, 
applications/services and protocol stacks, with many actors 
contributing solutions as well as novel uses of the technology 
emerging rapidly. A drive from the European Commission 
(EC) called Next Generation Internet (NGI) supports 
developers, researchers and entrepreneurs towards building a 
human-centric Internet, focusing on privacy and trust as 
central themes and building contributions based on Open-
Source Software (OSS). This paper reviews 32 projects 
supported by the EC in terms of their OSS community 
contributions and the planned sustainability of their solutions 
and organisation.  
Keywords — Internet architecture, network, transport, 
applications, services. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This article presents work in progress of an analysis of 
Next Generation Internet projects regarding their financial 
sustainability and overall contribution to the evolution of  
Internet Architecture. It includes projects covering all layers 
of the Internet and its core applications and new 
communication paradigms on decentralisation. 
In 2017, a new European initiative called the Next 
Generation Internet was created to support European values 
in the future development of the Internet and related 
technologies. Robert Viola states in his speech [1]: 
”When policy-makers, researchers and society reflect on the 
future evolution of the Internet, we should take a fresh look 
at all these issues. The Internet should offer more to the 
people and to our society, providing better services and 
greater involvement and participation. It should be designed 
for humans, so that it can meet its full potential for society 
and economy and reflect the social and ethical values that 
we enjoy in our societies.” 
      The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II 
introduces the background of the data, followed by the 
categorisation of the projects in Section III. The most 
significant cases are described in Section IV. Section V 
proposes future research and conclusion. The article is 
finalised with acknowledgement for the projects which 
allow data collection and research work within open-source 
projects. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
Data for this article originates from the NGI Pointer [2] 
project. NGI Pointer supported a total of 36 OSS projects 
with grants ranging from 50,000EUR to 200,000EUR to 
develop topics around Next Generation Internet Architecture. 
A total of 250 applicants were evaluated. An independent 
committee of experts selected the projects based on a set of 
common criteria. The project addressed topics included: 
Privacy-by-design; 
Internet 
at 
the 
Edge; 
Network 
Optimisation; Virtualisation and isolation; Limitations in the 
TCP/IP protocol suite; Autonomous Network operations and 
control; Energy efficiency; Industrial Internet Security; Trust 
for New Internet/Web Users. 
32 out of the 36 projects are studied in this research 
article. Three projects were excluded due to the limited 
information the projects provided publicly. One project 
(Nyxt) received two separate grants from NGI Pointer and is 
treated as one project for this research work. 
All data collected in this research is publicly available on 
the various websites of the projects, organisations and code 
repositories (See Tables 1-3). The data was collected over a 
period of three years, starting in January 2020, with the 
project to conclude in December 2022. Several interviews, 
dialogues and a podcast series helped enrich the information 
and clarified ambiguous data. The podcasts are available 
publicly [3]. 
III. 
CATEGORISATION OF PROJECTS 
The Internet architecture can be broken down into six 
layers [4]. In this article, the six layers are bundled into: 
• 
Applications and Services: 
o 
Specific applications and services  
o 
Application protocols  
• 
Network and Transport Layers 
o 
Transport protocols 
o 
Network protocols  
• 
Other 
o 
Data-link protocols 
o 
Physical layer protocols 
The “other” category also includes projects that do not 
fall strictly into any other layers, such as hardware projects 
related to chip design or chip design tools and 
communication systems spanning several layers. 
IV. 
REVIEW OF NEXT GENERATION INTERNET CASES 
Tables 1-3 provide a complete list of the studied projects. 
Furthermore, a few of them must be highlighted as 
particularly interesting projects.

A. Case Examples 
SCION is an initiative that has been ongoing for over a 
decade, with over 50 individuals, mostly from research, 
participating in the development of SCION [5]. The 
contribution from NGI Pointer is a public grant to develop a 
specific mechanism called VerfiedRouting for SCION. 
SCION, as such, is then a publicly funded open research 
project. However, alongside the development as an open 
research project, the founder and founding university created 
a spin-off called Anapaya that also monetises SCION 
through corporate distribution and offers consulting-style 
services around the technology to customers, mostly 
financial institutions and Internet Service Providers. 
WireGuard is a straightforward yet fast and modern VPN 
that utilises state-of-the-art cryptography [6]. It was initially 
released for the Linux kernel but has since been ported to all 
major operating systems. The project is a large open 
community project that has largely been supported by public 
funds, however, the key persons behind the technology also 
operate consultancies offering consulting services in cyber 
security, amongst other topics. In addition, Wireguard is now 
provided via Mozilla as a corporate distribution. Finally, 
WireGuard also accepts donations to the project via its 
website. 
Ltt.rs is a user-friendly and encrypted by default e-Mail 
client for Android based on modern standards like JMAP 
(RFC8621) [7] and Autocrypt [8]. Using JMAP instead of 
IMAP makes the app more maintainable and reliable on 
current mobile operating systems due to the built-in push 
capabilities. Ltt.rs is sponsored via public funding but 
simultaneously offers a small-scale corporate distribution of 
the application as a freemium/premium application. 
Nyxt is a keyboard-driven web browser designed for 
power users. Inspired by Emacs [9] and Vim [10], it has 
familiar key bindings and is infinitely extensible in Lisp. For 
example, users can switch between tabs by topic or URL, 
search all URLs on a page by name or target, search through 
all of the bookmarks with compound queries, etc. Nyxt 
focuses on corporate distribution as a freemium/premium 
application, where the basic version of the browser is free to 
use, and tools, as well as add-ons, become part of a 
subscription-based service at a premium. Additionally, the 
team behind Nyxt is offering consulting services. 
The PANAPI [11] project designs a sophisticated host-
based network-path selection engine on top of the SCION [5] 
network architecture and provides it as an open-source 
implementation of the abstract next-generation transport 
service API, currently being drafted in the IETF TAPS 
Working Group. The project is an OSS-sponsored project 
and 
predominantly 
an 
open 
research 
project 
with 
contributions to standards.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This article presents a first look at 32 projects under the 
umbrella of the NGI. The aim is to analyse the projects from 
a financial sustainability perspective and gain a more general 
understanding of how to support and grow future Internet 
initiatives through public, private and community support. 
More projects need to be studied to find more evident trends 
and develop a model of modern Business Model Patterns for 
open-source software and hardware projects driven by 
European Values under the NGI. 
A suggested framework for such analysis is based on [4], 
but other theoretical and practical studies should be 
considered.

DT4DW: Developer Tools for 
Decentralised 
Web 
 
The essential technologies to build a decentralised web are 
available today, but the broader ecosystem and uptake are still in 
its infancy. One reason for this is a lack of developer tooling. 
Moving from traditional client/server architectures to building 
decentralised applications requires developers to replace many 
day-to-day debugging & testing tools with manual logging, 
custom scripts and guesswork. This tooling gap contributes to the 
significant difficulties of decentralised development today. By 
extending HTTP Toolkit and Mockttp to support IPFS, WebRTC 
and Ethereum, this project gives developers the tooling to debug 
and test next-generation decentralised web applications.
