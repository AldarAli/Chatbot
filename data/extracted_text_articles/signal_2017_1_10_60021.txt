Abstract—Active contour models are designed to evolve an initial
curve, called level set, to extract the desired object(s) in an image.
Various models are used, such as Chan-Vese (CV) model. The
CV model has the global segmentation property to segment all
objects in an image. The problem with this model is the high time
computing. In order to reduce it, our contribution in this work
is the association of a semi-implicit Additive Operator Splitting
(AOS) technique with the CV model in biphase and multiphase
cases. In this paper, we present the new association in biphase
and multiphase cases with simulations showing the efﬁciency of
the proposed method.

INTRODUCTION
Image segmentation is the task of partitioning an image
into multiple regions. The most known region based method
has been proposed by Mumford Shah [1] who have introduced
a general optimization framework. To determine desired curves
or surfaces, this method uses an energy functional based on
regional geometric properties such as the area of the region, its
contour length and the variation of individual pixel intensities
inside and outside the region. However, the Mumford Shah
[2] model cannot be easily implemented. The CV method [2]
is a special implementation of Mumford Shah using a level
set function for the case of two phases with two piecewise
constants. The basic idea of CV model is to minimize energy
functional by solving the Euler-Lagrange equation. This min-
imisation takes enough time in image segmentation.
To reduce the time of segmentation, Weickert et al. [3]
provide a fast algorithm using the semi-implicit AOS scheme.
The basic idea behind the AOS schemes is to decompose a
multi-dimensional problem into one-dimensional ones that can
be solved very efﬁciently. Then the ﬁnal multi-dimensional
solution is approximated by averaging the one-dimensional
solutions. In [4], the authors present a combination of the
semi-implicite AOS scheme and a narrow-band technique
which is associated to the geodesic active contours. This
association requires re-initialization for each iteration which
is the weakness of the method. As solution, Kuhne et al. [5]
provide a fast algorithm using an semi-implicit AOS scheme
technique which is suitable both for the geometric and the
geodesic active contour model. In [6], the authors propose
a new selective segmentation model, combining ideas from
global segmentation, that can be reformulated in a convex
way such that a global minimizer can be found independently
of initialization. They present the Convex Distance Selective
Segmentation (CDSS) functional (based on CV model) which
is associated with the semi-implicite AOS scheme. In our work,
we use a level set representation of the CV model with the
semi-implicite AOS scheme in order to improve the speed of
the segmentation in biphase and multiphase cases.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a
review of level set method and the CV model for biphase and
multiphase cases. In Section 3, we present the semi-implicite
AOS scheme. Then, we present the CV model with the semi-
implicite AOS scheme in biphase and multiphase cases in
Section 4. Experimental results are given in Section 5.

ACTIVE CONTOUR MODELS
In this section, we shall ﬁrst provide an overview of level
set theory before we get into the details of the CV model.
A. Level set method
A level set method is a numerical technique, which helps
with tracking moving fronts to interfaces and shapes. This
technique was ﬁrst introduced by Osher et al. in [7], where the
boundaries are given by level sets of a function φ(x), naming
it as the level set method. This method is very successful due
to a very easy way of following shapes that change topology.
For a given interface Γ = ∂Ω as shown in Figure 1, the level
set is independent of the parametrisation of the contour and
can be used to represent the interface evolution. The idea of
the level set method is to implicitly represent an interface Γ
as the level set of a function φ. The level set function φ of the
closed front Γ is deﬁned as follows:
( φ(x) > 0 inside Γ
φ(x) < 0 outside Γ,
φ(x) = 0 on Γ.
Where x ∈ R2.
The adjusting contour at time t is denoted by φ(x(t); t)
( φ(x(t); t) > 0 inside Γ
φ(x(t); t) < 0 outside Γ,
φ(x(t); t) = 0 on Γ.
The level set value of a point on the contour with motion
must always be 0.
φ(x(t); t) = 0

A derivation of (1) with respect to t and after some
manipulation, yields PDE equation:
∂φ
∂t + F|∇φ| = 0

gates in normal direction with an initial condition φ(x, t = 0)
(the initial drawn curve).
B. The CV model
1) biphase case: In [2], the authors present a special
implementation of the CV method based on the use of the
level set method to minimize the piecewise constant two phases
Mumford Shah functional [1]. The advantage of this imple-
mentation is the possibility to detect objects whose boundaries
are not necessarily deﬁned by gradient and overcame the
problematic tracking of Γ. For a given image u0 in domain
Ω, the CV model is formulated by minimizing the following
energy functional :
F CV

δ(φ)|∇φ|dxdy + ν

(3)
λ2
Z
Ω
|u0(x, y) − c2|2(1 − H(φ(x, y)))dxdy
Where µ, λ1 and λ2 are positive parameters, φ is a level
set function, H(φ) is the Heaviside function and δ(φ) is the
Dirac function. Generally, the regularized versions are selected
as follows:
(
Hϵ(φ) = 1

The two piecewise constants c1 and c2 are deﬁned as
c1 =
R
Ω u0(x, y)Hϵ(φ(x, y))dxdy
R
Ω Hϵ(φ(x, y))dxdy
,
(5)
c2 =
R
Ω u0(x, y)(1 − Hϵ(φ(x, y)))dxdy
R
Ω(1 − Hϵ(φ(x, y)))dxdy
,
(6)
The evolution equation is given by :
∂φ
∂t = δϵ(φ)[µ∇.( ∇φ
|∇φ|)−ν−λ1(u0−c1)2+λ2(u0−c2)2] (7)
2) multiphase case: The CV model for multiphase piece-
wise constant (we use two level set functions φ1 and φ2) is
formulated by minimizing the following energy functional [8]:
Fϵ,4

(u0 − c11)2 Hϵ (φ1) Hϵ (φ2) dxdy

Where
c11(φ) =

Ω u0Hϵ(φ1)Hϵ(φ2)dxdy
R
Ω Hϵ(φ1)Hϵ(φ2)dxdy ,
(9)
c10(φ) =
R
Ω u0Hϵ(φ1)(1 − Hϵ(φ2))dxdy
R
Ω Hϵ(φ1)(1 − Hϵ(φ2))dxdy ,
(10)
c01(φ) =
R
Ω u0(1 − Hϵ(φ1))Hϵ(φ2)dxdy
R
Ω(1 − Hϵ(φ1))Hϵ(φ2)dxdy ,
(11)
c00(φ) =
R
Ω u0(1 − Hϵ(φ1))(1 − Hϵ(φ2))dxdy
R
Ω(1 − Hϵ(φ1))(1 − Hϵ(φ2))dxdy ,
(12)
Evolution equations of φ1 and φ2 are given by:
∂φ1
∂t
=
δϵ(φ1){µdiv( ∇φ1
|∇φ1|)
−[((u0 − c11)2 − (u0 − c01)2)(Hϵ(φ2))
(13)
+((u0 − c10)2 − (u0 − c00)2)(1 − Hϵ(φ2))]}
∂φ2
∂t
=
δϵ(φ2){µdiv( ∇φ2
|∇φ2|)
−[((u0 − c11)2 − (u0 − c10)2)(Hϵ(φ1))
(14)
+((u0 − c01)2 − (u0 − c00)2)(1 − Hϵ(φ1))]}

AOS SCHEME
The AOS method is proposed by Tai et al. in [9] and
Weickert et al. in [3]. The AOS scheme guarantees equal
treatment of all coordinate axes and is stable for big time
steps. The scheme presents the semi-implicit algorithm based
on a discrete non-linear diffusion scale-space framework. This
scheme is applied to the m-dimensional diffusion equation and
it is given in the following form:
∂φ
∂t = div(g∇φ) + f(x, φ).

Where [0, T] × Ω ⊂ Rm. The initial and boundary condi-
tions are:

∂φ
∂n = 0 on ∂Ω,

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In the biphase case, the constants are given as follow
ν = 0, ∆t = 1 and λ1 = λ2 = 1. In Figures 2 and 3, we
illustrate the segmentation by the CV model for boat and MR
of knee images. In Figures 4 and 5, we show the segmentation
by the CV model with semi-implicite AOS scheme for the
same images. The segmentation illustrates the two phases and
the results are almost similar for the two methods. For the
multiphase case, the constants are given as follow ν = 0 and
λ1 = λ2 = 1. In Figures 6 and 7, we illustrate the segmentation
by the CV model for boat and MR of knee images, but in
Figures 8 and 9 we show the segmentation by the CV model
with the semi-implicite AOS scheme for the same images. The
two methods give exactly the same segmentation where we
can see the four phases. The comparison study relative to time
computing is summarized in Tables I and II; we deduce that
the CV model with semi-implicite AOS scheme reduces the
time computing of the segmentation by half.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have used the advantages of the semi-
implicit AOS technique in order to fast the CV model for
image segmentation in biphase and multiphase cases. The
experimental results show that the segmentation is done in the
two cases, with the the superiority of the CV model with the
semi-implicite scheme compared to the CV model concerning
the time computing. As future work, we plan to associate the
semi-implicit AOS technique with other active contour models.
