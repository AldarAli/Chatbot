Abstract - As Information Communication Technology
(ICT) has become more and more popular in our life,
researchers
have
begun
to
focus
attention
on
its
potentialities in the running of Polytechnic Distance
Education Programs for the development of super-
structures.
In 1978,
The Enugu State Broadcasting
Service and Institute of Management and Technology
collaboratively
established
the
first
Higher
National
Diploma Certificate Radio Program in Nigeria. This
paper discusses the uses of Information Communication
Technology
in
the
running
of
Polytechnic
Distance
Education Program in the 21st Century. Also, its features,
rationale, implementations, and challenges, as well as
recommendations, are discussed. The impact of ICT is
presented on what is learned, when, where and how, and
how teaching and learning take place. This is to foster a
generation of technological tools and technology-based
information age. It has not been as extensive in distance
education as it is in other fields in Nigeria, hence this
study.

Information age.
I.
INTRODUCTION
In 1978, the Enugu State Broadcasting Service and the
Institute of Management and Technology agreed to run a
Polytechnic Distance Education Program to carry out the
social service functions of the Institute, apart from
teaching
and
research
functions. The program
was
introduced to respond to the growing needs of the society,
which are not easily met by the traditional form of
education in Nigeria [1]. The fundamental rationale for
the program includes:

To provide an opportunity for higher education
for adults who, for different reasons, did not
have the opportunity of early education.

To complement the efforts of institutions of
higher learning.

To provide manpower needs for the nation

To increase the number of well-educated citizens

To provide general knowledge for the citizens
In Nigeria, according to official statistics, out of 43
million pupils who ought to be in primary schools, only
20 million are attending school. The implication is that
over 50% of children of primary school age are out of
schools. At secondary school level, 33.9 million students
ought to be in school, but only 6.4 million are enrolled,
translating to 27.9 million children out of secondary
education. Even where access to education has improved,
the school system is struggling to
meet improved
demands, but still the quality of education continues to
suffer. In some states in Nigeria, hidden costs and lack of
infrastructure still keep a large number of children out of
school. There has also been a chronic under-investment in
Early-Childhood Education and Adult Literacy programs.
The outcome has been the prevalence of mediocrity and
lawlessness in the society. These have led to more and
more children joining the multitude of street urchins,
suicide bombers, armed robbers, child laborers, Boko
Haram and prostitutes, among others [2][3].
In
today’s
competitive
environment,
productivity
levels have a direct impact on the success of any nation.
When a nation decides that improving productivity is its
priority, there are three areas to focus on: technological
productivity,
worker
productivity
and
managerial
productivity. ICT is the power that propels this shared
world. For any nation’s economy to engage in profitable
activity, experts agree that the workforce must be ICT
compliant [4]. Today’s world is driven by knowledge,
which translated into efficiency and effectiveness in
production. However, the case in Nigeria is different. This
calls for a serious concern so as to save Nigeria’s
Polytechnic Distance Education Program from crisis.
ICT
offers
valuable
opportunity
for
innovative
delivery of effective learner-centered services with the
advent of personal computer, CD, DVD, Internet, mobile
phone, and other digital devices. ICT offers blended
learning tools and instruments necessary to transform

available technological and a variety of other forms of
instruction at a distance, to deliver knowledge and skills
to learners. Education is a socially legitimate knowledge
that certainly helps individuals to obtain skills, better jobs,
and higher salaries. The possibility of achieving success
in this way in Nigeria is by making education and
learning a need and a task for all. This requires bringing
education and learning close to the people, developing
and synchronizing local community’s learning potentials
and efforts within a comprehensive development strategy,
with financial support [5].
The
21st
Century
is
characterized
by
business
development at Internet speed, short product cycle, short
knowledge life span, changing literacy requirements,
more career switching and continuous learning. In parallel
to the flux of globalization, Nigeria has an urgent need for
key strategies in re-building its competitive human capital
to meet the new age challenges [6]. ESBS/IMT Polyair
has taken some measures to improve practices online to
ensure compliance and advancement in ICT development.
Effective integration of ICT and pedagogical use of
technology to bring Distance Learning transformation has
been eagerly sought in the past four years. The strategic
necessity of ICT in Distance Education Program (DEP) of
ESBS/IMT Polyair has been inspired with a new face, the
flexible Just-in-Time (JIT). “Distinct Blended Learning
Approach (DBLA) for the 21st Century” can be taken at
one’s convenience, with a connected community. For
example, e-tools, helpdesk by phone or e-mail and
discussion forums are in place for learners. Learners are
allowed to choose a mode of learning in Distance
Learning (DL) courses. The ultimate aim of ICT in DL is
to provide learners with the flexibility of study anytime,
anyplace in a JIT mode. Study resources that help with
Academic Advice, Technical Support and Peer Support
are available via virtual learning environment at anytime
and anyplace [7].
II.
IMPLEMENTATION AND RATIONALE
Distance Education is not inherently learner-friendly.
Adults choose to study part-time through this learning
environment because it is the most convenient or the only
educational option available. Adults choose Distance
Learning
because
it
offers
a
manageable
way
of
combining
study
with
family,
work,
friends
and
everything else they have to do. In all other respects, this
is a demanding way to study, especially for a Polytechnic
Higher National Diploma, which takes several years to
complete [8].
Information Communication Technology
has made Distance Education Programs attractive, cost-
effective and easier by the use of blended learning
implementations, such as Internet, intranet, CDROMS,
Video and Audio cassettes, films, radio and television as
well as telephone services. Tele-working, the internet and
intranet CDROM, PC and electronic media are some
distinguishing
aspects
of
ICT.
They
are
becoming
increasingly used for DEP to respond to the growing
educational needs which are not easily met by the
traditional forms of education in Nigeria [9][10]. Some of
the Distance Educational needs include:
i.
To
have
courses
for
learners
in
scattered
communities and caring for the socially and
geographical isolated.
ii.
Providing educational opportunities for adults
who had no opportunity of early education.
iii.
To bring into DE during Face-to-Face (FTF)
expert
knowledge,
rare
experiences
and
stimulating personalities
iv.
To have cost effective program for a large
number of learners.
v.
To join hands with the Global Campaign on
Education for ALL (EFA)
vi.
To initiate National Campaigns which deal with
health and political issues [11].
III. QUIXOTIC POTENTIALS OF ICT IN
POLYTECHNIC DEP
Quixotic potentials of ICT in Polytechnic DEP
include the following:
A.
Learning Resources
The
printed
materials
tend
to
set
fixed
boundaries to a course and can date quickly. ICT
supports a model of resource-based learning and
offering
access
to
a
vast
store
house
of
information, data and contact [12].
B.
Greater Individualization
Distance Education has been likened to an
“industrial” model of teaching, but from the
learners perspective, the experience can feel like
being an anonymous number in the system
taking a standard course. ICT facilitates self-
directed study and opportunities for individual
research and projects. It also helps to break down
the
bureaucratic
relationship
between
the
individual and the institution.

C.
Greater Integration
ICT exposes the differences, but enforces a
better integrated approach which enables the
learner to move seamlessly from one area of
activity to another [13].
D.
Learning Community
ESBS/IMT
Polyair
learners
welcome
opportunities for contact and interactions with
other learners and their facilitators and there is a
program of FTF tutorial support. However, in a
typical course, tutorials are neither frequent nor
local. The use of e-mail and computer mediated
conferencing has the potential to enable the
learner to become an active member of a
learning community with easy access to fellow
students in their group, their tutor, students on
the course nationally and the course team. The
potentials
of
ICT
in
the
new
learning
technologies will be to strengthen the sense of a
learning community which is more accessible,
personal, interactive and integrated, and, as a
result, reducing the distance in distance learning.
E.
ICT Potentials
ICT has the greatest potential for Distance
Education which spawns human resources, social
and economic development. It is said to be the
single most pursued goal of nations. Information
Communication
Technology
accelerates
the
development of students as learners through the
provision of more materials for reading and more
opportunities for simulation, problem-posing and
solving [14].
It is envisaged
that the
introduction of ICT
in
ESBS/IMT Polyair program, software in learning and
instruction
will
promote
rapid
dissemination
of
knowledge even to the excluded and also reduce the
constraints associated with time and space. Moreover, the
constraints have continued to swell the rank of illiterate
Nigerians. The illiteracy rate in Nigeria is put at 57%. It
means that, with an estimated population of 164,000,000,
not less than 95 million Nigerians are illiterate [15].
IV.
LECTURERS AND STUDENTS
PERCEPTION OF ICT APPLICATION IN
ESBS/IMT POLYTECHNIC DISTANCE
EDUCATION IN NIGERIA
A total of one hundred and thirty lecturers teach in
ESBS/IMT Polytechnic Distance Education Program. To
find
out
the
extent
of
application
of
information
Communication
Technology
devices,
seventeen
questionnaire items were formulated. Statistically, Likert
type 4 points scale was used to elicit responses from the
lecturers, as shown in Table I:
-
Very adequate
(VA) = 4 points
-
Adequate
(A)
= 3 points
-
Inadequate
(I)
= 2 points
-
Very inadequate
(VI) = 1 point

The data in Table I. above indicates that the mean score
ranges from 1.00 to 4.00. Whereas item 7 has a mean
score of 4.00, item 1 has a mean score of 3.69. All other
items scored below the positive mean score of 2.5.
Table I shows that 2 out of 17 ICT devices ranked
positive. This suggests that the application of information
communication technology devices in the teaching and
learning by lecturers is not yet satisfactory. Hence, the
rationale for this study.

V.
CHALLENGES OF ICT IN POLYTECHNIC
DISTANCE EDUCATION PROGRAMMES IN
NIGERIA
Here are some of the challenges of ICT in Polytechnic
Distance Education Programs in Nigeria:
A.
Over-centralization of decision-making and lack
of stakeholders’ involvement in decision-making
in Polytechnic Distance Education Programs.
This encourages patronage of powerful special
interests and high level of corruption therein.
B.
Corruption
diverts
scarce
funds
from
development projects and social safety nets into
private pockets. In Nigeria, corruption related to
weak governance and patronage-based politics
has fuelled unproductive public investment. The
opportunities for livelihood of Nigerians have
been reduced, exacerbating poverty and conflict.
With per capita income falling significantly to
less than $300 between 1980 and 2011 (which is
below
the
sub-Saharan
average
of
$450),
approximately
95
million
of
Nigeria’s
164,000,000
people
are
living
in
absolute
poverty and illiteracy.
C.
Most of the lecturers in the Distance Education
Program of ESBS/IMT, especially part-timers,
can hardly be described as intellectually inclined
either by training or in practice.
D.
Misconception of what Polytechnic Distance
Education Program is, has led to high cost of
ICT, lack of professionals, lack of institutional
readiness, dearth of logistics and poverty.
E.
Economic constraints include: Limitation of
capitalist
system,
corruption,
inflation,
inequality, insatiable appetite for the acquisition
of material wealth (individualistic concern about
cars, houses, clothes, and funds among other
trappings of life).
F.
Insecurity Problems
Job insecurity due to economic crises has led to
mass unemployment. Also, this creates a feeling
of helplessness among the nations.
G.
Bad leadership
There
is
political
instability,
difficulties
in
communication
and
imperfections
in
organizational structure. Lack of serious political
future for the participating stakeholders and their
non-continued co-operation in the scheme are
problems, too.
H.
Lack of political will
Ignorance and misplacement of priorities are
evident causes, too.
Talents and experts are
sacrificed for mediocrity. Worse still is the quota
system of sharing political appointments in
government programs.
I.
Dearth of Experts
Dependency on Consultants outside Nigeria as a
result of dearth of experts needed for the
operation of ICT driven equipment for DE
Programs.
J.
Constraint of Power Failure
In Nigeria, power failure makes it difficult for
learners to read after day-light and the high cost
of purchasing mechanized and electronic devices
is on the increase.
K.
Worse still is the commercialization of the few
available educational media in Nigeria. Also,
non-maintenance of the collaborative agreement
terms between the Enugu State Broadcasting
Service and Institute of Management Technology
54

eLmL 2014 : The Sixth International Conference on Mobile, Hybrid, and On-line Learning

on the effective running of Distance Education
Program is a challenge.
L.
Insufficient
funds
and
lack
of
culture
of
preventive
maintenance
in
ESBS/IMT
Polytechnic
Distance
Education
Program
[15][16].
M. Lack of infrastructure
Most of the classrooms are dilapidated; lack
seats,
no
light
and
above
all,
insufficient
classrooms.
These challenges have posed terrible problems for ICT-
driven
Polytechnic
Distance
Education
Programs,
especially the ESBS/IMT Polytechnic Distance Education
Program in Nigeria.
VI.
RECOMMENDATIONS
For Information Communication Technology to thrive,
no matter the potentialities in Polytechnic Distance
Education
Programs,
there
must
be
a
realistic
implementation strategy that has to work towards the
factors below:

Leadership by Example and Commitment
Caring for peoples’ needs, provision of suitable
materials, provision of the right personnel and
right environment and prudent management of
available ICT.

Practice of sharp-Networking: The relevance of
networking includes that new ideas, vision and
perspectives
are
elaborated
and
sharpened.
Establishing
a
professional
Association
of
Academic and non-Technical Distance Educators
would enhance the most efficient and flexible
mode of sharing information, experiences and
ideas among likeminded persons, groups and
organizations spread geographically and working
on diverse issues.

Readiness to rid the country of illiteracy: The
political will should provide for promotion of
research in motivation, evaluation and advocacy
in
ESBS/IMT
Polyair
Distance
Education
Program (DEP). The Management Committee
requires
some
animators,
conveners,
or
coordinators to act as models of energizing or
sustaining
information,
ideas
and
resources
among
members
and
facilitators
to
ensure
efficient ICT-driven DEP.

There should be genuine incentives from the
Management
Board,
School
Board,
Departmental Board and political leaders. This
will
help
cure
indifferences,
apathy
and
ethnicism. It will discourage early withdrawals,
and encourage visit to those who opt out and
insist on proper record keeping. Inculcation of
values of personal concern, personal-centered
teaching,
personal
interest
in
each
learner,
tenderness, sympathy, etc., to strengthen social
cohesion.

Regular Publication of DE Journals and other
Academic Periodicals. Exchange of ICT experts
of member countries. Also, organizing regular
conferences
(nationally
and
internationally),
seminars, workshops and short courses on ICT-
driven DE helps in strengthening the openness
and
willingness
to
learn,
as
well
as
the
responsibility of individuals.

Research: For a program of ESBS/IMT Polyair to
achieve the set goal in Education for all in Nigeria,
the training must rest on sound foundation and to
meet the needs of society and individual(s). It is
essential that it should constantly benefit from the
contributions of the ICT. This helps in strengthening
the learners to choose, decide and behave rationally
in the study.

Management should build more classrooms for face
to face contact. Also, ICT devices should be provided
such as computers, CDs, DVDs, internet services, e-
library among others. This is to encourage students to
become ICT-compliant.

To encourage lecturers to become ICT-compliant,
laptops and constant training should be provided to
them.
VII. CONCLUSION
In Nigeria, with regards to the Polytechnic Distance
Education with particular reference to ESBS/IMT, it is
clear that the use of ICT Devices in teaching and learning
is
still
not
encouraging.
The
management
of
the
Polytechnic Distance Education program should provide
ICT devices and training to both students and lecturers to
improve the standard of learning and effective use of
these devices. Also, classrooms should be built to enhance
a conducive environment for learning. The fact remains
that the learner must be assisted at every stage of his
educational program progression by continually supplying
the materials and the stimulus that the learners need.
