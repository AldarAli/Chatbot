INTRODUCTION
The
most
important
obstruction
in
wireless
telecommunication systems is fading. When a received
signal experiences fading during transmission, its envelope
and phase both fluctuate over time. The fading appears
because of signals extending by more paths and shadow
effects. Last few years, with development of wireless and
mobile communication systems, this problem is considered
in the literature 2, 3.
Many of the wireless communication systems use some
form of diversity combining in order to reduce multupath
fading appeared in the channel. Upgrading transmission
reliability and increasing channel capacity without increasing
transmission power and bandwidth is the main goal of
diversity techniques.
The most useful are space diversity with two or more
branches. The receiver combines signals from different
antenna and makes the decision from combined signal on the
optimal manner. The most popular of them are maximal ratio
combining (MRC), equal gain combining (EGC), selection
combining (SC) and switch and stay combining (SSC).
Maximal-Ratio Combining (MRC) is one of the most
widely used diversity combining schemes whose SNR is the
sum of the SNR’s of each individual diversity branches.
MRC is the optimal combining scheme, but its price and
complexity are higher. Also, MRC requires cognition of all
channel parameters and admit in the same phase all input
signals, because it is the most complicated for realization
([4]-[6]).
Signal at the EGC diversity system output is equal to the
sum of its’ input signals. The input signals should be
admitted in the same phase, but it is not necessary to know
the
channel
parameters.
Therefore,
EGC
provides
comparable performances to MRC technique, but has lower
implementation complexity, so it is an intermediate solution
[7].
Among
the
simpler
diversity
combining
schemes,
selection combining (SC) and switch and stay combining
(SSC) are the two most popular. With SC receiver, the
processing is performed at only one of the diversity
branches, which is selectively chosen, and no channel
information is required. That is why SC is much simpler for
practical
realization.
In
general,
selection
combining,
assuming that noise power is equally distributed over
branches, selects the branch with the highest signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) that is the branch with the strongest signal ([7]-
[9]).
SSC is an attempt to simplify the complexity of the
system with loss in performance. In this case, rather than
continually connecting the antenna with the best fading
conditions, the receiver selects a particular antenna until its
quality drops below a predetermined threshold. When this
happens, the receiver switches to another antenna and stays
with it for the next time slot, regardless of whether or not
the channel quality of that antenna is above or below the
predetermined threshold.
The consideration of SSC systems in the literature has
been restricted to low-complexity mobile units where the
number of diversity antennas is typically limited to two
([10]-[12]). Furthermore, in all these publications, only
111
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/

predetection SSC has thus far been considered wherein the
switching of the receiver between the two receiving
antennas is based on a comparison of the instantaneous
signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the connected antenna with a
predetermined threshold. This results in a reduction of
complexity relative to SC in that the simultaneous and
continuous monitoring of both branches SNRs is no longer
necessary. In [13] the moment generating function (MGF)
of the signal power at the output of dual-branch switch and
stay selection diversity (SSC) combiners is derived.
The fading influence to the system performances is
considered
in
[2].
The
most
often
Rayleigh,
Rice,
Nakagami, Weibull and log-normal fading are considered.
The Rice fading is present very often in wireless
telecommunication systems with direct line of site. When
the fading appeared in the channel because of signal
propagation by more paths, and dominate component exists
because of optical visibility from transmitter to receiver,
signal amplitude is modeled by Rice distribution. Therefore,
Rice distribution is often used to model propagation paths
consisting of one strong direct LOS component and many
random weaker components.
Abu-Dayya and Beaulieu in [14] consider switched
diversity on microcellular Ricean channels.
The performances of the SSC combiner output signal in
the presence of Nakagami-m fading are assigned in [15] and
in the presence of log-normal fading in [16]. The level
crossing rate of the SSC combiner output signal in the
presence of Rayleigh fading is observed in [17].
The probability density function of dual branch SSC
combiner output signal and the joint probability density
function of this combiner output signal at two time instants
in the presence of Rice fading are settled in [18].
The level crossing rate of the SSC combiner output
signal in the presence of Rice fading is calculated and
presented in [19] and the outage probability and the average
time of fade duration of the SSC combiner output signal in
the presence of Rice fading at the input are determined in
[1].
Because the switch and stay combining (SSC) is very
popular combining model due to its simplicity, their
performances in the presence of Rice fading are summed up
in this paper. Whereas the level crossing rate, the outage
probability and the average fade duration for dual SSC
combiner are determined earlier, the bit error rate of the
SSC combiner output signal in the presence of Rice fading
for coherent BPSK modulation sheme will be determined in
this paper. The results will be shown graphically for
different signal and fading parameters values and the
decision threshold values.
The
structure
of
the
paper
is
as
follows:
after
Introduction in Section II the model of the SSC combiner is
given. Then, in Section III, the system performances are
derived. In Section IV the numerical results for all
performances are given in the case that BPSK modulation
scheme is considered. The last Section is Conclusion.
II.
SYSTEM MODEL
With SSC combiner with great number of branches we
can minimize the bit error rate (BER). We will analyze in
this paper the SSC combiner with two inputs because the
gain is the greatest when instead of one-channel system at
least the dual SSC combiner is used. With the enlarging of
the number of inputs (branches) the gain becomes less.
Because of that it is more economic using dual SSC
combiner.
The model of the SSC combiner with two inputs,
considered in this paper, is shown in Figure 1.
The signals at the combiner input are r1 and r2, and r is
the combiner output signal. The predetection combining is
observed.
The probability of the event that the combiner first
examines the signal at the first input is P1, and for the second
input to be examined first it is P2.

Figure. 1. Model of the SSC combiner with two inputs
If the combiner examines first the signal at the first input
and if the value of the signal at the first input is above the
decision treshold, rT, SSC combiner forwards this signal to
the circuit for the decision. If the value of the signal at the
first input is below the decision treshold rT, SSC combiner
forwards the signal from the other input to the circuit for the
decision. If the SSC combiner first examines the signal from
the second combiner input it works in the similar way.
The decision threshold value can be selected so that one
of three parameters has to be minimal: the error probability,
fade
duration
or
average
signal
value
(or
signal
to
noise/interference
ratio
(SNR/SIR)
when
noise
or
interference is significant) [2].
The average SNR at the SSC output can be obtained by
averaging  over pγSSC(γ ) as given by [2, Eq. 9.274], yielding

Differentiating previous equation with respect to γT and
setting the result to zero, it can be easily shown that

maximized when the switching threshold is set to

.
It can
be shown that the MGF associated
with
appropriate fading model is given by [2, Eq. 2.17], and the
moments are given by [2, Eq. (2.18)]

The outage probability Pout is standard performance
criterion of communication systems operating over fading
channels. This performance measure is commonly used to
control the noise or co-channel interference level, helping
the designers of wireless communication systems to meet
the quality-of-service (QoS) and grade of service (GoS)
demands.
The outage probability Pout is defined as the probability that
the combiner output SNR falls below a given threshold γth and is
therefore obtained by replacing γ with γth in the CDF expressions
given previously.

and
for
the
outage

Figure 7. The level crossing rate N(rth) for
rT =1,  =2, A =0.5 and  =0.1; 0.2; 0.5; 1
The level crossing rate curves N(rth) versus decision
threshold value are given in Figures 4. to 7. for diferent
values of variances  and ,
threshold value rT
and
amplitude A.
We can notice from the Figures 4. to 7, that all
represented curves have the same shape, but there is
discontinuities on the level crossing rate curves versus
threshold. Numerical values of the threshold determine the
discontinuity moment appearance.
The outage probability curves, POUT(rth), versus the
threshold, are shown for some parameter values in Figures
8. and 9. The outage probability curves, versus the
threshold, given in Figure 8, are with the parameter of
curves rT. The parameter of the curves from Figure 9. is the
variance .

rT =0.5;1;2;3,  =1, A =0.5
117
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/

From Figure 8. can be seen that the outage probability
increases with rising of the threshold. The represented
curves have similar shape, but there is discontinuities on
them versus the threshold value. Numerical values of the
threshold determine the discontinuity moment appearance.
Figure 9. The outage probability POUT(rth) for
rT =1,  =0.5; 1; 2; 4, A =0.5
From Figure 9. can be seen that the outage probability
increases with rising of the threshold. The represented
curves have similar shape, but there is also discontinuities
on them versus the threshold value. The curves are steeper
when variance  is less.
Figure 10. The fade duration T(rth) for
rT =0.5; 1; 2; 3,  =1, A =0.5 and  =0.2
The fade duration curves, T(rth), are shown in Figures
10. to 13. versus the decision threshold, for different
parameter values.
Figure 11. The fade duration T(rth) for
rT =1,  =0.5; 1; 2; 4, A =0.5 and  =0.2
Figure 12. The fade duration T(rth) for
rT =1,  =2, A =0.2; 0.5; 1; 2 and  =0.2

118
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 2 no 4, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/

We can compare these figures now. It can be observed
that all curves, T(rth) versus decision threshold, have similar
shape, but threshold numerical value influence to the
discontinuity moment appearance. Larger rise of fade
duration corresponds to larger threshold values and to less
variances  and  , and signal amplitude A.
The bit error rate curves, Pb(e), for different parameters,
are illustrated in Figures 14. to 17.
Figure 14. The bit error rate Pb(e) versus the threshold
for  =0.5; 1; 2; 4, A =1
Figure 15. The bit error rate Pb(e) versus the threshold
for  =1, A =0.2; 0.5; 1; 2
The bit error rate curves versus the threshold are given
in Figures 14. and 15. It is evident from these Figures that
bit error rate is less for bigger signal amplitude and variance
 , what is in good coincidence with theoretical recognition.
Figure 16. The bit error rate Pb(e) versus variance  for
rT =0.5; 1; 2; 3, A =0.5
The bit error rate curves versus variance , for diferent
values of the threshold, are given in Figure 16. The bit error
rate becomes bigger for less values of the threshold when
the variances  is growing up.
Figure 17. The bit error rate Pb(e) versus signal amplitude A
for rT =1,  =0.5; 1; 2; 4
The bit error rate curves versus signal amplitude A, for
diferent values of the variance , are given in Figure 17.
The bit error rate is bigger for less values of the signal
amplitude A when the variances 
is less. The curves
become wider when variance  is growing up, and the bit
error rate is reduced.

V.
CONCLUSION
It is known that the level crossing rate, the outage
probability, the average time of fade duration and the bit
error rate of combiner output signal are important system
performances. In this paper these performances for the dual
branch SSC combiner output signal in the presence of Rice
fading are integrated and results are shown graphically for
different decision threshold values, variances and signal
amplitudes. Also, the analysis of the parameters influence on
the system performances is done.
In the future work the number of branches could be
enlarge
and
an
analysis
could
be
done.
Also,
the
performances of the SSC combiner output signal in the
presence of Weibull and Hoyt fading could be determined.
