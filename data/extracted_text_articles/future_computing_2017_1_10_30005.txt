Abstract- In this paper, a techno-economic assessment of a real 
life hydrocarbon facility electrical system real power loss 
optimization is addressed. This optimization was attained by 
using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Differential Evolution 
Algorithm (DEA).  The study is the first of its kind as none of the 
previous studies were conducted in the context of a real life 
hydrocarbon facility’s electrical system. The hydrocarbon 
facility’s electrical system examined in the study consisted of 275 
buses, two gas turbine generators, two steam turbine generators, 
and large synchronous motors, with both rotational and static 
loads. For the real life hydrocarbon facility, the performance of 
the GA and the DEA were benchmarked in the course of 
optimizing the subject objective. The problem was articulated as 
a constrained nonlinear problem. The constraints were all real 
values reflecting the system equipment and components’ 
limitations. The consequences obtained from the study showed 
the efficiency and prospects of the proposed algorithms in 
solving the described optimization case.  Also presented in this 
study is the annual fuel cost avoidance.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Most of the oil exporting developing countries are facing 
a challenge associated with the increasing demand for 
domestic electrical energy. This increase has reached such an 
alarming level that it mandates action from the governments 
of the subject countries. For example, in the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, the average annual increase in electricity 
demand is 7.4% [1]. 
In fact, in these countries, a high percentage of electric 
generation comes from low efficiency power generation 
plants, such as the simple cycle steam turbine. This 
complicates the issue, creating an urgent requirement for the 
utilization of more efficient plants coupled with a reduction in 
loss in the transmission and distribution system. In Saudi 
Arabia, the distribution of plant capacity for electricity 
generation by technology illustrates that low efficiency simple 
cycle steam turbine generators make up 32% of the utility 
company’s generation fleet, while the most efficient 
combined cycle generators are around 13.8% of the whole 
fleet [2]. 
The aforementioned challenges gave impetus to the idea 
of studying the potential to use intelligent algorithms in 
optimizing real hydrocarbon facility power loss. The study 
used the real values of the system parameters and practical 
constraints, which escalated the challenges in finding a global 
solution. 
This paper considers an existing real life hydrocarbon 
central processing facility electrical power system model for 
assessing the potential of system real power loss minimization 
using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Differential 
Evolution Algorithm (DEA) for two generation modes. In 
Section 2, the problem will be formulated as optimization 
problem with equality and inequality constrains. In Section 3, 
the GA and DEA will be employed to solve this problem. In 
Section 4, the paper study scenarios will be developed. 
Finally, in Section 5 techno-economic analysis of the results 
and discussion will be presented. 
 
II. 
PROBLEM FORMULATION 
The problem formulation consists of two parts: the 
development of the objective functions and the identification 
of the system electrical constrains to be met; equality and 
inequality constrains.  
 
A. Problem Objective Function 
The objective to be achieved is the minimization of the real 
power loss J1 (PLoss) in the transmission and distribution lines. 
This objective function can be expressed in terms of the power 
follow loss between two buses i and j as follows: 
 
           J1 = PLoss = ∑
 𝒈𝒌 [ 𝑽𝒊
𝟐 + 𝑽𝒋
𝟐 − 𝟐  𝑽𝒊𝑽𝒋 𝐜𝐨𝐬(𝜹𝒊 − 𝜹𝒊)] 
𝒏𝒍
𝒌=𝟏
            (1) 
 
Where nl is the number of transmission and distribution 
lines; gk is the conductance of the kth line, Vi i  and Vj j   
are the voltage at end buses i and j of the kth line, respectively  
[3] [4]. 
 
B. Problem Equality and Inequality Constrains  
The system constrains are divided into two categories: 
equality constrains and inequality constrains [3][5]. Details 
are as follows:

B.1 Equality Constrains 
These constrains represent the power load flow equations. 
The balance between the active power injected PGi, the active 
power demand PDi and the active power loss Pli at any bus i is 
equal to zero. The same balance applies for the reactive power 
QGi, QDi , and  Qli. These balances are presented as follows: 
 
                                 PGi− PDi −  Pli = 0                                                 (2) 
 
                                 QGi− QDi −  Qli = 0                                               (3) 
 
The above equations can be detailed as follows: 
  
PGi− PDi−𝑉𝑖 ∑
 𝑽𝒋 [ 𝐺𝑖𝑗𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝛿𝑖 − 𝛿𝑗) + 𝐵𝑖𝑗 sin (
𝑵𝑩
𝒋=𝟏
𝛿𝑖 − 𝛿𝑗)] = 0         (4) 
 
QGi − QDi−𝑉𝑖 ∑
 𝑽𝒋 [ 𝐺𝑖𝑗𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝛿𝑖 − 𝛿𝑗) − 𝐵𝑖𝑗 cos (
𝑵𝑩
𝒋=𝟏
𝛿𝑖 − 𝛿𝑗)] = 0     (5) 
 
where i = 1,2,…,NB;NB is the number of buses; PG and QG 
are the generator real and reactive power, respectively; PD and 
QD are the load real and reactive power, respectively; Gij and 
Bij are the conductance and susceptance between bus i and bus j, 
respectively.   
 
B.2 Inequality Constrains 
These constrains represent the system operating constrains 
posted in Table 1 and they are as follows:  
a. Generator and synchronous motor voltages; VG and VSynch; 
their reactive power outputs; QG and QSynch.  
b. The transformers taps. 
c. The load buses voltages VL.  
Combining the objective function and these constrains, the 
problem can be mathematically formulated as a nonlinear 
constrained single objective optimization problem as follows: 
 
Minimize J1   
Subject to: 
                                         g(x,u) = 0                                   (6) 
                                         |h(x,u)| ≤ 0                                  (7) 
Where: 
 
x:  is the vector of dependent variables consisting of load  bus 
voltage VL, generator reactive power outputs QG and the 
synchronous motors reactive Power QSynch. As a result, x 
can be expressed as 
          xT= [VL1..VLNL, QGi…QGNG, QSynchi…QSynchNSynch]       (6) 
u:  is the vector of control variables consisting of generator 
voltages VG, transformer tap settings T, and synchronous 
motors voltage VSynch. As a result, u can be expressed as 
             uT = [VG1..VGNL, T1…TNT, VSynch1..VSynchNL]              (8) 
 
g: are the equality constrains. 
h: are the inequality constrains. 
 
All the constraints posted in Table 1 are real values based on 
the system and equipment real data.

THE PROPOSED APPROACH 
A. Generic Algorithm (GA) Implementation    
The implementation of the GA technique can be 
summarized in the following steps [6]-[12]: 
1) Generate initial populations of chromosomes; each 
chromosome consists of genes and each of these genes 
represents either transformer tap settings, synchronous 
motors voltages or the generators voltages values. 
2) Assign fitness to each chromosomes, as follows: 
a. Use the Newton-Raphson method to calculate the real 
power losses for each population [8]. 
b. Identify if the voltage constrains are satisfied.  
c. Identify if the synchronous machines (generators and 
motors) capacity limitations are met.  
d. Assign fitness values to the populations that meet all the 
constrains; the population best power loss value (J1). 
3) Identify the best population with its associated 
chromosomes that has the best objective function value 
and store it.  
4) Identify the chromosomes parents that will go to the 
mating pool for producing the next generation via the 
random selection method. This method works by 
generating two random integer numbers (each represents a 
chromosome). Then, these two randomly selected 
chromosomes fitness values are compared and the one 
with the better fitness value will go into the mating pool. 
This randomly selected chromosomes mechanism will be 
repeated until the population in the mating pool equals to 
the initial chromosomes population [13].   
5) Perform genes crossover for the mating pool parents via 
the simple crossover method [13]. In this method, the 
offspring chromosomes are generated by establishing a 
vertical crossover position for parent’s chromosomes and 
then crossover their genes.

6) Perform gene mutation for the mating pool parents after 
they have been crossed over; the random mutation method 
was implemented [13]. In this method, the offspring 
chromosomes genes are mutated to new ones randomly 
from the genes domain. 
7) Go to Step #2 and repeat the above steps with the new 
populations generated from the original chromosome 
parents after being crossed over and mutated.  
8) Each time, identify the best population and compare its 
fitness value with the stored one; if it is better (meeting the 
objective function), replace the best chromosomes with 
the new ones. 
9) The loop of generation is repeated until the best population 
with its associated chromosomes, in terms of minimum 
real power loss, is identified or the maximum number of 
generations is met. The flow chart of the proposed 
approach is shown in Fig. 1.

B. Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA) Implementation    
DEA utilizes special differential operators in creating the 
offspring individuals from the parent individuals’ population 
in place of the classical crossover and mutation operators used 
in the GA. In DEA, there are two control parameters, which 
are the mutation constant F and the crossover constant C. 
Different from the GA, in the DEA the mutations are 
performed before the crossover and the selection is taken 
place after both the mutation and the crossover.  DEA’s first 
three evolutionary process steps are similar to the GA ones. 
[14]-[18]. The remaining steps are as described below: 
4) In the DEA, mutations are performed using the DE/rand/1 
mutation technique [17]. Vi (t) - the mutated vector, is 
created for each population member Xi (t) set by randomly 
selecting three individuals’ xr1, xr2 and xr3 and not 
corresponding to the current individual xi. Then, a scalar 
number F is used to scale the difference between any two 
of the selected individuals. The resultant difference is 
added to the third selected individual. The mutation 
process can be written as: 
 
                         Vi,j(t) = xr1,j (t) + F * [ xr2,j(t) - xr3,j (t) ]              (9)                  
 
The value of F is usually selected between 0.4 and 1.0. In 
this study, F was set to be 0.5 (50%). In [14], scaling 
mutation based on the frequency of successful mutations 
is applied. 
5) Perform the binomial crossover, which can be expressed as 
follows: 
           𝑢𝑖,𝑗(𝑡) = {𝑣𝑖,𝑗(𝑡) 𝑖𝑓 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑 (0,1) < 𝐶𝑅
𝑥𝑖,𝑗 (𝑡)                             𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒        (10)                  
       
CR is the crossover control parameter, and it is usually set 
within the range [0, 1]. The child ui,j (t) will compete with 
its parent xi,j (t). CR is set equal to 0.9 (90%) in this study.  
6) Perform the selection procedure as described below: 
 
                 xi(t+1) = ui(t)      condition    f(ui(t)) ≤   f(xi(t))        (11)    
 
                     xi(t+1) = xi(t)      condition    f(xi(t)) ≤   f(ui(t))           (12)                        
 
       Where f( ) is the objective function to be minimized.     
7) Looping back for the terminating criteria. If the criteria are 
not fulfilled, then generate new offspring population and 
begin again.  
8) If the termination criteria are met, identify the best 
population with its associated chromosomes, in terms of 
minimum real power loss. The DEA evolution process is 
shown in Fig. 2.

IV. 
STUDY SCENARIOS 
In this paper, three scenarios were studied: the base case 
scenario- business as usual (BAU), the optimal case scenario 
when all generators are online, and the optimal case scenario 
when two generators are offline. In the optimal cases, the best 
system parameters (chromosomes) that meet the minimum 
objective function (J1) are obtained. 
A. Base Case Scenario 
The BAU scenario was simulated to be benchmarked with 
the two optimal scenarios. Following are some of the normal 
system operation mode parameters: 
1) The utility bus and generators terminal buses were set at 
unity p.u. voltage. 
2) All the synchronous motors were set to operate very close 
to the unity power factor.   
3) All downstream distribution transformers and the captive 
synchronous motors transformers; off-load tap changers; 
were put on the neutral tap. 
4) The causeway substations main transformers taps were 
raised to meet the very conservative voltage constrains at 
these substations downstream buses; ≥ 0.95 p.u. Refer to 
Table 2 below.

B. Optimal Case Scenario with All Generators Online 
In this scenario, all the generators were assumed to be 
online. The initial 100 populations of feasible chromosomes 
(individuals), which meet both the buses voltage and 
synchronous machine reactive power constrains were 
identified. The feasible populations with their associated 
chromosomes were subject to the GA and DEA evolutionary 
process of 100 generations guided by the objective function 
J1. The GA process was set with 90% crossover probability 
and 10% mutation probability. In the DEA case, the mutation 
F constant was set equal to 0.5 (50%) and the CR is set equal 
to 0.9 (90%). The system parameters and the objective 
function value associated with the optimal solution of this 
scenario were identified. 
 
C. Optimal Case Scenario with Two Generators Offline  
In this scenario, two generators (one gas turbine generator 
and one steam turbine generator) were assumed to be offline. 
All others parameters are identical to the optimal case 
scenario with all generators are online. 
  
V. 
 RESULTS ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The results from the three scenarios, base case, when all 
generators online and with two generators offline will be 
analysed in two categories: the system parameters analysis 
and the economic analysis.  
A. System Parameters Analysis  
The hydrocarbon facility simplified electrical system 
model, which is studied in this paper, is shown in Fig. 3. The 
evolution of the objective function (J1) values over the GA 
and DEA evolution process is captured in Fig. 4. In the all 
generators online scenario the GA converted to its optimal J1 
value of 1.892 MW after 53 generations while the DEA 
converted to better J1 value of 1.885 MW but after 78 
generations. So, DEA converted to a better J1 value but after 
a higher number of generations. In the scenario with two 
generators offline, DEA converted to again better J1 value of 
2.926 MW at generation 72 while the GA converted to its 
optimal J1 value of 2.933 MW after 91 generation. In this 
scenario, DEA produced a better J1 value and within a lower 
number of generations compared to the GA. The evolution 
process for both the GA and the DEA were repeated many 
times to confirm the obtained results.  
 
 
Figure 3.  Simplified electrical system of the hydrocarbon processing facilty 
 
In Table 3, a comparison of the objective functions’ values 
are posted for the three studied scenarios. The DEA performs 
better than the GA for the all generators’ online scenario. J1 
was reduced by 11.67% when compared with the BAU values. 
Also, DEA produced better objectives’ values than GA for the 
two generators’ offline mode.

B. Economic Analysis  
The annual cost due to the system real power loss 
calculated based on natural gas cost of $3.5 per MM is 
demonstrated in Table 4. In the all generators online scenario, 
DEA produce better real power loss cost $561,782 which is 
$74,200 less than the BAU power loss cost and $2,076 less   
when benchmarked with GA. Also, DEA produce better real 
power loss of $872,124 which is $87,361 less than the BAU 
power loss cost and $2,161 less when compared with GA real 
power loss cost value.

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presented the potential of minimizing the real 
system’s power loss for a real-life hydrocarbon facility using 
the GA and DEA approach. Three scenarios were considered, 
the base case scenario and two generation scenarios. The 
technical and economic advantages of the optimal scenarios 
versus the base case scenario were highlighted in this paper. 
Also, the superiority of applying DEA to search for the 
optimal value of the objective function over the GA was 
highlighted. Future study may need to address the problem as 
a multi-objective problem considering the grid connection 
power factor as a second objective which competes with the 
real power loss minimization objective.
