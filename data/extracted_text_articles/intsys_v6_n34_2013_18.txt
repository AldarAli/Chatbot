Abstract— The ability to use the Internet can provide
an important contribution to an older adult’s quality of
life. Communication via email with family, friends and
service
providers
have
become
critical
factors
for
improving ones ability to cope with modern society as
individual’s age.
The problem is that as users age,
natural physical and cognitive impairments make it more
difficult
for them to use the required technology.
Setting user preferences in browsers has been suggested
as a means of dealing with these limitations.
However,
questions exist as to the effectiveness of older adult’s
ability to use self-assessment as a means of setting
preferences. The present study investigates the use of
error detection as a means of improving web access
amongst older adults.
Specifically, an error detection
strategy has been developed and compared to self
assessment, written tests, and observation as a means of
identifying the impairments of older Internet users.

I.
INTRODUCTION
The normal aging process can trigger decreases in
acuity of vision and cognition as well as physical
impairments, which impact Web usability, particularly
if Web designs are not user-friendly [8,9].
Web
design
issues
related
to
fonts,
colors,
graphics,
background
images,
navigation,
and
search
mechanisms might prevent older adult users from
taking full advantage of online health resources. Web
designs may also present reading comprehension
barriers for the older adult, due to limitations in visual
acuity, cognitive abilities, and education levels, all of
which may have a consequence on Web usage [6].
Savago, Sloan, and Blat [24] see cognition problems
as the largest barrier to computer use by older adults.
Cognitive issues place older adults at greater risk for
falling for Internet scams [7].
The implication of better health care for older
adults is a longer life [12]. It is crucial for them to be
able to keep abreast of new developments in health
care that can enhance their life [2]. Older adults who
have access to the Internet have access to a large
number of ways to find information to help them
achieve this goal. It also provides an excellent means
of interacting with family members, which also has
implications for positive health outcomes.
Xie [33]
has noted that the use of the Internet has changed the
relationship between older adults and their health
providers.
Many
older
adults
have
problems
performing daily tasks because of restricted mobility,
lack of transportation, inconvenience, and fear of
crime
[4].
Home
computers
with
an
Internet
connection can provide access to information and
services, and can also be used to manage banking and
Internet shopping tasks.
This can be of critical
importance. Sum et al. [27] have found that Internet
usage is an important factor in older adult’s ability to
deal with loneliness. Kwon and Noh [14] have also
noted that using the Internet can help reduce boredom.
Hogeboom et al. [10] have shown that Internet usage
is important in strengthening older adults’ social
networking.
Madden [16] notes “Social networking
among Internet users ages 50 and older almost
doubled -- from 22% to 42% during the 2009-2010
period”. Uphold [30] found that older adults are the
most likely to seek information on the Web.
Sloan et al. [26] and Mazur et al. [17] have noted
that the full impact of how older adults use Internet
tools is still an open question.
Salces et al. [22]
provide a detailed discussion of the effect of aging.
Interestingly, studies [13,15,16,31] have found that the
average age of computer users has continued to
increase. Berry [3] suggests that the variation in the
older users should be taken into account as methods
for older adults are considered.
Xie and Bugg [32] have found that good training
for older adults in public libraries can improve
effective computer usage. However, training does not
help with the user’s limitations. One means of dealing
with these issues is for website designers and Human
Computer Interaction (HCI) professionals to provide
services for better interfaces and Websites in order for
older adults to effectively use computers and obtain
information resources on-line [12].
While such an
approach is viable, it restricts use of the Internet to
sites that have been designed with such limitations in
mind.
To provide a more general solution to the
problem, it requires taking the limitations of the users
into consideration. Hanson and Crayne [8] make use
of user preferences. However, older adults are not as
successful as younger users in making use of the
preference options provided by the browser [8, 9]. To
bridge this gap, we propose the use of an error

detection strategy to determine the level of impairment
of user.
The proposed error detection strategy is
compared against self assessment, written test, and one
on one observation
The information on the user’s level of expected
performance is stored in a user profile and then is used
by the server to modify the Web page the user is
working with. The use of user profiles is not new, but
it has proved to be a useful construct in our tests.
Jacko et al. [11] used visual profiles in their work. We
ultimately see a user profile as containing information
such as font size, cognitive level (reasoning, speed of
processing and locus of control), and mobility/motor
measures. The present work looks at the development
of profile types based on self assessment, written tests,
and observation and our error detection strategy and
focuses on vision and motor skill issues.
The key question addressed in this research is
“Does error detection produce a profile of the older
adults’ accessibility performance that is comparable to
profiles based on self assessment, written tests, or
observation?” To test these questions, we constructed
a server based software platform that makes use of a
user profile to modify Web pages. The platform was
used in a user study of 25 older adults to examine our
research question.
The next section briefly looks at some related
work. Section III looks at the software platform used
in the study and Section IV describes the experiment
design. Section V presents the results of our study and
Section VI provides a discussion of the results.
Section VII provides concluding remarks and thoughts
about future work.
II. RELATED WORK
Several approaches have been proposed to assist older
adults.
A number of special purpose devices have
been developed to aid users with motor and vision
issues [18].
Mice and specialized keyboards are
available to aid older adults [4,5] with declining motor
skills. Special viewers to magnify the symbols on the
screen are available as well. While such devices are
very useful, they tend to increase the cost of computer
systems and restrict where older adults can access the
Internet. Moreover, older adults are less likely to be
aware of special hardware [8].
Hanson et al. [9] have
looked at voice browsing as a compromise. Pervasive
computing [21] has somewhat similar goals, but does
not focus on the user’s limitations.
Sato et al. [23]
have built on voice augmentation techniques to help
older adults.
The IBM research group at Watson proposed a
Web solution approach to Web accessibility for older
adults [9]. They employed a server to reformat Web
pages based upon user preference and capability. This
Gateway
software
was
built
on
WebSphere
Transcoding
Publisher.
IBM
WebSphere®
Transcoding Publisher Version 4.0 for Multi-platforms
is server-based software that dynamically translates
Web content and applications into multiple markup
languages and optimizes it for delivery to mobile
devices,
such
as
mobile
phones
and
handheld
computers. The software adapts, reformats, and filters
content, tailoring it for display on pervasive devices,
giving companies better access to mobile employees,
business partners and customers.
Another group of IBM’s researchers, Nagao et
al. [20] continued research in the area of content
adaptation through transcoding for accessibility for
users with specific needs.
Content adaptation is a
type
of
transcoding
that
considers
a
user’s
environment devices, network bandwidth, profiles,
and so on [20].
In their implementation,
an
annotation server annotated and changed the document
contents in accordance with profiles.
More recently, Hanson and Crayne [8] have
started to stress the use of user defined preferences at
the browser level.
However, older adults are not as
successful as younger users in making use of the
preference options provided by the browser [8].
Mobasher et al. [19] explored mining usage data for
Web personalization. The rules are used to adapt the
content served to a particular user.
Collaborative
filtering systems, such as Firefly [25], typically take
explicit information in the form of user ratings or
preferences, and through a correlation engine, return
information that is predicted to closely match the
users’ preferences.
The next section looks at the software platform
used in the experiment.
III. SOFTWARE PLATFORM
We start by briefly overviewing the design of the
Error Detection System software used to support our
study. The purpose of the Error Detection System is
to measure efficiency in an unobtrusive and dynamic
Internet browsing environment capable of evaluating
user
performance
and
providing
dynamic
modification of Web pages according to individual
user profiles.
A.
Overview of Platform
The Error Detection System’s platform provides the
mechanism to collect relevant information (errors) to
gain insight into some of the problems that older
adults encounter while browsing the Internet. The

378
International Journal on Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 6 no 3 & 4, year 2013, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/
2013, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
software uses a user profile for each individual to
assist participants surfing the Internet, while tracking
their error rates. The result is that users are able to get
page modification without having to make manual
adjustment with their browser.
The architecture was designed to capture errors
related to vision and motor skills.
In this study, user
performances
were compared
based on profiles
created by self-assessment, written tests, observation,
and our error detection software.
Details on the
design and generation of the four types of profiles are
given in Section IV. Here it is sufficient to note that
the user profile variables (font size, motor skills)
represent the perceived limitations of the owner of
the profile.
User Name
Date
Time
Profile Level
Font Size
Motor Skills Score
Figure 2. Profile parameters.
A block diagram of the basic software platform
used in the experiment is shown in Figure 1. URL’s
for the Web pages requested by the user are sent to
the Web Page Convertor module.
The module
downloads the requested Web page and modifies it
based on the contents of the user’s profile (Figure 2).
The strategy in converting webpages is to increase
the font size to the value given in the user profile, if
necessary. The motor skills and mobility scores are
used to enlarge the area of interactive screen features,
like buttons and text boxes, using JavaScript. We
used the phrase sensitive area to represent this
enlarged area. When the user clicks inside the
sensitive area, the feature is activated (e.g., button is
clicked).
When a web page is requested, the page is
retrieved and loaded onto the server. The web page
is then parsed for font parameters, tags, size and area.
If the values are the same or larger than required by
the profile the fonts or button size are not changed.
Each converted Web page is supplemented with code
(JavaScript) to support error detection and collection.
The errors made by the user are captured on the
webpage and sent to the server level and stored to
support analysis. An example of an error would be a
user clicking near the sensitive area of a button but
not close enough to activate the button.
B.
Profiles
Four approaches to constructing the user profile have
been used in this work [1,28]. Each profile has the
same composition and structure. They only differed
in the way values in the fields were generated. More
details on the four profiles are given in Section IV.
Here we provide a brief overview.

for font size and rating their motor skills. The self-
evaluation was the participants’ perspective of their
own ability and their assessment of what they thought
was the
optimal
settings
for them to
perform
effectively. The self-assessment was used to generate
a user profile for each user. In the remainder of the
manuscript we use the phrase self profile to represent
this profile.
2)
Written Test Profile: Each participant was given
a written test to check their limitations with respect to
vision and motor skills. The exam results were
recorded and used to create a user profile.
This
profile is called the test profile in the rest of the
manuscript.
3)
Observation Profile: Participants were observed
while they were completing a task set.
To ensure
consistency, an observation evaluation form was
developed with the help of a psychologist (Jennifer
Margrett).
Moreover,
all
observations
were
conducted by the same reviewer to reduce any
observer biases. The phrase observation profile is
used to represent the use of this profile in the rest of
the manuscript.
4)
Error Detection Profile: The errors generated
by a user as he/she worked their way through a set of
tasks were captured and used to generate a user
profile.
Figure 3 shows the block diagram of the
modified platform. During the tasks, the errors that
are captured are analyzed and used to modify the
participant’s current profile when the number of
errors is above a preset threshold.
The process
continues until the system sees no additional change
in the performance of the user. The number of clicks
around a button or link is counted to determine the
motor skill score. The font size is set in part based on
the user’s performance based on giving the users
different font sizes to work with. The strategy behind
error detection was to provide a transparent tool to
measure errors and change the current profile to
reduce the user errors.
We use the phrase error
profile in the remainder of the manuscript when
referring to the use of this profile.

Detection.

Determining Errors
A key aspect of the software instrument is the
successful determination of
when an error has
occurred and how to assign the error type. In the

present work, we have used two error types, namely,
motor skills errors and vision errors.
To detect errors, we see the screen real estate as
being broken into two disjoint regions, namely, a

sensitive region and a non-sensitive region.
The
sensitive region of the screen is defined as the portion
of the screen where an action is initiated whenever a
mouse click occurs
within
its boundary.
For
example, if a user clicks on the sensitive area around
a web link, the browser action is to transfer the user
to the web page indicated by the web link. Similarly,
the browser takes actions when a user clicks on a
button, a textbox, radio button or any other action-
based HTML component.
The non-sensitive region of the screen is the
region of the screen where a mouse click does not
cause an action to occur. The non-sensitive portion
of the screen can be made up of empty space or
screen components that do not generate actions (such
as labels, images or text that are not defined by
HTML as web links).
D.
Index
To support the detection of mouse click errors, we
developed a screen real estate index designed to
index the active components on a web page [29].
The structure of the index (shown in Figure 4) makes
use of an x-list (the x-values of the set of points on
the web page that define the location of the action-
based components). For each xi entry we have a list
of u objects, where each u object consists of a y value
and a pointer to the list of action-based components
that are within a threshold t distance from the (x, y)
point indicated by the u entry. Consider the simple
webpage shown in Figure 5.
An idealized version of
the index for the simple webpage from Figure 5 is
shown in Figure 6.
To detect errors the index described in the
previous subsection is used whenever the user clicks

in the non-sensitive region of the screen. Suppose a
mouse click occurs at location (x1, y1) in the non-
sensitive region. The x1 value is used to search the x-
list of the index to locate the two x values that bound
x1 (note that x1 can not be in the x-list or it would not
have occurred in the non-sensitive region). Once we
have found the two x values (say x1 and x2) that
bound x1, we examine the u-lists for x1 and x2 to find
the y values that bound y1 in each list. We can then
use the components that are linked to the u-list entries
to determine if our mouse click at (x1, y1) is
sufficiently close to one of the components to label it
an error.
We define sufficiently close to mean that
(x1, y1) is within a distance t (a system defined
threshold)
from
one
or
more
action-based
components. A simple example using the webpage
from Figure 5 and the index from Figure 6 is given in
Figure 7.
In Figure 7, the mouse click is represented by
the red oval. The location of the mouse click is at
(245, 179). The x-value (245) falls between 240 and
255 in the x-list of the index. The y-value (179) falls
between 164 and 195 in the y-list for 240 and is less
than 195 in the y-list for 255. For the points we have

(240, 195)  1) Email text box

Testing the distance from the mouse clicks to
the two components, we find that the mouse click is

closer to the email text box. We assign the error type
as a text box error.
Since mouse click errors can
either be motor skill or vision errors, we first look to
extend the sensitive area around the components of
the type found to be sufficiently close to the mouse
click (incase of ties, the sensitive area around all tied
component types are inspected). The sensitive areas
are investigated to determine if they can be expanded
without causing the sensitive areas of action-based
components to overlap.
If no overlap is found, the
error is considered to be a motor skill error;
otherwise, we label it as a vision error. The errors are
logged. Figure 8 illustrates what we mean by
expanding the sensitive area around a component
type.
The figure shows the expanded areas around
the textboxes as a red rectangle. Since the expanded
sensitive areas around the textboxes do not overlap,
we assume that the error is a motor skills error and
we log the error.
Note at this point we are only
interested in classifying the error and no actual
expansion of the sensitive area during this action.
Details on how the user profile will be modified are
given in Section IV.
IV. EXPERIMENT DESIGN
To study the effectiveness of the error detection
approach, we compared it to the traditional methods:
Self-assessment, written test and observation.
A.
Participants
Twenty-five participants were recruited for the study.
They were comparable in health, and received
comparable treatment throughout the study.
The
background and characteristics of the participants
who completed the study were similar to those
reported in other studies of usability for older adults.
No
significant
differences
in
demographic
characteristics or baseline performance were observed
between the participants who completed the study
(N=25).
The
participants
were
scheduled
individually for each step of the study.
The study was conducted
at a retirement
community, which provides services for independent
living, assisted-living, and nursing care residents.
The sample size was 25. There were 24 independent
living and one assisted-living participant.
The
sample of 25 participants was randomly selected
from a pool of volunteers.
Table I shows the
demographics
of
the
participants.
All
of
the
participants met the preconditions of being over the
age of 60 years and not having any severe physical
impairment such as blindness or could not use the
mouse and/or keyboard.
They had to be willing to
learn and have the ability to sit at a computer for a 30
to 60 minute session. The participants were not paid.
B.
Basic Experiment Description
Participants were placed approximately 25 inches
from a 20-inch viewable Dell monitor display screen.
Screen resolution was set at 1024 × 768 pixels, with a
32 bit-color setting. The icon and the target folders
sizes were 36.8 mm (diagonal distance) based on the
findings from Jacko et al. [11].
To perform the
experiment, each participant used an IBM Pentium
computer.
The operating system was Microsoft
Windows XP Professional.
The computer used a
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) for Internet access.
The computer was housed on a computer desk with
an accompanying chair in the retirement community.
Each participant was instructed to complete a list of
tasks.
At the initial meeting, each of the participants
was given a letter of consent to read that explained
the study.
They were told that there would be four
tests and their activity would be recorded. At the first
meeting each
user
was asked
to
give a self-
assessment of their limitations and their abilities. At
the second, a pen and paper test of vision, motor
skills and memory was administered and recorded,
then their performance using the profile based on the
pen and paper test was recorded.
At the third
meeting, there was an observational assessment of
the participant’s abilities based on his/her vision, and
motor skills.
Afterwards, the participants completed
a set of tasks and their performance was captured via
the server.
Finally, the participant was evaluated
using the Error Detection approach. We initially set
the participant’s profile settings according to the test
profile settings for the Error Detection study. The

four experiments were conducted within a twenty-
one day period.
Each experiment was scheduled for
one hour. All of the participants completed the four
experiments.
User profiles were created for each participant,
based on the self-assessment, test assessment and
observational test, respectively.
Each participant
executed an Internet usability task based upon the
self, test and observation profiles.
Finally, the
participants utilized the Error Detection system to
perform a similar task. The Internet usability task was
used to capture how many errors the participants
made. Each time they missed an icon/button because
of low vision, mobility or motor skills it would be
captured.
C.
Profile Creation
1)
Self-Profile: Each Participant completed a self-
assessment, (Figure 9) of their limitations and
computer skills.
The responses from the self-
assessment were used to define the parameters in the
self-profile. The assessment asks the participant how
they rated themselves in the context of using the
Internet, their vision, motor skills, and their cognitive
abilities.
The
answers
from
the
self-assessment
questionnaire were the basis for the initial coding of
the
parameters
for
the
self profile.
Figure
10
illustrates the process flow for participant answers
being translated into coded motor skills parameters
for the profile. Figure 11 shows the process flow for
creation of vision fonts.

participant’s responses into the test profile values for
vision and motor skills, respectively.

Observation Profile: The observation data was
gathered while the participants were administered a
set of tasks. The number of instances and actions

while the participants completed the usability task
were recorded using an observation form. The results
were converted into profile parameter values for font
and motor skills. The process flow for converting the
values are shown in Figures 15 and 16.
The main objective of the observation of the
participant was to collect observable behavior of the
participant
surfing
the
web.
The
usability
observation evaluation form was used to collect and
record varied characteristics of the interaction of the
participant, such as accuracy in moving and clicking
the mouse, traversing through a web page, asking
questions, talking out loud, and how efficiently they
were accomplishing the tasks.
The observational
behavioral measures were used to evaluate and score
specific behaviors that the participant displayed:

Screen response: The ability to respond to
prompt and icon presented on Webpage is the second
item on the set measuring responsiveness and effect
of the Webpage.

Type: The item measures skills such as typing,
vision and dexterity.

Visually
Scanning:
This
measure
assesses
participant's skill in application of material read and
analyzes instructional skill. The ability to understand
unfamiliar printed words.

Non-verbal:
This
measure
assesses
the
participant’s facial kinesics to capture any computer
anxiety or
frustration
that
would
be
otherwise
undetectable.

Body Language: This measure, evaluates the
participant's communication using body movements
or gestures in the performance of task assigned.

Questions: This measure assesses participant’s
skill and how well he or she performed the usability
task with or without asking questions.

Talk
aloud:
This
measure,
gauges
the
participant’s
cognitive
processing
and
reasoning
skills in applying analysis skills.

4)
Error Profile:
Participant data were collected
through the system, when participants were working
on a set of tasks.
The system captured the (vision
and motor skill) errors of the user and stored the
information in a database maintained on a server.
The errors were then used to develop a profile
(collection
of
preferences)
of
usage
for
the
participant.
The process of surfing and modifying the Web
page of the participant was predicated on the reading
a requested Web page and transforming the Web
page for the participant based upon parameters that
were captured within the error profile of default
values. The system keeps track of the errors that are
made as the participants worked their way through
the task.
The system automatically updated the
profile based on the errors made. When the number
of vision errors from regular screen operations and
those obtained during the periods where the system
changes font size increases above a preset system
threshold, the font size parameter is increased. In a
similar fashion, an increase in motor skill errors is
used to raise the motor skill parameter value.
The
process for error profile creation is shown in Figure
17.

V. RESULTS
Performance in the experiment was measured based on
the number of errors that participants made while
completing the task set. Errors were chosen over time
due to our belief that the critical issue for the older
adults was successful navigation rather than speed of
performance. Table II shows the mean and standard
deviation of the errors made for the cases where the
Web pages were converted using a profile based on
self assessment, written tests, observation, and on
error detection.
To consider the key question, “Does error
detection produce a profile of the older adults’
accessibility
performance
that
is
comparable
to
profiles based on self assessment, written tests, or
observation?”, we looked at a series of four hypothesis
and we used the paired samples t-test to test the
individual hypothesis.
Hypothesis 1: Testing provides superior results (with
respect to the number of errors a participant makes) to
asking older adults for a self assessment of their
limitations when using the Internet.
Hypothesis 2: One on one observation provides
superior results (with respect to the number of errors a
participant makes) to giving older adults written tests
to determine their limitations when using the Internet.

The next section looks at the discussion of the study.
VI. DISCUSSION
Looking at Hypothesis 1, we see from Table III that
there is a rather low correlation (0.469) between the
error rates of the two methods. The first row in Table
IV shows a t value of 18.551 with a significance of 0.0

indicating that there is a significant difference between
the two samples. From these results, we can see that
written tests were far superior to self assessment in our
study.
The second row of Table IV shows that for
Hypothesis 2, we are able to say that observation
provides a better estimate of an older adult than what
we were able to get from written tests.
The
significance of the t value (6.061) is again 0.0 showing
that there is a significant difference.
Table III still
shows a low level of correlation between the error
rates of the two methods of creating profiles.
Hypothesis 3 compared the error rates of the
observation against self assessment. As in the case of
Hypothesis 1, self assessment performs very poorly
when
compared
to
observation.
Again
the
significance of the t value (19.498) in row 3 of Table
IV is 0.0, indicating that the there is a significant
difference between the two samples.
Table III
indicates a very low correlation between the error rates
of the two methods.
The results of the first three hypotheses indicate
that one on one observation is statistically superior to
either written exams or self assessment. The problem
is that one on one observation is extremely expensive
and does not lend itself to periodic retests of older
adults.
Hypothesis
4
looks
at
the
comparison
of
observation to the proposed error detection approach.
Table III shows a high correlation (0.963) between the
error rates of the two approaches. More important, the
result shown in row four of Table IV indicates that the
two tailed significance is greater than 0.05 and there
was not a significant difference in our study between
creating the user profile based on observation or on
error detection. The importance of this result comes
from
the
work
required
to
create
the
profiles.
Observation is very labor intensive and is difficult to
use with very many users. The use of error detection,
on the other hand, places the burden on the computer
system. It can be applied to any number of users and
is
not
site
specific.
Moreover,
targeting
the
accessibility skills of
an
older adult is not a static
target. The physical and cognitive limitations of older
adults tend to increase as they age.
The dynamic
nature of using an error detection strategy allows the
profile contents to dynamically change as the user
changes.
VII. CONCLUSION
Performance in the experiment was measured based on
a user study consisting of 25 older adults was
developed and performed to compare the proposed
error detection strategy to evaluation strategies based
on self assessment, written tests, and one on one
observation. A server based platform was developed
for the user study. The platform used a user profile
that
contained
a
measurement
of
the
user’s
impairments for motor skills and vision.
The server converted any Web page that the user
requested based on the contents of the user profile.
The results of the study were promising.
Four
hypotheses were tested. The first three compared self-
assessment, written tests and one on one observation.
The study results indicated that observation was
superior with respect to the user error rates. The fourth
hypothesis compared one on one observation against
the proposed error detection strategy.
The study
indicated that there was no statistical difference
between the means of the results of the observation-
based profiles and the results of the error detection-
based profiles.
This is an interesting result in that
doing in depth observations of the potential users is
very labor intensive and error detection places the
burden on the computer system.
Currently, we are
looking at the cognitive phase of our project.
