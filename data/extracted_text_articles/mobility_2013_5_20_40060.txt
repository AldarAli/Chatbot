Abstract—There are several merits of mobile communication 
devices having multiple network interfaces as compared to 
traditional devices with just one interface. Smart phones these 
days are a true example of a 
mobile multi-homed 
communication device with heterogeneous network interfaces. 
Several solutions are available for unicast applications to 
provide seamless handover using the multiple interfaces of a 
multi-homed device in terrestrial networks. However, very 
little has been done on similar support for IP multicast 
mobility support for mobile satellite terminals in a ubiquitous 
multi-beam satellite network. Most of the schemes proposed 
for handovers in multi-homed devices place a lot of emphasis 
on maintaining the multi-homed device identity especially 
when the second interface joins the communication session. 
This increases complexity in the whole system. The issue of 
maintaining the multi-homed device identity plus the 
additional signalling messages involve are neither necessary 
nor desired in an IP multicast communication handover in a 
multi-beam satellite scenario. This paper seeks to exploit the 
group communication features of IP multicast (i.e., the fact 
that anyone can join or leave a multicast group at any time and 
from any location) and the multiple interfaces of a mobile 
Return Channel Satellite Terminal (RCST) to support IP 
multicast communication during handover when a mobile 
multi-homed RCST changes its point of attachment to the 
network from one satellite gateway to another.

 INTRODUCTION  
Next generation satellite systems, nowadays, are 
characterised by the support for on-board processing 
(switching/routing) and multiple spot beams.  These new 
features enable the satellite to make efficient use of its 
allocated resources and provide cost effective network 
services. IP multicasting is a technology in which the same 
data is sent to a group of interested recipients and the 
network replicating the data as required for delivery until a 
copy reaches all intended group members. In a multiple spot 
beam satellite network scenario, IP multicast can be used to 
communicate important service information like the weather 
conditions, on-going disaster zones and information, route 
updates, etc. in long haul flights, global maritime vessels 
and continental trains. Multicasting this information to all 
the interested parties rather than individually informing 
them (i.e., unicast) would save a lot of satellite bandwidth 
resources. 
 With an increasing mobile society like ours today, the 
need for mobility support for IP multicast especially in 
satellite networks with the potential to provide ubiquitous 
communications cannot be overemphasised.  
Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) [1] is an open 
standard 
published 
by 
European 
Telecommunication 
Standards Institute (ETSI) describing digital broadcasting 
using existing satellite (DVB-S), cable (DVB-C), and 
terrestrial (DVB-T) infrastructures. While originally DVB 
was designed primarily for audio and video broadcasting, 
the growth of the Internet and broadband data services has 
led to the development of the DVB networks to support the 
transport and delivery of IP based traffic. The Digital Video 
Broadcasting 
Return 
Channel 
Satellite 
(DVB-RCS) 
provides the mechanism to use a satellite as a send data on 
the return path via the satellite. The large geographic 
coverage and broadcast capabilities of the DVB-S/RCS 
network has the advantage of providing IP based services to 
areas where the deployment of terrestrial infrastructure is 
uneconomical or impossible.  
Based on the possible network topologies, a DVB-
S/RCS network support two types of IP multicast services, 
i.e., star and mesh IP multicast [2]. In star IP multicast, the 
multicast sources is assumed to be located on terrestrial 
network which sends the multicast data to the Regenerative 
Satellite Gateway (RSGW) which in turn forwards the 
multicast traffic to several RCSTs [3] in the satellite 
network. On the other hand, in Mesh IP multicast, the 
source and receivers are all RCSTs of the same interactive 
satellite network. Each RCST here may have one or more 
user terminals behind it.  
This paper focuses on IP multicast receiver mobility 
which is the ability of a moving satellite terminal to 
continue receiver multicast traffic as it moves and changes it 
point of attachment within the satellite network from one 
satellite gateway (GW) to another. This is known as 
gateway handovers. This paper shall focus on the star IP 
multicast service in which a mobile receiver (i.e., an 
aircraft) with an on-going multicast session connected to a 
geosynchronous (GEO) satellite has to undergo a GW 
handover. 
Due to the large round trip delay in GEO satellite 
networks all handover procedures in multi-beam satellite 
networks can cause serious link quality degradation or even

disconnection of an on-going session. During handover, 
there is a time period when the mobile node cannot receive 
or send traffic because of the link switching delay. This 
period of time known as the handover latency constitutes the 
primary cause of packet loss during handovers. Longer 
round trip delays in DVB-S/RCS satellite networks imply 
longer handover latency meaning more packets loss. 
Recently, mobile communication devices with multiple 
network interfaces (e.g., smart phones) are becoming more 
and more common. Currently, multi-homed mobile devices 
are mainly used for maintaining connectivity and achieving 
desired application quality of service. For example, when 
link quality on a given network interface drops below a 
certain threshold value, the multi-homed mobile device will 
initiate a handover to another network interface with better 
link quality. A common example of this is the handovers 
between 3G, HSPA and HSPA+ networks in new 
smartphones when travelling in a car from one city to 
another. This paper proposes a novel multi-homing based 
solution for achieving seamless mobility for IP multicast 
application in multi-beam satellite networks.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents the general gateway handover signalling sequence 
and some existing IP multicast receiver mobility solutions 
that may be adopted for satellite networks. In Section III, 
the proposed multi-homing based solution for IP multicast 
receiver mobility is described in detail. The performance 
evaluation of the proposed system is presented in Section 
IV. Finally, conclusions are discussed in Section V. 
II. 
GATEWAY HANDOVER SIGNALLING AND MULTICAST 
MOBILITY 
A. Gateway Handovers in a DVB-S/RCS network 
Figure 1 shows the signalling sequence at GW handover 
[3]. When the Network Control Centre (NCC) receives the 
synchronization (SYNC) burst from the mobile RCST 
(mRCST) containing the handover request, it will retrieve 
the target beam identity from its database and determine 
whether the beam belongs to a different GW. Once the NCC 
establishes that the target beam belongs to a different GW, a 
gateway handover is initiated. The NCC will then update its 
service information (SI) tables which include Terminal 
Burst Time Plan (TBTP), Super-frame Composition Table 
(SCT), Frame Composition Table (FCT) & Time-slot 
Composition Table (TCT). The NCC will send an SNMP 
Set-Request message that includes the updated SI tables and 
the routing update information (RUI) of the mRCST to the 
target GW to ensure that the target GW gets ready for 
connection with the mRCST. Upon reception of the SNMP 
Set-Request message, the target GW will allocate bandwidth 
resources for the mRCST according to the new burst time 
plan sent by the NCC. The SNMP Get-Response message is 
then sent by target GW to the NCC. This is followed by a 
SNMP Set-Request message from the NCC to the source 
GW, which includes the mRCST identity and the SI tables. 
Upon reception of the SNMP Set-Request message, the 
source GW will start buffering the Forward Link (FL) user 
traffic to be forwarded to the target GW during handover. 
The source GW then acknowledges the NCC by sending a 
SNMP Get-Response message. Once the SNMP Get-
Response message is received from source GW, a gateway 
handover command is issued to the mRCST from NCC in a 
Mobility Control Descriptor carried in a Terminal 
Information Message Unicast (TIMu) using the old beam. 
The source GW now updates its route mapping table and 
released resources used by the mRCST. Once the mRCST 
receives the handover command, it synchronizes with the 
NCC and the target GW, retunes itself to the target beam 
and receives traffic from the target beam which comes 
through the target GW.  
Hence, it can be seen that for a mRCST with one 
interface (i.e., one transceiver), there comes a time interval 
during the GW handover execution phase, when the forward 
link and/or return link user traffic is discontinued. This time 
is indicated in Figure 1 and is the time when the mRCST is 
switching its point of attachment to the network from source 
GW to target GW. Assuming here that the NCC is located in 
a different GW from the source and target GWs, handover 
latency for forward link (HLFL) from Figure 1 is given by:

latency is slightly greater than the RL handover latency.

Since the FL and RL handovers are done in parallel, the 
handover latency of the one that takes longer to complete 
then becomes the overall handover latency. So, the FL 
handover latency here becomes the overall handover latency 
of the mRSCT. 
Due to this link switching handover latency, seamless 
handover in multi-beam satellite networks cannot be 
achieved in a mRCST with only one transceiver. This 
handover latency has a huge impact on real-time 
applications. Buffering delay/jitter-sensitive application 
traffic during handover has no benefit since the off-time is 
rather high and therefore practically impossible to 
compensate for the delay introduced by buffering.  
This handover latency is mainly associated with the link 
switching procedure in multi-beam DVB satellite networks 
i.e., the time when the forward link (FL)/return link (RL) 
user traffic is discontinued as the mRCST is releasing the 
resources in source beam and acquiring new set of resources 
in the target beam since the standard mRCST (one 
transmitter and one receiver) cannot establish connections 
on both beams simultaneously. This therefore implies that 
the handover latency is independent of the higher layer 
mobility management protocols used during GW handover 
so far as the mobile terminal has just one transceiver. 
B. IP Multicast mobility  
This section presents some existing solution for IP 
multicast mobility designed for terrestrial networks and the 
Internet that may be used in the satellite network. In general, 
Home Subscription (HS) and Remote Subscription (RS) 
based approaches have been proposed in [4] [5] [6] to 
support IP multicast receiver mobility in terrestrial 
networks. In the HS-based approach, the mobile node while 
away from home network establishes a bidirectional tunnel 
with its home agent (i.e., a multicast enabled router in the 
home network of the mobile node). Any multicast traffic 
received by home network for this mobile node is then 
tunnelled to the mobile node in the foreign network. HS 
based approach relies on mobile IP (MIP) [7] for its 
operation. While such HS based approach could be adapted 
for use in satellite networks, it inherits the drawbacks of 
MIP [8] like the triangular routing problem where, any 
traffic destined for the mobile receiver must pass through its 
home network. This will further increase the overall 
handover latency as additional signalling time is required to 
establish the bidirectional tunnel between home GW and 
target GW during the GW handover, as this can only be 
done when the terminal connects to the target GW and 
receives a new Care-of-Address. Traffic from the multicast 
source to the mobile receiver will incur additional 
propagation delay due to triangular routing problem. This 
triangular routing problem becomes even more acute if the 
target GW and the multicast source are located in the same 
terrestrial network as shown in Figure 2. In this case, after 
GW handover, the multicast traffic will be first sent from 
the source in target network to the home GW and then 
tunnelled back to target GW for onward transmission 
through satellite to the mobile multicast receiver (mRCST). 
The RS-based approach, on the other hand, requires the 
mobile receiver to simply re-subscribe to all the multicast 
groups it was a member of in the home network after 
110

handover to a foreign network. Here, additional time is 
required for multicast group subscription and tree 
reconstruction to new location if the mobile receiver is the 
first member of the group in the new network. 
These approaches if adapted for use in satellite networks 
to support receiver mobility will have no effect on the HL 
described above. This is because HL is the minimum time 
required for the mRCST with only one transceiver to release 
satellite resources in one beam and acquire new set of 
resources in the next beam and is independent of these 
mobility support mechanisms. Any such mobility support 
technique for a mRCST with only one transceiver can only 
increase the HL given in (2) by adding further signalling 
delay or multicast tree setup delay.

Triangular Routing Problem 
A multi-homed LEO satellite connected with two ground 
stations to support network mobility in space was proposed 
in [9] and multi-homed end nodes were proposed in [10] to 
support terminal mobility. The two schemes rely solely on 
the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [11] to 
maintain the identity of the multi-homed devices when the 
second interface joins the communication during handover 
procedure. Mechanisms to support network and terminal 
mobility for multi-homed device in IPv6 networks were 
presented in [12] and [13]. Host Identity Protocol [14] was 
adopted for providing mobility for multi-homed mobile 
devices in [15] and [16]. The proposed mechanism in [15] 
suffers from long handover delay owing to duplicate address 
detection (DAD), location update, and other signalling 
overhead. The proposed mechanism in [16] introduces large 
complexities in access routers like the tracking and updating 
mobile host location, security signalling, assigning network 
prefix per host identifier and using the same network prefix 
within the same network domain to avoid DAD. All these 
multi-homed based schemes have been designed primarily 
for unicast communication, where the emphasis is laid on 
designing protocols/mechanisms to maintain the identity of 
the multi-homed node when its second network interfaces 
joins the communication during handover procedure. These 
system complexities plus additional signalling messages 
employed to maintain host identity during handover are 
neither necessary in an IP multicast communication nor 
desirable in a satellite network with scarce and expensive 
satellite resources.  
III. 
PROPOSED MULTI-HOMING BASED IP MULTICAST 
RECEIVER MOBILITY 
In order to reduce the link handover delay described in 
the previous section, the proposed method leverages on the 
group communications features of IP multicast and the fact 
that anyone can join or leave a multicast group at any time.  
Figure 3 shows the proposed internal architecture of a multi-
homed mRCST for Satellite Interactive System.  
Figure 3 contains new features/entities in addition to the 
standard RCST given in [1]. These include: 
 An additional broadcast interface (IF1) (i.e., for 
receiving data via DVB-S) in the broadcast interface 
module with its corresponding additional interactive 
interface (IF1) (i.e., for sending data via DVB-RCS) in 
the interactive interface module, making the mRCST a 
multi-homed device. 
 A database which holds information about the global 
map of the interactive satellite network (i.e., 
information 
about 
beams, 
their 
locations 
and 
frequency, gateways - location and IP addresses)  as 
well as all active connections in the mRCST. 
 A message chamber which can issue IGMP join report 
and leave messages during handover between IF0 and 
IF1 
 The controller which manages the data base, the 
interfaces and has complete control over which 
interface 
the 
traffic 
leaves/enters 
the 
mRCST 
especially when the two are active (i.e., during 
handover) 
It is assumed that the mRCST (on aircrafts, ships, trains 
etc.) knows its complete route map (all beams and GWs 
along its path) before start of journey. As shown in Figure 3, 
the multi-homed mRCST contains two pairs of satellite 
network interfaces, IF0 and IF1 in the broadcast interface 
module with their corresponding pairs in the interactive 
interface module.  The interfaces in the broadcast interface 
module are used for receiving FL traffic and signalling 
while those in the interactive interface module are used to 
send RL traffic and signalling. If FL traffic is received 
through IF0 in broadcast interface module, then the reply 
(RL traffic) will be sent out through IF0 in the interactive 
interface module. The same holds for traffic received 
through IF1 in the broadcast interface module. 
When the multi-homed mRCST, i.e., the aircraft in 
Figure 4, with an on-going multicast session through 
interface IF0 enters an overlapping area of two satellite 
beams belonging to different GWs, it will detect the 
presence of the new satellite beam.

The controller will then consult the database within the 
mRCST to confirm whether the detected new beam is the 
target beam. If the detected new beam is the target beam, 
IF1 through instructions from the controller will then 
establish a connection with the target beam using normal 
logon procedure. This is closely followed by the message 
chamber issuing an IGMP join report through IF1 to the 
NCC to join all the multicast groups that the mRCST is a 
member of. Due to the fact that anybody can join or leave a 
multicast group at any time, the joining of the multicast 
session by the second interface IF1 does not need to be 
proven that the two interfaces (IF0 and IF1) belong to the 
same device. This therefore makes the handover hidden 
from the satellite network i.e., as far as the satellite network 
is concerned, the second interface (IF1) may just be another 
RCST that has logged on to the satellite network and 
established communication.

After this, the controller starts directing all other new 
communications or connections from the mRCST through 
IF1. Immediately IF1 starts receiving traffic from the on- 
going multicast session(s), the message chamber will issue 
an IGMP leave message through IF0. Eventually, all 
communications or connections from and to the mRCST are 
channelled through IF1 and once this happens then IF0 then 
enters a stand-by/log-off state.  Considering the fact that in a 
GEO satellite network, the area of overlapping beams can 
stretch for many miles, it is possible to keep the old 
connection through old point of attachment (GWA1) alive 
until the new one via GWA2 is set up and all 
communications transferred to the new link. When the 
mRCST enters the next area of overlapping gateway beams, 
the same procedure is followed that will see all 
communications on mRCST transferred back to IF0 from 
IF1.  
The advantages of this scheme are: 
 
it is simple to implement 
 
minimal handover latency – only due to link retuning 
time 
 
there are no packet losses at all due to handover as the 
handover is completely and truly seamless 
IV. 
COMPARISON OF GW HANDOVER LATENCY 
As stated in Section II, the GW handover latency of a 
standard mRCST with one interactive interface is given by 
(4). Assuming that the Super-frame duration is 500ms [17], 
satellite round trip delay is 250ms and using beam/gateway 
handover details given in [3], we can establish Table I. 
According to [3], the TD in all satellite network devices 
(NCC, RCST and GW) could take 2 - 3 Super-frames and 
the TMax (Tx_, Rx_tuning), 1 - 2 seconds. This explains why TD 
and TMax (Tx_, Rx_tuning) have two different sets of values in 
Table I. 
Case 1: when the TD and TMax (Tx_, Rx_tuning) take minimum 
values.

 Using (4) and the values in Table I, the change in 
handover latency (HL) with respect to acquisition 
uncertainty (TACQ_u) for a mRCST with one interactive 
interface can be calculated and compare it with our 
proposed scheme which has two interactive interfaces and a 
HL of zero.

CONCLUSION 
Based on the DVB specifications, a mobile RCST with a 
single transceiver will always face a small period of service 
disruption during the handover phase. Higher layer mobility 
management protocols cannot remove this intrinsic delay. 
This paper describes in detail how a multi-homed mRCST 
can be used to support IP multicast receiver mobility during 
gateway handover in a global multi-beam satellite network. 
It proposes the internal architecture of such a multi-homed 
mRCST. The use of the proposed multi-homed terminal 
eliminates 
this 
handover 
latency 
for 
IP 
multicast 
communication over the satellite as it changes its point of 
attachment to the satellite network from one satellite 
gateway to another in a global multi-beam satellite network.
