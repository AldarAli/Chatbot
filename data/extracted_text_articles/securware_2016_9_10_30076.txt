Abstract—Critical infrastructure protection is presently seen as
an important aspect of society’s maintenance of functional
continuity from an economic and social perspective. This fact is
seen
as
a
motivation
for
the
development
of
relevant
approaches and methodologies, which have significant impact
to the critical infrastructure protection and resilience level.
The interactions of various critical infrastructure subsystems
have a major relation to the domino and synergy effect
assessment and on the overall critical infrastructure protection
resilience level. The domino and synergy effect impact to
critical infrastructure resilience will therefore be described in
the article by a selected mathematical model. The model will
present the assessment approach of inter-connections modeling
between
critical
infrastructure
subsectors,
allowing
the
evaluation of the potential domino effect in the context of
Czech Republic critical infrastructure.

INTRODUCTION
Increasing technological dependence increased the need
to identification and designation of elementary State system,
whose malfunction will have a major impact on the society
functional continuity maintenance in all its social aspects. In
the context of the previous argument, the elementary State
system is considered critical infrastructure. Perceptions of
critical
infrastructure
are
not
a
modern
phenomenon,
although it can be stated that there is an increased attention
on the protection of critical infrastructure since 2001, which
is strongly influenced by the turbulence in the security
environment. Influences in the security environment crate a
discussion about relevancy of modeling of domino and
synergy effects. There are many relevant research works
which are addressing topics and issues of modeling, where
the most proper were presented by Y., Haimes, and P., Jiang,
(2001) [9], R. Santos, (2006) [10], Y., Haimes, (2015) [11],
Rehak [12], T., Macaulay (2008) [13]. Relevant outcomes of
above mentioned research works include developing the
theoretical and, in some cases, also practical framework for
modeling and simulation of critical infrastructure in a wider
context. The framework was filled in this article by practical
application
of
selected
methodologies
and
models
in
connection with the Czech Republic critical infrastructure.
The second part of the article discusses about theoretical
baseline of structures and principles of modeling. The third
part therefore theoretically explains the selected model's
possibilities and application potential. The practical use and
application of selected mathematical model is presented in
the fourth section.
II.
STRUCTURES AND BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MODELING
In everyday language, the term modelling has different
meanings and interpretations. It depends on the nature of the
expertise, the degree of knowledge and education, culture,
purpose, and many other attributes. Usually, in the model we
are developing a kind of reality copy, or create a "prototype",
or simulation, how something should be. Always we observe
"something" from a certain point of view or interest for a
purpose. It is essential to correctly define the elements of
interest, abstracted from the whole and develop a system
where the basic elements are incorporated together with the
key factors influencing the elements. Relations between
elements should be clearly visible, quantifiable so we can say
that the elements of the system are structured. This structure
"links tightness" between the elements is the criterion which
defines whether the element is included or not in a given
system and it is essential for the identification of impacts,
and their level decides the success or failure of the system
understanding. Ultimately, this leads to the abstraction of the
real nature of the elements in their formal substitution
variables and maintaining the relations between them have
been observed in the corresponding real elements, i.e.
developing a mathematical model. The model is already
formal relations between quantities expressed by features,
causes
and
consequences
dependent
respectively
independent
variables
that
come
into
corresponding
quantitative values. This means that the real system is
represented in a different form, which is clearer, simpler and
more understandable and should give an idea about the
future direction of the system. The model is in a way a copy
of reality to which it corresponds (it is isomorphic) [1].
The explanation of the model can be expressed in two
aspects. In particular, the model provides the knowledge of
necessary consequences. What will be, how it will be, what,
can be expected if "nothing" affects the system from outside
we call this projection. The second aspect is that the model
presents an idea of the direction. That is, the model gives an
answer for a possible state in the future, provided that "now"
is something that happened. We call this prediction. The
theoretical basis will then be applied in the context of the
mathematical modelling in a broader context.

LEONTIEF’S ECONOMY MODEL, STATIC
INTERPRETATION
An extensively studied model applied to the problem of
Critical Infrastructure is based on Leontief’s economic
model that addresses the description of the n companies’
production steady state X 1, X 2. . . Xn of the selected sys-
tem. If Xi company for its 1 dollar production needs from
Xj company to purchase production worth ai, j, dollar and
the matrix A = (i, j) n degree represents the supplier -
customer companies relations X1, X2,. . . Xn (Leontief’s
matrix of technical coefficients, which sum’s in each
column are less than or equal to 1). Let U = [U1, U2 . . .
UN] be the vector of external requirements for final
consumption for customers outside the system. The question
is, how much every company must make in order to satisfy
the
requirements
with
external
customers
(external,
consumption outside the system) and the supplier - customer
organizations
requirements
of
the
system
(internal,
consumption system). If we searched the entire output
denoted x = [x1, x2…Xn], then it is obviously that x - for
the internal consumption (production for the system). It can
however also be expressed by the product Ax. Then the
equation x - u = Ax describes the equilibrium between
production
companies.
It
describes
their
mutual
requirements and the requirements of external customers
(produced just as much as they need. They do not
overproduction or deficiency). Since the totals of each
column of the matrix A are less than or equal to 1, the
equation always has the only solution as x = (I - A) -1U
where I is the identity matrix. The diagram for the three
companies is presented in Figure 1. [2][3][4].

A.
Domino and synergy effect and Critical Infrastructure
elements degradation spread
To describe the internal state, we take into account the
relationships between elements of the system, their response
to input u and momentary state x. If the system is linear,
status change can be described by the equation
dx/dt=Ax+Bu
(1)
or in the discrete form by the equation
x(k+1)=Ax(k)+Bu(k).
(2)
Leontief’s economic model can be used in the context of
Critical Infrastructure, wherein x is a Critical Infrastructure
element degradation importance, u is an input variable to
cause a primary Critical Infrastructure element degradation,
A is a matrix of pairwise dependence, which features
describe the tag container relation between two elements,
and reflect the transfer of degradation from first element to
second. Let paired relationship between elements Xi and Xj
be expressed graphically Xi → Xj with transfer coefficient 
ai,j. If the value of the element degradation XJ is xj, its
transfer to the element Xi is the value of ai, j ∙ xj. This is a 
first degree transfer Figure 2.
Figure 2. First degree transfer [4]
The value ai,j∙xj spreads from Xi element to another and 
the second degree transfer is created. Next transfer creates a
third transfer and so on. The following figure 3 shows the
pair dependence of 5 Critical Infrastructure elements, which
defines the first degree transfer. Second degree transfers are
for example X1 → X2  → X3,  X1 → X2  → X4, X2 → X3  
→ X5, X2 → X4  → X5. Third degree transfers are for 
example X1 → X2  → X3  → X5, X1 → X2  → X4  → X1, 
Fig. 3. For example, if the element X1 was degraded, the
transfer X1 → X2  → X4  → X1 increase its degradation. 
Figure 3. Third degree degradation [8]
The mentioned transfers are only possible passage as
degradation can spread. It depends which element has
been degraded, which element is "active" at being
degraded and which way the degradation will spread.
Figure 4 shows the initial degradation of the first
element with the value x1 = 0:15 ("active element").

From Figure 5, the first degree transfer degradation is
transferred to the second element in the 0.03 value. The
other elements degradation did not transfer to and for the
next transfer will be "active" second element.
Figure 5. Second element degradation [8]
The second element delegate the second-degree
transfer to third element degradation in the value of 0:03 ∙ 
0.3 = 0.009 and the fourth element transferred degradation
in the value of 0:03 ∙ 0.5 = 0015th "active" elements are X3 
and X4 (see Figure 6).
Figure 6. Degradation to third element [8]
From the third and fourth element is third degree
degradation transferred to the elements X5 and X1 in the
values 0009 ∙ 0015 ∙ 0.7 + 0.4 = 0.0123 to the element X5 
valued at 0.015 ∙ 0.1 = 0.0015 to X1. "Active" elements are 
X1 and X5 but the transfer from X5 does not exist, and the
cycle is repeated with the "active" element X1. Figure 7.
Figure 7. Third degree degradation [8]
In general, the input to the system resulting to primary
elements degradation and by their mutual linkage spreading
from one element to the other, from the second to the third
and so on. The way degradation spreads through the system
can be called a domino effect. If x0 = u is the first degree
degradation, then by paired dependence will be extended to
subsequent degradation, which increased by Δ1 = Ax0, 
which generates the subsequent amendment of Δ2 = AΔ1 = 
A (Ax0) = A2x0, etc. After n steps we get an increased
value Dn = A (Dn-1) = Anx0. As with Leontief’s economic
model it forms the analogous question of whether the
transfer of degradation would settle to the final value x,
which will also vary, e.g. or reaches a steady state. That
occurs when the resulting value of the degradation x is
decomposed into the sum of the initial input degradation
and degradation generated by domino effect. This is
represented by equality x = Ax + u. In this case, the totals of
each column of the matrix A may be greater than 1 and the
equation may not have a solution. When equilibrium occurs,
the resulting degradation is x = ((I-A)^τ)U [5], [6], [7]. 
For the above example, the pair-wise dependency matrix
has the form:
and input degradation is given by the vector x0 = u =
[0.15,0,0,0,0]. Additions degradation from "zero" (initial) to
ninth are equal to:
∆0 = A0x0  = Ix0 = x0 = [0.15,0,0,0,0],  
∆1 = Ax0 = [0,0.03,0,0,0],  
∆2 = A∆1 = A(Ax0) = A2x0 = [0,0,0.009,0.015,0], 
∆3 = A∆2 = A(A(A(x0)) = A3x0 = [0.0015,0,0,0,0.0123], 
∆4 = A∆3 = A(A(A(A(x0))) = A4x0 = [0,0.0003,0,0,0],  
∆5 = A∆4 = A5x0 = [0,0.00009,0.00015,0,0], 
∆6 = A∆5 = A6x0 = [0.000015,0,0,0,0.000123],  
∆7 = A∆6 = A7x0 = [0,0.000003,0,0,0], 
∆8 = A∆7 = A8x0 = [0,3x10-6,0,0,0], 
∆9 = A∆8 = A9x0 = [0,0,9x10-7, 1.5x10-6,0]. 
The resulting value of elements degradation is given by
the n matrix equations solution Ax = ax + u as x = (I - A) -
1U = [0.151, 0.030, 0.009, 0.151, 0.012] T, Figure 8 - Graph

For the input of degradation of the first and second
elements in the values u1 = 0:15, 0:25 u2 = (vector u =
[0.15, 0.25, 0, 0, 0]), the resulting degradation of the
components of the vector x = (I - A) = -1U are [0.164,
0.283, 0.085, 0.141, 0.116] Figure 9 - Graph 2.
Figure 9. Graph 2 [8]
If all the elements are equally degraded, for example to
0.15 (vector u = [0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15] T) and the
resulting degradation is given by the vector x = (I - A) -1U
= [0.174, 0.185, 0.205, 0.242, 0.391] T. The percentage of
degradation increased in steps of 16%, 23%, 36%, 61% and
160%. From these values it is clear that the most vulnerable
elements are X3, X4, X5. X5 is the element which should to
be protected as much as possible, Figure 10 [8].

IV.
OUTPUTS OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC CRITICAL
INFRASTRUCTURE PRACTICAL MODELLING
The critical infrastructure in the Czech Republic is
divided into the 27 areas (sectors) that have significant input
into societal functions. Within the modelling they were
established reciprocal links in terms of the coefficient of
activity and passivity, which allows to determine the linkage
value Activity coefficient expresses the potential of a critical
infrastructure area affecting the other areas (electricity for
district heating) and the passivity coefficient ex-pressed the
impact of other areas to selected critical infrastructure area
(electricity) - (district heating - electricity). The quantitative
expression of these coefficients is implemented through
Qualitative Risk Correlation Analysis [8]. Determination of
linkages has been implemented through the 27x27 matrix.
After determining the values of linkages, Leontief’s model
was applied up to the third degree of degradation, which
expresses dominoes and then synergistic effects in three time
intervals 24, 48, 72h for 25% of an electricity power failure
(see Figure 11) .

Figure 11. Impact of 25% of electricity power failure
For a better illustration, a 3D graph was generated,
which expresses the impact of electricity power failure to
the other areas of the Czech Republic critical infrastructure.
From the graph you can read the most vulnerable areas of
critical infrastructure and the overall spread of dominoes
and synergistic effects. This approach allowed us to identify
secondary and tertiary linkages below the area of the
electricity power failure in the context of the time frame.
These facts will then be implemented in the process of crisis
preparedness of critical infrastructure operators. Another
benefit will be the use of the conclusions in the project

CONCLUSION
The facts and knowledge presented in this paper pointed
to the possibilities of mathematical modelling in the context
of
the
needs
of
critical
infrastructure
protection
and
resilience. The first section of the article presented a
definition of critical infrastructure as a fundamental system
affecting the society functional continuity.. Another part of
the text dealt with the general approach to the model
development that has been further developed within the
application of Leontief’s economic model to the issues of
determining the interactions and evaluation of domino and
synergy effect within the system elements. In the end of this
publication, we present partial results from the application of
the model for Czech Republic critical infrastructure system
and security research project RESILIENCE 2015 issues.
