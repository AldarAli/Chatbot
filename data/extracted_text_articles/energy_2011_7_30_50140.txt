Abstract—The contribution of plug-in Electric Vehicles (EV) 
for frequency response was investigated. 24-hour EV load 
profiles obtained from a probabilistic approach was used. 
Three time dependent charging modes were considered. A 
single bus model of Great Britten power system was used for 
simulations. Simulations were carried out for a day with low 
demand. The simulation results shows that shedding EVs that 
are charging can reduce the frequency excursion significantly.

 INTRODUCTION 
A number of countries have taken specific policy 
initiatives to encourage renewable power generation and for 
introducing 
electric 
vehicles 
as 
they 
contribute 
to 
decarbonise their electrical energy and transport sectors. For 
example, in the UK, 15% of all energy is to be supplied by 
renewable energy by 2020. This translates into 30 - 40% of 
electrical energy being generated from renewable sources. It 
is anticipated that a large proportion of this power will come 
from wind power. Perhaps up to 40 GW of wind turbine 
generation on a Great Britain (GB) system with a total of 
around 100 GW of generating plant. The UK government 
also has plans to cut emissions from domestic transport by 
14% on 2008 levels by 2020. 
The uncertainty brought by variability of renewable 
energy generation will introduce a number of concerns over 
operation of the power system. A very high penetration of 
renewable energy sources demands considerable increase in 
frequency response and reserve that the system operator 
should maintain to ensure frequency performance within the 
control limits [1][2].  
In this paper, the flexibility offered by plug-in electric 
vehicles (EV) by removing their charging load immediately 
after a frequency event is investigated. It is anticipated that 
this will enable operation of the future power system with 
current level of reserve margins.  
The paper is organized as follows: initially the frequency 
control in the GB system is discussed; secondly integrating 
EVs for frequency studies is discussed; then modeling of the 
GB system with EV for frequency studies are discussed and 
finally results are presented. 
II. 
FREQUENCY CONTROL IN THE GB SYSTEM 
Frequency is determined and controlled by balancing 
system demand and total generation. The nominal frequency 
of the GB system is 50Hz. If the demand is greater than the 
generation, the frequency falls below 50Hz.  Conversely, if 
the generation is greater than the demand, the frequency rises 
above 50Hz. In practice, the frequency varies around 50Hz 
by a small amount as the system demand continuously 
changes. When there is a significant power imbalance of the 
system, the frequency will show a large deviation.  
The Electricity Supply Regulations require the system 
frequency to be maintained at 50Hz ±1% [1]. The 
Transmission License places an obligation on the National 
Grid Company (NGC) to plan and operate the system to 
ensure compliance with the Electricity Supply Regulations 
[2]. To meet these obligations the system is designed to 
accept the largest credible loss of 1320MW of generation 
(two of the largest generators, 2×660MW, on the system) 
and is operated to the following frequency containment 
policies: 
• 
System frequency under normal operating conditions 
will be maintained within the operational limits of 
50±0.2 Hz (NGC’s current practice), 
• 
For a sudden loss of generation or demand up to 
300MW, the maximum frequency change will be 
limited to ±0.2Hz, 
• 
For a sudden loss of generation or demand greater than 
300MW and less than or equal to 1000MW, the 
maximum frequency change will be limited to ±0.5Hz, 
• 
For a sudden loss of generation greater than 1000MW 
and less than or equal to 1320MW, the frequency 
change will be limited to –0.8Hz with frequency 
restored to 49.5Hz within 1 minute. 
Any loss of generation greater than 1320MW will be 
treated as an emergency condition as it may cause the system 
frequency to fall below 49Hz. Automatic low frequency load 
shedding arrangements usually commence at 48.8Hz. In the 
event that the frequency is above 52Hz or below 47Hz, the 
independent protective actions are permitted to protect 
generators against danger to plant and/or for personnel 
safety. 
A typical frequency transient for a generation loss of 
1320MW is shown in Figure 1 [3][4].

Even though EVs are considered as an ideal choice for 
providing primary and secondary response, they have a 
negative effect during phase OX (see Figure 1). As modern 
wind turbine generators and EVs are connected to the grid 
through a power electronic interface, they will not contribute 
to the system inertia. This reduction in the overall system 
inertia and the increase of demand will lead to rapid change 
in frequency during phase OX. 
III. 
INTEGRATING EVS FOR FREQUENCY SERVICES 
An EV could participate in low frequency response 
services mainly in two ways. Easiest approach would be to 
switch off all EVs that are charging. This will introduce a 
proportional reduction in load, thus reducing the frequency 
excursion. In an event of a high frequency event all the plug-
in EVs that are in stand-by mode with the state of charge of 
battery is less than 100% could be charged thus adding an 
additional load to the grid. EVs could also support the grid 
by acting as an energy store. For example during a low 
frequency event, EVs could discharge its stored energy thus 
acting as a distributed energy source. This paper concentrates 
on former aspect that is disconnecting a charging fleet of 
EVs during a frequency event. 
The way EVs could participate for frequency services 
depends on the grid operator. For example, in the UK the 
frequency response services such as Firm Frequency 
Response 
(FFR) 
and 
Frequency 
Control 
Demand 
Management (FCDM) allow demand side participation in 
primary frequency control. The large-scale consumers are 
contracted in advance to switch OFF their loads (more than 
10 MW and 3 MW in FFR and FCDM respectively) during a 
frequency excursion. In FFR and FCDM schemes, the 
contracted consumer should reduce load within 30 sec and 2 
sec and maintain 10min and 30 min respectively. 
A. Individual EV on a frequency-responsive switch 
The demand side support for frequency reserve by 
controlling loads was proposed as early as in 1980 [5]. The 
paper proposed a frequency-responsive switch which 
controls significant energy consuming industrial or domestic 
loads. A similar switch could be utilized at each EV to 
switch them off when a frequency excursion occurs. 
Recently, Smart Meter (SM) has drawn wide attention as 
a device which can help to save energy and to improve the 
efficiency of a power system. A number of initiatives that 
deploy smart meters are reported in [6]. The SM has a two-
way communication between the supplier and also with 
domestic appliances including EVs connected to home area 
network (HAN). On the receipt of a signal from suppliers, 
the SMs could send signals to the control units to shed the 
EV immediately.  
B. EV as a virtual power plant (VPP) 
Several studies have identified the potential of EVs to 
participate in the electricity markets [7][8]. As power 
capabilities of an individual EV is rather small, their 
participation in the electricity markets will require a new 
entity: the EV Supplier/Aggregator (EVS/A). The EVS/A 
will serve as an intermediary between a large number of EVs 
and market players and/or system operators [9]. The role of 
the EVS/A is to cluster geographically dispersed EVs, and 
manage their generation and demand portfolios as a single 
entity.  
The Virtual Power Plant (VPP) concept is an aggregation 
model which aims to overcome the challenges of Distributed 
Energy Resources’ (DER) integration and enable their 
market participation. The VPP concept is considered as an 
ideal candidate for EVS/A. Figure 2 shows how the VPP 
interacts with the system operators (DSO and TSO). Upon 
recognizing a frequency excursion, the system operator 
could instruct the VPP to shed some or all of the charging 
EVs.

MODELLING OF POWER SYSTEM AND EVS FOR 
FREQUENCY STUDIES 
A. Power system representation 
Assuming a coherent response of all generators in the 
system to changes in the load, the power system can be 
represented by an equivalent generator [11]. The equivalent 
generator has an inertia constant 
Heq
 and calculated using 
the following equation:

A simple model representing the inertia and damping of 
the GB system without the contribution due to governor 
action of synchronous generation is shown in Figure 3. In the 
model ∆Pm refers to change in mechanical power of all the 
generators on the GB system and ∆PL is any change in total 
load. The damping providing by rotating loads is lumped 
into a single damping constant D.

The typical speed droop setting for both thermal and 
hydro generator governors is around 5% in per unit value. 
Thus, a system (as above) with a number of machines, each 
with a droop of 5%, will have a total system speed droop 
Req
 of 5%. However, the actual speed droop may range 
from 2% to 12%, depending on the different types of unit 
[11]. 
Taking account of the characteristics of steam and hydro 
turbines in the system, a system turbine-governor model 
shown in Figure 4 can be derived. The speed control of the 
turbine is provided by a droop governor with an equivalent 
gain value, 
Req
. It operates on an input of the speed 
deviation formed between the reference speed and the actual 
speed. This changes the governor valve (steam turbine) or 
gate (hydro turbine) position. The typical governor actuator 
time constant, 
G
T , is 0.2 second. For a stable performance of 
the speed control, a transient-droop-compensation, which is a 
lead-lag transfer function with time constants 
1T  and 
2T , is 
introduced between governor and turbine. The turbine relates 
the response of mechanical power output following the 
governor action and is characterized by a time constant 
TT  
which varies between 0.3 and 0.5 second.

identification and model validation. A severe frequency 
event shown in Figure 5 which occurred in the UK on 27th 
May 2008 was used for validation.

C. EV representation 
To investigate the impact of the EV participation, a vital 
step is how to obtain realistic 24-hour EV load profiles. 
Different from conventional load forecasting, there is no 
historical EV use data available for reference. A feasible way 
is to generate the profiles via reasonable predictions and 
assumptions 
of 
EV 
market 
penetration, 
technical 
specifications, and use patterns (especially charging 
patterns), etc.

To determine regular EV charging profile a probabilistic 
approach was used. More details of this approach could be 
found in [12]. In this study three time dependent charging 
modes, namely, after-work charging, on-work and after-work 
charging and delayed night charging were considered. The 
EV power demand profiles for 2020 were obtained for three 
charging modes and shown in Figure 6. The information 
used in this study in mainly from reference [6].

Figure 7 shows the model used to investigate the EV 
frequency response for the 2020 GB system. It was assumed 
that immediately after a frequency event is detected, EVs 
which are charging on the power system are disconnected 
using a frequency sensitive switch. This model was 
implemented in MATLAB/Simulink.

RESULTS 
Based on the obtained EV power demand profiles and the 
developed GB system model, the contribution from EVs for 
frequency response was studied. Figure 8 shows the EV 
contribution to the primary frequency response under 
different EV loads and low total demand condition.  It is 
assumed that demand in 2020 is as same as in 2008 due to 
electricity network efficiency improvement activities in GB. 
The demand used in the simulations is the minimum summer 
GB demand in 2008 plus the three EV load profiles shown in 
Figure 6. It is assumed that the EV loads will be 
disconnected as soon as frequency starts to drop. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The importance of frequency response from EV in a 
regime where there is a high penetration of renewable energy 
generation is demonstrated in this paper using computer 
simulations. A single bus GB system was used for 
simulations. The system inertia was determined to reflect the 
high penetration of renewable energy sources. 
EVs were modeled using its demand curve over a day. 
Three charging modes namely, after-work, on-work and 
after-work, and delayed-night charging were used to 
construct the EV demand curves. During a low frequency 
event, the charging load was shed to provide frequency 
support. Simulations show that EV load has a significant 
contribution to reduce the frequency excursion. Highest 
effect was obtained with delayed nigh charging mode, if a 
frequency event occurs at mid night. At this time frequency 
drop can be reduced from 1.2% to 0.2%.
