Abstract— The increase in the number of elderly people and 
people with motor limitations takes along concerns to health 
professionals. A way of helping health professionals and the 
elderly may be through the development of systems that allow 
people to maintain their mobility regardless of age and health 
problems that may arise. This paper presents the studies 
carried out in the development of a mechatronic system that 
aims to promote physical activity in people with motor 
limitations. The proposed mechatronic system consists of a 
stationary bike, however its architecture is completely 
different, besides including a game that aims to increase the 
motivation of its users, in order to make physical activity and 
rehabilitation more enjoyable. Briefly, this paper presents a 
description of the proposed solution, followed by an approach 
to the study of the dimensions of the model taking into account 
the anthropometric data, so that the system can be used by as 
many people as possible. Afterwards, a detailed mechanical 
design of the structure was carried out, as well as the selection 
of the encoders, sensors and actuators that could be used in the 
model to obtain the inputs supplied by the user. 
Keywords- Serious Games; Rehabilitation; Modular Design;

 INTRODUCTION 
Aging and chronic diseases, such as obesity, Parkinson's, 
hypertension, arthritis, diabetes and even symptoms 
resulting from strokes are the main factors that force people 
to gradually lose their autonomy, making it more difficult 
for performing daily tasks such as bathing, dressing and 
walking. As many of the above diseases require 
rehabilitation, some researchers believe that active games 
(games involving physical activity) can increase adherence 
to treatment [1]. Over the years, several games have been 
developed with the purpose of promoting and improving the 
physical condition of the population in an effective and 
pleasant way. One of the first games of this type was Foot 
Craz in 1987 and since then several games have been 
released, however the device that more success had was the 
popular Wii console of Nintendo [2]. 
Nowadays, several equipment of this type is studied and 
commercialized, with special emphasis on games that use 
virtual reality through cameras, pressure platforms and 
simulators. Through the literature review, it was possible to 
find several studied and commercialized systems, among 
them: ReaKing, Physioland, Smartfloor, Physiosensing, 
Twall, GymTop USB, BOBO Balance and Trixter VR [3]. 
Recent research has integrated serious games as a 
valuable therapeutic tool in rehabilitation. In fact, virtual 
reality, especially in the form of serious games, combines 
therapeutic and recreational challenges. This strategy 
prevents boredom, making therapy less tiring and 
discouraging. Serious games can motivate patients to 
perform exercise and rehabilitation improving adherence to 
treatment. This ludic and challenging environment is the 
main aspect that differentiates virtual reality games from 
traditional physical rehabilitation programs [4]. 
Despite the wide variety of games on the market that aim 
to motivate the practice of physical exercise, it can be 
verified that there is a need to adapt them to allow their use 
by people with motor limitations. In fact, commercial games 
do not provide safety and comfort necessary for this people. 
To improve the practice of physical activity through this 
type of games by the elderly and/or physical impaired 
population, it is fundamental to develop rehabilitation 
games considering their safety and comfort [2].

In order to achieve the main goals of this paper, the 
respective organization is as follows: in Section 2, the 
proposed solution is presented; it is also presented some 
aspects used in the 3D modeling, giving main emphasis to 
the modular principle that is intended to be implemented 
and to the study of the dimensions of the model taking into 
account the anthropometric data, that aims the use of the 
model by the largest number of people. In Section 3, a 
detailed mechanical design of the structure of the model is 
presented, analyzing the forces involved in the course of its 
use; a numerical analysis of the structure is also performed 
in this section. In Section 4, it is presented the review of the 
sensors, encoders and actuators that could be used; it also 
includes the analysis of the characteristics of each 
component and a brief comparison between them. Finally, 
Section 5 presents the conclusions. 
II. 
PROPOSED SYSTEM 
The proposed model is presented in Figure 1 and consists 
of a stationary bike with a didactic component (simulation of 
a paramotor). This proposed 3D model resulted from an 
iterative process in which it was intended to choose the 
appropriated systems and to promote the desired versatility 
and functionality to the model. It was also intended that this 
3D model presented an equipment that: occupied the 
minimum space as possible; had a chair with adjustment 
capability; allowed to adjust the loads for different workouts 
and to provide the necessary comfort and safety to be used 
by people with motor limitations [4]. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. The proposed solution. 
A. Modules of the proposed model  
In order to occupy the smallest space possible, a modular 
system was adopted. In this way, it was easier to reduce the 
occupied space when it is fully assembled. Thus, it was 
decided to divide the system’s model into 3 modules - chair 
module, pedal module and main module. This division into 
modules, besides allowing the disassembly and division of 
the equipment, allows the adaptation to any chair, 
wheelchairs included [2]. 
B. Study of the dimensions of the model taking into 
account the anthropometric data 
This project was aimed at obtaining a 3D model whose 
dimensions were adequate to any person.  
First, it was necessary to define the length of the pedal 
crank arm. Research has reported that the ideal length of the 
crank arm can be between 145 and 180 mm [5] [6] [7]. Other 
studies in the same scope establish pedal performance 
analyzes according to the lengths of the pedal crank arms. A 
study carried out in these models shows that the difference is 
relatively small when using arms of lengths of 170 and 175 
mm (commonly used lengths). The difference can be 
significant in competitive sports [8]. As in the case of the 
model under study, that it is not a competition sport, the used 
length is 175 mm. 
This study of dimensions aims to allow anyone, in a 
wheelchair, to use the model, since the wheelchairs are not 
adjustable, contrary to what happens with the use of the chair 
module. For this it was also necessary to know the height of 
the seat of a wheelchair, which was considered 49.5 cm 
according to the researches carried out in [9]. Table I shows 
the dimensions for percentile 95 and 5 for both men and 
women to the following dimensions: buttock-heel length, 
seated vertical reach, vertical reach of apprehension and 
body depth maximum [9].

In order to collect the data presented above, it was 
considered that the dimensions of wheelchair’s users would 
be close to the dimensions of normal people, since the 
anthropometric study of people in wheelchairs is more 
difficult due to some variables, among them: the type of 
disability, the affected limbs or segments, the spread of 
paralysis, among others [9].  
From the collected data, it was possible to verify the 
dimensions of the model being studied, taking into account 
some adjustments. The buttock-heel length varies according 
to the footwear and knee flexion in the execution of the 
exercise, so it was decided to reduce 5 cm to this length. In 
the case study, it can be verified that the handle will be 
below the maximum vertical seated range, because this 
measure goes from the seat to the tip of the middle finger 
with the arm stretched, while the handle will be reached with 
the hand closed and the arms will not be completely 
stretched. For this reason, a tolerance of approximately 20 
cm this length is adopted. The vertical reach of apprehension 
is usually made with the individual without shoes, therefore a 
compensation of 3 cm will be performed in relation to this 
measure. Finally, it was considered that the horizontal 
perpendicular distance between the backrest of the

wheelchair and the handle should be approximately 1/3 of 
the maximum body depth (horizontal distance between the 
most forward point of the body and the point farther back). 
III. 
DETAILED MECHANICAL DESIGN 
The following computational tools were used: Autodesk 
Inventor 2017 and Autodesk Simulation Mechanical 2017 
(CAD-CAE).  
In order to be able to perform the simulation (CAE) 
stages, it was necessary to define the initial conditions and 
the boundaries.  
A. Study of the forces applied to the structural components 
of the model 
Figure 2 shows the free body diagram of one of the arms 
of the model structure. 
 
 
Figure 2. Free body diagram of one of the arms of the model (where F1 
represents the load exerted by the weights and F2 represents the force 
exerted by the user) 
For the arm completely stretched and the maximum 
load F1 (the maximum force F1 is half the maximum load 
of the weights, since this load is divided by two arms) the 
following values are considered: 
 
• 
L1 = 1,225 m 
• 
R = 0,35 m 
• 
F1max = 368 N  
 
M1 and F2 are calculated as follows: 
• 
Calculation of the torque produced by the force F1: 
 
 = F1 × R = 128,8 Nm 
() 
• 
Calculation of the force F2 that will be required to 
move the arm: 
 
 = F2 × L1 
() 
 
F2 = M1/L1 = 105,1 N 
() 
In the course of the game, the force exerted by the user 
will not be constant, since the direction of the force will 
change with the rotation of the arms. Figure 3 shows the 
variation of the position of the arms and their applied forces.

() 
Figure 4 represents a graph showing the variation of the 
force F3 with the variation of angle θ1.

B. Numerical analysis and simulation of the model 
structure 
In order to verify and study the structure and its behavior, 
quickly and effectively for different geometries, a numerical 
analysis was chosen. For the numerical analysis, a finite 
element analysis software was used (Autodesk Simulation 
Mechanical 2017). The following are presented the pre-
processing and the post-processing performed for the final 
form of the model. 
1) Pre-Processing 
With regard to the simulation, the first step corresponds 
to the selection of the type of analysis. In this case, a linear 
static analysis was performed, because the structure presents 
148

SENSORDEVICES 2018 : The Ninth International Conference on Sensor Device Technologies and Applications

linear behavioral materials, with the exception of the 
bushings, which, in this case, was neglected. 
After defining the type of analysis, the model was 
discretized (mesh generation). The mesh initially presented 
was coarse generated, which allowed the first simulation to 
be faster and to identify the locations of the most critical 
zones. After the creation of the mesh, the boundary 
conditions were considered. In this case, it is intended a 
static model, so it was considered that the base of the 
structure was embedded with no rotation of the arms. 
Finally, the materials (AISI 1050 and AISI 304 [2]), the 
loads and the contacts were defined. In the case of loads, the 
forces previously obtained (Section III.A) were used for the 
situation where L1 = 1,225 m, F1 = 368 N and F2 = 105 N 
for the initial position. In the case of joints, it was 
considered that all the pieces were bonded. Figure 5 shows 
the pre-processing representation of the structure model.

2) Post Processing 
After the processing step - Solver execution - the results 
of the maximum displacements and the installed stress were 
obtained and verified. Figure 6 presents the maximum 
displacement, whereas Figure 7 presents the stress analysis 
by the criterion of Von Mises. 
 
 
 
Figure 6.  Displacement magnitude results. 
 
 
Figure 7. Stress Von Mises results.  
 
From the obtained results, it can be verified that the 
maximum displacement verified by the software was 3,90 
mm. This value can be considered acceptable for the 
structure. Another important verified aspect was the 
maximum analyzed stress, in the structure, that presented a 
value of 40,16 MPa. In addition to these results, a mesh 
refinement was also carried out in the zone of higher 
tension. This refinement presented a result of around 42 
MPa for the maximum tension. Comparing the maximum 
installed tension with the yielding tension of the material 
(415 MPa) it can be stated that the material is adequate for 
the required loads. 
IV. 
SELECTION OF SENSORS 
In order to create the game, it is necessary to acquire 
some inputs: detection of the pedal velocity and detection of 
the position of the arms of the structure. To obtain this data, 
it is necessary to use encoders and sensors to measure the 
position and velocity. In the following section, there are 
presented the encoders and sensors that will be used for the 
detection of the pedal speed and the position of the arms of 
the structure. 
A. Detection of position of the structure arms and the 
pedal speed  
For the detection of the position of the arms of the 
structure, incremental rotary encoders will be used. The 
incremental encoders are simpler and low-cost when 
compared to the absolute encoder. This type of encoder 
generates only pulses and does not have a different 
combination for each position. In this way, they are 
manufactured with a quantity of pulses per revolution. The 
higher the number of pulses per revolution, the higher the 
encoder resolution. The disadvantage of this type of encoder 
is in the reading of its data, because as it operates by pulses, 
the reading of a certain positioning needs an initial 
reference.  
For the detection of the pedal speed it will be used a 
Reed Switch sensor. The Reed sensors are used as highly 
effective speed sensors in low speed applications (up to 
1000 rpm). A Reed sensor consists of a switch having two 
ferromagnetic blades contained within a hermetically sealed 
tubular glass housing. Generally, the gas inside the glass is 
nitrogen that serves to eliminate the presence of oxygen and 
to ensure that the contacts do not oxidize. Reed switches are 
usually activated by a permanent 
magnet 
or an 
electromagnet. This type of sensor allows solutions for 
detection of proximity, speed, flow, among others. In this 
way, these sensors are versatile possessing different utilities 
and forms [10]. 
B. Selection of encoder for the rotation of the arms of the 
structure 
The following are encoders that can be used in the case 
under study

1) Rotary Encoder 200 P/R (YUMO) 
Figure 8 presents an encoder with 200 pulses per 
revolution. This encoder produces electrical pulses that can 
be interpreted using a microcontroller to find the position of 
the input shaft. This allows the addiction of a feedback to 
the control system. Encoders of this type are often used in 
balancing robots. The encoder comes with a set screw 
coupling that will connect to any 4mm shaft [11]. Table II 
shows the specifications of the encoder 200 P/R.

Figure 9 presents an encoder with 1024 pulse per rotation; 
this encoder has an output gray code which can be 
interpreted using a microcontroller and find out how and in 
which direction the shaft is turning. This allows  to add 
feedback to the control system. Encoders of this kind are 
often used in balancing robots and dead reckoning 
navigation but they can also be used as a precise input knob 
[12]. Table III shows the specifications of the encoder 1024 
P/R.

3) Encoders comparison 
By the analysis of the two encoders presented it can be 
verified that any of them could be used, however, as the 
1024 P/R rotary encoder presents superior resolution it will 
give more accurate results. 
C. Selection of encoder for the detection of the pedal speed 
In the following, there are presented sensors and 
actuators that can be used in the model being studied. 
1) 59150 Flange Mount Sensor and 57150 Actuator 
Figure 10 presents a flange mounting reed sensor 
(28.57mm x 19.05mm x 6.35mm) with a choice of normally 
open, normally open high voltage, normally closed or 
changeover contacts. The design of this sensor enables screw 
or adhesive mounting and the wires exit from top right-hand 
side. It is also available with left hand exit (59145 Series). It 
is capable of switching up to 265Vac/300Vdc at 10VA. The 
59150 functions best with the matching actuator 57150-000 
[13].

3) Switch Reed sensors comparison 
One of the most important factors for the selection of a 
reed sensor and its actuator is the sensitivity. The sensitivity 
of the switch is the amount of magnetic field that is required 
to actuate the contact into an open or closed mode (Most 
reed switches have a sensitivity range of 10–30 AT, where 
10 AT is more sensitive than 30 AT) 
A check that can be made in terms of sensitivity is that for 
the same variations of sensitivity the distance in the set 
59150 Flange Mount Sensor and 57150 Actuator is higher. 
In addition to the sensitivity, the ease of assembly and 
adjustment makes the set 59150 Flange Mount Sensor and 
57150 Actuator more advantageous. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
With this work it was verified the evolution and growth 
of the serious games over the years, besides it was verified 
that it is necessary to adapt and create new equipment so 
that they can be used in physiotherapy and rehabilitation 
areas. Thus, the development of a mechatronic system was 
presented, whose main advantages are: being motivating, 
adjustable, appealing, comfortable and safe.  
The system was divided into modules and a study of the 
dimensions of the model was carried out considering the 
anthropometric data. A detailed mechanical design study 
was also conducted. 
Finally, it was analyzed the sensors and actuators in the 
market that could be implemented in the system, among 
them: Rotary Encoder 200 P / R (YUMO), Rotary encoder 
1024 P / R (YUMO), 59150 Flange Mount Sensor, 57150 
Actuator, 59025 Firecracker Reed Sensor and 57025 
Actuator. 
Future work may include: the development of the game 
scenario, the construction of a prototype for validation and 
the implementation of the studies performed.
