Abstract— Health is a fundamental feature of human beings.
Health is not just an interaction with health providers in order
to arrive at a diagnosis and a treatment process. Health is a
summation of several elements, including life style, food habits,
confidence, and emotional interactions with others. While the
traditional I-Health (health of an isolated individual) model
has its limitations, We-Health (Community based informed
health) has tremendous potential due to its strength and
spread. The thought of one’s unhealthiness leads to physical
and psychological detriment. Individuals throughout the world
have varied heights, complexions, personalities, beliefs, and
diverse ways of living. In the same way, their health and vital
numbers are relative to their personal, physical, psychological,
and
environmental
characteristics.
Blessed
health
is
an
initiative
to
bring
the
awareness
of
‘Informed
Health’,
referring to the relative health of individuals.
Keywords – Blessed; Informed; Health; Community; We-
Health.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Blessed health is a dynamic model of health, where the
health of communities is targeted, instead of individualized
health assessments. Health becomes a dynamic practice in
this “We-Health” model, compared to that of a static “I-
Health” model. This new paradigm will effectively combat
the current issues of depression, mental health, drug
dependency, drug addiction, and disease management solely
by lifelong medications.
II.
CURRENT SCENARIO- “I HEALTH”
The current health scenario is a static model, where
individuals get their numbers checked up. These numbers
include blood pressure, cholesterol, and other values, which
are then compared against national averages and standards.
Individual treatments and prescriptions proceed, resulting in
the perceived health of an individual. In most cases, health
care providers are under pressure to map the deviations in
the numbers to some health condition, resulting in a
mandatory prescription of medications. The medications
may result in adverse drug reactions [1].
III.
“I-HEALTH” PARADIGM
The current “I-Health” paradigm depicted in Fig 1, can be
explained as follows:
1.
Input – The paradigm begins with an individual’s health
check-up and recording of associated numbers, such as
vitals, counts, etc.
2.
Process
–
Next,
numbers
are
compared
to
the
“standard” or “average” data. This leads to stress and
fear in the patient of possible health conditions. Then,
“common” or “standard” procedures/treatments ensue.
3.
Output/ Result – “I-Health” which is the perceived
health of an individual, resulting in a lack of hope in
becoming disease-free within their life time. Individuals
feel
pressured
to
continue
managing
diseases
or
medical conditions solely through prescription drugs.

CHALLENGES IN “I-HEALTH”
Comparison
of
an
individual’s
health
numbers
to
standards will result in erroneous conclusions, since the
comparison
is
not
holistic.
An
individual’s
medical
condition is assessed by symptoms, causes, medical history,
and hereditary aspects at the time of assessment. This will
not take into consideration an individual’s physical state,
psychological state, lifestyle, and environment. This kind of
assessment
will
result
in
a
diagnosis,
based
on
an
approximation, due to the deviation from the “norm”.
Sometimes, in this model, individuals aren’t fully aware of
all the possible treatment options and therefore obligated to
continue the ongoing treatment.
V.
WHY “BLESSED HEALTH”- A DYNAMIC
MODEL IS PREFERRED
Health
is
a
universal
cause.
Health
is
everyone’s
responsibility and a fundamental right. Health is not just the
right of only affluent populations. It is a community effort
[2]. Though some work has been done in this area, most of

it relates to communication aspects of health rather than
community-based health [3]. This community-based health
is a preferred dynamic model, called “Blessed Health”
which is a paradigm shift from “I-Health”, and is a journey
towards “We-Health”.
VI.
“WE-HEALTH” SCENARIO
The proposed “We-Health” paradigm depicted in Fig 2
can be explained as follows:
1.
Input – In this model, individual’s health assessment is
mapped to the health conditions of the individual. Here,
symptoms are approached in a holistic way considering
the physical, psychological, lifestyle and environmental
factors.
Informed
health
conditions
of
family,
community and surroundings help to interpret health
conditions in the right way without fear of numbers.
Here every effort is made to avoid intrusions, negative
interpretations, and unnecessary engagement. Positivity
about individual’s current health condition is a natural
blessing here.
2.
Process – Health is nature’s gift. Inclination towards
health does not cause fear or stress and it creates a
strength climate. Strength brings confidence. As a
result,
one
will
naturally
be
motivated
towards
spreading the positive health around.
3.
Output/ Result – The result of a cohesive process is a
healthy community consisting of the individual, one’s
family,
extended
family,
friends,
and
the
whole
surrounding
ecosystem.
The
“Spread”
includes
nurturing, mentoring and adapting ways, to analyze and
improve health of everyone in the ecosystem.
Figure 2. We-Health Paradigm
Viewing health as a dynamic model promotes operational
health. In this model, health is everyone’s moral and
practical responsibility, that is shared amongst communities.
A simple protocol can be adopted to achieve this.
1.
Owning one’s health.
2.
Being accountable.
3.
Being mindful.
4.
Knowing one’s food.
5.
Know how food comes to one’s plate. One’s food
plate should not be a detriment to another life in the
ecosystem [4].
6.
Engage and motivate community.
7.
Educate self and surroundings.
8.
Live cohesively with the environment to create a
healthy ecosystem.

ANCIENT SUCCESSFUL MODELS OF COMMUNITY
HEALTH (WE-HEATH)
There are numerous references in Ayurveda, a system of
medicine practiced by ancient Indians emphasizing the
importance of community-based health.
An excerpt from these ancient texts, refers to health as
collaborative effort of teamwork, strength, blessing, and
peace, as described below: “One shall strive to protect one’s
own body, mind, and energies. Then one shall protect and
care for their families, communities and surroundings. Then
one shall protect the totality of ecosystem”.
In the ancient Sanskrit texts, health is perceived as the
combination of 5 layers of health of an Individual. The
medicines that one takes into the body only can cure one-
fifth of the totality of health, which is at the physical level.
To understand a symptom and to have blessed health, one
should work on acquiring all the 5 layers of health.
The five layers of health are described as follows: Every
human being has 5 sheaths or layers for blessed health that
can contribute to total or holistic health. Those layers are:
1.
“Physical” health, which is related to the physical
body nourishing with food and water.
2.
“Breathing” health, which is the life force related to
breathing and stress preventing techniques.
3.
“Mind” health, which cultivates the inner and outer
energies related mental and emotional aspects.
4.
“Intellectual” health, which is related to one’s own
intellect,
through
logic,
decisioning,
thinking,
interacting, and balancing.
5.
“Blessed” health, which is a totality of health where
one is ready to extend help to others in the
community and achieve strength and spread.
These five layers of health achieved with the
following simple protocol:
1.
Eat plant-based food, feel well, and work well.
2.
Control your breath and enhance vital energies with
good habits and work ethics, which in turn reduces
stress.
3.
Clear your mind
with meditation and positive
interactions
to
channel
mental
and
emotional
energies for positive health and progress.
4.
Acquire knowledge, interact with community, and
make informed decisions with mindfulness.
5.
Become a vital leader in spreading health and
happiness.

CONCLUSION
Health in general is perceived and understood like an
ancient story of elephant and 5 blind men. Once five blind
men approached an elephant for the first time and wanted to
figure out what “the object” is. Each blind man touched a
different part of the elephant and perceived it differently.
The first one thought it to be a rope by touching the tail. The
second one perceived it to be a mountain by touching the
body of the elephant. The next one thought it to be a stick
by feeling the tusk. Yet another one thought it to be a pillar,
and so on. This is known as the theory of blindfold
predictions. All of them may have different perceptions, but
the truth is beyond perceptions. In a comparable way, one
should understand the concept of health in its totality and
essence. Assessing health at physical level only can
contribute to one fifth of the total of health.
In “We-Health” model, health is a summed-up equation
of health at all levels including the physical, life-force,
mind, intellectual, and interactional. All of it adds up to the
totality of health referred to in this article as “We-Health” or
“Blessed Health”. In this model, there is no room for
depression and hence other prevalent common mental health
issues can be prevented.
