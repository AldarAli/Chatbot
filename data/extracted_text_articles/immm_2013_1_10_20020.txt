Abstract—In this paper, we describe a method for analyzing a
collection of patents in order to help prior art candidate search in
an interactive and graphical way. The method relies on the use of
two data mining methods: hierarchical agglomerative clustering
and principal component analysis, which are applied successively.
The correlation between the application patent and the other
patents is a good indicator to help decide the classes of patents
to look at.

I. INTRODUCTION
Patents correspond to one type of intellectual property right
that plays an important role in innovation and in the economy.
Patent retrieval is crucial considering the amount of existing
information and economic issues associated with patents.
The number of patents available make mandatory to have
effective and efﬁcient ways of searching and browsing them.
For example, Thomson Scientiﬁc provides the Derwent World
Patents Index R⃝ , which ”contains over 21.85 million patent
families covering more than 45.2 million patent documents,
with coverage from over 47 worldwide patent authorities” [1].
Additionally, when applying for a new patent, prior art should
be veriﬁed both by the applicant, to ﬁll in the application,
and by the certiﬁer to analyze the application. 1.98 million
applications were ﬁled in worldwide in 2011 according to
the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) [2].
Verifying prior art is thus crucial and has been investigated
in the relevant literature. International evaluation forums also
deﬁne tasks to evaluate prior art search.
The Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum Initia-
tive (CLEF), formerly known as Cross-Language Evaluation
Forum, launched the Intellectual Property track (CLEF-IP) in
2009 to investigate Information Retrieval (IR) techniques for
patent retrieval. In 2011, CLEF-IP speciﬁcally focuses on prior
art candidate search. The Text REtrieval Conference Chemical
Track 2011 (TREC-CHEM 2011) also considers prior art
candidate search [3]. Prior art search is not the only task
evaluation forums investigates, there are many information
retrieval and analysis tasks and other challenges related to
patents [4], [5]. However, in this paper, we will focus on this
task.
Prior art candidate search aims at querying and retrieving
the patents in order to discover any knowledge existing prior to
the analyzed patent application [6]. The underlying objective
that is pursued is to ﬁnd patents, which can invalidate a given
patent application. Most of the approaches to this task use
standard information retrieval (IR) processes [7], [8].
Results are evaluated using standard IR measures that con-
sider the rate of relevant documents that have been retrieved
and the rate of retrieved documents that are relevant. A relevant
document in the case of prior art candidate search is a patent
that is evaluated as potentially invalidating the current patent
application. More speciﬁcally, evaluation measures such as
Mean Average Precision (MAP), recall, precision, recall at 100
(when 100 retrieved documents are considered) and precision
at 100 have been used.
In this paper, we make post evaluation analysis. More
speciﬁcally, this study aims at analyzing patents knowing the
relevance judgments. We show that considering patent title
and patent abstract is complementary. We also show that it
is possible to iteratively reduce the number of patents to be
analyzed while keeping a high level of recall. Patent analysis is
done using clustering and factorial analysis methods. The anal-
ysis results in a graphical visualization the user can interact
with. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
presents related works regarding prior art search, and browsing
and clustering document collections. Section III describes the
way patents are indexed and the resulting representations to be
analyzed. Section IV presents the methodology of analysis and
Section V the results of the patent analysis. Finally, Section VI
discusses the results and concludes this paper.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Prior art candidate search
Prior art candidate search has been studied in CLEF-IP
as ﬁnding ”patent documents that are likely to constitute
prior art to a given patent application” [9]. Figures 1 and 2
show an application patent, and a previous patent potentially
invalidating the application.
The results obtained in the evaluation campaign show that the
task is quite hard. For example, the best run in 2010 obtained
a MAP of about 0.26 [7].
Mainly, standard IR methods have been used in the literature
to solve this task. Madgy et al. [10] have used standard
information retrieval techniques (stop word removal, stemming

sion of 0.1216, a recall at 100 of 0.3036 and precision at 100 of
about 0.228. They used the Indri system that ranks the results
using a language model and inferred networks. Becks et al.
[11] used the Okapi system and BM25 weighting. Most of the
other participants also used either the Lemur/Indri system or
the Apache/Lucene system. However, these approaches do not
allow browsing and interactive visualization.
B. Browsing and clustering document sets
One frequently cited work regarding document browsing is
Scatter/Gather [12]. The principle developed in this approach
is an interactive reﬁnement of the target document set. From
an initial clustering of a document collection in k-clustering,
the users select the clusters they are interested in; then, the
system re-clusters this subset of documents, and so on.
Many works have investigated search result clustering either
to re-rank results initially retrieved by a search engine or to
group the results and provide users with clusters of documents
they can choose [13].
Classiﬁcation in the context of patents is generally con-
cerned with classifying patents using the International Patent
Classication (IPC) codes or other classiﬁcation schema. How-
ever, some interesting work has been conducted in this context
for patent mapping. Kim et al. [14] for example cluster patent
document contents using k-means. From the clustering results,
they extract a semantic network that helps having an overview
of the patent subset. Sharma [15] uses k-means clustering
algorithms in order to structure a patent sub-collection. Jun et
al. [16] uses patent clustering in order to predict technology

trends. Djean and Mothe [17] also presents various visual
clustering methods and applications.
Our work also uses document clustering and interactive
reﬁnement of clusters. More speciﬁcally, we cluster patents
according to their content, which is automatically extracted.
In addition, our work studies the effects of the clustering
parameters on the results.
III. PATENT REPRESENTATION FOR TEXT ANALYSIS
Since the collection is composed of more than three million
patents, we decided to ﬁrst select a sub-part of these patents,
the ones that are more likely to be prior art candidates for
each topic. To select this subset of patents, we use a standard
information retrieval process. Then, we built a representation
that ﬁts the type of analysis we intend to investigate. We
generate a patent representation that keeps both the section
part from which each term occurs and the language in which
it is used. The collection and these two steps are described in
this section.
A. Collection
The collection we used is the one used in CLEF-IP forum
2011 [18]. It consists of more than three million patent
documents from European Patent Ofﬁce sources with contents
in French, German and English. Several documents can be
related to the same patent and correspond to versions (e.g.
application phase and granted patent). The documents contain
bibliographic data, a title, an abstract, a description, and
claims. The patent title is provided in three languages (English,
German and French). For some of the patents, the abstract is
also provided in the three languages, for others in one of the
languages only. The description and claims are in one language
only.

Topics correspond to patents and thus have the same struc-
ture. In this study, we used the 1000 ofﬁcial topics, to which
are associated the patents relevant to the task. Relevance
judgements are produced automatically, using patent citations
from seed patents.
B. First patent selection
To make a ﬁrst targeted sub-collection for each topic, we
used the Terrier system [19]. We built an index considering
the English titles and English abstracts. We used a stop-word
list and Porter’s stemmer and the default Terrier parameters.
Then, from a topic, we query the index and retrieve, at most,
the 1000 ﬁrst patents. Those patents are then indexed more
precisely.
C. Patent indexing and representation
Since patents are multilingual, or to be more precise, a
language is associated to each patent’s parts, we built three
indexes, one per language for the patents from the targeted
subset (in reality we build those indexes for the entire corpus
once). In the English index, we consider the English patent
parts only; in the German index, we consider the German parts
only, and so on. This solution allowed us to use appropriate
stop-word list and stemmer.
Each indexing term was associated with the patent part it
comes from, the associated language and its frequency and
becomes a variable that represents the patent (in the statistical
sense). For example, the word ”test”, found in the abstract in
English, will be counted in the variable named A EN test and
its frequency will be kept. If it occurs in the French title too,
a second variable will be deﬁned named T FR test.
The indexing result can be deﬁned as a matrix in which
lines correspond to patents (individuals) observed according
to the variables (indexing terms as deﬁned previously) which
are the columns of the matrix. The values inside the matrix
are the term frequencies in the various parts and languages.
This representation allows us to easily fuse lines or columns.
Fusing lines is mandatory to fuse the various patent versions
into a single one (in that case we use the mean of the frequency
in each version to calculate the new term frequency). Fusing
columns is useful when one wants to calculate the frequency
of a term, independently to which patent parts it occurs.
IV. ANALYSING PRIOR ART
Prior art candidate search aims at ﬁnding patents related to
the topic. It can be considered as a search problem or as a
clustering problem. In this study, we chose the latter solution.
In addition, the representation we chose is highly dimensional.
Factorial analysis is a class of methods that aims at reducing
the dimension of data whilst keeping its structure. We use
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in this study.
A. Analysing method
1) Clustering method: We chose to consider the ascending
agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) to group similar
patents. Indeed, the target number of clusters is unknown.
Unlike k-means or other methods, AHC does not require
specifying the desired number of clusters. Rather, the number
of clusters is chosen by looking at the graph on the decay of
the node heights.
The AHC requires choosing the aggregation measure and
the dissimilarity measure to use. The best aggregation measure
is the Ward measure as this method makes homogeneous
clusters. We use this method. With regard to the dissimilarity
measure, we could use the Euclidean distance (which is
the most commonly used) or other distances such as the
Minkowski distance (for which the power parameter p as to
be chosen) or the Manhattan distance, which are the most
popular. The Manhattan distance corresponds to the norm
1, this distance will select too many patents and not the
most correlated. We compared the Euclidean distance and
the Minkowski distance using p=1/2 and kept the latter (the
detailed results are not presented in this paper).
2) Dimension reduction: PCA is a very popular method in
multidimensional statistical analysis. It makes it possible to
produce graphical representations of the rows or the columns
of the considered matrix, and does so in a reduced dimension
space. The method is deﬁned so that the dispersion obtained
in this reduced dimension space is the largest (Jolliffe, 2002
[20]; Mardia et al., 1979 [21]). The aim of PCA is to replace
a p-dimensional observation by a q linear combination of the
variables, where q (the dimension of the reduced space) is
much smaller than p. The linear combination deﬁned by PCA
are the eigenvectors related to the ﬁrst q greatest eigenvalues.
B. Methodology
We promote a way to browse the sub-collection of patents
in order to better detect prior art candidate, which is based on
clustering and PCA. The method we suggest is iterative, as
shown in Figure 3. First, we used a PCA in order to plot
the patents and look for groups and dispersion of patents.
Then, we cluster the patents in order to reﬁne the target set
of patents: the cluster containing the topic is selected. Finally,
we consider the correlations between the query and the patents
belonging to the cluster selected at the previous stage in order
to evaluate the number of relevant patents this method selects.
This methodology is applied ﬁrst to patents represented by
titles and abstracts, then to titles only and ﬁnally to abstracts
only.
V. RESULTS
The results we present in this section are based on the topic
EP-1236420-A1 from the corpus. The experiments have been
conduced on a single query topic, which is not corresponding
to the CLEF-IP task. The results we are presenting here
should be considered as preliminary results.
When considering the EP-1236420-A1 topic, there are
11 relevant patents associated to this topic identiﬁed as
follows: EP0663161, EP0728427, EP0792603, EP0808587,
EP0811336,
EP0811337,
EP0832580,
EP0842620,
EP0895734, EP1020136, EP1177745. In order to simplify
the writing, we will refer to the these patents by using the

A. English words from titles and abstracts
Figure 4 shows the representation of the patents after the
ﬁrst PCA. The relevant documents and the query are repre-
sented in blue, and the query is represented by the number 731.
We can see three groups of patents: one in the top-left, one in
the top-right and the other in the center. The query is between
these three groups; from this visualization, it is difﬁcult to
know which group it belongs to. This can be explained by the
fact that all these patents belong to the sub-collection related
to the query 731. Moreover, we cannot identify the number of
patents because the number of individuals is very large. But
we can observe a ”blue” group which means that the relevant
documents are close to the query. However, this graph is not
very relevant to our analysis.
We will now focus on the results of the clustering which

Patent factor map (PCA) based on titles and abstracts on a reduce

is an AHC as depicted in Section IV-A1. Figure 5 shows the
graph of heights according to the number of clusters.
At this stage, we would like to obtain a sufﬁcient number of
patents in each cluster, in order to ﬁnd the maximum of prior
art candidates. According to Figure 2, a relevant pruning is 5
as the number of clusters. When analyzing the patent clusters,
the query is in a cluster formed by 276 patents. Among these
patents, we found the relevant patents labelled A, C, D, G, H,
I, J and K, which means 8 out of 11.
We apply PCA on the topic cluster. Figure 6 shows the
representation of the 276 patents after PCA. The query and the
relevant patents are in blue; we can see one group in the center.
Patents from this cluster are much related to the query. We
looked to the correlations between the query and the patents
belonging to the query cluster. The results are presented in
the Table I. The threshold should be chosen according to
the number of prior art candidates we would like to have.
We can see, for example, that 0.25 is a good compromise to
have a sufﬁcient number of prior art candidates (the four most

B. English words from titles only
In this section, we consider the English words from the
title only and reproduce the same analysis: ﬁrst PCA, then a
clustering on the patents and ﬁnally looking at the correlations
between the query and the patents belonging to that cluster.
In Figure 7, three distinct groups of patents can be observed,
as well as three isolated patents. Following the method we
promote, we apply clustering using AHC. The best pruning is
obtained when considering 4 clusters.
The topic cluster is composed of 101 patents; it contains
the relevant patents: A, B, G, H, I, K. There are 6 relevant
patents out of 11. Figure 5 represents the patents after PCA
was applied to the topic cluster. We can see a group of patents
very close to the topic, for example the patents 359, 182, 108,
253.
Finally, we looked to the correlations between the query
and the patents belonging to the query cluster. The results are
presented in the Table II.
C. English words from abstracts only
The analysis is the same as previously, except that it is
applied to patent abstracts only. The PCA on the sub-collection
is presented in Figure 8.
We can see three groups of patents, as it was the case when
considering the English words from titles and abstracts: one

The query is always between these three groups so from
this visualization, it is not possible to know which group it
belongs to, but we still have a ”blue” group, this means that
the relevant patents are highly correlated to the query.
When applying AHC, the best pruning is obtained when
considering 4 clusters. The topic is in a cluster formed by 348
patents and containing the relevant patents B, E, F.
We apply a PCA on this cluster, and represent the individ-
uals in Figure 9.

The query is in the center of the group. Some patents around
the group are not relevant to the query. We have lost much
more relevant patents using the abstract only for clustering
than when using the titles only.
When looking at the correlations between the query and the
patents belonging to the query cluster we found the results
presented in Table III.
VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The results we obtained when either considering titles
and abstracts or titles or abstracts only are interesting in
various ways. If we consider one particular threshold for the
correlation between patents and the topic patent, patents that
are obtained in the topic cluster are noticeably quite different
depending on the patent part that is analyzed. Table IV presents
the results for a correlation threshold of 0.25. One can see
that the results obtained using title only and abstract only are
disjointed. Moreover, the 4 most invalidating patents (in bold
in Table IV) are retrieved and, in the case of this topic, title
only is enough to ﬁnd out them.
These results have been obtained using a single query
patent. The process we use is iterative and interactive ; for
this reason it could be difﬁcult to compare to other methods.
However, we could compare the mean average precision (or
other performance measure) we obtain using our method with
the values obtained by the CLEF-IP participants. That will be
done in future work.
In this paper, we have shown that analysis methods can be
used in an interactive way to visualize patents. This method
can be used to browse a patent collection when searching for
prior art candidate in an original way. As future work, we
will study multilingual aspects. We think that clustering and
factorial analysis could help in grouping together patents that
are preliminary written in different languages thanks to the
shared terms in the titles and abstracts.
