Abstract—The Ionosphere is the region from 80 to 1000 km
altitude above the Earth and it contains free electrons and ions
that disturb the electromagnetic waves when the waves pass
through it. The larger electrons density in the Ionosphere
disturbs the GPS (Global Position System) signal that passes
through it. The Ionosphere is a variable medium and its
frequency behaviour cannot be predicted accurately. One issue
arises because the Ionosphere near the equatorial region causes
more electromagnetic signal errors compared to the North and
South Poles. In this article, it has been proved that the GPS
signals transmitted in equatorial regions are more refracted
than the ones crossing the Ionosphere in the North and South
Poles regions. The refraction index will decrease as the electron
density increases. This subject is important, because if, for
instance, a satellite is not working in military events, then there
is an alternative communication solution, which employs
Ionosphere
as
a
reflector
for
long-distance
terrestrial
communication around the world. The free electrons in the
Ionosphere create a high conductivity layer, which could be
used as a perfect reflector for short waves in long-distance
terrestrial communication. Two models, namely IRI (The
International Reference Ionosphere)-Plas 2017 model and
VOACAP model (The Voice of America Coverage Analysis
Program), have been used in our simulations. These models
were used to evaluate the quality of the Ionosphere in different
regions
for
reflecting
shortwaves
frequencies
and
the
perturbations for GPS signals. The selected regions for the
simulations were Iraq, Romania, and Ukraine. The conclusion
was that the Ionosphere efficiency of reflecting frequencies for
Iraq region is better than the one for Romania and Ukraine
regions.
Keywords- IRI-Plas 2017; VOACAP; Refraction index.

INTRODUCTION
The Ionosphere is the region between 80km to 1000km of
the Earth’s atmosphere. The attentiveness in this region of
free electrons is so great that it affects radio waves [1]. The
Ionosphere was discovered when it was detected that radio
waves can transmit over great spaces and therefore one then
must adopt the existence of an electrically conductive layer
in the upper atmosphere which could reflect the waves
[2][3]. The electrically conductive region extends from about
50km to 500km above the ground and the106 m3 at 50km to
a maximum of 1012 particles per m3 at 250-300 km [3][4].
The challenges of our work were the mathematical equations
that cover the derivatives of these equations compatible with
the three regions studied in this paper: Iraq, Romania and
Ukraine. We had chosen five parameters together: phase and
group velocity, plasma frequency, and error distance for the
first and second order. All these parameters together prove
that the equatorial region has an influence on the GPS signal
more than other places on Earth, like the North Pole. In this
paper, we have focused on evaluating the disturbances of the
lower and upper regions of the Ionosphere from 80km to
1000km. Section II explains the state of art of this paper. In
Section III, the related work is presented. In Section IV, the
adopted model is described. Section V presents the effects of
Ionosphere
on
the
microwave
signal
with
extended
numerical examples in Section VI, including approaches for
Ionosphere disturbances. The simulation and analysis of the
refraction index of the GPS signal are illustrated in Section
VII. Finally, Section VIII concludes and hints to future work.
II.
STATE OF ART
In [5], the distance error of GPS signal that propagates
through the Ionosphere at equatorial is computed by using
total electron content (TEC) which disturbs the radio wave
propagation. In [6], two models, IRI-Plas 2017 and NeQuick,
are used for computing the discrepancies of the Ionosphere.
Here, the Ionosphere disturbance at high latitudes was
investigated. The output parameters of these models are
electron density and total electron content. The electron
density
is
like
TEC
which
disturb
the
radio
wave
propagation. In our paper, we used IRI-Plas 2017 model and
we computed the refraction index that represents the strength
of the signal in the Ionosphere medium depending on the
electron density, for both Iraq and Romania regions. This
parameter could be used as an indicator of the reflection
capabilities of Ionosphere for long distance communications.
VOACAP
model
was
used
by
us
provided
by
free
professional high-frequency (HF) propagation prediction
software
to
determine
the
quality
for
long
distance
communications, using the Ionosphere as a reflector [7]. This
model is based on frequency. The parameter frequency is
used to evaluate the Ionosphere disturbance at low and high
latitudes by using VOACAP model. The range of reflected
frequencies
that
can
be
used
for
long
distance
communication provided by VOACAP online model gives
an indicator about Ionosphere capacity to reflect the
communication signals.

VOACAP provides the observer with more accurate
results than IRI-Plas 2017 and NeQuick models, determining
the
highest
usable
frequency
for
the
long-distance
communications, using the Ionosphere as a reflector.

RELATED WORK
In Gsponer [8] showed that Maxwell equations can be
used for many applications in Ionosphere for electron
density, or another component in the atom that constitutes
the plasma frequency. In M. K. Mardan and K. A. Hadi [3]
used Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, to test the Ionosphere
features, like the energy of an electron. In this paper, the
group
velocity of the
signal
that gives the accurate
description of the medium of the disturbance of Ionosphere
at Iraq space and Romania space was computed. By using
VOACAP as in Fig. 1, several different latitudes have been
chosen and compared from the point of view of real plasma
frequency, instead of electron density. The VOACAP model
provides us with the best frequencies reflected
from
Ionosphere
which
have
good
SNR.
Based
on
these
frequencies, it is possible to determine the Ionosphere
disturbance can be evaluated.

THE APPLETON–HARTREE EQUATION
IRI-Plas 2017 model has been used in the Appleton–Hartree
equation (13). This is a general formula for the Appleton–
Hartree equation that comprises all the effects in Ionosphere
that could happen and affect the electrometric signal and
may disturb the transmission [9].

For signals with frequencies ω >> ωP (and hence ω

These parameters ܽଵ, ܽଶ, ܽ݊݀ ܽଷ will determine the error
distance for all electromagnetic waves that propagate in the
Ionosphere. In this paper it has been used GPS signals. The
GPS signals are in microwaves frequencies. These waves
usually refract tens of meters in the ionosphere. But
shortwaves will be refract hundreds of meters. The free
electrons and ions are responsible of these error distance and
especially the free electrons because they are lighter than
ions. This error distance is significant in the Equatorial
region because they highly concentrated there. The most
important parameters is a1 because it depends mainly on the
electron density and no other factor. The second parameter
depends on magnetic field that is very weak in Equatorial
regions and mid-latitudes. But in the Poles the magnetic field
is very large. This work is specifically employed for low
latitudes that comprises Iraq region and mid latitude that
comprises Romania and Ukraine.

The curves in Fig.2 and Fig.3 represent all the hours in
one day. These results have shown higher refraction index
for Romania, compared to the Iraqi region. Higher refraction
index means low perturbations in the Ionosphere region. It is
definitely clear that Iraq region is a better place for reflecting
higher frequency, by using Ionosphere as a reflector. The
Romanian region is a better place for GPS signal, penetrating
the Ionosphere with low error-distance.

In this section, the refraction index is determined by
simulations using a GPS signal. This refraction index shows
the disturbance of Ionosphere. Higher disturbance means
good reflection medium for higher frequencies. This results
could be used as an estimate for the quality of the signal for
long communications around the world, using reflection on
Ionosphere.
B.
The simulations and analyses for Iraq, Romania and
Ukraine regions by using VOACAP model.
In this section, a VOACAP model is used to predict the
high-frequency
propagation
in
communications,
using
Ionosphere as a reflector. The quality of the Ionosphere
space reflection was evaluated for two scenarios. One
scenario assumed a long communication channel between
Iraq
and
Romania,
and
the
second
scenario
used
a
communication between Romania and Ukraine, which takes
place at higher latitude. The results obtained for the
reflection quality on Ionosphere were correlated with the
results provided by the IRI- Plas 2017 model on refraction
index and electron density.
By using online data of VOACAP model in 2018, the
highest
usable
frequency
for
the
communication
link
between Iraq and Romania was obtained. The results are
presented in Fig. 6; the three curves represent the best signals
with the highest SNR, maintained for at least half a day. The
results demonstrate that the highest usable frequency reached
up to 20 MHz, for the best signal that has the highest SNR.
In
Fig.
7,
the
highest
usable
frequency
for
the
communication link between Romania and Ukraine was
obtained. Romania and Ukraine have higher latitudes than
Romania and Iraq. The results are shown here demonstrate
that the highest frequency reached up to 7 MHz for the best
signal that has the highest SNR. The comparison between
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 is shown in Fig.8, by using the mean values
of the three frequencies from Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Now, it is
very clear that the Ionosphere disturbance at the space
between Iraq and Romania is higher than that of Ukraine and
Romania, because they have low latitudes and highest
plasma frequency, as shown in Table V. Based on the
previous results, it is definitely clear that low latitudes have
higher disturbance than higher latitudes.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, Iraq, Romania and Ukraine regions were
investigated for the Ionosphere perturbations. The results that
are based on IRI-Plas 2017 model show that Iraq has a lower
refraction index than Romania in the Ionosphere. The
refraction index is decreased because the electron density is
higher around the equatorial region, which is closer to Iraq
than Romania. As a consequence, the group velocity in Iraq
region is lower compared to Romania region, as shown in
Table IV. From these results, it is expected to have a higher
reflection Ionosphere medium in Iraq, because Iraq is located
at low latitudes compared with Romania and Ukraine.
VOACAP model depends on the frequencies that are
reflected directly from the Ionosphere. The results produced
by VOACAP model have confirmed this conclusion, but
they have also provided a better picture of the Ionosphere
reflection capabilities by producing an indication of the
frequency
range
that
is
usable
for
long
distance
communication. We plan to investigate the phenomenon of
creating artificial Ionosphere that reflects broader bandwidth
and frequencies for poor reflected frequencies region in the
Ionosphere.
