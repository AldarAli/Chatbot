Abstract— The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most 
important signals acquired from the body, as it serves as the 
immediate 
source 
of 
information 
relating 
to 
heart 
performance. Hence, a lot of research has gone into various 
types of ECG acquisition methods and systems. With the 
numerous methods and systems available at hand, it is 
important to compare, contrast, and evaluate the existing 
techniques. Not only does this help distinguish between the 
different techniques, it also helps build on the existing methods 
to create successful acquisition systems that can surpass the 
effect of unwanted factors, such as movement and other noise 
artifacts. This paper compares two different ECG acquisition 
systems, one of which uses PS25015A dry electrodes and the 
other, which uses two different silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) 
wet electrodes. ECG signals were acquired from three healthy 
individuals, in the sitting position, using both systems 
simultaneously. Signals were first filtered to diminish noise 
then the R-wave peaks were detected. The voltage values of 
these peaks were compared between the devices and electrodes 
via statistical analysis. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values 
of the signals were obtained as well and finally, the correlation 
coefficient of the signals were obtained. Overall, the dry 
electrodes may have a better SNR. However, the dry electrodes 
provided a lower wave amplitude, compared to the wet 
electrodes.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The electrocardiogram (ECG) has arguably become one 
of the most recognized and used biomedical signals. ECG is 
the electrical interpretation of the activity of the heart, and 
can easily be recorded with the use of surface electrodes 
either on the chest or limbs [1]. As the heart is one of the 
most important organs in the body, its contraction activity 
and performance is vital to monitoring health. The most 
important attribute of the ECG is that its shape is altered by 
abnormalities 
and 
cardiovascular 
diseases, 
such 
as 
arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, premature ventricular 
contraction (PVC), infarction, and many more [1].  
In terms of its signal acquisition, there are various 
methods of electrode placement. ECG is traditionally 
recorded using 12-channels for clinical use. In this 12 lead 
configuration, electrodes are placed on the right leg, and both 
wrists. The three augmented leads are (aVR, aVL, aVF) and 
six leads are placed on the chest [1]. Additionally, the left 
and right arm, and the left leg are used for leads I, II, and III, 
which together form Wilson’s central terminal (reference for 
chest leads) [1]. However, ECG can also be recorded using 
6, 5, or 3 leads [1]. Recently, the advancement in technology 
has made it possible to record ECG from only 1 lead, either 
on the chest or on a limb. Furthermore, various reputable 
sources, such as the American Heart Association (AHA), 
recommend that a minimum sampling rate of 500 Hz be used 
for ECG data acquisition, but that a sampling rate twice that 
of the theoretical minimum would be ideal, i.e., 1000 Hz 
[1][2][3]. 
 ECG is traditionally used in clinical settings, such as in 
the operating room, to monitor the heart rate of the patient, 
or to analyze a patient for various cardiovascular diseases or 
abnormalities. However, as technology progresses and as we 
become more and more aware of our health and the proper 
functioning of our body, this important biomedical signal is 
being slowly introduced in our daily life as a way of 
continuously monitoring one of our most important organs. 
New electronics and hardware, with their high efficiency and 
small size, have created an opportunity for the design of 
wearable and wireless ECG recording devices and real-time 
monitoring systems. 
Like other biomedical signals, raw ECG signals contain 
various sources of interference. These noise interferences are 
comprised of high and low frequencies from the power line, 
muscle 
movement, 
breathing, 
and 
other 
near-by 
electromagnetic sources and/or cables [4]. Since in many 
cases real-time monitoring of ECG is important, the ECG 
needs to be filtered and processed in such a way that there is 
nearly no delay between the acquisition and representation of 
the signal. Different processing techniques and algorithms 
have been suggested by researchers and used by 
manufacturers, however, when we look into implementing 
such processing techniques in a wearable wireless ECG 
device, extra caution needs to be employed with the 
algorithm design due to processing times and data transfer 
speeds. 
Another way in which ECG data acquisition differs is in 
the choice of electrode. The two most common categories of 
surface electrodes are wet and dry electrodes. Wet 
electrodes, specifically Ag/AgCl, are among the most 
commonly used electrodes for bioelectric applications. They 
certainly have their advantages, such as their simplicity, ease 
of use, low weight, and that they are disposable [5]. 
However, they are not without their disadvantages. 
Electrolytic gel should be applied between the skin and the

electrode in order to improve conductivity. This gel could 
cause allergic reactions or skin irritation [5]. These 
electrodes also have a limited shelf life due to dehydration, 
which affects impedance, generating noise [6].  The 
dehydration issues make these electrodes unsuitable for long-
term continuous measurement [7]. Finally, the spacing 
between electrodes may be so small that the gel may smear 
and lead to short circuiting [8]. On the contrary, dry 
electrodes, generally metal plates, do not encounter any of 
these problems, and are easier to set up, however, they have 
their own drawbacks as well. Since there is no secure 
adhesion between the electrode and the skin, they can shift 
during motion [6]. Furthermore, these electrodes have 
relatively large contact impedance with the skin [6][9]. 
For the purpose of this pilot study, two wet Ag/AgCl 
electrodes (3MTM Red DotTM Monitoring Electrodes, and 
Bio-Protech Telectrodes) and a PS25015A dry electrode will 
be used to simultaneously record ECG signals from the chest 
using one lead for 60 seconds while the subjects are seated. 
The resulting signals will then be analyzed and compared in 
order to draw conclusions based on their performance. 
This paper will proceed by looking at previous studies 
which have been done in relation to the comparison of dry 
and wet electrodes, in section II. Section III will move on to 
outlining the proposed procedure. The results will be 
presented in section IV, and finally section V will wrap up 
with the concluding remarks.  
II. 
PREVIOUS STUDIES 
A paper by Chi M.Y., et al. [10] compared dry electrodes 
by analyzing the data acquired, as well as their performance 
limits. As mentioned in this paper, the circuit designs of 
electrodes seem to be described well in literature; however a 
detailed comparison between electrodes are yet to be found. 
A standard testing procedure that compares noise and errors 
between the electrodes does not exist. 
Furthermore, Gandhi N., et al. [11] compared Ag/AgCl 
wet electrodes to dry and non-contact electrodes. The 
comparisons were made by analyzing noise processes, as 
well as the physiological measurements. The non-contact 
electrodes had a higher resistance compared to the 
conductive electrodes. ECG data acquired from various 
materials were all compared to data acquired Ag/AgCl 
electrodes. Simple comparisons were made between the 
graphs, by analyzed different amplitudes, noise artifacts and 
frequency drifts. Results showed that the best dry electrodes 
that can potentially replace wet electrode are ones with a 
PCB finish. Many dry non-contact electrodes were found to 
have low frequency noise, which restricts their use for 
clinical purposes. 
Additionally, another study performed by Chi M. Y. et al. 
[12] compared wet and dry electrodes for EEG purposes. 
The electrodes were compared using EEG data acquired 
from 10 subjects as they gazed at a target simulus, and 
amplitude sizes and steady state visual evoked potential 
(SSVEP) were used to compare the signals. The signals 
were compared using PSD values, signal-to-noise ratios, 
and cross correlation. The correlation between the wet and 
dry electrodes was nearly perfect. However, the correlation 
between the wet and non-contact were lower. However, a lot 
of the comparisons made between electrodes seem to be 
based on just the graphs or a few parameters, such as 
amplitude, SNR, and correlation. Table I compares the 
existing techniques used to compare electrodes, and shows 
how this paper further builds on these techniques to 
compare wet and dry electrodes.

METHODS 
A. Subjects 
This comparison method was tested on data acquired 
from the first three authors of this paper, which included one 
32 year old male, and two females, 23 and 22 years old. The 
subjects were healthy and had no history of heart conditions.   
B. Experimental Setup 
Testing was performed on two ECG acquisition systems.  
The systems as well as different electrode types were 
compared by acquiring ECG signals from the chest at 1000 
Hz. The Plessey ECG system was used to acquire dry 
electrode data, while the wet electrode system used was the 
CleveMed BioCapture. The skin was cleaned with alcohol 
wipes before positioning the wet electrodes.   
The dry and wet electrodes can be seen in Figure 1 and 2 
respectively. As prescribed in the user manuals of the 
systems, the PS25015A dry electrodes, 3M Red Dot 
Ag/AgCl electrodes, and the Bio-Protech Ag/AgCl 
Telectrodes were placed near the subclavius muscles (3cm 
beneath the left and right clavicles), as seen in Figure 3 [13].

Standard chest electrode positions can also be referred to in 
a paper authored by P.M. Rautaharju et al [14]. Both elbows 
were used as ground (not shown in Figure 3).  
Once the electrodes were placed on the body, the dry 
electrodes were fed into the Plessey system, which was 
connected to a computer, and an offset of 0.1V was 
implemented. Snap leads were attached to each of the wet 
electrodes. The snap leads were fed into the input channels 1 
and 2 and ground on the CleveMed Bioradio 150 system. 
The Bioradio was then connected to another computer via a 
wireless receiver. Moreover, data was acquired from both 
systems simultaneously; providing the same input to both 
systems, allowed for the quality and variations in the ECG 
signals to be analyzed.   
 
 
The ECG was measured from each subject for 60 
seconds, in the sitting position, and three trials were 
performed on each subject. The data files were converted 
into CSV files, in order to perform signal processing in 
MATLAB. 
C. Signal Processing 
The ECG signals acquired from both systems were 
sampled at 1000 Hz. Furthermore, the raw ECG data was 
filtered using low-pass, high-pass, and notch filters. 
First, an 8th order low-pass Butterworth filter was used 
with a cutoff frequency of 180 Hz. The filter was designed 
based on (1) [1].

    (  
  )   
Where N is the order of the filter,   is the corner frequency, 
  is the pass-band edge frequency, and 1/(1+  ) is the band 
edge value. 
Next a stop-band filter was used for a notch filter at 55-
65 Hz, followed by a high-pass FIR filter with a cutoff 
frequency of 0.002 Hz. In order to detect heart rate, the R 
waves were made prominent by squaring the entire ECG 
signal. Peak detection was performed using the thresholding 
technique, similar to the R-wave detection performed by H. 
Kew and D. Jeong [16]. A threshold value was used to 
detect the R-wave peak, as seen in a study by P. Verdecchia 
et al. [17]. 
Statistical analysis was performed on the R-wave peak 
values detected in order to compare the ECG signals 
obtained through the wet and dry electrode systems. The 
parameters computed include mean (2), standard deviation 
(3), variance (4), and standard error (5). The signals were 
also compared by computing the signal-to-noise ratios 
(SNR) and the cross-correlation. Cross-correlation (6) was 
performed on the outputs from each electrode to evaluate 
the similarity between the signals by obtaining the 
correlation coefficient [1][18][19].

RESULTS 
Figure 4 shows a sample plot illustrating the three ECG 
signals obtained from the three electrodes, PS25015A dry 
electrodes, Bio-Protech Ag/AgCl wet electrodes, and 3M 
Red Dot Ag/AgCl wet electrodes respectively. It is evident 
from Figure 4 that the dry electrode system shows a lower 
amplitude, compared to the wet electrode systems. Both of 
the 
wet 
electrode 
systems 
show 
amplitudes 
of 
approximately 1 mV. 
Thresholding was used to perform R-wave detection in 
order to detect the heart rate, similar to the techniques used 
by H. Kew and D. Jeong [16]. The average instant heart rate 
can be seen in Figure 5. 
Table II compares the processed data acquired from the 
three electrodes. As expected, the two wet electrodes 
showed higher correlation with each other than with the dry 
electrodes. The dry electrodes were found to have a negative 
DC-offset, compared to the wet electrodes, and provided the 
best SNR. Statistical analysis was performed on the R-wave 
peak values for each of the three electrodes, similar to 
analysis performed by G. Crifaci et al [20]. The 3M Red Dot 
electrodes showed higher mean R-wave peak voltages. For 
example, subject A had a mean R-wave peak of about 0.99 
mV when measured through the 3M Red Dot electrodes and 
a mean of only 0.39 mV when measured through the dry 
electrodes.  
When comparing the standard errors across the three 
electrodes for the different subjects, the results seem to vary. 
Subject A had an error of 0.0011 mV for the dry electrode, 
and errors of 0.003 mV and 0.0054 mV for the wet 
electrodes, giving a slight difference of 0.0043 mV between 
the dry and wet electrodes, with the dry electrode having the 
lowest error. On the other hand, Subject B had an error of 
0.0045 mV for the dry electrode, and errors of 0.0019 mV 
and 0.0017 mV for the wet electrodes, resulting in a 
difference of 0.0028 mV, with the dry electrode having the 
highest error. Similarly, for Subject C, there was an error of 
0.01 mV for the dry electrode, and errors of 0.0072 mV and 
0.0055 mV for the wet electrodes, resulting in a difference 
of 0.0045 mV with the dry electrode once again having the 
highest standard error. In summary, there is no suggestion 
of consistent differences in the standard errors between 
electrodes.  
It is important to note that there were a few factors 
which may have affected the results. Although the data was 
acquired simultaneously from the three electrodes, there was 
an inter-electrode distance of 3.0 cm. This may have 
affected the results, as the electrodes were each acquiring 
ECG data from slightly different positions on the chest. The 
skin was wiped with alcohol before the electrodes were 
positioned; however, there may not have been 100% 
electrode-to-skin contact.

Furthermore, the dry electrodes were attached firmly 
onto the subject, but the pressure on the electrodes may not 
have been uniform for the entire duration of the experiment 
because of the elasticity of the fastening band. Moreover, 
two individuals were running the two systems on two 
different computers to start data acquisition. Hence, there 
may have been a slight delay in start/stop times during 
acquisition, but this was adjusted in the data analysis by 
aligning the R-waves.  
For future work, the results may be more definitive if 
more subjects are used.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The results showed fairly high signal-to-noise ratios and 
varying mean and variance ranges for each electrode type. 
However, there were suggestions of differences between the 
electrodes, such as the SNR, where the dry electrodes 
seemed to have a better SNR in our subjects, compared to 
the wet electrodes even though they recorded at lower 
amplitude. Although both types of electrodes have their own 
advantages and disadvantages, the determination of the most 
advantageous option is dependent on the individual user’s 
applications and needs. For example, if the user desires a 
higher SNR value, dry electrodes should be used. However, 
if a lower standard error is desired, then wet electrodes 
should be used. The advantage of this approach consists of 
clearly defined pros and cons for each system so that the user 
can make a more informed decision. For future work, these 
values can be compared to a wider range of dry and wet 
electrodes and ECG acquisition systems, and can be tested 
on a larger population for more accurate results. Most 
importantly, the methods discussed in this paper can be used 
as a platform for the comparison of electrodes in order to 
help evaluate different systems and their accuracies.
