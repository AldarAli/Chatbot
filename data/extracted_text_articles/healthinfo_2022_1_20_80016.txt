Abstract - The first infection caused by Covid-19 appeared in 
December 2019 and has infected about 250 million people since. 
In pandemics, it is essential to model propagation so that it is 
possible to know how to act to avoid a significant public health 
problem. Since the appearance of Covid-19, mathematicians, 
scientists, physicians, and engineers have cooperated in data 
analysis. This study aims to understand which mathematical 
models are more relevant and used in this context. Based on 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, we will analyse Covid-19 
related articles, meeting the results in predicting this pandemic 
in Portugal and worldwide. All the articles chosen use models or 
algorithms to perform prediction, and we conclude that the 
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model was the most 
appropriate and the most used. All the articles have been 
published up to April 2021. 
 
Keywords – PRISMA; literature review; Covid-19; prediction; 
SIR. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Humans have been affected by infectious diseases since 
human behaviours allowed for their spread and, according to 
[1], there have been reports of episodes of infectious diseases 
since antiquity. According to [2], an epidemic is the spread of 
an infectious and contagious disease that develops in a place 
or region, quickly, causing many victims in a short period of 
time. A pandemic is an infectious disease that spreads 
worldwide and attacks at the same time numerous people in 
many countries.  
The Coronavirus that existed before the onset of SARS-CoV 
also represented a significant public health problem, despite 
being responsible for only mild respiratory illnesses limited to 
the upper respiratory tract, such as the common flu. One of the 
most significant pandemics was the Spanish flu, between 
1918 and 1920, in which about 50 million people died. 
Currently, the world is being affected by the Coronavirus 
(SARS–CoV–2). Covid-19 is the name attributed by the 
World Health Organization to the disease caused by the new 
Coronavirus SARS-COV-2, which can cause severe 
respiratory infections such as pneumonia. This virus was first 
identified in humans in late 2019 in the Chinese city of 
Wuhan. "Being based in more than 100 countries and 
territories on five continents" [3], it has become one of the 
biggest challenges of the 21st century. Because the Covid-19 
virus has only been present in everyday life since 2019, 
knowledge about it is still limited. Because it is an acute 
respiratory infection, SARS-CoV-2 is spread through droplets, 
respiratory secretions, and direct contact with infected patients. 
Given this information, all individuals should be considered 
potential disseminators of the infection, and social distancing and 
the use of masks should be considered for all as prevention 
measures. It should be seen that, when there is transmission of 
the virus, it has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days, verifying 
the existence of viral excretion about 2 to 3 days before the 
beginning of symptoms. Even asymptomatic individuals may 
transmit the virus, although transmission of the infection is 
unusual. When symptoms are reported, the status of the infected 
individual must be taken into care, and the most common 
symptoms may be fever, dry cough, and fatigue. There are also 
less common symptoms to consider, such as high blood pressure 
and muscle pain, sore throat, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, headache, 
loss of taste or smell, skin irritations or discolouration of the 
fingers or toes. Moreover, in more severe states, patients infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 may present with difficulty breathing or 
shortness of breath, chest pressure or pain, speech loss or loss of 
motor capacity. 
For a person to be considered infected, only the symptoms are 
not enough, and it is necessary to make a positive diagnosis of 
Covid-19; this is usually done through a molecular test of 
respiratory secretions. Since the pandemic's beginning, the 
international scientific community has unified efforts to produce 
an antiviral treatment that demonstrates positive results; 
practically every day, numerous methodology articles are 
published to be developed and potential medicines to combat this 
virus. At first, due to the lack of a specific and effective treatment 
against Covid-19, the process was based on symptomatic control 
and ventilatory support to more acute cases.  
More than a year after the SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified, 
vaccines began to develop in various parts of the world. More 
than 200 vaccines have been developed, of which 90 have 
progressed to clinical trials. There are currently four authorised 
vaccines. Also, in 2020, the vaccination system began, and the 
entire vaccination process data was housed in the country's

existing infrastructure of the Electronic Health Registry. Despite 
current uncertainty regarding the efficacy and safety of vaccines, 
studies indicate that they are effective in preventing Covid-19 
and in preventing severe disease and death. There is still no 
certainty about the period of protection they offer or the 
effectiveness of the various variants.  
However, early on, technological tools became great allies 
for determining preventive measures and for the medical 
community, as well as for society in general, as these have 
helped and still help in the detection, prevention, and response 
against the virus. This pandemic promotes the need for new 
approaches and technologies. Machine Learning (ML) and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are solutions suitable to the world 
full of data, contributing to "technological evolution that 
revolutionises the lives and businesses of all of us" [4]. 
According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development [5], before the world was even aware of the 
threat that coronavirus represents, "AI systems had already 
noticed the outbreak of an unknown type of pneumonia in 
China", since artificial intelligence is a system that tries to 
perceive the study environment and takes measures that 
maximize the chances of success. This tool was used in the 
management of all stages of the crisis: detection, prevention, 
response and recovery." These tools have become an 
indispensable ally in the fight against the pandemic, 
accelerating the research on treatments, analysing data and 
other functions like planning, implementing, and evaluating 
prevention programs. 
By analysing articles and work developed by several 
authors, several epidemiological models have been published 
to predict its dissemination over the last years of the SARS–
CoV–2 pandemic, but there are still uncertainties as to 
accuracy. The present study will try to understand the 
characteristics of the most popular models for predicting the 
evolution of the pandemic. We aim to analyse scientific 
articles to identify the most used prediction models in a 
pandemic situation.  
     This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the 
details of the methodology of the systematic literature review. 
Section 3 presents the conclusions and directions for future 
work. 
II. METHODOLOGY 
This section presents a systematic review of studies that 
addressed the use of predictions methods for Covid-19 
evolution. The review is reported according to the PRISMA 
statement [6]. It includes the following topics: Research 
questions (Section A); Inclusion criteria (Section B); Search 
strategy (Section C); Results (Section D); Data Extraction and 
Data Analysis (Section E); Discussion (Section F).  
A.  Research questions 
The research questions are as follows: (Q1): What are the 
existing models/algorithms for the Covid-19 forecast? (Q2): 
How to make a prediction in an application (web or mobile) 
for Covid-19? (Q3): What parameters are used for the creation 
of a Covid-19 forecasting model? (Q4): What advantages do 
these algorithms bring to the health area and the population? 
 
B. Inclusion criteria 
The inclusion criteria of studies and evaluation methods for 
this review were: (C1): Studies where algorithms applied to 
data related to Covid-19 are present; (C2): Studies that have 
calculated formulations applied to data resulting from studies 
on the theme of Covid-19; (C3): Studies seeking to predict the 
evolution of the pandemic; (C4): Studies showing 
assertiveness results of prediction algorithms related to the 
theme of Covid-19; (C5): Studies that consider the country 
Portugal; (C6): Studies between 2019 and 2021. 
 
C. Search strategy 
Through research and survey of scientific articles in 
PubMed, ScienceDirect and MedRvix databases, a study was 
conducted on Covid-19 and the corresponding aspects of this 
disease. This study made it possible to understand the best 
practices 
about 
data 
processing, 
algorithms 
to 
be 
implemented, and the best ways to select the best model. The 
articles included were published between 2019 - 2021 and 
selected according to relevance to the proposal of this review. 
The research terms used to perform this systematic review 
were: "Covid", "Algorithm", "Forecast", "Portugal", which 
were chosen and analysed to identify the different types of 
Covid-19 prediction algorithms that are being used in 
Portugal. This survey was conducted in April 2021. 
 
D. Results 
After the literature search, 136 studies were obtained 
(after removing five duplicates) and, after applying the 
inclusion criteria identified in Section 2.2, 49 studies were 
excluded, resulting in 82 studies. These studies were 
evaluated in terms of title and abstract, resulting in the 
exclusion of 28 studies. The full-text evaluation of the 
remaining 54 studies was performed, excluding 36 studies 
that did not match the defined inclusion criteria, did not 
present sufficient information about the algorithm used, or 
lacked an outcome. The remaining 18 studies are presented in 
the qualitative and quantitative synthesis. 
 
E. Data Extraction and Data Analysis 
Data were extracted from all identified studies using a 
predefined data format that included: study name, authors, 
year of publication, date, methods/algorithm, programming 
language/platforms. 
Two 
reviewers 
extracted 
the 
information, and any disagreements were resolved via

languages for the development of these methods. This 
information served as a basis for answering the formulated 
research questions. 
 
F. Discussion 
Over this time, several epidemiological models have been 
published predicting the spread of the Covid-19 virus, but 
there are still ambiguities as to accuracy in many cases. One 
of the most critical aspects of these articles is the development 
of models designed to help the entire population understand 
the importance of prevention. Some of the studies contributed 
to the prediction of the evolution of the pandemic and helped 
in decision-making. At an early stage of the pandemic, the 
articles helped to understand how the virus could develop and 
how important it was for countries to quarantine or not. With 
all the discoveries made, it is possible to identify trends 
concerning vaccines and how the pandemic may develop 
going forward. When analysing the eighteen selected articles, 
it can be said that the time interval of the studies occurs from 
2020 to 2021, as indicated in Figure 2. The most used method 
was the SIR, consisting of twelve (12) articles; meanwhile, 
three (3) of the articles chose to use the SEIR, and the same 
number (3) used the Random Forest method; two (2) articles 
use logistic regression and Artificial Neural Network, and

finally, (1) article used Linear Regression and fminCon, as 
shown in the graph in Figure 3. The results were obtained with 
consideration that there may be more than one model in each 
article. Table II presents the results obtained for models and 
programming languages used by the authors. Then, with the 
help of this research, it was possible to realise that many 
mathematical models can be used to predict epidemiology. 
These can be Statistical Learning (SL), ML, or Deep Learning 
(DL). The most significant difference between SL and ML is 
the purpose. The SL is designed for the different relationships 
between the variables, while the ML is designed to make 
predictions as accurate as possible. The DL is an SL method 
that extracts resources or attributes from raw data. However, 
information is limited mainly by the fact that Covid-19 is 
recent. In many of the studies analysed, only pandemic 
prevention means are indicated, or specific/discrete values, 
for example, daily cases and not given for a prediction of the 
evolution of Covid-19, which is the factor that analytical 
work.

Based on the information acquired, the answers to the research 
questions are:  
Question 1: What are the existing models/algorithms for the 
Covid-19 forecast? Practically, every day around the world, new 
algorithms are used or even generated and may be based on or 
not existing mathematical models. Regarding the articles that 
were studied, the SIR model was referenced in the articles [7]-
[9][12]-[15][17][18][20][21][24]; in relation to the Random 
Forest algorithm, it was mentioned in the articles [8][10][16];     
the Decision Tree algorithm was exclusively referenced in the 
article [10]; the variant of the SEIR model appears in the articles 
[11][17][18]; Logistic Regression is present in the articles 
[16][22]; Linear Regression was alluded only in the article [21]; 
the Artificial Neural Network was referenced in the articles 
[22][23]; finally the Fmincon algorithm in the article [19]. 
Question 2: How to make a prediction in an application (web or 
mobile) for Covid-19? A prediction can be made through 
programs such as MATLAB, which was used to make the 
predictions in the articles [17]-[19][24]. R was used by the 
authors of the articles [7][9][13][14][16][20][21]; the articles 
[10][12][15] use Phyton for prediction, C++ is used in the articles 
[12][18]. Subsequently, the results obtained are shared and can 
be implemented in a computerized application content. 
Question 3: What parameters are used for the creation of a 
Covid-19 forecasting model? In a forecast model for Covid-19, 
the parameters are usually generalised, differentiating between 
the content with which the treatment is carried out. For their 
calculations, it is necessary to inform the number of the global 
population (Susceptible), the number of cases that manifest 
having the disease (Infected) and the number of the entire 
population that has managed to overcome so far (Recovered), 
this information is contained in all eighteen (18) articles 
analyzed.  
Question 4: What advantages do these algorithms bring to the 
health area and the population? The predictor algorithms emerge 
in the connection between pure statistics with the computer 
media of ML. Health benefits from them in collecting more 
accurate data because this significant advance in data analysis 
allows a pleasant and symbiotic visualization, contributing to a 
more effective approach by health professionals [19]. For 
researchers in this area, these algorithms help them have the 
means for future analysis of a new eventual pandemic [17] and 
the population now has access to information. 
 
The articles analyzed stated that the deterministic model most 
implemented in the case studies was the SIR and will be used for 
future work. This model [25][26] has different dependencies, 
which are generally called capital letters such as "S", "I", and 
"R". In the "SIR" model, "S" represents the group of the 
population likely to contract the disease, "I" represents the group 
of the population that contracted the disease and that can transmit 
it to another individual, infectious group, and the "R" represents 
the group of the population that recovered from the disease.

The transition rates of individuals between different groups 
are expressed through derivatives; deterministic models are 
formulated in terms of systems of differential equations. To make 
the model more realistic, it is usual to increase the number of 
compartments to characterize more stages of the disease. For 
example, in a study on the effect of quarantine on the 
transmission of infectious disease, the authors introduced to this 
model the quarantine compartment, "Q", if all infected 
individuals should pass through the compartment before 
returning to the compartment of susceptible "S" or recovered 
"R".  
When performing the analysis of articles, several questions 
arise regarding this model, such as: 
• What if the dataset changes regularly?  
For this question and looking at the case of Portugal, data is 
provided by DGS every day, but Rt (Recovered by time) is 
updated weekly.  To combat the fact that data changes regularly, 
the estimate will be developed weekly, with the preceding; this 
is the most appropriate solution to understand the data trend. The 
monthly, or even long-term, estimate for the study object in 
question is not recommended. 
For the prediction of the SIR data-based model, some pros and 
cons are obtained, which are them: 
• Pros: It is a simple model; It is compartment-based; It is 
based on a dataset during a time window; It is a deterministic 
model; You do not need many iterations to achieve the desired 
accuracy. 
•Cons: When using the standard SIR model, the "N" 
corresponds to the total population, being a fixed and global 
value; Age groups are not distinguished. 
It is concluded that a model stands out for the number of times 
it is mentioned in the articles analysed. 
III. CONCLUSION 
Through what was addressed in the previous sections, it is 
concluded that research is one of the most critical phases of this 
work because it shows the relevance of mathematical modelling 
in the study of epidemics, the same starting point for the 
evolution of this study.  
To obtain the results of the realised studies, it should be 
considered that Covid-19 is recent and, although there is 
information about the viruses in this family, there is no 
information on how the virus will grow. As cited earlier, the 
pandemic is recent and constantly updated, making it 
challenging to obtain a detailed response or an approximation 
of great perceptibility of the predicted results in relation to the 
actual data. Consequently, the analyst's work is challenging, 
requiring comparing accurate data with the predicted periods 
to confirm the forecast's success rate. That is why it is vital 
that the combinations of virologists' knowledge with ML can 
help create frameworks to combat Covid-19 and provide 
better automated solutions to fight against Covid-19. In the 
processing of data, a segmentation of the research was to be 
accomplished to carry out a collection of mathematical models 
that meet the proposed needs, understand the evolution and its 
factors, and make predictions within the scope of Covid-19. The 
models used in the articles analysed were systematically 
organised, considering their characteristics. In general, the 
analysed models can be accurate and have a minimum error rate. 
However, they cannot accurately predict what will happen in 
each situation, as it is theoretically impossible to determine how 
individuals will adapt their behaviour in the community. Using 
modelling, it is possible to simulate the propagation, in this case 
of Covid-19, in each population to estimate the total number of 
affected individuals.   
In the analysed studies, several epidemiological models 
were published to predict the spread of the pandemic, and 
there are still uncertainties as to their accuracy. Regarding the 
mathematical models used, it can be stowed that the authors 
selected the SIR model, the Random Forest, Decision Tree, 
Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Artificial Neural 
Networks, Fmicon, Bayesian and the SEIR model to carry 
their studies. 
The adoption of preventive measures of public health was 
essential to reducing the outbreak of this contagious disease. 
Initially, quarantine was the best preventive measure; studies 
show that without other resources such as masks or gel alcohol, 
more than four quarantines were required until a reasonable 
amount of group immunity was arrived at. With the arrival of 
vaccines, the picture has changed and, as a result, the number of 
quarantines has been reduced, and a higher number of immune 
persons is achieved in a smaller period.  
After the research and analysis phase, choosing the most 
appropriate model to simulate the epidemic outbreak is initiated 
according to the characteristics of the virus under analysis. The 
transmission and contagion period are the two characteristics 
being modelled through their rates, and the values of these 
characteristics are decisive in the analysis of the outbreak's 
evolution.  These characteristics were best represented by the 
SIR model, which was the most referred by the authors.  
After the analysis of scientific articles and the preference of 
the method to be implemented, it is concluded that it is essential 
to understand more about the virus and its history. 
For future work, it will be interesting to use the SIR method 
with the addition of new parameters, such as vaccination.
