Abstract—This paper presents simulation of optical effects on 
the DC parameters of 100 nm single gate InAlAs/InGaAs High 
Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT). The advantage of this 
model is that it provides us the flexibility to study the effects of 
optical illumination on the device parameters by specifying a 
user defined photo-generation rate as a constant or as a 
function of position in the device.   The current–voltage 
characteristics of the device under dark and illuminated 
conditions have been simulated using luminous module 
(Silvaco Device Simulator) and recalling C-Interpreter 
function F.RADIATE to specify a constant photo generation 
rate. Significant increase in the drain to source current has 
been observed, suggesting future possible applications as 
optoelectronic device.

INTRODUCTION 
The concept of Internet of things (IOT) promises to 
connect anything with everything. The vision of IOT 
emphasizes on connecting physical things with the real 
world. This certainly requires a new revolution in the field of 
wireless and optical communication technology which 
further imposes the need for modern devices with ability to 
operate at higher frequencies and with reduced noise. With 
the advancements in the fabrication techniques, Compound 
semiconductor based heterostructure devices are replacing 
the conventional devices to operate at higher frequencies and 
low noise. Among various such devices, HEMT has emerged 
as a potential device to be able to operate effectively at 
higher frequencies and low noise.  
HEMT, demonstrated in 1980 [1], exploits the superior 
carrier 
transport 
properties 
of 
modulation 
doped 
heterojunction. HEMT is now a well established technology 
and we can find its wide application in micro and millimeter 
wave frequency range [2]-[4]. HEMT technology has 
already reached a level where we have reduced the device 
dimensions to improve its performance in terms of noise 
and speed. Further reduction in gate length is limited by the 
short channel effects. HEMTs with a current–gain cut-off 
frequency of 562 GHz and with maximum frequency of 
oscillation of 330 GHz have been reported for 25 nm gate 
length [5]. In order to improve the further performance of 
the device, optical illumination seems to be a potential 
technique.  
The material used for the fabrication of HEMT has 
evolved 
from 
the 
first 
generation 
lattice 
matched 
AlGaAs/GaAs 
HEMTs 
to 
AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs 
psuedomorphic HEMTs (pHEMTs). AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs 
pHEMTs suffer from dislocations due to high lattice 
constant mismatch between InGaAs and GaAs substrate.  
InAlAs and InGaAs lattice matched to InP substrate have 
emerged as suitable high band gap and low band gap 
materials respectively for HEMT structures. Compared to 
GaAs the InGaAs channel has higher mobility. Further, 
InAlAs does not suffer from the problem of Deep Levels 
(DX centers) as AlGaAs does [6]. Also the higher 
conduction band offset in InAlAs/InGaAs HEMT results in 
higher 2-DEG density as compared to AlGaAs/GaAs 
HEMT.  
The study of the performance of high speed microwave 
semiconductor devices under optical illumination is an area 
of growing interest due to their potential application in 
fiber-optical communication and optical integration [7]. In 
context of optical applications, HEMT is emerging as an 
important optoelectronic device for high speed photo-
detection, 
amplifier 
gain 
control, 
frequency 
tuning 
oscillators, and in phase shifters [8]-[15].  
In the recent past, several authors carried out the 
simulation 
of 
optically 
illuminated 
MOSFETs 
and 
MODFETS [16][17]. Fallahnejad et.al [18] simulated the 
noise characteristics of AlGaN/GaN HEMT on SIC 
substrate for low noise applications using silvaco device 
simulator. None of these authors have used C –Interpreter 
function to specify the photo-generation rate. This paper 
simulates the effect of optical illumination on the 
performance of 100 nm InAlAs/InGaAs single gate HEMT 
using Atlas device simulator where C-Interpreter function 
F.RADIATE has been used. 
The device structure and the simulation model for 
optical illumination are described in Section II. The 
simulation results thus obtained are reported and discussed 
in Section III. Finally the conclusion is presented in Section 
IV.

The gate is illuminated by a laser source in a perpendicular 
direction. ATLAS device simulator has been used to 
simulate the device behavior. ATLAS simulator uses 
luminous module, a general purpose light propagation and 
absorption program integrated into the atlas framework for 
optical illumination. This module includes various physical 
models for light propagation. Ray tracing model has been 
used here, which is a general method for light propagation 
in 2D and 3D non-planar geometries and completely ignores 
coherence and diffraction effects.

The device is physically modeled by using Shockley-
Read-Hall 
(SRH), 
Concentration 
dependent 
mobility 
(CONMOB) and parallel electric field dependence mobility 
(FLDMOB) models. The SRH is a recombination mode that 
uses fixed minority carrier lifetimes. CONMOB uses simple 
power law temperature dependent mobility and FLDMOB is 
required to model any type of velocity saturation effect. 
Gummel Newton Iteration scheme has been used to obtain 
the numerical solution. Drift diffusion model is employed to 
evaluate potential, electron and hole concentration with 
appropriate assumptions and hence, calculate the drain to 
source current [20]. 
 Ray tracing uses the real part of the refractive index to 
calculate the optical intensity at each grid point and 
imaginary part to calculate the carrier concentration due to 
photo generation at each grid point. Ray tracing models the 
source current due to photo generation as [20]:

constant. c is the speed of light in vacuum. Wt is the width of 
the incident beam.

The limits of integration extend from the origin of the ray to 
the depth that the ray traces in the device. αi is the

Photo-generation rate accounts for the number of 
electron hole pairs generated in the channel due to 
illumination. C-interpreter function F.RADIATE is used to 
specify a constant photo-generation rate. BEAM statement 
is used to specify the C-interpreter function using 
F.RADIATE [20] parameter in the input deck. It calls the 
radiate function that defines a constant photo-generation rate 
of 1025 carriers per cubic centimeter. Optical Source and 
available currents thus produced are calculated using 
equations (1) and (2). The photo-generated carrier increases 
the overall drain to source current of the device. 
Maximum optical efficiency of the device is obtained by 
assuming the gate metal and the subsequent layers of the 
device to be transparent. In such case the optical source 
current is equal to the available photo-current.

current in the channel are evaluated for a constant photo-
generation rate specified using F.RADIATE C-interpreter 
function in the luminous module of Atlas 2-D device 
simulator.  
Fig. 2 presents the simulated drain to source current (ID-
VDS) characteristics under dark and illuminated conditions at 
a constant photo generation rate of 1025per cubic 
centimeters. For low values of drain to source bias, current 
proportional to drain to source bias flows from drain to 
source along the electron gas channel. As the drain to source 
bias is increased, the electron velocity and the channel 
current saturate.   
As the device is exposed to optical illumination, the 
drain to source current increases. This is because the photo-
generated carriers produce a source photo-current. Under 
the assumptions made, the source current is equal to the 
available photo-current. This available photo-generated 
current is added to the dark drain to source current and 
hence, increases the overall drain to source current of the 
device under optical illumination. 
 
 
Figure 2. Variation of drain to source current with drain to source voltage 
under illumination and dark condition for a 100 nm InAlAs/InGaAs HEMT 
(λ=0.623 um and Pop=10 Watt/cm2). 
 
Fig. 3 shows the variation of drain to source current (Ids) 
with gate to source voltage (Vgs) under dark and exposure 
conditions. Under exposure the threshold voltage of the 
InAlAs/InGaAs HEMT shifts turning the device on at a 
lower gate to source voltage. This suggests an increase in 
the transconductance of the device and hence the frequency 
of operation. 
Fig. 4 depicts the drain (ID-VDS) characteristics of the 
device for varying optical power density. With increasing 
optical power density the available photo-current in the 
channel increases thus, increasing the drain to source 
current.  
Table II represents the simulated source current (Eqn.1) 
generated at varying optical power density. It shows that as  
we increase the optical power density, the optical source 
current increases.

 Atlas device simulator. Under exposure, the drain to source 
current is found to increase maximum by 7.6 mA for gate to 
source voltage (Vgs=0 V) and drain to source voltage 
(Vds=0.3 V) at an optical power density of 10 Watt/cm2. A 
significant shift in the threshold voltage is observed. At a 
voltage corresponding to the dark threshold voltage (-0.6 V) 
the device offers a higher drain current of 15.3 mA under 
illumination. Thus, optical illumination is seen to enhance 
the performance of the device. The simulation technique 
used gives us freedom to utilize any source. This would be 
helpful in studying both photovoltaic and photoconductive 
effects. This model provides us the flexibility to study the 
effects of optical illumination on the device parameters by 
specifying a user defined photo-generation rate. The 
accuracy of the model can be further improved by 
incorporating losses due to reflections at the interface. The 
photo-generation rate defined in the model is taken as a 
constant by the user. This work can be further extended by 
defining the photo-generation rate as a function of position 
in the device.
