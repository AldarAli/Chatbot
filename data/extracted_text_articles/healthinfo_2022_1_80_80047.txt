Abstract—Electroencephalography is a clinical signal that 
reveals the brain's electrical activity. In this category, the 
Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) is one of the most frequent 
measures, especially when it is necessary to assess the maturity 
and function of the central visual system. The Electrodermal 
Activity (EDA) data gives information about skin conductance, 
and it is used to evaluate autonomic sympathetic reactions, 
often related to neuropsychological states. It could be used 
with all ages and in young subjects with healthy development 
or clinical practice with children with atypical development. In 
this paper, we propose an experimental setup based on 
checkerboard stimuli to assess the evolution of visual system 
development of preterm infants. This experimental protocol 
was applied to two female preterm born infants of 4 and 6 
months of corrected age. The preliminary findings show that, 
as expected, the P100 latencies and amplitude are still different 
from those expected for adults and older children. However, 
the older infant presents results more similar to adults, 
corresponding to having a more mature visual system. 
Concerning EDA, it was observed that the older infant 
presents more responses to the stimulus, a higher level of skin 
conductance, and a shorter latency time than the younger 
infant, which is congruent with what is expected, given the 
maturation of the nervous system. The methodology used in 
this pilot application and the algorithm defined seem adequate 
to use in a longitudinal study to follow the evolution of 
preterm and term infants.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Electroencephalography is used in neuroscience to 
explore the electrical activity of living neurons. These cells 
communicate using electrical and chemical signals, and 
electroencephalographic techniques aim to measure this 
activity non-invasively [1]. The electroencephalography 
signals have been measured since the XIX century [2], but 
optimization of signal processing techniques has helped 
uncover information that changed the way various diseases 
were diagnosed previously [3].  
Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) are massed electrical 
signals generated by occipital cortical areas in response to 
visual stimulation [4]. Specifically, the VEPs are utilized in 
research and clinical practice to characterize the function 
and integrity of the visual system, mainly optic nerve 
lesions, optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis [5]. Those 
bioelectric signals generated in the striate and extrastriate 
cortex by retinal stimulation could be recorded from the 
scalp using electrodes [5] positioned in the specific 
Brodman Area 17, 18, and 19 [4] that can provide important 
diagnostic information regarding the functional integrity of 
the visual system [6].  
Different stimuli are currently used to analyze the visual 
cortex response. These could be divided into two kinds of 
visual stimuli: unpatterned flashing lights and patterned 
stimuli. The most used pattern is a checkerboard with black 
and white squares [5]. In a pattern-reversal paradigm, the 
pattern is alternated without change in the luminance at a 
specific reversal rate [4]. Although the most used sample 
rate is 2 reversals per second [6], other taxa could be used 
with specific populations [7]-[10]. With that kind of stimuli, 
the typical waveform consists of N75, P100, and N135 
peaks [6].  
In traditional methodologies, the assessment is done in a 
specific location using fixed equipment. However, current 
clinical and research demands lead to developing portable 
devices, like g.Nautilus© [11] allows for a dependable data

recorder at the subjects’ location. To assess is necessary to 
be stationed in a quiet room, guaranteed a typical ambient 
light level, correct positioning of the electrodes, and 
participants at least 70 cm from the stimulus [12]. To record 
the data, single electrodes could be used in occipital 
positions or a CAP where the electrodes are already 
positioned. This system's advantage is that the sensors' 
correct positioning is guaranteed. However, regardless of 
the system to position the sensors, they must be connected 
with the software that registers the signal and connects to 
the visual stimuli. 
The Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signal is an electrical 
manifestation of the sympathetic innervation of the sweat 
glands. EDA has had a history in psychophysiological 
research (including emotional or cognitive stress) since the 
middle of XIX century. It is measured in a non-invasive 
skin surface mode, predominantly from plantar eccrine 
sweat glands [13]. 
In recent years, researchers began using EDA for 
pathophysiological applications like assessing fatigue, pain, 
sleepiness, exercise recovery, diagnosis of epilepsy, 
neuropathies, and depression, among others [14]. A recent 
study with newborns has shown that EDA parameters seem 
sensitive in detecting sympathetic regulation changes in 
early postnatal life. The EDA measure can represent an 
essential step towards a non-invasive early diagnosis of the 
pathological states linked to autonomic dysmaturation in 
newborns [15]. Although the skin biomarkers of preterm 
birth could be seriously altered [16], the EDA of that 
population has not been measured, associated with a visual 
stimulus, as far as we know. 
Preterm born is a condition that has increased in the last 
few decades, and it is estimated by World Health 
Organization that 15 million infants are born too early every 
year. That represents more than 1 in 10 infants [17]. The 
consequences of preterm birth have a large spectrum of 
variability. Some infants without any permanent sequelae at 
2 years old have the same motor development as full-term 
infants at the same age [18]. However, unfortunately, most 
infants suffer the consequences of being preterm born for a 
longer period [17] in ways that could be subtle or more 
apparent, with impacts on growing, playing, or learning 
[19]-[21]. Despite the knowledge about the changes in 
different areas of participation, the link between those and 
electrophysiological 
signals 
patterns 
and 
the 
early 
biomarker identification is not completely established. 
Accepting the electroencephalography response as a 
quantitative signal of nervous system function and knowing 
its selective use in clinical settings, our research group is 
motivated to deeper understand the VEP and EDA in the 
first months of life of preterm born infants. In order to 
answer the previously identified requirements for visual 
skills assessments [22] and enlarge the clinical and 
developmental follow-up evaluations that already exist, this 
paper aims to present an integrated experimental setup to 
assess the evolution of visual system development in 
preterm infants. It also presents the results of a pilot 
application with two preterm infants.  
To achieve these goals, the proceeding was organized to 
describe the materials and methods used, followed by 
results presentation and analysis, finishing with the 
conclusions and suggestions for further work. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
This section describes the experimental setup as well as 
the main procedures of data collection and analyses used.  
The study was authorized by the Ethical Commission of 
Central Lisbon University Hospital Center with the official 
reference "Projeto INV14", and the parents gave written 
informed consent. 
A. 
Experimental setup 
As seen in Fig. 1, the experimental setup integrates the 
following equipment: 
• Computer: all the equipment runs on a Dell Computer 
(Intel ® Core (TN) 2DUO, 4,00 GB) that projects the 
image for a LG flatron W1934s; 
• E-Prime®: software used to create the visual stimuli, 
black/white checkerboard pattern; 
• g.Nautilus®: serial number NB-2017.08.77 was used 
with software g.Recorder® version 5.16.00 and allows 
recording of the  VEP. The connection between the 
g.Nautilus© and E-Prime was done using a parallel port; 
• Biosignalsplux®: used with the opensignals® software 
to record EDA signals. The connection between 
biosignals and E-Prime was guaranteed by a socket that 
records the triggers related to the stimuli appearance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Experimental setup 
 
As previously referenced, the visual stimuli were 
created using the E-Prime® software. A pattern-reversal 
evoked potentials technique was chosen, creating a 
checkerboard pattern in which the colors of the squares 
(black and white) were inverted every 1 second for a total 
of 120 seconds. The choice of this pattern was based on the 
fact that it presents a lower variability in latency and 
amplitude 
between 
different 
measurements, 
which

facilitates data comparison [4]. Furthermore, the number of 
stimuli presented was thought to be comprehensive enough 
to allow several parts of the signal to be still used, 
considering that it would be almost impossible not to have 
many artifacts in the infants' signals. At the center of the 
checkerboard pattern, there is a red cross that serves as a 
fixation point to look at. Before and after the pattern is 
shown, warning messages about the start and end of signal 
acquisition are displayed to the participants. It is also 
important to note that the chosen inversion timing was 
inspired by previous studies implemented with preterm born 
infants [7][8]. Since the correct creation of VEP depends on 
the exact moment that the presentation of each stimulus is 
precisely marked, the connection between E-Prime® and 
the software that allows data collection (g.Nautilus®) was 
made. 
To 
accomplish 
this, 
E-Prime® 
has 
been 
parameterized to send a signal each time the checkerboard 
pattern 
was 
reversed 
(trigger 
moment). 
The 
parameterization was based on the instructions in the 
g.Recorder© - Parallel Port QuickStart script V5.16.00 
referring to g.Nautilus® software. As for the acquisition 
rate, it was defined that it would use 250 Hz due to the 
equipment specifications. 
B. 
Data collection procedures 
The electrophysiological measurements were done with 
the infant on the parent's lap and using the infant's 
binocularity. Related to the VEP, the data collection was 
done using the g.Nautilus® software, whose equipment 
consists of a cap with 32 active channels. In the present 
study, the international 10/20 electrode placement system 
[6] was used, and the electrodes corresponding to PO7, 
PO8, Oz, Cz, Fz, and ear lobe, as reference electrode, are 
recorded. After placing the correct size cap, Sigma Gel was 
distributed over the electrodes to reduce the impedance, 
measured with the g.NEEDaccess® - Demo Client 
software. Considering that active electrodes were used, it 
was defined that the collection of the signals was ready to 
be done when the impedance of all the electrodes was less 
than 30 kΏ.  
Regarding the EDA, the data collection was performed 
with Biosignalsplux®. To measure the electrodermal signal, 
an EDA sensor, including two channels was used, with two 
electrodes attached to it. The acquisition rate was defined at 
500Hz, in order to collect as much information as possible. 
This methodological option was taken since this is an 
exploratory study. 
On the computer, Opensignals®, a software that allows 
the observation of the data collected with Biosignalsplux® 
in real time, was required. The data was acquired via 
Bluetooth communication and archived in “.txt” and “.h5” 
formats. Identical to the collection for VEP, for the study of 
EDA, the aforementioned visual stimulus created with E-
Prime© was used.  
Since the correct processing of the signal depends on 
marking the exact moment of the presentation of each 
stimulus, a connection was made between E-Prime and 
Opensignals in addition to the link between E-Prime and 
g.Nautilus already mentioned. For EDA, the connection 
between the two software programs was achieved using a 
socket, as suggested in the E-Prime Guide [23], and triggers 
were placed at the beginning and end of the stimulus 
presentation. For the further processing of the signal, this 
placement was taken into account and, with the use of the 
file saved by g.Nautilus®, it was possible to access the 
remaining triggers (obtained each time the checkerboard 
pattern was reversed). This parametrization was chosen 
since having the exact trigger moment for both connections 
(E-Prime®-Opensignals® 
and 
E-Prime®-g.Nautilus®) 
showed some incompatibilities. 
C. 
Processing signals methodologies 
For both VEP and EDA, signal processing was 
performed with MatLab® software.  
For VEP, the signal processing started with removing 
the direct current component by subtracting its own average 
from each signal. Then, to improve the signal quality, it was 
decided to apply a filter prior to the average of the signal 
epochs corresponding to each stimulus. Based on previous 
studies using Butterworth filters [24] and filters with cut-off 
frequencies between 2.5 Hz [25] and 30 Hz, [26] the choice 
fell on: 
• used the Filter Designer tool provided by MatLab® to 
design the filter; 
• applied for a 4th order Butterworth bandpass filter with 
cut-off frequencies of 2 Hz and 30 Hz; 
• applied the filtfilt function to prevent signal delay after 
the filter application.  
 
Finally, the signal was divided into 120 epochs, each 
corresponding to a reversal of the checkerboard pattern. 
Therefore, for the entire evoked response to be visible, the 
cuts performed on the signal must be done a few 
milliseconds before and after the exact moment of the 
stimulus. In this way, the moments immediately prior to the 
application of the stimulus (baseline) are observed, as well 
as the total response to the stimulus that is prolonged in 
time. Thus, it was decided to cut the signal 100ms before 
and 700ms after viewing the pattern reversal. Consequently, 
these epochs were averaged by adding them and dividing 
them by the number of epochs.  
As the result continued to present a lot of noise, the 
application of a low-pass filter was studied [27] and created 
again with the Filter Designer application and with the 
specification:  
• applied with the filtfilt function; 
• a 4th order low-pass Butterworth filter with a cut-off 
frequency of 10 Hz.  
To make visualization of VEP formation more intuitive, 
an interface was created with the GUIDE tool provided by 
34

MatLab®. From left to right, the first graphics on the 
interface show the signal obtained considering only the first 
20 seconds, then considering 40 seconds and continuing to 
increase the time window until the final result. The 
remaining graphs show the evoked responses corresponding 
only to specific 20-epoch plots of the signal. The method 
described above was tested in adults, and the results showed 
that the algorithm developed effectively processed the VEP. 
However, for some children, it was found that the signal 
was still contaminated with artifacts. Knowing that the 
standard deviation can be used for artifact’s detection [28] 
and testing threshold values, the method chosen was to 
eliminate the segments whose standard deviation was 0.6 
times higher than the standard deviation of the signal 
segment, being this value heuristically found. 
Since the EDA signal is composed of two different 
components, phasic and tonic [29], it was helpful to analyze 
them separately. This was performed using Ledalab©, a 
Matlab© toolbox that allows the decomposition of the 
signal and extraction of some parameters from the phasic 
component, which has information related to response to 
the stimulus. The signal processing began by reading the 
.txt file extracted from Opensignals® and the .hdf5 file 
from g.Nautilus®. The next step consisted of converting the 
raw data and downsampling the result data from 500 Hz to 
100Hz to facilitate its analysis in Ledalab®. Next, a moving 
average filter, with a window of 50 sample points, was also 
applied to smooth the signal without losing relevant 
information. After this, Ledalab® was executed with two 
files: a file containing the converted values of EDA as input 
and the file with the trigger moments information, created 
with the g.Nautilus® software. The separation of the two 
components, phasic and tonic, was performed using the 
Discrete Decomposition Analysis [30], as it allows the 
individual study of each electrodermal response and 
presents a detailed time discretization. From this step, a 
graph like the one represented in Fig. 2 is obtained. 
Figure 2: Result from non-negative deconvolution. It is possible to observe 
the separation between the tonic EDA, in grey, and the phasic EDA, in 
blue. The red lines represent the recorded trigger moments. 
 
Afterward, parameters such as the number of responses, 
latency time, amplitude, area, and conductance level were 
extracted, only the responses in a time window of 0.5s to 1s 
from each stimulus (to extract specific responses to the 
stimuli before the next one occurs as mentioned previously 
the reversal rate is 1s) and with amplitude above 0.01 μ𝑆 
[31]. 
D. 
Sample characterization  
The present pilot application was conducted with two 
preterm born infants (P.1 and P.2), followed by an 
outpatient development appointment of Dr. Alfredo da 
Costa Maternity. The two female infants in the pilot study 
did not have major lesions (periventricular haemorrhage 
grade III or plus and /or retinopathy of prematurity grade III 
or more in cranial ultrasound done at age equivalent at 
term). Participant n. 1 was 30 weeks and 6 days of 
gestational age, 1945g birth weight and 4 months corrected 
age at data collection time. Participate n. 2 was 24 weeks 
and 5 days of gestational age, 685g birth weight and 6 
months corrected age at data collection time. 
III. RESULTS PRESENTATION AND ANALYSES 
In 
Fig 3, one can see an example of the 
electroencephalographic data recorded before, during and 
some time after the presentation of the stimuli. The epochs 
marked by a green bar were used to calculate the average 
and obtain the evoked potentials waveforms. The epochs 
marked by a red bar were removed since they were 
contaminated with artifacts. Given the results, we can 
conclude that, in both infants, most artifacts were found at 
the beginning and the end of the measurement, which could 
match the periods when they are still focusing on the 
stimulus and when they are tired of looking at it.

epochs were included in the processing, and red epochs were excluded as 
artifacts) 
 
The overview of the VEP results is presented in Fig. 4. 
Considering that P100 is one of the typical waveforms 
resulting from visual stimuli [6] in Table I, one can find the 
specific amplitude and latency of P100 obtained in PO8 
electrode. In the following graphs, samples were converted 
to time for better understanding. As expected, latencies for 
the older child are lower, as her visual system is more 
mature [32]. It is also worth noting that the shape of the 
potentials for the two infants is "larger" than would be

predicted for an adult, which is in agreement with the 
consulted literature [4] [7].

Figure 5 shows the VEP change (blue line) during sample 
collection for the 6-month-old infant using the GUIDE 
interface. It was found that beyond 80 stimuli presented the 
result did not vary appreciably. As for the various plots of 
20 epochs, there were some differences in their shape, 
probably due to changes in the state of attention.

for a 6-month-old infant with vertical lines to mark the stimulus 
presentation (black) and the ideal P100 latency (blue). Each graph 
corresponds to adding 20 epochs to the signal processing from left to right. 
 
The arousal state is one of the behavioral characteristics 
that could influence good-quality pattern VEP recordings 
[4]; this is why the present data were collected when infants 
were cooperative and calm. In that way is expected that 
negative components preceding and following the positivity 
appear at 2-4 months of age, and the waveform is adult-like 
by 68 months of age [10]. 
The methods previously described for the EDA were 
applied to the same preterm female infants for VEP. The 
parameters extracted from Ledalab© for both infants can be 
seen in Table II. However, due to the lack of reference 
values for these parameters in infants using visual stimuli in 
the current literature, it is not feasible to draw compelling 
conclusions with just this pilot application. 
 
TABLE II – PARAMETERS EXTRACTED FROM LEDALAB FOR 
BOTH PARTICIPANTS 
 
Still, these two pilot applications already show some 
evidence conforming to what was expected according to the 
results obtained for other types of stimulation. Namely, the 
older infant presents a higher number of responses to the 
stimuli, a lower amplitude [33], a lower latency time [34], 
and a higher skin conductance level [35] in comparison to 
the younger one. These are all related to the maturation of 
the nervous system and, consequently, greater reactivity to 
the stimuli. 
Those preliminary results align with a previous study 
that proposes pattern VEP as a valuable technique for 
monitoring visual development in preterm infants using 
corrected age [7]. The continuity of the study allows the 
build of a database with healthy preterm born visual 
development that could be compared with typical 
development. The early data from VEP and EDA could 
probably function as a physiological marker to detect some 
fragility when development is not following a typical 
stream.  
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The pilot application showed that this experimental 
setup could be used to study VEP and EDA in infants, 
helping compare recordings from different age groups.  
The experiment and algorithm developed by the 
research group allow the processing of data collected with 
very young infants with low cooperation capacity. The 
results proved that one could find significant differences in 
premature infants with an age difference of 2 months. 
Moreover, this experiment has shown that visual stimuli 
affect visual and electrodermal responses that can be 
corresponded to the infants' age. Thus, the combined 
analysis may correlate more effectively with infant 
development. Although the reduced sample size may be a 
limitation, the results show that the procedures implemented 
apply to young participants. Furthermore, the algorithm 
developed allows for noise remotion and reliable data 
analysis.  
After this experimental protocol and setup testing, the 
research team is prepared to integrate the data collected

with this electrophysiological setup with other clinical and 
developmental data. This way, it is possible to do a holistic 
assessment with longitudinal collections of signals in 
premature and full-term infants to compare the two groups 
and their evolution over time. In addition, this procedure 
allows the integration of data from statistically significant 
sample sizes in biomedical health records in children's 
healthcare systems.
