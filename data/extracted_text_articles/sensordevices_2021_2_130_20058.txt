Abstract— Indoor navigation is hardly managed by the usual 
Global Positioning System (GPS) due to the strong attenuation 
of signals inside the buildings. Alternative based on RF optical, 
magnetic or acoustic signals can be used. Among the optical 
technologies, Visible Light Communication (VLC) provides 
good position accuracy. The proposed system uses commercial 
RGB white LEDs for the generation of the light, which is 
simultaneously coded and modulated to transmit information. 
The receiver includes a multilayered photodetector based on a-
SiC:H operating in the visible spectrum. The positioning 
system includes multiple, identical navigation cells. Inside each 
cell, the optical pattern defined by the VLC transmitters 
establishes specific spatial regions assigned each to different 
optical excitations, which configures the footprint of the 
navigation cell. Demodulation and decoding procedures of the 
photocurrent signal measured by the photodetector are used to 
identify the input optical excitations and enable position 
recognition inside the cell. The footprint model is characterized 
using geometrical and optical assumptions, namely the 
Lambertian model for the LEDs and the evaluation of the 
channel gain of the VLC link. An algorithm to decode the 
information is established and the positioning accuracy is 
discussed. The experimental results confirmed that the 
proposed VLC architecture is suitable for the intended 
application.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Indoor positioning can be addressed by several 
techniques, such as Wi-Fi, Assisted GPS (A-GPS), Infrared, 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and many other 
technologies [1][2]. The ubiquitous presence of indoor Light 
Emitting Diodes (LED) based lighting systems enabled 
Visible Light communication (VLC) as an attractive 
technology to perform such task. Furthermore, enhanced 
accuracy is an additional added value to this solution. VLC 
is a technology based on the use of visible light in the THz 
range, extending from 400 nm up to 750 nm [3][4]. VLC 
systems use modulated LEDs to transmit information taking 
advantage of ubiquitous, energy efficient white LED infra-
structures, designed primarily for lighting purposes [5]. Due 
to its characteristics, LEDs [6] can be switched very fast to 
produce modulated light in high frequencies, allowing data 
transmission in high speed. Consequently, this free-space, 
wireless optical communication technology is attractive to 
address the growing need for energy saving and speed 
network data transmission [7][8]. As the technology is 
mainly related to energy saving lighting sources it uses 
mostly white LEDs [9][10], either based on blue emitter 
coated with a phosphor layer or based on tri-chromatic 
emitters. The phosphor-based LED typically consists of a 
blue LED chip covered by a yellow phosphor layer. 
However, when this phosphor-based LED is used for VLC, 
the modulation bandwidth is limited by the long relaxation 
time of the phosphor; hence limiting the transmission 
capacity of the VLC. The increase of the LED modulation 
bandwidth, can be achieved using a blue filter before the 
receiver unit to eliminate the slow-response of the yellow 
light component [11][12]. The tri-chromatic LEDs are more 
expensive but provide additional bandwidth as three 
communication channels can be used by independent 
modulation of each chip of the monolithic device.  
The receiver unit of VLC systems usually include based 
silicon photodiodes, as these devices operate in the visible 
region of the spectrum. Several applications of VLC 
systems are currently being developed, spanning from low 
data rate applications such as indoor positioning and 
navigation to more demanding bandwidth applications like 
multimedia streaming or internet access points [13][14]. 
In this paper we propose the use of a multilayered a:SiC:H 
[15] device to perform the photodetection of the optical 
signals generated by white trichromatic RGB LEDs [16], 
[17]. The system was designed for navigation [18][19], and 
the emitters of each white LED were specifically 
modulated at precise frequencies and coding bit sequences 
[20][21].  
The proposed lighting and positioning/navigation system 
involves 
wireless 
communication, 
computer 
based 
algorithms, smart sensor and optical sources network, which

constitutes a transdisciplinary approach framed in cyber-
physical systems. 
The paper is organized as follows. After the introduction 
(Section I), the VLC system architecture is presented in 
Section II. In Section III, models for the footprint 
characterization using both geometrical and propagation 
assumptions are analyzed. In Section IV, the communication 
protocol and the encoding/decoding techniques are analyzed 
and discussed. At last, conclusions are addressed in Section 
V. 
II. 
VLC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
In the proposed VLC system, the transmitter is 
composed of white RGB LEDs that code the information 
and modulate the emitted light and of a receiver with a 
photodiode that measures the modulated signal from the 
transmitted light and decodes information through a 
dedicated algorithm for data analysis. The transmitter and 
the receiver are physically separated from each other, but 
connected through the VLC channel. In this solution we 
work in line of sight conditions using the atmosphere as 
transmission channel. 
A. 
VLC Transmitter 
The transmitter proposed in this VLC system uses 
ceiling lamps based on commercial white LEDs. with red, 
green and blue emitters (w-RGB LEDs). Each ceiling lamp 
is composed of four white LEDs framed at the corners of a 
square (Figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1. Configuration of the VLC emitter with 4 RGB white LEDs. 
The luminous intensity of each emitter is regulated by 
the driving current for white perception by the human eye 
and the divergence angle is around 120º. 
On each corner only one chip of each white LED is 
modulated 
for 
data 
transmission 
carrying 
useful 
information. The other emitters of the LED are only 
supplied with DC to maintain white color illumination. Red 
(R; 626 nm), Green (G; 530 nm), Blue (B; 470 nm) and 
violet (V; 390 nm) LEDs, are used [22]. 
B. 
VLC Receiver 
The receiver is a pinpin photodiode that transduces the 
light into an electrical signal able to be demodulated and 
decoded. This device is a monolithic heterojunction 
composed of two pin structures based on a-Si:H and a-
SiC:H built on a glass substrate and sandwiched between 
two transparent electrical contacts. The intrinsic absorber 
materials of both pin structures of the photodiode were 
designed to enable separate detection of short and long 
visible wavelengths. The front, thin pin structure made of a-
SiC:H exhibits high absorption to short wavelengths (blue, 
and green light in this case) and high transparency to the 
long wavelength (red light). In opposition, the back, thicker 
pin structure based on a-Si:H absorbs only long wavelengths 
(green and red). The device selectivity is tuned externally 
using reverse bias (-8 V) and optical steady state 
illumination of short wavelength (400 nm). 
III. 
FOOTPRINT, ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING MODEL  
The lamp configuration at the ceiling constitutes a basic 
unit 
illumination 
infrastructure 
and 
defines 
a 
communication cell, which coverage will be discussed in 
next sections. 
A. 
Footprint definition and geometrical characterization 
Each lamp with this configuration constitutes a 
navigation unit cell) inside which the coverage of the 
modulated light allows the characterization of different 
spatial regions assigned to specific illumination patterns. 
This provides higher accuracy inside the cell for the position 
determination, and enables the concept of footprint inside 
the navigation cell (Figure 2). To provide wider illumination 
and communication signal coverage, several VLC emitters 
must be placed in adjacent positions, defining thus adjacent, 
independent navigation cells. To provide wider illumination 
and communication signal coverage, several VLC emitters 
must be placed in adjacent positions, defining thus adjacent, 
independent navigation cells. 
 
 
Figure 2. Configuration of the unit navigation cell. 
In this model, we will assume that each white LED cone 
of light overlaps in the central region of the square. In the 
lateral and corner parts, this intersection is partial due to the 
radiation patterns superposition of the closest two or three 
LEDs [ 23 ]. Outside the square, distinct optical regions 
correspond also to different spatial regions, with the 
presence of a single red or blue signal or of two signals (red 
and blue, or two red or two blue signals). Consequently, the 
area covered by the different optical excitations will vary 
along the navigation unit cell (Figure 3).

The central region, labeled β results from the overlap of 
the emitted light from the two red emitters, two blue 
emitters and four green emitters, while the α region at the 
corners holds the optical excitation of three green emitters 
and two blue and one red, or two red and one blue emitter. 
At the γ and γ’ regions the optical pattern is due to two 
emitters (two green emitters and two blue or two red 
emitters or one red and one blue emitter). Regions δ and  
include the irradiation pattern from one single white-LED, 
i.e., light from one green emitter and from one red or blue 
emitter. Regions of the navigation cell not covered by any 
irradiation pattern, correspond to “dark” regions, where the 
photodetector will not be able the perceive the position.  
 
 
 
Figure 3. Diagram of the radiation patterns within each navigation 
unit cell. 
As can be depicted from Figure 3, the area covered by 
each irradiation pattern can be evaluated using simple 
geometrical considerations. This was computed integrating 
the shadowed area of each region, assuming a circular 
irradiation flux for each emitter of radius r.

These values allow the evaluation of the accuracy on the 
determination on the spatial resolution of the positioning 
system. The dark zones of the navigation unit cell 
correspond to nearly 10% of the covered area. The region 
confined to a narrower area is the α region, resultant from 
the irradiation pattern of three LEDs, followed by the 
central region (β) where the four LEDs contribute. Regions 
with poorer resolution are  + ’ and + δ, assigned 
respectively, to optical signals from two and one LEDs. 
 
B. 
Footprint characterization based on the LED 
propagation model 
LEDs are modeled as Lambertian source where the 
luminance is distributed uniformly in all directions, whereas 
the luminous intensity is different in all directions. The 
luminous intensity for a Lambertian source is given by the 
following equation [24]: 
𝐼  = 𝐼𝑁 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑚() 
(10) 
 
 
where m is the order derived from a Lambertian pattern, IN 
is the maximum luminous intensity in the axial direction 
94

and ,  is the angle of irradiance. The Lambertian order m is 
given by: 
𝑚 = −
ln⁡(2)
ln⁡(cos⁡(1/2)) 
(11) 
 
As the half intensity angle 
) is of 60º, the Lambertian 
order m is 1.  
The light signal is received by the WDM photodetector 
that detects the on/off states of the LEDs, generates a binary 
sequence of the received signals and convert data into the 
original format. For simplicity, we will consider a line of 
sight (LoS) connection for both VLC links, which 
corresponds to the existence of straight visibility between 
the transmitter and the receiver. In Figure 4 it is plotted the 
geometry of the transmitter and receiver relative position, 
with 
emphasis 
to 
the 
main 
parameters 
used 
for 
characterization of the LED source and the photodiode 
receiver (angles of irradiance and illumination, transmitter’s 
semi-angle at half-power and field of view). The Lambertian 
model is used for LED light distribution and MatLab 
simulations are used to infer the signal coverage of the LED 
in the illuminated indoors space [25].  
 
 
Figure 4. Transmitter and receiver relative position.  
The link budget of the VLC link is evaluated computing 
the gains and losses along the propagation path of the light. 
It uses the channel gain of the link, which includes the 
losses due to the path and to wavelength in free space, as 
well as the spatial delivered power distribution by each 
emitter. The channel gain (G) is given by equation [26]:  
 
𝐺 =
 𝑚 + 1 𝐴
2𝜋𝐷𝑡−𝑟
2
𝐼𝑁cos𝑚  cos 𝜃  
(12) 
 
where A is the area of the photodetector. 
The evaluation of the channel gain allowed the 
establishment of the coverage map, that is illustrated in 
Figure 5. Only high accuracy footprints of the navigation 
cell are displayed. Each footprint region labelled as #1, #2, 
…, #9 are assigned to the correspondent optical excitation 
illustrated on the right side of Figure 5.

emitters.  
The use of the propagation model confirmed the 
theoretical prediction (Figure 3) and demonstrated the 
existence of distinct regions inside the navigation cell, that 
are assigned to the footprint [27], [28]. 
C. 
Coding and modulation 
Data 
is 
converted 
into 
an 
intermediate 
data 
representation, byte format, and converted into light signals 
emitted by the VLC transmitter. The data bit stream is 
directed into a modulator that uses an ON–OFF Keying 
(OOK) modulation. Here, a bit assigned to one (1) is 
represented by an optical pulse that occupies the entire bit 
duration, while a bit set to zero (0) is represented by the 
absence of an optical pulse. The data format used to transmit 
information, namely, the length of the frame, the blocks that 
make part of the word in each frame and its contents must 
be known by the transmitter and receiver to ensure proper 
coding and decoding. In order to ensure synchronization 
between frames, two blocks labelled as Start of Text (SoT) 
and End of Text (EoT), are placed respectively, at the 
beginning and end of the word. The SoT is composed of two 
idle bits (logical value 1) and two start bits (logical value 0), 
which corresponds to the 4-bits word 1100. The EoT block 
is composed of two stop bits (logical value 0) and two idle 
bits (logical value 1), which corresponds to the 4-bits word 
0011. 
D. 
Decoding strategy 
Based on the measured photocurrent signal by the 
photodetector, it is necessary to infer the correspondent 
footprint. For this purpose a calibration curve is previously 
defined in order to establish this assignment. In Figure 6 it is 
plotted the calibration curve that uses 16 distinct 
photocurrent thresholds resultant from the combination of 
the 4 modulated signals from the white VLC emitter. The 
driving current of each LED emitter was adjusted to provide 
different levels of photocurrent.

The correspondence between each footprint and the

correspondence to the output signal and an accurate 
decoding of the transmitted information.  
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
In Figure 7, it is displayed the photocurrent signal 
acquired by the mobile receiver unit at two different spatial 
positions inside the navigation cell covered by RR’BB’ and 
R’BB’ optical signals, which corresponds, respectively, to 
the footprints labelled as #1 and #9. The calibration curve is

Figure 7. Photocurrent signal acquired by the mobile receiver unit at 
footprints #1 and #9 inside the navigation cell (RR’BB’ and R’BB’). The 
calibration curve is also displayed. 
 
Synchronization between frames is detected by the 
blocks SoT and EoT. In both measurements, either inside 
footprints #1 and #9 (RR’BB’ and R’BB’), the presence of 
these blocks corresponds to maximum values of the 
photocurrent, because all emitters are simultaneously ON. 
The decoding of the photocurrent levels uses the calibration 
curve to identify which emitters are active in the duration 
period of each bit. On the  right side of the graph it is stated 
the optical state assigned to each step of the calibration 
curve. The observed correspondence between the different 
thresholds of the measured signal and the steps of the 
calibration provide the decoding of the input optical signals.

CONCLUSIONS  
In this paper, a VLC system for indoor navigation was 
presented. A theoretical study on the irradiation patterns is 
presented to support the position resolution of the proposed 
system and establish the footprint of each navigation cell. 
The optical signals transmitted by the RGB white LEDs 
were fully characterized using the Lambertian model. The 
footprint was predicted using the channel gain model of the 
transmitter-receiver link. Experimental results demonstrate 
the capability of the system. Future work will comprise a 
more detailed and complete description of the decoding 
methodology.
