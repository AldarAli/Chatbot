Abstract—In this research a generic commercial Software as a 
Service (SaaS) product offered in the mobile marketplace and 
deployed in a public cloud is analyzed in order to: (i) identify 
the possibilities and limitations of the “free to try” version in 
cloud computing environment; (ii) highlight the cost of the free 
trial; (iii) determine the correspondence between the “free to 
try” version and the one available after an onerous 
subscription contract; (iv) make reference to a series of metrics 
for measuring the intention to use the application, its effective 
and real use of available resources. The paper aims to facilitate 
an educated informed adoption (or rejection) with respect to a 
mobile SaaS commercial product deployed in public cloud, 
during the free trialability period, evaluating the SaaS 
characteristics 
and 
functionalities 
jointly 
with 
some 
perceptions and measures which could arise from its active use, 
inspection and consideration.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The vast availability of mobile software applications 
exploitable in ubiquitous environment together with the 
accessibility of public shared information/opinions on the 
functionality from earliest adopters (with the rate of 
downloads) is normally utilized as the first hint for later 
adopters in the selection of an application. 
Cloud Computing (CC)[1] is defined from the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a “model 
for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network 
access…”  
The availability of specialized platforms for the 
distribution of mobile software products through the Internet 
(marketplace) 
allows 
the 
identification 
of 
different 
ubiquitous products offered through a public offer. 
The functionalities offered by search engines allow an 
easy identification of potentially valid products for mobile 
and ubiquitous environment under different types of 
platforms (e.g., Windows, iOS, Android, etc.). Information 
and opinions on the software product, the producer, the 
developer, the facilities are normally publicly accessible, as 
well as the indication of the provider's website. The 
possibility of free testing (“free to try”) is usually offered on 
products in the commercial mobile market. They can be 
downloaded directly from one or more websites free of 
charge (marketplace, supplier site, etc.). 
The free trial period, under certain condition explicated 
in this research, could be used to prove and investigate the 
characteristics of CC application and how the SaaS provider 
has implemented, incorporated or subcontracted them, within 
the public offer he advertises in the marketplace. 
Fig. 1 represent a new and unpublished graphical visual 
model image of the complexity available and the necessary 
elements for a SaaS application to be considered as cloud: (i) 
Quadrant I represents the horizontal layer of the CC service 
models; (ii) quadrant II the vertical layer of the CC essential 
characteristics; (iii) quadrant III the CC deployment models 
layer (community has been omitted for legibility) and, (iv) 
quadrant IV visualizes all possible combinations of all 
previous layers.  
The authors underline that, as in Fig. 1, all the defined 
CC essential characteristics [1] should be present or at least 
contractually available in all underlying CC service models.

Quite often, for marketing reasons and without 
considering the verticality of CC essential characteristics, the 
web-based applications advertised as cloud computing 
solution are identified as "cloud washing" [2], [3]. 
It is possible to speculate that Software as a Service 
(SaaS) products for mobile devices that are actively tested 
before engaging in an onerous contract offer a lower risk and 
error assessment than those that cannot be proven in advance 
(before the contract acceptance and payment). The use in 
probation: (i) can generate perceptions and/or preventive 
verifications deriving, even if only, from a limited basis 
usage and (ii) dependent on the degree of aptitude and/or 
knowledge of the possible future adopter. 
In this paper, the concept of trialability as "the degree to 
which an innovation can be experienced on a limited basis 
..." [4] is contextualized in the technological scope of Cloud 
Computing (CC) [1] jointly with the prospect of a free trial 
period, more often than not, offered by the SaaS providers. 
The trial period or trialability has been revealed as 
relevant for the adoption or selection of a SaaS product in 
[5]-[13]. 
The original concept of trialability [4] is analyzed, 
contextualized in the Cloud Computing paradigm [1] and 
presented here in explicit and elucidate details, not yet 
evidenced in any scientific literature to date. 
The following new and original contributions are 
presented: (i) SaaS Trialability Factor (SaaS_TFct) and its 
related “Intention of Use” experiment; (ii) SaaS Trialability 
Cost (SaaS_TCst) and considerations; (iii) extended 
graphical representation, as part of the case study validation, 
for the Potential Adoption Index (PAI) [14].  
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section II, a 
free trialability analysis of a generic mobile SaaS application 
is presented under three sub-sections: (A) concurrent 
possibilities; (B) potential limitations, and (C) mitigation. In 
Section III, a descriptive computation of the SaaS 
Trialability Cost (SaaS_TCst) related to the adopting or 
rejection process through the SaaS free trial period is 
presented. A new concept of SaaS Trialability Factor 
(SaaS_TFct) is introduced in Section IV, in order to base the 
construction of a practical model for evaluating the intention 
(to continue) to use (or reject and dismiss) a SaaS 
application, after an active and monitored free trial period, 
by a single non-SaaS-expert user and some measurements. In 
Section V, the validate model Potential Adoption Index 
(PAI) is contextualized and briefly described, for the support 
of this research, adding new graphs outcome, ready for 
interpretation, resulting from the original case-study [14]. 
The aim of this work in progress research, with the 
definition in concept of trialability contextualized in the SaaS 
service model, is to allow in real conditions, even if on a 
limited basis: (i) to anticipate evaluations (ex-ante the 
onerous subscription contract) by potential interested 
adopters; (ii) to assist in an informed subscription (or the 
decommission) of a SaaS service contract through a 
reflective/formative approach within determined constraints, 
possibilities, knowledge and available resources while 
reconciling these decisions with relevant prior research. 
II. 
TRIALABILITY CONTEXTUALIZATION: CONCURRENT 
POSSIBILITIES, POTENTIAL LIMITATION AND, MITIGATION 
In order to arrive to a detailed contextualization, the 
limitations of trialability concept, as proposed by Rogers [4] 
in the Diffusion of Innovation theory, is detailed exclusively 
in light of a generic SaaS mobile application “pay as you go” 
deployed in public clouds where the SaaS provider offers a 
free trial period, because it is possible to detect, through 
direct observation, the combined presence of concurrent 
possibilities, potential limitation, and mitigations. 
A. Concurrent possibilities 
 
The SaaS product is offered to anyone through a 
global public offering (public cloud deployment 
model) in/and through the Web (broad network 
access characteristic); 
 
A user can unilaterally access and use the program 
autonomously 
(on-demand 
self-service 
characteristic) through the network (broad network 
access characteristic); 
 
The SaaS offered during the free period:  
 
 has the same technical and functional 
features of the purchased product in case 
of subscription agreement acceptance (the 
multitenancy future in SaaS does not 
allow, still, an easy implementation of 
functional differentiation and all users 
normally use the same application [15] and 
[16]; customizations should be done 
through configuration [17]); 
 
can be used without any installation (web 
version), on any device that supports a 
web browser compatible with the SaaS 
software and/or can be installed and used 
on all mobile devices available (mobile 
version), 
compatible 
with 
the 
SaaS 
platform offered by the provider (Android, 
iOS, etc.), without any limitation in 
number (pay per use and not by physical 
device or per-seat license); 
 
The SaaS provider normally guarantees: 
 
free versions upgrades/updates also during 
the free trial period (multitenancy future); 
 
the possibility of unlimited use of the 
virtualized resources offered through the 
SaaS application (resource pooling and 
rapid elasticity characteristics); 
 
full access (in same case limited) of all 
support services offered by the provider in 
the 
exclusive 
context of the 
SaaS 
application execution; 
 
Usually the SaaS application utilization is free of 
charge during the free period also for commercial 
use even in the case of business applications (e.g., 
invoicing, accounting, etc.).

B. Potential limitations 
 
The access to the SaaS program is possible only for 
a limited number of users (typically one), but all 
authorized users (typically one) can alternatively be 
connected via any of the compatible devices they 
have availability (mobile and/or web version); 
 
Virtualized resources provided could be limited 
during the trial period; 
 
Same technical or functional features of the SaaS 
product could be available only after the subscription 
agreement acceptance and the payment of a fee (e.g., 
add-ins, extended functionalities, etc.); 
 
Normally the use of the trial application is free only 
during a delimited timeframe (generally trial period 
could be 15-30 consecutive days from the initial user 
registration). 
C. Mitigations 
Moreover, it is possible to mitigate the above limitations 
with a self-administration possibility option to request in on-
demand self-service mode, upon payment of a certain sum, 
calculable and calculated before accepting the contract, any 
number of users and/or resources and/or features offered by 
the provider, for an established minimum period of time 
(days, month, year, etc.) with the assurance of termination 
(even in advance but with possible penalties), through the 
same contractual terms and conditions previously known and 
already subscribed. 
With the above, greater precision was sought, based on 
the same definition used in the field of scientific literature 
and still maintaining the original limitations proposed by 
Rogers [4] “on a limited basis", with exclusive reference to 
the trialability only in the innovation context introduced by 
the Cloud Computing paradigm with commercial “pay as 
you go” SaaS application deployed in public cloud that 
offers a free trial period. 
Note that SaaS product offered in the marketplace, 
because the CC on-demand self-service characteristic, are 
normally proposed as a unilateral closed public offer. The 
adopter has only the chance to opt-in only if (additional or 
alternative) options are offered (e.g. personalization of SLA, 
emergency plan, different IaaS provider, different levels of 
support, etc.), by the SaaS provider, during the contract 
subscription phase or after, altering or renovating, the 
original contract and solely in on-demand self-service mode. 
In a more general and abstract level of interpretation, it is 
possible to sustain the thesis that a SaaS provider may create 
a sense of trust in a potential client by (just only) manifesting 
an intention to create it (free SaaS trialability or free trial 
with few and fixed formalities). This level of trust can so 
indirectly be experienced, by using and testing the SaaS 
application “on a limited basis” by the potential client and, 
eventually, with and through the provider support services 
and information offered upon request or published on the 
web. 
III. 
SAAS TRIALABILITY COST (SAAS_TCST) 
The “free” trial actually has some hidden, but still 
identifiable and, evaluable costs for both the SaaS provider 
and the potential customer. 
On the provider's side: (i) he offers the use of the SaaS 
program (intellectual creation) free of charge; (ii) he is 
responsible and accountable for the costs incurred in the 
virtualized environment used (or pays the subcontracted IaaS 
provider) and related support services; (iii) so that potential 
customers can experience the application's features in 
advance and “free” of any cost for their use during the trial 
period. 
The potential client invests his time and, consequently, 
his money to evaluate the program. 
In a very synthetic way and without pretending to present 
an exhaustive generic case, but in a clarifying way for our 
purpose, it can be pointed out that the most obvious elements 
when it comes to knowing the costs of a SaaS trial are here 
briefly mentioned. The SaaS Trialability Cost (SaaS_TCst) 
or the cost of the free application trial period should consider 
for the SaaS provider, the sum, during a limited timeframe, 
of: 
 
the temporary use of intellectual creation (or non-
depreciation cost for a specific timeframe); 
 
the effective use of virtualized resources (IaaS and 
measured service – essential characteristic); 
 
the effective support/aids provided to the test user 
from the provider support service representatives; 
for the potential customer, the sum of: 
 
the effective time of use of the SaaS (measured 
service – essential characteristic); 
 
learning time to use the program (e.g. Website 
inspection, self-learning, emails/calls to provider 
customer support); 
 
time for any further inspection and obtaining any 
necessary additional information (including waiting 
time for provider support issues reply and incidents 
resolution); 
multiplied each one of the above, by the hourly cost 
dedicated to these activities. The total time is also a 
function of the physical and mental effort, considered as 
sufficient, by the user, for the evaluation of the SaaS 
product. 
The in-depth analysis of the software test can, in this 
way, be adjusted for each potential customer, depending on 
the degree of interest or application requirements, in order to 
ensure: (i) a balance between the economic cost of the 
strategic choice; (ii) the time dedicated to the inspection/ 
learning/assessment activities and (iii) the physical and 
mental effort required for these activities. And all this, within 
a free timeframe limited by the SaaS application provider 
(SaaS Trialability period). 
In other words, it can be said that the cost of a "free trial" 
of a SaaS program (or the SaaS_TCst) represents a 
measurable investment (hidden and for consideration) 
distributed among the parties (SaaS application provider and 
potential customer).

It is also possible to identify the value at margin 
(separation point between acceptance and repudiation), at a 
given moment in time, of a SaaS application for a generic 
user, deriving from the total utility generated equal to the 
cost of the physical and economic components necessary to 
allocate and execute the application on the mobile device, at 
a level of use considered by her/him to be minimally 
adequate and/or free of efforts. 
For a detailed Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) approach 
of Cloud Computing services the proposed TCO method in 
[18], where a mathematical modeling of cost types is 
introduced along with a case study, could be used mutatis 
mutandis for additional rationale. 
IV. 
SAAS TRIALABILITY FACTOR (SAAS_TFCT) AND 
“INTENTION OF USE” WITHIN MEASURED SERVICE CC 
CHARACTERISTICS FOR A SINGLE NON-SAAS-EXPERT USER 
In paid SaaS programs that offer a trial period, it is 
possible to experiment free operational features "on a limited 
basis" without others human intervention (on-demand self-
service characteristic) and autonomously under much more 
extensive conditions than any other forms of demo-software 
products that do not use Cloud Computing paradigm [1]. 
The degree that allows identifying the level of 
transparency, compliance and correspondence between the 
version that can be used after an onerous subscription 
contract and the free trial version is here defined as SaaS 
Trialability Factor (SaaS_TFct). The SaaS_TFct corresponds 
to 1:1 only if the limitation of the SaaS trial product is 
correlated and limited only to the number of granted users 
who can access simultaneously the application (minimum 
one user). 
In this case, where SaaS_TFct is equal to 1:1 (SaaS_TFct 
= 1:1), the trial period is fully comparable, from the point of 
view of the systems, data, information, processes, functions 
and support to a SaaS application in live operation and under 
payment contract (“pay as you go” period) for at least a 
single user.  
In fact, more often than not, SaaS providers offers: (i) the 
use of the SaaS application for trial; (ii) free of all the 
potential limitations (see Section II B) but not the number of 
users (normally one) and the time limit (established 
trialability period); and, (iii) at the same time, all available 
concurrent possibilities (see Section II A). Only when the 
three previous conditions are met the SaaS_TFct is equal to 
1:1 (“trialability on a virtually free full basis for at least one 
concurrent test-user during a no-cost time-period”). 
When the SaaS application has a SaaS_TFct = 1:1 it is 
possible to let the registered user to perform the desired tests 
while collecting additional data, in a controlled environment, 
in order to determine and measure the effective use of the 
application in terms of the amount of time and resources 
used (see the vertical layer of CC measured service essential 
characteristic in Quadrant IV of Fig. 1 crossing all 
underlying CC service models from SaaS to IaaS). 
The CC Effective Use (CC_EU) can be captured (or 
logged) in automatic mode, when/if needed, for any 
registered user accessing the SaaS: (i) at application level 
(e.g., frequency of use, duration of use, nature of use, 
number of functions or features used, etc.); (ii) at virtualized 
hardware level (IaaS) (e.g., CPU used, memory allocated, 
hard drive space used or read/write, etc.); (iii) analytically 
and; (iv) in aggregate form for statistical purpose. 
For any registered user, the SaaS provider in addition to 
“transactional use” (CC_EU at the application level), could 
collect additional data on “informational use” and 
“customer-service use” through his web site and with the 
same login credential already granted to the potential adopter 
during the trial period. 
In order to experiment if is it possible, for a single non-
SaaS-expert possible adopter, to take a preliminary informed 
adoption (or rejection) decision at individual-level, respect to 
a SaaS commercial product, inside a Business Environment 
Context (BEC), during the free trialability period through: 
 
a set of predefined data collection items in the form 
of a simple survey, administered (e.g. in a pop-up 
modality) to the specific trial user (e.g., triggered 
when he logs off the application), containing the 
measurement items for “Usefulness” (U) and 
“Perceived Ease of Use” (PEU), as described in 
“Appendix” of [19] without decompose the original 
model and maintaining the reflective/formative 
measurement, are here contextualized and reported 
from the original research, in Table I and Table II; 
 
a simplified algorithm (Fig. 2) named “SaaS 
Trialability Algorithm Simple Adoption Process in 
Business Environment Context for Single-User” 
(STASAP∩BECxSU) that describes the procedure 
and contains all essential elements for its coding; 
 
the code for a randomized STASAP∩BECxSU 
simulation 
algorithm 
using 
the 
B.A.S.I.C. 
programming language (Fig. 3); 
 
the results of a single run of the coded program 
STASAP∩BECxSU (Fig. 4); 
are here offered in order to facilitate the reader to 
perform the live experiment in auto evaluation self-
service mode of any BEC related mobile application 
she/he eventually has access to.  
TABLE I.  
MEASUREMENT ITEMS FOR “USEFULNESS” (U) AND 
“PERCEIVED EASE OF USE” (PEU) AS PER THEORETICAL CONSTRUCT IN 
“APPENDIX” OF [19] 
As soon as the collected information is inputted, it is 
possible to calculate the “Intention Of Use” (IOU) as the 
arithmetical average of all the single measurement items (as 
a sum of evaluation values for each U and PEU acquired, 
divided by 12).

TABLE II.  
MEASUREMENT SCALES FOR “USEFULNESS” (U) AND 
“PERCEIVED EASE OF USE” (PEU) AS PER THEORETICAL CONSTRUCT IN 
“APPENDIX” OF [19] 
 
If is it possible to repeat the above measurements at a 
specific point in time (in the original research [19], after the 
first hour introduction and, then, after 14 weeks), during the 
trial period, a differential could be highlighted that would 
lead to a reasoned acceptance or refusal (depending also on 
time, methods and resources used in the SaaS tests or the 
collected CC_EU related measures) making also possible 
scoreboard the review progression in each of Perceived Ease 
of Use (PEU) and Usefulness (U) measures. 
 
Figure 2.  “SaaS Trialability Algorithm Simple Adoption Process in 
Business Environment Context for Single-User” (STASAP∩BECxSU) 
Although the emerging trends of use of big data and 
powerful analytics place a new emphasis on the use of 
business intelligence as a source of competitive success, the 
here proposed experiment, and its calculated result can 
already provide a clarifying and useful solution (the 
calculated IOU). 
In fact, if the average of IOU is > 4 the probable adopter 
is prone to adopt the SaaS application; if IOU < 4 the 
probable adopter, at this point in time, is willing to reject the 
application for her/his personal use in her/his BEC.

In order to analyze and, eventually correlate in more 
detail, the final (rejection or acceptance) of IOU (calculated 
with the experimented STASAP∩BECxSU), the End-User 
Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) [20], experienced during the 
trial, could also be collected and examined (through the 
proposed measurement items and scale) with respect to 
Content (C), Accuracy (A), Format (F), Ease of use (E) and 
Timeliness (T) constructs as spelled out at p. 268 in [20], 
using the same tactic previously described for the 
STASAP∩BECxSU. Alternatively to the latter, collected 
/able CC_EU measures as: number of functions or/and 
features used (Ci); duration of each use (Tj,i); response time 
(Tj,i); output produced (Fj,i); any error reported by the 
application and/or the end-user (Ei and/or Ai); etc.; could be 
utilized/analyzed and/or integrated with the eventually 
available EUCS measures. 
V. 
POTENTIAL ADOPTION INDEX (PAI) 
In more complex BEC, where the strategic decision (in 
adopting a SaaS product deployed in public cloud) can be 
supported and integrated by an objective quality technical 
evaluation, the use of the Potential Adoption Index (PAI) 
described in pp. 145-160 in [14] and, also reported here, in 
Fig. 5, can be considered (in addition to STASAP∩BECxSU 
experiment) opportune. 
The idea of the PAI has his foundation in [21], where (in 
Fig. 2, p. 186) the authors proposed, in the suggested 
research agenda section, the business-technology framework 
to refer to different views of correlated Cloud Computing 
scientific research aspects (on business - technology axis). 
A 
PAI 
preliminary 
model 
was 
developed 
and 
subsequently presented in [22] and [23]. 
If the trialability on a virtually free full basis for at least 
one concurrent test-user during a no-cost time-period 
(SaaS_TFct = 1:1), is offered by the SaaS provider, it can be 
used, at an already explained cost (SaaS_TCst), to acquire all 
the necessary evaluations for the elements incorporated in 
the PAI model. 
The validated PAI model [14]: (i) is generic because can 
refer to any BEC oriented SaaS deployed in public cloud; (ii) 
it has been created to assist and support “Decision-Maker not 
Technically expert in CC” (DMnTeCC), in the adoption 
decisions of the most apt SaaS product (available on the 
marketplace). 
The single PAI resultant value is represented in numeric 
form (values range between 1 and 4) in which the two 
evaluations (business and technology) of all the specific 
constituent elements, converge in a weighted means, in the 
result: (i) relative importance of the DMnTeCC; (ii) quality-
related to objectively verifiable elements of the services 
offered (or potentially available) and their modalities. 
The 58 constituent selected attribute-elements are, in the 
PAI model, grouped by: (i) CC essential characteristics as in 
[1]; (ii) benefits and concerns as proposed in [24]. 
Each selected element or attribute is (i) uniquely 
identifiable; (ii) it is characteristic; (iii) it is evaluable by 
importance and quality; (iv) it is verifiable or testable and; 
(v) assigned to one or more representative groups or 
subgroups.

calculation. Source: [14] pp. 145-160. 
The technical quality assessment is carried out from a 
SaaS-Specialized-Technical-EXPERT 
(SSTE) 
on 
an 
objective basis, made justifiably (susceptible to verification 
and adequately modifiable) and, using a pre-established 
discrete fixed scale of integer values (min. 1, max. 4) on an 
average of 2.5 (valorization not available as evaluation 
value) as pp. 161-177 in [14].

Different technical assessments values, on the same SaaS 
product, may depend on the experience of the SSTE 
evaluator, the objectivity of the evaluation and, the 
reproducibility of the measurement or/and its motivated 
justification. 
The evaluation of the importance of each element is 
made by the DMnTeCC, with values that can be chosen from 
a preselected scale (usually between 1 and 10), even if this 
scale is modifiable during the assessment stage (retrofitted in 
the model, using % of the original Weight acquired in the 
case study protocol). 
Each evaluable element in the PAI model obtains a 
discrete calculated numerical representation (Weight % * 
Rating) on: (i) the relative importance for the DMnTeCC 
(Weight %) and; (ii) quality of the SaaS product for the 
SSTE (Rating); (iii) in a specific BEC. 
The PAI value synthesizes, in an aggregate and final 
result, the potential of the analyzed SaaS product with 
respect to the importance/quality attributes values in a 
specific BEC and, it provides a correct indication in itself, as 
a result of an agglomerated calculation (∑ of all Weight% * 
Rating). 
The final value of the PAI is able to synthesize a positive 
potential (for a value greater than 2.5) or negative potential 
(for a value less than 2.5) between CC essential 
characteristics, benefits and concerns in relation to the SaaS 
program and its adoption in a BEC and, still maintains its 
connotation in terms of importance originally expressed by 
the DMnTeCC (Weight %). 
The computation of the PAI is simple, although it 
incorporates clearly identified available levels of knowledge 
of the SSTE and, the explicit DMnTeCC will. 
The potential of the PAI model depends exclusively on: 
(i) the consistency of the model; (ii) the underlying 
definitions and categorizations; (iii) the selected incorporated 
component elements; and, (ii) of its controlled use both in 
professional practice and in academic settings. 
A detailed graphic analysis, that keeps in mind the 
DMnTeCC importance’s and technical qualities (carried out 
from an SSTE), could be performed following the PAI data 
collection schema in order to visualize all the available 
information. 
It is useful, now, to graphically address the relevance of 
the Potential Adoption Index (PAI) using, with a chart 
analysis, the set of evaluations within a Cartesian axis 
system, which refers to the dimensions of the importance of 
the DMnTeCC (axis of the ordinates) and the judgments on 
technical quality expressed from a SSTE (axis of the 
abscissa) as in Fig. 6, 7, 8 and 9. 
The intersection of the axes, in the average value, divides 
the Cartesian plane into four quadrants to each of which it is 
possible to associate a different meaning (see Fig. 6). 
The new graphic representation, proposed for the PAI 
model case-study, is much easier interpretable than the tables 
offered in the original research [14] and allows identifying 
groups of elements to focus to for additional consideration. 
Fig. 6 shows the scatter plot obtained with the answers of 
the questionnaire in case B with the indication of each 
characteristic element considered.

With this graphic representation, the DMnTeCC of Case 
B can now focus his attention on the I quadrant (in Fig. 6), 
with the help of what was reported by the SSTE in 
“Technical evaluation (Rating) of the analytical elements of 
the quantitative model” (pp. 161-177 in [14]) for each 
evaluation element starting with the ones that have the high 
interest value (Weight) and lowest technical assessment 
(Rating): Change of subscription fee; Redundancy in data; 
Redundancy in services; Legal protection-Liability-Out of 
business; Data disclosure-auditability; Data confidentiality–
privacy (as also highlighted in Table 28 at p. 184 in [14]). 
Same considerations can be done for Fig. 7 e 8 with the 
appropriate case differentiation (see Table 31 at p. 190 for 
case C and Table 34 p. 194 for case D in [14]). 
The PAI model and his graphical representation want to 
be an added and balanced research instrument to support the 
evaluation of SaaS products in a BCE. 
VI. 
FURTHER WORKS, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND 
SUGGESTED RESEARCH AGENDA 
The PAI data and results obtained in the three case-study 
in [14] refer to the same SaaS product, and if a sufficient 
number of cases was available they could be aggregated and 
analyzed further in conjunction of Fig. 9. In fact, it could be 
useful to address the adoption potentials of a SaaS product in 
a BEC using some analogies with the well-known 
Importance-Performance 
Analysis 
(IPA) 
model 
[25], 
originally developed in marketing research and progressively 
disseminated in social studies, with the due care. 
Further subsequent studies, if sufficient data will be 
available, could lead in revealing solid findings for later 
adopters and/or could help the SaaS providers to prioritize 
improvements to their Software as a Service product and at 
the same time conform to what is defined as CC [1]. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In the Cloud Computing service models (IaaS, PaaS and 
SaaS), the essential characteristics are inherited among these 
layers through the encapsulation of the various offered 
technological components (that can be also automated if 
previously subscribed or contracted) and could be made 
available for the benefit of the end-users. 
SaaS programs are supported on IaaS platforms and are 
normally developed through the use of PaaS platforms. 
IaaS providers in public cloud that have accredited 
platforms are few and distributed in a global geographical 
scope (e.g., Amazon Web Services; Microsoft Azure; 
Google Cloud Platform and IBM Cloud, etc.). 
Providers that offer SaaS applications can subcontract 
models of underlying services from other public cloud 
providers (PaaS or IaaS) by subscribing to the respective 
published contractual conditions in an on-demand self-
service fashion. 
The contractual conditions subscribed between different 
providers impose predetermined contractual obligations that 
indirectly influence (but could "de facto" affect) the final 
subscribers of the SaaS service.

.
When a specific SaaS service is contracted on a 
subcontracted platform, the subscriber of the application 
agrees on the use of the program, on a virtualized 
infrastructure, directly with the SaaS service provider (with 
levels of visibility and transparency most likely fragmented 
along the entire chain of supplied sub-contracts). 
The contractual and technical responsibilities, “of and in” 
the services offered by the SaaS provider are shared at 
different levels among all the actors (all involved providers 
and the SaaS customers); 
The 
complexity 
of 
evaluating 
the 
technological 
component, the contractual links and the offered services 
(incorporated or explicit), are usually underestimated or 
ignored until complications arise (e.g., malfunction, loss of 
data, unfulfilled legal responsibilities, etc.), compromising 
the effective use of the contracted SaaS service and/or the 
expected benefits. 
The availability of a free trial period (free trialability) of 
the application is, by the authors, of deep importance to be 
able to appreciate the operational characteristics and verify 
the technical and contractual components of the SaaS 
services offered by the provider before committing to a paid 
contract.  
For what reported in this paper is now possible to affirm 
that SaaS products for mobile devices deployed in the public 
cloud and available on the marketplace: (i) that comply with 
the CC paradigm; (ii) and have a SaaS_TFct equal to 1:1; 
(iii) and are actively tested (investing sufficient time and 
effort for their inspection); (iv) in a controlled and measured 
environment; (iv) during a limited cost-free trialability 
period offered by the provider; (v) have a lower risk and 
error assessment than those that cannot be tested in advance 
(before the contract acceptance and payment) but have, 
possibly, a higher initial (investment) hidden but measurable 
cost (SaaS_TCst). 
In order to sustain the letter statement, an approach based 
on diverse subjects with different level of expertise 
/responsibility and unique measurement items has been used. 
The structured approach focused on adoption evaluations 
of a SaaS product deployed in the public cloud, with 
inspection/test during the trialability period, by: 
 
single non-SaaS-expert user; 
 
decision-maker not technically expert in CC 
(DMnTeCC) jointly with a SaaS-Specialized-
Technical-EXPERT; 
using respectively: 
 
the Intention of Use construct (IOU) metrics; 
 
the Potential Adoption Index (PAI) research and 
additional graphic validation examples. 
Trialability has been here, therefore, proposed not only as 
a tangible factor of Diffusion of Innovation in CC 
environments but also as viable reasoning and learning tool 
instrument in order to acquire a deeper understanding, 
knowledge and, data source for personal and scientific 
research in the evolutionary Cloud Computing paradigm.
