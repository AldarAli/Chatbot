Abstract—Refrigeration and air conditioning systems need to 
have enough capacity to maintain the desired temperature at a 
worst-case, design load operating condition. In this paper, a 
dynamic 
analysis 
of 
a 
single-stage 
vapor-compression 
refrigeration system is presented. The model is constructed by 
applying the lumped parameter approach to each component 
of the refrigeration system; the first low of thermodynamic is 
applied to individual components to determine the mass and 
energy balances; then, a linear dynamical system is obtained. 
The model is implemented by MATLAB and simulation results 
are given for comparison with real values. The results of the 
simulation match with the manufacturer’s specifications.

INTRODUCTION 
Refrigeration and air conditioning are an active and fleet 
developing technologies. These devices are closely related to 
the living standard of people and to the outdoor environment, 
due to ozone depletion and global warming.  
Mathematical modeling is the most practical way of 
studying the basic behavior of cooling cycle performance, 
the relative losses in various components and their 
interactions. Standard science and engineering formulations 
are applied to describe mathematically the basics processes 
occurring in the Vapor Compression Refrigeration (VCR) 
systems. Mathematical modeling is a step towards simulation 
optimization [1], [2]. 
Dynamic models are often classified using such terms as 
white box, gray box, or black box. The term white-box 
models refer to physics based models that are described 
using physical laws, such as conservation equations. These 
models also appear in the literature as mechanistic models or 
first principles models [1], [3].  
At the other extreme, black-box models refer to empirical 
or data-driven models, where transient experimental data is 
used to identify a dynamic model. This process is also 
known as system identification or time-series analysis, and it 
can be used to construct models in the time or frequency 
domain. In black-box model one tries to estimate the 
functional form of relations between variables and the 
numerical parameters with no need of detailed information 
about the components of the system [1], [3]. Examples of 
empirical models include regression analysis, polynomial 
curve fits and artificial neural networks. 
The bulk of modeling efforts for VCR systems are most 
appropriately termed as gray-box, due to they are largely 
based on the governing physics but including semi-empirical 
terms, such as efficiency maps, heat transfer correlations, 
etcetera, that come out from experimental test. Physics-based 
modeling paradigms include;  
 
lumped parameter approaches that capture the gross 
pressure and cooling transients qualitatively,  
 
moving boundary approaches, which model the 
dynamic variations in phase transition points, and

 
finite control volume approaches, which use 
discretized models including temperature and 
parameter gradients, in an effort to achieve greater 
accuracy [1], [3].

The dynamic modeling of VCR systems has been 
subject on interest since the late 1970s, where first principle 
models were used to describe the heat exchangers. Lumped 
parameter and moving boundary models are shown in [4]-
[6]. In [7], MacArthur initiated a series of works focusing 
on a distributed parameter formulation. Nonlinear models 
have shown good approximation [8], [9], [10], but the 
complexity level increases. Later on, in 1990s, traditional 
feedback control has been investigated [11], as well as the 
multivariable control strategy [9], [10], [12], [13]. Other 
strategies have been developed to select among the degrees 
of freedom of the control variables, so that an optimal 
operation is closely obtained [14], [15]. 
 Due to thermal dynamics of VCR systems are typically 
slower than the mechanical dynamics, the model complexity 
generally resides in the heat exchangers. Previous literature 
reviews [16], [17] indicate that most of research efforts are 
focused on capturing two-phase flow dynamics in the heat 
exchangers, seeking a balance between simplicity and 
fidelity. For the purpose of this paper, the four elements of 
the thermal system will be classified into lumped parameter 
models. Lumped parameter models refer to models that 
apply lumped parameter assumptions to the entire heat 
exchanger or to fluid phases within the heat exchanger (i.e., 
Individual lumped models for superheated vapor, two-phase 
fluid, and subcooled liquid), and the result is a set of 
algebraic and first-order ordinary differential equations to 
render a simpler model computationally. In this paper, the 
term “lumped parameter model” means that each heat 
exchanger is modeled as a single-control volume (or multiple 
control volumes for each fluid phase). Most of the literature 
in the lumped parameter classification are early efforts [3], 
[17], carrying out a computational simplicity to ensure 
feasible calculation times. These modeling efforts use few 
dynamic equations and few (lumped) parameters.  
Most of analytical models are used to simulate steady-
state performance, but leaving out the transient evolution. In 
this paper, a method for predicting the cooling performance 
of a VCR system during transient and steady-state is 
presented. The dynamic model proposed in this paper is 
similar as in [18], an advantage in this analysis is because 
the refrigeration system is simplified only four control 
volumes. 
This research is developed in CIDESI Queretaro, for the 
National Laboratory for Cooling Technologies Research 
(LaNITeF). 
The paper is structured as follows. In Section II, a review 
of the refrigeration cycle principles is shown. In Section III, 
an explanation of the linearized model of the VCR system is 
presented. In Section IV, the balance of mass and energy of 
each element of the system, as well as the four ordinary 
differentials equations modelled in Matlab Simulink, are 
presented. In Section V, the validation of the model is 
shown. In Section VI, conclusions are described. 
 
II. 
REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS 
Vapor-compression refrigerating systems used in modern 
refrigerators vary considerably in capacity and complexity, 
depending on the application. They are hermetically sealed 
and normally require no replenishment of refrigerant or oil 
during its useful life. System components must provide 
optimum overall performance and reliability at minimum 
cost. In addition, all safety requirements of the appropriate 
safety standard (i.e., IEC Standard 60335-2-24 [19]; UL 
Standard 250 [20]) must be accomplished. The fully 
halogenated refrigerant R-12 was used in household 
refrigerators for many years. However, because of its strong 
ozone depletion property, appliance manufacturers have 
replaced R-12 with environmentally acceptable R134a or 
isobutene [21]. 
Design of refrigerating systems for refrigerators and 
freezers has been improved through new refrigerants and 
oils, wider use of aluminum, and smaller and more efficient

motors, fans, and compressors. These refinements have kept 
the vapor-compression system in the best competitive 
position for household application. 
A. Refrigerating circuit 
A VCR system, in its simplest form, consists of two heat 
exchangers, an expansion valve, and a compressor, Fig. 1. 
The ideal VCR system consists of four processes:  
 
Isentropic compression,  
 
Isobaric heat rejection and condensation,  
 
Isenthalpic expansion, and  
 
Isobaric heat absorption and evaporation.

Figure 1.  Single stage ideal vapor compression cycle: schematic diagram 
[21]. 
 
Fig. 2 shows the refrigeration cycle on p-h diagram. The 
refrigerant evaporates entirely in the evaporator and 
produces the refrigerating effect. Then, it is extracted by the 
compressor at state point 1, compressor suction, and is 
compressed isentropically from state point 1 to 2. Next, it is 
condensed to liquid in the condenser, and the latent heat of 
condensation is rejected to the heat sink. 
 
 
Figure 2.   Diagram pressure (p) vs enthalpy (h) [22]. 
 
The liquid refrigerant, at state point 3, flows through the 
expansion valve, which reduces it to the evaporating 
pressure. In the ideal vapor compressor cycle, the throttling 
process at the expansion valve is the only irreversible 
process, usually indicated by a dotted line. Some of the 
liquid flashes into vapor and enters the evaporator at state 
point 4. The remaining liquid portion evaporates at the 
evaporating temperature, thus completing the cycle [21]. 
Note that energy enters the system through the 
evaporator (heat load) and through the compressor (electrical 
input). Thermal energy is rejected to the environment by the 
condenser and compressor shell. A portion of the capillarity 
tube is usually soldered to the suction line to form a heat 
exchanger. Cooling the refrigerant in the capillary tube with 
the suction gas increases the capacity and efficiency. 
A strainer-drier is usually placed ahead of the capillary 
tube to remove foreign material and moisture. Refrigerant 
charges of 150 g or less are common. A thermostat (or cold 
control) cycles the compressor to provide the desired 
temperatures in the refrigerator. During the off cycle, the 
capillary tube allows pressures to equalize throughout the 
system [21], [22]. 
III. 
ANALYSIS OF THE LINEARIZED MODEL 
Fig. 3 summarizes the thermodynamic model of 
commercial VCR system. The internal temperature of the 
cooler is a function of the angular speed of the compressor 
motor and the high temperature of the coolant, which can be 
obtained from the condenser model. It can be seen the 
system has several degrees of freedom represented by: the 
speed of the compressor, the difference of the expansion 
valve, and the temperature differences of the compressor and 
the evaporator. The steam compression cooling system can 
be studied by a system of multiple input and single output 
states (MISO). 
Due to the number of degrees of freedom at the entrance 
and the singular existence of the exit, the MISO control 
systems are highly effective; however, the technological 
limitations of the devices implemented in the VCR systems 
are responsible for the algorithms developed for these 
systems to be of the single input and single output (SISO). 
 This is because commercial devices only apply the 
control action in the form of activating and disabling a 
constant speed compressor, since both the expansion valve 
area differential, the temperature differentials in the 
condenser and in the evaporator are all almost constant. 
In Fig. 3 the input signal can be a change in the angular 
speed of the compressor motor, and with regard to the 
control of these devices, several control algorithms have 
been tested for the internal temperature [2], [23]. The best 
temperature regulation results are obtained from controls 
where the thermodynamic model has been simplified but 
retaining its non-linear nature [2], [23]. If the compressor 
motor speeds are pre-calculated to keep the internal 
temperature constant in a permanent state, basic control 
algorithms such as the PID have been applied to maintain the 
speed of the compressor, whose dynamics are modeled as a 
second order system [24]. 
The technology developed and applied in most vapor 
compression systems have constant speed compressors, and 
therefore, the control of the temperature inside the cooler is 
carried out through on-off control actions [25]. Also, there 
are some applications of on-off controls adjusted according 
to the thermodynamic model defined in Fig. 3 [26], [27].

These controls have been developed to be able to propose 
algorithms for the optimization of energy consumption, 
because is the main objective to cover for most research 
groups working in the area of cooling systems. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Thermodynamic model of commercial coolers based on vapor 
compression [2]. 
 
Considering the dynamic response of commercial coolers 
based on vapor compression, various specialists have 
decided to simplify the dynamic model based on the property 
of retain heat and the thermal resistance of its barriers [2], 
[28], [29]. These models consider the evaporator element as 
a source of heat, which can extract or inject energy from the 
thermodynamic system. Thus, C is considered as the thermal 
capacity of the volume inside the cooler and, R is heat 
resistance of its barriers. The linearized mathematical model 
is established in (1).

Q(t) is the heat injected or absorbed by the source, in 
this case the evaporator. Ti and Te are considered internal 
and external temperatures, respectively. The model is easily 
recognizable as a first-order dynamic system and the 
internal temperature depends on the motor compressor 
angular speed, as shown in Fig. 4. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Linearized model dependig on the speed of the compressor  [1]. 
In the same approach of the open-loop model, there are 
several control strategies implemented to regulate the 
internal temperature, by applying a control law to manipulate 
the compressor speed.  
Such strategies are tuned considering the parameters of 
the linearized model [30], [31]. Similar analysis is employed 
to define the conditions of the hysteresis [32], [33]. 
The typical tools to model dynamics of the vapor 
compressor systems are Neural Networks [34], [35], fuzzy 
logic [36], and genetic algorithms [37], which are heuristic 
algorithms. 
Artificial intelligence techniques, such as AAN (artificial 
neural networks), fuzzy theory and expert system, belong to 
non-model method. They do not need mathematical models 
but have high adaptability. The artificial intelligence 
technique was used to predict the performance of 
refrigeration and air conditioning appliances [38], [39], [40], 
[41]. But, the unsolvable problem in using such a method is 
because of the imperfection of the artificial intelligence 
technique 
itself 
and 
the 
limitation 
of 
the 
user’s 
understanding.  
The conventional mathematical model method has been 
theoretically studied and practically applied for many years. 
With the mathematical model is more likely to ensure the 
qualitative precision of simulation than the intelligent 
method. It is a good way to combine the conventional 
mathematical method with the intelligent method together in 
order to take the advantages and to avoid the shortages of 
both methods. When the modern artificial intelligence 
techniques are combined with mathematical models of 
refrigeration systems, called as model based-intelligent 
simulation [42], the simulation software has certain 
“intelligence” for simulating the actual complex objectives 
and becomes more practical. 
With the model-based intelligent simulation method, the 
predicted result of the model can well fit the experimental 
data as its empirical coefficients can be adapted by an 
artificial intelligence module. The training task of the 
artificial intelligence module will be reduced, and the 
training speed can be accelerated if the calculated results by 
the theoretical model are used as the initial or prior assumed 
values for the artificial intelligence module. The adjustment 
process of the empirical coefficients in the mathematical 
model can be converted into the training process of the 
artificial intelligence module, and can be executed by the 
computer itself. 
In this way, less or even no artificial adjustment is 
needed in the simulation, and self-learning, self-adjusting 
and self-adapting function can be realized. On the other 
hand, the number of input parameters and the dimension of 
the artificial intelligence module will be decreased since 
many 
important 
parameters 
including 
configuration 
parameters are already included in the mathematical model. 
 Those complicated, empirical and even uncertain factors 
can be incorporated into the artificial intelligence module 
and so the mathematical model can be simplified [42].  
Fig. 5 shows the simulation process of volumetric 
efficiency with compound fuzzy model.

compressor [43]. 
 
The disadvantage of these heuristic models is that 
internal variables do not have any physical interpretation, 
although they have an effective estimation of internal 
temperature. The non-linearity influences the performance of 
the linearized model described above. 
 
IV. 
DYNAMIC MODEL OF THE VCR SYSTEM 
Henceforth, the refrigeration cycle of a reciprocating 
refrigerating system is considered a closed cycle, and the 
system is operated in steady state (i.e., in an equilibrium 
state). 
A. Energy Conservation Law 
Therefore, according to the principle of continuity of 
mass and energy balance, the mass flow rates of refrigerant 
flowing through the evaporator, compressor, condenser and 
expansion (float) valve must all be equal. In addition, the 
total amount of energy supplied to the refrigeration system 
must be approximately equal to the total energy rejected 
from the system.  
The flow is continuous, and the properties of the 
refrigerant at any point in the system do not vary over time. 
Therefore, during the design of a refrigeration system, the 
system components selected should have approximately 
equal mass flow rates of refrigerant at steady conditions [22],  
[44]. 
For the general case of multiple mass flows with uniform 
properties in and out of the system, the energy balance can 
be written (2):

with the sum of the internal energy and the work flow, u +

 and potential energy is

the elevation of the system gz. The subscripts i and o refer to 
the initial and final states, respectively. In the absence of

This relationship is based on the consideration that all

control of the four stages of the refrigeration cycle. In (3), 
r
m  is the mass of the refrigerant in circulation, cpi is the 
specific heat of the refrigerant at room temperature 
(considered constant), see Table II. QPi represents the heat 
loss or heat generated by the system, and corresponds to the 
Newton’s law of cooling, dT/dt is the cooling speed. For this 
analysis, the refrigerant temperature change is as shown in 
[45].

G. Numerical prediction 
The mathematical model obtained in the previous 
section for the prediction of the dynamic behavior, was 
programmed in Matlab Simulink. The typical values of 
input parameters are presented in Table II. The input 
parameters 
include 
refrigerant 
type, 
environmental 
temperature and the initial temperature of the compartment, 
etcetera. 
 
The values of cpi of the refrigerant were defined 
according the average of the phase in relation to p vs h 
diagram. 
 
H. Modeling 
Considering the thermodynamic cycle starts-up when the 
system is powered by the angular speed of the electric motor 
of the compressor, the flow of the refrigerant quickly tends 
to a steady state. It can be noted that the refrigerant tends to 
decrease its temperature at the evaporator element, trying to 
keep the relationship of equilibrium of pressure and 
temperature. Fig. 7 shows the behavior of the refrigerant in 
the evaporator [47].

The behavior of the refrigerant in the compressor where 
the temperature and pressure increase, the curve tends to 
rise starting from room temperature as shown in Fig. 8. 
The refrigerant follows its course towards the condenser, 
where the heat extracted from the confined spaces towards 
the environment that surrounds it is released, we can see that 
the coolant temperature is approximately the same, 
receiving compressor discharge line as it is located in the 
area of high p and t, Fig. 9 [2], [47].

V. 
VALIDATION OF THE MODELING 
In this Section, the estimated model is validated with 
specifications of the refrigerant R134a, since it is the fluid 
that is most often used in domestic refrigerators. 
The following figures show the dynamic evolution of the 
refrigeration cycle of two critical variables during 4.5 hours 
in the heat exchangers: temperature and pressure starting 
from environmental temperature; then, it approaches the 
steady state. 
Fig. 11 shows the temperature evolution in the 
compartment of the refrigerator. The model is compared with 
Embraco Data [47], using R-143a. It can be observed that 
takes about 10 minutes in the transient state, then the room 
temperature reaches the steady state condition.

Fig. 13 shows the behavior of the refrigerant temperature 
in the condenser element. The temperature of R134 reaches 
335 K in the first 5 minutes and the estimated model only 
reaches 315 K. This value is acceptable since it is above the 
environment and there is a difference greater than 7 K that 
guarantees the transfer of energy to the surroundings. 
The temperature of the estimated model is enough to 
guarantee the operation of vapor compression equipment that 
works with natural convection. If a refrigerator is considered 
to work with forced convection, this reached value 
guarantees the release of enough energy for the refrigerant to 
change of phase from gaseous state to liquid state.

The fluid maintains its relationship T and p to reach

also maintain a high pressure, 17 bars of the R134a. 
For the estimated model, the pressure of 10.5 bars is 
reached. In the case of a domestic refrigerator we observe 
that the value reached in the pressure compliance for 
optimal performance.

A good agreement between the estimated model and 
measure values from [22], [47] was observed for the whole 
period. In the evaporator, during the first 10 minutes, the 
pressure decreases from 6.5 bars to 2.2 bars, then tends to 
decrease slowly until reach the steady state operation. 
The behavior of the evolution of the cooling curve are 
similar, although there is a difference in terms of 
temperatures, however, are considered within the working 
area in the diagram pressure-enthalpy [22]. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this work, a methodology to model the dynamic 
behavior of the refrigerator has been developed. This would 
act as basis for improvements on modeling domestic 
refrigerators, using lumped transient model. The lumped 
parameter modeling will reduce the overall cycle time used 
to predict the compartment temperature, decreasing the 
experimental effort. 
The results agree qualitatively with temperature time 
evolution shown in the literature. The transient analysis of 
domestic refrigerators, 
using 
the computer program 
developed in this paper, will be further validated with 
experimental testing. An advantage of the simplified model 
here described is the possibility of using personal computer 
due to the relatively low computational effort required for 
the calculations.  
A valid starting point for the study of cooling systems 
applying state variables has been introduced in this paper. 
The first improvement strategy is a state feedback, since the 
model considers a linear approximation; however, there are 
nonlinearities, so a parameters identification algorithm and 
adaptive control strategies are required.
