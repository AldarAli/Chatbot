Abstract—Adapting the principle of natural vibrissae, artiﬁcial
tactile sensors are designed to fulﬁll the functions: object distance
detection, object shape recognition and surface texture scanning.
To realize the process of surface texture detection with an
artiﬁcial sensor, ﬁrstly a theoretical approach is done. Replacing
the natural vibrissa by an Euler-Bernoulli bending beam and
modeling the vibrissa-surface contact with respect to Coulomb’s
Law of Friction, a quasi-static scenario is performed. In this,
the support of the vibrissa moves in a way that the tip of the
beam gets pushed. Starting the movement of the support, the tip
of the beam is sticking to the surface until the maximal stiction
force is reached. It follows a period of sliding and after this a
period of stiction again. In dependence on the shape of the beam,
the relation between the quasi-static movement and the present
coefﬁcient of static friction is analyzed.
Keywords–Surface detection; vibrissae; friction; mechanical
contact; beam; taper.

INTRODUCTION
Animals, e.g., rodents and cats collect information about
the environment in various ways. They could transduce stimu-
lus of light and sound as well as tactile signals. While light and
sound are related to eyes and ears, tactile signals are recorded
by tactile hairs. The tactile stimulus represents information
about the distance to an object, as well as information about
the shape and the surface of the object. The capability of the
somatosensory system, including, i.a., the vibrissa, of rodents
etc. is high and allows to fulﬁll the mentioned functions
excellent. The concept of a vibrissa is already adapted in
several technical devices like sensor systems [1]–[3] or robots
[4]–[7]. But, the majority of existing concepts could only
differ between different surface textures. The task to detect
and classify a surface texture with a technical, vibrissa like
sensor is still challenging.
The present work focuses on the theoretical, mechanical
background of surface texture detection. Section II gives a brief
summary about the morphology of a vibrissa, the biological
view of surface texture detection and different mechanical
approaches concerning this topic. The details of the used
mechanical model are introduced in Section III. The results
of the numerical simulation are discussed in Section IV and
Section V contains an evaluation of the current state together
with an outlook.
II.
STATE OF THE ART
There are different types of vibrissae, e.g., the carpal vibris-
sae are located at the paws and the mystacial vibrissae around
the snout of the animal [8]. Because this study concentrates
on mystacial vibrissae, the general term vibrissa is used for
this kind in this paper.
The base of a vibrissa is embedded in the follicle-sinus
complex. The follicle-sinus complex is a sophisticated struc-
ture that includes, i.a. muscles, mechanoreceptors and elastical
tissue. It enables an active movement and control of the
vibrissa. The vibrissa itself is characterized by various prop-
erties. From in- to outside, there are three layers of different
thickness and material properties. The outer layer is covered
with scales. Starting from the base of the vibrissa, its diameter
gets smaller. In comparison to the length of the vibrissa, the
diameter is much smaller. Along the complete length of the
vibrissa there is a natural (unstressed) pre-curvature [9]. With
the combination of the follicle sinus complex and the vibrissa,
the animal could extract information about the distance, the
shape and the surface texture while an object is scanned [10].
The authors of [11] and [12] focus on the behavior of the
animal while surface texture detection. Using the example of
a rat, it is reported that if the vibrissae get into contact with
an object respectively surface, the rat will attempt to minimize
the deformation of the vibrissae by changing the position of its
head. Out of this state, the rat starts to move its head, following
a special motion pattern. The authors of [13] observed that the
rat repeats the scan three to ﬁve times.
There are different hypothesizes how the animals transduce
the surface properties via a tactile stimulus into meaningful
information. The vibrissa resonance hypothesis relates the
frequency of a vibrissa to a vibration that is, e.g., caused
by surface roughness while the vibrissa is swept along the
surface [14]. Analyzing a simillar idea, the authors of [15]
and [16] describe the kinetic signature hypothesis. The kinetic
signature is a temporal pattern of the vibrissa velocity that
contains information about the surface texture. A further theory
is formulated in [17]. The authors observed that the frequency
and the amplitude of the Stick–Slip occurrences vary with
different surface textures.
From the mechanical point of view, the theoretical back-
ground of these hypotheses is not well analyzed. In [18],
the vibrissa is assumed as an Euler-Bernoulli beam, with

and without a conical beam shape. This model is limited by
linear bending theory and not usable for larger deﬂections.
There is no relation between any surface property and the
used theory, only a distinction of surfaces is possible. In
[19], a ﬂexible probe represents the vibrissa and a spatial
distribution of spaces and gaps of macroscopic size the surface.
Analyzing this scenario, by using the ﬁnite element method
and considering only small deﬂections of the probe, the varying
distances of the spaces and gaps are determined. So, the
surface texture is classiﬁed by a ﬁnite number of distance
determinations of macroscopic obstacles, this ignores many
effects and do not match with smooth surfaces. Determining
forces and moments at the base of the virbissa, the initial
contact with an object is analyzed in [20]. In this case, the
mechanical model adapts various geometrical properties of a
real vibrissa, e.g., it considers a tapered and pre-curvature
(stress free) shape. The vibrissa is quasi-statical moved, until
is touches the object. This model is advanced in [21], where
dynamical properties like damping and effects of inertia are
added. But, both versions of the model are formulated as
multi-body system and do not analyze any surface properties
besides the initial contact. Again, supposing that a surface is
a spatial distribution of spaces and gaps surface textures are
investiagted in [22]. In comparison to [19], there are several
differences: The deformation of the straight, conically shaped
Euler-Bernoulli beam is a combination of a large deformation
(non-linear theory) due to a quasi-static displacement and a
small deformation (linear theory) resulting from dynamical
effects. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of friction (Coulomb’s Law
of friction) is considered in the contact point. Like in the
previous models, a relation between surface properties and
mechanical is still missing. Only macroscopic effects caused
by the spaces and gaps are analyzed.
The authors of [23] form a ﬁrst approach to analyze the
connection between surface texture properties and mechanical
reactions of the vibrissa in an complete analytical way. Fig. 1
Figure 1. The green arrow represents the direction of motion of the head of
the rat.
illustrates the assumed scenario. A rat is scanning a surface by
getting in touch with it and moving its head. First, it moves
forward (left) and afterwards it starts to move backward (right).
The vibrissae are non-stop in touch with the surface, they are
sticking to it. While the rat is moving backward the vibrissae
gets further deformed, until the coefﬁcient of static friction
µ0 is reached. After this period of sticking, it is sliding until
it sticks again. As reaction to the deformation, forces and
moments act at the follicle-sinus complex. The follicle-sinus
complex is able to encode these stimuli, in a way that the
present µ0 could be determined. Besides that, there is a speciﬁc
frequency of stick-slip events in dependence on µ0 if the rat
scans a deﬁned length of the surface. This scenario could be
adapted for artiﬁcial tactile sensor concepts. The following
simulations show the described procedure of a surface scan
and the inﬂuence of a change of the sensor shape with respect
to the natural vibrissa morphology.
III.
MODELING
Taking over some of the described structural properties in
a mechanical model, the following assumptions are done:
•
The vibrissa is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam,
with respect to large deﬂections.
•
The beam is straight and has a tapered shape.
•
The follicle-sinus complex is ﬁrstly represented by a
clamping.
•
The contact between surface and vibrissa is an ideal
point contact within the limits of Coulomb’s Law of
Friction.
•
The displacement of the support is quasi-statically.
To simplify the mathematical treatment and to be independent
of exact values for, e.g., geometrical parameters or material
properties, a nondimensionalization is performed:
units:
[length] = L , [force] = E Iz0
L2
, [moment] = E Iz0
L
,
where L as the length, E as the Young’s Modulus, Iz0 = π d4
0
64
as the second moment of area and d0 as the diameter at the
base of the beam are the representation of the basic parameters.
Using the example of a beam consisting of steel and character-
ized by the following basic parameters: E = 2.10 · 105 MPa,
d0 = 5 mm, L = 100 mm, than the dimensionless force
f = 10.86 corresponds to a real force F:
F = f · [force] = f · E Iz0
L2
= 7000 N
Furthermore,
the

length
is
given
by
L
with
L = s · [length], whereby s is the arc length:
s ∈ [0, 1]
The tapered shape of the beam is deﬁned by the diameter d(s)
as function of s, see Fig. 2:

with the taper factor θ as quotient of d0 to the diameter of the

The position of the tip of the deformed beam is located at

The derivatives of x(s), y(s) and the slope ϕ(s) results in

together with the boundary conditions (3) a free boundary
value problem with two unknown quantities.
To solve this problem, a shooting method is used incorpo-
rated into MATLAB R2016a. Starting with a guess for the
two initial values for the unknown quantities, the resulting
system of equations is solved by the Runge-Kutta-Method 4th
order using MATLAB function ode45() and an optimization
process begins. This 2d-optimization is realized by applying
the function fminsearch() integrated in MATLAB.
IV.
RESULTS & DISCUSSION
Using the mentioned algorithm, different simulations are
performed. It is assumed that the beam in the initial state
is only loaded by a vertical force. Therefore, α is equal to
zero. When the quasi-static footpoint displacement starts, α
takes negative values and the frictional force loads the tip
of the beam, too. Continuing the movement, the beam gets
further deformed. When the maximal stiction force is reached
respectively passed, the tip of the beam starts to slip.
The traveled distance between the position of the clamping
in the initial state and the last state of stiction gives the
maximal footpoint displacement x0max. So, this group of
different states of deformation of the beam is one period of
stiction. Fig. 3 shows the movement of the clamping in positive
x-direction, with a step size for the footpoint displacement of
x0 = 0 (0.001) x0max and a ﬁxed distance between surface
and clamping of η = 0.85. For a given θ = 2 and µ0 = 0.4,
x0max is determined. At every footpoint position, the forces
and moments at the clamping are determined. For a real
application, these reactions will be measured with force and
torque sensors. Out of these information, it are possible to
determine the µ0 between sensor and surface.

Figure 3. For each position of the clamping the resulting deformed shape of
the beam is illustrated.
Like in the previous simulation, the footpoint displacement
is set to an increment of ∆x0 = 0.001 and the distance
between surface and clamping to η = 0.85. The simulation
stops after nine stick-slip cycles, see Figs. 4 and 5.
Remark: To describe stick-slip cycles, it is assumed that
the period of slipping goes on until the initial condition α = 0
is reached again. In this state, a new period of sticking begins.
For each µ0, a larger θ leads to a larger distance between
start and end point of the clamping movement for one period
of sticking and also to a stronger deformation of the beam.
The comparison of µ0 = 0.3 and µ0 = 0.4 indicates a smaller
distance of the footpoint displacement and lower deformations
of the shape of the beam, for one period of sticking in the case
of µ0 = 0.3.
The distance between start and end point of the footpoint
displacement is directly inﬂuenced by the values of µ0 and θ.
This inﬂuence is important for an artiﬁcial sensor. For example,
the cylindrical shape (θ = 1) of the beam reacts very sensitive
to the footpoint displacement, see Fig. 4a.

Figure 6. The ordinate shows values for the maximal footpoint displacement
of one period of sticking and the abscissa different values of θ.The squares
correspond to µ0 = 0.2, the diamonds to µ0 = 0.3 and the triangles to
µ0 = 0.4.
Already, after a few steps there is a period of sliding. This
property is problematic for an artiﬁcial sensor because the
sensor drive has to be very accurate, else it will be impossible
to detect the periods of sticking.
When there is a tapered shape of the beam, this effect is
compensated, this is illustrated by the Figs. 4b, 4c and 5b,
5c. A disadvantage of the tapered shape of the beam is the
tendency to larger periods of sliding. For an equal quantity
of stiction periods, a larger length on a surface has to be
scanned. The relation between the maximal displacement of
the footpoint x0max, θ and µ0 is summarized for one period
of sticking, see Fig. 6. There seems to be a linear correlation
between x0max and θ for each value of µ0. But in contrast, for
larger values of µ0 the effect of a taper shape gets stronger.
This effect is analyzed in Fig. 7. There are different levels
of groups of points. Each point is equal to one combination
of x0max and µ0. The different levels are caused by the step
size of x0. The resolution of the step size of x0 is too large
to consider the ﬁne change of the values of µ0. Based on this
result, it is not possible to determine an exact trend of x0max
over µ0, but it seems to be non-linear.

CONCLUSION
The presented mechanical model of a vibrissa includes
some typical features of the natural vibrissa, like the conical
shape. Also, the approach compromises a model for the
contact between vibrissa and touched surface. With in the
limits of the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and Coulomb’s Law
of Friction, the relations between the tapering factor θ, the
maximal footpoint displacement x0max, the step size ∆x0 and
the coefﬁcient of static friction µ0 are analyzed by numeric
simulations of a quasi-static scenario.
Studying one period of sticking, a larger µ0 leads to a larger
footpoint displacement and stronger deformation of the beam.

the beam starts to slip. Out of the last state before the slipping
starts, the current forces and moments, acting on the support of
the beam, can be used to determine the present coefﬁcient of
static friction. The inﬂuence of θ and µ0 on stick-slip events is
analyzed. For the period of slipping, it is assumed that it goes
on until the initial state is reached again. The initial state is
characterized by the condition that the angle of static friction
α is equal to zero.
A larger θ and µ0 correspond to longer periods of sticking
and sliding. So, for the same quantity of stick-slip events,
a longer distance on the contact surface becomes necessary.
Also, the total number of steps of the footpoint rises. In short:
in dependence on θ a larger µ0 leads to more stick-slip events.
These ﬁndings have to be validated by an experiment in
future. Especially, the assumption in the context of the period
of slipping is critical. An experiment could also show if there
is any relation between other surface properties like roughness,
the lay or the waviness.

The mechanical model has to be improved, too. Fig. 8
illustrates the problem. In theory, this result is correct but in
reality the shape of the beam penetrates the contact surface.
That means the present approach and numeric simulation are
not able to analyze every situation in an realistic way. It is
necessary to consider a complete contact surface, respectively,
line for future simulations.
