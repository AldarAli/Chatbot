Abstract—In analysing English literary work, the distinct aims 
and objectives are to determine the authorship, period, style, 
motif, and purpose. Here, the proper evaluation of results in 
English Literature is: first, place the known literary work in a 
machine learning model and discover their patterns and styles; 
second, compare the corresponding metrics with an unknown 
literary work. Since obtaining such knowledge from human 
experts is laborious and highly subjective, we align a data analysis 
method with extensions of the Markovian representations, which 
can be generalized to more versatile descriptions as the context 
develops. In particular, we consider the simple Markovian model 
and more elaborate generalisations that aim to remove the 
limitations of the memoryless properties of the basic Markovian 
representations. The first generalisation extends the state space by 
using the Cartesian product to form the composite state space, 
while the second approach exploits the stanza structure to 
integrate the states. The first approach can incorporate arbitrary 
long-time steps but leads to a high-dimension transition matrix. In 
contrast, the second more preferable approach yields a relatively 
small dimension matrix, which is computationally much more 
efficient. In addition, the latter approach also leads itself to further 
state integration by judiciously analysing the purpose of each line 
of a passage and provides the scope for analysing much larger 
corpora.

 INTRODUCTION  
This paper extends our previous paper [1] that analysed 
English literature by using a Markov model from a pragmatic 
aspect, namely, defining authorship. Still, computer-aided 
authorship attribution can be divided into two approaches, 
pragmatic and philosophical, which are related [9]. To have 
additional contributions, this paper uses both pragmatic and 
philosophical approaches to further analyse English literature 
and its Chinese translation by using multi-step Markov chains 
and expanding memory through state integration. The additional 
contributions of this paper comprise a new philosophical 
approach, a second language in literary work, and a new 
integration method. The analysis of vast English poems and their 
Chinese translation aims to determine several attributes. Such 
tasks may be viewed from a machine learning perspective [11] 
[12] [16] [17] [20], where one learns the quantitative features of 
known passages and uses these to determine obscure passages’ 
attributes.  
Historically, a manual approach to determining authorship 
primarily relied on human experts. However, it could sometimes 
be faulty as experts must systematically process the vast volume 
of literary data. For example, one poem, ‘Stanzas’, supposedly 
written by Emily Brontë, beginning ‘Often rebuked, yet always 
back returning’, is of uncertain authorship. Although Emily’s 
sister, Charlotte Brontë, included it with the seventeen poems by 
Emily that she published in her selection of ‘Literary Remains’ 
that accompanied her 1850 edition of ‘Wuthering Heights and 
‘Agnes Grey’ [23]. 
Fortunately, unsolvable problems can be identified using 
machine learning. One positiveness brought by technological 
development is that a Machine learning approach could interplay 
and assist humans in a more complicated and challenging 
synthesis of ascertainable attributes: authorship, style, pattern, 
purpose, theme, and function. Stylometric analysis may indicate 
that a particular author’s works are structurally distinct.  
By using stochastic analysis, more efficient and reliable 
decisions can be made. Here, we shall use the Markov model’s 
most straightforward form of dependency. The advantage of the 
Markov model is that introducing some dependency allows the 
styles to be much more richly represented than the simple 
independent model. 
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section II 
provides a literature review, limitations, and achievements. Then 
using English literature examples, Section III motivates studying 
literary work through Markov chains. In Section IV, we explain 
the expansion of memory through state integration. Experiments 
on English passages and their Chinese translations are carried 
out in Section V. Finally, the paper concludes in Section VI.

RELATED WORKS 
Previously, scholars in many fields have argued and studied 
the authorship issue. The historical record shows that William 
Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon was identified as the 
person who was a player, a Globe shareholder, and the author of 
the plays and poems that carried his name. No evidence indicates

that anyone from the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods doubted 
this attribution [35].  
On the other hand, several studies focused on authorship 
analysis of English literature using Markov chain models. The 
following studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Markov chain 
models in authorship analysis of English literature and suggest 
that more complex models, such as multi-step Markov chains or 
neural networks, may lead to even better performance. 
Specifically, Koppel et al. [36] used statistical markers, complex 
multivariate methods, and machine learning-based classification 
methods to examine the authorship. The analysis shows that two 
of the most sophisticated machine learning methods, SVM and 
Bayesian regression, offer an effective and efficient solution to 
the problem of authorship attribution.  Also,  Malyutov [37] 
looked at the near-optimal method based on Kolmogorov 
conditional complexity, attributing the discovered works of 
Shakespeare and those allegedly written by M. Twain, as well as 
binary discrimination of the Federalist papers by using Naive 
Bayes and other classifiers. Segarra, Eisen, and Ribeiro [38] 
introduced a method of authorship attribution called function 
word adjacency networks (WANs), which uses function words 
as nodes and directional edges to represent the likelihood of 
finding one function word in proximity to another. These WANs 
can be interpreted as transition probabilities of a Markov chain 
and are compared using relative entropies. Since function words 
are independent of content, their use tends to be specific to an 
author, making a good summary of stylometric fingerprints. Our 
previous papers [1] [2] used iambic pentameter to characterize 
these dimensions using Markov chains. We adopt a machine 
learning approach, processing and extracting known passages to 
create a signature transition matrix. Then we use a multi-step 
Markov chain to characterize the evolution of stress levels over 
time. The model can incorporate an amount of previous stress 
level memory, making it a flexible approach.  
While Markov chains have been effective in authorship 
analysis of English literature, several limitations and challenges 
are associated with using Markov models. First, Markov chain 
models assume that the underlying data follows a stationary 
probability distribution, meaning that the statistical properties of 
the data do not change over time. However, in real-world 
scenarios, authors’ writing styles may change over time for 
various reasons, such as personal experiences, age, or exposure 
to literature. Second, Markov chain models rely on selecting 
appropriate features and parameters to accurately represent an 
author's writing style. Choosing the right features and 
parameters can be challenging and time-consuming, requiring 
domain expertise and experimentation. Moreover, most of the 
previous studies focused on monolingual literature work in 
English. This paper not only analyses the monolingual literature, 
but also compares bilingual texts and the Chinese translation of 
English literature using a multi-step Markov model. Lastly, 
Markov chain models may struggle to differentiate between 
multiple authors who have similar writing styles or who have 
collaborated on a piece of writing. Additional techniques, such 
as stylometry or deep learning algorithms, may need to be 
employed in such cases. Therefore, while Markov chain models 
have been helpful in authorship analysis of English literature, 
they are not without their limitations and further research is 
required to overcome these challenges. 
We mainly went through the following steps to achieve 
authorship analysis of English literature using multi-step 
Markov chain models. First, we collected data collection and 
gather a corpus of written works from multiple authors, such as 
William Shakespeare, the Brontë sisters, and W.B. Yeats. 
Second, we clean and preprocess the data to remove unwanted 
elements such as punctuation, numbers, or the last words. Then 
we select the representative data and extract its feature that can 
be used to represent the writing style of the author. For example, 
one or two authors could use the same rhythming patterns as 
features. Third, we train the model using multi-step Markov to 
identify each author’s writing style. Fourth, to test the Markov 
model on a validation dataset, we evaluate its ability to correctly 
identify unknown texts’ authorship. Therefore, we conduct two 
lingual experiments with the Markov chain to optimise the 
performance of the model in both monolingual and bilingual 
literature. Finally, we can use the trained model to attribute 
authorship of unknown texts with similar features to the data and 
texts we test and analyse in this paper. 
III. 
BASIC MARKOV REPRESENTATION 
Here, we illustrate the use of our approach by making use of 
some well-known poems, which are typical of similar poems.  
Charlotte Brontë has written more than 200 extant English 
poems, which remain of great interest as evidence of her 
developing ability to express emotion, her fascination with 
exotic characters and scenery, and her absorption of the 
techniques, images, and vocabulary of the poets whose work 
excited her. The poets that inspired Charlotte Brontë include but 
are not limited to William Wordsworth, William Shakespeare, 
and Samuel Taylor. Thus, Charlotte Brontë’s poems almost 
always have a rich verbal texture, but her control of their style 
and structure is often insecure, except when she fair-copies or 
revises them [23]. Fortunately, among the five poems that were 
written or edited in 1847, two were used in ‘Jane Eyre’ [26]: ‘My 
feet they are sore’ (p. 22) and ‘The truest love’ (pp. 265-266). 
English literature and poems could be differentiated from 
poetic devices, rhyme patterns, themes, and motifs. Still, the 
works written by the Brontë sisters share a lot of common 
grounds. For instance, we can see a common theme at the heart 
of all of Emily Brontë’s poetry: the desire for a unified sense of 
the self and a simultaneous awareness and fear of the self’s 
diffusion and fragmentation [24]. Likewise, ‘Jane Eyre’, written 
by Charlotte Brontë, is a story of enclosure and escape of ‘self’ 
and a story of the movement for freedom within the economic-
social and cultural context in the Victorian era [23] [25].  
Such a literary theme is rather hard to capture through a 
machine-learning approach. For example, in the first chapter 
[26], little Jane is scolded by Mrs Reed, who labels Jane’s 
actions as ‘cavillers or questioners’ and demands Jane sit and 
remain silent until Jane can ‘speak pleasantly’. To quietly 
perform the rebellious act and not be submissive, upset as little 
Jane is, she buries herself in the book entitled Bewick’s History 
of British Birds. In the introductory pages of Bewick’s book, 
little Jane finds comfort through pictures that portray the sea 
fowl inhabited by “the solitary rocks and promontories” of the 
Norway coast.  
However, it will become attainable if we break down human 
experts’ complicated and intuitive judgement into small 
elements that comprise an overall appreciation of a poem and

literature to improve. Among all the attributes, iambic 
pentameter, rhythm pattern, and phonetic stresses could be 
computer-friendly and play a key role in analysing poetry using 
a machine-learning approach. Iambic pentameter consists of ten 
syllables per line, stressing every second syllable. This creates a 
rhythmic pattern of one unstressed syllable followed by one 
stressed syllable in each pair. The rhythm pattern of iambic 
pentameter can be compared to the sound of a heartbeat, with 
each stressed syllable acting as a ‘beat’ in the poem. Phonetic 
stresses emphasise a particular syllable or word, typically due to 
tone, pitch, or volume. In iambic pentameter, the stress is 
determined by the natural accentuation and pronunciation of the 
words. 
‘Where the Northern Ocean’, the first poem in ‘Jane Eyre’, 
occurs here. This poem’s imaginative world of literature allows 
Jane’s mind to escape confinement [27].

Stressed syllables vary in strength, while unstressed syllables 
vary in weakness [4]. In this paper, we notate the stressed sound 
with a “|” marking ictic syllables and a “^” marking unstressed 
syllables. In this notation, a standard line of iambic pentameter 
would look like “^ | ^ | ^ | ^ | ^ |”, where each line of verse is 
made up of five two-syllable iambs for a total of ten syllables. 
As the meter is mainly about sound, not spelling, scansion adds 
numbers to indicate various stress levels to realize beats and 
offbeats (A = lightest stress, D = heaviest stress). Scansion is the 
analysis of regular patterns of accented, unaccented syllables. 
The arrangement of words and phrases in poetic lines reflects 
our custom of speaking, and of hearing each other speak, in a 
succession of rhythmic units; if the lines are metrical, if they 
make patterns out of series of lightly or firmly stressed syllables, 
they reflect the fact that when we speak – we speak stressed 
syllables with greater and lesser degrees of stress [4]. It is 
possible to represent the stress structure by means of a Markov 
chain and so provide a characterization of the literary work. The 
Markov matrix of the above situation, when used as a sample, 
can be constructed as where the four states indicate the stress 
levels of A, B, C, and D, respectively,

Although the English syllables we speak can be spoken with 
many degrees or shades of emphasis on loudness, sharpness, 
duration, and other ways of signalling importance, it seems 
likely that in most English speech, we perceive mainly two 
significant levels of stress, and that we hear a continuous series 
of relatively stressed and relatively unstressed syllables [4]. 
Similarly, the following

Another form of counter-lauréate authorship emerges in a 
more prominent place, Theseus’s speech in the mid-1590s 
romantic comedy A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Noticeably, 
Shakespeare’s self-reflexive revision, such as inserting 
discourse about the ‘poet’ as a company for ‘lunatic’ and ‘lover’, 
turns a speech about the madness of love into one about the 
poet’s role in forming an eternising state of consciousness [7].

Most of the poems written by the Brontës are ended with 
the rhythm of ‘abab’ pattern, such as, ‘My Feet They are Sore’ 
(p. 22) written by Charlotte Brontë in her novel ‘Jane Eyre’ [26]. 
These two poems are fair copies or revised by Charlotte Brontës 
[26], thus we can see regular poetic patterns in them. 
Specifically, in the first stanza, the last words of each line are 
‘weary, wild, dreary, child’. If each of the last words is given a 
name using alphabetic order, we name the word of the same 
rhythm with the same alphabetic letter. Here in this stanza, 
‘weary’ and ‘dreary’ are given a random letter ‘a’ because they

end with the same pronunciation of ‘-eary’, whereas ‘wild’ and 
‘child’ are given another name ‘b’ for ending with the ‘-ild’ 
sound. The same logic applies to the remaining stanza of this 
poem: cdcd (the second stanza); efef (the third stanza). ghgh (the 
fourth stanza), ijij (the fifth stanza). 
 
Stanza 1: 
My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary; (a) 
 Long is the way, and the mountains are wild; (b) 
Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary (a) 
Over the path of the poor orphan child. (b) 
d. 
‘My Feet They are Sore’ in ‘Jane Eyre’, written by Charlotte Brontë. [26] 
 
To further analyse the poem with attributes, we can now look 
at the stresses of each word in each line. In a line of a poem, a 
foot refers to either a stressed syllable or an unstressed syllable. 
Both syllables then form distinct pairs, as a musical measure 
consists of a certain number of beats. Delimitation of the spoken 
chain sounds can be based on auditory impressions, but 
describing these sounds is an entirely different process. 
Description can be carried out based on the articulatory act, for 
it is impossible to analyze the sound units in their chain [16].

The advantage of Markov models [13] [18] for analysing 
sequential data is that segmentation and classification are 
performed simultaneously in an integrated procedure. Using 
efficient and robust training and decoding algorithms, Markov 
model recognition systems can effectively be realized for large-
scale classification systems [3].  
The poem reappears in a different context when Jane and 
Rochester declare their love for each other on Midsummer Eve 
[26]. It serves a new purpose: to symbolise the to-be Mrs 
Rochester’s potentialities for freedom and happiness, as well as 
the natural affinity between her and Rochester. The poem that 
starts with ‘the truest love that ever heart’ is narrated from 
Rochester’s perspective, indicating a potential marriage and 
freedom afterwards.

Thus, the authorship may be evaluated by examining the pattern 
of entries in the transition matrix. 
IV. 
EXTENDING MEMORY THROUGH STATE INTEGRATION 
The basic Markovian representation, while useful, suffers 
from the limitations that plague all basic Markovian models in 
that the memory of any previous states is completely erased.  
However, it is possible to inject limited memory by forming 
the Cartesian product of the basic states, but this tends to be 
computationally 
prohibitive. 
In 
our 
situation 
above, 
incorporating one-step memory requires augmenting the state 
space to 16, and incorporating two-step memory requires 
augmenting the state space to 64, resulting in a 64 ⨉ 64 
transition matrix. Thus, incorporating k-step memory requires 
augmenting the state space to 4k+1 with a rather unwieldy 4k+1 ⨉ 
4k+1 transition matrix:

where each eij ≥ 0, and  
 
∑
𝑒𝑖𝑗 ≤ 1
𝑛
𝑗=1
,         i =1, 2, …, n. 
 
Here, we allow the possibility of  
 
∑
𝑒𝑖𝑗 <  1
𝑛
𝑗=1
, 
 
which can sometimes occur, especially when absorbing states 
may be suitably identified [34]. Techniques for dimension 
reduction of the above matrix have been proposed in [1], where, 
for example, a 16 ⨉ 16 transition matrix may be reduced to a 6 
⨉ 6 matrix. 
Instead of the above approach, however, we shall exploit the 
line structure in each stanza. Consider Stanza 4 of ‘My Feet They 
Are Sore’ in ‘Jane Eyre’, written by Charlotte Brontë above. We 
observe that line 1 and line 2 have the same structure, which we 
can represent by ξ, while line 3 and line 4 have the same structure, 
which we can represent by ζ. Thus, in Stanza 4, we have the 
transition structure 
 
                         ξ → ξ     (probability ⅓) 
ξ → ζ     (probability ⅓) 
ζ → ζ     (probability ⅓) 
                         ζ → ξ     (probability 0). 
 
This gives the 2 ⨉ 2 transition matrix 
 
(⅓
⅓
0
⅓) 
 
where the first state corresponds to ξ, and the second state 
corresponds to  ζ.      
Applying the same framework to the first stanza of 
Rochester’s poem, we introduce a further state λ corresponding 
to the second line of Rochester’s poem, which then yields the 
transition structure 
 
λ → ξ     (probability 3/7) 
ξ → ξ     (probability 0) 
ξ → λ     (probability 4/7) 
λ → λ     (probability 0) 
λ → ζ     (probability 0) 
ζ → λ     (probability 0). 
                         ζ → ξ     (probability 0) 
ξ → ζ     (probability 0) 
ζ → ζ     (probability 0) 
 
This will give a 3 ⨉ 3 transition matrix with all diagonal 
elements equal to 0.  
 
(
0
0
4/7
0
0
0
3/7
0
0
) 
 
While this is a more complete representation, it will be 
computationally less efficient and is only necessary when we 
need to combine the above two passages. In analyzing individual 
passages, using a 2 ⨉ 2 transition matrix may sometimes suffice, 
which on suitably defining the states, yields the following 
simpler transition matrix 
 
( 0
4/7
3/7
0 ) 
 
Following the simplified approach, the second stanza of the 
same poem yields the transition structure 
 
                             ζ → ξ     (probability ⅔) 
ξ → ξ     (probability 0) 
ξ → ζ     (probability ⅓) 
ζ → ζ     (probability 0). 
 
This gives the transition matrix 
 
( 0
⅓
⅔
0 ) 
 
Another way to avoid dealing with large transition matrices, 
judgment can be exercised to integrate the states further. In this 
way, considering large passages will be less unwieldy. From the 
recital perspective, it may be possible to merge the states ζ and 
λ and regard them as serving the same purpose. Let us map both 
states to η. Then we have the states ξ and η.  In so combining the 
two stanzas will yield the following transition structure 
                         η → ξ     (probability 6/11) 
ξ → ξ     (probability 0) 
ξ → η      (probability 5/11) 
η → η      (probability 0),

which yields the combined transition matrix 
 
( 0
5/11
6/11
0 ) 
(2) 
Evidently, this matrix is computationally much more efficient 
than the matrix (1), while the amount of memory in the 
underlying Markovian model (2) is no less substantial. 
 
V. 
EXPERIMENTATION 
In this section, we conduct two experiments: monolingual and 
bilingual experiment. In a monolingual experiment, we analyse 
English stanzas written by Emily Brontë. Whereas in a bilingual 
experiment, we first analyse an English poem, ‘Leda and the 
Swan’ written by W. B. Yeats, then compare its Chinese 
versions translated by Mu Yang and Guangzhong Yu. 
A. Monolingual Experiment  
Ranked with Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, 
and Emily Dickinson, Emily Brontë is one of the pre-eminent 
women poets of the Victorian period [23]. As mentioned in the 
introduction of this paper, the poem, ‘Stanzas’ beginning ‘Often 
rebuked, yet always back returning’, is of uncertain authorship. 
Supposedly, it was written by Emily Brontë. Charlotte 
substantially revised and retitled most of these poems, and 
editors now print Emily’s version from her manuscript (except 
in the case of ‘Often rebuked’). Charlotte clarified in her 
prefatory note to ‘Selections from the Poems by Ellis Bell’ that 
‘it would not have been difficult to compile a volume out of the 
papers left by my sisters’ [23]. 
 
Stanza 1: 
Often rebuked, yet always back returning (a) 
To those first feelings that were born with me, (b) 
And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning (a) 
For idle dreams of things which cannot be: (b) 
 
Stanza 2: 
To-day, I will seek not the shadowy region; (c) 
Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear; (d) 
And visions rising, legion after legion, (c) 
Bring the unreal world too strangely near (d) 
 
Stanza 3: 
I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces, (e) 
And not in paths of high morality, (f) 
And not among the half-distinguished faces, (e) 
The clouded forms of long-past history. (f) 
 
Stanza 4: 
I'll walk where my own nature would be leading: (g) 
It vexes me to choose another guide: (h) 
Where the grey flocks in ferny glens are feeding; (g) 
Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side. (h) 
 
Stanza 5: 
What have those lonely mountains worth revealing? (i) 
More glory and more grief than I can tell: (j) 
The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling (i) 
Can centre both the worlds of Heaven and Hell. (j) 
g. 
‘Stanzas’ begins with ‘Often rebuked’ by Emily Brontë, edited by Charlotte Brontë. [28] 
 
Then, before a further elaboration of the remaining poem, 
Charlotte writes, ‘The following are the last lines my sister 
Emily ever wrote.’ [28] 
 
No coward soul is mine, 
No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere: 
I see Heaven's glories shine, 
And faith shines equal, arming me from fear. 
 
O God within my breast, 
Almighty, ever-present Deity! 
Life—that in me has rest, 
As I—undying Life—have power in thee! 
 
Vain are the thousand creeds 
That move men's hearts: unutterably vain; 
Worthless as withered weeds, 
Or idlest froth amid the boundless main, 
 
To waken doubt in one 
Holding so fast by thine infinity; 
So surely anchored on 
The stedfast rock of immortality. 
 
With wide-embracing love

Thy spirit animates eternal years, 
Pervades and broods above, 
Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears. 
 
Though earth and man were gone, 
And suns and universes ceased to be, 
And Thou were left alone, 
Every existence would exist in Thee. 
 
There is not room for Death, 
Nor atom that his might could render void: 
Thou—THOU art Being and Breath, 
And what THOU art may never be destroyed.

‘Stanzas’ begins with ‘Often rebuked’ by Emily Brontë, edited by Charlotte Brontë. [28] 
 
The above poem is claimed to be written by Emily Brontë 
and edited by Charlotte Brontë. Nevertheless, the authorship is 
uncertain [26]. We analyse this piece of work as the dataset for 
comparison and evaluation. There is a possibility that the writers’ 
writing style varies from time to time. Therefore, the loose 
verification of late Brontës may be significantly different from 
their early works [9].  
Given a close look at the poem ‘Stanzas’, we can spot a 
similar pattern and rhythm in it. For example, the number of 
lines and the rhythm pattern in the above ‘Stanzas’ that begins 
with ‘Often rebuked’ written by Emily Brontë, edited by 
Charlotte Brontë is akin to the poem ‘My Feet They are Sore’ in 
‘Jane Eyre’ written by Charlotte Brontë.  They end with the 
‘abab, cdcd, efef, ghgh, ijij’ pattern. More specifically, in the 
first stanza of the poem ‘Stanzas’, the rhythm of the first and 
third lines ends with ‘-ning’, which is labelled by a random ‘a’, 
and the rhythm of the second and fourth lines end with ‘-e’, 
which is marked as a sequential letter ‘b’. The following rhythm 
in the ‘Stanzas’ edited by Charlotte Brontë is aligned with the 
pattern in her poems included in ‘Jane Eyre’. Such identical 
authorship features can be easily found through Markov Model.  
B. Bilingual Experiment 
W. B. Yeats’s poem ‘Leda and the Swan’ is based on a Greek 
story in which the god Zeus swooped down and hit Leda in the 
form of a swan, a human and ancient Greek queen. Consequently, 
such misconduct led to the Trojan War. Seemingly ironic, the 
poem could allude to the colonial relationship between Great 
Britain and Ireland, more specifically, to the Irish War for 
Independence.  
 
Stanza 1: 
Line 1: A sudden blow: the great wings beating still (k)

‘Leda and the Swan’ by W. B. Yeats. [31] 
 
Analysing Yeats’s poem through a human’s close reading 
from a literature perspective, the poem consists of three concepts: 
defamiliarisation, paradox, and textual indeterminacies. The 
world would become strange due to the act of defamiliarisation. 
In the first stanza, ‘sudden, still, staggering’ suggests that the 
story takes place in medias res, defamiliarising the familiar. 
Through the angle of the third party, Yeats creates an impression 
to the readers who are not notified of anything that suddenly, 
everything is happening from nowhere. Because of the 
unawareness, audiences like the blind, who can only touch a part 
of an elephant at once, feel unfamiliar with this pornographic 
scene. Such a defamiliarised act ‘presents objects or experiences 
from an unusual perspective or in unconventional and self‐
conscious language that our habitual, ordinary, rote perceptions 
of those things are disturbed [30]’. The estranging lines in the 
last stanza also indicate defamiliarisation that the poetic form 
and language are intentionally made strange after the 
‘Agamemnon dead’, indicating the tragedy of such an 
irresponsible act of sexuality. 
Power imbalance, id est who overpowers whom, remains an 
unsolved and ambiguous question for readers. The textual 
indeterminacy could lie in ‘Leda’s profound and provocative 
dramatisation of the ambiguities of sexual encounters’ [29]. 
Conventionally speaking, ‘helpless, terrified’ could possibly 
imply Leda’s despair because Zeus, in the form of a swan, rapes 
Leda. However, without pinpointing commas, it is not absolutely 
clear who is helpless. We may read that ambiguity as the basis 
of assuming interchangeable roles, both Leda and the swan 
being potentially the rapist [29]. Another indeterminacy 
example in stanza two leads to a question: whose ‘body’ feels 
whose ‘strange heart beating’, which resulting audiences’ 
imagination of what suits their habitus.

The by-product of textual indeterminacy is the paradox 
regarding the definition of and separation between rightness and 
wrongness in Yeats’ poem. The sexual intercourse between the 
helpless and the powerful may suggest the intertwining essence 
of the paradox between rightness and wrongness. The 
presumably mighty ‘glory’ and helpless Leda would never 
foresee that their sexual affairs would ‘engender’ the ‘broken 
wall, burning roof’ causing ‘dead, blood’. By asking three 
questions (two questions begin with ‘how’ in lines 5-8, and one 
begins with ‘did’ in lines 14-15), Yeats implies that the natural 
bond and sexual desire from both parties are intertwined and 
inseparable, and so do the paradoxical rightness and wrongness 
in Zeus and Leda. As a human, Leda sees Zeus as an animal; 
thus, sex with such a ‘feathered glory’ is prohibited. She intends 
to ‘push’ him from ‘her loosening thighs’. However, her feeling 
and, more importantly, Zeus’s power takes over Leda, who is 
therefore subordinated by power, emotion, and sexuality. 
From a machine learning perspective, the above-mentioned 
three key concepts can be captured and simplified by analysing 
the form of the original and translated texts. Here we provide 
two different versions in Chinese for the bilingual experiment.  
The original English version of ‘Leda and the Swan’ (also 
called source text) has distinct machine-learning-friendly 
features, especially rhythming. For example,  in stanza one, the 
ending rhythm for lines one and three is ‘-ill’, which we name 
the ‘k’ line; in contrast, the second and fourth lines end with ‘-
ssed/st’, which we call it the ‘l’ line. We can see the pattern 
regularly goes in the ‘klkl’ pattern. A similar pattern and feature 
can be seen in the second and third stanzas, which end with the 
rhythm of ‘mnmn’ and ‘opqopq’, respectively. The random 
letter ‘m’ represents the rhythm of ‘-ush’ in lines five and seven; 
‘n’ refers to the identical ending rhythm of ‘-ighs/ies’.  
Using the Markov model, if such a feature can be primed, 
detected, and memorised, then this model can be used to predict 
the translated text (also known as the target text). In other words, 
such rhythming features in the English source text should ideally 
be translated by a faithful translator to achieve the same effect in 
Chinese-translated poems.  
 
遽然的垂擊：巨翼猶拍打於 
暈眩無力的女子之上，她的雙股 
被黑色的腳蹼撫弄，頸為喙所擒， 
他把她無依的胸乳緊納入懷。 
 
那些恐慌猶疑的手指怎麼可能 
將插翼的光輝自漸漸鬆弛的股間推開？ 
而身體，在那白色的疾撞之下， 
如何不覺察一奇異的心在那裡跳動？ 
 
腰際一陣戰慄於焉產生 
是毀頹的城墻，塔樓熾烈焚燒 
而阿加梅儂死矣。 
           被如此攫獲著， 
如此被蒼天一狂猛的血力所制服， 
她可曾利用他的威勢奪取他的洞識 
在那冷漠的鳥喙廢然鬆懈之前？

However, in the first piece of Chinese translation written by 
Yang [32], it is unlikely to see such features of rhythming if we 
look at the last words of each line. For example, in the first stanza, 
we have to end words pronounced respectively ‘yu, gu, qin, 
huai’, which do not comply with the source text’s rules and 
writing convention, largely distinct from Yeats’s writing habits. 
In the second stanza, the ending pronunciations are ‘neng, kai, 
xia, dong’, which are significantly different from the rhythm 
format in the source text. As the different rhythms cannot be 
memorized by a simple step of the Markov chain, the 
undetectability of the rhythm in Yang’s translation could fail and 
an undesired translation from a machine learning perspective.  
 
Stanza 1: 
Line 1:猝然一攫：巨翼猶兀自拍動，(k’) 
Line 2:扇著欲墜的少女，他用黑蹼 (l’) 
Line 3:摩挲她雙股，含她的後頸在喙中，(k’) 
Line 4:且擁她捂住的乳房在他的胸脯。(l’) 
 
Stanza 2: 
Line 5:驚駭而含糊的手指怎能推拒，(m’) 
Line 6:她鬆弛的股間，那羽化的寵倖？(n’) 
Line 7:白熱的衝刺下，那撲倒的凡軀 (m’) 
Line 8:怎能不感到那跳動的神異的心？(n’) 
 
Stanza 3: 
Line 9:腰際一陣顫抖，從此便種下 (o’) 
Line 10:敗壁頹垣，屋頂和城樓焚毀，(p') 
Line 11:而亞加曼儂死去。 
Line 12:           就這樣被抓，(q') 
Line 13:被自天而降的暴力所淩駕，(o’) 
Line 14:她可曾就神力汲神的智慧，(p’) 
Line 15:乘那冷漠之喙尚未將她放下？(q’)

On the contrary, Yu’s version of translation [33] aligns with 
Yeats’s rhythming format. Such rhythming features in Yu’s 
translation could be memorized by the Markov model. For 
instance, in stanza one of Yu’s translation, lines one and three 
end with the rhythm ‘-ong’, and the rhythm of lines two and four 
are identical ‘pu’. Likewise, the rhythming pattern in stanza two 
goes ‘u’ (lines five and seven) and ‘xin’ (lines six and eight), 
which suggests that Yu has captured the structure feature and 
beauty in Yeats’s poem and then strategically and equivalently 
translated them into Chinese.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In carrying out the analysis of the works in English and other 
literature, there are definite requirements, which include 
determining the authorship, dating the period of the work, and 
establishing the passage’s style, theme, and purpose. We have 
placed such tasks in a machine-learning context, where a 
learning phase involving known passages is followed by a 
testing phase involving unknown passages.  
Since obtaining such knowledge from human experts is time-
consuming, subjective, and error-prone, we combine a data 
analysis approach with Markov models. The Markov model can 
represent and encapsulate the sequential flow of writing 
characteristics in passages. In addition, we also proposed two 
strategies to overcome the memoryless properties of the Markov 
model. The first involves augmenting the state space of the 
Markovian representation by repeatedly forming the Cartesian 
product of the underlying space. However, while this is a 
mathematically versatile approach, it will lead to high 
computational costs. The second approach exploits a poem’s 
stanza and line structure, which has shown to be much more 
efficient, yielding a much smaller dimension transition matrix. 
In addition, the latter approach also lends itself to further state 
integration by judiciously analysing the purpose of each line of 
a passage and providing the scope for analysing much larger 
corpora. Through the appropriate use of Markovian variants, 
examining the pattern of probability entries in the transition 
matrix, and applying this characterisation to the vast body of 
English literature, more scientific, objective, and reliable 
decisions can be made concerning proper authorship, writing 
style, and other literary qualities.
