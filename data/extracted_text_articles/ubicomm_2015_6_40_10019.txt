Abstract—In this paper, we propose a high frequency-based 
advertising method using a smart device. This method 
supports the transfer of advertising content to the smart device 
user with no additional action or TV audio signal required to 
access that content. Because the proposed method uses the high 
frequencies of sound signals via the inner speaker of the smart 
device, its main advantage is that it does not affect the audio 
signal of TV content. Furthermore, this method allows large 
numbers of smart device users to see advertising content 
continuously and automatically. To evaluate the efficacy of the 
proposed method, we developed an application to implement it 
and subsequently carried out an advertisement transmission 
experiment. The success rate of the transmission experiment 
was approximately 97%. Based on this result, we believe the 
proposed method will be a useful technique in introducing a 
customized user advertising service.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, advertising service technologies based on 
smart devices have been introduced gradually in line with 
performance improvements in smart devices. When feature 
phones first became popular, advertising technologies using 
Short Message Service(SMS) or Multimedia Messaging 
System(MMS) were the most prevalent. However, with the 
advent of smart devices, various technologies such as push 
services, location-based services [1], advertising using Quick 
Response code(QR code) or Near Field Communication(NFC) 
[2]-[4], and cross-media advertising [5] became the new 
trend. Most significantly, the mainly passive role of 
advertising services changed to a more active one. 
Good examples of advertising technology based on smart 
devices include Fujitsu’s new data transmission technology 
using video data [6] and KT Media Hub’s matching cross-
media advertising service. Fujitsu’s advertising technology 
combines visible light communication technology and digital 
watermarks [7]. This service can send advertising data to 
smart devices via the device’s camera by using lighter and 
darker parts of the full screen. The technology supports 16 
bits of data per second. If smart device users want to access 
the advertising information, they need to perform a light 
detection action using the camera of the smart device. 
However, in the case of TVs, this method requires extra 
technology to insert the advertising data into TV content. 
Also, it is inconvenient for the user, who has to perform an 
advertisement detection action while watching TV. 
KT Media Hub’s matching cross-media advertising 
service can support event coupons or the transmission of 
additional information to users through the audio signal of 
TV content. With this method, when users want to access 
advertisements while watching TV, they only have to shake 
their smart device. The advertisements are then transmitted 
via the TV audio, and the smart device first analyzes the 
advertising information that has been sent from the server 
and then shows the advertisements to the user. The 
advantage of this method is that it does not need any process 
enabling it to utilize the audio of TV content for 
advertisement transmission, because it already uses inaudible 
audio information from TV content. However, even if there 
was no inaudible audio, this method could not support 
sending of advertising information to the user. In addition, it 
is prone to detection errors due to the shaking duration or 
shaking intensity of the smart device. 
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new advertisement 
transmission method using the high frequencies of inaudible 
sound signals, 
which is 
aimed at addressing the 
disadvantages of existing methods. The proposed method 
uses the 18kHz∼22kHz frequency of the audible sound 
range (20Hz ∼ 22kHz). We used the 18kHz ∼ 22kHz 
frequency because it is the defined audible sound range, 
despite the fact that most people could not listen to sound in 
this range. Furthermore, to prevent signal detection errors 
from surrounding noise, we used two sequential high 
frequencies as the audio signal of the TV content, and smart 
devices that detect the high frequencies receive the related 
advertising content from the advertising content server. 
Similar to Fujitsu’s technology, the two high frequencies of 
the TV content are generated consistently during the time 
needed for advertisement transmission. High frequencies can 
then be added easily to the sound component of the TV 
content and can reach any smart device in an indoor space 
where people are watching TV. Also, because the high 
frequencies used in the proposed method do not influence the 
original sound of the TV content or vice versa, the proposed 
method can transmit advertising data to smart devices very 
accurately. To evaluate the performance of the proposed 
method, we devised TV content that included the high 
frequencies needed to supply advertisements, and we then 
developed the advertising service application based on a 
smart device using the proposed method. During this process,

we carried out performance evaluation tests according to 
frequency changes at high frequencies, and we then tested 
the advertisement transmission capability via distance. The 
success rate of the results in terms of frequency change was 
97%, while the success rate in terms of distance was 98.5% 
within 5m. These results indicate that the proposed method 
will prove useful with regard to the effective transmission of 
advertising information based on smart devices used in an 
indoor space. 
The present paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, 
we explain existing technologies that use high frequency for 
information transmission. In Section 3, we describe the 
general architecture of advertising information based on 
smart devices using high frequencies, and what methods 
smart devices use to handle high frequencies. In Section 4, 
we evaluate the performance of the proposed method, 
followed by a conclusion in Section 5 and by a future 
research in Section 6.

RELATED WORK 
This section explains existing technology that uses high 
frequency to transmit information and data. Early researchers 
in this area used high frequency to trace the position of 
mobile phone users indoors [8][9]. In 2011, Bihler proposed 
a method of transmitting information to smart devices using 
high frequencies and Wireless Fidelity(WiFi). Bihler’s 
method availed of two high frequencies, 20kHz and 22kHz 
[10]. According to this method, eight bits of data were sent 
within 208 ms and Hamming code schemas were used for 
error correction. However, because the method involved fast 
changes between those two high frequencies, the result was a 
noise familiar to many, and the attainable distance of the 
high frequencies was very short. 
Lee then proposed smart phone user authentication using 
audio channels [11]. This method used high frequencies from 
15,800Hz to 20,000Hz as authentication signals and 
implemented user authentication between smart devices and 
personal computers (PC). Because the method generated two 
high frequencies simultaneously, the spacing of each 
frequency was 600Hz too much. Table 1 below shows the 
assigned frequencies according to bit; using this method, two 
bytes of data can be sent in eight seconds. In Table 1, Lee’s 
method generates a beep four times in eight seconds using 
assigned frequencies at one-second intervals, and the smart 
device, on receiving the signal, sends the received data to the 
authentication server.  
While this method is more stable than Bihler’s method in 
terms of data transmission accuracy, data transmission takes 
too long.

Another researcher, Chung, proposed a near wireless 
control technology using high frequencies [12][13]. In this 
method, he defined high frequencies as base signals and low 
latency as a control signal. Base signals comprise more than 
two high frequencies and note the existence of the control 
signal to the smart device. Then, because low latency 
accesses various control data by frequency value, low 
latency is generated by the Central Processing Unit(CPU) of 
the smart device. The distance of the control signal in this 
method is greater than in Bihler’s method and the data 
transmission time is faster than in Lee’s method. Thus, 
Chung’s method can be used as a trigger signal for the 
effective transmission of advertising information.

ADVERTISING METHOD VIA SMART DEVICE BASED ON 
HIGH FREQUENCY 
This section explains the general architecture relating to 
advertisement transmission to smart devices using high 
frequencies, in addition to the methods used by smart devices 
to process high frequencies. Figure 1 below represents the 
general architecture of the proposed method. 
First, the smart TV pictured on the left in Figure 1 starts 
sending the first high frequency signal to the smart device 
(①), and the smart device verifies the presence of the first 
high frequency using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) (②). 
Then, if the smart device detects the first high frequency 
consistently, it checks whether the number of first high 
frequency signals is k times over (③). Once this has been

confirmed, the smart device waits to verify the presence of 
the second high frequency (④). When the smart TV sends 
the second high frequency signal to the smart device (⑤), 
the smart device verifies the signal’s presence (⑥) and 
checks whether the number of second high frequency signals 
is i times over (⑦). If the smart device detects that the first 
high frequency signal is k times over and the second is i 
times over, it then requests and receives advertising 
information in the advertisement server via WiFi (⑧∼⑩). 
At this point, the proposed method uses a high frequency at 
an inaudible frequency range, namely 19kHz∼22kHz, as the 
first high frequency and 18kHz as the second high frequency. 
Figure 2 below shows how high frequencies are used in the 
proposed method. And then, the proposed high frequencies 
are contained in audio of TV contents by the broadcasting 
company. 
Figure 2 shows how high frequencies are sent as 
advertisement transmission signals, with the first high 
frequency at 19kHz (0.2s) and 0.1s, and the second high 
frequency at 18kHz (0.1s) and 0.3s. The same high 
frequencies are sent again at 0.5s. In the case of the high 
frequencies being received by the smart device, the first high 
frequency is received at 19kHz (0.2s) and 0.1s, while the 
second high frequency is received at 18kHz (0.2s) and 0.2s. 
In fact, the 18kHz second high frequency (0.2s∼0.3s) only 
amounts to noise. Nevertheless, the smart device can receive 
the advertisement signal accurately because it is still 
undergoing the process outlined in ③ in Figure 1. 
Furthermore, in step ② of Figure 2, the receiving high 
frequency results in noise at 19kHz from 0.7s to 0.8s. 
However, because the smart device has already completed 
process ③ in Figure 1 at 0.7s and is now undergoing process 
④, it can receive the advertisement signal. The first high 
frequency can then use 31 signals from 19kHz to 22kHz by 
100Hz each time. For example, the advertisement signal that 
uses 19kHz is different from the advertisement signal that 
uses 19.1kHz. The smart device, having detected the 
advertisement signal, sends the values for the advertisement 
signal to the advertising information server and the  
 
advertising information server then sends the related 
advertising content to the smart device.

EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION 
This section introduces the advertising application 
capable of supplying the advertising information to the smart 
device user by utilizing high frequencies as the proposed 
method. In addition, we explain the experiments and results 
used for the performance evaluation of the proposed method. 
We developed the advertising application based on iOS 6 
and created it using Xcode 5. Figure 3 is a screenshot of the 
main advertising application.

In Figure 3 (a), the graph displays the FFT bin number 
relating to the first high frequency (red line) and the second 
high frequency (blue line) when the smart device receives 
the advertisement signal. The x axis of the graph indicates 
the time sequence, and the flow of time is from right to left. 
The y axis of the graph is the FFT bin number of high 
frequencies. Thus, we can see from the graph that the smart 
device received the advertisement signal four times and the 
order of receipt was ①, ②, ③, and ④.  
Next, we evaluated the performance of the proposed 
method. We added an advertisement signal to the sound 
component of the TV content, which was a K-pop music 
video. We used 19kHz, 20kHz, and 21kHz as the first high 
frequency and 18kHz as the second high frequency. Each 
advertisement signal was generated twice at two-minute 
intervals. Thus, we did the receiving test 50 times for each 
advertisement signal. Because the advertising application 
checks high frequencies of FFT per 10ms, we set each 
threshold value in such a way that k was 12 times (60% of 
the first high frequency length) and i was six times (60% of 
the second frequency length). The distance between the 
smart TV and the smart device was 3m and the volume level 
of the smart TV was 70dB. The test space measured 5m × 
4m, and 40dB was maintained as the silence space. Figure 4 
below shows the result of the test using each advertisement 
signal. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Results of the test using each advertisement signal. 
In Figure 4, when the first high frequency was 19kHz, 
the smart device received the advertisement signal 50 times. 
Using 20kHz as the first high frequency caused the signal to 
be received 49 times, 21kHz caused it to be received 47 
times, and so on. Thus, the total success rate averaged 97%. 
This shows that transmission errors increase in line with the 
rising value of the first high frequency. We believe the 
reason for this is that the bin number of the higher frequency 
detected was lower than the bin number of the lower 
frequency over the same distance and with the same number 
of decibels. The next task was to test performance according 
to distance. The distance between the smart TV and the 
smart device was from 1m to 5m in 1m intervals, and we did 
the receiving test 50 times with each advertisement signal 
(19kHz, 20kHz, and 21kHz) and at each distance. The test 
space and every threshold value were the same. Figure 5 
below shows the results of the advertisement transmission 
test according to distance. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Result of advertisement transmission test according to distance. 
 
Figure 5 tells us that the smart device received all of the 
advertisement signals at a distance of 1m. At a distance of 
2m, the first high frequency of 20kHz failed to transmit the 
advertisement once. At a distance of 3m, the first high 
frequency of 20 kHz and 21kHz each failed once. At a 
distance of 4m, the first high frequency of 19kHz and 20kHz 
each failed once, and twice in the case of 21 kHz. At a 
distance of 5m, the first high frequency of 20kHz failed once 
and the first high frequency of 21kHz failed three times. 
Thus, transmission success rates were 99.3% within 3m and 
98.5% within 5m. We think that the first high frequency 
transmission of 20kHz failed at a 2m distance because the k 
and i thresholds had not yet been optimized. Therefore, the 
solution to this error is to optimize each threshold. In 
addition, the 20kHz and 21kHz first high frequencies failed 
twice or three times at a 3∼5 m distance. This was because 
the bin number of high frequencies decreased according to 
increasing frequency values. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we proposed an advertisement method via 
smart device using high frequencies. This is a useful method 
that can support the transmission of advertising information 
to smart devices from a smart TV naturally and with no 
detection action required on the part of the user. In addition, 
because the method uses inaudible high frequencies, it does 
not influence the sound of the TV content, making it easy for 
the high frequencies needed for advertisement transmission 
to add to the sound of TV content. Therefore, the proposed 
method can support the transmission of advertising 
information better than existing methods and would work as 
an effective advertisement transmission technology for use 
indoors.
