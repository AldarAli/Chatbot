Abstract—A performance analysis of the digital video broad-
casting - satellite to handheld (DVB-SH) system in presence
of ground mobile terminals (GMTs) is presented. The paper
focuses on the Doppler spread issue. Indeed, the mobility of
GMTs induces a Doppler spread in the orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) signal that destroys the or-
thogonality of subcarriers. The loss of orthogonality produces
inter-carrier interference (ICI) and hence a degradation of the
system performance in terms of symbol error probability. The
paper presents the conditions in which this degradation can
be compensated for by an increase in the signal to noise ratio
(SNR) at the receiver side. The result depends on both the
modulation scheme and the speed of GMTs. Inversely, having
a maximum allowable margin on the received SNR allows us
to determine an upper bound on the mobile station velocity.

I. INTRODUCTION
DVB-SH is a broadcast standard for the delivery of video
and data stream to GMTs. In a DVB-SH system, GMTs
receive signals from two network segments: the Satellite
Component (SC) and the Complementary Ground Compo-
nent (CGC). The SC ensures geographical global coverage
while the CGC provides cellular-type coverage. On the CGC,
the OFDM modulation scheme has been chosen as it is the
basis of both Digital Video Broadcasting - Terrestrial (DVB-
T) and Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld (DVB-H)
systems. On the SC, two transmission schemes are available:
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) or OFDM leading to two
reference architectures termed SH-A and SH-B. SH-A uses
OFDM both on the satellite and the terrestrial link while
SH-B uses TDM on the satellite link and OFDM for the
terrestrial link.
The signals received by GMTs suffer from several im-
pairments according to the corresponding segment: delay,
Doppler shift and Doppler spreading. Delay and Doppler
shift issues have been addressed in the DVB-SH standard
[1] [2] by the implementation of a SH frame Information
Packet (SHIP). This synchronization scheme is similar to
the Megaframe Initialization Packet (MIP) in DVB-T and
the pre-compensation of the time delay variation at the
gateway location. The principles of synchronization can be
summarized as follows.
• SHIP inserter performs the insertion of a GPS-based
time stamp (±0.1 µs accuracy) in the SH-Frame in-
dicating the transmission time of the beginning of the
next SH Frame.
• Single Frequency Network (SFN) adapters in the
transmitters (repeaters) perform buffering of incom-
ing MPEG-TS packets and transmission of SH Frame
aligned with GPS relative time stamp.
On the other hand, the Doppler spreading on DVB-SH
signals has not been addressed to the same extend. This
issue needs to be investigated more precisely because the
Doppler spreading has a great impact on the physical layer
performance. Indeed, the Doppler spread destroys the or-
thogonality of subcarriers in the OFDM signal and generate
power leakage among subcarriers, known as ICI. The loss
of orthogonality has been characterized in [3] [4] [5] [6]. In
[6], the ICI and the degradation due to Doppler spreading
have been evaluated. The purpose of this paper does not
consist in proposing the receiving technique in order to
reduce the Doppler spread instead system parameters will
be adjusted in order to cope with the constraints. More
precisely, the effect of the Doppler spread can be reduced
by limiting the mobile velocity. Another approach consists
in adding an additional margin on the received SNR per
symbol. To avoid Doppler spread impairments, the speed of
GMTs should not exceeds a maximum allowable value. This
maximum allowable velocity should not induce a Doppler
spread higher than 13.28% of the subcarrier spacing [7].
For example, when the carrier spacing in a 2k mode is 2.79
kHz, it has been shown that the system still achieves the
target performance provided that the Doppler spread does
not exceed a value of 0.37 kHz. This induces a maximum
velocity for the GMT of 183.9 km/h.
In this paper, we propose another method to mitigate the
Doppler spreading by compensating for the degradation of
the SNR per symbol at the input of the decoder. The required
margin can be estimated. We compute the difference in terms
of SNR per symbol using the symbol error probability curve
which is affected by a Doppler spread and another one
without Doppler spreading. This method can be applied only
to any OFDM modulation scheme of the CGC (e.g., SH-A

and SH-B).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we describe the Doppler spreading induced by the two
segments of the DVB-SH system. In Section III, we evaluate
the relation of the ICI and the degradation of SNR per sym-
bol. In Section IV, methods of dimensioning are provided.
Finally, the conclusions are given in Section V.
II. DOPPLER SPREADING IN DVB-SH SYSTEMS
A. Doppler spread induced on the SC segment
The satellite motion and the ground terminal mobility
induce a Doppler shift and a Doppler spread [8].
• The Doppler shift ν0 is given by, ν0 = Vsr
λ , where Vsr
represents the radial velocity of the satellite and λ is
the signal wavelength.
• The Doppler spread σν is deﬁned such that σ2
ν is a sum
of three terms.
σ2

ν,g + σ2
ν,s + σ2
ν,ch
=
(Vg
Λc
)2 + (Ωs
αc
)2 + ( 1
Tch
)2
(1)
The ﬁrst term σ2
ν,g = ( Vg
Λc )2 is due to the ground terminal
motion, where Vg represents the ground terminal velocity
and Λc is the coherence length, usually of the order of the
signal wavelength.
The second term σ2
ν,s = ( Ωs
αc )2 is the Doppler spread
originated by the motion of satellite. Ωs is the angular
velocity of the satellite and αc is the coherence angle.
The angular velocity of the geostationary earth orbit (GEO)
satellite should theoretically be zero. In practical cases, this
parameter is non zero but it is some four orders less than
the same parameter for a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite.
The third term σ2
ν,ch = ( 1
Tch )2 is the channel self Doppler
spread, where Tch is the characteristic time constant which
describes the effects of moving and changing objects in the
vicinity of the ground station.
B. Doppler spread induced on the CGC segment
On the CGC segment, the Doppler spread is mainly
produced by the mobility of GMTs for ﬁxed relay stations.
For mobile relay stations, the total Doppler spread is the
sum of the Doppler spreads induced by both GMTs and
relay stations [9]. The average Doppler shift is zero. Let Vg
be the velocity of the GMT and Vr, the velocity of the relay
station, then the total Doppler spread can be expressed as:
Fd = Vg
c × fc + Vr
c × fc
(2)
where fc is the carrier frequency and c = 3.108m/s is the
speed of light.
III. ICI AND DEGRADATION
In this section, we evaluate the ICI and the degradation
of the SNR per symbol due to Doppler spreading. We
assume that each subcarrier is transmitted in a frequency ﬂat
Rayleigh fading channel which corresponds to the channel
between relay stations and GMTs. The OFDM system uses
N subcarriers. For typical modulation schemes such as
phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature-amplitude mod-
ulation (QAM), the carrier to interference ratio (C/I) on
subcarrier i is given in [6] as:
C
I =
1
(NT Fd)2
2
PN
k=1,k̸=i
1
(k−i)2
(3)
where Fd is the maximum Doppler spread. As in typical C/I
computations, we assume that the interference produced by
other subchannels is an additive noise. Without interference
and Doppler spreading, the signal to noise ratio per symbol
is Es/N0, where Es denotes the mean energy received per
symbol and 2N0 denotes the variance of the AWGN noise
in an equivalent low pass channel model. With interference
and Doppler spreading, the signal to interference plus noise
ratio is Es/(N0 +NI), where Es = C/Rs, NI = I/Rs and
Rs = 1/T is the input symbol rate. Then we obtain:
Es
N0 + NI
=
Es
N0
1 + Es
N0 ( C
I )−1
(4)
So, in decibel,
∆dB
=
[
Es
N0 + NI
]dB − [ Es
N0
]dB
=
−10 log[1 + Es
N0
(C
I )−1]
(5)
Equation (5) gives the degradation ∆dB of the signal to noise
ratio at the receiver when there are interferences between
subcarriers.
The C/I curves of the middle subcarrier index k = N/2
are plotted versus the Doppler spread Fd in Figure 1 for
several DVB-SH transmission modes at a carrier frequency
of 2.175 GHz and a bandwidth of 5 MHz. The 8k mode is
experiencing more interference than the other modes because
its subcarrier spacing is smaller than the one of other modes.
For a given C/I of 15 dB, the 1k mode can support a
Doppler spread of 800 Hz and Doppler spread of 400 Hz for
the 2k mode. For the same value of C/I, the 4k mode allows
a maximum Doppler spread of 200 Hz while the 8k mode
can support only 100 Hz. According to these Doppler spread
values, we can calculate the maximum allowable velocity for
the GMT. The numerical values of the maximum allowable
velocity for the GMT for a 5 MHz DVB-SH bandwidth
channel at 2.175 GHz and C/I of 15 dB are shown in
Table I. We see that the 1k mode allows the GMT moves
at a maximum speed of 397.22 km/h while the 2k mode
can support up to 198.61 km/h. On the other hand, the 4k

mode provides a maximum allowable velocity for the GMT
of 99.30 km/h. Finally, the 8k mode can only support at the
maximum speed of 49.65 km/h.
Figure 2 illustrates the degradation due to Doppler spread-
ing with respect to the Es/N0 ratio for several values of
C/I. We observe that the degradation not only depends on
the C/I ratio but also on the Es/N0 ratio. For small values
of Es/N0, the degradation has less inﬂuence on the system
performance. In particular, when Es/N0 is smaller than 10
dB the degradation is less than 2 dB.
IV. DIMENSIONING OF THE DVB-SH SYSTEM
ACCORDING TO THE DOPPLER SPREADING
In this section, we express the degradation of SNR per
symbol, Es/N0, which corresponds to the velocity of GMTs.
This degradation is estimated by computing the difference

in Es/N0 between the symbol error probability curve which
is affected by the Doppler spreading and the one without
Doppler spreading with respect to the same target value of
symbol error probability. Figure 3 through 6 are plotted by
using the expression of symbol error probability of Rayleigh
OFDM QPSK and 16-QAM and replacing the expression of
Es/N0 by Es/(N0 + NI) derived in (4).

Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the symbol error probability
of uncoded QPSK OFDM and uncoded 16-QAM OFDM
for several modes of DVB-SH over a frequency-selective
Rayleigh channel under the Doppler spread, Fd, of 100 Hz,
corresponding to a mobile speed of 50 km/h. The carrier
frequency is 2.175 GHz. When the Es/N0 is large, the ICI
is the limiting factor in performance at any mobile speed.
For example, when the target symbol error probability is
in the order of 10−2, the degradation of uncoded QPSK
modulation are 0.5 dB for 1k mode, 1 dB for 2k modes,
and around 6 dB for 4k mode while the degradation can
not be computed (NC) for 8k mode. In case of uncoded 16-
QAM, the degradation are 2 dB for 1k mode and NC for

in Figures 5 and 6 with carrier frequency fc=2.175 GHz
under Doppler spread, Fd, of 200 Hz, corresponding to
the mobile speed of 100 km/h. If the target symbol error
probability is in the order of 10−2, we see that only two
modes of the uncoded QPSK modulation can be compen-
sated for the degradation, 1 dB for 1k mode and 6 dB for
2k mode. The other modes are totally degraded and can not
be compensated for because their minimum symbol error
probabilities are higher then the target value.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper, the maximum mobile speed of GMTs with
respect to the required minimum C/I value was determined.
Then the degradation was evaluated with respect to the target
system performance. This degradation could be compensated
for by the margin before decoding. It was also shown
that the degradation does not only depend on the mobile
velocity but also depend on the modulation scheme. For high
Doppler spread, for example when the velocity of the GMT
is 100 km/h, the DVB-SH system using 16-QAM OFDM
modulation is totally degraded and the compensation is not
possible. So, one way to solve this problem is to limit the
velocity of the GMT to an appropriate level, which is one
of the interesting subjects for future research.
