Abstract— A liquid phase sensor is realized by using a shear 
horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW).   The SH-SAW 
sensor can detect density and viscosity product, conductivity 
and relative permittivity of liquid.  Sensor sensitivity depends 
on a piezoelectric substrate used.  When a 36° rotated Y-cut, X 
propagating LiTaO3 is used for the substrate, high sensitive 
detection of electrical properties is possible.  In this paper, the 
SH-SAW sensor is applied to a methanol (MeOH) sensor.  First, 
frequency dependences of the SH-SAW sensor are discussed.   
The results indicate that the responses of high frequency 
sensor agree with the perturbation theory.  The application of 
the SH-SAW sensor is MeOH concentration detection in a 
direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).  As a formic acid is 
produced during electrode reactions in the DMFC, real fuel 
becomes binary-mixture solutions of MeOH and formic acid.  
In this paper, the solutions are also measured.  It is found that 
influence of the formic acid can be neglected by using high 
frequency SH-SAW sensor.  This means that the MeOH 
concentration is determined from phase shift.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices have a wide range 
of applications not only in filters, resonators, and oscillators 
[1], but also in sensors [2] and actuators [3].  Propagating 
characteristics of a SAW depends on an adjacent medium 
on a SAW propagating surface.  The SAW is mechanically 
and electrically perturbed, when the adjacent medium 
physically and chemically changes.   When a liquid is 
loaded on the SAW propagating surface, the SAW is 
influenced by liquid properties, such as density, viscosity, 
conductivity, and permittivity.  However, to realize a 
liquid-phase SAW sensor, it is necessary to use a shear 
horizontal SAW (SH-SAW) to avoid a longitudinal wave 
radiation into a liquid [4].   
A direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) [5] is operated using 
a methanol (MeOH) solution.  The reactions on the anode 
and cathode in the DMFC are as follows:

As the generation efficiency of the DMFC depends on the 
concentration of MeOH, the concentration must be known.  
As the DMFC has an optimum concentration range, 
monitoring of the MeOH concentration is required.  The 
MeOH concentration is a function of sound speed, viscosity, 
density, permittivity, and refractive index.  The SH-SAW 
sensor can detect viscosity and density products, and 
permittivity. The SH-SAW sensor, which is fabricated on 
36° rotated Y-cut, X-propagating LiTaO3 (36YX-LiTaO3) 
can detect the permittivity with high sensitivity [6].  In 
previous research [6-9], frequency of the SH-SAW sensor 
was fixed at 50 MHz.  In this paper, the SH-SAW sensors 
with different frequencies are used.  The MeOH solutions are 
measured by changing the temperature.  The experimental 
results are compared with the perturbation theory.  Also, 
influence of a formic acid is discussed. 
II. 
THEORY 
Detection mechanism of the MeOH concentration is 
based on the electrical perturbation [10, 11].  A reference 
liquid is assumed as nonelectrolyte and expressed as  
 
ߝℓ ൌߝ௥ε଴.

Here, ߝℓ , ߝ௥, and ε଴  are dielectric constant, relative 
permittivity of the reference liquid, and dielectric constant of 
free space, respectively.  Electrical property of a sample 
solution is represented by a complex permittivity, ߝℓ′, as 
follows.

Here, ߪ is conductivity of liquid, ߱ is an angular frequency 
of the SH-SAW sensor, and ݆ ൌ √െ1.  The prime (′) denotes 
parameter of the sample solution.   The SH-SAW is 
electrically perturbed the change from (1) to (2).  The 
velocity shift, ΔV/V, and attenuation change which is 
normalized by wave number, Δα/k, are expressed by the 
following equations.

Equations (5) and (6) show that the velocity shift does not 
depend on the frequency and the normalized attenuation 
change does not changed.  
In this paper, the temperature of the SH-SAW sensor was 
varied.  The electromechanical coupling coefficient, effective 
permittivity, and electrical properties of liquid depend on the 
temperature.  The coupling coefficient is calculated from the 
phase velocities on free and shorted surfaces.  The phase 
velocity can be calculated by extended Campbell and Jones 
method for liquid/piezoelectric substrate structure [4, 12].  
Kushibiki’s material constants [13] and Smith’s temperature 
coefficients [14] of LiTaO3 were used for the numerical 
calculation.  Material constants of MeOH solution were 
obtained from the chemical handbook [15].   
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
A. SH-SAW sensor 
The SH-SAW sensor used is shown in Fig. 1.  As the SH-
SAW on the 36YX-LiTaO3 has large electromechanical 
coupling coefficient, the crystal was chosen.  For generating 
and receiving SH-SAW, a floating electrode unidirectional 
transducer (FEUDT) [16] was fabricated on the crystal.  The 
FEUDT was adopted to reduce phase distortion and improve 
insertion loss [7].  The SH-SAW sensor consists of dual 
delay lines.  The propagating surface of one delay line, 
channel (Ch.) 1, was metallized and electrically shorted by 
evaporated gold and titanium films.  On the shorted surface, 
particle displacement only interacts with the adjacent liquid 
and then the SH-SAW is mechanically perturbed.  The other 
delay line, Ch. 2, has a free surface area where the crystal 
surface is in direct contact with a liquid.  As the electrostatic 
potential and particle displacement interact with a liquid, the 
electrical and mechanical perturbations are obtained.  The 
electrical perturbation is detected by detecting differential 
signals between two delay lines.  Center frequencies of the 
SH-SAW sensors used was 51.5 and 155 MHz.  All sensors 
were obtained from Japan radio Co. Ltd.  Design parameters 
of the SH-SAW sensor used is summarized in Table I.  
Figure 2 shows a liquid flow cell used.

B. Experimental setup 
A sinusoidal signal from a signal generator (Anritsu 
MG3601A) is divided.  One signal is directly connected to 
the vector voltmeter as a reference signal.  The other is fed to 
the SH-SAW delay lines via a very high frequency (VHF) 
switching unit.  The phase shift and amplitude ratio between 
the reference signal and Ch. 1 or Ch. 2 were monitored using 
a vector voltmeter (HP 8508A).  The phase difference and 
amplitude ratio between the two channels was calculated 
using a PC.  The velocity shift and normalized attenuation 
change were calculated from the phase difference and 
amplitude ratio, respectively. 
Figure 3 shows the liquid flow measurement system with 
a peristaltic pump.   Flow rate was fixed at 500 ml/min.  A 
part of flow tube and a sample vessel were kept in a 
temperature-controlled chamber (ESPEC SU-240).   The SH-
SAW sensor with flow cell and pump were placed outside of 
the chamber.  Temperature was varied from 10 to 80 °C.  
Temperature on the SH-SAW sensor was monitored using a 
thermocouple thermometer.  The maximum temperature was 
determined on the basis of the actual DMFC.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The MeOH solution of 3 wt% was measured.  The 
concentration was decided on the based on the optimum 
concentration of a high-power DMFC.  In Fig. 4, 
experimental results and calculated results of the velocity 
shift using eq. (5) are plotted.  Reference temperature was 
10 °C.  When the temperature is lower than room 
temperature, the experimental results and theory agree well.  
However, the results from the 51.5 MHz SH-SAW sensor do 
not agree with the theory with increasing temperature.  In eq. 
(5), conductivity of the sample is ignored.  At high 
temperature, 
however, 
the 
conductivity 
cannot 
be 
disregarded.  The conductivity depends on the temperature 
and it increases with temperature.  In the equations, the 
conductivity is normalized by the angular frequency.   This 
means that influence of conductivity reduces using a high 
frequency SH-SAW sensor.  Therefore, reasonable results 
were obtained.  We have proposed determination method of 
methanol concentration without any calibration [9].  The 
51.5 MHz SH-SAW sensor was used.  As the sensor 
responses and theory do not agree for the 51.5 MHz SH-
SAW sensor, the electromechanical coupling coefficient was 
corrected.  For the 155 MHz SH-SAW sensor, the correction 
of the electromechanical coupling coefficient is not 
necessary.  The theory can be used to determine the MeOH 
concentration. 
In Fig. 4, the ordinate is the velocity shift.  The velocity 
shift is converted from measured phase shift.   Here we 
compare the phase shift.  The results are plotted in Fig. 5.  
Phase shift depends on the interaction length between the 
SH-SAW and liquid.  The length is shown in Table. I.  The 
converted length in wavelength of the 155 MHz SH-SAW 
sensor is longer than that to the 51.5 MHz SH-SAW sensor, 
reasonable results were obtained.   
From Figs. 4 and 5, it is found that the best method to 
determine the concentration of MeOH solution is to use the 
high frequency SH-SAW sensor.  The MeOH solution is 
liquid fuel for the DMFC.  However, during electrode 
reaction, a formic acid is produced.  The formic acid 
dissolves in the MeOH solution.  In our previous research, 
we proposed the determination method of MeOH 
concentration of  the binary-mixture solution  of MeOH  and 
formic acid using  the 50 MHz  SH-SAW  sensor [6].  The

method is complex and both velocity shift and normalized 
attenuation change are needed.  If the MeOH concentration 
is determined from only the phase shift, a simple 
measurement system is realized and price will be decreased.  
Therefore, in this paper, the binary-mixture solutions of 
MeOH and formic acid were measured using the SH-SAW 
sensors and compared.  The concentration of MeOH solution 
was fixed at 3 wt%.  The value was decided actual value of 
the DMFC. Liquid was kept at room temperature.   Figure 6 
shows the velocity shift and normalized attenuation change 
as a function of concentration of formic acid.  The velocity 
shift of the 155 MHz SH-SAW sensor is almost constant and 
the attenuation change is smaller than one of the 51.5 MHz 
SH-SAW sensor.  The figure also exhibits that a high 
frequency SH-SAW sensor must be used to realize a MeOH 
sensor for the DMFC. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A MeOH sensor for a DMFC is required.  In this paper, 
influences of the SH-SAW sensor for senor responses are 
experimentally and theoretically discussed.  The MeOH 
solution can be assumed nonelectrolyte when the SH-SAW 
sensor frequency is high.  From the results, the 155 MHz 
SH-SAW sensor is enough for this application.  The 
advantage of using high frequency SH-SAW sensor is to 
reduce the influence of the conductivity.  For the actual

DMFC, the formic acid is involved in the fuel solution.  
Obtained results in this paper suggest the means of the 
solving.  Using the high frequency SH-SAW sensor, the 
MeOH concentration is determined from only the phase shift.  
Therefore, low price and simple measurement system will be 
realized using the high frequency SH-SAW sensor.
