Abstract—Even though the relevance of the “human factor” on
the performance of work processes is well known, the design
and optimization of such processes, e.g., in factories, often
strongly focuses on machines. Especially intrinsic mental states
such as strain and motivation can inﬂuence the human workers’
performance and thus the organizational outcome. This paper is
based on a previous agent-based model of human work processes
and extends this model using Atkinson’s theory of achievement
motivation. The combination of the job demands-resources model
with a more advanced motivation theory allows for a more
sophisticated and realistic modeling of task selection based on its
difﬁculty, individual competencies, and perceived attractiveness.
Experiments are presented, to demonstrate the model’s capability
to simulate human work performance and the mutual inﬂuences
between job demands, resources, personal resources, as well as
the intrinsic mental states of strain and motivation.

INTRODUCTION
In previous work, the relevance and impact of the “hu-
man factor” on the performance of work processes has been
outlined and a model for the simulation of human work
performance based on strain and motivation has been proposed
[1]. This is relevant, as peoples’ workplaces are constantly
changing, especially as digitalization progresses, and as we
believe that this digital revolution should be oriented towards
employees’ needs. Yet, people often subordinate to IT sys-
tems and thus disempower themselves [2]. For example, a
scheduling system in a call center distributes incoming calls
without considering individual needs of the call center agents.
Consequences are not only physical but also psychological
strains like burn-out.
Digital transformation should not be rejected in general as
it has the potential to make work processes more efﬁcient. Cur-
rent approaches for designing and optimizing work processes,
e.g., the production of goods in a factory, often make use
of simulation and focus on machine processes. Examples are
predictive maintenance or throughput time optimization. Here,
downtimes of machines or queuing strategies are analyzed to
identify optimal process conﬁgurations. In reality, however,
human workers can also inﬂuence the performance of such
production processes, e.g., due to unavailability, distraction,
or overload. Existing frameworks for the analysis of industrial
service provision processes often neglect the human factor and
only allow for the modeling and simulation of machines in
production lines.
In a production plant, human workers may be assigned a se-
ries of orders with different difﬁculties to be processed during
the working day. The workers’ performance can be measured
by the ratio of completed orders in relation to the total
number of orders. While machines do not show performance
ﬂuctuations when being confronted with an immense workload
or time pressure, human workers tend to be susceptible to
such inﬂuences. Intrinsic processes of motivation and strain
are driving factors inﬂuencing their performance [3]. Still,
during the planning and implementation of work processes,
human beings are often only considered as workforces without
individual intrinsic needs, even though their signiﬁcance and
importance are well known, e.g., modeling of humans in
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). To achieve
a more adequate integration of humans into these processes as
well as to increase performance and organizational outcome,
individuals and their intrinsic needs must be represented indi-
vidually and realistically.
Based on these considerations, the authors of this arti-
cle have developed an agent-based model of human work
performance by utilizing the Job Demands-Resources model
(JDR model), which includes motivation and strain as intrinsic
mental states [1]. They investigated the agents’ performance in
a simple work context in which orders of various difﬁculties
need to be completed in a limited time. In different simulation
experiments, plausible results were generated that conﬁrm the
mutual inﬂuence of motivation and strain.
This paper adapts the previous model and presents two
main extensions that focus on the deﬁnition of motivation by
using Atkinson’s motivation theory [4] as well as on the impact

of strain on the duration of order processing using a Perfor-
mance Moderator Function (PMF) [5]. This allows for a more
sophisticated and realistic modeling of individual task selection
based on the tasks’ difﬁculty, individual competencies, and
the subjectively perceived attractiveness of tasks. To model
workers and their behavior, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
and especially the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture
of practical reasoning [6] are used, which are established in
modeling of human cognitive decision-making [7]–[10].
The article is structured as follows. In Section II, related
work on the ﬁeld of modeling strain and motivation in ABM
is presented and discussed. In this regard, the concept of
performance motivation is introduced, which serves as a theo-
retical basis for extending motivation in the proposed model.
Furthermore, the ﬂexible Job Demands-Resources model is
introduced, which is well-established in psychology and in-
vestigates factors in the working environment that may lead
to burn-out, especially focusing on those factors causing a
stressful situation and mental effort for the worker [11].
Subsequently, an extended agent-based model of work per-
formance is introduced in Section III. In Section IV, the
results of simulation experiments are discussed to analyze
the model’s adequacy to represent human work performance.
Finally, Section V provides a summary as well as an outlook
on future work.

BACKGROUND
There are several frameworks for modeling and optimizing
industrial processes, e.g., Enterprise Dynamics or Anylogic
[12], which strongly focus on functionalities of machines in
manufacturing. These frameworks lack in the representation
of human resources such that the ”human factor” cannot be
considered properly when measuring the overall performance.
However, other areas, e.g., the representation of social net-
works, lay emphasis on an adequate representation of human
beings. Here, agent-based models that utilize sociological and
psychological behavioral theories are well-established [13]–
[15]. This article introduces an extended agent-based model
of human work performance including the intrinsic processes
of strain and motivation, which in future work could be used to
represent workers in existing frameworks. In the following, we
discuss existing work on agent-based models including stress
and motivation formation and present the psychological JDR
model, that serves as the basis for our implementation.
A. Modeling and Simulation of Strain
In ABM, various approaches exist that include psychologi-
cal strain in behavioral development. Silverman’s generic agent
architecture contains a working memory (BDI decision logic)
and four subsystems: Physiological System, Emotive System,
Cognitive System and Motor/Expressive System [16]. In the
strictly modularized approach, the calculation of an integrated
stress value is part of the Physiological System, which is
deﬁned as a function of exhaustion, time pressure, and event
strain. Fatigue is represented via available physiological re-
sources and time pressure results from perceived stimuli. Event
strain is the result of negative emotions of the Emotive System
[17]. Based on these variables, different coping strategies are
initiated using a PMF. Silverman proposes an inverted-U
shaped PMF, which was ﬁrst introduced by Janis & Mann
and has since been replicated and validated several times.
Depending on the integrated stress value, different coping
strategies are chosen: Unconﬂicted Adherence and Change,
Vigilance, Defensive Avoidance, and Panic. This PMF is
characterized by an activating effect of stress on performance
in addition to the limiting effects [5]. Duggirala et al. apply
this conceptual model in an agent-based simulation of strain
at work [18]. They selected the variables task arrival volume,
pending tasks, and work hours to calculate the integrated strain
value and to determine the coping strategies. However, by
choosing work hours for determining exhaustion, they have
missed Silverman’s consideration of individual resources.
Ashlock and Cage also simulate strain at work using an
agent-based model and a strain factor consisting of individual
strain tolerance and number of stressors [19]. Still, strain is
difﬁcult to quantify and validate, especially using static math-
ematical formulas that are limited to a number of variables.
For this reason, Morris et al. investigated system dynamics of
strain to model agents by representing strain as causal loop
diagram and stock-ﬂow diagram [20]. In the BDI extension
BRIDGE, strain is, similar to Silverman’s approach, part of
the implicit behavior and only inﬂuences the deﬁciency needs
and overrules selected intentions [21]. Another broad research
ﬁeld, in whose models strain is also considered, (e.g., [22]), is
crowd simulation. Strain inﬂuences behavior generation mainly
reactively, but this is due to the frequent application context
of emergency evacuations, where deliberative behavior is less
important.
Most models include two aspects: Firstly, the models focus
on stimuli during the genesis of strain and secondly in doing
so, they neglect the consideration of resources that can signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the amount of strain generated. Such models do
not recognize strain as the result of intrinsic processes although
psychology has already sufﬁciently shown the degree to which
cognitive processes occur regarding strain for a long time (e.g.,
[23]).
B. Modeling and Simulation of Motivation
In ABM, when considering motivation as part of the
decision-making process, models can be distinguished by the
motivations’ directionality, i.e., whether motivation is caused
by external factors or if it is merely generated intrinsically by
the individual. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as an intrinsically
oriented motivation theory, e.g., is implemented by Spaiser
and Sumpter [24] as well as Silverman [16]. In these models,
the agent’s actions focus primarily on covering deﬁciency and
growth needs, and mostly neglect environmental inﬂuences on
motivation development. As mentioned above, the BRIDGE
architecture also uses this theory to deﬁne an agent’s goals and
desires [21]. Using Vroom’s extrinsically oriented expectation
theory, the agent’s decision making is modeled on the basis
of its expected subjective value of a future event in his
environment [25] [26].
Following Atkinson’s concept of achievement motivation
[4], behavior is aimed at the self-assessment of a competency,
in confrontation with a standard of quality that one wishes
to achieve or exceed [27, p.59]. Achievement motivation is af-
fected both by external tendencies Tex (e.g., striving for reward
or avoiding punishment) and internal tendencies Ti, which re-
sult from the conﬂict of hope for success Ts = Ms · Ws · As
and fear of failure Tf = Mf · Wf · Af, where
241

•
Ms(Mf) represents the success (failure) motive (sta-
ble disposition of a person, describing the capability
to experience pride when having success (Ms) and
shame when being unsuccessful (Mf)),
•
Ws(Wf) is the subjective expectancy of success (fail-
ure) (a person’s expectancy that an action leads to an
anticipated goal (or not); this variable changes due to
experience), with Ws + Wf = 1, and
•
As(Af) is the incentive of a success (failure) (a
person’s pride exceeds with difﬁculty of a given task)
[27, pp. 59].
Individuals with a motive proﬁle of Ms > Mf are success-
oriented, which means that they tend to look for goals that
they want to achieve. These are achieved by minimizing the
difference between the current status and the goal status. In
contrast to this, a motive proﬁle of Ms < Mf means that these
individuals are failure-oriented. They tend to avoid failure by
maximizing the distance between the current status and the
goal status [28]. Atkinson also states that the incentive for
success can be described as As = 1 − Ws (cf. [4, p. 94]) and,
thus, solely depends on the subjective expectancy of success.
This is based on the assumption that accomplishing a task that
appears to be very difﬁcult and, therefore, probably not achiev-
able is perceived more attractive than an easily accomplishable
task [4, p. 94]. A similar thought applies to the incentive for
failure Af. If an individual deﬁnes a task as easy to accomplish
with a high value of Ws, the shame and embarrassment felt by
the individual is also high in case the accomplishment of this
task fails. Therefore, the incentive of failure can be described
as Af = −Ws. This leads to an adaption of the resulting
tendency to Tr = (Ms−Mf)·(Ps−P 2
s ). Among other things,
e.g., the persistence in completing a task [29] [4, pp. 110],
achievement motivation can be used to explain the selection
of tasks of various degrees of difﬁculty [4, p. 99].
Achievement motivation has, so far, only been used in
a few agent-based models. For instance, Merrick and Shaﬁ
(2013) investigated the effect of the three motive proﬁles of
achievement, power, and afﬁliation motivation in situations of
several mixed motive games. The authors demonstrate that the
perception of the agents differs from each other according to
their current motive proﬁle composition [30]. Di Pietrantonio
et al. developed an agent-based model of organizational work
performance based on both the workers’ abilities as well as
their motivational needs [32]. Therefore, they also make use
of the Three Needs Theory [31], which includes the motive
proﬁles of achievement, afﬁliation, and power motivation.
The authors investigate the effect of different motive proﬁle
distributions and the workers’ own abilities while working in
teams on the overall performance, which is deﬁned as the
number of completed tasks after a speciﬁc number of time
steps [32]. To the authors’ knowledge, Atkinson’s achievement
motivation model is only sparsely used in ABM. Among just
a few others, Merrick [33] uses this motivation theory. She
utilizes an experiment from human psychology and simulates
it with agents to prove the suitability of the concept for use in
an agent-based model.
The introduced approaches for ABM of motivation mainly
rely on subjectively perceived environmental factors and
largely neglect the mutual inﬂuence of intrinsic factors, e.g.,
between perceived strain and motivation, although the relation
between these factors has already been described, e.g., by
Dignum et al. [21].
A well-known model that both considers stressors (stimuli),
resources, and the inﬂuence of motivation, is the JDR model
by Demerouti et al. [11]. The JDR model is an empirically
evaluated model that has been ﬂexibly used in a variety of
scenarios such as to predict job burn-out [34], organizational
commitment [35], connectedness [36], and work engagement
[37]. The model consists of two processes: a health impairment
process and a motivational process (see Figure 1). The health
impairment process is concerned with how job demands affect
individual strain. Job demands can be stressors like workload,
emotional demands, or organizational changes [38].
As part of the motivational process, job resources are main
predictors for motivation and engagement. While job demands
consume energetic resources and cause strain, job resources
fulﬁl basic psychological needs and generate motivation. Thus,
job demands and resources initiate two different processes but
these processes are not independent because job resources can
buffer the impact of job demands on strain and job demands
can reduce the generation of motivation through job resources
(see Figure 1). Due to these moderation effects, there is also a
direct relationship between strain and motivation. By using the
model, predictions can be made about employee well-being,
job-performance, and respectively the aggregated performance
of a company.

The model was extended several times by the authors, in
particular to include job crafting and self-undermining, and
was transferred into a theory based on several meta-analyses
[3], [40]. In this work, one of the ﬁrst extensions of the model
is used to signiﬁcantly reduce the complexity of the simulation
and to focus on the prediction of job performance [39].
III.
AN AGENT-BASED MODEL OF WORK PERFORMANCE
In this section, an extended agent-based model of human
work performance is introduced that combines the BDI ar-
chitecture and the JDR model presented in Section II. The
workers are modeled based on the BDI architecture of practical
reasoning [6], which organizes goals (desires), information
about the environment and the own conditions (beliefs), and
action-oriented measures (intentions) into mental states. To
this end, we also make use of the JDR model presented in
Section II. By utilizing both models, a strict modularization
is achieved, which can be easily extended and exchanged by
other theories and models.
Figure 2 shows the basic concept of the agent-based
model of human work performance. Following the JDR model,
242

the agent’s environment consists of sets of JobDemands,
JobResources, and PersonalResources that impact internal
processes forming strain (α) and motivation (ζ). These, in
turn, determine the agent’s action as well as the corresponding
duration of the action and, thus, the organizational outcomes.
Here, this is equal to the individual performance.
Referring to the factory example introduced in Section I,
the agent is confronted with a set of Orders that is composed
of the two sets UnﬁnishedOrders and FinishedOrders (Equa-
tion (1)). Initially, |Orders| is equal to |UnﬁnishedOrders|.
If an order i ∈ UnﬁnishedOrders is completed, it is deleted
from this set and added to FinishedOrders. Each of the orders
has a certain difﬁculty diﬀi ∈ N, which is deﬁned within a
range of set difﬁculties. The difﬁculty of an order expresses
how much time is required to execute it. As job demands
represent stressors like workload (see Section II), diﬃculties
is introduced, which represents the agent’s workload on one
working day. It is composed of the sum of difﬁculties diﬀi for
each i ∈ UnﬁnishedOrders (Equation (2)).
Orders = FinishedOrders
[
UnﬁnishedOrders
(1)
diﬃculties =
|UnﬁnishedOrders|
X
i=1
diﬀi
(2)
A working day is deﬁned by a number of time steps
totalTime ∈ N, where t ∈ N represents the current time that
has already elapsed. At each time step, the remainingTime
to complete all UnﬁnishedOrders is computed (Equation (3)).
The difﬁculty level corresponds to the minimum number of
time units required to process an order and depends on the
agent’s skillRank ∈ N, i.e., its work-related know-how. A
lower value of skillRank means that less time units are needed
to complete one difﬁculty level. The skillRank together with
the overall remainingTime to complete all orders form the
agent’s set of JobResources.
The agent’s set of PersonalResources is comprised of its
general motives motiveSuccess ∈ N and motiveFailure ∈ N
as well as its own selfEﬃcacy ∈ R. The motives are based
on Atkinson’s achievement motivation model introduced in
Section II, that is used as the underlying motivation the-
ory. selfEﬃcacy represents the subjectively perceived com-
petence to perform actions effectively [41] [42]. The agent’s
PersonalResources can be gathered from an input of empirical
data (see Section V).
remainingTime = totalTime − t
(3)
Job demands initiate a health impairment process that affects
the agent’s individual strain. Job resources, on the other hand,
have a moderating effect on strain and buffer the impact of
the job demands. strain (Figure 2, Function α) represents
the experienced pressure as the ratio between the unﬁnished
orders diﬃculties and the remainingTime to complete them
(Equation (4)).
α: strain =
diﬃculties
remainingTime
(4)
Motivation is formed in a process that is inﬂuenced by job
resources, job demands, and personal resources. Based on the
achievement motivation introduced in Section II, we require
the two motives motiveSuccess and motiveFailure as well
as the subjective probability of success to deﬁne motivation
for this model. In [1], motivation is deﬁned as the general
and objective probability that “represents whether the agent is
able to perform the open orders in the given time based on its
own skillRank at time t”. As this deﬁnition does not yet take
into account individual motives and subjective probabilities,
it is used to represent the objective probability of success at
time t objProbt (Figure 2, Function β) (see Equation (5)). As
objProbt represents a probability, its value is normalized to
the interval [0,1]. A higher value of this variable implies that
the agent is objectively capable of completing the whole set
of unﬁnished orders in the remaining time.
β: objProbt =
remainingTime
skillRankt · diﬃculties
(5)
The subjective probability of success for a speciﬁc order
difﬁculty subjProbSdiﬀ ∈ [0,1], on the one hand, is composed
of a general and objective probability objProbt. The subjec-
tive component of subjProbS is introduced by the agent’s
selfEﬃcacy ∈ [0,1], which deﬁnes the agent’s own conviction
of being able to complete tasks of high complexity [42].
Nicholls [43] states that this reﬂects Atkinson’s assumption
that the “degree of difﬁculty can be inferred from the subjective
probability of success” [28, p.362]. Furthermore, the inﬂuence
of selfEﬃcacy on an agent’s performance reduces with in-
creasing task complexity [41]. Thus, the agent’s subjProbS is
represented by the decay of selfEﬃcacy based on the objective
probability to complete all remaining orders and referring to
the level of difﬁculty of the respective order (see Equation (6)).
subjProbSdiﬀ = selfEﬃcacy(1−objProbt)·diﬀ
(6)
Consequently, the subjective probability of success is used
to deﬁne motivation (Figure 2, Function ζ) for each remaining
order difﬁculty diﬀ as follows:
ζ: motivationdiﬀ = (motiveSuccess − motiveFailure)·
(subjProbSdiﬀ − subjProbS 2
diﬀ )
(7)
For the purpose of simplicity, we neglect the external
tendency Tex for now, since we assume a controlled environ-
ment without an external reaction as reward or punishment
to the work done. As the next task to accomplish (Figure 2,
Function γ), the agent always selects the difﬁculty of available
orders for which the highest motivation value motivationdiﬀ
exists (see Equation (8)).

to the minimal and maximal possible values of the variables.

performance is measured using the ratio of FinishedOrders
to the overall number of Orders (Equation (10)).

(10)
The algorithm in Figure 2 shows the BDI control cycle
that determines the agent’s behavior formation process. First,
the internal states as well as a variable determining the next
action to perform are initially set (lines 1-4). Based on the
general BDI architecture, the agent’s behavior in our model is
formed by passing various phases that consider and construct
the mental states. These can be divided into react, decide, and
execute (see [44]). In react (belief-revision-function (brf)), the
agent processes perceived information and updates its beliefs
(B) about the current situation and intrinsic states. In decide,
based on the updated beliefs and the agent’s desires (D), the
agent updates its intentions (I). Considering these, an action
to perform next is chosen, before it is carried out in execute.
The
agent’s
beliefs
B
are
composed
of
the
four
sets JobDemands, JobResources, PersonalResources, and
IntrinsicStates (see Equation (11)). Based on the beliefs B
that are generated and updated in react, the agent decides for
an unﬁnished order to proceed with next, to reach its sole
desire, i.e., completing all orders.
B = JobDemands

JobResources

PersonalResources
[
IntrinsicStates
⇒ B = {diﬃculties, remainingTime, skillRank,
motiveSuccess, motiveFailure,
selfEﬃcacy, strain, motivation}
(11)
In the decide phase, the agent decides for a difﬁculty diﬀ of
orders it wants to process next. For this, the agent computes
motivation values for each remaining difﬁculty and decides
for a difﬁculty with the highest motivation and, thus, for the
intention I to commit to (see Figure 2, Function γ). Conse-
quently, decide is only processed if the current order has been
completed in the preceding time step. The chosen difﬁculty (I)
is used to pick the next order (action) to complete, which is
then performed in execute. Starting from the initial value, the
skillRank adapts in dependence to the values of motivation
and strain (decrease or increase of value) and to the current
order’s difﬁculty (strength of decrease or increase of value)
(Figure 2, Function δ). Furthermore, based on the expected

time needed to complete an order in comparison to the actual
time that it takes for the agent, the value of selfEﬃcacy is
modiﬁed. If the agent is performing as expected (deﬁned by
thresholds Ω2 and Ω3) the value is slightly increased and if
the productivity strongly deviates it is slightly decreased, so
if strain is transcending the thresholds Ω1 and Ω4 (see, e.g.,
[42]). After each time step t, the performance is used to
update the orders’ difﬁculties.

SIMULATING WORK PERFORMANCE: EXPERIMENTS
AND RESULTS
In this section, the agent-based model of work performance
is evaluated based on a case study and compared to previous
simulation results from [1]. First, the main ﬁndings from the
initial paper are presented. Then, the simulation setup for
this article’s model is deﬁned and the additional model input
variables are speciﬁed. Finally, the ﬁndings are presented and
the assumptions derived from these are discussed.
This article’s model presents an extension of the agent-
based model of work performance deﬁned in [1]. The authors
speciﬁed the agent’s initial skillRank, the diﬃcultyRange,
which represents the range of difﬁculties, orders in the exper-
iment can have and the available timeCapacity (see Table I).
Furthermore, the number of Orders is set to 20 and the
maximum value of the agent’s skillRank is ﬁxed at 10.
After 30 replications of each deﬁned experiment, Figure 4
shows the results separated by the variation of timeCapacity,
whereas the x-axis depicts the initial input value of the variable
skillRank. The y-axis shows the performance of the agent.
The boxplots’ colors represent the orders’ diﬃcultyRange,
darkgrey represents a range of 1-3, lightgrey for 1-5, and white
for a range of 3-5.

The authors discuss three main ﬁndings as well as several
observations from the experiment results:
1)
An increasing timeCapacity leads to increased per-
formance: In a scenario with a high timeCapacity,
the agent is capable to complete all or a majority
of orders in the given time, without considering the
respective skillRank.
2)
A low skillRank does not equal a high performance:
The performance is represented via the ratio of ﬁn-
ished orders. Agents with a skillRank of 1 tend to
choose orders of a high difﬁculty and, thus, ﬁnish
less orders in summary because of the adaption in
skillRank after a bad performance and the respective
strain and motivation.
3)
A diﬃcultyRange of 3-5 leads to the worst perfor-
mance: Thus, the mean performance throughout the
simulation runs is 0.52, whereas ranges 1-3 and 1-5
lead to mean values of 0.69 and 0.63. This leads to
the conclusion that a balanced order compilation is
more purposeful as it, on the one hand, demands the
worker enough to keep his interest and, on the other
hand, allows for phases of lower concentration while
completing orders of a low difﬁculty level [45].

Furthermore, the authors address some exceptions to their
main ﬁndings, namely:
•
In small timeCapacity and skillRank = 1 the per-
formance is worse for the order difﬁculties in a range
of 1-5 as for 3-5,
•
in small timeCapacity and skillRank = 5 as well as
in suitable timeCapacity and skillRank = 5 or 10
the performance is worse for the order difﬁculties in
a range of 1-3 as for 1-5 and
•
a skillRank of 10 leads to extreme performance
measures without outliers.
The ﬁrst two exceptions are explained by the way strain
and motivation as well as choosing a next order difﬁculty are
deﬁned in the model. In both exceptions, the agent chooses
high difﬁculties ﬁrst which, caused by the progressing time,
leads to increasing strain and decreasing motivation and
ultimately to less ﬁnished orders. The third exception is due
to a low motivation value resulting from the high skillRank
as well as the restriction of the model to generate a higher
skillRank than 10. With decreasing remainingTime, the
strain value increases and the skillRank is not allowed to
improve.
A. Simulation Setup
In this article, the agent-based model of work performance
from [1] is extended by making use of a speciﬁc motivation
theory, the achievement motivation deﬁned by Atkinson as well
as the effect of strain on the ticks needed to complete an
order (see Section III). To be able to compare the simulation
outcomes of the extended model and the basic model, further
variable speciﬁcations need to be mentioned.

The adapted model in Section III introduces the set
of PersonalResources as an additional input of the JDR
model. The set composes of the variables motiveSuccess,
motiveFailure and selfEﬃcacy. To include these parameters,
the scenario speciﬁcation in Table I needs to be adapted.
Following [46], a possible way to obtain these person-speciﬁc
motives is a questionnaire containing of 10 items, which can
take values of 1 to 5 each. Here, ﬁve items refer to the motive
for success and ﬁve belong to the motive for failure. Thus,
motiveSuccess and motiveFailure each can take values in
the interval [0,20]. In the scenarios deﬁned in this experiment,
these variables vary in steps of ﬁve, leading to a set of [5,
10, 15, 20]. Equally, the value for selfEﬃcacy can be derived
with a questionnaire (see e.g., [47]), and in this model can take
values between 0.25 to 1.0 in steps of 0.25. Accordingly, 1728
experiments are deﬁned (timeCapacity (3) × diﬃcultyRange
(3) × skillRank (3) × motiveSuccess (4) × motiveFailure (4)
× selfEﬃcacy (4) = 1728). Additionally, the value of ticksdef ,
that is needed in PMF (see Equation (9)) to determine
the productivity, is set to the agent’s current skillRank, as
this variable was deﬁned as the number of ticks needed to
complete one difﬁculty of an order. Because the model includes
stochastic processes each experiment is repeated 30 times.
B. Simulation Results and Discussion
The simulation results in Figure 5 show the experimental
results separated by timeCapacity. As in Figure 4, the x-axis
shows the initial input of skillRank and the y-axis shows the
output of the agent’s performance. The boxplots separate by
color in the three available difﬁculty ranges 1-3 (darkgrey),
1-5 (lightgrey) and 3-5 (white). The overall tendencies de-
scribed earlier in this section remain for the adapted model
presented here, too: With an increasing timeCapacity the
agent’s performance increases. Hence, the mean performance
value increases for skillRank of 10 and diﬃcultyRange of 3-
5 from 0.16 in small timeCapacity to 0.47 in a scenario with
a high timeCapacity. Second to that, the diﬃcultyRange of
3-5 leads to the worst performances of a mean value of 0.42,
whereas ranges of 1-3 and 1-5 lead to performance means of
0.73 and 0.64.
Besides these general tendencies, the experiment output
shows some deviations from the initial paper. As stated above,
the diﬃcultyRange affects the performance in a way that high
difﬁculties (3-5) lead to the worst performances. In contrast
to the ﬁndings in [1], this effect is present in each scenario
separated by timeCapacity and skillRank. A reason can be
found in the deﬁnition of motivation of the original model
that is ultimately dependent on the input parameters (e.g.,
remainingTime). Based on that calculation of motivation, in
some scenarios the agent always chooses the highest difﬁculty
available. In comparison, motivation here is extended by the
personal motive proﬁle of the agent. Agents with a higher
motiveSuccess as motiveFailure tend to decide for orders
with a medium probability of success (e.g., in a range of 1-5
the difﬁculty 3 is predominantly chosen), whereas an agent
with a higher value of motiveFailure than motiveSuccess
results in choosing border options (difﬁculties that are very
likely or very unlikely to complete successfully). This leads
to a higher distribution in the choice for options for each
of the deﬁned diﬃcultyRanges and thus to a decrease in
performance from the ranges 1-3 over 1-5 to 3-5.

Finally, a skillRank of 10 produces a less uniform picture
than in the original experiments. The values of the minimal
and maximal performances of these agents span a wider
value range of at a maximum 0.3 in a suitable timeCapacity
and diﬃcultyRange of 1-3. Overall, a skillRank of 10 still
produces the worst performances in each scenario, but espe-
cially in high timeCapacity, the comparison of the resulting
performance of the current model and the one in [1] shows an
increase of performance of 0.2 at a maximum. As is deﬁned
in the scenario speciﬁcation at the beginning of this section,
the maximum skillRank is set to 10. Therefore, this value can
not deteriorate due to the agent’s poor performance. On the
contrary, the skill of an agent can be improved based on a de-
creased strain and increased motivation value. Furthermore,
the presence of different motive proﬁle distributions leads to a
higher spread in a choice for difﬁculties. Additionally, agents
with an equally distributed motive proﬁle randomly choose one
of the orders, regardless of the respective difﬁculties [4, p.99].
As each of these decisions inﬂuences the agent’s overall perfor-
mance, due to the adapting variables strain and motivation,
the observed behavior can be explained.
To investigate the effect of different motivation proﬁle
distributions, Figure 6 shows the agent’s performance (on the
y-axis) separated by the available timeCapacity (x-axis). The
expressions HighLow, HighHigh, MediumMedium, LowLow
and LowHigh refer to the composition of the agent’s motive
proﬁle in the sequential order motiveSuccess followed by
motiveFailure. HighLow means that the agent under investi-
gation has a high value of motiveSuccess (here: 20), while
motiveFailure has a low value, e.g., of 5 (cf. Table II).
The two motive proﬁles HighHigh as well as LowLow are
not completely equally distributed. This is based on the fact
that equal values completely negate the effect of the respec-
tive other, which leads to a complete random selection of

difﬁculties. Therefore, in deviation from the experiments in,
e.g., [33] or [48] a ﬁfth motive proﬁle MediumMedium was
added, that represents this equally distributed motive proﬁle.
A proﬁle deﬁned as HighHigh is thus characterized as having
a maximum value of motiveSuccess and the second highest
value of motiveFailure. For the corresponding proﬁle LowLow
the value of motiveFailure is set to the higher value in
comparison to motiveSuccess.
Throughout the simulation runs, a motive proﬁle of
HighLow shows the best performance results with an overall
mean of 0.63. An agent’s best performance can be found at
high timeCapacity with a mean value of 0.79 and a maximum
of 1. In all scenarios, this motive proﬁle is capable of reaching
a maximum performance by completing all available orders.
An agent with a high motiveSuccess and a low motiveFailure
tends to choose a medium order difﬁculty (with a medium
probability of success), which could lead to a relatively con-
stant value of strain, since the progressing time is neither very
large nor very small. This, in turn, inﬂuences the time needed
for the next order deﬁned by the PMF.

In contrast to this, the proﬁle LowLow produces the worst
performance with a mean of 0.58. Compared to the motive
proﬁle LowHigh, which is often at a similar level, the mean
value only slightly differs from it with a distance of 0.01
at high timeCapacity (LowLow: 0.76 and LowHigh: 0.77).
LowHigh leads to extreme decisions due to the high proportion
of motiveFailure. Hence, in situations with time pressure, the
strain value either increases because the agent decides for a
difﬁcult order that demands a long processing time or slightly
decreases because the agent chooses the other extreme with
an easy and less time consuming order. This may explain the
wider output space for this proﬁle in small timeCapacity in
contrast to LowLow. On the other hand, in a scenario with
enough time (high timeCapacity) an agent with a LowLow
proﬁle chooses order difﬁculties more randomly, which can
lead to less ﬁnished orders. For the proﬁle LowHigh the agent
more probably relies on an order difﬁculty of 3, as with
decreasing time the subjective probability of success might
shift to this difﬁculty as time progresses (see Equation (6)).
An agent that has a high motiveSuccess as well as
motiveFailure possesses the second-highest performances
throughout the presented scenarios, whereas the mean perfor-
mance values duplicate those of HighLow in a small as well as
suitable timeCapacity. With such a proﬁle, the agent chooses
more randomly but with a shift towards the kind of decision-
making of HighLow due to motiveFailure = 15 rather than
20 (as it is the case in MediumMedium).
The motive proﬁle MediumMedium neglects the impact of
the two motives as they neutralize the impact of each other
(see Equation (7)). This agent chooses a difﬁculty based on a
random manner. This leads to a medium overall performance
of 0.60 and a mean of 0.78 in high timeCapacity. Here, the
performance is just as high as with a proﬁle of HighHigh.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this article, an extended agent-based model of human
work performance is presented that makes use of the JDR
model and was based upon the model presented in [1]. A
decision-behavior based on the general BDI architecture was
introduced and adapted to the processes deﬁned in the JDR
model including a representation of strain and motivation as
well as the mutual inﬂuences of job resources, job demands,
personal resources and intrinsic mental states. The motivation
is based upon a theoretical foundation of Atkinson’s achieve-
ment motivation and extended the deﬁnition of the original
model mentioned before. Within several experiments, the im-
pacts of the input variables timeCapacity, skillRank, and
diﬃcultyRange on the overall performance of the agents were
analyzed. Furthermore, the impact of different motive proﬁles
was investigated. The experimental results revealed that the
model is capable of producing realistic working performance
including intrinsic processes of strain and motivation. The
extension of the original model by achievement motivation
and PMF allows for a more sophisticated and realistic rep-
resentation of performance. Hence, different motive proﬁle
distributions lead to a decision behavior similar to empirical
ﬁndings in literature [4, p.99].
In future work, we plan on conducting empirical experi-
ments with workers in a controlled working environment (see,
e.g., [49]). In these experiments, we aim at identifying stressors
and resources and measure individual reactions like strain,
especially by biosignals (see, e.g., [49] [50] [51]). Additionally,
Atkinson’s achievement motivation relies on three general
determinants, whereas one of them (incentives As and Af) can
be fully represented by the probability of success. The motive
of success as well as the motive of failure can be measures
by using a revised Achievement Motive Scale (AMS-R) [46].
Furthermore, the general self-efﬁcacy of a person can be
measured using the Allgemeine Selbstwirksamkeitskurzskala
(ASKU) (General Self-efﬁcacy Short scale) [47]. To measure
the individually perceived workload of human test persons,
the NASA-TLX test could be used [52]. By using these mea-
surement scales, the subjectively perceived situation of the
respective test person can be included in the model.
Furthermore, we need to improve the existing model in
several respects. The model shows the best results for orders
within difﬁculty range 1-3. As discussed in Sec. IV-A, a varied
order difﬁculty should lead to best performances, due to a bal-
anced ratio of exertion and relaxation [45]. To receive a more
247

realistic representation, the effects of missing challenges could
be included. A difﬁculty range of 1-3 would thus theoretically
lead to a worse performance than a range of 1-5. The agents’
performance should be measured by showing how much of the
workload has been completed. Thus, not only the proportion
of ﬁnished orders, but the difﬁculties of the ﬁnished orders
should be taken into account, too. Additionally, the effect
of motivation as well as the motive proﬁles on persistence
could be investigated [4, pp.110ff] [29]. In this context, the
effect of orders that are not fully or incorrectly made could be
examined. Furthermore, working in teams should be included
in the model. This could result in improved organizational
outcomes as poor performances of some members may be
offset by good performances of others by the interaction.
