Abstract — When deployed in the real-world, many sensor 
nodes fail to deliver the expected data or deliver a small 
percentage of them. The reasons for such failures can be 
hardware problems, software problems or communication 
problems.  Among the communication problems is the 
insufficient received signal strength (RSS), which may cause 
unsuccessful packets delivery. For that reason, during the pre-
deployment phase the RF propagation must be considered for 
predicting the RSS so that it guarantees reliable connectivity 
level. The present work is devoted to study of the deployment 
factors 
and 
requirements, 
which 
can 
ensure 
reliable 
communication links among the sensor network nodes. 
Subsequently, they are considered by the proposed RF signal 
propagation-based connectivity algorithm (RFCA). RFCA 
utilizes an outdoor RF signal propagation model for predicting 
the RSS in the positions, where sensor nodes are supposed to 
be deployed. Several factors are considered during RSS 
prediction, namely RF frequency, transmission power, 
transmitter–receiver distance, height from the ground and 
antenna’s characteristics (gain, polarization, orientation, etc.). 
Different outdoor propagation models are discussed and 
analyzed with respect to their applicability to RSS prediction. 
Finally, an example illustrates that RFCA is able to find the 
most appropriate, from the communication point of view, 
deployment parameters (height, distance, and transmission 
power) for positioning the sensor nodes in outdoor 
environment.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Sensor nodes’ deployment reflects two main aspects of a 
wireless sensor network (WSN), namely sensing and 
communication. The deployment process can be considered 
as consisting of three consequent phases: pre-deployment, 
actual 
deployment 
and 
post-deployment. 
The 
pre-
deployment phase includes analysis of the application 
requirements and of the area environment followed by 
deployment simulation and planning in order to ensure WSN 
requirements such as coverage, connectivity, optimal energy 
budget and low packet loss in the physical layer.  
Several deployment algorithms propose solutions for the 
coverage problems when minimizing the number of 
deployed nodes [2] and [3] and the connectivity problems 
with respect to the optimal number of neighbors [4]. 
However, one communication aspect is not addressed 
adequately as a deployment prerequisite and that is the RF 
signal propagation. The knowledge of radio wave 
propagation and its modeling is essential for deploying a 
WSN in such a way to ensure reliable communication among 
the network nodes. A communication link is considered as 
guaranteed when the received signal strength (RSS) is 
sufficient.  
Different RF propagation models have been introduced 
in the literature for supporting the wireless communication 
system design [5-7]. Most of these propagation models have 
been studied for high-power wireless communication 
systems, which operate at distances in the range of 
kilometers and they are not directly applicable to WSNs. 
However, some of them still could be used in RSS prediction 
with justification of the environment and conditions for their 
use. In general, the RF propagation is environment-
dependant and the choice of an appropriate propagation 
model, for a specific environment, is crucial for the success 
of any RSS prediction.  
For predicting the RSS, several parameters of the system 
have to be considered: the distance between transmitter–
receiver pair (T-R), their height from the ground, the 
antenna’s characteristics (gain, polarization, etc) and the 
terrain specifics.  
In some studies, involving WSN, the deployment and the 
RF propagation are not discussed at all as a factor 
influencing the communication link between two sensor 
nodes, but just mentioned that the communication link is 
good within certain distance. In others [9], [10] and [11] the 
received power is modeled with log-normal path loss model, 
which model does not include the influence of the T-R 
heights and the ground reflection over the RF signal 
propagation. Such assumptions lead to the common belief 
that the communication between two sensor nodes is good 
until certain distance and worsen after it. As we will discuss 
in the fallowing sections there are several factors that 
influence the successfulness of the wireless communication 
and they have to be considered during the pre-deployment 
planning. 
This work discusses the deployment factors that are of 
importance for ensuring reliable communication among the 
sensor nodes. It elaborates on the previous work [1], where 
the RF signal propagation-based Connectivity Algorithm 
(RFCA) is discussed. RFCA incorporates the signal 
propagation model and the deployment factors into the pre-
deployment WSN planning. It utilizes a RF signal 
propagation model to predict the RSS within the radio ranges 
in order to identify the most appropriate communication-

based deployment parameters, i.e. T-R distance, height from 
the ground, and transmission power. It consists of four 
sequential steps: (1) distance and height prediction; (2) 
transmission 
power 
simulations; 
(3) 
non-neighbor 
interference 
minimization; 
(4) 
deriving 
the 
optimal 
deployment parameters. RFCA is generic enough to be 
combined with any number-of-nodes optimization algorithm 
like [2-4] and [8].  
In the present work, we motivate the importance of using 
proper simulation model for a specific environment. For that 
reason, four propagation models are overviewed and 
taxonomy for their use in outdoor environments is offered. 
Real outdoor measurements are compared with the 
simulation results for verification of the proposed RF 
propagation models. 
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, the pre-deployment simulation framework is 
outlined and RFCA is presented. Section III presents a 
detailed description and analysis of the RFCA. Furthermore, 
an overview of some outdoor propagation models is 
presented together with simulated and measured results. A 
classification of the outdoor environments and the 
corresponding propagation models is also given. In Section 
IV, the RFCA reasoning is illustrated with an example for an 
environmental monitoring application scenario in an 
unobstructed environment. Finally, Section V concludes this 
work.  
II. 
PRE-DEPLOYMENT SIMULATION FRAMEWORK  
The pre-deployment simulation aims at analyzing the 
application 
requirements 
against 
the 
deployment 
environment to satisfy the sensor network’s prerequisites for 
degree of coverage, complete network connectivity, optimal 
energy budget and low percentage of packet loss due to the 
physical layer. Therefore, the pre-deployment simulation 
framework includes three basic simulations: sensing 
coverage, communication connectivity and in-network 
localization, as shown in Fig. 1.  
The sensing coverage simulation aims at ensuring the 
application requirement for coverage with the optimal 
number of sensor nodes. This component provides, along 
with the number of nodes for the given area, information 
about the possible heights from the ground of the sensor 
nodes and the minimum and maximum distance boundaries. 
The communication connectivity simulation extends the 
simulation process by matching the preferred nodes height 
and distance with ones proposed by the signal propagation 
model. The most appropriate height and distance are the 
output from this component along with suggestions for 
reducing the transmission power. The last simulation is 
localization, which uses information about the number of 
nodes and preferred topology to simulate the nodes 
localization process based on already known parameters as 
height, distance and signal propagation. This step may also 
suggest correction of the nodes height and distances for 
better localization accuracy. The pre-deployment simulation 
framework can be used in two directions: (1) to evaluate 
quality provisioning of existing deployment topologies, and 
(2) to propose a deployment scheme based on input 
parameters.  
This work focuses mainly on the RFCA as the 
communication connectivity component, in which the 
deployment considerations for reliable communication are 
discussed and implemented. 
III. 
RF SIGNAL PROPAGATION-BASED CONNECTIVITY 
ALGORITHM  
In the literature the communication radius is often 
assumed to be at least twice as the sensing radius to support 
coverage with minimum number of nodes and complete 
communication connectivity [6, 7]. In some cases, this 
assumption might not be valid. For instance, given that the 
passive infrared (PIR) sensing radius is 10m, then the 
communication radius should be at least 20m according to 
the above-mentioned assumption. In this case, distance of 
20m cannot be reached, with sufficient RSS level, by sensor 
nodes such as Tmote Sky [14] and TelosB [15] with internal 
antenna only, even at the maximum transmission power of 
0dBm, if they are placed horizontally on the ground. 
Therefore, the RF signal propagation and certain deployment 
factors have to be considered and to go along with the 
optimal sensing coverage and localization algorithms when a 
WSN is designed.  
A. Algorithm Overview  
In order to incorporate the signal propagation and the 
deployment factors into the deployment planning an 
algorithm named RFCA was developed. Fig. 2 presents its 
block-diagram. RFCA consists of four steps: (1) Step 1 - 
distance and height prediction: It aims at discovering the 
most appropriate heights and distances of the sensor nodes, 
based on the input parameters; (2) Step 2 - transmission 
power simulations: Different levels of the transmission (Tx) 
power are simulated to evaluate the possibility of reduction; 
(3) Step 3 - non-neighbor interference minimization: In this 
step simulations are performed to evaluate the RSS level of 
the non-neighbor nodes in order to discover the best 
combination of distance, height and Tx power to minimize 
the interference from the unwelcome nodes; (4) Step 4 - 
Deriving the optimal deployment parameters: It aims at 
summarizing the results and at proposing the most 
appropriate deployment parameters according to initial 
criteria.

RFCA is applicable for outdoor applications, for 
manual and for random deployments: 
• 
For manual deployment when one parameter 
(height or distance) is known, the simulation aims at 
predicting the other parameter to guarantee sufficient 
RSS for deployment. For example, path (1) of Fig. 2 
uses as input parameter the height from the ground and 
calculates 
the 
appropriate 
distance 
for 
nodes’ 
positioning. 
• 
For random deployment scenario (nodes thrown 
out from a airplane) the nodes end up on the ground and 
the height of the antenna is between 2cm and 10cm. 
Based on the propagation model, on Tx power and on 
the node’s antenna specifics, it is possible to predict the 
maximum distance, where the signal has sufficient RSS 
level 
to 
guarantee 
successful 
communication. 
Considering this distance as maximum communication 
radius, the necessary number of nodes per unit area may 
be calculated to ensure network connectivity and 
certain degree of coverage. 
B. Algorithm attributes 
The factors that are of importance for successful 
physical communication are inputs parameters for the 
RFCA and are discussed in the following Section. As shown 
in Figure 2, RFCA takes as input height from the ground or 
the transmitter–receiver (T-R) distance and the RSS 
threshold. The antenna specifics (gain, polarization 
orientation) and propagation model need also be known in 
advance.  
1) RF propagation models, height from the ground and 
distance: The height from the ground and distance between 
any two sensor nodes are the most important parameters 
influencing the RSS. These two parameters participate 
directly in the propagation model equation. The relation 
between distance, height and RSS forms the propagation of 
the RF signal.  
Many different RF propagation models have been 
introduced for supporting the wireless communication 
system design. Most of these propagation models have been 
studied for high-power wireless communication systems 
like those for UHF/VHF band, satellite, cellular, etc. [5 - 7]. 
The assumption made by these models does not take into 
account some of the most distinctive features of WSNs, i.e. 
low-power radio, the antenna low height and the feature of 
omnidirectionality, which render the models unsuitable for 
WSNs. However, some of them still could be used in RSS 
prediction when justifying the environment and conditions 
under use. In general, the RF propagation is environment-
dependant and the choice of an appropriate propagation 
model, for a specific environment, is crucial for the success 
of any RSS prediction 
In the following some propagation models are 
overviewed and taxonomy for their use in outdoor 
environments is offered, in conjunction with their 
dependence on the height. 
a) Log-normal Path Loss Model (LPLM): LPLM [5] 
considers the received power as a function of the T-R 
distance raised to some power. Since this model is a 
deterministic propagation model and gives only the average 
value, another propagation model, known as log-normal 
shadowing model, defined by (1), was introduced to 
describe the RSS irregularity [5]. The received power, Pr(d), 
at distance d is given as:

where Xσ is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and 
standard deviation σ,  P0 is the received power at reference 
distance d0, and n is the path loss exponent factor. The path 
loss exponent n is environment-dependant. In general n is 2 
in free space model. However, in indoor obstructed 
environment n may take values between 4 and 6, and for 
outdoor obstructed – values between 3 and 5 [5]. 
P(d0), n and σ describe statistically the path loss model 
for any location in specific T-R distance. This model is used 
for computation and simulation of the received power at 
random locations. In Fig. 3(a) the LPLM model with n=3 is 
presented. 
b) Free-space + Two-ray Ground Reflection Model 
(FS+GR). 
LPLM is actually a simplistic approach as it does not 
allow obstructions to be taken into account. The greatest and 
unavoidable obstruction, when the wireless nodes are placed 
close to the ground is the earth surface. In order to model 
the ground influence on the signal, the basic Free Space + 
Ground Reflection (FS+GR) model equation of [5] is 
adopted for recalculating by including the ground reflection 
coefficient with its formulation given also in [5]. Thus, the 
final equation for Pr(d) is given as:

where λ is the  wavelength,  ε1 is the relative dielectric

The two-ray ground reflection model is useful to predict 
the RSS variance concerning the ground reflection over 
distances. It also could be used to calculate the most 
appropriate height from the ground of the T-R pair for 
certain T-R distance. 
c) Free-space Outdoor Model (FOM): This model was 
introduced firstly in our previous work [13]. Various RF 
signal-influencing factors, such as free-space path loss, 
ground reflection path loss, RSS uncertainty, variation of 
the transceivers, radio frequency gain inequality and 
antenna pattern irregularity are included in the model. The

d) Tree-obstructed Outdoor Model (TOM): In a tree-
obstructed environment the trees can be located in any order 
-random, line, or grid. The impact factors of the RF signal 
propagation through forest environment, apart from the 
common ones like height from the ground, T-R distance, 
ground reflection, antenna radiation pattern, and RSS 
variance, are also the trunk and vegetation diffraction and 
scattering. 
For sparse tree environment the base model could be 
FOM (equation (6)) with counting additionally the single-
tree effects over the RF signal such as: trunk diffraction and 
vegetation scattering. Considering the total propagation loss 
in decibels as LTOT = LM + Lveg, where LM  is the basic signal 
propagation loss in the media and Lveg is the propagation 
loss because of vegetation, we recalculate the PR trough LM  
and Lveg. Consequently, the final equation for the received 
power PR in decibels is:

When the trees are located close to each other, as it is in 
the thick forest environment, their influence over the RSS of 
the radio signal have to be examined as a whole, and the 
TOM may not be the best suited model. As it is shown in 
Fig. 3(a) the LPLM with n=3 successfully could be used to 
model the propagation in thick forest environment. 
e) Classification of the outdoor models: Based on the 
WSN application scenarios three outdoor types are 
identified depending on the presence of trees: thick forest, 
sparse garden and free space. A specific RF propagation 
model corresponds to each environment, predicting the RSS 
at any T-R distance. Fig. 5 depicts the three outdoor 
environments and the corresponding propagation models.  
The choice of the appropriate propagation model for a 
specific environment is crutial for the success of any RSS 
prediction. As shown in Fig. 3, where the measured and 
simulated results are compared, when using inappropriate 
RF propagation model and not taking into consideration the 
deployment factors during the pre-deployment phase, may 
lead to communication and data loss. 
f) Measured and simulated results: In order to 
investigate the eligibility of the proposed models, 
measurements and simulations have been conducted. The 
results presented in Fig. 3, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 confirm that the 
propagation model is environment-dependent.  
Real-field experiments have been conducted in a free 
space area of 100m x 50m, using Tmote Sky nodes [13], 
operating in the band of 2.4GHz with internal antenna and 
Tx power at the maximum of 0dBm. The process of 
measuring the RSS consists of the following steps: Every 
100msec the transmitter sends to the receiver a packet of 
length 21 Bytes, including one counter holding the number 
of packets sent. The counter reaches a maximum of 150,

indicating that at most 150 packets are sent for each 
distance. The receiver incorporates the RSS of the received 
packet in a 1-Byte field to the received packet and forwards 
it to the base station, connected through USB to a laptop. 
Fig. 3 shows that a thick tree obstructed environment, 
with trees located every 4-5m, is best modeled using LPLM 
with n=3 (Fig. 3(a)), while a free space without trees is 
adequately modeled with FOM, shown in Fig. 3(b).  Both 
measurements are taken for T-R height of 1.97m.  
Fig. 6 shows the measured RSS max, average and min 
value when the T-R pair is deployed at four different heights 
from the ground, 1.97m, 1.50m, 0.70m and 0.12m 
respectively. One important observation regarding the 
influence of the ground reflection phenomenon over the 
RSS is that the reflected and the direct signals interact and 
create regions, called ‘nulls’, with very low and unstable 
RSS. The plots in Fig. 6 present that the RSS is more 
variable in the areas with low RSS value, below -80dBm, 
and in the areas with ‘nulls’.  
Fig. 7 shows the average value of the real-field 
measured RSS for the fourth T-R heights from Fig. 6 
compared with simulated RSS with FOM.  All plots clearly 
demonstrate that data measured are in conformance with the 
simulation results. 
2) Antenna 
specifics: 
The 
antenna 
orientation, 
polarization and gain also influence the RSS. The antenna 
gain participates directly in the propagation model equation 
as coefficient K1 and K2 in (5), while the antenna 
polarization predetermines the reflection coefficient, as 
presented in (3). In the simulations, the coefficients ε1 and 
σ1 take values according to material parameters given in 
[3][4], that is ε1 = 15  and  σ1 =0.008S/m. The importance of 
the antenna particularities for the RSS prediction is 
described in detail in [12] and [13]. 
3) RSS 
threshold: 
A 
major 
communication 
consideration is the correct message reception. It is assumed 
that a packet sent by a transmitter can be received by a 
receiver with certain confidence, only if the intensity of the 
received power is above a given threshold. The relation 
between the intensity of the received power and the packet 
loss was empirically investigated to find whether such a 
threshold exists. The results are presented in Fig. 8 and the 
following conclusions can be drawn:  
• For RSS above -80dBm, packet loss is less than 5%  
• For RSS between -80dBm and -87dBm, packet loss rises 
to 10%.  
• For RSS approximately -90dBm, which corresponds to 
the sensitivity threshold of the CC2420 radio, packet loss 
can reach 100%. 
From the results in Fig. 8, we can conclude that the 
RSS value of -80dBm is an acceptable threshold level. It 
indicates that signals with RSS above -80dBm will be 
received with probability over 95%. Similar results have 
been presented in [8].

C. RFCA Definition 
This section presents a comprehensive description and 
analysis of the four steps of RFCA. The four steps are 
subsequent and the results of one task are inputs to the 
subsequent one.  
1) Step1 - Discovering the most appropriate heights and 
distances of the sensor nodes: The most important task for 
the first step is the selection of the propagation model that 
corresponds to the target environment. When assuming 
unobstructed environment, the appropriate model is FOM. 
Using FOM, the relation among RSS, height from the 
ground and distance are determined by simulation. During 
this simulation all practical heights from the ground and 
distances are combined to produce the RSS for the 
maximum Tx power of 0dBm. Fig. 9 presents the results of 
the simulation, where heights vary from 0m to 3m and the 
distance from 1m to 100m. The gray-scale bar is marked 
with numbers indentifying RSS areas. For instance, the area 
marked as 4 designates RSS values between -70dBm and -
80dBm. In general, Fig. 9 gives an idea about which heights 
and distances can be combined to achieve sufficient RSS for 
reliable communication. 
Based on the real-field measurements and simulation 
results presented in Fig.6, Fig.7 and Fig.9, the following 
constraints for choosing heights and distances are 
formulated: 
• the sensor node should not be placed in area with deep 
and wide ‘nulls’ due to the high variability of the signal 
and high possibility of signal and packet loss, 
• the sensor node should not be placed in areas with RSS 
lower then -80dBm due to great variance of RSS and 
higher probability of packet loss. 
 
 
2) 
Step 2-Reducing Tx power. The RSS simulation may 
also help to reduce the Tx power. Referring to Fig. 7, power 
simulations are performed for three heights from the ground 
(1.97m, 1.5m and 0.70m) and for distances of 25m and 50m 
for each height case. These distances were chosen according 
to Fig. 7, cases (b), (c) and (d), so that the RSS, at 25m, has 
the maximum value after a ‘null’ at maximum Tx power of 
0dBm. The power simulation results, presented in Fig. 10, 
illustrate that the Tx power could be reduced and still the 
RSS be above the threshold of -80dBm, as shown in Table I. 
 
 
 
3) Step 3-Minimizing the interference from non-
neighbor nodes:  
The neighborhood nodes should lie at distance where 
the RSS is more than -80dBm to guarantee min allowed 
percentage of packet loss, while the non-neighbor nodes 
should lie at distance where the RSS is about -90dBm, low 
enough to guarantee maximum percentage of packet loss. 
The simulation results about height and distance of 
Step1 and the power simulations of Step 2 are input 
parameters for Step 3, where nodes’ height, T-R distance 
and power are combined in order to satisfy the following 
requirement:   
• the RSS of a neighbor node should be above the min RSS 
threshold of -80dBm in order to guarantee that the 
messages will be received with packet loss below 5%.  
• the RSS of a non-neighbor node should be below the 
sensitivity threshold of -90dBm, in order to minimize the 
possibility to receive and send signals and thus to interfere 
the neighboring communication.  
For instance, let us assume the simple line topology of Fig. 
11, where the distance between any two neighbor nodes is 
25m and node 1 has to communicate with node 2 but should 
not communicate with node 3. In order to satisfy the above 
requirements, the T-R height is selected at 0.70m and the Tx 
power at -15dBm according to Fig. 10 (c). For this 
combination, the RSS is predicted as -80dBm at 25m for the 
neighbor node and as -91dBm at 50m for non-neighbor node, 
as shown with the ellipse in Fig. 12.

4) Step 4-Deriving the optimal deployment parameters: 
The final step aims at summarizing results and proposing 
the most appropriate deployment parameters according to 
initial criteria i.e. minimum node numbers, less neighbor 
nodes, minimum disturbance from the non-neighbors, etc. 
D. RFCA implementation 
The pseudo code of the RFCA implementation is shown 
in Fig. 13, consisting of four sequential tasks. Results of one 
task are inputs to the subsequent one. The final output is a 
vector with the optimal h/PTX/d combination or a matrix 
with a series of h/PTX/d satisfying the criteria. Input 
parameters are, the minimum and maximum height from the 
ground, Hmin and Hmax, the smallest and biggest neighbor 
distance, db and de, the minimum and maximum Tx power, 
PTXmin and  PTXmax, the velocity of light, c, the radio 
frequency, f, and the permittivity of the reflecting surface, 
εr. 
IV. 
CASE STUDY: APPLICATION OF RFCA TO A REAL 
DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLE 
In this section, the RFCA is illustrated through an 
example for an environmental monitoring application in 
unobstructed environment, where environmental parameters 
such as temperature and humidity are under observation.  
A. Application Requirements 
Application scenario: Environment monitoring 
Area type and size: 200m x 200m, open space 
Sensor nodes: Tmote Sky or Telos B 
Antenna type: Internal, inverted-F 
Deployment criteria: minimum disturbance from the non-
neighbor nodes with minimum Tx power 
B. Application Analysis 
The environmental parameters do not change in short 
distance. Therefore, the sensing radius is not decisive for the 
area coverage and the number of nodes. Referring to the RF 
propagation, shown in Fig. 7 and the requirements that the 
RSS should be more than -80dBm we can assume that one 
node per 50m - 70m would provide an acceptable degree of 
sensing coverage and reliable communication. Based on 
that, the distance as the input parameter is already known: d 
= 50m.  The first simulation assumes maximum Tx power 
of the Tmote Sky sensor nodes at 0dBm and distance for the 
neighbor nodes of approximately 50m.

One of the deployment goals is to optimize the number 
of nodes, which supposes manual deployment in grid 
topology [3]. The two most widely used deployment 
schemes for manual deployment are: square grid and 
triangular grid as shown in Fig. 14. While the triangular grid 
uses equal communication ranges among all six 1-hop 
neighbors, for the square grid a stable communication must 
be guaranteed in two radii R1 and R2 in order for a sensor 
node to communicate with its eight 1-hop neighbors. 
Assuming that the preferred communication range is 50m, 
then the communication range with complete connectivity is 
between R1=45m and R2=75m for square grid deployment, 
and R=45m−55m for triangular deployment with 5m 
deployment tolerance. 
The number of nodes N, where complete coverage and 
connectivity is assured, can be calculated as: 
 
where W is the area width, L is the area length, R is the 
communication range.  Consequently, for the square grid 
topology the number of nodes is N=25, and for the 
triangular grid is N=33.  
1) Step 1-Discovering the most appropriate heights and 
distances of the sensor nodes 
The most appropriate T-R heights, after the first 
simulation step are listed in Table II for square grid and 
Table III for triangular grid, respectively. Table II and Table 
III show only those heights, where the RSS is above -80dBm 
for the whole range of 45m–75m for the square grid and 
range of 45m–55m for triangular grid, as -80dBm is 
considered as an acceptable RSS threshold. The simulated T-
R heights are between 0m and 3m. 
2) Step 2-Reducing the transmission power 
 This step uses the results for T-R heights discovered in 
Step 1 to investigate the possibility of reducing the Tx 
power. Simulations are performed for both the square and 
triangular grids for the T-R  heights depicted in Table II and 
Table III as follows: (a) for square grid: distance range 
45m−75m, T-R height range 1m−1.5m and (b) for triangular 
grid: distance range 45m−55m, T-R height ranges 
0.70m−1.50m; 2.00m−2.20m; and 2.70m.  
 
Results presented in Fig. 15 show the minimum RSS 
value for the whole distance range at specific T-R height, 
for five levels of Tx power. The conclusions based on the 
results are:

• the most energy efficient combination of T-R height 
and Tx power for square grid is 1.4m and -6.5dBm, 
respectively.   
• the most energy efficient combination of T-R height 
and Tx power for the triangular grid is 1.3m and -10dBm,  
respectively. 
3) Step 3-Minimizing non-neighbor nodes interference  
Step 3 aims at satisfying the requirements discussed in 
Section III C, which are:  
• the RSS of a neighbor node should be above the min 
RSS threshold of -80dBm in order to guarantee that the sent 
messages  will be received with packet loss less than 5%. 
• the RSS of a non-neighbor node should be below the 
sensitivity threshold of -90dBm, in order to minimize the 
possibility to receive and send signals and thus to interfere 
the neighboring communication and to create huge data flow.  
For the square and triangular grid schemes, the distance 
to non-neighbor node is about double R and R1, i.e. 90m–
110m. Simulations are performed for the T-R heights and 
the Tx powers determined in Step 2, presented in Fig. 15 
and listed in Table IV. 
 The simulation results for thus step are presented in Fig. 
16 and Fig. 17, where the simulated RF signal propagation 
for distances between 45m and 110m for the T-R heights 
and Tx power taken from Table IV is shown. Based on this 
results the following conclusions are derived: 
(a) The square grid scheme cannot fulfill the requirement 
for minimizing the interference from non-neighbor nodes. 
For the chosen T-R heights and Tx powers of Table IV at 
distance 90m–110m the RSS still has value significantly 
above the radio sensitivity threshold of -90dBm, as shown 
in Fig. 16. 
(b) The triangular grid scheme can fulfill the requirement 
for minimizing the interference from non-neighbor nodes 
while ensuring good communication with the neighbor 
nodes only for the following heights and Tx power levels: 
0.7m with -2.5dBm; 0.8m with -4dBm, 0.9m with   -6.5dBm 
and 2.7m with -4dBm. This is presented in Fig. 17(a) and 
(b) with ellipses. The optimal combination for energy saving 
and reliable communication is T-R height at 0.9m and Tx 
power of -6.5dBm. 
 
 
 
C. Deriving the final deployment parameters 
Step 4 of RFCA aims at summarizing the results and at 
proposing the most appropriate deployment parameters. In 
this step, the evaluation of results from Step 3 is according 
to the initial criteria defined as application requirement. For 
the described example those are minimum disturbance from 
the non-neighbors nodes with minimum Tx power. Base on 
that are the following conclusions: 
1)  Square grid scheme: 
• The necessary number of nodes is N=25, neighbor 
nodes=8, 
• The most energy efficient height-power combination 
is T-R height of 1.4m and Tx power of -6.5dBm, 
• Cannot fulfill the requirement for minimizing the 
interference from non-neighbor nodes.

2) Triangular grid scheme: 
• The necessary number of nodes is N=33, neighbor 
nodes=6, 
• The most energy efficient height-power combination 
is T-R height of 1.3m and Tx power of -10dBm, 
• The height-power combinations, which satisfy the 
criterion of minimum disturbance from non-neighbor 
nodes, are: 0.7m/-2.5dBm, 0.8m/-4dBm, 0.9m/-6.5dBm 
and 2.7m/-4dBm. 
3) Deployment parameters: 
The 
final 
deployment 
parameters 
for 
reliable 
communication, which satisfy all the initial criteria, are 
determined as follows:  
• Height: 0.9m,  
• T-R distance: 50–55m,  
• Tx power: -6.5dBm,  
• Preferred deployment scheme: triangular grid, 
• Number of nodes: 33. 
 
The proposed methodology could be used also to scale 
down the topology in applications where the network 
performance is studied, when adjust the deployment 
parameters: height, distance and transmission power. For 
instance, the deployment parameters from the example 
above require distance between the sensors about 50m and 
number of sensors 33, which is quite a big area for 
coverage. In order to form the same topology, but in smaller 
area the deployment parameters are recalculated as follows: 
for distance 5m, the height from the ground is 12cm with 
transmission power of -11dBm. These parameters’ values 
ensure that the 1-hope neighbors can transmit and receive 
packets with RSS above -80dBm, when in the same time the 
RSS 
of 
the 
non-neighbor 
nodes 
transmission 
is 
approximately -90dBm.  This approach is used in [16] when 
the topology is formed in order to be tested the network 
performance expressed as message delivery delay, network 
throughput and packets dropping percentage due to multi-
hopping. 
V. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
This work discusses the importance of employing an 
algorithm, which can evaluate the sensor nodes deployment 
locations against communication-aware deployment criteria, 
into the pre-deployment phase. In addition, a pre-deployment 
simulation framework has been introduced and in its context 
a RF signal propagation-based connectivity algorithm 
(RFCA) has been developed to fulfill three deployment 
provisions: discovering the most appropriate height and 
distances for the sensor nodes, reducing the transmission 
power and minimizing the interference from non-neighbor 
nodes. 
 RFCA uses the RF signal propagation model to predict 
the received signal strength (RSS) in order to identify the 
most 
appropriate 
communication-based 
deployment 
parameters, i.e. T-R distance, height from the ground, and 
transmission power. The choice of the RF propagation 
models is crucial for the success of the prediction procedure, 
which is our motivation to study the importance of using 
proper simulation model for a specific environment. Since 
our work is focused on outdoor environment, we 
differentiate three types of outdoor environments: free 
unobstructed space, thick-tree forest and sparse-tree garden. 
In addition, four propagation models are overviewed and 
classified for their applicability to these three environments. 
Furthermore, real outdoor measurements are compared with 
the simulation results to confirm the applicability of an RF 
propagation model to a particular environment.  
Another important factor, which was considered during 
the pre-deployment phase, is the criteria that distinguish the 
radio range for neighbors and non-neighbors. It is common 
belief that the communication between two sensor nodes is 
good until certain distance and gets worsen after it. To 
investigate how reasonable this statement is, we performed a 
set of measurements. From the results we concluded that a 
packet sent by a transmitter can be received by a receiver 
with certain confidence, only if the intensity of the received 
power is above a given threshold. In addition, it was also 
determined that the RSS in closer distance is not always 
stronger. For instance, in Fig. 3(b)   the RSS at 32m is -
82dBm, but at 40m is -70dBm. Thus, the threshold was 
empirically investigated as relation between the intensity of 
the received power and the packet loss. As a conclusion, the 
criteria for neighbor node distance should not be the distance 
as maximum value, but the distance where the RSS is high 
enough to guarantee min allowed percentage of packet loss 
and for non-neighbors - the distance where the RSS is low 
enough to maximize the probability for packet loss. 
Finally, a deployment case study illustrated the RFCA 
functionality in deriving the optimal deployment parameters, 
consisting of height, distance, and Tx power, for reliable 
communication. RFCA is generic enough to be combined 
with any topology optimization algorithm such as min 
number of nodes deployment, maximum battery life 
deployment, power-aware deployment, etc. 
Analysis of the results presented in this work has shown 
that a communication-aware pre-deployment simulation for 
preliminary planning of the deployment can significantly 
reduce the link quality problems due to the physical layer 
communication loss.
