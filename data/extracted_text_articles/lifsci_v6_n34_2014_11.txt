Abstract— Medical images are an important part of the 
diagnostic process. In many cases the accuracy of diagnosis 
depends on the quality of the image. The 
investigation 
and 
development of new medical image processing methods and 
systems has received great attention over the last two decades. 
This is due to its wide range of applications in computer-
assisted methods and computer-aided methods. The proposed 
paper presents a new image enhancement method for X-ray 
images. The method uses an HDR-image creation as a 
technique to increase the image dynamic range. This allows 
after mapping an HDR-image to an LDR-image (low dynamic 
range image) to get a better distribution of the intensity over 
all pixels in the image.  The result is enhancing brightness, 
contrast and/or sharpness of images without the appearance of 
visible medical artefacts. 
Keywords - X-ray medical imaging; HDR-images; image 
quality enhancement. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Medical imaging is the process of creating images (visual 
representations) of the human body organs and tissues for 
medical purposes to diagnose and treat disease - it is 
intended to reveal internal human body structures hidden by 
the skin and bones. The process is defined as non-invasive as 
it does not disturb the physical integrity of the skin and 
tissues. 
The main method of medical images interpretation is the 
visual one, makes the process depend on the observer [1]. It 
has been found that some doctors have systematic 
underestimation or overestimation of the information in the 
image - they reject some information as insignificant or 
overestimate the importance of structures in the image. 
Additional influence on the final image is exerted by overall 
readability of the image because the conclusions "no 
changes" or "no noticeable changes" are not the same thing. 
Some other factors for the proper medical image 
interpretation are time for investigation, environment, image 
lighting, 
type 
of 
media 
of 
the 
image, 
and 
the 
physiological/functional status of the physician [2][3]. All 
this leads to the need to improve the readability of images 
and to reduce the factors influencing the perception of 
information in images. 
The techniques for obtaining medical images are not 
harmless to patients: different amounts of radiation are 
absorbed by the various body tissues (bones, muscles, soft 
tissues, etc.), leading to resulting physical and chemical 
reactions, as well as to a variety of physiological changes in 
the human body.   Clinical practice mainly uses two types of 
X-ray images: the standard radiological images obtained by 
projection, and fluoroscopic images representing X-ray 
images in real time, used as an aid in medical procedures. 
Notwithstanding the advantages of CT and PET imaging, 
these two radiographic techniques are widespread due to 
their low price, relatively high quality and relatively low 
doses of patient radiation. 
To obtain better quality X-ray images with greater 
contrast and clearer details it is necessary to increase the 
amount of radiation that a patient is subject to. To avoid this 
harmful effect on humans, a variety of technologies have 
been developed by using additional grids to the X-ray 
detectors for absorbing the scattered radiation and reduction 
of the size of the X-ray beam. Another approach, which is 
widely used, is the use of methods for computer-assisted 
diagnosis, to improve the quality of medical images without 
increasing the radiation load on the patient. 
Radiographic studies are one of the most commonly used 
techniques of the diagnostic process in pulmology (the 
X-rays and CT scans are the most frequently used image 
acquisition techniques). For the proper interpretation of X-
ray images the quality of the image has the greatest 
importance. While the image quality of modern digital X-ray 
apparatus is good, with conventional X-ray apparatus in 
many cases the quality is unsatisfactory. This is one of the 
main sources for the wrong interpretation of the image, 
resulting in hypo- or hyper- diagnosis. An example of a 
disease that may be "masked" is the peripheral lung 
carcinoma. In the initial stages of this carcinoma the X-ray 
density is usually not big and when the X-ray image is 
overexposed it may not be visible. Detection of this 
carcinoma in this early stage is very important because it 
rarely manifests any symptoms at this stage, but in an 
advanced stage radical treatment is impossible. So the X-ray 
image reading is the only way for early diagnosis. 
Other examples of lung diseases that require high quality 
images are secondary tuberculosis (especially in the case of 
circular 
fireplace), 
viral 
pneumonia 
and 
pulmonary 
embolism. 
This paper presents a new image enhancement method 
for X-ray images. The method uses HDR-image creation as a

technique to increase the image dynamic range. This allows 
after mapping HDR-image to LDR-image (low dynamic 
range image) to get a better distribution of the intensity over 
all pixels in the image.  The result is enhancing brightness, 
contrast and/or sharpness of images without the appearance 
of visible medical artefacts.

looks into the set of methods for HRD imaging; Section III 
presents the proposed new enhancement method; Section IV 
presents the implementation and analyses of the presented 
method; Section IV presents the conclusion.

WHY MEDICAL IMAGE ENHANCEMENT METHODS ? 
The investigation and development of new medical 
image processing methods and systems has received great 
attention over the last two decades. This is due to its wide 
range of applications in computer-assisted methods and 
computer-aided methods.  
Regardless of the quality of X-rays, there are many 
reasons that necessitate the creation of new methods and 
techniques for improving quality and readability of digital 
images used for medical diagnosis. Our research showed that 
the most frequent by encountered reasons for using methods 
and techniques for medical images post-processing can be 
grouped in the following way:   
 
The image isn’t captured with the optimal X-ray 
apparatus settings. The most important for the X-ray 
picture quality is the choice of exposure, because it 
can get overexposed or underexposed images (for 
digital the X-ray apparatus the selected type of 
linearization of X-ray sensor affects also the choice 
of exposure values). Often the resulting image is 
acceptable, but the contrast is not the best for a 
correct interpretation of the image (Fig. 1a). This has 
a significant impact on reading images containing 
small size structures or in need of early diagnosis of 
diseases, where the change in X-ray density of the 
abnormality is less pronounced, i.e. the change in 
gray tones for an examined area is still small and 
hardly noticeable. 
 
The characteristics of the display or output media do 
not allow you to see all the special features of the 
examined image. This most often occurs when the 
image has a greater depth than the possibilities for 
visualisation. Since, in this case, the computer 
system performs compression of the image depth; 
the result is loss of contrast and dynamic range. A 
very common manifestation of this problem is 
recording the medical image in a format different 
from the DICOM one (Fig. 1c). Most often this is 
used to reduce the volume of archieved images (the 
digital patient archive), or if necessary to make a 
copy for the patient. 
 
It is physicians who diagnose using X-ray picrutres. 
It has been established that the physician’s 
functional, physiological and mental status has direct 
impact on the ability to correctly read the X-rays 
[2][3][4]. In this case, the image post-processing 
allows altering the digital image characteristics so 
that they become readable for the physician. 
 
Figure 1.  Examples of the  necessity to use a post-processing of the 
images before they are used for diagnostic: a) image after capturing by 
incorrect apparatus settings; b) improvement of quality of image (1.a) 
with our method; c) image from digital X-ray apparatus, recorded in a 
file with 8 bits depth (JPG without compression); d) improvement of 
quality of image (1.c) with our method. 
Among the many types of image processing tools, image 
enhancement is one of the vital processes in medical imaging 
systems – it is one of the preparatory steps and it is applied 
before starting the image analyses. Image enhancement 
refers to any technique that improves or modifies digital 
images, so the resulting image is better suited than the 
original for a particular application. Essential image 
enhancement includes but is not limited to intensity and 
contrast manipulation, noise reduction, background removal, 
sharpening and filtering edges. In this context, 'image 
enhancement' means any method or technique which change 
digital images, so the resulting image is better suited than the 
original to a particular application. Due to this the basic 
types of image enhancement include manipulation of 
intensity, changing the local or global contrast, noise 
reduction, filtering and sharpening edges. During the image 
enhancement process one or more attributes of the image are 
modified. The choice of attributes and the way they are 
modified is specific to a given task. Moreover observer-
specific factors such as the human visual system and the 
observer's experience will introduce a great deal of 
subjectivity into the choice of image enhancement methods 
[1]. 
X-ray images are grayscale images with 12-14 bits depth 
and their visual perception depends on the three most 
common image characteristics: brightness, contrast (local 
and global) and sharpness. Apart from these saturation and 
image dynamic range have a significant influence on the 
human perception of the images but they are not directly

relevant to X-ray images, because images are grayscale (no 
saturation), and the dynamic range of the visualization 
systems (computer displays) is less than human vision 
dynamic range. Therefore, all quality enhancement methods 
change the intensity of pixels so as to provide optimal 
brightness, contrast and sharpness values. While brightness, 
contrast and sharpness may appear to be the simplest of 
image controls on the surface and may appear to be mutually 
exclusive controls, they are related and intertwined in such a 
way that changing any one of them can create quite complex 
effects in post-processed images. This specifies a wide 
variety of methods that have been proposed and are being 
created now – each of these methods seeks to solve the task 
of determining the image characteristics optimal values.  
A sample classification of medical image enhancement 
methods is shown in the Fig. 2. [8][9][10][11] 
In the image processing literature there is a wide variety 
of image processing operators, but only а part of them are 
used for the processing of medical images. The main reason 
is the need for preservation of the medical authenticity of the 
image after applying the selected operator. Our analyses 
show that medical systems most often use the following 
functional groups of operators. 
 
Arithmetic and Logic operators: these are different 
forms of unification/fusion of the pixels of the two 
images to obtain the resultant pixel. 
 
LUT operators (Look-up-table operators): these 
operators change pixels’ grayscale levels by 
functional 
transformation on a 
single 
pixel.

Geometric operators: the most common purpose of 
these operators is to remove the geometric 
distortions and shifting of the image, due to the 
image acquisition. Operators for image translation, 
rotation, and scaling are among those most often 
used. 
 
Image analysis operators. 
 
Morphologic operators: these are operators for 
analyzing 
pixels 
groups 
using 
mathematical 
morphology. 
 
Digital filters 
 
Attribute operators: these are operators for detection 
of basic properties or characteristics; this group 
includes operators, which are used to detect edges, 
lines or other specific structures. 
 
Image transformation operators: they are used to 
transform the image into another presentation in 
order to more easily process it for certain needs. 
 
Synthesis operators: most often these are noise 
generation methods. 
Fig. 3 shows a more extended classification of the most 
commonly used operators for image processing in medical 
imaging systems. 
III. 
X-RAYS IMAGE ACQUISITION AND QUALITY 
CHARACTERISTICS 
During the X-ray image creation process the number of 
X-rays which interact with the human body tissues and 
organs depends on the thickness and distribution of the 
anatomical structures in the body. The ‘diagnostic’ X-rays 
are primarily those that occur in photoelectric and Compton 
processes:  
 
Photoelectric interactions are the most important 
ones in the formation of images, because of the 
strong dependence of the photoelectric process on 
the location of the absorbent tissue atoms and the 
absence of secondary radiation.  
 
Compton-type interactions occur in soft tissues, 
depending mainly on their density.  During these 
interactions multiple scattered photons occur, which 
leave the patient's body and reach the detector. Their 
direction is not associated with the focal point of the 
X-ray tube, which primarily causea a decrease of the 
image contrast. 
There are three main options for the interaction of 
photons with the human body organs and tissues: 
 
All the X-ray photons pass through the patient and 
reach the detector (the X-ray plate or the digital X-
ray sensor). Such is the case when the X-ray photons 
pass through areas with air in the lungs. In this case 
the result is an image with dark (almost black) areas 
in the lungs. 
 
The X-ray photons are absorbed completely, for 
example in interaction with metal elements. In this 
case the metal objects are displayed in white on the 
X-ray. 
 
The most common case of interaction of radiation 
with human tissues is when the X-ray photons reach 
tissues and there is photons scattering and 
attenuation. So only part of the photons reach the 
detector and this creates areas with different levels of 
gray in the final X-ray image. 
If the X-ray photons will be absorbed or not by the 
patient’s tissues depends on several factors, the most 
important of which are the energy of the X-ray beam and the 
density of the human tissue. Therefore, one of the main tasks 
of the radiologist is the correct selection of the energy of the 
X-ray beam according to the patient tissues, which will be 
explored. This directly affects the X-ray image quality. 
In medical X-rays five basic grey levels (from black to 
white) can be defined. This classification is based on the 
main basic X-ray densities of tissues and organs, as the 
tissues with low density are plotted with darker tones, 
compared to those with greater density: 
 
black – air in the lungs; 
 
dark gray – subcutaneous tissue (fat); 
 
light gray – the heart and blood vessels (soft tissues, 
water, blood, etc.) 
 
near to white – clavicles, ribs and bones; 
 
white - metal items (jewelry, orthopedic items, 
hospital equipment, marker left side). 
The principle of reading the X-rays is based on the fact 
that the structures or organs can be recognized in the image 
only based on the differences in X-ray density of adjancent 
structures, such as light gray areas of the heart to black areas 
of air in lungs. In this way the interpretation of X-ray images 
requirs the areas with normal and pathological coloring in 
gray tones to be defined [12][13][14][15]. 
According to modern concepts the medical image quality 
can be described by three basic physical characteristics: 
contrast, sharpness and noise [16][21][22]. Between these 
characteristics there is a mutual interdependence, the 
improvement of one can lead to the deterioration of another 
[17][19]. Three levels, characterizing the quality of the 
image [1], are used in practice: 
 
Visualization – the object is detected without its 
details being reproduced; 
 
Display - details of anatomical structures are 
outlined, but out necessarily distinct; 
 
Imaging - details of the anatomical structures are 
clearly outlined. 
Contrast is one of the main characteristics of the X-ray 
image, directly affecting the general readability of the image. 
Ray contrast is defined as the relationship between the 
difference of power transmission at two different points, and 
its average (background) value [20]. It depends on the tissues 
attenuation 
coefficients 
and 
the 
tissues 
thickness. 
Radiographic contrast is determined by the resulting visible 
image: it represents the difference between the optical 
densities (or between brightness) in two adjacent areas [21]. 
At the same time, the effect of the scattering of X-rays is 
expressed in almost constant intensity of the background IS, 
imposed on the real image. This results in the decreasing of 
the image contrast which can be expressed by the formula:

where I1 is the intensity of X-rays passed through the soft 
tissue and I2 is the intensity of the X-rays passed through the 
bones.
Тhe type of transition in optical density (or brightness of the 
image) characterizes the sharpness of the X-ray image.

In medical imaging the main reasons for the decrease in 
sharpness are the following: 
 
Loss of geometric sharpness is a consequence of the 
size of the optical focus of the X-ray tube. Apart 
from reduction of its size, it can be limited through 
the use of as little as possible zoom for less distance 
between the object and the detector. 
 
Loss of dynamic sharpness is due to patient 
movement during the X-ray image capturing and can 
be reduced by shorter exposure times. 
 
Loss of contour sharpness is caused by rounded 
shapes of the organs and structures in the patient 
body. 
Total loss of sharpness of the image UTOT  depends on 
several factors and the influence of each of them can be 
expressed by the expression:

where:

UG characterizes the position of the patient relative 
to the X-ray tube and the detector and can be 
determined by the formula (FPsize is the size of the 
focal point; Dobj-sensor is the  distance between the 
object and the detector; and Dfocus-obj is the  distance 
between the focus point and the object)

 
UM expresses the effect of the patient shift during 
image capturing. 
 
UD is called a detector blur and characterizes the 
effect of the detector type; 
 
UI is the so-called ‘inherent blur’, which is 
determined by the shape of the captured object. 
In this way, the total loss of sharpness characterizes the 
change in the size of the smallest visible detail in the image. 
The X-ray image noise appears as random variations in 
the signal of the converter in a homogeneous structure of 
objects in digital radiographic systems. There are several 
noise sources and the main source of noise is quantum noise 
– it is the result of statistical fluctuations in the number of X-
rays reaching the detector [19]. 
For grayscale images, as most medical images are, the 
image histogram can be used as an initial characteristic of 
image quality – it may show the areas that need digital 
enhancement. It is particularly important to take into account 
the fact that grayscale levels and pixels values are not the 
same thing, because the change of the image can be done by 
changing the grayscale levels, without changing the pixels 
values [18]. This is realized through the change of the Look 
up Table (LUT). 
Another important characteristic and criterion for the 
image quality evaluation is the dynamic range – it describes 
the difference between the maximum (amax) and minimum 
(amin) value for a pixel in the image: 
D = 20 * log10 (amax - amin) 
 
The correlation between the dynamic range and the 
contrast of the image has been a long-known fact. For the 
grayscale medical images this relationship is even more 
pronounced, but that does not mean that contrast and 
dynamic range are synonymous – contrast depends not only 
on the dynamic range, but also on the average distribution of 
the values of the pixels in the image, as well as on the 
number of peaks in the image histogram. 
Theoretically, for medical X-ray image capturing the 
dynamic range of the detector should be similar to the range 
of the emitter. In cases in which the emitter has a greater 
dynamic range than the detector, a cut of received values 
outside the dynamic range of the detector is obtained – it can 
easily be seen in the histogram of the image (the histogram 
has peaks in the black part and/or in the white part). In 
practice the reverse also occurs: the dynamic range of the 
detector is sagnificantly larger than the dynamic range of the 
transmitter – in this case, the values are grouped in a limited 
part of the histogram, and in the black and/or in the white 
part of the histogram there are no values. 
IV. 
THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS WITH THE X-RAY 
IMAGE QUALITY 
Digital X-ray images can be obtained in two ways – after 
digitization of X-ray plates/films, or from digital X-ray 
apparatus.  These are two completely different sources of 
images, so there are different reasons for change in the 
quality: 
 
With digital X-rays the main problem is related to 
the image format in a long-term registers – the 
DICOM format is very unconvinient for those 
purposes due to the large volume of images. Our 
studies showed that a hospital with 50 000 patients 
needs 5-8 GBytes per year new external space only 
for storage of digital X-rays. So increasingly, 
hospitals after a certain period transfer images from 
external memory on new generation X-ray plates or 
films. 
 
Тhe main problems of quality of X-rays captured by 
the classical X-ray apparatus are related to the 
calibration of the X-ray apparatus and with changes 
in X-ray plate during a prolonged storage. The 
digitalization process can also lead to changes in the 
quality of the final digital X-rays, but these kinds of 
problems of are not part of the discussion in this 
article. 
The two most common problems resulting from the of X-
ray apparatus calibration (other than the noise) are obtaining 
overexposed or underexposed X-rays. This leads to a change 
in the image dynamic range and/or the image contrast, as 
well as to the possibility to improve X-image quality by  
post-processing techniques: 
 
Underexposed X-rays - these are very bright images 
and the main problem is related to the lack of 
sufficient visual information in the image. Such 
images have small dynamic range and a unimodal 
histogram with a clearly expressed peak in the white 
end of the histogram (Fig. 4). Additionally, the 
histogram may have several distinct local peaks 
(usually one or two). In this case, the classical 
methods for histogram manipulation do not create 
200

medical trustworthy images, because a post-
processed image has characteristics of pronounced 
pathologies. 
 
Overexposed X-rays – these images are too dark 
areas, due to the large amount of radiation passed 
through the patient. They have a bimodal histogram 
with peaks near the white and black ends, i.e. they 
have a good dynamic range (Fig. 5). This is the 
result of overexposure in the soft tissues (the tones 
close to the black) and the regions with higher 
radiographic density (e.g., thicker bone) that have 
colors near to white. This pronounced bimodal 
histogram with large and very distant peaks greatly 
decreases the applicability of classical methods for 
image contrast improvement. 
Problems, which are the result of improper storage of 
X-ray plates, are due to the change of the physical and/or 
photo-optical characteristics of the plates. These changes 
have led to a change in the quality of the recorded image: 
 
The whitening of the X-ray image – this leads to loss 
of the image dynamic range (Fig. 6).  
 
Figure 4.  Examples of underexposed X-rays and their histograms. 
 
Figure 5.  Examples of overexposed X-rays and their histograms. 
 
The X-rays cease to be grayscale images and turn 
into colored images (Fig. 7). 
 
The appearance of characteristic and clearly distinct 
linear or point changes in the X-ray plate surface. 
In terms of quality enhancement methods the X-rays 
whitening is the most interesting problem. The reason for its 
occurrence is exposing plates to constant external light (e.g., 
sunlight).  This leads to change of photo-optical 
characteristics of the plate, i.e. light levels in adjacent dark 
and light areas converge. The result is a reduction of the 
image dynamic range and/or decreasing of the image 
contrast. In this case the histogram change resembles the 
change, which is the result of gamma-correction. 
The coloring of the X-ray plates is also a significant 
problem, because quality enhancement methods of digital X-
ray images are developed for grayscale images. The problem 
is very interesting, but its discussion is out of the scope of 
this article. 
V. 
HDR IMAGING 
High Dynamic Range Imaging is a set of methods in 
photography/imaging, supposed to capture/create a greater 
dynamic range between the darkest and lightest image areas 
than current standard digital imaging methods [5][6]. Тhe 
information in the HDR-image file isn‘t based on based on 
the chosen color model – the stored values are 
logarithmically encoded or floating-point linear values, or 
gamma compressed values of luminance [5].

whitening+coloring.

At the same time the HDR-images don’t use fixed 
presentation of individual color channels – to represent the 
increased amount of colors they use floatin-point values (the 
LDR-images use integer values to represent the color

channels of selected color model). That is why HDR-images 
provide much more correctly the luminance levels in the 
captured scene compared to classic images with low 
dynamic range (LDR-images).  
The human eye covers the dynamic range of about 105:1 
at one time and this is bigger than the top dynamic range of 
most real-world scenes. For comparison, computer displays 
have dynamic range of 103:1 and digital cameras have 
dynamic range of 104:1. In the last two years HDR cameras 
with dynamic range just over normal human vision dynamic 
range and displays with near to human vision dynamic range 
began to appear on the market. 
The human vision can be accommodated to a dynamic 
range of 1014:1 but the iris is simply not as flexible and the 
human perception of intensity changes is logarithmic (the 
Weber law). This is much more than the capabilities of 
modern devices for image creation and visualization. 
Therefore, a non-HDR image device takes pictures at one 
exposure level with a limited contrast range. This leads to the 
loss of details in dark or bright image areas, depending on 
the camera exposure setting. HDR methods compensate 
detail loss by taking multiple pictures at different exposure 
levels and stitching them together to create an image which 
presents the greatest number of details in both dark and 
bright areas. Data stored in HDR-images typically 
corresponds to the physical values of luminance/radiance 
that can be observed in the real world and this presents a 
great difference from classical digital images: classical 
digital images represent intensities and colours that should 
appear on an output device (display, printer, plotter, etc.). 
Therefore, HDR image formats are called scene-referred 
while classical digital images are called device-referred.  
In photography dynamic range is measured in EV 
(Exposure Values) differences between the darkest and 
brightest parts of the image that show detail: an increase of 
1 EV is a doubling of the amount of light.  Using EVs not 
very strict categories of images are [7]: 
 
High Dynamic Range (HDR) images: These have a 
dynamic range of about 14EV and these images 
(they use 32-bit float values without limitation for 
channels bits depth) are usually produced by 
merging multiple 12-14 bits images of different 
exposures (most often these are raw data files). 
 
Medium Dynamic Range (MDR) images: These 
have a dynamic range of [9 EV, 12 EV] and can 
originate from a file with 16-bit depth, or by merging 
3 or more 8-bits images with different exposures. 
 
Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images: These have a 
dynamic range of lover than 8 EV. This means one 
8-bits image. 
Historically, the first versions of obtaining images with 
greater dynamic range began in the 19th century when films 
having several layers with different sensitivities were 
developed. By analogy, the computer-based generation of 
HDR-images require several images captured at different 
exposure, and then these LDR-images are merged. So each 
separate exposure captures various illuminations in the 
natural scene, i.e.  each LDR-image stores information for a 
different part of the real dynamic range of the scene. 
Therefore, the information about the luminance from the 
individual parts of the scene dynamic range can be merged to 
generate the final HDR image [23].  The main problem in 
this case is the correct selection of the number of LDR-
images and the choice of exposure values suitable to the 
characteristics of the scene. 
VI. 
OUR METHOD FOR CHEST X-RAY IMAGE QUALITY 
ENHANCEMENT 
X-ray images are 12-14 bit grayscale images and their 
visual perception depends on the three most common image 
characteristics: brightness, contrast (local and global) and 
sharpness. Thus, when the image has no sufficient quality, 
this is the result of some incorrect values. As stored 
information in the grayscale images is the values for 
intensity of the image pixels, then all methods for quality 
enhancement are aimed at changing the pixel intensity as a 
way to change the basics characteristics of the image. This 
limits the opportunities for selection of optimal values, 
because a limited amount of information about the 
luminosity/radiance power stored as pixel intensity is used.  
The most common feature of the existing medical image 
quality enhancement methods is the fact that they cannot 
substantially increase the dynamic range of the image, 
which is why the improvement of the characteristics of the 
image (contrast, sharpness, brightness) is achieved through 
redistribution of the values of the intensity of the pixels in 
the image. Therefore, these methods improve the basic 
image characteristics (contrast, sharpness, brightness) by 
redistribution of intensity values to the pixels in the image. 
The main problem of this approach is the possibility of 
occurrence of medical artifacts – the classical criteria for 
evaluation of contrast enhancement (eg, increasing the 
dynamic 
range 
and 
maximizing 
the 
contrast) 
are 
inapplicable, since the resulting grayscale levels of pixels 
can be an indicator of pathological changes in tissues and 
organs (Fig. 8). Since there is no established computer 
metrics for medical authenticity, it cannot rely on automated 
techniques for evaluation of image quality of post-processed 
medical images. It is necessary to seek new approaches to 
solve this task which enable a qualified physicion to control 
the image quality enhancement process manually.

is the preservation of the authenticity of the image: a) the generic image;

contrast; c) the most improved image without the occurrence of medical 
artifacts.

Our method uses a different approach to solve the issue 
of the optimal intensity distribution over image pixels.  
Following this approach a model of the luminosity 
distribution is created instead, which has led to the current 
image. This is achieved by creating a HDR-image because it 
represents the description of the luminosity/radiance in the 
nature scene. After a HDR-image is created the method 
allows determining the optimal mapping from a HDR-image 
to a LDR-image. 
The use of the HDR-image to describe the scene 
luminosity model is justified, because the photosensitive 
material of the X-ray films and the X-ray-plates doesn’t 
represent a monolayer structure – it is a multilayer structure. 
Thus, the energy of the photons passing through the material 
determines the level of the change in depth. Therefore, the 
photo-sensor catches different illumination information from 
different levels of photosensitive material under different 
exposure levels. This approach can be used directly for 
digitalization of X-ray plates [24] but if you want to use it as 
an image quality enhancement method you needed to create 
a technique for generating LDR-images with pixels intensity 
values corresponding to the relevant exposure values of the 
scene. This is one of the main tasks of the proposed method. 
The proposed new quality enhancement method of for 
digital X-rays has the following three consecutive stages:   
 
Creating the LDR-images simulating capturing at 
different exposure; 
 
Creating an HDR-image as a luminosity model. 
 
Obtaining the final image by controlling the process 
of transformation from the HDR-image to the LDR-
image. 
A. Stage 1: Simulation capturing at different exposure 
To achieve the correct results, it is necessary to establish 
a correct luminosity model of the simulated scene. For the 
HDR-image this is achieved by correctly selected additional 
images with different exposure. In photography this is 
achieved through capturing a new image with a selected 
exposure. Here this is not applicable and the main problem is 
to obtain an image that is accurate enough to simulate 
changes in the original image after changing the exposure. 
From the image processing point of view increasing or 
decreasing the exposure changes the values of brightness, 
contrast and sharpness. Therefore, if the change of image 
pixels intensity resulting from the exposure change can be 
imitated, it can be used to simulate the image exposure 
change when a HDR-image is created. Our tests and analyses 
of results showed that for simulation a change in intensity a 
few different techniques can be used: using the brightness 
and the contrast control; using the gamma-correction; using 
the brightness and the contrast control followed by a gamma-
correction; using the gamma-correction followed by a 
brightness and contrast correction 
1) Using the brightness and the contrast control 
One approach to solve the problem is based on the 
understanding that exposure change by 1 EV means doubling 
the amount of light. As the visual result is increasing of the 
pixels intensity for the entire image, the imitation of intensity 
shift requires calculation of brightness shift. Unfairness of 
this approach is that doubling the amount of light does not 
lead to doubling pixels intensity, because graphic devices 
and the characteristics of the created images reflect the 
human vision characteristics (logarithmic law for change of 
the intensity sensibility). Therefore, besides brightness there 
is also a considerable change in contrast.  
Tests to determine brightness and contrast values were 
conducted: X-rays are captured with different exposures 
(from -3 EV to +3 EV by a 0.5 EV step) and the difference 
between the real image and the simulated image is evaluated 
to select values for brightness and contrast – Table I shows 
the results obtained for brightness and contrast (values of 
brightness and contrast are between -100 and +100). An 
example of -1.5 EV exposure simulations is shown in Fig. 9.

Our experiments show that simulation of exposures 
above 2.5 EV and below -2.5 EV is unrealistic and cannot be 
used for HDR-like image generation – when mapping to a 
LDR-image the result always contains medical artefacts.

However, for bone X-rays, this approach gives very good 
simulations.  
2) Using the gamma-correction control 
Another way to simulate changing the intensity of pixels 
is by changing the gamma-correction.  
The difference between brightness and gamma-correction 
control is that increasing the value of gamma-correction can 
make the image to look brighter, but it is a non-linear change 
and it only increases brightness of the shadows and mid-
tones in the image without affecting the highlights. Our 
experiments showed that this is particularly useful for 
simulating the overexposed images or the lung X-rays.  
Another significant difference is the ability to simulate 
exposure values in the range [-5 EV, +5 EV]. Fig. 3 shows 
an example from Fig. 10, and Table II shows calculated 
values for gamma-correction.

between images (b) and (c) - the histogram is stretched twice. 
3) Using the brightness and the contrast control 
followed by gamma-correction 
The main disadvantage of using brightness and contrast 
control is the incorrect change of local contrast between lung 
structures and ribs. That is why we tested additional image 
correction – the gamma correction. The result is a significant 
improvement of the simulation - Fig. 11 shows the example 
from Fig. 9, but now with the new way of correction. Table 
III shows calculated values for simulation of an exposure 
change. 
4) Using the gamma-correction control followed by 
brightness and the contrast correction 
The last approach to create an exposure simulation is 
gamma-correction control followed by brightness and 
contrast correction. This approach differs from the previous 
one, because the operations are not commutative. When 
comparing the result with the second approach, it appears 
that in this case the lighter areas are correctly changed.

b) the image with +1.5 EV; c) the simulated image with -1.5 EV; d) the

shows calculated values for simulation of an exposure 
change. 
Another advantage of the third approach is the possibility 
to simulate a much larger range of exposure values. 
B. Stage 2: The HDR-image generation 
To implement this step of the method, it is necessary to 
use a product for HDR-image generation based on a set of 
LDR-images with known exposure values. Analysis of the 
reqirements for digital X-ray images was conducted. The 
possibilities for creating an image with different exposures 
have been determined.

Using the above analysis and the deretmined possibilities 
the following criteria for usability of the existing sowtwate 
sysytems for HDR-generation have been defined: 
 
Criterion 1: The level of realism of the resulting 
images after mapping an HDR-image to an LDR-
image – this is the main criterion for the product 
selection because it is characterized by the 
appearance of artifacts in the final image, which is 
unacceptable for medical diagnosis. The evaluation 
of products by this criterion was done by a 
pulmonary diseases specialist. 
 
Criterion 2: The available set of input file formats – 
mainlywe  evaluate the ability to work with 16-bits 
or 32- bits formats for input LDR images (8-bits 
images strongly restrict the possibility of achieving a 
large dynamic range) 
 
Criterion 3: Feasibility of alignment control by 
geometrical criteria or by image objects features - in 
the theory of HDR-images for calculation of the 
scene dynamic range, it is necessary to specify the 
matching objects in images with different exposures, 
because changes in their illumination is used for 
determination of illumination of the real scene, i.e. to 
calculate the real dynamic range of the scene. As for 
the proposed method the scene is static, the change 
of exposure greatly changes the forms and structures 
of the objects, but not their location relative to the 
boundary of the image. That is why the use of 
geometric criteria (available to pivot) gives much 
better quality results and there are much less artifacts 
in the final image. In real scenes (shooting nature) 
this is very rare and therefore most products use 
object alignment only. 
 
Criterion 4: the ability to edit the HDR-image – This 
is very significant, because the generation of an 
HDR-image can lead to the occurrence of noise or 
chromatic aberration in the ldr-image. At the same 
time, the ability to edit the scene luminance model 
allows generation of an LDR-image with much 
higher quality. 
 
Criterion 5: Ability to manually control the process 
of mapping an HDR-image to an LDR-image – the 
process of selecting the optimum dynamic range of 
an LDR-image directly affects the quality of the final 
image, because changing the contrast, the brightness, 
and the dynamic range affect the distribution of 
intensities levels over tissues 
with different 
radiographic densities. 
 
Criterion 6: Ability to generate a 16 bits output ldr-
image - this is a mandatory requirement for X-ray 
images ( digital X-rays are 12- or 14-bits images). 
The results of the survey on the individual criteria are 
shown in Table V – the marks are between 1 star (the lowest) 
and 5 stars (the highest). 
  Based on these analyses, the Photomatix Pro system 
was selected, since it best meets the needs of the proposed 
method – a medically inauthentic image was not generated in 
any of the tests. 
C. Stage 3: The mapping of HDR-image to LDR-image  
When setting the tasks for this method stage, analogy 
with methods for image pre-processing in digital X-ray 
apparatus has been used – medical X-rays apparatus have a 
group of methods for the digital sensor calibration and

linearization (the goal is the best possible distribution of 
intensities levels over captured image). Since in the 
developed method the HDR-image acts as a digital sensor, 
the task at this stage is to use a mapping procedure between 
the HDR-image and the LDR-image to select optimal LDR-
image characteristics (dynamic range, contrast, ryaskost, 
noise, brightness, etc.) without generating medical artifacts.

The tests and the analysis of the results showed that the 
chosen approach allows physicians to make the following 
kinds of image quality improvements: 
 
Control of the global characteristics of the final 
LDR-image as a dynamic range, global contrast, 
global sharpness, and global brightness. 
 
Control of the level of details for the LDR-image - 
for medical images the size of the structures that will 
be visible in the final image is of gtear importance. 
 
Local contrast of small structures and details – in 
medical imaging, it is important to increase the 
image readability. 
 
Adjustment of the simulated light conditions - in 
digital X-ray machines the final image has 
illumination 
that 
simulates 
the 
standard 
for 
background lighting on X-ray plates. This type of 
control in our method provides the same opportunity 
because the medical information perception in the X-
rays is reduced without the background lighting. 
 
Halo-effect adjustment – this effect occurs around 
concentrated structures with low permeability when 
strong lighting is applied (the central part becomes 
darker, and the periphery becomes lighter). Very 
strong halo-effect may cause medical artifacts, but 
full suppression can lead to unrealistic contrast 
between structures. 
 
Extreme areas managing - these are image areas that 
should not be involved in determining the mapping 
between an HDR-image and an LDR-image (these 
areas aren’t parts of the human body). This affects 
the quality of the contrast adjustment between 
organs and tissues with different radiographic 
density. 
 
Noise adjustment –all X-ray images have low-
frequency noise, because the sensor elements are not 
fully homogeneous. Since this noise is part of the 
feel of background lighting, the complete removal of 
its alleged influence does not always give reliable 
results (the low-pass filter removes not only the 
results of the noise, but also the effects of different 
radiographic density of human organs and tissues).  
At the same time the low-pass filter creates a sense 
of non-uniformity in the backlight, which further 
reduces the readability of the image. 
Fig. 13 shows the changes in the standard image when 
some discussed techniques are used. According to medical 
consultants results obtained by using the Oleono HDREngine 
and the Photomatix Pro have the highest medical reliability.

VII. METHOD IMPLEMENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF 
RESULTS 
Using this method for enhancing X-ray quality gives a 
significant 
change 
even 
in 
the 
exposure 
values 
[0 EV, -0.5 EV, +0.5 EV] but in general this is not the best 
combination of values.  The correct implementation of the 
proposed method and the maximum use of its capabilities 
needs answers to three main questions:  
 
How many LDR-images with different exposure 
values should be used? 
 
Symmetrical or asymmetrical exposure values 
should be used? 
 
What should be the maximum and the minimum 
value of the simulated exposure, so that there is a 
significant image quality improvement, but without 
medical artifacts? 
The experiments and the analysis of chest X-rays have 
led to the following conclusions: 
 
The difference in the final image when 3 or 5 LDR-
images have been used is irrelevant for the diagnosis 
of lung diseases, since the changes are primarily in 
the field of the trachea and the heart, ie the space 
outside the lung (Fig. 14).  
 
The use of asimetric exposure values for LDR-
images with positive and negative exposure most 
often does not lead to noticeably better results in the 
area of the lung (Fig. 15). 
 
Figure 14.  Comparing the results using 3 or 5 LDR-images - images show 
the subtraction of both final images and the image histograms are stretched 
10 times to show the differences: a) the different exposures are simulated 
by gamma-correction; b) the different exposures are simulated by 
brightness and contrast adjustment. 
 
Figure 15.  Comparing the results using asymmetrical exposure values  - the 
image shows the difference of the final images of two exposure values sets 
(the image histograms are stretched 10 times to be able to show the 
differences): a) the differens between [0 EV,-1.5 EV,+1.5 EV] and 
[0 EV,  -1.5 EV,+1 EV]; b) the differens between [0 EV,-1.5 EV,+1.5 EV] 
and [0 EV,-1 EV,+1.5 EV]. 
 
Figure 16.  Comparing the results using asymmetrical exposure values  - the 
image shows the difference of final images of two exposure values sets (the 
image histograms are stretched 10 times to be able to show the 
differences): a) the differens between [0 EV,-1.5 EV,+1.5 EV] and 
[0 EV,  -2 EV,+2 EV]; b) the differens between [0 EV,-1.5 EV,+1.5 EV] 
and [0 EV,  2.5 EV,+2.5 EV]. 
 
The use of exposure values distant more than 1.5 EV 
from the base image doesn’t lead to noticeable 
contrast change, but increases the probability of 
medical artifacts occurrence (Fig. 16). 
So, as a standard set of exposure values, we used [0 EV, -
1.5 EV, +1.5 EV]. This set of exposure values can be used in 
most cases, but for some specific purposes there are other 
parameters: 
 
In case of overexposed images, the best results are 
achieved with a set of 5 images with exposure values 
[0 EV, -1.5 EV, +1.5 EV, -2 EV, +2 EV].  
 
In case of underexposed images, the best results are 
obtained when using the set of exposure values 
[0 EV, -1 EV, - 2.5 EV]. 
 
In case of X-rays of bones, good results are obtained 
with asymmetric values for the minimum and 
maximum exposure – for example [0 EV, -2 EV, 
+1 EV]. This set increases details in lighter areas 
(like bone structures).  
 
In case of lung or soft tissues X-rays, good results 
are obtained with opposite asymmetric values for the 
minimum and maximum exposure – for example 
[0 EV, -1 EV, +2 EV]. This set increases details in 
darker areas.  
 
In case of an image with a small dynamic range, a 
set of 5 images has to be used. This increases the 
details for all structures with different radiographic 
densities. 
Another major advantage of the proposed method is the 
ability to manage the transformation from a HDR-image to 
the final LDR-image. This allows an optimal image quality 
to be obtained without the occurrence of medical artefacts.  
The comparison of the results of the proposed method 
with other techniques showed that this method can help to 
obtain a major improvement in quality without the 
occurrence of medical artefacts. Especially important is the 
opportunity to use the same characteristics in all cases and 
always to get good quality – for example 5 images with 
exposure values [0 EV, -1.5 EV, +1.5 EV, -2 EV, +2 EV].  
A few examples of the method implementation and 
comparison with Laplacian pyramids filter and CLAHE are 
shown in Fig. 17.

VIII. CONCLUSION 
Image quality enhancement is very important because it 
increases readability and understandability of the analysed 
images, their details and structure. When the exploited for 
image generation model is known this increases possibilities 
to correct the image without generation of medical artefacts. 
The presented method for pseudo HRD enhancements of 
medical images enables increasing quality of understanding 
and information gathering.  
The next steps of this research are oriented to X-ray 
images of other body parts like bones, abdominal cavity, and 
other soft tissues as well analyses of images from CT and 
other medical image sources.
