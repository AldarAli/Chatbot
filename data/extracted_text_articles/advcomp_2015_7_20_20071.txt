Abstract— Hybrid Finite Element/Finite Volume (FE/FV) 
methods have been employed to study oceanic circulation in a 
simplified domain consisting of both non-moving and moving 
ice floes. Our hybrid FE/FV flow solver combines the merits of 
both finite element and finite volume methods, and is highly 
sophisticated, robust and is a first of its kind approach extended 
for studying ocean ice dynamics and dispersion.  Sea ice 
dynamics is one of the key components of ocean circulation 
models. The ultimate goal through the present project is to 
develop a highly accurate ice dynamics model that can be used 
to predict ice-edge positions, velocities for offshore operations, 
short term forecast for waterways, and also for long term global 
climatic studies.  Preliminary results show that hybrid FE/FV 
methods can be successfully extended for studying ocean ice 
dynamics, through coupled implementation of automatic mesh 
movement. Movement of an isolated ice floe through the ocean 
and also waves impacting multiple dynamic ice floes are 
successfully simulated while maintaining the mesh integrity.

INTRODUCTION 
Sea ice plays a crucial role in the Arctic region 
impacting navigational shipping routes, military, costal guard 
applications, weather forecasting, and also offshore drilling 
platforms. With release of greenhouse gases into atmosphere 
and associated global warming, the Arctic region has become 
that much more important and accurate studies of Arctic 
Ocean ice dynamics have become highly imperative. Arctic 
region can be classified arbitrarily as central Arctic where 
sea ice is continuous and also into a marginal ice zone (with 
individual ice floes) which is an interfacial region between 
Open ocean and Frozen Central Ocean. Marginal Ice Zone 
(MIZ) is of particular interest due to its proximity to shipping 
routes and also as a threat to offshore drilling structures. 
However, modelling sea ice dynamics in MIZ, where 
individual ice floes are of arbitrary shapes and much more 
mobile and fluid, is a highly complex and challenging task. 
MIZ region has received significant attention over the 
past few decades and literature in this area is thoroughly 
discussed in recent reviews by Squire et al. [1][2]. Within the 
MIZ region, researchers focussed on either continuum ice 
models, where MIZ is assumed to have certain rheological 
properties a priori (like a granular material), or on accurately 
modelling individual ice floes [2]. Within the second group, 
most of the studies are still limited to theoretical works, 
numerical models, and recently to spectral methods and 
Laplace transforms [3][4]. Direct numerical simulation 
studies in the MIZ region are relatively scarce due to the 
huge challenges involved in simulating individual ice floes 
requiring mesh movement, simulating complex wave-floe, 
floe-floe interactions and also due to the computing power 
required in realistic simulations of large regions of MIZ. The 
present work is the first of its kind to the author’s knowledge 
in simulating sea ice dynamics using hybrid finite 
element/volume (FE/FV) methods. Due to the highly 
challenging nature of the problem, the present study is being 
conducted in a systematic way by employing the hybrid 
FE/FV methodology to ocean ice dynamics with varying 
degrees of complexity. As a first step, in this work, circular 
waves impacting both non-moving and moving ice-floes in 
simplistic oceanic conditions are simulated. Presently, only 
translation motion is implemented. Section II details the 
governing equations. Numerical methods that are used to 
solve the governing equations are discussed in Section III. 
Results are presented in Section IV and Section V highlights 
the conclusions and future work.

GOVERNING EQUATIONS 
A. Shallow Water Equations 
The Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) [5] are derived 
by depth-averaging the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes 
equations for a column of fluid with mass and momentum 
conservation. In SWEs, it is assumed that vertical motions 
are negligible and that pressure is hydrostatic. The depth 
and velocity of fluid moving in the domain ( , )

Here, we expanded the viscous term from conservation form 
to non-conservation form. In our hybrid method we store the 
variable H  at the node and the velocity u  at the element 
center. Using linear interpolation function will result in 
constant gradient and zero Laplacian for working 
variable H . As a result, we can drop the last term in (3). 
Also, while our solver includes the capabilities for studying 
wind stress, tide, and Coriolis forces [5] they have been 
omitted in the present study and also from above equations.

Here, we introduced u  which is the final velocity at time

 in the iterative nonlinear scheme. In this context, u  
will be intermediate velocity field during the nonlinear 
iteration and the balance between u  and u  will be 
enforced through the gradient of H . This process is similar 
to the projection methods commonly used to solve 
incompressible Navier Stokes equations [7][8][9][10]. Note 
that as

use the fractional time splitting method to first compute an

We can observe that Equation (3) used in the predictor 
phase is time discretized momentum equation in its original 
form. Clearly, the predictor phase satisfies consistency 
criteria and conserves the momentum. To derive the 
continuity wave equation, we multiply Eq. (10) by H  and 
then take the divergence to obtain

right hand side of (13) is weighted by time discretized 
continuity equation. Therefore, as

, (13) will yield 
zero residual for continuity equation. Clearly, Eq. (13) 
satisfies consistency criteria and conserves the mass. We use 
the cell-centered finite volume method (FV) to solve the 
momentum equation for the intermediate velocity and the 
node-based Galerkin finite element method (FE) to solve the 
wave equation and also for the elasticity equations. From 
velocity and water depth, forces acting on the individual ice 
floes are calculated which are used to solve the linear 
elasticity equations for mesh displacement using finite 
element method. In our deployment, the velocity unknowns 
are put at the cell centers and water depth variable is put at 
the mesh vertices. This deployment makes it convenient to 
compute the gradients of water depth using local finite 
element basis function, which is required in solving the 
momentum equations. Previous numerical results have 
shown that our hybrid implementation is super convergent 
in terms of the spatial convergence rates [7][8][9]. Unlike 
our previous compressible/incompressible flow solvers, the 
present hybrid FE/FV has not yet been parallelized. For 
realistic simulations of large regions of MIZ however, the 
flow solver will eventually be parallelized in future studies. 
 
IV. 
RESULTS 
To test our hybrid FE/FV methodology, non-moving ice 
floes were first studied, followed by moving ice-floe 
simulations. In the present simplistic study, idealized 
conditions are maintained by ignoring wind, tide, and 
Coriolis forces. Additionally, the ocean bed elevation was 
assumed to be flat (Z = 0).  
A. Non-moving Ice-Floes 
        Wave-ice interactions in a 10 Sq-Km ocean domain 
with simplified initial/boundary conditions are studied 
utilizing our hybrid FE/FV flow solver. At the far open 
ocean boundary, symmetric boundary conditions are applied 
on all four sides. Ice floes are initially assumed to be rigid, 
non-moving, and wave effects are analysed on both uniform 
and also non-uniform randomly placed ice floes. Different 
simplified artificial forcing mechanisms are imposed to study 
wave effects on ice floes. Figure 2 below shows circular 
tsunami type waves impacting rigid, non-uniform, randomly 
placed ice floes, where water height is plotted at different 
non-dimensional times. Present hybrid FE/FV extensions 
combine the merits of both finite element and finite volume 
methods and are particularly suitable for high aspect ratio 
grids around ice floes and also for solving incompressible 
flows. As shown in Figure 2, wave features are well resolved 
bouncing back after impacting the ice floes. Validation and 
benchmark comparisons of our hybrid FE/FV methodology 
for shallow water equations can be found in the work of 
Aliabadi et al. [9].

moving ice floes at different non-dimensional time’s. 
 
B. Moving Ice-Floes (Automatic Mesh Movement) 
Having tested the flow solver on non-moving ice floes, 
automatic mesh movement was implemented in the flow 
solver by solving linear elasticity equations. Figure 3 below 
shows the grid around an isolated circular ice floe moving 
with a given constant velocity. As it can be seen from the 
figure, mesh refinement around the circular floe is well 
maintained as it moves in the ocean domain.

Circular waves impacting multiple circular ice floes are 
shown in Figure 4, where zoomed in portion of the ocean 
domain around the ice floes is shown. It can be seen that the 
waves sway the ice floes back and forth as they pass through.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Hybrid FE/FV methods have been successfully extended 
for studying ocean ice dynamics in idealized conditions. 
Automatic 
mesh 
movement 
was 
also 
successfully 
implemented, with well resolved and captured wave features 
and also grid refinement around the ice floes. Present hybrid 
FE/FV simulations are the first of its kind in direct 
simulation of individual ice floe-wave interactions. Mesh 
moving studies that are presently being conducted are based 
on the movement of a single and also multiple ice floes 
perturbed using different forcing mechanisms. Ongoing and 
potential future work in this highly challenging area is 
described below (not in any particular order). 
 
Moving isolated ice floes with different shapes (circular, 
square, non-uniform) and sizes will be conducted to 
more thoroughly understand the influence of shape/size 
on the ice motion through impinging waves. 
 
While experimental data in large MIZ regions is 
severely limited, select recent works have focussed on 
calculating the drift velocity for individual ice floes 
through laboratory experiments [11][12] and also by 
theoretical studies [13][14][15].  Single floe studies are 
crucial for thoroughly analysing the kinematic response 
of ice floes with characteristic lengths comparable or 
lower than the impact wavelengths. Isolated ice-floe 
impacts with offshore structures are observed to be one 
of the common ice-structure interaction events [11][16]. 
However, literature and guidance on the impact forces, 
based on which off-shore structures can be designed, 
appears to be severely limited.  Results from the present 
study will therefore be compared with available data. Ice 
floe dynamics studies, such as in the present work, can 
play a significant role in estimating the forces from 
single/multi-year ice impacts on offshore platforms. 
 
Multiple ice-floe studies need to account for floe-floe 
interactions requiring constitutive relationships. 
 
Apart from the ocean waves, ice mobility in the MIZ, 
can also be influenced by wind stress, current, pressure 
and tides which will be incorporated in future studies.  
 
Realistic simulation of large regions in the MIZ will 
require tremendous computing power. Therefore, 
parallelizing the hybrid FE/FV shallow water flow 
solver is an important goal for future studies.
