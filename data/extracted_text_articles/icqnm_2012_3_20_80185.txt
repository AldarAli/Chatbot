Abstract—We identify the presence of typically quantum
effects, namely superposition and interference, in what happens
when human concepts are combined, and provide a quantum
model in complex Hilbert space that represents faithfully ex-
perimental data measuring the situation of combining concepts.
Our model shows how ‘interference of concepts’ describes
the effects of underextension and overextension when two
concepts combine to the disjunction of these two concepts.
This result supports our earlier hypothesis that human thought
has a superposed two-layered structure, one layer consisting of
classical logical thought and a superposed layer consisting of
quantum conceptual thought. Possible connections with recent
ﬁndings of a grid-structure for the brain are analyzed, and
consequences on applied disciplines, such as artiﬁcial intelli-
gence and quantum computation, are considered. These results
suggest that quantum models can be successfully employed
to operationally describe the brain functioning, but they do
not presuppose a microscopic quantum explanation of such
functioning.
Keywords-concept theory; quantum cognition; cognitive pro-
cesses; interference; brain structure.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, it has become clear that quantum struc-
tures do not only appear within situations in the micro world,
but that also situations of the macro world exhibit a quantum
behavior [1]–[16]. Mainly, in domains such as cognitive
science (decision theory, concept theory), biology (evolution
theory, ecology, population dynamics) and computer science
(semantic theories, information retrieval, artiﬁcial intelli-
gence), aspects have been identiﬁed where the application
of classical structures is problematic while the application
of quantum structures is promising. The aspects of these
domains where classical theories fail, and quantum struc-
tures are successful, reveal quite systematically four speciﬁc
and very characteristic quantum effects, namely interference,
contextuality, emergence and entanglement. Sometimes it
has been possible to use the full quantum apparatus of linear
operators in complex Hilbert space to model these effects as
they appear in these situations. However, in quite some occa-
sions a mathematical formalism more general than standard
quantum mechanics in complex Hilbert space is needed. We
have introduced in [17] a general modeling scheme for con-
textual emergent entangled interfering entities. In the present
article, we instead focus on the identiﬁcation of quantum
superposition and interference in cognition to describe ‘how’
and ‘why’ interference models the well documented effects
of overextension and underextension when concepts combine
in disjunction [18]. Possible connections with some recent
and interesting research on the structure of the brain and
technological applications to symbolic artiﬁcial intelligence
and computation are also presented.
Interference effects have been studied in great detail and
are very common for quantum entities, the famous ‘double
slit situation’ being an archetypical example of them [19]–
[24]. Also for concepts we have studied some effects related
to the phenomenon of interference in earlier work [9], [17],
[25]–[27]. In the present article, we concentrate on the
situation where two concepts, more speciﬁcally the concepts
Fruits and Vegetables are combined by using the logical
connective ‘or’ into a new concept Fruits or Vegetables.
Such disjunctive combinations of concepts have been studied
intensively by James Hampton [18]. Hampton collected
experimental data from subjects being asked to estimate the
typicality of a collection of exemplars with respect to Fruits
and with respect to Vegetables. Then he asked the subjects
also to estimate the typicality of the same exemplars with
respect to the combination Fruits or Vegetables. By using the
data of these experiments we identify interference between
the concepts Fruits and Vegetables, and describe how this
interference accounts for the effects of underextension and
overextension identiﬁed by Hampton.
In Section II, we consider the set of data collected by
Hampton, and work out a quantum description modeling
these data. In Section III, we illustrate the phenomenon
of interference as it appears in the considered conceptual
combination, and in Section IV, we present an explanation
for the occurrence of this quantum effect by comparing
it with the interference typical of the two-slit experiment.
This modeling suggests the hypothesis in Section V that a
quantum conceptual layer is present in human thought which
is superposed to the usually assumed classical logical layer,
the former being responsible of deviations from classically
expected reasoning in cognition. Finally, we present in
Section VI a suggestion inspired by recent research where a
grid, rather than a neural network, pattern, is identiﬁed in the
structure of the brain [28]. More speciﬁcally, we put forward
the hypothesis, albeit speculative, that the interference we
identity between concepts, and the complex Hilbert space

that we structurally use to model this interference, might
contain elements that have their isomorphic counterparts in
the dynamics of the brain. Aspects of the impact of this
hypothesis on the modeling and formalizing of natural and
artiﬁcial knowledge, as well as the implications on artiﬁcial
intelligence, robotics and quantum computation, are also
investigated.
II. FRUITS INTERFERING WITH VEGETABLES
Let us consider the two concepts Fruits and Vegetables,
and their combination Fruits or Vegetables, and work out
a quantum model for the data collected by J. Hampton for
this situation [18], [25]. The concepts Fruits and Vegetables
are two exemplars of the concept Food. And we consider
a collection of exemplars of Food, more speciﬁcally those
listed in Table 1. Then we consider the following experimen-
tal situation: Subjects are asked to respond to the following
three elements: Question A: ‘Choose one of the exemplars
from the list of Table 1 that you ﬁnd a good example of
Fruits’. Question B: ‘Choose one of the exemplars from the
list of Table 1 that you ﬁnd a good example of Vegetables’.
Question A or B: ‘Choose one of the exemplars from the
list of Table 1 that you ﬁnd a good example of Fruits
or Vegetables’. Then we calculate the relative frequency
µ(A)k, µ(B)k and µ(A or B)k, i.e the number of times
that exemplar k is chosen divided by the total number of
choices made in response to the three questions A, B and
A or B, respectively, and interpret this as an estimate for
the probabilities that exemplar k is chosen for questions A,
B and A or B, respectively. These relative frequencies are
given in Table 1.

For example, for Question A, from 10,000 subjects, 359
chose Almond, hence µ(A)1 = 0.0359, 425 chose Acorn,
hence µ(A)2 = 0.0425, 372 chose Peanut, hence µ(A)3 =
0.0372, . . ., and 127 chose Black Pepper, hence µ(A)24 =
0.0127. Analogously for Question B, from 10,000 subjects,
133 chose Almond, hence µ(B)1 = 0.0133, 108 chose
Acorn, hence µ(B)2 = 0.0108, 220 chose Peanut, hence
µ(B)3 = 0.0220, . . ., and 294 chose Black Pepper, hence
µ(B)24 = 0.0294, and for Question A or B, 269 chose
Almond, hence µ(A or B)1 = 0.0269, 249 chose Acorn,
hence µ(A or B)2 = 0.249, 269 chose Peanut, hence
µ(A or B)3 = 0.269, . . ., and 222 chose Black Pepper,
hence µ(A or B)24 = 0.222.
Let us now explicitly construct a quantum mechanical
model in complex Hilbert space for the pair of concepts Fruit
and Vegetable and their disjunction ‘Fruit or Vegetable’, and
show that quantum interference models the experimental
data gathered in [18]. We represent the measurement of
‘a good example of’ by means of a self-adjoint operator
with spectral decomposition {Mk | k = 1, . . . , 24} where
each Mk is an orthogonal projection of the Hilbert space H
corresponding to item k from the list of items in Table 1.
The concepts Fruits, Vegetables and ‘Fruits or Vegetables’
are represented by unit vectors |A⟩, |B⟩ and
1
√
2(|A⟩ + |B⟩)
of the Hilbert space H, where |A⟩ and |B⟩ are orthgonal, and
1
√
2(|A⟩ + |B⟩) is their normalized superposition. Following
standard quantum rules we have µ(A)k
= ⟨A|Mk|A⟩,
µ(B)k = ⟨B|Mk|B⟩, hence
µ(A or B)k = 1
2⟨A + B|Mk|A + B⟩
= 1
2(µ(A)k + µ(B)k) + ℜ⟨A|Mk|B⟩,
(1)
where ℜ⟨A|Mk|B⟩ is the interference term. Let us introduce
|ek⟩ the unit vector on Mk|A⟩ and |fk⟩ the unit vector on
Mk|B⟩, and put ⟨ek|fk⟩ = ckeiγk. Then we have |A⟩ =
P24
k=1 akeiαk|ek⟩ and |B⟩ = P24

where we put φk = βk −αk +γk. Further we have µ(A)k =

and choose m the index for which |λm| is the biggest of
the |λk|’s. Then we take ck = 1 for k ̸= m. We explain
now the algorithm that we use to choose a plus or minus
sign for λk as deﬁned in (6), with the aim of being able to
determine cm such that (5) is satisﬁed. We start by choosing
a plus sign for λm. Then we choose a minus sign in (6) for
the λk for which |λk| is the second biggest; let us call the
index of this term m2. This means that 0 ≤ λm + λm2. For
the λk for which |λk| is the third biggest – let us call the
index of this term m3 – we choose a minus sign in case
0 ≤ λm +λm2 +λm3, and otherwise we choose a plus sign,
and in this case we have 0 ≤ λm +λm2 +λm3. We continue
this way of choosing, always considering the next biggest
|λk|, and hence arrive at a global choice of signs for all of
the λk, such that 0 ≤ λm + P
k̸=m λk. Then we determine
cm such that (5) is satisﬁed, or more speciﬁcally such that
cm =

(7)
We choose the sign for φk as deﬁned in (4) equal to the
sign of λk. The result of the speciﬁc solution that we
have constructed is that we can take Mk(H) to be rays of
dimension 1 for k ̸= m, and Mm(H) to be a plane. This
means that we can make our solution still more explicit.
Indeed, we take H = C25 the canonical 25 dimensional
complex Hilbert space, and make the following choices
|A⟩ = (

(11)
where the plus or minus sign in (11) is chosen following the
algorithm we introduced for choosing the plus and minus
sign for λk in (6). Let us construct this quantum model for
the data given in Table 1. The exemplar which gives rise to
the biggest value of |λk| is Tomato, and hence we choose a
plus sign and get λ19 = 0.0768. The exemplar giving rise
to the second biggest value of λk is Pumpkin, and hence we
choose a minus sign, and get λ20 = −0.0733. Next comes
Yam, and since λ19+λ20−0.0615 < 0, we choose a plus sign
for λ18. Next is Green Pepper, and we look at 0 ≤ λ19 +
λ20+λ18−0.0503, which means that we can choose a minus
sign for λ17. The ﬁfth exemplar in the row is Apple. We have
λ19 + λ20 + λ18 + λ17 − 0.0428 < 0, which means that we
need to choose a plus sign for λ8. Next comes Broccoli and
verifying shows that we can choose a minus sign for λ21. We
determine in an analogous way the signs for the exemplars
Raisin, plus sign, Elderberry, minus sign, Olive, plus sign,
Peanut, minus sign, Chili Pepper, minus sign, Coconut, plus
sign, Watercress, minus sign, Lentils, plus sign, Rice, minus
sign, Almond, plus sign, Acorn, minus sign, Black Pepper,
plus sign, Mustard, minus sign, Wheat, plus sign, Parsley,
minus sign, Root Ginger, plus sign, Garlic, minus sign, and
ﬁnally Mushroom, plus sign. In Table 1 we give the values
of λk calculated following this algorithm, and from (7) it
follows that c19 = 0.7997.
Making use of (8), (9), (10) and (11), and the values of
the angles given in Table 1, we put forward the following
explicit representation of the vectors |A⟩ and |B⟩ in C25
representing concepts Fruits and Vegetables

This proves that we can model the data of [18] by means
of a quantum mechanical model, and such that the values of
µ(A or B)k are determined from the values of µ(A)k and
µ(B)k as a consequence of quantum interference effects.
For each k the value of φk in Table 1 gives the quantum
interference phase of the exemplar number k.
III. GRAPHS OF THE INTERFERENCE PATTERNS
In [25], we worked out a way to ‘chart’ the quantum
interference patterns of the two concepts when combined
into conjunction or disjunction. Since it helps our further
analysis in the present article, we put forward this ‘chart’
for the case of the concepts Fruits and Vegetables and
35

their disjunction ‘Fruits or Vegetables’. More speciﬁcally,
we represent the concepts Fruits, Vegetables and ‘Fruits or
Vegetables’ by complex valued wave functions of two real
variables ψA(x, y), ψB(x, y) and ψAorB(x, y).
Figure 1.
The probabilities µ(A)k of a person choosing the exemplar k
as a ‘good example’ of Fruits are ﬁtted into a two-dimensional quantum
wave function ψA(x, y).
We choose ψA(x, y) and ψB(x, y) such that the real part
for both wave functions is a Gaussian in two dimensions,
which is always possible since we have to ﬁt in only 24
values, namely the values of ψA and ψB for each of the
exemplars of Table 1. The squares of these Gaussians are
graphically represented in Figs. 1 and 2, and the different
exemplars of Table 1 are located in spots such that the
Gaussian distributions |ψA(x, y)|2 and |ψB(x, y)|2 properly
model the probabilities µ(A)k and µ(B)k in Table 1 for each
one of the exemplars. For example, for Fruits represented
in Fig. 1, Apple is located in the center of the Gaussian,
since Apple was most frequently chosen by the test subjects
when asked Question A. Elderberry was the second most
frequently chosen, and hence closest to the top of the
Gaussian in Fig. 1. Then come Raisin, Tomato and Pumpkin,
and so on, with Garlic and Lentils as the least chosen
‘good examples’ of Fruits. For Vegetables, represented in
Fig. 2, Broccoli is located in the center of the Gaussian,
since Broccoli was the exemplar most frequently chosen by
the test subjects when asked Question B. Green Pepper was
the second most frequently chosen, and hence closest to the
top of the Gaussian in Fig. 2. Then come Yam, Lentils and
Pumpkin, and so on, with Coconut and Acorn as the least
chosen ‘good examples’ of Vegetables. Metaphorically, we
could regard the graphical representations of Figs. 1 and 2
as the projections of two light sources each shining through
one of two holes in a plate and spreading out their light
intensity following a Gaussian distribution when projected
on a screen behind the holes. The center of the ﬁrst hole,
corresponding to the Fruits light source, is located where
exemplar Apple is at point (0, 0), indicated by 8 in both
ﬁgures. The center of the second hole, corresponding to the
Vegetables light source, is located where exemplar Broccoli
is at point (10,4), indicated by 21 in both ﬁgures.
Figure 2.
The probabilities µ(B)k of a person choosing the exemplar
k as an example of Vegetables are ﬁtted into a two-dimensional quantum
wave function ψB(x, y).
In Fig. 3, the data for ‘Fruits or Vegetables’ are graph-
ically represented. This is not ‘just’ a normalized sum of
the two Gaussians of Figs. 1 and 2, since it is the probabil-
ity distribution corresponding to
1
√
2(ψA(x, y) + ψB(x, y)),
which is the normalized superposition of the wave functions
in Figs. 1 and 2.

Figure 4.
A three-dimensional representation of the interference landscape
of the concept ‘Fruits or Vegetables’ as shown in Fig. 3.
The interference pattern shown in Fig. 3 is very similar to
well-known interference patterns of light passing through an
elastic material under stress. In our case, it is the interference
pattern corresponding to ‘Fruits or Vegetables’. Bearing in
mind the analogy with the light sources for Figs. 1 and 2,
in Fig. 3 we can see the interference pattern produced when
both holes are open.

averages for Fruits and Vegetables shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
Fig. 4 represents a three-dimensional graph of the interfer-
ence pattern of Fig. 3, and, for the sake of comparison, in
Fig. 5, we have graphically represented the averages of the
probabilities of Figs. 1 and 2, i.e., the values measured if
there were no interference. For the mathematical details – the
exact form of the wave functions and the explicit calculation
of the interference pattern – and for other examples of
conceptual interference, we refer to [25].
IV. EXPLAINING QUANTUM INTERFERENCE
The foregoing section showed how the typicality data of
two concepts and their disjunction are quantum mechani-
cally modeled such that the quantum effect of interference
accounts for the measured values. We also showed that it
is possible to metaphorically picture the situation such that
each of the concepts is represented by light passing through
a hole and the disjunction of both concepts corresponds to
the situation of the light passing through both holes (see Fig.
6).
Figure 6.
A typical interference pattern of a quantum two-slit situation.
This is indeed where interference is best known from
the traditional double-slit situation in optics and quantum
physics. If we apply this to our speciﬁc example by analogy,
we can imagine the cognitive experiment where a subject
chooses the most appropriate answer for one of the concepts,
e.g., Fruits, as follows: ‘The photon passes with the Fruits
hole open and hits a screen behind the hole in the region
where the choice of the person is located’. We can do the
same for the cognitive experiment where the subject chooses
the most appropriate answer for the concept Vegetables.
This time, the photon passes with the Vegetables hole open
and hits the screen in the region where the choice of the
person is located. The third situation, corresponding to the
choice of the most appropriate answer for the disjunction
concept ‘Fruits or Vegetables’, consists in the photon passing
with both the Fruits hole and the Vegetables hole open
and hitting the screen where the choice of the person is
located. This third situation is the situation of interference,
viz. the interference between Fruits and Vegetables. These
three situations are clearly illustrated in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.
In [9], [26], [27], we analyzed the origin of the interfer-
ence effects that are produced when concepts are combined,
and we provided an explanation that we investigated further
in [25].
Let us now take a closer look at the experimental data
and how they are produced by interference. The exemplars
for which the interference is a weakening effect, i.e. where
µ(A or B) < 1/2(µ(A) + µ(B)) or 90◦ ≤ φ or φ ≤ −90◦,
are the following: Elderberry, Mustard, Lentils, Pumpkin,
Tomato, Broccoli, Wheat, Yam, Rice, Raisin, Green Pepper,
Peanut, Acorn and Olive. The exemplars for which inter-
ference is a strengthening effect, i.e. where 1/2(µ(A) +
µ(B)) < µ(A or B) or φ < 90◦ or −90◦ ≤ φ, are
the following: Mushroom, Root Ginger, Garlic, Coconut,
Parsley, Almond, Chili Pepper, Black Pepper, and Apple. Let
us consider the two extreme cases, viz. Elderberry, for which
interference is the most weakening (φ = −113.2431◦),
and Mushroom, for which it is the most strengthening
37

ICQNM 2012 : The Sixth International Conference on Quantum, Nano and Micro Technologies

(φ = 18.6744). For Elderberry, we have µ(A) = 0.1138
and µ(B) = 0.0170, which means that test subjects have
classiﬁed Elderberry very strongly as Fruits (Apple is the
most strongly classiﬁed Fruits, but Elderberry is next and
close to it), and quite weakly as Vegetables. For Mushroom,
we have µ(A) = 0.0140 and µ(B) = 0.0545, which
means that test subjects have weakly classiﬁed Mushroom
as Fruits and moderately as Vegetables. Let us suppose that
1/2(µ(A) + µ(B)) is the value estimated by test subjects
for ‘Fruits or Vegetables’. In that case, the estimates for
Fruits and Vegetables apart would be carried over in a
determined way to the estimate for ‘Fruits or Vegetables’,
just by applying this formula. This is indeed what would be
the case if the decision process taking place in the human
mind worked as if a classical particle passing through the
Fruits hole or through the Vegetables hole hit the mind
and left a spot at the location of one of the exemplars.
More concretely, suppose that we ask subjects ﬁrst to choose
which of the questions they want to answer, Question A or
Question B, and then, after they have made their choice,
we ask them to answer this chosen question. This new
experiment, which we could also indicate as Question A or
Question B, would have 1/2(µ(A)+µ(B)) as outcomes for
the weight with respect to the different exemplars. In such
a situation, it is indeed the mind of each of the subjects that
chooses randomly between the Fruits hole and the Vegeta-
bles hole, subsequently following the chosen hole. There is
no inﬂuence of one hole on the other, so that no interfer-
ence is possible. However, in reality the situation is more
complicated. When a test subject makes an estimate with
respect to ‘Fruits or Vegetables’, a new concept emerges,
namely the concept ‘Fruits or Vegetables’. For example, in
answering the question whether the exemplar Mushroom is
a good example of ‘Fruits or Vegetables’, the subject will
consider two aspects or contributions. The ﬁrst is related
to the estimation of whether Mushroom is a good example
of Fruits and to the estimation of whether Mushroom is
a good example of Vegetables, i.e. to estimates of each
of the concepts separately. It is covered by the formula
1/2(µ(A) + µ(B)). The second contribution concerns the
test subject’s estimate of whether or not Mushroom belongs
to the category of exemplars that cannot readily be classiﬁed
as Fruits or Vegetables. This is the category characterized
by the newly emerged concept ‘Fruits or Vegetables’. And
as we know, Mushroom is a typical case of an exemplar
that is not easy to classify as ‘Fruits or Vegetables’. That
is why Mushroom, although only slightly covered by the
formula 1/2(µ(A) + µ(B)), has an overall high score as
‘Fruits or Vegetables’. The effect of interference allows
adding the extra value to 1/2(µ(A) + µ(B)) resulting from
the fact that Mushroom scores well as an exemplar that is
not readily classiﬁed as ‘Fruits or Vegetables’. This explains
why Mushroom receives a strengthening interference effect,
which adds to the probability of it being chosen as a good
example of ‘Fruits or Vegetables’. Elderberry shows the
contrary. Formula 1/2(µ(A)+µ(B)) produces a score that is
too high compared to the experimentally tested value of the
probability of its being chosen as a good example of ‘Fruits
or Vegetables’. The interference effect corrects this, subtract-
ing a value from 1/2(µ(A)+µ(B)). This corresponds to the
test subjects considering Elderberry ‘not at all’ to belong
to a category of exemplars hard to classify as Fruits or
Vegetables, but rather the contrary. As a consequence, with
respect to the newly emerged concept ‘Fruits or Vegetables’,
the exemplar Elderberry scores very low, and hence the
1/2(µ(A) + µ(B)) needs to be corrected by subtracting
the second contribution, the quantum interference term.
A similar explanation of the interference of Fruits and
Vegetables can be put forward for all the other exemplars.
The following is a general presentation of this. ‘For two
concepts A and B, with probabilities µ(A) and µ(A) for an
exemplar to be chosen as a good example of ‘A or B’, the
interference effect allows taking into account the speciﬁc
probability contribution for this exemplar to be chosen as
a good exemplar of the newly emerged concept ‘A or B’,
adding or subtracting to the value 1/2(µ(A)+µ(B)), which
is the average of µ(A) and µ(B).’
To conclude, we observe that ‘Fruits or Vegetables’ is not
the only case where quantum interference explains devia-
tions from classically expected reasoning. Various concept
combinations have been identiﬁed entailing such deviation,
for disjunctions, as well as for conjunctions [9].
V. A TWO-LAYERED STRUCTURE IN HUMAN THOUGHT
The detection of quantum structures in cognition has sug-
gested us to put forward the hypothesis that two speciﬁcally
structured and superposed layers can be identiﬁed in human
thought as a process [9], as follows.
(i) A classical logical layer. The thought process in
this layer is given form by an underlying classical logical
conceptual process. The manifest process itself may be, and
generally will be, indeterministic, but the indeterminism is
due to a lack of knowledge about the underlying determin-
istic classical process. For this reason the process within the
classical logical layer can be modeled by using a classical
Kolmogorovian probability description.
(ii) A quantum conceptual layer. The thought process in
this layer is given form under inﬂuence of the totality of
the surrounding conceptual landscape, where the different
concepts ﬁgure as individual entities, also when they are
combinations of other concepts, at variance with the clas-
sical logical layer where combinations of concepts ﬁgure
as classical combinations of entities and not as individ-
ual entities. In this sense one can speak of a conceptual
emergence taking place in this quantum conceptual layer,
certainly so for combinations of concepts. Quantum con-
ceptual thought has been identiﬁed in different domains
of knowledge and science related to different, often as
38

ICQNM 2012 : The Sixth International Conference on Quantum, Nano and Micro Technologies

paradoxically conceived, problems in these domains. The
sorts of measurable quantities being able to experimentally
identify quantum conceptual thought have been different in
these different domains, depending on which aspect of the
conceptual landscape was most obvious or most important
for the identiﬁcation of the deviation of classically expected
values of these quantities. For example, in a domain of
cognitive science where representations of concepts are
studied, and hence where concepts and combinations of
concepts, and relations of items, exemplars, instances or
features with concepts are considered, measurable quan-
tities such as ‘typicality’, ‘membership’, ‘similarity’ and
‘applicability’ have been studied and used to experimentally
put into evidence the deviation of what classically would
be expected for the values of these quantities. In decision
theory measurable quantities such as ‘representativeness’,
‘qualitative likelihood’, ‘similarity’ and ‘resemblance’ have
played this role. The quantum conceptual thought process
is indeterministic in essence, i.e. there is not necessarily an
underlying deterministic process independent of the context.
Hence, if analyzed deeper with the aim of ﬁnding more
deterministic sub-processes, unavoidably effects of context
will come into play. Since all concepts of the interconnected
web that forms the landscape of concepts and combinations
of them attribute as individual entities to the inﬂuences
reigning in this landscape, and more so since this happens
dynamically in an environment where they are all quantum
entangled structurally speaking, the nature of quantum con-
ceptual thought contains aspects that we strongly identify
as holistic and synthetic. However, the quantum conceptual
thought process is not unorganized or irrational. Quantum
conceptual thought is as ﬁrmly structured as classical logical
thought though in a different way. We believe that the
reason why science has hardly uncovered the structure of
quantum conceptual thought is because it has been believed
to be intuitive, associative, irrational, etc., meaning ‘rather
unstructured’. As a consequence of its basic features, an
idealized version of this quantum conceptual thought process
can be modeled as a quantum mechanical process.
The assumed existence of a quantum conceptual layer in
the human mind ﬁts in with some interesting achievements
that have been recently obtained in neuroscience [28], as we
will see in the next section.
VI. QUANTUM COGNITION AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE
BRAIN
A traditional view of the relation between brain and mind
is based on the neuroscience paradigm [29], according to
which the architecture of the brain is determined by connec-
tions between neurons, their inibitory/excitatory character,
and the strength of their connections. Roughly speaking,
the brain can be seen as a parallel distributed computer
containing many billions of neurons, that is, elementary
processors interconnected into a complex neural network. In
this architecture, the mind and the brain constitute one single
unit, which is characterized by a complementary dualism.
The mind is understood as a program carried out by the
brain, the program being speciﬁed by the neural network
architecture. Distributed representations of cognitive struc-
tures are studied in such an approach (see, e.g., holographic
reduced representations [30]–[33]).
Although the holographic approach is inspired by waves
and interference, it is not able to model the complex type
of interference that quantum entities undergo. It can be
seen by considering the values of the interference angles
of the interference pattern we obtain (see (12)), that the
modeling for the concept Fruit or Vegetables is intrinsically
quantum mechanical, not able to be reduced to interference
of classical waves. This means that, although along the same
lines as the holographic memory view [30], our approach
can introduce a way to consider and study the brain as
a quantum interference producing entity. Concretely we
produce a projection of a multi-dimensional complex Hilbert
space – 25 dimensional for the Fruits or Vegetables case – in
the three-dimensional real space, which is the environment
where the bio-mass of the brain is located.
In this respect, it is worthy to mention a recent ﬁnding
[28], where relationships of adjacency and crossing be-
tween cerebral ﬁber pathways in primates and humans were
analyzed by using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging.
The cerebral ﬁber pathways have been found to form a
rectilinear three-dimensional grid continuous with the three
principal axes of development. Cortico-cortical pathways
formed parallel sheets of interwoven paths in the longitu-
dinal and medio-lateral axes, in which major pathways were
local condensations. Cross-species homology was strong
and showed emergence of complex gyral connectivity by
continuous elaboration of this grid structure. This architec-
ture naturally supports functional spatio-temporal coherence,
developmental path-ﬁnding, and incremental rewiring with
correlated adaptation of structure and function in cerebral
plasticity and evolution [28]. The three-dimensional layered
structure schematized above puts at stake the ‘neural net-
work’ modeling of the brain, together with some aspects
of the neuroscience paradigm, and the brain/mind relation.
Such a very mathematically structured grid form would be
much closer to what one expect as an ideal medium for
interference than this is the case for the structure of a
traditional network.
At ﬁrst sight it might seem that the layered structures
that have been detected [28] are too simple to give rise
to complex cognition, even if interference is allowed to
play a prominent role, but that is misleading. Indeed, one
should not look upon the brain as ‘a container of complex
cognition’, but rather as ‘the canvas for the potentiality of
emergence of such complex cognition’. That makes a whole
difference. Indeed, we know how the rather simple math-
ematical structure of superposition in a linear vector space
39
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2012.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-214-1
ICQNM 2012 : The Sixth International Conference on Quantum, Nano and Micro Technologies

and tensor product of linear vector spaces give rise to both
emergence and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Also
there this mathematical structure plays the role of canvas,
where the emergent and entangled states can ﬁnd a seat to
be realized. This is exactly what the role of the recently
detected grid could be, due to its rather simple mathematical
structure, at least compared to the structure of a network, it
could make available in a mathematically systematic way
the canvas where emergent states of new concepts can ﬁnd
their seat. This is then a mechanism fundamentally different
from what one expects in networks, where ‘new connections
are only made when they are needed’. Structures that have
generative power can shape ‘empty space’ for potentiality,
and ‘creation of new’, hence emergence can take place in
a much more powerful way. Of course, there will be a bias
coming from the generating structures, which is a drawback
compared to the network way. This bias could exactly be an
explanation for the functioning of the human brain leading
to automated aspects of conceptual reasoning such as ‘the
disjunction and conjunction effects’. The above analysis
is highly relevant for representations of genuine cognitive
models in technology, for example as attempted in artiﬁcial
intelligence and robotics [34]–[36].
We recall, to conclude this section, that the employment of
quantum structures in the modeling of cognitive disciplines
does not presuppose, though is not incompatible with, the
requirement that microscopic quantum processes occur in
the human brain. We indeed avoided such a compelling
assumption in this paper.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
To understand how concepts combine in human thought
to form sentences and texts and how meaning ﬂows be-
tween human minds using such combinations, is one of
the age-old problems of cognitive sciences. Apart from
it being a cornerstone for a deeper understanding of hu-
man thought and mind, progress in many ﬁelds, including
psychology, linguistics, artiﬁcial intelligence, and cognitive
science, depends crucially on this combination mechanism.
Also important scientiﬁc problems, such as text analysis,
information retrieval and human-computer interaction rely
directly on insights into a deeper understanding of how
concepts combine. Although much investigation effort has
been put in this problem, very little substantial results have
been obtained. However, models of concepts making use of
the mathematical formalisms of quantum theory have been
substantially more successful than classical approaches at
modeling data generated in studies of combinations of two
concepts. In this paper, we have presented an improved and
more complete version of our quantum modeling approach,
and we have provided a description of the overextension
and underextension measured by Hampton in the disjunction
Fruits or Vegetables as an effect of quantum interference.
We have shown that quantum interference patterns naturally
appear whenever suitable exemplars of this disjunction are
taken into account. We have analyzed the graphs revealing
the interference pattern of Fruits or Vegetables and compared
them with the interference of light in a double-slit quantum
experiment. The identiﬁcation of quantum structures in cog-
nitive disciplines allowed us to derive two relevant insights
concerning thought processes and the mind/brain relation.
First, it suggests that two superposed and interconnected
layers – a classical logical and a quantum conceptual –
are present in human thought as a process, as already put
forward by ourselves in some previous papers. Second, the
three-dimensional grid structure recently discovered in the
brain could explain, better than the neural network structure,
the emergence of new concepts which we recognized in
the present paper as responsible of the quantum effects of
superposition and interference in concept combinations. In
this new perspective, the brain would not be seen as a
container of complex cognition but, rather, as the canvas for
the potentiality of emergence of such complex cognition.
The results attained in this paper suggest that quantum
models can be useful to operatonally describe the function-
ing of the human brain without presupposing any micro-
scopic quantum explanation of brain functioning, and can be
also interesting for the community of quantum technology
researchers.
