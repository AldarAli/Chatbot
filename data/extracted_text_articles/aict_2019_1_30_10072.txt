I. 
INTRODUCTION 
In the network management process, it is of interest to 
the network operator to focus on user satisfaction, by 
continuously monitoring the user QoE and, if necessary, 
adjust the QoE by operating on the network QoS.  
In order to do this, it is essential to establish a link 
between QoE perceived by the user and QoS offered by the 
network. QoS defines the network quality and it is measured 
by quantitative parameters named Key Performance 
Indicators (KPI), such as packet loss, delay and jitter [1]-
[4]. On the other hand, QoE defines the quality subjectively 
perceived by the end-user, and gives information on how 
well the network meets the user’s needs. QoE is measured 
by qualitative parameters, named Key Quality Indicators 
(KQI), such as "very good", "good", "poor"[5]-[8].  
If the relationship between QoE and QoS is known, the 
network operator may measure the network KPIs and adjust 
them to obtain satisfactory KQIs for the end-user. So, it is 
important to make such a relationship known.  
The LTE standard  assures to deliver high performance 
and quality IP services, like voice call, but only focuses on 
the definition of network performance (QoS), without 
giving  its relationship with the QoE [9]-[13].  
However, the network operator needs to exploit such a 
relationship in order to meet the Service Level Agreement 
(SLA) established with the end-user. By knowing this 
relationship, the network operator may predict the QoE that 
can be offered simply based on QoS measurements.  
The scope of this paper is thus to mathematically 
express this relationship in network scenarios delivering 
VoLTE services. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces 
the basic mathematics to evaluate the VoLTE QoE. Section 
III introduces the related works. Section IV introduces 
proposed relationship between QoE and QoS in VoLTE and 
Section V validates such a relationship in simulated 
scenarios.  
 
II. 
BASIC ANALYTICS FOR THE VOLTE QOE 
VoLTE is the voice service delivered in LTE all-IP 
Packet-Switched domain, in which the network operator 
provides the service by means of its own network, so that 
he can manage all phases of the service.  
VoLTE calls provisioning is made possible by specific 
architectural elements composing the so called Internet 
Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), standardized by Third 
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in [14][15].  
In considering the User Plane, some remarks are 
necessary in understanding the VoLTE procedure. For what 
concerns the protocol stack, the User Equipment (UE) and 
the IMS entities that terminate the User Plane must use the 
Real Time Protocol (RTP) at Application Layer [16]. So, 
voice streams of the same voice call follow the same RTP 
flow. However, VoLTE is delivered in a packet switched 
domain, where IP packets of the same RTP flow can reach 
the destination by means of different network paths, and 
consequently with different delays.  
This phenomenon is measured by a KPI, also known as 
network jitter or packet delay variation, that can be 
calculated in real-time as the floating average of differences 
between the timestamps, contained in the RTP protocol 
header, of consecutively received packets [17][18].  
Jitter can affect heavily the perceived quality of a voice 
call, and for this reason, at the receiver side, de-jitter buffers 
are implemented, with the aim of re-establishing the right 
order of IP packets, by adding to each packet a proper delay.  
If the end-to-end delay of a packet is greater than de-
jitter buffer dimension, the packet is discarded. The 
consequence of this operation is a degradation of voice 
quality [19][20]. 
 
Concerning VoLTE QoE, the most relevant KQI is the 
Mean Opinion Score (MOS), an adimensional subjective 
parameter for the evaluation of voice call quality, with 
values in the range between 1 and 5 [19][20].   
MOS can be estimated by the E-Model algorithm, 
whose output is the R-Factor, defined in [21]-[24]. Table I

below illustrates the matching between R-factor and MOS 
values. 
The R-factor can be expressed as follows, according to 
[21]: 
𝑅 = 𝑅0 − 𝐼𝑠 − 𝐼𝑑 − 𝐼𝑒,𝑒𝑓𝑓 + 𝐴.                (1) 
where: 
- R0 is the Signal to Interference Ratio;  
- Is is a combination of impairment factors, occurring 
simultaneously or not in the voice session; 
- Id is an impairment factor due to talk and listener echo, 
and delay contributions;  
- A is known as Expectation or Advantage Factor, with 
values from 0 to 20, as shown in table 2/G.107 in [18]; 
- Ie,eff stands for Equipment Factor, and represents the 
impairment caused  by low bit rate CODEC, and packet 
loss. In the ITU-T G.107 recommendation [21], this 
parameter has been expressed by: 
𝐼𝑒,𝑒𝑓𝑓 = 𝐼𝑒 + (95 − 𝐼𝑒)
𝑃𝑝𝑙
𝑃𝑝𝑙+𝐵𝑝𝑙.                        (2)                                                                                                                 
where Ie and Bpl are parameters that can assume values 
as indicated in the recommendation, and  Ppl is the packet 
loss, in a range of values between 0 and 1, calculated as: 
𝑃𝑝𝑙 = 1 −
𝑚
𝑛.                                  (3)                                                                                                                                  
where m is the number of   RTP packets received and n 
is the number of RTP packets sent, with uncorrelated losses 
[21]. Packet loss is an important KPI to take into account, 
as seen further on.

RELATED WORKS 
The analysis of User Experience in real time services 
like Voice over IP (VoIP), VoLTE and Video over LTE 
(ViLTE) has been the object of several studies in literature, 
taking into account voice services delivered over an IP core 
network, and a radio access network that can be LTE access 
network or Wi-Fi and WiMAX one. 
In [25] the impact of QoS parameters (such as packet 
loss and packet delay) on the QoE of ViLTE is evaluated by 
using a test-bed integrating the real network with an UE 
under test.

In [26], the MOS is used to adaptively control the QoE 
of VoIP services periodically determined by means of a 
modified version of E-Model. 
In [27], by using an OPNET simulation model, MOS, 
delay and jitter have been observed in a VoIP application, 
with a network scenario in which the radio access system is 
either Wi-Fi or WiMAX. 
In [28], simulation results are presented that show the 
improvements that can be obtained in the VoLTE MOS by 
use of a  closed-loop power control algorithm applied to the 
downlink of the VoLTE radio bearer for an indoor scenario 
served by small cells. 
In [29], the MOS of VoIP services in 3G mobile 
networks is evaluated in applications like Line and Skype. 
QoS parameters as jitter and packet loss were measured and 
the QoE was derived using the  QoS versus QoE tables 
defined by the G.107 ITU-T [21].  
In [30], a dynamic adaptation algorithm of joint source-
channel code rate is used to improve the  VoLTE QoE. The 
wideband E-Model is used to assess the voice quality.  
 
All mentioned works perform  QoE measurements on 
actual platforms. 
Unfortunately, QoE measurements are to be performed 
on the user devices (rather than on the network), but the 
measurements of this type need expensive user test 
equipment. 
For this reason, this paper approach is to mathematically 
derive QoE from QoS, since QoS measurements can be 
easily obtained directly on the network, by use of standard 
equipment. 
In literature, a series of studies can be found that derive 
the QoE from QoS by use of a  mathematical relationship 
holding between the two [31]-[33].  
However, such studies refer to VoIP services, while in this 
paper the mathematical relationship holding for VoLTE is 
derived. 
 
IV. 
THE VOLTE QOE MODEL 
A mathematical relationship between QoS and QoE 
holding for VoIP has been introduced in [32][33]. This 
relationship is known as the IQX Hypothesis (exponential 
interdependency of Quality of Experience and Quality of 
Service).   
In such a relationship, QoE depends on only one QoS 
parameter, and it is expressed as follows: 
𝑄𝑜𝐸 = 𝛼𝑒−𝛽𝑄𝑜𝑆 + 𝛾.                           (4)                      
where α, β and γ in (4) are calculated by means of non-
linear regression. An example of regression result is as 
follows: 
𝑓(𝑝𝐿) = 2.861𝑒−29.816𝑝𝐿 + 1.134.                (5)                      
where the QoE, in MOS,  is indicated with f(pL)  and the 
QoS parameter is packet loss [32][33].

The IQX hypothesis has been drawn up for an IP 
context, and it  is related to a particular service, the voice 
call, so it can represent a good starting point in establishing 
QoE/QoS relationship for VoLTE. 
The IQX hypothesis deals with voice application and 
with a QoE/QoS relationship based on only one QoS 
parameter (either jitter or packet loss). In this paper, instead, 
the  QoE of voice application is assessed by basing the 
relationship on two QoS parameters (both jitter and packet 
loss). 
To this scope, in the model presented here, the strict 
packet loss expression (3) will be replaced by an expression 
that includes the contribution of packet loss and jitter, 
known as effective packet loss Ppl,eff , defined in [31]: 
𝑃𝑝𝑙,𝑒𝑓𝑓 = 1 − (1 − 𝑃𝑝𝑙)(1 − 𝑃𝑗𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟).                  (6)                                                                                                                               
where Ppl remains the packet loss from (3), and jitter is 
expressed as a Pareto probability by writing: 
𝑃𝑗𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑟 =
1
2 (1 −
0.1𝑥
𝜎 )
20
.                          (7)                                                                                                                                  
where x is the jitter buffer dimension and σ is network 
jitter delay, both expressed in [ms]. 
The Ppl,eff  in (6) can be considered as a further KPI 
resulting from the combination of two original KPIs, 
network jitter and packet loss  [20].  
By replacing (6) in the exponent of (4), the expression 
for MOS becomes: 
𝑀𝑂𝑆 = 𝛼𝑒−𝛽𝑃𝑝𝑙,𝑒𝑓𝑓 + 𝛾.                     (8)                                                                                                                 
Apart from its academic interest, the equation (8) could 
be useful for the network operator to predict the User 
Experience starting from the variation of the combined jitter 
and packet-loss parameters. The next Section provides the 
necessary validation of (8) in the VoLTE context. 
 
V. 
VALIDATION OF THE QOE VERSUS QOS 
RELATIONSHIP FOR VOLTE SERVICES 
The use of simulation is the first step for the 
comprehension of network mechanisms that can affect 
performances and services. A well done simulation model 
can help to get the perspective view of the network, without 
turning to expensive ad hoc experimental solutions, used in 
real scenarios. 
In this research, OPNET Modeler [34] has been used to 
simulate an LTE network with the IMS section, since 
OPNET offers a plurality of modules and network nodes 
compliant with the 3GPP LTE standard. Moreover, OPNET 
also allows to monitor the network performance by placing 
probing points on the simulated network. 
An OPNET simulation model gives in output KPIs like 
jitter and packet loss and system KQIs like MOS. These 
parameters are evaluated at application level.  
Simulation parameters such as number of simulation 
runs or initial bias removal are taken care of internally by 
OPNET, in order to guarantee the statistical significance of 
the results. 
Figure 1 gives the geographical overview of the 
simulated scenario. The IMS, (see Sect. II), using Session 
Initiation Protocol (SIP) application signaling protocol, is 
responsible for initiating, maintaining and terminating 
VoLTE call set-up in LTE.  
In the model, IMS is physically located in Milan and it 
is composed of standardized nodes Proxy Call Session 
Control Function (P-CSCF), Serving Call Session Control 
Function (S-CSCF) and Interrogating Call Session Control 
Function (I-CSCF), simulated by means of proxy servers, 
linked to Gtwy2 by a 1000BaseX link [14][15].   
The Gtwy2 and IP_Backbone are linked via the 
PPP_DS1, and the IP_Backbone is linked to Gtwy1 by a 
similar link. Gtwy1 and Gtwy2 are simulated by an OPNET 
Ethernet4_slip8_gtwy, i.e., a router with 4 Ethernet and 8 
IP interfaces. 
A “Campus Network” node, physically located in 
Rome, and detailed in Figure 2, is linked to Gtwy1 via a 
1000BaseX link. The Campus Network is a LTE network, 
with physical dimension of 10x10 Km, composed of 
various OPNET elements: 
 
An Evolved Packet Core (EPC) node, fully 
compliant with the standard; 
 
Two eNodeB nodes. 
 
Eight mobile workstations (UE_1_1, UE_1_2, 
UE_1_3_t and UE_1_3_t2 attached to eNB_1; 
and UE_2_1, UE_2_2, UE_2_3_t, UE_2_3_t2 
attached to eNB_2), to represent eight User 
equipment generating and receiving IP traffic. 
 
A File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. 
 
An Application Definition Node, for the 
characterization of application parameters. 
 
A Profile Definition Node, creating the profiles 
that generate the traffic in a specific temporal 
order, by means of the applications defined with 
the Application Definition Node. 
 
An LTE Configuration Node, setting physical 
LTE configurations and EPS Bearer specification. 
 
An IP QoS Node, for the definition of scheduling 
policies. 
 
The connections between the two eNodeBs and the 
EPC, and between the EPC and the FTP server simulate a 
1000BaseX link (44.736 Mbps). 
The propagation settings of the radio interface section 
between UEs and eNodeBs simulate a typical urban 
scenario.

VI. 
THE SIMULATED TRAFFIC LOAD 
In order to simulate a realistic network scenario, in 
addition to VoLTE traffic, background traffic has also been 
generated. It consists of FTP, Voice over IP and Video 
Streaming applications.  
The application protocols taken into account are RTP 
for VoLTE and VoIP over LTE, and Real Time Streaming 
Protocol (RTSP) for Video Streaming. 
For what concerns FTP, it consists of a file transfer from 
a server to the UE, so the transport protocol is User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP).  
The characteristics of monitored and background 
applications are: 
 
 
VoLTE (monitored application) 
Codec: RTP Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) 12.2K  
Frame size: 10 ms 
Code rate: 64 kbps 
Uplink Guaranted Bit Rate: 1 Mbps 
Downlink Guaranted Bit Rate: 1 Mbps 
ToS: Interactive Voice - 6 
QoS Class Identifier (QCI): 1 
Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) = 1 
 
FTP application (background traffic) 
Packet dimension: 1000 byte 
FTP get, UE download file from FTP server 
Type of Service (ToS): Best Effort - 0 
ARP = 5  
 
 
Voice application (background traffic) 
Codec: RTP AMR 12.2K 
Frame size: 10 ms 
Code rate: 64 kbps 
ToS: Interactive Multimedia - 5 
ARP = 2 
 
 
Video Streaming application (background traffic) 
ToS: Interactive Multimedia - 5 
ARP = 4 
 
The simulated run time was for 800 sec. The VoLTE 
application starts 170 sec after the simulation begins, and it 
remains active until simulation ends.  
The FTP application starts 135 sec after the simulation 
begins, and it is composed of 2 active blocks of 120 sec 
each, with an inter-repetition time of 300 sec between the 
blocks.  
The Voice and Video Streaming applications both start 
170 sec after the simulation begins, and they remain active 
until the simulation ends.  
The VoLTE application runs between UE_1_1 (the 
caller) and UE_2_1 (the called).  
The FTP application runs between UE_1_2, UE_2_2, 
and the FTP server.   
The Voice application runs between UE_1_3_t (the 
caller) and UE_2_3_t (the called).  
The Video Streaming application runs between 
UE_1_3_t2 and UE_2_3_t2.

VII. ANALYSIS OF THE SIMULATION OUTPUT 
OPNET has been used to investigate the trend of the QoE 
(MOS) versus increasing values of jitter and packet loss. To 
obtain variations in the VoLTE  jitter  and packet loss, various 
changes in the above described four traffic loads have been 
operated.  
By setting the timing of such traffic loads, the VoLTE traffic 
has been monitored, and performance parameters have been 
collected.  
Several scenarios have been simulated versus  increasing 
values of jitter and packet loss and simulation results have been 
extracted by means of probes placed on the network nodes and 
interfaces.  
The values of the network KPIs (VoLTE network jitter and 
VoLTE packet loss) and the KQI (VoLTE MOS) obtained from 
simulation have been analyzed with the Matlab regression 
toolbox in order to estimate the α, β and γ parameters holding 
for VoLTE. 
In a first approach, simulation has been used to check under 
which condition the IQX Hypothesis in (4), originally 
introduced for VoIP, could also hold for VoLTE. To this 
purpose, the behavior of the VoLTE MOS was plot versus the 
network jitter first, and then versus the packet loss Ppl defined in 
(3).  
Figure 3 gives the plot of MOS versus network jitter and 
shows that its mathematical regression (with a coefficient of 
correlation 0.998) well complies with the exponential behavior 
of (4). This proves that relationship (4), originally introduced for 
VoIP, also holds for VoLTE services. 
Figure 4 instead shows that no exponential relationship holds 
between the VoLTE MOS and packet loss. In other words, the 
IQX Hypothesis can be extended to VoLTE, under condition 
that the QoS parameter appearing in the exponent of (4) is 
network jitter, while no extension holds in case the exponent is 
packet loss Ppl. 
The question then arises: what happens if, in place of  the Ppl 
defined in (3),  the Ppl,eff defined in (6) is instead used in the 
exponent,  i.e. if  a combination of jitter and packet loss is used? 
In other words, what happens if the VoLTE MOS is expressed 
by (8)? 
Figure 5 shows that the mathematical regression of the 
simulation MOS versus Ppl,eff well complies with the exponential 
behavior of (8) and this gives the expected validation of formula 
(8) for  the VoLTE context. To strengthen such a proof, the 
VoLTE MOS produced from simulation was plot versus Pjitter 
defined in (7) and versus the standard packet loss Ppl defined in 
(3), taken separately. 
The result can be seen in Figure 6 where the simulation 
output is compared with the mathematical 3D regression 
obtained using the two QoS parameters separately. The 
exponential relationship is shown to hold. 
This completes the simulation validation of  model (8). Such 
validation has been confirmed by real world tests  performed on 
the VoLTE national scenario, in cooperation with  the TIM  
telecommunication company, on  the occasion of  a patent  filing 
[35].

VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
The LTE standard only focuses on the definition of network 
QoS, without giving its relationship with the QoE. In this paper, 
a hypothesis relationship was introduced and proved valid for 
VoLTE services by use of an OPNET simulation model. 
Validation was confirmed by real world tests performed in 
cooperation with the telecommunication company TIM, on the 
VoLTE  national scenario.  
Knowing this relationship, the network management can 
adjust the network KPIs (packet loss and jitter) to continuously 
meet the QoE expected from the SLA negotiated with the end-
user.
