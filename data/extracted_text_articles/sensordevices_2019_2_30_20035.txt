Abstract— In this paper, we observed the evolution of the
transmission
and
reflection
parameters
of
composites
containing
magnetic
microwire
inclusions
during
the
composites matrix polymerization. A remarkable change of the
reflection and transmission in the range of 4-7 GHz upon the
matrix polymerization is observed. The observed dependencies
are discussed considering variation of temperature and stresses
during
the
thermoset
matrix
polymerization
and
their
influence on magnetic properties of glass-coated microwires.
The obtained results are considered as a base for a novel

INTRODUCTION
Amorphous magnetic materials can present an unusual
combination of excellent magnetic properties (e.g., high
magnetic permeability, Giant MagnetoImpedance (GMI),
effect,
magnetic
bistability,
Matteucci
and
Widemann
effects) and superior mechanical properties (plasticity,
flexibility) making them suitable for numerous industrial
applications [1]-[6]. The aforementioned soft magnetic
properties
are
originated
by
the
absence
of
the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy and defects (dislocations,
grain boundaries, etc.), typical for crystalline magnets [1]-
[3][6]-[8]. Furthermore, the preparation method involving
rapid melt quenching is quite fast and inexpensive and the
above mentioned magnetic softness can be realized without
any complex post-processing treatments [3]-[5].
The development of novel applications of amorphous
materials
requires
new
functionalities,
i.e.,
reduced
dimensions,
enhanced
corrosion
resistance
or
biocompatibility [8]. Therefore, great attention has been
paid to the development of alternative fabrication methods
allowing the preparation of amorphous materials at micro-
nano scale involving melt quenching [6]-[8].
Glass-coated microwires prepared using the Taylor-
Ulitovsky
method
fit
to
most
of
aforementioned
expectation:
such
magnetic
microwires
have
micro-
nanometric diameters (typically 0.5-50 m) covered by thin,
insulating, biocompatible and flexible glass-coating [7]-[11]
and can present excellent magnetic softness or magnetic
bistability [7][9][11]. These features of the glass-coated
microwires allow development of new exciting applications
in various magnetic sensors [12]-[16], as well as in smart
composites with tunable magnetic permittivity [17]-[19].
One more advantage of the glass-coated microwires is
excellent mechanical properties [5].
Recently, the stress dependence of hysteresis loops and
GMI effect are proposed for the mechanical stresses
monitoring
in
Fiber
Reinforced
Composites
(FRC)
containing microwires inclusions or using magnetoelastic
sensors based on stress dependence of various magnetic
properties [18][20][21]. One of the common problems in the
composite
materials is the
monitoring of the
matrix
polymerization as well as stresses monitoring. Usually, the
polymerization process monitoring is performed by different
sensors, like the pressure transducers and dielectric sensors
[22]. However, employed sensors require direct contact with
the resin and of its electronic associated [22]. One of the
proposed solutions for non-destructive FRC monitoring is
the use of piezoelectric fibers with diameters of 10 to 100
μm [23]. However, this solution requires electrical field 
supply plates occupying a significant area.
One of the promising solutions addressing the problem
of non-destructive FRC monitoring is a novel sensing
technique involving free space microwave spectroscopy
utilizing ferromagnetic microwire inclusions presenting the
high frequency impedance quite sensitive to tensile stress
and magnetic field [17][18][24]. Mentioned above glass-
coated microwires, with metallic nucleus diameters of 0.5 -
50 μm, presenting excellent mechanical and corrosive 
properties fit perfectly the requirements of this technique
making it suitable for remote stresses and temperature
monitoring in FRCs [17][18][24].
In this work, we provide our recent results on the study
of stresses arising during the polymerization of the matrix in

FRCs on permittivity of the FRC with embedded microwire
inclusions.
Consequently,
in
this
paper,
we
present
new
experimental
results
on
direct
monitoring
of
the
polymerization process in the FRC preparation using
embedded Co-based glass-coated microwires.
In
Section
II,
we
present
the
description
of
the
experimental techniques, while in Section III we describe the
results on in-situ observation of the effect of matrix
polymerization
on
the
transmission,
T,
reflection,
R,
parameters of microwire arrays measured using the free-
space system and compare them with the effect of applied
tensile stresses on hysteresis loops of the studied microwires.
We conclude in Section IV.
II.
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Glass-coated Fe3.8Co65.4Ni1B13.8Si13Mo1.35C1.65 (metallic
nucleus diameter, d=18.8 μm, total diameter, D=22.2 μm, 
=d/D= 0.88) microwires with low negative magnetostriction
coefficients, λs, have been prepared by Taylor-Ulitovsky
technique described elsewhere [7][8][11][12]. As previously
reported by us, as-prepared Fe3.8Co65.4Ni1B13.8Si13Mo1.35C1.65
microwires present good magnetic softness, high GMI effect
and low negative magnetostriction coefficients, λs, of about -
0.1x10-6 [25][26].
The temperature during the polymerization process has
been measured by a standard thermocouple.
For the composite matrix, we used a vinylester resin
(DERAKANE 8084 resin), accelerated with Cobalt Octoate
(0,3 pph) and catalyzed with Methyl Ethyl Ketona (MEK
60%, 1,5 pph). DERAKANE 8084 epoxy vinyl ester resin is
an elastomer modified resin designed to offer increased
adhesive strength, superior resistance to abrasion and severe
mechanical stress, while providing greater toughness and
elongation. The liquid resin exhibit the following properties:
the density at 25°C is of 1.02 g/mL, the dynamic viscosity at
25°C is of 360 MPa and the styrene content is of 40%. All
technical resin information appears in its technical data
sheet (Document 1820 V5 F2, Language ES “draft”, © 2017
Ashland Inc.).
Consequently, we used the free space measurement
system, previously described in details in [18][24]. In this
method,
the
microwire
inclusions
embedded
in
the
polymeric
matrix
play
the
role
of
“the
elementary
scatterers”, when the electromagnetic microwave irradiates
the composite. At sufficiently high frequencies (GHz range),
both the microwire magnetic and conductive properties will
contribute to the microwave dielectric properties of the
composite materials filled with short conductive microwire
inclusions which now depends not only on the matrix and
the embedded wires conductivity, but also on an effective ac
permeability
[18].
Consequently,
the
external
stimuli
(magnetic field, applied stresses, etc.) will significantly
modulate the initial dielectric properties of the composite
matrix [18].
In our free-space measurement system we followed the
near
field
measurement
scheme
[18]
which
includes
broadband horn antennas and the Through Reflection Line
(TRL)
free-space
calibration.
The
reflection
(R)
and
transmission (T) coefficients were measured in free-space.
The experimental set-up consists of a pair of broadband
horn antennas (1-17 GHz) and a vector network analyzer.
The composite was placed in a 20 x 20 cm2 window to
avoid the edge effects. This window limits the applicable
frequency range in 4-17 GHz. More detailed description of
the free space systems is given in our previous publications
[18] [24].
The composites with ordered glass coated amorphous
wires embedded in the thermoset matrix polymerization
were prepared (see Figure 1).
The polymerizing matrix provides external stimuli for
the microwire inclusions (see Figure 1), which affects the
magnetic properties and the GMI effect of microwires.
Hysteresis
loops
of
single
microwires
have
been
measured using the fluxmetric method previously described
in details elsewhere [27]. In order to evaluate the influence
of the external parameters (i.e., applied stress), similarly to
that we recently described [22][28][29], we represent the
hysteresis loops and normalized magnetization, M/M0, versus
magnetic field, H, where M is the magnetic moment at a
given magnetic field and M0 is the magnetic moment of the
sample at the maximum magnetic field amplitude, Hm.
The stress has been applied during the annealing as well
as during the sample cooling with the furnace.
Furthermore, the effect of applied stresses on hysteresis
loops of individual microwires has been measured in order
to compare with the effect of the matrix polymerization.
The value of applied stresses within the metallic nucleus
has been evaluated as previously described [25]:

coating respectively. The value of the applied stresses
evaluated using (1) was up to 472 MPa.
The
Differential
Scanning
Calorimetry
(DSC)
measurements were performed using DSC 204 F1 Netzsch
calorimeter in Ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 K/min
up to temperature, T, of 900 oC.
However,
the
internal
stresses,
σi,
arise
during
simultaneous
rapid
quenching
of
metallic
nucleus
surrounding by the glass coating due to the different thermal
expansion coefficients. Consequently, the internal stresses
magnitude can be controlled by the glass-coating thickness:
the strength of internal stresses increases with the increasing
of the glass-coating thickness [28]-[30][35].
III.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
During the polymerization process of the resin, volume
shrinkage of about 8.2 % occurs and solid cured resin is
obtained. The mechanical properties of the cured resin are
the following: tensile strength of 76 MPa, tensile modulus
of 2,9 GPa, and tensile elongation of 8-10%. However,
additionally to the matrix shrinkage a considerable heating
takes place.
Therefore, in order to understand the processes during
the polymerization of the composite that can affect the
microwires, we have measured the evolution of temperature
using a thermocouple. The obtained temperature changes
during the polymerization represented at temperature, T,
versus time, t, are shown in Figure 2. As can be observed
from the Figure 2, the matrix polymerization produces a
heating of the composite up to 80 oC.
In order to ensure that the employed microwires
maintain their amorphous structure we performed the DSC
studies of the crystallization temperature in order to evaluate
the crystallization temperature. As can be observed from
Figure 3 the crystallization temperature, Tcr, (determined as
the beginning of the first crystallization peak) is about 554
oC (see Figure 3). Therefore, all the changes observed in the
experiments
must be attributed to the magnetoelastic
behavior of the employed microwires only.
As described above, we performed in-situ experiments
of composites placed inside the anechoic chamber with the
glass-coated
microwires
embedded
in
a
polymerized
composite. We measured the transmission, T, and reflection,
R,
parameters
of
the
composite
containing
Co-rich
microwires (Fe3.8Co65.4Ni1B13.8Si13Mo1.35C1.65) using the free
space system.
As can be appreciated from Figure 4, considerable
variation of the T-parameter is observed in the range of
frequency,
f,
of
4-7
GHz
upon
thermoset
matrix
polymerization (Figure 4). A non-monotonic variation of T-
parameter upon polymerization is observed (Figure 4a).
Additionally,
some
changes
of
R-parameter
are
also
observed in a wide f- range (Figure 4b).
From experimentally measured T and R parameters, the
absorption, A, parameter can be evaluated. Similarly to T

and R parameters, some changes in A(f) dependence during
the polymerization are observed (see Figure 5).
The observed changes of the electromagnetic properties
can be related to two main phenomena arising during the
composite matrix polymerization: heating and mechanical
stresses.
As
we
mentioned
above,
the
polymerization
is
accompanied by a change of density, matrix shrinkage
heating. Although generally, the distribution of the internal
stresses arising at polymerization is non-homogeneous [30],
an important fact is that the matrix shrinks as it cools.
Therefore, we can assume that the matrix shrinkage
produces compressive stresses in the magnetic nucleus of
the glass-coated microwires.
The observed T(f) dependencies are non-monotonic:
some increase of T observed up to t=15 min (at f ≈4-7 GPa) 
followed by T decrease at t>15 min. Such evolution of T-
parameter can therefore be associated with the heating and
consequent cooling of the FRC.
However, the hysteresis loops of the studied samples are
considerably affected by the applied tensile stresses, as
shown in Figure 6.
To understand the effect of heating on the magnetic
properties, we must consider the character of the internal
mechanical stresses in the magnetic microwires. In fact, the
main part of the mechanical stresses is originated by the
difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the
metallic alloy and the glass-coating [31]-[34]. As shown
elsewhere [35], the main part of the metallic nucleus of the
microwire (up to r ~ 0.85 R, where R is the metallic nucleus
radius, r- metallic nucleus radius), has tensile stresses.
Therefore,
the
difference
in
the
thermal
expansion
coefficients of the metallic alloy and the glass-coating upon
heating becomes smaller, allowing the reduction of the
internal
stresses.
This
assumption
has
recently
been
confirmed by direct observation of the heating effect on
hysteresis loop of Co-rich microwires with vanishing
magnetostriction coefficient [35]. The transformation of the
hysteresis loop from linear to rectangular upon heating was
explained by the easy anisotropy direction change from
circumferential to axial upon heating.
In contrast to the temperature that non-monotonously
changes during the polymerization, we assume that the
compressive stresses, due to the matrix shrinkage, change
monotonously. Therefore, we assume that the changes
observed in Figures 5 and 6 are originated by both heating
and matrix shrinkage during the polymerization.
Eventually, the same technique can be used for the
remote monitoring of stress or temperature, not only during
the polymerization, but also for real time non-destructive
monitoring of local stresses and temperature during the
exploitation of the composites.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we propose a novel sensing technique
for non-destructive and non-contact monitoring of the
composites utilizing ferromagnetic glass-coated microwire
inclusions with magnetic properties sensitive to tensile
stress and temperature. To demonstrate it, we have studied
in-situ the impact of the matrix polymerization on the
evolution of the transmission and reflection parameters of
the composites with microwire inclusions.
We observed a considerable variation of the T-parameter
(in the range of 4-7 GHz) and R-parameter upon the
composite polymerization using the free space technique.
The observed dependencies are discussed considering the
matrix shrinkage during the polymerization and heating
during the matrix polymerization and their influence on the
magnetic properties of the glass-coated microwires.
The
obtained
experimental
results
yield
new
and
important insights suitable for the development of a novel
sensing technique for non-destructive and non-contact
monitoring of the FRCs utilizing ferromagnetic glass-coated
microwire inclusions.
Consequently, a novel sensing technique for non-
destructive and non-contact monitoring of the composites
utilizing ferromagnetic glass-coated microwire inclusions
with quite soft magnetic properties and tunable magnetic
permittivity sensitive to tensile stress and temperature is
proposed.
