Comparison of Receiver Architecture in Terms of Power Consumption and Noise Figure 
for Cochlear Implants Application 
 
 
 
Abstractâ€“ Change in patients requirements has lead to new 
cochlear implants architecture specifications. In this paper, we 
proposed the receiver chain architecture study and design for 
new type of cochlear implants. Two receiver architectures were 
compared in terms of power consumption and Noise Figure, 
both of fundamental importance in biomedical embedded 
systems. SPICE simulations of the these architectures were 
carried out and transient results were presented for the solution 
retained. Furthermore optimization of the Low Noise Amplifier 
(LNA) 
using 
mathematical 
computations 
is 
presented, 
increasing the entire receiver performances.

INTRODUCTION 
Cochlear implant is a device aiming to aid severely deaf 
people to partially recover hearing (electrical description of 
cochlear implant can be found in). A prototype aiming to 
make the implant less noticeable is presented in. In this new 
cochlear implant prototype,  the transmitter is inserted inside 
the auditory canal, sending Radio Frequency (RF) waves 
(allowing reduced antenna size) to the receiver located inside 
the patientâ€™ s skull. As the auditory canal space is limited, the 
battery size and its charge are the main limiting factors for the 
emitter design, diminishing its performances.  
  
Figure 1: Transmitter architecture (redrawn from) 
 
According to the work presented in, the Digital Signal 
Processor (DSP) that was previously located in the emitter, 
can be integrated on the receiver. This has the advantage of 
reducing the emitter consumption but on the other hand 
implies an electrical architecture reworking. The emitter has 
already been presented in  and the architecture is recalled in 
Figure 1. The input signal coming from the microphone was 
compared with a ramp reference signal to create a Pulse 
Width Modulated (PWM) signal, then multiplied by a 
2.45GHz oscillator to create the RF signal sent to the 
transmitter antenna. 
The aim of this paper is to select the receiver architecture 
fitting the most with the cochlear implants specifications and 
then to optimize its critical block in terms of Noise Figure 
and power consumption as explained in Section III. The 
receiver architectures overview is presented in Section IV, 
followed by the mathematical optimization of the LNA. Two 
different types of receiver front end architectures are then 
discussed and compared in terms of added noise and power 
consumption (Section V.), before presenting our concluding 
remarks and preferences. 
II. 
RECEIVER ARCHITECTURE 
The communication channel between the transmit- and 
the receive antenna is presented in, leading to an estimated 
received power of -87dBm, and added noise in the 
propagation channel of -95dBm. Those values were 
computed from the maximal authorized emitted power in the 
ISM band (20dBm), the attenuation in human tissue with 
corresponding dielectric constants, the ISM bandwidth 
(80MHz) and assuming a white noise distribution. This fixes 
the LNA sensitivity and is used as basis for the receiver 
specifications and architecture selection.  
The selected architecture for the receiver includes a low 
noise amplifier followed by an amplitude demodulation stage 
and a digital signal processing unit controlling the electrodes 
array, which is implanted inside the patientâ€™s cochlea.  
Electrodes array are the most consuming part of the receiver 
(their power consumption estimation is around 50mW [4]) 
and this energy cannot be reduced for proper nerve fibers

excitation. The total electronic consumption should be 
significantly lower than the electrodes array consumption to 
increase battery lifetime 
 
Figure 2 : Transmitter architecture overview, with signal outputs in color  
 
Ultra low power processors currently available in market 
consume few ÂµW at the 1MHz working frequency [5], [6]. 
Ultra-low-energy biomedical signal processors (BSPs) are 
nowadays being developed with overall energy consumption 
around  100 pJ/cycle with a working frequency of 1MHz (a 
state of the art review can be found in [7]). Therefore more 
constraints in term of power consumption are put in the 
RF/analog electronic devices of the receiver,  which should 
not contain complex blocks for envelop detection. 
Most particularly, a high consumption would lead to an 
increase of the battery reload frequency, which is 
inconvenient for the patients. Because of low power 
constraints, power repartition between blocks becomes 
fundamental. The unique block allowed to consume more 
power was the LNA in order to decrease the total Signal-to-
Noise Ratio (SNR) of the entire receiver as explained in 
Section III. 
As presented in Figure 2, two architectures are 
investigated for the AM demodulation: a power detection 
using a mixer with the RF and LO inputs connected together 
and a coherent demodulation composed of a mixer and a local 
oscillator at the same frequency as the input signal. The 
output signal is a PWM-like waveform and is low-pass 
filtered to recover the initial signal amplitude. Linearity is not 
significant as the PWM signal maximum frequency (around 
2MHz) is substantially lower than the carrier frequency 
(2.45GHz).  
III. 
LNA OPTIMIZATION 
As a direct consequence of the Friss equation [8] 
(reminded in (1)) the Noise Factor of the entire receiver is 
greatly dependent on the LNA Noise Factor and gain. 
Consequently we decided to optimize the LNA design in 
terms of power consumption and noise figure.

Figure 3 shows the schematic of the implemented LNA. The

reduce the Miller effect and, consequently, increase the 
bandwidth. The resonant circuit formed by LL and CL permits 
a high gain with a low voltage supply at the frequency of 
interest. With LG and LS a narrow band input impedance 
matching is obtained. The input transistor (M1) is used in 
inductively degenerated common-source configuration.

RECEIVER ARCHITECTURES IMPLEMENTED
The two architectures presented in Figure 2
implemented in SPICE and they were compared in terms of 
power requirements and noise addition. The LNA and the 
filter were common to both solutions. The polariz
is not shown in the figures. 
A. Solution 1: LNA and Power Detector 
The input signal is the one received by the antenna 
(2.4GHz carrier modulated in amplitude by a PWM signal) 
and the LNA output is connected to the Local 
(LO +) as well as on the RF input of the Mixer. The Power 
Detector is therefore created using a mixer with its inputs 
connected to the same source. We designed a single balanced 
Mixer because of its low power consumption. However
the DC offset is injected directly in the RF source,
the mixer linearity [11], not of importance in our application.

Figure 7: Transient simulation of the mixer output in the second architecture 
 
The width of the NMOS of the differential pair is 210Âµm 
and the length is 150nm, which drives a current of 10mA. 
The Noise Figure of  the cross coupled pair was obtained with 
SPICE simulations and was found equal to 7dB. Then, using 
Periodic Steady-State (PSS) analysis, we estimated the phase 
noise, which was around -120dBc/Hz at 1MHz from the 
carrier (PWM maximal frequency).  
Transient simulation results are presented in Figure 7, where 
one can see that the output voltage magnitude of the mixer is 
much higher than in the previous architecture, at the cost of 
output oscillations due to the frequency shift between LO and 
RF. Indeed this shift is inevitable as low power constraints 
did not allow carrier recovery. Nevertheless, this distortion 
may be removed by subsequent Signal Processing. 
V. 
ARCHITECTURE COMPARISON 
The main requirements of our receiver was its low power 
consumption and a very reduced Noise Figure. Maximizing 
SNR at the receiver output (before DSP computation) is 
hence very relevant and consists on minimizing the total 
Noise Factor of the receiver.

Total Noise Factor computation is expressed by the Friss 
formula  as previously stated in (1). 
The Noise Factors comparison for each solution are shown in 
Table III, as well as their respective Power Consumption 
estimation. 
The solution with VCO is consuming twice as much 
power as  the solution with the Power Detector. This results 
in a total extra energy of about 100mA*h per day (assuming 
that the device is activated during 8 hours per day). 
As discussed in Section II. the increase in power consumption 
of the RF front end represents between 20% to 40% of the 
power consumed by the electrodes array depending on the 
selected topology. 
As stated in Section III.B., the effect of the VCO phase noise 
is not significant compared to the frequency shift associated 
with the absence of carrier recovery in the receiver. This may 
significantly corrupt  the signal rectification as the signal 
translation into lower frequencies is followed by the RC 
filter. 
In consequence, it is authorsâ€™ belief that the first architecture 
should be preferred for this application. Optimization 
algorithms such as NSG2 presented in [12] are available and 
permits optimization of the overall architecture to maximize 
parameters of interest (still under work). 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper presented the study and design of the receiver 
front end architecture for new type of cochlear implants. 
As the LNA block was compulsory in both the solutions 
and significantly impact the overall architecture Noise Figure, 
its optimization using mathematical computation was first 
performed before its implementation in Cadence and 
subsequent refinement. 
 Two receiver architectures were compared in terms of 
power consumption and Noise Figure, both of fundamental 
importance 
in 
biomedical 
embedded 
systems. 
The 
architecture with Power Detector was preferred for our 
application, as it consumed less and did not suffer of 
frequency shift, which could impact the signal demodulation. 
The optimization of the overall LNA and Power detector 
architecture is ongoing, using a nonlinear multi-objective 
optimization, based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) NSGA II. 
This overall optimization may be necessary if the 
measured Noise Power inside the transmission channel would 
be greater that the estimated one, yet very close to the Signal 
Power received by the antenna.
