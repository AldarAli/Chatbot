Abstract— In this paper, an approach to the simulation of 
peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming network is presented. The 
simulation model considers peers’ geolocation and their daily 
activity, time lags between the video server and a peer, lags 
between peers, collisions, and three types of selection 
strategies: neighbor selection strategy, peer selection strategy 
and chunk selection strategy. Geolocation is considered as 
distribution of users by time zones and the users' daily activity 
is defined as the distribution of the number of online users by 
the hour of the day. Initial data for the geolocation of users and 
their daily activity are taken from known Internet sources. The 
aim of this study is to show how the parameters of the 
geolocation and users’ daily activity affect the performance of 
the network. To do this, we compare the download probability 
obtained analytically without geolocation and daily activity 
with the results of simulation. Preliminary numerical analysis 
carried out for the case of the Rarest First chunk selection 
strategy, shows difference in results of up to 30%. 
Keywords—P2P live streaming network; P2P tecnology;

INTRODUCTION 
Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is used by major service 
providers in the market of online TV, such as BBC iPlayer, 
Zattoo, PeerCast, Pulse, QQLive and many others [1][2]. A 
fairly complete overview on P2P technical aspects with an 
extensive list of references was done by Yue et al. [3]. One 
of the main advantages of P2P is high performance-cost 
ratio, that allows commercial companies to minimize the 
costs for technical equipment. Furthermore, P2P technology 
not only enables efficient use of network resources, but also 
reduces the load on the server that is the source of the video 
data. Thus, due to high load balancing, there is no need to 
install additional servers, as well as in the growth of network 
bandwidth to handle a large number of users. Other 
advantages of P2P technology are scalability and high 
network robustness: it gives an opportunity to have a trouble-
free operation of at least one video server to provide services 
for all users at the acceptable level of Quality of Experience 
(QoE). 
However, P2P networks also have disadvantages. The 
main shortcomings include insufficient level of security, 
relatively long start-up latency and data transmission delay, 
inter-peer playback lag, playback discontinuity. While 
information security is not required, the goal is to minimize 
the transmission delay, and hence lack of data on the 
network. To solve the optimization problem for these 
performance measures, mathematical models and simulators 
should be developed. Known mathematical and simulation 
models for streaming P2P-network pay much attention to 
investigation 
of 
the 
buffering 
mechanism 
[11][12][13][14][15][16] and usually take into account lags 
[7][10]. A lag means the delay of data transmission from the 
server to the user, as well as the data transmission delays 
between peers (inter-peer playback lag). These models allow 
to carry out a qualitative analysis of the key performance 
measures of video streaming P2P networks - the probability 
of playback continuity, that is the probability of watching 
video with no pauses, and the probability of chunk 
availability. In previous works [8][9][10] these models 
allowed to formulate and to obtain the solution of the 
optimization problems in a choice of the selection strategies 
[13][14] that are used in a network.  
Each of the models in the aforementioned sources 
reflects one or more features of the analyzed network and 
enables to estimate and optimize the corresponding network 
parameters and strategies. For example, the problem is to 
estimate which chunk selection strategy is better: Rarest 
First, where a peer downloads the rarest chunk in the 
network, or Greedy, where a peer downloads the most 
popular chunk in the network, or Mixed strategy that 
combines these two strategies. Previously, [8][9][10] we 
build a stand-alone analytical model to select the optimal 
strategy. Having analyzed results, we have come to the 
conclusion that the Rarest First strategy is better if we want 
to increase probability of playback continuity, and the 
Greedy chunk selection strategy will most likely be used if 
we want to reduce the startup latency. Finally, it is better to 
use Mixture strategy in real networks, where both quality 
parameters, playback continuity and startup latency, are 
important to the users. Using a particular model, one can 
only examine how the behavior of peers in the network 
influence its target characteristics, but cannot evaluate what 
we get in real life when we measure these characteristics in a 
commercial P2P network. In order to get closer to reality and 
assess the adequacy of the individual models, to give at least 
the recommendations against some of the problems before 
they occur in a real P2P networks, we propose a new model 
that can help to avoid troubleshooting. The presented model 
takes into account the geographical location of each peer,

remoteness of peers from the server and from each other and 
their daily activity. In contrast to recent results (see, i.e. 
[9][10]), in this paper, the problem is solved taking into 
account the distribution of users across time zones. 
Previously, we have studied various models of streaming 
P2P networks that have focused on the study of the optimal 
downloading strategy with the criterion of maximizing the 
probability of playback continuity of the video stream 
[9][10]. Then, the model was modified to take into account 
the users' behavior by introducing the probability of arrival 
of new users, as well as the probability of their leaving the 
network. [10][12]. The negative effect of peers churns on 
playback continuity was observed and investigated. The 
analytical model [8][9] also gives the correct understanding 
of lags' impact on the network performance. Usually, it is 
believed that the lag affects only the shift of the data location 
in the buffers of different users. We have shown that there is 
at least one more important aspect of lags. It is that the 
remote user is unable to receive a chunk within a number of 
time slots and thus play the video stream continuously. Due 
to the problem complexity, each main feature of the P2P 
network was analyzed in the known models separately. In 
this study, we present an approach to simulation that allows 
to combine in a single model the basic aspects of functioning 
of the streaming P2P-networks. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, a 
simulation model of video data distribution in a P2P live 
streaming network with buffering mechanism, geolocation 
and daily peers' activity is proposed. Also, the detailed 
algorithm of chunk exchange between buffers of peers in 
P2P live streaming network is determined and the main 
performance measures are defined. In Section III, the 
numerical analysis and case study is performed. The 
conclusion of this paper is presented in Section IV. 
II. 
SIMULATION MODEL 
In this section, a simulation model of video data 
distribution in a P2P live streaming network with buffering 
mechanism is proposed. A previously developed model [12] 
was improved by taking in consideration buffer selection 
strategies [13][14], peers' geolocation [15] and activity [16]. 
In contrast to the previous model, in this paper, besides 
chunk selection strategy, two more strategies were 
considered - neighbor selection strategy and peer selection 
strategy. The choice of strategies has a significant effect on 
the P2P-network performance measures, including the 
probability of playback continuity; the probability of chunk 
availability; the probability of chunk selection, and also the 
probability of collision – a situation when a peer cannot 
download a chunk because the target peer does not have 
enough capacity for uploading. There are various definitions 
of collision in the P2P network. In the present model, it is 
considered that, in the case of collisions, the peer that 
requested the chunk will not receive it in the current time 
slot. 
We consider the basic model of a P2P network 
with N users and a single server, transmitting only one video 
stream, which we developed in [12]. The process of video 
stream playback is divided into time slots, the length of each 
time slot corresponding to the playback time of one chunk. 
Each user has a buffer designed to accommodate M+1 
chunks, where the buffer positions are numbered from 0 to 
M: 0-position is to store the freshest chunk just received from 
the server, the other m -positions, 
1,...,
1
m
M

 , are to 
store chunks, already received during the past time slots or 
that will be downloaded in the coming time slots. The buffer 
M-position is to store the oldest chunk that will be moved out 
from the buffer for playback during the next time slot. In 
Figure 1, a model of peer’s buffer is illustrated. Thus, a state 
of n-th user is represented in the form of a vector 𝒙(𝑛) =
(𝑥(𝑛, 0), 𝑥(𝑛, 1), . . , 𝑥(𝑛, 𝑀)) where 𝑥(𝑛, 𝑚) = 1 if the n-th 
peer has a chunk at the buffer’s position 𝑚, and 𝑥(𝑛, 𝑚) = 0 
otherwise.  
 
 
Figure 1. Model of n-th peer’s buffer 
 
Initially, a set of original parameters for each of N users 
is determined. They are upload U and download D rates, 
value of a lag LAG, and a set of neighbors B – the users from 
whom downloading is acceptable. A lag is the number of 
time slots between sending and receiving a chunk, thus, lag 
reflects the quantitative characteristics of a chunk delay. The 
algorithm works in such a way that, within a group, the user 
selects a neighbor to download data from using the criterion 
of minimum lag between the neighbors, regardless of their 
time zones distribution. Here is a simple example. Suppose 
that Peer 1 is in Poland and its neighbor, Peer 2, is located in 
Moscow, i.e. they are from different time zones. Suppose 
that Peer 3 is located in Angola, in the same time zone as 
Peer 1, and they are also neighbors. In this example, Peer 1 
selects Peer 2 because they have the smallest lag, although 
Peer 2 is located in a different time zone. The set of 
neighbors for each user is formed according to the neighbor 
selection strategy depending on upload and download rates 
and lags. The neighbor selection is one of the target function 
parameters for optimization problems. 
The algorithm of peers’ actions at each time slot is 
described below according to the protocol of data 
distribution in P2P live streaming networks. 
1) At the beginning of each time slot, the chunk at the 
M-position of the buffer is going to be played if it is 
present. Video data in the buffers shifts one position 
towards the end of the buffer. 0-position is nulled.  
2) The server randomly chooses a peer and loads the 
newest chunk to 0-position of its buffer. 
3) Each peer that was not chosen by the server selects a 
target peer from the set of neighbors to download a 
chunk during the current time slot. Target peer’s 
selection is carried out in accordance to the peer 
selection strategy.

4) If collision takes place, the peer gets nothing during 
the current time slot. Otherwise, it selects a chunk to 
download according to the chunk selection strategy. 
If there is an available chunk to download, the 
loading starts. Otherwise, the peer gets no chunks 
during the current time slot. 
It should be noticed that, in a real network, each peer is 
able to join the video stream and to disjoin it at any time slot 
of modelling and at any step of the algorithm, but we specify 
it by saying that the peers join or disjoin immediately after 
the first step of the algorithm.  
The first difference from the previous model [12] is that 
in the presented model three strategies were considered: 
neighbor selection strategy, peer selection strategy, and 
chunk selection strategy. The second difference is that the 
presented model takes into account peers' geolocation [15] 
and twenty-four hours peers' activity [16].  
The number of peers in the network is not constant. 
Every peer stays online a random amount of time each day, 
with the average value of 0<HO<86 400=24h*60min*60s:  
HoursOnline(n)~P(HO), n=1,…,N. 
Here, 86 400 is the number of time slots when modelling one 
astronomical day with one second as one time slot: 
24h×60min×60s=86 400 time slots. 
Let us introduce the parameter of users' activity, which 
reflects the behavior of peers in the streaming network: 
UserActivity(n)~RAND(1..UA), n=1,…,N; UA>1, 
where UA is the maximal number of peers joining the 
network within a day. 
This parameter shows how often a peer joins the 
network, disjoins from it and switches channels. Here 
𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝑛) = 1 means that within a day 𝑛-th peer 
once came to a network and was online during the random 
time 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛) without switching to other channels. 
𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝑛) = 𝑖, 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑈𝐴, means that the 𝑛-th peer 
joined the network 𝑖  times per day including switching 
channels, and each session lasted exactly 𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛)/
𝑖  time slots. Thus, e.g. if 𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝑛) = 100  and 
𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛) = 15 000 the 𝑛-th peer per day during 
15 000 time slots (seconds) carries out 100 sessions of 150 
time slots each.  
Figure 2 presents the distribution of the number of online 
peers versus the time of the day [15]. Here, the number of 
users of the mobile applications is depicted by the solid line. 
The dashed line represents the number of Internet users 
while the dotted line shows the number of TV watchers. To 
simplify the modeling process in this research, we 
investigate the influence of TV watchers’ behavior only. The 
graph shows that the peak of the online users is between 6 
p.m. and 12 a.m. while the minimum number of TV watchers 
is from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. 
 
 
Figure 2. Distribution of users in the network 
 
In accordance with the distribution in Figure 2, 
parameters 
𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦 = (𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝑛)), 𝑛 =
1, … , 𝑁,
 and 
𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 = (𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛)), 𝑛 =
1, … , 𝑁, correspond to randomly generated intervals when 
peers 
are 
online. 
Let 
𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 = (𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛, 𝑡)), 𝑛 = 1, … , 𝑁;  𝑡 =
1, … , 𝑇, be a binary matrix of the 𝑁 × 𝑇 size, where 𝑇 is the 
number of time slots in the simulation. The matrix indicates 
time slots when peers are online: 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛, 𝑡) = 1 if 
the 𝑛 -th peer at the 𝑡 -th time slot is online, and 
𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛, 𝑡) = 0 
otherwise. 
Thus, 
if 
𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛, 𝑡) = 1 and 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛, 𝑡 + 1) = 0 , 
then the 𝑛-th peer left the network at the (𝑡 + 1)-th time slot, 
and 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛, 𝑡) = 0 and 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑂𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑛, 𝑡 + 1) = 1 
say that the 𝑛-th peer joined the network at the (𝑡 + 1) − 𝑡ℎ 
time slot. 
Peers churns significantly influence the key performance 
measures. So, when a new peer joins the network it still has 
no data for exchange with other peers, but it uses other peers’ 
resources to download content. Similarly, when a peer 
disjoins the network, it stops to participate in distribution of 
already downloaded video chunks. For a proper peers churns 
simulation, it is important to take into account the 
distribution of users by time zones. In this paper, the total of 
N peers in the network are divided in a random way across 
time zones according to the distribution shown in Figure 3 
[16]. One can see that the majority of the users is located in -
5, +1, and +8 time zones, which include the USA, Canada, 
Europe, and China - the most populated and technologically 
developed regions. In the model, splitting peers across time 
zones allows to reduce the probability of the global splashes 
corresponding to mass connections and disconnections of 
users.

III.NUMERICAL ANALYSIS 
In this paper, the aim of numerical analysis is to compare 
results of the models that do not consider distribution of 
users across time zones (we call it the basic model, 
[8][9][10]) to the results which are obtained by means of the 
model described above. We analyzed the network with 
𝑁 = 300 users and the size of the users’ buffer 𝑀 = 40. The 
time of modeling is 𝑇 = 1 000 000 time slots, which 
corresponds to about 12 days. The basic model assumes 
values of lags equal to 0, 10, 20 between groups of 
neighbors. The Rarest First (RF) has been chosen as a chunk 
selection strategy, and neighbors, as well as the target user, 
were selected randomly. 
As seen in Figures 4 and 5, the results of the simulation 
with splitting users across time zones (dashed line) 
qualitatively repeat the results of the basic model. The nature 
of the behavior of curves, including flexes in points of 
𝑚 = 10 and 𝑚 = 20 is described in [9][10]. The probability 
of playback continuity for the model with time zones is 
much lower because the delivery of chunks takes, on 
average, more than one time slot. Note that, in Figure 4, 
value p(40) corresponds to the probability of playback 
continuity. Numerical analysis shows that the basic model 
gives a very rough upper bound of the performance measures 
compared to the model with splitting users across time 
zones. On the other hand, the simulation model shows 
unsatisfactory (less than 70%) value of the probability of 
playback continuity. This means that it is necessary to use 
some other combinations of selection strategies, which will 
be the subject of further study. It is also necessary to explore 
a new way of peer's communication to improve the playback 
continuity, which is a key performance of the network. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
We try to construct a model of a P2P streaming network, 
which is the most approximate to the reality. Preliminary 
numerical analysis showed that more research is necessary to 
find the optimal strategies; buyout will improve the quality 
of service parameters of streaming P2P-network. To do this, 
it is necessary to formulate the appropriate optimization 
problems, to find ways to solve them, even if numerical, and 
conduct computer experiments using the simulator described 
above. It is already clear that it is necessary to modify the 
strategies used in streaming P2P-network.
