Abstract – SincN finite impulse response (FIR) filters are built 
as a cascade of N sinc filters, each of length M. They are used 
for digital signal processing applications, in various areas 
including telecommunications. Generating functions for the 
sincN FIR filters transfer functions are given. It is shown that 
z-Transform techniques can offer an efficient method to 
derive 
straightforward 
recurrence 
relations 
for 
fast 
computation of the impulse response. Moreover, a simple  
expression, valid for all the filter coefficients, is also obtained. 
It is new and general, compared to previously published 
formula. 
 
Keywords – digital filter ; impulse response ; coefficient 
computation ; z-Transform. 
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Different structures for digital filters have been proposed 
for applications as decimation, interpolation or noise 
suppression in Sigma-Delta A/D conversion [1, 2]. As 
suitable filters for high speed operation, cascaded-
integrator-comb (CIC) filters [1] and sincN impulse finite 
response (FIR) filters [3, 4] are among the well known 
solutions. The use of sincN filters constituted of a cascade of 
N sinc filters, each of length M, requires the calculation of 
all of the impulse response coefficients. So adequate 
recursions or expressions for rapid calculation of these 
coefficients 
have 
been 
the 
subject 
of 
numerous 
investigations, as in [5-7]. Interesting computation aids 
have already been published: a closed form expression for 
the first M coefficients has been given in [6], while a 
recurrence formula has been presented in [7]. 
It has been proved that using z-Transform techniques can 
be an efficient method to derive digital filter coefficients [8, 
9]. Here, employing these techniques, new results are 
obtained. Simple effective recurrence relations are derived 
for the computation of the coefficients of sincN FIR filters. 
In addition, a simple expression is deduced, which is valid 
not only for the first coefficients of the impulse response 
but for all of them. In addition, generating functions for the 
transfer functions of sincN FIR filters are presented. 
In this paper, the general form of the transfer function of 
the sincN FIR filters is given in section II, as well as its 
useful basic properties. In section III, it is shown how 
recurrence relations for the filter coefficients can be derived 
using z-Transform techniques applied to the expression of 
the transfer function considered as a z-transform. Similarly, 
the way to obtain an expression for the filter coefficients, 
new and general compared to formula previously published 
by other authors, is described in section IV. Finally, in 
section V, forms of generating functions for the transfer 
functions of sincN FIR filters are expressed.

III. RECURRENCE RELATIONS FOR THE FILTER 
COEFFICIENTS 
In this section, several relations are derived, according 
to different criteria such as simplicity, low order, varying 
index. Each of these independent relations can be useful, 
depending on the way chosen for computation, and 
implemented separately.

An advantage of (8) is the fact that M and N keep 
constant values. Relative drawbacks are that the number of 
terms is not the lowest possible and that shifts in j indexes 
increase with M and may be large. This recurrence relation 
is the same as (11) in [7], but here it has been 
straightforwardly derived using z-Transform techniques. 
For example, for M=8, N=4 and j=9, the relation gives:

Advantages of (11) are a very low number of terms, the 
fact that M keeps a constant value and that shifts in N and j 
indexes equal only one and occur separately. This new and 
simple relation allows a fast recursive calculation of the 
impulse response coefficients. Therefrom, computation is 
quite easy, even permitting to fill up the start of the table of 
filter coefficients simply by hand. 
For example, for M=8, N=4 and j=9, the relation gives:

An advantage of (16) is the fact that M-1 keeps constant 
in the right side of the equation. Drawbacks are that the 
number of terms, the number of sets of coefficients 
involved in the relation, as well as shifts in j index increase 
with N.

In this section, using z-Transform techniques, efficient 
recursive formulae for computing the impulse response 
coefficients 
,
g jM N
 of sincN filters have been derived, 
especially (11) and (13). The values of the coefficients 
,
g jM N
, for M ≤ 8 and N ≤ 4, are given in Table I. For 
symmetry 
reasons,

Futher investigations should be undertaken in order to 
evaluate precisely the number of operations and the 
computation time when using such or such recurrence 
relation or a combination of them, and, in a way, the more 
efficient strategy.

with j=0..N(M-1), and where [j/M] denotes the integer 
quotient of j and M. 
It is worth noting that this new expression of the 
coefficients 
,
gjM N
 applies for all values of M, N and j. 
This simple formula allows to calculate any coefficient 
numerically. It offers the obvious advantage, compared to 
previous results, to be general and valid for all the 
coefficients of the impulse response of the sincN filters. In 
fact, in [6] (cf. (19)) and in [7] (cf. (12) and (13)), explicit 
expressions are given only for the very first coefficients of 
the impulse response of the sincN filters. Note that here (23) 
leads immediately to these explicit expressions for j=0..(M-
1) and for j=M, with k=0 and k=1 respectively. 
For example, for M=8, N=4 and j=9 ([j/M]=1), 
,
g jM N

VI. CONCLUSION 
SincN filters, constituted of a cascade of N sinc filters, 
each of length M, are useful for digital signal processing 
applications, 
in 
various 
domains 
including 
telecommunications. In this paper, z-Transform has been 
used as an efficient tool for deriving various formulae 
allowing to compute the impulse response coefficients of 
sincN FIR filters. 
In particular, straightforward recursive relations have 
been demonstrated. Further investigations should be made 
to evaluate the computation time and the more efficient 
strategy when exploiting these relations separately or in 
combination. 
Moreover, a simple general expression – new compared 
to previous published formula – has been given, valid for 
all the coefficients, whatever their rank j and the values of 
M and N. 
In addition, generating functions for the sincN FIR filters 
transfer functions have been given.
