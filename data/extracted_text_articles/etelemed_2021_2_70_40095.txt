Abstract—The use of augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR)
has recently been increased in various people’s work and life.
The combination of technology with digital games have recently
received much attention. The 2020 Augmented and Virtual Real-
ity Survey Results report by Perkins Coie, XR Association, and
Boost VC, pointed out that immersive techniques are leaving from
laboratory research and theoretical applications and growing up
as fully mature and income-generating marketplaces. Except for
games and entertainment, the most common area reported was
healthcare and medical devices from immersive technologies,
followed by education. The survey presented in this paper
explores the usage, perceived beneﬁts and problems of AR/VR
games for mental or physical health. It also highlights future
features that users would see as relevant in these applications.
Through an online questionnaire, we found examples of used
AR/VR games and their usage frequency, the user’s perception
of their mental or physical health beneﬁts and problems, and
the prospects to physical and mental health for AR/VR games.
This study is helpful for researchers and developers both in
computer science and medical science. It provides people with
examples of existing consumer-level products, their advantages
and disadvantages, and AR/VR games’ requirements relevant to
mental and physical health. In future work, the survey sample
size would be extended to collect additional user experience data
and further explore the challenges and opportunities of such
techniques for public health.
Index Terms—Virtual reality, augmented reality, public health,
games, survey
I. INTRODUCTION
With the increased development of AR/VR of technologies,
as shown in Fig 1, more research focuses on applications of the
techniques and their evaluation. There is an increasing amount
of consumer-level applications entering the lives of the public.
Among them, AR/VR games have received much attention.
Such games can provide fun and interest and bring a rich
experience including serious objectives [1], such as beneﬁts
for users’ mental and physical health.
A. Aim and Research Questions
From the perspective of the applied and evaluated tech-
niques, this study explores the usage situation of AR/VR,
thereby ﬁnding further challenges and opportunities and ideas
for future studies. Thus, the main research objectives of this
article are to explore the usage of the AR/VR games while
bringing entertainment effects, what impact do these games
have on the public’s physical and mental health; and how
the public’s future expectations of AR/VR games could affect
their physical and mental health. To address the aim, this
study conducted an online questionnaire for the public to ﬁnd
potential perceived beneﬁts and problems of VR/AR games
for mental and physical health. The usage data regarding how
often the AR/VR technology was used in addition to what
game applications were tested were gathered from volunteers.
The participants were also asked to imagine future features
that these applications could incorporate. As such, the main
research questions were as follows:
• RQ1: What is the usage experience of VR/AR games of
the public?
• RQ2: What are the publics’ perceived beneﬁts and prob-
lems of VR/AR games for mental and physical health?
• RQ3: What features would the public like to see in future
VR/AR games for mental and physical health?
B. Background
The following paragraphs present the deﬁnitions and rele-
vant concepts of a game and AR/VR. Game is a rule-based
system with variable and quantiﬁable outcome based on the
assigned different values [1]. The game result relies on the
players’ effort [1] and the degree of understanding of the rules.
A game can improve motivation and engagement for special
purposes [2], not only for fun and entertainment but also for
serious objectives [1].
As shown in Fig 2, mixed reality (MR) covers the whole
range from the real world to the virtual environment, AR
and augmented virtuality (AV) is the continuum between the
natural world and the virtual world, where AR is closer to
reality. Like a bridge from real to virtual, AR merges the
physical and digital worlds, which is a three-dimensional
technique, adds or removes computer-generated digital objects
in the real world [3], thereby improving the sensory perception
of the real environment by the content layer of information [4].

Fig. 1. An example of AR/VR techniques.
AR is not limited to a particular display technique nor
the sight sense [4]. AR could operate on three main dis-
plays: head-mounted displays (HMD), handheld displays, and
spatial displays, such as Microsoft Hololens, Google Glass;
smartphone, tablet PC; and spatial augmented reality (SAR)
by using video-projectors [5]. AR could also apply to all
senses (including smell, touch, and hearing), such as sensory
substitution application, which substitutes or augment missing
senses for users. For example, AR could help blind and
visually impaired users through audio cues and help deaf
users through visual cues [6]. The AR technique is based on
having support for three aspects: real objects tracking tools,
information processing hardware and software, and display
devices [3], [6].
In Milgram’s continuum of real-to-virtual environments
statement, as shown in Fig 2 [7], VR is the other end of
the coordinate axis relative to the real world. VR was ﬁrst
introduced in the 1960s, which was described as a window,
in which users could perceive and interact with a virtual
world from the window as if looking, feeling, and sounding
real world [8]. The deﬁnition of VR is varying, such as an
immersion display technique with 3D models, which allow
users to real-time interact with the models [9]; an advanced
digital human-machine interface in virtual worlds [10]; a 3D
immersive environment created by a computer [11], or to sim-
ulate physical presence and sense in a virtual environment to
reproduce users’ sensory experiences [12]. Overall, three main
aspects are key here: immersion, interaction, and perception.
Based on the level of immersion, VR could be classiﬁed as
non-immersive, semi-immersive, and immersive [13]. Differ-
ent displays can be used to achieve different levels of immer-
sion. The most immersive, such as VR glasses, HMDs, and
CAVE, provide a completely immersive simulation experience
for the VR applications. Equipment such as desktop, laptop,
TV, or large screen supply the cheapest and simplest VR to
recreate the real world. A semi-immersive VR is between the
two above, which produce a 3D scene viewed on display using
a perspective projection coupled to the head position of users,
such as Fish Tank VR [13].
Moreover, the perception of VR also rely on audiovisual
stimuli as a type of interaction, but some studies reported
applications of multisensory VR systems, such as haptics
(simple vibration, thermal, tactile, or kinesthetic), smell, and
taste [14]. Furthermore, except for those mentioned above,
which are relevant to output, the VR interaction also includes
input devices. These range from keyboard, mouse, trackball,
and joystick for lower immersive VR, to tracking devices for
higher immersive VR, such as bend-sensing gloves (tracking
hand movements/postures/gestures), pinch gloves (tracking the
ﬁngers movements), and users’ physical movements track-
ers [13].
C. Related Work
Perkins Coie LLP, XR Association, and Boost VC con-
ducted the fourth annual Augmented and Virtual Reality
Survey Results report in early 2020 by 191 professionals [15].
Their report reviewed the development of the AR/VR industry
in the past year and looked forward to its future. They
pointed out that their interviewees represent strong optimism
for the continued growth of immersive games and broader
applications in other areas, such as healthcare, education,
telecommunication, manufacturing, retail, and disaster pre-
paredness. Among them, speciﬁcally, healthcare obtained more
attention. They expected the healthcare industry in AR/VR
would reach about 11 billion dollars by 2025. They also
said more and more immersive technology applications were
being recognised, such as simulated surgical training, re-
mote diagnosis, pain management, palliative hospice care, and
molecular level 3D visualisation of diseases. In other various
industries, respondents also expected immersive techniques to
improve operations and outcomes and enhance efﬁciencies.
For example, such training for global staff could allow less
cost for travel and lodging, as well as medical education and
training with more opportunities for practice repetitions. The
report claimed that immersive techniques appear to become
a more signiﬁcant part of people’s daily lives worldwide. In
addition, over 75% of the respondents expect that the total
revenue of the AR market will eventually surpass that of VR
due to the ubiquity of mobile devices that make it easier
to use AR applications. On the other hand, the most need
for improvement, which will impact users adoption of such
techniques, is the continued upgrades of the device. Among
them, 42% of the interviewees believed devices should be
smaller and sleek, followed by 39% of participants’ more
comfortable [15].
There has also been a previous online survey in 2020
focusing on the possibilities and challenges with AR/VR/MR
and gamiﬁcation usage in healthcare [16]. Unlike the target
participants and research aim of this study, in the previous
work, we paid more attention to the staff, researchers, and
students in the healthcare-relevant organizations, to discover
the state-of-art of AR/VR/MR game applications/software in
their working/studying. Based on 30 participants’ answering,
we explored the actual used digital games and AR/VR/MR
applications applied in healthcare. This previous work col-
lected the applications’ general information (including name
or feature, application purpose, target user, and use occasion),
usage situation (covering use time and use frequency), user
experience (advantages and disadvantages), obstacles to mass

adoption for such techniques, and its future requirements and
concerns.
In their answers, 15 software/applications were found.
Five were AR/VR/MR games, the other ﬁve only involved
AR/VR/MR techniques without any game element, and the
remaining ﬁve were games without AR/VR/MR techniques.
From the application purpose view, AR/VR/MR techniques
were mainly applied to medical education and training (such
as simulation CPR, model operation, 3D body map, virtual
surgery, and X-ray imaging training) and mental health (such
as stress management, anxiety relief, and for autism treatment).
For the usage frequency view, only two participants mentioned
it. One of them used a VR game (Deep) ﬁve hours per week.
Moreover, interviewees claimed the advantages of the game
in healthcare were in line with cognition and acceptance of
children and stronger motivation than non-game activities.
The reported problems were that of the high cost of software
and hardware, the potential for being addictive, and not ap-
propriately applied. Furthermore, the beneﬁts of AR/VR/MR
techniques in healthcare were the ability to change the set-
ting for the patients/students (simulation CPR), intuitiveness,
straightforward and easier to perceive (3D body map), more
precise and valuable for the operation and better result (model
operation), safe and allowed repetition (virtual surgery, X-
ray imaging training), and better game experience (Deep). On
the other hands, the disadvantages of AR/VR/MR were high
cost and low quality in presentation. In addition, the inter-
viewees mentioned ﬁve additional organisation requirements
for AR/VR/MR games, such as rehabilitation, psychological
and mental treatment, psychological diagnosis or psychother-
apy, baby’ taking care skills training, and games for elderly
health. There were two more requirements mentioned for the
AR/VR/MR techniques, being teaching and muscle relaxation.
Furthermore, there was a previous survey of AR/VR/MR
technologies targeting another ﬁeld, such as using the VR
technique in higher education. From Cicek et al. work, we
could see most of the interviewees (46/55, 84%) had experi-
ence with VR applications, 25 of them had such applications at
home [17]. To compare a 2D display with HMD, they created
several questions about the sense of the passage of time,
immersion in the virtual world, and the opinions on the VR
techniques. From their result, 77% thought VR systems could
provide more information, 96% believed the visual stimuli of
the VR applications was fascinating, and 60% claimed using
the VR system would bring them to feel present in a virtual
environment [17].

The rest of this paper organised as follow. Section II ex-
plains the research method, covering the research ethics, ques-
tionnaire design, procedure, participants, and analysis meth-
ods. Next, Section III presents the result based on 74 individual
questionnaire answers, including the AR/VR games usage
situation, beneﬁts and problems of such games for mental and
physical health, and the future features expectation of AR/VR
games for mental and physical health. Section IV compares
the outcomes with relevant previous work and explores the
possible reasons behind the results. Finally, Section ?? gives
a summary of the research and highlight its contribution and
future work.
II. METHOD
This section presents the research method, including rele-
vant aspects regarding research ethics, questionnaire design,
structure and logic description, pilot study, procedure, partic-
ipants and analysis methods.
A. Research Ethics and Questionnaire Design
Based on the General Data Protection Regulation [18] and
Singer and Vinson’s guidelines for practical ethics [19], we
generated a research ethics explanation for the study, which
was included as part of the informed consent form shown
before the beginning of the online questionnaire. It also
highlighted that no sensitive data was collected, there was no
link to any person, as well as all data were conﬁdential.
As shown in Fig 3, the questionnaire has three sections
with 60 questions. Except for the Q1 and Q2, which are the
consent form question and age group evaluation, the other 58
questions could be organised into two parts: (1) the usage of
VR games and (2) the usage of AR games. To answer RQ1,
each part included questions about VR/AR usage (Q3/Q32),
use frequency (Q4/Q33), and application name (Q5/Q34). To
answer RQ2, the questions (Q6/Q35) explored beneﬁts for
mental health and (Q7/Q36) beneﬁts for physical health. To
further address RQ2, the questions also mentioned VR/AR
games advantages (Q8/Q37), and problems (Q9/Q38). More-
over, questions (Q31/Q60) were created for exploring RQ3
and imagined future features of VR/AR games for mental or
physical health. Apart from Q31 and Q60, the other questions
in each part were repeated three times (Q10-Q16, Q17-23,
Q24-Q30, Q39-Q45, Q46-Q52, Q53-Q59) to deal with the
participants who reported more than one VR/AR game user
experience. If they did not have any more experience, they
could directly skip the repeated questions. The mandatory
questions were marked with a star.

The questionnaire were designed with single choice ques-
tions, 7-Likert scales, and open questions. For the ﬁrst two,
we quantiﬁed the options for descriptive statistics and statis-
tical analysis. For the latter, we extracted and analyzed the
high-frequency key words in the answers. Before the formal
document survey, the researcher conducted a pilot study to test
the usability of the questionnaire and its provided link.
Fig. 3. The questionnaire structure and logic.
B. Procedure and Participants
The questionnaire was created in Microsoft Forms and
spread by social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and
WeChat). By mid-April (2021-04-15), there were 76 answers.
Two declined to join this survey resulting in 74 effective
obtained replies. The following analysis is based on the
74 answers. The age group of the participants was mainly
concentrated within the range 25-30 years old (52), followed
by the age group 18-24 (17). Four participants came from the
age group 35-44, and only one from the 45-55 age group.
III. RESULTS
To answer the three RQs, this section organises and analyses
the results in four subsections: the AR/VR games usage situa-
tion (III-A), perceived beneﬁts (III-B) and problems (III-C) for
mental and physical health, and the future imagined features
of AR/VR games for mental and physical health (III-D).

A. Usage Situation
Table I shows the number of ”Yes” answers from Q3/Q32
(Do you have experience with VR/AR game applications?) and
their three repeated questions (Q10/Q39, Q17/Q46, Q24/Q53).
It can be seen that from the possible four times data could be
collected, the VR technique (50 person-times in total answered
yes) had been more used than the AR technique (25 person-
times in total answered yes) out of the 74 volunteers of the
questionnaire.
1) Application Purpose: From the positive answers, there
were 23 applications mentioned. Among them, 17 were VR
games, and the others were games with AR techniques. Based
on the game genres, the 24 games could be grouped into
eight types. As shown in Table III, the VR shooter game and
AR adventure game were the most used game genres. VR
shooter games (6) was also the genre with the most number
of games mentioned in this survey, followed by VR adventure
games (4) and simulation games (4). Only one game was
mentioned in the AR adventure game category. However, this
game was mentioned by ten of the participants. This outcome
is quite natural since the game Pok´emon Go previously has
been reported as one of the most popular games with health
beneﬁts [20], [21]. Pok´emon Go has also previously been
evaluated in terms of physical and psychological beneﬁts for
dog owners [22].
2) Use Frequency: Although more than half of interviewees
have VR/AR game experience, the use frequency of most
games was lower than once per week. As shown in Table II,
only six people mentioned they play the VR/AR games more
than three times per week and the other six people 2-3 times
per week.
B. Perceived Beneﬁts of AR/VR Games to Health
Even little play still provides the user experience on health
beneﬁts. Fig 4 shows the statistics of the mentioned games’
beneﬁts on mental and physical health. Horizontal comparison,
most of them believed the AR games beneﬁt their mental
(18/25, 72%) or physical (19/25, 76%) health. However, the
percentages for VR games were lower. Twenty-nine person-
times thought that the VR games had beneﬁts for their mental
health (29/50, 58%), and twenty-four person-times reported
supported beneﬁts for physical health (24/50, 48%). Vertical
comparison, more than twice as person-times who disagree,
there was 90 person-times thought that AR/VR games were
good for physical and mental health. Among them, there
were four more person-times (47 vs 43) who believed AR/VR
games were beneﬁcial to their mental health than their physical
health.

Before the formal data analysis of whether the mentioned
games beneﬁt mental and physical health, we explored the
reliability and validity of the scales, by a Cronbach’s Alpha
(CA) test and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) through
SPSS [23]. The answers were transformed to numbers in the
statistical analysis (strongly disagree 1, disagree 2, somewhat
disagree 3, neither agree or disagree 4, somewhat agree 5,
agree 6, strongly agree 7).
Due to that the CA results were over 0.6 (AR: 0.710,
VR: 0.606), we could say our scales have internal reliability.
Moreover, based on the result of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
measure (KMO) and Bartlett’s test, in which the KMO of
Sampling Adequacy was greater than or equal to .50 (AR:
0.50, VR: 0.50), and the signiﬁcance value less than 0.05
(AR: 0.002, VR: 0.004), thereby we could say our data was
suitable for the EFA [24]–[26]. From the results of the EFA;
the Total Variance Explained results shown the cumulative
variance contribution rate of the four questions (VR-M/AR-M:
questions of whether VR/AR games beneﬁt mental health, VR-
P/AR-P: questions of whether VR/AR games beneﬁt physical
health) divided into two dimensions (AR-M/AR-P and VR-
M/VR-P) was 78.18. Due to the value being over 60, which
means the classiﬁcation is suitable [26]. In addition, the results
of the Rotated Component Matrix shows that each question
only has one contribution value to these two dimensions,
which proves that they contributed to the scale separately and
cannot be deleted.
We ﬁrst conducted the normal distribution test to select the
statistical method for the difference relationship analysis. The
data of the VR-M, VR-P, AR-M, AR-P answers and the total
combined attitude of VR-C (for mental and physical together)
was in line with the normal distribution, but the total attitude
of AR-C (for mental and physical together) was not. Thus,
to compare data groups with equal sample size and normal
distribution (such as VR-M/VR-P, and AR-M/AR-P), we used
the paired T-test (parametric test). However, for the analysis
of the data group that had different sample size or not in the
normal distribution (such as VR-M/AR-M, VR-P/AR-P, and
VR-C/AR-C), we used the Wilcoxon test (non-parametric test).
For the two rounds of paired T-tests, the Sig. values were
over 0.05 (VR-M/VR-P: 1, AR-M/AR-P: 1). Thus, the dif-
ference in the answer of VR-M and VR-P, as well as AR-M
and AR-P, were not statistically signiﬁcant. Thereby, we could
say, facing the technology, AR or VR, the interviewees have
similar attitude towards them whether beneﬁts their physical
and mental health. Moreover, for the three rounds of Wilcoxon
test, the Sig. values were less than 0.05 (VR-M/AR-M: 0.017,
VR-P/AR-P: 0.027, VR-C/AR-C: 0.018). Thus, the difference
in the answers of VR-M/AR-M, VR-P/AR-P, and VR-C/AR-
C was statistically signiﬁcant. Based on the result, we could
say, facing different health needs, physical or mental or both,
the participants’ attitudes towards different technologies were
perceived different.
From the result of advantages in VR games, the participants
mentioned some high-frequency keywords, such as immersive,
fun (happy), relax (release), and real (realistic, realism). From
the above keywords, the interviewees began to describe the
user experience of VR games as a more stimulating environ-
ment, more interesting, reducing pressure, and pushing the
attention only to the game. They also said VR games gave
them a new and improved game experience to enjoy and
discover a new place they never been to before. VR games
could reduce the limitations of entertainment and the real
danger of experience in a danger-like situation. Moreover,
some participants believed that VR games could provide
an online social community, making them feel less lonely.
Furthermore, ”exercise” and related words were said several
times. Someone speciﬁcally claimed that VR games could
motivate more exercise. Another pointed out that the VR game
help to strengthen his/her body. Furthermore, the VR game
can beneﬁt reaction practice. Last but not least, a participant
mentioned that the VR game could provide great visual effects.
For AR games, the most perceived advantages were around
motivating the players to go outdoors, which is beneﬁcial
to their bodies and to see the outdoor environment, thereby
enhancing mental and physical health. Moreover, some inter-
viewees said, AR games do not need additional equipment and
that it is easy to use. Furthermore, AR games were reported
more novel and immersive compared to traditional games.
Other participants pointed out that they could bring a good
visual experience, interest, and happiness to the users.
C. Perceived Problems of AR/VR Games to Health
On the other hand, the disadvantages of VR games were
mainly focused on the physical discomfort and risks with
equipment. Many participants pointed out the dizziness and
motion sickness problem caused by 3D vertigo. Another
remark concerned negative impacts on the eyes. Some in-
terviewees believed VR games were not good for the eyes.
Except for the tired and uncomfortable eyes, they claimed that
playing VR games for a long time could easier cause eyestrain
and deepen myopia. Someone also mentioned being dazzled
when he/she used the VR game. Moreover, the physical
discomfort and risk also included neck pain and risk of falling.
Furthermore, some interviewees said that when playing VR
games, the player or the surrounding environment were at risk
of injury or damage.
Another main problem came from the device. A participant
mentioned the high cost of software and equipment. Some
others pointed to that devices are too heavy, and this being
the main problem affecting the user experience. Furthermore,
due to the device, playing VR games was not easy at home. It
needs enough space to layout equipment and play, which lim-
ited the playing environment. The cable impacted movement
and easiness to twist and wind when playing the VR games as
well. Moreover, some answers showed a negative impression
on imaging. Someone claimed the VR device was not mature
enough, and the imaging had bad details.
In addition to the above main issues, the respondents’
negative impression of VR games lied in their impact on the
real world. Some interviewees said that after a long time of
playing, the VR game impacted the feeling of the true world,

eTELEMED 2021 : The Thirteenth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine

more than this, the inﬂuence also on the distinction between
the real world and the virtual world. Besides, VR games were
also reported to have similar problems as other games, such
as addiction, wasting time, and reducing communication with
friends face to face.
The AR games have reported usage problems as well. The
same as for VR and other games, addiction was mentioned
by some interviewees. Some participants compared the user
experience of AR games with VR games. They said AR games
were not as fun as VR games and could not make them
immersed due to that the design is not so real. Moreover,
they also claimed device problems, such as networking prob-
lems, the high challenge of their cellphone battery, and the
limitation of the screens. Except for the above comments,
the risk of trafﬁc accidents was pointed out several times.
Some respondents said that when playing AR games, they
may ignore their surrounding environment. Furthermore, there
was one interviewee who reported the AR technique to be
seriously abused.
D. Proposed Future Features of AR/VR Games for Health
Some participants mentioned the sci-ﬁ movie ”Ready Player
One”. Adapted from the novel of the same name, it depicted
much imagination about VR and reality. The interviewees
imagined living realistically in the VR world like the movie’s
description. It imagined a high mix between the VR world
and the real world, blurring the boundaries between realism
in a virtual world and the virtual in the real world. The
respondents’ positive attitudes towards VR technology and
demand for the realism of virtual objects are shown here.
It is also reﬂected in keywords that appear in the answers
many times, such as ”pleasure”, ”enjoyment”, ”immersive”,
”simulation”, and ”real (realistic)”. The interviewees also de-
scribed their requirements and expectations of VR techniques
and VR games into two main aspects: user experience and
content offerings.
The most mentioned comments were about multi-senses,
multi-user interaction, unlimited location of use, wireless,
naked eyes VR from the user experience point of view. Several
participants claimed they want future VR games to perceive
senses, including gustatory, tactile, and olfactory, as the new
interaction brings a more realistic and immersive experience.
In addition, interaction with other players was also pointed
out as important. Interviewees wanted to see and collaborate
with other users. Furthermore, a VR should be possible to
play without speciﬁc physical demands on the location. Some
answers showed that the participants need to use it in a wide
barrier-free venue, playing at home and without going outside.
Except for the above, the expectations of VR games were
to be more portable, easy to apply and to be cheaper. Users
complained that helmet glasses are too heavy and that there is
limited activity when having cables to consider. Wireless VR
and naked eyes VR were mentioned several times. Moreover,
someone also pointed out to have body control and not just
the controllers using the hands.
From the content offerings point of view, many interviewees
mentioned the VR games’ application purposes in healthcare.
As an aim for mental and psychological health, they pointed
out that VR games could be applied for mental training,
mental treatment, and psychological counselling. Especially
for diseases and problems such as social barriers, autism,
and Alzheimer. In addition, they claimed VR games could
help to release pressure and promote or improve sleep. Facing
physical health, participants mentioned that VR games could
be used as a training and treatment method. Some of them
believed it might help disabled people and expected it to
recover muscle activation. Furthermore, several participants
hoped VR games could support extreme games, sport and
exercise, such as skydiving, VR gyms, live football games, and
other interactive exercises. Except for directly health-relevant
purposes, respondents mentioned aims of VR games’ appli-
cations to be for education and learning (such as emergency
handling for children), training (in schools, construction sites,
and ofﬁce buildings), team building, travel and tours, scene and
memory reappearance, virtual meetings, record and observe,
and for religious activities.
In addition to the purpose of the application, the answers
also described the expectations for the functions and features.
Some interviewees imagined VR games with biofeedback,
such as perceiving individual moods or emotions and rec-
ommended games suitable for the current mood. These were
reported to use, for example, advanced chips that could con-
nect to the human brain, monitoring of heart rate detection,
pulse detection, and other physical indicators. Moreover, when
playing VR games, participants wished to break the sitting or
standing playing mode and being able to run and exercise, and
provide the leg movement system, in-situ movement. Further-
more, more freedom and interaction and less distance between
non-player characters (NPCs) in video games and players
were also pointed out for an improved experience. However,
negative opinions could also be found in the answers, which
involved addiction and harm to the eyes as other types of
digital games. In addition, someone said VR is not a very
mature technique.
As the expectations of VR games, the participants described
their vision of the future for AR games in healthcare and
their potential application purposes and features. Except for the
requirements of training and treatment for mental and physical
health, such as depression, stress relief, sitting a long time, eye
protection, and ﬁtness/sport/exercise, they also mentioned that
AR games could help education and communication in health
and telemedicine (remote surgery). For example, someone said
AR games might be used to introduce the human body, how it
works, what conditions can cause injuries, and learn things
about healthcare. Furthermore, it might also help to study
human anatomy. The 3D structure of the human body could
be generated by an AR game based on computed tomography
(CT) scan or other tools. Moreover, doctors and patients could
use AR games to better communicate, such as for therapies,
pills, and symptoms. In addition, there were also some men-
tioned application purposes not directly relevant to healthcare,
56

such as online shopping, virtual meetings, navigation and
map exploration, movies, record and observe, product design,
travelling, learning and improving knowledge and skills, and
experiencing different life types.
About AR functions/features and devices, the results are
also similar to VR games. Interviewees said light AR glasses
might attract players more. They also pointed out that if an
AR game was more open and free, with better realism and
immersion, the interaction and connection with the real world
would be improved. Moreover, a better sensory experience
with tactile feedback was also required. On the other hand,
participants also held negative opinions on the use of AR
games in health. One of them reported that AR could not
be used in any healthcare project. Some others mentioned
problems of violence and that violent games being too real
could potentially increase the player’s violent tendency and
make it harder to distinguish between the virtual and real
world. One interviewee said it is necessary to protect teenagers
from such problems. Another person complained that AR
games were not vivid enough.
IV. DISCUSSION
It is noticed that all participants were in the age range 18-
55, and most of them were under 30 years old. Although
the adoption of smartphones, the Internet, and social media
has risen amongst seniors over the last 15 years, it is still
relatively low compared to young people. A 2017 survey in
the United States [27] showed that 40% of senior citizens
now own a smartphone. Even this number was more than
double the amount in 2013, but still much lower than the
smartphone ownership rate of young people. Moreover, the
separate Internet and broadband use were different in various
demographic groups. The report pointed out it was impacted
by educational attainment and family income. Compared with
households with an annual income of $75,000, the Internet
usage rate of the elderly in households with an annual income
of less than $30,000 has dropped by nearly 50% 94% vs 46%.
Compared with those with a college degree or below, more
college graduates use the Internet (92% vs 49%). Furthermore,
the report also claimed 34% of elderly who are over 65 uses
social media such as Facebook or Twitter. Even though the
number was 6% higher than in 2013, it is signiﬁcantly smaller
than the general population. The majority of the elderly did
not use social networking, and the younger elderly more
possible use social media than the elderly. The lower use
rates of the smartphone, the Internet, and social media of the
elderly was both the limitation of the research method (online
questionnaire spread by social media) and the challenges of
AR/VR techniques. Due to an increase in elderly users of
the technology, the positive view for the future could allow
a growth in opportunities for this age group as well. Based on
these results the authors also think it would be relevant in the
future to ﬁnd novel AR/VR game solutions, for mental and
physical health, that look into possible collaborations between
young and elderly, such as proposed in [28].
In the data analysis, we found one answer that confusing AR
and VR technologies. Someone thought ”Pok´emon Go” was
a VR game. It might be just a mistake, but it also could due
to the vague understanding of such techniques. It could reﬂect
that there is still room for AR/VR techniques application and
popularisation to a certain extent. Facing AR/VR techniques,
the participants have similar opinions for such applications
beneﬁts to their health, but with different attitudes for applying
AR/VR on different health issues. Although far more VR
games were mentioned than AR (17 vs 6), a single AR game
had far more users than a single VR game (10 vs 3). This
conﬁrmed to a certain extent that the AR technique had greater
development potential, mentioned in the related work, due to
the popularity of mobile devices that can run AR applications.
Some interviewees had a negative attitude towards AR/VR
games and its beneﬁts to physical and mental health, but
far more people held the opposite opinion. As shown in the
results III-B, several advantages could be seen. For example,
VR could provide a more interesting and attractive game
experience with fewer limitations and dangerous risks. It
could also stimulate sports’ motivation and being used to
enjoy social communication online. In addition, AR games
do not require additional equipment apart from a phone and
could be encouraged to go outdoors. Those are some of the
opportunities for AR/VR game development, especially for
mental and physical health. However, the challenges should
be paid attention to as well. Speciﬁcally, the device/equipment
problems in cost and still be perceived as uncomfortable are
shown in III-C.
Comparing the result of the related work and this study,
we could see the similarities of the future requirements of
AR/VR games, like mental, physical and psychological health,
education, and learning. It is worth noting that the training,
healing, and relaxation for psychological and mental health
were the most mentioned in the related work and the survey
conducted in this paper. The previous research and this study
also have similar results of relatively low use frequency of
AR/VR software applications and games. This was similar
for healthcare-relevant staff or students in previous work and
the public as reported in this survey. This shows that AR/VR
techniques still have room for development and popularisation.
In a comparison between the studies, there are also similar
results in the beneﬁts and problems of AR/VR/MR and games.
For example, both mention more cost-effective devices and
software, the potential of being addictive, space for hardware
equipment to improve, stronger motivation to continue its use,
safety, portability, and an improved experience.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper has presented an online questionnaire, based on
74 interviewees, exploring and evaluating the usage situation,
the impact of public physical and mental health, and future
features in AR/VR games. Most interviewees had experience
in AR/VR games, but their practical use frequency was low.
Among the 23 AR/VR games mentioned, the number of VR
games were higher than AR games. However, the number
57

of users of a single game is far greater in AR than in VR.
More than 70% of participants believed that AR games are
good for the body and mind, but the data for VR games was
around 50%. Interviewees mentioned many of the beneﬁts,
problems, features, and functions requirements in the future
development of AR/VR games. These could provide references
to researchers and developers about what is worthy of attention
to improve the technology and applications. Future work will
also be extending the sample size, especially to an elderly
group (over 55 years old), to better know their opinions of
AR/VR games for mental and physical health. As such, we
can better understand their speciﬁc requirements for such
techniques, thereby enriching and perfecting the results and
making them more universal.
