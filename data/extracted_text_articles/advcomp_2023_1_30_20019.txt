Abstract—Nowadays, there are many methods for analysing
images. Among them, a multifractal approach is able to char-
acterise images in terms of the complexity of patterns they
contain. However, multifractal methods are very sensitive to small
changes in colour images. This study presents a preliminary
study for the accurate characterisation of electronic devices in
terms of heat dissipation using multifractal analysis. Specifically,
a novel methodology using multifractal approach is proposed to
characterise images in different colour formats: Grey-Scale, Red-
Green-Blue (RGB), Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Key (CMYK), Hue-
Saturation-Value (HSV) and Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI), and
the results are compared. For this purpose, thermal images of
a Pi3 Raspbian Desktop board are analysed with the aim of
finding out the results of the multifractal analysis on different
areas of the board. Multifractal analysis is carried out through
the box-counting method and the method of moments, since
they allow to extract the main multifractal parameters, such
as, the generalised dimensions function, D(q) and the degree
of multifractality, ∆D(q). The results obtained show that both
scaling properties and multifractal parameters vary according
to the colour format, i.e., the same image exhibits different
multifractal properties depending on the colour format.
Keywords - Multifractal analysis; thermal images; colour
formats; box-counting; colour images.
I. INTRODUCTION
Fractal shapes are mainly characterised by self-similar prop-
erties and a fractal dimension (Df), which is dependent of
the scaling measure [1]. However, in some structures, due
to geometrical complexity, several fractal structures overlap
simultaneously and are considered as multifractal objects [2].
These multifractal objects are completely characterised by a
function, known as a generalised dimensions function (D(q))
[3]. The box-counting method and the method of moments [4]
allow to carry out a simple and robust multifractal analysis on
images. These methods are able to estimate the generalised
fractal dimensions, D(q), and describe complex structures
with sets of regions exhibiting different fractal properties,
providing a relatively more concrete characterisation.
From a fractal approach, image analysis is typically accom-
plished on binary [5] or RGB images [6] [7]; however, they
are hardly found from a multifractal approach nor in different
colour formats [8] [9]. For this reason, a novel methodology
for analysing images in different colour formats by means of
multifractal analysis is proposed in this work. Specifically, four
well-known formats namely RGB, CMYK, HSV and HSI, are
analysed and compared using the multifractal box-counting
method. The analysis has been carried out on thermal images
of a Pi3 Raspbian Desktop board, in order to make a first
approach towards the characterisation of electronic devices
based on heat dissipation. Additionally, three different areas
of the board are analysed, in order to provide our study with
different cases of study. Results show that the multifractal
analysis varies depending on the colour profile, i.e., the same
image, depending on the colour format, presents different
multifractal properties. This result points out that the image
colour profile may hinder the multifractal properties of the heat
dissipation of the electronic device. Therefore, it is concluded
that in order to carry out a multifractal analysis of thermal
images, the raw file should ideally be considered to avoid
alterations in the results.
The paper is organised as follows. Section II briefly presents
the most relevant works in the state of the art. Section III
introduces the methodology proposed in this work. Thermal
image acquisition and multifractal analysis are described in
sections III-A and III-B, respectively. Results are explained in
Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the work.
II. RELATED WORKS
Fractal analysis has extensively been used for the analysis
of digital images [5], however, there are few studies of digital
colour images using a more comprehensive approach, the
multifractal analysis. Most of the existing fractal methods for
analysing images are defined for 1D signal or binary images,
extending to Grey-Scale images [5]. In [8], a multifractal
analysis using the box-counting method is applied on RGB
images. Specifically, the authors analyse a three-dimensional
histogram of the image, which contains the R, G and B colour
coordinates. In the same way, in [10] the three-dimensional

histogram of RGB images is also analysed. However, here,
the authors use the multifractal analysis as an image noise
detection tool. In works such as [9], RGB images are analysed
by decomposing the channels that make up each image. They
propose a methodology similar to the one proposed in this
work. However, they only select one channel from the RGB
image and then binarise it, so the multifractal analysis is
actually conducted on binary images, unlike the proposed
work, where the pixels of the analysed images take values
from 0 to 255. Furthermore, in this work, not only are
RGB images analysed, but also images in different colour
formats (including all the channels that compose each format).
Moreover, [6] highlights the difficulty in estimating the fractal
dimension of RGB colour images. Finally, [7] again analyses
RGB and Grey-Scale images from a fractal approach using
the box-counting method. The authors adopt a methodology
similar to the one followed in this work, since they analyse a
Grey-Scale image as well as each of the channels that make
up the RGB image.
As it can be seen, the number of existing studies on
images considering different colour formats from a multifractal
approach is low. For this reason, the purpose of this work
is to present a new methodology, using multifractal analysis,
to characterise images in different colour formats, in order to
evaluate the influence of the colour format in the results of the
analysis. Specifically, this work is focused on analysing ther-
mal images of an electronic device with the aim of establishing
robust relationships between the multifractal characteristics of
the device and heat dissipation in the future.
III. METHODOLOGY
This section is structured in two subsections. Section III-A
summarises the thermal images under study, as well as the
image capture process and image processing. Then, the mul-
tifractal analysis approach and its application to the study of
thermal images is explained in Section III-B.
A. Thermal images
The images under study correspond to a Pi3 Raspbian
Desktop board, on which the basal consumption was evaluated.
That is, the images are captured during the base consumption
of the Operating System, from an initial state, when the board
is turned off, to a second state, after one hour, when the board
is on. It should be noted that the images were taken by the
authors. The images in the different colour profiles have also
been created by them.
The image capture is performed by a FLIR ETS320 infrared
camera, which allows the visualisation of hot spots and poten-
tial failure points, capturing the emissivity of the object. This
camera model has a wide temperature range [−20◦C, 250◦]
with a measurement accuracy of ±3◦C, allowing to quantify
the heat generation and heat dissipation of small components
(up to 170 µm). It consist of an InfraRed (IR) Sensor, which
offers 76,800 points of non-contact temperature measurement.
Finally, standard radiometric jpeg files are obtained, with 14
bit measurement data.
Image capture is carried out for one hour (3,600 seconds),
from an initial time (t0 = 0s) when the board is off, to a
second time (t1 = 3, 600s), so the board is on for an hour.
During this time period, a total of 31,970 images of the board
were captured, at an average of 8-9 images per second. This
camera model produces rectangular images of 320x240 pixels.
In Figure 1, an example of the captured images is shown.
Figure 1. Example of a 320x240 pixel image of the board.
The subsequent method used for multifractal analysis re-
quires that the analysed images must be square with a side
length power of 2. For this, each of the rectangular images
on the board is cropped into different square sub-images
of 128x128 pixels. Specifically, this study focuses on three
different areas of the board at three different time instants. In
this way, three 128x128 pixels square cutouts were obtained,
each one corresponding to a different time instant, which are
independent of each other (see Figure 2). It should be noted
that each of the images in Figure 2 will be studied, from a
multifractal approach, in different colour profiles: Grey-Scale
(GS), RGB, CMYK, HSV and HSI (see Figure 3).

As already mentioned, the images obtained by the infrared
camera represent the emissivity values captured by the IR
sensor (values from 0.0 to 1.0). Subsequently, a normalisation
is carried out, where these values between 0 and 1 become
the values of a Grey-Scale image (values between 0 and 255).
These Grey-Scale images are used as a reference, because
they are considered to represent the most faithful and realistic
situation to the raw files captured by the camera.
B. Multifractal Analysis
Fractal shapes are mainly characterised by the fact that
the measurement of the object is dependent on the scale of
measurement. When this dependence follows a power law, it

is said that the object manifests fractal properties. The main
parameter is known as the fractal dimension (Df), which is
estimated by means of the slope of the linear fit on the log-
log relationship between the scale and the measure [11] [12].
However, due to geometrical complexity, several fractal struc-
tures overlap simultaneously and are considered as multifractal
objects. Multifractal objects are completely characterised by a
function, known as a generalised dimensions function, D(q)
[13] [14]. The main advantage of multifractal analysis is the
description of complex structures exhibiting sets of regions
with different fractal properties, providing a relatively more
specific characterisation [2].
To carry out the multifractal analysis, it is proposed to use
the box-counting method along with the method of moments
[4]. These methods allow a robust estimation of the gener-
alised fractal dimensions, D(q) [13] [14]. In the box-counting
method, an image of side L is completely covered by a set of
square boxes, of side δ, which do not overlap. Values of δ are
obtained as follows: δ = {L/1, L/2, L/4, L/8, ...}. Regarding
the method of moments, parameter q is a remarkable one,
which is a real value varying between −∞ and +∞ [2].
Positive q values magnify regions with high colour intensity
values, while negative q values intensify regions with low
colour intensity values. With these methods, the partition func-
tion, χ(q, δ) = Pn
i=1(ci(δ))q, is obtained, being (ci(δ))q the
mass probability function. It is well known that multifractality
appears when the existence of a power law between χ(q, δ)
vs. δ is trusted. This function allows to differentiate the scale
ranges (δ) where the linear fits will be performed. In this work,
it is taken as a criterion to select the scale range where all the
moments q can be considered, both positive and negative, and
where, in addition, there is linearity. Once the range of scales
is established, we turn to the generalised dimensions function,
D(q) = τ(q)
q−1, where τ(q) is the mass exponent function. τ(q)
is obtained from the slope of the linear fittings performed in
the selected regions of the partition function.
Notice that D(q) exhibits multifractal behaviour when it is
a monotonically decreasing function dependent on q. By con-
trast, it is considered monofractal when D(q) is independent of
q, i.e., it is represented by a horizontal straight line of constant
slope. Another multifractal parameter used in this work is the
degree of multifractality, ∆D(q) = D(qmin)−D(qmax). This
parameter indicates the multifractal strength of the image, i.e.,
the higher the ∆D(q) value, the greater the multifractality of
the image. By contrast, the smaller the ∆D(q) value, the more
monofractal it is.
In this work, we first propose to study the partition func-
tions of each image establishing the scale ranges where the
linear fits will be made to complete the analysis. Note that
there will be a partition function for each of the channels
that make up each colour profile. Subsequently, once the
scale ranges have been established, the values of D(q) are
computed and depicted against q to obtain the generalised
dimensions function. Finally, since Grey-Scale images are
considered as reference images, comparisons are made with
the different colour formats. For this purpose, the difference
between the values of the Grey-Scale dimension functions and
the dimension functions of each channel is evaluated. This
difference allows to determine the channels and scale ranges
that capture the multifractal behaviour of the original image
and, therefore, determine which colour format and/or channel
is more representative of each original image.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, the main findings after applying the box-
counting and the method of moments to the image set are
shown. First, the results of the analysis of the image of
reference, i.e., the Grey-Scale, are presented followed by the
RGB, CMYK, HSV and HSI formats. Finally, a comparison
between the colour formats and the Grey-Scale images is
accomplished.
A. Multifractal Analysis of Grey-Scale images
First of all, it should be noted that the box-couting method
and the method of moments are used to carry out the mul-
tifractal analysis. Both are performed in Matlab software. In
this case, for an image size of 128x128 pixels, the values of
the scale (δ) range from δ = 20 = 1 to δ = 27 = 128. The
values of the moments q are set between -4 and 4.
The partition functions of the three images selected and rep-
resented in Grey-Scale (see Figure 2) present similar shapes.
Figure 4 (a) shows the partition function corresponding to the
image of the area 1 of the board. However, it is representative
of the rest of the Grey-Scale images. As observed, none of
them show crossovers that distinguish scale ranges, i.e., a
single linear region is observed from δ = 1 to δ = 128.
In this way, the generalised dimensions function, D(q), can
be completely reconstructed for all moments q. Linear fits are
performed with a coefficient R2 greater than 0.99 for all cases.
Figure 4 (b) shows the generalised dimensions function, D(q),

corresponding to the image of the area 1 of the board. Again,
it is representative of the rest of the Grey-Scale images. As
seen, the generalised dimension function is horizontal, thus it
can be considered as a monofractal behaviour.

Table I shows the results for the D(q) of the three areas of
the board. The values of D(q) exhibit a very small degree of
multifractality, so that, monofractal behaviour is considered in
all three cases. It should be noted that the ∆D(q) of image
area 1 is higher than in the rest of the images. This is due
to the fact that the estimation for negative q values is worse.
However, the rest of the function D(q) is monofractal. Images
of areas 2 and 3 are completely monofractal.

B. Multifractal Analysis of RGB images
In Figure 5, the partition functions obtained from the image
of area 1 of the board for the 3 channels of the RGB colour
profile are shown, as an example. In contrast to Grey-Scale
images, the RGB images have different crossovers depending
on the colour channel, so that there are different linear regions.
Therefore, multifractal analysis is performed in different scale
ranges depending on the colour channel. The same behaviour
is observed for the RGB images of areas 2 and 3, i.e.,
depending on the image and the colour channel, partition
functions with linear regions differing from each other are
obtained.
Table II summarises the results obtained from the 3 RGB
images analysed. On the one hand, the values of the degree of
multifractality, ∆D(q), are presented. On the other hand, in
order to detect which channel is capable of exhibiting the same
monofractal behaviour as the reference Grey-Scale image (see
Table I), the quadratic error (P x2 = P(D(q)gs − D(q)c)2)
is estimated, which summarises the differences between the
Grey-Scale and the colour channel. A value of the difference
less than or equal to 0.2 is considered acceptable.
It should be noted that Table II indicates which colour chan-
nels do or do not exhibit scaling behaviour for a given range

of scales. That is, scaling behaviour exists when the values of
D(q) are constant (monofractal) or decrease (multifractal) as
the q moments grow. Increasing D(q) functions implies a non-
scaling behaviour. Therefore, regions which exhibit scaling
behaviour are denoted by the symbol ✓, otherwise they are
marked with −. In Table II, Scaling Behaviour is denoted as
SB.
As it can be seen in Table II, only channel G presents a
scaling behaviour in all the δ regions for the three images.
For channel R, only one δ region of images 1 and 2 show
scaling properties, as opposed to channel B, where only one
δ region of images 1 and 3 do not show it. In terms of the
P x2, regions exhibiting the least difference compared to the
Grey-Scale images are specified next: In G channel, region 2
(δ = 16−128) for the image of area 1; region 1 (δ = 1−128)
for the image of area 2; and region 2 (δ = 16 − 128) for the
image of area 3. In channel B, only in the image of area 2,
specifically in the region 2 (δ = 16 − 128). In channel R, an
adequate approximation to the multifractal behaviour of the
Grey-Scale reference image is not achieved.
C. Multifractal Analysis of CMYK images
The partition functions of the CMYK image 1 area 1 are
shown in Figure 6 as a representative example. As seen,
the CMYK images also show different partition functions
depending on the chosen colour channel. Each of the channels
that make up the CMYK colour profile have different linear

The same procedure used in the analysis of RGB images is
explained next. First, it is determined which channel exhibits a
scaling behaviour. In this case, with respect to channel C, the
image of area 1 in region 2 (δ = 32 − 128) shows a scaling
behaviour, as well as the image of area 2 for the regions 1
(δ = 1 − 8) and 2 (δ = 16 − 128). On the other hand, no
scaling features are found in the image area 3. In terms of
channel M, only region 2 (δ = 32−128) of the image of area
2 shows a scaling behaviour. In channel Y, both images 1 and
2, both in region 2 (δ = 32 − 128), present scaling properties.
Finally, in channel K, only the region 2 of image of area 2
(δ = 32 − 128) exhibits a scaling behaviour.
Once the scale ranges where a scaling behaviour occurs have
been established, a comparison with the Grey-Scale images is
made. Only channel C can capture the scaling behaviour of
the reference image, specifically in image area 2 for both scale
ranges. In this case, it could be considered that the CMYK
colour profile does not provide proper results, since it fails to
capture the monofractality of the original image.
D. Multifractal Analysis of HSV images
The HSV images present the same behaviour as the pre-
vious ones, i.e., each of the images analysed shows different
partition functions depending on the channel. In Figure 7, the
partition functions of the HSV image area 1 are shown as
a representative example. Again, as it can be seen, different
linear regions and different scale ranges are obtained from the
multifractal analysis.

scaling features in region 1, specifically from δ = 2 to δ = 128

for image area 2. The same result is found for channels S and
V, where the images exhibit scaling properties for region 1
(δ = 1 to δ = 128).
In terms of the comparison with the Grey-Scale reference
images, it is noteworthy to mention that all 3 channels are
capable of capturing the scaling behaviour of the reference
images, except in the case of image area 3 and channel H.
E. Multifractal Analysis of HSI images
Finally, the results obtained in the analysis of the HSI
images are discussed. Again, for the same image, each colour
channel has different linear regions (see Figure 8). This
happens in the rest of images, as already discussed in the
previous cases.

The scale ranges that exhibit a scaling behaviour are ex-
plained next: In channel H, the image of area 1 for a scale
range from δ = 8 to δ = 32 in region 2, as well as image area
2 for the region 2 (δ = 16 − 128), and image area 3 again in
region 2 (δ = 8 − 32). In channel S, a scaling behaviour is
found in region 1 (δ = 4 − 128) of the image of area 1, in the
image of area 2 in region 1 (δ = 1 − 128) and in the image
of area 3 in regions 1 (δ = 4 − 16) and 2 (δ = 16 − 128).
In I channel, image area 1 shows scaling features in region 2
(δ = 8 − 128), the image area 2 in regions 1 (δ = 4 − 16)
and 2 (δ = 16 − 128), and image of area 3 only in region 2
(δ = 8 − 32).
Compared to the Grey-Scale reference images, it should
be highlighted that channel H fails to capture the reference
scaling behaviour in any of the images. Regarding channel
S, the results are acceptable for the image of area 2, in
region 1 (δ = 1 − 128), and in image of area 3 in region
2 (δ = 16 − 128). Finally, channel I only provides acceptable
results for image area 2, specifically in region 2 (δ = 16−128).
F. Comparison between Grey-Scale images and colour for-
mats
The aim of this subsection is to summarise the colour
channels that have been detected as the best approximation to
the monofractal behaviour of the Grey-Scale reference images.
In order to do so, the focus is on the difference between the
D(q) values of the Grey-Scale images and those of the colour
models assessed with the quadratic error (P x2). Table III
shows how the colour channels resemble to the original image
measured as percentage. This percentage is calculated by
considering the colour channels that exhibit scaling behaviour
and taking into account those whose quadratic error (P x2) is
less than or equal to 0.2. This way, those colour channels that
have presented a lower error will have a higher percentage.
That is, if a channel, in all cases, has managed to capture the
monofractal behaviour of the reference image, it will have a
percentage of 100% and, therefore, if it has not been able to
capture such behaviour in any of the cases, it will be scored
with 0%. Therefore, the higher the percentage value, the more
representative and better approximation the channel presents.
It should be noted that Table III shows the results of the three
images analysed from an overall global approach.

As seen, three out of the four colour formats studied fail to
capture the reference monofractal behaviour. For RGB, CMYK
and HSI formats, there is at least one channel that can not be
accepted as a proper approximation of the reference images,
exhibiting a percentage of 0%. By contrast, there are other
channels with an acceptable approximation with a percentage
over 60%, e.g., channels G, C and S for RGB, CMYK and HSI,
respectively. Finally, the HSV colour model provides proper
results, since a high approximation (between 67% and 100%)
is achieved for three channels and their three images.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This work proposes a novel methodology to analyse images
in different colour formats: Grey-Scale, RGB, CMYK, HSV

and HSI by means of a multifractal approach based on the
box-counting method and the method of moments. The study
is carried out on thermal images of a Raspberry Pi3 electronic
device.
Results show that the images in all the studied colour
profiles have different partition functions as well as different
scale ranges. This implies that the multifractal analysis varies
depending on both the image format and the colour profile. In
fact, the same image presents different multifractal behaviour
depending on the colour format. On the contrary, the partition
functions of the Grey-Scale images show linearity for all
values of δ (1-128) in all images analysed.
The capability of capturing the behaviour of the original
image of each format is evaluated by estimating the approxi-
mation of each colour channel with respect to the Grey-Scale
image.
Results show that the CMYK colour profile is not consid-
ered suitable, as it fails to capture the multifractal behaviour
of the original image in most of its channels. Among them
some channels of RGB and HSI are able to approximate to
the behaviour of the original image, the HSV arises as the
most suitable format for analysing thermal images from a
multifractal approach. Finally, it should also be noted that the
capability to reproduce the monofractal behaviour of Grey-
Scale images also depends on the range of scales considered
(δ). For RGB and HSI formats, the scale range is usually
from 16 to 128, so no monofractality can be found for scales
(δ < 16). Conversely, in the HSV format, the scale range
covers the entire image with δ ranging from 1 to 128, so in
this sense, this format is the one that exhibits monofractality
over a larger range of scales.
The disparity of scaling behaviours found for different
image channels and formats suggests an in-depth study on the
multifractal features of images represented in different formats
using the usual image analysis benchmarks from the literature
is needed. As future work, it would be interesting to build a
meta-model, in which different formats would consider their
“understanding” of the image, while that meta-model would
combine their “opinions”.
