Abstract — Typically, any asymmetric network is 
characterized either by non-uniform link transmission bit rate 
or by uneven traffic intensity. Through monitoring and 
asymmetric 
network 
status 
control 
one 
can 
improve 
performance of the service-sector. In this paper, some exact 
analysis methods, oriented to achieve comparatively high 
utilization of the data packet transmission link and satisfy the 
service quality of the asymmetric loss and queueing systems, 
are proposed. The developed mathematical approach turns out 
to be extremely useful for the analysis of the network node 
with 
asymmetric 
transmission 
links. 
Some 
comments 
concerning the application of a few different strategies to the 
selection of an unoccupied data packet transmission link are 
discussed. The straight process analysis in the asymmetric loss 
and queueing systems is carried out using continuous-time 
Markov chains. Performance of the asymmetric system is 
measured using accurate expressions. Finally, in the case of 
Poisson arrivals and exponential transmission times, an exact 
analytical model is applied to the system. 
Keywords - queueing system; quality of service; asymmetric 
system; Markov process. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Computation of the performance measures is simple 
enough if all data packet transmission links have the same 
parameters and packet transmission times are distributed 
exponentially. Though, in the data transmission network, 
heterogeneous transmission links appear often and often. 
Performance of the data transmission over an asymmetric 
system with multiple links depends on a particular link that 
transmits a data packet. Therefore, it is highly expedient and 
useful to compute accurately the performance measures of 
the said asymmetric systems. The more detailed description 
of the latter systems is presented in [1, 2]. In [3], it is shown 
that a well-known approach to investigating symmetric 
M/M/m and GI/G/m systems (Kendall's notation is used) can 
be applied also to the suchlike asymmetric systems, provided 
the service rates of data packet transmission links differ only 
slightly (by a ratio <10) and the system utilization is high 
enough. Some interesting methods, used to compute several 
characteristics of the asymmetric queueing systems, are 
described in [4] wherein computations reduce to solving 
equations associated with continuous-time Markov chains. In 
such a way, some accurate results are obtained for 
elementary asymmetric lossless M/M/m queueing systems. 
In [5], the asymmetric finite capacity queueing systems are 
analyzed with the use of analytical and simulation models 
based on Moore and Mealy automata. In [6], performance 
measures for an asymmetric node, with a priority flow and 
two data transmission links, are estimated applying analytical 
and simulation models. Advanced resources sharing 
methods, in asymmetric networks, are proposed in [7]. In [8], 
Lakshman et al. produce the network control mechanism 
facilitating and supporting TCP/IP data transmission over the 
asymmetric networks. Authors determine the throughput as a 
function of buffering, and state conditions under which the 
transmission link is fully utilized. In [9], Krithikaivasan et 
al., employing control and routing, outline rigorously how to 
improve performance in congested parts of the asymmetric 
network. 
Not going into minor details, we here emphasize that 
asymmetric systems, as well as their performance analysis, 
are far from being investigated thoroughly. Further research 
is necessary.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
introduces an asymmetric loss system. Section III evaluates 
data packets arrival rate impact on the performance measures 
of the asymmetric loss system. Analysis of the data packet 
rate impact on the performance measures of the asymmetric 
queueing system is presented in Section IV. Some conclusive 
commentary is presented in Section V.

ANALYSIS OF THE ASYMMETRIC LOSS SYSTEM 
An asymmetric loss system with different rates of the 
data packet transmission links is modelled. The functional 
diagram of the system is presented in Fig. 1.

The best performance measures of the system, such as 
the link utilization and the data packet loss, are obtained by 
switching between transmission links.

transmission time over each link (intensities μ1 and μ2, 
μ1>μ2). Such an asymmetric system can be represented as the 
continuous-time Markov chain (the system itself being in a 
stable state). Two parameters (components of the vector XY) 
are attached to each state of the system, where X represents 
the state of the data packet transmission link 1, and Y 
represents that of the data packet transmission link 2. If X or 
Y equals zero the respective link is free (unoccupied), 
otherwise (X or Y equals 1), the respective link is busy. Let 
us consider a loss system, provided a few different strategies 
for selecting transmission link are applied (Fig. 2 – Fig. 4).

In Fig. 5, the dependence of the data packet transmission 
link utilizations ρi1 and ρi2 on the strategy used to select an 
unoccupied data transmission link i (
i 1,2,3)
facilitates 
selection of the data transmission link (Cases 1,2,3 ). 
The data packet loss probability Ploss attains its maximal 
value in Case 3 and minimal value in Case 2 (the faster 
transmission link is occupied first; Fig. 6).

We here observe that the analytical model of the 
queueing system is accurate only in the case of Poisson 
arrivals and exponential data packet transmission times (in 
the links). 
IV. 
DATA PACKETS ARRIVAL RATE IMPACT ON THE 
PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF THE ASYMMETRIC QUEUEING 
SYSTEM 
In this section, an asymmetric queueing system with two 
data packet transmission links is analysed. To estimate the 
queueing system performance measures, an exact analytical 
model has been developed. The queueing system itself is 
characterized by different data packet transmission rates μ1, 
μ2 and a finite buffer of size K (the lower part; Fig. 7). 
 
 
Figure 7. Functional architecture of the asymmetric queueing system. 
 
For instance, the above model can be applied to 
evaluating performance measures of the main node of a 
sensor network. As the basis for calculations, the situation 
shown in the upper part of Fig. 7 is chosen. The data flow, 
from the network of sensors, is directed to the main node 
which sends the data over the Internet to the remote 
database. The main node has two data transmission links: the 
primary link that is connected to the Internet over VDSL 
modem, and the secondary link that is connected to the 
Internet over 3G modem. The mean data transmission rates 
over the primary and the secondary links are equal to 
C1=4Mb/s=500000B/s 
and 
C2=2Mb/s=250000B/s, 
respectively. The secondary link is used if and only if the 
primary link is busy. The mean length of the data packet 
equals L=1000B. Therefore, the buffer of B=16KB can store 
up to K=B/L=16 data packets. The data packet transmission 
intensities over the first and the second links equal 
μ1=C1/L=500 
packets/s 
and 
μ2=C2/L=250 
packets/s, 
respectively. 
Consider the Poisson data packet arrival flow, with 
intensity λ, and the data packet transmission time (over each 
link) distributed exponentially. The data packet transmission 
link scheduling strategy is such that the link with data packet 
transmission rate μ1 is occupied first. The data packet from 
the buffer (finite capacity) is transmitted only over the 
second transmission link with transmission rate μ2. A birth-
and-death Markov model of the suchlike queueing system is 
shown in Fig. 8.  
 
 
Figure 8. The continuous-time Markov chain for the asymmetric 
queueing system. 
 
Each steady state of the system is described using three 
parameters (components of the vector XYZ), where X 
represents the state of the first link (0 – unoccupied, 1 –busy) 
Y represents that of the second link and Z represents the 
number of data packets in the buffer (in our case, from 0 to 
K).  
For finding the system state probabilities, the following 
system of algebraic equations is used:

Performance measures of the queueing system, expressed 
in the form of a function of the queueing system parameters 
λ and K, are shown in Fig. 9 - Fig. 15. 
The data packet loss probability increases considerably 
when the data packet transmission link utilization achieves 
0.5 (λ>400) (Fig. 9). 
 
 
Figure 9. The data packet loss probability Ploss as a function of λ, 
given μ1=500, μ2=250, K=16. 
 
 
The data packet loss in the system occurs if and only if 
the buffer is full. The data packet loss probability can be 
lessened in several ways: by increasing the buffer capacity, 
by increasing the data transmission rate over the links or by 
decreasing the data packet arrival rate. In the given example, 
the decrease of the data packet arrival rate is achieved by 
limiting the number of data collection sensors. For instance, 
if one of the data sensors produces 10 data packets per 
second, then the main node can serve 40 sensors with 
minimal risk of data packet loss. 
The link utilization level turns out to be another 
important concern. The right estimation of the link utilization 
level is used to guarantee that the packet loss will not occur. 
Also, the estimation results can be used to evaluate economic 
aspects of the link usage. For instance, the cost of the data 
transmission over the secondary link over the 3G Internet 
connection can be higher. Thus, the given model can be 
explored to estimate how intensively the links will be used, 
calculate the usage price or make a decision concerning data 
transmission rates operable in the links.

In Fig. 10, dependence of the link utilization on the data 
packet arrival intensity λ, is demonstrated. It can be seen that 
the links are used according to the selected scheduling 
strategy: first of all, the primary link (with greater data 
transmission rate) is occupied, the secondary link is used if 
and only if the first one is busy.  
 
 
Figure 10. The data packet transmission link utilization ρ1 and ρ2 as a 
function of λ, given μ1=500, μ2=250, K=16. 
 
The selected link usage (scheduled) strategy also affects 
other performance measures.  
The average number of data packets in the queue (Fig. 
11) rapidly increases when the primary link is busy and the 
loading of the secondary link goes up. 
 
 
Figure 11. The mean value of data packets in the buffer Nq as a function of 
λ, given μ1=500, μ2=250, K=16. 
 
The probability that an arriving data packet will enter the 
queue (Fig. 12) also increases when the intensity λ of data 
packet arrival is increased. Although, it is clear that it should 
be in this way, but the proposed model gives the exact 
values, which have an interesting nonlinear fashion. 
 
Figure 12. The probability that an arriving data packet will enter the queue 
P(W>0) as a function of λ, given μ1=500, μ2=250, K=16. 
 
The mean values of the time, spent by a data packet in 
the queue (W) and in the system (Ts), are very important 
parameters (Fig. 13). Those values facilitate evaluation of the 
data packet transmission delay or the processing rate.  
 
 
Figure 13. The mean values of the time, spent by a data packet in the queue 
W [seconds] and in the system Ts [seconds], as a function of λ, 
given μ1=500, μ2=250, K=16. 
 
It is recommended to transmit data packets, which are 
sensitive to delay, via the link 1 (in the presented asymmetric 
system). 
The size of the buffer also influences the system 
performance parameters. The influence degree can be 
estimated using the proposed model. 
The data packet loss probabilities Ploss, expressed in 
terms of λ and K, are presented in Fig. 14. As it can be seen, 
the greater the buffer K, the lesser the probabilities Ploss. On 
the other hand, the difference is negligible, as the packet 
transmission link utilization approaches 1 (λ>750).

K. It can also be seen that the values of Ts grow apart, as the 
data packet transmission link utilization approaches 1 
(λ>750).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In the paper, the queueing performance measures, such as 
the probability of the data packet loss in a finite buffer, the 
mean queue length, the mean waiting time, the arrival rate 
impact on the performance measures, are investigated using 
appropriate analytical models. In the general case (say, non-
Poisson data packet flow, non-exponential service time 
distribution), an exact analytical model turns out to be very 
complicated. So, simulation is recommended to achieve task-
oriented investigation results. 
Obviously, the proposed formal approach to the analysis 
of asymmetric systems is nothing but the starting point for 
those who are interested in the processes associated with 
asymmetric data packet transmission systems, i.e. for those 
specialists who wish to identify new research trends in the 
area of asymmetric transmission systems for better resource 
sharing and increasing transmission link performance 
measures. 
Undoubtedly, accurate modelling of the data packet 
transmission processes in asymmetric systems is truly an 
important step in optimizing any data transmission network.
