Abstract—The enormous demand of Wireless Sensor Networks 
(WSNs) in various applications has intensified the concern 
about
sensor nodes placement.
The choice of sensor 
deployment strategy is mentioned among the most critical 
issues for the designer of such networks. Some objective 
functions, such as coverage, energy consumption and network 
connectivity, are a key challenge that should be satisfied while 
achieving optimal
placement topologies. In this work, 
deployment issue has been modeled as a constrained multi-
objective optimization (MOO) problem. The aim of this work 
was to find the optimal sensor nodes positions in the area of 
interest in terms of coverage, energy consumption and network 
connectivity. A new multi-objective optimization approach 
based on Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) was introduced.  
The simulation results show that the proposed approach 
improve both coverage and energy consumption compared
with other multi objective approaches.

INTRODUCTION 
Over the last few decades, fields of microelectronics, 
micromechanics and wireless communication technologies 
have made a noticeable progress that allows the production 
of cost-effective components of a few cubic millimeters in 
volume. Therefore, wireless sensor networks(WSNs) have
arisen as a new area of research to provide more economical
solutions , an easy to deploy remote monitoring and 
processing of data in complex environments, . WSNs consist 
of a large number of nodes deployed in a region of interest 
(RoI) to collect and transmit environmental data to one or 
more collection points autonomously. These networks are of
interest especially for military applications, environmental
applications, home automation, medical and many of the 
applications 
related 
to 
the 
surveillance 
of 
critical 
infrastructure. These applications often require a high level 
of security and characteristics sharing because of the lack of 
infrastructure, limited energy and dynamic topology. Sensor 
nodes have limited resources, namely the energy resources
and the calculation capabilities as well as the storage 
capacity. Thus, most studies and researches on WSN have 
dealt with resources optimization problems in order to 
enhance the performances and meet the quality of service 
(QoS) requirements. 
The deployment of a sensor in the RoI is a crucial issue 
for any WSN designers especially with the limitations of 
sensor nodes. In fact, WSN performances are greatly
influenced by the placement strategies since they directly 
affect QoS metrics, such as energy consumption, sensor 
lifetime and sensing coverage equally [1]. Hence, a powerful 
sensor deployment 
strategy 
will 
obviously 
improve 
performance and resource management. The deployment 
strategies can be classified according to three criteria: the 
first is the placement methodology that can be either random 
placement 
or 
grid-based 
placement 
(deterministic 
placement).the second is the optimization of performance 
metrics such as connectivity, sensing coverage, energy 
consumption and lifetime. Finally, the roles the deployed 
node, which can be regular, relay, cluster-head, or base-
station plays [2]. The placement techniques can be further 
categorized into static and dynamic according to whether the 
optimization is performed at the time of deployment or when
the network is working, respectively. The choice of the 
deployment schema depends on many properties [2].
The coverage problem is one of the most basic issues in 
wireless sensor networks, it directly affects the capability 
and the performances of the sensor network [3]. The quality 
of coverage is immediately influenced by the choice of the 
deployment strategy. Most of the applications using WSN, 
especially 
those
requiring
permanent 
measurements 
collection, demand a low-energy consuming network. Also, 
for the sensors network itself, energy consumption is a 
critical issue since sensor nodes rely on limited power 
resources. As a result, an optimal deployment topology 
should achieve a trade-off between the coverage requirement 
and the energy constraint. In general, there exist conflicts 
between minimizing energy dissipation and maximizing 
coverage. To maximize the area of coverage, sensor nodes 
must be placed far away from the sink node (data collection 
point) which means that the sensor signals need higher 
power in order to reach farther distances. Multi-objective 
optimization approaches (MOOAs) are generally used to 
solve optimization problems with conflicting objectives. The 
multi-objective optimization (MOO) works on several 
objective function vectors simultaneously.  Unlike, the 
single-objective optimization, the solution of MOO is a set of 
solutions, known as the set of pareto optimal solutions [4].
The connectivity metric in WSN is satisfied if, and only if,
there exists at least one path between each pair of nodes. 
This requirement is at the same level of importance with the 
coverage requirement. Actually, these two metrics should be 
strongly related in order to ensure wider monitored area 
without connectivity holes. 
Nature constantly inspires research in the field of 
optimization. While genetics, ants and particle swarm

algorithms are famous examples, other nature inspired 
optimization 
algorithms 
emerge 
regularly. 
Flower 
Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is a novel global optimization 
algorithm inspired from pollination process of flowers. FPA 
is simple and very powerful; in fact, it can outperform both 
genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization 
(PSO) according to [5].
In this work, we proposed a new deployment approach 
based on the multi objective version for FPA (MOFPA) [6] 
for WSN. Our approach aimed
to find the optimal 
deployment topology taking into account the aforementioned 
objectives,
i.e.,
minimizing energy consumption and 
maximizing total coverage while maintaining connectivity 
constraints.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section 2, the related work is outlined. The problem 
formulation is presented in Section 3. Section 4 introduces
the proposed approach. In Section 5, simulation results and 
discussion are given. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK
Many literature surveys are available where optimization 
methods have been used to solve several nodes placement 
issues for WSNs. The authors in [7] proposed an improved 
version of Artificial Bee Colony algorithm to maximize the 
coverage rate in WSN. This algorithm modified the 
updating equation of onlooker bee and scout bee. In fact, 
some new parameters, such as forgetting, neighbor factor 
and probability of mutant were introduced to enhance 
coverage rate and accelerate the convergence speed. 
Sengupta et al. [8] achieved an optimal tradeoff between 
coverage, energy consumption and lifetime in WSN using 
the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). They 
developed 
an 
enhanced 
version 
of 
Multi-objective 
evolutionary algorithm based on differential evolution 
(MOEA/D-DE) known as MOEA/DFD, which includes the 
fuzzy dominance. The authors in [9] proposed three 
algorithms, specifically integer linear programming models, 
a local search algorithm and a genetic algorithm in order to 
solve the deployment problems of WSNs. Theirs approaches 
aimed at finding the optimal deployment in terms of area of 
coverage and number of wireless sensor nodes by taking 
into account the connectivity constraint. Likewise, they 
compared the three models with some regular sensor 
deployment patterns. The problem of the probability node 
deployment is less important than the distribution of the 
asymmetrical nodes. Zhang et al. [10] addressed the sensor 
nodes deployment issues for Directional Sensor Networks 
(DSNs). They proposed a novel placement approach based 
on PSO in order to enhance the coverage probability of the 
monitoring field. The probability coverage model was 
adapted as a sensing model.

PROBLEM FORMULATION
Considering the severe resources constraints of sensor 
nodes and the levels of QoS required for the WSNs, an 
optimal placement process has to be considered. In this 
work, we aimed at finding the coordinates of the sensor 
nodes in a two−dimensional sensing area that insure the 
maximal coverage rate and minimal energy dissipation. The 
deployed sensors should be connected in an efficient way so 
that each deployed sensor can find a connection path to 
reach the sink node. Consequently, our deployment problem 
was modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem with 
two objective functions, namely total coverage ratio and 
energy consumption, and one problem constraint, namely 
the network connectivity.
A.
Preliminary Definitions
Sensor nodes in WSN are characterized by their positions 
in the 2D plane (x, y), sensing radius Rs and communication 
radius Rc. Given a multi-hop WSN, where all nodes 
collaborate in order to ensure cooperative communication 
such network, can be defined as a linked graph, G = {V, E}, 
where V is the set of vertices representing sensors and E is 
the set of edges representing links between the sensors. Let u 
ϵ V and v ϵ V, (u, v) belongs to E if, and only if, u can 
directly send a message to v (we say that v is neighbor of u). 
We assume that Rc is identical for all nodes. Let d(u, v) be 
the distance between the nodes u and v, the set E can be 
defined as follows:

The network coverage is defined by the sensing radius of the 
sensor node, whereas the network connectivity is specified 
by the communication radius of the nodes.
B.
Multi objective optimization
Formulating an optimization problem as a multi 
objective problem is necessary in some cases, especially 
when the problem involves more than one objective 
functions and several constraints. The objective functions 
are typically conflicting; the task of MOOA is to find a 
tradeoff between the conflicted objectives. Unlike single-
objective problem optimization, the results of MOOA are 
usually a set of solutions [4].

point is that of Pareto optimality. This is specified as 
follows:
A point, y* ϵ Y, is Pareto optimal if there is not another 
solution point y ϵ Y, such that f(y) ≤ f(y*) for at least one 
function [4].
Definition3. Non-dominated solution
A feasible solution is non-dominated if there is not another 
feasible solution better than the current one in some 
objective function.
C.
Energy Model
The energy consumed by WSN is considered as the first 
objective function. Here, our purpose was to minimize the 
total energy consumed by the network. Supposing that E0 is 
the initial energy capacity for each sensor and ei is the 
energy consumed by each node i, ei can be formulated as 
follows:
e
ME
TE
P
RE
i
i

Where MEi is the maintenance energy, TEi is the 
transmission energy, Psi refers to the cost of minimum path 
from a sensor node i to the sink node, REi is the reception 
energy and αi represents the number of sensors in which 
node i receives data and transfers it to the sink node in 
multi-hop communication.
The network total energy consumed is defined as the sum of 
the energy consumed by each node. So, our first objective 
function is given as follows:
f =Minimize(

With N the number of sensor nodes.
D.
Coverage Model
Coverage in WSN can be defined as the total area 
covered by a collection of sensor nodes deployed in the 
region of interest (RoI). Coverage problems are commonly 
classified into two types: target coverage problem and area 
coverage problem. The former ensures the monitoring of 
only certain specific points which have fixed positions in the 
area of interest, while the latter is concerned with the 
supervision of the whole deployment area.  In this paper, an 
area coverage problem was considered.  The sensing area 
was considered as m × n grids, each grid point size was 
equal to 1 and denoted as G(x, y). The zone covered by a 
sensor node was a disk with a radius equal to the sensing 
radius of the sensor (Rs) (Figure 1). The binary sensing 
model was considered. For this model each grid point within 
the sensing radius of a node can be taken as covered with 
probability equal to "1" and point out of the sensing range 
was set as "0" since it cannot be covered.
Figure 1. Sensor coverage in sensing field
Thus, the coverage of the whole area is proportional to 
the grid points that can be covered by at least one sensor 
Si(xi, yi) [17].

The second objective function is to maximize the total 
coverage area. But, since energy consumption has to 
minimized, coverage metric should be modeled as a 
minimizing problem. So, our objective function has to be 
expressed as minimizing the non-coverage ratio which is 
equal to 0 in case of full coverage.

Connectivity Constraint
The network connectivity is satisfied if there exists, at 
least, one path from the sensor node to the sink node. Here, 
connectivity is considered as a problem constraint.
Definition 1. Node Degree
Given an undirected graph G, the degree Deg (u) of a vertex 
u ϵ V is specified as the number of neighbors of u [11].
Definition 2. k-Node Connectivity
A graph is considered to be connected if for every pair of
nodes, there exists a single hop or a multi-hop path 
connecting them otherwise the graph is called disconnected. 
A graph is considered to be Q-connected if for any pair of

nodes there are at least Q reciprocally separate paths 
connecting them [11].

PROPOSED APPROACH 
Our objective was to enhance the performances of WSN 
by optimizing both coverage [14] and energy consumption 
metrics without affecting the network connectivity. Here, we 
dealt with area coverage problem for a centralized random 
placement topology with a predefined number of sensors. 
The proposed approach is a multi objective approach based 
on FPA. This section presents the different rules and steps of 
the proposed approach.
A.
Multi-Objective Flower Pollination Algorithm
Meta-heuristics algorithms are often inspired from nature 
and designed to solve challenging optimization problems. 
Here, we considered one of the most recent meta-heuristic 
algorithms  named FPA, developed by Xin-She Yang in 
2012 [5] for the global optimization problems. FPA inspired 
from the flower pollination process of flowering plants. In 
nature, flowers pollination process resulting from the transfer 
of pollen, typically, by pollinators such as insects, birds, bats 
and other animals. In this work, we presented a multi 
objective approach based on MOFPA [6] to solve 
deployment problems for WSN. FPA has the following four 
rules:
1. Cross-pollination is a global pollination process with 
pollen carrying pollinators doing Lévy flights.
2. Self-pollination is considered as local pollination.
3. Flower constancy can be defined as the reproduction 
probability proportional to the similarity of the two 
flowers involved.
4. Global and local pollination is controlled by a switch 
probability p ϵ [0, 1].
The fitness function used for this work is given by the 
following equation:
 Minimize (f , f )

f
(8)
With f1 and f2 described above. 
The pseudo code of the proposed approach is presented 
in Figure 2. Where Nf represents the number of flower, ɛ is 
the scaling factor, p is the switching probability, Ft
i 
is
solution vector Fi at iteration t and g* is the current best 
solution found among all solutions at the current 
generation/iteration. Thus, to imitate the movement of the 
pollinator, FPA uses Lévy flight. Therefore, we draw L > 0 
from a Lévy distribution:

Initial population
To implement the proposed approach, we needed to 
create an initial population for FPA. In this work, we 
considered that each individual or flower represented the 
vector of all sensor nodes position (x, y) in RoI. 
To create the initial population, we began by generating 
the position of the sink node at the centre of RoI for each 
flower. Then, we deployed the remaining sensors randomly 
after verifying the connectivity constraint. Actually, the 
network connectivity is assumed to be full if the distance 
between two sensors is less than the communication radius 
(Rc) of the sensor. Rc is set at 2RS to guarantee the network 
connectivity [12]. The distance is defined as the Euclidean 
distance between two sensors. In addition, to ensure a 
sufficient distribution in RoI, we controlled the number of 
neighbors of each deployed node that should be less than a 
predefined number Ne. Here, Ne was set to 1. So, we dealt
with 1-connected network.
The pseudo code of the initial population is presented in 
Figure 3. With Si is the sensor node i, Nf is number of 
flowers, Rc is the node communication radius and Ne is the 
maximum number of neighbors.

SIMULATION AND RESULTS

some simulations were performed.  Here, the binary sensing 
model was taken and sensor nodes of the initial population

The network is homogeneous, i.e., all sensors have the 
same deployment parameters such as the sensing and 
communication radius. Simulations were carried out using 
MATLAB R2016a.  The algorithm was run a maximum 
number of iterations of 1500 for 5 runs.
Figure 4 presents all solutions (dominated and non-
dominated) obtained over
five runs of the proposed 
algorithms. The simulation shows that 90% of non-
dominated solutions (see Figure 4) offered the following 
pairs of values: (217.09, 0.166) and (199.36, 0.168), for 
Energy Consumption and non-Coverage Ratio, respectively.
Figure 4. Non-Dominated Solutions of MOFPA
Tab І presents the definitions and the values of 
simulation parameters. The non-dominated solutions were 
close but not overlapping. Comparing the simulation results 
with the initial values, i.e. those of initial population, we can 
notice the amelioration offered by our approach in terms of 
the considered objective functions. Actually, the proposed 
approach was 38.62 and 2.86 times better in minimizing 
energy consumption and non-covered area, respectively.
In this work, the simulation results of MOFPA were 
compared with those of PSO algorithm [13] in different 
instances. PSO was tested by considering the same initial 
simulation parameters (See Tab І). Figure 5 and Figure 6
show the results of MOFPA compared with those of PSO 
algorithm.
Figure 5. Average of Coverage rate of non-dominated solutions
Figure 5 presents the average of coverage rate of non-
dominated solutions found after 1500 iterations of the two 
algorithms for different instances. We notice that the total 
coverage rate of RoI increases when the number of deployed 
nodes increases. The proposed approach outperforms the 
PSO in all instances and produces maximum coverage area.

Figure 6 presents the average of energy consumption of 
non-dominated solutions found after 1500 iterations of the

outperforms the PSO in all instances and  consumes 
minimum net energy.

CONCLUSION 
The multi-objective optimization algorithm aims to 
determine a set of optimal solutions which establish a trade-
off between the different objective functions. This paper 
presented a new multi-objective approach for node 
deployment problem in WSN. The proposed approach tried 
to deploy sensor nodes in the RoI while maximizing 
coverage area, minimizing energy consumption and 
maintaining net connectivity. Simulation results prove that 
MOFPA out-performs PSO as it allows better network in 
terms of both coverage and energy consumption. In a future 
work, we will incorporate other QoS metrics like sensor 
lifetime.
