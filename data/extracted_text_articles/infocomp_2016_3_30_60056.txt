Abstract— With the development of indoor positioning 
technology, the demand for accurate positioning is getting 
higher. 
Moreover, 
location 
determination 
technologies 
especially for indoor environments are getting a lot of attention. 
For more accurate positioning, the more accurate distance 
information 
should 
be 
determined. 
Existing 
distance 
determination methods using Received Signal Strength 
Indicator (RSSI) measurements are mostly processed by 
simple averaging. That has some limitations to remove variable 
noise sources. In this paper, we adopt Kalman filter to get 
more accurate distance information from RSSI measurements. 
Our proposed method improves distance measurement 
accuracy about 68.3% and 41.8%, respectively. 
Keywords- RSSI; Kalman filter.

 INTRODUCTION 
In the era of mobile internet services, Location Based 
Service (LBS) is one of key-role playing mobile services. 
Therefore, the position information of human or objects are 
getting more attention. At present, people can have position 
information from GNSS(Global Navigation Satellite System), 
A-GPS(Assisted GPS), TC-OFDM technology. Ultrasonic 
technology, Radio Frequency Identification technology 
(RFID), geomagnetic positioning technology, etc. [1][2]. 
 In outdoor environments, satellite navigation system 
such as GPS is the most reliable and accurate positioning 
system. However, almost 80 % of our ordinary daily life is 
executed in indoor environments. Therefore, we need an 
indoor positioning method showing stable and accurate 
performance just like outdoor GPS.  
Now, there are various indoor positioning methods using 
infrared, ultrasonic, Bluetooth, RFID, UWB and WLAN, etc. 
We can find out the common development trends of indoor 
positioning methods in 4 aspects. 
Aspect 1: Positioning accuracy improvement (nearing to 
that of GPS) 
Aspect 2: Positioning efficiency improvement 
Aspect 3:.Cost Reduction of indoor positioning signal 
coverage.  
Aspect 4: Fusion with outdoor positioning technology 
(for seamless positioning) 
Hence, we focus on indoor positioning method based on 
IEEE802.11 WLAN, which is the most widely spread 
wireless communication network.  
In Section II, we propose an RSSI measurement 
compensation method using Kalman filters. Simulation 
results and concluding remarks are given in Sections III and 
IV, respectively. 
II. 
PROPOSED METHOD 
 
In this paper, We propose a IEEE802.11 RSSI 
measurement compensating method for more precise indoor 
positioning by adopting Kalman filter. 
 
A. RSSI Attenuation Model 
The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) defines a 
measurement of RF energy and its unit is dBm. The RSSI is 
decreased exponentially as the distance from an AP (Access 
Point) is increased. Because of these characteristics, in this 
paper we used an RSSI attenuation model and it is given as 
[3][4] 
 
RSSI[dBm] = −10n log10
𝑑
𝑑0 + 𝐴               (1) 
d[m] = 10
RSSI−A
−10n  
                                (2) 
 
In (1), n is the attenuation factor, parameter A is the 
offset which is the measured RSSI value at a reference point 
(usually 1m) apart from the AP, and d is the distance from 
AP. These parameters reflect the indoor propagation 
environments. RSSI is a sensitive measurement which can be 
significantly affected by the environment. Fig. 1 shows that 
RSSI measurements are attenuated by log scale as distances 
are increased.  
In common situations, many factors can affect the RSSI 
value such as furniture, walls and pedestrians, etc. These 
factors can produce scattering signals and a multipath effect. 
Thus, it can result in positioning error. In order to reduce 
positioning error, proper parameter determination is 
necessary.

B. Kalman Filter 
Linear system state equation and measurement equation 
is as follows: 
x(k + 1) = F(k)x(k) + G(k)𝑢(𝑘) + 𝑣(𝑘)                   (3) 
z(k + 1) = H(k)𝑥(𝑘 + 1) + 𝜔(𝑘 + 1)                        (4) 
x(k) represents a state vector at time k. F(k) and G(k) are 
state matrix and input matrix, respectively. 𝑣(𝑘)  means 
process noise at time k. z(k) represents an output vector at 
time k. H(k) is measurement matrix. 𝜔(𝑘 + 1)  means 
measurement noise at time k+1. 
Kalman filtering procedures are made up of two 
processes such as prediction and state update [5]. Firstly, we 
predict state, measurement and covariance. After that, we 
calculate Kalman gain using predicted information at first 
step. Finally, we update state estimate and state covariance 
using Kalman gain.

𝑥̂(𝑘 + 1|𝑘) represents state estimate at time k+1 given 
measurements until time k. 𝑥̂(𝑘 + 1|𝑘 + 1) represents state 
estimate at time k+1 given measurements until time k+1. 
𝑧̂(𝑘 + 1|𝑘)  represents measurement estimate at time k+1 
given measurements until time k. P(k + 1|k) means error 
covariance matrix at time k given measurements until time k. 
Q(k) and R(k) are the covariance matrix of process noise and 
measurement noise, respectively. W(k) is the optimal 
Kalman gain.  
We define state vector x(k) with RSSI(k) and d(k), where 
RSSI(k) is the RSSI measurement at time k and d(k) is 
distance at time k. We made F(k), G(k) from the RSSI 
attenuation model given by Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). H(k) is 
defined as in (19). 
 
x(k) = [𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐼(𝑘)

SIMULATION RESULTS 
We assume the Kyungpook National University IT-1 
building’s first floor as simulation environments. This 
building has attenuation factor n which is 2.7. The process 
noise 𝑣(𝑘) is modeled uniform distribution. It has zero mean 
and 0.01 variance. Measurement noise 𝜔(𝑘) is modeled as 
Gaussian. It has zero mean and 2.12 variance. In this paper, 
we consider two simulation situations: one is regular step 
situation and the other is random step. Fig 2 is sectional view 
of Kyungpook National University IT-1 building 
Figure 2.  Kyungpook National University IT-1 Building (First Floor) 
In this simulation, we symbolize Measurement as 
existing distance determination method, which decides 
RSSI measurement at a point by averaging multi epoch 
RSSI measurements at the point. Also, we symbolize 
Estimation as the proposed distance calculation method. 
 Existing 
method 
(Measurement) 
determines 
the 
distance of a point by averaged multi epoch RSSI 
measurements around the point. On the other hand, 
Proposed method (Estimation) determines the distance of a 
point by Kalman filtered each epoch RSSI measurement 
around the point.

A. Regular  Step Situation 
Regular step situation means a movement with 0.1m 
distance in every second from 1m to 10m. Fig. 3 shows the 
regular step situation which goes away from AP, regularly.

Figure 4.  Distance Error of Measurem ent and  Estimation (Regular step) 
 
    Fig. 4 shows distance errors of Measurement and 
Estimation. The green line (Estimation) is closer to the zero 
line more than the blue line. For random step situation, the 
distance errors and variances of Measurement and 
Estimation are given in Table I, respectively.

The distance error of the proposed method (Estimation) is 
less than that of existing one (Measurement) by 0.56m. It 
means that for regular step situation, the proposed method 
(Estimation) will produce 68.3% less distance error, 
compared with existing method (Measurement).  
 
B. Random Step Situation 
Random step situation means a movement with random 
distance in every second. This random distance is modelled 
as Gaussian with 0 mean and 1.2 variance. Fig. 5 shows the 
random step situation which describes wandering around AP 
within 10m.

Fig. 6 shows distance errors of Measurement and 
Estimation. The blue

distance

from 
Measurement. The green line is distance error from 
Estimation. The green line is closer to the zero line than the 
blue line. For random step situation, the distance errors and 
variances of Measurement and Estimation are given in Table 
II, respectively.

The distance error of the proposed method (Estimation) is 
less than that of existing one (Measurement) by 0.77m. It 
also means that for random step situation, the proposed 
method (Estimation) will produce 41.8% less distance error, 
compared with existing method (Measurement).

IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we proposed an RSSI measurement 
compensation method using Kalman filter to reduce the 
calculated distance errors, which results in a more accurate 
indoor positioning. By estimating the noises in RSSI 
measurements using Kalman filter, we can compensate the 
estimated noises from RSSI measurements and calculate 
more precise distance information, which results in a more 
precise positioning. 
Simulation results for the two representative situations, 
regular step situation and random step one, show that the 
distance error of the proposed method (Estimation) can be 
improved over that of the existing method (Measurement) by 
68.3% and 41.8%, respectively.  
For future works, we are trying to classify indoor 
environments in more detail. Attenuation factor (n) and 
offset (A) of RSSI attenuation log model are dominantly 
dependent on applied environments. The RSSI attenuation 
log model, which is adapted to real indoor environment, will 
provide more accurate distance information.
