Abstract—In the broader context of increasing demands for 
energy associated with expanding population and urbanisation, 
green building measures are an effective approach to relief the 
conflict between lowering ecological footprints of buildings and 
their rapidly growing energy demand. This paper assesses the 
green building rating tools and the fraction of Energy criterion 
as contributor to green star rating. The options that can be 
applied to improve building’s energy consumption profile and, 
with that, contribute to greater green star rating of the 
building are further reviewed. Outdoor energy sources such as 
solar energy, as well as indoor energy sources, e.g. piezoelectric 
energy, are presented. The conclusion of this study is that it 
may be possible to achieve low carbon building footprint 
through the application of renewable energy sources, although 
some of the technologies remain as components of a concept 
that is yet to be fully and successfully demonstrated in practice.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Green building measures are defined as a sustainable, 
integrated approach, balancing environmental, economic, 
and social considerations with large scale of implemented 
innovative renewable technologies. However, the level of 
sustainability a building achieves is hard to be benchmarked.  
A range of building rating tools have been developed to 
complement the knowledge about the level of sustainability 
and these rating systems are still in the process of 
improvement [1]. The most widely used building rating 
methods 
are 
Building 
Research 
Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), Leadership 
in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), and Green 
Star [2, 3]; as summarised in Table 1.  
There are similarities between these three schemes. They 
assess the building against multiple criteria in different 
categories including Land Use & Ecology, Water, Energy, 
Materials, Health & Wellbeing, Waste & Pollution, 
Management and Innovation [4-6]. Secondly, all these 
schemes are based on credit collecting systems that 
determine the level of sustainability and hence the building’s 
rating classification [7]. Thirdly, all three rating tools have 
been developed into a series aimed at rating of a wide range 
of building types, both newly constructed and existing 
buildings [8]. All three rating methods are compared in Table 
1. It demonstrates that the building rating methods have 
differences in their methodologies, evaluation scopes, 
weighting in credits and certification processes.  
Among these worldwide building rating tools, a common 
acceptance should be noted that the weight of the Energy 
category has the most significant importance, accounting for 
nearly 25% of the total weightings. However, this may not 
be sufficient for buildings aiming for ultimate energy neutral 
or fully self-sustained. Under these circumstances, a recast of 
the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) will 
take force on 31 December 2018 by the European Parliament 
and the Council of the European Union in order to strengthen 
the energy performance requirements. The EPBD states that 
the nearly zero or very low amount of energy required 
should to a very significant level be covered by energy from 
renewable source, including renewable energy produced on-
site or nearby [9].  
According to the agreements among the building ratings, 
energy savings in the operating stage are believed to be the 
most substantial benefits of green buildings. A detailed 
review of 60 LEED rated buildings demonstrates that green 
buildings are on an average 25-30% more energy efficient 
compared to conventional buildings [10]. Energy savings in 
green building are achieved primarily by reducing electricity 
purchases from the power grid and secondly by reducing the 
peak energy demand. The reduced energy demand from 
power grids contributes to simultaneous reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. Li et al. [11] confirmed the 
energy saving potential by studying one of the most common 
green technologies, the photovoltaics panels in ofﬁce 
buildings. They found that when semi-transparent PV panels 
are used together with dimming controls, a peak cooling load 
reduction of 450 kW was achieved. This was equivalent to 
annual building electricity saving of 1203 MWh, which 
contributed a reduction of 12% of the annual building 
electricity expenditure.  
This evidence has indicated that the level of sustainability 
a building achieves is strongly coupled with the degree that 
renewable energy is integrated and utilised. The application 
of on-site renewable energy production provides possibility 
to reduce dependence on fossil fuel and mitigates emissions.  
II. 
OUTDOOR ENERGY SOURCES FOR BUILDINGS 
Renewable energy resources and their utilisation in 
buildings are key components of sustainable development  
[12]. In this context, the renewable energy resources and 
technologies applicable for integration into the green 
buildings are divided here into those that can generate energy 
from outdoor sources and indoor energy sources. One of the 
most important outdoor energy sources is solar radiation.

A. Solar-Electrical and Building Integrated Photovoltaic 
Solar energy is the most abundant and inexhaustible of 
all the renewable energy resources [13]. The amount of solar 
energy incident on the overall land area far exceeds the total 
world energy demand. Aside from the access and abundance 
of the solar resource, there are other positive features that 
make solar energy the ideal source of alternative energy. 
First, solar energy has the potential to provide electricity 
during peak demand times, due to the correlation between 
solar radiation and daytime peak electricity demand. Second, 
solar energy technologies have high compatibility and can be 
easily operated within other hybrid systems [14]. Third, solar 
technologies can offer distribution utilities ancillary services, 
such as grid support [15]. 
Photovoltaic (PV) is a technology used for generating 
electrical power by converting sunlight into direct current 
electricity using semiconductor materials. The PV system 
converts solar radiation into electricity that can be directly 
applied to power electronic appliances. Moreover, PV panels 
have no mechanically moving parts, hence are very easy to 
install and require very little maintenance. The overall cost-
benefits analysis of applying PV in buildings were studied 
through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the results were 
encouraging [16]. The carbon footprint of PV electricity is 
found to be favourable compared to the carbon footprint of 
electricity from fossil fuel based electricity and the energy 
payback time is significantly shorter than the expected 
lifetime of 30 years.  
The traditional way of installing PV panels on to 
buildings is named Building Adopted Photovoltaic (BAPV), 
by mounting PV modules to a separate metal support 
structure on the roof. In contrast to the BAPV, Building 
Integrated 
Photovoltaic 
(BIPV) 
is 
defined 
as 
an 
architecturally integrated building component: the electricity 
producing modules are both a functional unit of the building 
and also part of the exterior building envelope, since these 
modules replace conventional building materials [17]. The 
fields of BIPV application are the roof areas of the building 
as well as facades, such as vertical walls, skylights, windows 
and external shading devices depending to the particular 
features of the photovoltaic materials.  
With the development of Thin-Film (TF) technology, 
several types of TF modules with varied photovoltaic 
materials, such as amorphous (a-Si), micromorph (µm-Si), 
copper 
indium 
gallium 
selenide 
(CIGS), 
organic 
photovoltaics (OPV) and dye-sensitized cells (DSC) are 
accepted by the market due to their advanced features. For 
instance, by adding an encapsulating polymer of any colour 
or interferential coating, the TF modules can be tailor-made 
into any size and shape to satisfy the specific architectural 
requirements [18]. The coating and printing techniques 
which are known as the roll-to-roll printing technology, 
employed for the manufacture of the TF PV products, the 
manufacturing costs are expected to be much lower than the 
crystalline silicon solar cells in the next few years [19]. 
Furthermore, a prototype transparent photovoltaic cell with 
an ultrahigh visible transmission has been produced in the 
laboratory [20, 21]. By absorbing only infrared and 
ultraviolet light, letting visible light pass through the cells, 
the cell is able to reach a transmission of >55%±2%, which 
is sufﬁciently transparent for incorporation on architectural 
glass [20].  
BIPV systems significantly extend the solar collecting 
area from roof only to the whole building skin, converting 
the largest vertical areas such as exterior walls and windows 
into electricity generators. They provide a vast vertical area 
directly exposed to the bright morning and early evening 
sunlight and hence the total electricity yield will be 
significantly increased [22]. 
B. Building Suitable Small-Scale Wind Turbines 
Wind energy is an established and mature renewable 
energy alternative as it is clean, safe and available. However, 
the adaptability of mid-scale wind turbines in urban 
environment faces severe challenges because of the 
turbulence of the wind profile, noise pollution, limited size 
and space. In the past few years, many efforts have been 
made to harness wind energy and optimise the small-scale 
wind turbine performance. Until now, two main classified 
types of wind turbines, horizontal axis wind turbines 
(HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) are 
developed for the turbulent urban wind profile [23].  
HAWTs dominate the majority of the wind industry in 
urban environment [24], due to its extreme high efficiency in 
constant wind conditions. But because their axis of rotation 
of the blades is in a horizontal position, which needs to be 
pointed into the wind, the turbines are very sensitive for the 
wind direction changes. Moreover, the maximum size of 
HAWTs is strictly limited to 1.5-5 m in diameter, regarding 
the safety of wildlife and aircraft, esthetics and maintenance 
[25]. On the other hand, their counterparts VAWTs do not 
necessarily need to point in any particular wind direction. 
Since the main rotor shaft is arranged vertically, the vertical 
wind turbines can handle much higher turbulence and varied 
wind speeds and thus makes them much suitable in building 
mounting to overcome the turbulent nature of the wind in the 
urban environment. According to the size of building 
mounted wind turbines, the energy generating potential is 
reported from 100 W to 30 kW in the wind speed range from 
10-20 m/s [25]. 
III. 
INDOOR RENEWABLE ENERGY ALTERNATIVES 
A number of indoor renewable energies, such as waste 
heat, 
flowing 
water 
in 
internal 
drainage 
systems, 
electromagnetic waves and vibration, may also become 
important energy sources for buildings. 
A. Water flow energy harvesting 
Water flow is known as a useful source of mechanical 
energy which is essentially constant over extended period of 
time [26]. Water ﬂow energy sources in the outdoor 
environment are widespread and used on the macro scale for 
electrical power generation as in hydroelectric plants. The 
streams of water found in the indoor environments also offer 
a great potential for energy harvesting. For instance, the grey 
and black water in the water pipes of a building drain system, 
as well as the rain water collected by the rain harvesting

system which is installed on the building roof, have also 
been considered for smaller scale harvesting application. The 
hydro turbines that suit for small scale energy harvesting are 
designed and constructed according to the widely used large 
scale hydro turbines, Pelton (Figure 1a) and propeller (Figure 
1b) turbines respectively [27]. The Pelton turbine is rotated 
by a jet of water discharged from a nozzle and is connected 
to a shaft. The water stream from an upper tank or high 
gravitational potential area sluiced out through the nozzle 
pushing the shaft and hence the energy is harvested in the 
form of electricity. It has been confirmed that the required 
power from a sensor node, 160 mW was obtained for 
HQ=0.14 ml/s with an efficiency of 11.3%. The energy 
harvest system using propeller turbine has a simple 
configuration. The turbine directly installed in the middle of 
the water pipeline could be pushed rotating by the down 
flowing water. Based on the test result, the turbine produced 
900 mW of average power in a home irrigation system. In 
[28], a radial-flux energy harvester incorporating a three-
phase generation principle is proposed for converting energy 
from water flow in domestic water pipelines. The energy 
harvester is able to generate from 15 mW at a flow rate of 5 
l/min to 720 mW at 20 l/min. Therefore, it is possible to 
generate enough energy using very low water stream, 
without the need for energy storage.  
 
Figure 1. Hydro turbines: a) Pelton system; b) Propeller system. 
B. Kinetic Energy Harvesting  
The vibration-based energy harvesting, termed as 
piezoelectric energy generation, has received the most 
attention due to its ability to capture the surrounding ambient 
energy and then directly convert the applied strain energy 
into usable electrical energy and the ease at which they can 
be integrated into a system [29]. By connecting the energy 
harvester with a remote sensor, the harvest can be seen as an 
eternal energy source to replace the conventional battery, 
therefore eliminating the need for long term maintenance.  
At present, a cantilever type vibration energy harvester is 
the most commonly used design due to its simple structure 
and the feature that can produce a large deformation under 
vibration [30]. For this type of design, the majority of the 
cantilever beam piezoelectric harvesters are used in micro-
electro-mechanical system (MEMS) applications [31], 
aiming for vibration resources with high frequency and small 
mechanical stress. In order to extend receiving range of 
vibration frequency and to improve power conversion 
efficiency, a two-stage energy harvester design was 
suggested for the very low frequency vibration environment 
in the 0.2–0.5 Hz range [22], as shown in Figure 2a. This 
design contains two main components, a mechanical energy 
transfer unit linked with a vibration platform and secondary 
vibrating units composed of additional piezoelectric elements 
and vibrating beams fixed on one side. Ideally, when the 
initial impact effects on the platform, the mass attached on 
the mechanical energy transfer unit starts to vibrate in low 
frequency. The low vibration energy is then transferred to a 
much higher natural frequency vibration in the piezoelectric 
elements as the mass passes over and excites the 
piezoelectric beams. 
 
Figure 2. Two designs of the piezoelectric system: a) a two-stage energy 
harvesting approach based on the cantilever system [32]; b) a stack type 
piezoelectric harvester [33]. 
 
A stack type piezoelectric harvester is produced by 
stacking multiple layers of piezoelectric materials, as shown 
in Figure 2b. This results in a high mechanical stiffness in 
the stack configuration. Compared to the cantilever 
configuration, the stack type possesses a large capacitance 
and a higher capability of energy harvesting. It is suitable for 
a high force environment, such as a heavy manufacturing 
facility or in areas of large operating machinery [34]. With 
these features, the stack type piezoelectric harvester breaks 
the limitation from micro-scale energy harvesting in MEMS 
to macro-scale energy generation. In Israel, Innowattech has 
tested this type of energy harvester on highway to collect 
kinetic energy from passing cars as well as railways [35]. In 
the ideal conditions, the system is able to generate up to 200 
kWh in every kilometre, which is enough to satisfy the 
energy demands from more than 800 families.  
To date, several piezoelectric power generating products 
have been released to the market by different companies 
[32], such as Pavegen, Waynergy and Powerleap. The 
Pavegen 
piezoelectric 
harvester, 
Pavegen 
Tile, 
was 
demonstrated at the London 2012 Olympic Games. Twelve 
tiles were installed on a temporary walkway connecting the 
Station to the Greenway walking route at the Olympic Park. 
It was estimated that these tiles would receive more than 12

million impressions from footfalls, generating 72 million 
joules of energy, which equals to 21 kWh of electricity. This 
amount of electricity was enough to illuminate the walkway 
for eight hours at full power during the night, and 16 daylight 
hours at half power [36]. A similar test was conducted at the 
University of Beira Interior. The Waynergy People prototype 
was deployed in the pavement at the main entrance of the 
Engineering Faculty. It was confirmed that 525 Joules or 
0.15 Watt-hours of electric energy was harvested from 675 
human steps by the Waynergy system during a peak hour, 
between 9 am and 10 am [37]. 
IV. 
ENERGY PRODUCTION FROM WASTES 
Activities within the buildings contribute to considerable 
generation of organic waste that can be considered as a 
biomass and used for conversion into useful forms of energy. 
The main technologies for biomass processing can be 
classified into three categories: thermo-chemical, bio-
chemical and mechanical extraction. There are three optional 
processes included in the method of thermochemical 
conversion: combustion, gasification and pyrolysis; while 
under the biochemical conversion category, there are two 
technologies available, which are digestion and fermentation. 
In the following, thermochemical pyrolysis and biochemical 
anaerobic digestion are introduced as two promising indoor 
renewable energy generating technologies. 
A. Pyrolysis - A Thermo-Chemical Conversion 
Pyrolysis is a method that converts biomass to more 
useful fuel products [38]. Under pyrolytic conditions 
biomass is heated to maximum temperatures of 450–500
