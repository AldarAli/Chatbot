Abstract—The next 5th generation mobile network, or 5G key 
concepts, scenarios and requirements are actively debated in 
the research community. In this context, it is interesting to 
estimate a tentative 5G penetration rate, i.e., the mobile 
community of 5G users. In this paper, we focus on the initial 
5G penetration, i.e., proportion of people who are willing to use 
the 5G networks, when the first 5G equipment is projected to 
be deployed, around the year 2020. The 5G penetration rate 
can be used as an input parameter for business viability, traffic 
estimation and network planning/dimensioning related to the 
5G network infrastructure. The 5G penetration level will be 
country-specific; it may be different in different countries. We 
assume that the initial 5G penetration will depend on the 
penetration rate of the previous wave of the mobile wireless 
technology, which is called “fourth generation” (4G), or Long 
Term Evolution (LTE). Finland, currently, has the highest 
LTE penetration rate in Western Europe. As a case study, we 
estimate a number of potential users of the 5G network in 
Finland by 2020. In our approach we use relationships between 
mobile penetration rate, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per 
capita, inequality of income distribution within population, 
and the Pareto law.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
So far, new technologies for mobile wireless networking 
have been deployed once in about ten years. The 
appearances of a new generation equipment on the market 
happened roughly in: 1981 (termed 1G, or first generation), 
1991 (2G), 2001 (3G) and 2011 (4G). The fifth generation 
(5G) is expected to emerge around 2020-2021.  
Even though the 5G mobile network is not defined yet in 
any official specification or standard, issues related to 
advanced 5G network infrastructure provoke intense interest 
in research community, e.g., within the framework of the 
Horizon 2020 European programme [19] for research and 
innovation. Please note that the exact time when the 5G 
technology will be introduced is still uncertain. We shall 
assume that it is the year 2020 in this paper.  
The main factors/drivers towards 5G that should be taken 
into account are: (i) demand for services/applications from 
different groups of end-users in the 2020 time frame, i.e., 
competitive market impact; (ii) Gain/cost ratio related to new 
innovations/technologies/solutions/business 
models; 
(iii) 
existing limitations of frequency bands and spectral 
bandwidth; (iv) political factors that can impose some 
restrictions on innovative solutions.  
The first 5G networks are projected to be deployed 
around the year 2020. For the first three factors, it can be 
useful to estimate the potential number of people that are 
ready to become 5G subscribers by that time. The 5G 
penetration rate will be different for each country. In this 
paper, we select Finland as a country for our case study. 
Finland has the highest LTE penetration level between 
countries of Western Europe in 2013 [1]. We estimate a 
potential number of 5G users in the country and the 5G 
density in its two largest urban areas by 2020. This is the 
main contribution of the short paper. To the best to our 
knowledge, there has been no prior work in literature 
showing how to estimate 5G penetration rate by 2020.  
 
Figure 1.  Penetration process R of current and next generation 
technology/service among the affluent part of the population. When 60 % 
to 80 % of the wealthy have “current generation” networking technology, it 
is time to introduce the “next generation.” Then the whole group of affluent 
“current generation” users becomes the initial group of potential “next 
generation” users. 
Our main premises are that first, the potential 5G 
subscribers initially come from the affluent subgroup of the 
population where the 4G penetration is much higher than the 
average. Second, the penetration of technology/service 
including telecommunication services follows the logistic 
function [2]-[4]. (Please note that qualitatively this function 
has three distinct phases: initial exponential growth up to 
20%, almost linear growth up to 80%, and the final 
saturation stage [9].) We shall assume that when the new 5G 
technology is introduced, the penetration level of the 
previous, 4G technology among that wealthy (affluent)

subgroup will be between 60 % and 80 % that corresponds to 
the second part of the linear phase of the logistic curve (i.e., 
the greatest demand for the current technology/service [2] 
[10]). These assumptions are schematically illustrated in Fig. 
1. The idea is that the wealthy (affluent) subgroup of people 
in the general population will be ready for the new 5G 
service when most of their wealthy peers have adopted the 
existing 4G technology.  
We estimate the size R of that subgroup based on 
relationships between the Pareto law [5], Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) per capita, inequality of income distribution 
within population, and the 4G penetration rate. 
It is worthwhile also to note that methods similar to ours 
were applied to estimate a demand for telecommunication 
services in the past. For instance, the number of Integrated 
Services Digital Network (ISDN) users in several developed 
countries was estimated in [3][4]. Today, the results of these 
estimations seem quite plausible. In particular, very low 
demand for ISDN was predicted. It was estimated that the 
number of ISDN users even in developed countries had to be 
around 5-6% from the number of Public Switched Telephone 
Network (PSTN) users that corresponded with the real 
situation those years.  
The rest of the paper is divided into three sections. The 
next section describes briefly the approach to evaluate the 
expected number of 5G users. Section III presents the case 
study related to estimating 5G penetration level in Finland by 
2020. Finally, Section IV concludes the paper.  
II. 
APPROACH FOR ESTIMATING 5G PENETRATION RATE 
In this section, we estimate the proportion of wealthy 
people in the population (potential 5G users) from the 
penetration level µ of 4G users and the Pareto parameter α. 
Then we show how α itself can be derived from µ. 
It is argued in [2]-[4] that the demand for services 
depends on both GDP and its distribution within society and 
there 
is 
the 
relationship 
between 
a 
demand 
for 
telecommunication services, labour productivity, distribution 
of incomes between individuals, and GDP per capita. In 
particular, it is shown in [4] that the relationship between a 
telecommunication demand and income distribution is close 
to the Pareto law [5].  
If X is a random variable with a Pareto (Type I) 
distribution, then the probability that X is greater than some 
number x is given by [5]

where R(x) can be expressed as the proportion of individuals 
who have income more than x, and α is the distribution 
parameter, called the Pareto parameter or the tail index. 
(Please note that a range of small incomes has very small 
influence on statistical characteristics of income distribution 
[3]-[5].) 
The income x in (1) is a normalized value that is equal to 
the ratio g/gmin, where g is one of income values, gmin is the 
minimum income value in a population.  
The minimum income value may be expressed as 
gmin()=g0/L(), where g0 is the average value of personal 
annual 
income, 
that 
is 
GDP 
per 
capita, 
and 
L(is the average value of the normalized 
income. Thus, the expression (1) for estimating the number 
of individuals who have income more than x = g/gmin takes 
the following form:

It is shown by Varakin [3] that the linear dependence 
takes place between the average amount of produced 
information generated by society per an individual in a 
country and its GDP per capita. Mobile telecommunications 
(as a part of society and economical infrastructure) impact on 
economic development [6]. Conversely, the economic 
development of a country determines its level of mobile 
telecommunications [7]. As a result, there is a relationship 
between a telecommunication/mobile penetration level and 
GDP per capita, that is generally assumed to be linear 
[3][4][6][7]. In our case, we also suppose that there is linear 
dependence between the penetration level of 4G users and 
GDP per capita g0 (in the first approximation).  
Mathematically, this relationship may be presented as  
  A g0
, 
(3) 
where µ = N4G/100 is the penetration level of 4G users, N4G 
is the average number of users that have subscriptions for 4G 
per 100 individuals, and A is the normalizing dimension 
factor that is country-specific.  
Since parameters µ and g0 are the average values 
obtained by averaging many input data, in general case, it is 
also plausible that the penetration level T of 4G technology 
in the subgroup of the affluent individuals follows the 
relation T = Ag1, where is g1 is some income within the 
affluent group, and A is the same normalizing factor as in 
(3). 
Thus, the ratio between the parameters is

(4) 
where the coefficient k determines the excess of the 
penetration level of 4G subscribers in the affluent subgroup 
above the average value of the 4G penetration level in the 
total population. 
As mentioned in Introduction, we assume that T is 
between 60 % and 80 % (i.e., k is between 0.6/µ and 0.8/µ.) 
when 5G is introduced. Then, the whole group of affluent 4G 
users becomes the group of potential 5G users.  
Based on equation (2) and the above assumption, the 
expression to determine the relative number of individuals 
who have the 4G penetration level more or equal than the 
parameter µ, or, in other words, the expression to estimate 
the relative number of the affluent 4G users or the potential 
5G users (R) by the time when new generation is launched

forecasts of 4G penetration level µ in a region may be found 
in statistical literature. For instance, in the European Union 
report [1], the forecast related to the 4G penetration level in 
different Western European countries is presented up to 
2020. But, to compute R according to equation (5), we also 
need to estimate somehow the Pareto parameter α at the time 
when the new, 5G technology is introduced. 
In the rest of this section, we will show a way to estimate 
α from µ.  
Generally, the parameter α depends on the inequality of 
income distribution between individuals. In our case, this 
parameter depends on the inequality of distribution of the 
number of 4G subscribers between individuals. The 
inequality of income distribution in a subgroup of individuals 
is described by the Lorenz curves [8]. In Fig. 2, the Lorenz 
curves show relationships between the current average 
income value in a subgroup of population Q and the number 
of individuals in the subgroup F for several values of α [18]. 
In particular, the set of the Lorenz curves illustrates that 
with increasing the parameter value α income in a subgroup 
is becoming more evenly distributed.

To estimate the Pareto parameter α for the expression (5), 
it is needed to approximate the function describing the 
broken line Q(µ,F) by the function (6) Q(α,F) corresponding 
to the Pareto distribution with the parameter α. It can be done 
by means of the Gini coefficient [8] W related to each of 
these functions. It is equal twice the area between the Lorenz 
curve and the line of equality, i.e., W = 1- µ and W = (2α-1)-1 
for Q(µ,F) and Q(α,F), respectively [18].  
As a result of this approximation, the Pareto parameter α 
can be expressed as function of the penetration level µ:

where N is the population size in a region. 
Thus, the expressions (4), (5), (7), and (8) give a basis to 
estimate the number of potential 5G users in a region.  
III. 
CASE STUDY 
In this case study, we estimate a number of the potential 
subscribers of 5G networks in Finland by 2020 using the 
presented approach.  
According to statistical information, 5.44 million people 
live in Finland (2013) [11]. The projection of the population 
growth in years 2010-2060 [12] predicts a number of 
inhabitants in the country by 2020 as 5.64 million (N).  
Fig. 3 shows the forecast of LTE residential penetration 
of Western Europe up to 2020 presented in the EC report [1] 
(based on the Analysys Mason research [16]).  
In accordance with it the penetration level of 4G (LTE) 
users in Finland (µ) is estimated as 32% by 2020. Then, 
applying the expressions (4), (5), (7), (8) we can evaluate the 
relative and absolute number of potential 5G users for 
Finland in 2020.  
If T = 0.8 (conservative value), the relative number of 
potential 5G users in the country may be estimated as  
R(k, α) = R (2.5, 1.23) = 0.04. It means that just 4% of 
people in Finland will be willing in 2020 to use the 5G 
network infrastructure to get their services. The absolute 
number of 5G subscribers in this case is around 0.22 million. 
 
Figure 3.  Residential penetration of LTE in Western Europe [Source: 
Analysys Mason] 
If T = 0.6 (optimistic value), the relative number of 
tentative 5G users in Finland is equal to R(k, α) = R (1.9, 
1.23) = 0.06. In this case, 6% of Finish citizenships can be 
ready to become the 5G subscribers. It corresponds to 0.34 
million people. Note that these values are initial numbers of 
potential 5G subscribers by 2020 and can be considered as 
lower limits.  
It should be taken into account that population 
distribution in Finland throughout of the country is not

uniform. People are mainly concentrated in the large urban 
areas. If we take the Helsinki metropolitan area (Helsinki, 
Vantaa, Espoo and Kauniainen) [13] and the Tampere urban 
area, the population of these two regions equals 1.4 million 
(1.1 and 0.3 million, correspondingly [14]). This is around 
26% of the current 5.44 million Finland’s population. The 
Gini coefficient value for Finland is very low (W is 25.9 
[15]). It means more or less equal income distribution 
between country residents. Then, we can roughly assume 
that there is no big difference in income distribution level 
between these two regions and the rest of the country. Thus, 
we can suppose that 26% of all potential 5G users are 
concentrated in the Helsinki and Tampere urban regions. 
As a rule, people in large cities have larger income and a 
share of 5G users for these two areas can be taken even a bit 
higher than 26%. But, we focus on a lower bound of the 5G 
penetration rate in this paper. In the absolute values, the 
number of potential 5G users in Helsinki and Tampere urban 
areas by 2020 is forecasted in accordance with the proposed 
approach to be between 60 thousand (conservative value) 
and 90 thousand (optimistic value). These two urban areas 
cover an area of about 1000 km2 [13][14]. That is, the 
density of 5G users by 2020 in this territory is expected 
around 60~90 users/km2. 
Definitely, only the future can confirm or disprove the 
estimations. However, it is interesting what happens if we 
would apply this approach to the past statistical information 
to estimate the number of 3G users based on 2G penetration 
level. On the one hand, the penetration level of 2G mobile 
phones in Finland in 2000 was 72% [17]. The first network 
equipment of UMTS (3G) was deployed in the beginning of 
2000s. The initial penetration percent of mobile Internet 
phone (3G) in Finland was 22% [17]. On the other hand, if 
we use the presented methodology, then the relative number 
of 3G users had to be R(k, α) = R (1.11, 2.29) = 0.21 (T=0.8), 
i.e., around 21%, which is very close to the actual 3G 
penetration rate at the time.  
Note that the 4G penetration forecast (Fig. 3) ends in 
2020. If the 4G prediction would be known also for later 
years (for instance, up to 2025), then using the proposed 
methodology it may be possible to get the long-term 
dynamic forecast of 5G user growth.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented an approach to estimate 
a tentative 5G penetration rate by 2020 when the first 5G 
network equipment is planned to be deployed. As a case 
study, we evaluated this parameter for Finland, but the 
approach can be applied also for other countries if 
corresponding statistical information is available. Though 
Finland is one of more promising countries in this context (it 
is predicted to have the highest LTE penetration in Western 
Europe), initial level of 5G penetration rate by 2020 is 
expected to be only around 4~6 % of the total number of 
inhabitants. The density of 5G users in two largest urban 
areas (Helsinki and Tampere) is also forecasted to be quite 
low, 60~90 users/km2. These estimated values indicate a 
starting point of 5G penetration process.  
To conclude, it is not worthwhile to expect an initial 
demand for 5G services at a level of 20-30% as it was when 
the first 3G network services became available. It is needed 
also to be cautious with regard to the density of 5G users per 
km2 even in urban environment in the 2020 time frame. It is 
reasonable to support concentrating initial 5G deployment in 
“strategic” places like city centres and shopping malls. 
The presented approach can help in issues related to 
traffic load estimations in 5G networks, network planning 
and network dimensioning aspects, in assessing the potential 
revenue from 5G subscriptions at the first stages of 5G 
network deployment.
