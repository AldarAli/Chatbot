Abstract- Covid-19 pandemic obliged scholars to scrutinize 
new privacy concerns due to the use of digital contact 
tracing applications. Considering that we are living in the 
digital age, the type of privacy safeguards that data 
controllers need to take should be thoroughly investigated. 
Although the main goal of these applications is to tackle the 
spread of the pandemic in society, the privacy rights of 
users must also be preserved. Otherwise, serious privacy 
risks might appear when the pandemic is eventually over. 
This paper aims to contribute to this discussion by 
addressing the potential questions related to the privacy 
risks of contact tracing applications from technical and 
organizational measures perspectives and thus to provide a 
contribution to the use of privacy-preserving contact 
tracing applications within the European Economic Area 
(EEA).

I. INTRODUCTION  
 
There are many samples in the history of medicine, ranging 
from AIDS to Ebola, where tracing methods were conducted to 
determine symptomatic people and, where required, employ 
isolation strategies [1]. Traditional contact tracing, where a 
public health official interviews an infected person to determine 
the places and people they met, is still in place [2]. Contact 
tracing, identifying individuals that have been in contact with an 
infected person, is a key component in tackling the spread of 
infectious illnesses [3]. The tasks conducted by contact tracing 
applications could be accumulated into 3 groups: detection of 
contact events (proximity tests), transmission, and exposure 
notification [4]. Accordingly, contact tracing applications have 
played an important role in controlling the spread of Covid in 
society. However, there are some privacy concerns among users 
about the use of these applications, which will be reviewed in 
this paper. Accordingly, the European Data Protection Board 
(EDPB) published a guideline about contact tracing applications 
[5]. Additionally, the European Commission published a 
communication about contact tracing applications [6] to 
establish certain points to consider for data controllers during 
their use of these applications in addition to the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR)[7]. This idea paper briefly 
addresses the privacy concerns stemming from the use of contact 
tracing applications within the EEA and mentions the 
importance of privacy safeguards that could play an important 
role in mitigating these concerns. Accordingly, in Section 2, 
concerns and risks about contact tracing applications will be 
addressed. Subsequently, in Section 3 privacy implications of 
the applications’ architectural choice applications will be briefly 
analyzed. Finally, in Section 4, technical and organizational 
measures will be elaborated, and potential solutions will be 
evaluated. 
II. CONCERNS AND RISKS ABOUT CONTACT TRACING 
APPLICATIONS 
 
The increased use of the Internet, together with rapid 
advances in technology, has changed the way in which 
information about users is gathered, stored, and exchanged was 
detailed [8]. Having said that, in order to fight with pandemic 
efficiently, individuals should trust the privacy features of the 
applications, thereby downloading these applications to their 
mobile phones. However, mobile applications possess, as seen, 
both 
certain advantages and ambiguous 
aspects [9]. 
Applications for contact tracing can be broadly divided into two 
categories [10]. In the centralized system, public institutions 
gather data on a single server, where data matching takes place 
[11]. The unique codes generated by a contact event are stored 
on each person's device in the decentralized approach instead of 
being sent to a centralized server [12]. While the centralized 
approach assumes that individual user data which could be 
leaked through the application is the most notable risk, the 
decentralized approach assumes that the compromising of all the 
user data in one location is the largest risk [13]. Therefore, it is 
plausible to say that each method is subject to a certain amount 
of risks. Generally, there are two types of privacy risks to an 
individual when we consider exposure notification applications, 
these are namely identity privacy, in which situation user 
individuals would not desire their identity to be shared without 
their affirmation) and location privacy, which response to the 
case where the individual would not desire other people may be 
able to link the various locations they visited to discover location 
history, without their consent) [14]. Hence, citizens who live in 
the community and download contact tracing applications to 
their mobile phones due to the Covid pandemic are concerned 
about being tracked by data controllers that process this personal 
data processed via the Global Positioning System (GPS). 
Tracking patients with Covid-19 and activities of contact 
persons could cause a breach of their privacy [15]. Furthermore, 
processing location data has further consequences because it 
would enable businesses to collect the data to learn about the 
movements of individuals and draw conclusions about 
preferences and habits [16]. Although contact tracing systems 
do not explicitly collect or record the true identities of individual 
users, movement proﬁles based on pseudonymous tracing data 
make it possible to identify a large fraction of users with a high 
probability [17].  
 
In summary, although there are plenty of advantages 
generated by contact tracing applications, there are also a few 
vulnerabilities in terms of privacy aspects thereof. In the

following sections, this paper addresses these concerns by 
mentioning the safeguards that could be used.   
III. ARCHITECTURE OF THE APPLICATIONS AND 
PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS THEREOF 
 
Processing activities with centralized or decentralized 
protocols do have several implications for data controllers and 
data subjects. There is a need to understand the logic of 
decentralized and centralized processing. To track infected 
people and alert those who have come into touch with them, the 
centralized approach entrusts a central server with user 
information [18].  In contrast, the decentralized strategy relies 
on users' phones to keep user data and alert them, in case they 
are exposed to an infectious person[19]. Either choice of 
architecture brings advantages as well as disadvantages in terms 
of privacy, as already discussed in the relevant literature. 
However, more privacy-preserving technologies are required to 
mitigate the aforementioned risks rather than centralized or 
decentralized protocol discussion. For instance, many experts 
favored Bluetooth technology to prevent any sort of location-
tracking-related risk. Similarly, the EPDB is in favor of the idea 
that the priority should be to process it without collecting 
localization data via Bluetooth [20]. These secure means of 
tracking are in line with the privacy-preserving perspective.  
IV. TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES 
      The EDPB recommended the adoption of both centralized 
and decentralized systems, provided that adequate security 
measures are implemented [21]. This perspective brought by 
the EDPB is quite useful for grasping the significance of 
adequate security measures implemented by data controllers. 
Also, as mentioned by the Commission, in general, the degree 
of security should match the amount and sensitivity of personal 
data processed [22]. Therefore, in order to control privacy and 
data protection risks and manage ethical concerns, this 
necessitates taking into consideration and combining the most 
efficient legal, organizational, and technical safeguards, 
including cutting-edge statistical and computational measures 
[23]. Accordingly, as per the EDPB Guidance, modern 
cryptographic techniques must be used to protect the data that 
is stored on servers and in applications, communications 
between the remote server and the apps [24]. EDPB also 
mentions the requirement of mutual authentication between 
servers and applications required [25]. These measures are 
feasible, as they have already been used for different types of 
digital applications by data controllers for years. However, 
considering the evolving nature of privacy threats, in addition 
to technical and organizational measures set out under article 
32-1 of the GDPR and proposed by the EDPB, some tailor-
made options could solidify the quality of these measures. For 
instance, blockchain technology, which is an open and shared 
database, over which no single party has control, and 
transactions, which include messages exchanged when two 
devices come into close contact, are safely recorded in blocks  
[26], could be useful for digital contact tracing, as proposed by 
Klaine and colleagues. As they mentioned, due to the fact that 
blockchain does not rely on a central server, this can enable 
global access to information while simultaneously being more 
resistant to harmful attacks [27]. Hence, considering that 
blockchain is now being used in keeping health records of 
patients in preserving their overall medical history without any 
involvement of service providers [28], it is also possible to 
generate a privacy-preserving, and feasible solution by 
implementing blockchain measures for the European contact 
tracing applications.  
      More of a generic solution to mitigate other unexpected 
privacy-related threats not listed in section II, hiring subject 
matter experts specifically devoted to implementing technical 
and organizational measures and designating contractual 
safeguards with third-party suppliers or vendors within the 
scope of cyber security activities could enhance the security 
capabilities of data controllers. In particular, considering 
safeguards for third-party vendors involved in any process of 
contact tracing applications are of massive importance to 
provide oversight on activities of data processors in line with 
article 28 of the GDPR. To this end, due to it is prevalent use 
and cost-efficient nature in many other fields, standard 
contractual 
clauses 
between 
controller 
and 
processor 
introduced by the EU Commission [29] could be an efficient 
safeguard for stipulating the required tailor-made safeguards 
that processors must implement. By this, it would be possible 
to generate a feasible solution for the implementation of 
required technical and organizational measures by third-party 
data processors as well, in order to mitigate any potential risk 
related to the involvement of third parties.  
      Last but not least, detailed and recurring data protection 
impact assessments could be an efficient way to determine 
privacy-related risks, regardless of the architectural design of 
the applications. Privacy risks associated with data regarding 
identifiable individuals can be mitigated in great part by using 
de-identification 
techniques 
in 
conjunction 
with 
reidentification procedures [30]. In order to have more privacy-
friendly applications for any future case scenarios, all these 
safeguards should keep being implemented from a privacy-by-
design perspective. The principle of Privacy by Design supports 
the idea that privacy should be deemed as a first-class citizen in 
the technology design and ought to be intensely inserted, as 
described by Besik and Freytag [31].  
As a positive sign of compliance with these requirements, 
almost each of the data controllers in the EEA pays attention to 
these aforementioned risks and technical and organizational 
safeguards, based on their privacy policies. For instance, as a 
few samples of many successful ones, the Estonian application 
[32] properly indicates the third-party companies involved in 
the process, while at the same time and the Lithuanian 
application [33], displays the details of permissions and 
features the application requires. Likewise, the Italian 
application shared on the documentation website many 
important aspects related to the security of the application, such 
as privacy-preserving analytics, security document, and design 
information with the users [34]. 
Therefore, it is plausible to state that designing contact tracing 
applications with security and privacy considerations based on 
the potential vulnerabilities described in section II is important 
to diminishing any potential risks posed to data subjects.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
         Implementation of efficient technical and organizational 
safeguards, as well as a privacy-by-design approach, are of key 
importance to the success of contact tracing applications. 
Therefore, if efficient safeguards are put in place by data 
controllers of contact tracing applications, the type of 
architecture of applications will not have a massive impact on 
the level of privacy protection by merely itself, as the main goal 
of these applications is to block the spread of the virus 
throughout society, rather than tracking people movement or 
processing an excessive amount of their personal data. 
Accordingly, as a positive sign of this perspective, almost each 
of the data controllers within the EEA acts responsibly to 
comply with the GDPR requirements and other relevant 
guidance. For the path forward, in case such tracking 
applications are required again, it is diligent to implement such 
necessary safeguards elaborated in section IV of this paper, in 
addition to the existing safeguards that are already put in place 
by data controllers, to maintain privacy-preserving technology.
