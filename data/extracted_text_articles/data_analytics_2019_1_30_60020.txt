Abstract — Traditional Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) 
methods require bridge inspectors to manually inspect each 
bridge periodically (usually every two years) and recommend 
maintenance or rehabilitation services to the bridge if necessary. 
As limited manpower and budget constraints are the two major 
shortfalls in traditional SHM methods, in addition to potential 
human errors and lack of consistency, more rigorous and 
frequent solutions are needed to assess the health levels of 
bridges and provide needed recommendations. In this work, we 
process a new population-based approach that employs the 
concept of Correlation Networks to evaluate the status of each 
bridge based on general parameters as well as how it compares 
to other similar bridges. We propose a Correlation Network 
Model (CNM) that builds a network of bridges, based on time-
series data on sufficiency ratings, for a population of 9,546 “steel 
bridges with stringer/multi-beam or girder design,” taken from 
the U.S. National Bridge Inventory (NBI) database. We apply 
Markov Clustering Algorithms to produce clusters of bridges 
with similar features associated with their fitness ratings over 
user-defined periods of time. The top five clusters are identified 
and further analyzed using population analysis algorithms. We 
were able to identify three clusters with lower fitness ratings and 
suggest that the bridges in these clusters need to be serviced 
sooner than those included in the other clusters. Experimental 
results show that the proposed model provides an efficient 
approach that allows domain experts to assess the structural 
health of bridges/civil infrastructures in a robust way that can 
guide rehabilitation services for all bridges and identify 
potentially unsafe bridges that need urgent attention.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The National Bridge Inventory (NBI) database consists 
of information on more than 600,000 bridges of the United 
States of America (USA), with each bridge dataset 
comprising 116 parameters. After each inspection cycle, 
usually every two years, the bridge inspectors develop 
condition ratings of the bridges as specified by the U.S. 
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) [1]. Sufficiency 
Rating (SR) is an outcome parameter/measure which reflects 
the overall fitness rating of the bridge and is derived from 
over 20 NBI data fields/parameters grouped in four factors, 
i.e., 
Structural Evaluation, Functional Obsolescence, 
Essentiality to the Public Use, and Special Reductions as 
described in the FHWA coding guide [2]. SR ranges between 
0% and 100 % or between 0 and 1000.  Lower 
percentages/ratings indicate that the bridge fitness is low and 
higher percentages/ratings indicate that the bridge is highly 
fit. SHM is a process of implementing a damage detection 
and characterization strategy for engineering structures [3]. 
Traditional SHM methods require bridge inspectors to 
manually inspect each bridge over a period of time and 
recommend maintenance or rehabilitation services to the 
bridge if necessary. As limited manpower, budget 
constraints, and lack of consistent and continuous monitoring 
are the major shortfalls in traditional SHM, research 
communities are interested in new solutions to assess the 
structural health of civil infrastructures while taking 
advantage of the massive data available in the NBI database. 
In this work, we propose the use of Correlation Network 
Models (CNMs). CNM is a powerful big-data tool that has 
recently been used to analyze and visualize complex systems 
having large data with multiple dimensions/parameters in 
various domains [12], [17], [18]. We propose to employ 
CNM to create a correlation network of bridges, based on the 
time-series data of bridges’ overall fitness rating, such as SR 
for a population of 9,546 “steel bridges with stringer/multi-
beam or girder design” obtained from the NBI database. 
These bridges are taken from three US states: California, 
Iowa, and Nebraska, which come from three different 
climatic regions as shown in Figure 1.  We then apply a 
Markov Clustering algorithm, such as MCL to obtain clusters 
of bridges that have similarity in their fitness ratings (such as 
SRs) over a certain period of time.  
Our basic hypothesis is that the bridges with similar 
fitness characteristics are included in common groups or 
clusters. MCL is a graph-based efficient algorithm designed 
based on the random walks property of the graphs. As every 
clustering method groups elements with similar attribute 
values together [16], when applied to the bridge correlation 
network, MCL finds clusters of bridges with similar behavior 
in terms of SRs.  We identified the top clusters produced by 
the algorithm for further analysis. We were able to identify 
clusters with lower fitness ratings that need to be serviced

relatively soon compared to bridges in other groups. Our 
experimental results show that the proposed approach 
provides a new efficient tool that allows bridge owners to 
evaluate the structural health of bridges/civil infrastructures 
and identify the structures that need immediate attention. 
This may serve as the main component of a new SHM 
decision support system.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II provides a general background, where the need for 
creating a Correlation Network of bridges with time-series 
data of SRs is discussed. Section III discusses the key 
concepts used for creating Correlation Networks and the 
population analysis approach, followed by a discussion on 
how network models are used in various application 
domains. Section IV includes the complete methodology 
used to implement the proposed approach. Section V 
discusses the experimental results of the study. Conclusions 
and future directions are summarized in Section VI.  
 
II.  BACKGROUND 
Several researchers have recently attempted to develop 
deterministic and stochastic deterioration models for various 
bridge components, such as Deck, Superstructure and 
Substructure, and Average Daily Traffic [4]. Several studies 
have used Two-Step clustering, a powerful data mining tool, 
to study concrete deck parameters in the NBI database to 
identify the order in which bridges need to be serviced [5]. 
While there are some deterioration models that are based on 
temporal data [4], [6], but they usually consider only one or 
few input ratings, such as Deck Rating or Superstructure 
Rating, for their analysis. Since they did not consider a 
holistic approach or compound rating measures such as SR 
(which is a complex measure based on multiple parameters), 
their models are somewhat limited and lack robustness and 
consistency. For example, such models can explain how 
Deck Rating changes over a period of time but fail to measure 
the overall safety of bridges as a whole. To estimate the 
overall fitness ratings of bridges, we are proposing a 
population analysis model that is based on the complex SR 
measure. Again, as various models consider temporal data of 
selected input ratings, they are useful in estimating ratings of 
individual elements but fail in estimating the overall fitness 
ratings of bridges [4], [5], [6].

On the other hand, there are models, that could consider the 
overall fitness rating as their measure in predicting the health 
of civil infrastructures [7], [18], but they do not utilize time 
series data. Hence, obtained predictions may not be accurate 
or do not really characterize the overall behavior of the 
bridges over a period of time. Therefore, there is a need for a 
model that considers bridges’ overall behavior or fitness 
ratings over a period of time and identifies the categories of 
bad bridges with respect to their fitness ratings.  
 
A. Correlation Network Model (CNM) 
As mentioned earlier in the introduction section, the NBI 
database has information on more than 600,000 bridges, each 
with 116 parameters. The big-data associated with these 
bridges can easily be analyzed or visualized using a powerful 
tool such as CNM. CNM [17], [18] is a graph- based model 
which would allow the correlated bridges to be connected by 
an edge in the Correlation Network Graph. Creation of a 
Correlation Network is explained in our methodology 
section. CNM is relevant for this research as the highly 
correlated bridges or bridges with dense connections (usually 
we call them clusters) would give us information about 
bridges that have the same kind of behaviors or 
characteristics.  
For example, bridges with similar patterns in their SRs 
over a long period of time may be highly correlated and will 
have an edge between them in the CNM. Hence, all the 
highly correlated bridges will have dense edges among them 
and form as a cluster. The population analysis allows us to 
compare two or more clusters of bridges with respect to one 
or more enrichment parameters. This analysis will allow us 
to discover what parameters are significantly affecting a

particular cluster. For example, if one particular cluster is 
highly enriched by Structurally Deficient (SD) bridges, then 
we can identify other parameters that are similar to these 
bridges and hence, we can control them. If this structural 
deficiency is due to the deterioration of deck rating, then we 
can advise the bridge authorities to implement deck-related 
rehabilitation measures.  
B. Correlation Networks in Various Disciplines 
In the past decade, Correlation-based Network 
Analysis has become a powerful analysis tool in 
biological studies and have been used by other 
researchers in various disciplines because of their ability

capabilities [12]. CNA was successfully applied in biological 
systems to determine plant growth and biomass in 
Arabidopsis thaliana Recombinant Inbred Lines (RIL) and 
introgression lines (IL) [13], [14]. It was also applied to 
evaluate the effects of hypoxia on a tumor cell biochemistry 
[15]. Correlation networks are powerful and provide us the 
opportunity to measure changes in temporal datasets, and 
there are clusters which are highly enriched by a few Gene 
Ontology (GO) terms [17]. 
C. Correlation Networks to Monitor Structural Health   
Recently, researchers have applied CNM to monitor the 
structural health of civil infrastructures and have also 
analyzed the safety issues with respect to various parameters 
such as inventory rating and deck rating [18]. One of the 
advantages of using CNM in civil infrastructures is that the 
bridges can be clustered based on some similarity, and 
visualized as healthy and unhealthy clusters of bridges [18], 
using any existing visualization tools, such as Cytoscape [19] 
and Gephi [20]. As CNM is a new approach for SHM, it can 
be used to display critical bridges and find an efficient way 
to improve bridge inspection schedules [18]. However, one 
of the limitations of the latter study is that it did not consider 
the temporal-data of SRs; hence, it cannot accurately predict 
a future overall fitness rating behavior of the bridges. Hence, 
creating a Correlation Network model that could deal with 
temporal-data is one of the objectives of this paper. The 
motivation of this paper is to develop a CNM that could 
consider bridges’ overall behavior (i.e., SR) over a period of 
time and analyze highly correlated clusters of bridges to 
predict bridges’ future behavior. The research question of 
this paper is to determine what parameters are enriched for 
each cluster of bridges in the population, if the bridges are 
clustered using the correlations of temporal data of SRs. The 
research objective of this paper is to provide a CNM-based 
Decision Support System for bridge owners to enable them 
to find out which bridges need to be serviced first. As a result, 
we developed a novel CNM that considers the temporal data 
of SRs of the bridges for the last 25 years (from 1992 to 
2016), so as to exactly characterize the overall fitness 
behavior of the bridges over a period of time and hence, 
predict the future fitness behavior accurately.  
 
III. GRAPH MODEL, CORRELATION 
COEFFICIENT, AND CLUSTERING  
This section talks about the graph model, correlation 
coefficient and Markov clustering. 
A. Graph Model 
The graph model (denoted by G= (V, E), where V is a set 
of vertices/nodes, and E is a set of edges) used in this paper 
is undirected and unweighted. An example of an undirected 
and unweighted graph is shown in Figure 2 with five vertices 
and six edges, where every vertex represents a bridge/civil 
infrastructure and any two bridges are connected by an edge 
if and only if they have some correlation. Various colors of 
bridges may represent various status of bridges while 
visualizing them. For example, a green-colored bridge may 
represent a structurally sufficient bridge, whereas a red-
colored bridge could be a SD bridge.  
B. Correlation Coefficient 
A Pearson’s correlation coefficient [10] between any 
two variables is a real value that ranges between -1 and +1, 
and which expresses the strength of linkage or co-occurrence. 
This strength is called Pearson's r or Pearson product-
moment correlation coefficient if the correlation is between 
two continuous–level variables [10], [11]. This paper uses

bivariate (Pearson’s) correlation analysis to show the 
relationship between any two bridges. 
 
C. Markov Clustering 
Clustering groups objects with similar attribute values 
together [16]. The objects are grouped together in such a way 
that distances among the clusters are maximized and the 
distances within the clusters are minimized, as shown in 
Figure 4. The MCL algorithm [9] with default parameters is 
used in this paper to cluster the bridges, as the MCL is more 
suitable to graph-based networks. MCL is a fast and efficient 
algorithm that is designed based on the random walks 
property of the graphs. A random walk in a strongly 
connected cluster usually visits almost all the nodes in the 
cluster. MCL was applied on various protein-protein 
interaction networks and proved to be remarkably robust to 
graph alternations and superior in extracting complexes from 
interaction networks [26]. Since our correlation network with 
civil bridges is also a kind of protein-protein interaction 
network, we used MCL to extract the clusters of bridges that 
behave similarly. 
 
IV. METHODOLOGY 
The following are the four phases of the CNM we are 
proposing.  
i. 
Data acquisition and filtering 
ii. 
Creating a correlation network and applying 
MCL algorithm 
iii. 
Analyzing various clusters with respect to both 
input parameters, and output parameters, and 
comparing various clusters (population analysis) 
iv. 
Developing a decision support system 
The first two phases are explained in this section and the last 
two sections are explained as part of the next section. The 
novelty of this method is that the similar bridges are 
connected together into one cluster and the individual clusters 
are analyzed to see what input or output ratings are highly 
enriched for that cluster. The population analysis allows us to 
compare various clusters with respect to various rating 
parameters and then the decision support system allows us to 
make decisions about various clusters.  
A. Data Acquisition and Filtering 
       Bridge data of California, Iowa, and Nebraska, from the 
years 1992 to 2016, was obtained from the NBI database. 
Each bridge description is an alpha-numeric string of 432 
characters in the database. There are 45,397 (California-
15123, Iowa-16513, and Nebraska-13761 bridges) common 
bridges from 1992 to 2016 (based on the structure number 
entry in the database) in these three states. A total of 7,038 
bridges out of 45,397 are culverts (Alpha-Numeric character 
string position 262! =’N’) and 38,359 are non-culverts, 
according to the 2016-database. As the data was processed 
for any kind of anomalies, we found that there are 2,285 of 
these 45,397 common bridges that have inconsistent entries. 
In some years, they were recorded as culverts and in some 
years they were non-culverts. These 2,285 bridges were 
omitted from consideration. The remaining 43,112 common 
bridges consisted of 5550 culverts and 37,562 non-culverts 
(bridges). The majority of non-culverts (9,546 out of 37,562) 
were coded with main-structure type-302 (Item 43 from the 
NBI coding guide). In the coding 302, the first digit 3 
represents the kind of material, i.e., “Steel,” and the last two 
digits, 02, represent the type of design, which is, 
“Stringer/Multi-beam or Girder.”  
Our method takes a population of this 9,546 steel-
stringer/multi-beam or girder bridges across three states of 
the USA (California, Iowa, and Nebraska), which come 
from three different climatic regions (as shown in Figure 1). 
The following items/parameters extracted from the FHWA 
coding guide [2] were considered for our analysis.

vi. Status of the bridge as defined in [22] 
vii. Sufficiency Rating 
B. Creating a Correlation Network  
The SRs of each of the 9,546 bridges from 1992 to 2016 
(25 years) are recorded as an input matrix (say, SR matrix) 
with each row (i.e., each bridge) of the matrix having 25 
years’ SRs in it. So, there are 9,546 rows in the matrix, with 
each row as a vector of 25 years’ SRs. A Pearson correlation 
coefficients matrix (say, Correlation-matrix) was then 
obtained over the SR matrix. The resultant Correlation-
matrix is of size 9546 times 9546. Assuming each bridge as 
a node (vertex) in the graph model, two nodes are connected 
by an undirected edge if and only if their correlation 
coefficient ρ >= 0.90 and significance value p <=.01. This 
creates a Correlation-Network with bridges as nodes along 
with highly correlated nodes connected by edges as shown in 
Figure 5. We applied the MCL algorithm with all default 
parameters in Cytoscape [19] on the obtained Correlation 
Network, in order to produce clusters. These clusters are 
basically sub-networks of nodes and edges. Each cluster was 
further analyzed to see which input parameters were enriched 
for that cluster. As the clusters are formed with high 
correlations among the nodes, we can infer that the overall 
behavior of the nodes within each cluster is the same. This is 
the hypothesis of this research. MCL has produced 8610 
nodes in various clusters and 3865 nodes are present in the 
Top 5 clusters and shown in Figure 6. These Top 5 clusters 
are considered for further analysis. Various experiments are 
conducted on the Top 5 clusters produced by the MCL 
algorithm, and the results are shown below. 
 
V. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
This section demonstrates various experimental results 
with respect to various network properties of the Top-5 
clusters, SR, and other input ratings.  
A. Network Properties of Top 5 Clusters 
Figure 5 shows the correlation network (correlation 
ρ>=0.90) formed with 9546 nodes, 767542 edges, and 101 
connected components. This is a scale-free network and 
follows a power-law node degree distribution. In a power-
law node degree distribution, there are many nodes with 
fewer degrees and fewer number of nodes with more degrees. 
The top 5 clusters (yellow colored clusters) produced by the 
MCL algorithm are shown in Figure 6. These clusters’ 
statistics are shown in TABLE 1, with the top- most cluster 
having the highest number of nodes 1496 and 354939 edges, 
and the least cluster having 255 nodes and 13922 edges. The 
lower the diameter, the closer the nodes are. Hence, almost 
all the nodes in all the clusters are around the center node(s). 
The higher the clustering coefficient [23], the higher the 
degree to which nodes in a graph are inclined to cluster 
together. The higher values of the average clustering 
coefficient for each cluster / subnetwork indicate that the 
nodes inside each cluster tend to be part of that cluster only. 
Therefore, the Top 5 clusters with higher clustering 
coefficients are considered for further analysis. TABLE 1 
shows that cluster 5 has the highest clustering coefficient, 
which is 0.838. The cluster density describes the potential 
number of edges present in the sub-network compared to the 
possible number of edges in the sub-network. From TABLE 
1, we see that cluster 3 has the highest density (0.533) among 
all the Top 5 clusters.

PRODUCED BY THE MCL ALGORITHM. 
 
B. Analysis of Bridge Behavior with Respect to 
Sufficiency Rating 
 
We selected two bridges from cluster5 for our analysis to 
look at their behavior in terms of their overall fitness ratings 
(i.e., SRs) as shown in Figure 8. These two bridges are highly 
correlated (correlation ρ>=0.94) with each other and hence, 
connected by an edge in the network. The first bridge (say 
Bridge1, shown in red color) has an initial SR value of 615 
in the year 1992, and maintained almost the same value until 
the year 2013. After then, there was a sudden drop in the SR 
value from almost 600 to below 500, ending at a SR value of 
490 in the year 2016. Similarly, the second bridge (say 
Bridge2, shown in green color) started with a SR value of 970 
in the year 1992 and steadily maintained it until 2013. There 
was a sudden drop in the year 2013 to a SR value of 860 and 
ended at that value itself. Though the first bridge was 
constructed in the year 1969, and the second bridge in the 
year 1988, both of these bridge had almost similar SR curves 
from 1992 to 2016. We have also observed that the current 
status of the first bridge is SD, and the second bridge is 
structurally good.  
As SR is an overall fitness rating of the bridges, and as 
both of these bridges had the same kind of SR curve for the 
last 25 years, if the first bridge is SD, the second bridge may 
also have a high probability of becoming SD in the near

future, as both bridges are highly correlated and in the same 
cluster. Estimating after how many years the second bridge 
will become SD is not the scope of this paper. Some of the 
bridges’ SRs comparison is given in Figure 9. In fact, all 
these bridges are connected to the bridge CA-B06422 
(Bridge names are partially anonymized. That means the first 
two letters in each bridge name may indicate the state but the 
remaining sequence in the name does not reflect the original 
bridge name as it is given in [1]). This means all these bridges 
are adjacent bridges of the bridge CA-B06422. This figure 
clearly shows that the SRs pattern is almost the same for 
adjacent bridges as they are highly correlated. It also clearly 
shows that all these bridges are sooner or later going to 
become SD, as all bridge SRs are deteriorating. Immediate 
maintenance may be required for this kind of bridges. Figure 
10 shows that both clusters 3 and 4 have higher SRs at the 
end (year 2016), while all the remaining bridges have lower 
averages of SRs. We can also observe that for clusters 4 and 
3, there was a maintenance (in terms of reconstruction) took 
place in the years 1997 and 2007 respectively. Hence, these 
clusters have higher SRs in the year 2016 (as shown in Figure 
10) and do not need immediate maintenance.

C. Analysis of Top 5 clusters with respect to input rating 
parameters 
Various input rating parameters of output ratings, such 
as SR, are considered for cluster enrichment analysis. Figure 
7 shows the comparison of Top 5 clusters’ average input 
ratings, such as DR, SPSR, SBSR, WAR, and SCR of the 
NBI-dataset-2016. From this figure, we can see that all the 
ratings of both cluster 3 and cluster 4 are higher compared to 
all the remaining clusters. Similarly, from Figures 11 through 
15, we see how different input ratings vary for all the Top 5 
clusters. For example, from Figure 11, we find that both 
cluster 1 and cluster 2 are enriched with DR = 5. This 
indicates that the deck (as shown in Figure 3) is in “Fair 
Condition” (as specified in the FHWA coding guide [2]). If 
we see cluster 4 from the same Figure 11, DRs ranging from 
5 through 8 are equally distributed and hence, these higher 
ratings led to the higher SRs as shown in Figure 16. We can 
also see that both cluster-3 and cluster-4 have higher input 
rating values as shown in Figures 11 through 15. Figure 12 
shows that Cluster-2 is highly enriched with Superstructure 
Rating <= 5. Once these bridges’ Superstructure Ratings drop 
from 5 to 4, then the bridges will fall into the SD bridge

category. Hence, the improvement in the Superstructure 
Rating in terms of reducing the live load is required. This can 
be done by reducing Average Daily Traffic and 
implementing required rehabilitation services on these 
bridges. Cluster 2 from Figure 13 also shows that the 
Substructure Rating is critical, as most of the bridges’ 
Substructure Ratings are <= 5. From Figure 14, we see that 
Water Adequacy Ratings are good for all the clusters and no 
Water Adequacy improvement measures are required for 
these clusters. As shown in Figure 15, most of the bridges in 
clusters 1, 2, and 5 are enriched with SCR value <=4, which 
indicates that most of the bridges in these clusters are either 
SD or will soon become SD. Hence, they have lower SRs as 
shown in Figure 16. The same can be observed from Figure 
10, where the average SRs for every 5 years’ interval are 
shown. From this graph, Clusters 1,2 and 5 are showing 
higher deterioration patterns as compared to Clusters 3 and 
4. Hence, our decision support system recommends various 
bridge authorities to provide immediate attention or service 
to the bridges in clusters 1, 2 and 5.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we presented a new Correlation Network 
Model for analyzing civil infrastructures with a focus on the 
assessment of safety of bridges. We employed the network 
model to provide a population analysis approach to extract 
useful information for publicly available bridge data. The 
proposed method allows highly correlated bridges to be 
identified and form a cluster of bridges with similar safety-
related characteristics, such as the overall fitness rating. The 
population analysis makes it possible to compare different 
clusters with different enrichment parameters and ratings. We 
conducted a pilot study with a group of bridges from three 
states. We were able to use the constructed correlation 
network to identify several groups of bridges with different 
safety measures. Based on the obtained classifications, we 
identified bridges that exhibit a higher rate of deterioration 
and need to receive a higher priority for receiving 
maintenance. With these findings, we showed that the CNM 
enables domain experts to categorize clusters of bridges 
based on their safety. CNM as a decision support system 
allows SHM inspectors to have a risk-based schedule for 
servicing bridges, and allocate funds to inspect bridges with 
low safety patterns. As a future step, we plan to study the 
effect of specific parameters, such as Average Daily Traffic, 
on SRs and provide a risk assessment to various groups of 
bridges based on their deterioration patterns.
