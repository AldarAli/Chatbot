Abstract— File cloud provides file storages on the Internet and 
manages them for people to access and manipulate their 
contents like documents, pictures, and movies anywhere and 
anytime. There are various smart devices such as tablets, 
smart phones, and smart pads, which can utilize file cloud 
services. In this paper, we introduce a social file cloud system 
as one of tools for collaboration between people in the 
workplace. We extend basic file cloud service by adding social 
factors such as tags, score, and comments to a file into a social 
file cloud service, that is, “cocoBox”, which means a file box for 
communication and collaboration. CocoBox provides the basic 
functionalities of file cloud service such as file upload and file 
download. In addition, we focus on social factors of files to help 
collaboration among people who share same files. Whoever 
shares a specific file with others can add tags, give score, and 
add/remove his/her opinion on that file. Therefore, cocoBox 
enhances communication and collaboration among people with 
these social factors.

 INTRODUCTION  
Cloud computing is defined as “a model for enabling 
ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a 
shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., 
networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that 
can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal 
management effort or service provider interaction [1]”. There 
are several service models for cloud computing such as SaaS 
(Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and 
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).  
File cloud provides file storages on the Internet and 
manages them for people to access and manipulate their files 
anywhere and anytime. Recently, we have various kinds of 
mobile devices such as laptops, mobile pads, and smart 
phones to use file cloud services. File cloud services enable 
us to access same files on any devices and share various 
contents like pictures, movie, and music to other people. As 
the examples of file cloud, dropbox [3], Amazon S3 [4], and 
iCloud [5] are popular. These services provide file storage 
service with user friendly interfaces on desktops, web 
browsers, and mobile internet devices and enable file sharing 
among people.  
We extend file cloud service by adding social features 
such as tags, score, and comments to ordinary content 
repository into a social file cloud service. Based on the Java 
Content Repository (JCR) 170 [6], we develop “cocoBox”, 
which means a file box for communication and collaboration. 
CocoBox provides the basic functionalities of file cloud 
service such as file sharing, uploading and downloading. But, 
in addition to it, cocoBox has social features for 
collaboration between people who share the same files. 
Whoever shares a specific file with others can add tags, give 
score, and add/remove his/her opinion on that file. These 
social factors of the file give people additional information 
of it; therefore, these social values can help to promote the 
collaboration among colleagues who share common files.  
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we 
overlook recent popular file cloud services such as iCloud, 
S3, dropbox. Section 3 shows the architecture, data models 
of cocoBox including social features. In addition, REST 
APIs of cocoBox and cocoBox applications implemented by 
using the APIs are introduced. Finally, we summarize and 
describe further works of this study in Section 4.

RELATED WORK 
 
With the bombing growth of number of smart phone 
users and mobile internet devices, the need to share contents 
such as pictures, movies, and music with other people also 
grows. It is required to provide file cloud services for users 
to access their files on various devices. A lot of file cloud 
services are developed and provided. In this section, we 
outlook on worldwide popular file cloud services, e.g., 
iCloud, Amazon S3, dropbox.  
A. iCloud 
iCloud is a cloud storage and cloud computing service 
from Apple Inc. announced on June 6, 2011 at the Apple 
Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The service 
allows users to store data such as music files on remote 
computer servers for download to multiple devices such as 
iOS-based devices, and personal computers running Mac OS 
X or Microsoft Windows. It also replaces Apple's MobileMe 
service, acting as a data syncing center for email, contacts, 
calendars, bookmarks, notes, to-do lists, and other data. As 
of 2012, the service has over 100 million users [2]. 
iCloud stores  music, photos, documents, and more and 
wirelessly pushes them to  devices. iCloud is said to makes it 
quick and effortless to access just about everything on the 
devices people use every day. iCloud automatically and 
securely stores content so it's always available to iPhone, 
iPad, iPod touch, Mac, or PC and  gives people access to 
their music, movies, apps, latest photos, and more from 
whichever device people happen to be using. It also keeps

email, contacts, and calendars up to date across all devices 
without explicit syncing and management.  
B. Dropbox 
Dropbox is a web-based file hosting service operated by 
Dropbox, Inc. that uses networked storage to enable users to 
store and share files and folders with others across the 
Internet using file synchronization [2]. 
Dropbox is a free service that lets users bring photos, 
docs, and videos anywhere. This means that any file users 
save to Dropbox will automatically save to their computers, 
phones and the Dropbox website [3].  
C. Amazon S3 
Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to 
make web-scale computing easier for developers [2]. 
Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can 
be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, 
from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to 
the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive 
infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global 
network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits 
of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.

COCOBOX: A SOCIAL FILE CLOUD 
 
Other file cloud services do not focus on social features, 
which can help people express their opinion on the sharing 
files or rank them. In this section, we describe the 
architecture of cocoBox and social features, which cocoBox 
provides to promote collaboration while sharing files. 
 
A. System Architecture 
“cocoBox” means a file box for communication and 
collaboration. In the previous section, most popular used 
services don’t have social features which help people to 
collaborate, that is, to communicate their opinions on the 
files and evaluate them.  
Figure 1 shows the overall architecture of cocoBox 
system. CocoBox is implemented based on the JCR (java 
content repository) 170 as a repository. The cocoBox server 
manipulates requests of users which are called from web 
browser on user’s desktop or mobile internet device like a 
smart phone. Since cocoBox is focusing on collaboration 
between people, the main target domain would be small or 
middle – size enterprise. Within a closed group such as 
divisions, teams and departments, people share files and 
contents with their colleagues. To support this closed group 
collaboration, cocoBox interacts with a directory server 
which manages organization chart and member information 
using LDAP protocol.

The data model of cocoBox is shaped into a tree structure 
as shown in Figure 2. This model supports a parent-child 
relationship between folders and files. Each file and folder is 
a node, which has properties respectively. 
  
 
Folder node 
This represents a folder, and includes basic folder 
properties and sharing information, and has subfolders 
and file nodes as its child. The folder node can have one 
of three types: sharing folder, shared folder, and 
personal folder type. If the folder is sharing folder, this 
means that its owner is the user, and  it has coUsers 
properties ,which mean co-workers who share this 
folder together. If the folder is shared folder type, it has 
no children and it has source path property which is 
original owner’s folder path.  Otherwise, the folder is  a 
personal folder, which nobody can share 
 
File node 
File node has contents of the file and metadata as it 
children and has general information as its properties. 
 
Metadata node 
Metadata and its children represent the social features 
of cocoBox.  Metadata include tags, score, comments 
and related information. 
 
Comment node  
Comment node represents a comment and it has content 
of comment and commentator information. Only the 
writer of the comment can remove that comment. 
 
To summarize, the social features in the cocoBox system 
are follows; 
 
 
Score  
The quality of document would be estimated using this 
score. People can score each file on a scale of 0 to5.  
 
Tag 
This tag information could be used as keywords. Since  
social data are in the data tree, people can search files 
which have the specific tag. 
 
Comment 
People can add their opinion about this file in the short 
sentence, share their thinking, and even discuss it. 
 
With these social factors of files, file sharers can rank 
their files and express their opinion about sharing files. 
Therefore people can discuss on the shared documents and 
even share their knowledge. 
B. cocoBox service components 
We provide cocoBox service components in the form of 
REST API. Not only core functionalities to manipulate file 
storage, but also additional functionalities to manage social 
metadata of the file are provided. Using these APIs, people 
can develop their file cloud applications easily which use 
cocoBox. These components provide simple interfaces to 
create/delete/share folders, upload/download files, and 
add/remove social metadata of files such as comments, tags, 
score, as shown in the Table 1.

Figure 3 shows the cocoBox web user interface. When 
you select a file, the social data such as tag, average score, 
and comments are displayed in the page and you can add or 
modify them. 
 
Figure 4 shows the home display of mobile cocoBox app. 
This application was developed using the cocoBox service 
components shown in Table 1and runs on smart mobile 
devices the Oss of which are Android 2.2.

Figure 5 shows the social data of the mobile cocoBox 
app. People can handle social data of a file using this 
interface. By providing these social data in file cloud service, 
people can discuss their sharing contents and express their 
thought or preference about it. We expect these social data of 
file cloud could help the collaboration and even 
communicating their knowledge with other people.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
We introduce a social file cloud system, cocoBox. We 
extend this file cloud service by adding social features such 
as tags, score, and comments to ordinary content repository 
into a social file cloud service. The social features of 
cocoBox are tags, comments, score on the file. We expect 
these features can help collaboration and communication 
between people who share contents and have same interest. 
For further study, we continue to find more social features of 
file cloud such as e-mail notification of file changes and to 
develop desktop client which synchronizes files with 
cocoBox server. We expect improved cocoBox will help 
people to collaborate in the work environment.
