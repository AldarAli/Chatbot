Abstract—A single component fractional order element
(FOE) is indigenously developed and its electrical equivalent
model is proposed. The FOE exhibits fractional order behavior
due to anomalous diffusion of ions through the porous surface
of the electrode. The model includes the effect of the polarizable
solution and diameter of the pores on the parameters of
the FOE. The simulation results of the proposed electrical
equivalent model obtained by changing its parameters are
discussed along with the experimental results illustrating the
behavior of single component FOE.
Keywords-Single component fractional order element (FOE);
anomalous diffusion; porous electrode.
I. INTRODUCTION
Design and development of fractional order element
(FOE) has become an important ﬁeld of research owing to
the growing interest in studying fractional order systems.
The earlier technique for realization of a fractional order
element was using different combinations of RC ladder
networks [1], [2], [3], [4]. But recently some authors have
reported realization of FOE by using physico-chemical phe-
nomenon [5]. A single component fractional order element
has been developed by the authors indigenously [6], [7], [8],
where a capacitor type probe with porous surface behave as
an FOE when dipped in ionic medium.
To understand the exact relationship among the fractional
exponent of FOE and the fabrication parameters, the mecha-
nism due to which the fractional order behavior is exhibited
must be studied. Literature shows that anomalous diffusion
of ions [9], [10] through fractal surface results in fractional
order behavior. In case of the single component FOE, the
porous PMMA coating on the electrode surface consists of
self similar spherical pores. Thus the electrode surface is
fractal in nature, ion diffusion through which results in the
fractional behavior.
It is well known that using different circuit combinations
of resistance (R) and capacitance (C), i.e., cross RC ladder
network, domino ladder, tree structure, an FOE can be
realized. Thus a single component FOE can also be modeled
using some combinations of R and C.
In this paper, the relation between the parameters of
single component FOE and the fabrication criteria has been
identiﬁed. Also the effect of diffusion of ions through the
porous electrode surface on the behavior of the FOE is
explored. An electrical equivalent model is proposed which
is required for designing the single component FOE with
desired speciﬁcations.
The paper is organised in four sections. Section II deals
with the basics of single component fractional order element
and the proposed electrical equivalent model for it. In
Section III the experimental results showing the behavior
of single component FOE as well as the simulation results
obtained from the electrical equivalent model are discussed.
Finally, in Section IV, concluding remarks and future scope
have been looked into.
II. ELECTRICAL EQUIVALENT MODEL OF SINGLE
COMPONENT FOE
A single component fractional order element is fabricated
by coating a copper plated epoxy glass with a porous ﬁlm
of poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA). This probe is dipped
in a polarizable medium. The polymer coated copper probe
when dipped in polarizable solution behaves as a fractional
order element. The diagram of single component FOE is
shown in Figure 1.

The impedance of a fractional order element is given by
Z(s) = Qs−α
(1)
where ‘α’ is the fractional exponent of the FOE.
Single component FOEs having different values of ‘α’ can
be realized by varying the following fabrication parameters
i. Thickness of PMMA coating
ii. Concentration of the polarizable solution
iii. Area of contact of the electrode surface with the solution.
The fractional behavior of the probe arises due to the
anomalous diffusion of ions through the porous surface
of the single component FOE. In ordinary diffusion, the
mean square displacement (

r2
) of diffusing particles is
directly proportional to time (t), i.e.,

r2
∝ t. On the other
hand, in case of anomalous diffusion,

r2
has a power law
distribution on time, i.e.,

r2
∝ tβ, where β < 1. This
occurs due to the distribution of time constant resulting from
ion diffusion through porous surfaces.
The surface of the FOE is porous in nature and the pores
are more or less circular as is evident from the Scanning
Electron Microscope (SEM) images (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5).
It can be seen from Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 that the pore
diameter has an one to one relationship with the thickness
of the PMMA ﬁlm, i.e., the pore size increases with increase
in thickness of the PMMA coating and vice versa.

with coating thickness 15µm; Pore diameter = 2.24µm
Figure 5.

with coating thickness 25µm; Pore diameter = 4.85µm
The pores on the electrode surface are assumed to be
spherical. At different layers of the ﬁlm, the pore diameter is
different. As the ions penetrate through the porous ﬁlm, the
resistance offered by the solution increases due to decrease
in pore size (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5). The ions continue to
penetrate till the pore diameter is less than the diameter of
the ions. At this point the ions cannot move any further and
become stationary.
Let, diameter of ion be ‘di’;
Thickness of the PMMA coating be ‘t’;
Pore diameter corresponding to coating thickness ‘t’ be ‘D’;
Number of branches the ions penetrate be ‘n’ and
Ratio of decrease of the pore diameter between two succes-
sive layers be ‘a’.
The ions can penetrate till the pore diameter is less than
‘di’. This can be mathematically represented by
D
an ≤ di
(2)
The movement of the ions through the porous ﬁlm can be
modeled using a tree network consisting of resistances and
capacitances. The electrode surface consists of numerous
pores. Considering a single pore, the cross sectional view
of the ﬁlm can be represented as shown in Figure 6.
The porous structures are considered to be self similar
in nature, i.e., from each pore ‘N’ number of smaller pores

‘ν’ can be deﬁned as the fractal dimension of the single
component FOE. For the model to behave as a fractional
order element, the value of ‘N’ should be greater than 1.
III. INFERENCES FROM THE ELECTRICAL EQUIVALENT
MODEL
Simulation of the ladder network given in Figure 8 shows
that the value of ‘α’ depends on the ratios ‘g’ and ‘G’
(Figure 9).
It has been observed that by changing the product of
R and C the bandwidth of constant phase angle can be
shifted. On increasing the product RC the bandwidth shifts
to lower frequency range and vice versa. This phenomenon
is illustrated in Figure 10.
Also the frequency range of constant phase angle can be
varied by changing the value of ‘n’ (Figure 11).

Simulation results showing change in bandwidth of constant
phase angle with the value of ‘n’
From (7) it can be observed that ‘α’ depends on ‘a’ and
‘N’. The value of ‘α’ increases with an increase in ‘a’.
It has been found experimentally that ‘α’ increases with
the thickness of the PMMA coating (Table. I). Hence, ‘a’
is directly proportional to the PMMA ﬁlm thickness. The
fractional exponent, ‘α’ also depends on the concentration
of the polarizable medium. This dependence can be incor-
porated in the theoretical model in terms of the value of
‘n’. Experiments show that the constant phase angle of
a single component FOE increases with the decrease in
concentration. This can be seen from Figure 12 and Tables.
II and III. Thus, we can infer that with concentration of
the ionic medium, the value of ‘n’ increases. The increase
in ‘n’ results in decrease in value of ‘α’ and increase in
bandwidth of constant phase angle. From (2) it is obvious
that if ‘n’ increases keeping ‘D’ and ‘di’ constant, the value
of ‘a’ decreases and in turn ‘α’. An important observation
is that the bandwidth of constant phase angle shifts to lower
frequency range as concentration decreases. This is because

Figure 12.
Experimental results showing shift in bandwidth of constant
phase angle and change in ‘α’ value with concentration change of KCl
solution for FOE5
when concentration of the polarizable solution decreases,
its conductivity decreases. Hence, the resistance offered by
the solution increases. The interfacial capacitance remaining
constant, the product of R and C increases, thus shifting the
bandwidth of constant phase angle to lower frequency range.
This is evident from Figure 12.
Keeping concentration of polarizable solution ﬁxed, i.e.,
‘n’ constant, if different polarizable solutions are used then
the solution having ions of larger radius results in smaller
‘α’ value as evident from (2) and Tables. II and III.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, an electrical equivalent model of the single
component FOE has been proposed which takes into account
the effects of anomalous diffusion of ions through porous
surface and fractal dimension. The factors affecting the value
of the fractional exponent ‘α’ and also their relationship with
‘α’ have been identiﬁed. The electrical equivalent model will
help in predicting the behavior of single component FOE and
also designing an FOE with desired speciﬁcations. The exact
mathematical relation among the fabrication parameters and
‘α’ is yet to be established and needs further research.
