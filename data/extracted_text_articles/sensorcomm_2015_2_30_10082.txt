Abstract—This work presents the design and experimental
results of a temperature sensor based on quasi-distributed ther-
mally regenerated Fiber Bragg gratings (RFBG) applied to the
bearings of hydro generators. The temperature increase in the
bearing is generally due to excessive shaft misalignment, low oil
level or dirt in the lubricant oil. Expensive and time-consuming
damage can be caused to the generator if the temperature sensors
are not able to detect the fault in time and accurately. The
proposed sensor has three wavelength multiplexed RFBG to
monitor the vertical temperature gradient in the lubricant oil.
The developed package is designed to avoid the cross sensitivity
of the RFBG with mechanical of forces. Thermally treated Fiber
Bragg Grating (FBG) is heated till about 900 ◦C far away the
temperature range in which the power plant operates, making
its use suitable to obtain thermal stability for many years.
Temperature stability tests were carried out for over fourteen
hours in laboratory. The uncertainties were evaluated considering
the sample dispersion and equipment characteristics used during
the sensor temperature calibration. The experimental results
show that the uncertainty associated to each FBG matches the
power plant metrological requirements. The developed package
for bearing temperature measurement proved to be robust both
mechanically and thermally.
Keywords—Electrical generator bearing; Optical Regenerated

INTRODUCTION
The Brazilian energy sector is predominantly hydroelectric
which represents approximately 62 % of the total energy
generated in the country. The installed electrical energy ca-
pacity reaches 90.2 GW in a total of 145.5 GW, meaning
about ﬁve times the capacity of thermal power plants that
use natural gas fuel, which is the second largest Brazilian
electrical energy source with about 18.1 % of the total [1].
The electric generators used in large power plants have sizes
normally reaching hundreds of Mega Watts (MW). They have
also heavy structures with dimensions proportional to its power
causing the cooling and alignment systems to be an important
part of these large machines.
Therefore, hydroelectric power plants must operate unin-
terrupted for long periods of time before a preventive main-
tenance of the generation system is required. The electrical
generator has a very important role in the generation system
because of it is the machine that converts the mechanical
energy coming from the hydraulic turbine into electric en-
ergy. However, power generators are susceptible to adverse
situations such as unbalanced loads, short-circuits in the trans-
mission line among others. These situations cause, mainly,
a higher loss in the windings of the generator (stator and
rotor) and therefore a temperature rise above the expected and
planned for its operation. When the temperature is above the
nominal it causes premature wear of the insulating materials
reducing the service life of the generator [2].
In Figure 1, there is a schematic drawing showing the
bearings position along the hydro generator structure. The
bearing indicated by 1 is the one that supports the vertical
force exerted by the weight of the hydraulic turbine (HT)
and electrical generator (EG) assembly. The bearings indicated
by 2 and 3 are intended to not allowing the misalignment of
hydro generator in the horizontal direction. The EG is a three-
phase synchronous generator, with a rated voltage of 13.8 kV
between phases, and rated current of 7.1 kA. The generator
stator has a diameter of 12 m and 2.5 m in height. The structure
weighs over 200 tons implying serious safety problems if any
alignment issue takes place. With a reliable system to monitor
temperature continuously, small temperature increases can be
detected before causing further damage.

ment also can lead to faults in the large hydroelectric power
generators. The bearings must compensate potential misalign-
ment in the shaft that connects the hydraulic turbine to the
generator. The torsional efforts coming from different power
cycles that the generator is subject to must also be compensated
[3][4]. When the generator operates by varying its power,
there is a proportional temperature variation on the bearings,
therefore increasing their temperature with the increase in the
generated power. There are other factors like lack of lubrication
or dirty contaminants in lubricant reservoir, which increase
temperature, sometimes leading to the generator shutdown and
the necessity to perform corrective maintenance. In Figure 2,
it is presented a damaged bearing by metal pieces that fell into
the lubricant oil causing the generator shutdown by tempera-
ture increase. Another important factor that could affect the
bearings temperature is the short-circuit stator winding which
induces abnormal electromagnetic ﬂux in the air gap, and, as
a result, the excessive vibrational movements in the generator-
turbine shaft [5].

corrective maintenance.
In this work, we present the development and results of
an optical ﬁber sensor developed to monitor bearings in hydro
generator that avoid FBG cross-sensitivity [6]. The proposed
design uses three wavelength multiplexed and encapsulated
Regenerated Fiber Bragg grating sensors (RFBG) that form
a thermal transducer of 1.5 m long and has sensing points
distributed along its body. The FBG has some promising
features that make it wide applicable in electric machines
[7][8]. A FBG sensor [9] consists of an optical ﬁber passive-
device that have shown fast insertion in measuring and control
applications. The FBG led to new developments in optical
ﬁltering and in the design of sensors. FBG temperature sensors
have some advantageous characteristics, such as low mass,
immunity to electromagnetic interference, small signal attenu-
ation and the possibility of being multiplexed [10]. Thus, it has
the ability to solve measurement issues for which conventional
sensing techniques are not appropriate, as in the case of the
thermal analysis inside large electric generators working at
high voltages.
The next sections provide a more speciﬁc approach to the
main issues related to the developed optical ﬁber sensor. A
brief review about FBG and RFBG is presented in Section
II highlighting this main characteristics. In Section III it is
presented the packaging assembly, the temperature calibration
process and the method used to determine uncertainties. The
experimental results are presented in Section IV. Finally, the
conclusions obtained from the temperature tests and future
work are presented in Section V.
II.
THERMALLY REGENERATED FIBER BRAGG GRATINGS
An FBG is formed by a periodic change in the refractive
index caused in a ﬁber core with an effective refractive index
nef f by exposure to an ultraviolet (UV) laser beam [6]. The
index change is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of
the ﬁber with constant periodicity Λ. The index modulation
inside the ﬁber builds a resonant structure to a determinate
wavelength as shown in Figure 3. The center peak wavelength
is called Bragg wavelength (λB) and is given by (1):
λB = 2nef f Λ.
(1)
Figure 3 (a) shows an optical ﬁber in which three FBGs
are inscribed with different modulation period Λ. The different
periods lead to different resonances Bragg wavelength λB.
When the Bragg condition is satisﬁed (1), the light reﬂected
back by each modulation contributes constructively. Then a
central wavelength of the reﬂected light is deﬁned by the
parameters of the grating [13]. The reﬂected spectrum (Sr) is
similar to a very effective band-pass ﬁlter and the transmitted
spectrum (St) resembles a reject-band ﬁlter as shown in Figure
3 (b).

The Bragg wavelength (λB) has dependency on two pa-
rameters: effective refractive index and grating periodicity.
The change on one of these two parameters from external
interference produces a shift in λB. The mechanical and
thermal environment changes are related to the wavelength
shift through the expression:
∆λB(l,T) = 2

The ﬁrst term in (2) represents the strain effect on an optical
ﬁber. It is associated with the shift on λB due to the change
of the refractive index, called photo-elastic coefﬁcient, and
the length of the FBG caused by the optical ﬁber mechanical
deformation. As for the second term in (2), λB shift is asso-
ciated with the thermal expansion coefﬁcient and the thermo-
optic coefﬁcient of silica. The inﬂuence of the thermo-optic
coefﬁcient surpasses by far the thermal expansion coefﬁcient
in a silica optical ﬁber. It is also possible to observe that the
FBG has a cross sensivity between strain and temperature. So,
when it is desired to build a temperature sensor it is necessary
to develop a package that eliminates the strain effect.

There is a concern to improve the thermal properties of
FBG to allow temperature sensing applications with improved
the temperature stability of the gratings. This has involved
experimenting with various dopants, including Sn and Na2O
[14]. Previous studies have already established that temperature
range and stability of FBGs can be improved by several means,
including formation of type IIA [15][16][17] and type II
[18][19] gratings, including those inscribed using femtosecond
IR lasers.
For many applications, the thermal stability of laser in-
duced glass changes determines the limits in which they can
operate, for power plant applications, FBGs that can operate
at 80 ◦C for 25 years are required. Thermally regenerated
FBG play a special role in temperature measurement inside
power plants because of it has great thermal stability within
the power plant temperature range [11][12]. In order to make a
RFBG, it is inscribed a strong conventional Bragg grating into
hydrogen loaded optical ﬁber called seed grating. Afterwards,
the strong seed grating is thermally processed at about 900 ◦C
and the generation is observed. Over time as the seed grating
disappears completely, a regenerated grating appears [20][21].
The temperature sensing in hydroelectric generators has a
great importance as a performance indicator of the machine,
and it is frequently measured using RTD or thermocouples as
point sensors. Although widely used, such sensors can easily
be interchange by new technologies like optical ﬁber sensors,
especially those designed with FBG, as presented in this
work. Optical ﬁber sensing applications in hydro generators
were presented in [22][23] demonstrating the monitoring of
temperature, vibration, magnetic ﬁeld among others generator
parameters. There is also the use of distributed temperature
sensing on the stator surface of 200 MVA generator [24].
Furthermore, the temperature monitoring in bearings using
FBG was developed and tested in laboratory during 12 hours
[25].
III.
PACKAGING AND TEMPERATURE CALIBRATION
The seed FBGs used in this work were produced at the
Photonics Laboratory of UTFPR, using ArF Excimer lasers
(Coherent Xantos) operating at 193 nm. The gratings were
directly written using a phase-mask with typical laser pulse
energy of 5 mJ and repetition rate of 250 Hz, with exposition
on the order of 5 minutes. Each grating has approximately 3
mm in length.
The ﬁber samples are hydrogen loaded for several days
under 110 atm, 25 ◦C before the seed grating inscription.
The grating was kept at room temperature after inscription
to diffuse hydrogen before being subjected to the regeneration
process inside a resistive oven. Using a processing procedure
identical to [26], strong seed gratings were thermally processed
with temperatures between 21 ◦C to 900 ◦C (± 15 ◦C) during
approximately 2 h 30 min. At 900 ◦C the regeneration is
observed, and over time as the seed grating is reduced almost
completely, the regenerated grating appears. After that, the
oven is turned off and the grating remained resting inside to
complete the annealing process. Figure 4 shows the spectrum
of the seed FBG (dashed line) and RFBG (solid line) after the
annealing process.
Due to the harsh environment and the fragility of pristine
FBG sensors, the FBG must be packaged with special materials
before installation, to avoid the damage to the ﬁber sensors.
Another feature of the package should be the minimization of
the strain-temperature cross sensitive of FBG. In this work the
package is formed by one steel rod with an external diameter of
3.18 mm and an internal hole with a diameter of 1.7 mm. Fig
5 (a) and (b) show pictures of the sensor package for bearing
sensor.

In Figure 5 (a), there is a drawing showing the main sensor
parts. The sensor presents a splice chamber to keep the optical
splices safe and an optical cable exit to connect the RFBGs to
the internal optical aqua plant link. The junction applies a force
to the collet, it causes a pressure to hold the steel rod on the
sensor and inside the thermowell. The bearing sensor has three
RFBGs spatially positioned close to it edges (Figure 5 (b)).
This distributed sensor conﬁguration was designed because
of the three FBG will be immersed in the oil to detect the
temperature gradient along the vertical direction.

The measurement uncertainty usually encompasses many
requisites. Some can be estimated through a type A evaluation
of measurement uncertainty from the statistical distribution
values. The values come from several measurements and can
be characterized by standard deviations. Other components
can be estimated through a type B evaluation of measurement
uncertainty. They may also be characterized by standard devi-
ations estimated from probability density functions based on
user experience or other information [28][29]. The A and B
type uncertanties followed the diagram shown in Figure 7 to
this particular sensor.
The calibration process consisted of heating cycles repeated
four times, from 10 ◦C to 80 ◦C for the optical ﬁber sensor. The
largest uncertainty associated with each sensor is presented
in Table I. With the temperature calibration points, a corre-
sponding function is shown to represent the FBG temperature
(T) response with its Bragg wavelength as showed in Figure
8 to each RFBG. In this case, a second order polynomial

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The same calibration system was used for testing the
bearing sensor in order to apply temperature step function
excitations such as to compare the FBG measurements with a
PT100 used in the generator. The thermal cycles ranged from
15 ◦C to 75 ◦C, lasting for 15 hours. The thermal cycles had
the goal of emulating four loading levels in the hydro generator
(Figure 9): 15 ◦C - turned off, 35 ◦C - energy compensator,
55 ◦C - nominal charge and 75 ◦C - overloaded. The overload
occurs at temperatures above 70 ◦C and the generator is turned
off by the temperature system protection. In Figure 9, the ‘A’
inset indicates a steady state period during the experiment.
It is possible to observe in Figure 9 that the optical ﬁber
Bragg grating sensor temperature measurements follow the

same trend as the PT100 sensor. A small difference is observed
in the time response (inset) that can be accounted for the
distinct positioning inside of the test chamber of the thermal
bath. In four temperature cycles the 3 RFBGs temperature
sensors measured the same value as the PT100 sensor and the
small differences are smaller than the determined uncertainty
for each individual sensor.

the role of reducing the friction between the shaft and the
babbitt shoe metal, and its temperature is an indicator of the
machine operation status. Figure 10 (a) also shows the babbited

CONCLUSION
The potential of integrating ﬁber Bragg grating sensors for
multiplexed on-line monitoring of temperature and temperature
gradients has been experimentally investigated in laboratory
and inside a power plant before this presented work [25]. In
general, it is noticed that the temperature is fully consistent
with the actual operation of the bearing. The presented anal-
ysis can indicate the operating condition of the equipment
and the results demonstrate that this technique is a potential
maintenance tool for predictive purposes with a high efﬁciency
to continuously monitor the hydro generator facilities. The
generator designers could also use these measurements to
improve the machine performance and establish their limits of
safe operation. Future work include temperature measurements
on a bearing to measure the temperature in the turbine bearing
of a hydroelectric 180 MW generator inside the power plant.
