 INTRODUCTION 
Reducing energy demand in the residential buildings is 
an important problem worldwide. Recently, the trends 
toward case of using energy information device such as 
heterogeneous In-Home Displays (IHDs) by consumers are 
gradually growing. In addition, studies for analyzing energy 
saving effect depending on the use of IHD are ongoing 
actively. Consumers using IHD mainly receive feedback 
from energy information of that for energy saving.  Related 
researches are as follows. Faruqui et al. covers 12 direct 
feedback trials using an IHD device between 1989 and 2009, 
including time of use and prepayment trials. Ehrhardt-
Martinez et al. [2] covers 57 studies from 1974 to 2010. This 
is the most comprehensive review to date and splits the 
conservation effects from feedback by study size, era, type of 
feedback and region. In [3], companies with specific, proven 
expertise in making attractive consumer products are quickly 
changing the IHD industry and competition is growing. For 
example, General Electric (GE) recently announced its 
Brillion suite of home energy management products, 
including an IHD. Other researches discuss about direct 
feedback [4][5] and the inexpensive IHD device [6]. IHD is 
also provided with important information using various 
communication interfaces (Ethernet, ZigBee [7][8], and 
WLAN [9]) and security policy [10]-[12]. 
So, in aspect of usage effectiveness of heterogeneous 
IHD, we developed Integrated Operation Monitoring System 
(IOMS) in order to monitor meter data and analyze the effect 
of the energy saving of heterogeneous IHD as an extension 
study of [13].  
We completed the prototype level development of the 
IOMS, and gather and manage the metering data from the 
IHD server. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to 
develop the IOMS that can be monitored by the integrated 
management of metering data of the distributed IHD server, 
and the second objective is to analyze the pattern of metering 
data using the IOMS. Finally, based on the results of the 
pattern analysis, we are about to proceed to reflect to the 
government policy or promote to the energy savings policy.  
Eventually, 
this IOMS is 
useful 
for 
integrated 
management and analysis of metering data of the customers, 
and has the usefulness for the taking advantage of the energy 
savings policy and promotional material. 
The remainder of this article is organized as follows: In 
Section II, we introduce IOMS implementing architecture. In 
Section III, we analyze energy consumption patterns of 
experimental result.  Finally, we present the conclusion in 
section IV. 
II. 
IOMS IMPLEMENTING ARCHITECTURE 
In this section, we implement the IOMS and collect 
metering data. After that we examine the empirical results. 
A. IOMS Interoperable Networking 
IOMS is connected with each heterogeneous IHD server 
through 70Mbps Ethernet (IEEE 802.3). The heterogeneous 
IHD server and AMR server are also connected with 
100Mbps Ethernet. The IHD server is connected to several 
AMR servers, and accesses directly many IHDs through the 
internet. Two types of IHD can be divided into IPTV-based 
IHD and Dedicated Terminal-based IHD. Electricity meters 
to measure the power usage are linked to the AMR server 
through 0.2Mbps RS-485 communication line. The AMR 
server gathers power usage information from each electricity 
meter and transmits the aggregated data to the IOMS. Fig. 1 
describes interoperable networking with each heterogeneous 
IHD server and IOMS. 
B. Implementation Requirement and Function 
The IOMS sends TCP/IP protocol-based control to IHD 
server and receives communication messages from IHD 
server for collecting and saving the meter data. The IOMS 
collects meter data from heterogeneous IHD server 
periodically. The IOMS checks the status of heterogeneous 
IHD server. If the heterogeneous IHD server is off, the 
IOMS saves the status of the heterogeneous IHD server to 
the DB of IOMS and stops the collecting of meter data. After

that, if the status of heterogeneous IHD server is on, the 
IOMS collects and saves meter data again. In order to these 
functionalities of the IOMS, the following requirements must 
be met. 
x Ethernet-based communication interface with IHD 
server must be satisfied. 
x Meter data received from IHD server should be 
encrypted. 
x Meter data of IOMS must be synchronized with that of 
IHD server. 
x Scheduler must read meter data of IHD server 
periodically. 
x In order to user-friendly meter data lookup, web-based 
user interface should be implemented. 
To satisfy IOMS requirement, functional blocks can be 
divided into Network Layer, Data Processing/Management 
Layer and Data Presentation Layer. The Network Layer 
consists of TCP/IP-based data communication block for 
meter 
data 
collection 
and 
monitoring. 
The 
Data 
Processing/Management Layer consists of management 
engine block, analysis engine block and web service 
application server block. The Data Presentation Layer 
consists of operator web portal block for web-based user 
retrieval. Fig. 2 shows IOMS layered architecture. 
At first, the management engine block includes 
following meter data management functions: energy usage 
view and retrieval, which is decrypting the collected 
metering data and then stored in the meter data repository, 
comparison, business IHD servers status identification, file-
based remote meter data upload, documenting for energy 
usage result and extracting to its report, and IHD usage. 
Secondly, the analysis engine block includes energy 
consumption statistics and IHD usage analysis. And finally, 
the web service application server block provides the meter 
data to web services. The Data Presentation Layer consists 
of user interface block for intuitively understanding graphs, 
provided by a java-based GUI in the local and remote meter 
data query, search, and comparison through the web. 
Looking at the main features offered by the IOMS, the 
IHD server status identification function checks that all the 
IHD severs are basically connected on the network for 
collecting the meter data. If the IHD server makes an error 
during collecting the meter data of the IOMS, the IOMS 
attempts to resolve the status of the IHD server for three 
times at 10-second intervals. The IOMS recognizes the 
normal state of the IHD server if the IHD server responds to 
the IOMS during the checking of the IHD server status. 
However, otherwise, the IOMS recognizes abnormal state of 
the IHD server and should retry to check the status of the 
IHD server on every hour. 
Energy usage search and query function retrieves related 
information, applied with meter data which were collected 
from the IHD server through various search criteria, and 
confirms the results of search query. Search criteria could be 
divided into search item, energy type item, period (hourly, 
daily and monthly), business and search region. In this point, 
we can select the item of “date”, “time zone”, “weekday” or 
“weekend + holiday” if want to look up the period as a time 
zone average usage. And we do not need the item of time 
zone if we want to look up the period as an average daily 
usage or an average monthly usage, but only can select the 
item of “date”, “weekday” or “weekend + holiday”. The 
items of search and lookup are shown in Table I.  
The energy usage comparison function can compare the 
experimental group and the control group by setting the 
search criteria and selecting the item that we want to 
compare on the time zone, daily, monthly. The file-based 
remote meter data upload function provides meter data of a

missed section to the IOMS through web GUI by 
administrator directly among meter data that were collected 
from IHD servers. 
 From the items of search criteria, the administrator can 
also upload file-based meter data to the IOMS after 
confirming the missed section with selecting energy item, 
business, search period, and search region. The reporting 
function for documenting and extracting the results of 
energy consumption supports easy documentation, analysis 
from remote client, and energy meter data lookup in the web 
with search criteria. According to these search criteria, the 
energy usage statistics function provides analytical data, 
which can be used for analysis of various results, with 
identifying the information about the energy average usage, 
the energy peak usage and the consumption total energy. 
The IHD usage statistics function supports the ability to 
analyze the IHD utilization level of customer from current 
month price lookup, monthly fee views, hourly statistics, 
daily statistics, monthly statistics, daily usage inquiry, 
monthly usage inquiry, annual usage inquiry, and usage 
comparison.  
The Operator web portal block using JSP user interface 
also provides users with location-based graphic UI of AMR 
server and IHD server depicted as Fig. 3. Operation 
environments of each heterogeneous IHD server to interact 
with IOMS are depicted as Table II. 
C. Secure Internetworking Architecture 
The IOMS is connected to all the IHD server through 
VPN tunneling. The IPSec VPN server is installed on the 
external network side of the IOMS and The IPSec VPN 
client is installed on the external network side of the IHD 
server. In other words, the IPSec VPN hardware-based 
client is installed in front of some IHD server and the IPSec 
VPN software-based client is installed in the rest internal 
IHD server. Therefore, the VPN tunnel must be formed 
between the VPN server and the VPN client if we want to 
complete the VPN connection between the IOMS and the 
IHD server. The VPN tunnel is formed if the encryption key 
value is matched between the VPN server and the VPN 
client after the encryption key value is exchanged between 
VPN server and the VPN client. When the VPN tunnel is 
established, the authentication is completed through Secure 
Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1) between the VPN server and the 
VPN client and the data is encrypted with 3 Data Encryption 
Standard (3DES) between the IOMS and the IHD server. 
We are considering the security aspects for collecting the 
metering data from the public network via the IHD server. 
This means that we need to collect the metering data from 
the public network via the IHD server in aspect of security. 
In addition, the metering data of all the IHD server is 
encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 128) 
in order to protect more securely. Therefore, the metering 
data is encrypted with AES 128 in the IHD server and the 
encrypted data is re-encrypted to 3DES in VPN, and finally 
the re-encrypted data is delivered to the IOMS. The Fig. 4 
shows the secure internetworking architecture for collecting 
the metering data. 
D. Data Internetworking Procedure 
The VPN-based data flow for collecting and saving the 
metering data between the IOMS and the IHD server is 
depicted as Fig. 5. At first, the VPN tunneling is negotiated 
and established between the VPN server and the VPN client. 
Then, the VPN tunnel is completed between the IOMS and

the IHD server. The IOMS also identifies the IHD server 
status periodically through VPN tunnel and collects and 
saves the metering data to the DB. The metering data 
collected from the IHD server decrypts the encoded data due 
to encryption of the metering data, and because subscriber 
numbers are different from each IHD servers, the metering 
data is stored in the DB after converting into the unique 
subscriber numbers. Among the metering data collected from 
the IHD server, we upload the missed meter data with file 
format through the web GUI of the IOMS, and manage and 
save the missed metering data. Additionally, when the IHD 
server is off state, the IOMS saves its state in the DB and 
stops collecting metering data. 
III. 
ENERGY CONSUMPTION ANALYSIS 
In this part, we monitor meter data through IOMS and 
analyze the power consumption patterns in according to 
usage of heterogeneous IHD. The consumer uses the IHD for 
identifying the energy usage information. So the IHD 
function is inducing energy saving actively. From this 
perspective, we expected different energy saving rate in 
according to these energy information display infrastructure. 
So we distinguished IPTV-based IHD (IIHD) from 
Dedicated Terminal-based IHD (DIHD) by information 
display infrastructure. Mandatory information is the same in 
all IHD, but optional information may be different depending 
on the type of terminal.  
In case of Apartment on a weekday in 2012, we analyzed 
the hourly average power consumption. But in case of 
Commercial Building and Apartment-type Factory, we only 
analyzed the hourly average power consumption pattern. The 
customers of the number of 19,720 were participated in the 
survey for the Apartment, and the customers of the number 
of 2,780 and 4,000 were involved in the survey respectively 
for the Individual Commercial Building and the APT-type 
Factory.  Table III represents the hourly power consumption 
in the Apartment between the experimental group of the 
IIHD and the control group of the DIHD.   
As a result, the average daily power consumption per 
household is 10 kWh. Fig. 6 describes load profile of hourly 
average power consumption of apartment in case of IIHD 
and DIHD. As we can identify this graph, households using 
DIHD reduce more 0.05 kWh than that of households using 
IIHD. This result implies as follows. The more the customer 
is exposed to the energy usage information, the more the 
energy saving consciousness can be affected. In other words, 
DIHD provides energy usage information during 24-hour-a-
day, but IIHD provides energy usage information during 
watching TV. Therefore, we can expect to provide the 
motivation to participate in active energy savings in case of 
using DIHD.  
And energy saving factors can be considered as the 
method of information and the time of information. In this 
paper, we focused on the comparative analysis of the 
heterogeneous IHD users and Korean Style Residential 
Buildings. However, for the qualitative analysis, we will 
study the research topic of comparative analysis issues 
between metering data and questionnaire survey. In other 
words, in order to gain some qualitative insight from 
collected metering data, we will study the energy saving 
index through conducting a survey of participants.  
As shown in Fig. 7, for the seasonal hourly average 
power consumption among the weekday, we can see that the 
apartment residents who use the IHD consume more 1.7 
kWh in the summer than compared to other seasons with the 
average daily power consumption. Due to using the air

conditioning in the summer, we can see that the power 
consumption in the summer compared to the other seasons 
will be used more. 
Also, 
we 
compared 
the 
hourly 
average 
power 
consumption among the DIHD-based APT, the DIHD-based 
APT-type 
Factory 
and 
the 
DIHD-based 
Individual 
Commercial Building. Because the APT-type Factory and 
the Individual Commercial Building use only DIHD, we 
cannot compare directly the DIHD and the IIHD. Thus, 
depending on the type of each building, we are about to 
distinguish the intuitive difference from the hourly average 
power consumption. As shown in Fig. 8, in case of the APT-
type Factory, the hourly average power consumption is 
approximately 5 times more than that of the Apartment. And 
in case of the Individual Commercial Building, we know that 
the hourly average power consumption is approximately 6 
times more than that of the Apartment. In addition, the APT-
type Factory consumes more 3.21 times than that of the 
Apartment in terms of the average daily power consumption 
and the Individual Commercial Building consumes more 
3.42 times than that of the Apartment in terms of the average 
daily power consumption. 
In future research, we will analyze the energy saving rate 
using DIHD through the power statistical reports of the APT-
type Factory and the Individual Commercial Building. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we designed the IOMS layered architecture, 
and developed IOMS to interact with Heterogeneous IHD 
server. The IOMS monitors energy usage information from 
the Korean style residential building which is installed with 
Heterogeneous IHD, and collects energy usage information. 
When we analyzed energy usage information patterns in 
IOMS, we found that the increasing frequency of 
information providing of the energy consumption is 
proportional to the energy savings. Therefore, we concluded 
that the method of information and the time of information as 
well as seasonal factors, residential building types are 
important factors in energy saving effectiveness through this 
study. 
For future study, we will analyze a wide variety profile-
based energy usage pattern of Korean style residential 
building type and will research the correlation of energy 
saving effectiveness through comparative analysis between 
non-IHD user and IHD user.
