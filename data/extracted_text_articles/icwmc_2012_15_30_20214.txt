Abstract−MIMO system recently emerged as a solution for 
the provision of wireless communications to improve capacity 
and decrease bit error rate. One of MIMO variant, which is 
used in this paper, is Space Time Block Code (STBC). STBC 
allows diversity gain using combination of spatial and time 
dimension without changing its bandwidth requirements. This 
paper presents an implementation of MIMO STBC 2x1 and 2x2 
on HAPS channel with the assumption that the channel state 
condition is known at the receiver (perfect CSIR). HAPS 
channel characteristic is known to follow Ricean distribution in 
which it depends on its K factor. In case of HAPs, K factor also 
depends on its elevation angle. Using computer simulation, this 
paper analyzes HAPs channel performance using MIMO STBC 
2x1 and 2x2 on the various of elevation angles. It is shown that 
MIMO STBC 2x1 and 2x2 are able to increase performance of 
HAPs channel including HAPs channel at low elevation angle. 
However from our simulation capacity improvement of MIMO 
STBC is obtained insignificant, therefore we propose MIMO 
spatial multiplexing, which is another variant of MIMO to 
obtain more capacity. 
Keywords− HAPs; MIMO; STBC; Ricean channel; K factor;

I.  INTRODUCTION 
High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) is an object floating on a 
stratospheric 
layer 
bringing 
wireless 
communication 
equipment at approximately 17-22 km above the ground. 
HAPs is able to exploit much the advantages and at the same 
time overcome the drawback of the traditional systems in 
terms of propagation delay and path loss suffered by satellite 
system or a huge number of base station required by the 
terrestrial system. 
In our previous research [1], HAPs channel characteristic 
which is experimentally measured in semi-urban environment, 
deteriorates at low elevation angle. In other word the 
performance of HAPs communication needs improvement for 
the users who are located at the edge coverage. Measurement 
result shows that for low elevation angle, i.e. lower than 400, 
fading depth is observed to be approximately 25 dB or more. 
Such huge fading depth, of course, will limit HAPs service 
coverage to elevation angle only higher than 400 or about 50 
km in diameter of service coverage. To overcome such 
problems MIMO STBC is proposed in this work. MIMO 
STBC which allow diversity gain is expected to improve bad 
channel condition especially for low elevation angles.   
MIMO is simply defined as an use of more than one 
antenna at transmitter and/or receiver. There are two kinds of 
MIMO called Spatial Multiplexing (SM) and Space Time 
Block Code (STBC). On this paper, we use MIMO STBC 
with 2 antennas transmitter with combination of 1 and 2 
antennas at receiver. HAPS is then used as transmitter and 
both antennas is placed onboard the platform as depicted in 
Fig 1. The previous research [3] have shown that MIMO can 
be implemented on single HAPs with specific spacing 
between them depend on its frequency. For 2.4 GHz, both 
antennas must be separated about 12 meters. Simulation is 
then runned by MATLAB R2008a. The  variables that are 
used in the simulation is elevation angle from 10 – 90 degree 
which represent the K factor and operating frequency at 1.2 
and 2.4 GHz. 
The remaining part of this paper is outlined as follows. 
Section 2 
presents 
channel 
model 
and propagation 
characteristic in a HAPs system. Section 3 reviews in detail a 
concept of MIMO STBC. Simulation model is explained in 
Section 4. Section 5 shows simulation result, and finally, 
concluding remark is drawn in Section 6. 
 
 
II. HAPS CHANNEL MODEL AND PROPAGATION 
CHARACTERISTIC 
Generally, there are some propagation phenomena that 
can happen on HAPS channels as follow: Free space path 
loss, multipath fading, rain attenuation, gas absorption, and 
scintillation [2]. Most of them are frequency dependence. 
Rain attenuation, gas absorption, and scintillation are 
significant only on a high operating frequency, i.e. above 10 
GHz. While this paper used freq 1.2 and 2.4 GHz, all of them 
will be ignored on the formulation and simulation. 
In case of HAPs channel, Ricean fading is a general case 
of fading channel model that there are two components of 
signal arrive at the receiver. First component arrive at receiver

Fig. 8  Performance of MISO STBC 2x1 (freq 2.4 GHz; elevation 0-900). 
 
 
By adding one more antenna in receiver, the configuration 
is now change to MIMO STBC 2x2. In Fig. 9, simulation 
shows that this model can make significant improvement 
better than the previous SISO or MISO 2x1. It has 4-17 dB 
improvement compared to SISO and 3-6 dB compared to 
MISO 2x1 at BER value 10-3 for all elevation angles. 
 
By comparing all simulation results we have, it also 
shown that when the elevation angle is decreased (ground 
station is getting farther from HAPS), the impact of 
implementation MISO and MIMO STBC is bigger than in a 
high elevation angle. It can be understand because of MIMO 
STBC configuration is generally good for fading handling, 
while fading is depending on transmitter-receiver position. In 
a low elevation angle, fading is more severe because the path 
from transmitter to receiver is covered by building, trees, or 
another obstacle makes a NLOS signal. 
While comparing MISO STBC 2x1 and MIMO STBC 2x2 
on HAPS channel based on its elevation angle. At high 
elevation angle values, the performance of MISO STBC 2x1 
is much worse than MIMO STBC 2x2, although it always still 
better than SISO 1x1. But at low elevation angles, the 
improvement is as significant as MIMO STBC 2x2. 
In general, we found performances of MISO 2x1 and 
MIMO STBC 2x2 on HAPs channel are superior against 
SISO 1x1. From this results, we can also analyze the 
performance improvement from coverage area point of view. 
As mentioned before, elevation angles are so important 
variable in HAPS system. It can, not only represent the 
condition of Ricean channel, but also the coverage area itself. 
Fig. 10 shows the radius of coverage area of HAPs can be 
increased significantly from 7.28 km (SISO) to 16.78 km 
(MISO STBC 2x1) and 113.4 km (MIMO STBC 2x2). 
Now, for the capacity analysis, we only use 3 elevation 
angles to make a simply understanding result (10, 40, and 90 
deg). Simulation shows that MIMO STBC and MIMO Spatial 
Multiplexing (SM) have quite similar curve for frequency 2.4 
GHz and 1.2 GHz, so that we show only result for 2.4 GHz as 
in Fig. 11 for MIMO STBC and Fig. 12 for MIMO SM. We 
can see that elevation angles have significant impact on the

influences. It means that for MIMO STBC and MIMO SM,

quite long measurement time (ergodic), the elevation angles 
variables can be ignored, but not for outage capacity analysis. 
  
When both curves of MIMO STBC and MIMO SM are 
combined together with the HAPs SISO at same elevation 
angle, the result is shown in Fig. 13.  As we mentioned 
before, MIMO STBC and MIMO SM have a quite similar 
shape of curve, but when they are put together on one graph, 
its clearly shown that MIMO SM have a slope sharper than 
STBC. It means that MIMO SM is much more better in 
increasing capacity than STBC. Then SISO curve is used as a 
comparison (red line). We can see the line of SISO is very 
close together with the STBC. It means STBC is not a good 
method for improving HAPS channel capacity. Note that to 
comparing between its 3 configurations (SISO, MIMO STBC, 
and MIMO SM) we only use the ergodic capacity which is 
equivalent with Shannon capacity in SISO model. 
MIMO STBC is different with MIMO SM. When MIMO 
SM separated two symbol stream to each antenna, STBC 
doesn’t. As mentioned before, STBC uses Alamouti encoding 
which separate data in two part for each antenna Tx, then 
makes a “duplicate” behind them that will be sent on next 
time slot (t + T). For this we can understand why MIMO SM

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
Performance analysis of MIMO STBC on HAPS Channel 
has been proposed in this paper. Simulation result shows that 
STBC 2x1 can improve BER performance from HAPS SISO 
1x1 configuration (1-11 dB on BER 10-3), while MIMO 
STBC 2x2 even can improve more significant from SISO 4-
17 dB on the same BER value for all elevation angles. By 
adding more antennas in receiver or transmitter may can 
improve a better performances. For high elevation angles (50-
90 deg), the use of MIMO STBC 2x2 is much more 
significant than STBC 2x1. All of this improvement can also 
increase the radius of HAPS coverage. From 7.28 km (SISO) 
to 16.78 km (MISO STBC 2x1) and  113.4 km (MIMO STBC 
2x2).  
MIMO STBC can really improve the BER performance of 
HAPS system, but not the capacity. Simulation results shows 
that MIMO STBC have no improvement comparing to HAPS 
SISO configuration. To increase it, we can use another 
MIMO variant called Spatial Multiplexing.
