Abstract—This paper presents a multi-dimensional high-order
gas-kinetic scheme on moving mesh to simulate unsteady flows
of freely falling plates or thin coins. The two-dimensional
scheme has previously been successfully implemented on freely
falling plates, where the rich dynamical behavior, such as
fluttering
and
tumbling
motion,
was
analyzed
and
the
quantitative comparison has been provided between the
experimental measurement and numerical computation. In the
past several years, a three-dimensional gas-kinetic scheme on
moving grid has also been developed to compute fluid
problems with moving boundaries. In this work in progress
paper, both the modified grid velocity and high-order gas-
kinetic scheme are developed to improve the above gas-kinetic
method, which is applied for simulating three-dimensional
freely falling thin disks.

INTRODUCTION
It is a fact that not all falling objects travel straight
downwards, such as leaves, tree seeds, and paper cards
dropped from a table. Obviously, falling leaves and
tumbling sheets of paper can get a lift momentarily to float
upward against gravity as they flutter (oscillate from side to
side) or tumble (rotate and drift sideways) through still air.
To explain this complicated natural phenomenon, the
knowledge of the instantaneous fluid forces is required. As
we know, most objects moving in a fluid encounter unsteady
aerodynamic forces. Therefore, the two-dimensional problem
of falling plates has been investigated numerically by solving
the Navier-Stokes equation following a moving body, where
the instantaneous fluid force for the fluttering and tumbling
motion has been analyzed [6].
Considering that the motion of freely falling body is
usually a three-dimensional problem, further, the falling
behavior of a circular thin disk has been investigated
experimentally [4] [5]. Three dimensionless ratios have been
proposed to characterize the flow:

The geometric aspect-ratio parameter λ is small for thin
disks, with dimensionless moment of inertia I* and the

which
are
most
important
for
describing the dynamics of the disk motion. The free-fall
motion of three-dimensional bodies is more complex due to
an extra degree of freedom, so numerical simulation
becomes more difficult as well. The gas-kinetic scheme on
moving mesh for calculating two-dimensional freely falling
plates [1] has been developed to simulate three-dimensional
viscous fluids with moving boundaries [2]. In this work in
progress paper, both the modified grid velocity distribution
and high-order scheme are developed to improve the above
gas-kinetic method, which has been applied for simulating
three-dimensional freely falling thin disks. The complicated
dynamics behavior of three-dimensional free-fall thin coins
is obtained numerically.
This paper is organized as follows. Firstly, Section 2
introduces
the
three-dimensional
high-order
gas-kinetic
scheme with the modified grid velocity. Secondly, Section 3
shows some formulation for the free-fall motion of a circular
thin disk in still water with a focus on the planar zigzag
motion. Thirdly, in Section 4, the rich fluid dynamics
behavior is analyzed by subsequent numerical results which
are also compared with experimental data and figures.

THREE-DIMENSIONAL HIGH-ORDER GAS-KINETIC
SCHEME ON MOVING MESH
Under a generalized coordinate transformation with
arbitrary grid velocity, the gas-kinetic Bhatnagar-Gross-
Krook (BGK) [8] equation is reformulated in a moving
frame of reference. Then, a conservative gas-kinetic scheme
is developed for the viscous flow computation in the
moving system in Eulerian space. Due to the coupling
between the grid velocity and the overall solution algorithm,
the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods become two limiting
cases
in
the
current
method.
A
fully
conservative
formulation can be obtained, even in the Lagrangian limit,
as shown in [2].
The BGK model of the approximate Boltzmann equation
in three-dimensional space can be written as:
t
x
y
z
g
f
f

Here, f is the gas distribution function and g is the
equilibrium state approached by f. Both f and g are functions
of space (x, y, z), time t, particle velocity (u, v, w), and
internal variableς . The particle collision time τ is related to
the viscosity and heat conduction coefficients. In this paper,
we are focusing on the modified grid velocity in the cell
interface numerical flux evaluation, while both the gas-

kinetic scheme on moving mesh and the high-order gas-
kinetic scheme are addressed in [2] and [7], respectively.
We can rewrite the mesh velocity for each point on the
cell interface as:

On the right hand side, the first term is the mean flux
with a piecewise constant mesh velocity

, which is the
same as the one in [2]. For the second term, it is a correction
on each interface point, which reduces the difference
between the real flux crossing each interface point and the
mean flux F .

MOTION DESCRIPTION FOR FREE-FALL THIN DISK
Previously, the gas-kinetic scheme on moving mesh has
been applied successfully to simulate the experiment of two-
dimensional falling cards [6]. Figure 1 shows a good
agreement between the two-dimensional numerical result
and the experimental data in [6]. The work in [4] and [5]
experimentally investigates the three-dimensional free-fall
motions of a circular thin disk in still water with three
different trajectories, namely, zigzag, transition, and spiral,

as in Figure 2. This paper focuses on the numerical
simulation for the three-dimensional experiments. At present,
we are working on the numerical study for the zigzag motion:
namely, the description of moving trajectories and analysis
for unsteady aerodynamics.
Consider the two different motions, translation and
rotation. The translation acceleration is calculated by Newton
law, and rotational angular acceleration is computed by the
following formulas:

CONCLUSIONS
Based on the two-dimensional successful numerical
simulation for unsteady aerodynamics of free-fall card
motion [1], the three-dimensional high-order moving grid
gas-kinetic scheme was developed, and was improved by the
modified grid velocity and high order scheme in recent work.
At present, the above method is applied to calculate the
three-dimensional freely falling thin disks, and the research
work of the numerical simulation is in progress. We expect
to obtain a good agreement between numerical results and
experimental data.
