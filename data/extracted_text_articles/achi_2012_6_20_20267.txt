Abstract—After suffering a more severe disease like spinal cord 
injury or stroke patients are often not able to interact or even 
communicate with their environment anymore, especially at the 
beginning of rehabilitation. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) 
can substitute this temporarily lost communication channels and 
might support rehabilitation by providing an alternative way for 
controlling a computer only by thoughts without any muscle 
activity. This enables the patient to communicate by writing 
letters on the screen, to stay socially in contact with friends or 
people outside the rehabilitation facility by participating in 
games like Second Life, where they may appear as healthy 
persons. Another application isto control items in their room 
connected to the BCI system like the lights which can be turned 
off and on as it can be done in a virtual smart home without 
leaving the bed. In this paper, the technology of such BCIs and 
the mentioned applications are described utilizing the P300 
approach. A generic BCI interface is presented, which allows 
controlling them and concurrently and transparently switching 
among them. The results of a recent study show that a BCI can 
be used by patients suffering from cervical spinal cord injury 
almost as well as by healthy people which encourages us to think 
it may assist rehabilitation regarding the social aspect. A variety 
of BCI can be implemented with the aim of provide them a more 
active and accessible lives.

INTRODUCTION 
Many disorders can affect or even completely damage the 
usual communication channels a person needs to communicate 
and interact with his or her environment. Spinal cord injury, 
stroke and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), for example, 
can result in partial or complete loss of voluntary muscle 
activities including speech. In such severe cases, a Brain-
Computer Interface (BCI) might be the only remaining 
possibility 
to 
communicate 
[1]. 
BCI 
based 
on 
Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a new non-invasive 
communication channel between the human brain and a 
computer without using any muscle activity. It measures and 
analyzes the electrical brain activity during predefined mental 
tasks and translates them into the corresponding action 
intended by the user. But, even for less severe levels of 
affection, a BCI can improve quality of life of partially 
paralyzed patients during rehabilitation by enabling them to 
control a computer and specially prepared electronic devices, 
or to stay in contact with friends through social networks and 
games, for example. 
BCIs based on P300, positive-going waves with a peak 
typically at typical latency of 300-1000 ms from stimulus 
onset, provide goal-oriented control and are mainly used for 
spelling devices. Farwell and Donchin were one of the first 
pioneers who used the P300 for communication [2]. 
Furthermore, this approach can also be used for game control 
[3] or navigation (e.g., moving a computer mouse [4]). The 
P300 evoked potential is elicited when a unlikely event occurs 
randomly between events with high probability. It manifests 
itself in a positive deflection in the amplitude of the EEG signal 
around 300ms after a visual stimulus onset. Different 
classification techniques have been evaluated for P300 spellers 
whereby both the Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis and the 
stepwise linear discriminant analysis yielded very robust 
performances [5]. These classification methods need to be 
trained on each individual subject to adapt them to the 
particular brain activity behavior of a person. However, 
training of such a BCI system can be accomplished within 
several minutes [6]. Guger et al. demonstrated that more than 
70% of a sample population is able to use such a spelling setup 
with an accuracy of 100% [9]. 
This paper presents a generic User Datagram Protocol 
(UDP), Extensible Markup Language (XML) based BCI 
command interface (according to the recently introduced 
international BCI interface standard, see www.gtec.at) and its 
application to implement control interfaces enabling social 
interactions like spelling, interacting virtually with other 
participants in Second Life, operating Twitter and controlling a 
virtual smart home. All of these applications are based on the 
P300 speller principle. Results of a spelling application study 
done with 100 healthy people will be compared to a recent 
study also including spinal cord injury patients showing that 
this type of a BCI would be suited for rehabilitation assistance. 
This paper presents different applications (Twitter 
Interface, Virtual Smart Home Control and a Generic Control 
Interface ) tested with healthy people. The outcomes from them 
are shown in different tables in Section III. 
 
II. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS 
For a P300 spelling device, a 6x6 matrix of different 
characters and symbols is commonly presented on a computer 
screen [7]. In single-character mode all characters are flashed 
in a random order but only one character after each. In row-
column mode, a whole row or a whole column flashes at a 
time. The subject has to concentrate on a specific letter he or 
she wants to write. The flashing of exactly this character or the 
corresponding row or column is a relative unlikely event which 
induces a P300 component in the EEG signal reaching its 
maximum amplitude around 300 ms after the onset of the flash.

ACHI 2012 : The Fifth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

For all other characters, rows or columns no such P300 
component is elicited because they are not relevant to the 
subject currently. 
To measure the P300 component acquisition of EEG, 
signals from 8 electrode positioned mostly over occipital and 
parietal regions is sufficient [8]. To train the BCI system, an 
arbitrary word like LUCAS is announced to the system to be 
aware of which characters the subject is supposed to 
concentrate on (targets) and which not (non-targets). Each of 
these letters respectively, each row and column flashes several 
times e.g., for 100 ms per flash. The subject focuses on each of 
these letters, one after the other, and increments a mentally 
running count whenever the letter flashes the subject is 
currently concentrating on. EEG data of a specific time interval 
around each flash is then sent to a Linear Discriminant 
Analysis (LDA) classifier to learn to distinguish the typical 
EEG signal form of the target characters from the typical signal 
form of all other non-targets. 
The applications described in the following were solely 
tested with healthy people. All of the following applications are 
based on the same principle and setup. They basically differ in 
the content of the matrix where letters may be replaced by 
symbols or phrases to control the associated applications. 
A. P300 Twitter Interface 
Through the social network Twitter (Twitter Inc.), users can 
exchange messages. These messages can be sent over the 
Twitter website, by smart phones or by SMS (Short Message 
Service). They are displayed on the author’s profile page and 
are limited to 140 characters per message. Interfacing 
possibilities can be extended through the application 
programming interface provided by Twitter. 
The control mask of the classical speller application was 
extended to add the necessary Twitter control commands in the 
first two lines (Fig. 1). The remaining characters are used for 
spelling resulting in a total of 54 possible symbols. Fig. 3 
shows the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram of 
required actions for using the Twitter service. 
The system was initially trained with 10 target symbols for 
the BCI user. Then, another user was asking questions through 
Twitter and the BCI user had to answer each question every 
other day. A total of 9 questions were asked which means that 
the BCI user had to use the P300 interface on 9 different days 
whereas they selected between 6 and 36 characters each day. 
 
B. Virtual Smart Home Control 
A virtual 3D representation of a smart home was designed 
based on the XVR environment (eXtreme Virtual Reality, 
University of Pisa) [10] [11]. Seven different control masks 
were developed for the P300 BCI in order to control the virtual 
smart home environment. 
 
 Fig. 2 shows two example views of the virtual apartment 
with their corresponding control masks. The pictures on the top 
show a 3D view of the living room (Fig. 2a) and the 
corresponding main control mask (Fig. 2b) enabling the user to 
control some of the devices in the living room like the TV set, 
the room light or the telephone. Fig. 2c shows a bird’s-eye 
view of the virtual apartment. The living room, for example, 
can be found in its top left corner and the bathroom is located 
in the bottom right corner together with the entrance door. 
Using the related “GoTo” P300 BCI control mask (Fig. 2d), the 
user can beam himself to 21 different locations in the 
apartment. Using the seven control masks, it should be possible 
for users to switch the lighton and off, to open and close the 
doors and windows, to control the TV set, to use the phone, to 
play music, to operate the video camera at the entrance, to walk 
around in the house and to move their selvesto a specific place 
in the apartment. 
The subjects were instructed to avoid unnecessary 
movements and to accomplish some specific tasks like opening 
the front door, moving to specific places in the apartment or 
manipulating the light source or the room temperature. Further 
details on the setup and results can be found in [10]. 
 
C. Generic Control Interface 
The interface was designed with the intention to control 
multiple applications and devices simultaneously and to 
provide a common way of sharing BCI control in a consistent 
manner among them. The various applications, like the Twitter 
(Section II.A), differ in the content of the P300 BCI matrix 
where letters may be replaced by symbols or phrases to control 
the associated applications.  
In a first step, the possible control states and the commands 
available in each state to move on to the next state are 
identified using Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, 
which yield a simple and clear overview of all required 
elements. Based on the diagrams, the detailed descriptions of 
the states and the actions to be taken along with the transition

to the next state, an XML file describing the required masks, 
the position of the different symbols within the mask and the 
commands to call is generated for each application. Upon 
startup, the initial interface descriptions of the different 
applications are merged and symbols are added for switching 
among them. Fig. 3 shows the UML diagram for the Twitter 
application. Fig. 1 shows the P300 mask resulting thereof. 
Whenever a control symbol or character is selected by the user, 
the BCI emits the command or character string associated with 
the symbol or executes the related action. 
Alternatively, the interface allows for online updating the 
control mask of the application in reaction to its current internal 
state or the state of its environment in real-time. Thereby, it 
sends the adopted description of the control mask to the 
interface unit through the UDP network socket. At the 
beginning of the next flash cycle, the BCI interface will load 
this updated mask and present it to the user for the selection of 
the appropriate commands. 
III. 
RESULTS 
The interface was implemented for and tested with the two 
applications, Twitter and Second Life presented above. For the 
2 systems, the control states were identified using UML state 
diagrams. Based on these the control mask, descriptions were 
generated, merged and the symbols for switching between the 
applications were added. In the following sections, some the 
results achieved for each of the applications are discussed. 
The EEG data were recorded for all above applications 
including the interface test applications with a g.MOBIlab+ 
Biosignal Amplification Unit (g.tec medical engineering 
GmbH, Austria) at 256 Hz sample rate and transferred to the 
computer wirelessly via Bluetooth®. A MATLAB/Simulink 
model controls the interface masks, processes the received data 
via a specific device driver and dispatches the targeted 
commands via the described UDP XML message passing 
interface. A notch filter (50 Hz or 60 Hz) and a band pass filter 
were applied to the signals in order to eliminate possible 
artifacts before they were down-sampled to 64 Hz. Data from 
100 ms before each flash onset to 700ms afterwards were 
filtered and down-sampled again to get 12 feature values (i.e. 
samples) per channel and flash. These data chunks were sent to 
the LDA to determine if a target character flashed or not. The 
subjects were sitting or standing, dependent on the application, 
in front of a computer screen and were instructed to relax as 
much as possible. 
A. P300 Twitter Interface 
Table I shows the results of the answers from the BCI user 
(bold sentences) to the 9 questions (italic sentences). The 
improvement of the user’s performance from the first session to 
the last one is interesting.  
For the first session, it took the user 11:09 min to spell 13 
characters with 3 mistakes. The user was instructed to correct 
any mistake yielding an average of 51 seconds selection time 
for each character. In contrast to this, the last session was 
accomplished in a time of 6:38 min for 27 characters with only 
1 mistake resulting in an average selection time of 15 seconds 
per character. The number of flashes per character decreased 
from 8 to only 3 flashes as well.

B. Virtual Smart Home Control 
A total of 12 healthy subjects participated in the case study. 
The system was trained on 42 selected target symbols for each 
subject. In contrast to the previous applications, the subjects 
were standing in front of a 3D power wall for projection of the 
virtual smart home while using this BCI. 
In the virtual smart home study, the subjects needed 
between 3 and 10 flashes per character (mean 5.2 flashes per 
character) to achieve an accuracy of 95% in single-character 
mode [10]. Table II lists the accuracy of all subjects for each of 
the 7 control masks among other parameters. The more 
symbols a mask contains, the lower is the probability of 
occurrence of one symbol. This results in an increase of the 
amplitude of the P300 component in the EEG signal. Also the 
time needed to select a single character increases because it 
takes the system more time to flash all the characters.  
Interestingly, the subjects achieved only 26.39% accuracy 
for the “Go to” mask, which is quite bad compared to the other 
control masks. We think this is due to its different layout. 
While all the other control masks were arranged in a matrix 
layout, the “Go to” mask was the only one where the symbols 
were placed at apparently random positions related to the 
appearance of the virtual apartment. More detailed results of 
the virtual smart home study can be found in [10]. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
Extending the standard P300 speller by icons and symbols 
enables the user to control more complex scenarios. In [10], it 
is shownthat a proper design of interface masks allows control 
of domotic devices in avirtual smart home study with 
comparable reliability as it has been reached for the spelling 
application. This paper discusses the usage of the BCI 
interfaceto control smart homes or operating social interaction 
applications like sending or answering Twitter messages.The 
generic BCI interface which uses XML based description files 
simplifies the definition of the control masks. By merging the 
control masks of several applications like Twitter and 
environments like a virtual smart home, it is possible to use the 
different systems concurrently. To switch to another 
application, it is sufficient to select the symbol or sequences of 
symbols used to load its control mask. If not running, the 
application will be started and initialized to receive the control 
commands from the BCI. 
In a recent study, Guger et al. evaluated a P300 speller  
(6x6character matrix) in row-column mode with 100 healthy 
subjects (32 female and 68 male at the age of 27.9 ± 10.9) 
using a similar setup as described in this study [9]. Using a 
subset of 81 subjects, 88.9% of them were able to use the 
speller with an accuracy level of 80-100% whereas 72.8% 
reached an accuracy of 100%. The average accuracy level was 
91.1% with a spelling time of 28.8 seconds for a single 
character. Since this speller is based on the same P300 
principle, the results indicate that the previously described 
applications might also perform better using row-column mode 
instead of single-character mode.  
The results of the study show that a P300 brain-computer 
interface can also be used by patients suffering from more 
severe diseases. This encourages us to think that a BCI may be 
helpful during rehabilitation. Especially when people are bound 
to bed or rehabilitation facilities, it is important to keep them 
socially engaged. The applications described here help people 
to keep in touch with friends and other people all around the 
world through popular social networks and platforms, like 
Twitter. Another important fact is that patients may appear as 
healthy people, for example,in Second Life,which may be a 
benefit regarding psychological aspects to let the disability fade 
from people’s minds. Furthermore, a BCI can also be used for 
wheelchair control, which many authors identify as their target 
application. However, there are still some minimum 
requirements to operate a BCI. In fact, there is a certain 
percentage of the population (including healthy people as well) 
that is not able to operate a specific type of BCI at all, which 
may have various reasons [13].
