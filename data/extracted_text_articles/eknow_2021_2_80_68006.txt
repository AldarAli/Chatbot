Abstract— This study presents a systematic review using the 
Kitchenham method, to analyze recent research works related 
to blockchain technology and its application in training. The 
problems of exchanging data safely and rapidly with 
transparency and centralization, led to the emergence of this 
technology that has revolutionized the world and in almost all 
areas. Different articles are devoted to show the various 
approaches, equipped, methods, skills, knowledge, etc., 
necessary to the application of the blockchain. The main 
objective of this study is to reveal the importance of this 
technology for the development of industrial and educational 
world showing different skills, competencies, talents required 
to implement a blockchain, and use it for management and 
education. 
Keywords- blockchain; training; skills; competencies.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The lack of confidence and dissatisfaction with third 
parties and traditional mediators, institutions, banks and 
states, led to the creation of many research challenges in 
different fields such as: technology, economy, politics and 
sociology [23]. To face this problem, researches are directed 
towards blockchain technology i.e. a technology for storing 
and transmitting information, allowing the constitution of 
replicated and distributed registers, without a central 
controlling institution, with a high degree of security, thanks 
to encryption methods and transmission protocols [16]. It is 
structured by blocks linked to each other, at regular time 
intervals [24]. Researchers consider the blockchain as a 
double-edged sword technology; it has been considered the 
safest peer-to-peer system [15]. Schematically, the necessary 
environment for the implementation of a blockchain can 
resemble to a 4 layers structure (Fig.1) [19]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. The blockchain structure [19] 
 Nowadays, researchers are very interested by blockchain 
technology, with its integration in all fields (Fig. 2) [17]. In 
order to catch up the fast-paced development of industrial 
technologies, which requires adaptation to the evolution of 
the world and the development of interaction with other 
disciplines and new approaches, therefore it is essential to 
align the supply of skills with the fast changing of economic 
needs. This requires sound education policies as well as 
transformation of education and training systems, as there 
are signs that educational institutions are not keeping pace 
with technological advancement, leading to skills shortages 
[18].

 Fifteen articles are used, through a systematic review, 
using the Kitchenham method [21], a manual division of the 
articles throughout the reading presented in the diagram (Fig. 
3). We choose as criteria: the field of application (education, 
industry) and application methods (analytical, practical).  
Section 2 of this article is devoted to detailing the 15 articles, 
where we will provide an overview of the use of blockchain 
technology, to improve teaching process, and ensure mastery 
of the technology and training talent. Section 3 concerns the 
digitizing the human resources area in industry thanks to 
blockchain technology. We will finish by a conclusion.  
II. EDUCATION AND TRAINING FACE THE BLOCKCHAIN 
TECHNOLOGY 
According to reports published recently through web 
sites, the blockchain will be the most demanded skill by 
employers and these profiles are highly demanded [25]. To 
meet the needs of employers and understand the challenges 
of this technology, universities have adopted special 
blockchain training techniques to attract the attention of 
students, and to achieve the desired skills to master the 
difficulties of this technology to improve the teaching 
process. Table 2 presents research that highlight the 
importance of blockchain technology at the training level 
(training of future talents, adapting new training techniques) 
of technology.

A. The need to train Blockchain technology talents 
Over time, the challenges of training around the 
blockchain technology (BCT) multiply, and the question 
asked is: How to get real "relevant skills" of blockchain 
projects if there is no comprehensive and practical training 
on the subject? To solve the issue and identify the challenges 
and training needs for the mastery of technology, authors of 
[3] analyze an inventory of current training in the BCT 
around the world, through a global survey, where they paid 
particular attention to security issues. They offered training 
divided into two groups where the first is designed  for 
distance education only and the second for full-time face-to-
face training (not online), with a list of standards and books 
that can support this training and specify the skills sought 
after mastering a full-time BCT course with exemplary 
course structure. [12] has analyzed the possibilities of 
business education in teaching the use of blockchain 
technology for business development. Based on an expert 
survey, the main provisions of the business training course 
"Blockchain: Basic Principles and Application Examples" 
have been developed, the skills and learning outcomes for 
this course have been determined, and the sample business 
program “Blockchain: Fundamentals and Application 
Examples” were presented. 
In order to contribute to the economic development of 
South Bay, authors of [13] relied on a case study informed 
by interviews with experts in the fields of BCT and the 
workforce of the industrial sector, as well as through a 
literature review and analysis of labor force trends for the 
region, to inform public officials and policy makers working 
on issues of new technologies, regional economic 
development, and investment in the workforce. According to 
this study, answers suggest that those in the majority of 
industrial sectors see the potential of blockchain as a 
disruptive and positive force in their workplace. Many 
answers highlight the potential of blockchain investments to 
expand their workplaces, whether by increasing operational 
efficiency, reducing transaction costs, or creating new 
growth opportunities. 
Other researchers find that BCT involves a lot of 
theoretical knowledge, which can easily discourage students' 
enthusiasm for learning. To bridge the gap between 
theoretical and practical knowledge, the authors have tried to 
make learning easier. This is the case with [7] where the 
authors analyzed the technical requirements of a local 
company in the city of Weifang, they came up with a task-
oriented strategy, to train blockchain talents in application-
oriented universities.  They adopt the concept of 
“collaborative industry-university education”, a strategy that 
takes into account the real knowledge levels of students in 
applied universities and sets a reasonable degree of learning 
difficulty. The strategy has been applied to the School of 
Computer Engineering of Weifang University and some 
positive effects have been achieved.  
For their part, the authors of [6] and [14] have integrated 
experiential learning theories using game concepts to engage, 
motivate and attract student interest to acquire more 
knowledge. In [14], the authors suggest one of the first 
educational tools for blockchain training using an adversarial 
adaptive sandbox serious game approach for students and 
tech professionals, which can improve cybersecurity in 
management 
systems 
information 
where 
blockchain 
technology impregnates the corresponding disciplines. They 
further suggested the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to 
improve the interactivity of NPCs (Non-Player Character) 
based on player responses. This research is essential for the 
introduction of the first serious online game, which can 
increase educational skills in blockchain technology for 
students and industry professionals. The authors plan to rate 
this serious game on a subjective scale based on the Game 
Experience Survey. In the same context, the authors in [6] 
chose to use the mid-sized college classroom in the United 
States to apply the principles of active learning (a process to 
involve students in the co-creation of the learning experience 
by sharing leadership and course design, students will be 
responsible for their own learning), and gamification leading 
to blockchain education. The used classroom learning 
method was the asynchronous learning method, in which 
concepts were categorically divided into blocks. These 
elementary principles were built on top of each other, which 
led to the synergistic knowledge and definition of blockchain 
for the student. The instructor performed these exercises in 
Introductory Information Technology (IT) courses, as well as 
higher level ethics and professionalism courses, with the aim 
of discerning different levels of knowledge regarding the 
subject of the blockchain. The content of the article 
encourages instructors to use their creative talents to produce 
gamification for blockchain pedagogy. 
B. Improvement of the education system by Blockchain 
technology 
In a world full of transformation that faces the 
acceleration of innovation and new technologies, the formal 
educational 
systems 
can 
quickly 
become 
obsolete. 
Educational systems are increasingly called upon to 
correspond to the realities and needs of societies. To improve 
the higher educational system in Russia, [4] explores the new 
needs of their system in the context of the global digitization 
of society and it analyzes the innovative possibilities of 
merging new social media technologies, blockchain, big 
data, artificial intelligence, with each other. At the end, all 
available knowledge and its supports will be brought 
together in a single system called collective intelligence and 
most importantly the guarantee of intellectual property of the 
latest curricula and educational resources.  Authors consider 
Russian projects for their use in practical activities of 
teachers, on the basis of systems analysis methods, new 
directions in training of specialists have been identified and 
characterized: the development of forms of collective 
creativity the participation in complex projects based on 
blockchain technologies, the involvement of young initiative 
in the framework of crowdsourcing technologies, the 
development of individualized training based on artificial 
intelligence technologies. As the acquisition of qualifications 
became more decoupled from the academy, universities 
would lose the virtual monopoly they currently enjoy on 
degrees and would have to reinvent themselves as graduate 
75

educators in a broader sense, to that the university always 
remains competitive. The article [8] describes the changing 
nature of graduate occupations and examines the possible 
impacts of developments in knowledge-intensive work and 
AI. It examines the analysis of learning and blockchain 
technologies to assess their potential to automate the secure 
recognition of student activities and achievements. It makes 
an original and timely contribution to higher education 
literature by considering how a convergence of three 
technologies (learning analytics, (AI) and blockchain) could 
lead to radical changes. 
To go further than the current mode of application of the 
blockchain which is limited to recording the educational 
experience of students, the author of [9] offers a competition 
mode of application of blockchain technology based on the 
e-commerce sandbox of digital education operation, to help 
teachers to test students' knowledge and their ability to use 
the knowledge. This mode applies blockchain technology to 
effectively simplify the competition process and improve 
competition efficiency. At the same time, the credibility of 
the competition is resolved by the characteristics of system 
transparency and non-disruption of data. To provide 
traceability information for digital education products, the 
authors propose to combine with Trusted Cloud. 
III. DIGITIZING THE HUMAN RESOURCES AREA IN 
INDUSTRY THANKS TO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 
Authenticating credentials can be a real headache for 
corporate recruiters. Fraud with false diplomas and 
approximations during interviews still represent an important 
part of applications today. In an increasingly competitive job 
market, the blockchain is one of the strengths of technology 
that comes from its total transparency particularly in the 
verification of candidate profiles, verification of diplomas, 
experiences, their duration, etc. Table 1 presents the research 
that focused on finding solutions to these problems.  
In the same context, [5] proposed a blockchain-based on 
the recruitment management system (BcRMS) as well as a 
blockchain-based human resources management system 
(BcHRMS) algorithm. It is a fast efficient and transparent 
system using blockchain to reduce the risk to the human 
resources authority. The proposed system thus provides 
authentic and effective decision support information for the 
management of the human resources of an organization. This 
research reveals that the proposed models can be more 
efficient than the existing HRM systems in terms of safety, 
cost, time and quality of work. Thus, the proposed system 
will have significant effects on the construction of smart 
cities as well as smart industries in the era of existing 
industry 4.0 and future industry 5.0. 
For the researches [1][10],  the authors relied on 
analytical methods. In [1], it uses blockchain technology to 
build a global register of certificates of qualification and 
evaluation of skills, to face the central issue of research in 
the field of training and professional integration of highly 
qualified specialties. The register content includes two main 
characteristics which are requested by the employer and 
offered by an individual as a potential employee:  
• Qualifying characteristics are reflected, as a rule, in 
educational documents and in professional standards of an 
industry;  
• Competency parameters are presented in the functional 
description of the vacant positions of the company and in the 
resumes and portfolios of candidates listing the functional 
tasks that have been performed in their previous jobs, 
qualifying characteristics of a person are reflected in a 
variety of certificates.  
For their part, the authors of [10] carry out an in-depth 
analysis of laws, professional regulations and government 
reports, a conceptual model has been developed which 
integrates the description of competences and aptitudes, 
documents and all other forms of confirmation of skills 
acquisition. The application of blockchain technology allows 
all data to be integrated into an autonomous system while 
using existing skills registers. The computer conceptual 
model developed by a qualitative research approach meets 
the requirements of all interested parties: employees, 
employers and organizations issuing such documents. Based 
on the model developed for document representation, as an 
integrator of personal skills, the authors propose an 
Integrated Personal Competence Ledger (IPeCoL) to collect 
and provide access to information certifying the possession 
of specific skills. The proposed model ensures the unification 
of the way in which documents confirming the qualifications 
possessed are represented and can thus form the basis for the 
construction of a system intended to verify their credibility. 
To help the Corporate Training Center to standardize the 
skills then to use them by the human resources department to 
develop the training material, [11] developed a blockchain-
based Human Resources (HR) framework to meet the needs 
of the business and the skills of the workforce. In order to 
obtain information on the skills required by the industry, the 
authors use technological applications: in particular AI and 
blockchain. By integrating the above two technologies, the 
blockchain - IoT application is formulated to meet practical 
skills gap mitigation needs. For proof of concept and 
validation, the authors are developing a prototype system 
using the Ethereum blockchain to meet the needs of industry 
and education as a competent source of skilled labor. The 
proposed system not only enables holistic HR training 
content, but also dynamic workforce skills according to 
business needs. The result of the validation with the 
prototyping blockchain shows that the blockchain is able to 
generate information on the skills required by the industry. 
This information will be used by the Corporate Training 
Center to organize the procedure relating to the competence 
standard of the personnel. Accordingly, this information will 
be used by the training provider to organize the program.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
Blockchain has been considered as an innovative 
technology with a strong potential for transformation [19], it 
is not easy to say whether or not it will revolutionize 
industrial or educational processes, because most of the 
challenges facing companies in this area of process 
management are less technological than organizational and

human. Like any new technology, blockchain is an idea that 
initially disrupts; it is a double-edged sword on one side, a 
tool for individual liberation or emancipation; a means of 
promoting collaboration between different actors, through 
distributed coordination and consensus mechanisms. On the 
other hand, a technology that can be used primarily by 
criminals, eager to evade the rule of law by relying on 
infrastructures that operate beyond the control of any 
sovereign authority. And since this technology is still in the 
research and development stage, most of the studies 
presented in this article are exploratory in nature and seek to 
apply basic principles, identify likely trends, and provide 
education and training programs adequate training for 
mastery. Education and training in blockchain technology 
therefore have a key role to play in understanding its mass 
adoption. 
 Education is undoubtedly one of the first factors that 
will ensure that the technological transformation of the 21st 
century is not missed, given the various future trends in this 
technology represented in the following, [22]: 
- The trend of coding research and development will focus 
more on the ability to process big data fast. 
- Hardware blockchain technology will spread the big data 
market by improving data speed and security. 
- Technologies related to future applications will be 
developed in close collaboration with encryption techniques, 
which are an essential part of artificial intelligence and the 
Internet of Things. 
- Exchange-related technologies will focus on solving 
problems in cryptocurrency transactions. 
- Other sections of digital transaction technologies will focus 
on big data processing. 
 Each technology has limits in its use, concerning the 
blockchain there are limits in terms of privacy, the 
environment, inclusion, its threat to democracy and 
citizenship, [17]. 
 Finally, the most important factor in the promotion of 
blockchain technology and their legalization is the 
commitment of the state in the formation of digital societies.
