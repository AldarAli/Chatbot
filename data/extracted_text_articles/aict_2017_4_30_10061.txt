Abstract— The use of social networking sites and social media 
tools is on the rise, as the most common activity of today's youth. 
Thus, leveraging social media concepts in learning can make 
education more relatable to the youth in this digital era.  This 
paper identifies key current social media concepts, such as user 
profiles, activity streams, and status updates, among others, and 
analyses how they support pedagogical learning approaches, 
with the progressive inquiry-based model used as an example. 
The preliminary study serves as an introduction to a series of 
future research and empirical studies on the integration of key 
existing social media concepts and the development of novel 
ones in a hybrid educational environment, called Science, 
Technology, Innovation, Mathematics, Engineering for the 
Young (STIMEY). The STIMEY environment will combine 
social media components, robotic artefacts, and radio, and 
connect students, educators, parents and organisations, based 
on a pedagogical framework researched and developed to 
increase the European youth’s interest and engagement in 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) 
education and careers.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In a world that is becoming more technology-oriented, it 
is getting difficult to engage and maintain the interest of young 
learners in formal settings. Contemporary educational systems 
fail to successfully awaken the desire for active and 
responsible learning. Learners’ levels of engagement during 
their years of schooling are low and many students report 
feeling bored or even hating school [1]. On the other hand, the 
popularity of social media continues to rise each year, 
currently with over 2.3 billion active social media user 
accounts globally, at a   penetration   rate   of   31%   of   total   
global population [2]. Thus, leveraging social media concepts 
can be key in attracting the students’ interest for Science, 
Technology, 
Engineering, 
and 
Mathematics 
(STEM) 
education and careers, and making it more relatable to them 
from a young age. This paper presents a preliminary concept 
of integrating social media concepts in the pedagogical 
framework for a hybrid educational environment with multi-
level components, called Science, Technology, Innovation, 
Mathematics, Engineering for the Young (STIMEY) [3]. The 
STIMEY project is funded by Horizon 2020 H2020-SEAC-
2015-1 program, ongoing between September 2016 and 
August 2019, with partners in Germany, Spain, Finland, 
Greece, and Belarus. It aims to make STEM education and 
careers more attractive for 10- to 18-year-old students in 
Europe, with a hybrid learning environment that combines 
social media components in its Web platform, robotic 
artefacts, and radio broadcasting. The socially motivational 
environment for emotional and educational engagement is 
being designed and developed based on a pedagogical 
framework to educate, engage and increase the youth’s 
interest in STEM [4]. 
The STIMEY environment will also provide the necessary 
modern tools for teachers, parents and organizations to take 
part in the students’ progress and development, such as social 
media tools, gamification, collaborative and creative tools, 
entrepreneurial tools, serious games, and tools for challenges, 
activities and competitions. Thus, universities, schools, 
teachers, students, parents, business and media partners come 
together to complete a circle in which STEM becomes a part 
of the daily life of youth in an educational environment that 
also prepares them for future careers [4]. 
A. Research Objectives 
The overall objective of the STIMEY project is to 
contribute to the increase in competitiveness of the European 
Union economy, with results that will enable young people, 
ages 10 to 18, to become highly competent in STEM topics 
and be motivated to pursue STEM careers [4].  
The specific objectives, stemming from the general goal, 
in relation to social media components, are to:  
 
create a pedagogical framework that exploits the full 
potentials of social media for STEM topics in formal 
and informal contexts; 
 
create 
a 
Web 
platform 
for 
multimodal 
communication, social media concepts and tools, and 
professional identity development. The e-profile and 
social media tools of the STIMEY Web platform will 
support students’ needs to communicate, share and 
interact with peers, STEM event organizers, academic 
members, professionals, companies, etc.  
 
create electronic portfolio presentation tools to 
support students in promoting their STEM activities 
and achievements – participation in relative activities 
in formal (e.g., schools) and non-formal (e.g., science 
centre activities, competitions, etc.) education, STEM 
project completion, competition awards, etc. – with

multimedia and social media tools that also enable 
them to receive feedback from the STIMEY 
members.  
The STIMEY project addresses the specific challenges in 
achieving the objectives by creating a shift from traditional 
towards innovative and effective methods [5] to increase the 
attractiveness of STEM education and careers, and boost the 
interest of young people in STEM.  
Based on extensive research, testing and European-wide 
collaboration, the STIMEY project is then developing a set 
of novel pedagogical approaches grasping a holistic vision of 
existing challenges to offer an educational multi-channel 
solution that integrates social media, robotic artefacts, radio 
broadcasting, entrepreneurial tools and serious gaming, into 
a complex learning environment [4]. 
In Section 2, a literature review on the use of social media 
in learning and education serves as a starting point when 
researching and developing a technology-enhanced learning 
environment for raising European youth’s interest and 
attraction towards STEM studies and careers. An overview of 
the research and development of the pedagogical framework 
follows in Section 3. In Section 4, key social media concepts 
are identified and their role as learning tools is discussed in 
detail. The risks of social media use and strategies to mitigate 
them are briefly introduced in Section 5, while Section 6 
presents a conclusion of the research with an outlook on 
future research within the project. 
II. 
SOCIAL MEDIA USE IN LEARNING AND EDUCATION 
Social 
media 
concepts 
are 
forms 
of 
electronic 
communication, such as Web sites for social networking and 
microblogging, 
through 
which 
users 
create 
online 
communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, 
and other content (as videos). That is only one of the various 
definitions of social media across different disciplines and 
points of views [6]. While many may think of social media 
exclusively as social networks like Facebook [7], its landscape 
is far more inclusive of basic forms, such as microblogging 
(e.g., Twitter [8] and Snapchat [9]), blogs (e.g., Tumblr [10] 
and Wordpress [11]), wikis (e.g., Wikipedia [12]), podcasts 
(e.g., Apple iTunes [13]) and content communities (e.g., 
Instagram [14] and Youtube [15]). And those are only some 
of the current modern forms of social media. As it is 
seemingly difficult to pinpoint a single definition of social 
media, it is better to understand it as a group of new kinds of 
online media, which share most or all of the following 
characteristics [16]: 
 
Participation: social media encourages contributions 
and feedback from everyone who is interested. It blurs 
the line between media and audience. 
 
Openness: most social media services are open to 
feedback and participation. They encourage voting, 
comments and the sharing of information. There are 
rarely any barriers to accessing and making use of 
content – password-protected content is frowned on. 
 
Conversation: whereas traditional media is about 
“broadcast” (content transmitted or distributed to an 
audience), social media is better seen as a two-way 
conversation. 
 
Community: social media allows communities to 
form 
quickly 
and 
communicate 
effectively. 
Communities share common interests, such as a love 
of travel, an environmental issue or a favorite artist. 
 
Connectedness: Most kinds of social media thrive on 
their connectedness, making use of links to other sites, 
resources and people.  
Teenagers are among the most prolific users of social 
networks and social media tools. While they primarily use 
them to communicate with friends, they also use them and 
other interactional technologies to gather information and aid 
in decision-making. These advances are expanding the world 
of today's youth in ways that have yet to be fully understood 
[17]. Additionally, studies show that young people learn 
differently with social media and online technology tools, and 
as a result, the need for more flexible education and online 
interaction has become critical [18].  
Given its increasing popularity and significance, various 
literature has researched the use of social media in different 
disciplines, 
such 
as 
business, 
marketing, 
software 
engineering, collaboration, etc. Special focus has also been 
given to researching the use of social media in education, as it 
is increasingly being leveraged as a learning and teaching tool. 
Yet, there is not much research and literature published on the 
intellectual and social practices that the youth demonstrate—
either in top social networks, such as Facebook—or in niche 
social network sites, social gaming, or mobile networking 
applications designed for educational purposes. Preliminary 
research results indicate that [19]: 
 
96% of students with Internet access report using 
social networking technologies  
 
75% of students in 7th through 12th grades have at 
least one social media profile  
 
59% of students who use social networking talk about 
education topics online  
 
50% of students who talk about education topics 
online, talk specifically about schoolwork  
 
59% of schools say their students use social 
networking for educational purposes 
 
27% of schools have an online community for 
teachers and administrators 
Other studies have found that some school tutors have 
embraced smartphones and social media as mobile learning 
devices [20]. While critics say that social media discourages 
communication, supporters feel that it can enhance learner 
interactions, particularly for those learners who are too shy to 
fully participate in class [21].  
Nonetheless, only few studies examine the influence of 
social media features and their attendant social practices on 
learners. 
Although 
educational 
research 
devoted 
to 
understanding young people’s purposes for using social media 
is increasing, research on the features they find most 
engaging, the socio-technical practices they employ, and ways 
to define and assess learning and communication using social 
68

media, is still lacking. Thus, so far, educators, researchers, and 
designers remain unclear about whether social media can 
support or inhibit learning, how and under what conditions 
[22]. The STIMEY project thus aims to clear that out, by 
researching how key social media concepts can be integrated 
in an e-learning environment based on pedagogical 
framework to support learning. The following section 
examines in detail how a pedagogical model can be adopted 
then integrated with social media concepts and tools.  
III. 
PEDAGOGICAL FRAMEWORK RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
In the development of a pedagogical framework for the 
STIMEY environment, various pedagogical models, such as 
project-based, problem-based, inquiry-based, exploratory, 
experiential, and expansive learning are analyzed in the 
context 
of 
technology-enhanced 
STEM 
learning 
environments. However, in the initial phase of the project, 
and for this research paper, the progressive inquiry model 
[23] is used as an example to demonstrate how social media 
concepts can be integrated to support its elements [24] in a 
general learning environment: 
 
Creating the context: A study project is connected to 
its context (e.g., real-world problem to be solved) and 
its meaningfulness to learners is made clear. 
 
Setting up research questions: Learners formulate 
questions which arise from their own attempts to 
understand and explain the problem. 
 
Constructing working theories: Learners formulate 
hypotheses and initial intuitive conceptions based on 
their background knowledge. 
 
Critical evaluation: Learners evaluate strengths and 
weaknesses of their working theories. 
 
Searching deepening knowledge: More information is 
searched so as to examine better the working theories 
in the light of new information. 
 
Generating subordinate questions: New, more 
specific questions are formulated so as to 
progressively deepen the inquiry. 
 
Constructing new working theories: More articulated 
working theories are formulated and displayed based 
on progressive inquiry. 
 
Shared expertise: All aspects of inquiry can be shared 
with other learners. Through social interaction, 
contradictions, inconsistencies and limitations can be 
made evident. Further, instructors play an important 
role in guiding and scaffolding learners’ process of 
inquiry. 
Understanding and developing pedagogic theories and 
approaches under the pedagogical framework allows for better 
reflection on learning, and its implications for the design of a 
social media-powered learning environment. Thus, for this 
paper, a mix of learning approaches is developed and adopted, 
as seen in Figure 1, and then further explored, as an example 
of how it can be supported with social media concepts. The 
learning approach covers the set of theories and underlying 
Figure 1. Learning Approach Model Development

models adopted for this research, while the learning tasks 
relate to the different components of learning activities [25]. 
Based on this model and the STIMEY project objectives, the 
learning tasks’ components are divided as follows: 
 
Types: assimilative, information handling, adaptive, 
communicative, productive, and experiential. 
 
Technique: 
brainstorming 
[26], 
presentation, 
structured debate, and unstructured discussion. 
 
Roles: learner, tutor, facilitator or mentor (referring 
also to parents, organization members, etc., in the 
STIMEY environment), and group leader or member.  
 
Interaction: individual, 1 to 1 learner to learner, 1 to 
1 learner to tutor (and vice versa), 1 to 1 learner to 
facilitator (and vice versa), 1 to 1 tutor to facilitator 
(and vice versa), individual to many and many to 
many (as in groups and discussions), etc. 
 
Tools: can be interactive, adaptive, communicative, 
productive or narrative. These include social media 
concepts suggested in the next section based on how 
they can support and enable this learning model. 
In the following section, key social media concepts are 
proposed as the tools (see Figure. 1) to enhance and facilitate 
learning, based on their significance in supporting the 
progressive inquiry model as an example. As the pedagogical 
framework research continues, with detailed literature review, 
focus groups and testing, STIMEY will develop a learning 
approach specifically suitable for a STEM learning 
environment, which will form the basis of the social media 
concepts integration in the final stages. 
IV. 
IDENTIFYING KEY SOCIAL MEDIA CONCEPTS AND 
THEIR ROLE AS LEARNING TOOLS 
As the STIMEY project aims to investigate the use of 
social media in supporting learning activities, the research is 
initiated by evaluating key contemporary social media 
concepts and how they can support a pedagogical learning 
model. These concepts are intuitively derived from common 
features in popular social networking sites, such as Facebook 
[7] and Google Plus [27], and e-learning platforms, such as 
Khan Academy [28], Digischool [29] and Edmodo [30]. 
A. User Profile 
A user profile is the visual display of personal data 
associated with a specific user in a platform. The profile 
refers, therefore, to the explicit digital representation of a 
user’s identity [31]. This feature allows users to add personal 
information, and showcase their knowledge and skills, while 
also controlling the visibility and privacy of the profile. This 
form of self-presentation satisfies several human needs, as a 
study by MySpace has shown [32]. The profile is also the 
cornerstone of a user’s activity on STIMEY, containing a 
timeline of their activities and progress, connections, status 
updates, and other content as explained in detail hereafter. The 
user profile’s role in teaching and learning, as shown in Figure 
1, is, therefore, indirect but elementary in enabling the rest of 
the concepts and supporting activities. User profiles can also 
help, for example, to identify learners’ interests so as to 
choose study projects which are personally meaningful for 
them (creating the context) and to group learners based on 
their expertise areas (shared expertise). 
B. Status Updates 
A status update is a feature that allows users to discuss 
their thoughts, opinions, or important information with their 
connections. Similar to a Tweet on Twitter, or a status on 
Facebook, a status is usually short and generally gives 
information without going into too much detail as a blog post, 
but may also contain other types of media, such as image or 
link. When the status is updated, it posts on the user's profile, 
as well as in the activity stream of their connections [33]. This 
feature enables the most basic form of communication, yet 
most crucial, in support of various phases of inquiry-based 
learning, see Figure 1. For example, through status updates, 
users can post information about the context they are working 
on or share their research questions or working theories, as 
well as generate context based on other users’ posts and 
updates, contributing to shared expertise. It also supports 
various learning tasks’ types, such as reading and viewing 
(other users’ statuses), writing (text updates), creating and 
presenting (media status updates), and discussing (through 
Social Feedback, seen next). Moreover, it enables the 
techniques of brainstorming, presenting and unstructured 
discussions. 
C. Social Feedback 
In a social media environment, it is critical for users to 
have the ability to add their opinions about the quality or 
relevance of the content. Common examples are “like/not 
like,” “thumbs up/thumbs down,” star ratings, social 
commentary, tagging, flagging and reporting. Feedback has 
long been utilized as an effective tool to enhance learning, and 
social media concepts serve as a platform for effective 
feedback communication to improve relationships and 
performance in a learning environment [34]. Social feedback 
is most significant in supporting the co-creating of working 
theories and in critical evaluation, but overall plays an 
important role throughout sharing the expertise in inquiry-
based learning, in Figure 1, especially in enabling discussing 
(through comments and replies), reading and viewing (of 
other users’ comments and replies), and writing and 
presenting (of comments and replies, with media). 
D. Social Connecting 
The essence of social media, as well as the STIMEY 
project, is being used by people to build social networks or 
social relations with others who share similar personal or 
career 
interests, 
activities, 
backgrounds 
or 
real-life 
connections [35]. Thus, functions, such as “invite friend”, 
“add friend”, “follow account”, etc., are at the cornerstone of 
social 
media 
concepts, 
to 
enable 
communication, 
collaboration and knowledge sharing among members. Young 
people particularly value social and interactive opportunities 
for learning [36]. This concept, therefore, drives multiple 
pedagogical frames that depend on the interactions of various 
roles (learners, tutors and facilitators/mentors), such as 
70
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2017.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-562-3
AICT 2017 : The Thirteenth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications

brainstorming, critical evaluation (by exchanging feedback), 
and sharing expertise. 
E. Activity Stream 
With the development of social media, the activity stream 
has become a common way to present a list of recent activities 
and aggregated information to users. Essentially, it is a digital 
interface component that lists activities or events relevant to a 
person, group, topic or everything in the environment in which 
it is built [37]. Thus, it is a central component in a social 
learning environment where users can keep track of their 
connections’ and communities’ updates (whether in benefit of 
generating context or critical evaluation), platform’s news and 
updates, and any other elements’ updates they subscribe to. In 
relation to inquiry-based learning (see Figure 1), the activity 
stream sets the stage for most steps, especially in generating 
context from activity updates, and receiving/providing 
feedback on those updates for critical evaluation. 
F. Social Messaging 
Instant messaging (IM) is not a new concept, or one that is 
specific to social media, yet it has become an essential 
integrated part of the experience. It refers to the exchange of 
text messages through a software application in real-time [38]. 
Popular features of social messaging applications include text 
chat, group chat, message notifications, status updates, media 
(file) sharing, and most prominently, the usage of stickers or 
little rich images to depict mood and convey messages in non-
verbal format [39]. This concept enables deeper discussions, 
collaboration, brainstorming and sharing expertise in inquiry-
based learning. It is also most essential in enabling the 
interactions between the various roles, whether through one to 
one (bilateral chat) or many to many (group chat) 
communication 
G. Community 
Online communities are generally regarded as online 
'spaces' which individuals 'feel part of' and where they can go 
to interact on a common topic or interest [40]. They allow 
users to create, post, comment to and read from their own 
interest- and niche-specific forums. What makes communities 
so appealing is the ability to control access to them, to find 
and connect with only “like-minded” people or people who 
share a common purpose. Thus, such communities have 
“moderators” or admins, who create them, set their privacy 
settings (public or private), and grant special permissions to 
others (to join, to comment, to post, to invite, to approve 
invitations, to moderate, etc.). These communities are 
essential in promoting a sense of community among learners, 
and access to them is even more important than the physical 
education 
environment 
[36]. 
Communities 
enable 
assimilative, communicative and productive learning tasks’ 
types, all of the learning tasks’ techniques, and sharing 
expertise among members (through contribution to setting up 
research questions, critical evaluation, and generating 
subordinate questions), all relevant to inquiry-based learning. 
H. Discussion Forum 
Discussion forums exist in a variety of distance learning 
platforms, such as e-learning platforms (Moodle [41], 
Blackboard [42], e-tutor [43], etc.) or mobile platforms 
(WhatsApp [44], etc.). These forums provide online learners 
opportunities to collaborate and cooperate to construct 
knowledge [45]. Therefore, they are not specifically a social 
media concept, but they are a basic form of digital socializing 
that is essential in a learning environment. The main 
difference between discussion forums and communities is 
that in a forum, all users are at equal level, requiring no 
special permissions or access to post and discuss with others. 
Any user is allowed to start a topic and to respond to one. 
Content is usually segmented by topic, rather than by people 
[46]. Other discussion-related concepts, such as Q&A, can 
also be helpful and employed to facilitate more direct 
question posing, searching and answering, with users given 
also the ability to “vote” for and feature the correct answer 
(relevant to “critical evaluation”) to enable better and more 
reliable expertise sharing around a specific topic (for e.g., 
courses). As in communities, discussion forums enable 
assimilative, communicative and productive learning tasks’ 
types, all of the learning tasks’ techniques, and sharing 
expertise among members. 
V. 
RISKS OF SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND MITIGATION 
STRATEGIES 
Although social media presents many benefits and 
opportunities, as demonstrated earlier, it can also pose some 
risks and challenges, especially when children and 
adolescents are involved. The main risk they face online 
today are risks from each other, risks of improper use of 
technology, lack of privacy, sharing too much information, or 
posting false information about themselves or others [47]. 
These risks must be recognized, addressed and mitigated 
whenever possible through social media principles and 
guidelines. Apart from developing and enforcing guidelines 
and policies to mitigate these risks, educating and 
encouraging users to engage in risk mitigation activities is 
considered good practice. By providing users with functions, 
such as privacy settings, controlling user permissions (adding 
or blocking users), flagging and reporting abusive or illegal 
content and users (as part of the social media concepts’ 
features presented earlier), they gain better control over their 
own security and privacy. Thus, raising awareness among 
users about these risks, and empowering them to take more 
control over their privacy and security, are among the top 
mitigation strategies that will be researched and employed in 
STIMEY. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
While the use of social media in learning and education is 
still open and in need of much research, early indications 
show very promising results. With most European youth 
using social media increasingly in many aspects of their lives, 
it is critical to research its uses and benefits. In the context of 
71

education, social media must be based on strong fundaments 
to leverage its benefits as a learning tool. Thus, it is essential 
that the social media concepts designed and employed in an 
e-learning environment are based on and emerge from a well-
developed pedagogical framework. As demonstrated in this 
paper, social media concepts can be investigated to be used 
as tools that can support the various learning tasks in learning 
approaches, such as the progressive inquiry model. Key 
social media concepts, such as user profiles, activity streams, 
and communities, can enable and facilitate learning through 
discussions, collaborations, sharing expertise, and other 
learning fundaments. 
As the project evolves, with more concrete research 
results on the pedagogical framework, end-user involvement, 
the STIMEY platform’s requirements engineering, and a 
structured analysis of e-learning and blended learning 
environments, additional social media concepts will arise and 
be further investigated, and quantified experiment results will 
be conducted for verification. Moreover, research will be 
carried out on the technical integration of the social media 
concepts as learning tools within the STIMEY environment’s 
multiple technological components.
