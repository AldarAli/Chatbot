Abstract—The problem of resource allocation for the uplink
of wireless SISO-OFDMA systems is investigated. To relieve
heavy computational burden, a suboptimal, but efﬁcient scheme
is devised which maximizes the sum of the users’ data rates
subject to constraints on the per user transmitted power and
minimum data rate requirements among users. Simulation results
indicate that the proposed scheme can satisfy minimum data rate
constraints, distributing sum data rate fairly and ﬂexibly among
users. In addition, the proposed scheme is complexity effective,
and can be applied to latest-generation wireless systems that
provide Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees.
Index Terms—OFDMA, resource allocation, multiuser diver-
sity.
I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
[1] has developed into a popular scheme for wideband wire-
less digital communication. In OFDMA, multiple access is
achieved by ﬁrst dividing the spectrum of interest into a
number of subcarriers and then assigning subsets of the sub-
carriers to individual users. OFDMA helps exploit multiuser
diversity in frequency-selective channels, since it is very likely
that some subcarriers that are “bad” for a user are “good”
for at least one of the other users. Because of its superior
performance in frequency-selective fading wireless channels,
OFDMA is the modulation and multiple access scheme used
in latest wireless systems such as IEEE 802.16e (Mobile
WiMAX).
There are ﬁxed and adaptive allocations to allocate sub-
carriers. Fixed allocations use Time Division Multiple Access
(TDMA) or Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) as
multiple access schemes to allocate each user a predetermined
time slot or frequency band for transmission. While applying
ﬁxed allocation the system neglects the channel diversity and
does not use the deep faded subcarriers for other users which
do not seem as deep faded to them. In [2], these two ﬁxed
allocation schemes are discussed and compared in much detail.
On the other hand, adaptive allocations allocate resources to
users based on their channel gains. Due to the time-varying
nature of the wireless channel, dynamic resource allocation
makes full use of the multiuser diversity to achieve higher
performance.
Most work on resource allocation has been done for the
downlink OFDMA systems. In [3] [4], total transmit power is
minimized. In [5] [6], it is proved that the downlink system
capacity is maximized when each subcarrier is exclusively
assigned to the user with the best subcarrier gain, eliminating
the intra-cell interference (ICI), and power is then distributed
by the water-ﬁlling algorithm [7]. In [8], the minimum data
rate among users is maximized and in [9]-[12], a proportional
fairness criterion is employed. In [13] [14], the fulﬁllment
of every user’s data rate constraints is guaranteed and in
[15], per time-slot resource allocation is introduced with “self-
noise” and phase noise. In [16], long term access proportional
fairness is introduced. Finally, in [17], the sum of the users’
data rates is maximized but the resource allocation unit is
not the subcarrier, as in previous algorithms [3]-[16], but
a time/frequency unit (slot), in accordance with WiMAX
systems.
Recently, uplink resource allocation has received some
attention in literature. A practical low-complexity algorithm
for a two-user case is proposed in [18]. In [19], the optimality
of OFDMA in uplink transmissions has been studied while
in [20], a non-iterative and near-optimal joint subcarrier and
power allocation scheme is proposed. In [21], the results of
[20] are generalized by considering the utility maximization
in one time-slot, where the utility is a function of the in-
stantaneous data rate in this time-slot. Another work that
focused on per time-slot fairness is [22]. In [23], the uplink
resource allocation problem is approached using a gradient
scheduler but considers long-term total utility maximization
which depends on the average data rate or queue sizes. Finally,
in [24], resource allocation algorithms are proposed to ﬁnd a
Nash Bargaining solution according to Game theory.
In this paper, the resource allocation problem in uplink
OFDMA systems is investigated. We focus on single antenna
systems where at most one user can be assigned per subcarrier.
The objective is to maximize the sum of the users’ data
rates subject to constraints on per user power and minimum
data rates among users. The proposed scheme, which is also
complexity effective, consists of three algorithms; an algorithm
that determines the number of subcarriers for each user, a
subcarrier allocation algorithm by dividing the users in two
groups and the water-ﬁlling algorithm [7]. The ﬁrst two
algorithms assign the available subcarriers to the users of the
system and the third one allocates the available power of each
user.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The
problem of sum data rate maximization using minimum data
rate constraints and power constraint for each user is formu-

lated in Section II. The proposed scheme is introduced in
Section III and Section IV contains the complexity analysis
of the proposed scheme and a complexity comparison with
other schemes. Simulation results and a comparison between
the proposed scheme and other existing schemes are provided
in Section V. Finally, Section VI contains concluding remarks.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION
The following assumptions are used in this paper: (i) the
time-varying channels between different users and the Base
Station (BS) are assumed to be frequency selective wireless
channels with independent Rayleigh fading and the channel
can be regarded as constant during the resource allocation
period; (ii) the ISI is completely removed by exploititng
OFDM techniques, i.e. the width of each subcarrier is much
smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. Thus,
each user experiences ﬂat fading in each subcarrier; (iii) the
Channel State Information (CSI) is perfectly known by the
receiver, and the BS feedbacks a certain form of channel
information correctly to each user; (iv) each subcarrier can
be used by only one user at each time.
The BS decides uplink resource transmission parameters for
all available users based on the feedback CSI. The resource
allocation parameters are then sent to each user though a
dedicated control channel. Then, each user loads its data into
the allocated subcarriers and the BS decodes the data sent from
all users. The resource allocation scheme is updated as soon
as the channel information is collected and also the resource
allocation information is sent to BS for detecting.
Consider an OFDMA uplink transmission in a single cell
with K active users and N subcarriers. Pk is the transmit
power of each user k = 1, 2, . . . , K and the channel gain for
user k in subcarrier n is denoted by gk,n. Each subcarrier n of
user k is assigned a power pk,n. With the noise power spectral
density being N0 and the total bandwidth of all subcarriers be-
ing B, the additive white noise power is σ2 = N0B
N . Therefore,
the subcarrier SNR can be expressed as hk,n =
g2
k,n
σ2
and the
transmitted SNR of user k in subcarrier n is γk,n = pk,nhk,n.
Each of the user’s bits are modulated into N M-level QAM
symbols, which are subsequently combined using the IFFT
into an OFDMA symbol. For a square M-level QAM using
Gray bit mapping as a function of transmitted SNR γk,n and
number of bits of user k in subcarrier n rk,n, the BER can be
approximated to within 1 dB for rk,n ≥ 4 and BER ≤ 10−3
as [25]
BERMQAM(γk,n) ≈ 1
5 exp
−1.6γk,n
2rk,n − 1

(1)
By solving (1), rk,n is
rk,n = log2(1 + γk,n
Γ ) = log2(1 + pk,nHk,n)
(2)
where Γ =-ln(5BER)/1.6 and Hk,n =
hk,n
Γ
is the effective
subcarrier SNR of user k in subcarrier n.
Taking into account the conclusions above, the optimization
problem is formulated as:

(8)
where ck,n is the subcarrier allocation indicator such that
ck,n = 1 if subcarrier n is assigned to user k and ck,n = 0
if not. Constraints (4) and (5) ensure the correct values for
the subcarrier allocation indicator and the power, respectively.
Constraint (6) restricts the assignment of each subcarrier to
only one user and (7) is the individual power constraint.
Finally, (8) is the minimum data rate constraint. The total data
rate for user k, denoted as Rk, is deﬁned as
Rk = B
N
N
X
n=1
ck,nrk,n
(9)
where rk,n is given by (2) and mrk in (8) is the minimum
data rate of each user.
Note that problem (3) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimiza-
tion problem [26] with non-linear constraints. In a system with
K users and N subcarriers, there are KN possible subcarrier
assignments, since it is assumed that no subcarrier can be used
by more than one user. For a certain subcarrier assignment,
a per user power distribution can be used to maximize the
sum of the users’ data rates, while guaranteeing minimum
data rate constraints. The maximum sum data rate over all
KN subcarrier assignment schemes is the global maximum
and the corresponding subcarrier assignment and per user
power distribution is the optimal resource allocation scheme.
However, it is difﬁcult to obtain an optimal solution within any
reasonable time frame. As a result, a novel and cost-effective
resource allocation scheme is formulated to solve this problem.
III. THE PROPOSED RESOURCE ALLOCATION SCHEME
Ideally, power of each user and subcarriers should be
allocated jointly to solve optimization problem (3) optimally.
This process has a prohibitive computational complexity. In
the following, a suboptimal resource allocation scheme is
proposed which consists of three algorithms and assures a low
complexity performance:

A. Number of subcarriers of each user.
In this algorithm, the number of subcarriers Nk, to be
initially assigned to each user, is determined. This process
is based on the average effective subcarrier SNR of each user
which is calculated by

C. Power allocation.
In subcarrier assignment to available users algorithm avail-
able power is distributed uniformly among subcarriers. In
order to further enhance the sum of the users’ data rates,
in power allocation algorithm, the subcarrier allocation is
kept, but the available power Pk of each user is assigned to
subcarriers of each user using the water-ﬁlling [7] algorithm:
pk,n =

pk,n = Pk, ∀k = 1, 2, . . . , K.
IV. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
In this section, the computational complexity of the pro-
posed resource allocation scheme is analyzed and compared
with that of [5], [20]-[22]. Recall that K refers to the total
number of users in the system and N refers to the number of
subcarriers, which is much larger than K. As mentioned in
Section II, for the exhaustive search algorithm, there are KN
possible subcarrier assignments which require O(KN) time.
Initialization step of the ﬁrst algorithm of the proposed
scheme requires K multiplications to set the initial number of
subcarriers Nk, and also average effective subcarrier SNR is
calculated K times. Thus, the complexity of this initialization
step is O(K). In second step of the same algorithm, Rk is
calculated K times which is O(K). In third step, the user
with the minimum Rk − mrk among K users is found and
Rk is calculated for k = 1, 2, . . . , K. This is repeated until
Nal = N. Thus, this step requires O(K(N −Nal)) complexity
which is also the overal complexity of the ﬁrst algorithm of
the proposed resource allocation scheme.
In initialization step of the second algorithm of the proposed
resource allocation scheme, K users are sorted by average
effective subcarrier SNR which has O(Klog2K) complexity.
Then the complexity of the division of K users in two groups
is O(K). Thus, the complexity of this initialization step is
O(Klog2K). In the second step, for each user of one group,
the best subcarrier is found which has complexity O(KN)
because in our simulations the two groups contain equal
number of users, i.e., m = K
2 . In step three of this algorithm,
subcarriers are allocated to users of one group until each user
gets his allotment of Nk subcarriers. In worst case scenario,
the complexity of this step is O(KN). In step four, the same
procedure takes place but for the other group of users. Thus,
because K << N and log2K << N the complexity of the
second algorithm of the proposed resource allocation scheme
is O(KN).
Finally, in the third algorithm of the proposed resource
allocation scheme, after subcarrier allocation is found, the
water-ﬁlling power allocation algorithm is implemented which
requires to ﬁnd λk. The update of λk can be done by using a
simple bisection method until the power of each user converges
[27]. Thus, in order to perform water-ﬁlling power allocation
for each user the overall time complexity is O(KN). Con-
sequently the complexity of the proposed resource allocation
scheme is O(K(N − Nal) + KN + KN) ≈ O(KN).
In the resource allocation algorithm proposed in [5], each
subcarrier is allocated to the user with the maximum effective
subcarrier SNR. Then, after the subcarrier allocation, either
water-ﬁlling [7] or equal power allocation is applied for each
user. Thus, the complexity of [5] is O(KN). Algorithm in
[5] is optimal in the downlink scenario but not in the uplink
because in the latter there are individual power contsraints.
In algorithms proposed in [20] [21], N iterations are re-
quired to allocate N subcarriers to available users. In each
iteration, water-ﬁlling [7] is performed for each user with time
complexity O(N). This means that the time complexity of
one iteration is O(KN) and for all iterations is O(KN 2).
In [21], a fast implementation method is introduced which is
based on binary tree data structure and has O(KNlog2N) time
complexity but it requires greater storage memory in order to
store all the required information in each node of the binary
tree.
The algorithm proposed in [22] consists of the step of initial
subcarrier allocation and the step of residual subcarrier allo-
cation. For both steps the complexity is O(KN) as described
extensively in [22].
It is easily observed that the proposed resource allocation
scheme has a very dramatic reduction in complexity compared
to O(KN) required by the exhaustive search. In addition it
has similar complexity to [5] [22] and smaller than [20] [21],
without using the binary search tree introduced in [21].
V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, the performance of the proposed uplink
resource allocation scheme is evaluated using simulation. In all
simulations presented in this section, the frequency-selective
channel consists of six independent Rayleigh multipath com-
ponents (taps). As in [9], an exponentially decaying power
delay proﬁle is assumed, the ratio of the energy of the lth
tap to the ﬁrst tap being equal to e−2l. For each channel
realization the proposed scheme is used to perform resource
allocation, and the data rates for each user are computed. A
maximum delay spread of 5 µs and maximum doppler of 30
Hz is assumed. The channel information is sampled every
0.5 ms to update the resource allocation. As in [9], the total
available bandwidth is equal to B = 1 MHz, the number of
subcarriers of an OFDM symbol is N = 64, variance of the
additive noise is equal to N0 = −80 dB·W/Hz (single-sided
PSD), and BER = 10−7. Minimum data rate constraints are
mrk = 1 bit/s/Hz for k = 1, 2, . . . , K, the number of channel
realizations is equal to 105 and parameter m = K
2 .
The proposed resource allocation scheme is compared with
the algorithms proposed in [5] (Jang et al.), [20] (Kim et al.),
[21] (Ng et al.), [22] (Gao et al.), and a static TDMA scheme.

of users is K = 8 and SNR varies from 5 - 40 in increment
of 5.
Figs. 1, 2 depict the comparison of the sum of the users’
data rates versus number of users and SNR, respectively.
It can be seen, the reasonable price being paid in order to
guarantee minimum data rates by using the proposed scheme.
In Fig. 1, as the number of users increases, the difference
in sum data rates also increases because additional multiuser
diversity is available to [20] [21] that only target sum data
rate maximization. On the other hand, more users put more
constraints to the proposed scheme, because new users need
to share the same resources. In addition, sum data rate of the
proposed scheme is signiﬁcantly enhanced over both [5] and
static TDMA algorithm as can be seen in Figs. 1, 2.
Figs. 3, 4 depict the comparison of outage probability versus
number of users and SNR, respectively. The outage probability
of the proposed resource allocation scheme is signiﬁcantly
smaller than any of the other comparing algorithms. This point
is very critical in real systems where users should satisfy the
minimum data rate criterion.

where F is a real number in the interval (0, 1] with the
maximum value of 1 for the case when equal data rates are
achieved among users. As can be seen in Figs. 5, 6, users’ data
rates are almost equal when the proposed resource allocation
scheme and static TDMA algorithm are employed with the
proposed scheme being more fair. Algorithm in [5] guarantees
the least fairness between the users’ data rates. Algorithms in
[20] [21] guarantee almost the same fairness but it is much
lower than that of the proposed scheme and algorithm in [22]
guarantees improved fairness than [5] [20] [21] but noticeably
less than the proposed scheme. In addition, it can be seen in
Fig. 5 that as the number of users increases the fairness pointer
increases in all algorithms except the proposed scheme and
static TDMA where fairness pointer remains almost constant
regardless of the increasing number of users.

VI. CONCLUSION
A resource allocation scheme for the uplink of SISO-
OFDMA wireless systems was introduced which maximizes
sum data rate of the system’s users while guaranteeing min-
imum data rates mrk among users. It is also complexity
efﬁcient and consists of three algorithms; The ﬁrst algorithm
determines the number of subcarriers to be initially assigned
to each user, the second algorithm assigns the subcarriers to
each user, and the third one allocates the available power Pk of
each user to subcarriers, using the water-ﬁlling equation [7].
In addition, its innovative priority scheduling exploits more
efﬁciently the multiuser diversity and makes it perform better
than previous schemes. Finally, sum of the users’ data rates is
distributed more fairly among users.
