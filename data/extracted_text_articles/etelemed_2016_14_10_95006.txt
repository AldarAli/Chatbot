Abstract— This paper discusses a methodological approach for
the metrological characterization of features in conductive
textile. One of the outcomes of this paper is an integrated
testing protocol aiming to assess the mechanical and electrical
specification of conductive fabric. The protocol has been
developed
focusing
on
smart
garments;
this
allows
for
evaluating the conductive features over elasticity, moisture,
temperature and washing. The fine characterization of the
fabrics allows to use them both as electrodes, sensors or wired
connections. In particular, the paper studies the metrological
aspects of conductive textile in order to optimize and verify
their usage in sensorized t-shirt (as ECG- Electro-CardioGram
electrodes, strain gauge, etc.) for continuous non-invasive
monitoring in hospital settings, activity of daily living (ADL),
sports
and
fitness.
This
study
looks
at
optimizing
the
conductivity of the yarn that follows in minimizing the
movement
artifacts;
this
could
increase
the
general
performances and reliability of smart garments.

INTRODUCTION
The future of healthcare system is based on the
development of new and innovative technologies with the
purpose of a more accurate, personalized, comfortable and
widespread diagnosis and treatment of pathologies [1].
The 2015-2025 decade has been elected the “Wearable
Era” for the diffusion and incidence of new miniaturized and
wearable products and related services in our life. Most of
these systems are related to health and lifestyle. Wearable
Biomedical System (WBS) and Wearable Health System
(WHS) are probably the most important among these
emerging technologies.
The most effective feature of these systems is the non-
intrusiveness that is more than non-invasiveness; they can
offer solutions for continuous monitoring by measuring non-
invasive bio-signal and biomedical parameters without
awareness of the user [4]. The non-invasiveness quality of a
Wearable Health and Biomedical System is often due to
garment embedded sensors. These sensors usually are built
on conductive textile sensor. One of the best example for
these systems are the smart t-shirts. Smart t-shirts are
garments with embedded textile sensors which can record
different biomedical signals: ECG (Electro-CardioGram),
Heart-rate,
Breath-rate,
skin
temperature
and
other
parameters [5]. All the signals are recorded by means of
conductive textiles allowing for several measurements based
on different metrological characteristics.
Moreover, this kind of conductive yarns, due to their
intrinsic features, could be also used as light wire, antenna or
electromagnetic shield. For this reason, the characterization
of the yarn and textile becomes mandatory in order to
increase the capability of this fabric.
In the last two years, different companies launched
different
types
of
sensorized
garment,
from
socks
(Sensoria®) [8] to Bra (OM-Signal®) [9]. Despite this, the
main purposes of these products are focused on sport
monitoring, which is mainly a one-spot measure. These
devices/garments are not developed for medical continuous
monitoring, which requires to match and respect strict
specifications for the medical applications. In order to
improve the performance of these smart garments and
increase the application field of these conductive tissues, this
paper reports a study on the performance and reliability of
different fabrics. The metrological characterization and the
study of stability over usage, time and washes, allows for
developing new sensors, applications and approaches which
can be used for sensorized garment. The rest of the paper is
structures as follow. In Section II, we defined the system
underling all the features that need to be validated; Section
III describes the metrological issues defining the proper
measuring. Section IV proposes the experimental setup for
each measures. Finally, we conclude with Sessions V and VI
which
show
the
experimental
results
and
some
considerations on these.
II.
MATERIALS
Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most used exams
for assessing the health status of the cardiovascular system.
Moreover, a few parameters extracted from ECG could also
be very useful in sport monitoring to detect the fatigue stages
and the athletes’ performances. Usually, these studies are
conducted by means of ambulatory ECG with standard Ag-
AgCl electrodes or chest belt based heart rate monitors. In
the first case, the use of electrodes and conductive gels could
modify the results due to the invasiveness of the procedure.
In the second case, the use of the chest belt requires the
electrodes to be well moistened and the belt fits snugly

around the chest; this could cause discomfort to the users.
Moreover, in some sports, the use of these system is
prevented by continuous impacts and displacements, caused
by the athletes’ gestures, which can cause noise and errors on
signals detected by the belt.
The study proposed in this paper starts from an already
validated sensorized t-shirt for sport [6]. One of the goals of
this study is the characterization of conductive textile in
order to optimize the capability and the reliability of this
fabric developing a new concept of sensorized t-shirt which
could be applied for non-invasive continuous medical
monitoring. The sensing t-shirt for medical application
consists of I-lead embedded ECG electrodes (Figure 1) and a
conductive strain gauge for respiratory activity monitoring.
Both ECG and respiratory signal are recorded by an ad-hoc
device which is connected to the sensing part by means of
snap buttons. As visible in Figure 1, snap buttons receive the
signal from ECG electrodes via conductive fabric. According
to
the
hereof
description,
studying
the
conductivity,
mechanical features and reliability of the yarn is mandatory.
Performances of the smart t-shirt depend also on
mechanical characteristics of the yarn and the design of the t-
shirt [7] and not only on conductive fabric. T-shirt usually is
designed as a technical t-shirt developed starting from
special yarn which is not only able to constrain electrodes
and sensors in the right positions, but it also inserts a certain
level of compression and thermoregulation, shaping the body
while maintaining the same comfort of a normal t-shirt. The
presence of two or more different yarns in the same cloth
requires a mechanical study of textures, especially for
elasticity which can compromise the stability and the contact
of the embedded textile sensors.
Textile electrodes consist into textile containing silver
yarn, mixed with cotton, lycra, or other fabric. The
composite mixture of conductive and non-conductive yarn
changes the features of the textile in elasticity, conductivity,
difference of elasticity over length and elongation, etc.
Due to the different composition of the conductive
textile, the quality of signals recorded by the t-shirt may
differ significantly. For this reason, this work aims to
investigate the performances of the different types of
conductive textiles in terms of:
-
Conductivity;
-
Elasticity;
-
Measurement repeatability and reproducibility;
-
Sensitivity versus disturbances;
-
Resistance to washing.
III.
METROLOGICAL ISSUES
There are several works in the literature focused on the
identification of performances of textile strain gauges, but
only few of them focus on the effect of disturbances on the
measurement
quality.
The
first
step
of
the
sensor
characterization is the identification of the textile strain
gauge sensitivity. These tests aim to identify the relationship
existing between the electrical resistance and the sensor
elongation, and the experimental setup usually pairs a
displacement measurement system with a 4-wire resistance
measurement circuit. In addition to the sensitivity versus the
measurand, sensors should also be characterized in terms of
sensitivity versus disturbances [2, 3].
The main issues deserving for investigation are:
1)
Measurement
repeatability,
which
provides
for
an
indication of a lower boundary for the measurement
uncertainty;
2)
Measurement reproducibility, that should assess, at
least, the change of electrical conductivity after several
washing cycles;
3)
Contact resistance: in the classical setup
for the
identification of the strain gauge sensitivity the fabric is
usually clamped at its ends so that it can be stretched for
the
calibration;
however,
the
electrical
resistance
measured in this way is the sum of the resistance of the
fabric and the electrical resistance between the setup and
the fabric. The latter has to be measured before the tests.

4)
Sensor creep: the creep results in a progressive and slow
modification of the electrical resistance in presence of
constant sensor deformation and should be quantified
with proper tests if sensors are used for long-term
monitoring of posture.
5)
Sensors’
dynamic
behavior:
often
the
frequency
response function of the sensors is far from the ideal
one, i.e. the sensitivity depends on the frequency of the
stimulus. The dynamic calibration is therefore needed in
order to identify the sensor frequency response.
6)
Sensitivity versus temperature and humidity: the sensor
behavior may depend on the temperature and on the
humidity, thus resulting in a decrease in measurement
performance
in
sports,
where
the
sweating
and
thermoregulation strongly vary.
IV.
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Different experimental setups for the complete sensor
calibration are mandatory. The first setup is obviously the
one for the static calibration, i.e. for the identification of the
variation of electrical resistance versus the displacement. We
have chosen to measure the sensor elongation with a linear
variable differential transformer (LVDT) DC/DC; this sensor
has
a
friction-free
core
and
incorporate
oscillator,
demodulator and filter providing a self-contained unit
accepting a DC input and providing a DC output relative to
armature position. The electrical resistance of the textile
sensor is measured by a four wire (volt-amperometric)
circuit: a stabilized current generator creates a current of 100
mA (to reduce the self-heating). The voltage drop across the
tensile sensor is measured by a National Instruments data
acquisition board and the electrical resistance is derived
using the Ohm law. The experimental setup is shown in
Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Experimental setup for the static calibration. The red circle
shows the sensor
This setup cannot be used to impose quick displacements
to the sensors; the textile strain gauge was therefore tested
with an electrodynamic shaker, as shown in Figure 3. The
upper extremity of the strain gauge and the lower one was
moved by the shaker head. The tests to identify the effects of
temperature and humidity were performed putting the setup
of Figure 2 into a climatic chamber, as shown in Figure 4.
The temperature range was between 10 and 40 °C and the
relative humidity was not constant during the tests. Further
tests were performed by spraying the sensor with water.
Tests for resistance to washing were conducted comparing
four different conductive fabrics. The composition of the
textiles makes them different in conductivity, elasticity and
on various mechanical aspects including the characteristics
decay after washing. The four fabrics were cut in 2x9 cm
patches and were washed for 20 times at 30° degrees with
mild soap. The textiles were dried in open air at 22° for
about 4/5 hours. The conductivity was measured with the
setup used for the static tests.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Results of the static calibration on one of the specimens
that underwent our tests is shown in Figure 5. The specimen
is 24% lycra with 74% silver and 2% polymer. As in many
other fabrics of this kind, the sensitivity is not constant and
therefore the resistance/length curve is not linear. The
approach, in this case, can be the use of a variable sensitivity
or the reduction of the useful range (45 to 65 mm) where the
linearization is not critical.
Figure 5.
Example of results obtained with the static calibration.
The contact resistance was measured by testing two
samples of different length; their electrical resistance is
proportional to their length and the measured resistance is
the sum of the sample resistance and the contact resistance.
The contact resistance with our setup was 0.17 Ω; this value
has to be subtracted from the raw measurements obtained
with the experimental setup.
The creep of one of the sensors that underwent our tests
is shown in Figure 6. In this particular case the displacement
was constant but resistance of the sensor increased of
approximately 6% after 20 hours. The creep may be critical
in all the application where the sensor is used to identify the
posture; DC reading is important and therefore a correction
procedure similar to that described in ref. [3] should be
adopted. In dynamic applications (e.g. breath monitoring) the
creep might be not relevant and this issue could be ignored.
Figure 6.
Creep tests of a specimen: resistance variation after 20 hours
Also the frequency response function may significantly
differ from the ideal (flat) one. Our tests showed that the
response to a sinusoidal excitation contains high order
harmonics, as shown in Figure 7. This can be due to the lack
of preload of the specimen and can lead to biased amplitude
estimation in presence of quick subject movements.

displacement (a) and specimen electrical resistance (b)
Also, the temperature and the humidity affect the
measured electrical resistance: the dependence might be very
complex, as shown in Figure 8. In this case, the resistance
was influenced not only by the temperature, but also by the
humidity, that was not constant during the tests. From this
perspective, results were coherent with the ones obtained by
spraying the specimens with water.

The last step to be investigated is the sensor aging: the
setup for static tests was used to compare the aging after 20
washing cycles of four different conductive textiles:
•
3D conductive textile: the silver yarn is mixed with a 3d
static filament which give to the fabric a thickness of
2mm. It consists in two different layers (one on the top
and one on the bottom) connected in the middle by
another more rigid conductive yarn which contributes
to thickness.
•
High elasticity textile: This fabric is composed by 76%
of nylon covered silver and 24% of elastic yarn. Thanks
to the nylon and elastic yarn, this textile is very elastic
in one direction (65% elongation), and less elastic (30%
elongation) in the perpendicular one.
•
Low elasticity textile: It consists in 99,9% silver yarn
coupled with a polymer. It is elastic in only one
direction (about 20% elongation).
•
Cotton/silver textile: This last textile is structured into
two layers: the firs layer is composed by 100% cotton
while the second layer consist in 50% silver and 50%
cotton. It has an elasticity that is intermediate between
the two previous ones.
The results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 9. The
measures were not taken in a controlled environment in order
to simulate the normal aging of an article of clothing. Results
show that the largest resistance variation occurs for cotton
and silver textile; this is due to the fact that this yarn is very
fragile and rupture of conductive fibers causes a considerable
increase of the resistance. Moreover, the result outlining that
the percentage of silver yarn in the textile is not directly
correlated to the high conductivity of the fabric.

CONCLUSION
In this work we have described the tests that should be
performed for a complete metrological characterization of a
textile
sensor.
The
setup
is
based
on
a
classic
voltamperometric circuit but allows performing static and
dynamic tests on the different specimens. The contact
resistance was approximately 0.17 Ω; this value is small, but
is of the same order of magnitude of the resistance of
specimens that underwent our tests. The static calibration
outlined that the behavior of some sensors is not linear,
similarly with what was evidenced in studies already
published. The creep was also relevant but could be
compensated using a first order regression model. Dynamic
tests are also mandatory in the sensors’ characterization,
given that on different specimen families the frequency
response function decreased above 1 Hz, mainly because of
the harmonic distortion due to the lack of elastic preload of
the sensor. Also the temperature, the humidity and the
washing affected the electrical resistance, thus showing that
a proper calibration and a pre/washing are mandatory to
obtain reliable results. Washing tests shows also that the
conductivity is not directly related with the percentage of
silver (conductive) yarn, but it is related with the knitting
technique.
In order to optimize the performances and the reliability,
all these aspects need to be taken into consideration when
developing a smart t-shirt for medical purposes. The
proposed set of measurements is one of the first proposals to
build a “standardized” protocol in this directions. Future
work will go in the direction of testing other fabrics and
eventually to identify other parameters and a related testing
methodology.
