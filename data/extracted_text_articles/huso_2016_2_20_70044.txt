Abstract—Social media, and in particular Twitter, are increasingly
being utilized during crises. It has been shown that tweets offer
valuable real-time information for decision-making. Given the
vast amount of data available on the Web, there is a need for
intelligent ways to select and retrieve the desired information.
Analyzing sentiment and emotions in online text is one option
for distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information. In this
study, we investigate to what extent automatic sentiment analysis
techniques can be used for detecting crisis emotions on Twitter.
Therefore, a corpus of tweets posted after the crash of German-
wings Flight 9525 was built and labeled with polarity and emotion
information. Preliminary results show better classiﬁcation results
for the negative sentiment class compared to the positive class.
An analysis of the more ﬁne-grained emotion classiﬁcation reveals
that sympathy and anger are the most frequently expressed
emotions in our corpus. To further enhance the performance of
emotion classiﬁcation in online crisis communication, it is crucial
to accurately detect i) the object of the crisis emotion and ii) the
characteristics of the sender.
Keywords–emotion detection; social media; natural language
processing; organizational crisis; crisis communication.

INTRODUCTION
The use of social media has thrived over the past
few years. As a consequence, the ways in which people
communicate during crisis situations have changed. Especially
the microblogging service Twitter has become a very popular
web
application
for
seeking
and
defusing
crisis-related
information [1], [2], [3]. Furthermore, it is an ideal way for
crisis managers to demonstrate their compassion, concern,
and empathy to stakeholders in case of an organizational
crisis. An organizational crisis can be described as “the
perception of an unpredictable event that threatens important
expectancies of stakeholders and can seriously impact an
organization’s performance and generate negative outcomes”
[4]. An event is partially deﬁned as a crisis by the perceptions
of stakeholders [4]. Bryson [5] deﬁnes a stakeholder as “a
person or a group that is inﬂuenced by or has an inﬂuence
on an organization”. Crises interfere with some stakeholder
expectancies, which results in people becoming angry and
upset. As a consequence, the organization is perceived less
positively and its reputation is damaged. It is critical for
organizations and public relations practitioners working in
the ﬁeld of crisis communication to have knowledge about
how to shape the appropriate strategies in response to crises.
Coombs’ [6], [7] Situational Crisis Communication Theory
(SCCT) is a dominant theory on crisis response strategies. It
takes an audience-centred approach in order to understand
stakeholders’ reactions in crisis situations by examining their
attribution of crisis responsibility [8]. Attribution theory
posits that people will make judgements about the causes
of events, especially those that are unexpected and generate
negative outcomes [6]. Since crises are (mostly) unforeseen
and negative, they are just the type of event that will produce
attributions. If stakeholders think an organization should have
been able to control a crisis or has made serious mistakes, they
will blame the organization for the crisis. Furthermore, greater
attributions of responsibility result in stronger feelings of
anger and more negative visions on people and organizations
[9], something that should be carefully monitored.
All of this shows that understanding people’s reactions
and emotions during a crisis is crucial for organizations. In
this paper, we explore how sentiment analysis can be used to
understand how publics consume crisis information. To this
end, a state-of-the-art sentiment analysis system was applied
to a Twitter dataset, which we collected after the crash of
a Germanwings aircraft in the French Alps in 2015. While
sentiment analysis systems classiﬁes the tweets according
to their polarity (positive, negative or neutral), they do not
give insights into the more ﬁne-grained emotions expressed
in texts. In order to better understand the types of emotions
expressed in our corpus, we further labeled the data with the
crisis-related emotion categories as proposed by Jin et al. [9]
and report our ﬁndings.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section II presents a literature overview on the analysis of
sentiment and emotions in crisis communication. In Section III,
we describe the experiments on sentiment classiﬁcation and
emotion detection whereas Section IV discusses the ﬁndings of
our analysis. Finally, in Section V we draw some conclusions
and present prospects for future work.

responsibility and crisis communication strategies. Therefore,
crisis managers should understand how crisis situations are
appraised and evaluated by stakeholders [8]. It was found
that stronger attributions of crisis responsibility result in
feelings of anger and in some extreme cases in schadenfreude
(i.e., getting pleasure from the pain of others) toward the
organization [10]. Moreover, feelings of sympathy for the
organization reduce if a crisis is not handled properly. Due
to negative emotions, stakeholders can decide to break off
interactions with an organization or engage in negative word
of mouth about the organization.
Tweets provide useful real-time information for decision-
making and communication during crises [11], [12]. However,
given the vast amount of data online, this information cannot
be directly used. Applying sentiment analysis is one option to
make this vast amount of information manageable and usable.
By using sentiment analysis, tweets expressing positive and
negative emotions can be detected and analyzed against each
other. Contrary to sentiment analysis, which classiﬁes tweets
as positive or negative, affect analysis or emotion recognition
classiﬁes tweets as belonging to a speciﬁc emotional state (e.g.,
happiness, anger) [13]. Since it is a multinomial classiﬁcation
problem rather than a binary classiﬁcation problem, affect
analysis is even more challenging than sentiment analysis [14].
Most systems for automatic analysis of emotions are based on
the six basic emotions of Ekman [15], namely anger, fear,
sadness, enjoyment, disgust, and surprise. Strapparava and
Mihalcea [13] constructed a large data set of news headlines
that were annotated with these basic emotions and developed
a binary classiﬁer for each emotion. Their experiments show
that the classiﬁcation performance varies strongly between
the different emotion categories (F= 4.68 for disgust vs. F=
32.78 for joy). However, the Ekman scale does not account
for the typical emotions expressed in organizational crises.
In order to account for these crisis-related emotions, Jin
et al. [9] proposed an emotion framework in which they
identiﬁed three clusters of crisis emotions: i) attribution-
independent emotions, which consist of anxiety, fear, ap-
prehension, and sympathy; ii) external-attribution-dependent
emotions, including disgust, contempt, anger, and sadness;
and iii) internal-attribution-dependent emotions, which consist
of embarrassment, guilt, and shame. Attribution-independent
emotions are emotions people feel toward a crisis situation;
external-attribution-dependent emotions are emotions people
feel about an organization in a crisis; and internal-attribution-
dependent emotions are emotions people feel for themselves
as stakeholders involved in a crisis.

AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF SENTIMENT AND
EMOTION IN CRISIS-RELATED MICROPOSTS
In this section, we report on the data and different exper-
iments we performed on the tweets related to the crash of a
Germanwings airplane in the French Alpes.
A. Dataset
On Tuesday, March 24, 2015, around 10:41 Central
European Time, an Airbus A320-200 crashed in the French
Alps, 100 kilometres northwest of Nice. It concerned Flight
9525, an international passenger ﬂight from Barcelona-El Prat
Airport in Spain to D¨usseldorf Airport in Germany. The ﬂight
was operated by Germanwings, a low-cost airline owned by
Lufthansa. First, the crash was assumed to be an accident.
On March, 26, however, the French Bureau d’Enquˆetes et
d’Analyses pour la S´ecurit´e de l’Aviation Civile discovered
after analyzing the aircraft’s ﬂight data recorder that co-pilot
Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the aircraft. Two pilots,
four cabin crew members, and 144 passengers were on board
of the aircraft. No one survived the crash. In the week after
the crash, evidence was found that Lubitz suffered from a
psychosomatic illness and that he was taking prescription
drugs.
For this paper’s study, a corpus of English tweets was
collected. The Twitter search facility was used in order to ﬁnd
all English posts, made by any Twitter user, that contained
the hashtag ‘#GermanWingsCrash’. Given the vast amount of
tweets, a random selection was made of a maximum of 25
tweets per hour, posted between March 24, 2015 and April 6,
2015. A total of 5,490 English tweets were harvested.

B. Sentiment Classiﬁcation
In order to determine the sentiment that was conveyed
in the tweets, we used a machine learning approach to
sentiment detection [16] to determine the polarity of the
tweets. We used the system developed by Van Hee et al. [16]
in the framework of the SemEval-2014 Task 9 on sentiment
analysis in Twitter. First, linguistic preprocessing (including
tokenization, PoS-tagging, lemmatization and dependency
parsing) was performed on the datasets. Then, a number
of lexical and syntactic features were implemented: n-gram
features, word shape features (e.g., the number of capitalized
words), lexicon features, syntactic features (e.g., Part-of-
Speech information), named entity features and PMI features
(PMI values indicate the association of a word with positive
and negative sentiment). After performing feature selection
experiments, it was discovered by Van Hee et al. [16] that
features based on n-grams, sentiment lexicons, and Part-of-
Speech tags were most contributive for labelling a message
or an instance of that message as positive, negative, or neutral.
The system labelled 676 tweets as positive, 2,815 tweets as
negative, and 1,999 tweets as neutral. Given that this corpus
contains tweets referring to the crash, the large number of
negative tweets is not surprising. In order to assess the quality
of the automatic labelling, we manually annotated a corpus
of 200 tweets with polarity information (see Table II). We
observed a classiﬁcation accuracy of 73.17% for the negative
class, 26.92% for the positive class and 64.83% for the neutral
class. The total system accuracy amounted to 63.32%. It can
be concluded that the system particularly made mistakes with
regard to the positive class label. This could be explained
by the fact that the system has been trained with Twitter
messages on a variety of general topics and not with crisis-
related tweets. As a result, the training datasets delivered in the
framework of the SemEval-2014 shared task contained more
positive tweets (38.20%). Moreover, it can be concluded that
the system performed best with regard to the negative class
label. This is a signiﬁcant advantage in crisis situations, in
which the detection of negative emotions is highly important.

C. Towards Emotion Detection
Research on understanding emotions in crisis-related
tweets and more speciﬁcally to pinpoint those tweets which
might cause organizational harm, is scarce. Consequently, no
system was available yet to detect crisis-related emotional
content in tweets. In order to better understand the types
of emotions expressed, we took the 200 tweets which were
manually labeled with polarity information and also labeled
them with emotions. For this purpose, the scale of Jin et
al. [9] was used, since it was speciﬁcally developed for
measuring the publics’ emotions in organizational crises. This
crisis emotion scale consists of thirteen discrete emotions,
being anger, anxiety, apprehension, confusion, contempt,
disgust, embarrassment, fear, guilt, sadness, shame, surprise,
and sympathy. For the annotation, we grouped a number
of emotions as they were difﬁcult to differentiate, namely
anxiety and fear, and shame and embarrassment. Tweets that
conveyed an emotion that did not occur in Jin et al.’s crisis
emotion scale were labelled as other.
For the tweets expressing a positive or a negative sentiment,
we tagged the emotional content as one of the classes anger,
fear, apprehension, confusion, contempt, disgust, embarrass-
ment, guilt, sadness, surprise, sympathy and other. Table I
gives an overview of the occurrence of these emotion classes
in our English gold standard corpus. Sympathy, anger and
contempt are the emotions that were most frequently expressed
in the data. No tweets conveying embarrassment or guilt were
found in our gold standard corpus. For each emotion class, an
example tweet is represented in the last column.
IV.
REFLECTIONS
Important to note is that the current annotation scheme
fails to detect the object of the expressed emotion. While
the sympathy emotions are mostly expressed towards the
family members of the victims, the tweets expressing anger
and contempt have a completely different object, most often
the co-pilot that deliberately crashed the plane (e.g., “F’ing
lunatic. Kill yourself, not a load of passengers! #ﬂight9525”).
In order to make emotion detection really viable for business
intelligence, a more ﬁne-grained approach in the annotation
of the external-attribution-dependent emotions should be
taken into account.This way, not only emotions are labelled,
but also the objects of these emotions (and maybe also the
senders of these emotions), a tendency we also observe in
the domain of sentiment analysis (see Pontiki et al. [17]).
Important to know for crisis managers of companies such as
Germanwings and Lufthansa is how people report on their
organizations, something which is not being covered by the
current annotation scheme.
A shallow analysis of the tweets reveals that many of them
refer to the aviation sector as a whole (“sad day in aviation
again”, “another ﬂight crash”, “far too many planes going
down”, “In The Wake Of The #GermanWingsCrash Crash,
Should You Trust Low-Cost Airlines?”, etc.), which has a
general image problem. Two main criticisms were speciﬁcally
targeted towards both Germanwings and Lufthansa: i) that they
did not immediately release the names of the pilots (which
was done a day after the crash) and ii) that the cockpit should
always have two persons present (this two-in-the-cockpit rule
was very soon adopted). If this criticism would have been
automatically detected, then crisis managers would have had
a guiding tool for adequate crisis communications while the
crisis was unfolding. This is how accurate emotion detection
in the future could make a difference, ultimately reducing
reputation harm for organizations.
V.
CONCLUSION
The main goal of this study was to investigate the extent
to which automatic sentiment analysis techniques can be used
to detect crisis emotions on Twitter. We conclude that the
sentiment analysis system performed better on negative tweets
when compared to tweets expressing a positive emotion. Al-
though during crises negative emotions are most prevalent and

relevant for crisis emotions to focus upon, positive emotions
should not be neglected. To have a better understanding of how
stakeholders respond to crisis victims (e.g., by showing sympa-
thy), to the organization itself –both at the beginning of a crisis,
while the crisis is unfolding and after crisis communication has
been made (e.g., apologies, condolences), it is also crucial to
have a more ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation of speciﬁc crisis-related
emotions. In order to allow for the future development of such
automatic procedures, we conducted a small corpus analysis
for which we manually labeled our corpus with crisis-related
emotions. We found that sympathy and anger were the most
frequently expressed emotions in the English gold standard
corpus in the case of the Germanwings crash. We also observed
that the annotation of crisis-related emotions in the tweets was
insufﬁcient to support organizational crisis communication. To
further enhance the usefulness of automatic (crisis) emotion
detection on social media, future studies should work on the
classiﬁcation of contextual information, such as the object and
characteristics of the sender of the crisis emotion.
