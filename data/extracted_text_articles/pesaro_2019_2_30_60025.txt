Abstract— Safe integration is an unresolved issue across
different disciplines, and many problems happen due to
improper integration of a product or system. Safe integration
is beyond technical integration and requires both technical and
nontechnical knowledge. This paper highlights the scope of
integration challenges and sheds light on safe integration. It
outlines a systemic view of safe integration and provides an
example application for further clarification.
Keywords - systems integration; safe integration; integration

INTRODUCTION
Our society is becoming less tolerant to safety failures
while it demands up-to-date technologies. People require
seamless integration of new technologies with everyday life.
We need products and services that are effortlessly usable in
different contexts. Given the increasing complexity of high-
tech systems, there is a need for new methods and
techniques to support proper integration of newly developed
systems or products. The challenge is far beyond technical
installations and more than the integration of hardware,
software, and human for a single product or system. The
high pace of technological developments demands strategies
that not only fulfil the technical requirements but also
successfully address interoperability and dependability of
systems, data integrity, security, or privacy matters. The
main drivers and ingredients for safe integration are
presented in Figure 1.
Integration creates a unique selling point for businesses.
For example, Apple is conscious about seamless integration
among its products aiming to deliver the ultimate use-
experience for the users. In brief, proper integration is a
prerequisite for a modern society. In the previous work [1],
the author provides several examples of systems challenges
for the rail industry. Yet, the scope of integration challenges
crosses different industries.
The public is sensitive to integration failures imposing
extra costs and resources [2]. Examples of needs for
integration are across different disciplines and industries.
Augmented Reality (AR) and its integration with human-life
in the form of camera, wearables, games, or education are
examples for the need for safe integration of technology
with everyday life. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another
example where machines are being used to facilitate higher
capabilities and performances. Here, safe integration is
required at different levels. The first level of integration is
superposition of components to make a product. If the
components are properly put next to each other, then the
product as a whole should be properly integrated and used.
This is the second level of integration. For the third level of
integration, the product has to be properly integrated into
the environment and be safely used. Integration issues
happen at all these levels, and the issues can go beyond
technical matters. Figure 2 presents three different examples
for the integration problem for bicycles. In all these three
cases, the issues were dangerous to users and therefore the
products were pulled out of the European market. Figure
2.A presents a city bike which was recalled under alert
number A12/0134/19. The defect in the front mudguard may
block the front wheel of this bicycle during the use and lead
to an accident. Figure 2.B shows a children’s bicycle where
the nuts on the cranks have sharp edges, and they may harm
children during the riding or maintenance of the bicycle.
This product, which was recalled under the alert number
A11/0066/17, is an example of faulty design with regard to
human-product integration. The third example, Figure 2.C
presents a bike which suffers from defective sealing for its
batteries which may result in accumulation of humidity
inside the battery and cause overheating and self-ignition.
This is an example issue for integration of a product with its
environment. This product was recalled under the alert
number A12/0497/15.

In addition to highlighting the needs for integration, this
paper reviews currently used tools and discusses the
ingredients for safe integration. Section II provides a review
of tools and techniques. The outcomes have been further
discussed in Section III, where a systemic approach for safe
integration is described. Section IV presents an example
application for the safe integration of bicycles to the urban
system. Conclusions are drawn in Section V.

SAFE INTEGRATION
Safe integration starts with a proper understanding of the
stakeholders
and
their
needs.
Systems
Engineering
handbook highlights the human system integration (HSI).
HSI considers domains such as human factors engineering
(human performance, human interface, user centred design),
workload
(normal
and
emergency),
training
(skill,
education,
attitude),
personnel
(ergonomics,
accident
avoidance),
working
condition
and
health
(hazard
avoidance) [3]. These domains have direct links to safety.
As a matter of fact, integration is similar to safety from
several perspectives inheriting a multidisciplinary nature
where different techniques and methods can be used for safe
system integration. The Swiss cheese model of accidents
developed by J.T. Reason presents a model for integration
of different system layers in which the risk of a threat may
become a reality [4]. The failure mode and effect analysis
(FMEA) helps finding potential failure modes for hardware,
software, or processes. The fault tree analysis is a systematic
approach to present the possible faults related to a specific
event. For analysing the operability problems, hazard and
operability analysis (HAZOP) is used. The root cause
analysis (RCA) focuses on the positive and negative
consequences of events. ISO 12100, the reference standard
for safety of machinery, pays special attention to safety
matters during assembly of a machine or its integration with
the surrounding environment [5]. IEC 61508 a seminal
standard for functional safety delivered in several parts. Its
first three parts focus respectively on general requirements,
requirements for E/E/PE, and requirements for software for
safety-related systems. Part 1 of this standard addresses
issues on system safety validation and system integration
(tests) including architecture, software, and PE integration
tests. Part 2 addresses the module and system integration for
safety-related systems, and Part 3 focuses on software
testing and integration. Integration is comparable with
safety
inheriting
multidimensional
problems
where
stakeholders
with
shared
goals
need
experience
and
technology to make proper decisions and remove, minimise,
or control the risks. Technology readiness level (TRL),
integration readiness level (IRL), safety by design and
safety cubes are the methods to ensure better integration of
products or systems.
As a result of reviewing these references, three common
blocks have been identified for these as discussed earlier in
[1]. Human (or people), system and environment are the

integration issues)

three building blocks for both of the design process and
safety management process.
III.
PRINCIPLES FOR SAFE INTEGRATION
One of the primary tasks for engineering design, systems
engineering, or risk management is to ensure seamless and
safe integration of a system with its environment. In this
perspective, dealing with relations among the system,
subsystems, environment, and people is of primary concern.
These relations, or the so-called interfaces, represent one of
the core issues for proper integration. Figure 3 schematically
shows the main building blocks for safe integration and
their relations. These are principles elements of the so-called
safety cube, will be discussed in further details next.
A.
Human
Human or people in this context refers to individual or
group of individuals who have connections to the system of
interest.
They
can
be
stakeholders,
designers,
users,
operators, owners, service providers, producers, or other
humans who directly or indirectly have interest in the
system and cooperate or compete with it. People have their
own individual or organisational culture.
B.
System
System refers to the system (or product) of interest that
delivers the required functions. The system of interest is
independent, and it can be a part of a system of systems.
The system includes subsystems or components that form its
structure to deliver the required functions under its specific
behaviour.
Equipment,
facilities,
and
procedures
for
operation are parts of the system.
C.
Environment
Environment
includes
the
system
of
interest,
the
cooperating systems, and the competing systems which
influence the system of interest. This excludes people which
have been discussed earlier. Relevant regulations, industry
standards, or supporting facilities are part of the system
environment.
D.
Human-system relation
Human can have different roles and consequently
different relations with the system of interest. For a system,
the user, stakeholder, operator, owner, or supplier may have
different, competing, or even conflicting interests. This
relation can be in the form of (physical) interface, operation,
control, maintenance, or cognitive which can directly or
indirectly influence the system. Operational and safety
culture influences human-system relation.
E.
System-environment relation
The system of interest connects to its environment. The
relation between a system and its environment is often seen
in the form of interfaces for technical installation under
three categories of structure, information, and energy. It is
important to note that the system is also under the influence
of
regulations,
policy,
and
political
interests
of
the
environment.
F.
Human-environment relation
Although, the relation between human and environment
often falls out of the scope of system of interest in
technological design, it has dominant influence on the
system of interest. Change of regulations in a dynamic and
competitive
(geo)political
context,
policy
making
and
governance are examples of human-environment relations.
This often becomes very complex for systems where
multiple stakeholders are involved.
To summarise, Table I provides an overview for the
outcomes of this section. This is the information needed for
forming a safety cube. The diagonals of this table specify
the human, system, and environment for the system of
interest where the other cells provide information about the
connection between diagonals. The off-diagonals have to be
read clock-wise in such a way that the associated row
provides input for the associated column. For example, the

human-system cell at the top row describes the human
output as input for the system whereas the system-human
cell at the second row describes the system output as input
for human.
Table I summarises the system definition and provides
an overview of the building blocks and their connections for
safe integration. Although this is an important starting point
and it is necessary to have a good understanding of the
system and interaction between its elements, it does not
focus on the system of interest. Therefore, there is a need to
reorganise this information and move the focus to the
system, subsystems, functions, structure, and behaviour. For
this purpose, the points below need to be considered.
• The system of interest needs to be elaborated and
relations between system, its subsystems, and super-
systems need to be elaborated in further details.
• System of systems and environment can be merged.
As result, the term environment refers to both system
of systems and environments.
• Human is partly related to use and partly related to the
environment of the system.
In order to address these points, Table II is produced
representing the results of Table I with more focus on the
system of interest. This presents the information for the so-
called system safety cube. The rows of this table focus on
the system of interest, its super system (or environment) and
subsystems. The columns focus on requested functions (or
malfunctions), physical structure, and the use (or misuse)
scenarios. The questions below help to keep the focus per
each column.
For the first column of Table II, the relevant questions
are the following.
• Why does the (super/sub) system of interest exist?
• What is its purpose?
• What does it do?
• What are the requirements?
• What are the functions and services?
• What if it malfunctions or the services are interrupted?
For the second column of the table, one may ask the
following questions.
• What are the elements of this (super/sub) system of
interest?
• How do they connect?
• How is the energy provided?
• How is the information flow?
• What are the interfaces?
• How does it work?
• What if some components, subsystems, or interfaces
fail?
For the third column of this table, or the use purpose,
one may ask the following questions:
• Who are the people who have interest in the system?
• How do they influence the system?
• How do they use it?
• What are the foreseeable misuse scenarios?
IV. EXAMPLE APPLICATION
This section presents an example application for safe
integration of a bicycle to the urban environment. This is an
interesting example because cycling is economic, healthy,
and green for urban transportation. Yet, safety of cyclists is
essential
for
making
that
a
popular
way
of
urban
transportation. In the Netherlands, about 35% of people use
frequently bicycles on a daily basis and this backs the public
demand for safety. In 1970, people protested against a high
number of child death on the roads and started the
movement entitled "stop the child murderer" because of a
high rate of casualties, especially on the cross-overs [6].
This demand influenced the government policy in the
Netherlands perceiving bicycle as a critical means for safe

transportation in urban areas. Along with geographical
considerations,
bike-friendly
infrastructures
and
bike-
friendly policy are the keys for the safe integration of
bicycles into the system [7].
Here in this example, elements for safe integration have
been described and listed through the approach introduced
earlier in this paper. For this purpose, three elements of
human, system, and environment are the starting points.
Table
III
describes
these
three
elements
and
their
connections. This table shows what the needs are for
creating safe cycling experience for users. It is far beyond a
design of a safe bicycle and safe helmet requiring an
integral view that combines proper infrastructures with
supportive policy and embracing culture in order to achieve
the optimum results.
Table IV represents this information with the focus on
the system of interest, its subsystems, and super-system. It is
important to note that the tables presented here for this
example do not present all the detailed information for the
safe integration of bicycles into urban areas.
In order to verify if the proposed approach can capture
the essential elements of safe integration, a number of
references have been reviewed as mentioned earlier in this
section. The results confirm that the elements of safe
integration have been captured in this approach. Yet, further
elaboration is needed capture the details elements of safe
design and their connections for safe integration.
V.
CONCLUSIONS
For safe integration, one needs to pay attention to the
system, its environment, and people who have connection to
the system. As a matter of fact, the prerequisite of safe
integration is proper system definition describing the system
of interest, its structure, requirements and behaviour, people
who influence it, its environment or super-system, and the
relations. For safe integration, one needs to pay attention to
use and misuse, function and malfunction, and components
or interfaces as well as their failures. The proposed
approach seems to be able to help for a quick verification
and validation plan in early design phases, and this is a
subject to further research.
