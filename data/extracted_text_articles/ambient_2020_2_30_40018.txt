Abstract – There is a lack of long-term research on the effects of 
indoor environmental quality on concentration in real 
environments using objective measurements. Concentration is 
an essential part of learning and processing information. Since 
pupils and students spend large parts of their days indoors, it 
can have major effects on their concentration. This paper 
presents an environmental monitoring system for collecting 
continuous indoor environmental quality data and studies the 
relationship between indoor environmental quality and pupil 
concentration in a real-life environment. An 18-week pilot was 
conducted in one school in Northern Finland during the autumn 
in 2018. Pupils (n=83) and teachers (n=4) in four classrooms 
participated in the study. Data on pupil concentration was 
collected twice a week via paper-format concentration tests. 
Additionally, teachers evaluated pupil concentration on a daily 
basis. A non-parametric correlation analysis (Spearman) was 
performed to investigate the associations between indoor 
environmental quality and pupil concentration. A statistically 
significant inverse association was found between pupil 
concentration and the relative humidity in all four classrooms, 
but no consistent associations with other indoor environmental 
quality parameters were found.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
People spend most of their time indoors, and students and 
teachers spend a large portion of it in school buildings, up to 
700 to 900 hours on average per year [1]. This is why the 
Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) notably affects public 
health. There are 76.1 million students [2] and 5.8 million 
teachers [3] in Europe spending time in school environments, 
which often have poor Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). 
IEQ comprises air quality pollutants, mainly gases and 
particulates, and other factors, such as temperature, relative 
humidity, lighting, sound level and vibration [4]. The 
concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and Volatile Organic 
Compounds (VOCs) are well-known key parameters affecting 
IAQ [5]. Poor long-term IEQ is known to be associated with 
several health effects such as respiratory illnesses, allergic 
reactions, asthma, sick building symptoms, and reduced 
cognitive performance, which are estimated to generate high 
costs for society [6]. 
Concentration is essential for learning and performing 
school tasks. It is also highly important in information-
intensive work. Concentration is affected by different 
environmental factors. It has been found that the IEQ affects 
pupils’ cognitive performance when thermal conditions, 
pollutants such as VOC, particles, and CO2 levels were 
reviewed [7][8]. Moreover, inadequate IEQ can cause general 
symptoms, such as headaches, dizziness, tiredness, and eye 
complaints, which may have a direct effect on learning and, 
therefore, test performance [9]. Increased ventilation has been 
associated with pupils’ faster performance in tasks [10][11] 
and more accurate responses [11]. In a study, where 70 
elementary schools were monitored for a weeklong period, 
better mathematics test scores were found when ventilation 
rate was higher [12]. It seems that increased levels of CO2 due 
to insufficient ventilation as well as thermal discomfort can 
reduce students’ vigilance and concentration. However, all the 
previous experiments have been rather short-term and 
conducted in controlled environments. An 8-month study in a 
real office environment showed that perceived thermal 
discomfort, noise annoyance and lighting discomfort were 
associated with reduced work performance and objectively 
measured cognitive performance [13]. The study excluded 
objective measurements of the IEQ parameters as the study 
parameters, including temperature, light, sound, and 
performance, 
were 
measured 
with 
a 
self-reporting 
questionnaire. There is also evidence that noise can adversely 
affect children’s learning [14]. Environmental factors have 
been found to cause diminished motivation, tiredness, and 
feelings of helplessness, which can result in reduced cognitive 
performance [13][15]. In contrast to this, natural light can 
improve students’ concentration. However, the only study on 
this was based on students’ perceptions of IEQ factors and 
lacked objective measurements of IEQ [16]. More long-term 
studies in real life environments with objective measurements 
would be required to confirm the results. 
Measuring real-life IEQ should be non-invasive and 
continuous, but to date, real-time IEQ data with interpretable 
information have rarely been available. However, recent 
improvements in wireless and electronics technologies have 
enabled the development of low-cost, low-power, and 
multifunctional sensors, which can be embedded in 
environments and can provide new means to acquire real-time 
information about indoor conditions. 
This paper describes an 18-week pilot which aimed to 
study associations between objective IEQ parameters and 
pupil concentration in an uncontrolled, real learning 
environment. Additionally, it describes an environmental 
monitoring system for measuring IEQ parameters, including: 
CO2, relative humidity, temperature, ambient lighting, sound 
levels, and an IAQ index. This paper is structured as follows: 
Section 2 describes the methods, Section 3 presents the 
results, which are discussed in Section 4, and Section 5 
presents the conclusions.

METHODS 
A. Pilot Environment 
The 18-week pilot was carried out in a school in Northern 
Finland between August and December 2018. Four 
classrooms were monitored in two separate buildings. 
Building 1 was constructed in 1999 and building 2 was 
constructed in 1936 (renovated in 2005). The heating season 
started in the end of September. All the classrooms had a 
mechanical ventilation system, which the school personnel 
could not control. The ventilation rates in classrooms 1 to 4 
were 8.6, 9.5, 10.0 and 11.9 L/s/person, respectively (Table I). 
B. Participants 
Four teachers and their 83 pupils (n=19+18+23+23=83) 
participated in the study. The average age of the teachers was 
43.5 years and all of them were women. The average age of 
the pupils was 8.6 years. Of the pupils, 33 (39.8%) were girls 
and 50 (60.2%) boys. The teachers and pupils spent most of 
the school days in the same classroom during the study. 
C. Data Collection 
The data were collected from three sources: 1) IEQ sensors 
(IEQ data), 2) paper-format concentration tests performed by 
the pupils (pupil concentration data), and 3) an Android self-
reporting application used by the teachers (teacher-reported 
pupil concentration data). The 18-week pilot contained 5 
phases. In the 1st phase (2 weeks), the collection of the pupil 
concentration data was rehearsed. In the 2nd phase (6 weeks), 
the data collection (sources 1-3) was ongoing. Data collection 
continued until the end of the study. In the 3rd phase (3 
weeks), the teachers were provided access to visualizations of 
IEQ data. In the 4th phase (3 weeks), air purifiers (UniqAir 
[17]) were brought into the classrooms (2 real, 2 mock-ups). 
In the 5th phase (4 weeks), the air purifiers were relocated so 
that each classroom had a real purifier in phase four or five. 
1) Indoor Environmental Quality 
All four pilot classrooms were equipped with an IEQ 
sensor system built of commercially available professional 
quality sensor devices. The temperature, relative humidity, 
CO2, ambient lighting and IAQ index were measured using 
MCF-LW12CO2 environmental sensor devices [18]. The 
IAQ index represents breath Volatile Organic Compound (b-
VOC) concentration for the most important compounds in the 
exhaled breath of humans and is the output of a proprietary 
algorithm for the Bosch BME680 VOC gas sensor [19]. The 
sound level was monitored with PeakTech PT8005 sound 
level meters [20].

All the sensors were positioned according to the national 
legislative recommendations [21]. IEQ sensor devices were 
installed next to teacher’s post at about 1.1 meters above the 
floor level in the classrooms. Sound level meters were 
positioned in an open space at least 0.5 meters away from any 
obstacles, including but not limited to floors, walls, ceilings, 
and furniture, in the residence zone of the classrooms. The 
sampling rate was once per 15 minutes and 5 seconds for the 
MFC sensor and sound level meter, respectively. Data transfer 
from the MCF sensor devices to the Microsoft Azure cloud 
platform was set via a LoRaWAN gateway and from 
PeakTech devices using Raspberry PI (RPI) gateways. In the 
implemented IEQ system, message queue telemetry (MQTT) 
was the utilized data communication protocol from the IEQ 
gateways to the cloud service. All the sensor data were stored 
in the Microsoft Azure TableStorage. An overview of the 
system architecture and details on the sensor hardware are 
depicted in Figure 1 and Table II. 
2) Pupil Concentration 
The pupil concentration data was collected using a paper-
format concentration test administered twice a week by the 
teachers. The concentration test had to be short (max. 5 min to 
administer), feasible for large group testing, performed 
without computers, suitable for children aged from 7 to 12 
years, and suitable for repeated testing. Liukkonen [22] 
presented a test (numbers in a 10-by-10 grid from 1 to 100) 
that was considered feasible to administer by the teachers and 
could easily be varied by sorting numbers in a different order 
each time. A random generator was used to create unique 
number grids for each test. The pupils were given four minutes 
time to find numbers in numerical order. The duration was 
determined by two training tests with the pupils so it would 
not give too many close to zero or close to full scores. 
Teachers considered it infeasible to administer the 
concentration test more than twice a week (between Tuesday 
and Thursday). The test was conducted at the end of a 45-
minute lesson, when teachers considered the entire class to be

in the classroom in order to maximize the number of the pupils 
and the time spent in the classroom. If there were changes in 
the school week, the test was conducted on another day or in 
another lesson if possible. Teachers reported any variance 
related to performing the test (day, contextual factors etc.). 
The number of girls and boys taking the test was recorded. 
3) Teacher-Reported Pupil Concentration 
A teacher-reported pupil concentration was the teachers’ 
evaluation of the pupils’ concentration during the day and it 
was collected every school day with an Android self-reporting 
application made by VTT Technical Research Centre of 
Finland Ltd (VTT). Teachers answered daily the question 
“How would you evaluate the concentration of the pupils 
today?” A 5-point answer scale was used consisting of the 
following options: 1) Extremely concentrated, 2) Concentra-
ted, 3) Neutral, 4) Non-concentrated, 5) Extremely non-con-
centrated. The data were stored via an HTTP/REST interface 
in a MongoDB database in the Azure cloud (Figure 1). 
D. Data Analysis 
1) Indoor Environmental Quality 
The concentration tests were performed at the end of a 45-
minute lesson. Thus, the average for the IEQ sensor 
parameters over a 45-minute time span before the test 
occasion was calculated and used in the analyses. The average 
was calculated for the temperature, relative humidity, CO2, 
ambient lighting, IAQ index, and two sound level sensors. 
2) Pupil Concentration 
The pupil concentration test results were converted to 
digital format by one researcher. The final score was the total 
number of the marked numbers. Among the test papers, there 
were a few zero results indicating that the subjects had given 
up, and few full scores indicating potential cheating. In some 
cases, the pupils were given more than 4 minutes by mistake, 
and therefore only the tests that were conducted exactly in four 
minutes were included in the analysis. Median, mean and 
trimmed mean values (excluding 25% of the outlying values) 
were counted and preliminary correlation tests were 
performed to see whether the results would be similar. The 
median was chosen for being more resistant to extreme 
outliers, and because there were no obvious differences 
between correlations. 
3) Teacher-Reported Pupil Concentration 
The answers from the day the pupils performed the 
concentration task were included in these analyses. 
4) Statistical Analyses  
The data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics tool 
(version 24). The IEQ and concentration data were 
investigated for the four classrooms and the differences 
between the classrooms were compared using a Kruskal-
Wallis test because the data were not normally distributed. 
The association between the IEQ and pupil concentration data 
was assessed using Spearman’s correlation.  
E. Ethical Considerations 
This study was performed in accordance with ethical 
guidelines and Regulation EU 2016/679 (General Data 
Protection Regulation). The study for the school environment 
was reviewed and accepted by the Ethics Committee of VTT. 
A bulletin on the study with contact details was sent to the 
pupils’ parents via the school’s electronic messaging system. 
The principal presented the study in a parents’ meeting. 
Individual pupils were neither identified nor connected to a 
specific concentration test in the study. The teachers gave 
general information about the class (the number of girls and 
boys and their ages). The participating teachers provided 
informed written consent. 
III. 
RESULTS 
The data characteristics (see Table III) on the averaged 
IEQ parameters show that most parameters were close to the 
recommended target values. In all rooms, the ambient lighting 
surpassed the targets and even the action limit (limit calling 
for action when surpassed) occasionally. The relative 
humidity fell outside the targets occasionally, and the sound 
levels were always above the targets. In detail, the CO2 levels 
slightly surpasses the recommended limits in two classrooms. 
The recommended target value is 350 ppm, plus outdoor CO2 
(about 430 ppm in Northern Finland) [23], but remained 
below the action limit (1150 ppm + outdoor CO2) in all 
classrooms [21]. The relative humidity exceeded the target 
values in all classrooms (target 30-40%) [23], while remaining 
just below the action limit (>60%) [21]. A low relative 
humidity is quite typical during the heating season. 
Additionally, the minimum ambient lighting values were very 
low, occasionally even surpassing the action limit in all rooms 
(target >400 lx, action if <200 lx) [23]-[25]. The temperatures 
were slightly below the recommended target level in one 
classroom (target 21.5±1.5°C) [23], but still within the action 
limits (<18 or >26°C) [21]. The sound levels were high in all 
classrooms with the minimum 47 dB (daytime average target 
35 dB), but values were clearly below the action limit (>80 
dB) [21]. The IAQ index was high compared to the sensor 
manufacturer target in all classrooms (target  150) [19]. 
There was a statistically significant difference across all 
four classrooms in all IEQ parameters except relative 
humidity and pupil concentration. The selected three IEQ 
parameters (CO2, relative humidity, and temperature) and 
pupil concentration are shown in Figure 2. The graphs show a 
slight increase in pupil concentration results throughout the 
pilot, but no remarkable changes after the change of phase. 
From the IEQ parameters, the variation is very small in 
temperature. The relative humidity seems to drop at the end of 
September to a lower level indicating the start of the heating 
season. The CO2 level varied around a similar base level 
throughout the pilot.

The correlations between the IEQ and pupil concentration 
are shown per classroom in Table IV. The strongest 
correlation was found between the relative humidity and pupil 
concentration with the correlation coefficient ρ varying from 
-0.73 to -0.57. This negative correlation indicates an inverse 
relationship between relative humidity and pupil concentra-
tion. This parameter exhibited variation outside the target 
range. No consistent and strong relationships between other 
IEQ parameters and pupil concentration were found. How-
ever, the following discrete correlations were found: a weak 
positive correlation with CO2 in room 1 (ρ=0.493, P=.012) 
and room 3 (ρ=0.491, P=.011), a negative weak correlation 
with ambient lighting in room 3 (ρ=-0.468, P=.016), a weak 
negative correlation with temperature in room 2 (ρ=-0.642, 
P=.001), and a moderate (positive) correlation with the sound 
level in room 2 (ρ=0.460, P=.014). There was no significant 
correlation in individual rooms between the measured pupil 
concentration and teacher-reported pupil concentration.

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
A. Reflecting Results 
Differing from the majority of the related work, the 
experiment was conducted over the long-term in a real school 
environment, and the IEQ parameters were not modified for 
the study. During the study, the overall IEQ was mainly within 
approved limits, except for the relative humidity, ambient 
lighting, and sound levels at times. This makes it difficult to 
reveal strong correlations between the IEQ and concentration. 
Our analysis indicates moderate negative correlation 
between relative humidity and pupil concentration across all 
the classrooms. That is, the lower relative humidity, the higher 
the concentration test score. The relative humidity exhibited 
variation outside the recommended target range of 30-40% 
showing a decreasing trend, which was due to the progressive 
heating of the buildings during the pilot. However, a drop in 
the relative humidity below the target range did not seem to 
reduce concentration. There were no clear, strong, and 
consistent relationships between other IEQ parameters and 
concentration. 
There were slight positive correlations between CO2 and 
pupil concentration, being significant in two classrooms. This 
indicates that a higher CO2 level was associated with better 
pupil concentration in those rooms. This is not in line with 
earlier studies implying that increased CO2 levels reduce 
performance [10]-[12]. However, the CO2 remained generally 
at good levels in all the classrooms during the study and no 
clear conclusion can be drawn based on these results. 
There were slight negative correlations between the 
ambient lighting and pupil concentration. This indicates that 
the higher luminosity is the weaker the pupil concentration. 
This could be explainable by variation in diurnal daylight and 
human vigilance variation. In the earlier hours, when the 
pupils are more alert, there is less natural light in the autumn. 
Later in the afternoon, the pupils become more tired and their 
concentration decreases even though there is more natural 
light. In addition, the location of the sensor was not optimized 
considering the lighting conditions, which might have caused 
some degree of error. 
There were negative correlations between temperature and 
pupil concentration in three classrooms, one of which was 
significant. In general, this indicates that higher temperatures 
and weaker pupil concentration are associated. This is in line 
with earlier studies [8]. However, in this pilot, the 
temperatures rise was moderate and did not rise above 22.9°C 
in any of the rooms during the pilot period. 
There was a significant positive correlation between the 
sound level and pupil concentration in one room. This means 
that the more noise there was during the preceding lesson the 
better the performance the pupils had in the concentration test. 
B. Concentration Task 
The paper-format concentration test itself was easy and 
short to administer. However, the digitization took a long time 
and was prone to mistakes. In the future, when all the pupils 
have smartphones or tablets, the test could be performed with 
a mobile device and the results would be natively in digital 
form. Electronic test would reduce the chance of mistakes 
both in the digitization process and in performing the test. If 
the test accepts only one correct number at a time, there would 
be no missing values in the number sequence as it often 
happened in the paper version. There was a slight learning 
effect on the pupil concentration throughout the pilot. Even 
though there was a two-week “training” period before the IEQ 
sensors were installed, the concentration test results kept 
improving slightly throughout the 18-week pilot.  
Both the pupils and the teachers liked the concentration 
test. It also benefitted teachers unexpectedly by offering 
perhaps the only silent moment during class hours in the day. 
C. Limitations of This Study  
The sampling rate for the MCF-LW12CO2 environmental 
sensor was infrequent, at only every 15 minutes. As a result, a 
single exceptional value can distort the average in the 45 
minutes epoch easily. By averaging the measurements before 
the concentration test, the longer-term exposure was taken 
into consideration. However, neither the variation range nor 
the trend in the IEQ parameters during the 45-minute period 
were analyzed. It is also uncertain whether the concentration 
test was performed exactly 45 minutes after a recess. If the 
first measurement took place during the recess, it would affect 
the average. Another uncertainty was caused by the MFC 
sensors’ IAQ index, which was based on a proprietary non-
open algorithm of the sensor manufacturer and may have 
±15% sensor-to-sensor deviation in values. Although the IAQ 
index can be mapped to a 7-step classification scale from very 
polluted to excellent, data interpretation is informal and 
indicative only without any precise action limits. However, 
the IAQ index was not shown to be of significant importance 
in our analyses. 
Even though the study was long-term (18 weeks), there 
were not enough samples to get significant results at these 
correlation levels. If the correlation was around 0.4 and a 
power of 0.75, then 26 samples would be enough, 
corresponding to 13 weeks at the current concentration test 
rate. However, if the correlation was around 0.3 and a power 
of 0.75, it would have required approximately 75 samples 
corresponding to 38 weeks. I.e., it would require collecting 
data for one whole school year if the tests were administered 
twice a week. In Northern Europe, changes in meteorological 
conditions and the building heating season have effects on 
indoor conditions, which also favors a full-year measurement. 
Although, the study could confirm only association 
between relative humidity and concentration, continuous 
monitoring of the IEQ is important because it enables the 
detection of adverse changes in the environment. It can also 
reveal smaller long-term changes that the humans might not 
detect as we adapt quickly to the prevailing conditions. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper presents a study on the associations between 
objective IEQ data and objective pupil concentration. The 
study deployed an environmental monitoring system for 
collecting objective IEQ data using commercial sensors. The 
system was utilized in a long-term experiment (18 weeks) in 
a real school environment, where the IEQ parameters were not 
arranged or modified for study purposes. During the study, the

overall IEQ was mainly within approved limits, except for the 
relative humidity, ambient lighting, and sound levels at times. 
The associations between objective IEQ measures and 
objective pupil concentration were analyzed. A statistically 
significant inverse association was found between the relative 
humidity and pupil concentration in all the classrooms. 
Correlations between other IEQ parameters and pupil 
concentration could not be confirmed. The performance of the 
pupils and students in varying IEQ requires further studies. It 
is recommended to have a longer pilot (e.g., one year), with 
concentration testing more than twice a week. Despite the 
challenges in measuring associations between IEQ factors and 
concentration, it is important to monitor indoor conditions to 
ensure the well-being of the children. Future work should also 
study the interaction between concentration, IEQ conditions 
and, e.g., cognitive factors. Several IEQ factors may cause a 
significant reduction in perceived work performance 
indirectly together with individual state factors, including 
motivation, alertness, focus etc. Thus, the interaction between 
the individual and indoor environment is a multifaceted topic.
