Abstract—The research and development of automated driving
are recently thriving, and a mechanism continues to progress
through which the car itself assumes the role of the driver.
However, when automated driving only uses information that is
collected by onboard sensors, no information on vehicles in the
intersecting lanes can be obtained from intersections where the
visibility is often bad and suffers from large potential blind spots.
This situation increases the risk of collisions. Since no information
can be obtained on blind spots until entering the intersection,
the vehicle must temporarily slow down to conﬁrm the safety
of the situation. To improve safety and efﬁciency, information
must be obtained for each vehicle and communicated with the
surrounding vehicles. In this research, we examine safety and
efﬁciency by comparing cases of automated vehicles with and
without communication when entering an intersection with poor
visibility. We evaluated with a simulator and identiﬁed safety and
efﬁciency effects when an automated vehicle uses communication
at an intersection that features poor visibility.

INTRODUCTION
The research and development of automated driving have
increased in recent years. A camera, laser radar, and milliwave
radar are mounted on an autonomous automated vehicle for
collecting peripheral information. Then the vehicle’s operation
is controlled using the surrounding environment information.
However, such in-vehicle sensors have drawbacks because
detection is impossible outside the range of the viewing angles,
and so avoiding collisions is difﬁcult at intersections that suffer
from poor visibility.
With Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication, blind spot
information can be acquired that the vehicle cannot see
directly. To operate safely using this information, research
on cooperative automated driving is being conducted. The
recognition rate near 300 m increases by sharing the host
vehicle ’s information and the sensor information using V2V
communication instead of automated driving that relies solely
on sensor information [1].
The level of automated driving techniques has already
been deﬁned by Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
international. Level 2 vehicles, in which the automated vehicle
partially controls the vehicle ’s operation, are beginning to
appear on the market. For example, when a vehicle predicts
an accident, it automatically brakes. This is not completely
automated driving; it just illustrates the scope of driving
support. In this research, we evaluate automated vehicles that
can operate such vehicles whose popularity is expected to
increase in the future. In this research, we determine the
safety criterion for passing through intersections when using
communication and compare cases with and without sharing
the surrounding information of a vehicle. Based on our results,
we evaluate the inﬂuence of shared communication on trafﬁc
efﬁciency and safety when passing through an intersection that
suffers from poor visibility.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
Section II details of problems at intersections with blind spots.
Section III details of the calculation method when vehicles pass
through the intersection. Section IV details the evaluation of
the proposal. Section V details the consideration obtained from
the evaluation results. Section VI details the conclusion.

PROBLEMS AT INTERSECTIONS WITH BLIND
SPOTS
Accidents at intersections with poor visibility are a prob-
lem. According to ofﬁcial police statistics of trafﬁc accident
occurrences, urban intersections are the most common place
for such accidents [2]. The number of accidents occurring
at Japanese urban intersections in 2016 is 208,404. Since
the number of accidents occurring at non-urban intersections
is 46,952, there are many accidents at urban intersections.
As shown in Figure 1, at intersections with poor visibility,
the blind spots are large. At such intersections, since the
probability of crossing collisions is high, drivers must pause
before entering intersections and pass through them only
after conﬁrming that they are safe. This action is necessary
regardless of the presence or absence of a vehicle in the
intersecting lane. If there is no vehicle in the intersecting lane,
the time required to conﬁrm safety becomes wasted as the
vehicle passes through the intersection. These situations and
decisions are identical for automated vehicles.

PROPOSAL
A. Outline
Whether vehicles passing through intersections will collide
with vehicles traveling from intersecting lanes must be veriﬁed.
When no communication is used and the vehicle enters an
intersection without trafﬁc lights, it pauses before entering
it and checks whether it might collide with a vehicle in the
intersecting lane. If no collision is imminent, it passes through
the intersection. At an intersection with trafﬁc lights, vehicles
run based on the signals. In this research, we evaluate passing
through intersections based on the premise that accurate posi-
tion information and speed information can be acquired using
V2V communication.
B. Precondition
We set the following preconditions:
1)
Automated vehicles can communicate with each
other.
2)
Communication loss is ignored.
3)
Position information error is ignored.
4)
Communication is shared every 0.1 seconds.
5)
The crossing lanes are blind spots and invisible.
C. TTC
As a criterion for passing through an intersection, we
use Time-To-Collision (TTC) [3]. As shown in Figure 2, the
position and speed of the following and preceding vehicles are
deﬁned as xf, vf, xp, and vp. If TTC is deﬁned as tc, it can
be expressed by (1):
tc = −xf − xp
vf − xp

D. TTC in This Research
However, since TTC is an index for vehicles in the same
lane, the formula must be converted into a calculation between
vehicles on crossing lanes. Each value at the intersection is
shown in Figure 3. Here, a vehicle on a non-priority road is
deﬁned as vehicle 1, and a vehicle on a priority road is deﬁned
as vehicle 2. We also deﬁne the distance to the center of the
intersection as x1 and x2, the speed as v1 and v2, the length
of the vehicle as lv, and the length within the intersection as
lw.
First, we calculate the time until vehicle 1 reaches the
intersection’s entrances. If this time is assumed to be t1, it can
be obtained by (2). The distance to the intersection ’s entrance
can be obtained by subtracting half of the intersection’s width
from its center distance:
t1 = x1 − lw
2
v1
(2)
Next, we calculated the time it takes for vehicle 1 to
completely pass through the intersection. If this time is deﬁned
as t2, it can be obtained by (3), and t2 is the time obtained
by adding t1 to the time required for vehicle 1 to travel the

total distance of the width of the roadway and the length of
the vehicle:
t2 = t1 + lw − lv
v1
(3)
Next, we calculate the position of vehicle 2 of time t1
and t2. Here the position during each time lapse is deﬁned as
x2,1, x2,2, obtained by (4) and (5):
x2,1 = x2 + v2t1
(4)
x2,2 = x2 + v2t2
(5)
The TTC value that is allowed when crossing an intersec-
tion is deﬁned as tttc, which determines whether the position
of vehicle 2 is dangerous when vehicle 1 passes through the
intersection. xi is the center position of the intersection. When
either (6) or (7) is satisﬁed, it is dangerous for vehicle 1 to
pass through the intersection, and passage is denied:
xi − lw
2 − v2tttc ≤ x2,1 ≤ xi + lw
2 + v2tttc + lv
(6)
xi − lw
2 − v2tttc ≤ x2,2 ≤ xi + lw
2 + v2tttc + lv
(7)
Vehicles that are not allowed to cross the intersection will
be stopped before they enter it.

EVALUATION
A. Simulator
Our evaluation uses Vissim [4], a microscopic multi-modal
trafﬁc ﬂow simulation software package developed by Planung
Transport Verkehr (PTV) AG in Karlsruhe, Germany, that can
extract such problems as congestion and the inﬂuence of road
construction. It can also visually conﬁrm a set simulation with
3D graphics.
Vissim also supports the Component Object Model (COM)
interface through which it can communicate with external
applications and scripts. Using this function, we can set input
data to Vissim and obtain output data from it. In this research,
we collected vehicle information from Vissim using Python 2
and calculated TTC.
B. When Only a Straight Traveling Vehicle is being Operated
In this section, we evaluate the case where the vehicle does
not make a left or a right turn and only moves forward toward
an intersection.

Figure 4. Trafﬁc light setting
1) Evaluation method: According to technical government
guidelines [5], the criterion for braking in automated braking
systems is a TTC of 1.4 seconds or less for passenger cars.
Therefore, we set the TTC value of this intersection ’s passing
criterion to 1.4 seconds and calculated the intersection passing
determination from the timing when the vehicle enters within
around 100 m of the intersection.
Table I details the setting. The intersection has one lane
on each side. One of the lanes in it is the priority road, and
the vehicle on the non-priority road determines the passing
through the intersection based on the TTC. The speed limit is
50 km/h.
We simulated two other models to measure the effect of
passing through the intersection using V2V communication.
The ﬁrst model does not communicate. The vehicle on
the non-priority road side pauses for 0.5 seconds to conﬁrm
the intersection ’s safety before entering it. If it is safe,
then it passes through the intersection. The safety criterion
is judged by whether the vehicle from the priority road side is
approaching within 100 m from the intersection.
In the second model, the vehicle does not communicate and
advances based on the intersection ’s trafﬁc light. The trafﬁc
light ’s cycle is shown in Figure 4. One cycle is set to 120
seconds: 2 minutes for the signal ’s total time, 1 seconds for
red, 56 seconds for green, and 3 seconds for yellow.
The third model measures a vehicle ’s travel time on a
1000-m non-priority road that includes an intersection. Travel
time refers to the time spent driving on a speciﬁed section.
2) Evaluation results: We conducted three different types
of evaluations and measured the travel times of the three
models in the above intersection.
In the ﬁrst evaluation, when the number of vehicles in
each lane was set to 500 vehicles/hour, we measured the travel

Figure 6. Travel time by number of vehicles
time required for a vehicle to travel 1000 meters on the non-
priority road side. As described above, 1.4 seconds is the safety
criterion used by TTC for calculating safe passage through
the intersection using communication (Figure 5). The traveling
time was short in the following order: the model using the
proposed method using communication, the model using the
trafﬁc light, and the model based on the determination of safety
by pausing.
In the second evaluation, the number of vehicles per hour
in each lane was increased in increments of 100. The result
is shown in Figure 6. The travel time when controlled by
signals did not signiﬁcantly affect the travel time in the number
of vehicles in the measured range. However, in the models
that did not use both communication and trafﬁc signals, the
traveling time increased as the number of vehicles increased.
When using communication, the travel time did not change
greatly from 100 vehicles per hour to 600 vehicles per hour.
But if the number of vehicles per hour increased to 700, the
travel time increased signiﬁcantly.
For the third evaluation, we measured the travel time every
0.2 seconds from 1.4 to 2.0 seconds for the TTC seconds
used for judging passage through the intersection using V2V
communication. For passenger vehicles and larger vehicles,
the distance from braking to actually stopping is different.
In the case of larger vehicles, operating the automated brake
system is desirable when the TTC is 1.6 seconds or less [6].
Therefore, we measured the travel time by changing the TTC
value (Figure 7). The higher the TTC value is, the higher is

C. At a T-junction
In this subsection, we evaluated when a vehicle on a non-
priority road makes a left or a right turn at a T-junction. As
a precondition, the vehicles on the priority road side must go
straight ahead. Vehicles are driven on the left‐hand side of
the road.
1) Evaluation method: The T-junction ’s shape is shown
in Figure 8. We can judge whether a left turn is possible by
checking the safety of one lane when turning left. However,
when turning right, the safety of both lanes must be checked,
and the conditions for passing through the intersection become
stricter than when turning left.
For the evaluation, we compared the proposed method ’s
model, a model that paused at the intersection, and a model
that obeyed the trafﬁc light. Pause and signal period settings
were evaluated with settings that resemble those in the previous
section. The simulation settings are shown in Table II. We
established an intersection 500 m from the point of the vehicle
and measured the travel time when the vehicle on the non-
priority road that makes a left or a right turn travels 1000 m.
Here the vehicle traveling on the non-priority road chooses left

or right turns with a 50 % probability. Then we measured the
travel time by the traveling direction.
2) Evaluation result: The evaluation result is shown in
Figure 9. The time to travel 1000 m for left turns is 79.1
seconds and the travel time for right turns is 86.8 seconds.
This result suggests that the safety criterion is more severe
and the travel time is longer when turning right than left.
D. At a Crossroad
Next, we evaluate when the vehicle on the non-priority road
side makes a left or a right turn or continues straight ahead
and travels on the crossroad. As a precondition, the vehicles
on the priority road side should go straight ahead. Vehicles are
again driven on the left‐hand side of the road.

Figure 11. Travel time of crossroad
1) Evaluation method: The shape of the crossroads is
shown in Figure 10. It is necessary to check the safety of one
lane when turning left, two lanes when going straight, and three
lanes when turning right. Thus, the safety criterion depends
on the traveling direction, and the criteria become stricter
in the order of left turn, straight run, and right turn. When
turning right, the traveling direction of the oncoming vehicle
must be conﬁrmed. However, when right-turn vehicles face
each other, no collision occurs in the intersection. Therefore,
in addition to the vehicle ’s speed and position information,
information of the traveling direction must be shared. Unlike
the other evaluations, the condition is set to share information
of traveling directions.
For our evaluation, we compared the following models:
our proposed method, one that paused before entering the
intersection, and one with trafﬁc lights. The pause settings
and the signal period settings are evaluated with settings that
resemble those used in the previous section. We established an
intersection 500 m from the vehicle and measured the travel
time at 1000 m. We assume that a vehicle on the non-priority
road side is selected with a probability of 70 % for straight
ahead, 20 % for a left turn, 10 % for a right turn, and measured
the travel time for each traveling direction.
2) Evaluation result: The evaluation result is shown in
Figure 11. The traveling time increased as the number of
lanes whose safety must be conﬁrmed also increased in the
crossroad.
V.
CONSIDERATION
A. When Only a Straight Traveling Vehicle is being Operated
From Figure 5, using V2V communication at an inter-
section where only straight-ahead vehicles run reduces the
travel time. Trafﬁc efﬁciency is deﬁned as the time to reach
a destination. With V2V communication, travel time was
reduced and efﬁciency was improved. TTC calculation veriﬁed
the collision delay time with the vehicle in the lane that
intersects when passing through the intersection and improved
safety more than without communication.
From Figure 6, the travel time of the models using V2V
communication is the shortest when the number of vehicles
per hour ranged from 100 to 600. However, the travel time
is longer than in the model with trafﬁc signals if the number
of generated vehicles increased to 700. A vehicle on a non-
priority road cannot cross the intersection because it runs
on the priority road without interruption. If a certain trafﬁc
70

volume is exceeded, negotiation is required at the intersection.
For example, one method is to yield at an intersection to a
vehicle that has stopped for a certain period before entering
an intersection.
According to the result in Figure 7, the travel time also
increases as the TTC value is increased. Although the risk of
collisions is reduced by widening the distance (that remains
safe) between vehicles, the travel time’s efﬁciency is degraded.
Therefore, safety and efﬁciency have a trade-off relationship.
The TTC needs to set a value that maximizes the efﬁciency
by ensuring a minimum level of safety.
B. For a T-junction
Considering the left or right turn of a vehicle on a non-
priority road, the travel time at a T-junction is shown in Figure
9. The traveling time for a right turn is about seven seconds
longer than for a left turn. The average travel time of left or
right turns is 83.0 seconds. The vehicle ’s average speed in
the 1000-m section is about 43.4 km/h, which is relatively
fast since the speed limit is 50 km/h. Our proposed method is
effective for trafﬁc efﬁciency at T-junctions.
C. In Case of Crossroad
Figure 11 shows that the traveling times increase as the
number of lanes whose safety must be conﬁrmed increases.
The average travel time of the proposed method is 84.1
seconds, meaning that the average speed of a vehicle in the
1000-m section is about 42.8 km/h. Since the speed limit is
50 km/h, this level is fast. In addition, the model ’s travel
time using trafﬁc signals is 93.1 seconds, and model ’s travel
time that pauses is 96.9 seconds. Since the travel time of the
proposed method is the shortest, it is effective for the trafﬁc
efﬁciency of crossroads.
VI.
CONCLUSION
In recent years, research on automated driving has been
increasing. The information that can be obtained by an auto-
mated vehicle as a single unit is limited, and it is impossible
to collect information on blind spots when viewed from the
vehicle. We must supplement the missing information by
sharing information with various objects. We veriﬁed the safety
and efﬁciency when using cooperative automated vehicles at an
intersection where the outlook is bad and blind spots are large.
With communication, the speed and position information of
vehicles around the intersection are acquired to judge whether
safe passage is possible.
Evaluation results showed that efﬁciency and safety were
improved more than the case of conﬁrming the safety of
passing through the intersection without communication when
it conﬁrms safe passage.
