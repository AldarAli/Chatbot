Abstract— A twin-T type notch filter ultra-thin hydrogen sensor 
has been developed to improve and control the sensitivity of the 
sensors. The ultra-thin platinum films were used as resistors of 
a twin-T notch filter, so the frequency properties of the filter 
change when the resistivity of the films changes by hydrogen gas 
exposer. Therefore, the amplitude of output signals depends on 
the operation frequency of the sensor. The change in the output 
signal of the fabricated sensor for 1%-hydrogen gas exposure 
was 2.9% at 1.19 kHz and 4.3% at 0.99 kHz. This result 
indicates that the sensitivity of the sensor could be electrically 
controlled by changing the operating frequency of the sensor.

 INTRODUCTION  
A large amount of greenhouse gas emission from using 
fossil fuels cause global warming. Progressing global 
warming is the serious problem because that leads to 
environmental destruction and abnormal weather. Therefore, 
renewable energy is attracting attention as a new energy souse 
to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas. Especially, hydrogen 
energy is expected because the energy has the high efficiency, 
and the supply of the energy is stable. However, hydrogen gas 
(H2) easily leaks and explodes, so the early detection of H2 
with hydrogen sensors is required for using hydrogen energy 
safely. Up to now, various types of hydrogen sensors, 
including a Catalytic-Combustion (CC) type, a Field-Effect 
Transistor (FET) type, and a Resistance Change (RC) type 
have been developed. A CC type sensor measures change in 
the temperature of a catalytic metal film, e.g., platinum (Pt) 
and palladium (Pd) by exposure to H2. Detection with a CC 
type sensor is less affected by ambient conditions such as 
temperature and humidity. However, a CC type sensor 
generally operates at high temperature comparing to the other 
types of sensors [1-2]. So, a CC type sensor requires higher 
energy consumption for warming the sensor by a heater. On 
the other hand, a FET type sensor can operate at lower 
temperature. This type of sensor does not require the warming 
by heater, so this type of sensor can operate with lower energy 
consumption. A FET type sensor measures change in the work 
function of the catalytic metal film fabricated on the gate 
electrode of FET. The FET type sensor has relatively high 
sensitivity. However, a FET type sensor requires complicated 
fabrication process in a clean room [3]. The RC type sensor 
consists of Pd thin films on a substrate, so the fabrication 
process is simpler than a FET type sensor. The volume of Pd 
increases by absorption of H2 into the Pd, and the resistance 
of the Pd changes. Thus, this type of sensor measures change 
in the resistance of Pd. However, the volume of Pd films 
change by absorption and dissociation of H2, so Pd films 
irreversibly degrade [4]. 
In our group, a Pt ultra-thin film hydrogen sensor has been 
proposed and developed [5-7]. Pt film does not absorb H2, so 
this type of sensor is more durable against H2. H2 is 
dissociated on the surface of Pt films, and electrons are 
injected into the films. Thus, the resistance of Pt films 
decreases while the resistivity of Pd films increases. The 
selectivity of similar sensor was measured at room 
temperature and reported elsewhere. This sensor could detect 
H2 with a concentration of above 0.1 % [8].

METHODOLOGY 
Figure 1 shows (a) the structure of the hydrogen sensor 
and (b) the equivalent circuit of twin-T. The Pt ultra-thin film 
hydrogen sensor had three layers of silicon, titanium nitride 
(TiN), and Pt. TiN and Pt were formed on a silicon substrate 
by the sputtering method. The thickness of TiN was 20 nm 
and that of Pt was 10 nm.  
In this study, the Pt ultra-thin films hydrogen sensors were 
integral ted into a twin-T type notch filter circuits as resistors. 
A twin-T circuit has the feature that the output signals reduce 
at a specific frequency (notch frequency). The notch 
frequency (𝑓𝑛) can be given by 
𝑓𝑛 =
1
2𝜋𝐶𝑅 ,
(1) 
where, C is capacity, and R is resistance. Like the ultra-thin 
films hydrogen sensors mentioned above, the resistance 
decreases with increasing the concentration of H2. Since the 
Pt films consists of resistive part of the circuit R, the notch 
frequency shifts by exposure to H2. Figure 2 shows the 
schematic illustration of the frequency dependence of the 
amplitude and phases before and after hydrogen exposure. 
The notch frequency slightly increases with the exposure. 
Thus, concentration of H2 could be measured by measuring 
the amplitude and/or phase of the output signals ( 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 ) 
operating at the frequency (𝑓𝑜 ≈ 𝑓𝑛). The sensitivity (𝑆) can 
be given by 
𝑆 = 𝑑𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡
𝑑𝑓 |
𝑓=𝑓𝑛

Because the sensitivity depends on the differential of the 
properties along with the frequency, the sensitivity of this type 
of sensor could be electrically controlled by changing the 
operation frequency.  
III. 
EXPRIMENTS AND RESULTS 
Figure 3 shows the change in the amplitude and phase of 
the output signals as time at 1.19 kHz which was the notch 
frequency of the circuit without hydrogen exposure. The 
sensor was exposed to gas balanced by 20%-oxygen and 80%-
nitrogen gas (Air) for 5 min and 1%-hydrogen gas of whose 
pressure balanced by 20%-oxygen and 80%-nitrogen gas to be 
1 atm for 5 min. The change in amplitude and phase were 
2.8 % and 4.8 deg. 
Figure 4 shows the change in the amplitude and phase of 
the output signals as a function of the operating frequency of 
the circuit when the sensor was exposed to 1%-hydrogen gas. 
The change rates depend on the operation frequencies and 
maximize at the frequency of 0.99 kHz and 1.19 kHz for the 
amplitude and the phase, respectively. The corresponding 
changing rates were 4.3% and 2.9%. This result clearly 
indicates that the sensitivity of the sensor could be electrically 
controlled by changing the operating frequency.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In our group, the ultra-thin Pt hydrogen sensor was 
developed using the twin-T circuit. The sensor could be 
electrically controlled by changing the operating frequency. 
The variation of sensor properties by the fabrication process 
can be reduced, therefore, a series of sensors with a uniform 
sensitivity can be realized.
