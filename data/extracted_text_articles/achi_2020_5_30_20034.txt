Abstract—Game development is a ﬁeld that has been con-
tinuously researched. The current state of the art of game
development has been applied in many ﬁelds, from education
to design research. This work has the objective of identifying,
evaluating, and interpreting published research that examines
how decision-making impacts the game development process.
To achieve that, a systematic review of current literature was
conducted. In this review, 36 works were identiﬁed as primary
studies. The studies were then classiﬁed according to research
focus and the use of game development the authors focused on.
The review investigates what it is known about the challenges and
opportunities in the use of decision-making in game development.
The results show data about game development, gaps in current
research and models of successful implementation.
Keywords—game development; decision-making; systematic re-
view.
I. INTRODUCTION
Before, software products usually were developed to solve a
problem or provide a service, whereas games were considered
a form of entertainment, with no inherent value or usefulness
beyond the scope of providing user experience [1]. Nowadays,
the video games industry is worth billions of dollars [3] and
the current state of the art of game development has been
applied in many ﬁelds like education [7][37], design research
[22], alleviating anxiety [38] and combating dementia [39].
However, to develop a game is simultaneously an advanced
software product and a complex work of creativity and art [2].
This merger of disciplines makes video game production an
interesting process to study from many different perspectives,
but it also poses several challenges for the game development
community.
This work is organized as follows: in Section II, we present
a brief discussion about the work theme: basic concepts of
game development and decision-making. Section III presents
the applied protocol to conduct this review. In Section IV, the
results of this review are shown. In Section V, the results are
discussed. In Section VI, we conclude this work.
II. GAME DEVELOPMENT AND DECISION-MAKING
Decision-making can affect the software development pro-
cess at every stage: from requirements analysis, to product
delivery, to the consumer. Although a game is a software,
its development process has more phases and involves more
stakeholders than commercial automation software, for ex-
ample. Because it has more phases and more stakeholders,
therefore, the game development process has more decisions
being made all the time.
Several papers cite how these decisions impact the game
development process. These works include: user experience
[16][23], gameplay [15], monetization models [35], project
and code quality [4][11][34], sales [9][21], social media [24]
and the gaming industry as a whole [1][13][25].
Seeking to understand how to optimize this decision-
making, researchers have been analyzing the game develop-
ment process using data on: gameplay [15][28][32], artiﬁcial
intelligence behavior [30], sales [9][21], rates game comple-
tion [30], among others.
III. APPLIED PROTOCOL
Our review methodology is composed of eight steps: (1)
development of the protocol, (2) deﬁnition of search questions
(3) deﬁnition of search questions, (4) identiﬁcation of inclusion
and exclusion criteria (5) search for relevant studies, (6) critical
assessment, (7) extraction of data, and (8) synthesis. The steps
applied to the study contained herein are presented below.
The objective of this review is to identify primary studies
that focus on game development process and the use of
decision-making. The following question helps identifying
primary studies:
• How does decision-making impact the game develop-
ment?
From this central question, other secondary questions were
developed to help in the comprehension of the problem:
• Which tools can be applied to evaluate the accuracy of
decision-making in game development?
• What are the opportunities and challenges in adopting of
decision-making in game development?
A. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
For this review, we considered studies that were published
starting from year 2017. The following studies were also
excluded:
• Studies not published in the English language;
• Studies that were unavailable online;
• Studies not based on research and that express only the
ofﬁcial opinions of governments and ﬁeld experts;
• Call for works, prefaces, conference annals, handouts,
summaries, panels, interviews and news reports.
B. Search Strategies
The databases considered in the study are in the list below:
• ACM Digital Library;
• IEEE Xplore;

• ScienceDirect – Elsevier.
Combinations of terms were created to guarantee that
relevant information would not be excluded when querying
different search engines and databases. As a result, three
search strings were created:
• String 1: “decision-making” AND “game development”
• String 2: “decision-making” AND “game development”
AND (tools OR evaluate)
• String 3: ”game development process”
We noted that to use the complementary string “and
decision-making” did not increase the results. In the process of
extracting information from the databases, the search strings
were used separately in each database. The searches were
performed in August 2019.
The results of each search were grouped together, according
to database and were, later, examined closer in order to identify
duplicity. Tables I - III show the number of studies found in
each database, with the string utilized in the search.

C. Studies Selection Process
This section describes the selection process from the be-
ginning, namely, from the initial search using the Search
Strategies described above to identiﬁcation of primary studies.
At the ﬁrst step, 261 works were found with the initial
research strings. Duplicated works were removed and, for title
analysis, 143 works were selected. After the title analysis, 75
works were selected for abstract analysis. In the end, 36 works
were selected based on the abstract analysis for full read. Table
IV presents the number of studies ﬁltered in each step of the
selection process.
D. Quality Assessment
In the quality assessment stage, works passed through a
critical analysis. In this stage, the complete studies were read
and analyzed, instead of only the titles or abstracts. After

this, the last studies that were considered uninteresting for
the review were eliminated, resulting in the ﬁnal set of works.
Six questions were used to help in the quality assessment.
Those questions helped determine the relevance, rigor, and
credibility of the work being analyzed. The questions were:
• Question 1: Does the study examine how decision-making
can improve the game development process?
• Question 2: Does the study present aspects related with
challenges or opportunities in adopting decision-making
in game development process?
• Question 3: Does the study present tools to evaluate
the accuracy of decision-making in game development
process?
• Question 4: Is the context of the study adequately de-
scribed?
• Question 5: Does the study contribute to research in game
development and decision-making?
• Question 6: Does the study contribute to research in game
development in any way?
Of the 75 studies that were analyzed in the quality assess-
ment stage, 36 passed to the stage of Data Extraction and
Synthesis and were thus considered the primary studies. The
quality assessment process will be presented in detail in the
result section, along with the assessment of the 36 remaining
studies.
IV. RESULTS
In this paper, 36 primary studies were identiﬁed [1] – [36].
Each one deals with on a wide array of research topics and
utilize a wide set of exploration models for each different
scenario.
According to the studies above, it was identiﬁed that are
opportunities to research decision-making in many phases of
game development process: user experience [16][23], game-
play [15], monetization models [35], project and code quality
[4][11][34], sales [9][21], social media [24], requirements
analysis [32] and the gaming industry as a whole [1][13][25].
A. Quantitative Analysis
The research process that was developed resulted in 36
primary studies. As Table V shows, they were written by 130
authors, linked to institutions based in 20 different countries,
distributed on ﬁve continents, and were published between
2017 and 2019.
In regards to the country of origin, most of the publica-
tions came from the United States of America, Netherlands,
Canada and Brazil (ﬁve publications), followed by Finland

(four works), Australia (three works), Arab Emirates, Pakistan,
Spain, Taiwan and the United Kingdom (two works). Each of
the other remaining countries had only one publication.
Figure 1 shows the percentage of participation of each
continent in the primary studies. The tag ”Global” is for the
studies with more than one country or continent involved in
the research.
Figure 1. Participation of each continent
The large number of countries that have publications on the
subject of game development and decision-making show how
widespread the topic is globally.
Table VI shows what type of research was conducted in the
primary studies. Figure 2 presents the percentage of each type
of research.
Figure 2. Type of research
B. Quality Analysis
As it was described in section D - Quality Assessment -
each of the primary studies was assessed according to six
quality criteria that relate to rigor and credibility as well as to
relevance. If considered as a whole, these six criteria provide
a trustworthiness measure to the conclusions that a particular
study can bring to the review. The classiﬁcation for each of
the criteria used a scale of positives and negatives.

Table VII presents the results of the evaluation. Each row
represents a primary work and the columns ’Q1’ to ’Q6’
represent the 6 criteria deﬁned by the questions used on quality
assessment: decision-making and game development, chal-
lenges and opportunities, tools to evaluate decision-making
impacts, context, contribution for decision-making and game
development, and contribution for game development in any
way, respectively. For each criteria, ’1’ represents the positive
answer and ’0’ the negative one.
All studies that were analyzed in this step had positive
answers for questions 1 and 2 because, as previously stated
in the research methodology part, these questions represent
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consequently, all studies with
negative answers to at least one of these criteria were already
removed during selection stage.
All studies that were analyzed provided information on
the context of the work and contributed in some way to
research game development. Only 17 of 36 studies answered
the question 3 about tools to evaluate accuracy of decision-
making in game development. The same fraction, 17 of 36
studies, obtained the maximum score (6) in quality analysis.

V. DISCUSSION
After the analysis and data extraction steps performed on
the primary works, it was possible to identify some aspects
related to how decision-making impacts the game development
process.
In the ﬁrst place, it is possible to conclude that decision-
making impacts all stages of game development process,
from requirements analysis to user experience, consequently
affecting game sales and industry survival. All primary works
were published after 2017, therefore, this research ﬁeld is very
active.
The systematic review also found it difﬁcult to ﬁnd open
data from the gaming industry, since some databases cited in
the articles (SteamDB and SteamSpy [21][29]) are Application
Programming Interfaces (API) that do data mining in the
Steam store.
In addition to keeping research on game development in
vogue, one of the advantages of the present work was to show
a well-documented and detailed research process, easy to be
replicated and tested.
As a disadvantage in relation to the researched works, we
noticed that there is no interaction with the developers as
well as the industry can hinder the results. However, we tried

to collect data directly from them at the beginning of this
work using social networks and other means of contact, which
unfortunately, did not result in a relevant amount of data.
This fact corroborates the statement about the difﬁculty of
collecting data from the gaming industry.
A. How decision-making is impacting game development?
This review illustrated that decision-making impacts every
stage of the game development process, as pros decision-
making can provide: improved performance, quality, sales and
user experience. The negative impacts are: to affect the artistic
spectrum of game development as it may limit the creative
process.
B. Which tools can be applied to evaluate the accuracy of
decision-making in game development?
In this review, it was noticed the lack of research about
the tools that have been applied to evaluate the accuracy of
decision-making in game development. Only 17 of 36 studies
showed or brieﬂy identiﬁed some type of tool. The identiﬁed
tools are: playtesting data, postmortem documents, Halstead
complexity measures; learning performance, conclusion of ac-
tivities performance, SteamSpy and SteamDB, game telemetry,

virtual reality, heat analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence behavior,
requirement analysis, tests analysis, project quality analysis
and monetization model analysis.
C. What are the opportunities and challenges in adopting of
cloud computing in decision-making tools?
The key decision-making challenge in the game develop-
ment process is to control the process to meet scope, time,
and budget, while not limiting the creative process and user
experience. One opportunity found in this review was the lack
of work addressing how to improve the game sequence de-
velopment process using decision-making during this process.
Also other opportunities were identiﬁed: artiﬁcial intelligence,
education, serious games, social media, lack of open data about
games and to analyze more games.
VI. CONCLUSION
The main objective of this work was to conduct a search
and analysis of the adoption of decision-making to improve
the game development process. To that goal, a systematic
review was conducted, brieﬂy analyzing 261 papers and deeply
analyzing 36 papers in order to discuss topics about the usage
of decision-making. During the analysis phase, it was realized
that the decision-making has been widely applied in many
steps of game development process.
As future works, we intend to conduct further studies related
to how game development companies and game developers
apply decision-making in game sequels development.
