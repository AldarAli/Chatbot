Abstract—Big-data-driven technology innovation management
and technology forecasting in engineering design represent a
new challenge that we have to cope with. Data mining
algorithms, technology evolution methods and technology
forecasting models desiderate theoretical breakthroughs and
practical innovations. In this paper, the future development
trend of technology is forecasted by analyzing engineering big
data. The influence of internal and external factors on the
evolution path of technology is researched. Hotspots and
frontier fields of current technical development are analyzed.
Based on technological innovation path and paradigm shift, we
explain the mechanism of technology evolution from multiple
perspectives, such as individual/group, short-term/long-term,
sudden-change/gradual-change. Technology forecasting and
results evaluating methods based on the multi-stage evolution
mechanism are proposed. The proposal helps enterprises
improve their ability to forecast technological development
trends of industries, as well as decision ability of technological
Research and Development (R&D) innovation.
Keywords-data mining; technology evolution; technological
paradigm shift; technology forecasting.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The fierce market competition has prompted enterprises,
which are engaged in product Research and Development
(R&D) and technology management, to continuously study
the entire process of technology evolution. A diversified and
forward-looking technology development layout is proposed
for R&D, design and manufacture of the next generation
products [1]. However, in the face of massive, real-time,
multi-source, heterogeneous engineering knowledge creation
and technological paradigm shift records, the challenges are
how to make technical knowledge managers and design
innovators to: in-depth grasp the rules of engineering
technology innovation, comprehensively have an insight into
development trends of engineering fields, and systematically
plan strategies of engineering product innovation [2]. These
challenges have been the basic and urgent work of product
development and decision-making management.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 1,
the background and significance of this topic are introduced.
In Section 2, related works about technology forecasting are
investigated and summarized. In Section 3, a forecasting
model of technical evolution is proposed, considering both
the technology supply side and the social demand side. Also,
technology forecasting framework for engineering big data is
proposed. In Section 4, the advantages and disadvantages of
the methods mentioned in this paper are summarized, as well
as the direction of future work.

RELATED WORKS OF TECHNOLOGY FORECASTING
Technology forecasting began with the US Department of
Defense in 1950s, aiming at predicting military technology.
Technology forecasting is a method that continuously
observes and researches current and future development
trends of technology, and evaluates the potential and
development
prospects
of
the
technology
in
future
application fields, then provides decision-makers with in-
depth decision support [3]. Previous research has been based
on the Technology Road Mapping Model (TRM) [4][5],

Most
scholars
qualitatively
developed
TRM-based
forecasting standards and schemes [11][12], following the
first proposed structural TRM model by Phaal et al. [13].
Press, subject category, author, country and keywords of
academic journals are mainly analyzed by bibliometrics,
especially the common analysis based on word frequency
and citation. Sinha [14], Liu et al. [15], Wang et al. [16] have
analyzed and explored the long-term development profiles
and principles through bibliometrics studies in fields of
biology, medicine and environment.
With the promotion and application of patent information
analysis,
many
scholars
have
performed
technology
forecasting by information science. Mi [17] forecasts the
technological development prospects for the laptop industry
using information from the past 10 years by patent
information analysis method, in order to provide reasonable
decision for the strategic layout of patents.
Complex network analysis has also been used to mine
hotspots and track research trends in recent years. This
method mainly analyzes key co-words, co-introduction, co-
authoring and their relationships in published papers by
evaluation indexes of a complex network, to identify frontier
topics and forecast technological development trends [18].
This method often combines with traditional methods. For
example, Zhang et al. [19] establish a forecasting model of
technological topics combined with the TRM and the
bibliometrics, based on a complex network. Cheng et al. [20]
combine traditional bibliometrics with anomaly testing
methods of a network. An anomaly event detection model
was proposed to explore the development trends in social
computing fields.
The characteristics of the above technology forecasting
methods are summarized in Table 1. However, there are
some shortcomings in the existing researches because
existing technology roadmapping needs to consult a large
number of literature works in a specific field and the process
is
time
consuming.
Bibliometric
measurement
and
information analysis focus on quantitative descriptions of
statistics. Only the "explicit" statistical knowledge can be
obtained
and
it
is
difficult
to
identify
the
potential
development trend. Complex network analysis pays much
attention to relationships between research variables, and
thus it cannot consider particularities of variables. On the
other hand, the researches worked by Fye et al. [21] have
shown that the accuracy of technology forecasting for short-
term (1-5 years) and medium-term (6-10 years) is about 38-
39%, while that for long-term (11 years and above) is only
14%. However, there are few studies on “accuracy of
technology forecasting”. There are few papers to retrospect
and evaluate accuracy for their models of technology
forecasting [22]. Most accuracy evaluations of forecasting
are for commercial and medical fields. The evaluation
system based on engineering/scientific technology is more
limited.
Previous studies in this field [23]-[25] only focus on two
highly structured data sources: technology patents and
journals. Their methods of technology forecasting are limited
to qualitative or semi-quantitative research (such as Gartner's
Hype
Cycle
[26]),
without
considering
the
inherent
mechanism of technology development, such as individual/
group,
short-term/
long-term,
sudden-change/
gradual-
change. Also, these works seldom consider the impact of
external social environment and internal user needs on
technological paradigm shift. As a result, the accuracy and
reliability of existing models are insufficient. Therefore, in
big data environment, we propose a novel forecasting model
of technological development trend, which considers both
external market demand and internal technology evolution
law. In addition, we propose an algorithm framework of
technology forecasting based on "Technical Knowledge
Evolution-Technological Paradigm Transition-Technological
System
Revolution".
It
integrates
Natural
Language
Processing (NLP), semantic network analysis, text meta-
analysis, and deep learning algorithm into the framework.
The proposal improves accuracy and validity of forecasting
results and provides new ideas for the research in this field.

features and new forms that are different from previous
single areas, single audiences, single dynamics and single
models. This paper exploits and analyzes in depth massive
multi-source heterogeneous engineering big data with multi-
view,
multi-temporal,
multi-dimensional
and
multi-
granularity, as shown in Figure 1. Our method integrates a
variety of advanced text mining methods, such as natural
language processing, ontology modeling, semantic network,
semantic similarity evaluation, etc. Different sources and
different structures engineering text, such as technical
patents,
journal
articles,
empirical
case
documents,
professional Q&A forums are fully considered. Data mining
and semantic analysis algorithms for engineering big data are
developed and improved. Technical knowledge in massive
multi-source heterogeneous data is automatically extracted.
The engineering semantics is expressed in the form of multi-
attribute. It is convenient for computer system to process
knowledge automatically.
B.
Technology forecasting based on the framework of
"Technical Knowledge Evolution-Technological
Paradigm Shift-Technological System Revolution"
Patterns, potentials and rates of technology hotspots are
evaluated with focus on the future trend of technological
paradigm
development,
based
on
the
framework
of
"Technical Knowledge Evolution-Technological Paradigm
Shift-Technological System Revolution". Multiple technical
routes
and
their
possibilities
within
the
limits
of
technological evolution are forecasted. Considering the
micro-breakthroughs, macro-continuation and multi-domain
cross-impact features of engineering product technological
paradigm shifts, the key characteristics at different stages are
extracted, and branch sets of technological evolution are
created. This paper objectively and quantitatively describes
future possible scenarios of technology developments from
aspects of formation conditions, classification and potential
estimation of the branches. Based on historical data of
technology developments, technologies in different lifecycles
and prospects are tracked from the perspective of technology
supply side and social demand side. The technology
forecasting model and the estimating method for forecasting
results are constructed based on a multi-stage technology
evolution mechanism. This provides theoretical guidance and
method support for technological management decision-
making in the field of big data-driven engineering.
C.
Forecasting model of technological paradigm shift for
technology supply side and social demand side
With the rapid development of technology in current
hotspots,
technological
paradigm
shifts
present
characteristics of micro-breakthrough, macro-continuation,
and multi-domain intersection. Enterprises and governments
need to
grasp the technological development context.
Previous subjective, one-sided, qualitative analysis is no
longer satisfied technology forecasting. As shown in Figure
2, in this paper, we use a deep learning algorithm called
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), which can effectively
take advantage of historical data. A technology forecasting
model considering both the technology supply side and the
social demand side is constructed, by means of regression
analysis and multi-domain text meta-analysis. The training
set is composed of the data in the entire time series of the
technological paradigm transition and the testing set is
composed of branch the data sets of the technological
evolution. Our approach improves the ability of LSTM cells
to process information by the improved "gate structure" and
enhance the long-term memory ability of the forecasting
model. Through the modified items of the assessment model
of technological maturity, the forecasting algorithm adopts
different
optimization
strategies
at different
stages of
technological evolution. By decomposing the branch set of
technological evolution, the evolution of each technological
subsystem is researched and the process of model training is
accelerated.
Both
the
technology
supply
side
(basic
theoretical accumulation, bottleneck breakthrough, mature
technical diffusion, etc.) and
the social demand
side
(potential user demand, regional market layout, industrial
macro-policy, etc.) are considered. Technological forecasting

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
Previous
technology
forecasting
methods based
on
technology hype cycle just consider the external market
demand.
However,
we
propose
a
novel
technology
forecasting model, which considers both the external market
demand and the internal technology evolution law. In this
paper, we propose an algorithm framework of technology
forecasting based on "Technical Knowledge Evolution-
Technological Paradigm Transition-Technological System
Revolution". It unifies natural language processing and deep
learning in the algorithm framework. The proposal improves
the accuracy and validity of forecasting results and provides
new ideas for the research in this field. Our research group is
carrying out a case study of the algorithm framework of
technology forecasting. Some results have been obtained and
the experimental results will be published later. In addition,
we will compare the proposed model with other models,
emphasizing the importance of the proposed technology
forecasting methods and expanding this paper.
In big-data driven engineering product innovation, the
development
routes
of
technical
knowledge
and
technological paradigm are affected by individual user
preferences, R&D team habits, technical field consensus and
industrial value concepts. This influence is sometimes
abnormal or anomalous. The complexity and variability of
knowledge evolution have brought great difficulties to
technology forecasting. In this regard, big-data driven
technology
innovation
management
and
prediction
of
engineering products must complete three tasks, namely:
aggregating and mining the technological knowledge from
multi-dimensional
and
multi-granularity
perspectives,
modeling and analyzing for technological innovations from
multi-temporal and multi-modal perspectives, and observing
and forecasting technological paradigms shift from multi-
domains and multi-perspectives.
