Abstract— The development of linear construction projects, 
such as roads, railways, gas pipelines and electricity 
installations among others, whose execution on the territory 
impact a number of real estates, implies calculation of the 
effects over the plots in order to rewards landowners in terms 
for the influence of these new constructions on their properties 
as the case of Assets and Rights. This paper is about the high 
voltage electrical installations projects, focussed on the 
optimization GeoProcessing workflow for the generation of 
affected Assets and Rights Reports (ARR) for landowners due 
to the impact of affections for building electrical installations. 
This calculation and the generation of reports are carried out 
in different stages, requiring geoprocessing of different types of 
electrical constructions affections over the land, whose data 
come from different local and remote (Web services) sources. 
These overall characteristics make the process complex, time-
consuming and requiring many resources. This paper shows 
the study case of the Integrated Geoprocessing for calculation 
of the affected ARR as a result of the new electrical conveyance 
infrastructures in Spain. The challenge consists of complying 
with the planning objectives as defined by the Ministry of 
Industry, Tourism and Trade (MITYC) for 2016, and reviewed 
for 2020, which implies the new creation of circuits and 
substations. In order to assisting in the accomplishment of 
those objectives and with the purpose of automating part of 
that workflow, an application software has been developed that 
integrates parts of the stages of that flow. The integrated stages 
are: (a) encoding of the plots susceptible to be affected; (b) 
calculation (geoprocessing) capable of processing 15 types of 
affections; (c) generation of an alphanumerical report with 
information about the owners of the affected plots and the 
ARR; (d) storage and Internet publishing of the affections 
caused by the projects through OGC Web Services and an ISO 
TC211 standard-based server for result dissemination in other 
formats. Up to five different data sources (two local, three 
remote) may come into play. The use of this application in the 
creation of the ARR has allowed improving productivity by 
optimising the amount of ARR generated per annum, the 
amount of calculated affections, the reliability of the 
calculations and the terms, thus reducing the cost of this 
activity.

INTRODUCTION 
The development of linear construction projects whose 
execution on the territory touches a number of real estates 
implies calculation of the effects over the plots in order to 
rewards landowners in terms for the influence of these new 
constructions on their properties as the case of Assets and 
Rights. This paper is about the high voltage electrical 
installations 
projects, 
focussed 
on 
the 
optimization 
GeoProcessing workflow for the generation of affected 
Assets and Rights Reports (ARR) for landowners due to the 
impact of affections for building electrical installations; 
examples are the constructions of streets/roads [1], railways 
[2], gas pipelines [3], and electrical installations [4]. Spanish 
Electrical Network (REE) is the private/public company in 
charge of the maintenance and construction of the high 
voltage distribution network in all over Spain, which is also 
responsible for the calculation of affections and the ARR 
derived from the electrical installations. This calculation and 
the generation of reports are carried out in different stages, 
requiring geoprocessing of different types of electrical 
constructions affections over the land, whose data come from 
different local and remote (Web services) sources. These 
overall characteristics make the process complex, time-
consuming and requiring many resources. This paper shows 
the study case of the Integrated Geoprocessing for 
calculation of the affected ARR as a result of the new 
electrical conveyance infrastructures in Spain. 
REE owns the entire high voltage electricity network on 
the Spanish territory; it is also the operator of the conveyance 
system, responsible for the management, development, 
extension, maintenance and improvement of the network [5]. 
Fig. 1 shows both the present state of the high voltage 
network and the planning for 2016 on the Spanish peninsular 
territory.  
The dimensions of the Spanish high voltage electricity 
network (up to 2010) are: 35,875 Km of electrical circuits 
[6], with approximately 70,000 electricity pylons and 450 
substations [6][7]. The planning worked out on May 2008 by 
the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade (MITYC) [8], 
whose objective is looking ahead to the future energy needs 
based on the increment of the demand experienced in recent 
years [6] that allows an estimation for 2016 of approximately 
15,000 Km of circuits, 35,000 new electricity pylons and 200 
new substations [9].  
A. Background 
The conventional method to calculate the affections 
caused by the high voltage electrical installations of REE and 
the generation of the ARR involved the use of different 
programmes and the manual execution of several tasks, 
partially automated in each stage of the process.

Figure 1.  High voltage electrical energy distribution throughout the 
Spanish peninsular territory (adapted from [10]). 
Stage 1 consisted of manual encoding of the plots likely 
to be affected by a new installation. Stage 2 consisted of the 
calculation of only four types of affections over the plots. In 
this stage, an AutoCAD script was used to calculate the 
affection due to the flight area of the high voltage electrical 
cable produced for the wind influence, the other three 
affections (felling area, permanent occupation due to the 
electrical installation infrastructures, and flight linear length 
of the high voltage electrical cable) were calculated 
manually. The script showed a dialogue window that 
visualised the value of the area affected by the overhead 
easement as a plot was selected. That value was used in stage 
3: generation of the ARR in alphanumerical format as the 
values identifying the plot and the affected surface were 
being registered. This calculation method was useful for the 
REE until 2008. If we consider 250 the average amount of 
plots that may be affected by a new electrical line of 50 Km 
length and four the possible types of affections that may exist 
at present, the time needed to carry out these iterative 
processes 
with 
the 
traditional 
method 
would 
be 
approximately 200 hours.  
B. Motivating Scenario 
The ambitious planning of the MITYC for the electrical 
sector [8][9] and the traditional way of carrying out the 
calculation of affections and the subsequent generation of the 
ARR allow identifying the following critical points in the 
processes: (1) need of producing more ARR in less time, (2) 
excessive duration of the process (200 hours in our 
example), (3) high cost of data preparation for each 
programme, (4) questionable reliability of data transfer 
between programmes without fully automated procedures, 
and (5) variety of affection types to be managed (up to 15). 
These five critical points warrant the design of a working 
methodology and the creation of a software application tool 
supporting optimisation of the processes of calculation of the 
affections and generation of the ARR through automating of 
the largest part of the workflow. The software application 
called RBD-MercatorREE has been developed so that it will 
implement the identified requirements to face the challenges 
of the new planning, integrating and automating the 
workflow. The integrated stages are: (a) encoding of the 
plots 
susceptible 
to 
be 
affected, 
(b) 
calculation 
(geoprocessing) of up to 15 possible types of affections, (c) 
generation of an alphanumerical report with owners’ 
information and the ARR of affected properties, and (d) 
storage of the history of the affections on a server with 
geospatial 
standards 
(ISO-OGC) 
[11] 
for 
results 
dissemination in other formats. Five data sources (two local, 
3 remote – Web services) may come into play along the 
process.  
II. CALCULATION OF AFFECTIONS AND ARR GENERATION: 
PROCESSES AND INFORMATION CHARACTERISATION  
The processes and data needed for the development and 
maintenance of high voltage electrical installations share 
generic characteristics with other types of lineal construction 
projects and infrastructures [12]. Some of the shared 
characteristics are: (1) affected properties on the territory, 
this fact implies the second characteristic, (2) the use of 
cadastral information, (3) one or more areas of direct 
affections on the plots by the elements to be built, and (4) 
one or more indirect affections on the plots by pathways 
which will allow access of the needed mechanical means for 
building and for future maintenance.  
The source/destination of the information to calculate the 
affections and ARR involves several agencies. Table 1 
resumes the actors involved in the workflow; the relationship 
between them are shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 2.  Relationship between actors involved in the calculation of 
affections and the generation of ARR 
In Table 1, the main source column indicates a 
classification of actors corresponding to REE departments, 
the government agencies (GOV), and the non-governmental 
agents external to the REE (NGOV).  
The relationship between actors is the following: DMA 
and DIL interact to define the passageways and alignments 
of the new installation, with the CTC carrying out the field 
revisions (links 1 and 2 in Fig. 2). This information is then 
used by the CTO to get the cadastral data from SEC-CA 
(links 3 and 4 in Fig. 2) and they encode the plots likely to be 
affected. With the cadastral cartography, DIL and DMA 
define the distribution of the electricity pylons (link 5 in Fig. 
2) so that DIL will subsequently define and calculate the 
affections due to the influence of the trace (link 6 in Fig. 2) 
and DMA, interacting with CMA, will define and calculate 
the affections due to accesses (link 7 in Fig. 2) to the 
installation for building and future maintenance. After the 
affections have been calculated by DIL and DMA 
respectively, the protected information of the owners of the 
affected plots is retrieved from the SEC-PR (link 8 in Fig. 2), 
regardless of the type of affection. With the protected 
information, an alphanumerical ARR draft is generated (link 
9 in Fig. 2), used by DTR to process and generate the final 
ARR. This report is then submitted to GOV for approval and 
publishing on the BOE and media (link 10). Simultaneously 
the information of the affections and all their geographic 
components are submitted to REE/UPM for OGC-standard-
based web publishing (link 10.b in Fig. 2) which allows 
alternative publication as maps; at the same time the 
geometric history of the affections is saved for future access 
by the general public (link 10.c in Fig. 2). 
The information exchanged by the players may be 
characterised as follows: 
A. Based on its format 
The fact of having several actors involved in all the ARR 
process implies having to deal with heterogeneous data 
formats. Five groups of formats are identified as follows: (1) 
twenty one GIS layers, (2) at least one XML protected file 
with the landowners information, the land price and more 
private data for each project that will be processed, (3) one 
alphanumerical 
database 
(DB) 
of 
provinces 
and 
municipalities (all of them are necessary input data for the 
processes). All of these three data formats are used as input 
for the ARR process. As part of the output data, there are 
sixteen more GIS layers containing information about the 
affected surfaces on the plots, and the next two data formats: 
(4) several spreadsheets files, containing the assets and rights 
report (prior to its publication on the BOE and pertinent 
media), and (5) a set of geospatial Web services (OGC) for 
storage and publishing over Internet all the historical ARR 
projects and its results, such as the graphic reviews of the 
affected plots, the pieces of geometric calculations and so on, 
all the different kind of produced output. Table 1 shows the 
different data formats and its main characteristics.  
B. Based on its purpose 
a) Plots: It represents the real estates involved in each 
electrical installation project. The encoding that identifies 
ordinally each plot, according to the direction of the 
electrical trace and accesses, are registered in addition to the 
values of the surface calculated for each type of affection. 
This information is generally obtained from the Cadastre 
through its SEC [13]. 
b) Layers with the affections: REE carries out studies 
for every new electrical installation project to take decisions 
and to process the information by affections. The data may 
be categorised according to affection on the ground as 
follows: (a) intangible affections, e.g. area affected by the 
flight of the high voltage electrical cable due to the wind 
influence, (b) tangible affections, e.g. area of permanent 
occupation by each electricity pylon. On the basis of their 
attributes, the data may be categorised: (c) with codes, e.g. 
every electricity pylon has an identification code, (d) 
without a code, e.g. area affected by tubing. According to 
the type of their geometry, the data may be: (e) polygons, 
and (f) lines.

Improving the number of affections that may influence 
plots from four to fifteen was one important issue in order to 
accomplish the MITYC requirements. In the previous 
working way it was infeasible to work with more than 3 
manually made affections. These 15 affections are: (1) aerial 
trace (superficial electrical cable generally suspended 
between pylons), (2) underground trace (part of the electrical 
cable is buried), (3) flight (safety area represented by the 
possible maximum movement of the electrical cable due to 
the influence of wind with a velocity of 120 Km/h 
perpendicular to the axis of the electrical line), (4) tube 
(representing the vertical projection of the cables on the 
ground with wind of 0 Km/h), (5) Felling (area that should 
be felled around the trace for safety purposes), (6) permanent 
occupation area (area occupied by the pylons), (7) permanent 
underground occupation (surface the underground power line 
will occupy permanently), (8) temporary occupation area 
(needed area for the building of the electricity pylons and 
other materials), (9) temporary underground occupation 
(needed occupied surface for underground electric wiring), 
(10) splicing chamber (area occupied permanently by 
concrete boxes where cable splicing is carried out), (11) 
telecommunication boxes (surface permanently occupied by 
the boxes used for telecommunication equipment associated 
to underground cable for remote maneuvering of the line), 
(12) landmarks (surface occupied by concrete posts in place 
to indicate on the surface the underground channelling of 
electrical cables), (13) accesses (easement needed for access 
from 
the 
electrical 
installations 
for 
building 
and 
maintenance), (14) auxiliary 1 and (15) auxiliary 2 (two 
generic affections available in the future if needed).  
c) Layers for encoding: There is a dataset that helps in 
the encoding of the project plots; these must be identified 
for future field calls. These layers are: encoding trace; 
access to the pylons; buffer by trace; buffer for access and 
supports. This information is worked out by the REE.  
d) Landowners data: Information such as address or 
identity card is protected as a part of the real estate register 
system. It is obtained from the Cadastre through its SEC 
[13]. This service requires users to identify themselves and 
to have the appropriate privileges to obtain this information.  
e) History of affections: The geographic information of 
the polygons included in a project concerning the ARR 
(affections and cadastral plots) is duly saved into a server 
compliant with the standards of an SDI by using Web Map 
Services (WMS) [17] and WFS-T [18].  
III. 
APROACH 
A. Workflow automation and Integrated Geoprocessing  
Some of the processes to calculate the affections and 
ARR generation such as the field calls for definition of 
alignments by passageways or the creation of traces and 
affection polygons are not in the first instance susceptible to 
be automated in this context. However, other parts of the 
processes does allow being optimised by automation and the 
creation of a new workflow; such is the case for the 
following four processes: (1) encoding of the plots, (2) 
process of calculation of up to 15 types of affections on the 
plots, (3) generation of the ARR combining the plots with 
their affections and the owners’ protected information, and 
(4) saving of the history of affections and its publishing on 
the Internet by means of SDI standards. 
Fig. 3 shows every one of the above-mentioned four 
processes following a gear metaphor. This figure is made up 
of three rows and four columns and represents the automated 
workflow. In each column is shown the name of the 
automated process, the needed input data to carry out the 
process and an output are graphically exemplified 
underneath. Next we describe each process (columns) 
briefly. 
a) Plot encoding: This part of the workflow is 
comprised of seven GIS layers, one for the parcels and the 
other six for encoding. All parcels intersecting with the 
buffers of influences by affections are encoded; encoding 
consists of assignment of an identification value to each plot 
likely to be affected by a new installation, taking into 
account the direction of advancement of the trace 
(numbered with integers); at the intersections with the 
accesses, the access path is followed (numbered with 
decimal values). To reach this requirement, techniques and 
software libraries are used for the handling of the linear 
reference systems. The output is the same layer of plots to 
which a new attribute for encoding and its values is added. 
b) Calculation of affections: This part of the workflow 
consists of 16 GIS layers, i.e. the plot layer and up to 15 
layers of affections. The process carries out integrated 
geoprocessing on the parcel geometries as a function of the 
affections, taking into account the codes identifying them. 
The geoprocessing operations realised are: aggregation by 
attributes, intersections and clipping among others. As the 
software application carries out the operations, the areas and 
perimeters are calculated for each type of affection and 
saved on the same plot layer which again serves as the 
output of this process.  
c) Generation of the assets and rights report: This part 
of the workflow uses two input data, the plot layer with all 
the values of the affections for each plot and an XML file 
with the protected information of the affected plot owners. 
The process combines the two data sources and generates an 
ARR output as a spreadsheet. This is the initial document to 
be reviewed by the Department of Handling before being 
submitted to the Administrations for its publication on the 
BOE and other media. 
d) Saving and SDI publishing of historical data: The 
plot with all its affection values as well as the geometric 
details of each affection are saved in an SDI standard-
complying server. Data are converted to the interchange 
Geography Markup Language (GML) format [19][20] and 
they are submitted through transactional operations to the 
server which implements the WFS-T. Once stored in this 
server, they may be queried in a standard fashion by using 
the WMS and WFS services.

B. System architecture and design  
The RBD-MercatorREE software application tool has 
been designed following the principles of object-oriented 
programming. This has allowed defining the objects that 
recap the necessary logic to comply with the software 
requirements and functionalities. The definition of those 
objects (aka business logic) allowed dividing the software 
into 3 uncoupled layers as independent and interrelated 
projects: (1) business objects, (2) user interface, and (3) 
remote persistence server. Fig. 4 shows the entire RBD-
MercatorREE software application as a blue rectangle 
containing three gray rectangles inside. Every one 
represents a software logic layer (the upper rectangle is the 
desktop user interface, the central rectangle is the business 
logic layer and the lower rectangle represents the 
persistence layer). The dark blue circles on the central 
rectangle represent the main business objects making up the 
software; the sky blue circles of the rectangle on top 
represent forms and controls typical of a desktop user 
interface that instance the business objects. Fig. 4 also 
shows an overview of the system architecture for the 
integrated geoprocessing through the RBD-MercatorREE 
software application. Six rectangular areas are shown 
representing the involved players. The upper left rectangle 
represents the REE and its departments, with access to all 
the software functionalities. The upper right rectangle 
represents the remote server REE/UPM, used for storage of 
the affections; access to it is achieved from the software 
persistence layer through WFS-T, GML, XML and HTTP. 
The two lower left rectangles with the CMA, CTC and CTO 
labels represent the consulting firms that realise and process 
cartography for the REE; the circles 1 and 2 inside indicate 
that they have access to the option of plot encoding and 
calculation of affections through the local installation of the 
software. The lower central rectangle –under the Internet 
cloud– represents SEC and its different ways of access to 
the cadastral data (WFS, Web app and Web service).  
The lower right rectangle represents the general public 
who can access the affections and assets and rights reports 
(ARR) published by REE/UPM conformant with SDI 
standards and Web applications. 
C. Technical Resources 
The RBD-MercatorREE software application has been 
developed using C# as programming language and .NET 4.0 
[21]. The basic spatial operations have been carried out with 
the ArcObjects libraries for ArcGIS of ESRI [22]. The 
server for storage and publication conformant with SDI 
standards of historical data of affections and ARR is 
GeoServer 2.0.2 [23]. The XML encoding of the WFS-T 
requests Insert/Delete, etc. as well as the conversion of the 
data to GML format and the communication with the server 
through HTTP have been entirely carried out with the .NET 
basic libraries for C#.

IV. RESULTS 
The possibility of obtaining the current cadastral 
cartography and the protected data of the affected parcels 
quickly and reliably as well as linking these to the data of 
each project, measuring the affection of the new installation 
on the territory automatically, has meant for REE the 
shortening of terms –in some processes over 90% reduction; 
in addition, it is possible now to count on the reliability of 
the published information, i. e. the official information 
managed by the Ministry of Economy and the Treasury. 
In view of this advance, the departments involved in the 
technical drafting of projects, have established a line of work 
whose information flow is quick and smooth, avoiding the 
choke points that occurred with the old procedures. This fact 
brings about an increased capability of technical drafting of 
projects; it also makes it easier to comply with the planning 
approved by the MITYC on May 2008. 
This positive impact on the run times is reflected on Fig. 
5 where a chronogram represents the average project 
timescales of a project of a 50 Km long electrical line.  
Fig. 5(a) shows the times according to the old procedures 
and Fig. 5(b) according to the new line of work. By 
comparing both figures it appears that the project activity 
represented by the yellow bar has been shortened 
considerably. This reduction represents about 40%, the 
engineering activity has been reduced in 20% and the largest 
optimisation corresponds to the ARR, with more than 90% 
reduction. 
The availability of digital geographic information 
together with the analysis and optimisation of the workflow 
have been the key elements in the improvement of the 
methodologies. In the second place, automation of the 
processes has allowed a reduction in the terms and costs and 
an increase in the reliability of the results and consequently 
an improvement in the efficiency and productivity of the 
technicians. Thus we can present the following comparative 
Table with the conventional methodology and with the 
developed tools that automate the new methodology put in 
place.

V.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The use of the RBD-MercatorREE software application 
that automates the workflow processes for the calculation of 
affections 
and 
generation 
of 
ARR 
and 
integrates 
geoprocessing, has improved process productivity optimising 
the following variables: number of ARR generated per 
annum, number of calculated affections, reliability of the 
calculations, terms for completion and consequently 
reduction in the costs of this activity.  
Characterisation of the data has allowed us determining 
that the affections present well defined patterns (lines, 
polygons, affections without/with codes). These patterns will 
enable us to develop a new software version that might be 
personalised for another type of linear construction project 
such as gas pipelines, roads, railways, etc., thus generalising 
the developed solution.  
Presently and since the Cadastre through its SEC allows 
the users identified with a digital certificate to download 
non-protected cadastral data, it is possible to automate other 
aspects of the workflow such as downloading of cadastral 
cartography. Likewise the protected information of the plots 
can also be automated since it is electronically accessible for 
registered, identified users.  
Advances are being achieved in the cartographic 
representation that will afford a better insight into the 
connivance of a new installation with the environment. On 
the one hand it will provide the technicians with an accurate 
tool for virtual visualisation of the environment and on the 
other hand it will ensure that the owners affected by a new 
installation may be able to fully and easily understand the 
project with the help of the conventional project plans.  
Considering the design and architecture of the RBD-
MercatorREE software application in three logic layers, the 
business logic functionalities (calculation of affections and 
ARR generation) will be exposed on the Internet in the
