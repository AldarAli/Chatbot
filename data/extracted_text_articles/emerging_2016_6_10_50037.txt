INTRODUCTION
Optical Multi-Protocol Label Switching (OMPLS) is a
swiftly emerging technology that plays a significant role in
next generation networks by delivering quality of service
(QoS) and traffic engineering features. Interest in OMPLS
has been steadily growing in recent decades. One of the
most promising advances in packet-switching systems in
recent years has been the development of MPLS, where the
separation of routing and forwarding procedures enables
high-speed optical packet transmission [1]. Great processing
delays can be shortened at each node due to the avoidance of
label de-composition in the network layer. In other words,
OMPLS simplifies the forwarding function of routers.
Without abandoning the basics of IP network, OMPLS is
considered an extension protocol because it provides a more
flexible and efficient packet switching.
Within
the
OMPLS
network,
signature
labels
assignment and decomposition on data packets can follow
from Optical Code-Division Multiple-Access (OCDMA)
techniques. Orthogonal coding labels can stack on data
packets and correlate with the corresponding label codes at
each
successive
routing
node.
However,
weaknesses,
including susceptibility to eavesdropping, have recently
been reported in OCDMA [2][3] and hence in OMPLS
systems. As respectively noted by Prucnal [4] and Shake [5],
OCDMA
techniques
suffer
from
inherent
security
disadvantages in the signature decoding. In each routing
node, an eavesdropper can use a simple energy detector to
detect whether energy is present or not. In such cases, there
is no routing security at all because the energy detector
output contains the user’s data stream. In addition, an
OMPLS encoder uses the same fixed code repeatedly over a
large
number
of bits.
Consequently,
an
eavesdropper
equipped with a sophisticated detector on the data node may
be able to tap into the network and recover specific code, if
he/she can obtain a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Thus, to ensure network routing confidentiality when
designing
physical
transport
layer,
enhanced
security
mechanisms must incorporate appropriate signature codecs
to enhance secure packets routing over OMPLS networks.
Data network confidentiality can be enhanced by
methods based on optical signal processing. The three main
approaches are: increasing code-space size [5], reducing
subscriber transceiver power, and
frequently changing
signature code [6]. By employing the third approach, it is
difficult for eavesdroppers to keep up with the speed when
the code is changed. Thus, the code cannot be descrambled
by simply detecting the channel waveform. In addition,
multiple-access interference (MAI) limits the number of
users
simultaneously accessing
the
system. The
most
significant advantage of composite M-sequences is its cyclic
property. Other characteristics include achieving enhanced
communication with data security mechanisms, increasing
system capacity by adding additional users to the same
channel and eliminating MAI.
In this paper, we adapt a dynamically reconfigurable
mechanism over the spectral-amplitude coding scheme of
OMPLS to counter eavesdropping. We compose relatively
prime-length M-sequence codes into sets of complex codes
that govern reconfigurable network codecs by changing
signature codes. Furthermore, we structure codec pairs based
on arrayed-waveguide gratings (AWGs), along with the
corresponding
reconfiguration
switches,
to
implement
complex signature coding in the proposed network. By
exploiting linear cyclic, periodic, and virtually orthogonal
characteristics of M-sequence codes, we exemplify signature

reconfiguration over AWG-based network codecs in this
work.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II briefly outlines the dynamic reconfiguration
scheme consisting of the proposed composite signatures.
Section III describes how the reconfigurable scheme operates
to prevent eavesdroppers from solving the user’s code,
resulting in improved security. Section IV explains the
perspectives
on
eavesdropper
before
and
after
reconfigurations.
Finally,
Section

summarizes
and
presents our conclusions.

STRUCTURING COMPOSITE SIGNATURE CODECS FOR
OPTICAL-MPLS NETWORK
Label stacking is used in MPLS systems by attaching
one or more labels to a single packet to support hierarchical
addressing, reducing the number of labels detected at each
node. The core nodes only need to check an optical label
matching to their label set to determine whether the packet
should be forwarded or not. They do not need to remove the
previous labels and swap a new one. It avoids the function
of optical swapping at the expense of having a large number
of stacked labels.
In the proposed MPLS network, the labels are encoded
by
spectral-amplitude-coding
(SAC)
because
it
has
consentience with label stacking, fast recognition, and low
system cost. Due to its inherent nature, all SAC labels
occupy the same optical band, regardless of the wavelength
used for the optical payload in our system. The payload is
coded by a laser whose spectrum is outside the band of
labels. Thus, label and payload can be combined as an
optical packet and be transmitted simultaneously. Figure 1
shows such a scheme of an optical packet with label
stacking.
Fig. 1. Optical packet with stacked SAC labels.
As shown in Figure 2, the MPLS network is composed
of many different types of nodes. According to the role of
the label switching router (LSR) in the MPLS network, they
can be divided into three different kinds: Ingress node, Core
node, and Egress node. Figure 2 shows the optical packet
switching in the MPLS network. There are six nodes in
total, (A, B, C, D) are the core nodes and (E, F) are edge
nodes. The label switching path (LSP) of this packet is
assumed to be E (Ingress)-A-D-F (Egress). Later, we will
verify the situation of the composite label code packet that
we propose.
Fig. 2. The diagram of label switching in MPLS network.
In the proposed network, the reconfiguration has two
mechanisms. The first one is, each core node changes its
label at a fixed frequency by cyclic shifting signature code.
This scheme is based on the assumption that the upper layers
of the network effectively detect the threat of eavesdropping.
The other way is, the reconfiguration command changes the
signature code to a new one at the transceiver. If a tapper
attacks the network frequently, the changing time becomes
short, making the optical switch operate faster to reconfigure
the code so that the tapping process is blocked. On the other
hand, if the network is mostly in a secure environment, the
frequency of signature code changing is lowered. The
detailed design of the specifications for the central controller
is very complex and beyond the scope of this paper. In this
paper, we use the first mechanism.

SUMMED SPECTRL LABELS ON RECONFIGURATIONS
At
the
ingress
node,
composite
SAC-labels
are
implemented by two AWGs, two multiplexers, one BLS,
and several optical switches, as shown in Figure 3. By using
the cyclic properties of AWG routers and M-sequence
codes, the codecs pair can encode/decode multiple labels
simultaneously. Thus, all labels share the same hardware for
the coding process. A modulo-2 operation combines M-
sequences from two AWGs into a composite code. Optical
switches are used for selecting composite codes for label
stacking, in accordance with the number of pass nodes
determined by label switching path (LSP). The optical

modulator is used to modulate the payload bits onto the
optical coded carrier. The Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM)
modulates the payload bits onto the coded optical carrier.
Then, the SAC labels are combined with the payload bits to
form a packet.
Fig. 3. The mechanism of labels encoding.
In
the
discussed
composite
label
signatures
reconfiguration, the core node will change the label
dynamically. Let us consider an example optical-MPLS
network with three nodes to illustrate composite signature
codes reconﬁguration. The three nodes are node #A, #D,
and #F. We represent the operation of the network codecs
prior to and subsequest to code reconﬁguration using 
numerical coding data. Reconfiguration switches will switch
on corresponding M-sequence codes to compose a set of
composite signature codes. The setup for packets with SAC
labels is illustrated in Figure 4. In our illustration, we select
a 3×3 AWG and a 7×7 AWG for nodes to compose their
label codes.
By combining each of the upper codes (T0C1, T1C1 and
T2C1) in Table I (a) with the 1st lower code T0C2 in Table I
(b), we can get a subset label codes TiC1⊕T0C2, i=0, 1, 2.
Similarly, we can combine each of the upper codes with the
2nd lower code T1C2 to get another subset label codes
TiC1⊕T1C2, i=0, 1, 2. In this way, we can combine each of
the upper M-sequence codes TiC1 in Table I (a), i=0, 1, 2,
with either of the lower M-sequence codes TjC2 in Table I
(b), j=0, 1, …, 6, to get the subset composite label codes
TiC1⊕TjC2 in Table I (c). We can have 7 yards groups in
total, and each group can provide 3 label codes for the
network labels assignment.
From the point of view of eavesdroppers, if a M-
sequence code TiC1 of period length n1=3 (Table I (a)) is
adopted in the network, the eavesdropper will have a 1/3
probability of detecting the signature code correctly. On the
other hand, if an M-sequence code TjC2 of period length
n2=7 (Table I (b)) is utilized, the eavesdropper will have a
1/7 probability of correctly detecting the signature code.
However, if a composite code S(i,j) = TiC1
TjC2 of period
length n=21 is used (Table I(c)), the probability of
interception by the eavesdropper can be lowered to 1/21.
This makes the eavesdropping more difﬁcult and causes the 
eavesdropper to spend more time trying to guess the correct
code.

Fig. 4. Schematic optical-MPLS network with reconfigurable composite signature codecs.
Before signature reconfiguration, we suppose that
the composite code for the node #A is combined from M-
sequence
codes
C1(X)
=
(110,
…)
and
C2(X)
=
(1110010, …):
S1
(0,0)(X) = T0C1(X) ⊕ T0C2(X)
= (001 111 101 010 011 000 100).
As for the node #D, we suppose that the composite code
is combined from M-sequence codes T1C1(X) = (011, …)
and T3C2(X) = (0101110, …):
S2
(1,3)(X) = T1C1(X) ⊕T3C2(X)
= (001 100 010 000 111 110 101).
Further, we suppose the composite signature code for
node #F is constructed from M-sequence codes T1C1(X) =
(011, …) and T5C2(X) = (1001011, …):
S3
(1,5)(X) = T1C1(X) ⊕T5C2(X)
= (111 110 101 001 100 010 000).

thus
takes
the
form

+S2

+S3
(1,5)(X), the label coded signature chips will combine
together to result in a label stack signal prior to signature
reconfiguration:
Y(pri)(X) = S1
(0,0)(X) + S2
(1,3)(X) + S3
(1,5)(X)
= (001 111 101 010 011 000 100)
+ (001 100 010 000 111 110 101)
+ (111 110 101 001 100 010 000)
= (113 321 212 011 222 120 201).
Subsequest to signature reconfiguration, each core
node changes its label by state shifting of the signature
code. The resulted label codes allocated for each routing
node are then stacked over the newly generated data
packets. Other possible combinations of logic “ON” and
logic “OFF” information on stacked label decoding can be
similarly deduced.
IV.
PERSPECTIVES ON EAVESDROPPER BEFORE AND
AFTER RECONFIGURATIONS
The objective of secure OMPLS routing is to ensure
that an unauthorized individual does not gain access to
data in the network. We assume that an eavesdropper is
technologically intelligent with knowledge about signals
being transmitted in the network (i.e., the architecture of
the network, types of signals, data rates, encoding rules,
structure of codes, etc.). In other words, the eavesdropper
is supposed to know everything about the network
operations and signatures coding scheme except for the
specific signature key in the network node.
Figure 5 depicts a general configuration of OMPLS
label decoder at each routing node. A pair of AWGs with
signature label Su
(i,j) and complementary key Su
(i,j) is
adopted here for the u-th receiver decoder. The stacked
label Y from the optical ﬁber channel is directed to the 
(i+1)-th and the (j+1)-th input ports of the 3x3 and 7x7
AWG decoders. Then the label is decoded by executing
balanced detection of correlation subtraction. Only when
the label code of the incoming packet matches that of the
core node, a “matched” indication signal is generated, and
78

the modulator stays in an “ON” state. In contrast, when the
packet label does not match that allocated in the passing
node, no matched indication signal exists, and the
modulator stays in an “OFF” state.
Fig. 5. Composite signature decoder with complementary
subtraction scheme.
In the illustrative OMPLS data packets routing, an
eavesdropper is supposed to tap on node #D. As we have
mentioned, the eavesdropper may bear the same decoder
structure as those in the tapped routing nodes, but with
different signature label codes. Since an eavesdropper is
assumed
to
tap
on
node #D, both node
#D and
eavesdropper will bear the same label code S2
(1,3) = (001
100 010 000 111 110 101) just prior to signature
reconfiguration. Correlation outputs on node #D and also
on eavesdropper before signature reconfiguration will be
Y(pri) × S2
(1,3) = (003 300 010 000 222 120 201)
Y(pri) × S2
(1,3) = (110 021 202 011 000 000 000).
The above correlation magnitudes on the upper and the
lower photodiodes of balanced decoder will subtract to
result in a net photo-energy of |Y(pri)S2
(1,3)| - |Y(pri)S2
(1,3)| =
19-11 = 8 units, indicating a label switching state of ‘ON’
and is able to route the packet data into eavesdropper.
The network will dynamically reconfigure signature
labels allocated to each routing node, either by local node
codecs or globally-controlled state machine. Let us
examine the situation on labels decoding after signature
reconfiguration. With reference to Table I(c), assume that
node #A changes its signature label from S1
(0,0) to S1
(1,0),
node #D changes from S2
(1,3) to S2
(2,3) and node #F
changes from S3
(1,5) to S3
(0,5). We therefore have a stacked
label signal after signature reconfiguration:
Y(pst)(X) = .S1
(1,0)(X) + .S2
(2,3)(X) + .S3
(0,5)(X)
= (221 031 100 321 112 212 113).
This reconfigured and stacked label signal then cascade
with payload data to route the resulted data packets to the
corresponding nodes in the network.
Figure 6 depicts schematic diagram on data packets
routing to node #D while an eavesdropper taps there to
“steal” the information that is sent to the node. Since node
#D can duly reconfigure its label code dynamically, node
#D can correctly decode the information sent into node
#D. However, the eavesdropper would not know the
change of label code and would not decode information
correctly while it still uses “old key” on the decoded
summed signal spectra.
Fig. 6. Schematic of eavesdropper tapping on Node #D.
Specifically, for node #D with new label code S2
(2,3)
= (111 010 100 110 001 000 011) and the newly stacked
label Y(pst) = (221 031 100 321 112 212 113), correlation
output energies obtained at the decoding side for node #D
are
Y(pst) × S2
(2,3) = (221 030 100 321 002 000 013),
Y(pst) × S2
(2,3) = (000 001 000 001 110 212 100).
The above correlation magnitudes will subtract at the
balanced photo-detector in the node #D to result in a net
photo-energy of |Y(pst)S2
(2,3)| - |Y(pst)S2
(2,3)| = 21-10 = 11
units, indicating a label switching state of ‘ON’ and is
able to route the packet data into node #D.
Nevertheless,
even
after
label
signature
reconfiguration, the eavesdropper remains with its prior
label code Se
(1,3) = S2
(1,3) = (001 100 010 000 111 110
101). Correlation with the received stacked label Y(pst) at
the photodiodes will result in detected output energy
for the eavesdropper;
Y(pst) × Se
(1,3) = (001 000 000 000 112 210 103),
Y(pst) × Se
(1,3) = (220 031 100 321 000 002 010).

Correlation subtraction at the balanced photo-detector in
the eavesdropper will result in a net photo-energy of
|Y(pst)Se
(1,3)| - |Y(pst)Se
(1,3)| = 12-18 = -6 units, indicating a
label switching state of ‘OFF’ and is unable to route the
packet data to the eavesdropper.
Table II summarizes the numerical results on the
decoded subtracted correlation for node #D and the
eavesdropper, subsequent to signature reconfiguration. It
is clear that, if the label code is not changed, the
eavesdropper who detects the label code assigned for the
corresponding transceiver user can easily detect the
information for that user. That is the reason we employ a
dynamic code reconﬁgurations scheme to change labels 
allocated to the nodes.

V.
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we proposed a scheme based on
reconﬁgurable signatures to combat eavesdropping in 
optical-MPLS networks. In the proposed scheme, each
user is randomly assigned one set of prime-lengths M-
sequence codes, and then these signature codes get
dynamically
reconfigured
to
enhance
network
conﬁdentiality. Each core node changes its label at a fixed 
frequency by cyclic shifting one or two chips of signature
code to change the code sets assigned for each node to
enhance conﬁdentiality.  
When
the number of signature
codes increases,
detection of the unique user code by an eavesdropper
becomes more difﬁcult; thus, network conﬁdentiality is 
signiﬁcantly increased. The most important feature is the 
signature codes reconﬁguration mechanism that thwarts an 
eavesdropper’s code detection attack. Further work is
required in order to implement fast optical switching and
to
get
lower
SNR
transmissions.
Nevertheless,
the
proposed
scheme
can
considerably
improve
simple
composite coding techniques to provide superior security.
