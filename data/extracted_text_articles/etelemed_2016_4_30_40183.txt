Abstract— The aim of this paper is to present a renewed 
framework for the evaluation of telemedicine that provides 
better insight into the real potential of telemedicine and as such 
fosters implementation in daily clinical practice. This study 
first evaluates the current literature on the use of the 
framework proposed by Dechant et al., 1996. Physical 
rehabilitation is used as casus. After screening, 40 relevant 
papers were included. Results show that the technology used 
and the clinical purposes are diverse and that the majority of 
the technology used was not implemented in daily clinical 
practice. The staged approach to the evaluation of telemedicine 
proposed by Dechant et al., 1996 was rarely applied. From the 
papers included it becomes clear that the following aspects are 
important to consider in the evaluation of telemedicine: (1) the 
type of telemedicine in terms of technology used, its level of 
maturity and its clinical purpose and (2) the way the 
telemedicine is implemented in daily clinical practice (service 
configuration).  
Keywords-Telemedicine; evaluation; framework. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
It is widely acknowledged that telemedicine has great 
potential in healthcare to overcome the problems related to 
our ageing community, to increase the quality and 
accessibility of care, and to restrain the rise of imperative 
healthcare costs. The current state is that the amount of 
evidence regarding the effectiveness of telemedicine is 
growing 
[1][2]. 
However, 
even 
proven 
effective 
telemedicine services often fade away and are not 
implemented into healthcare [3][4][5]. It deserves a further 
analysis to what factors impede the uptake of these services 
and what is needed to speed up its implementation [6][7]. 
One of the questions directly related to this, is whether the 
evaluation studies currently being performed provide 
sufficient evidence to convince healthcare professionals, 
policy makers and insurance companies. 
An evaluation framework is the first step to secure a 
proper evaluation. Currently, only a few evaluation 
frameworks are available. The most common evaluation 
framework is the stage model of drug evaluation [8]. This 
model has been developed by the Food and Drug 
Administration and provides guidelines for demonstrating 
the safety and efficacy of new drugs as a prerequisite for 
marketing. In 1996, an analogous model for evaluation of 
new technologies was proposed by Dechant et al.[9]. In this 
framework, the type of assessment is tailored to the 
development life cycle of the technology. This so-called 
staged 
approach 
differentiates 
between 
telemedicine 
evaluation at application (stage 1-2) and global level (stage 
3-4). Evaluation of a telemedicine service starts with an 
evaluation of the technical efficacy (accuracy and reliability) 
of the application and evaluation of the primary objective of 
the service in terms of access, quality or cost (stage 1-2). 
During the subsequent deployment a comprehensive 
evaluation is necessary, using multiple endpoints such as 
accessibility, quality and cost of care (stage 3). The last step 
of evaluating a telemedicine service is to examine whether 
the overall evaluation of a technology in one system, applies 
in other settings (stage 4). An advantage of this evaluation 
framework is that it takes into account the iterative process 
of the development of the technology. However, considering 
the fast development of new technology the obsolete of this 
evaluation framework could be a disadvantage. 
Proper evaluation is essential to convince the various 
stakeholders of the added value of telemedicine and to come 
to sustainable implementation in daily clinical practice. 
Therefore, the aim of this paper is to create and present a 
renewed framework for evaluation of telemedicine starting 
from the framework proposed by Dechant et al. [9] that 
provides better insight in the real potential of telemedicine 
and as such fosters implementation in daily clinical practice. 
In section II the methods of this paper are described. Section 
III addresses the results in four topics; telemedicine service, 
added value, use of an evaluation framework and refinement 
of the evaluation framework. Section IV describes the 
discussion. The acknowledgement and references close the 
paper.

METHODS 
To present the current state of the evaluation of 
telemedicine for physical rehabilitation, a computerized 
literature search of the Medline and Scopus databases were 
conducted in January 2014. The search strategy and 
keywords used for both databases are shown in Table 1. In 
addition to this search, the online versions of three journals 
in telemedicine (Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, 
Journal of Telemedicine and e-Health and International 
Journal of Telemedicine and Applications) were manually 
searched for additional relevant references.

Papers were included when: (1) they were designed as an 
evaluation study; (2) they concerned patients and not 
healthy subjects; (3) the telemedicine intervention utilized 
remote treatment by means of ICT; (4) the treatment 
focused on physical rehabilitation or exercising and (5) they 
were written in English, German or Dutch. Papers were 
excluded when: (1) no results of the evaluation were 
provided; (2) they only gave a description of the 
telemedicine service or the proposed evaluation; (3) no 
healthcare professionals were involved in the service 
delivery; (4) they concerned patients with mental illnesses; 
(5) they were duplicates of other already included paper and 
(6) they were published before 01-01-2000. 
Potential eligibility of the papers was first identified 
from the titles and abstracts identified during the searches. 
Two reviewers (CSvdV and SMJK) read all titles and/or 
abstracts independently. If an abstract did not give sufficient 
information about the study, the full-text paper was obtained 
for further review. Then the reviewers evaluated full-text 
papers independently and reached consensus about whether 
or not the papers should be included. Papers were not 
blinded for authors and journals. 
To gain insight into the evaluations performed in the 
studies, a data extraction form was developed to 
systematically describe: 
- 
the technology used in the telemedicine service; 
- 
the clinical aim for which the telemedicine service is 
used; 
- 
the way the telemedicine service was implemented in 
daily clinical practice i.e. service configuration; 
- 
the outcome of the evaluation study on the domains 
accessibility, quality of care and cost of care as 
suggested by Dechant et al.[9], 
- 
and whether or not the author refers explicitly to an 
evaluation framework as a starting point. 
After assessing all full-text papers, the reviewers reached 
consensus and completed the data extraction form. The 
outcome of the data extraction form will be presented in the 
results section. Based on these results, the evaluation 
framework proposed by Dechant et al. [9] is refined, to 
involve all aspects and to increase the use of it as the 
standard framework for evaluation of telemedicine services. 
III. 
RESULTS 
Based on our literature search, we started with a set of 
1511 citations. These were analyzed and 1413 citations were 
excluded following screening. We retrieved 98 potentially 
relevant papers in full text. We excluded 62 of these based 
on the pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Main 
reasons for exclusion were that technology used did not 
utilize remote treatment and the participants of the 
evaluation study were healthy subjects. The literature search 
provided us with 36 papers. The manual search of the online 
version of the journals in telemedicine by screening of titles, 
abstracts and full-texts left us with 4 relevant papers in full 
text. In total, we retrieved 40 relevant papers. 
A. Telemedicine service  
Technology used: Various technologies are described in 
the 40 papers included. In 24 (60%) papers, a 
videoconference 
system 
(synchronous 
communication 
technologies) was used to enable contact between the patient 
and healthcare professional. This was used to have remote 
face-to-face contact during exercising [10-25] or a scheduled 
face-to-face contact [26][27][[28][29][30][31][32][33]. In six 
(15%) papers, patient and professional had contact by an 
asynchronous communication technology, such as email on a 
weekly basis [29][34][35][36] or as short messaging 
technology after an exercise session [37][38]. 
In 26 (65%) papers, sensor-based technologies were used 
for a variety of reasons. In more detail: in eight papers to 
guarantee secure exercising [25][32][33][38][39][40][41] 
[42]; in seven papers to monitor patient’s progression or 
adherence [27][34][35][36][38][46][47]; in three papers to 
deliver automatic and professional feedback to the patients 
[43][44][45] and in nine papers to detect the motions of a 
patient 
[11][12][16][26][28][29][30][31][48]. 
Exercise-
application are used in 18 (45%) papers to activate patients 
to perform exercises and to rehabilitate in their own 
environment 
[22][26][27][28][29][30][31][33][35][36][37] 
[41][43][44][45][47][48][49] and in four (10%) papers, 
virtual reality or game technologies are used to stimulate the 
patient to execute the requested exercises [11][12][16][22]. 
In 72.5% of the included papers the telemedicine service 
used two or more of above mentioned technologies. 
Clinical purpose: Clinical purpose is an important 
characteristic to describe a telemedicine application and was 
hardly addressed in the included papers. Based on the 
technology used three different clinical purposes can be 
identified: 
- 
Consultation (27.5%): to enable a real-time one-to-one 
or group based contact between patient and healthcare 
professional 
during 
the 
rehabilitation 
session 
[10][13][14][15]17][18][19][20][21][23][24]; 
- 
Safety (20%): to enable a safe environment to 
rehabilitate independently. In these cases, during a 
remote rehabilitation session, ECG or saturation level 
was monitored [25][32][34][38][39][40][42][46];

- 
Remote supervision and exercising (52.5%): to remotely 
supervise the patient using sensor-based technology and 
to enable the patient to exercise by means of a 
technology 
supported 
exercise-application 
[11][12][16][22][26][27][28][29][30][31][33][35][36][3
7][41][43][44][45][47][48][49]. 
Service configurations: This characteristic of the 
telemedicine application was in most included papers not 
addressed. In 15 papers telemedicine was delivered to the 
patients as a follow-up treatment [10][12][14][15][19][20] 
[23][24][26][32][34][37][38][40][41] after a period of 
conventional 
rehabilitation 
patients 
prolonged 
their 
rehabilitation at home by means of telemedicine. In the 
remaining 22 papers, the telemedicine technology was 
evaluated as being an autonomous treatment. In none of the 
included papers telemedicine was delivered as addition or 
(partially) replacement of the conventional treatment. 
B. Added Value 
Telemedicine 
has 
the potential to 
increase 
the 
accessibility of care, to increase the quality of care and to 
decrease the costs of care. This added value of telemedicine 
is widely accepted and determined by the characteristics of 
telemedicine: technology used, clinical purpose and service 
configuration. To evaluate the true potential of telemedicine 
it is important to relate the outcome of the evaluation to the 
hypothesized added value of the telemedicine services 
beforehand.  
Accessibility: All telemedicine services have the 
potential added value to increase the accessibility of 
healthcare, because technology used allows remote contact 
among patient and healthcare professional. From a patient 
point of view increase accessibility means no geographical 
obstacles or absence of work [33][39]. Accessibility was not 
directly parameterized as outcome in the evaluation of the 
telemedicine intervention. However, 25 of the included 
papers assessed the patients’ experience in terms of 
satisfaction and usability. Overall it can be stated that 
patients are satisfied with the telemedicine interventions and 
the interventions evaluated are “easy to use”. Next to the 
accessibility for the patient, there is also accessibility from 
the healthcare professional’s point of view what can be 
defined as the ability to treat more patients simultaneously or 
to treat patients from a larger geographical area. In none of 
the included papers these potential added value was 
addressed. 
Quality of care: Telemedicine services that support 
remote supervision and actuate patients to exercise in their 
own environment have the potential added value to increase 
the quality of healthcare as these telemedicine services give 
patients the ability to excise more often, independently from 
the availability of a healthcare professional or treatment 
facilities. In 21 of the included papers the evaluated 
telemedicine services gave patients the ability to rehabilitate 
independently. Quality of care was assessed in nineteen of 
these papers. Eleven studies used a prognostic cohort and 
concluded that telemedicine services induced positive 
changes [28][29][31][33][34][38][40][42][45][48][49]. The 
other 8 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT). 
Seven of these RCT-studies found telemedicine services at 
least 
as 
effective 
as 
conventional 
care 
[26][35][41][43][44][46][47]. Only 1 of these RCT-studies 
concluded that telemedicine was more effective as 
conventional care [30] 
Costs of care: Telemedicine services delivered as 
(partial) replacement of the conventional treatment have the 
potential added value to reduce costs. From a healthcare 
professional point of view cost can be reduced when the 
technology used give the professional the ability to increase 
the efficiency of the treatment. Only four of the included 
papers investigated the costs relating to the evaluated 
telemedicine service. One service was implemented as 
follow-up treatment [14] and the other three as autonomous 
treatments [33][43][44]. Given the results of these 4 papers it 
can be stated that the efficiency of the treatment can be 
increased by a decrease in preparation and consultation time 
[43][44] or by lowering travel costs for professionals [14] 
and patients [33][44]. 
C. Use of an evaluation framework 
The evaluation framework proposed by Dechant et al. [9] 
was only used in two of the included papers [43][44]. Both 
papers were stage 4 evaluation studies. Applying the four 
stages of the evaluation framework proposed by Dechant et 
al. [9] to categories, the included papers, show that most  
papers (55%) present the results of a stage 1-2 evaluation. 
The included papers focused mainly on clinical effectiveness 
(45%), feasibility (42,5%), user-experience (7,5%) and 
adherence (5%). 
D. Refinement of the evaluation framework 
The staged approach to the evaluation of telemedicine 
purpose by Dechant et al.[9] is rarely applied in the included 
papers. From the reviewed papers, it becomes clear that the 
following aspects are important to consider in evaluation: 
- 
The type of telemedicine application in terms of which 
technology used and its level of maturity and clinical 
purpose for which it is being used. 
- 
The context in which the telemedicine application is 
being used such as the service configuration  
Once having these defined the main outcome criteria and 
the design of the evaluation can be defined. Taking this into 
account and looking at the framework proposed by Dechant 
et al. [9], the stages of evaluation are well defined but their 
content can be further refined in the following way: 
Stage I: The first stage of telemedicine evaluation 
focuses on the feasibility and usability of the technology 
used in an experimental design with a small number of 
subjects or even case studies. This type of evaluation design 
allows researchers to gain detailed information which can be 
used for further improvement of the telemedicine service. 
The telemedicine service is evaluated as a standalone 
service and evaluation endpoints focus on feasibility and 
usability of the technology used.

Figure 1.  
The refinement of the staged approach to evaluation of telemedicine. 
Stage II: The technology used in the second stage is 
stable and evaluation is focused on gaining an initial idea 
about the potential added value for clinical practice and 
possible working mechanisms. For this, evaluation can be 
performed using the telemedicine service as a standalone 
service. Designs that can be used focus on studying 
processes in often small groups of subjects rather than on 
examining the effectiveness. Suitable designs are cohort 
studies with a small sample size (n<50) or single-case 
design (or N = 1 designs) [50]. The evaluation endpoints 
within this stage should focus on the potential added value 
of the telemedicine service mapped on both the technology 
used and the clinical purpose that is supported. 
Stage III: This stage starts when earlier studies indicate 
that the telemedicine service has potential and focuses on 
showing the effectiveness of the telemedicine service and/or 
adoption of the service by its end-users. In order to identify 
these aspects, it is important that the telemedicine services 
are evaluated in the way they will be implemented in daily 
clinical practice. Although, randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) are considered the gold standard for evaluating the 
safety and effectiveness of medical interventions their 
characteristics do not fit well with the evaluation of 
telemedicine services [50]. An alternative for a conventional 
RCT might be the "cohort multiple randomized controlled 
trial" (cmRCT) being introduced by Relton et al.[51]. The 
evaluation endpoints at this stage should not only focus on a 
previously defined value expected for each technology used 
and the clinical purpose that is supported but also take into 
account the way the telemedicine service is being 
implemented in daily clinical practice. 
Stage IV: The fourth stage evaluation elaborates the 
adoption as addressed in stage III. To ensure further 
implementation, 
involvement 
of 
every 
stakeholder 
(healthcare professionals, patients, technology providers, 
insurance companies and policy makers on a local and 
national level) is important. This means that evaluation here 
should focus on the business models and concrete business 
cases. Without information on the cost and effectiveness of 
telemedicine services, decision makers run the risk of 
introducing services that are not cost-effective for society 
[53]. This evaluation can only be performed in an adequate 
way when the service is implemented in daily clinical 
practice as only in this case the true added value can be 
evaluated. The studies performed in this stage are large-
scale cohort studies (n≥50) [54]. As addressed in stage III 
the evaluation endpoints in this stage should focus on the 
expected value of the telemedicine service depending on the 
application that is being used (technology used and clinical 
purpose) but also on the way it has been implemented in 
daily clinical practice (service configuration).  
The refinement of the staged approach.to evaluation of 
telemedicine are presented in figure 1.  
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The aim of this paper was to create and present a 
renewed framework for telemedicine evaluation that 
provides better insight in the real potential of telemedicine 
services and as such fosters implementation in daily practice. 
For this the use of the evaluation framework proposed by 
Dechant et al. [9] was analyzed using the current state of the 
evaluation of telemedicine service for physical rehabilitation 
as casus. Focusing on the characteristics of telemedicine for 
physical rehabilitation it can be concluded that the 
technology used and the clinical purpose were diverse and 
the majority of the telemedicine was not implemented in 
daily clinical practice. The level of maturity of the evaluated 
telemedicine was low and therefore most evaluations focused 
on feasibility, user-experience and adherence (stage 1-2 
evaluation). In the following years, the level of maturity of 
telemedicine will increase and it is expected that more stage 
3-4 evaluations will be published.

It is desirable that these evaluation studies relate the 
outcome of the evaluation to the hypothesized added value of 
the telemedicine beforehand to evaluate the true potential, 
focusing on accessibility of care, quality of care and costs of 
care [51, 55-59].  
Based on the results, a refined version of the staged 
approach to the evaluation of telemedicine [9] for physical 
rehabilitations were presented and created, which of course 
need to be further validated in other cases to see whether this 
framework is useful and is generalizable for telemedicine 
evaluation in general.
