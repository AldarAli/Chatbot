Abstract— The capabilities of an Integrated Streak Camera 
(ISC) prototype fabricated in an AMS 0.35 µm CMOS process 
to observe light pulses of few nanosecond FWHM (Full width 
at half maximum) with or without analog accumulation is 
presented. The sensor consists of a matrix of 64 * 64 pixels 
including an electronic shutter and an analog accumulation 
capability. The sensor can operate in single shot mode when 
the light pulse power is sufficient and in repetitive mode, i.e., it 
can measure a recurrent light pulse and accumulates the 
successive photo charges into an internal node, for low light 
detection. The repetitive mode improves the sensitivity and the 
signal to noise ratio of the system. The functionality of a streak 
camera is reproduced through a versatile integrated temporal 
sweep unit that generates a sampling period continuously 
adjustable from 125 ps to DC. The distributed architecture and 
the in-pixel embedded memory allows the sampling rate to 
exceed 400 GS/s. Results on the dynamic performance of the 
ISC are presented. The measurements showed a temporal 
resolution close to the nanosecond and a repetition rate of 
more than 50 MHz. A 6 ns FWHM light pulse spatially focused 
on a single pixel row has been successfully measured in single 
shot and in accumulation mode.

INTRODUCTION 
High speed imaging is used in many scientific fields to 
measure phenomena which are not observable with naked 
eyes [1]-[4]. Ultra fast video cameras take a succession of 
images to observe transient events of about a microsecond 
[5]. The observation of faster transients is possible using a 
streak camera [6][7] which produces the one-dimensional 
spatial (x) intensity (I) (a streak) of a light pulse event as a 
function of the time (t). The output of the camera is a two 
dimensional image I=f(x,t). The streak camera offers the 
best temporal resolution in the field of direct detection in 
optics which can reach less than one picosecond [8]. 
However the use of vacuum tubes for this camera makes the 
system delicate, cumbersome and expensive. It also requires 
a high supply voltage (> 1 kV) and makes use of critical 
radio frequency electronics. The aim of our work is to 
develop an Integrated Streak Camera (ISC) in a standard 
CMOS technology that can reach a temporal resolution of 
the order of a few hundreds of picoseconds that actually 
corresponds to the use of streak camera for a lot of 
applications. 
Examples 
are 
photoluminescence 
from 
nanocrystals [9][10], velocimetry, interferometry to study 
shock waves of various materials [11]-[13], or in-life 
sciences for fluorescence lifetime imaging [14][15] and 
Förster resonance energy transfer [16]. In 2003, the first 
prototype of ISC, based on a pixel array, demonstrated the 
feasibility of an ISC with a sampling period in the order of 
one nanosecond and a temporal resolution of about 6 ns 
[17]. Nevertheless, this sensor operates only in single shot 
mode and presents a low signal to noise ratio. Indeed, it 
requires a derivative reconstruction process that increases 
the high frequency noise and implies a low output dynamic 
range. 
The pixel architecture developed for the second 
generation of the CMOS spatiotemporal camera includes an 
electronic shutter and an analog accumulation feature within 
the pixel in order to increase the system sensitivity. In [18], 
the static characterization of the accumulation mode has 
been reported. In this paper, an improvement of the 
complete architecture and the dynamic performances of the 
accumulation mode are presented. The new design increases 
considerably the signal to noise ratio for both the single shot 
and the repetitive mode. Moreover, the evaluated maximal 
repetition rate is above 50 MHz which is comparable to the 
fast repetition rate achievable with a conventional streak 
camera in synchroscan mode [19]. In the next section, we 
present the overall architecture and operation of the ISC and 
its pixel. After that, the dynamic characteristics and some 
experimental results of optical pulse measurements with and 
without accumulation are shown. 
II. 
ARCHITECTURE OF THE INTEGRATED STREAK 
CAMERA 
A. 
Overall architecture and operation principle 
The functionality of the MISC (for Matrix based ISC) 
sensor is depicted in Fig. 1. For this matrix sensor 
architecture, in which the spatial axis is directed along the 
columns and the temporal axis is associated to the rows, the 
light signal can be correctly discriminated only if the spatial 
light intensity on a row is well known or, ideally, uniform. 
The advantage of creating a 2D array is to have several 
spatial channels in one chip, i.e., a conventional streak 
camera-like image I=f(x,t). One can take advantage of the 
proposed illumination setup in [20] including a mechanical 
slit followed by a cylindrical lens in order to carry out the 
uniform light spreading operation while maintaining the

spatial resolution along the slit. 
Let us consider a laser pulse train for the clarity of the 
explanation. We assume that this luminous event is punctual 
and focused on the slit, i.e., it is lighting uniformly a single 
row i of the MISC. For each pulse, the optical signal is 
integrated by the photodetector within the pixels pij with 
j∈[1,m]. The light is integrated during Tint for each pixel, 
but the beginning of the integration Startj for each column j 
is shifted by ∆T through the sweep unit. This operation is 
equivalent to the deflection of the electronic beam in an 
ordinary streak camera. Next, the corresponding photo-
charges are stored and added to the previous ones inside the 
pixel by activating the Acc signal. Note that the operational 
sample rate of such a device is about 400 GS/s with a 
sample period ∆T of 150 ps and 64 lines. This very high 
data rate close to 10 Tb/s, cannot be continuously extracted 
from the sensor. In order to bypass the bottleneck of the I/O 
bus of the circuit, this architecture uses an embedded analog 
memory in each pixel to perform this operation. At the end 
of the acquisition, the data are extracted at a moderate rate 
of 20 Mpixel/s with a classical readout unit, not represented 
on Fig. 1.  
The resulting signal of pixel pij is equivalent to a 
convolution between the illumination and a rectangle 
function with duration Tint and is given by:

Description of the sweep unit 
The sweep unit previously reported in [18] consists of a 
cascaded chain of inverter with constant delays and fixed 
sweep speed. The new architecture of the sweep unit, 
depicted in Fig. 2, generates a flexible sweep speed in the 
range from 125 ps/pixel up to the DC operation. It consists 
of two main delay generators. The fast sweep unit (FSU) is 
useful for sub-nanosecond sample period operation. It is 
composed of a Delay Locked Loop (DLL) and two Voltage-
Controlled Delay Lines (VCDLs). The observation time of 
the camera is set by the DLL reference clock period. The 
mirror VCDLs are driven by the same control voltages Vhl 
and Vlh as the master DLL and allow an asynchronous delay 
generation with respect to the reference clock. This makes it 
possible for the proposed generator to be launched from 
zero-tap position upon external triggering signal, ensuring 
the synchronization between the beginning of the 
acquisition procedure and the luminous phenomenon to be 
captured. The output taps of the VCDLs are delayed by an 
adjustable delay ∆T given by the ratio of the DLL Clock to 
the number of columns m. 
The voltage controlled cell is a current starved double 
inverter with NMOS control transistors. It presents a large 
delay range and has been optimized for the shortest delay 
achievable in the CMOS technology employed [21]. The 
master DLL ensures the stability over temperature and the 
absolute precision of the delay. Nevertheless, the VCDLs 
must be exactly matched to ensure the same temporal 
shifting and duration of integrating window. The Start and 
Stop trigger signals are generated externally. Using two 
independent 
command 
signals 
allows 
reducing 
the 
integration time down to 1 ns or less. Results from a similar 
FSU have been reported in [22] and are summarized on 
table I. 
The slow sweep unit (SSU) is useful for nanosecond up 
to DC operation. It uses a fast D flip-flop shift register. The 
sample period ∆T is equal to the frequency period of the 
register clock frequency REG Clock. The linearity of such a 
delay generator is very good as it is linked to the clock 
stability. Nevertheless, in an asynchronous operation, the 
timing jitter of the generated startj and stopj signals with 
respect to the trigger signal start and stop is equal to the 
sample period peak-to-peak.

C. 
Description of the pixel 
The architecture of the pixel is shown in Fig. 3. A 
Nwell/Psub photodiode is used in order to have a broadband 
light sensitivity and a low capacitance to enhance the 
conversion gain. The Starti and Reset transistors reset the 
photodiode and the readout node (RN), respectively. 
Shuttering is carried out by the Stopi transistor and the 
charges are transferred from the internal node (IN) to the 
readout node by the Acc transistor. The Acc and Reset 
commands are global for the entire matrix. 
The static operation and characterization of the MISC 
obtained under continuous illumination in single shot and in 
accumulation mode and has been reported in [23]. In the 
next section, the repetitive mode with analog on chip 
accumulation is described and some experimental results are 
shown.  
III. 
ANALOG ACCUMULATION FEATURE 
A. 
Description of the analog accumulation operation 
The accumulation mode is performed by several 
acquisitions of one repetitive pulse. The initial phase 
consists in resetting the readout node with the Reset 
transistors. Then the readout node RN is left floating, ready 
to accumulate several low intensity acquisitions. Each 
acquisition is composed of four operating phases: the reset 
of the photodiode, the integration of the light, the sampling 
and the charge transfer from the internal to the readout 
nodes. During the reset of the photodiode the Stop transistor 
is held high to have the same potential on the photodiode 
and on the internal node (Fig. 3). The integration begins 
when the command of the Starti transistor is at low level and 
finishes when the command of the Stopi transistor falls at 
low level. Indeed, on the falling edge of the signal Stopi the 
potential of the photodiode is sampled and hold in the IN. 
Finally, the charges stored in this node are transferred to RN 
by applying an intermediate voltage between VRR and VRPD 
to the gate of the transistor Acc (e.g., 2.5 V) during the 
transfer time TAcc [18]. In the accumulation mode this 
sequence is repeated several times, without resetting the 
readout node. 
B. 
Analog accumulation performances 
The maximal repetition rate of the acquisition is limited 
by the sum of the reset phase, the observation time m⋅∆T 
and the transfer time TAcc. The reset phase occurs in less 
than 1 ns. The functions of the RN voltage versus the 
photodiode reset voltage (VRPD) for different transfer 
durations from 1 ns up to 10 µs, with VRR = 3.3 V and 
Acc = 2.5 V, are depicted on Fig. 4. These functions are 
composed of 3 regions. In the first region, the gain is zero, 
i.e., no charge is transferred as the Acc transistor is turned 
off, because VRPD is above a threshold voltage (VTH) 
depending on TAcc. The second region illustrates the charge 
transfer operation that occurs when the photodiode voltage 
VRPD is lower than the previous VTH and above a second 
threshold voltage depending of TAcc. Below this last voltage, 
the Acc transistor is completely turned on and the RN and 
IN nodes are shorted, i.e., voltage VIN and VRN are equal, 
consequently, the gain gets lower [23]. The region 2 is the 
usable mode for the accumulation process and the 
simulation results show that the charge transfer efficiency is 
independent of the TAcc duration if the photodiode reset 
voltage is well adjusted (Fig. 4). In this case, VRN is given by

where VRN0 the previous voltage of the RN. This indicates 
that the maximal repetition rate is mainly due to the 
temporal window as the reset and transfer phase can be 
reduced to a few nanoseconds.  
This behavior arises from the transient phenomenon of 
the charge transfer. At the beginning of the charge transfer, 
the VGS of the Acc transistor is well above its threshold 
voltage but as soon as the charges are transferred, the 
potential of the internal node VIN increases very quickly,

i.e., in less than 1 ns, reducing the VGS down to the 
threshold. Then the transistor is turning off very slowly 
while the charge flow gets lower and lower. Consequently, 
when Tacc gets longer, more and more of those charges are 
transferred maintaining the transfer efficiency even with a 
higher VRPD. For linear operation, the inflections in the VRN 
to VRP curves visible in the ellipse of the Fig. 4 must be 
avoid. Consequently, an overvoltage of 20 mV of dark 
signal must be added at each accumulation. Assuming a 
dynamic range of 1 V, the number of accumulations is 
limited to about 50 shots. 
IV. 
MEASUREMENTS 
A. 
Charge transfer efficiency 
A 64 × 64 pixels prototype has been realized in the 
standard AMS 0.35 µm CMOS technology. In order to 
evaluate the highest repetition rate, the transfer gain 
efficiency versus the VRPD for different TAcc has been 
measured (Fig. 5).  
Fig. 5 shows that the transfer efficiency is effectively 
independent of Tacc if the photodiode reset voltage is well 
tuned. For Tacc equal 1 ns and 10 ns the curves are shifted to 
a lower VRPD than expected by the simulation. This is due to 
the external pulse generator we use to generate the Acc 
control signal. Indeed, the rising and falling time of the 
signal delivered by this unit is about 1 ns, consequently, the 
effective Tacc is reduced for a pulse duration a few 
nanoseconds. Nevertheless, this measurement is the proof 
that Tacc can be reduced to a few nanoseconds, leading to a 
repetition period very close to the observation time.  
B. 
Test bench for repetitive pulse observation 
The experimental setup for the observation of repetitive 
optical pulses is show in Fig. 6. It is composed of a pulsed 
laser source, a synchronization unit, a delay line and an 
optical fiber. The accumulation is possible only if the MISC 
is synchronized with the source. Since the laser is subjected 
to jitter, the synchronization is operated by using a 
photodiode trigger unit. The delivered trigger signal is split 
between the Start signal of the sweep unit and the Stop 
signal. A flexible very short delay (a few nanoseconds or 
less) of integration ∆T is externally added by a passive 
jitter-less delay line. The laser source is delayed by an 
optical fiber to fit the capture temporal window of the 
MISC. The electronic setup inside the camera is composed 
of a FPGA that delivers the remaining command signals 
(Acc transistor, readout, etc.), a 12 bits analog to digital 
converter and the digital acquisition board. For this 
measurement, the FSU has been used with a 22 MHz 
reference clock which corresponds to an observation 
window of 45.5 ns and a sample period of  710 ps. 
C. 
Observation of light pulses in accumulation mode 
A vanadate Q-switched diode pumped solid state laser 
which delivers pulses of 6 ns FWHM, at 532 nm, with a 
frequency repetition of 100 Hz has been used as the optical 
source. The laser beam was spread with a cylindrical lens in 
order to illuminate uniformly one row on the array sensor. A 
luminous pulse of low intensity, spatially focused on 20 µm, 
has been observed with three different operation modes of 
our 
sensor. 
The integration time 
used 
to 
obtain 
measurements presented on Figs. 7, 8 and 9 was fixed at 
1 ns. With this short Tint, the convolution effect can be 
neglected with a pulse FWHM of several nanoseconds. On

all these images the dark level of each pixel has been 
subtracted in order to remove the fixed pattern noise (FPN).  
Fig. 7 shows the luminous pulse measured in single shot 
mode. It is not easy to discern the pulse shape among the 
noise. Indeed, the signal to noise ratio (SNR), i.e, the ratio 
between the normalized Gaussian power and the normalized 
RMS noise, is evaluated to 29. 
Fig. 8 presents the same signal measured without analog 
accumulation but with 200 frame software acquisitions, i.e., 
the resulting picture is the computed averaging of several 
single shot laser pulses. Of course the level of the luminous 
pulses has the same order of magnitude, but in this case, the 
effect of the readout noise is expected to be attenuated by a 
ratio of 2000.5. The measured SNR is 155. The improvement 
of the SNR by a factor 5.4 is less than then expected one. 
The difference probably results by some speckle effects than 
are not averaged with this technique. 
Finally, Fig. 9 presents the luminous pulse resulting from 
20 
on-chip 
analog 
accumulations, 
without 
external 
acquisition. The signal amplitude is about 20 times higher 
than the one obtain in single shot with its associated 
photodiode KTC noise, whereas KTC noise of the RN and 
the readout noise are kept constant. Indeed, there are just 
one Reset of RN and one readout per acquisition The result 
shows that the readout noise is the dominant noise, thus, to 
first approximation, the expected SNR improvement ratio is 
roughly 20 while neglecting the photodiode KTC noise, the 
photonic noise and the speckle effect. The SNR obtained in 
this mode is 215, i.e. a improvement ratio of 7.4 compare to 
the single shot. This is higher than the software averaging 
for an order of magnitude less acquisition. Consequently, 
the analog on chip accumulation capability is a powerful 
feature, which improves the SNR of an ISC. Moreover, the 
repetition rate in this mode is not limited by the readout 
time but only by the transfer time. It is thus not limited to a 
few hundred of Hz but can be higher than 50 MHz. 
D. 
Temporal resolution  
During these measurements, the measured FWHM is 
8 ± 0.5 pixels. As the sampling period is 710 ps/pixel, it 
means that the observed pulse duration is 5.7 ± 0.4 ns 
FWHM, which is very close to the 6 ns measured by a fast 
PiN photodiode and an oscilloscope. Consequently, the 
temporal resolution is better than 6 ns at 532 nm. 
Measurement of a femtosecond laser pulse at 400 nm with 
an integration duration ∆T of 400 ps indicates that the 
temporal resolution is 1.1 ns FWHM (see Fig. 10). 
Preliminary results obtained with the picoseconds laser 
diode generator described in [24] show a temporal 
resolution very close to the nanosecond too at 650 nm 
whereas it is degraded to more than 3 ns at 808 nm. This 
degradation of the temporal resolution is due to the slow 
transient response of the used Nwell/Psub photodiode at 
such a long wavelength.

 CONCLUSION 
This work showed that it is possible to realize an 
integrated streak camera in CMOS technology operating in 
a accumulation mode at a high repetition rate of more than 
50 MHz. This system, carried out in a 0.35 µm AMS CMOS 
technology, allows the observation of short luminous 
phenomena in repetitive mode by analog accumulation of 
the photo-charges inside the sensor with a temporal 
resolution 
close 
to 
the 
nanosecond. 
The 
analog 
accumulation feature increases the SNR proportionally to 
the number of accumulations. However, the maximum 
number of accumulations is limited to 50 to avoid nonlinear 
operation. Combination of both the analog and software 
accumulation could be used to enhance the SNR to a higher 
value.
