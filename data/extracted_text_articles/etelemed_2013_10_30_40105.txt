Abstract—Understanding user expectations is an important 
issue in Hospital Information Systems. The expectations of the 
users must be well understood and taken into consideration in 
Hospital Information System design to catch the success and 
user support. 17 potential end-user expectations from Hospital 
Information Systems are rank ordered according to the 
perceived importance of users and the least  five expectations 
appeared to be Privacy, Help Manuals, Security, Research 
Facilities and Decision Support respectively from the least 
ranked. These expectations are supposed to be higher ranked. 
The user assets that may affect this unexpected result are 
examined. It is seen that perceived importance may change 
according to the user assets, and these assets have influence on 
the unexpected result.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Information System (IS) success and failure reasons are 
largely discussed in the literature. Technical issues, 
organizational issues, management issues are the main topics 
for the failure [1-3]. “Expectation Failure” is one of the 
reasons for the failure, which can be defined as the gap 
between the users’ expectations from the IS and its real 
performance [4].  IS Success (ISS) reasons are also of great 
interest to the literature as well as failure reasons.  
A. Background 
The ratings of the perceived importance usually change 
from one person to another, because everyone has a different 
measurement 
standard 
and 
personal 
approach 
[5]. 
Elimination of such individual relativity is possible by means 
of the rank ordering process [5].  
Relative importance and rank ordering of ISS factors 
directly related to the user expectations are examined in the 
literature [5-9]. “Realization of user requirements” in 
Pearson’s work [7], “users’ confidence in the systems” in 
Montazemi’s work [8] and Eldon’s work [5], “user 
expectations” in Conrath and Mignen’s work [9] appear to be 
in the top five ranked important factors. 
In IS context, understanding user expectations is a 
challenging task [10, 11]. According to the contrast theory, 
the difference between the expectation and reality is 
exaggerated, when expectations are not met [12, 13]. The 
degree of harm increases exponentially. That is, the 
frustration fuels itself by the word of mouth conversations 
between users within the organization.   
Although the importance of user expectations is known 
by literature and researchers show great interest to this topic, 
there is no study about the expectations from Hospital 
Information System (HIS).   
In the previous work, perceived importance of the user 
expectations from HIS was examined [14]. In this study, it 
was stated that the expectations of users must be well 
understood and discreetly worked out to design and 
implement a successful, acceptable and useful IS [14]. The 
expectations and priorities of these expectations must be well 
understood. In healthcare, huge investments are made in IS 
and failure rate is 60-70% [15]. User acceptance is important 
to catch the success. It can be provided with high expectation 
meeting ratios. That may lead higher usage ratios, resulting 
in successful IS implementations.  
B. Motivation 
 There were surprising results in the previous work [14]. 
Decision Support, Research Facilities, Security, Help 
Manuals and Privacy expectations were the least five ranks. 
Except Help Manuals, the other four are expected to mean 
more importance to the users according to the literature.  
Patient’s health data are the most sensitive data about 
humans [16]. Electronic Patient Records and Information 
systems give opportunity to easy and unauthorized access to 
the private and very sensitive data about the patients, when 
compared to manual archives. For this reason, the security 
and privacy of the patient data in HIS are questioned.  
Decision Support functions are crucial for end-user 
acceptance [17]. In literature, there are studies proving 
Hospital Information Systems (HIS) with Decision Support 
functions be more successful [18-21]. It supports the clinical 
diagnosis, enlightens the physician in treatment by 
reminding him the right trials and also provides him with 
the background information of the patient.  
Clinical research is another indispensible virtue of the 
HIS [22].  Medicine improves by way of the researches. 
Consider making the research without the facilities of the 
HIS in medicine. Examining the handwritings in the manual 
178

archive, within the unstructured data and hard to read 
handwriting would be long time consuming and difficult 
process. Additionally, this way of research is prone to 
mistakes and misleading results.  
The literature tells us these expectation variables 
are/should be indispensible and crucial virtues of the HIS. It 
would be hard to work in complex healthcare environment 
for the healthcare professionals without these facilities.  The 
motivation of this work is the low ranks of these important 
aspects of the HIS, which do not comply with the literature.  
 The aim of this study is to examine further the 
unexpected least five ranked expectations. The objective is 
to get an answer to the question “What personal features of 
the HIS users (named as ‘assets’ in this study) may be 
effective in this unexpected result”.  
Materials used in the study will be given in the Materials 
section.  In Methods section, the methods used to get the 
study results will be described. In Results section, the result 
of the study will be given without any comment, and these 
results will be discussed in the Discussion section. The 
findings of the study and the proposed future work will be 
in the Conclusion and Future Work part.  
II. 
MATERIALS  
A. User Expectations 
HIS specifications, computer support centers’ experiences 
and interviews with HIS end-users are used to constitute the 
possible user expectations from a HIS. These possible 
expectations 
are 
grouped 
to 
make 
them 
more 
comprehendible. 
The 
expectation 
groups 
constitute 
Expectation Dimensions of the study, which are Usage 
Expectations, System and Data Expectations, Improvement 
Expectations and Managerial Expectations.  Table I lists 
what an end user may expect from a HIS. These 
expectations are constituted and presented to the literature to 
measure the expectation meeting ratios of HIS by a newly 
proposed evaluation framework for HIS [23].

C. Data 
Expectation Questionnaire is applied in a big hospital for 
data collection having 1700 (900-1000 online) HIS users. 
Volunteered HIS end-users in the hospital have 
participated in the study.   
III. 
METHODS 
A. Expectation Questionnaire 
Data are collected using the questionnaire method. The 
questionnaire, named as “Expectation Questionnaire”, is 
formed and used for collecting medical users’ perceived 
importance. For each expectation variable, a question is 
asked to capture the importance of that variable. Users are 
asked to express their importance weights using 5-point 
Likert scale (very important, important, average important, 
not so important, not important), ranging from 5 (very 
important) to 1 (not important).   
B. Analysis:  
The internal consistencies of the answers to the 
Expectation Questionnaire are measured by Cronbach´s 
Alpha coefficient, which is commonly used as a measure of 
the internal consistency or reliability [24].  Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences 19.0 (SPSS, SPSS Inc, 
Chicago, Illinois, USA) is used to compute Cronbach Alpha 
coefficient. Cronbach´s Alpha greater than 0.70 is 
considered reliable. 
Expectations are rank ordered in variable base for all 
users in the previous work; the results are given in Table III 
[14].  In this study, they are rank ordered for user assets 
under examination and the results are given in Table IV-
VIII.

W is the weight (1 to 5) of the Likert scale i, R is the number 
of answers given as that Likert scale and n is the total number 
of answers.  
IV. 
RESULTS 
660 questionnaires are passed out and 504 are returned by 
the users (response rate is 76.4%); 428 of them are 
completely filled without any missing importance rating.  
Cronbach´s Alpha coefficient, measuring the reliabilities 
(internal consistencies), is 0.871. It is apparently high and 
greater than 0.7, meaning the answers to the questions are 
internally consistent.  
The rank orders of the expectation variables are given in 
Table III. The top five ranked expectations are Availability, 
Speed, Bringing Positive Change, Ease of Use and User 
Support. The five least ranked expectations appeared to be 
Privacy, Help Manuals, Security, Research Facilities and 
Decision Support respectively from the least ranked. 
Tables IV – VIII give the least ranked five expectations

DISCUSSION 
In the previous work, it was seen that end-users of HIS 
have the high priority for the Usage Expectations [14]. Four 
of the top six rated expectations were the Usage 
Expectations variables. This was commented as “a HIS must 
be easy to use, easy to learn, fast and well supported to get 
users’ support and appreciation”.  
The surprising result was the least ranked five 
expectations, namely, Privacy, Security, Research Facilities 
and Decision Support. As stated in the introduction part, 
these are of great importance for HIS. In this study, user 
assets that may affect this surprising result are examined. 
Examination of the user titles’ influence shows us Privacy 
and Decision Support is ranked as the least in all titles. All 
the users independent of the title think these two properties 
of the system as the least important. This result is 
completely opposite of the literature. Nurses, Office 
Workers and Other titles ranked Research Facilities in the 
least five. Considering the number of the users in the 
groups, Office Workers and Others are very small to 
influence the complete result, so they can be assumed 
negligible for this variable. As for the Nurses, being the 
second biggest group with 140 users, it can be said that it 
was effective for the complete result. Research facilities of a 
HIS comprise useful tools for nursing informatics. This 
result can be interpreted as most of the participant nurses are 
not interested in research. 
Education asset does not give us any justification for the 
unexpected results. The great majority of the participants is 
university graduate (n = 378); so the least five of this group 
is identical with the general result.   
When we examine the effect of sex, it is seen that 
Privacy, Decision Support and Research Facilities are in the 
least five for both. But, Men users have difference in 
Security. For Security expectation, this group has influence 
on the general result when considering the large number 
with n = 183. 
In IS experience, Privacy, Security and Research 
Facilities are in the least five for all. Users defining 
themselves as having average and good IS experience have 
rated Decision Support as 4th and 5th least. That makes this 
expectation be in the least five in the general result.  
Privacy, Security and Research Facilities are in the least 
five according to the working unit for all assets. Only in 
Internal medicine and Surgical Medicine users’ ranking, 
Decision Support is in the five least ranked expectations. 
This is another surprising result; Decision Support is a 
powerful virtue of the HIS for surgeons especially to decide 
operation. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In summary, in the study it is clear that: 
 Nurse users have influence on Research Facilities  
 Men users have influence on Security,

 Users with average and good IS Experience have 
influence on Decision Support , 
 Users working in Surgical Medicine and Internal 
medicine have influence on Decision Support to be the least 
ranked in general result.  
Ironically, Privacy is in the least five in all of the 
examinations.   
The users’ assets, Title, Sex, IS Experience and Working 
unit have influence on the unexpected result.  The study 
shows perceived importance may change according to user 
profiles. Although the literature says these four expectations 
under study is indispensible virtue of the HIS, the users may 
think just the opposite.     
This study is one step forward for the investigation of 
these unexpected results opposite of the literature. But still 
we don’t have justifying explanation. Let alone justifying, 
more surprising findings are faced such as the surgeons 
thinking Decision Support less important.  The study should 
be deepened to analyze these results and get satisfying 
findings. These users groups under study may be further 
detailed and a hierarchical grouping can be made such as 
Nurses working in different units, users working in different 
units having different levels of IS experience etc.  
Another reason of these least ranked expectations may be 
related to the quality of the HIS used. If it is unable to give 
the basic virtues such as working without outage 
(availability) and fast processing (speed), the top perceived 
importance may appear as being basic usage expectations. 
This issue may also be further studied.
