Abstract—Event detection is a major application in wire-
less sensor networks (WSNs). Current Medium Access Control
(MAC) protocols for WSNs are mainly optimized for the situation
that an event generates only one data packet on a single
node and the event occurrence rate is low. When an event
generates multiple data packets or the event occurrence rate
is relatively high, packet delivery latency and delivery ratio are
degraded rapidly. In this paper, we present a new MAC protocol
called Multiple Packets Transmission MAC (MPT-MAC) for
event-based WSNs. MPT-MAC schedules multiple data packets
generated by an event on a single node to be forwarded over
multiple hops in an operational cycle. By this means, MPT-MAC
can achieve low delivery latency and high delivery ratio under
heavy trafﬁc loads. We use event delivery latency (EDL) and event
delivery ratio (EDR) to measure the event detection capability
of MPT-MAC protocol. We show the performance of MPT-MAC
through detailed ns-2 simulation. Compared to S-MAC-AL, R-
MAC and DW-MAC, MPT-MAC can achieve lower EDL and
higher EDR without more energy consumption. Furthermore,
MPT-MAC can obtain lower duty cycle than DW-MAC when
satisfying the latency requirement of the applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
With the development of wireless communication, embed-
ded computation and sensor technology, WSNs are used wide-
ly in applications including military, industry, agriculture and
environmental monitoring, and have been an active research
area in the past few years.
Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols control how the
wireless devices access the sharing wireless channel, being
fundamental protocols and key techniques in wireless sensor
networks. In the wireless MAC protocol used by wireless ad
hoc networks, such as IEEE 802.11[1], the wireless devices
must listen to the wireless channel in order not to miss
incoming packets, even when no packets are transmitted or
received. Idle listening consumes signiﬁcant energy[2]. There-
fore, traditional MAC protocols are not suitable for WSNs in
which sensor nodes are generally battery-powered.
To reduce energy consumption of idle listening, duty cy-
cling mechanism[3][4] has been introduced in wireless sensor
network MAC protocols. In duty cycling, each sensor node
follows a periodic active/sleeping schedule and the percentage
of time in the active state is called duty cycle. When a node
is active, it turns on its radio to transmit or receive data
packets. However, when sleeping, it turns off its radio to
save energy. Most of existing MAC protocols for WSNs adopt
duty cycling mechanism, such as S-MAC[4][5], T-MAC[6], R-
MAC[7], DW-MAC[8], B-MAC[3], X-MAC[9], RI-MAC[10]
and so on.
Event detection is among the major applications in wireless
sensor networks. Sometimes we need the long message to
describe the event. However, the cost of re-transmitting the
long message is very high. So when a node detects an
event, more than one small data packet may be generated to
describe the event. In addition, with more and more sensor
nodes deployed, multiple nodes may detect the events and
transmit data packets simultaneously. Current MAC protocols
for WSNs are mainly optimized for the situation that an event
generates only one data packets on a single node and the event
occurrence rate is low. Under such heavy trafﬁc loads, the
performance of existing MAC protocols degrades obviously.
In this paper, we present a new MAC protocol for event-
based WSNs, called MPT-MAC. MPT-MAC is a synchronous
duty cycle MAC protocol. It allows nodes to wake up to
communicate in sleep period and to continuously transmit
multiple data packets generated by an event. MPT-MAC can
achieve low delivery latency and high delivery ratio under
heavy trafﬁc loads. Furthermore, with the requirement of
the applications satisﬁed, MPT-MAC can obtain low duty
cycle to save energy and prolong the network lifetime. The
contributions of this work are as follows:
• Presenting a new MAC protocol MPT-MAC, that sched-
ules sensor nodes to continuously transmit multiple data
packets generated by an event.
• Analyzing the possibility of low duty cycle in MPT-MAC
when satisfying the requirements of applications.
• Using event delivery latency and event delivery ratio to
measure MPT-MAC.
• Evaluating MPT-MAC protocol using NS2 simulator and
comparing it with existing MAC protocols.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we discuss related work and analyze some synchronous
MAC protocols. Section III details the design of MPT-MAC.
In Section IV, we show results from our simulation-based
evaluation of MPT-MAC, including a comparison with existing

MAC protocols. Finally, Section V presents the conclusions.
II. RELATED WORK
Duty cycle MAC protocols can be classiﬁed into two
categories: synchronous and asynchronous. In synchronous
MAC protocols, all nodes need to be synchronized and wake
up simultaneously to transmit data packets, for example, S-
MAC, T-MAC, R-MAC, DW-MAC, and so on.
However, in asynchronous MAC protocols, all nodes decide
wake-up time according to their own schedules and need not
to be synchronized. Asynchronous protocols mainly include
B-MAC, X-MAC, RI-MAC, and so on. MPT-MAC presented
in this work is a synchronous duty cycle MAC protocol, so
we only discuss synchronous MAC protocols in this section.
S-MAC[4] was one of original synchronous duty cycle
MAC protocols for WSNs. Figure 1 shows an overview of
S-MAC. A cycle of S-MAC is composed of three periods:
SYNC, DATA and SLEEP. At the beginning of SYNC period,
the node wakes up to broadcast a SYNC packet to synchronize
neighbor nodes. In DATA period, if node A wants to send a
data packet to node B, they use RTS/CTS/DATA/ACK to com-
plete data transmission. After transmitting the packet, node A
and B turn to sleep. Node C without data communication will
turn off its radio to sleep at the beginning of SLEEP period.
In S-MAC, nodes periodically alternate between being
active and sleeping to reduce energy consumption of idle
listening. But in one operational cycle, a data packet can be
forwarded only one hop, so multi-hop transmission latency
will be greatly increased. Wei Ye et al. proposed S-MAC with
adaptive listening(S-MAC-AL)[5] to reduce data transmission
latency. As shown in Figure 1, if node C overhears CTS packet
from B to A, it will adaptively wake up after the transmission
between A and B is done. After node B received a data packet,
it will send an RTS to C. If C is the next hop of the data
packet, node B can immediately forward the data packet to C
and needs not to wait the next cycle. By adaptive listening, a
data packet can be delivered up to two hops in one operational
cycle.

Fig. 1: Schedule of S-MAC and S-MAC-AL
The duration time of DATA period in S-MAC and S-MAC-
AL is ﬁxed. Even though nodes have no data packets to com-
municate in the current cycle, they wait to sleep until DATA
period is ended. Nodes in WSNs have no data communications
in most of time, so idle listening of DATA period will waste
signiﬁcant energy. The ﬁxed DATA period is not suitable for
light trafﬁc load. T-MAC[6] is primarily designed to shorten
the DATA period when no trafﬁc is around the nodes, so that
nodes can preserve more energy. Its principle is that nodes go
to sleep if they cannot detect any speciﬁed events in TA. TA is
the minimum idle listening time of nodes in a cycle. Although
T-MAC can preserve more energy than S-MAC when there is
no trafﬁc, it also only delivers a packet up to two hops within
one operational cycle and cannot reduce multi-hop delivery
latency of data packets.
Some approaches are proposed to reduce deliver latency.
However, they make some speciﬁc assumptions on the com-
munication pattern. For example, D-MAC[11] reduces data
delivery latency only for data gathering tree. The streamlined
wakeup optimization proposed by Cao et al.[12] addresses
only the case in which each sensor node sends data to a
sink node. Lu et al.[13] discusses how to minimize end-to-
end delivery latency for a tree or a ring network.
R-MAC[7] introduces a new cross-layer approach to reduce
packet delivery latency in multi-hop forwarding. Figure 2
shows the schedule of R-MAC. RTS/CTS in S-MAC are
replaced by the pioneer frame (PION) of R-MAC. In an
operational cycle, PION is forwarded over multiple hops
during DATA period to inform nodes B and C when to wake
up to receive or transit the data packets during SLEEP period.
According to the number of hops carried in PION, nodes that
are on the data forwarding path calculate their wake-up time
during the SLEEP period using the equation (1).

Fig. 2: Multi-hop forwarding of R-MAC
The process of PION forwarding goes on till the DATA
period is over, so the number of hops over which R-MAC can
forward a data packet in a cycle is limited by the duration
of the DATA period. However, a source node (e.g., node A
in Figure 2) always starts transmitting a data packet at the
beginning of the SLEEP period, two hidden terminal nodes
that have succeeded in contending the channel in the DATA
period will cause collision at the following SLEEP period.
In order to resolve the collision between the hidden source
nodes at the SLEEP period, DW-MAC[8] uses one-to-one
mapping to schedule nodes to wake up. Figure 3 gives the
overview of the scheduling approach in DW-MAC. In this
example, node A wants to transmit a data packet to node B. A
ﬁrstly contends the channel and then transmits a SCH control
frame during the DATA period. Supposed that transmission
of SCH starts at T1 units after the beginning of the DATA
period and the duration of transmission is T3. Based on T1, T3,
the ratio between TSleep and TData and the equation (2), we
can calculate the wake-up time T2 from the beginning of the

SLEEP period of node A and B, and the maximum wake-up
duration T4. By one-to-one mapping function, data transmis-
sion during the SLEEP period will not collide. Furthermore,
DW-MAC uses cross-layer approach like R-MAC to reduce
multi-hop delivery latency.

Fig. 3: Overview of the schedule in DW-MAC
Although DW-MAC resolves the problem that the hidden
source nodes collide at the beginning of the SLEEP period, it
only schedules one data packet to forward during the SLEEP
period. If multiple data packets are generated by an event on
a single node, DW-MAC has to schedule nodes to transmit
data packets to the sink node in multiple operational cycles.
This increases the data packets delivery latency. In addition,
DW-MAC transmits SCH control frame for each data packet
and multiple SCHs waste more energy.
These MAC protocols propose several approaches to reduce
packet delivery latency. However, they are optimized for one
data packet of an event and low event occurrence rate. MPT-
MAC proposed in this paper can schedule multiple data pack-
ets generated by an event on a single node to be forwarded over
multiple hops in an operational cycle, so it can work well under
heavy trafﬁc loads, such as when an event generates multiple
data packets on a single node and the event occurrence rate is
very high.
III. MPT-MAC DESIGN
A. Overview
MPT-MAC is a synchronous duty-cycle MAC protocol.
Each operational cycle of MPT-MAC is also divided into
three periods: SYNC, DATA and SLEEP period. We denote
the duration of each period by TSync, TData and TSleep
respectively. Similar to prior works, MPT-MAC must use
synchronizing mechanisms[14][15] to resolve the clock drift
and ensure to synchronize the clock in sensor nodes.
The principle of MPT-MAC is that nodes are scheduled to
wake up during SLEEP period and to deliver multiple data
packets over multiple hops in an operational cycle. In order
to deliver multiple data packets, the receiver node that is
scheduled to wake up in the SLEEP period waits for a little
duration Twait after receiving a data packet. If the node does
not receive any data packet during Twait, it will go to sleep.
Figure 4 shows the example of multiple data packets trans-
mission in MPT-MAC. In this example, node A detects an
event and generates two data packets for this event. These
two packets need to be transmitted to node B. According to

Fig. 4: Multiple packets scheduling of MPT-MAC
the scheduling algorithm of MPT-MAC, node A and B wake
up to transmit the data packet at T1. Unlike DW-MAC, node
B will keep listening to the channel. If there are other data
packets in the A’s queue, Node A can transmit the data packet
D2 to B SIFS delay after receiving ACK for D1 from B. Once
A receives ACK for D2, A goes to sleep. However, node B
will wait for a little duration Twait after receiving D2. If B
doesn’t receive anything during Twait, it will go to sleep. As
described in the example, node A only needs one operational
cycle and one SCH frame to transmit two data packets to
B in MPT-MAC, but DW-MAC needs two operational cycles
and two SCH frames. With the number of the data packets
generated by an event on a node increasing, the number of
the operational cycles and the SCH frames needed by DW-
MAC will increase accordingly.
B. Wakeup Scheduling
MPT-MAC uses one-to-one mapping function to schedule
nodes to wake up intelligently, just like DW-MAC. Node A
that wants to transmit a data packet to node B contends the
wireless channel using CSMA/CA protocol in IEEE 802.11.
Once succeeding in contending the channel, node A will
transmit a special SCH frame (SCH includes all ﬁelds of
RTS/CTS and has the same function with RTS/CTS) that
replaces RTS control frame. Node B replies with a SCH frame
as CTS. Node A and B calculate their wake-up time Ti in the
SLEEP period using the equation (3) respectively.
T S
i = SDTR · T D
i
(3)
In the equation (3), we denote by SDTR =
TSleep
TData the
ratio between the duration of the SLEEP period and the
DATA period and by T D
i
the time difference between nodes
transmitting/receiving SCH frame and the beginning of the
DATA period.
As shown in Figure 5, in order to reduce multi-hop delivery
latency of data packets transmission, MPT-MAC uses cross-
layer approach to schedule multiple data packets to forward
over multiple hops in a cycle. In the example, node B will
send its own SCH frame after receiving a SCH frame from
the up hop node A. The SCH frame transmitted by node B
plays two roles: ﬁrstly, it is the ACK of node A’s SCH frame,
secondly, the next hop node C receiving B’s SCH frame uses
the mapping function in the equation (3) to calculate wake-up
time to receive data packets, so that multiple data packets can
be forwarded over multiple hops in an operational cycle.

C. Multiple Packets Transmission
We denote by TP the maximum time of a node occupying
the channel during the SLEEP period, if it succeeds transmit-
ting the SCH frame during the DATA period. According to the
equation (3) and Figure 5, the time of node A using the channel
without collision in the SLEEP period can be calculated by
the following equation:
TP

T S
2 − T S
1
=
SDTR · T D
2 − SDTR · T D
1
=
SDTR · (T D
2 − T D
1 )
=
SDTR · (TS + SIFS)
(4)
In DW-MAC, node A will go to sleep immediately after
transmitting data packet D1 in the time interval TP . However,
the communication latency u between two nodes is less than
TP in common. We denote u as the following equation (5):
u = durDATA + SIFS + durACK + SIFS
(5)
Therefore, MPT-MAC can transmit multiple data packets
in the time TP . In order to avoid collision between A’s
transmission and B’s, according to the equations (4) and (5),
the maximum number of data packets transmitted by node
A is Nmax = [ SDT R·(TS+SIF S)
u
]. Each node must maintain
a transmitting/receiving counter. The counter is added by 1
when the node transmits or receives a data packet.
When one of the following three situations happens, the
node does not transmit the data packets in the queue or receive
data packets any more, and goes to sleep:
1. The value of counter is equal with Nmax;
2. Nodes ﬁnd that the remain time of TP is less than u;
3. The receiver node cannot receive any data packet in
Twait, it turn to sleep. Because the sender node transmits
the next data packet SIFS delay after receiving ACK of
the previous data packet, we denote Twait = SIFS +
TMAX P RO DLY , where TMAX P RO DLY presents the
maximum propagation delay.
D. Low Duty Cycle
Duty cycle is denoted by the ratio between the active time
of a node and the cycle:
duty cycle =
TSync + TData
TSync + TData + TSleep
If a node has lower duty cycle, it will consume less energy
and the lifetime of the node is longer. However, low duty cycle
increases the sleep latency during the data packets forwarded.
The major challenge of MAC protocol design for WSNs is
how to tradeoff between low latency and energy consumption.
Compared with DW-MAC, MPT-MAC can schedule multi-
ple data packets to deliver multiple hops without collision in
an operational cycle, so it is possible for MPT-MAC to achieve
lower duty cycle than DW-MAC. We analyze the relationship
between the duty cycle and the data packets delivery latency,
when a node transmits two data packets in one hop in DW-
MAC and MPT-MAC. We give some following assumptions
in DW-MAC and MPT-MAC to simplify the analysis:
1. Nodes always generate data packets when waking up.
2. Nodes always succeed in contending the channel at the
same time TD.
3. Nodes have the same TSync and TData, so TListen =
TSync + TData.
4. The duration of one RTS/CTS handshake is t = 2 ·
durCtrl + SIFS. We use durCtrl to present the
duration of control packet transmission.
5. DW-MAC’s duty cycle is d, and MPT-MAC’s duty cycle
is k · d, where k is a constant.
According to the wake-up scheduling mechanism described
in subsection III-B, we can calculate the two data packets
deliver latency in one hop in DW-MAC and MPT-MAC
respectively:
DelayDW
=
T DW
Cycle + SDTRDW · T D + u
=
T DW
Cycle + TListen · (1 − d)
TData · d
· T D + u
=

TListen · (1 − kd)
TData · kd
· T D + 2 · u
=
T DW
Cycle ·
T D
TData
· 1 − kd
k
+ 2 · u
(7)
The difference between DelayDW and DelayMP T is given
by the following equation (8) according to the equations (6)
and (7):
DelayMP T − DelayDW
=
T DW
Cycle − u + T DW
Cycle ·
T D
TData
−1
k · T DW
Cycle ·
T D
TData
(8)
From the equation (8), as long as k satisﬁes the condition of
k ≥
T DW
Cycle·T D
(T DW
Cycle−u)·TData+T DW
Cycle·T D , the delivery latency of DW-
MAC will be greater than that of MPT-MAC, DelayDW ≥
DelayMP T . Obviously, T DW
Cycle is much greater than u, so
we can draw a conclusion
T DW
Cycle·T D
(T DW
Cycle−u)·TData+T DW
Cycle·T D < 1.
Therefore, when k is greater than a number less than 1, which
means the duty cycle of MPT-MAC is less than that of DW-
MAC, MPT-MAC will achieve lower data packets delivery
latency than DW-MAC.

IV. SIMULATION AND EVALUATION
A. Measure Metrics
For the event detection applications, packet delivery latency
(PDL) and packet delivery ratio (PDR) cannot reﬂect well
the capability of event detection in WSNs. Therefore we
introduce event delivery latency (EDL) and event delivery ratio
(EDR)[16].
• Event Delivery Latency. Supposed that Node S detects an
event at T0 and generates N data packets to describe the
event. The sink node R receives all data packets of the
event at T1, we denote EDL = T1 − T0.
• Event Delivery Ratio. EDR is the ratio between the events
succeeded in receiving by the sink node and the number
of the events detected by source nodes. Only if the sink
node receives all data packets of an event, we call that
the sink node succeeds in detecting this event.
To some extent, EDL and EDR can also reﬂect the network’s
PDL and PDR. EDL and EDR are more suitable for event-
based WSNs, because they reﬂect well the capability of event
detection.
B. Simulation Environment
We evaluate MPT-MAC using version 2.29 of the NS2
simulator and compare it with S-MAC-AL, R-MAC and DW-
MAC.
Table I lists the key network parameters used in our simula-
tions. These parameters are the default values in the S-MAC-
AL module distributed with NS-2 package. They are used also
in the simulations of R-MAC and DW-MAC. We ignore the
state transition power and energy consumed by other modules
such as CPU and memory[17].

Trafﬁc loads are generated by constant bit rate (CBR) ﬂows.
CBR can generate variable size data packets (50 bytes in com-
mon). So we can simulate the situation that an event detected
by a node generates multiple packets by setting UDP’s packet
size to 50 bytes. For example, if the data generated by CBR
is 100 bytes, UDP will send two data packets, which presents
a node generates two data packets when detecting an event.
Intermediate replying nodes do not aggregate or compress
data. We also assume that data processing at any node can
be ﬁnished within a SIFS duration, so data processing will
not introduce extra latency. The transmission latency of all
types of packets can be calculated by the equation (9), where
we choose 5 bytes for the preamble size p and 2 for channel
encoding ratio Encode Ratio in our simulations.

In order to evaluate the MPT-MAC’s performance under
lower duty cycle, we adopt variable duty cycle in MPT-MAC.
However, we keep the same duty cycle of 5% for other MAC
protocols. The duration of SYNC, DATA, SLEEP and duty
cycle are shown in Table III.
We use two types of scenarios for our simulations: chain
and grid network.
Figure 6 give an example of a chain scenario. All nodes
are equally spaced in a straight line and neighbor nodes are
placed 200 m apart to compose a chain. A CBR that generates
the event periodically is connected with node 0 as the source
node, and node n is the sink node. In our simulations, we use
21 nodes to compose the chain, so from the source node to
the sink node is 20 hops.

In the grid network scenario, the 7x7 grid network is
composed of 49 nodes. As shown in Figure 7, the x coordinate
and the y coordinate of each node are 200m apart. The sink
node locates the center of the grid network, and its coordinate
is (600, 600).
Fig. 7: 7x7 grid network
Based on a correlated-event workload[18], we use a Random
Correlated-Event (RCE)[8] to simulate random events. RCE
randomly selects a coordinate (x, y) and generate an event
there. If the sensing radius of a node is R, only the nodes can
detect the event within the circle centered at (x, y) with radius
R. With R increasing, more nodes will detect the event and
the trafﬁc loads become heavier. Table IV shows the average

Fig. 8: Average EDL in the 20-hops chain
For the 20-hops chain scenario, we evaluate the average
EDL when the number of data packets generated by an event
is from 1 to 8. In our simulations, the source node generates
an event per 50s. From Figure 8, we ﬁnd that the average EDL
of S-MAC-AL increases to 82.19197s when N = 4, and the
average EDL of R-MAC increases to 66.42565s when N = 5.
However, MPT-MAC’s average EDL doesn’t increase nearly
when N ≤ 6, and it only increases 20% when N ≥ 7. Because
MPT-MAC can schedule multiple data packets to deliver over
multi-hop in one operational cycle, when N ≥ 2, the average
EDL of MPT-MAC outperforms DW-MAC. Furthermore, in
the case of N = 8, the average EDL of MPT-MAC is 22.1s,
but the average of EDL of DW-MAC is 47.2s. MPT-MAC
reduces the average EDL over DW-MAC by 46.8%.
Figure 9 shows the results of our EDL evaluation for grid
network. In our simulations, we keep the sensing radius of
nodes 200m, RCE generates an event per 200s and the number
of data packets generated by the event is 1 to 8.

Fig. 9: Average EDL in the 7x7 grid network
From Figure 9 we can see that the average EDLs of S-MAC-
AL, R-MAC and DW-MAC all increase with the number of
data packets increasing. However, MPT-MAC’s average EDL
is about 7.9s when N ≤ 6. When N = 8, the average EDL
of MPT-MAC is 16.13227s, and DW-MAC is 73.59882s. The
average EDL of MPT-MAC is only 22% of DW-MAC.
D. Event Delivery Ratio Evaluation
In this subsection, we evaluate the event delivery ratio of
MPT-MAC. The number of data packets generated by an event
is 6 in the event deliver ratio evaluation.
In the chain scenario, only node 0 can generate events.
Consequently, in order to evaluate the EDR of MPT-MAC,
we adjust the event generating rate from an event per 50s to
an event per 15s.
Figure 10 shows the EDR of MAC protocols under the
different event generating rate. We can ﬁnd the EDRs of S-
MAC-AL and R-MAC are always less than 1, and when the
event generating rate reaches an event per 15s, the EDR of R-
MAC and S-MAC-AL signiﬁcantly reduces to 0.13 and 0.0945
respectively. The EDR of DW-MAC keeps 1 until the event
generating rate increases to an event per 25s. When the event
generating rate increases to an event per 20s, the EDR of
DW-MAC reduces to 0.8. And the EDR of DW-MAC is only
0.236 when generating an event per 15s. However, the EDR
of MPT-MAC always remains 1 until an event per 15s.

Fig. 10: EDR in the 20-hops chain
For the grid network, there are more nodes that detect the
event with the increase of the node’s sensing radius, so the
trafﬁc loads of the network is increased. Figure 11 shows the
results of the EDR evaluation for 7x7 grid network under the
different sensing range when RCE generates an event per 200s.
We ﬁnd that the EDR of S-MAC-AL and R-MAC is 0.083 and
0.156 respectively when the node’s sensing radius increases to
500m. When the node’s sensing radius is 500m, the EDR of
DW-MAC is 0.711, and the EDR of MPT-MAC still is about
0.9, which is 25% higher than that of DW-MAC.

E. Energy Consumption Evaluation
In this subsection, we evaluate the energy efﬁciency of
MPT-MAC. We vary the number of data packets generated
by an event on a single node from 1 to 8 in the chain
and grid network scenarios, and observe the average energy
consumption during the entire simulation.
Figure 12 shows the average energy consumption in the
chain scenario. When the number of data packets is increased,
the average energy consumption of S-MAC-AL and R-MAC
both increase. However, the average energy consumption of
DW-MAC and MPT-MAC increase slowly. Because less SCH
frames are transmitted in MPT-MAC than in DW-MAC, the
average energy consumption of MPT-MAC is always little
lower than DW-MAC. When an event generates 8 data packets
in a single node, the average energy consumption of MPT-
MAC is 5% less than DW-MAC.

Figure 13 shows the average energy consumption for 7x7

energy efﬁcient of MPT-MAC is as much as that of DM-MAC.
However, Figure 9 shows the average EDL of MPT-MAC is
much less than that of DW-MAC under this condition.

F. Duty Cycle Evaluation
According to the analysis in the subsection III-D, MPT-
MAC can achieve comparable or better EDL than DW-MAC
with 5% duty cycle. In this subsection, we evaluate the EDL
and the average energy consumption of MPT-MAC when it
adopts variable duty cycle from 2% to 5%, but the duty cycle
of DW-MAC keeps 5%. We only use 7x7 grid network to
evaluate the duty cycle of MPT-MAC. In our simulation, we
keep the sensing radius of 200m for MPT-MAC and DW-
MAC. RCE generates an event per 200s and each event
generates 6 data packets.

The average EDL of MPT-MAC with different duty cycle
is shown in Figure 14. We ﬁnd that the average EDL of MPT-
MAC remains about 10s when the duty cycle is less than 3.5%,
and the average EDL of MPT-MAC increase obviously when
the duty cycle is less than 3%. The average EDL of DW-MAC
is about 51.04s. Even though the duty cycle of MPT-MAC
reduces to 2%, the average EDL of MPT-MAC is 22.3s, that
is still about 50

Fig. 14: Average EDL of MPT-MAC with different duty cycle
From the results shown by Figure 14, we draw a conclusion
that the average EDL of MPT-MAC is much lower than that
of DW-MAC even when the duty cycle of MPT-MAC is only
2%. So it is possible for MPT-MAC to achieve higher energy
efﬁcient. Figure 15 shows that the average energy consumption
of MPT-MAC with 2% duty cycle is 8% less than that of
DW-MAC with 5% duty cycle. During the entire simulation,
in most of time nodes have data communications. When the
trafﬁc loads are ultra-light or even zero, lower duty cycle gains
higher energy efﬁcient.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented MPT-MAC, a new synchronous
duty cycle MAC protocol for event-based WSNs to reduce
event delivery latency and to increase event delivery ratio
under heavy trafﬁc loads. With the number of data packets
generated by an event on a single node and the event gen-
eration ratio increasing, MPT-MAC achieved lower EDL and
higher EDR than the existing MAC protocols without more
energy consumption. Furthermore, MPT-MAC with 2% duty
cycle achieved lower EDL than DW-MAC with 5% duty cycle,
which means that MPT-MAC can preserve more energy and
prolong the lifetime of the WSNs.
