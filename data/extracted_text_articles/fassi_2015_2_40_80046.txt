Abstract—With a rising demand for developing deep sea 
resources recently, that for offshore plant construction are 
getting greater. Accordingly, plant owners request more for a 
safety management system in the process of offshore plant 
building. Thus, it is required that a safety management system 
is built for each shipyard or offshore plant building project. In 
order to develop a safety management system, it is important 
that risk factors in each task should be properly identified. 
Most information with respect to work processes or risk 
factors can be commonly applicable. But, most of the safety 
management system is developed upon an assumption that 
such information is implicitly inherent within the system. In 
this respect, to ensure that the key information, such as task 
and hazard information for building safety management 
system is not inherent within the system, we defined XML 
(eXtensible Markup Language) Schema to ensure that such 
information can be expressed in standardized-format XML. By 
doing so, even if risk and work process contents change, XML 
files can be used after redefined - without changing safety 
management logic of a relevant system.  
Keywords-safety;shipbuilding;XML Schema; hazard; risk. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The shipbuilding industry refers to ship building and 
repair sectors. The industry is regarded as one of the most 
dangerous sectors. Accordingly, safety management is 
essential task of project management in shipbuilding industry. 
This 
promoted 
consistent 
efforts 
for 
technology 
advancement concerning shipbuilding processes, facilities 
and equipment. Still, today most of tasks at shipyards are 
labor-intensive and requires the specialized, highly skilled. 
In addition, shipbuilding tasks are mostly performed 
outdoors, largely influenced by air temperature, climate and 
other atmospheric environmental factors. Relevant working 
conditions change constantly. In order to improve safety 
management, such real workplace environment changes 
should be reflected in a safety management system promptly. 
Nonetheless, the current safety management framework is 
featured by policy aspects covering safety management 
manuals, safety training for workers and supervision by 
safety management supervisors. For this reason, proper 
safety management is not undertaken effectively reflecting 
actual situations for each worker [1]. In an effort to address 
this problem, studies are carried out from various 
technological perspectives. First of all, there is a study 
striving to improve the current safety management 
framework by monitoring workers’ safety utilizing building 
information modeling (BIM) [2], virtual reality [3] and 
augmented reality [4]. Also, there is an endeavor to enhance 
workplace monitoring technology in terms of worker 
location monitoring technologies [5]-[8]. Another approach 
is to improve safety management system in terms of risk 
analysis-based risk assessment model and related supporting 
system to prevent accidents [9][10]. While, in terms of safety 
management logic, it is important that risk factors in each 
task should be properly identified. This information can be 
accumulated empirically. Only some processes differ related 
to what is produced in the same domain. Accordingly, most 
information with respect to work processes or risk factors 
can be commonly applicable. But, most of the safety 
management system is developed upon an assumption that 
such information is implicitly inherent within the system. In 
this aspect, we defined XML Schema to ensure that this 
information is not inherent within the system but explicitly 
expressed in standardized format XML. By defining work 
process or risk factor information in XML files based on 
XML Schema, our approach allows to promptly reflect real-
time workplace situations and be made use of by various 
shipyards or other industrial sites not modifying the logic of 
safety management systems. The rest of this paper is 
organized as follows. Several related researches are 
presented in Section II. Section III presents the XML schema 
for implementing the safety management system. Section IV 
presents XML files as examples based on the XML schema. 
The paper concludes with future work and conclusions in 
Section V. 
II. 
RELATED RESEARCHES 
In the existing approach for developing safety 
management frameworks, risks are identified through 
meetings between safety managers and task managers using 
plans, accident cases and empirical information, etc. These 
risks do not sufficiently reflect changing situations in real 
worksites. For these reasons, some visualization techniques, 
such as BIM, game technologies, virtual reality, and 
augmented reality have been utilized to improve the current 
safety management practices. In this respect, there is a study 
performing 6-day cycle safety plan through 3D modeling of

the working environment [11]. In addition, there is also an 
approach offering a framework providing pre-designed 
virtual project site model in safety management system, for 
risk identification [12]. Also, there is another approach 
proposing rule-based safety checking system for falls based 
on 4D BIM [13]. These researches are a part of visualization 
technologies for workplace. On the other hand, there are 
studies about monitoring technologies of real-time locations 
of workers in workplace. In order to prevent accidents, there 
is a study using RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) 
technologies to track workers’ location in real-time [14]. 
Also, there is an approach that combines wireless 
communication systems with sensors not using tagging 
technologies, such as RFID in order to detect moving objects 
[15]. Its focus is to identify the accurate location of moving 
workers and objects to prevent accidents. Also, there are 
studies about risk identification and assessment. Most of risk 
identification and assessment relies on experiences and 
expertise of safety management experts or work managers. A 
study was carried out concerning tools and evaluation 
models to assist such risk assessment processes [16].

XML SCHEMA FOR IMPLEMENTING SAFETY 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
A. Definition of data relationship for building safety 
management system 
First of all, we should consider relationship among data 
that is necessary for building safety management system as 
shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1.  Data relationship for safety management system 
As shown in Figure 1, most of accidents at shipbuilding 
sites are closely related with a task undertaken. Accordingly, 
a relationship is formed focusing on such task information. 
As hazard factors exist according to the characteristics of 
task, task information is related to those factors. As regards 
prerequisite task like equipment checking carried out before 
each task may not be considered as individual task but 
simply as part of a preparation process. Still, since such task 
can entail hazard factors, a relationship about prerequisite 
task should also be factored into. Then, each task is 
performed in a specific zone. This means the features of the 
zone can influence hazard factors and a relationship is also 
established with zone information. Furthermore, as climate 
or other outside environmental conditions can also serve as 
major hazard factors depending on in which area what task is 
done, such a relationship should also be taken into account. 
Especially, in shipbuilding sites, as large-sized objects are 
handled in a limited space, different processes of work may 
be performed adjacently in parallel. In this regard, hazard 
factors of each task can have an impact on adjoining zones, 
which requires relevant consideration. Hazard factors 
identified from each perspective can vary ranging from: 
those related to work materials and equipment; those in an 
aspect of workplace management; to those from wrong 
human behaviors. Ultimately, as the goal of safety 
management system is to prevent accidents, it is required to 
identify incident factors triggered by each hazard factor, and 
formulate and define incident prevention measures from the 
relationship between hazard factors and task. 
B. XML Schema for defining the relationship between 
Task and Hazard 
It is necessary to define the kinds of specific information 
required for each information listed in the previous section. It 
is important to define data structure and relationship in a 
standardized format utilizing XML formats - a standardized 
markup language expressing rule sets for data encoding. In 
this term, the definition rules for specific information - 
necessary for developing safety management system logic – 
are defined in XML Schema. Figure 2 illustrates definition of 
XML Schema for representing task information.

Figure 2.  The XML Schema for task information 
As shown in Figure 2, in order to express task 
information, we classified task information into task ID, task 
code number, task name, and prerequisite task. Task code 
number is assigned to each task for easy identification in 
safety management logic. The code number list should be 
managed in a separate file and adjusted according to 
individual projects and shipyard situations. Task name 
represents a textual name for each task. Prerequisite task is a 
preparatory work performed before main task.

Based on the classification, in order to represent a list of 
task information, we declared <tasklist> element as the 
topmost element in the XML Schema. The element 
<tasklist> contains the <taskitem> element to represent each 
task as shown in Figure 2. The element <taskitem> 
comprises the <item> element and the <prerequisitetask> 
element. The element <item> is used to show the task name 
and task code number. The <taskcode> element reflects the 
task code number of each task and shall be supplied in the 
format of 3 alphanumeric characters. The <prerequisite task> 
element shall be used to represent the task which should be 
performed before main task of the <task> element. Since one 
or more prerequisite tasks shall be existed, we defined the 
value 
of 
‘maxOccurs’ 
value 
as 
‘unbounded’. 
The 
<prerequisitetask> element shall be represented using the 
<item> element. 
Then, although hazard information is closely related with 
other information, we defined XML Schema elements for 
hazards to contain information for the hazard itself to 
exclude overlap of information. Figure 3 shows the XML 
schema for representing hazard information.  
First of all, we classified hazard information into hazard 
ID, hazard code number, hazard name, hazard type, causes of 
incident, and hazard zone.  
Hazard code number is assigned to each hazard for easy 
identification in safety management logic. The code number 
list should be managed in a separate file and adjusted 
according to individual projects and shipyard situations. 
Hazard name represents a textual name for each hazard. 
Hazard type represents hazard factors identified from each 
perspective. Causes of incident represent causes of an 
incident by the hazard. Hazard zone is required for 
representing the specific zone that can be affected by the 
hazard.  
Based on the classification, in order to represent a list of 
hazard information, we declared <hazardlist> element as the 
topmost element in the XML Schema. The element < 
hazardlist> contains the <hazard> element to represent each 
hazard as shown in Figure 3. The element <hazard> contains 
the <hazarditem> element. The <hazard> element contains 
<hazardcode>, <hazardname>, and <hazardzone>. It also 
comprises the ‘cause’ attribute and the ‘seriousness’ attribute. 
The <hazardcode> element reflects the hazard code number 
of each hazard and shall be supplied in the format of 3 
alphanumeric characters. The <hazardname> element 
reflects the hazard name. In case the hazard occupies the 
fixed spot, the <hazardzone> element reflects the spot of 
hazard. The ‘cause’ attribute reflects causes of incident and 
can be  one value of “Falls from height”, "Slips", "Trips", 
"Hit something fixed/stationary", "Hit by moving/falling 
object", "Struck by something", and "Collapse".  
Next, to represent relationships between a task and 
hazards, task code number, hazard code number, prevention 
measures and seriousness can be used. The hazard code 
number is the hazard which can be occurred by the task. The 
prevention measures reflect measures that prevent incidents 
that arise from hazards. The seriousness represents degrees 
of the seriousness of the incident. Figure 4 shows the XML 
Schema for representing relationships between a task and 
hazards information.

First, in order to represent a list of mapping information 
between a task and hazards, we declared <taskhazardlist> 
element as the topmost element in the XML Schema. The 
element < taskhazardlist> contains the <taskhazard> element 
to represent each mapping information as shown in Figure 4. 
The <taskhazard> element contains the <taskcode> element 
and the group element <hazardprevention>. The group 
element <hazardprevention> comprises the <hazardcode> 
element and the <preventionmeasure> element. The 
<preventionmeasure> element contains the <actionitem> 
element that reflects an action item for preventing each 
hazard. The ‘seriousness’ attribute can be a number from “1” 
to “4”.

CONCLUSIONS 
In order to ensure that the key information, such as task 
and hazard information for building safety management 
system is not inherent within the system but explicitly 
expressed in standardized format XML, we defined XML 
Schema to express such data in standardized XML formats. 
Based on it, diverse data of existing systems can be 
integrated and interoperated in standardized format for the 
safety management system. In the future, it is essential to 
conduct studies on how to integrate with a variety of existing 
systems on the basis of defined XML files. It is also required 
to develop a framework for the safety management system 
that can be integrated with existing process management 
systems.
