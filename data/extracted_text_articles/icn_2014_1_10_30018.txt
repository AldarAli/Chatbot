Abstract—As
modern wireless access networks are moving
towards packet based wireless access one may expect mobile
cellular telephony to be eventually replaced by voice-over-IP
(VoIP) applications. The choice of the codec in these applications
is not straightforward as packet-based power-aware wireless
communications bring new factors into the play. We study
interdependencies between the bitrate, energy consumption, and
the perceived quality provided by the voice codecs. We show that
it is sufﬁcient to equip a software with three codecs only. These
are G.729.E, G.711.1 and G.723.1 codecs. Among those, G.723.E
provides the best trade-off between the involved factors. When
the system is overloaded and/or the power consumption is the
most important metric (i.e., a mobile is running out of power)
G.723.1 provides the best possible capacity and energy savings
at the expense of signiﬁcant quality degradation. Finally, when
the system is underloaded while the amount of power spent for
running the service is not important G.711.1 provides the best
possible heard quality at exceptionally high power consumption.
Keywords-VoIP, energy conservation, codec, perceived quality.

INTRODUCTION
With the current generation of cellular wireless access
technologies offering a wideband packet-based access over the
air interface it is expected that voice-over-IP (VoIP) applica-
tions will be responsible for most part of the voice trafﬁc.
Although the full transition has yet to be made due to slow
uptake of IP multimedia subsystem (IMS), forcing operators
to use intermediate solutions such as circuit-switching fallback
(CSFB), it will happen sooner than later or the customers may
start moving towards third-party VoIP applications. the topic
of perceived quality evaluation of VoIP codecs has been the
subject of the study in [1], [2], and [3] among others. However,
the main aim of this investigation is to describe the effect of
loss correlation etc.
However, in addition to ﬁnalizing the convergence to-
wards a uniﬁed all-IP multi-service network, this transition
brings additional challenges to software developers. One of
the choices that we need to make when developing a VoIP
software is the type of the codec to use. The choice of the
voice codec is more complicated in wireless environment as in
addition to perceived quality provided to the user, one needs to
take into account additional additional factors, such as power
consumption and bitrate. There are a number of reasons for
that. First of all, the uptime of mobile devices depends on
their battery power that is evidently not growing at the pace
of communication technologies implying that the chosen codec
must be as energy efﬁcient as possible. Secondly, wireless
technologies are more prone to occasional packet losses that
may affect the perceived quality provided by codecs differently.
Indeed, when a codec with high compression ratio is used the
amount of bandwidth required from the network is minimized
while the data ﬂow becomes very sensitive to packet losses.
Conversely, for low compression ratios the bitstream is less
sensitive to packet losses while the amount of required band-
width becomes signiﬁcant. Recall that the compression ratio
affects the amount of energy required for both compression
and transmission. Further, although the bitrate of most codecs
are fairly low compared to the available capacity of modern
cellular technologies, minimizing it is still an important issue
for network operators, especially, in densely population areas.
Finally, in those applications where the type of the codec
is allowed to be changed on-the-ﬂy we are interested which
codec maximizes a certain characteristic that can be important
for current operational regime of a mobile. For example, when
the battery of a mobile is running out of power while the voice
session is currently ”on” we are interested in maximizing the
battery lifetime at the expense of slightly degraded quality.
Indeed, for a given wireless access technology, a certain codec
is characterized by a certain amount of power consumption
required for transmission. At the same time, the amount of
energy required for compression depends on the hardware
conﬁguration only. Using codecs with different compression
ratio affects both components differently. We will see that for
WLAN technology these components are comparable making
the choice of the optimal codec less obvious. Considering the
abovementioned interdependencies, choosing the appropriate
codec minimizing energy consumption of a device and maxi-
mizing quality provided to the user is a complex task.
In this paper, we carry out an in-depth study of interde-
pendencies between the perceived quality measured by the
objective performance metrics, energy consumption spent for
encoding and transmission, and bitrate of the codec in wireless
environment. Both of these metrics are modulated by two
factors that are conventionally assumed to be independent of
each other. These are the type of the codec and loss behavior
of a channel. Our major ﬁnding are as follows (i) for adaptive
systems G.729.E, G.711.1 and G.723.1 are sufﬁcient to cover
all regimes of a mobile (ii) for conventional regime of a mobile

G.729.E provides the best trade-offs between perceived quality,
total energy consumption and the required bitrate (iii) for high-
quality service one needs to use G.711.1 at the expense of
exceptionally high total power consumption, (iv) in energy
saving regime G.723.1 provide some rather insigniﬁcant per-
formance gains over G.729.E. Also, it is important to note
that all the studied codecs, except for plain a/µ-law G.711, are
characterized by similar response to the packet losses implying
that the best codec after compression remains the best after
any amount packet losses. Finally, for IEEE WLANs, under a
certain choice of parameters, the amount of energy spent for
encoding is comparable to transmission power implying that
the choice of the optimal codec depends on a given technology.
In particular, G.729.E is no longer the optimal codec when
operating in IEEE WLAN environment.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
introduce the QoE metric we use in this paper. In Section III,
we numerically evaluate those trade-offs involved in our study.
Discussion on the optimal choice of the codec is provided in
Section IV. Conclusions are given in the last section.
II.
PERCEIVED QUALITY METRIC
Quality of VoIP codecs is evaluated at the application
layer using speciﬁc tests developed for assessing the perceived
speech quality. To perform these tests a number of methods
have been suggested in the past. We distinguish between
subjective and objective tests. Those tests involving surveying
humans are called subjective tests. Objective tests are based
on deriving applications layer performance metrics based on
network performance parameters. These tests try to provide
the relationship between network performance and subjective
QoE metric.
Subjective metrics assessing quality of voice communica-
tions are mostly based on the mean opinion score (MOS) scale.
MOS provides numerical indication of the quality of the voice
after compression and/or transmission. The value of MOS is a
number ranging from 1 to 5 with 5 corresponding the the best
possible quality. MOS is estimated by averaging the results of
a set of subjective tests, where a number of humans grade the
heard audio quality of test sentences.
The widely recognized objective metric for VoIP appli-
cations is deﬁned in the so-called E-model standardized by
ITU-T [4]. According to E-model the psychoacoustic speech
quality is deﬁned as a non-linear additive function of different
impairments. The measure of the quality is called an R-factor
which is given by
R = R0 − Is − Id − Ie + A,
(1)
where R0 represents noise and loudness in terms of the signal-
to-noise ratio at 0dBr point, Is accounts for impairments oc-
curring simultaneously with speech, Id represents impairments
that are delayed with respect to speech, Ie is the effect of
special equipment, A is the advantage factor. Simply put, Id
is the delay of a packet, encoding impairments are included in
Is, while the compression and network losses are in Ie. The
advantage factor accounts for special environments, where a
user may sacriﬁce the quality with respect to availability of the
service. The value of R-factor varies in between 0 and 100.

Parameterizing the model we see that the advantage factor
should nowadays be set to 0 as users get accustomed to
wireless voice services. Following the work of Clark in [5],
the highest possible value of R0 − Is is set to 94 resulting in
reduced expression R = 94 − Id − Ie setting the upper bound
on the perceived quality. VoIP routes in the Internet are usually
provisioned such that the end-to-end delay impairment factor,
Id, is less than the maximum tolerable delay (150 − 200ms,
[7]). In this case the quality of speech transmission is domi-
nated by Ie, i.e., R = 94−Ie. The effect of Ie has been found
using extensive subjective tests.
The performance of E-model was shown to correlate well
with MOS grades under assumption of independent packet
losses. In wireless networks, there are various mechanisms
trying to remove the memory of the channel (e.g., interleaving).
In wired Internet the major source of memory is droptail
queuing. However, random earlier detection (RED) is gradually
replacing droptail in the wired Internet making the packet loss
process uncorrelated. Thus, the packet loss process in wireless-
cum-wired conﬁguration can be considered memoryless imply-
ing that there are no signiﬁcant grouping of packet losses. It is
important to note that this assumption can be relaxed whenever
appropriate. For our work taking into account the effect of loss
correlation would result in unnecessary increase of complexity
and may hide the main message of the study.

INTERDEPENDENCIES
A. Rate requirements
Raw bitrates of codecs are shown in Fig. 1. It should be
noted that some codecs have variable bit rates. For such codecs,
we show only one of their data rates and the corresponding
bandwidth. All the metrics we consider in what follows are
calculated with respect to IP packet, i.e., energy consumption
is expressed as mW per IP packet while rate is in IP packets
per second.
The actual amount of data generated by a voice codec per
sampling interval can be represented as S = H + P, bytes,
where H is header size and P is the payload of voice packets.
Further, denoting by the R the number of packets emitted per
second and by the bandwidth, B, required for transmission is
calculated as B = S∗R KBps. Thus, to estimate the bandwidth
of a codec we need to know how much overhead, H, is
added to the payload of a codec. When compressed real-time
transport protocol (cRTP) is not used the IP/UDP/RTP headers
amount up to 40 bytes due to the following components (i) IP
header, 20 bytes, (ii) UDP header, 8 bytes, RTP, 12 bytes. In

those cases, when cRTP is used, the 40 bytes overhead reduced
to just 2 bytes. In case of Ethernet, there will be additional 18
bytes that includes frame check sequence (FCS) and cyclic
redundancy check (CRC) headers.
Fig. 2 shows the differences in bandwidth usage for dif-
ferent wireless access technologies and Ethernet. The payload
size for these codecs changes between 10 and 80 bytes with
step of 10 bytes. We see that the Ethernet imposes the highest
bandwidth usage. Further, observe that the bandwidth require-
ments for all wireless access technologies presented here grow
exponentially fast as the amount of payload increases. Out of
all considered technologies EDGE requires the highest amount
of bandwidth. The amount of bandwidth required by Wi-Fi
and and Wi-Max technologies is comparable. LTE and UMTS
requires the same amount of bandwidth and introduce the
minimum overhead.
B. Energy consumption
1) Transmission energy: In wireless communications, the
transmission power is different in different modes of op-
eration. Conventionally, we distinguish between idle, sleep,
transmission, and reception states. Here, we are interested
in two of them, namely, transmission and reception states.
Notices that it has been shown that that energy consumption
in idle and receive states are almost the same [8]. The only
difference between them is the amount of power spent by
amplifying the received signal in receiving states. However,
usually this energy is signiﬁcantly smaller compared to that
one required for transmission. Thus, we concentrate on the
power consumption in transmission mode only.
Fig. 3 presents the power consumption measured in mW
per packet for different wireless access technologies in log-
arithmic scale. As one may observe the difference between
power consumption of wireless access technologies available
today could be as high as two orders of magnitude proving
the importance of choosing an appropriate radio interface and
transmission technology one-the-ﬂy. Another observation is
the importance of choosing codecs. Indeed, different codecs
produce their outputs in a wide range of data rates. Particularly,
as we already observed the raw data rate ranges from 5.3Kbps
for G.723.1 to 64kbps for G.722 or G.711.
2) Encoding energy: The energy spent for encoding varies
with the type of the codec and its special features. Unfor-
tunately, the actual energy depends on the type of a digital
signal processor used for encoding. One way to provide

hardware independent estimates of the encoding complexity
is to calculate the amount of operations required for encoding.
Fig. 4 shows raw bitrate and complexity of voice codecs
measured in millions operations per second (MIPS), where
codecs are sorted in descending order of their bitrates. We see
that the general trend is increase of the complexity in response
to smaller bitrates. At one extreme there are G.711 and
G.711.1 codecs having 64Kbps raw rates and requiring very
small processing power (0.01mW for G.711 and 0.025mW for
G.711.1 on C55x processors family). There are exceptionally
complex codecs such as G.729.1 and G.722.2 requiring low
raw rates. However, there are some exceptions, such as G.727,
G.729 Annex A, and G.723.1 codecs characterized by rather
low rates and moderate encoding power consumptions.
Investigations done in this paper show that the range of
encoding energy for these codecs varies from below 1mW
(G.711 with C55X) per packet to something around 12mW
in some cases. Encoding power consumption for several pro-
cessors is shown in Fig. 5. Note that for some codecs the
amount of power required for encoding is comparable to the
amount of power required for wireless access technologies. For
example, the most complex codec G.729.1 running at C54x
architecture requires a power of approximately 12mW, which
is more than the amount of energy required for transmission

over LTE in CLSM regime (approximately 9mW). On the other
hand, low complexity codecs, such as G.711, G.711.1 requires
exceptionally small amount of energy at all platforms. Note
that the choice of the processor, plays an extremely important
role and the difference in the encoding power could be as high
as several mW. This difference becomes bigger as we go from
low complexity codecs to the high complexity ones.
C. Perceived quality
Recall that the reduced E-model is given by R = 94 − Ie.
The only unknown we have is Ie, which is the effective
equipment impairment factor taking into account the effect of
voice compression and network losses. Ie values for a number
of considered codecs are summarized in Fig. 6 [6]. These
values represent the perceived quality after compression and
do not take into account the effect of packet losses introduced
by the transmission medium. Recalling that R factor 94 is
the maximum possible value achieved with G.711 while 70
is the minimum acceptable one the set of codecs available
today provides the perceived quality across the whole range
of acceptable quality.

Fig. 7 shows the values of impairment factors for a
number of codecs for different values of the packet loss ratio
(PLR, measured in percents). As one may observe almost all
impairments factors Ie are linear functions of PLR. One of
consequence of this behavior is that if the perceived quality is
the only metric of interest then the choice of the best codec
is independent of the packet loss ratio. In other words, the
codec providing the best performance in absence of losses will
remain the best one for any value of PLR. The only exception
is G.711 codec without packet loss concealment feature whose
performance severely degrade when PLR increases.

OPTIMAL CHOICE OF THE CODEC
Consider how the amount of energy spent for compression
is related to the power required for transmission. We would
like to check whether there are special codecs minimizing the
overall power consumption. The amount of power for different
processor families required for encoding and transmission
is shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. As one may observe the
transmission power for codecs is generally way larger than the
energy required for compression. One special exception is Wi-
Fi access technology operating with high TTI values, where
these two sources of energy consumption are comparable for
some codecs. Thus, in VoIP applications, for most wireless
technologies transmission power dominates the overall power
consumption.

So far, we have seen that the trade-offs between perceived
quality and energy required for running the service can be
complicated. Putting all of these parameters together and
viewing the results in one ﬁgure would be helpful. Fig. 10
shows total power consumptions of voice codecs per one
second interval for C54x processor architecture (recall, that
out of all considered platforms C54x requires the most power
for encoding). Corresponding Ie values and R factors after
compression are shown in Fig. 11. Assume for a moment that
the bitrate of the codec is not a concern, i.e., the channel
capacity is large enough to accommodate the one with the
highest bitrate (G.711 or G.711.1). Even in this case, the choice
of the codec optimizing both the total energy consumption and
the perceived quality is still non-trivial. If one is targeting
the best possible perceived quality G.711.1 is the obvious
choice providing the maximum possible value of R-factor
after compression. However, the amount of power spent for
encoding and transmission is extremely high amounting to
approximately 1250mW for UMTS and 1100mW for LTE
CLSM. Energy requirements of G.711 is signiﬁcantly smaller

(approximately 750mW for LTE CLSM and 900mW for
UMTS) while the perceived quality is kept at the same level.
Using G.711 instead of G.711.1 in loss-free environment
would allows for save 350mW for both technologies. Assum-
ing the average length of a conversation being equal to 300
seconds (5 minutes) it would result in approximately 100W
energy savings. This implies additional 140 seconds of a VoIP
call over LTE CLSM or approximately 116 seconds for UMTS
VoIP call. However, these are not the best possible energy
savings one may achieve. G.729.E codec providing R-factor
of 90 while requires around 300mW of energy operating in
LTE CLSM and UMTS networks. These signiﬁcant additional
energy savings compared to G.711 (approximately 450mW
for LTE CLSM and 600mW for UMTS) comes at just slight
decrease of quality (R-factor 90 compared to 94 for G.711).
Further, taking into account the the data rate of G.729.E
codec is just 12.5Kbps this codec is far superior compared to
both G.711 and G.711.1. Energy consumption of of G.729.E
codec is comparable to G.726 operating at 32Kbps data rate
except for slightly worse R-factor (87 instead of 90). When
energy is the most important metric (i.e., power of a mobile
is running out) the best possible codec is G.723.1 operating
at 5.3 Kbps data rate providing R value 75. This codec is
especially useful for those wireless technologies characterized
by small transmission energy requirements, i.e., IEEE 802.11
WLANs. However, as one may notice G.726 codec operating
at 32Kbps provides signiﬁcantly better quality (R-factor 87
compared to 79 for G.723.1). For energy saving regime the
latter is advisable.
As we already highlighted, Wi-Fi operating with TTI 1200
is a special example of a wireless technology, where the energy
consumption for compression is compared to that required for
transmission. Observing Fig. 10 we see that the total power
consumption for C54x processor family and Wi-Fi with TTI
1200 has a behavior different from other technologies. In fact,
G.729.E codec is no longer the one providing one of the
best trade-offs between the perceived quality and total power

consumption for zero PLR. G.711 codec outperforms G.729.E
in terms of total power consumption providing better perceived
quality (7.5mW and R value 94 instead of 10mW and R
value 90 for G.729.E). Moreover, G.726 codec operating at
24Kbps is even more (almost twice) energy efﬁcient providing
5.5mW of total power consumption while delivering R value
of 90. Note that similar conclusions are true for Cortex-M3
family while C64x family is closer to C55x performance with
transmission energy dominating the total power consumption
(not shown here). The choice of the optimal codec is more
complex when the amount of energy for transmission and
compression is comparable.
So far, we considered the trade-off between the amount
of energy required for running the service and the perceived
quality provided to the user. These factors are often enough
when the system is well below its capacity limits. However,
when it is about to overﬂow one also need to take into
account the rate requirements of codecs as slight overload
may lead to extreme quality degradation for all the users.
When choosing the best possible codecs for these conditions
one needs to take into account three factors simultaneously:
rate requirements, perceived quality, and energy consumption.
Taking another look at Fig. 10 and recalling data from Fig.
1 we see that G.729.E is still the best codec optimizing

these three parameters simultaneously (12.5 Kbps, R value
90, 400mW LTE CLSM and UMTS). G.728 operating at 16
Kbps, is characterized by comparable R value (87) but requires
signiﬁcantly more energy (approximately, 800mW and 900mW
for LTE CLSM and UMTS for C54x, respectively). Similarly,
G.726 operating at 32Kbps has slightly higher power require-
ments and comparable R value but requires approximately
three times more bandwidth. When the system is severely
overloaded G.723.1 operating at 5.3 Kbps is the best possible
choice from the rate requirements perspective (more than twice
better than G.729.E). However, its perceived quality is close
to unacceptable (R value 79).
Consider now what happens when the PLR increases. Fig.
12 shows the values of R-factor and corresponding values
of MOS for six selected codecs (computed according to the
closed-form expression provided in [9]) for a number of codecs
for different values of the packet loss ratio. Surprisingly, the
choice of the VoIP codec jointly optimizing the considered
three factors (rate/energy/quality) is independent of the value
of PLR as response of the considered codecs to PLR is
qualitatively and quantitatively similar. One exception is the
very special behavior of G.711 codec without PLC capabilities
whose R value decreases exponentially fast as PLR increases.
This codec should never be used in lossy environments such as
wireless access. Also, as one may observe, there is an intersec-
tion between lines corresponding to G.729.A and G.723.1 (5.3
Kbps) codecs, i.e., up to PLR of approximately 2.5% G.723.1
performs slightly better than G.729.A, while for higher value
of PLR G.729.A outperforms G.723.1. This implies that if ones
originally uses G.723.1, as PLR increases one needs to change
to G.729.A. However, the region where G.729.A outperforms
G.723.1 is below MOS 3.5, which is widely accepted as the
minimum acceptable quality. Thus, in most cases, the choice of
the best codec for non-zero value of PLR (after compression)
coincides with the chose made for any non-negligible PLR.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we examined trade-offs between quality of
user experience, compression, and energy consumption for
VoIP applications in wireless environment. As opposed to
many studies exploring ways to minimize energy consumption
of mobile devices we concentrated on the time period when
a media application is up and running and studied the way
how decrease the amount of energy required for running VoIP
service while maintaining the best possible quality provided to
the use. This study was motivated by availability of multiple
codecs for voice and video information characterized by a wide
diversity of compressed data rates and compression algorithms.
Summarizing, we note that the choice of the VoIP
codec
jointly
optimizing
the
considered
three
factors
(rate/energy/quality) is rather straightforward with only small
deviations in the special cases. The reasons are (i) inde-
pendence of the choice of the codec from packet losses
(ii) domination of transmission energy requirements in total
power consumption for most considered technologies (iii) one
codec being signiﬁcantly superior than others (G.729.E). From
energy/quality/rate joint optimization point of view there are a
number of obsolete codecs that are always worse compared
to other. These are G.726 (24 Kbps and 32Kbps), G.727,
G.729.D, G.729.A, G.723.1 (6.3 Kbps), G.722.1, G.729,
G.728, G.711 (without PLC). The only codecs that need to
be implemented to optimize the the abovementioned three pa-
rameters for any operational regime of a mobile are: G.729.E,
G.711.1 (PLC mode), G.723.1 (5.3Kbps). The ﬁrst codec,
G.723.E, provides best possible performance for conventional
regime of a wireless ensuring the best possible trade-off
between the rate requirements (12.5 Kbps), power consumption
(350mW LTE CLSM, UMTS), and the perceived quality (R
value 90). When the system is severely overloaded and/or
the power consumption is the most important metrics (i.e.,
a mobile is running out of power) G.723.1 operating at 5.3
Kbps provide the best possible capacity and energy savings
(just 300mW for LTE CLSM and UMTS) at the expense of
signiﬁcant quality degradation (R value 75, which is close to
the lowest possible quality level). This codec can only operate
under zero PLR as any non-zero value of PLR immediately
make the heard quality unacceptable. Finally, when the system
is underloaded while the amount of power spent for communi-
cation is not important G.711.1 with PLC capabilities provides
the best possible heard quality at exceptionally high power
consumption.
