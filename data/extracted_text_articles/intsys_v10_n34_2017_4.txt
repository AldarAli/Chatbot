Abstract—Numerous mammals possess in addition to normal
body hairs tactile hairs, also known as vibrissae or whiskers,
to explore their environment. Biological observations have shown
that rodents use their tactile hairs in the snout region (mystacial
vibrissae) to estimate obstacle contact and obstacle shape within
a few contacts of the tactile hair. Despite different morphology
of animal vibrissae (e.g., cylindrically or conically shaped, pre-
curved, multi-layer structure), these biological tactile hairs are
modeled in a mechanical way to develop and analyze models
concerning their bending behavior with a glance to get hints for
a technical implementation as a technical sensor. We focus on an
analytical description, numerical simulations and experimental
veriﬁcations of an object scanning process to to achieve a better
understanding of this sense. We investigate the bending behavior
of cylindrically shaped rods with an intrinsic curvature, which
are one-sided clamped and interact with a rigid obstacle in the
plane. Hence, the sensing element vibrissa is under the load of an
external contact force during object scanning and is frequently
modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli bending rod allowing for large
deﬂections. Most of the literature is limited to the research on
cylindrical & straight, or tapered & straight rods. The (natural)
intrinsic curved shape is rarely analyzed. Hence, the aim is to
determine the obstacles contour by one quasi-static sweep along
the obstacle and to ﬁgure out the dependence on the intrinsic
curvature of the rod. The consideration of an intrinsic curvature
makes the analytical treatment a bit harder and results in
numerical solutions of the process. Nevertheless, at ﬁrst, we focus
on a constant intrinsic curvature and, then, present simulations
and experiments using a variable one.

ning; contour reconstruction.
I.
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the design and development of vibrissae-
inspired tactile sensors gain center stage in the focus of
research. This paper contributes to these investigations of
intelligent tactile sensors and extends the results of [1]. There
is a great interest in tactile sensors, especially in the ﬁeld of
(autonomous) robotics, see e.g., [2]–[8], since these tactile
sensors complement to and/or replace senses like vision,
because they provide reliable information in a dark and noisy
environment (e.g., seals detect freshet and turbulence of ﬁsh
in muddy water [9]–[11]), and are cheaper in fabrication.
A. Motivation from Biology
In many technical developments, engineers often use bi-
ological systems as an inspiration. A tactile sensor system,
which attracted attention in recent years, is the so-called sinus
hair. This tactile sensory organ with incomparable abilities can
be found on the body of mammals. Despite existing differences
regarding musculature and localization, they are synonymously
also known as vibrissae or whiskers [12]. Depending on their
localization on the body they are used for several tasks like
•
object recognition [13],
•
object discrimination [10] [14], and
•
perception of ﬂow [10] [15], as well as
•
for social behavior [16].
Sinus hairs differ from typical body hairs:
•
they are thicker, longer and stiffer than body hairs
[17],
•
each sinus hair is supported/embedded in its own
follicle-sinus complex (FSC), that is characterized by
its exceptional arrangement of blood vessels, neural
connections and muscles [18],
•
they are made of dead material, i.e., the hair shaft itself
has no receptors along its length [19], hence they are
mainly used for the transmission for all tactile stimuli
arising along the shaft, and
•
they feature an intrinsic curvature, a conical shape,
cylindrical cross-section and are made of different
material with hollow parts (like a multi-layer system)
[17] [20] [21].
As mentioned, rodents use their sinus hairs to acquire
information about their surroundings. The movement and de-
formation of the vibrissa due to contacts to several objects can
only be detected by mechanoreceptors in the FSC [2] [22].
Hence, the animal draws its conclusions about the environment
only from these (measured) quantities at the base of the
hair – the support reactions. We do not want to explain the
transmission of mechanical stimuli during object contact to the
mechanoreceptors in the follicle, rather we want to analyze the
inﬂuence of the geometrical properties of a sinus hairs on these
support reactions, which are used for object recognition and
contour reconstruction.
B. Goal
In this paper, the investigations focus the inﬂuence of the
intrinsic curvature to the bending behavior of a vibrissa due
to an obstacle contact during object sensing. This intrinsic
curvature is due to a kind of protection role: purely axial forces

are prevented and, including the conical shape, the area of the
tip of the vibrissa is limp. This results in a tangential contact
to an object [20] [23]. We describe a quasi-static scanning
process of obstacles: 1. analytical/numerical generation the
observables in the support, which an animal solely relies on,
2. reconstruction of the scanned proﬁle contour using only
these observables, and 3. veriﬁcation of the working principle
by means of experiments. These steps were done in [8], [24]
and [25] for cylindrical vibrissae. In [1], the inﬂuence of a
constant intrinsic curvature was investigated, here, we extend
these results to rods with a variable intrinsic curvature in this
paper.
C. Arrangement
The paper is arranged as follows: We give a short overview
on the related literature in Section II, which is quite rare
and often starts up with some approximations of the problem.
Section III is devoted to the governing equations describing
an Euler-Bernoulli rod with intrinsic curvature under large
deﬂections – nonlinear theory. In Section IV, we present the
scanning process, which has to be divided into two phases:
tip contact of the rod with the object, or tangential contact
within the rod’s length. For this, we set up two mechanical
models to describe these scenarios – ordinary differential
equations with boundary- or initial- condition. These equations
are exemplarily solved in Section V – considering ﬁrstly a
constant intrinsic curvature radius of the bending rod, and
then a variable one. The results are performed to test the
reconstruction algorithm to detect the obstacle’s boundary. The
effectiveness of the algorithm is then veriﬁed by experiments
in Section VI using three different artiﬁcial vibrissae. Then, the
paper closes in Section VII with a conclusion and an outlook
on future work.
II.
SOME STATE OF ART OF MODELING VIBRISSAE WITH
INTRINSIC CURVATURE
From the biological point of view, there are a lot of works
focussing on the determination of vibrissae parameters. Towal
et al. [21] pointed out an important fact that the mostly
vibrissae are curved in a plane. The deviation of the vibrissa
from this plane (referred to the length) is less than 0.1%.
In [21], [23] and [26]–[30], a vibrissa is described using a
polynomial approximation of 2nd-, 3rd- and 5th-order, which is
rather low. In contrast to this references, we present numerical
results using one of order 10. In [23], it is stated that ap-
proximately 90% of rat vibrissae exhibit an intrinsic curvature
κ0 ∈ (0.0065/mm, 0.074/mm), and in [28] that extremely
curved vibrissa provide κ0 > 0.25/mm. The authors of [17],
[23], [28] publish the following dimensionless parameters
L
d ≈ 30 ,
r0
d ≈ 90 ,
whereas L is the length, d is the base diameter, and r0 is the
intrinsic curvature radius of the vibrissa.
From the technical point of view, pre-curved vibrissae are
rarely used in applications. In [23], [29], [30], experimental
and theoretical investigations concerning the distance detection
to a pole are presented, using a pre-curved artiﬁcial vibrissa,
also incorporating the conical shape. The pros and cons of
a positive (curvature forward, CF) and negative (CB) curved
vibrissae are stated in [23] whereas the vibrissa is used for
tactile sensing of a pole. The CF-scanning results in low
axial forces, but higher sheer ones; CB the inverse results.
Summarized, the pre-curvature inﬂuences mainly the support
forces instead of the support moment.
III.
MODELING
The deﬂection of a largely deformed rod with intrinsic
curvature is described in using the so-called Winkler-Bach-
Theory. A detailed derivation of the equations can be found in
[32].
At ﬁrst, we derive the equations of stress and deformation
of the rod – using an inﬁnitesimal small element of a rod
with intrinsic curvature, presented in Figures 1–3, whereas we
have the following relation between curvature κ and curvature
radius r:
κ0(s) =
1
r0(s)
(1)
κ(s) =
1
r(s)
(2)
whereas the index “0′′ means undeformed state.

The length of a ﬁber in distance η to the rod axis is

Considering the special case, that the radius of intrinsic
curvature is much greater than the dimensions of the cross-

SCANNING PROCEDURE
Here, we describe the scanning procedure of strictly convex
proﬁle contours using pre-curved technical vibrissae in a plane.
This is done in two steps:
1.
Because of analytical interest, we ﬁrstly generate the
observables (support reactions) during the scanning
process. Since our intension is from bionics, we sim-
ply model the support as a clamping (being aware that
this does not match the reality). Hence, the support

reactions are the clamping forces and moment ⃗MAz,
⃗FAx, ⃗FAy, which an animal solely relies on.
2.
Then, we use these observables in an algorithm to
reconstruct the proﬁle contour.
Figure 4 sketches the scanning process of a plane, strictly
proﬁle. For this scanning process, several assumptions are
made:
•
The technical vibrissa is moved from right to the left
(negative x-direction), i.e., the base point is moved.
•
The problem is handled quasi-statically, i.e., the vib-
rissa is moved incrementally (and presented in changes
of the boundary conditions). Then, the elastically
deformed vibrissa is determined.
•
Since we do not want to deal with friction at the
beginning, we assume an ideal contact, i.e., the contact
force is perpendicular to the contact point tangent of
the proﬁle.
The scanned proﬁle is given by a function g : x 7→ g(x),
where g ∈ C1(R; R). Since the graph of g is convex by
assumption, the graph can be parameterized by means of the
slope angle α in the xy-plane. Then we have, [8]:
dg(x)
dx
= g′(x) = tan(α)
−→ x
= ξ(α) := g′−1

Observing Figures 4 and 5 gives the hint to distinguish two
phases of contact between the vibrissa and the obstacle:
•
Phase A – tip contact: We have still ODE-system (24)
with the boundary conditions (BCs)
y(0) = 0 ,
ϕ(0) = π
2 ,
x(1) = ξ(α) ,
y(1) = η(α)
(25)
•
Phase B – tangential contact: Only the BCs change:
y(0) = 0 ,
ϕ(0) = π
2 ,
x(s1) = ξ(α) ,
y(s1) = η(α) ,
ϕ(s1) = α

A direct inspection of the occurring problems (24)&(25) and

the parameters f and s1, and ﬁnally with f the clamping
reactions ⃗MAz, ⃗FAx, ⃗FAy.
B. Initial-value Problem in Step 2
Here, we use only the generated observables (measured
in experiments)
⃗MAz, ⃗FAx, ⃗FAy and known base of the
vibrissa x0 to reconstruct the scanned proﬁle. Due to [31],
we determine the bending moment, see Figure 6, to formulate

11–13), than we can increase the scanned area of the proﬁle
whereas the clamping reactions still stay at their values. It is
not really desirable to diminish the values of the clamping
reaction because of possible measurement problems.
The numerical simulation of scanning object contours using
artiﬁcial sinus hair-like tactile sensors of both constant and
variable intrinsic curvature work very well. Therefore, we
go on to the next step: experimental veriﬁcation in the next
section.
VI.
EXPERIMENTS
To verify the algorithms, we present numerical investiga-
tions of scanning vibrissae with variable intrinsic curvature and
experimental results, using the parabola proﬁle
x 7→ g1(x) = 2x2 + 0.55 .
Three different technical vibrissae with different pre-curvature
are used in an experiment. Figure 21 shows that the ﬁrst
vibrissa is a straight one, the second and the third one have a
variable intrinsic curvature radius.
With the help of a computer-aided evaluation of the graphic
representation of the vibrissae in Figure 21, their intrinsic
curvature radius r0L(s) is determined in dependence on the
arc length s as polynomials of order 10. This is rather new in
literature, because a lot of works from literature restrict to a
representation of the pre-curvature only to s2-terms.
The simulated scanning processes are shown in Figures 23
and 24 for vibrissa 1 and 3.

Figures 25–27 show exemplarily the observables (simu-
lation vs. experiment) of the experiment using vibrissa 3.
An easy inspection conﬁrms prior results, that the maximal
values of MAz, FAx and FAy decrease the bigger the intrinsic
curvature and the smaller the intrinsic curvature radius are.
These ﬁgures show a good coincidence of the simulated and
measured curves of the observables.
Summarizing, the following Figures 28–30 present the
reconstruction of the proﬁle. Compared to further simulations,
we point out that the smaller the intrinsic curvature radius is the
smaller is the reconstruction error. Finally, we conclude that
it is promising to use pre-curved vibrissae for object contour
scanning and reconstruction. The simulated and measured
curves of the observables show up a good coincidence. The
presented algorithms work effectively.

CONCLUSION
Due to the functionality of animals vibrissae, the goal was
to set up a model for an object scanning and shape reconstruc-
tion algorithm. For this, the only available information are the
observables (support reaction, which an animal solely relies
on) governed by one single sweep along the proﬁle. Based on
these observables, the object boundary has to be reconstructed.
It was possible to illustrate the characteristics and inﬂu-
ences of pre-curved technical vibrissae in view of proﬁle
scanning. Based on the Winkler-Bach-Theory for pre-curved
beams we set up the equations for a deformed vibrissa during a
scanning process. We presented an algorithm to reconstruct the
scanned proﬁle in using the generated observables (which an

The reconstruction then was based on solving initial-value
problems on contrast to the generation procedure where we
solved boundary-value problems. The investigations respective
the scanning of a strictly convex proﬁle with a pre-curved
vibrissae showed noticeable differences to the proﬁle scanning
with a straight vibrissa. The extrema of the bending reactions
and the size of the scanned proﬁle area depends on the pre-
curvature radius of the vibrissa. Using a smaller radius, the
tangential contact phase B in the scanning process could be
enlarged. Experiments conﬁrmed the numerical results and
algorithms in this paper. Moreover, the investigation showed
that the proﬁle reconstruction works better with a pre-curved
vibrissa.
