Abstract—This article examines two business models for
multiplex
(MUX)
operators
in
the
process
of
digitization: Business model 1, where a MUX operator
rents the existing network infrastructure and Business
model 2, where a MUX operator owns the network
infrastructure. By examining these models, this article
aims to show which business model and which standard
are
most
cost
efficient
for
digital
television
implementation
in
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina.
This
analysis shows that a good MUX operator business
model
is
very
important
for
digital
television
implementation. Three different scenarios point to the
fact that the transmission system significantly affects the
cost of the MUX operator. Through this analysis, it will
be determined that Business model 2 is more economical
for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Keywords-broadcasters; business models; investment costs;
legal framework; MUX operator.

INTRODUCTION
Regional Radio-communication Conference RRC-06 was
held in Geneva, from 15 May to 16 June 2006 with a goal of
setting the plan of spectrum usage for the radio diffusion
needs in Europe, Africa and parts of Asia. According to GE-
06
agreement,
the
process
of
transition
to
digital
broadcasting is to be done in Very High Frequency (VHF)
III (174-230 MHz) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) IV/V
(470-862 MHz) bands. This agreement states June 17, 2015
as the date of completion of the transition process [1].
Digital television allows broadcasters to offer new and
different
services
to
its
customers,
which
include
significantly improved reception, with fewer interruptions
and errors in transmission, wide screen format, Standard
Definition Television (SDTV), High Definition Television
(HDTV), high quality sound, Electronic Program Guide
(EPG), radio programs, multicasting and data casting [2].
The
provision
of
digital
television
requires
MUX
operator that provides television and radio programs, digital
content added services, electronic communication services
and other associated identification signals and data.
Since digital broadcasting has still not begun in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, this paper provides a brief overview of the
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. After that, potential
business models will be proposed for MUX operators. In
accordance with the analysis of the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, economic analysis will be carried out in order
to determine which digital television standard is best for
implementation, and thus determine which business model is
the optimal one.

DIGITAL TELEVISION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
A.
Regulatory and Legal Aspects od Digital Terrestrial
Television Introduction
Bosnia and Herzegovina initiated the process of transition
to digital broadcasting in time. By establishing the Digital
Terrestrial
Television
(DTT)
forum
of
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina (in 2006), with operational work of the
secretariat and working groups (in 2007), and based on a
debate in the communications sector and successful regional
cooperation in this field, the Council of Ministers has
adopted the strategy document for the transition to digital
broadcasting in 2009. This strategy document provides
guidance to the relevant institutions in this area, informs
interested
parties
in
the
communications
sector
and
approaches this subject to citizens. As the development and
adoption of the action plan, proposed
in a strategy
document, are in a serious delay, the steps required for
analogue broadcasting turn
off could
not
have been
implemented until December 1st, 2011, as was scheduled by
the strategy [3].
B.
Technological Aspects of DTT Introduction
The key players for DTT introduction are shown in
Figure 1, adapted from [4]. This figure shows that there are
three key players in the process of delivering digital services:
1.
Content and Application Service Providers (CASP)
provide content and applications and after that this
content is distributed towards interconnection points
with Network Service Providers (NSP), where such
content is concentrated and packed with contents
from other CASPs.
2.
NSP provides program transmission to DTT MUX
operator where the content is selected from the
transmission network, and via DTT multiplexes
forwarded to the transmitting site. One NSP is able

to transmit a greater variety of TV programs in its
own network, while DTT MUX operator selects only
those TV programs that have a license to broadcast
in the network of that DTT MUX operator.
3.
DTT MUX operator collects and marks the content
and sends it as a digital multiplex, and then decides
which
Conditional
Access
(CA)
and
which
Subscriber Management System (SMS) will be used.
Using the three key players has the following benefits
[5]:

Fast network disconnection, which is achieved by
the NSP setting the transmitter, while the MUX
operator is oriented to the SMS system, multiplexing
and distribution;

Increasing expansion of services;

Smaller investments, because they are distributed to
all three key players.
Disadvantages of having three key players are [5]:

Higher complexity of the process of delivering
content to users;

As all three sides are mutually dependent on each
other in the process of delivering the content to users
in a case that one party violates the regulatory
requirements,
it
causes
inconvenience
to
other
parties, as well as the disruption of service provision.
In order to avoid these shortcomings, there could be only
two key players, CASP and MUX operator [5]. This way,
complexity of the process of digital services delivery to end
users is reduced and the management of the entire process is
much easier. In this approach, MUX operator assumes the
role of providing the infrastructure and management of the
entire transmission process.
III.
BUSINESS MODELS FOR MUX OPERATORS
Business
modeling, and
analysis of technical and
economic aspects of business strategies and opportunities,
has an increasingly important role in scientific research.
Various researchers, in different contexts, presented several
different definitions of business models. Teece [7] talk
about importance of business models:
"Whenever a business is established, it either explicitly
or implicitly employs a particular business model that
describes the architecture of the value creation, delivery,
and
capture
mechanisms
employed
by
the
business
enterprise. The essence of a business model is that it defines
the manner by which the business enterprise delivers value
to customers, entices customers to pay for value, and
converts
those
payments
to
profit:
it
thus
reflects
management’s hypothesis about what customers want, how
they want it, and how an enterprise can organize to best
meet those needs, get paid for doing so, and make a profit."
Each MUX operator should be supported by a successful
business model. A MUX operator is essentially a service
provider
as
a
standardized
signal
flow
for
digital
broadcasting systems. That flow, in addition to television
and radio programs, includes additional digital services,
electronic communications services and other associated
identification signals and data.
The main MUX operator functions can be summarized
as follows:

Establishing, operating and developing multiplexes;

Providing
and
managing
connections
with
the
CASPs;

Providing and managing the delivery of multimedia
services to end users;

Compliance with the requirements of regulators, in
accordance with the permit.
The number of MUX operators in one country depends
on how much coverage should be achieved or for which
broadcasters MUX operator is intended.
Regarding the coverage, we have the following MUX
operators [5]:

MUX operators for national coverage;

MUX operators for regional coverage;

MUX operators for local coverage.
Regarding their purpose, we have following MUX
operators [5]:

MUX operators for public broadcasters;

MUX operators for commercial broadcasters;

MUX operators for value added services.
For the digital television broadcasting, in the beginning,
it is recommended to use two MUX operators, one MUX for
public
broadcasters
(MUX
A)
and
one
MUX
for
commercial broadcasters (MUX B, by allotments), where a
public MUX can also broadcast commercial CASP services
in order to encourage the competition [5]. The existence of
one MUX operator for value added services in the begginig
of this process would be counter productive and would not
make any sense from a business aspect.
Two potential business MUX operator models will be
described
in
the
next
section.
Participants,
their
relationships, streams of revenue and cost generators are
presented for each model.
The black arrows in each of the business models
represent the direction of the flow of services, while revenue
streams are represented by red arrows. The ellipse on each
scheme represents a participant, while a rectangle inside the
ellipse represents the role of the participant. One participant
may have one or more roles.

A.
Business Model 1 – Digital Broadcasting in which
MUX Operator Takes a Lease of the Existing Network
Infrastructure
The business model that is shown in Figure 2 describes
the scenario of providing broadcasting services to the end
user. MUX operators obtain the content in the wholesale
from various participants and also have a role of content
collectors,
by
collecting
more
TV
programs
or
data
sequences on the broadcast channel. On the other side, NSP
manages the broadcasting network and sells the capacity to
MUX operator. In other words, MUX operator does not own
the network infrastructure, so it rents it from NSP. It is
important to mention that, in case of commercial content
providers, their income does not come from subscriptions for

but from the companies that advertise through them. The key
participants in this model are MUX operator, NSP operator,
content provider, content producer, the owner of content, and
value added services provider.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF INTRODUCING MUX
OPERATORS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
This
section
provides
a
cost
estimation
for
the
construction of MUX network for commercial broadcasters,
MUX B. This study is based on the fact that the coverage of
population with digital signal is proportional to the current
coverage with analog signal. UHF channels are assigned to
MUX B and it can transmit up to 8 programs on one
channel. This means that the MUX operator revenues will
be by 8 emitters. During the construction of this network,
there is one MUX operator with national coverage. In the
business world, the optimum time for paying back the
invested resources is 8 years, so this analysis will also take 8
years as the time for paying back investments for MUX
operators. In addition to that, this analysis has predicted the
period of nine months as the optimal time to install the
necessary equipment.
Initial costs are all those costs that MUX operator will
have prior to equipment installation and start-up. These
costs
include purchase of head-end system equipment,
transmission system and transmitter system. Also, these
costs may include the cost of paying for permits and
purchase of frequencies [6].
Both initial and total costs of MUX operators depend on
which transmission system will be used, as well as the price
that CASPs will pay to MUX operators. All initial costs are
shown in Table III.
In order to determine which transmission system is the
most economical, three scenarios will be considered to
estimate the total cost of MUX operator.

A.
Scenario 1 – Total Costs of MUX Operator in a Case
When a Transmission is Done via Satelitte
As the transmission is done by using a satellite, it is
necessary to rent a satellite segment. According to Table III,
we have following investment costs:

Head-end system – 250,000.00 EUR;

Work permit – 15,000.00 EUR;

Satellite segment renting – 2,000,000.00 EUR;

Satellite
transmission
system
equipment
–
383,000.00 EUR;

Transmitter system equipment – 8,000,000.00 EUR.
The total initial costs amount to 10,648,000.000 EUR.
After these costs, it is necessary to install the purchased
equipment. In addition, payment of work licenses, frequency
renting and satellite segment renting contribute to the amount
of total costs. Also, a significant part of the costs come from
the electronic equipment amortization, where the rate of
amortization is 20%. All of the costs mentioned above are
shown in Table IV.
The total costs for this scenario are approximately
34,230,000.00 EUR. At the annual level, these costs amount
to 4,300,000.00 EUR. If we take into consideration that

MUX operator serves 8 emitters, the annual fee for one
emitter in this scenario is approximately 540,000.00 EUR.
B.
Scenario 2 – Total Costs of MUX Operator in a Case
When a Transmission is Done via Rented Terrestrial
Links
In this case, a MUX operator rents links for transmitting
content towards transmission sites. Initial costs are now:

Head-end system – 250,000.00 EUR;

Work permit – 15,000.00 EUR;

Transmission link renting – 1,000,000.00 EUR;

Transmitter system equipment – 8,000,000.00 EUR.
All costs that the MUX operator has in this scenario are
shown in Table V.
The total costs for this scenario are approximately
25,500,000.00 EUR. At the annual level, these costs amount
to 3,187,500.00 EUR. The annual fee for one emitter in this
scenario is approximately 400,000.00 EUR.
C. Scenario 3 – Total Costs of MUX Operator in a Case
When the Operator Owns the Transmission Network
In this scenario, a MUX operator owns a transmission
network. This means that it needs to buy transmission system
equipment and install it. Therefore, the initial costs will
change. According to this, we have the following investment
costs:

Head-end system – 250,000.00 EUR;

Work permit – 15,000.00 EUR;

Transmission system equipment – 2,000,000.00
EUR.

Transmitter system equipment – 8,000,000.00 EUR.
All costs for MUX operator, for this scenario, are shown
in Table VI.
The total costs for this scenario are approximately
21,300,000.00 EUR. At the annual level, these costs amount
to 2,660,000.00 EUR, which means that annual fee for one
emitter in this scenario is approximately 350,000.00 EUR.

Result Analyzis
The cost recovery Curves of the MUX operator for the
three analyzed scenarios is shown in Figure 4.
Initial investment costs are highest for Scenario 1, which
is primarily due to the payment of satellite segment rent at
the beginning of the year. The minimum initial investment
costs are for Scenario 2, because the costs of renting
transmission links at the beginning of the year are less than
half in comparison with renting a satellite segment.
The costs increase significantly in an eight year working
period. A large contribution to those costs is renting a
satellite band for Scenario 1, or renting transmission links
for Scenario 2. These costs do not exist in the third scenario
because the MUX operator has its own network.
The graph shows that the fastest payment refund is in the
third scenario, where the curve has the highest slope. In one
moment costs for the third scenario become lower than the
costs in the second scenario. The reason for this is that in
Scenario 3 MUX operator has its own network, so there is
no need to pay for equipment renting.
Concerning the MUX operator, we can conclude that for
digital television transmission in Bosnia it is best to use
terrestrial transmission with its own transmission network,
because the total cost is smaller, as well as the price that
broadcasters would have to pay. It means that for MUX
operator is better to use Business model 2. Because of the
lower costs, broadcasters would be more inclined to agree to
digitize their signals and transfer the same.

The advantage broadcasters get in this case is the
availability of their programs throughout the country.
By entering into this business, one can accurately
calculate the costs that are expected for MUX operators and
the price broadcasters will have to pay. Based on that price,
it is possible to win over broadcasters before starting the
operations, so the risk of investing in this business is low.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Transition to digital broadcasting frees the RF spectrum
of
the
digital
dividend,
which
has
very
favorable
characteristics and provides an optimal balance between
transmission capacity and coverage range.
The use of MPEG-4 standard for video compression and
the use of DVB-T2 transmission technology, with a goal of
more efficient use of the frequency spectrum, by facilitating
the transmission of a higher number of channels per
frequency, is an interesting option, especially for countries
that have not yet completed the process of transition to
digital broadcasting.
Two previously mentioned business models can be used
as a startup framework for the implementation of MUX
operator. The cost of introducing a MUX operator depends
on the transmission system as could be seen from the
economic analysis. The lowest costs that are expected for
MUX operators are in the case of terrestrial transmission
where MUX operator owns the network. In this case, the
price paid by broadcasters is much lower and it is a great
advantage, because that way the broadcasters will be more
inclined to enter the process of digitization.
If there was a jump-start with a DVB-T2 standard in
Bosnia,
it
would
mean
higher
investment
costs,
approximately 100,000.00 EUR. In this case, the number of
programs on one channel would increase to 16. This further
leads to a much larger contributions. In that case, the MUX
operator can reduce the cost of transmitting content to
broadcasters
and
thus
attract
more
broadcasters
and
increase the competition and interest in the market.
MUX operator would also transmit value added services
such as interactive services, internet, etc. So their revenues
would probably increase.
