Abstract— Recently, existing technologies such as Wi-Fi socket 
communication, Bluetooth communication, Wi-Fi direct, etc., 
are used to control smart devices which are in close vicinity. 
However, those technologies have some problems. One 
problem is that the Wi-Fi socket communication cannot work 
when the socket server is not working. Another problem is that 
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi direct cannot work, if the Operating 
System (OS) of each smart device is different. Therefore, to 
address these problems, we propose a new control method for 
smart devices in close vicinity using high frequencies. High 
frequencies are mixed control signals, which are using 18 kHz 
~ 22 kHz frequencies of audible range; most people cannot 
hear these high frequencies. Indeed, because the proposed 
method only uses the microphone and the speaker of smart 
device, there is no need for extra communication modules or 
communication server. In addition, it can be applied to most 
smart devices without reference to any OS. To evaluate the 
efficacy of the proposed method, we developed a music control 
application and a music player, to which we applied the 
proposed method. Then, we experimented with the developed 
applications at various distances and the control success rate 
was 97%. Moreover, when we use the high frequencies 
proposed method, the signal recognition rates of people close 
by was 5%. Therefore, the proposed method could be a useful 
method for control between smart devices in near.

 INTRODUCTION 
The recent addition of modules to smart device has 
improved their performance and allowed users to perform 
activities such as playing games, listening to music, and 
watching movies. Individuals have begun to use more than a 
single smart device and to share data among smart devices. 
For example, an iPhone 5s user might also buy an iPad Air 
for its wide screen and fast data processing. The iPad Air 
user might also use a Galaxy S4 based on the Android OS. 
At first, socket communication involving Wi-Fi and servers 
was used to share data among smart devices [1][2]. Near 
communication methods using the Bluetooth module and 
Wi-Fi direct function have also been developed [3][5]. In 
addition, various communication methods use control 
technology between smart devices [6][10]. However, Wi-Fi-
based socket communication technology requires a socket 
server, and if the socket server does not work, smart devices 
cannot share data or be controlled. Although Bluetooth 
technology does not need a server, pairing is needed to share 
data. In addition, Bluetooth technology has another weakness: 
It can be used only with devices with the same OS. Wi-Fi 
direct and Airdrop technology also have this weakness. 
Therefore, we need a new near control communication 
technology which enables sharing data between or 
controlling smart devices without pairing and regardless of 
OS. 
Therefore, we propose a near control technology using 
high frequencies and the internal microphones and speakers 
of smart devices. High frequencies are sound signals which 
most people cannot hear and are between 18 kHz and 22 kHz 
of the audible frequency range (20 Hz–22 kHz). We use 
these high frequencies as control signals. Earlier research 
using high frequencies applied ultrasonic waves used by bats 
for measuring the distance to objects or finding obstacles, 
and most researchers studied tracing the position of people in 
indoor environments using high frequencies [11][12]. Bihler 
named high frequencies ultrasound waves and used them to 
trigger signals for data transmission to smart devices [13]. In 
this paper, we seek to improve the high frequencies of Bihler 
and to apply them as control signals between smart devices 
at a near distance. The high frequencies used by Bihler could 
introduce errors from sounds in the environment, so we 
protected against error generation by using two high 
frequencies: the first to send and the second to end it control 
signal. The first uses frequencies in the 18–22 kHz range, 
while the second uses only a fixed frequency. 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we 
developed a music remote control (control sender) and music 
player (control reception) applications to which we applied 
the proposed high-frequency method. We conducted a 
control experiment of the proposed high-frequency method 
using the two developed applications at various distances. 
The results showed a control accuracy of 97% within 5 m. 
When using the proposed high-frequency method, we tested 
how many people recognized the signal, resulting a 
recognition rate of less than 5%. Therefore, the proposed 
high-frequency method is useful in near wireless control 
between smart devices. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the 
high frequencies used in the proposed method and the 
algorithm for the processing of the high frequencies in the 
smart device. In Section 3, we describe the music remote 
control and player applications. Finally, in Section 4, we

discuss the results of the control experiment regarding the 
performance of the proposed method, and we present the 
conclusions. 
 
II. 
INAUDIBLE FREQUENCIES FOR CONTROL AND 
CONTROL METHOD BETWEEN SMART DEVICES 
This section explains the high frequencies used in the 
proposed control method between smart devices. The 
proposed high frequencies are between 18 kHz and 22 kHz. 
Two high frequencies are used in the proposed method. The 
first high frequency carries control information, so it uses 
one changeable frequency from 18 kHz to 22 kHz. The 
second high frequency sends only control end information, 
so it uses one fixed frequency. Thus, the proposed high 
frequencies consist of, first, a changeable high frequency and, 
second, a fixed high frequency as a control signal. The 
generating time of the first high frequency is m seconds and 
of the second high frequency n seconds. The reason for using 
two high frequencies in order is to prevent errors caused by 
unexpected noises in the environment. Fig. 1 presents an 
example of the proposed high frequencies. In Fig.1, the first 
high frequency uses 19 kHz and 20 kHz for the control 
signal, and the second high frequency 18 kHz. 
As shown in Fig. 1, when the control device sends 19 
kHz for the first high frequency over 0.2 s and 18 kHz as the 
second high frequency over 0.2 s, the smart device which 
receives the control signals completes analysis of the high 
frequencies at 0.5 s and executes a specific operation using 
the control signal (①). When the control signal sends 20 kHz 
over 0.2 s and 18 kHz over 0.2 s in order, the smart device 
completes analysis of the high frequencies at 1 s and 
executes another specific operation (②). In the example 
presented in Fig. 1, m and n seconds are both 0.2 s. We can 
see that, although noise occurs from 0.4 s to 0.5 s of the ① 
control signal and another noise occurs from 0.8 s to 0.9 s of 
the ② control signal, the proposed high frequencies work 
well. Figure 2 shows the work flow of the control method 
between smart devices using the proposed high frequencies. 
 
 
Figure 2. Work flow of proposed method using high frequencies 
 
As shown in Fig. 2, when the control device sends the 
first high frequency (①), the receiving device uses a fast 
Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to decide whether high 
frequencies are from the surrounding environment (②). If a 
high frequency is detected, the receiving device repeatedly 
checks if that same high frequency is sent consistently. If the 
high frequency continues for m seconds (③), the receiving 
device stops checking the first high frequency and waits for 
the second high frequency as the control end signal (④).

Then, if the control device sends the second high frequency 
(⑤), the receiving device recognizes the second high 
frequency over n seconds (⑥) and executes a specific 
operation (⑦).

EXPERIMENT WITH AND ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED 
CONTROL METHOD USING HIGH FREQUENCIES 
This section describes the music remote control and 
player applications developed and the results for the 
performance of the proposed method’s performance in the 
control experiment. The music remote control application 
sends the control signal from the control device, as described 
in Section 3, and has a toggle button, which can play and 
stop songs on the receiving device, and a next button, which 
enables moving to the next song (see Fig. 3(a)). The toggle 
button (①), which starts and stops songs (Fig. 3(a)), uses 19 
kHz as the first high frequency and 18 kHz as the second 
high frequency. The next button (②) (Fig. 3(a)) uses 20 kHz 
as the first high frequency and 18 kHz as the second high 
frequency. We use 0.2 s as m seconds of the first high 
frequency and 0.2 s as n seconds of second high frequency. 
The music player application receives the proposed high 
frequencies and plays a song (Fig. 4(b) and (c)). The music 
player application starts with the “Music Stop” screen (Fig. 
4(b)). When it receives the high frequencies for playing 
songs from the music remote control, the music player 
application displays song information and plays the song 
 
 
 
 
 (Fig. 4(c)). The image (①) in Fig. 4(c) shows information 
about the song being played and a progress bar (②), 
indicating the duration of the song. 
We tested the accuracy of the proposed high-frequency 
method when varying the distance between the music remote 
control and player applications. The tested distance between 
the smart devices was 1 m and 5 m, with 100 tests performed 
at each distance using the play, stop, and next buttons. The 
test environment was a laboratory with a quiet indoor 
environment with a noise level of approximately 40 dB, the 
average noise level in homes. Figure 5 shows the results for 
distance from the control experiment. The accuracy of all 
control operations within 3 m was more than 95% and within 
5m, more than 95%. While the music player application was 
playing, the accuracy of the stop and next control operations 
was 96.8% within 5 m. Thus, the proposed high frequencies 
are robust amidst interference from other unexpected sound 
signals. 
Next, we tested the recognition rates among surrounding 
people when using the proposed high frequencies. The 
experiment environment was the same as in the previous 
experiment, and the distance between smart devices was 3 m. 
Each control operation was performed 10 times, and the 10 
participants were students in their 20s who were in the same 
place for each operation. The signal recognition experiment 
noted the number of count cognitions among participants 
when using high frequencies, Table 1 shows the results for 
signal recognition using the proposed high frequencies.

As shown in Table 1, participants’ average recognition 
value was less than 5%. When it was silent, 1 of the 10 
participants recognized the high frequencies 6 times, while 
another recognized the high frequencies twice. Eight 
participants did not recognize the proposed high frequencies. 
When a song was playing, 2 participants recognized the 
control signal. One participant recognized twice and another 
once. Participants recognized high frequencies in the stop 
operation less frequently than in the play operation, even 
though the 2 control signals used the same high frequency.  
This difference likely is explained by the playing music 
which covered the sound of the high frequencies. Two 
participants recognized the high frequencies for the next 
operation, which were different than the play and stop 
operation frequencies. The next high frequencies were 
generated while a song was playing; 1 participant recognized 
the signals once and 1 participant twice. After the experiment, 
we conducted a hearing test for the 2 participants who 
recognized the proposed high frequencies and found that 
they could hear the 18 kHz high frequency. However, the 
average recognition value of the 3 operations using proposed 
method was less than 5%, so we confirmed that the proposed 
high frequencies did not affect people in the area of the smart 
device. 
 
 
 
 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have shown that the proposed method 
using high frequencies can effectively control smart devices 
at a close range without a socket server or pairing. This 
method can easily use any OS on smart devices, even if the 
smart devices have different OS. Therefore, the proposed 
high-frequency method can be a useful technology in 
networking fields, such as near wireless communications and 
near control between smart devices.  
In future research, we will study the effectiveness of 
advertisement technology in smart televisions using the 
proposed high frequencies with smart devices. Additionally, 
we will research new signal processing technology for data 
and information transmission using only high frequencies.
