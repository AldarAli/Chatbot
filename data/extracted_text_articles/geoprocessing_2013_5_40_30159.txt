Abstract—State-of-the-art network simulation and optimiza-
tion techniques rank among the most studied problems in the
ﬁeld of operations research. While the mathematical models
are studied in detail and nearly each network optimization
problem has its already known solution in form of an optimal
or heuristic algorithm, the underlying spatial data are the one
key factor with respect to the optimization results. This paper
examines the generation of weighted network graphs based on
heterogeneous spatial data. Based on a general format, the
normalized geobasisdata, an initial graph, is constructed. This
graph is then used as input into our rule-based system to select
and weight the edges to be in the ﬁnal graph. The successful
reduction of the complexity of the generated graph is shown in
the experiments.
Keywords—geographic information; spatial data; mathematical
optimization; simulation; network construction; graph theory.
I. INTRODUCTION
Mathematical models of state-of-the-art network optimiza-
tion and simulation techniques are based on network graphs
consisting of vertices (i.e., points-of-interest) and pair wise
joining edges between them. This work focuses on the missing
link between the real world and the mathematical modeling
- the weighted network graph based on spatial data. The
graph is generated using spatial polygon data describing the
land use of an area on the one hand, and spatial line- and
point-objects, describing existing infrastructure on the other
hand. Based on this spatial data originating from a number of
hybrid sources, a rule-based expert system is used to construct
a network graph as vital input in subsequent mathematical
models. We focus on optimization models within the scope
of telecommunication network construction. The models are
intended to minimize network construction costs (including
underground work and cable laying costs) as well as to
maximize the number of customers that can be connected
to the communication network infrastructure. An instance of
such a model using weighted graphs is the simulation and
optimization engine of ﬁber optic communication networks
described in [1]. Here, the land use polygons are used to
generate a graph originating from a cost raster, which describes
the underground construction costs. While using a cost raster
is a feasible way to generate a network graph representing
network construction costs, a more sophisticated approach is
needed to generate graphs by taking into consideration all
kinds of real world information and being able to be computed
in a reasonable time.
The present paper is divided into a preliminaries section, the
section dedicated to the deﬁnition of normalized geobasisdata,
details of our approach and experimental results followed by
the conclusion.
II. PRELIMINARIES
The subsequent simulation and optimization algorithms re-
quire undirected graphs as the fundamental data structure. The
graph G = (V, E, d) consists of n = |V | vertices and m = |E|
edges. The distance of an edge eij ∈ E connecting the two ver-
tices i ∈ V and j ∈ V is given as a cost function dij : E → R.
When calculating the shortest path or the minimum Steiner
Tree [2], [3] as typical routing problems, the distance d can
be the Euclidean distance. The more sophisticated algorithms
use travel time as the distance between two vertices. In case
of scenarios considering the build-up of wired networks, the
distances have to be construction costs, such as underground
work or the costs for building cable poles.
The two-dimensional geographic data originate from hybrid
sources, thus these data need to be prepared to serve as the
basis for the construction of network graphs. There are three
main sources for the geographical data:
(a)
The geographic information system (GIS).
(b)
The network information system (NIS).
(c)
The Austrian digital cadastral map (DKM).
Each of the above listed items is needed for the construction
of a consistent data source.
A. GIS
In our case, the geographic information system includes
typical information used in marketing scenarios and strategic
decisions. It is important to know where the potential cus-
tomers are located. The data showing the population density or
the number of households collected in a population census are
incorporated in the GIS as well. The GIS contains statistical
data aggregated from public sources together with informa-
tion gathered by the prosecuting company itself. The most
important information for a network construction company is
the information about the location of potential customers, the
expected beneﬁt, and the classiﬁcation as private or public.

The network operator knows the exact location and the
return on investment of the current customers, but not for po-
tential customers. The marketing division uses market surveys
and other statistical data to predict the location of potential
customers and the likely yearly sales.
B. NIS
The network information system contains the information
regarding all hardware components of the communication
network as well as all logical links between these components.
Typically, the NIS contains the most important business secrets
of a network operating company. The following gives a list of
the typical content of a NIS:
• Current and former customers.
• Network components.
• Physical cabling plan.
• Logical cabling plan.
C. DKM
The Austrian Digital Cadastral Map is part of the ofﬁcial
boundaries cadastre, which is the binding evidence of all
parcel’s boundaries. The DKM contains all public and private
property and is available nationwide. Furthermore, it docu-
ments the type of land use of each parcel as well as buildings.
Similar information is held in layers and together they form
the DKM (a comprehensive interface description can be found
in [4]):
• Boundaries.
• Parcel numbers.
• Types of land use (building land, forest, running water,
standing water, etc.).
• Buildings.
• Control and Boundary points.
Formerly available only as an analog hard copy, the DKM
was not only digitized but also enhanced using other ofﬁcial
sources like Orthophotos and partition plans. Due to this
reason, the quality of the digital map exceeds the quality of the
analog version but it may include historical failures as well.
There is a list of papers describing the aspects of spatial data
quality [5], [6], [7], [8] as well as an ISO Standard regarding
the quality of spatial data [9].
While the spatial accuracy is acceptable in most of mathe-
matical simulation and optimization scenarios, the topological
quality of the input data has to be ensured. There is some
work proposed to identify spatial inconsistencies and incorrect
object classiﬁcations using either manually deﬁned spatial
integrity constraints [10], [11], [12] or an automatic and
incremental approach using decision trees proposed in [13]
and improved in [14].
The Austrian DKM is used as one of the basic input into
our approach and has to be normalized together with the other
spatial input data.
III. NORMALIZED GEOBASISDATA
The subsequent graph generation is designed as a com-
pletely automated process without the need of any user interac-
tion. Due to this fact, the input data are stored in a predeﬁned
digital map format and the spatial objects must meet a set of
conditions. In our approach, we have decided to use the ESRI
Shapeﬁle [15] as the digital map format. This open format
is widely used and supported and stores spatial geometry and
attributes as elements representing points, lines, and polygons.
The Normalized Geobasisdata (NGB) format [16] is an add-
on to the ESRI Shapeﬁle specifying the minimum qualitative
and logical requirements of the spatial objects. It was devel-
oped in order to allow the automated generation of weighted
network graphs based on any two-dimensional spatial data that
represent surface data (i.e., land uses) in form of polygons at
least. If the hybrid spatial data fulﬁll the speciﬁed NGB format,
they qualify as input into the graph generation process.
The NGB format was originally developed for a simulation
model dealing with the layout planning of a ﬁber-optics
communication network in the year 2009. Since then it has
been continuously adapted to the speciﬁc requirements of
individual projects.
The majority of mathematical simulation and optimization
models dealing with cable infrastructure planning or routing
in general rely on spatial data as the main input source to stay
real world compatible. We have deﬁned the following list of
objects as the required spatial information to be covered in the
NGB format:
TABLE I
NGB OBJECT TYPES AND THEIR SPATIAL REPRESENTATION.

Spatial representation
a
Project area
Polygon
b
Land use
Polygon
c
Usable (own or third-party) infrastructure
Polyline
d
Infrastructure points
Point
e
Access points
Point
The polygon describing the project area (a) as well as each
polygon describing the land use (b) must show the follow-
ing characteristics (in addition to some mandatory attributes
described below):
• Valid and closed polygon.
• No crossing edges.
• Degree-two vertices only.
• No overlapping or equality with other polygons (see
Figure 1).
A polyline referred to as usable infrastructure (c) can be
associated with own infrastructure (e.g., the copper cabling in
the access domain) or third-party infrastructure (e.g., leased
lines). The spatial object must be a valid polyline. In case
of any attributive restriction in the accessibility, there must
be at least two infrastructure points assigned; hence the
infrastructure can only be accessed via one of the two points
(an open line infrastructure can be accessed at the masts only).
The infrastructure points (d) are attributive assigned to
exactly one polyline of the usable infrastructure and represent
any type of infrastructure objects that can be localized on
exactly one position (e.g., shafts to access pipes, masts,
hardware like splitters or routers, etc.).

All existing relations between pairwise polygons. EQ (equal) and
PO (partly overlapping) relations are not allowed in NGB; Based on Region
Connection Calculus (RCC-8) [17].
The last object class is the class of access points (e).
These are points representing the terminals in a following
optimization. We distinguish between existing access points
that are currently supplied by one or a group of connected
usable infrastructure polylines, and potential access points that
are not yet connected.
The presented approach of the graph generation makes
use of geometric algorithms and algorithms from operations
research. Thus, ambiguous relations or even holes between
spatial objects cannot be allowed. This distinguishes between
common geodatabase systems and spatial data in the NGB
format, because there are no tolerances allowed.
Two points meant to be on the same position have to
share the same coordinates. Furthermore, there are general
speciﬁcations which cover the notation, the coordinate system,
the locale, default attribute values, and a list of common
abbreviations.
The next section describes our graph generation approach,
that is based on spatial input data in NGB format.
IV. GRAPH GENERATION
The process that we follow to generate a weighted network
graph consists of three consecutive stages (see Figure 2 for
the individual results):
• NGB preprocessing and enhancement.
• Generation of the candidate graph.
• Running the rule-based system.
In the following section, further details to the stages will be
given.
A. NGB preprocessing and enhancement
The preprocessing and enhancement of the input data are
fully automated processes. As long as the input data fulﬁll the
requirements in the NGB format, the generation of a weighted

points are shown as squares.
network graph will succeed. Moreover, the quality and usabil-
ity of the generated graph are crucial in terms of topological
errors within the spatial data. Furthermore, the succeeding
process of assigning the correct weights to all edges in the
graph is sensitive to the correct spatial classiﬁcation.
To ensure high quality in the resulting graph, the input data
are validated running the decision tree approaches described
in [13] and [14]. Based on error free spatial data covering
provincial, rural, suburban, and urban areas, a representative
decision tree was constructed. Both approaches use this deci-
sion tree to validate the input data. The process will output
warnings in case of topological errors and reclassify spatial
objects according to the decision tree.
The validation is followed by the enhancement of the input
data. Since underground work in crossroads areas and the sub-
sequent obstruction in trafﬁc should be avoided, the roadways
are supplemented by polygons representing crossroads areas.
Each crossing of at least two center lines of street polygons
is identiﬁed and replaced by a polygon classiﬁed as crossroad
area. The process runs automatically and produces suitable
results (see Figure 3).
B. Generation of the candidate graph
The goal of any graph-based mathematical optimization is
to connect the access points to a given or new access network.
As a result of the graph generation, each spatial object will be
connected with other objects in the candidate graph. Algorithm
1 describes the construction of the initial candidate graph that
is used as an input into the rule-based system.

C. Running the rule-based system
The rule-based system is based on the expert knowledge of
network constructors. It is applied to the generated candidate
graph to test for qualiﬁed edges. Each of the following
questions will be answered with yes or no and determine the
appearance of the edge in the ﬁnal graph (edge is rejected, if
all answered with no):
1) The edge is needed to ensure a connected graph.
2) The edge is part of the existing infrastructure.
3) The edge is not part of any land use to be ﬁltered
(compare Figure 4).
4) The edge is part of the best (least costly) possibility to
connect spatial objects.
(a) Unﬁltered graph
(b) Filtered graph

(a) Unﬁltered graph and (b) ﬁltered by agricultural land uses.
While for the ﬁrst three questions the answer is quite easy to
ﬁnd, the last question requires a combination of a list of rules
with an algorithm from the area of combinatorial optimization
to generate a valid answer.
After identifying all edges that are members in the ﬁnal
graph, the rule-based system is used to weight the edges. De-
pending on the originating land use or infrastructure, weights
representing the network construction costs (or network usage
costs in case of infrastructure) are assigned.
In the next section, we will describe the outcome of experi-
ments we ran using input data from four different classiﬁcation
areas.
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
After running a series of experiments, the results are not
only promising, but are proven to be valid in case of simulation
and optimization scenarios in the ﬁeld of the construction of
hybrid communication networks.
The three main factors determining the quality of the
generated graphs are:
(a)
The real-world correlation.
(b)
The correct cost assignment.
(c)
The usability.
The (a) correlation and (b) weighting can only be tested by
a comparison of a manually planned scenario with the result
of an optimization using the graph.
The (c) usability is primarily deﬁned by the focused opti-
mization algorithm. The number of vertices and edges in the
weighted graph must be small enough to allow the application
of heuristics or optimal algorithms but at the same time it also
must be large enough to be non-restrictive.

In our experiments, we selected input data from four differ-
ent classiﬁcation areas:
• Urban;
• Suburban;
• Rural, and
• Provincial.
Table II provides the classiﬁcation of the exemplary selected
input data together with the dimensions.

The results of applying our approach to the experimental
data can be seen in Table III. The number of edges and vertices
of the resulting graph is compared with a graph assumed to be
fully connected (using all vertices of the spatial data objects).
A fully connected graph represents the best possible real-world
correlation (because nearly every path is present) but the least
quality with respect to the applicability. Tests on small cut-outs
of the experimental areas have shown that the optimization
result using the generated graph equals the result using the
fully connected graph.

To evaluate the performance of the graph generation pro-
cess, we measured the duration of the described approach.
The application was realized using programming languages
from the .NET Framework. Each algorithm, the user interface,
as well as the control logic was implemented in the object-
oriented programming language C#. The described rule-based
system was realized using the functional programming lan-
guage F#. The experiments were carried out on a standard
personal computer with the following setup:
• OS: Microsoft Windows Server 64bit.
• CPU: 3.5GHz Dual Core.
• RAM: 8 GByte.

The performance of the graph generation process can be
seen in Table IV. As expected, the duration corresponds to
the number of spatial objects enclosed in the area. For the
simple reason that the graph needs to be generated only once,
the duration is reasonable and acceptable.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, an approach for the generation and weighting
of a network graph has been proposed. Introducing a nor-
malization format called NGB to support a fully automated
process of generating graphs using a wide range of hybrid
spatial data as the input.
The experiments show that the approach is effective and
efﬁcient and that the weighted graph can be used as basic
input into mathematical optimization algorithms. As a future
investigation, we intend to explore ways to reduce the time
needed for the graph generation process.
