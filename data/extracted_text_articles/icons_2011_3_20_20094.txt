Abstract—While current research focuses on Enhanced 3rd 
Generation and IMT-Advanced mobile systems, many 
advanced techniques are investigated by world-wide research 
institutes and standard organization, such as Multi-Input 
Multi-Output, Coordinated Multi-Point and coordinated 
multi-antenna cellular network architecture. Based on these 
novel techniques, the access control strategies also need to be 
developed. Based on Maximum Utility Principle Access 
Control method, improved access control algorithm with 
combination of scheduling for coordinated multi-antenna 
cellular architectures is proposed in this paper. Two 
algorithms are brought out with the Proportional Fairness and 
Maximum C/I utility function respectively. By application in 
Coordinated Multi-Point based Group Cell architecture, 
performance evaluation and analyses verify the merits of two 
proposed algorithms in improving system throughput, user 
fairness and efficiency of system resources usage.

 INTRODUCTION 
The objective of the Enhanced 3rd Generation (E3G), 4G 
has been anticipated to provide users after the year 2010 with 
the data rate up to 100Mbps or 1Gbps in mobility 
environments [1-2]. Numerous research plans and projects 
towards E3G and 4G have been initiated in Europe, East 
Asia 
and 
North 
America, 
etc. 
Many 
international 
standardization organizations, such as 3GPP Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) [1] and LTE-Advanced [3], have initialized 
the research and standardization of E3G systems. Moreover, 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has also 
launched 4G standardization work, named IMT-Advanced 
[4]. 
With the research and development for E3G and 4G 
systems, a lot of advanced physical layer technologies show 
their merits to be applied in next generation mobile 
telecommunication systems. Among these techniques, the 
multi-antenna techniques and multi-carrier techniques, such 
as Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) and Orthogonal 
Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM), show their merits in 
improving system capacity and coverage. MIMO and OFDM 
techniques have been standardized in 3GPP LTE system as 
key 
techniques 
of 
E3G 
physical 
layer. 
Moreover, 
Coordinated Multi-Point joint transmission was proposed in 
3GPP LTE-Advanced standard work as a key technique to 
mitigate Inter Cell Interference and further improve the cell-
edge performance [5-6]. In this approach, if both data and 
channel of all users could be shared in real time, adjacent 
base stations could act as a single and distributed antenna 
array and hence, data to a user is simultaneously transmitted 
from multiple base stations to improve the received signal 
quality. Notice that Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) 
techniques have been already implemented in Group Cell 
architecture [7-8] with coordinated multi-antennas as early as 
2001, which has been implemented in China Beyond 3G 
(B3G) 
Future 
Technologies 
for 
Universal 
Radio 
Environment (FuTURE) TDD systems in B3G trial network 
with OFDM, and MIMO techniques, etc. 
Accordingly with the evolution of physical layer 
techniques, the Media Access Control (MAC) and Radio 
Resource Management (RRM) techniques are all facing the 
requirements for evolution. Furthermore, in order to apply 
CoMP joint transmission effectively, traditional RRM 
strategies for cooperation among coordinated cells also need 
to be evolved either.  
The access control methods used in 2G/3G systems [9-10] 
cannot accommodate the features of coordinated multi-
antenna cellular architecture, especially for users served by 
coordinated multiple antennas. There are a lot of challenges 
for coordinated multi-antenna access control strategy, such 
as the optimization of choosing multi-antennas to form the 
coordinated transmission set for access users, the definition 
of admission threshold for access users and the principal of 
admission and rejection etc.  
In [11], Maximum Utility Principle Access Control 
(MUPAC) method for coordinated multi-antenna cellular 
architecture with application in Group Cell architecture was 
brought out as an example. MUPAC method can maximum 
the usage of limited system resources with guaranteeing 
access users’ QoS requirements based on defined utility 
functions [11]. Furthermore, through MUPAC method, the 
interference increasing caused by access users can also be 
mitigated maximally and the accessing success probability, 
accessed user number can also be improved. 
With MUPAC method, when the system is under heavy-
load situation, MUPAC can fully show its merits in improve 
resource usage efficiency. However if the system is 
relatively light loaded and the capacity is enough for more 
users, MUPAC method may not fully use system capability 
to serve users with its best, because MUPAC cares more on

the minimum QoS requirements for resource utility rather 
not on users better performance. So, scheduling can be used 
in combination with MUPAC method to solve this problem 
and improve user service experience after access success 
ratio improvement.  
This paper presents two improvement algorithms based 
on MUPAC with scheduling utility function. One is 
Throughput Targeted MUPAC (TT-MUPAC) and another is 
Throughput and Fairness Targeted MUPAC (TFT-MUPAC) 
algorithm. 
In Section II, MUPAC method is briefly introduced with 
an application example in coordinated multi-antenna Group 
Cell architecture. In Section III, TT-MUPAC and TFT-
MUPAC are described in details combining with scheduling 
in access control. The performance evaluation and 
simulation results are stated in Section IV. Finally, there 
comes the conclusion. 
II. 
MAXIMUM UTILITY PRINCIPLE ACCESS CONTROL 
STRATEGY IN GROUP CELL ARCHITECTURE 
In order to further improve performance for the cell edge 
users, CoMP will be applied in LTE-Advanced. CoMP 
implies 
dynamic 
coordination 
among 
multiple 
geographically separated transmission points, which involves 
two schemes with coordinated scheduling and joint 
processing/transmission. By aggregating the joint processing 
of multiple cells, CoMP technology can increase the 
throughputs on the cell-edge. A typical system model for 
coordinated multi-antenna cellular architecture is Group Cell, 
which is described in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1. Group Cell Architecture with CoMP 
In Group Cell architecture, users in the system are served 
by more than one antenna (Group Cell) included in Access 
Points (AP). The access control method in the Group Cell 
needs to solve the problem of how to choose multiple 
antennas to form the serving Group Cell and allocate 
appropriate resources to users. The size of Group Cell can be 
adjustable for users by their QoS requirements. Therefore, by 
adding antenna with maximum utility to user’s current 
serving Group Cell step by step to fulfill the users’ QoS 
requirements can solve this problem. This solution can 
maximize the usage of limited system resources with 
guaranteeing access users’ QoS requirements. Furthermore, 
the interference caused by new users can also be mitigated 
maximally and the accessing success probability can also be 
improved. 
The steps of adding antennas with maximum utility can 
be accomplished based on Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm 
[12] in Graph Theory. Based on Dijkstra's Shortest Path 
Algorithm, when there are new users initiate their access 
attempts in Group Cell architecture, the shortest path in the 
Dijkstra's Algorithm can be replaced by the minimal cost of 
accessing process. The cost of accessing process includes the 
interference to other users and occupying system resources 
(antennas, channels and other resources). Furthermore, the 
cost can be represented by the utility functions, including the 
gains for the access user and deterioration to other users. 
Therefore, the seeking for shortest path in Dijkstra's 
Algorithm can be transferred to seeking the antennas or 
resources with maximum utility. The Maximum Utility 
Principle can improve the system capacity and load ability. 
By the Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm and the Maximum 
Utility Principle, the user accessing in multi-antenna 
distributed Group Cell can be effectively accomplished. 
The utility function of MUPAC has two aspects, 
including the gain of new antenna added in current serving 
Group Cell and the deterioration for other users existed in the 
system. 
The utility function is shown as (1).

Figure 2. MUPAC process in Group Cell 
The application example of MUPAC in Group Cell 
architecture 
is 
shown 
in 
Figure 
2. 
The 
detailed 
implementation steps of MUPAC are shown as follows. 
1) Access user initiates access attempt. 
2) AP obtains the users’ receiving pilot strength of each 
antenna. 
3) Based on the information in step 2), AP calculates 
the utility of each antenna and available resource by utility 
function and chooses the first antenna and resource with the 
Maximum Utility Principle to form the serving Group Cell. 
If all the antennas detected by access user have no resource 
available, the access user will be transferred to the 
accessing waiting list. In Figure 2, the access user select 
antenna 1 as the first serving antenna with resource unit by 
Maximum Utility Principle. 
4) AP obtains the users’ receiving SINR of serving 
Group and compares it with user’s QoS requirement. If 
current serving Group can provide adequate QoS to the 
user, the access process accomplishes successfully. Vice 
verse, the access user need more antennas added to the 
current serving Group. In Figure 2, the access user needs 
more antennas to get its desired QoS. So, antenna 2 is 
chosen to be added in current serving Group Cell.  
5) AP obtains the users’ receiving SINR of antennas 
excluding current serving Group and chooses the antenna 
with maximum utility to add it to the serving Group Cell. 
This step needs to guarantee the new antenna and current 
serving Group Cell to use the same resource. The utility 
function includes the penalty of resource changing. Then, 
goes to step 4). In Figure 2, antenna 3 is added and the 
serving Group Cell of 1, 2 and 3 has enough quality to serve 
the user with resource unit M. 
III. 
MAXIMUM UTILITY PRINCIPLE ACCESS CONTROL 
WITH SCHEDULING 
When we are choosing the algorithms for access control, 
we always care about the quality of services, as well as the 
efficiency of resource which is associated with the system 
capacity. Ensuring the QoS of access users’ communications, 
MUPAC method gives the least sources to users to reach a 
minimum acceptable QoS. Considering the variable mobile 
communication environments and multi-user diversity, also 
the service experience of users, it will be helpful to 
implement scheduling into the process of access control for 
coordinated multi-antenna cellular architecture. 
A. Throughput Targeted-MUPAC 
In order to enable better use of the resources and 
reaching higher system throughput, we should consider using 
scheduling in access control to adapt to different 
environments and make full use of the resources. When the 
system load is light, MUPAC is not good enough, especially 
in the condition of dealing with data services. If we make full 
use of system resources and increase the system throughput, 
it would be beneficial to either the users or the system. TT-
MUPAC brings out a good consideration on this point. 
TT-MUPAC strategy gives different resources to 
different users in access control which depends on the 
system conditions. If the system is heavy-loaded with many 
services required, it gives the user the least resource to reach 
the required QoS. On the other hand, if the system is 
relatively light-loaded and there are many resources 
available, the access users will get most resource to improve 
system throughput.  
In TT-MUPAC strategy, MAX C/I scheduling is 
employed. The key point of combination of MAX C/I and 
MUPAC is to give some users more resource to get multi-
user diversity in the system. In this way, we can improve the 
system throughput obviously.

B. Throughput and Fairness Targeted-MUPAC 
TT-MUPAC brings some advantages on system 
throughput, but when it comes to user fairness, the 
performance is decreased. Throughput and fairness are both 
important in access control strategy. So we should make 
some improvements on MUPAC and TT-MUPAC methods 
to reach a better performance on throughput and fairness. 
TFT-MUPAC method is proposed to achieve a balance 
between fairness and system throughput.  
In the TFT-MUPAC strategy, the utility function of TFT-
MUPAC should consider both system throughput and user 
fairness. In order to include the consideration of fairness into 
the access control strategy, we add a fairness factor into the 
utility function to present the improvement.

The flow chart of TFT-MUPAC is show in the Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3. TFT-MUPAC method Flow Chart 
In the TFT-MUPAC strategy, antennas are allocated to 
receive a fairer QoS. At the same time the system throughput 
is also considered. Proportional fairness scheduling method 
is employed. In this way, system carries out a good 
performance on both system throughput and fairness. 
IV. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
For the performance evaluation and analyses, MUPAC 
method is taken for performance comparing based on 
coordinated 
multi-antenna 
Group 
Cell 
architecture. 
Maximum Utility Principle Access Control chooses antennas 
and allocates resources according to the Maximum Utility 
Principle. The Group Cell size of Maximum Utility Principle 
Access Control method is limited up to 4. TT-MUPAC and 
TFT-MUPAC employs scheduling with MAX C/I and 
Proportional Fairness algorithms. System-level simulation is 
adopted to evaluate these three access control methods by 
comparing the successfully accessed user numbers with 
different system load (total access user number generated), 
system throughput and fairness. The power allocation for 
these three algorithms is the same as fixed power allocation 
scheme. The simulation parameters and setting are shown in 
Table I.

The simulation results are shown in Figure 4 to Figure 8. 
Figure 4 shows the system throughput of MUPAC and 
TT-MUPAC. 
TT-MUPAC 
has 
obvious 
throughput 
advantage over MUPAC scheme. The reason for this 
throughput gain mainly comes from multi-user diversity with 
MAX C/I scheduling. MUPAC only guarantees the 
minimum requirements of access users’ QoS for maximum 
resource efficiency. By TT-MUPAC, scheduling is to 
improve the throughput with light load. 
Figure 5 shows the access success rate of MUPAC and 
TT-MUPAC. TT-MUPAC is better than MUPAC, because 
TT-MUPAC use more resources for few users to get more 
throughputs. The relatively low efficiency of resource utility 
makes access users having less available resources and lows 
down the access success rate. 
Figure 6 shows the fairness of access users based on 
MUPAC and TT-MUPAC by SINR variance. From the 
simulation results, TT-MUPAC has worse fairness than 
MUPAC. This is the nature of MAX C/I scheduling method.
