INTRODUCTION 
 
The scarcity of radio spectrum has been a major 
bottleneck in cellular mobile communications [1]. An 
increase in high capacity and data rate demands due to the 
recent growth of mobile data traffic puts a further burden on 
the licensed spectrum of a Mobile Network Operator 
(MNO). Even though several attempts have been taken to 
address the spectrum scarcity issue, e.g., improving the 
utilization of the licensed spectrum, the situation has not 
been improved considerably. This causes MNOs to seek 
alternative solutions, and operating as well in the unlicensed 
bands has been found effective due to the availability of a 
large amount of spectrum in the unlicensed bands. 
 
Numerous studies [2]-[6] have already been carried on 
the coexistence of cellular and Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standards taking into 
account one or more of the following aspects, including the 
unlicensed 
spectrum 
band, 
coexistence 
mechanism, 
transmission 
mode, 
deployment 
scenario, 
regulatory 
requirement, design principle, and potential issue. For 
example, the authors in [3] studied Long-Term Evolution 
(LTE)-Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) and Wireless 
Fidelity (WiFi) coexistence in the 5 GHz with the 
corresponding deployment scenario. Similarly, in [4], the 
authors presented a coexistence study of Wi-Fi and LTE-in-
unlicensed by surveying a large parameter space of 
coexistence mechanisms and a range of representative 
network densities and deployment scenarios. Nevertheless, 
in [5], emphasizing unlicensed Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) 
bands, as well as considering the beam-based transmissions, 
the authors presented an overview of the major design 
principles and solutions to operate New Radio Unlicensed 
(NR-U) in unlicensed bands.  
Different from these above studies, in this paper, we 
provide a brief review on the coexistence of cellular and 
IEEE 802.11 standards by taking into account the 
coexistence of all existing and future cellular standards in all 
available unlicensed bands. Based on the existing literature, 
fundamental aspects for the coexistence of these two 
established wireless technologies, including coexistence 
fairness, related features, regulatory requirements, design 
principles, mechanisms, deployment scenarios, challenges, 
and convergence, are summarized. The detailed discussion 
on each aspect of the above aspects is out of the scope of 
this paper. However, for further information, a list of 
references is given in the end so that interested readers may 
refer to these references corresponding to any fundamental 
aspect mentioned alongside while discussing in this paper. 
 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II covers the 
discussion on the available unlicensed bands for the 
operation of cellular technologies. The condition for fair 
coexistence, as well as coexistence-related features, are 
discussed in Section III. Coexistence mechanisms and 
deployment scenarios are reviewed in Section IV and 
Section V, respectively. Finally, we highlight technical 
challenges and convergence of coexistence in Section VI. 
We conclude the review in Section VII.    
II. 
CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES IN UNLICENSED BANDS 
 
Cellular technologies may operate in one or more 
unlicensed spectrum bands, including 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 
GHz, and 60 GHz. Due to the similar propagation 
characteristics, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz are termed as 
sub-7 GHz, whereas 60 GHz as mmWave, bands. The first 
cellular-based technology extended with a view to operating 
only in the 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum is the Fourth-
Generation (4G) LTE in 2015. The two variants of LTE in 
the unlicensed band are LTE Unlicensed (LTE-U) in the 
Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 12 [7] 
and LAA in 3GPP Releases 13, 14, and 15 [8]-[12].  
 
However, operations in the mmWave have been 
permitted recently starting first with the Fifth-Generation 
(5G) NR-U [5], [13] technology in 3GPP Release 16.

Recently, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 
approved the 6 GHz band in the USA for spectrum sharing 
[14]. Likewise, Europe is considering allowing the 6 GHz 
band to use [15]. In line with so, 3GPP has recently released 
the specifications for NR-U in Release 16 where the 
provision for NR-U devices to operate in the 6 GHz band is 
incorporated [5], [16]. Hence, unlike LTE-U and LAA, NR-
U supports multiple unlicensed bands, including sub-7 GHz 
and mmWave bands.   
III. 
COEXISTENCE FAIRNESS AND RELATED FEATURE 
 
A major concern that is faced by each cellular 
technology is the Co-Channel Interference (CCI) from the 
incumbent IEEE 802.11 technologies operating in these 
unlicensed bands. This requires a proper and fair 
coexistence of cellular with IEEE 802.11 technologies. 
Though there is no concrete definition for fair coexistence, 
according to the 3GPP, the fair coexistence between a 
cellular network such as LTE and an IEEE 802.11 network 
such as WiFi is defined as follows: The capability of an 
LAA network not to impact WiFi networks active on a 
carrier more than an additional WiFi network operating on 
the same carrier, in terms of throughput and latency [17], 
[18]. Likewise, for NR-U, the coexistence requirement with 
WiFi/Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) remains the same as that in 
LAA [16]. However, it is to be noted that many 3GPP 
members might believe that fairness means cellular nodes 
and IEEE 802.11 Access Points (APs) should have half of 
the bandwidth. 
 
Developing a coexistence mechanism is challenging and 
hence knowledge about the coexistence-related features of 
both technologies, namely channel access mechanisms, 
Medium 
Access 
Control 
(MAC) 
protocols, 
design 
principles, and regulatory requirements, reasoned as 
follows, are crucial.  
 Channel access mechanisms: Since cellular technologies 
do not listen to the channel condition when scheduling 
resources and IEEE 802.11 technologies use the 
contention-based protocol to access a channel, it is not 
unusual that cellular nodes may block transmission of 
WiFi APs completely [3].  
 MAC protocols: Cellular technology uses continuous 
transmission of data in consecutive frames using a 
centralized scheduler. However, WiFi technology uses 
opportunistic transmission using the Carrier-Sense 
Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) 
protocol [7] to get access to an unlicensed channel.  Due 
to this disparity in MAC layer procedures, WiFi APs 
may get blocked by a cellular node as the interference 
level of a cellular network is likely to be above the 
threshold used by a WiFi network to detect the vacancy 
of a channel. Likewise, Because WiFi packets are 
transmitted always with maximum power, if WiFi APs 
can get access to a channel, they can cause interference 
to a cellular network. 
 Design principles: Cellular technology, such as LTE is 
designed with an assumption that LTE can transmit with 
a small-time gap continuously and periodically. 
However, WiFi is designed to coexist with other 
technologies through random backoff and channel 
sensing, which allows a WiFi AP a little chance to sense 
a clear channel and transmit. Due to this reason, a WiFi 
AP moves to the silence mode causing its performance 
degradations, while any LTE node remains almost 
unaffected [3].    
 Regulatory requirements: Regulatory requirements to 
operate different cellular technologies in unlicensed 
bands vary from one country or region to another. For 
example, though countries such as the USA, China, 
India, and South Korea [3] do not require cellular 
technologies such as LTE to be Listen-Before-Talk 
(LBT) enabled, LBT is mandatory in Japan and Europe. 
LBT is a contention-based medium access technique 
similar to the CSMA/CA mechanism used by WiFi [5], 
meaning that LBT does not allow a cellular node to 
occupy a channel at all times. Since LTE-U does not 
implement the LBT mechanism, it can be used in the 
USA, China, India, and South Korea. Instead, as LAA is 
LBT enabled, LAA can be used worldwide [3]. 
IV. 
COEXISTENCE MECHANISM 
Coexistence mechanisms can be developed in two ways 
depending on whether or not modifications on the existing 
cellular networks are employed. If modifications are 
employed, a cellular network is enabled with the LBT 
mechanism to avoid CCI with other existing transmissions 
by backing off or moving to another channel. LBT shares a 
channel between a cellular node and a WiFi AP fairly [7] by 
enabling a cellular node to stop periodically its channel 
occupancy and to detect the activities of other shared nodes 
at a millisecond-level [7] to avoid CCI. Since LAA is LBT 
enabled, this approach is used in LAA. 
On the other hand, if modifications are not employed, a 
cellular network cannot be enabled with LBT. Numerous 
coexistence mechanisms without employing LBT have been 
proposed by exploiting different domains to manage CCI, 
particularly, Channel Selection (CHS) in frequency-domain 
[19], [20], Carrier Sense Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) 
[20], [21] and Fully Blank Subframe (FBS) [22], [23] in 
time-domain, and Transmit Power Control (TPC) in power-
domain [24], [25], [26]. A key feature of each of these 
mechanisms is that none requires modifications on existing 
cellular networks.  
In the frequency and time domains, the principle of 
coexistence is based on maintaining the orthogonal 
transmission of each coexisting node in frequency and time, 
respectively [27], [28], [29]. In other words, only one node, 
i.e., either a WiFi AP or a cellular node, can transmit at a 
time to avoid a collision. However, in the power domain, 
CCI can be controlled by applying the power control 
14

method (i.e., adjusting the output power) to cellular nodes 
[24], [25], [26]. As LTE-U is not LBT enabled, this 
approach can be used in LTE-U by exploiting any domain.  
Besides, since in practice, the WiFi traffic is bursty, it 
results in a huge amount of white spaces between WiFi 
frames. WiFi white spaces create a huge source of spectrum 
for cellular technologies such as LTE-U [30] that can 
exploit these white spaces to transmit opportunistically. In 
this regard, Markov Modulated Batch Poisson Process 
Model [30] and Reinforcement Learning Technique [31] are 
examples of approaches to exploit WiFi white spaces. 
Further, Neural Networks Technology [32] and Graph-based 
mechanisms [33] can also be employed to enable the 
coexistence between cellular and IEEE 802.11 technologies 
in the unlicensed spectrum.  
V. 
COEXISTENCE DEPLOYMENT SCENARIO 
 
Because the supported enabling technologies, including 
Carrier Aggregation (CA), Dual Connectivity (DC), and 
standalone operation, of one cellular standard vary from the 
other, coexistence deployment scenarios of cellular 
standards vary accordingly. For example, using the CA 
technology, three deployment scenarios for LTE-U standard 
in heterogeneous networks [34] and four deployment 
scenarios for Small Cells (SCs) in LAA [35] are defined by 
3GPP. Since NR-U can exploit the DC and standalone 
operation additionally, five deployment scenarios are 
defined by 3GPP for NR-U [16], [36].  
 
It is to be noted that DC and CA modes play major roles 
in connecting User Equipments (UEs) over unlicensed 
bands. In DC, data of a UE can be exchanged 
simultaneously with more than one Next Generation 
NodeBs (gNBs)/Evolve NodeBs (eNBs) [36]. However, in 
the CA, data of a UE can be exchanged simultaneously with 
a gNB/eNB through multiple contiguous or noncontiguous 
bands [36]. Due to this reason, while the CA can help 
improve the throughput, the DC can improve throughput, as 
well as reliability. Moreover, in the DC, failure of the 
primary link does not impact the secondary links [36].  This 
implies a major improvement for the deployment of NR in 
unlicensed bands with respect to that of LTE-U and LAA. In 
Table I, numerous aspects of 3GPP-based different cellular 
standards are compared. 
VI. 
COEXISTENCE CHALLENGE AND CONVERGENCE 
A. Coexistence Challenge 
 
Several technical challenges remain unaddressed across 
different layers for the coexistence of cellular standards and 
IEEE 802.11 standards. Few key challenges are as follows. 
 The main challenge for the coexistence of cellular and 
IEEE 802.11 standards comes from the major constraints 
to design an efficient coexistence mechanism, including 
the lack of inter-Radio Access Technology (RAT) 
coordination, 
intercell 
interference 
management, 
independent resource allocations from one RAT to 
another, and different MAC and Physical Layer (PHY) 
protocols [34].

 There exists a continuous dispute over the effectiveness 
of the existing coexistence mechanisms. For example, 
CSAT/FBS suffer from their weaknesses, i.e., ON/OFF 
periods for the duty-cycle of CSAT and non-blank 
subframe duration of an FBS pattern period are 
controlled by the cellular node, and WiFi APs adapt to 
this change, resulting in poor WiFi performances [3]. 
 In unlicensed bands, no interference management like in 
the licensed bands exists between cellular and IEEE 
802.11 standards. Moreover, the current LBT does not 
allow 
neighboring 
cellular 
nodes 
to 
transmit 
simultaneously due to employing the contention-based 
opportunistic scheduling [37]. These result in allowing 
no simultaneous transmission of cellular and IEEE 
802.11 nodes, and hence no reuse of the same unlicensed 
spectrum spatially. 
 Unlike licensed bands, transmissions in unlicensed 
bands are discontinuous and opportunistic, particularly, 
for cellular standards using LBT such as LAA and NR-
U, which result in reduced efficiency and flexibility in 
Radio Resource Management (RRM) [37].  
 Interference scenarios in unlicensed bands are not 
predictable [37], resulting in increasing received 
interference signals due to opportunistic channel access 
from WiFi. 
 Unlike LTE-U and LAA, since NR-U operates as well in 
the 60 GHz mmWave band, using beam-based 
transmissions 
[5], 
LBT 
used 
in 
LAA 
with 
omnidirectional 
transmissions 
needs 
additional 
requirements to be addressed for beam-based NR-U. 
B. Coexistence Convergence  
Even though they differ in numerous critical features 
and compete with each other to access unlicensed bands, 
from the latest versions of the IEEE 802.11ax and 3GPP 
NR-U, it can be found that both technologies are converging 
15

to use large bandwidth in terms of aspects used in the radio 
access by introducing the best of both standards [13]. For 
example, WiFi has introduced cellular features such as 
Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) and Orthogonal 
Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Likewise, NR-
U adopts a short-length frame structure, flexible access, and 
LBT protocol used in WiFi to get adapt to the characteristics 
of unlicensed bands [13]. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have given a brief review of 
fundamental aspects for the coexistence of cellular and 
IEEE 802.11 standards. Unlike existing studies, the 
coexistence of all existing and future cellular standards in all 
available unlicensed spectrum bands has been considered. 
We have covered reasonably broad features necessary to 
understand the coexistence of cellular technologies in the 
unlicensed bands, including coexistence fairness, related 
features, 
regulatory 
requirements, 
design 
principles, 
mechanisms, 
deployment 
scenarios, 
challenges, 
and 
convergence, concisely. Based on the existing literature, the 
review in this paper aims at introducing readers to the key 
aspects for the coexistence of these two established wireless 
technologies in unlicensed bands.
