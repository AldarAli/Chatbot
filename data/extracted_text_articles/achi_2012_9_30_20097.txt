Abstract— The paper aims to study the adequacy of interactive 
capabilities in commercial navigation devices. In order to do 
this, an experiment is proposed and two sets of results are 
obtained and analyzed: one resulting from the application of 
objective metrics; and the other one, from subjective answers 
of the device users when queried about their experience. To the 
extent that these interactive capabilities are found to be 
inadequate, it is the goal of this study to ascertain (1) whether a 
more natural, human-like interaction paradigm (i.e., natural 
interaction) ought to be incorporated into these kinds of 
devices and, if so, (2) the extent to which their interactive 
capabilities improve as a result. For this, a direct comparison 
of device interactive capabilities with those of human beings is 
necessary. Study results suggest that the incorporation of 
natural interaction in navigation devices may help respond to 
certain device interactive inadequacies as well as to the user 
dissatisfaction which those inadequacies engender.

 INTRODUCTION 
Among the important challenges in the technological 
field today is that of the selection of the most suitable 
mechanisms by which particular devices interact with. It is 
broadly accepted that, for a given device, the most suitable 
interface is not necessarily the most complex one. Some 
interfaces have been used over many years and thus enjoy a 
high level of user familiarity (e.g., it is hard to imagine how 
to improve traffic lights for the sharing of a crossroads). In 
fact, for most devices, the simplest interface is often thought 
to be the best. For this reason, current trends point to 
minimalist interfaces [13], even for complex devices. Given 
particular contextual information, then, these devices should 
be able to find the right command. However, their use is not 
necessarily simple and may require including additional 
interfaces, leaving the minimalist interface as a shortcut. 
With users specifically in mind, intuitive interfaces are 
often sought out that are icon-based and supported by touch 
screens. However, as discussed in other studies [5], the 
ultimate user-oriented goal is achieving a system which 
behaves in a more human-like way and, more specifically, 
interacts with users in the same way that those users might do 
with other human beings. For this reason, voice technologies 
are applied to many systems – since they are more familiar 
and accessible for most users – and often complemented with 
a graphical user interface (GUI). Additionally, several 
systems have also been developed to emulate other aspects 
of human interaction such as dialogue strategies, turn-taking, 
adaptation to the interlocutor and contextual awareness.  
The present paper explores the suitableness of this sort of 
interaction paradigm in navigation devices. Since the tasks 
for which these devices are created are also regularly 
performed collaboratively by human beings, one may think 
that the application of the NI paradigm should be highly 
beneficial. Not surprisingly, then, recent years have seen the 
development of prototypes of multimodal interaction systems 
for guiding by several research groups in the field [10][15]. 
However, before such costly research is undertaken, it is 
advisable first to conclusively determine (1) whether the NI 
paradigm is, in fact, suitable for incorporation in navigation 
devices and (2) whether current navigation devices already 
possess sufficiently adequate interactive capabilities (i.e., 
without the incorporation of the NI paradigm). 
In the present case study, the interactive capabilities of a 
commercial device for pedestrian navigation supported by 
GPS are studied. In order to observe the results obtained 
through the incorporation of the NI paradigm in the device, a 
human tester is used to simulate the role of a more human-
like interface, while not interfering with the tasks performed. 
Finally, it is important to remember that collaborative 
task performance does not necessarily mean that participants 
are exclusively committed to its execution. Quite to the 
contrary, participants often juggle several concurrent goals– 
some shared and others individual. With this fact in mind 
and in order to ensure the realism in the experiments, both 
participants are assigned a second, background collaborative 
task to be performed simultaneously with the first. 
II. 
RELATED WORK ON HUMAN-LIKE INTERACTION 
Primarily for the purpose of achieving greater 
accessibility, NI research seeks to endow systems with more 
natural interactive capabilities. In this way, users with 
relatively little to no technological training are able to access 
information, applications and services provided by the 
system [5]. Furthermore, this sort of interaction offers a 
convenient 
and 
appealing 
alternative 
for 
more 
technologically literate individuals, as well, particularly 
when traditional modes of interaction become cumbersome. 
One of the principal features of human interaction is its 
flexibility with regard to both the conceptualization and 
expression of utterances. Human interlocutors exploit a wide 
range of lexical and expressional resources and dialogue 
strategies at their disposal. For quick adaptation to changes 
in the interaction, particular resources and strategies utilized 
by the interlocutor may be substituted for others at any 
moment. The reasons for this interactive behavior can be 
understood according to Grice’s conversational Maxims [8]: 
230

be sufficiently but not excessively informative (Maxim of 
Quantity), be truthful (Maxim of Quality), be relevant 
(Maxim of Relation) and be clear (Maxim of Manner). These 
Maxims have already been used by Harris [9] to support the 
evaluation of voice systems. 
It is important to emphasize, however, the fluid and 
overarching quality of the Gricean Maxims. In order to 
obtain a particular (and often non-literal) conversational 
result, for instance, Maxims may be consciously flouted by 
an interlocutor [3], essentially converting the Maxims into 
extensions of the dialogue strategies in the interlocutor’s 
arsenal. Additionally, interaction and its interpretation 
according to the Gricean Maxims in a particular case, is 
framed by different contextual aspects which may be 
classified as material (i.e., time, place, weather ...), semiotic, 
political, operative and socio-cultural environment [7]. 
Other important elements frequent in human interaction 
are interruptions [1]. Individuals are almost always in the 
process of performing tasks to achieve specific goals. While 
they may collaborate in the execution of a shared task, it is 
most often the case that those task participants are also 
simultaneously involved in the execution of several other 
tasks. When a particular individual needs to communicate 
information, this act will almost always result in the 
interruption of another task being executed by the receiver 
[12]. Even after the participants begin interacting, an 
utterance by one of them to the other may nevertheless be 
considered an interruption if either the former or latter 
participant happened, at the same time, to be in the middle of 
a different utterance (i.e., self-interruptions and locutive 
interruptions, respectively), to be talking about a different 
topic (i.e., dialogue line interruption) or to be using a 
different dialogue strategy (i.e., development interruption). A 
participant desiring make such an interruption decides to act 
or to refrain from acting on this desire based on an analysis 
of the costs and benefits resulting from the interruption 
[11][14]. However, those costs may nevertheless be reduced 
either through the employment of certain interaction 
techniques, such as pre-sequencing and displays of 
awareness [6], or by choosing the proper moment [2]. 
To endow a system with these interactive capabilities and 
characteristics, NI research seeks to gather knowledge about 
human interaction and reasoning mechanisms. A main trend 
in NI research is the classification and distribution of 
knowledge involved in the human interaction process across 
specialized models. Among some of the different types of 
models proposed in a previous study [4], interaction 
structures and intentions would be handled by a dialogue 
model, turn-taking by a presentation model, interlocutor 
characterization by a user model and context management by 
a situation model. Other frequently included components are 
the emotional models, task models, system (or self) models, 
ontology and, of course, interface components. Each 
particular knowledge distribution depicts an NI cognitive 
architecture, several examples of which being found in the 
literature [16]. These models are often implemented by 
autonomous agents 
[5] continuously 
processing the 
interaction and cooperating to achieve the global goal of a 
more natural human-like interaction. 
III. 
CASE STUDY EXPERIMENTS 
For the sake of clarity, the section is divided into five 
sub-sections detailing the design, preparation and results of 
the experiments. The discussion can be found in Section 4. 
A. Experiment Design 
The experiments conducted for this article studied the 
interaction between two individuals playing the roles of user 
and guide, where the former is the test subject and the latter 
the experiment leader. In addition to the latter’s role as 
guide, the experiment leader was also responsible for 
recording the interactions with the test subject, the breaks 
taken between experiments and the later interview of the test 
subject following the completion of the experiments. In 
addition to these two participants, a third participant 
shadowed the former two as an objective observer, manually 
noting down any important events that arose during the 
dialogue without ever directly intervening in the interaction 
itself. This observer was also responsible for conducting the 
post-experimental interview of the test subject. 
The interaction studied in these experiments was 
developed around the simultaneous execution of two distinct, 
high-level tasks: (1) a principal task of guiding a user along a 
route from a fixed start point to a fixed end point and (2) a 
background task of exchanging information (i.e., chatting) 
about a set of films proposed by the test subject. The 
background task was incorporated into the experiments in 
order to produce real human interactions in which 
participants are often engaged in the simultaneous execution 
of multiple tasks. Furthermore, the specific topic of this 
background task was chosen due to its emotionally-engaging 
nature, thereby commanding higher interactive commitment 
from the user [4]. Consequently, the importance given by the 
user to the main task, while still high, would nevertheless not 
be absolute and any unnecessary use of resources in its 
development, therefore, would detract from the development 
of the emotionally-engaging background task and most likely 
annoy the user. Finally, walking routes are preferred since 
they reduce risks and make easier to observe the test subject. 
Besides, and insofar as the experiments took place in a real 
environment requiring participant attention (e.g., awareness 
of road conditions to avoid being hit by a car), a third, low-
level task of environmental awareness was also considered. 
Consistent with what has been discussed in previous 
sections of the article, the main goal of these experiments 
was to observe the oral interactions produced by navigation 
devices (GPS) and to contrast them with human interactions 
produced in the same operational context. The experiments 
were supported by a GPS device chosen from among the 
most popular, commercially available models. It was carried 
by the experiment leader who hid GPS visual displays while 
ensuring that audio utterances were perfectly audible for the 
user. The leader was allowed to provide additional 
information for the development of the main, high-level task, 
but only if absolutely necessary and strictly limited to verbal 
utterances (i.e., avoiding spatial deixis through gestures). 
Since events occurring in the test environment during the 
execution of the principal high-level task and the low-level 
task were likely to grab the participants’ attention, several 
231

different navigation routes were developed and executed in 
the experiments by each test subject. The specific routes 
were designed for the experiments to reflect different levels 
of navigational difficulty through varied route lengths, 
numbers of hotspots (i.e., points where the user is more 
likely to get lost) and environmental elements (i.e., elements 
requiring different levels of attention to the low-level task). 
The routes were set prior to the execution of the 
experiments and were the same for all test subjects. Three 
routes were developed: one comprised entirely of roads, 
another comprised entirely of walkways and the third 
comprised of both roads and walkways. The routes were 
located to be executed in succession while, at the same time, 
allowing for a short break in a quiet area between each task. 
The routes were designed to take an hour to cover them all 
(including breaks). The test subjects were screened prior to 
the experiments to ensure that none was familiar with the 
destinations of the different routes or even the majority of 
roads or walkways traversed in order to reach those 
destinations. The experiment crew formed by the experiment 
leader and observer received training on the routes to be 
followed prior to the execution of the experiments. 
B. Participant Selection and Experiment Preparation 
In a preparatory phase of the experiments, the specific 
GPS device to be used, the routes to be followed and the test 
subjects to participate as users in the study were all 
preselected. For the selection of the device, a Garmin nüvi® 
navigator was chosen due to its wide commercial use and 
popularity. The three routes for the experiments were 
developed in the Spanish city of Leganés due its proximity to 
Madrid and fulfillment of the environmental requirements 
discussed earlier. The total length of the routes developed 
was less than 3 kilometers with an estimated total completion 
time – including breaks and travel times between routes – of 
less than one hour. Nevertheless, it was understood that 
actual route lengths and estimated completion times would 
likely vary from subject to subject, particularly in the case 
that a test subject misunderstood the instructions or selected 
a path different from that given by the navigator. Specific 
details about these routes (i.e., road, walkway and hybrid 
routes) are presented below in TABLE I.

As noted by the observer, road routes in the experiments 
appeared easier for navigation than others due to the 
restricted space for pedestrian transit and the fewer points 
along the route (i.e., hotspots) requiring a navigational 
decision by the test subject. However, the traffic likely to be 
present in the test environment would nevertheless pose 
greater dangers for the test subject, therefore requiring a 
greater dedication of interaction resources to the execution of 
the low-level task (i.e., environmental awareness).  
Regarding the selection of test subjects, 50 candidates 
were interviewed with the aim of obtaining a wide 
distribution of primary characteristics – such as age and 
experience with GPS devices – and secondary characteristics 
– such as personal sense of direction, experience with 
computers and experience with technological devices, in 
general. Of the candidates interviewed, 22 were selected in 
such a way as to maximize these distributions of primary and 
secondary 
characteristics, 
thereby 
producing 
more 
generalizable results. In order to reduce any potential effects 
of the route sequencing, all selected test subjects were given 
a training session prior to the experiments which included a 
description of the process and a brief trial run. 
C. Data Acquisition 
Experiments in this study were organized such that the 
data recorded would allow researchers to observe to what 
extent Gricean Maxims (see Section II) were met in the 
interaction between the GPS device and test subjects. While 
all Gricean Maxims were considered, less importance was 
given here to the Maxim of Quality insofar as a lack of 
“truthfulness” would not reflect the interaction quality, but 
rather the positioning technology precision, which is not the 
focus of the present study. Observations regarding temporal 
realization and interruptions were of particular interest, since 
both of them are characteristic of human-like interaction, yet 
frequently overlooked by classical interaction systems. 
In order to allow for the natural execution of tasks, it was 
deemed most appropriate here to employ a procedure of 
external observation followed by the subsequent collection 
of test subject impressions regarding the interaction and the 
experiments themselves. According to this procedure, the 
observer noted all important details and events in each case 
with specific attention paid to the details discussed below. 
Regarding the Gricean Maxim of Quantity, any moments 
where the device provided the user with either insufficient or 
excessive navigational information were to be noted down 
by the observer. They were respectively measured as user 
utterances made to request omitted information and useless 
interventions, both regarding total number of utterances. 
Nevertheless, as redundancy is not necessarily a negative 
indicator, but may, in fact, be required in certain cases, 
redundant device utterances were noted down by the 
observer, classified as either useful or superfluous and later 
analyzed. Where a device utterance was considered to be 
superfluous, the observer was also to detail the user’s 
reaction to the utterance, noting if the user responded with 
any signs of annoyance. Besides, as relevant information 
may nevertheless fail to fully produce its desired effect if not 
framed in the proper manner, the experiment observer was 
charged with recording the number of times a user requested 
clarification, hesitated or made an incorrect decision. 
All these observations were presented together according 
to the routes during which they were originally recorded. 
Since each route is of a different length and possesses a 
different number of hotspots, the effective comparison of 
results recorded requires a prior normalization of the data. 
For this normalization, the average execution time and 
number of decisions point for each route was calculated.

Apart from the details described above, the observer was 
instructed to record any comment or gesture made by the test 
subject during routes. Through breaks no notes were taken, 
for the test subject to feel less scrutinized and more willing 
to talk freely about the interaction experience. Comments 
made by the test subject during pauses were transcribed from 
the recordings following the completion of the experiments. 
In order to complete the subjective data obtained during 
the experiments, then, open interviews of test subjects were 
conducted (following the completion of the experiments) in 
which the interviewer (i.e., the observer) focused on five 
topics of specific relevance to the aims of the study: (1) the 
quantity of information provided, (2) the usefulness of the 
information provided, (3) the clarity of device utterances, (4) 
the timing of the utterances, and (5) the subjects’ preference 
to interact with a human being or a device in the execution of 
navigational tasks. Just as occurred during the pauses 
between routes and in order to ensure a relaxed interview 
environment and lively test subject responses, no manual 
notes were taken during the interview. Instead, questions and 
responses were recorded electronically and later transcribed. 
D. Objective Results from Observation 
Following the completion of the experiments, the data 
collected by the observer was prepared for analysis. Most 
interesting results recorded are presented in the following 
graphs. In Figure 1.a, the number of regular, redundant and 
clarificatory device utterances per hour is shown. The data is 
presented both for each specific route studied as well as for 
the experiments as a whole (i.e., the totality of the routes).

Figure 1.b presents the number of regular, redundant and

same as in Figure 1.a. From the data presented, road routes 
appear to require less interaction resources than the other 
types of routes studied. This corroborates the observer 
statements discussed in sub-section B. in which road routes 
were said to be slightly easier than the others.

Figure 1.b: System utterances per decision 
In the former figure, a large number of redundant 
utterances can be observed, jeopardizing the likelihood of a 
favorable analysis of the device with regard to the Maxim of 
Quantity. The significant number of clarification requests 
also corroborates this last point with regard to the Maxim of 
Quantity. Figure 2.a and Figure 2.b below offer this 
additional analysis by classifying the redundancies produced. 
As clearly visible in Figure 2.a, one out of every seven 
device utterances provided no new information or useful 
redundancies and, therefore, could have been avoided. 
Furthermore, almost half of the superfluous utterances were 
considered annoying by test subjects. As a result, it can be 
concluded that the navigational device’s interactive 
capabilities do not conform to Grice’s Maxim of Quantity.

Figure 2.a: Classification of redundancies (% totals) 
While of relatively lesser importance, it is nevertheless 
interesting to note here that Figure 2.b shows that 
unnecessary and annoying redundancy during walkway 
routes is greater than unnecessary not annoying redundancy. 
Therefore, redundancy is more likely to annoy users in 
walkways. This finding is at odds with the earlier difficulty 
assessment made by the experiment observer, according to 
which road routes were said to be easier.

Regarding the timing of device utterances, Figure 3.a 
reveals that 16.7% of all utterances were considered ill-timed 
by users, suggesting a relatively low degree of informational 
relevancy in these cases. Although the contents of device 
utterances are, strictly speaking, limited to information 
relevant to the navigational task, the untimeliness and 
exaggerated redundancy of utterances may lead one to 
conclude that the interactive capabilities of the navigation 
device do not satisfy Grice’s Maxim of Relation, either.

Furthermore, untimely utterances may also endanger the 
success of the interaction. Figure 3.a shows that users found 
23% of all device utterances confusing. With such a high 
percentage of imprecise or confusing utterances, clearly the 
Maxim of Manner is not satisfied by the interactive 
capacities of the navigational device, either. As illustrated in 
Figure 3.b, untimely and confusing utterances account jointly 
for the fact that users hesitated in 14% of all decisions made 
and that 7.7% of all decisions made were incorrect.

Figure 3.b: Percent of user decisions with mistakes or hesitations 
Finally, the graphs demonstrate that walkway routes 
involve fewer user mistakes and hesitations despite similarly 
elevated percentages of ill-timed and confusing utterances. 
Similarly, almost all users appeared to the observer to be 
more relaxed and self-confident in walkway routes than in 
other routes. While these results may seem strange given the 
walkway routes’ greater relative difficulty, they can 
nevertheless be explained by taking into account (1) the 
higher number of user requests for clarification (see Figures 
1.a and 1.b) and (2) the greater insignificance of the 
environment events (i.e., the low-level task) present in the 
walkway routes. Consequently and to revise an earlier 
conclusion, it appears that car traffic in the environment does 
in fact affect test subjects who utter fewer requests for 
clarification despite harboring greater doubts regarding the 
correctness of their navigational decisions. Regarding the 
hybrid route, users appeared to have problems particularly 
when moving from a pedestrian walkway to a road. This is 
understandable when one considers the fact that while 
continuous, contextual changes affect the user significantly, 
the non-human-like navigation device is incapable of 
adapting its interactions to these contextual shifts. 
E. Subjective Results 
The subjective opinions of test subjects regarding their 
interactions with the navigation devices were gathered in 
open interviews following the execution of the different 
route tasks and later analyzed by the researchers. The results 
obtained are presented below in Figures 4.a to 4.d.  
Figure 4.a illustrates that all test subjects thought that the 
device should have provided more information on at least 
some occasions, yet very few subjects found a lack of 
information in device utterances to be the norm. Figure 4.b 
shows that most users considered that the system produced 
more utterances than were necessary. While only a third of 
users characterized the interaction as not redundant, the 
remaining users believed the interaction to have been 
unnecessarily redundant, with almost half of whom 
considering the redundancies to be annoying to the point of 
jeopardizing the success and tolerability of the interaction.

Relevancy, on the other hand, can be examined from 
Figures 4.b and 4.c. User opinions regarding the usefulness 
of device utterances are particularly low. Not only were 
interactions viewed as unnecessarily redundant, but most 
users also believed the devices to have provided ill-timed 
information (i.e., either too early or too late), with more than 
a third of whom having believed this untimeliness to be the 
norm for the devices. It is clear yet again that the interactive 
capabilities of the devices do not meet the Maxim of Relation. 
Regarding manner, 45% of users considered device 
utterances confusing. However and as shown in Figure 4.d, 
when asked about the causes of those errors in the navigation 
process, nearly the same, large percentage of users believed 
the errors to have been caused either by a lack of clarity or 
by a lack of information. 
Finally, when confronted directly on the question of 
preference between a human guide or navigation device, the 
vast majority of test subjects stated a preference for the 
human guide, with only 9% of subjects stating a preference 
for the navigation device. Among this 9% of subjects 
preferring the navigation device, the majority were highly 
technologically trained individuals who either (1) enjoyed 
daily experience with similar devices or (2) possessed an 
engineering degree and spent over 10 hours per day with 
computers. When asked about the reasons for their expressed 
preference, over 70% of users mentioned that human beings 
are more precise and can adapt their utterances to the 
circumstances of the interaction. Users preferring navigation 
devices tended to focus on their availability and speed.. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
From the objective results presented in the previous 
section, it is clear that the Gricean Maxims of Quantity and 
Relation are not met by the interactions of the navigation 
device. The interaction, however, may still be considered 
good enough insofar as only one device utterance out of 
every seven was of no use and less than half of these useless 
utterances annoyed users. Nevertheless, the interactions lead 
to frequent user hesitation (in approximately 14% of user 
decisions made) and multiple user errors (in 8% of user 
decisions made). This last fact is likely due to the lack of 
234

ACHI 2012 : The Fifth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interactions

timely and precise device utterances (one out of every six 
device utterances was ill-timed and nearly one out of every 
four device utterances was confusing in some way) revealing 
the inadequacy of device utterances in meeting the Maxim of 
Manner. It must be noted that while navigation device 
interactions may be correctly and satisfactorily developed 
under optimal conditions, real circumstances are rarely if 
ever optimal. Thus, it may be concluded that the Gricean 
Maxims are rarely if ever met by these devices’ interactions. 
Despite these conclusions, however, defenders of 
navigation devices might argue that any mistake made may 
be quickly addressed and corrected by the device through the 
recalculation of a new route. Furthermore, human interaction 
is far from perfect, either. While this may be true, however, 
the impact of the interaction on other concurrently executed 
tasks is definitive. Additionally, comments recorded during 
breaks from route executions revealed some novice users to 
have held unrealistically high expectations for the navigation 
device and other users to have been prejudiced against 
technology. Finally, while test subjects knew nothing about 
the ultimate goal of the experiments – the evaluation of the 
interactive capabilities of navigation devices – they 
nevertheless sensed that navigation device technology was 
being closely examined. As a result and given particular user 
profiles, some users may have been inclined to more 
vehemently defend the devices than they would have done 
otherwise, while other users may have done just the opposite.

CONCLUSIONS AND AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH 
This study has aimed to assess the quality of interactions 
developed by current navigation devices and to see whether 
other interactive paradigms could be considered for them. 
Although some features of human interaction, such as audio 
channel, have been incorporated into the devices, they are 
still quite mechanical and primitive compared with fully-
human interaction. Among the principal weaknesses of these 
devices is their inability to adapt to circumstances involving 
the interlocutor or the interaction itself. This lack of 
adaptability leads to errors in the quantity of information 
provided, as well as in the timeliness and manner of the 
utterances produced. These shortcomings can be overcome 
through the inclusion of a natural, human-like NI paradigm. 
Notice, however, that while this is clearly the case, NI 
research is not yet mature enough to completely address this 
necessity. Besides, improvements could still be included in 
navigation devices as new advances in NI research are made. 
These gradual, small upgrades should be made while, at the 
same time, attempting to avoid conflicts resulting from 
excessively high user expectations. In any case, even if the 
NI upgrades were complete, the devices would still not likely 
achieve perfect marks from users. Expert human guides do 
not generally receive perfect user marks, either. 
Concerning the methodology used in the experiments of 
the present study, it seems adequate for obtaining useful 
information on the weaknesses of current navigation 
technologies. Gricean Maxims also proved a good point of 
reference for the comparison of human and non-human 
interaction paradigms. However, as interactive capabilities of 
devices continue to evolve and include more and more 
human-like interactive strategies (e.g., flouting the Gricean 
Maxims), a more sophisticated theoretical background will 
be necessary for their complete assessment. For this reason, 
it would be particularly advantageous for future assessments 
to develop a tailored evaluation methodology for NI systems.
