Abstract—In order to reduce sensor node power consumption 
and interference, high gain antennas are required for the base 
station (BS) but this means multiple BS antennas are required 
for 360° area coverage. A high gain beam-forming antenna is the 
key to base stations covering “spotty service areas” more 
effectively and reducing interference, especially in the ISM bands. 
To solve the size and side lobe issues of conventional beam-
forming antennas, this paper proposes the “narrowly spaced” 
patch antenna array. The measured performance of a prototype 
confirms that while being 2/3rds smaller than conventional 
antennas, it has lower side lobe levels (-20dBc) and high antenna 
gain (10dBi).

I. INTRODUCTION  
In order to realize wide area sensor networks, low energy 
critical infrastructure monitoring (LECIM) has been attracting 
attention resulting in the 802.15.4k standard of the IEEE802 
Standards committee. Since sensor nodes in wide area sensor 
networks are expected to offer long lifetimes with battery 
power, high gain base station antennas are required for 
reducing sensor node power consumption. High gain base 
station antennas are also a good solution to mitigating 
interference, a major problem in Industry-Science-Medical 
(ISM) band wireless communications systems [1-3]. Base 
station antennas that offer beam steering capability are also 
suitable for some wide area sensor networks, such as those for 
agriculture applications, where sensor nodes are closely 
located in multiple spots. Furthermore, 2-dimensonal (2-D) 
beam-forming is more suitable for multiple spot 
communications. The beam forming antenna composed of 
phased array antennas is a good candidate due to its high gain 
and electrical 2-dimensional beam steering. However, the 
traditional phased array antenna with more than λ/2 element 
separation is not suitable for wide area sensor network base 
station antennas since it is physically large and the antenna 
pattern side lobes are significantly high. The sheer size 
increases installation difficulties and decreases wind 
tolerances. Since conventional uniform distribution phased 
array antennas [4-6] have larger side lobe level than fixed 
directive antennas, such as sector antennas [7-9], the 
traditional phased array antenna increases interference to/from

other systems. Resently, narrow beam phased array antenna 
were proposed [10-11] for radar applications. Since the 
narrow beam antenna required more than 10-elements with 
more than l/2 element separation, these antennas are not 
suitable for base satiation antennas due to antenna size issue. 
In order to realize small, low side lobe, and high gain beam-
forming antennas for wireless sensor networks base stations, 
we have proposed a beam-forming antenna composed of 
narrowly-spaced patch antennas. Due to electromagnetic 
simulator advancement, the phased array antenna with less 
than l/2 element separation can be designed and simulated 
well. By using an unconventionally small element separation 
and balancing antenna gain against side lobe levels, we can 
realize small, low side lobe and high gain antennas. 
Since the proposed antenna offers a half power beam width 
(HPBW) of 60 – 80 degrees, 6 elements of the proposed 
antenna will be combined for 360 degree coverage as shown 
in Figure 1.  
This paper is organized as follows. Section II proposes a 1-
D low side lobe beam forming antenna to separate the service 
areas by horizontal degrees, such as 60 degrees per beam and 
Section III describes the corresponding 2-D beam forming 
antenna design which will be used to radiate the sensors by 
spots with horizontal and vertical beam-steering. Section IV 
summarizes our work on the proposed small, low side lobe and 
high gain beam-forming antennas

II. 1-DIMENSIONAL BEAM-FORMING ANTENNA 
A high gain base station antenna is preferable to separate 
the service areas by horizontal degrees such as 60 degrees per 
beam. This creates following advantage against Omni base 
station antenna in star topology networks: (i) each sensor node 
needs to transmit less power by assuming up-link and down 
link budgets are balanced under maximum transmit EIRP is 
limited by radio regulation, (ii) the system will receive much 
less interference such as 1/6 when 6 element antenna is used, 
(iii) the system can achieve much higher spectrum efficiency 
such as 3 times when 6 element antenna is used.  
For practical applications, base station antenna beam 
forming capability is preferable to adjust the direction of each 
beam to radiate the power efficiently for where sensor nodes 
are located. For this beam-forming antenna, we propose a 
methodology to give mutual couplings between antenna 
elements intentionally contrast to the traditional antenna 
design. A small, high gain and planer antenna element is 
desired for the narrow-element-separation phased array. Patch 
type antennas are easy to connect to micro strip lines (MSL) 
and antenna size is reduced by using high relative permittivity 
substrates. The designed single patch element is shown in 
Figure 2. The patch antenna is fed by a MSL and radiates on 
the Z-axis. The antenna has 10mm wide notches for 
impedance matching. The substrate material is FR-4 whose 
permittivity is 4.12 and tan δ is 0.019 at around 900MHz. 
Patch antenna element width and height are set at 81.2mm to 
suit the working frequency of 920-928MHz that is allocated

for sensor networks in Japan; MSL width is 6.95mm with 
input impedance of 50 ohm. The element size, 81.2mm 
(0.25λ) is suitable for small element separation arrangements. 
Gain and input reflection of the patch element were simulated 
by an electromagnetic simulator (HFSS v12.1). As shown in 
Figure 3, its peak gain is 6.28dBi and HPBW is 98degrees. 
Reflection is less than -10dB from 920MHz to 928MHz as 
shown in Figure 4. These characteristics confirm that the 
proposed single patch antenna is suitable for a beam-forming 
antenna element. 
A four-element beam-forming antenna composed of narrowly-
spaced linear array antennas was simulated and measured. The 
results confirm that the proposal offers small, low side lobe 
and high gain beam-forming antennas. The key design 
procedure is to determine the best element separation for more 
than 10 dBi gain, and -20dBc side lobe. This trade off was 
balanced by using an electromagnetic simulator. As shown in 
Figure 5, in order to achieve better than -20dBc side lobes, the 
element separation should be 113mm or smaller. For more 
than 10dBi gain, element separation should be 113mm or 
larger as shown in Figure 6. From these results, the separation 
of 113mm can realize small, high gain and low side lobe 
beam-forming antennas. 
The beam-forming antenna composed of the resulting 
antenna is shown in Figure 7. When compared to traditional 
λ/2 separation designs, this structure reduces antenna size by 
35 percent. The simulated reflections of each element

is  shown in Figure 8. Element reflection is less than -10dB 
from 920MHz to 928MHz. The proposed antenna has more 
than 10dBi gain and -20dBc side lobe as shown in Figure 9. 
Based on electromagnetic simulation results, a prototype was 
designed, fabricated and measured. Measured reflection results 
are shown in Figure 10. The measurement results show the 
resonance point shift by 1MHz from the simulation and this is 
caused by fabrication error. The designed antenna gain / 
directivity have been measured in an anechoic chamber by 
comparing with an Omni antenna as shown in Figure 11. The 
prototype antenna is connected with the phase shifter (PS) 
board and signals are fed from a signal generator (SG) (The 
measured frequency is 923MHz). Receiver antenna, which is a 
sleeve antenna with 2dBi gain, is set at 4.8m from the

the results show that proposed concept is suitable for creating 
1-dimensional beam-forming antennas 
III. 2-DIMENSIONAL BEAM-FORMING ANTENNA 
For wide area sensor networks, 2-D beam-forming antennas  
are more useful and size reduction is more important than is 
true for 1-D ones. In order to design 2-D beam forming 
antennas composed of 16-element narrowly-spaced patch 
antenna arrays, the element separation was optimized by using 
an electromagnetic simulator. As shown in Figure 13, in order 
to achieve better than -20dBc side lobes, the element 
separation is 98mm or smaller. Since the 2-D phased array 
antenna can emit narrow beams in E-plane and H-plane, the 
gain at the element separation of around 98mm exceeds 10dBi 
as shown in Figure 14. From these optimization results, the 
element separation is set at 98mm. The resulting beam-forming 
antenna is shown in Figure 15. The substrate permittivity is 
4.12 which is same in Figure 2 and 7. The antenna elements are 
separated by 98mm (λ/3.38). When compared to the traditional 
λ/2 separation, this structure reduces the antenna size by 41

four plots are enough to show overall reflection performance. 
All reflection values are less than -10dB from 920MHz to 
928MHz. The antenna gain exceeds 13dBi and side lobes are at 
most -20dBc as shown in Figure 17. A matching prototype was

Fig.19. Measured directivity 
(16-element 2-D beam-forming antenna) 
 
and measured directivity is shown in Figure 19. Measured 
reflection values are better than -10dB from 920MHz to 
928MHz. In the measurement reflection, the resonance point 
is out of measurement range. Since this difference is comes 
from substrate permittivity error, the difference can be 
canceled. The measured peak gain is 8.59 dBi, smaller than 
the simulation value, and the measured side lobe level is -
22.3dBc 
IV. CONCLUSION 
This paper has proposed the low side lobe beam-forming 
antenna composed of narrowly-spaced patch antenna arrays. 
To validate the proposed antenna, 1-D and 2-D beam-forming 
antennas composed of patch antenna arrays were simulated and 
designed, and prototypes were measured The simulation results 
show that both antennas have, small (65 percent size reduction) 
and low side lobe level (better than -20dBc), and high gain 
(more than 10dBi).  Measured results show close agreement 
with the simulation results and the 2-D beam-forming antenna 
achieved side lobe levels better than -20dBc. Thus, the 
proposed beam-forming antenna is a good candidate for base 
station antennas of wide area sensor networks.
