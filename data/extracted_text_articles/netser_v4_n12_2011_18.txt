Abstract—An adequate wireless network plan is needed to 
replace the traditional wired LANs. A full coverage WLAN 
offers the flexibility to relocate people and equipment or to 
reconfigure and add more wireless devices to the network. 
Usually, an IEEE 802.11 variant is chosen based on their 
bandwidth and their coverage area. However, sometimes there 
are special cases where the best technology is not the newest 
one. In addition, suitable positioning of access points (AP) is 
crucial to determine the efficiency of the network. E.g. in the 
case where devices are going to transmit at a maximum of 1 
Mbps, any choice is acceptable, but when it is required higher 
performance, other factors must be considered. In this paper, 
we compare IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n indoor environments to know 
what technology is better. This comparison will be taken in 
terms of RSSI, coverage area, and measuring the interferences 
between channels. These key factors must be optimum to have 
high performance in the WLAN. This study will help the 
researchers to choose the best technology depending of their 
deploying case, and we will see study the best variant for 
indoors.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extended version of the paper presented 
by S. Sendra et al. in [1]. 
One of the major issues in Wireless Local Area Network 
(WLAN) indoor environments is the multipath dispersion 
due to the influence of many signal reflectors and diffusions. 
Walls, floors and roofs attenuate the signal highly and 
provoke great variations in the mean received power. Even 
the furniture and the metallic structures of the walls and 
roofs have high impact because they enhance the scattering 
and diffraction. There has been many studies about the signal 
propagation in indoors [2][3]. Moreover, there are special 
challenges when designing WLANs in indoors [4]. 
Because the emitter and the receiver are close, the delay 
between echoes will enlarge the delay spread. But, temporal 
variations are slower because of the low mobility of the 
users. Temporal variations are mainly given by the presence 
of humans close to the antennas. Moreover, there are other 
features in indoor environments such as: 
• Electromagnetic fields provided by electronic devices. 
Although the reflection and diffraction can be modeled, 
there are many things inside the building that introduce a 
certain grade of variability [3]. 
• Usually people walking in any corridor or facility close to 
the emitter or the receiver will cause significant variations 
[5].   
• Because the distances are short, any variation of the 
direction of the antenna will imply high changes in the 
signal received. 
• Metallic objects reflect the radio signal. The signal will not 
cross metallic walls and metallic objects will fade. 
• Wood, crystal, plastic and bricks reflect part of the signal, 
but let pass the rest. 
• The objects with high humidity have more signal 
absorption. 
There are several indoor propagation models. They can be 
classified in empirical models (which are based on the 
measures taken and predict the signal loss), in deterministic 
models (that simulate the signal propagation in order to 
characterize the transmission channel), theoretical models, 
(which are based in the physical laws of the modeled 
medium) and stochastic models (they are modes which 
results have a probability distribution) [6]. The appropriate 
model must be chosen based in the design necessities. 
Empirical models are used in network design, while 
deterministic models are used for high precision 
applications. The first ones are less complex and need 
lower input parameters, but they do not predict 
instantaneous signal fainting [7].  
The most well known models are the following ones: 
• Log-Normal Shadowing Path Loss Model [8] 
• Loss Model based in COST 231 [9] 
• Linear Path Attenuation Model [10] 
• Keenan-Motley Model [11] 
• ITU-R Model [12] 
• Dual Slope-Model [13] 
• Multi-Wall Model [14] 
Several authors have studied empirically each one of 
them providing their drawbacks and benefits. 
But, when we are setting up a WLAN, it is not practical 
to model all wireless coverage area for each site where the 
access point is going to be placed, especially when we are 
talking about large extension areas [15]. Within the IEEE 
802.11 standard [16], there are included several variants like 
IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g and IEEE 
802.11n. All of them provide different coverage areas, and 
even different signal strength inside the coverage area. 
The standard uses the CSMA/CA protocol as the medium 
access method. It is a carrier sense multiple access with 
collision avoidance used to avoid collisions between wireless 
data packets. In Europe, the frequency ranges from 2.401 to 
2.483 GHz is divided into 13 channels of 22 MHz wide, and 
spaced 5 MHz between them, where channel 1 is centered on 
2.412 GHz and the channel 13 is located at 2.472 GHz.

Japan adds an additional channel 14, located 12 MHz above 
channel 13. In an IEEE 802.11 network, the participant 
significantly reduces the speed of the overall wireless 
network. Now we are going to introduce each IEEE 802.11 
variant [17, 18]. 
A. IEEE 802.11a 
IEEE 802.11a was approved in 1999. Although it was 
born in 1999, it did not begin to be marketed until 2001. This 
variant works in the 5 GHz band. Its architecture is based on 
two types of devices: the Access Points (APs), which are the 
base station for the wireless network, and the wireless 
clients, that can be mobile devices such as laptops, PDAs, 
and fixed devices such as desktops and workstations 
equipped with a wireless network interface. 
IEEE 802.11a uses OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing) modulation with 52 subcarriers. This 
standard has a theoretical maximum speed of 54 Mbps, but 
the transmission rate decreases when the signal quality 
decreases. 54 Mbps could be changed to 48, 36, 24, 12, 9 and 
6 Mbps. There are 52 subcarriers, 48 of them are used for the 
data transmission and 4 for pilot tasks, with a separation of 
312.5 KHz. Each subcarrier may be modulated by BPSK 
(Binary Phase Shift Keying), QPSK (Quaternary Phase Shift 
Keying), 16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) or 
64-QAM. 
IEEE 802.11a provides 12 non-overlapping channels. As 
it uses the 5 GHz band, the signal has less interference than 
the other standards IEEE 802.11. But the equipment must be 
in the line of sight (LOS) to gain a better efficiency in 
communications.  
B. IEEE 802.11b 
The 802.11b standard was approved in 1999. IEEE 
802.11b data are encoded using the Direct Sequence Spread 
Spectrum Signal (DSSS). This technology uses CCK 
(Complementary Code Keying) and QPSK modulation to 
achieve a maximum transfer raw rate of 11 Mbps. However, 
it cannot exceed 6 Mbps with TCP (Transmission Control 
Protocol) and 7 Mbps with UDP (User Datagram Protocol) 
theoretically. 
The protocol can be used in point-to-multipoint or point-
to-point topology with links over distances proportional to 
the features of the antennas and output power. Furthermore, 
if there is any problem with the signal quality, it is possible 
to transmit in 5.5, 2 or 1 Mbps, using redundant methods of 
data encryption. 
First devices appeared very quickly because this variant 
was an extension to the DSSS modulation of the original 
standard. The higher speed and the low cost of the devices 
achieved a fast growth of this technology in the market. 
C. IEEE 802.11g 
IEEE 802.11g appeared in 2003. It is an evolution of 
IEEE 802.11b. It works on 2.4 GHz frequency band and it is 
compatible with IEEE 802.11b. Its theoretical transfer is 54 
Mbps, although it is reduced to 22 Mbps when the receiver is 
some meters far from the AP in a real scenario. It uses 52 
subcarriers. 
The modulation scheme used in 802.11g is orthogonal 
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), such as in 
802.11a, with data rates of 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 
Mbps. It reverts to CCK (like the 802.11b standard) for 5.5 
and 11 Mbps and to DBPSK and DQPSK + DSSS for 1 and 
2 Mbps respectively. In this standard, there is also a speed 
decrease according to the signal quality. 
 IEEE 802.11g suffers from the same interference as 
IEEE 802.11b in the already crowded 2.4 GHz range.  
Because IEEE 802.11g uses the same radio signaling 
(CCK) as 802.11b, at the lower four IEEE 802.11g data 
rates, it is fully backward compatible with IEEE 802.11b. 
This enables IEEE 802.11b/g wireless networks to continue 
supporting only IEEE 802.11b enabled devices. IEEE 
802.11g may seem to be the competence of 802.11a, but 
most products include both technologies because they are 
complementary. 
D. IEEE 802.11n 
While IEEE 802.11a/b/g WLANs provide adequate 
performance for today's networking applications, the 
wireless applications of next generation require higher data 
throughput and bigger coverage area. This variant sought to 
bring the transmission capacity of wireless data transmission 
at speeds of wired systems. 
IEEE 802.11n is a proposed amendment to the IEEE 
802.11-2007 standard [16] in order to significantly improve 
the network performance of the previous standards such as 
802.11b and 802.11g. IEEE 802.11n is built based on 
previous standards of the 802.11 family, adding Multiple-
Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and binding of network 
interfaces (Channel Bonding). It also adds frames to the 
MAC layer. 
It presents an increase of the theoretical maximum rate of 
600 Mbps of data transfer. Currently it supports a PHY rate 
of 450 Mbps, using 3 spatial streams in a channel width of 
40 MHz. Furthermore, IEEE 802.11n uses MIMO based on 
using multiple transmit and receive antennas to improve 
system performance. This technology requires a separated 
radio-frequency chain and an analog to digital converter for 
each MIMO antenna which increases the implementation 
costs compared to the systems without MIMO technology. 
 Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the four 
variants of the IEEE 802.11 standard. 
The success of the standard has caused density problems 
related to crowding in urban areas. So, some issues must be 
studied such as interference, coverage and used bandwidth in 
each IEEE 802.11 variant. In our previous work, presented in 
a conference [1], we carried out coverage measurements of 
several devices that were capable to work in different IEEE 
802.11 variants. In addition, the number of lost packets, 
bandwidth and throughput when there are interferences, for 
each IEEE 802.11 variant were measured. In this paper, we 
have added, on the one hand, some coverage measures that 
were not performed in the previous work and, on the other 
hand, we have taken more measurements of lost packets, 
bandwidth and throughput for each IEEE 802.11 variant. The 
results will be the mean values for each variant.

In this paper, we are going to show the empirical 
coverage area and the signal strength inside the coverage 
area. This let us know which is the technology that provides 
better coverage features, but, in this case (compared with 
reference [1], we will take more measures in order to extract 
more reliable conclusions. Moreover, we are going to 
compare the interferences between neighboring channels for 
each technology in order to know the number of available 
channels that can be used to plan the wireless network.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II shows the related work on WLAN coverage 
designs. This section is separated in two parts. The first part 
shows indoor coverage studies and the second part shows 
papers related with performance measurements such as 
interferences, bandwidth and throughput. The test bench 
where our measurements have been performed is shown in 
Section III. Section IV presents the coverage measurements 
performed and the graphs obtained for each device, working 
in different IEEE 802.11 variant. Section V shows the 
measurements of the interferences between channels for each 
variant. It shows the graphs of lost packets, bandwidth and 
throughput when there are interferences. Finally, Section VI 
concludes the paper and gives our future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
In the literature, there are some works related with 
performance test and interference calculations. However, 
very few people have worked with physical devices to obtain 
real values. 
A. Related works of indoor coverage.  
There have been many studies of indoor coverage for 
single-transmitter and single-receiver protocols, like IEEE 
802.11a, IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g [6]. Others use 
the measurements obtained from the signal level of a group 
of access points to perform the channel planning while 
avoiding interference [15]. There are some that locate clients 
by using the signal strength received by several access points 
[5]. IEEE 802.11 infrastructure has the advantage of being 
available in numerous indoor environments, and is deployed 
in densities that allow for the possibility of positioning with 
meter level accuracy.  
As IEEE 802.11 networks are widely deployed, there has 
been a significant amount of work about planning IEEE 
802.11n wireless networks. In such networks, the use of 
Multiple-Input 
Multiple-Output 
(MIMO) 
transmission 
scheme changes the expected behavior of signal level due to 
its multiple antenna use, exploiting physical phenomena such 
as multipath propagation to increase the transmission rate 
and reduce the error rate. 
Foschini [19] derives theoretically that for the same SNR 
a 2x2 MIMO channel can hold twice the amount of 
bandwidth than using a single transmission and receiving 
antenna. As shown in [20] even further gain can be expected 
by the use of larger arrays of antennas in both reception and 
transmission. 
Most of the recently published papers have modeled the 
MIMO channel matrix with independent and identically 
distributed Gaussian entries, which is an idealistic 
assumption, especially for indoor scenarios. More realistic 
MIMO channel models can be generally divided into three 
classes: ray-tracing, scattering and correlation models [21]. 
Anyway, for indoors need very large simulation time and 
complexity for trying to provide a good prediction of the 
channel behavior. On the other hand, correlation-based 
models don’t provide detailed information about coverage, 
which could be needed for applications like indoor 
positioning [22].  
There are still a few indoor IEEE 802.11n channel 
measurements reported in the literature. Simulation methods 
of these channels based on direct measurements are even 
fewer. At the 5 GHz band, for example, the publicly 
available IEEE TGn models [23] are the most convenient 
tools for MIMO channel simulations. However they have 
their own limitations; e.g., they are based on single-input 
single-output (SISO) channel models presented in [20] which 
do not reflect accurately the multipath propagation channel.  
Another work that studies the coverage is presented by E. 
Amaldi et al. in [24]. This paper describes the optimization 
models with hyperbolic and quadratic objective functions. 
The authors propose heuristic methods that combine greedy 
and local search phases, and show the need of appropriate 
planning models and procedures that are specific to WLANs. 
The authors suppose that the system affects to the coverage 
planning process, and the incidence of overlapping regions 
should be taken into account in the planning procedure 
(beside of all the other optimization parameters). The 
computational results show that their heuristics provide near-
optimal solutions within a reasonable amount of time. 
Finally, in [25], J. N. Davies et al. measure the IEEE 
802.11n signal level in a real building, but they don’t make 
any comparison with IEEE 802.11a or IEEE 802.11g.

B. Related works of interferences. 
From the IEEE 802.11 WLAN interference side, 
Nicolescu [26] proposed a model for interference in dense 
wireless networks that enables a low complexity procedure 
to collect the interference map and can be used to predict the 
damage from several simultaneous interferers. Unfortunately 
measurement of the interference map faces asymmetries in 
the card and channel behavior, which make the complexity 
still prohibitive for dense multiple card networks, requiring 
direct measurements in indoor deployments. Also, Fuxjäger 
et al. [27] show that the assumption of perfect independence 
between non-overlapping channels does not always hold in 
practice, by means of simple experiments with commercially 
available hardware, and found that the level of interference 
varies 
with 
physical 
distance, 
concurrent 
link-load, 
modulation rate, frame size, transmission power, receiver 
sensitivity and design, antenna patterns, etc., calling also for 
more direct measurements.  
J. Padhye et al. present in [28] an interference 
measurement-based study between links in a static, IEEE 
802.11, multi-hop wireless network. Then, the authors 
propose a simple empirical estimation methodology that can 
predict pair wise interference using only measurements. 
These tests are based on heuristics methods where the 
wireless links are defined by their packet loss rate. They state 
that this methodology could be applicable to any wireless 
network that uses omni-directional antennas. 
Related to interference and throughput measures in 
WLAN,  J. Jun et al. present in [29] an accurate formula to 
estimate the throughput in IEEE 802.11 networks, for several 
variants (802.11, 802.11b, 802.11a), in the absence of 
transmission errors and for various physical layers, data rates 
and packet sizes. The authors cite some applications where it 
is very important to know the maximum throughput in order 
to design them correctly. Theoretical Maximum Throughput 
can be used to facilitate optimal network provisioning, for 
example, in multimedia applications. It can influence the 
topological distribution of the nodes in the case of ad-hoc 
networks. 
Although analytical studies and network simulations may 
provide valuable insights of the WLANs' operation, they 
cannot predict the actual performance of practical 
implementations 
with 
high 
accuracy. 
Moreover, 
measurements obtained from file transfer operations are also 
limited by the need to specify the processor type, processor 
speed and the network operating system. B. Bing presents in 
[30], an experimental study to characterize the behavior in 
terms of throughput and response time of two commercial 
AP under different degrees of network load. They are 
WavePOINT, from Lucent Technologies, and Spectrum24, 
from Symbol Technologies. The tests showed important 
characteristics such as throughput and response time under 
various network loads. The author also shows that the length 
of a data frame and the wireless bit rate also affects to the 
WLAN’s transmission capabilities. But, the performance of 
an IEEE 802.11 WLAN is generally unaffected by the type 
of frame and the use of reservation frames such as RTS and 
CTS. 
III. 
THE SCENARIO DESCRIPTION 
In this section, we describe the scenario where the 
measures have been taken and the hardware and software 
used to perform our research. 
A. Place of measurement 
In order to do the measures, we have sought a wide 
enclosure with an area of 91 m2, with a length and a width of 
12.5 m by 6.68 m. This building is made with walls of 
different thickness and materials. We have tried to find a 
scenario that was made from different materials, as can be 
found in common houses. 
Fig. 1 shows the plane of garage. It has rectangular base, 
divided into two parts by a wall of 9 cm of thick: the garage 
(left) and the kitchen (right). The enclosure of the staircase is 
made of bricks with high consistency. All these walls have a 
layer of plaster and paint on both sides. The bathroom is 
made with hollow bricks of 9 cm. These walls are covered 
by ceramic tiles. All external walls are double with a thermic 
and acoustic insulation of polystyrene. Fig. 1 also shows the 
APs placement. In red we can see AP, which has been used 
for the coverage measurements test bench. In green we can 
see AP1 and AP2, which have been used for the interference 
test bench. Their placements have been decided randomly in 
order to avoid having equidistant placements. 
B. Hardware used in the test bench 
Four APs of different brands and models have been used.  
All of them are capable to working in different wireless 
technologies of IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n (depending on the 
model). The models used are described below: 
• Linksys WRT320N: It is a small device that is able to work 
in IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n standard variants. It works at 
frequencies of 2.4 GHz and 5GHz. It has three internal 
antennas, needed to work in IEEE 802.11n. Its RF power 
(EIRP) is 17 dBm. 
• Dlink DWL-2000AP+: It works on IEEE 802.11g. It can 
be configured to work as a wireless AP, as a point to point 
bridge with another access point, as a wireless bridge point 
to multi-point or as a wireless client configured. Its output 
power is 16 dBm. 
• Cisco Aironet 1130AG: It has been built to provide 
wireless coverage in offices and workplaces for their 
services. It is designed to be hung on the wall in a vertical 
position and it can works in IEEE 802.11a/g but it is also 
compatible with 802.11 b. It output power in IEEE 802.11a 
is 17 dBm, and its output power in IEEE 802.11g is 20 
dBm. 
• Linksys WRT54GL: This device is capable of working in 
the variants IEEE 802.11b/g, therefore, is only capable of 
emitting at a frequency of 2.4 GHz. It has 2 external 
antennas, which are used to correct the multipath effect. 
His RF power (EIRP) is approximately 18 dBm. 
• Linksys WUSB600N: This is a wireless USB interface 
device that has been used as the capture device for all 
Laptops and PCs used in the test bench. This wireless card 
is able to capture IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n signals. It has a 
transmitting power of 16 dBm in all variants and its 
receiver sensitivity is approximately -91 dBm.

Figure 1.  Scenario and APs situation. 
 
In order to take the coverage measurements, we have 
used a laptop with dual core processor at 1.67 GHz per core 
and 1 GByte of RAM. In addition, two desktop PCs with an 
AMD 1700MHz CPU and 1 GByte of RAM memory have 
been used to take the interference measurements. 
C. Software used 
This subsection describes the software used to perform 
our test bench. 
• 
InSSIDer is a freeware that can detect wireless networks 
and manage, in a graphics mode, the intensity of these 
signals. This program let us detect all wireless networks 
in the test area on the computer screen and lists all of 
their details: SSID, MAC address, channel, Radio Signal 
Strength Indicator (RSSI), type of network, security, 
speed and signal intensity and allows monitoring the 
signal quality via a chart using the received RSSI [31]. 
• 
MS-DOS commands. The MS-DOS shell presents some 
utilities and commands, which allow checking the status 
of the network connection. 
• 
Net Meter monitors the network traffic used by all 
network interfaces [32]. It displays in real-time 
graphical and numerical downloading and uploading 
bandwidth rates.  
IV. 
COVERAGE MEASUREMENTS 
This section describes the strategies carried out to do the 
coverage measurements and the measures obtained. 
A. Process to gather the coverage measurements 
First we measured the wireless coverage offered by each 
device, working on various wireless technologies. These 
signal values depend mainly, on the losses suffered due to 
the walls traversed and the multipath effect. 
In order to perform this work, we draw a grid in the 
garage floor. It allowed us to take measurements of all 
devices in the same place. The position of the measure points 
is seen in Fig. 1. The equidistant points shown in the figure 
are separated 1m from each other.  
Each access point has been located in the stairwell 
(marked in red on Fig. 1), at a height of 50 cm of the floor. 
The signal power levels received at each measure point is 
collected by a laptop running the application software 
InSSIDer. The used capture device was a WUSB600N 
wireless card for all computers in order to avoid adding some 
sort of error taking the measurements. The laptop was 
located at a height of 50 cm above the ground. 
B. Results of coverage measures 
In Fig. 2, we can see the legend used for all coverage 
graphics. All values shown are measured in dBm, with an 
absolute error of 1dBm. 
Fig. 3 shows the level of coverage obtained with Linksys 
WRT320N when it is configured to work only in 802.11a. 
As the figure shows, the best coverage is located in the 
stairwell. The signal is propagated out of the walls of the 
stairwell to the outer walls. Then, there signal strength is 
quickly decreased with some low peaks in the coverage area. 
Fig. 4 shows the coverage obtained with the Cisco 
Aironet 1130AG when it is configured to work only in 
802.11 a. This device presents the lowest signal level. This 
may be due to the antenna radiation direction (we place all 
the devices in the same position, independently of the 
placement of the antenna inside of them). 
Fig. 5 shows the level of coverage obtained with Linksys 
WRT320N configured to work only in 802.11b. In this case, 
the best coverage is located in the staircase, but the signal is 
decreased quickly as it is propagated to the garage. The 
kitchen area has a lower signal level than the garage. 
Fig. 6 shows the level of coverage obtained with the

Fig. 7 shows the level of coverage obtained with the 
Linksys WRT320N configured to work only in 802.11n. 
Although there is high signal strength close to the access 
point, there are suddenly low values in the coverage area. 
Fig. 8 shows the level of coverage obtained with the 
Dlink DWL-2000AP configured to work only in 802.11 g. 
This device presents the highest signal levels in almost all 
the garage surface, and the kitchen’s area. 
Fig. 9 shows the level of coverage obtained with the 
Cisco Aironet 1130AG configured to work only in 802.11 g. 
This device is the one that presents the lowest signal level. 
This may be due to the antenna radiation direction (we place 
all the devices in the same position, independently of the 
placement of the antenna inside of them). 
Fig. 10 shows the level of coverage obtained for the 
Linksys WRT320N configured to work only in 802.11g. As 
we can see, when it is working in IEEE 802.11b, its coverage 
is better than in IEEE 802.11g . It is even more significant in 
closest distances. 
Fig. 11 shows the coverage obtained with the Linksys 
WRT54GL when it is configured to work only in 802.11g. It 
has been one of devices that provides the lowest higher 
signal strength in the coverage area.

INTERFERENCE MEASUREMENTS 
This section describes the process used to make the 
interference measurements. It also shows the topology of 
PCs and APs. 
A. Scenario 
In this test, we have used four PCs and two APs of the 
same brand and model. Fig.1 shows the location of AP1 and 
AP2 (marked in green). These sites are chosen to ensure that 
there are walls between the two small wireless networks. 
First, we used channel 6 for both wireless devices. Then, 
we configured different IP networks in order to perform our 
test. Now we are able to measure the effects of the 
interference generated by another network working in the 
same channel. In order to take the measurements, we 
changed the working channel in one device while the other 
remained fixed. The measurements were taken for each 
channel until there was a difference of 5 channels. With the 
collected data, the average value of lost packets, throughput 
and bandwidth was estimated. This let us know the behavior 
of each variant based on the number of overlapping 
channels. 
Fig. 12 shows the topologies. The PCs are situated at a 
distance of approximately 1 m from the AP which is 
associated to. A large file is transmitted between the 
computers associated to the AP2. Meanwhile, measurements 
of the packet loss, throughput and bandwidth consumed are 
carried out in the Wireless Network of the AP1. 
 
Figure 12.  Network topology. 
In order to present our results, we have grouped the 
collected data of the variants IEEE 802.11 b/g/n (all of them 
work at 2.4 GHz) in the same figures, because the 
distribution channels were the same, while IEEE 802.11a, 
which works at 5GHz, was displayed in separate figures. 
The measures were made with all devices under test, 
working on different variants. Later, we computed the 
average value of lost packets, throughput and bandwidth. 
B. Lost Packets 
Based on the physical properties of radio-frequency 
signals, when we have two frequency components, 
represented in the same spectral domain, the interference 
should be low (which results in fewer lost packets), because 
overlapping spectra is lower. But, in the following 
simulations we have found that the measurements do not 
always follow this behavior. 
In order to know the lost packets, a ping is transmitted 
between the PCs associated to AP1. We fixed the maximum 
time to 1000 milliseconds. After this time, the packet will be 
considered lost. We choose a small time, because it is a small 
network, without a large number of intermediate devices that 
may introduce delays. Measurements were taken during 3 
minutes in each the devices.

The obtained results as a function of the amount of 
channel separation are shown in the following figures. 
 Figure 13 shows the number of lost packets for IEEE 
802.11 b/g/n, when both devices are working on the same 
channel. As we can see b variant has higher number of lost 
packets (around 44%) than g variant, while devices working 
in IEEE 802.11n do not have lost packets. 
Figure 14 shows the number of lost packets for IEEE 
802.11 b/g/n, where there is one channel between them. In 
this case, b variant records around 55% of lost packets and g 
variant has lost 42%. IEEE 802.11n does not have lost 
packets. 
Fig. 15 shows the number of lost packets for IEEE 
802.11 b/g/n, where there are two channels of separation. 
The number of lost packets, when the devices operate in 
IEEE 802.11b/g variants, was between 42 and 46%. In this 
case, IEEE 802.11n variant has 1% of lost packets. 
Fig. 16 shows the number of lost packets for IEEE 
802.11 b/g/n, when there are three channels of separation. 
The number of lost packets for IEEE 802.11b/g was between 
40 and 44% and the IEEE 802.11n variant does not have lost 
packets. 
Figure 17 shows the number of lost packets for IEEE 
802.11 b/g/n, when there are four separation channels. As we 
can see the IEEE 802.11b variant has a higher number of lost 
packets (around 42%) than the IEEE 802.11g variant (around 
37%). While IEEE 802.11n, does not have lost packets. 
Figure 18 shows the number of lost packet for IEEE 
802.11 b/g/n, when there are five separation channels. The 
number of lost packets for IEEE 802.11b/g was between 38 
and 42%, and IEEE 802.11n didn't report lost packets.

The measurements show that devices operating under the 
IEEE 802.11n variant does not have lost packets, while the 
IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g variants could have 40% of 
lost packets (depending on the amount of separation 
channels). This is mainly because IEEE 802.11n uses MIMO 
technology, where both transmitter and receiver have 
multiple antennas reducing the interferences. Generally, in 
traditional wireless transmission the signal is affected by 
reflections, causing self-degradation and therefore data loss. 
MIMO takes advantage of physical phenomena such as 
multipath propagation to increase the transmission rate and 
reduce the error rate. That is, MIMO increases the spectral 
efficiency of wireless communication system through the use 
of the space domain. 
In IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g variants there is a 
slight tendency to record fewer lost packets when the 
channel separation is an even number than when there is an 
odd channel of separation. These losses can be approximated 
in both cases by a fifth degree polynomial with high 
accuracy. In particular, taking the measurements gathered, 
IEEE 802.11b follows expression 1:

ݕ ൌ  0.35ݔହ െ 4.95ݔସ ൅ 25.96ݔଷ െ 59.43ݔଶ ൅ 0.31ݔ൅43.5 ሺ2ሻ  
 
Where x is the separation between working channels and 
y represents the value in % of lost packets. 
In order to test the performance of IEEE 802.11a variant 
we used two different devices. The first one was Cisco 
Aironet 1130AG working in IEEE 802.11a, which uses 
dynamic frequency selection (DFS). This system does not 
allow us to select different channels (such as we did in IEEE 
802.11 b/g/n). The other device was the WRT320N working 
in IEEE 802.11a, which only works in the channels 36, 40, 
44, 48. Although in the 5GHz frequency band, devices could 
work theoretically with 8 non-overlapping channels 
simultaneously, this device only allows us to work with 4 
non-overlapping channels. Then, we estimated the average 
bandwidth for each device when there are no overlapping 
channels. The results are represented in fig. 19. 
As fig19 shows, WRT320N working in IEEE 802.11a 
presents five times less packet loss than the Cisco Aironet 
1130AG device (which has around 40%). 
C. Throughput and Bandwidth consumption measurements  
In order to measure the bandwidth offered by each 
technology, we performed the following test. First, 2 PCs 
were associated to the AP2 and were transmitting large files 
consuming all the bandwidth available in this network. Then, 
there were 2 PCs associated to the AP1, which were 
transmitting a large file too. The Net Meter captured the 
consumed bandwidth in one of these PCs. The measures are 
carried out during 3 minutes.  
The result of the average bandwidth consumed by each 
IEEE 802.11 variant for different the number of separation 
channels is shown in the following figures.  
 
Figure 19.  Lost packets with non overlapping channel 
This average has been estimated taking into account the 
measurements taken from all devices for each variant. 
Fig. 20 shows the bandwidth consumed for IEEE 
802.11b/g/n, when both devices are working in the same 
channel. As we can see, IEEE 802.11b variant has 
approximately an average of 3Mbps, while IEEE 802.11g 
and n variants, provide around 10-12 Mbps. 
Fig. 21 shows the bandwidth for IEEE 802.11b/g/n, when 
there is one separation channel. In this case, the IEEE 
802.11b variant shows a mean bandwidth of 2Mbps and 
IEEE 802.11g and n variants provide approximately 
11Mbps. 
Fig. 22 shows the bandwidth for IEEE 802.11b/g/n, when 
there are two separation channels. The average bandwidth 
values for IEEE 802.11g and n are between 10-11Mbps. 
Furthermore, IEEE 802.11b is using an average bandwidth 
of 2.5Mbps. 
Fig. 23 shows the bandwidth for IEEE 802.11b/g/n, when 
there are three separation channels. In this case, IEEE 
802.11g variant has higher bandwidth (11Mbps) than the 
IEEE 802.11n variant (10Mbps). IEEE 802.11b variant has 
an average value of 3Mbps. 
Fig. 24 shows the bandwidth for IEEE 802.11b/g/n, when 
there are four separation channels. We can see that IEEE 
802.11b variant has an average value of 3 Mbps, while IEEE 
802.11g variant has 10.5 Mbps and IEEE 802.11n variant 
has 12 Mbps.  
Fig. 25 shows the bandwidth for IEEE 802.11b/g/n, when 
there are five separation channels. The IEEE 802.11b variant 
maintains its average value around 3 Mbps, while IEEE 
802.11g/n variants have their average values very close to 
10Mbps. 
As it happens in lost packets measurements, there is a 
trend in the bandwidth consumption that is related to the 
separation of the working channels. On the one hand, 
IEEE802.11n and b variants, present higher mean values 
when the separation between the working channels is even, 
while IEEE802.11g variant, has its maximum values when 
the number of separation channels is odd. 
Fig. 26 shows the bandwidth for IEEE 802.11a variant 
when channels are not overlapped. As we can see, both 
devices show a similar average bandwidth, with an average 
value of 11.4 Mbps.

Finally, in order to see the use of the link capabilities for 
each IEEE 802.11 variant, we have measured the average 
throughput. These values have been obtained by dividing the 
average 
bandwidth 
consumption 
by 
the 
theoretical 
bandwidth of the IEEE 802.11 variant. It provides us the 
percentage of throughput consumption for each variant. For 
the IEEE 802.11n variant, we have used 320 Mbps as a 
reference to compute the percentage, because the used 
devices were limited to this speed. The results of the 
throughput average, as a function of the distance between 
channels, are shown in the following figures: 
Fig. 27 shows the throughput average of IEEE 
802.11b/g/n, when both devices are working in the same 
channel. IEEE 802.11b variant has an average throughput of 
27%, meanwhile IEEE 802.11g variant maintains its average 
value around 18% and IEEE 802.11n variant has an average 
value of 4%. 
Fig. 28 shows the average throughput of IEEE 
802.11b/g/n variants, when there is a separation of one 
channel. In this case, IEEE 802.11b/g variants show values 
around 20% and IEEE 802.11n maintains its average value 
in 4%. 
Fig. 29 shows the average throughput of IEEE 
802.11b/g/n variants, when there are two separation 
channels. Again, IEEE 802.11n variant shows the lowest 
value, while IEEE 802.11g has its average value around 18% 
and the IEEE 802.11b version presents an average 
throughput of 22%. 
Fig. 30 shows the average throughput of IEEE 
802.11b/g/n, when there are three separation channels. In this 
case, IEEE 802.11b and g have increased their average 
values, locating them between 21% and 24%, but IEEE 
802.11n has an average throughput of 4%.  
Fig. 31 shows the average throughput of IEEE 
802.11b/g/n, when there are four separation channels. The 
IEEE 802.11b variant has a throughput around 24.5% and 
IEEE 802.11g variant presents an average value of 19%. 
IEEE 802.11n variant maintains its value. 
Fig. 32 shows the average throughput of IEEE 
802.11b/g/n, when there are five separation channels. In this 
case, all values have decreased slightly. They have 22.5% for 
IEEE 802.11b, 17% for IEEE 802.11g and 3% for EEE 
802.11n.

Figure 33.  Average throughput with non overlapping channels 
In general, we can see similar effects in all figures. The 
IEEE 802.11 variant that has lower average throughput is 
IEEE 802.11n, which in no case exceeds 5%. In IEEE 
802.11g, the average throughput values is around 20%, while 
the variant that best uses its available bandwidth is IEEE 
802.11b, which has average values very close to 25% of its 
total capacity. 
For IEEE 802.11a variant, the average throughput 
measures are shown in fig. 33. Both devices have a similar 
average throughput (approximately 21%). 
In this case it is clear that the interference highly affects 
the performance of the wireless network variant. IEEE 
802.11a, IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g have higher 
throughput than IEEE 802.11n, (which average values are 
between 21% and 25%). 
VI. 
MEASUREMENT DISCUSSION 
Throughout this work we have performed different test 
benches in order to characterize the behavior of wireless 
signals in indoor environments. These tests have allowed us 
to check some statements realized by some papers related to 
this issue. We have also seen some other issues. 
Moreover, we analyzed the frequency spectrum between 
2.4 and 2.5 GHz, which includes all channels used in IEEE 
802.11 b/g/n. Because of their physical properties, we could 
think that if there is no overlap between channels, there 
should not be any interference between them. But our results 
did not reflect this fact. In [27], authors show in their 
simulation that non-overlapping channels do not have 
interference. In fact, their tests were different from ours. 
They analyzed these losses depending on the distance 
between nodes. Despite of this fact, the conclusions are 
similar. As we have seen, the devices working at 2.4 GHz 
register fewer lost packets due to interference, when the 
channels are fully overlapping (Fig. 27), than when there is 
one channel of separation between the devices (Fig. 28). We 
also see that the number of lost packets, maintaining 
approximately the same value when there are 3 channels of 
separation (Fig. 30), when there are 4 (Fig. 31) or 5 channels 
(fig.35). In the last two cases, the number of lost packets 
should be very low or zero, since the overlap between the 
spectral is virtually nonexistent. In this case, after having 
performed different tests, we state that there is a slight 
tendency to register fewer lost packets when the channel 
separation is an even number than when the channel 
separation is an odd number. These measurements enabled 
us to characterize this behavior to a fifth degree polynomial 
with a correlation value close to the unity. 
Moreover, we can extrapolate the analysis about the 
number of lost packets to the bandwidth measurements, 
where the behavior is identical. That is, when the channel 
separation is an even number, there is a greater bandwidth 
than when the channel separation is an odd number. This fact 
corresponds to the values of lowest packet losses. Therefore, 
although we have shown that non-overlapping channels does 
not mean less interference level, the analysis shows that a 
greater number of lost packets corresponds to a lower useful 
bandwidth in the network. 
Some published papers define the throughput, as the 
volume of information that traverses the network over time. 
And others define the throughput as the channel 
performance. We have taken the second meaning of this 
concept. It relates the amount of information flowing through 
the channel and the theoretical maximum capacity offered by 
technology. Another factor that draws the attention of this 
analysis is that despite of the packet losses registered in 
IEEE 802.11n is low; the value of throughput and channel 
performance is quite low. As we can see in [33] the 
theoretical maximum throughput and data rates for IEEE 
802.11 networks in a and b variants are different compared 
with real throughput and data rates.

Figure 35.  Integrated circuits for WRT320N 
Although this phenomenon has been seen in the 4 
variants measured, the n variant is the one that has the 
biggest difference among its theoretical value and real value. 
In order to analyze this, first we have analyzed the hardware 
characteristics of wireless device. In this case, WRT320N 
has 3 antennas, as shown in Fig. 34, and it should use the 3 
antennas in order to work in IEEE 802.11n with MIMO. 
However, as we can see in Fig. 35, only two out of three 
antennas are controlled by the SE2547A circuit. It allows a 
dual stream for both antennas. A review of this device is 
shown in a specific forum of wireless technology [34]. There 
are also other cases where the devices only work with 2 
antennas, enabling a maximum effective flow rate of 315 
Mbps compared to the 600 Mbps specified in the standard. In 
addition, the theoretical maximum data rate specified in the 
WRT320N datasheet is 320Mbps. 
Moreover, the USB device used as a receiving interface 
is WUSB600N. It has 2 internal antennas and when it works 
in IEEE 802.11n, MIMO is also used. The network 
performance operating under IEEE 802.11n standard should 
be better than the other analyzed standards because the 
technology used (that is MIMO) allows it. Therefore, the 
most probable cause of the discrepancy between the number 
of lost packets and the information flowing through the 
channels is due to the hardware characteristics and the low 
performance of one of the two devices.  
We demonstrated that this behavior is also observed in 
other variants. Other authors also analyzed IEEE 802.11 a 
and b theoretically [33] and observed this behavior.     
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have measured the signal strength inside 
the coverage area of several WLAN variants (concretely in 
the IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n).  
On the one hand, the measurements have been carried out 
under specific conditions, inside a house with a particular 
form and size. We chose an isolated place, free of wireless 
signals, in order to not having distorted results. We were 
pursuing accurate measurements. On the other hand, a 
specific antenna has been used, with a particular sensitivity. 
May be the same experiment performed in other conditions, 
may vary the results slightly. However, due to the results and 
other previous tests we had made, we believe that the results 
obtained are a good sign of the technology behavior. Similar 
results would be obtained under the same conditions 
We can see that in the closest zones, the best 
technologies have been IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11n, 
while the worst ones have been IEEE 802.11g and IEEE 
802.11a. The one with highest signal strength in larger 
distances has been IEEE 802.11b and the worst ones have 
been IEEE 802.11g and IEEE 802.11n. 
We have also measured the interferences between 
neighboring channels for each variant. We have observed 
different effects. On the one hand, we observed that the 
hypothesis, which told us that if we increase the separation 
of working channels, we should record lower losses, so it 
would not be always true. May be this effect happens 
because the measurements have been taken in closed zones, 
and the signal reflections may affect to the received signal 
strength. We think that this is a key factor when we are going 
to set up an IEEE 802.11 WLAN. Moreover, we have proved 
that packet looses have a fifth degree polynomial function of 
the channel separation (it matches this function almost 
exactly). 
In general, although we have seen that the hardware used 
is more significant in the packet loss than the chosen IEEE 
802.11 variant, we think that the variants IEEE 802.11b and 
IEEE 802.11g seem to be better for installations in closest 
zones. 
Because there is an increasing number of wireless 
devices, and the presence of wireless networks working 
under the IEEE 802.11 technology is increasing, the 
likelihood to create interference is greater. 
 In a future work we will use the studies we have done in 
order to estimate the best position for a wireless sensor 
device inside a network, based on the received signal 
strength and the frequency interferences, in order to avoid 
having random sensor placements.
