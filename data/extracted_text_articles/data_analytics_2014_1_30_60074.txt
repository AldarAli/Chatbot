Abstract—In this paper, we study activity on the microblogging
platform Twitter. We analyse two separate aspects of activity on
Twitter. First, we analyse the daily and weekly number of posts,
through which we ﬁnd clear circadian (daily) patterns emerging
in the use of Twitter for multiple languages. We see that both
the number of tweets and the daily and weekly activity patterns
differ between languages. Second, we analyse the progression
of individual tweets through retweets in the Twittersphere. We
ﬁnd that the size of these progressions follow a power-law
distribution. Furthermore, we build an algorithm to analyse the
actual structure of the progressions and use this algorithm on a
limited set of tweets. We ﬁnd that retweet trees show a star-like
structure.

I.
INTRODUCTION
In the current digital age, many different (micro)blogging
platforms have emerged, e.g., Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn.
Using these media, users can share everyday thoughts and
activities. Through this sharing behaviour, large quantities of
information are available to researchers who have distinguished
many applications for the valorisation of this information.
Within these applications, the focus is placed on predicting
the future. The implementation of predictions using data from
Twitter cover very different areas, e.g., predictions with respect
to policital elections [1], the prediction of stock market prices
[2], estimating the box-ofﬁce revenue of a movie [3], and the
detection of earthquakes [4].
In most social media, there is a notion of trending topics.
With this notion, questions arise as to how and when these
topics emerge and grow. Since these questions are far from
trivial, we need more insight in the normal use of this social
media to be able to answer these questions. Because if one
understands the patterns of usage of a social medium, this
insight will lead to understanding of the trending mechanism.
Therefore, in this paper, we study the patterns of use in
Twitter. We focus on two aspects that provide a ﬁrst insight in
the usage of Twitter. First, we give the reader an overview
of related research in Section II. Then, in Section III, we
describe the process of gathering the data we used in the study.
The analysis of circadian patterns in Twitter is presented in
Section IV. Thereafter, in Section V, we display our analysis
of the progression of retweets through the user network of
Twitter. Finally, we draw our conclusions and discuss possible
extensions of our work in Section VI.
II.
RELATED RESEARCH
In this section, we provide the reader with a brief overview
of related research in the two areas that we adress in this paper.
The ﬁrst of these ﬁelds is the circadian pattern that appears
in social media usage. Secondly, we focus on the spread of
information in social media.
A. Circadian patterns in Social Media
First, we consider social media activity. This has been
researched for many different social media platforms. For
instance, Kaltenbrunner et al. [5] analyse the activity pattern
in Slashdot, a news site. They observe both daily and weekly
activity patterns in the use of the site. Also, Gill et al. [6]
study the activity of Youtube. They ﬁnd clear circadian and
weekly patterns, where the majority of the activity takes place
at the end of the day during weekdays. Szabo and Huberman
[7] examine the activity patterns on Digg and Youtube. They
notice a weekly cycle of activity in Digg and investigate the
popularity pattern of articles in Digg and videos in Youtube.
Noulas et al. [8] investigate the user activity pattern on
Foursquare. They ﬁnd clear geo-temporal rhythms in its activ-
ity, both for weekdays and weekends. Moreover, Grinberg et
al. [9] use Foursquare data to extract real-life activity patterns.
They observe that there are clear patterns for coarse categories,
such as food or nightlife. They also notice that these patterns
are present in Twitter.
Yasseri et al. [10] analyse circadian patterns in editorial
activity on Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia. They ﬁnd a
clear daily pattern in activity per language. The only exception
to these patterns is the English Wikipedia. For this language,
the activity is more spread out over the day. Also, they ﬁnd
four weekly activity patterns for different groups of countries.
Ten Thij et al. [11] study the page-view activity patterns for
Wikipedia and observe circadian patterns in page-view activity.
Poblete et al. [12] investigate the user activity on Twitter for
the top 10 countries in their sample. They perform an analysis
of the activity based on sentiment and network properties.
They ﬁnd that the network and user properties can differ
from country to country, from small connected networks to a
large and more hierarchical structured network. Mocanu et al.
[13] study GPS-tagged tweets by location and language. They
analyse the heterogeneity of language use for many levels (e.g.,
global, country and city) and observe clear peaks in activity
by tourists in some countries in the Mediterranian.

B. Information spread
In the second part of our work, we focus on the spread of
information through the network. Again, this type of activity
analysis has been executed for multiple platforms. For instance,
Jurgens and Lu [14] analyse temporal patterns in edits to
Wikipedia articles. Their analysis reveals motif instances in
the edit-patterns to pages.
Lerman and Gosh [15] analyse user activity on Digg and
Twitter. They conclude that despite their different setup, both
sites display similar patterns of information spread. Kamath
et al. [16] analyse the geo-spacial progression of hashtags in
Twitter using geo-tagged tweets. They use their analysis to
ﬁnd analytics techniques to characterize the relative impact of
locations on spread dynamics of a topic. Yang and Leskovec
[17] investigate temporal patterns arising in the popularity of
online content. They formulate this as a time series clustering
problem and formulate an algorithm to cluster these time series
with respect to the patterns they exhibit. Finally, Bhamidi et
al. [18] develop a random graph model that models the giant
component of the retweet network induced by an event on
Twitter. We aim to extend this insight to a message-based
insight in the spread dynamics of Twitter.
III.
DATASET
In this section, we describe how we obtained the tweets
that were using in our analysis. The tweets were scraped
by RTreporter, a company that uses the incoming stream of
Dutch tweets to detect news in the Netherlands. These tweets
are scraped using the ﬁlter stream of the Twitter Application
Programming Interface (API) [19]. We set up four different
streams, the ﬁrst two streams (called sample and geo-located)
are meant to give an overview of the stream of Twitter
messages. The third and fourth stream (called “Netherlands
(NL) general” and “NL speciﬁc”) are set up with the goal to
scrape as many Dutch tweets as possible.
The ﬁrst stream is the so-called sample stream. It outputs
a sample of the complete Twitter Firehose. The sample that is
given, contains roughly 1% of all tweets. The second stream
uses the option location of the ﬁlter stream, in which a geo-
location square is deﬁned. All the tweets within this square
are caught. We ﬁlter the stream on the geo-square induced by
((-179.99, -89.99), (179.99, 89.99)).
We call the third stream the “NL general” stream. In this
stream, we use ﬁlter stream with the option track, where a list
of words must be deﬁned. All tweets containing one of these
words are caught. We deﬁne a list of general Dutch words
(e.g., ‘een, het, ik, niet, maar, heb, jij, nog, bij’). In total,
this list consists of 130 words. Lastly, the fourth stream, “NL
speciﬁc” uses the ﬁlter stream combining track and follow.
For this last option, we add a list of user IDs for which all
tweets are caught. In total, we deﬁne a list of 1,303 users.
Examples of accounts are @NUnl,@TilburginBeeld. The list of
terms consists of 395 entries (e.g., ‘brandweer, politie, gewond,
ambulance’). Note that a speciﬁc tweet may be contained in
multiple streams, we have not distinguished duplicates in our
dataset.
Since we do not have access to the Twitter Firehose, we do
not receive all tweets that we request due to rate limitations by
Twitter [20]. An overview of the missed tweets is presented in
Table I. Furthermore, in Figure 1, we display the number of
tweets that were missed per stream on a daily scale. We see
that the number of missed tweets in the ‘NL general’ stream is
gradually decaying over time. In our experience, this decrease
is probably caused by a decrease in the number of ’spam’
tweets made by Dutch teens (e.g., tweets like “Welterusten!”,
which means “Good night!”). The geo-located stream follows
an increasing trend. Furthermore, the sample stream has no
missed tweets, which is logical, since the maximum number
of tweets that one can receive is bounded by this number. With
respect to the ‘NL speciﬁc’ stream, we see that the number of
missed tweets is small, with the exception of some dates. We
have not performed a more detailed analysis of the speciﬁc
activity during these days.

We process the tweets that have been obtained by these
four streams from February 1st 2013 to February 1st 2014.
The number of tweets, clustered by language, for each stream
is indicated in Table II. For the sample stream, we also
indicate which percentage of all tweets was posted in the given
language (denoted in brackets behind the number of tweets).
The timezone information displayed in Table II is used to
correct the daily/weekly patterns for comparison. If a language
is commonly used in multiple timezones, we search for a city
that is located in the center of this area and base the correction
on this city. These cities are also mentioned in Table II.
IV.
TWEET PATTERNS
In this section, we discuss the temporal patterns that emerge
in the data. We focus on two streams, namely the geo-
located and sample streams, since these streams give a wide
perspective on the trafﬁc on Twitter. We present an analysis
of these two streams on a daily scale for the complete year.
Also, we present a more ﬁne-grained analysis of the hourly
patterns, both on a daily and a weekly basis.

languages. Since several plots greatly overlap, we display these
plots in Figure 2 in three separate ﬁgures. The clear majority
of the tweets we found are written in English (see Figure 2a),
followed by the number of tweets in Japanese. Next we ﬁnd
Spanish, Indonesian, Portuguese, and Arabic. In Figure 2b, we

indicate 0 tweets per language. This is because Twitter updated
the language detection algorithms during this time [21]. After
language detection is turned on, there are still clear jumps
for certain languages. Most likely, these jumps correlate with
updates of language detection algorithms in these languages.
For the number of Dutch tweets in the sample stream, we
see that this quantity is decreasing. We note that a decreasing
line in Figure 2 does not have to imply that the number of
tweets of that language is decreasing, since the quantities in the
sample stream are relative to the total Twitter stream. However,
Figure 3 shows the daily number of Dutch tweets that were
received for all four streams.
We see that all four streams

show a decreasing pattern. Thus, we can conclude that the
total volume of Dutch tweets is decreasing. This fact is also
supported by Figure 1, in which the number of missed tweets
for the ‘NL general’ stream is decreasing.
Second, we focus on the daily patterns in the tweet volume.
Since all languages are spoken in different timezones, we
adjust the time-series to UTC time. The corrections that we
used can be found in Table II. We analyse the daily patterns
of two streams, namely the geo-located and the sample stream
(Figures 4a and 4b, respectively). One striking difference
between these ﬁgures is that while the sample stream displays a
similar pattern for all languages, the geo-located stream differs
strongly between languages. In the geo-located stream, we see
two clear intervals where the activity peaks, namely during
lunch hours and during the evening, which concurs with the
ﬁndings of [9]. In Figure 4c, we highlight the daily patterns
of three languages: English, Spanish, and Portuguese. These
patterns are rescaled to American times, thus the majority
of the usage of Twitter in these languages originates there.
Furthermore, the amplitude of the English pattern is very low,
therefore the activity in English is very spread out during the
day. A large contrast to this is the pattern in Portuguese tweets.
In this pattern, we clearly see a large decay in the number of
tweets during the hours of the night.
Third, we regard weekly patterns in the tweet volume.
Again, we focus on the geo-located and the sample stream.
Similar to the daily patterns, we see that the sample stream
patterns in Figure 5b are more consistent than the patterns
in the geo-located streams in Figure 5a. For the majority
of languages, we see a decreasing activity throughout the
week in the sample stream patterns. Two good examples of
this ‘standard’ pattern are Japanese and French, which are
highlighted in Figure 5c. After a weekly decrease, the activity
increases again on Sunday. Another language that follows
this pattern is English; however, it has a very low amplitude
with respect to the aforementioned languages. However, a
clear exception to this pattern is the Hebrew pattern. In this
language, the increase in activity happens on Saturday (since
it is the Sabbat). Further, we ﬁnd that for languages for which
we have a small number of tweets (e.g., Finnish), there is
only a decrease in activity during the night. The afternoon and
evening activity for these languages are evenly distributed.
V.
RETWEET TREES
In this section, we analyse the progression of tweets in
our dataset through retweets. We deﬁne the progression of a
message m as the retweet tree related to that message, which
we denote by Tm. The graph Tm is a rooted tree, where all
non-root vertices indicate people who retweeted the original
message. If a user retweets an already retweeted message, this
is shown as a new level in Tm. We use all four streams to
determine the retweet trees. Figure 8 gives some examples of
retweet trees.

We aim to derive the distribution function for the size of
a retweet tree. Thus for each retweet tree in our dataset, we
calculate the number of nodes in Tm, denoted by |VTm|, and
use this to build the distribution function. This function is
displayed in Figure 6a. Using this distribution function, we
determine the Complementary Cumulative Density Function
(CCDF) of the retweet tree size (see Figure 6b). From these
plots, we ﬁnd that the retweet tree size follows a power-law
distribution.
When a retweet is received in the Twitter API, one also
receives the original message. However, the level at which this
message lies in the retweet tree Tm is not given. Therefore, we
propose the following algorithm to determine the progression
of a retweet tree Tm. Given all retweets of a certain message,
we start with this message. Then, for all retweets, we ﬁnd
out if the user that made that retweet is following the original
poster of the message. If this is the case, this user retweeted
the original poster. After we checked all users, we ﬁnd the
ﬁrst level of the retweet tree. If we iterate this procedure
until we cannot add new retweets to the tree, we are done.
However, using this approach, it could be the case that some
retweets have not been placed in the tree. Since these users do
not follow any of the other users, we assume they found the
tweet through search and thus retweet the original message.
This algorithm is deﬁned more formally in Figure 7. Here,
we denote Lc as the current level, Ln as the new level and
C is a list of checked messages. Furthermore, TS is short for
timestamp, MID and UID are the message and user ID number,
respectively, and ETm indicates the edge-set of tree Tm.
Hereafter, we studied the progression of retweet trees for
January 13th 2014 from 18h to 19h. We chose a smaller dataset
for this analysis due to the rate limitation of the Twitter API,
which we need to check the follow-relation between two users
in line 7 of Figure 7.
After retrieving the follow-relations and after processing
the retweets, we ﬁnd that the retweet trees tend to be wide
and shallow. For instance the retweet tree consisting of three
nodes of a star-shape (Figure 8b) occurs 4,135 times whereas
the path-shape retweet tree of three nodes (Figure 8c) only
occurs 27 times. Although part of this preference is caused by
the last part of our algorithm, we ﬁnd that we can allocate
67.71% of the 93,579 retweets of the timeframe by using the
follow-relations in Figure 7.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we analysed two aspects of user behaviour
in Twitter. First, we analysed daily and weekly patterns that
emerge from user activity in Twitter. We found that there

are clear circadian patterns for every language we studied.
Moreover, all studied languages show a similar daily pattern
throughout the week. This concurs with studies done for other
social media.
Also, we examined the number of daily tweets per lan-
guage. Here we found no global patterns that hold for every
language. However, through an analysis of the number of
tweets that were not received through the streaming API, we
see that the percentage of tweets that contains geo-locational
data is increasing over time.
Furthermore, we studied the distribution of the size of
a retweet tree. We found that these sizes follow a power-
law distribution. Moreover, we extended this analysis to the
actual progression of retweet trees in Twitter and found that
retweet trees tend to be wide and shallow in their structure.
For the algorithm in Figure 7, we need to know the network of
relations within Twitter. Since this is a very time-consuming
process, a possible extension of this work is to ﬁnd a way to
determine the progression of a retweet tree without knowing
the complete graph.
