Abstract—In OFDM systems, in-phase and quadrature (I/Q)
imbalances generated in the analog front-end introduce inter-
channel interference and, consequently, error performance degra-
dation. This paper provides an exact expression involving the two-
dimensional (2-D) Gaussian Q-function for the error probability
of an arbitrary 2-D modulated OFDM signal with I/Q imbalances
in frequency-ﬂat Rayleigh fading channel.
Index Terms—I/Q imbalance, Probability of error, Inter-
channel interference
I. INTRODUCTION
In-phase and quadrature (I/Q) amplitude and phase im-
balances are inevitably caused by signal processing in the
analog components such as I/Q mixers, phase shifters, ﬁlters,
and analog/digital converters within I/Q branches. In the
implementation of a modern wireless communication system,
I/Q imbalances act as one of the main impairments degrading
system performance. Particularly in the orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) schemes adapted in a number
of wireless communication systems such as DAB, DVB-T,
WLAN (802.11 a/g/n), WPAN (802.15.3a), WMAN (802.16
a/d/e), and MBWA (802.20), I/Q imbalances introduce inter-
channel interference (ICI) and nonlinearly distort the baseband
signals [1], [2]. The effects of I/Q imbalances on OFDM sys-
tem performance have been analyzed by computer simulations,
and several compensation techniques have been reported in
many places in the literature [3]-[6].
In general, for a single-carrier system, I/Q imbalances in the
receiver lead to a correlation between I/Q branches, and the
correlation is revealed as the variations of the received signal
points and the noise distribution on the constellation [7], [8].
For a single-carrier system, a method was recently provided
to exactly analyze the effect of I/Q imbalances generated in
the analog front-end of the receiver on the error performance
[9]. In this paper, we derive an exact expression for the error
probability of an arbitrary 2-D modulated signal with I/Q
imbalances in an OFDM system over frequency-ﬂat Rayleigh
fading channel. Through a computer simulation, we verify the
validity of the result obtained from the derived expression.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Fig. 1 shows a typical OFDM transceiver where we assume,
for simplicity of analysis, I/Q amplitude and phase imbalances

take place in the receiver side. As shown in Fig. 1, the OFDM
transmitter undergoes an ideal complex up-conversion, but the
received signals are affected by I/Q imbalances in the analog
front-end of the receiver.
Assume that Dk ∈ t−s = [t−s1 t−s2 ... t−sM] is the com-
plex symbol modulated by an arbitrary 2-D M-ary modulator,
and is transmitted on subcarrier k in the OFDM system, where
t−s is a set of M signal points transmitted through the OFDM
system. Then, Dk can be deﬁned as
Dk =ζi,k
p
Esejψi,k,k=0, 1, ..., Ns − 1,i=1, 2, ..., M
(1)
where ψi,k and ζi,k
√Es are the phase and the amplitude of
the i-th signal point transmitted on subcarrier k, Es is the
average symbol energy, ζi,k is a scale factor which varies
with the position of the signal point, and Ns is the number of
subcarriers.
The ideally up-converted transmitted signal at the transmit-
ter is formally given by

Finally, since the baseband signal transmitted on subcar-
rier (Ns − k) , which causes ICI to the signal transmitted
on subcarrier k in the receiver, is one of the M signals,
t−si, i = 1, 2, ..., M, the average SER for a signal point
