Abstract—Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) uses a simple
principle of signal broadcast by a transmission station. The
signal is broadcasted to the open air and intercepted by a
metallic object whose molecular structure reflects the wave
being broadcasted back to the transmission station. The
transmitting station can then evaluate the signal to determine
the identity of the object. RFID has been around since World
War I, but due to cost, research was limited. It was not until
militarization during World War II that RFID research was
cost effective. The RFID technology is used within offices
buildings, airports, grocery stores, and academic institutions
for access control. This paper is a study in which the evolution
of RFID was reviewed and an attempt was made to exploit the
encryption of a German Schoko Ticket and District of
Columbia (D.C.) Metro MiFare card RFID signals, by using
publicly available devices. The devices used were Arduino
micro-controller board and an MFRC522 RFID reader. The
research showed that both of the RFID cards included in the
student were actually from the MiFare DESfire family and
that there is a security threat to these cards that users need to
be aware of.
Keywords- RFID; cybersecurity; Microcontroller; Arduino.

INTRODUCTION
After the conclusion of World War I, military forces
turned their attention towards technologies that would
provide
clairvoyance,
in
reference
to
future
attacks.
Research on radio technologies up to this point was
expensive to facilitate an had little rate of success. This held
true until a discovery by the United States Research
Laboratory
(NRL)[3].
The
NRL
had
successfully
broadcasted a signal towards a secondary location across the
Potomac river, which was refracted by a naval vessel upon
its transmission.
RFID is a technology that is used for access control
purposes by people and objects. This is widely used by
academic institutions and corporate business offices where
tapping of the personal RFID chip based card on the tag
reader will grant employees access to secure areas to aid in
security of data. Similar technologies are used in keeping
track of inventory at the local grocery stores and to gain
access to public transportation systems. RFID helps the
world meet various organizational needs and in most
situations is a cost effective process.
The Pre-Pottery Neolithic Era was the first to create
large scale storage facilities to store food that had been left
over from their gathering season [1]. People living during
this time chose a location that was remote to their villa,
ensuring that their precious food was easily accessible.
Their existence depended on access to food, marking the
creation of the first theorized security. As mankind traversed
from stone to bronze, securities shifted to follow the
progression. Once mankind had established a way to
produce food, they realized the need to protect their food
source from danger – resulting in the erection of walls
around the town villa. The concept of securing critical
possessions has followed us into the world that we live in
today. We have locks on the front doors of our homes,
armed military guards around the white house, and access
cards to control our entry to our place of work. The physical
dangers of having a neighboring tribe raiding the village and
stealing the village’s food have been translated into the
digital danger of using a weak password to protect monetary
funds from cyber criminals. As civilization progresses
through the Technological Age, it has created a commodity;
the
security
of
digital
data.
Business,
organizations,
governments, educational institutes and municipalities all
rely on the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data
to ensure continuity in their respective field of practice. The
identification of this commodity has opened a wide range of
opportunities for both offensive and defensive members of
the Information Technology (IT) taskforce. With each
defender’s innovation, a challenge is posed to the offender.
This affinity has been identified as Red Team versus Blue
Team [2].
This paper is a study about RFID technology to
understand its security threats and use of the German Schoko
Ticket and District of Columbia (D.C.) USA Metro MiFare
card for transportation systems. Cards are used to ride on
public buses and trains and record the passenger travel on the
system. Each time the card is swiped for entry at bus or train
stations, data is transmitted that someone may intercept. The
study concluded with a Red Team [2] approach to exploit,
extract information contained on RIFD technologies and
provide a structured understanding of inner workings of
Access Control (AC) Systems. Section II provides a brief
history of security technologies, while Section III provides a
brief background of access control technologies. In Section
IV, Microcontrollers and RFID cards will be discussed.
Section V will present the exploratory research and the
conclusions from the findings of the research from Section
V, will be discussed in Section VI.

HISTORY
A. Primitive Technologies
The origins of Radio Wave Technologies can be
traced
back to Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Maxwell
theorized
the
first
correlation
between
magnetism,
electricity, and light. His discoveries can be summarized
into three primary concepts:
•
Electricity may penetrate most metallic objects because
of movement of electrons within the atom. When
electrons move, they create a magnetic field [3].
•
Electromagnetic devices may be combined into one
device. Fluctuating magnetic waves produce an electric
current [3].
•
Radio Waves share the same characteristics as light
waves, but with varying frequencies [4].
These
discoveries
supplied
the
groundwork
for
scientists and engineers to fabricate technologies utilizing
wireless communication. “His work was later adopted by
German physicist, Heinrich Hertz, refracted a 66cm radio
wave off dielectric and metallic objects “ [5]. Six-teen years
later, the first patent for a ship navigation device utilizing
his technology was issued to German engineer, Christian
Hansmeyer, who received acceptance for his patent from
multiple countries [5]. Despite being awarded his patents,
the complexity of the invention prevented it from becoming
a tool that could be commonly utilized until its adoption by
the military for approximately another 20 years.
B. Radar
Monopulse radar, which NRL developed in 1943, is the
basis for all modern tracking and missile control radars in
the United States [1].
III.
ACCESS CONTROL
Resources are critical to the development of private
infrastructures,
government
agencies
and
organizations
alike. To ensure the continuity, integrity, and authenticity of
an organization’s resources, i.e. data,, certain preventative
access measures are put in to place. Access control is
referenced as any mechanism used within an information
system for granting or denying approval to used specific
resources [6]. This may be accomplished through external
perimeter defenses, internal physical access security, and
physical device security.
A. Types of Physical Access Control
There are many thigs that have been used for physical
access controls, such as barriers, cages, barricades, bollards,
motion detection systems, security personnel, keyed door
locks, deadbolt locks, and cipher locks.
B. Types of Electronic Access Control
This study focuses primarily on the components used
to read and write information located within an RF
identifiable object. This study will refer to that object as a
tag, card or fob interchangeably. This work focuses
primarily on the components used to read and write
information located within an RFID identifiable object.
The words: “tag”, “card”, “token” and “fob” may be used
as an interchangeable reference to the device that holds the
data activated by the RFID reader. RFID tags consist of
four primary components that allow their data to be
accessed by the RFID reader: transponder, rectifier circuit,
controller and memory.
The RFID reader consists of three primary components:
signal generator, Microcontroller and receiver. The signal
generator and receiver are sub-derivatives of the analog
circuit block, which is responsible for driving the radio
signal and receiving the radio signal’s modulated voltage.
This analog data is then covered by an Analog-Digital-
Converter and passed to the Microcontroller to enumerate
the cryptographic functions that have been performed by
the tag, as seen in Figure 1 below [8].
C.
RFID
The three frequencies that tags normally operate at are
Low (LF), High (HF), and Ultra High (UHF) [18][19].
Figure 2 shows the common bands that RFID operates
within.

RFID is popular because it offers improved security in
access control to reduce theft, allows for tag linking,
automated identification, location tracking, reduction of
human interaction, improved data integrity, and range
reading capability and high data transfer rate [20]. There are
many applications where RFID is used, as seen in Figure 3
below.
Figure 3. RFID Applications [21].
Figure 4. Access Control Systems - Component Information.
The component information for this study is found in Figure
4 above. These components consist of a database, RFID
Reader, signal generator, Interrogator, and a tag.
IV.
MICROCONTROLLERS & CARDS
For the sake of this study, the terms “Microcontroller”,
“microprocessor” and “chip” will be used interchangeably.
Microcontrollers are chips or microcomputers manufactured
through Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI), a process
where thousands of transistors are combined into a single
chip. This chip may be used as an embedded component of a
Real Time Operating System (RTOS). The advantages of
this technology over prior semiconductor technologies are its
ability to produce a chip that is smaller, less expensive,
faster, requires less power and contains more logic gates than
preceding chips [9]. The word “Microcontroller” is used as a
misnomer for the word “Microcontroller Board”, which
references the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) holding the
Microcontroller, the integrated Random Access Memory
(RAM) on the chip and the peripheral Input / Output (I/O)
circuits
that
are
attached
to
the
PCB.
Common
Microcontroller applications include: robotics, smart home
automation,
car engines, computer
peripherals,
mobile
phones, washing machines, cameras and security alarms
[10].
A. Microcontrollers
The primary function of a Microcontroller is to process
binary data. This is accomplished by passing electrical
pulses representing data through a series of registers and
transistors called logic gates to perform the desired binary
arithmetic. Two common applications of computational
instruction sets are Complex Instruction Set Computer
(CISC) and Reduced Instruction Set (RIS). A RIS Computer
(RISC) accepts only one operand per instruction cycle
whereas a CISC compacts operand arguments into one
instruction. CISC require more physical logic gates within
the processor to execute the commands stored within the
processor’s registers, therefore making this technology more
expensive. RISC technologies are still used as they provide
backwards compatibility to processors that have not been
designed and/or capable of accepting CIS commands [9].
Common examples of Reduced Instruction Set opt codes for
binary arithmetic include: ADD, AND, OR, XOR, and
NOT. The density of the binary data that is being
transmitted every clock cycle should be known as a “word
length”. This number is often referenced by the word “bit”
after the respective word size. The maximum amount of
data that a Microcontroller can process is determined by the
width of the registers contained within the controllers
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). A 8-bit Microcontroller is
capable of transmitting 0x00 – 0xFF (0 – 255) per clock
cycle, while a 16-bit bit processor is capable of performing
arithmetic with a range of 0x000 – 0xFFFF (0-65535) per
clock cycle [11].
Microcontroller families may be identified by one of the
following characteristics: bit depth, memory architecture,
simple / complex instruction or memory devices [11].
Microcontroller boards are simply small form factor Printed
Circuit Boards (PCB) that are designed to handle a single
operation or program. They operate in the same way that the
computer’s PCB is being used to view this journal.
Microcontroller boards or, single-board Microcontrollers,
are comprised of a Microcontroller that is implanted or
imbedded on to a PCB. These boards have low power draw,
are small formfactor and contain I/O systems that enable the
use of multiple sensory devices. They are inexpensive --
currently as of March 2019, the Arduino Uno REV3 costs
$22.00 excluding tax and shipping [12]. Controller boards
are manufactured by a wide range of vendors [9]. some such
as
Arduino
and
Raspberry
Pi,
provide
open
source
documentation to the controller board, as well as source
code for projects of any application [10].
Microcontroller
boards
share
some
of
the
same
characteristics as Microcontrollers but are to be considered
the component that hosts the embedded Microcontroller
rather than the component being embedded into the Real
Time Operating System. Microcontroller boards share the
following characteristics:
•
They must contain a
way to preform binary
arithmetic
via
a
processing
unit.
These
Microcontrollers may be embedded or modular.

•
They must have a means to load a program into
memory. This is typically done through a Easily
Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) chip,
or Electrically Erasable Programable Read-Only
Memory E2PROM chip that is stored on the
Microcontroller board.
B. Arduino
Arduino is an easy to use, open source, project-oriented
Microcontroller board developed by Interaction Design
Institute Ivera in Ivera, Italy [8]. Its sources can be traced
back to Hernando Barragán, who laid the schematic
foundation of the Arduino project [8]. Missimo Banzi and
David Cuartielles sought to build from Hernando’s work,
creating user friendly programmable device geared towards
design and interactive art [8]. David Mellis thereafter joined
the development team, created the Arduino Independent
Development Environment that was designed paralleled
with the board’s schematics. Gianluca Martino and Tom
Igoe were the last two members to join the Arduino project
[8]. These five members are known to be the original
creators of Arduino [8]. The purpose of Arduino’s creation
was to provide an inexpensive, easy-to-use tool that allowed
designers interoperability between hardware components.
This resulted in the Atmel AVR 8-bit processor (Atmega8)
to be selected during the board’s prototyping phase [17].
C. MiFare Card
The Mifare RFID card was used in this study has an
internal memory of 1 kB. This memory is divided into
sixteen sections, each section composed of four blocks of
sixteen bytes, see Figure 5 below.
Figure 5. Details of the memory organization of the Mifare RFID [9].
The first block of the first section includes the card Unique
IDentifier (UID) and the rest of the blocks are reserved for
application data that can be read and written by the user, e.g.
usually user-related information [22].
V.
EXPLOITATION RESEARCH
In October 2008, the Netherland educational institute,
Radboud Universität Nijmegen, announced its intentions to
publish the complete reverse engineering of the CRYPTO-1
algorithm used by NPX Semiconductor’s MiFARE Classic
cards.
NPX
Semiconductor
is
an
American
Dutch
semiconductor manufacturer who responded by placing the
publication under judicial process in hopes to prevent it
from being
published,
eventually being
overruled
by
legislature under constitutional freedom of speech [23].
Libraries may be built around to aid the exploitation of the
~3.5 billion MiFARE cards are in circulation around the
world
[24].
Shortly
after,
security
research
company
“Nethemba” published “MFOC”, a package for nested
offline attacks on MiFARE Classic cards. Andrei Costin, an
assistant professor at University of Jyvaskyla in Finland,
also received a great benefit from the research conducted
was the development of the MiFare Classic Universal
Toolkit now known as “MFCUK” [25]. These tools allow
for the complete enumeration and replication of cards that
implement the CRYPT0-1 encryption algorithm aided by
Microcontrollers with RFID reader-writers. These software
libraries, among others, have been combined to form the
first multi-platform low level RFID Application Programing
Interface known as Near-Field Communications (NFC)
tools provides functionally between a multitude of RFID
reader-writers. NFC-Tools is integrated by default with
downloading the latest platform of Kali Linux and is
considered the de-facto library for cracking MiFARE
Classic cards.
In this study, cloning to a blank and re-writable RFID
card is a relatively inexpensive and easy approach to
execute two main types of attacks known as card skimming
and unauthorized use. RFID card skimming captures the
data without the card owner’s knowledge and then the
attacker uses the data to clone a new card to impersonate the
legitimate
user’s
authentication
systems.
RFID
card
unauthorized use is when a card is replicated to give the
attacker authenticated access to specific services such as
ability to ride a Metro train or bus.
With these vulnerabilities in mind, a model attack was
setup with a clone RFID card. The writing block is
composed of an Arduino RC522 RFID reader. To complete
this cloning process, the test cards were written to blank
tags. Then the card information is directly obtained from the
application layer and must be inserted manually on the
Arduino sketch. The Arduino UNO was coded in Arduino C
using the MFRC522 open source library [26] to interact
with the rC522 RFID reader.
VI.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
There are several known vulnerabilities associated with
the use of RFID technology that have major impact on card
owners, who become victims. The use of RFID-based cards
in the context of Public Transportation Systems, such as
Metro, presents several vulnerabilities that compromise their
effective use for authentication and balance tracking.
Current use of the tested cards provides an opportunity for

attackers to easily and successfully carry out card cloning
attacks.
This research was paired with an attempt to break the
encryption of the German “Schoko Ticket” and District of
Columbia “Metro” MiFARE cards. The Arduino Uno
Rev3 was the Microcontroller board that was supplied
paired with the RFID-RC522 RFID reader-writer to
conduct
tag
enumeration
and
reading/writing.
The
MFRC522 was the Arduino library used to control the
RC522 reader. The results showed that by using low-cost
commercial-off-the-shelf
hardware
and
open-source
source software, it is easy and simple for cyber criminals
to perform attacks. These vulnerabilities allowed for
cloning of any RFID card within the testing RFID reader
range. This means that if an attacker can get close enough
to any Metro RFID card with a RFID reader, the card
maybe cloned and then used to ride for free on the public
transportation system.
Methods of reducing these types of attacks include
changing the authentication from the default, applying
cryptographic algorithms on transmitted data to hide
information, employ encrypted access tokens on data
blocks to identify the RFID owner, add a privacy bit
controlled, or employ random numbers to identify the
card.
Future research may be using the RFID device around
campus to see if able to obtain and clone fob data that
faculty, maintenance staff, and security use to enter into
restricted areas.
