Abstract— Black Swan situations and their consequences 
are considered extremely unlikely before they happen and 
make perfect sense afterwards. Two malicious cyber attacks 
that triggered Black Swan situations, Emotet and WannaCry, 
are assessed, along with their attack sequences, and the 
vulnerabilities they exploited. The early warning signs and 
practical actions to prevent these types of Cyber Black Swan 
situations are presented. Prevention is based on protection 
through practical defence in depth controls along with effective 
ongoing maintenance. Added to this is the crucial element of 
situational awareness and a call to action for the cyber teams 
to focus their response efforts. This robust foundation of 
security and resilience, when combined with adaptability, are 
the attributes for antifragility. Enabling the organisation to 
thrive and grow in the midst of this volatility.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
In his book: “Antifragility, things that gain from 
disorder,” Nassim Taleb [51] uses the term Black Swan to 
describe unexpected situations with three attributes: Before 
the situation occurs, it is considered extremely unlikely, if 
not impossible; When it occurs its consequences are 
significant, either in changing belief, or in consequence; 
After it has occurred, it makes perfect sense as something 
that could happen [1][19][52]. As an Australian, the notion 
of a Black Swan as an unexpected event is counter intuitive. 
While the swans in Europe may be white, in Australia the 
native swans are black. In a country of jumping kangaroos 
and duck-billed platypus, the unexpected is modus operandi 
[1].  
With Australian insight it becomes clear that unusual 
creatures and events do not just suddenly appear, they 
evolve over time. Similarly, Black Swan situations develop 
over time and show early warning indicators. Noticing these 
early signs and acting upon them, will make the difference 
between a dramatic event, a well-managed situation, or just 
another day doing business [1]. The proposed approach for 
responding to these Black Swans is based on situational 
awareness, basic, practical, and well-maintained cyber 
controls, and response to emergency situations.  
Two black swan cyber situations, the Emotet Trojan, 
and the WannaCry Worm, are reviewed along with their 
attack vectors and the vulnerabilities they target. These two 
cyber attacks that triggered Black Swan situations were 
selected due to their scale and impact, which in turn can be 
attributed primarily to the lack of preparation and poor 
response of the target organisations. These attacks differed 
in their initial access approach, their style of attack, and the 
combinations of attack vectors they utilised [6][44]. For 
each of these black swan cyber situations, the potential for 
predictability and reduced impact through stringent 
maintenance and monitoring, situational awareness, and 
response to early warning indicators is assessed.  
This approach to cyber security and resilience requires 
a combination of structured, pragmatic thinking and follow-
through, along with action-based responses to emerging 
threats. If the organization is to grow and thrive, rather than 
merely survive from these events, adaptive thinking is also 
needed. Antifragility develops through environmental 
awareness, seeking out and being open to opportunities, and 
taking action to take advantage of the volatile environment 
and create new markets. 
Section 2 outlines the Emotet and WannaCry exploits 
and their respective impacts. Section 3 analyses their attack 
sequences for access, escalation, persistence, scanning, 
spread, exfiltration, and assault. Section 4 looks at how 
these events could have been foreseen by reading the early 
warning indicators. Section 5 outlines how these attacks and 
others like them can be mitigated using practical cyber 
defence in depth with effective ongoing maintenance, 
situational awareness, and timely response. Section 6 
addresses the actions needed to contain, manage, and 
recover from an infection. Section 7 explains how 
antifragile organisations, that are adaptable and agile, can 
gain advantage from these situations, and thrive in these 
volatile cyber environments. 
 
II.  EMOTET AND WANNACRY EXPLOITS AND THEIR IMPACTS 
Over the last decade two of the most significant cyber 
attacks, in terms of scale and impact, have been Emotet and 
WannaCry. Both utilised a combination of exploits to target 
Microsoft vulnerabilities and gain access to organisations, 
establish persistence, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate data 
whilst concurrently spreading, infecting, establishing a 
foothold, and implementing assault strategies across the 
network [6][7][22][27][35][42][43][46][48]-[50].

A. Emotet scale and impact 
Emotet is believed to be based out of Ukraine [17][44]. 
It started as a banking Trojan and has continued to evolve 
since it was first identified in 2014 [17][44] (see Figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1. Emotet timeline, adapted from [17]. 
 
In 2019, Emotet was responsible for approximately 
60% of malware email spam [44]. By 2020 it had morphed 
into Botnet as a Service, and Malware as a Service (MaaS) 
with global distribution [55]. Infected devices themselves 
become command and control (C2) bots. In May 2019, 310 
unique infected IP addresses were identified, of which two 
thirds (208) were confirmed bots, and 8% (17) of these were 
also infected with Trickbot [43] (see Figure 2). 
 
 
Figure 2. Geographic distribution of Emotet Botnet IP 
addresses, June 2019 [40]. 
 
In January 2021, the German Bundeskriminalamt 
(BKA) federal police agency coordinated a combined effort 
of law enforcement agencies to shut down the global botnet 
of hundreds of Emotet servers [43]. The Trojan malware, or 
a copycat, returned in November 2021 and infected an 
estimated 1.2 million systems in 2022 [17][43][55] (see 
Figure 1).  
B. WannaCry scale and impact 
In May 2017, after infecting more than 300,000 
computers and crippling 150+ organisations worldwide. 
WannaCry was dubbed “the largest ransomware event in 
history” [43] (see Figure 3). The WannaCry ransomware 
attack was stopped by a MalwareTech cyber researcher, 
who identified a key design flaw and purchased the URL 
WannaCry referenced in its attack sequence [26] (see Figure 
4).  
 
 
Figure 3. Distribution of WannaCry infections  
14 May 2017, after 24 hours [6][23]. 
 
The situations triggered by WannaCry and Emotet 
could both be regarded as Black Swans. Each was 
considered extremely unlikely before they were experienced 
and identified. Each gained the attention of Europol and 
Eurojust due to their scale and the significant and costly 
consequences for those affected [43]. WannaCry brought

the British NHS to a standstill [15], including the closure of 
public hospitals. By June 2022, Emotet had spread from 
banks to auto & other manufacturers, health, government, 
education, transport, real estate, and retail [16][17] across 
Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, North and 
South America [17] (see Figure 2). It was estimated as 
costing in excess of $1 million for every organisation it 
infected [6][43].

[18][25][26][49]. 
 
III.  ATTACK SEQUENCE ANALYSIS 
       While there are some commonalities in the zero-day 
exploits 
targeting 
Microsoft 
SMB 
remote 
control 
vulnerabilities, Emotet and WannaCry utilise different 
attack vectors in the infection process.   
A. Emotet access, escalation, persistence, scanning, 
spread, exfiltration, and assault 
Emotet utilises social engineering phishing campaigns 
to entice recipients to click on a link that downloads a 
macro-infected Microsoft office file. These emails appear to 
come from a friend or colleague, or from a known 
organisation, and include PayPal receipts, shipping 
notifications, 
“past-due” 
invoices 
[6], 
or 
COVID 
information [41] (see Figure 5). The macro executes the 
payload malware for the next stage, where it establishes 
persistence using auto-start registry keys and services to 
embed a scheduled task at startup [6][42][43]. 
 
 
          Figure 5. Emotet malicious email Emotet [6]. 
 
Emotet spreads by extracting contact lists from 
infected users’ email accounts and using these to send 
phishing emails so they appear to come from a friend or 
colleague. Concurrently, Emotet spreads to systems across 
the network by enlisting a credential enumerator with 
service and bypass components. It utilises publicly available 
tools to recover passwords: (i) NetPass.exe from NirSoft 
extracts passwords stored on the user’s system and external 
drives; (ii) WebBrowserPassView extracts passwords stored 
on web-browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, 
Mozilla etc.; and (iii) MailPassView extracts passwords 
stored on email providers such as Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail 
etc. 
Emotet 
concurrently 
utilises 
a 
malicious-actor-
developed spreader module that applies brute force with 
enriched password lists to move through the Windows 
Admin Shares. It uses these credentials to access accounts 
and copy itself to the ADMIN$ of other network hosts, 
before using Server Message Block (SMB) to schedule 
execution on these hosts. It locates writable share drives and 
infects the entire disk by writing the Emotet service 
component onto the network [6][42][43] (see Figure 6).

Figure 6. Emotet attack sequence, derived from [6][42][43]. 
 
      From 2016 Emotet incorporated a Trickbot banking 
trojan which evolved to exploit the Microsoft Windows 
SMBv1 and NBT Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities 
(CVE-2017-0144, CVE-2017-0147), and the Windows 
SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-
0630, 
CVE-2019- 
0633) 
[6][9][11]-[13][29][31]-
[33][36][38]-[40][42]. The Trickbot is used to launch the 
malware payload, bypass Microsoft security measures, 
communicate with the command-and-control infrastructure, 
upload data and download DLL updates [42].  
B. WannaCry access, escalation, persistence, 
scanning, spread, exfiltration, and assault 
WannaCry identified its targets using EternalBlue to 
scan externally facing hosts across the internet where TCP 
ports 139 and 445 were open [54]. These ports are used to 
communicate using the SMB network protocol that enables 
remote code execution in MS Windows & sharing across 
networks [7][22][50].  
When it identified the Microsoft SMB Windows 
Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-
0144) and the Microsoft SMB Windows Server Remote 
Code 
Execution 
Vulnerability 
(CVE-2017-0145) 
[9][10][29][30][36][37][49] which enabled remote code 
execution over SMB v1, EternalBlue then accessed the 
vulnerable target systems and installed the DoublePulsar 
exploit for persistence [7][27][35]. It continued to scan, 
access and replicate while it encrypted files and destroyed 
backups on every computer it infected: disrupting 
businesses by denying users access to their critical data 
[18][46][48][49] (see Figure 8).  
It then displayed a ransomware image to the users of 
infected devices [7][24] (see Figure 7).

IV.  PROACTIVELY LOOKING FOR THE EARLY WARNING 
INDICATORS 
Situational awareness is key to preventing malicious 
exploits developing into Black Swan situations. It enables 
organisations to notice the early warning signs and prepare 
for and respond to emerging situations. The early warning 
signs are there for Emotet and WannaCry, but they will only 
be noticed by those who actively seek them out. The early 
warning signs include: 
1. The cybersecurity capability of the organisation: 
a. 
The cyber-risk awareness of personnel, based 
on their click-rate on targeted phishing 
campaigns.  
b. The level of compliance with standards and 
guidelines for basic defence maintenance 
practices, 
including 
compliance 
to 
the 
Australian Signal Directorate’s Essential Eight 
cyber mitigations, in particular: the extent of 
unpatched 
Microsoft 
windows 
systems; 
privileged access management; ability to 
download macro-enabled email attachments; 
and availability of separately stored backup 
data [2][3][8].  
2. Critical vulnerability reports:  
a. 
Microsoft CVE-2017-0144, CVE-2017-0145, 
& 
CVE-2017-0147 
vulnerability 
reports 
published in the Microsoft Vulnerability 
Update Guide on 14 March 2017 [29]-[31] and 
corresponding CVE reports [9]-[11] and NIST 
reports published on 16 March 2017 [36]-[38]. 
b. Microsoft CVE-2019-0630 & CVE-2019-0633 
vulnerability 
reports 
published 
in 
the 
Microsoft Vulnerability Update Guide on 12 
February 2019 [32][33] and corresponding 
CVE reports [12][13] and NIST reports 
published on 3 May 2019 [39][40]. 
 
3. Threat alerts and reports: 
a. 
Threat alerts and reports are readily available 
through research centres such as Fifth 
Quadrant 
[14], 
Malwarebytes 
[25], 
MalwareTech [26], Metasploit [28], Qualys 
[45], Proofpoint [44], Talos [53], Truesec 
[57][58], and Verizon [61]. 
b. Cyber teams in peer organisations sharing 
information. 
Australian 
organisations, 
including the big-4 Banks, openly share 
information in a joint effort to fight cyber 
crime, directly and through the Joint Cyber 
Security Centre (JCSC) [20]. 
c. 
Up-to-date information is available through 
the reports provided by the Australian Signals 
Directorate (ASD) and US Cert [4][6]. 
V.  PREVENTING  BLACK SWAN SITUATIONS 
Emotet, WannaCry and similar trojan and worm-based 
malware exploits can be prevented, and/or their effects 
limited by applying basic cyber defence maintenance 
practices, maintaining situational awareness, and monitoring 
and responding when a threat is identified, or suspected.  
A. Applying 
basic 
cyber 
defence 
maintenance 
practices 
1. Address the weakest link. Educate all people in the 
organisation on the risks and indicators of cyber 
exploits, such as emails with links and attachments. 
Educate people to not click on links or unpreviewed 
attachments and to run their mouse over to see where 
it links to, even if the email comes from a trusted 
colleague or friend. Educate them to not click on 
online advertisements, and to never share unencrypted 
sensitive information through external email or on the 
phone [6][8]. 
2. Incorporate desired cyber practices into policies. 
For example, implement a policy requiring users to 
forward suspicious emails to the security team [6]. 
3. Control and monitor who has access to what, when. 
Implement Privileged Access Management based on 
the principle of least privilege [8]. 
4. Keep all operating system and application patching 
up-to-date, by applying tested patches and updates as 
a priority. In particular, test and apply critical patches 
immediately. Five weeks prior to the main WannaCry 
attack, both the Australian Signals Directorate [4] and 
Microsoft had issued updated CVE reports. Microsoft 
released emergency patches to the Windows SMB 
vulnerabilities that enabled WannaCry’s EternalBlue 
and DoublePulsar exploits recommending updates be 
applied immediately [7][8][34].  
5. Regularly perform vulnerability scans to identify any 
unpatched devices [8][45]. 
6. Set a Firewall rule to restrict inbound SMB 
communication 
between 
client 
systems, 
using 
Windows Group Policy Object, or if using a non-
windows host-based intrusion prevention system 
(HIPS), implement custom modifications for the 
control of client-to-client SMB communication [6].  
7. Using antivirus programs on clients and servers, with 
automatic updates of signatures and software will 
mitigate against many other malware exploits that are 
signature based [6][8]. 

28
International Journal on Advances in Security, vol 16 no 1 & 2, year 2023, http://www.iariajournals.org/security/
2023, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
8. Whitelist IP addresses and block suspicious and 
known malicious IP addresses at the firewall. Filter 
out emails with known malspam indicators, such as 
known malicious subject lines, by implementing 
filters at the email gateway [6][8]. 
9. Block or scan file attachments commonly associated 
with malware, such as .dll and .exe and those that 
include macros, as well as attachments that cannot be 
scanned by antivirus software, such as .zip files 
[6][8]. 
10. Disable macros and PowerShell to prevent macro 
driven PowerShell commands, such as those utilised 
by Emotet [6][8]. 
11. Implement Domain-Based Message Authentication, 
Reporting & Conformance (DMARC), a validation 
system that minimises spam emails by detecting email 
spoofing using Domain Name System (DNS) records 
and digital signatures [6]. 
12. Be prepared for the worst. Take daily backups for 
timely recovery and restoration of service to the 
business and its customers. Ensure these are stored 
offline or on a separate network and restoration is 
tested regularly to prevent failure when restoration is 
really needed [2][3][6][8]. 
13. Limit exposure of critical systems to zero-day 
exploits. Take vulnerable, critical systems off-line 
and/or restrict their external accessibility when a zero-
day exploit is underway. 
14. Apply emergency zero-day patches immediately. 
During the WannaCry event, Microsoft released 
emergency patches for out-of-support versions of MS 
Windows such as XP and Server 2003 [18] 
[38][46][49]. 
B. Maintaining situational awareness 
Security teams need to be tasked with staying abreast 
of the current and emerging threats, the vulnerability-state 
of the organisation’s systems and people, the effectiveness 
of existing controls, and availability of updated controls to 
address emerging vulnerabilities. The Cyber Security 
Strategy, based on robust risk management, needs to be 
maintained in-line with the evolving environment. Ongoing 
communication to key stakeholders is critical to ensure 
organisational support and resourcing.   
C. Responding proactively to emerging threats and 
exploits 
Historically, Australia has faced the global-scale cyber 
attacks after Europe and North America. This has provided 
a short window in which to act, and mitigate known 
vulnerabilities. On Sunday 14th of May, Australian 
organisations had a few hours during which to ensure 
critical windows-based systems were patched or segregated 
to protect themselves from the ensuring WannaCry attack, 
prior to business opening on the Monday morning.  
As cyber exploits are combined in new and crafty 
ways, the ingeniousness of the response needs to match that 
of the adversaries. 
VI.  MANAGING AN INFECTION 
Priority response actions are needed to minimise the 
impact of these cyber Black Swan situations, for 
organisations that become infected.  
A. Managing an Emotet infection. 
Emotet progresses with credential extraction, captures 
the user’s credentials on all accounts and systems, and 
spreads across the network prior to issuing a ransomware 
demand that makes the user eventually aware of the 
infection. By this time Emotet is embedded throughout the 
network. Immediate action is required to: 
1. Contain the infection, to prevent it spreading across 
the network. Identify, shutdown, and take the 
infected machines off the network. Don’t use 
domain or shared local administrator accounts to 
log into infected systems [5]. 
2. It may be necessary to temporarily take the 
network offline [5]. 
3. Remove the Emotet malware from infected devices 
by reimaging these devices, and ensure the 
windows patches provided by Microsoft have been 
applied [5][32][33][36][38]. 
4. Apply backups. 
5. Prevent re-infection. Scan the reimaged and clean 
systems and move these to a segregated virtual 
local area, away from the infected network [5]. 
6. Issue password resets for all affected credential 
groups, including password vaults [5]. 
7. Identify the original source of the infection. ie. The 
device that was first infected [5]. 
8. Review the log files for this user’s account to 
ensure any auto-forward rules for emails are turned 
off, and prevent further data breaches [5]. 
9. Use the clean systems to return to normal business 
operations. 
10. Continue 
to 
monitor 
for 
any 
unidentified 
infections, affected systems, and users. 
11. Document the incident report. 
12. Communicate with senior stakeholders, employees 
and customers, throughout. Sensitive customer

information may have been exfiltrated during the 
infected period. Communicate to impacted entities 
and regulatory bodies in line with company policy 
and regulatory requirements. 
13. To prevent re-infections: Review the operating 
system maintenance and patching processes; and 
Educate users to not click on phishing email links. 
14. If not already in place, implement targeted 
educational phishing campaigns. 
15. Post Incident Review to assess protection, 
response, and restoration effectiveness and identify 
improvements. 
16. Communicate findings, and action improvements. 
17. Post 
Implementation 
Review 
the 
system 
maintenance processes, and measure the click rate 
in the organisation 3 & 6 months later to ensure the 
required changes have been made and the desired 
click rated achieved. 
18. Implement further improvements, if required. 
B. Managing a WannaCry infection. 
Those infected with WannaCry malware were 
immediately made aware by the ransomware messages, 
and the loss of data availability due to WannaCry 
encrypting all the word, excel, pdf etc. files [6][21]. 
Immediate action was required to: 
1. Contain the infection, to prevent it spreading across 
the 
network 
and 
prevent 
re-infection, 
by 
identifying 
unpatched 
devices 
applying 
the 
Windows 
patches 
provided 
by 
Microsoft 
[32][33][39][40].  
2. Implement regular vulnerability scanning to 
identify 
unpatched 
devices 
[45]. 
Targeted 
vulnerability scanners that focus on finding the 
specific Windows vulnerabilities that enabled 
WannaCry, are now also available [59]. 
3. Recover the encrypted files from backups. At the 
time of the original WannaCry attack, the only way 
to recover lost or encrypted files, was to restore 
from backup. Since then, WannaCry decryptors 
have been developed [60]. 
4. Return to normal business operations. 
5. Continue to monitor for any unidentified infections 
and affected files. 
6. Document the incident report. 
7. Communicate with senior stakeholders, employees, 
and customers, throughout. Communicate to 
regulatory bodies in line with company policy and 
regulatory requirements. 
8. Review the operating system maintenance and 
patching processes to prevent similar infections.  
9. Post Incident Review to assess protection, 
response, and restoration effectiveness and identify 
improvements. 
10. Communicate findings, and action improvements. 
11. Post Implementation Review these processes 3 & 6 
months later to ensure the required changes have 
been made. 
12. Implement further improvements, if required. 
VII.  FROM SURVIVE TO THRIVE 
The practices of situational awareness, proactive risk 
management, systems’ maintenance, and priority response 
to threats and infections are the fundamentals of good cyber 
and systems’ management practices. When performed 
consistently over time, these practices provide a solid 
foundation for robust security and business resilience. 
Significantly reducing the likelihood that the organization 
will be heavily impacted by a cyber attack. But routine 
procedures are designed to operate within known thresholds. 
When unexpected and unknown events exceed these 
thresholds, such as those experienced in cyber black swan 
situations, these alone cannot necessarily be relied upon to 
perform optimally. These situations require more flexible 
response [47].  
Fragility relates to how systems are negatively impacted 
when the environmental volatility exceeds a threshold [52]. 
Organisational risk management is typically based on 
known historical events. The thresholds of the risk 
management are defined by these past events. By definition, 
black swan events are unexpected, and lie outside the 
threshold [51][52]. 
The process of evolution through natural selection 
produced the Australian platypus and kangaroos. Evolution 
is, at its core, an example of antifragility [56]. Only 
organisms that are adaptable to the changing environmental 
conditions and variables survive, thrive, and proliferate. 
Those that are only robust within stable environments do 
not survive when this environment changes rapidly or 
unexpectedly. 
Paradoxically, cyber antifragility is built on a foundation 
of structure, standardisation, and good cyber and systems 
practices, combined with behavioural adaptability to volatile 
situations to take advantage of opportunities emerging from 
the disruption [56].  
Going beyond security and resilience to antifragility 
moves the focus from surviving to thriving in the face of 
adversity. The critical attribute displayed by antifragile 
organisations is their ability to modify goals and behaviours 
when in crisis. This requires flexible thinking, problem 
solving, and in the case of cyber black swan situations, 
ability to utilise technology to obtain and interpret 
information in real time [56]. Leaders, and teams need to be 
able to adjust their ways of working and coordinate 

30

differently; To adjust their performance strategies, and adapt 
to the new situation [47].  
Antifragile organisations turn crises into opportunity by 
rapidly modifying their business model and organisational 
behaviours to take advantage of the situation. This requires 
foresight, a hunger for new opportunities, agility to rethink 
and change the way they work, ongoing research to 
determine how this can be achieved, and capital investment 
to enable it [56].  
Cyber antifragility is more than just defence or 
resilience as it necessitates both stability and growth in the 
face of adversity, of any scale. Rather than just recovering 
to the pre-event state, after the incident, antifragile 
organisations improve as a result of being regularly 
challenged by new cyber events and situation [56].   
VIII.  CONCLUSION 
Analysis of the Black Swan Situations generated by 
the Emotet and WannaCry malicious exploits highlight the 
ways in which these types of situations can be predicted and 
prevented.  
Situational awareness enables organisations to notice 
and interpret the early warning signs; to stay abreast of and 
prepare for emerging vulnerabilities and threats. Preparation 
involves addressing the weakest link as well as 
implementing practical controls, such as privileged access 
management, maintaining defence in depth, and keeping 
reliable backups.  
Awareness 
of 
its 
cyber 
capability 
and 
open 
vulnerabilities also ensures the organisation can respond to 
zero-day exploits by limiting exposure of critical systems 
and immediately applying emergency patches to vulnerable 
systems. Priority protection and response action when an 
infection is detected limits the extent of the infection, its 
effects, and the impact on the business and customers. These 
are the fundamentals of good systems and cyber 
management practice, providing security and resilience. 
Antifragile organisations take this to the next level by 
developing the agility to adapt in the face of adversity, to 
take advantage of the situation. While others survive, these 
organisations thrive, benefiting from the constantly 
changing threat landscape and the cyber black swans.
