INTRODUCTION
Network science has emerged and been utilized as one of
the important frameworks when each researcher studies
complex systems [1-4]. An important property of networks is
the
existence
of
modules
or
communities,
and
the
communicability between a pair of nodes in a network is
concerned with the shortest path connecting both nodes.
Estrada et. al. [5] proposed a generalization of the
communicability by elucidating both for the shortest
paths communicating between two nodes and for all the
other walks travelling between two distances. The
communicability
detection
allows
one
to
determine
potentially the unaware and hidden relationships between
nodes and also allows one to reduce a large complex network
into smaller and smaller groups. Presently, the community
detection within networks is an open subject of great interest.
Complex
networks
are
also
ubiquitous
in
many
biological, ecological, technological, informational, and
infrastructural systems [6–12]. It is clear that the atomic,
oscillating,
and
social
systems
display
network-like
structures using the tools of statistical mechanics. These
methods and techniques were contributed to shed light on
the structure and dynamics of social, economic, biological,
technological, and medical systems [13-15]. It is actually
recognized that the analogy functions that describe the
properties depend mainly on the structural properties of the
system in networks as well.
In this paper, we study the community structure of the
Korean meteorological society in the author network. The
data we used are the published papers of 676 authors from
the Korean meteorological society publications in the author
network, from March 2008 to November 2013. We simulate
and analyze four other kinds of averaged communicability.

COMMUNICABILITY IN NETWORKS
We
mainly
consider
the
theoretical
methods
of
microscopic communicability in networks. First of all, let us
introduce the concept of communicability in networks by
describing a community structure. The communicability
structure can invoke the concept of walks in networks. A
walk of length k is a sequence of nodes n0, n1, . . . , nk−1, nk
such there is a link from ni−1 to ni for each i = 1, 2, . . . , k
[16]. Using the concept of walk we can define the
communicability between two nodes. The communicability
function [4] is represented in terms of
0
(
)
k
pq
k

G
c
A

.
Here, A is the adjacency matrix, which has unity if the nodes
p and q are linked to each other, but has zero otherwise. The
adjacency matrix (Ak)pq gives the number of walks of length
k starting at the node p and ending at the node q [17,18].
The two novel communicability functions are calculated as

where eA is a matrix function that can be defined using the
following Taylor series [19]. The communicability function
Gpq is obtained by using the weighted adjacency matrix W =
(Wij)n×n . Centrality measures were originally introduced in
social sciences [20,21] and are now widely used in the
whole field of complex network analysis [9]. We can derive
the communicability function as

with the identification α = 1/K.
From the fact that the Laplacian matrix of a connected
network has a nondegenerate zero eigenvalue, we can

In a network of quantum oscillators, we start by
considering the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the
Hamiltonian HA. After arranging several equations, we can
see that

Note that when the temperature tends to infinity or β → 0, 
there is absolutely no communicability between any pair of
nodes. That is,
(

the temperature tends to zero or β → ∞, then there is an 
infinite communicability between every pair of nodes, i.e.,

function is represented in terms of

Consequently, the communicability functions

classical harmonic oscillators in networks of the community
structure.
The

also become the types of the thermal Green’s

NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS AND RESULTS
In order to
simulate and
analyze
the averaged
communicability functions, the data are the published
papers for 676 authors of the Korean meteorological society
publications in the author network from March 2008 to
November 2013. We assume that it only takes an equally
contributed weight between all authors in one published
paper.
We implement the computer-simulation of the four
communicability functions. Figure 1 shows the color-map
diagram of the communicability function matrices as
RA
Gp
,

,
EA

, and
EL
Gp
for 676 authors of the Korean
meteorological society publications, among four averaged
communicability functions [28]. If two members are highly
correlated, the representation approaches the color red. If
they are weakly correlated, the representation approaches
dark blue.
We
can
simulate
four
averaged
communicability
functions constituting a number of published papers for 676
members of the author network. The weight of community
means the value (that is, 1/the number of authors) that all
authors are bestowed the same weight upon one published
paper. Then, we assume that the weight of community and
the weight of published papers for the 1-st author is one for
the 1-st author. We now speculate that the phase transition
among these functions may exist near 200-th authors. In
next time, we will aim to find it through networks of other
societies.
Table 1 summarizes the values of the averaged
communicability functions, the weight of community, and a
number of published papers for 100-th, 300-th, and 600-th
authors, respectively. These values are normalized values
divided by the maximum value of each factors. For the
value of
EA
Gp
between two authors, the 600-th author
approaches to zero. We find that the
EL
Gp
relatively
correlates highly when this value is compared to other ones.

CONCLUSIONS
We have studied the community structure of Korean
meteorology fields in the 676 author networks of all Korean
meteorological society publications from March 2008 to
November 2013. We mainly implemented the computer-
simulation of the four communicability functions.
To compare the four averaged communicability functions,
it was shown that the
EL
Gp
constructs a stronger community
structure rather than the other three. The function
EA
Gp
finds
the community structure weaker than the other three as well.
We can make use of the four averaged communicability
functions
to
compute
the
measures
of a
community
structure, and it is hoped that our method and technique will
lead us to more general results in the future.
It is not trustworthy now, but we anticipate that the phase
transition among the averaged communicability functions
may exist at one value near 200-th authors. Our results
cannot yet be compared to that of other social networks, but
we hope to compare to our results to other successful results
in social networks that have been prominently produced and
published. Next time, we hope to discuss the phase transition
of the averaged communicability functions, with network
systems of other societies. In the future, we will apply the
community structure to the cases of different contributed
weight between authors. Therefore, further work is needed
for the case with societies of more than the author and
citation networks. The formalism of our analysis can be
extended to both the discrimination and the characterization
of communicability functions in other various societies.
