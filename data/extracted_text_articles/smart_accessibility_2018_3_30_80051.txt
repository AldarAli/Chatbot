Abstract— Depression has been identified as a leading cause of 
frailty worldwide. Factors which contribute to an effective 
implementation of Telehealth/eHealth among seniors living 
with depressive symptoms remain understudied. Research has 
linked technology-geared mental health care delivery to better 
healthcare outcomes. Rigorous scientific evidence on the 
efficacy of ehealth technology, for example smartphone 
applications, is lacking. The solution tested in this study was a 
web-based 
Telemedicine 
and 
Client-Reported 
Outcome 
Measurement platform, using a Chromebook device. Applying 
a mixed method design, this pilot study generated valuable 
insights regarding factors which facilitate positive experiences 
for seniors participating in an eHealth intervention. Further 
research studies on the implementation of the platform with 
seniors appears to be feasible since the present study was able 
to successfully recruit 30 client participants and retain 87% 
until the end of study. Results related to participants’ 
perceptions of the smart technology suggest device features 
need modification to facilitate older adults’ comfort with the 
platform.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION   
Depression is considered the single largest contributor to 
global disability [1], highly prevalent among older adults, 65 
years old and over [2][3], and linked to poor health 
outcomes, including reduced quality of life, comorbidity, and 
increased frailty [4]. Studies suggest that health care 
interventions 
delivered 
through 
Telehealth/eHealth 
technology may potentially improve health outcomes among 
seniors with depressive symptoms [5][6], and reduce hospital 
emergency and rates of admissions among seniors [7]. 
 The improvement of health outcomes attributable to 
technology-geared mental health care delivery has been 
inconsistent across studies. Aburizik et al. [8] found that 
mobile psychotherapy sessions had a non-significant effect 
on chronic disease self-management and health-related 
quality of life. Piette et al. [9] found that the use of 
interactive voice response to maximize mobile health 
monitoring made no difference in improving health status, 
medication adherence, and days in bed. Pecina et al. [10], in 
a web-based intervention study of 205 American patients 
with comorbid medical and mental health disorders 
involving depression, found no significant effect on reported 
physical and mental status. Donker et al. [11], in a recent 
systematic review of eight smartphone studies for mental 
health care delivery, found that none demonstrated rigorous 
scientific 
evidence 
on 
the 
efficacy 
of 
smartphone 
applications. The scarcity of evidence on the efficacy of 
eHealth may be partially due to the fact that the majority of 
research on the use of mobile health technology has solely 
investigated the pre-implementation phase [12].       
The TELEPROM-G pilot-study tested the feasibility for 
implementation of a Collaborative Health Record (CHR), a 
web-based platform designed for outcome-based health 
services delivery.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
outlines aims of the study. Section III discusses 
methodology. Results and discussion of results are presented 
in Section IV and Section V respectively. Section VI 
provides conclusions from the study and suggestions for 
future research. 
II. 
AIMS OF THE STUDY  
The primary aims of study were to: (1) examine the 
feasibility of implementing and evaluating the CHR platform 
in the older adult population; and 2) determine if further 
modifications to the CHR platform or deployment would be 
necessary. This study was guided by the following research 
questions: (1) what is the rate of participant recruitment from 
outpatient mental health programs? (2) what are the 
participants’ perceptions of the CHR platform? (3) what is 
the estimated effect size for the impact of the CHR platform 
on community integration, quality of life, and other health 
indicators of senior participants?

III. 
METHODOLOGY 
A. Participants 
Eight Health Care Providers (HCPs) identified thirty of 
their clients who met the criteria for inclusion into the study: 
being diagnosed or self-diagnosed with depression, aged 65 
years or older, living in the community, and willing to give 
informed consent to participate.  Exclusion criteria consisted 
of having significant cognitive deficits, as determined by a 
Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) [13] score of 19 or 
less, and scoring less than 5 on the Geriatric Depression 
Scale (GDS) [14]. A member of the research team recruited 
client participants who met inclusion criteria by obtaining 
their voluntary, informed consent.  
B. Procedures 
The study used a mixed method design to collect 
quantitative interview data prior to the study’s intervention 
and at six months after the initial interview. This paper 
reports on quantitative results from individual client 
interviews. A structured interview was conducted upon 
enrollment with each participant.  At the end of the interview 
each participant received a Wi-Fi enabled Chromebook 
device. 
Participants were trained on how to use the Chromebook 
device and the web-based Collaborative Health Record 
(CHR) created by InputHealth, a Canadian digital health 
company. The CHR platform allowed for both synchronous 
and asynchronous communication between patients and care 
providers. 
This 
included 
receiving 
and 
completing 
questionnaires such as personal health information and self-
assessments, a comprehensive mobile client record, and the 
opportunity for secure HCP-client communication such as 
face-to-face video sessions (virtual visits).  
 The research team ensured CHR platform user accounts 
and passwords were created for both HCP and client 
participants, that HCP participants were capable of sending 
invitations for virtual visits, and that all appropriate 
questionnaires were added to the CHR platform.  Likewise, 
the research team ensured that client participants understood 
how to complete questionnaires and respond to virtual visit 
requests.   
 Quantitative data, consisting of baseline and final 
interviews, were conducted utilizing eight measures to assess 
demographics, community integration, depressive symptoms, 
suicidal ideation, quality of life, physical health, utilization 
of emergency services, and perceptions of smart technology. 
The demographics form that was used covered basic 
items, such as age, gender, ethno-racial identity, indigenous 
status, and marital status. It also included questions assessing 
the presence of chronic physical illnesses and psychiatric 
illnesses, including symptoms of mental illness, types of 
psychiatric diagnoses, and total number of psychiatric 
admissions, as well as age at first contact with the mental 
health system, and age at first psychiatric admission. A 
Likert Scale measured participants comfort with various 
technologies and related tasks (using computers, tablets, 
smartphones, technology in general, Internet browsing, 
sending/receiving email, sending/receiving text messages, 
and using social media, etc.).  
 Community 
integration 
was 
measured 
via 
the 
Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) [15]. The CIQ 
consists of 15 questions and is intended as a brief, reliable, 
objective measure of a person’s level of integration in the 
home and community. The overall score can range from 0 to 
29, with a higher score indicating better integration. The CIQ 
can be divided into three subscales corresponding to home 
integration, social integration, and productivity [16]. The 
CIQ is based heavily on types of activities (e.g.., shopping, 
cooking), and assumes independent participation is a sign of 
greater integration than supported or mutual co-participation.    
Depressive symptoms were measured using the short 
version of the GDS [14][17]. The GDS has been tested and 
used extensively with the older population in a variety of 
settings including the community and acute and long-term 
care settings. The overall score ranges from 0 to 15, with 
higher scores indicating higher levels of depression. Scores 
above 8 are indicative of major depression; while anything 
less indicates subclinical depressive symptoms [14].  
 The Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale (GSIS) [18] was 
used to measure suicide ideation. The GSIS is a 31 question 
scale with scores ranging from 31 (low/no suicide ideation) 
to 165 (high level of suicide ideation). Total scores can be 
divided into 4 subscales: suicide ideation, death ideation, loss 
of personal and social worth, and perceived meaning in life. 
The GSIS has shown good internal consistency (total score a 
= 0.93, subscales a = 0.82 to 0.84) and good construct and 
criterion validity when measured against other validated 
instruments for depression, hopelessness, life-satisfaction, 
and psychological well-being [18].  
The Health, Social, Justice Service Use (HSJSU) 
questionnaire [19] was utilized to assess the number of 
emergency room visits, phone calls to crisis lines, visits by 
crisis teams, and ambulance trips made in the preceding six 
months.  
Quality of life was measured via the Quality of Life Brief 
Version (QoL-BV) [20], [21]. The QoL-BV measures both 
objective quality of life (i.e., what people do and experience) 
and subjective quality of life (i.e., what people feel about 
these experiences). Consisting of 74 items, this tool spans 
eight domains: living situation, daily activities and 
functioning, family relations, social relations, finances, 
work/school, legal/safety issues, and health. Internal 
consistency for people with mental illness ranges from α = 
0.56 to 0.87 [21].  
Physical health was measured in the demographics form 
and by the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) [22].  The SF-
12 measures health on eight domains: general health, 
physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, 
bodily pain, energy/vitality, social functioning, role 
limitations due to emotional health, and mental health.   
The Perception of Smart Technology Form [23] was used 
to measure several domains of participants’ experience with 
the CHR platform. These domains include level of 
helpfulness, ease of use, and clarity, in addition to 
information on the frequency of CHR platform use and 
functionality preferences.

IV. 
RESULTS  
Descriptive statistics and mean comparisons using paired 
sample t-tests were conducted for each of the outcome 
measures between time-one and two interviews. These 
comparisons excluded participants who did not complete the 
measure during time-two. 
A.  Characteristics of client participants 
Participants had a mean age of 72.8 (SD = 4.8) and 
ranged from 65 to 84 years of age. The sample consisted of 
12 (40%) males and 18 (60%) females, all of whom had 
contact with their family and were unemployed/retired.  
Education level of the participants varied, with three (10%) 
participants having completed grade school education, 14 
(46.7%) having completed high school education, and 13 
(43.3%) having completed post-secondary education. Sixteen 
(53.3 %) participants indicated that they lived alone, and 14 
(46.7%) indicated that they lived with family. The top two 
psychiatric conditions in the sample were anxiety disorders 
(n = 17) and mood disorders (n = 27), with 20 (66.7%) 
participants having two or more psychiatric conditions (Fig 
1). Regarding comorbid physical and psychiatric conditions, 
over 90% of participants had comorbidities, such as arthritis 
(33.3%), high blood pressure (33.3%), and anxiety disorders 
(56.7%). All participants were taking medication for their 
mental illness, and half of the participants stated that they 
had had a psychiatric hospitalization in their lifetime. At 
study onset, 2/3 of participants had existing Wi-Fi set up, 12 
(40%) participants reported feeling extremely comfortable 
with technology, whereas no participants reported feeling 
extremely comfortable with technology at study end.

B. Retention and attrition rates  
Twenty six (87%) of the client participants completed the 
study. Four (13%) participants withdrew from the study 
before the second interview; one participant withdrew from 
the study shortly after enrolment for an unknown reason and 
three others withdrew later due to health reasons. As such, 
for time-two interviews there were 12 (46%) male 
participants and 14 (54%) female participants, with a mean 
age of 72.85 (SD = 4.46).  On the HSJSU questionnaire, all 
participants who withdrew indicated that they had not talked 
to a health or social service provider over the phone in the 
past month. These participants had all experienced side 
effects from medication, but had not terminated their usage 
of the medication(s). They also obtained higher mean scores 
on the SF-12 pain subscale (M = 81.25, SD = 37.5) 
compared to the other participants (M = 49.04, SD = 31.21) 
but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 
0.071). Overall, these participants did not differ significantly 
from the other 26 participants on any measures during the 
interview at time-one.  
C. Analysis of outcome measures 
This pilot study tested the implementation of CHR 
platform and recruited 30 client participants. Therefore, 
statistically significant results of outcomes were not 
primarily pursued. Paired samples t-tests were utilized to 
compare CIQ total scores, GDS total scores, and GSIS total 
scores, and QoL-BV domain scores between time-one and 
time-two (see Table 1 for total score comparisons). As 
anticipated, no significant differences were found among any 
of the subscale domains or total scores of outcome measures 
between interviews.  The mean difference on CIQ was 0.72 
(t (17) = 0.80, p = 0.44); GSIS total scores 3.12 (t (24) = 
0.67, p = 0.50); GDS total scores 0.33 (t (23) = 0.59, p = 
0.56); whereas the mean differences on the QoL-BV domain 
scores ranged between -396.12 (t (25) = -0.45, p = 0.65) and 
0.15 (t (25) = 1.2, p = 0.24).  Paired samples t-tests were also 
employed for the HSJSU. A significant higher proportion of 
participants reported experiencing prescription medication 
side effects during interview time-one than interview time-
two (t (22) = 2.31, p < 0.05). Finally, physical and mental 
health information from the eight domains on the SF-12 was 
compared utilizing paired samples t-tests. The analysis found 
no significant differences between mean scores on any of 
these domains between times one and two.

D. Perceptions of smart technology at time-two interview 
analysis of outcome measures 
    The Perception of Smart Technology Form was 
administered at the final interview to assess client 
participants’ perceptions of the CHR platform, and the 
Chromebook device. On a scale ranging from one to seven, 
client participants found the CHR platform helpful [M (SD) 
= 5.10 (1.61)], enjoyable [M (SD) = 4.67 (1.59)], and fast to 
use [M (SD) = 4.62 (1.69)] (see Table 2). However, 
participants had mixed responses in terms of ease of use, 
with some reporting that the program was relatively easy to 
use [M (SD) = 4.43 (2.09)] while others rating it lower on 
simplicity to use [M (SD) = 3.90 (1.73)] (see Table 2). 
Participants also had mixed responses regarding the 
reliability of the tablet [M (SD) = 4.29 (1.60)], and regarding 
whether the tablet and program gave them more or less 
independence [M (SD) = 3.56 (1.69)] (see Table 3).

On a section of the Perceptions of Smart Technology 
Form, participants were asked specific questions related to 
their use of the Chromebook device.  In terms of how they 
felt about connecting with their health care providers, on 
average, they indicated that they felt mostly satisfied. 
Participants reported liking the communication abilities, 
personal usage and accessibility of the tablet. However, 
participants reported not liking the technical difficulties, 
small size and potential scams associated with using the 
tablet. Roughly one-third of participants (n = 9) felt that the 
tablet and CHR platform had improved their healthcare.

DISCUSSION 
The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the 
feasibility of implementing and evaluating the CHR platform 
among seniors living with depressive symptoms and to 
determine possible modifications to the CHR platform, 
through assessment of client perceptions of smart technology 
at six months of intervention.  Regarding the feasibility of 
implementing and evaluating the CHR platform in the older 
adult population, the study was able to recruit 30 client 
participants; of which, 26 (86.67%) successfully completed 
the study. Recruiting and retaining such rates of participants 
until the end of the study indicates that the implementation of 
CHR platform is feasible among seniors with depressive 
symptoms. These results, related to recruitment and retention 
of seniors, contrast with the recruitment difficulties 
experienced in a RCT pilot study [6], wherein the authors 
had difficulties recruiting participants aged 60 years and 
over.  The study also evaluated potential modifications to the 
current CHR platform through feedback provided by the 
Perceptions of Smart Technology Form. Perceptions of client 
participants regarding the tablet device were mainly positive. 
On a scale of one to seven, participants rated the simplicity 
of the device as 3.20 and helpfulness as 4.92. Viewing the 
results of technology questions in the Perception of Smart 
Technology Form and the Demographic Data Form, it is 
noticeable that scores were mainly positive among seniors 
who had previous experience of Internet use, higher 
education, and who were younger in age and living with a 
relative. Wildenbos et al. [24] found similar results in a study 
which examined barriers and enablers of the use of 
Telehealth for seniors. These authors indicated that factors 
enabling seniors to use technology include higher levels of 
education, receiving help from others to use the Internet, 
being aged less than 70 years old, and comfort with using the 
Internet.   An improvement to increase seniors’ comfort with 
the CHR platform might include being able to connect with 
clients’ phones as well as tablets; a process that would 
require further development to overcome limitations posed 
by the current system due to its compatibility with only the 
Chrome browser. Furthermore, increased communication 
functions might enhance the delivery of mental health 
services among community-residing seniors, reducing crises 
and supporting community integration.  
Consistent with results from previous studies [9][10], this 
pilot study found no significant effect on health outcome 
measures, including community integration, depression, and 
quality of life, along with social, health and justice service 
utilization variables. However, the study found significantly 
higher rates of participants who experienced lower 
prescription medication side effects during interview time-
two than interview time-one.   
A. Limitations  
The study investigated eHealth technology with seniors 
experiencing depressive symptoms. While the pilot study 
successfully recruited the target number of client participants 
and retained 87% until completion of the study, there are a 
number of limitations. The small sample size may reduce the 
study power to detect the effect of the intervention on health 
48

outcome measures. The fact that the study had no control 
group and had a limited length of intervention implies that 
caution should be used in interpreting the results. Therefore, 
a larger sample size of participants would be needed to 
determine the long-term implications of using eHealth 
technology to connect with seniors with depression living in 
the community.   
B. Implications  
Results from the TELEPROM-G study have implications 
for practice and future research. The study demonstrated 
potential modifications to the current CHR platform through 
feedback provided through the Perceptions of Smart 
Technology Form.  To this end, senior participants indicated 
that they are more likely to have positive experience when 
eHealth devices are perceived as simple and helpful.  
Furthermore, 
the 
study 
illustrated 
demographic 
characteristics to consider for improving the uptake of 
eHealth 
among 
seniors 
with 
depressive 
symptoms.  
Characteristics such as having a previous experience of 
Internet use, higher education, being younger in age, and 
living with a relative were associated with the senior 
participants’ positive perceptions of technology.  The pilot 
study, having successfully recruited 30 client participants, 
retained 26 of them for a six-month follow-up, deployed the 
intervention, and finding 2/3 of participants with existing 
Wi-Fi set up, has demonstrated that future studies with this 
population are feasible.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This pilot study highlighted the benefits of supporting 
community integration and reducing health crises and needs 
and now requires further investigation with a full study. 
Senior clients experiencing depressive symptoms were 
provided with a Chromebook device and access to the CHR 
platform, an application that allowed for enhanced 
communication with their HCP. The study explored the 
potential outcomes on physical and mental health as well as 
the participants’ perspectives of the CHR platform and the 
use of a Chromebook device. Although there were no 
significant changes on a number of physical and mental 
health outcome measures, the study’s findings illustrated that 
the use of the CHR platform was helpful, enjoyable and 
relatively easy to use. In addition, significantly fewer clients 
reported medication side-effects at six month post-baseline.  
However, clients suggested that the Chromebook was too 
small and had encountered technical difficulties with it, 
suggesting that an alternative, perhaps more familiar, piece 
of equipment such as a phone or desktop computer may be 
preferable. The implementation of tele-mental health using 
the CHR platform is feasible as this study was able to recruit 
30 older adults and retain 87% until the completion of the 
study. It is recommended that future studies investigate the 
use of eHealth technologies with a larger sample of seniors 
experiencing depressive symptoms and using different 
platforms and personal electronic devices. A research design 
that includes a control group, such as a randomized 
controlled trial, would be ideal in investigating eHealth 
technologies further.
