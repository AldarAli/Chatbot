Abstract—Hospitals are large public buildings that have a 
significant impact on the environment because they use large 
amounts of energy and water and produce large amounts of 
waste. For these reasons, hospitals are natural candidates for 
sustainable design.  The design of heating ventilation and air 
conditioning (HVAC) plants for large hospitals must aim to 
some top priority objectives: improve their energy efficiency, 
forecast the use of clean innovative technologies of self 
production of energy, reduce both the operating costs of 
HVAC plants and polluting impacts on environment, 
guarantee the continuity of energy supply from every case of 
critical states and black-out of electrical energy or natural gas. 
In the context of cooling/heating efficient energy, we illustrate 
the benefits obtained by means the use of a system of 
“Combined Cooling Heating and Power” for the San Marco 
Catania’s Hospital. This paper shows in what way is 
guaranteed the continuity of energy supply for any possible 
critical state, the economic gain through the auto-production of 
energy that reduces of about 1.000 M€ the operating cost of 
HVAC plants, the environmental benefits due to the reduction 
of about 25 Mtons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 Hospitals are large public buildings that have a 
significant impact on the environment and economy of the 
surrounding community. They use large amounts of energy 
and water and produce large amounts of wastes so they are 
natural candidates for sustainable design. In today’s 
expanding energy hungry world, sustainability is no longer 
an option, it has become the design standard for design 
professionals. 
The Combined Cooling Heat and Power (CCHP) plant 
provide cooling alongside heat and power from the same 
energy source into a ‘tri-generation’ scheme.  
CCHP plants have a higher efficiency than systems that 
producing only heating or power because CCHP system 
uses waste heat from electricity generation to produce steam 
for heating and cooling. Fig. 1 shows a typical scheme of 
CCHP plant. 
The performance of CCHP systems has been studied 
before [1][2][3]. The CCHP plants are particularly useful for 
buildings, like hospitals, that have large amounts of air 
conditioning needs.  
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Typical CCHP system  
Because CCHP uses waste heat to produce thermal 
energy for heating and cooling, hospitals equipped with 
CCHP systems are more energetically efficient.  
Hospitals are ideal candidates for CCHP systems 
because they work 365 days for year and require round the 
clock energy. In the world, the number of hospitals using 
CCHP systems has grown steadily in recent years. 
Combined systems enable hospitals to reduce energy costs, 
increase reliability on energy availability and improve 
environmental performance.  
With less fuel consumed, greenhouse gases (GHG) and 
air pollutants (nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides) are 
reduced [4]. Resources saved could be redirected to improve 
patient care [5]. Moreover, hospitals must perform critical, 
life-saving functions even when a widespread disaster 
interrupts their supply of natural gas and electricity from the 
utility grid. CCHP systems can be designed to maintain 
critical life-support systems, operate independently of the 
grid during emergencies and be capable of black start (the 
ability to come online without relying on external energy 
sources). Blackout of electrical national grid or further 
possible negative happenings (terrorist outrages, oil crisis 
caused by war events in oil producing countries, and so on) 
directs people efforts to have more sources of energy 
supplying and reach the maximum possible of energetic 
independence of the hospital. Because of they are already up 
and running, CCHP systems can offer a seamless, reliable 
power alternative than traditional emergency generators.  
The CCHP systems, however, are not automatically 
configured for backup capability; hospitals must ensure that

the systems have automatic transfer capability and that the 
energy output can be matched with energy demand.  
The CCHP systems are not always advantageous for all 
typologies of hospitals: their cost-effectiveness needs to be 
evaluated on a case by case basis. In determining a CCHP 
system’s 
viability, 
there 
are 
several 
important 
considerations: interconnection agreements, site issues, and 
permits all should be discussed with the partnering utility. 
Local and national incentives including direct financial 
grants, tax incentives, and low interest loans should be 
determined. The type of driving unit and cooling device 
distinguish different kinds of CCHP systems. A CCHP 
driving unit module can be a steam turbine, a gas turbine, a 
reciprocating engine, or a fuel cell. A turbo or absorption 
chiller generally produces the cooling energy from a CCHP 
system, the choice depends on the required output power 
and operating regime [6]. 
Designers must choose equipment that best fits the 
hospital’s thermal and electrical loads and power quality 
requirements. The CCHP systems often can be installed for 
less cost upfront than renewable energy options such as 
photovoltaic systems of a similar scale. When matched to 
suitable loads, some CCHP systems can provide a simple 
payback in the five to ten year range, depending on system 
size and energy costs [7]. 
This work provides a quantitatively analysis of the 
significant benefits that can be brought by the CCHP 
systems. 
The paper has the following structure: Section II 
describes the main characteristics of the building complex; 
Section III reports the main energy flow and the financial 
advantages obtainable by the CCHP system. We conclude in 
Section IV. 
II. 
THE SAN MARCO HOSPITAL 
The “San Marco Hospital and Orthopedically Institute of 
Excellence” is located in the metropolitan area of Catania 
city, close to many facilities as like as airport, harbor and 
link roads with Sicilian motorway as Figure 2. It takes up an 
area of about 230.500 m2, the buildings of whole complex 
cover a surface about 28.500 m2 and the total buildings 
cubature is about 405.000 m3.  
 
Figure 2.  San Marco Hospital and Orthopaedical Institute of Excellence 
with Building Area in evidence  
Figures 3 and 4 show some views of hospital’s 
buildings. San Marco Hospital is an ideal candidate for a 
CCHP system because it operates 365 days for year and 
requires round the clock energy. A combined system could 
enable the hospital to reduce energy costs, improve 
environmental performance, and increase energy reliability. 
During the Italy blackout of electrical national network of 
28 September 2003, many hospitals had failures in their 
backup power generators. Blackout of electrical national 
grid and further possible negative happenings (terrorist 
outrages, oil crisis caused by war time events in oil 
producing countries, anomalies in national electrical 
distribution system, and so on) directs people efforts 
towards design of HVAC plants in such a way both to 
render energy supplying not dependent by an unique source 
and to reach the maximum possible as regard to energetic 
independence of the hospital.

A. Hospital’s energy needs 
The Hospital’s thermal needs (cooling, space heating, 
domestic hot water, steam, and ventilation) have been 
calculated using the MC4 software [8], which is a multi-use 
software program that calculates load and energy efficiency

for any type of building. The electrical needs (lighting, large 
medical equipment, distributed medical equipment & plug 
loads) have been calculated in function of the electric power 
of all the utilities operating simultaneously. 
The calculated power peak loads are shown in Table I.

B. Architecture of the energy system 
Hospitals have to be able to generate their own base load 
power, in conjunction with or as a backup for the main 
electricity in the event of an unexpected loss of electricity 
and/or emergency. System energy supply has been designed 
to operate independently of the grid during emergencies, 
and to be able to come online without relying on external 
energy sources maintaining the critical life support systems. 
For these reasons, designers have foreseen to utilize three 
distinct energetic sources: 
- Natural gas, to feed the gas turbine during normal service 
and, in case of emergency or for request of peak loads , 
three steam generators  
- Electric energy coming from national network during 
periods of maintenance or out of order of turbine. 
- Gas oil to feed in emergency (lack of natural gas) three 
steam generators. 
The architecture of the energy system feeding to the 
various machines and equipments of HVAC plant is shown 
in Figure 5. 
A turbine using natural gas produces electric power. Gas 
turbine produces high quality exhaust heat that can be used 
in CCHP configurations to reach overall system efficiencies 
(electricity and useful thermal energy) of 70 to 80 percent 
[6][9]. 
Another essential directive has been design and built a 
power plant that as far as possible would be compatible with 
the environment, by drawing on the best available 
techniques for the production processes and the process 
machinery. 
Based on the calculations to satisfy the energy demand 
of hospital, the designers have forecast the machines and 
equipments as following summarized: 
 
Figure 5.  Architecture of System 
- 
gas turbine, able to produce 5.250 kW of electric power   
- 
unfired heat recovery steam generator that produces 
12.750 kg/h of steam at 10 bar used into a  thermal loop 
for hospital space heating during winter months or to 
feed single effect absorption chillers that provide cooling 
power during the summer 
- 
electric power  generators, able to produce 600 kW of 
electric power 
- three steam generators, each one able to produce about 
5.000 kg/h of steam, that is about 2.780 kWt 
- 
Two electric chillers, each one able to produce 4.079 kW 
of cooling power 
- 
Two absorption chillers, each one able to produce 4.037 
kW of cooling power 
For standard operating conditions, the energetic 
demands will be satisfy as shown in Table II.

The plant has supplemented by other machines and 
equipments like: Air Treatment Units (ATU), cooling 
towers, compressors, pumps, tanks, vessels, heat exchangers 
and so on. The Gas Turbine is able to produce about 5,25 
MWe at steady state condition, and, in meantime, to 
discharge a flow of about 87.840 kg/h of exhaust gas at 
500°C.  
The thermal energy contained in exhaust gas is utilized 
to feed the heat recovery steam generator able to generate 
about 12.750 kg/h of superheated steam in is turn utilized to 
feed subsequent thermal exchanges : 
- heat exchangers to produce hot water at 80°C for the 
heating utilities;  
- heat exchangers to produce hot sanitary water  at 48.5 °C, 
whilst the temperature forecasted in hot water storage tank 
is about 62°C 
- the two absorption chillers  
- post heating exchangers of air treatment units (ATU) 
- various utilities ad equipments of hospital 
C. Critical States of Energy Supplying 
There are three possibilities to have critical state for the 
supplying of energy to systems: 
- Critical state n.1: blackout in national electric network.  
- Critical state n.2: ordinary or extraordinary maintenance of 
the gas turbine  
- Critical state n.3: blackout for the grid distribution of 
natural gas  
For each one of previous critical states, thanks both to 
three possibilities of energy supply and to all the machines 
and equipments foreseen, the hospital system will be always 
able to offer health services to the users. The strategies to 
solve the problem of energy supply, caused by previous 
critical states, are shown in Table III.

ENERGY FLOW AND FINANCIAL ADVANTAGES  
CCHP often can offer financial advantages over power 
purchased from a local utility or produced by other energy 
systems. Moreover, CCHP system creates an additional 
revenue stream by allowing hospitals to sell surplus 
electricity back to their utilities. A hospital’s ability to do this 
depends on the net metering and rate policies of its utility. 
Typically, “selling back” during off-peak hours is not 
profitable for a hospital, but, given the right circumstances, it 
can be a revenue generator during peak hours.  
The baselines of Italian rules starts up the so called 
“Green Certificates Market” that allows to producers of 
electric energy by alternative sources to sell their Green 
4

ENERGY 2012 : The Second International Conference on Smart Grids, Green Communications and IT Energy-aware Technologies

Certificates to producers that do not make use renewable 
sources.  
In accordance with Italian legislation [10][11][12], on the 
efficient use of fuels, the CHP plants can obtain incentives, 
like exemption from having to buy Green Certificates and 
priority dispatching of the electricity it produce, if the 
Energy Recovery Index (ERI) and the Thermal Limit (TL) 
are, respectively, at least 10% and 15%. 
The Energy Recovery Index quantifies the saving of 
primary energy achieved by a section of cogeneration 
compared to the separate production of the same quantities 
of electrical and thermal energy.  
The Thermal Limit quantifies the amount of useful 
thermal energy produced annually compared to the total 
production of electricity and heat.  
Another verification is request for the Energy Index (Ien) 
and it fixes the smallest values (0,51) to identify CCHP as 
renewable source; 
The Energy Recovery Index defined by Decree No. 
79/99, corresponding to the PES (Primary Energy Saving) 
introduced with the European directive 2004/8/CE that fixes 
the “high efficiency of plants” if it is verified a PES more 
than 10%. More punctual technical definition of previous 
indexes are reported in Italian Regulation previously 
referred.  
The design of plants has been developed with the aim 
even to produce yearly excess of electric energy in relation to 
that one strictly necessary to satisfy the demand of the 
hospital. In this way it is possible to market the energy 
surplus and to have yearly economic benefits. 
Table IV shows the values of main energy indexes of 
designed CCHP compared with that one required by 
technical manager of the Hospital. The value obtained by 
designers confirms that the CCHP system may be 
considered, in force of Italian regulation, as a renewable 
source. Table IV shows the value of main energy indexes of 
designed CCHP in relation to that one required by terms of 
contract by technical manager of Hospital Enterprise. The 
value obtained by designers confirms that the plants may be 
considered, in force of Italian regulation, as renewable 
sources.

On the basis of these indexes values, the works council of 
Hospital will be able to accede in Green Certificate Market 
to sell that amount of electric energy yearly produced but 
none self-consumed. 
People have calculated the monthly financial fluxes 
shown in Table V. The reported data have calculated  
considering the energy fluxes, reported in Fig.6, and the 
average prices of free market both for natural gas (source 
A.S.E.C. S.p.a: €/m3 0,48) and electric energy (source Enel 
€/kWh 0,09 average over 24 hours ). 
The CCHP systems give also considerable results in 
terms of respect of environment. In fact these systems have 
higher whole system efficiency than systems that split 
heating and power generation. With less fuel consumed, 
GHG and air pollutants (like nitrogen oxides and sulphur 
dioxides) are reduced more than 25,000 tons per year.

inpatient areas and will provide the continuity of energy 
supply during every critical state. The following percentage 
of supplies have been calculated in function of “peak 
demands”: in the worse case (blackout in natural gas 
feeding), the system will be able to guarantee the 82% of the 
power thermal demand, the 74% of the power cooling 
demand and the 100% of power electric demand. The study 
predicts 
a 
large 
potential 
for 
financial 
savings, 
approximately €1,00 M€ year. 
By enabling hospitals to supply their own power, CCHP 
systems also provide a hedge against the rising cost of 
electricity. 
The technique gives also considerable results in terms of 
respect of environment: CCHP systems have higher whole 
system efficiency than systems that split heating and power 
generation. With less fuel consumed, greenhouse gases and 
air pollutants (nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxides) are 
reduced more than 25,000 tons per year of carbon dioxide 
equivalent.
