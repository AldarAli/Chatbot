Abstract – This paper is devoted to the solution of problems
connected with power grid safety. States of power grid are
specific conditions of power grid determined by voltage,
current and frequency fluctuations. Criticality of grid is a
marginal state of grid with nearly to loss of stability. The state
of power grid is determined by states of its systems,
conditioned by their mutual influence of different nature.
These influences cause the change of state of each system
during grid life cycle. Problem is closely related to risk to NPP
safety due to state of power grid. When grid is close to loss of
its stability (call it as grid instabilities) NPP risk increase. It
means the power grid conditions might affect NPP safety.
Problem is to evaluate risk of NPP-PG interconnections. The
proposed approach is based on application of Bayesian Belief
Network, where nodes represent different grid systems, and
links are stipulated by different types of influences (physical,
informational, geographic, etc.). The grid safety is evaluated
by its criticality. The criticality and influence are treated as
the linguistic values. It is suggested to evaluate criticality of
system, considering the change of criticalities of all connected
systems. Conditional probabilities are also represented by
linguistic values. To demonstrate the approach to the grid
safety analysis, Russian Sayano–Shushenskaya hydro power
station accident is reviewed. BBN is suggested as a tool for
NPP PG risk assessment.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Motivation
The power grid (PG) is an interconnected network
composed
of
power-generation
stations,
high-voltage
transmission lines, lower voltage distribution systems, and
other support components. PG is a highly controlled,
dynamic and distributed network combined of different
systems. This complexity of engineered systems is a
consequence
of
several
factors:
the
sheer
size
and
interconnectivity of the PG, the safety requirements, the
need to balance electricity supply and consumption –
throughout the grid at all times, and the nature of electricity
that it is generated as it is used. This means the PG requires
continual surveillance and adjustment to ensure supply
always matches demand.
Disturbances in PG operation can originate from
natural disasters, failures, human factors, terrorism, and so
on. Outages and faults will cause serious problems and
failures in the interconnected power systems, propagating
into critical infrastructures such as Nuclear Industries,
Telecommunication systems, transportation systems, etc.
Therefore, it is of high priority to consider PG safety,
mutual influence of its systems and forecast possible
accidents and failures, considering their severity and high
costs of recovery.
B. Work Related Analysis
There are a lot of approaches and techniques of PG
safety assessment. An approach to PG safety analysis,
taking into consideration technical, organizational, and
individual aspects, is proposed by Linstone [1]. The PG
safety analysis is supplemented by a set of geographic and
economic aspects developed by Kaiser [2]. An approach
for PG safety assessment, based on processing statistical
data related to PG operation, is proposed by Holmgren and
Molin [3]. The main task of the safety statistical analysis is
to determine the failure probability distribution function
and to assess power grid risk. Lack of statistics prevents
the use of traditional statistical methods for PG safety
assessment.
Beside well known techniques of probabilistic and
deterministic PG safety analysis, there are a lot of different
approaches used for PG safety assessment. Logic methods
(Fault Tree Analysis and Event Tree Analysis), used for
safety analysis, are applied in research done by Bedford
and Cooke [4] and Hoyland [5]. Typical PG safety analysis
techniques are connected with equipment failure analysis,
environment and human factor. Nowadays, a new type of
grid hazards – intentional attacks occur. This type of
hazards is analyzed by the use of probabilistic approach
together
with
conditional
probabilities
calculation.
However, mutual influence of systems, taking into account
dynamical aspects of functioning and variation of risks
caused by their failures, is not considered. Recently,
network modeling has been revived due to computer
technology progress and increase of interest in complex
systems analysis. Achievements in a graph theory for
complex systems analysis are reviewed by Albert and
Barabasi [6]. A topology of North American Power System
is analyzed. Graph is used as a model by Albert [7].
Evaluations, specifying Power System topology, lack of
connectivity, while demounting vertexes that connect
transmitting substations, are calculated. Two types of
power grid safety hazards are analyzed: random failures
and antagonistic (intentional) attacks.
Some
methods
used
for
PG
safety
analysis
are
qualitative and based on expert evaluations. Analysis
results are represented
in the form of risk
matrix,
containing
failure
effect
frequency
and
severity.
Qualitative techniques of safety analysis do not operate

numeric
data
providing
results
as
descriptions,
recommendations. The safety assessment is related to
qualitative description of frequency of undesired events,
damage and threat scenario. In [8] Glass specified that
safety of a PG can be improved by implementing of
process automation in disturbance situations.
The PG safety is affected by many factors regarding its
design,
manufacturing,
installation,
commissioning,
operation and maintenance. Consequently, it may be
extremely difﬁcult to construct a complete mathematical
model for the system in order to assess the safety because
of inadequate knowledge about the basic failure events.
This leads inevitably to problems of uncertainty in PG
safety assessment.
The power grid is a very complex system. It is
characterized by huge number of nodes and links between
nodes with increasing structural complexity; links between
nodes could change over time, have different weights,
directions, etc. There are some PG attributes such as self-
adaptation, PG self-healing, etc. which keep us aside from
adequate understanding of PG nature, behavior types,
accident mechanisms, etc.
There are a lot of risks as the inherited essences of PG
life cycle. Due to high PG complexity, its dynamic nature
these risks are not static. More over PG life cycle is
characterized by complicated risk flow when safety and
reliability issues might endanger the cyber security and
vise verse. The risk associated with PG weakest link could
compromise the safety and reliability of PG as a whole.
As an application of probability theory, Bayesian belief
network (BBN) proposed by Heping [9] is a powerful tool
both for graphically representing the relationships among a
set of variables and for dealing with uncertainties in such
variables. Many applications have proven that BBN is a
powerful technique for reasoning relationships among a
number
of
variables
under
uncertainty.
BBN
was
successfully applied to ecological risk assessment and fault
diagnosis in complex nuclear power systems.
But,
traditional
BBN
requires
too
much
precise
information in the form of prior and conditional probability
tables, and such information is often difficult or impossible
to
obtain.
In
particular,
in
dealing
with
indirect
relationships, even domain experts may find that it is
usually difficult to make precise judgments with crisp
numbers, that is, to assign an exact number to the
probability that consequences happen given the occurrence
of an event. In certain circumstances, a verbal expression,
e.g., “very unlikely” or interval value, e.g., 0.15, 0.20 of
probabilistic uncertainty may be more appropriate than
numerical values.
Common disadvantages of mentioned approaches are as
follows: PG safety is considered a static attribute; no
consideration for risk flow inside of PG; no consideration
provided
for
mutual
influences
between
power
grid
systems; there is a lack of publications for PG safety
assessment with BBN using linguistic experts’ judgments.
C. Goal of the Paper
To assure the PG safety, it is necessary to consider and
thoroughly analyze the nature of interaction among PG
systems and evaluate the risk flow. The goal of the paper is
to introduce an approach to power grid safety assessment,
considering the different type of influence among its
systems and evaluate safety using linguistic BBN. This
technique can be useful to evaluate PG safety, taking into
consideration mutual influences of its systems when all
data available are represented by expert’s knowledge.
II. PRINCIPLES OF POWER GRID SAFETY ANALYSIS WITH
LINGUISTIC CASUAL NETWORK
A. General Principles of Analysis
The PG safety analysis is carried out taking into
consideration
principles
of
dynamism,
hierarchy,
uncertainty, and influence (interaction) of subsystems.
Principle of dynamical analysis assumes to record
changes of system criticality during the operation as a
result of changes of its states (transition to state of non-
operability). At each stage of life cycle, the criticality
assessment specification and adjustment of criticality
matrices [10], taking into consideration probable changes,
are carried out.
The principle of hierarchy assumes representation of
grid structure as a hierarchy.
The principle of influence of subsystem failures of i-
level (on subsystem failure criticality of the same level)
and influence on subsystems of (i-1)-level (higher) is
important.
The safety of all influenced subsystems must be
reconsidered.
The principle of uncertainty takes into consideration
information incompleteness and uncertainty related to the
conditions that cause PG accidents.
The principle of the weakest link risk flow is based on
assumption that PG safety might be evaluated on risks
associated with the weakest link of the grid.
The PG safety is an integral value composed of grid
systems safety values. The grid safety is determined by
uncontrolled mutual influence among grid systems. It is
worth to note that influence exists on all grid levels and
have to be taken into consideration when providing grid
systems safety.
B. Types of Influences Between Power Grid Systems
According to the principle of influence, all influences
(or relationships), existing in PG, can be divided into
several hierarchy levels. The influence is an ability of one
PG system to determine the state, characteristics or
processes in other systems. Any type of influence is a time
dependent
value.
The
changes
in
NPP
state
and
characteristics stipulate the changes in the influence value.
Generally, influences could be classified into different
types [11]:


– an influence that exists

The societal influence

(S
 S )
that one PG
system may have one of societal factors as public opinion,
fear and confidence, for example, staff of other PG system.
The
modern
PG
has
become
the
informational
infrastructure. As a result a new type of influences might
be introduced in the scope of analysis. For example,
physical
state
of
one
system
might
influence
the
informational state of other system, etc.
The formalization of influences between PG systems is
very helpful for its safety assessment based on criticality
matrices. Generally, criticality matrix is represented as
FMECA table. The traditional FMECA [12] is the most
widely used reliability analysis technique on the initial
stages of system development.
For example, if PG system S1 consists of three
subsystems S11, S12, S13 then criticality matrix which
represents the system S1 might be presented as shown in
the Table 1.
TABLE I.
CRITICALITY MATRIX FOR SYSTEM S₁
Traditionally, the criticality assessment is performed by
calculating the criticality accident (failure) as a product of
its severity and probability:

i

Crt S
P S
Sev S


(1)
where Si is PG system; P(Si) is probability of Si accident;
Sev(Si) – severity of accident consequences.
According to the principle of hierarchy, the grid
structure might be represented as a hierarchy. In this case,
the safety of PG systems of higher level hierarchy might be
evaluated as a sum of criticalities of power grid systems of
lower level
hierarchy. For
example, considering the
criticalities of S11, S12, S13 as subsystems of S1, its total
criticality could be calculated as:

Another approach might introduced considering the
weakest link of PG. In this case the system total criticality
might be equaled its weakest link criticality.
It is suggested to treat criticality as PG system’s safety
inverse value. The more system criticality the less its safety
and vice versa.
It should be noted that criticality matrix might be used
to
represent different states of environment and
its
influence
on
PG
systems.
We
suggest
to
use
the
environmental FMECA where different natural hazards
(earthquake, flooding, etc.) are considered as different
failures modes characterized by its probability and severity
for the nearest PG systems. This probability of system
accident (natural disaster) and its severity could be handled
as linguistic or numerical variable. Hence, criticality is also
treated correspondently either linguistic or numerical
variable.
A linguistic variable is characterized by a quintuple
(x, T(x), U, G, M) in which x is the name of variable; T(x)
is the term set of x, that is, the set of names of linguistic
values of x with each value being a fuzzy number deﬁned
on U; G is a syntactic rule for generating the names of
values of x; and M is a semantic rule for associating with
each value its meaning.
The set of state  Si of any PG system Si is determined
as:
 Si = {Crt (Si)=High, Crt (Si)=Medium,
Crt (Si)=Low}.
(3
)
Any accident or failure of power grid system leads to
the change of criticality of all connected systems due to
principle of risk flow. When a failure of one system occurs,
the criticalities of all dependent systems are recalculated.
The prognosis and assessment of PG system service
life, based on real time measurements, will help to identify
grid systems most likely to fail. The potential estimation
methods
and
equipment
service

for
complicated systems consist of deterministic, statistical,
physical-statistical
and
methods
based
on
expert
knowledge.
These
methods
are
used
to
predict
the
probability of accident of any system Sij of Si.
This criticality assessment is used to support the
subjective expert judgment expressed by linguistic variable
on the initial power grid system state. The more system
criticality calculated on (2) the more confident expert’s
opinion on the criticality of each node of PG.
C. Bayesian Belief Network as a Model for Power Grid’s
safety assessment
BBN is a classical causal network represented as a pair
N= {(V, E), P} where V and E are the nodes and the edges
of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), respectively, and P is
a
probability
distribution
over
V.
Discrete
random
variables
1

{
,
,...,


are assigned to the nodes
while the edges E represent the causal probabilistic
relationship among the nodes. Each node in the network is
annotated with a Conditional Probability Table (CPT) that
represents the conditional probability of the variable given
the values of its parents in the graph. The CPT contains, for
each possible value of the variable associated to a node, all
the conditional probabilities
with respect to
all
the
combinations of values of the variables associated with the
parent nodes. For nodes that have
no
parents, the
corresponding
table
will
simply
contain
the
prior
probabilities for that variable.
The principles behind BBN are Bayesian statistics and
concentrate on how probabilities are affected by both prior
and posterior knowledge. In order to extend the classic
BBN into fuzzy BBN which is capable of dealing with
linguistic variables, fuzzy numbers and their operations
must be used.
The state of each PG system is determined by types of
influence mentioned above. The Figure 1 represents a

fragment of network, which characterizes the PG, where
S1, S2 are the parent nodes and system S3 is a child node.
Generally, the several BBNs might be required to
represent only one PG. These networks have the same
nodes as PG systems, but different types of influence,
which
stipulate
the
different
causal
links
(physical,
geographical, organizational, logical, informational and
societal) between nodes. The different types of influence
are characterized by its own weight. The more weight of
the given type of influence (according to the expert
judgments) the more PG sensitive to this type of influence.
Figure 1. A fragment of network, which characterizes the PG.
Apparently, the physical influence is more important,
when PG safety is considered. But all types of influences
should be considered to provide more accurate PG safety
evaluation. For each type of influence might be introduced
its own type of PG system particular criticality. It means
that PG could be more vulnerable to the change of one type
of influence and, at the same time, be insensitive to other
type influence change.
Considering the types of influence mentioned it is
assumed that the total PG system criticality is a function of
power grid system’s particular criticalities, stipulated by
the particular types of influence, i.e.,

Depending on the scale used to evaluate criticality, each
PG system could be characterized by the tuple of its
criticalities values, considering the types of influence,
which determine these criticalities.
Example of power grid system criticality tuple is shown
in the Table 2.

This tuple might be interpreted as combination of risks
for particular PG systems due to different type of
influences caused by other systems inside of PG.
The following task is to calculate the particular
criticality, stipulated by the given type of influence. We
suggest using BBN to evaluate the criticalities of the PG
systems.
According to approach, it is suggested to construct
BBN for each type of influence. Each node of BBN is
represented by criticality matrix. Nodes are connected by
links, which represent the different types of influence.
Hence, BBNs, which describe the PG system safety,
consist of set of nodes. For each node the set of state is
introduced.
As
mentioned,
the
state
of
node
is
characterized by a value of its criticality, calculated
according to (2).
Every node also has a conditional probability table
(CPT),
associated
with
it.
Conditional
probabilities
represent likelihoods based on prior information or past
experience.
A
conditional
probability
is
stated
mathematically as, i.e., the probabilities of power grid
system (child node) being at state characterized by
expressions
“Criticality
is
High
(Medium,
Low)”,
considering all possible combinations of other PG systems
(parents’ nodes) criticalities (High, Medium, Low).
As mentioned these conditional probabilities might be
represented
by
linguistic
values
(for
example
High,
Medium, Low).
Fragment of linguistic CPT is shown in the Table 3.

If M = <m, α, β> and N = <n, γ, δ>  are two TFNs then
their addition is expressed as:
M  N = <m + n,α + γ,β + δ>.
(7)
Multiplication M  N of two TFNs is not necessarily a
triangular.
A good approximation is as follows:
M  N = <m,α,β>  <n,γ,δ> 
<mn, mγ + nα, mδ + nβ>.

These fuzzy arithmetic operations are used to calculate
new linguistic probabilities represented by TFNs. These
fuzzy probabilities usually do not match any linguistic term
in the initial term set (High, Medium, Low), so a computing
with words (CWW) procedure is needed to express the
result in the original expression domain.
The CWW is used to express the result in the original
expression domain. CWW procedure uses the linguistic
assessments
and
makes
computations
with
them.
Foundations and applications, providing the current status
of theoretical and empirical developments in CWW, can be
found in [14].

According to (5), the probabilities for system S1, being
at the state described by expression “Criticality - High”,
“Criticality – Medium” and “Criticality-High” might be
calculated.

III. HPP ACCIDENT CASE STUDY BASED ON LINGUISTIC
CASUAL NETWORK
To demonstrate the approach to the power grid safety
analysis, using the linguistic BBN, Russian Sayano–
Shushenskaya HPP failure (August, 2009) is reviewed
[15]. This HPP is one of the largest (together with
Bratskaya HPP) one, used for power control of the whole
power system with installed capacity - 6,4 mm kW, annual
output - 22,8 bln kW p.h. Ten hydraulic units, each of 640
kW, are installed in the plant.
The BBN is built for fragment of Siberian power
systems. BBN’s nodes are criticalities matrixes of Sayano–
Shushenskaya HPP – S1, Mayansk HPP – S2, Bratskaya
HPP– S3, Thermal Power Plant (TPP) of Bratsk – S4.
Only physical influence is considered to evaluate state
of S1 when conditional probabilities are expressed in
linguistic values. Each node of Siberian power systems is
completed by linguistic conditional probabilities table (see
Table 4).
The increasing of load from Bratskaya HPP and
Mayansk HPP increased the criticality of S1 and, finally,
led to destruction of HPU – 2 (S32). Increasing of criticality
of S1 led to increasing criticality of S4.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The proposed technique may be applied to PG safety
value prediction, taking into account its systems influence.
The technique is based on the use of dynamical criticality
matrices hierarchy. The power grid’s capacity used to
predict the possible safety change could be improved by
implementing of the decision making system.
The technique suggested in the paper is considered as a
part of this system. The PG safety assessment is carried out
taking
into
consideration
principles
of
dynamism,
hierarchy, uncertainty and mutual influence of systems.
BBN is used to predict the particular criticality of PG
system, conditioned by the given type of influence. CWW
is suggested to determine the probabilities of PG states
expressed by linguistic values.
The results of analysis may be used to determine
effective safety management strategies.
Consideration of the difference types of influence
allows improving the accuracy of PG safety value.
Next step of technique enhancement will be related to
consideration of Ukrainian NPP safety analysis, taking into
consideration the types of influences of power grid and
development of decision making tool-based system.
Main math tool would be based on dynamic BBN
which allow considering the changes of systems states and
perform safety assessment in time-related manner.
