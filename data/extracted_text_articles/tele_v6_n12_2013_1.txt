Abstract—The aim of this article is to present a new
analytical calculation method for the occupancy distribution
and the blocking probability in the so-called limited-availability
group with multi-service sources and reservation mechanisms.
The limited-availability group consists of links with differ-
ent capacities. The article considers multi-service limited-
availability systems with multi-service sources, in which each
single trafﬁc source can generate calls of different trafﬁc
classes. The results of analytical modeling of the limited-
availability systems with multi-service sources and reservation
mechanisms are compared with simulation data, which conﬁrm
a high accuracy of the method. Any possible application
of the proposed model can be considered in the context of
wireless networks with multi-service sources and reservation
mechanisms. The proposed model can be also considered in
the context of switching networks.
Keywords-limited-availability systems; multi-service networks;
multi-service sources; bandwidth reservation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Cellular networks are one of the most rapidly growing
areas of telecommunications and one of the most popular
systems of mobile communication. They can be used for
voice transmission, but are also very efﬁcient for sending
data streams from different applications [1] [2] [3] [4]. Data
transmission is a type of service that originally was not
handled by cellular networks. Over time, data transmission
has become more and more popular in expanding mobile
networks. Data transmission services offered by operators
include video conferencing services, streaming audio ser-
vices, electronic mail and large ﬁle transmission [5] [6] [7]
[8] [9].
The increase in intensity of trafﬁc generated by data
transmission services is accompanied by an increase in
the requirements with respect to the volume of resources
offered by networks. This also causes a growing necessity
of working out mechanisms that introduce differentiation
in Quality of Service (QoS) for particular data classes.
The introduction of QoS differentiation mechanisms was
conducive in turn to a development of new analytical models
for dimensioning of multi-service mobile networks. The
initial models of multi-service cellular networks assumed
that a single trafﬁc source of a given class could generate
only one, strictly deﬁned, type of the trafﬁc stream (trafﬁc
sources class unequivocally determined the nature of a
trafﬁc stream). In the analytical models of such multi-service
systems with single-service sources the class of trafﬁc stream
generated is deﬁned by the class of its trafﬁc source. Using
the models of the multi-service systems with single-service
source both cell groups without QoS mechanisms introduced
[10] and cell groups with QoS differentiation mechanisms
were considered, including resource reservation mechanisms
[11] [12] [13].
With multi-service terminals becoming more and more
universal in modern cellular networks, it has become nec-
essary to develop new trafﬁc models. In [14], a model of
the multi-service network was presented for the ﬁrst time,
which assumed that a given and deﬁned set of services was
related to a single trafﬁc source. The considered system
was described as a multi-service system with multi-service
sources. The considerations presented in [14] were limited,
however, to a model of a full-availability group (single
resource) without any QoS differentiation mechanisms in-
troduced. In [1], the model of limited-availability group (a
group of separated resources, e.g., a group of cells) with
multi-service sources and bandwidth reservation has been
presented.
This article proposes a generalized model of a limited-
availability group of resources, in which — to facilitate
resource usage — a reservation mechanism has been im-
plemented. The model can be used for modeling groups of
cells with different capacities in multi-service networks, thus
expanding the results presented in [1] in which resources
with the same capacities are discussed. In the proposed
model, it is taken into consideration that a single terminal
can generate various trafﬁc streams corresponding to partic-
ular services implemented in the terminal. Additionally, it
is assumed that the services cannot be used simultaneously
by the terminal. This means that when the terminal is
involved in the generation of trafﬁc stream related to one
service, it cannot at the same time generate trafﬁc streams
related to other services (A case when a single terminal
can simultaneously generate a few trafﬁc streams can be
also taken into account in the analytical modeling – such a
terminal can be treated as a few trafﬁc sources).
The remaining part of the article is organized as fol-
lows. In Section II, the generalized model of the limited-
availability systems with multi-service sources and resource

reservation mechanism is proposed. In Section III, the sim-
ulator of multi-service systems with limited-availability is
presented. In this section, the results of the blocking prob-
ability obtained for limited-availability systems with multi-
service sources and reservation mechanisms are compared
with the simulation data. Section IV concludes the article
and presents further work.
II. ANALYTICAL MODEL OF SYSTEM WITH
MULTI-SERVICE SOURCES AND RESERVATION
MECHANISMS
Let us consider a generalized model of the limited-
availability group (GMLAG) with multi-service sources and
the capacity VL, presented in Figure 1. The generalized
limited-availability group model is a model of a system that
is composed of links with different capacities. The group is
composed of z types of links. Each type h is unequivocally
deﬁned by the number υh of links of a given type and by the
capacity fh of each of the links of a given type (Figure 1).
The total capacity VL of the limited-availability group with
different capacities of links is then Pz
h=1 υhfh. The group
can admit a call of a given class for service only when it
can be entirely carried by the resources of one of the links.
Figure 1.
Generalized model of the limited-availability group
In the considered model, m trafﬁc classes that belong
to the set M = {1, 2, ..., m} are deﬁned. A given class
c requires tc Basic Bandwidth Units (BBUs) to set up a
new connection. The service time for class c calls has an
exponential distribution with the parameter µc (service rate).
In the group, the reservation mechanism has been applied.
In accordance with the adopted reservation mechanism for
a given class c, the reservation limit Qc is introduced (Qc
is a certain occupancy state of the system, expressed in the
number of BBUs being busy). The reservation mechanism
can be applied to selected trafﬁc classes from the set M. The
classes, in which the reservation limit has been introduced,
are grouped into a new set of classes R, which is a sub-set of
the set M. The parameter Rc that determines the reservation
area (a certain number of occupancy states of the system)
has also been deﬁned. This parameter can be expressed by
the following formula:
Rc = VL − Qc.
(1)
The system admits a call of class c that belongs to the
set R for service only when this call can be entirely carried
by the resources of an arbitrary single link and when the
number of free BBUs in the group is higher or equal to the
value of the reservation area Rc. A call of class c that does
not belong to the set R can be serviced when this call can be
entirely carried by the resources of an arbitrary single link.
Thus, this is an example of a system with a state-dependent
service process, in which the state dependence is the result
of the structure of the group and the introduced reservation
mechanism. An example of the limited-availability group
with reservation mechanism applied for only class 1 is
presented in Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Generalized model of the limited-availability group with
reservation mechanisms
The group is offered three types of Erlang (Poisson
call streams), Engset (binomial call streams) and Pascal
(negative binomial call streams) trafﬁc streams [15]. The
selected types of trafﬁc cover three different types of the
dependence between the mean arrival rates of calls and the
occupancy state of the system: (1) the mean arrival rate of
new calls does not depend on the occupancy state of the
system (Erlang trafﬁc), (2) the mean arrival rate of new
calls decreases with the increase in the occupancy state of
the system (Engset trafﬁc), (3) the mean arrival rate of new

calls increases with the increase in the occupancy state of
the system (Pascal trafﬁc).
Each trafﬁc stream is generated by sources that belong to
the corresponding set of trafﬁc sources ZC,s. In set ZC,s,
index C denotes the type of trafﬁc stream generated by
sources, which belong to this set and takes the value I for
Erlang trafﬁc stream, J for Engset trafﬁc stream and K for
Pascal trafﬁc stream, respectively, while index s denotes the
number of the set, the sources of which generate a given type
of trafﬁc stream. In the system, the sI sets of trafﬁc sources
that generate Erlang trafﬁc streams are deﬁned, as well as
sJ sets of trafﬁc sources that generate Engset trafﬁc streams
and sK sets of trafﬁc sources that generate Pascal trafﬁc
streams. The total number of the sets of trafﬁc sources is
S = sI + sJ + sK. The sources that belong to the set ZC,s
can generate calls from the set CC,s = {1, 2, ..., cC,s} of
trafﬁc classes according to the available set of services.
The participation of class c (from the set M) in the trafﬁc
structure of trafﬁc generated by sources from the set ZC,s
is determined by the parameter ηC,s,c, which, for particular
sets of Erlang, Engset and Pascal trafﬁc sources, satisﬁes the
following dependencies:
cI,i
X
c=1
ηI,i,c = 1,
cJ,j
X
c=1
ηJ,j,c = 1,
cK,k
X
c=1
ηK,k,c = 1.
(2)
To determine the value of trafﬁc AI,i,c offered by Erlang
sources that belong to the set ZI,i as well as the trafﬁc value
AJ,j,c(n) offered by Engset sources from the set ZJ,j and
trafﬁc AK,k,c(n) offered by Pascal sources from the set ZK,k
that generate calls of class c in the state of n busy BBUs,
we use the following formulas [14]:
AI,i,c = ηI,i,cλI,i/µc,
(3)
AJ,j,c(n) = [ηJ,j,cNJ,j − yJ,j,c(n)]αJ,j,
(4)
AK,k,c(n) = [ηK,k,cSK,k + yK,k,c(n)]βK,k,
(5)
where:
• λI,i – the mean arrival rate of new calls generated by
a single Poisson source that belongs to the set ZI,i
• ηJ,j,c – the parameter that determines the participation
of calls of class c in trafﬁc generated by sources that
belong to the set ZJ,j,
• ηK,k,c – the parameter that determines the participation
of calls of class c in trafﬁc generated by sources that
belong to the set ZK,k,
• NJ,j – the number of Engset trafﬁc sources that belong
to the set ZJ,j,
• SK,k – the number of Pascal trafﬁc sources that belong
to the set ZK,k,
• yJ,j,c(n) – the average number of calls of class c
generated by Engset sources that belong to the set
ZJ,j currently serviced in the system in the occupancy
state n,
• yK,k,c(n) – the average number of calls of class c
generated by Pascal sources that belong to the set
ZK,k currently serviced in the system in the occupancy
state n,
• αJ,j – the average trafﬁc intensity of trafﬁc generated
by a single Engset source that belongs to the set ZJ,j,
determined by the following formula:
αJ,j =
cJ,j
X
c=1
ηJ,j,c
γJ,j
µc
,
(6)
where γJ,j – the mean arrival rate of new calls gener-
ated by a single Engset source that belongs to the set
ZJ,j,
• βK,k – the average trafﬁc intensity of trafﬁc generated
by a single Pascal source that belongs to the set ZK,k,
deﬁned by the following formula:
βK,k =
cK,k
X
c=1
ηK,k,c
γK,k
µc
,
(7)
where γK,k – the mean arrival rate of new calls
generated by a single Pascal source that belongs to the
set ZK,k.
We can notice that – according to Formulas (4) and (5) –
with the case of Engset sources, the mean trafﬁc intensity
generated by new calls of individual trafﬁc classes decreases
with the increase in the occupancy state of the system,
whereas in the case of Pascal sources the mean trafﬁc
intensity generated by new calls of individual trafﬁc classes
increases with the increase in the occupancy state of the
system.
The ﬁrst articles on modeling systems with limited-
availability were limited to include multi-service systems
with single-service sources only [16] [17] [18]. In [16],
an approximate method for a determination of the block-
ing probability in the generalized limited-availability group
model is proposed, while [17] discusses a group model with
Engset trafﬁc streams. Limited-availability groups servicing
BPP trafﬁc are studied in [18] [19].
The ﬁrst studies on modeling multi-service systems with
limited-availability and multi-service sources are presented
in [20], while a method for modeling systems with multi-
service sources and the reservation mechanism is described
in [1]. The present article, taking advantage of the results
presented in [16], proposes an expansion of the method
proposed in [1] to provide a possibility of a determination
of the occupancy distribution in the generalized limited-
availability group model with the reservation mechanism.
For this purpose, it is necessary to ﬁrst determine conditional
transition coefﬁcients σc,S(n) for calls of class c. These
coefﬁcients deﬁne the inﬂuence of a particular structure of
a group on the process of the determination of the blocking
probability. They can be determined on the basis of one of
the two following methods: the one presented further on in

the text of this section (the combinatorial method), and the
convolutional method proposed in [21].
In the combinatorial method, the conditional transition
probability σc,S(n) for a trafﬁc stream of class c in the
generalized limited-availability group with the parameters:
z, υh, fh, VL, is determined with the assumption, similarly
as in the limited-availability basic model [22], that there
are n busy BBUs in the considered group and that each
distribution of free BBUs is treated as a division of busy
BBUs of one class (t1 = 1) between the links.
Let us consider ﬁrst a limited-availability group composed
of links of two types (z = 2). The capacity VL of this group
can be represented as the sum of the capacities of the links
of the ﬁrst and the second type, i.e.,
VL = V1 + V2,
where: V1 = υ1f1, V2 = υ2f2.
(8)
A determination of the number of all possible distributions
x of free BBUs in the group can in this case be successfully
performed in two stages:
1) we determine the number of all possible combinations
of distribution (division) of x free BBUs in the links
of the two types, i.e., all combinations of the division
of x BBUs into x1 BBUs in the links of the ﬁrst type
and x − x1 BBUs in the links of the second type;
2) we determine the number of possible distributions of
a given number of BBUs in the links of the same type,
i.e., the number of distributions x1 BBUs in the links
of the ﬁrst type (with the limit of the capacity of a link
to f1 BBU taken into account), and x−x1 BBUs in the
links of the second type (with the limit of the capacity
of a link to f2 BBU taken into account) (Figure 3).
Figure 3.
Possible distributions of x free BBUs in links of the two types
The number of distributions determined in the second
stage is determined on the basis of the following formula
which determines the number of arrangements of x free
BBUs in υ links and the capacity of each link is equal to f
BBUs and each link has at least t free BBUs:
F (x, υ, f, t) =
=
⌊ x−υt

(−1)r
υ
r
x − υ(t − 1) − 1 − r(f − t + 1)
υ − 1

.
(9)
Eventually, the number of possible distributions of x free
BBUs in the links of the two types – with the assumption
that in each link of the ﬁrst type there are at least t1 free
BBUs and in each link of the second type there are at least
t2 free BBUs – can be expressed by the following formula:
F{x, (υ1, υ2), (f1, f2), (t1, t2)} =
=
x
X
x1=0
F(x1, υ1, f1, t1)F(x − x1, υ2, f2, t2).
(10)
The number of possible distributions of x free BBUs in
groups composed of links of three types can be determined
in a similar way as for the group composed of links of two
types:
F{x, (υ1, υ2, υ3), (f1, f2, f3), (t1, t2, t3)} =
=
x

F(x1, υ1, f1, t1)F(x2, υ2, f2, t2)·
· F(x − x1 − x2, υ3, f3, t3)
(11)
and then – generalizing the formula (11) – for groups
composed of links of l types:
F{(x, (υ1, υ2, . . . , υl), (f1, f2, . . . , fl), (t1, t2, . . . , tl)} =

(12)
Formula (12) can be eventually rewritten into the following

Formula (13) makes it possible to determine the transition

process occurring in the limited-availability group with z
types of links in the state of n busy (i.e., x = V − n free)

F{V − n, (υ1, . . . , υl), (f1, . . . , fl), (0, . . . , 0)}
.
(14)
The presented combinatorial method for a determination
of conditional transition coefﬁcients σc,S(n) that determine
a possibility of admittance of a call of class c for service in
the occupancy state of n BBUs has been derived with the
assumption that each distribution of free BBUs is treated as
a result of the occupancy of resources by calls that demand 1
BBU [16]. To determine the parameter σc,S(n), this method
uses information on the capacity of individual links, but
does not take into consideration, differences in the size of
resources demanded by particular classes of calls.
Authors in [21] proposes a convolutional method for a
determination of the conditional transition coefﬁcient in
the limited-availability group on the basis of independent
unavailable distributions of BBUs in individual links. This
method takes into consideration the size of required re-
sources demanded by calls of individual trafﬁc classes, but
does not take into consideration link capacities. Comparative
results provided by the studies for both of the methods, i.e.,
the combinatorial and the convolutional method, indicate
their similar accuracy [21].
Observe that in the case of the considered model of the
limited-availability group with multi-service trafﬁc sources
and reservation, the operation of the reservation mechanism
introduces an additional dependence between the service
stream in the system and the current state of the system.
To determine this dependence, the parameter σc,R(n) is
introduced. The parameter σc,R(n) can be calculated using
the following formula:
σc,R(n) =





1
for n ⩽ Qc ∧ c ∈ R,
0
for n > Qc ∧ c ∈ R,
1
for c ̸∈ R.
(15)
The reservation mechanism is introduced to the group
regardless of its structure, which allows us to carry on with
product-form determination of the total coefﬁcient of passing
(transition coefﬁcient) σc,Tot(n) in the generalized model of
limited-availability group:
σc,Tot(n) = σc,S(n) · σc,R(n).
(16)
Having the values of offered trafﬁc AI,i,c, AJ,j,c(n),
AK,k,c(n) and the total coefﬁcient of passing σc,Tot(n) at
our disposal, we are in position to modify the original
Kaufman-Roberts formula [23] [24] in order to determine the
occupancy distribution in the limited-availability group with
multi-service trafﬁc sources and the reservation mechanism:
n[Pn]VL =

sK

k=1
cK,k
X
c=1
AK,k,c(n − tc)σc,Tot(n − tc)tc[Pn−tc]VL,
(17)
where [Pn]VL is the occupancy distribution (the probability
of n busy BBUs) in a system with the capacity VL, and the
parameter σc,Tot(n) determines the additional dependence
between the service stream and the current state of the
system resulting from the speciﬁc structure of the group and
the applied reservation mechanism [25].
Having the values of individual state probabilities [Pn]VL,
determined on the basis of Formula (17), we are in position
to determine the average number of serviced calls of class
c, generated by sources that belong to the sets ZJ,j (Engset
sources) and ZK,k (Pascal sources). For this purpose, we use
the following formulas:
yJ,j,c(n)=





AJ,j,c(n − tc)σc,Tot(n−tc)[Pn−tc]VL/[Pn]VL
for n ⩽ VL,
0,
for n > VL.
(18)
yK,k,c(n)=





AK,k,c(n − tc)σc,Tot(n−tc)[Pn−tc]VL/[Pn]VL
for n ⩽ VL,
0,
for n > VL.
(19)
The knowledge of the occupancy [Pn]VL is required to
determine the parameters yJ,j,c(n) and yK,k,c(n). Whereas,
to determine the occupancy [Pn]VL it is necessary to know
the values of the parameters yJ,j,c(n) and yK,k,c(n). Equa-
tions (18), (19), and (17) form thus a set of confounding
equations. To solve a given set of confounding equations it
is necessary to employ iterative methods [26] [27].
Assuming that the distribution [P (l)
n ]VL is the occupancy
distribution, determined in the l-th iteration, while y(l)
J,j,c(n)
and y(l)
K,k,c(n) deﬁne the average number of serviced calls of
class c generated by trafﬁc sources that belong respectively
to the sets ZJ,j and ZK,k, we can write:
y(l+1)
J,j,c (n)=





A(l)
J,j,c(n−tc)σc,Tot(n−tc)[P (l)
n−tc]VL/[P (l)
n ]VL
for n ⩽ VL,
0,
for n > VL.
(20)
y(l+1)
K,k,c(n)=





A(l)
K,k,c(n−tc)σc,Tot(n−tc)[P (l)

for n ⩽ VL,

for n > VL.

The iteration process, involving Formulas (17), (20), and
(21), terminates when the assumed accuracy ǫ of the iteration
process is reached:
∀0≤n≤V

(23)
In case of the proposed model the assumed accuracy ǫ of
the iteration process is always reached.
Having determined all probabilities σc,Tot(n) as well as the
occupancy distribution [Pn]VL in a limited-availability group
composed of different types of links, we are in position to
proceed with a determination of the blocking probability for
individual trafﬁc classes from the set M = {1, 2, ..., m}.
The blocking state in the generalized limited-availability
group model occurs when none of the links have a sufﬁcient
number of free BBUs to service a call of class c. This means
that each occupancy state n in a link of the type s, such as:
(fs−tc+1 ≤ n ≤ fs), is a blocking state. Possible blocking
states for a trafﬁc stream of class c in a limited-availability
group composed of links of l types can be thus determined
by the following formula:
V −
Xl
s=1 υs(tc − 1) ≤ n ≤ V.
(24)
In addition, in the case of a limited-availability group with
the reservation mechanism, the blocking state also occurs –
for calls of class c – in all occupancy states of the group that
are higher than the reservation limit Qc, i.e., for n > Qc.
On the basis of the determined values of the conditional
transition coefﬁcients σc,Tot(n) and the occupancy distribu-
tion [Qn]V , the blocking probability for calls of class c, that
belong to the set M = {1, 2, ..., m}, can be expressed by
the formula:
Ec =
VL
X
n=0
[Pn]VL [1 − σc,Tot(n)] .

III. MODEL VERIFICATION AND CASE STUDIES
A. Description of the simulator
In order to verify the accuracy of the proposed methods
for analytical determination of the blocking probability
in multi-service systems with the bandwidth reservation
mechanism, the authors built a simulator of their own. The
simulator was written in C++ with the application of the
object-oriented programming rules. The process interaction
approach was adopted as method of choice for simulations
[28]. The devised simulator makes it possible, among other
things, to determine the value of the blocking probability
for individual trafﬁc classes in the generalized limited-
availability group model with the reservation mechanism.

the group structure provide input data to the simulator. In
addition, for each simulated trafﬁc class we give the number
of demanded BBUs, service time and the parameters related
to the introduced reservation mechanism (reservation limits).
We also deﬁne the sets of trafﬁc sources and their type
(Erlang, Engset, Pascal). Finally, we give the average value
of trafﬁc offered to a single BBU of the system.
Thus, to carry out simulation studies of a system with
the capacity VL, composed of z types of links in which a
given type h consists of υh links, while the capacity of a
single link is fh, we are to provide values for the following
parameters that describe trafﬁc classes:
• the number of deﬁned trafﬁc classes m,
• the number of demanded tc BBUs necessary to set up
a connection of class c and the average service time
µ−1
c
of a call of class c,
• the number of sets of trafﬁc classes S,
• the set of trafﬁc sources ZC,s of type C, the number
of classes cC,s that belong to a given set, the share
of ηC,s,c calls of class c in trafﬁc generated by trafﬁc
sources of a given set, and the number NC,s or SC,s
of trafﬁc sources in a given set,
• the set R of trafﬁc classes to which the reservation
mechanism has been introduced,
• the reservation limit Qc deﬁned for calls of class c from
the set R.
In addition, we also give the average trafﬁc a offered to a
single BBU of the system. The mean value of offered trafﬁc
a can be calculated using following equation:
a =

On the basis of the above parameters the intensity λI,i,
γJ,j or γK,k of the occurrence of new calls depending on
the type of a trafﬁc stream is determined in the simulator. In
the case of Engset and Pascal trafﬁc streams, the intensities
γJ,j and γK,k designate the intensity of the appearance of
new calls generated by a single free source. Therefore, the
parameters λI,i, γJ,j and γK,k can be determined on the
basis of the following formulas:
λI,i =

The next parameters that are determined on the basis of For-
mulas (27), (28), and (29) are used then as input parameters
to call generators that are used by particular trafﬁc sources.
The condition for the simulator to end the simulation is the
counted appropriate number of generated calls of the least
active class (with the lowest intensity of call generation).
This number is selected in such a way as to obtain 95%
conﬁdence intervals. The average result of 5 series is then
calculated. In practice, to obtain conﬁdence intervals at the
level of 95% we need 1,000,000 generated calls of the least
active class.
2) Simulation algorithm: The simulation algorithm can
be determined using the following steps:
1) Initial conﬁguration of the simulation model.
2) Checking the end task condition of the simulation. If
the end task condition is fulﬁlled, the simulation is
terminated and the results are returned.
3) Updating of system time until the ﬁrst event from the
list appears.
4) Execution of the ﬁrst event from the list.
5) Removal of the ﬁrst event from the list and return to
Step 2.
Two events have been deﬁned in the simulation model:
appearance of a new call and termination of the call service.
According to the process interaction approach, these events
are serviced by one function. This function has a different
form for each type of Erlang, Engset and Pascal trafﬁc
streams.
The described approach enables us to deﬁne many dif-
ferent trafﬁc classes in the system and to assign them to
different types of the sets of trafﬁc sources. All sources that
generate calls of different trafﬁc classes are to be created in
the initial conﬁguration of the simulation model.
3) Simulation of the system with sets of Erlang sources:
Consider a system in which a set of Erlang trafﬁc sources
ZI,i is deﬁned. The set of trafﬁc classes whose calls can be
generated by sources from the set ZI,i looks as follows:
CI,i = {1, 2, ..., cI,i}. In the initial conﬁguration of the
system, it is necessary to plan ahead the appearance of a
call of class c from the set CI,i. Thus, the function that
executes events that are related to the set of Erlang trafﬁc
sources will have the following form:
1) Planning of the appearance of a new call of class
c according to the exponential distribution with the
intensity λI,i as the parameter. A choice of class c
from the set CI,i on the basis of the parameter ηI,i,c
according to the uniform distribution. Inclusion of the
event on the list.
2) Checking network resources for the purpose of admit-
ting a call for service:
a) Checking if any of the links of the group has at
least tc free BBUs. If not, the call is lost.
b) In the case of classes that belong to the set of
classes R, for which the reservation mechanism
has been introduced, checking the occupancy
state of the system in relation to the reservation
limit Qc. When the occupancy state is higher
than the reservation limit Qc, a call of class c
is lost.
If any of the conditions is not satisﬁed, the next steps
are omitted.
3) Occupation of resources demanded by a call of class
c.
4) Planning (scheduling) of a termination of service
according to the exponential distribution with the
intensity µc as the parameter. Inclusion of the event
on the list.
5) Termination of service and release of resources.
4) Simulation of a system with sets of Engset trafﬁc
sources: Consider now a system in which a set of Engset
trafﬁc sources ZJ,j is deﬁned. The set of trafﬁc classes in
which calls can be generated by NJ,j sources from the set
ZJ,j looks as follows: CJ,j = {1, 2, ..., cJ,j}. In the initial
conﬁguration of the system, it is necessary to plan ahead the
appearance of calls of class c from the set CJ,j, generated
by each of NJ,j sources. Thus, the function that executes
events related to the set of Engset trafﬁc sources will take
on the following form:
1) Checking network resources for the purpose of the
admittance of a call for service:
a) Checking if any of the links of the group has at
least tc free BBUs. If not, the call is lost.
b) In the case of classes that belong to the set R,
for which the reservation mechanism has been
introduced, checking the occupancy state of the
state in relation to the reservation limit Qc. When
the occupancy state is higher than the reservation
limit Qc, a call of class c is lost.
If any of the conditions is not satisﬁed, the simulation
proceeds to Step 5.
2) Occupation of resources demanded by a call of class
c.
3) Planning (Scheduling) of the termination of service
according to the exponential distribution where the
parameter is the intensity µc. Inclusion of the event
on the list.
4) Termination of service and network release.
5) Planning of the appearance of a new call of class c
according to the exponential distribution where the
intensity γJ,j is the parameter. Choice of the class c
from the set CJ,j on the basis of the parameter ηJ,j,c
according to the uniform distribution. Inclusion of the
event on the list.
5) Simulation of a system with Pascal trafﬁc sources:
Consider also a system in which a set of Pascal trafﬁc

sources ZK,k is deﬁned. The set of trafﬁc classes in which
calls can be generated by SK,k sources from the set ZK,k
looks as follows: CK,k = {1, 2, ..., cK,k}. In the initial
conﬁguration of the system, it is necessary to plan ahead the
appearance of calls of class c from the set CK,k, generated
by each of SK,k sources. Thus, the function that executes
events related to the set of Pascal trafﬁc sources will take
on the following form:
1) Planning (scheduling) of the appearance of a new call
of class c according to the exponential distribution
where the parameter is the intensity γK,k. Choice of
class c from the set CK,k on the basis of the parameter
ηK,k,c according to the uniform distribution. Inclusion
of the event on the list.
2) Checking network resources for the purpose of the
admitting a call for service:
a) Checking if any of the links of the group has at
least tc free BBUs. If not, the call is lost.
b) In the case of classes that belong to the set R
classes, for which the reservation mechanism has
been introduced, checking the occupancy state
of the system in relation to the reservation limit
Qc. When the occupancy state is higher than the
reservation limit Qc, a call of class c is lost.
If any of the conditions is not satisﬁed, the next steps
are omitted.
3) Occupation of the resources demanded by a call of
class c.
4) Planning (scheduling) of the termination of service
according to the exponential distribution where the
parameter is the intensity µc. Inclusion of the event
on the list.
5) Addition of a new source related to the admitted call.
Planning of the appearance of a new call of class c
generated by the new trafﬁc source according to the
exponential distribution for which the parameter is the
intensity γK,k. Choice of class c from the set CK,k
on the basis of the parameter ηK,k,c according to the
uniform distribution. Inclusion of the event on the list.
6) Termination of service and resource release.
a) Removal of the source related to the call that
has just been terminated in service (this source
is added at the moment a call is admitted for
service).
b) Removal of the event related to the removed
source.

The results of the research study are presented in Figures
4–10, depending on the value of trafﬁc a offered to a single
BBU. The results of the simulation are shown in the charts in
the form of marks with 95% conﬁdence intervals that have
been calculated according to the t-Student distribution for
the ﬁve series with 1,000,000 calls of each class. For each
of the points of the simulation, the value of the conﬁdence
interval is at least one order lower than the mean value of
the results of the simulation. In many cases, the value of
the simulation interval is lower than the height of the sign
used to indicate the value of the simulation experiment. We
can notice that the results of analytical calculations agree
with the simulation data for both lower and higher trafﬁc
intensities.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK
This article proposes a new method for a calculation of
the occupancy distribution and the blocking probability in
limited-availability systems with multi-service trafﬁc sources
and reservation mechanisms. The method can be used in
modeling connection handoff between cells in cellular sys-
tems [10], as well as in modeling outgoing directions of
switching networks [29]. The proposed method is based on
the iterative algorithm for a determination of the average
value of trafﬁc sources being serviced in particular states

compared with the simulation data, which conﬁrmed high
accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed method is
not complicated and can be easily implemented.
In the further work, we plan to develop analytical models
of the multi-service systems with multi-service sources, in
which different call admission control mechanisms will be
applied, i.e., an analytical model of multi-service networks
with threshold mechanisms and multi-service sources, and
a model of multi-service systems with hysteresis and multi-
service sources.
