Abstract— Augmented-Reality (AR) has already been applied
to many areas and applications, but there is still a lack of
research on the appropriate interface considering the usability
of AR devices. At present, the main input methods of HoloLens
can be classified into two categories: hand (gesture) and
clicker. In this work, participants wear HoloLens and perform
target selection works. We measure the task completion time,
user satisfaction score and error rate to check the effects of the
input methods, button sizes, and distances. The Latin Square
design was used to minimize the effect of the order. Then, a
questionnaire was conducted after each treatment. In this
paper, we compared the performance changes by input
methods, button size, and distance in HoloLens. There was a
significant difference in input method, distance and button
size. Task completion time and user satisfaction were better
with the large button than the small button, and the error rate
was higher with the large button. In task completion time and
user satisfaction, the clicker performed better than the hand.
The task completion time and the user satisfaction were better
in 80 cm and 100 cm than 60 cm.

INTRODUCTION
Augmented-Reality (AR) refers to a computer interface
technology that enables users to perceive mixed images by
combining a virtual world composed of computer graphics
with the real world in the form of virtual reality. Users
interact with computers while manipulating them as virtual
objects by their actions in real-time [1]. AR is already being
used in a wide range of areas, such as education psychology,
entertainment,
retail,
construction,
cultural
heritage,
tourism, etc. with many different applications, such as
training, skill learning, maintenance, repair, quality control,
or safety awareness [2]. Previous studies have conducted
performance evaluations according to the user input method
of AR devices, analyzed the strength and weakness of the
input method, and proposed an improved interface [3].
Research was also conducted to explore various safety
problems that can occur while operating various Internet of
Things (IoT) devices in the Augmented-reality environment,
and to provide design guidelines to prevent them [4]. In the
previous usability study using Virtual-Reality (VR) devices,
large buttons (3° 50′) and small buttons (1° 55′) were found 
to have differences in terms of button input time and error
rate, and the large button was recommended [5]. However,
in the case of AR devices, it was thought that there would be
a difference between the results of VR devices in that the
background behind the buttons is the real world and the
distance between the user's eyes and the button's visible
distance is adjustable, and this research was conducted
because there is still a lack of research on the interface
considering the usability of AR devices. The rest of the
paper is structured as follows. Section II presents the
experimental design. Section III describes the results and
Section IV offers the conclusion and future work.
II.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Participants in our study conducted experiments using
HoloLens, and the task was to repeatedly select targets from
different variances. Participants in the experiment consisted
of people who had no problem with the experiment and
were not familiar with the use of HoloLens.
A.
Participants
The research group consisted of 12 male and 12 female
participants
(Average
age:
21.21
years
old,
Standard
deviation: 1.26) who had no experience in using augmented
reality except smartphone-based augmented reality and had
no physical or visual problems. Participants were recruited
using the university intranet, all Asian, and were given
incentives to encourage participation. 11 of them had
experience using VR devices and 22 of them were right -
handed.
Due to COVID-19, it was difficult to recruit
participants of various age groups, so the participants were
recruited as university students in their 20s.
B.
Apparatus
The experimental device used the HoloLens Development
Edition [6], which can mix holograms with the real world to
make them sound like they are part of the world. The
resolution of the instrument is HD 16:9 light engine and

generates a 2.3M total light point. The HoloLens native user
interface
moves
the
cursor
as
the
head
moves
and
recognizes simple hand gestures within the angle of view of
the camera on the front. The prototype Application runs on
HoloLens and is implemented using Unity [7] and C#.
HoloLens was light and comfortable to wear, easy to use,
provided sufficient computing power, and was studied in
many
areas
[8]. So,
it
was
considered
suitable
for
experimentation.
C.
Tasks
This study repeats the target selection
work, using
HoloLens. Prototypes have a total of nine buttons and exist
in the panel in the form of a 3 x 3 array. There are two sizes
of buttons, and the size of small buttons is set to 1° 55′ 4″
based on the long side of the 3 x 4 keyboard of a
smartphone or feature phone. Microsoft recommended
against ever presenting holograms closer than 40 cm [9]. So,
we constructed the experiment with a distance of 1.5, 2, and
2.5 times the distance of 40 cm. For the large buttons, it is
set to double the small buttons, and the field of view is set
as 3° 49′ 48″ [10] (Figure 1, Table 1). The distance was set 
at 60, 80 and 100 cm (Figure 2), and the subjects conducted
the experiment with two types of input methods: hand and
clicker. The participants repeatedly clicked the button that
turns red among the 9 buttons, and then clicked the button 4
times (Figure 3) for 12 treatment conditions (2 Button sizes
x 3 Distances x 2 Input methods) repeating 5 sets.

Procedure
All
participants
listened
to
the
explanation
of
the
experiment before the experiment, wrote the consent form
and personal information, and pressed the button. Since,
HoloLens is not a familiar equipment to subjects, we
explained how to use it to carry out the experiment
smoothly, went through simple practice, and then proceeded
with this experiment. This experiment consists of a total of
12 treatment conditions, and the experiment was conducted
with Latin square design to prevent learning effects. Each
treatment condition repeats 5 sets of four button selection
tasks, resulting in a total of 240 (12 test conditions x 4
random button selection x 5 sets = 240 tasks). The total time
was less than 90 minutes. After performing each treatment
condition, the subjects were given a break of about two
minutes, and then user satisfaction was evaluated. A five-
point Likert scale was used to evaluate user satisfaction for
each test condition (1-Strongly disagree, 2-Disagree, 3-
Neither agree nor disagree, 4 Agree, 5-Strongly agree). The
subjects could take a rest whenever they wanted, and if they
had difficulty in continuing the experiment, they could give
up
the
experiment.
In

the
experimental
design,

method,
interactions
task
completion time and user satisfaction (Table 2). Tukey’s
range Test (Tukey HSD) was used for post-test, and R, a
programming

and
graphics, was used as an analysis tool.
A. Task Completion Time
2 (Button size) x 3 (Distance) x 2 (Input method) Repeat
Measurement analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed
statistically significant differences in task completion time
among button size, distance, and input method (p<0.000, α 
= 0.05).
Figure 4. Task completion time according to button size
(Error bars refer to standard deviation)
Task completion time for the large button was 1.39 s
(±0.667) and for the small button was 1.73 s (±0.809). The
task completion time was statistically significant in the
button size (p < 0.000, α = 0.05). Longer time was required 
to select the small button (1° 55′ 4″) than the large button
(3° 49′ 48″) (Figure 4).
Figure 5. Task completion time according to distance
(Error bars refer to standard deviation)
Task completion time for distance 60cm was 1.66 s
(±0.906) and for distance 80cm was 1.52 s (±0.738) and for
Distance 100cm was 1.5 s (±0.596). The average task
completion time increased with the distance in the following
order 100cm, 80cm, 60cm. Task completion time was
statistically significant in the distance in A (60 cm) and B
(80 cm,100 cm) (p < 0.000, α = 0.05) (Figure 5). 
Figure 6. Task completion time according to input method
(Error bars refer to standard deviation)
Task completion time for using the clicker was 1.37 s
(±0.488) and for using the hand was 1.75 s (±0.921). The
task completion time was statistically significant in the input
method (p < 0.000, α = 0.05). Longer time was required to 
using the hand than using clicker (Figure 6). In addition,
there were statistically significant differences in interaction
between button size and input method (p < 0.01, α = 0.05), 
interaction between distance and button size (p < 0.000, α = 
0.05), interaction between the distance and input method (p
< 0.000, α = 0.05). There was also a statistically significant 
difference in the interaction of button size, distance, and
input method (p < 0.000, α = 0.05). 
B.
User Satisfaction
2 (Button size) x 3 (Distance) x 2 (Input method) Repeat
Measurement analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed
statistically significant differences in user satisfaction score
among button sizes (p < 0.000, α = 0.05), distances (p < 
0.001, α = 0.05), and input method (p < 0.000, α = 0.05).

Figure 7. User satisfaction according to button size
(Error bars refer to standard deviation)
The user satisfaction score for the large button was 4.40
(±0.778) and for the small button was 3.87 (±1.03). The task
completion time was statistically significant in the button
size (p < 0.000, α = 0.05). The user satisfaction score was 
higher in the large button than in the small button (Figure
7).
Figure 8. User satisfaction according to distance
(Error bars refer to standard deviation)
The user satisfaction score for distance 60 cm was 3.90
(±1.06), for distance 80 cm was 4.23 (±0.923) and for
distance 100 cm was 4.28 (±0.817). The user satisfaction
score was better in the order 100 cm, 80 cm, 60 cm. User
satisfaction score was statistically significant in the distance
in A (60 cm) and B (80 cm, 100 cm) (p < 0.05, α = 0.05) 
(Figure 8).
Figure 9. User satisfaction according to input method
(Error bars refer to standard deviation)
The user satisfaction score for using the hand was 3.85
(±0.978) and for using the clicker was 4.42 (±0.833). The
user satisfaction score was statistically significant in the
input method (p < 0.000, α = 0.05) (Figure 9). In addition, 
there were statistically significant differences in interaction
between button size and distance (p < 0.05, α = 0.05).  
C.
Error rate
2 (Button size) x 3 (Distance) x 2 (Input method) Repeat
Measurement analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed
statistically significant differences in error rate among
button size (p < 0.05, α = 0.05). 
Figure 10. Error rate according to button size
(Error bars refer to standard deviation)
The average error rate for the large button was 0.694%
(±1.83) and for the small button was 0.243% (±1.23). The
error rate was statistically significant in the button size
(p<0.05, α=0.05). There was a higher error rate with the
small button than with the large button (Figure 10). In
Section 3, we described results of task completion time, user
satisfaction, and error rate according to button size, distance,
and input method.
IV.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We compared the performance changes by two input
methods (hand, clicker), two button sizes (large, small), and
three distances (60, 80, 100 cm) in HoloLens. Three factors
(Task completion time, Error rate, User satisfaction) were
measured by conducting experiments on a total of 12
treatment conditions. There were statistically significant
differences in task completion time, user satisfaction and
error rate. Task completion time and user satisfaction were
better in the large button than the small button, and the error
rate was higher in the large button. In task completion time
and user satisfaction, the clicker performed better than the
hand. The task completion time and the user satisfaction
were better in 80 cm and 100 cm than 60 cm. The results of
this study are thought to help determine the appropriate
target distance, size, and input method for AR devices.
However, all participants were in their 20s and there is a
limitation since only three variances (button size, distance,
input method) are considered. In future studies, we would
like to recruit participants of more diverse ages and conduct
experiments with more variances in mind.
