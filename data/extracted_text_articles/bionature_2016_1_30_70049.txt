Abstract—Six water bodies or their complexes - four in Cracow  
and two in the Commune of Niepołomice, Southern Poland - 
were studied focusing the changes they have undergone and 
the present state from the point of view of their attractiveness 
to the visitors. The degree of threat to the water bodies was 
also assessed. The highest grades were given to the ponds of 
Niepołomice (Zamkowa), due its well management. The lowest 
grades were attributed the ponds of Płaszów (also the most 
threatened pond) and Staniątki (probably a temporary 
situation). The least threatened complex of water bodies is the 
one in Przylasek Rusiecki. Two of the described water bodies 
(Dąbie and Staniątki) diminished their area within the last 20 
years and the pond of Płaszów diminished earlier. 
Keywords - water bodies; tourism; chemical analysis; sustainable 
development. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Small and medium size water bodies are habitats often 
subdued to various changes, related both to weather/climate 
fluctuations as well as direct human influence [1]-[5]. They 
can be subdued to drainage as much as polluting factors 
much easier than bigger water bodies.  The region of Cracow 
(in Polish Kraków) is rich in small water bodies [3]-[5]. 
Many of them are human made [5], [6]. Over their longer or 
shorter history they went through different changes in their 
functions and the function of the ecosystems surrounding 
them. One of the important function, apart from small 
retention and ecological function is recreational function. 
This function depends on the natural properties of the water 
body (size, shape of the shoreline) and the way of 
management (facilities, maintenance of the area, etc.) [5]-[8]. 
Another important function is maintaining biodiversity. 
Water bodies attract animals and plants, including rare 
species. This creates opportunities for nature-based tourism 
and increase tourist attractiveness.  
There are two main objectives of this paper: (1) to 
present changes in selected water bodies of Cracow over the 
last two decades and, if possible, also earlier and (2) to 
quantify the assessment of the sites from the point of view of 
sustainable development. The assessed values were tourist 
attractiveness, understood as the amount of features that 
could be attractive to visitors from the point of view of 
leisure and/or sight-seeing (including observations of fauna 
and flora), as well the degree of threat, understood as 
quantified expression of various dangers to the water body. It 
does not necessarily have to be the threat of total 
disappearance of the water body, but also all the factors 
making the water body or its surroundings less attractive or 
diminishing the biodiversity of the area. Section II briefly 
describes the study area. Section III presents the methods of 
the studies. Section IV presents the results of long term 
observations and laboratory analyses. In Section V proposals 
of changes are discussed in the context of social 
responsibility. 
II. 
THE STUDY  AREA 
The water bodies in two communes – the city of Cracow 
and the commune of Niepołomice (Wieliczka District) were 
studied. 
The 
selection 
included 
water 
bodies 
of 
anthropogenic origin. They were the following: 
Ponds situated in the city of Cracow: 
1.  
Staw Płaszowski (the Płaszów Pond) - a 9.0 ha 
borrow pit formed after the exploitation of sand and gravel 
in 1930s. The area of the pond was decreased. In 1975 and 
1965 it had a surface of 9.98 ha and 11.95ha, respectively 
[6]. The diminishing of the surface was due to making an 
open market and then covered market. 
2.  
Bagry – a borrow pit of 30.1 ha, also formed in 
1930s. Used as bathing resort. Its surface did not change 
much. The infrastructure has been improving over the 
years.  
3.  
Staw Dąbski (the Dąbie Pond, 2.1 ha – situated in 
Craców, east from the centre, formed in 1930s after the 
exploitation of clay. Originally, there were more ponds,

but in 1960s they were filled in and only one remained. 
The original area of 2.6 ha has been diminished due to the 
building of the Market and Entertainment Centre (Centrum 
Handlowo-Rozrywkowe) “Plaza” [6]. In 2010 the pond was 
announced Environmentally Useful Area by the City 
Council of Cracow [9]. 
4.  
 Przylasek  Rusiecki – a complex of 10-11 gravel 
borrow pits (the number is changeable, because some 
water bodies can temporarily be joint or separated), of the 
total area of 82.19 ha, situated in the eastern part of 
Cracow, quarter Nowa Huta. One of the ponds makes 
bathing resort.  
5.  
Niepołomice – Zamkowa street - 0.1 ha. The pond 
undergone restoration works in 2005. The shores were 
reinforced with wicker and an islet was formed in the 
middle. However, after a few years the islet submerged. 
Significant changes in the surroundings were also 
observed. The pond was originally an anti-fire reservoir 
and fishing pond. Nowadays fishing is forbidden and the 
pond has a decorative function, as a part of the local 
ethnographic museum [5].  Some changes were illustrated 
in the photographs in Figure 1. 
6.  
Staniątki (the Commune of Niepołomice), Figure 6.  
– two ponds near the Benedictine Convent in  Zagórska 
street , 0.12 and 0.05 ha. Originally, it was one pond, with 
a bigger surface. It served as a fishing pond. Later on it 
was abandoned, but in 1996 the project of management 
was accepted. In 2005 facilities such as a railing and 
teeters were built. They were destroyed due to the 
construction works regarding the neighbouring buildings 
[5].  Changes were illustrated in the photographs in Figure 
1. 
Information about locations is contained in [5]-[8].  
III. 
METHODS 
The following methods were  applied: 
A. Field Observations and Area Measurement 
Study visits were carried out in every location. The 
observations of fauna and flora were made. The area of the 
water bodies was measured based on airborne images 
received from the Polish Central Geodetic and Cartographic 
Resource and calculated by the Quantum GIS program.  
B. Laboratory Analyses 
Laboratory analyses were carried out in October and 
November 2015, at AGH University of Science and 
Technology in Cracow, Faculty of Mining Surveying and 
Environmental Engineering, Laboratory of Department of 
Environmental Management and Protection, led by Ms. 
Marta Nowak-Bator, M.Sc., Eng. The instrument for the 
measurements was photometer PF-12, by AQUA Lab. If 
possible, the results were compared to the earlier results of 
analyses.  
C. Semi-quantative Assessment 
To assess the value (tourist attractiveness) of each water 
body and the way it is threatened, the Saaty method of 
hierarchic analysis [10] was applied to give weight to each 
characteristic (parameter). Namely, the authors had to 
decide, which feature is more and which less important. The 
weights were calculated in such a way that the characteristics 
were compared in pairs and for each pair the decision was 
made in terms of which characteristic was more important. 
The following intensities of importance, for each pair, were 
considered: 1 – equal importance, 3 – moderate importance, 
5 – importance, 7 – very strong importance, 9 – extreme 
importance. Less important characteristics of the less 
important value of each pair took values: 1/3, 1/5, 1/7, 1/9, 
respectively. The calculations were made using the computer 
programme by K. D. Goepel [11]. The values of weights are 
shown in Tables I and II. For each characteristic, grade 1-4 
was given (4 was the highest). All the characteristics 
contribute to the value of tourist attractiveness (leisure and 
sightseeing opportunities) or the degree of threat. Finally the 
following formula was applied:       
 
     n 
       S = ∑   wi xi  
                    i=1 
where: 
S –  final assessment 
xi – assessment of  subsequent parameters 
wi – weights of subsequent parameters 
. 
The parameters (characteristics) were the following: 
1) Facilities: benches, sanitary facilities, restaurants, etc. 
2) Flora and Fauna – species protected by law, 
especially included in the EU Directives 
3) Sports and leisure – swimming, playgrounds etc.  
4) Water – derived from laboratory analyses 
5) Landmarks – points important from historical or 
cultural point of view 
6) Landscape – the easthetic impression about landscape 
7) Management – is the area clean an tidy? 
 
The degree of threat to the water bodies was also 
assessed 
and 
computed 
as 
a 
sum 
the 
following 
characteristics: 
1) Landscape degradation – visual degradation 
2) Transport – the proximity to the road 
3) Drainage or backfilling – to which extent it occurred 
4) Industry – the proximity of industrial plants 
5) Vandalism and littering – amount of litter and damage 
6) Invasion of alien species – number of alien plant 
species, based on observation and previous studies [6] 
The criteria were based on previous papers [3] and [8], but 
modified, according to the specifics of this study.

RESULTS 
The results of laboratory analyses are shown in tables III 
and IV. The values were compared to the Enactment of the 
Minister of Environment [12]. The Figures in bold mean the 
values exceeding the maximum accepted values for the first 
and second class of the water quality in the mentioned 
Enactment. For the conductivity this value is given in 
Enclosure II (values for lakes and reservoirs) and both for 
first and second class must not exceed μS/cm. For other 
values, which are not included in the Enclosure II, values in 
Enclosure I (for rivers and streams) were taken. In most 
cases there was no visible trend in time referring to the 
parameters. There were no bigger changes in pH, which 
ranged from 7.0 (Niepołomice)  to 8.9 (Przylasek Rusiecki). 
Conductivity was the parameter which was exceeded in most 
of the locations. The highest value was in Dąbie in 2008. In 
2015 the value was lower, nevertheless remained high. In all 
the locations conductivity values of 2015 were lower than in 
2008. Chemical analyses showed that the values of nitrates 
were high only in Niepołomice and the highest values of 
phosphates were in Dąbie (in 2003 and 2008). The values of 
chlorides were low, except of Płaszów.  
The analyses of the airborne images and personal 
observations show that over the last 20 years the area of the 
Dąbie Pond and the Staniątki Pond decreased in 1990s and 
the area of the Płaszów pond decreased in 1960s and 1970s. 
 
Observation of animals focused on birds, because they 
have 
the 
greatest 
significance 
for 
amateur 
nature 
observations (bird watchers). The list of animals observed in 
the ponds is given in table V. Species included in the Bird 
Directive and Habitat Directive (Enclosure 1) are marked 
with letters P and D, respectively. The bird included into the 
Bird Directive was the common tern Sterna hirundo, seen on 
the Bagry pond.   
 
The management of the area changed most in Dabie, 
Niepołomice and Staniątki (still undergoing changes). 
 
Table VI shows the values and grades attributed to each 
site, according to the method described in Section III. The 
highest grade can be given to the pond of Niepołomice, 
especially due to very good management. The second grade 
is given to Bagry. The Pond of Dąbie received 3rd grade. The 
maximum assessment of the flora and fauna is not due to 
birds, but due to the presence of the Amur bitterling Rhodeus 
sericeus (Pallas) [13]. The lowest values were received by 
the ponds of Płaszów and Staniątki. In the latter case, the 
area was under construction.  
 
The most threatened pond is the pond of Płaszów. The 
biggest problem there is littering and (to certain extent) 
vandalism. The area is being built up and the pond is not the 
object of interest of the public, so it is subdued to 
degradation. On the second place is the pond of Staniątki, 
nevertheless the present state seems to be temporary. The 
least endangered is the complex of ponds in Przylasek 
Rusiecki. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The study showed that the water bodies of Dąbie, 
Staniątki and Staniątki were undergoing big changes, 
especially in the state of management. Unfortunately one can 
fear that if the area is “too well managed” (reed regularly 
cut) the habitat for the birds nesting in the reed (e.g., 
moorhen) will be destroyed.  
The water bodies of Dąbie and Staniątki diminished their 
area within the last 20 years and the pond of Płaszów 
diminished in 1960s and 1970s. Other ponds did not change 
much in surface, but there were changes in the management 
of the surrounding area.  
In the commune of Niepołomice (ponds of Niepołomice 
and Staniątki), the biggest improvement in the aesthetics of 
the area was carried out in 2005. Some of these changes 
were not long lasting, though. 
The highest differences in the assessment of water bodies 
were observed in the facilities provided and the management. 
The smallest differences were referring to landscape. 
The water bodies can contribute to sustainable tourism as 
well as economic development of the area. Nevertheless, in 
some cases (Płaszów, Staniątki) their potential is not fully 
used. The improvement in the management is highly 
recommended. This should include cleaning as well as 
putting information tables about the flora and fauna.
