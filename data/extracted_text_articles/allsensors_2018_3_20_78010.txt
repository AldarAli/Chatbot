Abstract—In our previous work, we developed the concept and 
tested the viability of fabricating a 16-element chemosensitive 
resistor array for detection and recognition of volatile organic 
compounds. The sensing elements were fabricated using blends 
of Carbon Black (CB) and Gas Chromatography (GC) 
stationary-phase materials by coating over chemosensitive 
resistor devices. In this work, we extend our basic study with 
an ongoing attempt at optimizing the performance of our 
developed 16-element array versus vapors of pyrrole, benzenal, 
nonanal, and 2-phenethylamine. Our main concern here was 
studying the percolation threshold and aging of the sensing 
devices. The results indicate that the best performance of the 
fabricated sensing devices can be expected for sensing films 
with CB to GC-material ratio of 1.5:1 to 2:1. Sensing devices 
coated with blends of such composition performed in a 
relatively similar manner right after fabrication and after 
around 5-month long aging at room temperature.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Biological olfaction can be regarded as a powerful tool, 
acquiring and analyzing airborne chemical information [1]. 
The sense of smell has been widely applied in numerous 
fields for either expert or non-expert evaluations, using 
techniques of sensory analysis [2]. In certain cases, the 
sensory analysis has been supported by instrumental 
analytical methods such as spectroscopy or chromatography 
[3]. However, the use of both sensory and instrumental 
analyses is seriously limited by their cost, time and lack of 
mobility. A still relatively novel field of instrumental 
analysis called artificial olfaction has emerged as a 
promising and attractive alternative to the above analytical 
techniques [4][5]. 
The biological sense of smell can be generally 
represented as consisting of two general stages: (i) receptive 
- olfactory receptors, and (ii) processing - olfactory bulb and 
the subsequent stages of olfactory cortex. Mimicking that 
general configuration, the electronic noses consist of a 
sensing stage (chemical, gas/vapor sensors) and a signal 
preprocessing/processing stage (various pattern recognition 
and classification techniques).  
The gas/vapor sensors used in the artificial olfaction 
applications need to be non-specific, i.e., respond to groups 
of odorants rather than a particular one. Responses of such 
non-specific sensors’ arrays are then processed using various 
pattern recognition techniques – from quite simple principal 
component or linear discriminant analyses to neural 
networks [6]-[10].  
Electronic nose systems and their components are 
intensively studied with a number of successful attempts at 
their application ranging from food and beverage industries 
to environmental monitoring to medical diagnostics [11]-
[17]. 
The chemical sensors used in the electronic nose systems 
can be classified in the following manner: Metal Oxide 
Semiconductor (MOS), Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-
Effect Transistor (MOSFET), calorimetric, optical, Quartz 
Crystal Microbalance (QCM), Surface Acoustic Wave 
(SAW), 
conducting 
polymer, 
and 
carbon 
material 
composites (carbon nanotubes or carbon black particles) 
[14][18]-[20].  
The carbon material composites sensors, often called 
volumetric sensors, have a number of features that make 
them great candidates for the artificial olfaction applications. 
Among them, one can list a relatively simple structure, ease 
of fabrication and customization, as well as potential 
miniaturization that seems perfect for creation of large sensor 
arrays [21]-[24]. Such sensors are typically composed of two 
electrodes and an analyte-interactive film capable of 
changing its volume upon sorption of analytes. The film has 
to be electrically conductive, which is usually realized by 
application of either intrinsically conductive materials or 
composites/blends of conductive particles (e.g., carbon black 
or zinc oxide) with sorptive, insulating materials [25]-[28] 
In our previous work, we presented our basic study on 
selection and application of GC stationary phase materials as

composites used in chemosensitive resistor-based odor 
sensors [29]. An important issue concerning performance of 
the chemosensitive resistors is a relation between the carbon 
black content in carbon black–organic polymer composites 
and resistivity of such composite described by percolation 
theory [27]. Briefly, the composite is effectively an insulator 
at low carbon black content. Increasing the amount of carbon 
black results in decreasing resistivity of the composite, 
which is gradual until a sharp transition occurs in which the 
resistivity of the composite can fall dramatically (by up to 10 
orders of magnitude) with a small variation in the carbon 
black concentration. At this transition point, designated as 
the percolation threshold, a connected pathway of carbon 
black particles is formed.  
In the present work, we focused on two topics important 
from the standpoint of the ongoing optimization of the 
composites of GC-material with carbon black particles, 
namely: (i) evaluation of aging of the fabricated sensitive 
devices, and (ii) evaluation of the percolation threshold 
conditions for 16 composite materials described in our basic 
study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The chemosensitive resistors used in this work were 16-
channel 
microdevices 
fabricated 
on 
a 
p-type 
Si 
monocrystalline substrates (8 × 8 mm2). Two platinum 
electrodes were formed as concentric circles using a photo 
lithography process. The distance between the electrodes 
was 50 µm to 280 µm. Schematic representation of the 16-
channel device is shown in Figure 1. All devices were 
fabricated by Panasonic.  
The carbon black particles were mixed with the GC 
materials dissolved in DMSO (Dimethylsulfoxide) or 
DMSO/MeCN. Concentration of the GC materials in each 
composite was 10 mg/mL. Concentration of carbon black 
was 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 mg/mL.

resistor device used in this study. The numbers refer to Table I. 
The GC materials used in this study are listed in Table I. 
Materials 1, 3 and 11 were obtained from GL Sciences 
Japan. Materials 2 and 10 were obtained from Tokyo Kasei. 
Materials 4, 5 7, 8, 9, 12 and 16 were purchased from Sigma 
Aldrich. Lastly, materials 6, 13, 14 and 15 were obtained 
from Shimadzu. All materials were used as obtained. 
Conductive carbon black particles (graphite carbon black) 
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 
The composites were coated as a circle mark using a 
customized automatic spotting machine with a microsyringe. 
The volume of the ejected solvents was 25 nL. The ejections 
were carried out 4 times for each mark. The diameter of a 
spotted mark was 950 µm while the thickness of the 
deposited film was typically 700–800 nm. 
The fabricated sensors were evaluated in exposure 
experiments 
using 
nonanal, 
benzaldehyde, 
2-
phenethylamine, and pyrrole. The samples were purchased 
from Tokyo Kasei Co. and Sigma-Aldrich and were used as 
obtained. 
The exposure experiments consisted of 60 s exposure to 
carrier gas, followed by alternating 60 s exposures to analyte 
vapor and carrier gas (recovery phase). Each sensor was 
exposed thrice to analytes presented at 4 concentration levels 
(i.e., total of 12 exposures = 4 concentration levels × 3 
exposures at each level).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The chemosensitive resistor sensors were initially 
evaluated in the exposure experiments carried out within 48h 
after fabrication. Prior to the evaluation, each fabricated 
sensing device was first conditioned in the atmosphere of dry 
nitrogen for 24h. After that, each device was exposed to the 
odorant samples.  
A. Aging Effect 
Evaluation of the aging effect was carried out on the 
basis of the exposure experiments using pyrrole in dry 
nitrogen, right after fabrication and after 5-month aging. Two 
characteristics of each sensing element were compared: S/N 
ratios and responses at 1.8 ppm. The Signal level (S) was 
calculated as a response to pyrrole at 1 ppm while the Noise 
level (N) was the response recorded for the carrier gas only. 
The results are shown in Figure 2. 
As can be seen, responses of nearly all sensing elements 
decreased to some extent after 5-month aging period 
(exception being the PEG4k composite at channel 13). 
Interestingly, however, evolution of the S/N ratio values 
formed quite a different pattern, with a number of materials 
exhibiting higher values after aging – most apparent in case 
of UCON, PEG and FFAP materials (channels 6, 13, 14, 15 
and 16, respectively). 
This ostensible discrepancy is associated with a large 
decrease of the noise level for those sensing elements and 
indicates enhanced stability of the coated composite 
materials after aging. Obviously, such a development would 
be of a great benefit for the potential application of the 
studied sensing devices, although further work is required to 
accurately model the actual evolution of the evaluated 
characteristics.  
B. Percolation Threshold 
Evaluation of the percolation threshold was carried out 
using the sensing devices with the composites composed of 
GC materials at a constant 10 mg/mL concentration and 
varying content of the carbon black particles. According to 
theory, increasing the content of the conducting constituent 
(carbon black) should result in decreasing resistivity – 
initially gradual, and very sharp when the percolation 
threshold is reached. Figure 3 shows the results of the 
resistance measurements for each sensing composite material 
with varying content of the carbon black particles. With the 
exception of PES, all the composites exhibited a dramatic 
increase of resistivity for the carbon black concentrations in 
the range of 15-20 mg/mL. Again, theoretically, that 
dramatic increase indicates formation of the connected 
pathway of carbon black within the GC material matrix. 
In order to validate that claim we measured responses of 
the sensing devices with carbon black content within 5-20 
mg/mL concentration range to odorant samples at ca. 1.8 
ppm. The results of those experiments are shown in Figure 4. 
As can be seen, the highest magnitude of responses was 
recorded for the composite with the carbon black 
concentration of 15 mg/mL. That content level has been 
tentatively assumed as optimal and is being verified in the 
ongoing experiments.

(“initial”) and after 5 months of aging at room temperature: (a) S/N Ratio, 
(b) responses to Pyrrole at ca. 1.8 ppm.

CONCLUSION 
The present work describes our ongoing study aiming at 
optimization of the 16-channel chemosensitive resistor 
devices with composites of GC materials and carbon black 
particles toward sensing of odorant vapors. We focused on 
two important factors pertaining to optimization – the 
percolation threshold and aging. The results obtained so far 
indicate that in case of composite materials selected in our 
work, the percolation threshold can be expected for the ratios 
of carbon black to GC material within the 1.5:1 to 2:1 range. 
The initial validation of those values by means of exposure 
to the odorant samples indicated that the best sensing 
characteristics can be expected for the ratio of ca. 1.5:1. The 
results of the exposure experiments performed within 48h 
and 5 months after fabrication of the sensing devices indicate 
that the aging effect can be of two-fold nature – the decrease 
of the sensor response magnitude accompanied by a slight to 
significant enhancement of the S/N ratio, most likely 
associated with the enhanced stability of the composites. The 
studies are being continued and their results will be 
presented in the future.
