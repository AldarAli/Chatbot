Abstract— Analyzing topics of interest from online discourse 
can be challenging. One well-known approach is to conduct 
topic modeling to study the topics of interest. In this paper, we 
use a multi-method analytical framework to analyze topics in 
addition to characterizing their influence. We analyze 20,066 
blog posts and 10,113 comments from July 2019 through 
December 2020 that deal with diplomacy, defense, trade, and 
election related topics surrounding Australia and China. Our 
results show that COVID-19 discourse absorbs much of the 
attention of bloggers during the time period considered, even 
though no COVID-related keywords were incorporated in the 
data collection. Our findings suggest that a topic can be 
influential even when it is not trending and vice-versa. It also 
showed that Australian bloggers were dominant and discussed 
the topics of interest compared to Russian and US bloggers. The 
Australian blogosphere simultaneously discussed climate 
change along with defense related topics, and they prefer to give 
attention to long-term topics over short-term topics. Finally, 
popular election topics in Australian blogosphere tend to have a 
more analytical tone in the text.  
Keywords-COVID-19; Australia; China; trade war; election; 
South China Sea; Indo pacific; influence. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The increasing proliferation of social media provides 
tremendous opportunities for gaining situational awareness to 
assist with strategic policy making, particularly in security, 
defense, and foreign policy. However, social media data are 
often riddled with challenges such as high volume and 
velocity, noisy data, missing data, and incomplete data. 
Analysis of trending topics, influential topics, and key 
influencers, afford computational, systematic, and rigorous 
methods to study big social media data and surmount these 
challenges [1][2]. The benefits of identifying trending and 
influential content from social media are already evident:  
they are often discourse-movers and key indicators that are 
worthy of additional attention. Identifying these contents can 
help stakeholders to better understand the key issues and 
detect, analyze, and monitor new trends by focusing on 
content generators. Significant previous work has offered 
solutions but primarily focused on developing single method 
analysis to solve the issue of accessing relevant information 
[3][4]. However, by considering the nature of real-world 
online discourse, we argue that usage of a single method or a 
tool is limited and instead a multi-method integrated 
analytical framework can yield multifaceted information well 
suited for the complex objective oriented studies [5][6].  
In this paper, we therefore present a framework to build 
an interchangeable multimethod analysis with available 
methods and computational tools to study relevant 
information or topics of interest from the targeted online 
discourse. We turn to the blogosphere discourse related to 
defense, trade, diplomacy, and elections surrounding 
Australia and China between July 1, 2019, to December 31, 
2020 as a case study due to growing diplomatic dispute with 
USA at the center of the narratives [16][17]. Our research 
contributes to the growing body of literature on social media 
analytics to access core, relevant, and influential information 
from trending online discourse. This illustrative study offers 
guidelines and strategies for policy makers to identify and 
monitor key actors from the influential discourse and address 
the key concerns that may need attention. 
The subsequent sections in this paper are arranged as 
follows. First in section II, we review prior work on natural 
language processing, influential blogposts, dynamic network 
analysis and explain how they can be employed in a 
complementary way tailored toward multiple facets of 
situational awareness information. In section III, following 
an overview of the data collection, we summarize how each 
component of our proposed pipeline maps to our blog dataset. 
Finally, we present the results of our integrated analysis, 
assessing topics and their influence trends, the narrative they 
spread, and their core influential bloggers in the overall 
online discourse in section IV. With our findings, we 
concretely demonstrate how our integrated multimethod 
analytical framework can refine trending influential topics 
and bloggers through gathering and triangulation of different 
streams of analysis. We conclude with a discussion of 
enhancing methodological frameworks for situational 
awareness information from blogs in section V.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Ever-growing scholarship has studied how to monitor 
trending information and their influential operators with 
notable success. In this section, we present a review of this 
literature, highlighting methodologies and gaps in the current 
state of research on blog analysis.   
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic 
generative model that is used to extract topics from a corpus 
of text documents. While other distributional semantic 
models can be used to learn latent features from text, the 
latent features, or topics, that LDA learns tend to be more 
interpretable by humans than other methods. The topics are 
14

SOTICS 2021 : The Eleventh International Conference on Social Media Technologies, Communication, and Informatics

represented as probability distributions over words, since the 
topics that LDA learns are in the form of probability 
distributions over the vocabulary of a corpus, reflecting the 
probability of each word within each topic [7]. Other topic 
models have been proposed that capture how the topics are 
spread out in corpus by extracting key information relevant 
to time of interest [8].  
However, even if the dominant or main topics are trending 
in the blogosphere during a certain period it is not necessary 
that they are also influential. Researchers have formulated 
influence as a factor of four parameters:  Recognition, 
Activity generation, Novelty, and Eloquence [9]. A topic may 
become influential when a blogger posts content that attracts 
participation and recognition. Identification of influential 
topics is therefore important to our multimethod approach.  
Finally, we are also interested in the bloggers that posted 
influential content and asking if they share the same interest 
in different topics. Influential bloggers prefer to join forces 
and work in closely interconnected networks. They build 
their own interest groups, where they gather support, initiate 
socio-political discussions, and spread awareness [1]. We 
leverage previously published work to identify a network of 
core users from online information operations using 
Organization Risk Analyzer (ORA) [10]. ORA enables 
analysis of multi-modal networks to shed light on the core 
influential bloggers that participated in multiple topics.  
In this paper, we demonstrate that our multimethod 
analysis pipeline can provide comprehensive and relevant 
insights on influential trending topics and users from the 
topics of interest in the blogosphere. Past studies have shown 
how accessing situational awareness information requires a 
multimethod analysis model for comprehensive insights 
[11][12]. Our proposed framework consists of a multimethod 
analysis using topic modeling and influence analysis in 
parallel to discover key insights from blog data. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
In this section, we describe the data used for the study and 
our research methodology. 
A. Data Collection 
We collected the data using a set of keywords provided by 
subject matter experts at the University of Sydney and 
Australian Department of Defense. Relevant keywords were 
identified by an iterative cycle of studying coverage related 
to diplomatic, defense, trade, and election news between 
Australia and China. News coverage was reviewed from a 
sample of news articles published between January 1 and 
April 30 of 2020, which constituted the first step of the search 
string. Further reviews of the coverage provided additional 
keywords to enhance the inclusiveness. The finalized set of 
keywords used in the study were ‘Australia’, ‘China’, ‘South 
China Sea’, ‘Military Region’, ‘Fight’, ‘Tensions’, 
‘Election’, ‘India’ ‘Road Belt Initiative’, ‘Thai’, ‘Defence’ 
‘Defense’ ‘Indo pacific’, ‘Asia Pacific’.   
We then deployed an in-house custom web crawler that 
invokes Google Custom Search API to collect the URLs that 
have the required keywords in their articles [13]. Since this 
study focuses on blogs, we initially targeted the sites known 
to host blogs, such as blogpost.com, wordpress.com and 
livejournal.com. We then deployed the crawler on blogrolls 
obtained from these platforms to target sites that are outside 
the initial searched domains.  
We collected data for 18 months starting from July 1, 
2019, to December 31, 2020, and curated 20,066 relevant 
blog posts in total. We found that the data set yielded many 
COVID-19 related articles, which in turn skewed away our 
analysis from the topic of interest. Therefore, we divided the 
data into two groups to study the effect of COVID-19 over 
the blog discourse separately: 1) a dataset including all 
20,066 blog posts (i.e., All data) and 2) a dataset that excludes 
any COVID-19 related data (i.e., No COVID data), 
consisting of 10,113 blog posts. We performed a trial-and-
error method to identify required COVID-19 related terms in 
‘All data’ and used the following keywords ‘+Australia - 
(covid covid-19 coronavirus pandemic vaccine)’ to exclude 
the related posts. 
Table I shows the high-level statistics. The data is 
available for public use through the BlogTracker application 
[14][15].

B. Topic modeling 
In order to identify the primary themes of the blog posts, 
we trained two LDA models. One model was trained on the 
All data set and a second model was trained on the No 
COVID data set. Prior to model training, basic preprocessing 
was performed on the text including the removal of stop-
words and punctuation. Each model was specified to have 
five topics. After training, we interpreted the five topics in 
each data set based on the highest-probability words in each 
and by reading exemplar blog posts for each topic. 
C. Influence 
Influence of a blogpost can be visualized as an influence 
graph or i-graph, where influence flows through the nodes for 
any given blogpost and each node of a single blogpost in an 
i-graph is characterized by four variables: 1) Recognition 
(number of in-links, represented by ι), 2) Activity generation 
(number of comments, represented by 𝛾 ), 3) Novelty 
(number of outlinks, represented by 𝜃), and 4) Eloquence 
(length of the blogpost, represented by λ)  [9].  In a directed 
i-graph, if 𝑓(𝑥) denotes the influence flow of a blogpost x 
15

SOTICS 2021 : The Eleventh International Conference on Social Media Technologies, Communication, and Informatics

with I being the influence of x. The influence of each blogpost 
𝐼(𝑥), can be calculated as 
 
 𝐼(𝑥) =  𝑤(𝜆) × . 𝑤!"#𝛾$ +  𝑓(𝑥)0 
(1) 
where 𝑤(𝜆) represents the weight of the blogpost length and 
𝑤!"#𝛾$  represents the weight of the total number of 
comments from blogpost x. 𝑓(𝑥) is defined as 
 
 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑤%& ∑
𝐼(𝑥#) − 𝑤"'(
|*|
#+,
∑
𝐼(𝑥&)
|-|
&+,
 
(2) 
where 𝑤%&  and 𝑤"'(  are the weights of the incoming and 
outgoing influence, 𝑥# is the number of incoming links to 
blogpost 𝑥, and 𝑥& is the number of outgoing links of 𝑥. The 
total number of inlinks and outlinks of  𝑥 are denoted by |𝜄| 
and|𝜃| respectively.  
As defined in (2), 𝑓(𝑥) measures the difference between 
total incoming links and total outgoing links of blogpost 𝑥. 
We calculated these four variables from the collected 
blogposts and calculated the influence of each post as defined 
in (1). We then mapped the influence scores to the respective 
topics to generate influence trends for each topic. To do so, 
we multiplied the influence score I(x) of each blogpost with 
the topic density (p) score of each blogpost p(topic|blogpost). 
 
 𝑚(𝑥) = 𝐼(𝑥) × 𝑝(𝑡𝑜𝑝𝑖𝑐|𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡) 
(3) 
where, 𝑚(𝑥) is the product value for each blogpost. Next, we 
calculated the mean 𝑚(𝑥, 𝑡) of each topic for all posts during 
a given time-period (𝑡) to get the average influence of each 
topic.  
In the next section, we explain our results in the following 
sequence: 
• Conduct topic modeling to identify themes and trends of 
the discourse in blogosphere qualitatively. 
• Assess influence of the identified topics over the period. 
• Extracted network of closely connected bloggers from the 
identified topics and their influence scores to evaluate 
their interest in various topics. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
The highest probability words in the five topics trained on 
All Data can be seen in Table II. Topics 0, 1, and 2 primarily 
focuses on Australia and China, whereas topics 3 and 4 
focuses on COVID-19 and USA politics, accounting for 44% 
of the posts. Similarly, the highest probability words from the 
five topics learned from the No COVID dataset are given in 
Table III. Our following results focus only on topics relevant 
to our interests. 
 
A. South China Sea, China, Australia, USA, Defense 
tension 
Discourse in this theme focuses on topics such as the 
Quad alliance [16] and New Silk Road [17]. Content from 
topic 2 is a crossover between Quad alliance and climate 
change issues. It discusses Quad by embedding it in a broader 
context related to Pacific Island foreign policies. Many of 
these posts simply described the ongoing activities in the 
South China Sea and Indo-Pacific region. Others were 
divided based on their stance and opinions on China’s actions 
in the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific region. We observed 
there were five types of blogposts in this theme: 1) Pro-
Australia 2) Pro-China 3) Military and Technology 4) Critical 
towards Australia government 5) News carrier.  Topic 1 from 
‘All Data’ and topic 3 from ‘No COVID data’ maintained a 
low profile in 2019 (see Figures 3 and 4) and were not very 
influential even though these topics were trending in 2019 
(see Figures 1 and 2). In other words, bloggers may be 
actively posting or publishing blogs on certain topics but may 
not gain enough traction to trigger the required influence 
parameters [9]. We observe the opposite scenario with topic 
2 in 2019, which further indicates that a topic can be 
influential without trending.

Most of the influential content were produced in May, 
November, and December of 2020. In May 2020, blogposts 
extensively published about the Hong Kong protests 
regarding security law and raised concerns about a possible 
exodus of Hongkongers to Australia, New Zealand,

Malaysia, or Taiwan. In November 2020, influential 
blogposts mocked the Australian Elite Special Forces in the 
killing of Afghans. We noticed much of this influential 
content was posted by Russian bloggers. In December 2020, 
influential content expressed disdain for participants in the 
Quad exercise such as Japan and Australia and suggested they 
will denigrate the relation with Pacific Islanders.

B. Climate change, Economy and Trade 
Most of the content in this theme were produced during 
Australia’s bushfire incident in January 2020 and trade 
tension from April through December of 2020. We found 
blogposts on bushfires to engage in climate change denial and 
conspiracy theories. Influential blogposts in both periods 
were largely limited to climate change and renewable 
energies, discussed by the Australian blogosphere even 
though Australia experienced a recession for the first time in 
2020 after nearly thirty years [18] and experienced a trade 
war with China [19]. The only influential conversation on 
trade war occurred in topic 1 in December 2020, and content 
during this period criticized the Australian government for its 
trade relations towards China. It appeared the online public-
sphere preferred discussion on climate change over the 
economy and trade war. This reinforces findings from 
previous studies that the Australian blogosphere considers 
certain topics as long-term and short-term issues [20]. In this 
case, climate change is a long-term issue, and the economy 
and trade war are short-term issues. 
 
C. Federal and Regional elections in Australia 
The Australian election theme appeared to trend low 
compared to the rest of the topics (see Figures 1 and 2). 
However, it was influential in both 2019 and 2020. In 2019, 
the discourse was primarily about the labor party defeat in the 
May 2019 election including discussions about political 
studies on the election. The aim of these discussions was to 
identify why the Labor party failed to appeal to the Australian 
public with extensive analysis. A possible explanation for 
these influential topics is that readers prefer comprehensive 
analysis from blogs. In November 2020, influential content 
(see Figures 3 and 4) discussed the Queensland election and 
included articles that compared the candidates from various 
parties based on the policies they support and the likelihood 
of their win. We also found blogposts with live election 
updates were less influential than the blogposts that provide 
analysis on election news.

D. Topics and Blogger Network 
A network analysis of the top bloggers and their usage of  
topics provides insights on which bloggers share interest in 
the same topics. Figure 5 depicts the clusters of bloggers in 
each topic and network shows the bloggers who blogged in 
five topics from ‘All data’. Similarly, Figure 6 network shows 
the bloggers and the topics they belong to in ‘No COVID 
data’. We found both topics 1 and 2 from ‘All data’ and topics 
3 and 1 from ‘No COVID data’ appeared to have a large 
number of bloggers in their respective networks, indicating a 
good number of bloggers in both data discussed diplomacy, 
defense, and trade related topics. However, the cluster of 
bloggers in the election’s topic were comparatively less in 
both data groups aligning with our findings related to theme 
‘c’ that not many bloggers were active in the election related 
topic and therefore produced a smaller number of blogposts 
compared to other topics. 
Networks from both groups also show a cluster of bloggers 
in the center of the network who contributed to multiple 
topics, indicating that the core bloggers actively participated 
in all five topics. We wanted to examine the influence of 
these core bloggers and extracted them by folding the 
networks based on top valued links. In Figure 7(a) network 
shows two bloggers contributed to multiple topics from ‘All 
data’ based on their edge color. Black nodes represent 
bloggers, while orange edges represent four topics and red 
edges represent five topics. Similarly, 7(b) from ‘No COVID 
data’ shows the connection between two bloggers in three 
topics, four topics and five topics, where the edges is blue, 
green and red.

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 
 
In this research, our multi-faceted integrated analysis 
offers a multidimensional view on blog discourse 
surrounding Australian defense related topics. Our analysis 
provides several useful insights. We determined the 
Australian bloggers were the major discourse movers and 
produced trending, influential content on defense and climate 
change related topics. These bloggers' opinions and stance on 
defense related topics were mostly pro-Australia and 
disapproved of China's military activities in the South China 
Sea. Additionally, we identified climate change content 
largely in denial of climate change and espousing conspiracy 
theories around renewable energy.  
 
We observed that, even though a topic was trending at a 
certain period, it was not necessarily influential at the same 
time. We also captured the behavior pattern of the Australian 
blogosphere during election that influential content tends to 
have analytical tone. Additionally, we found that COVID-19 
was influential only for a short period of time in the 
blogosphere despite it being a global health crisis. Further, 
COVID-19 topic did not gain much traction in the blog 
discourse compared to the defense and climate change topics. 
This may indicate that the blogosphere considers COVID-19 
as a short-term issue and defense and climate change topics 
as long-term issues. This observation can be investigated in 
future work to study bloggers’ preferences. Addition, 
exploration can be done to see whether there is harmonization 
over transcontinental social communities, in terms of 
“igniters”, “followers”, and “passive consumers” that can 
help various governmental or security agencies to monitor 
key influencers. Further, an in-depth analysis of the 
relationship between topical trends and their influence is 
warranted based on the findings.
