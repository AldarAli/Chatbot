Abstract—Smoking cessation or successful quitting depends a lot 
on one of its identified crucial factors - motivation. The PRIME 
Theory of Motivation has listed five motivation domains in the 
human motivational system.  These are Plans, Responses, 
Impulses, Motives and Evaluations. For the purpose of this study, 
Persuasive Multimedia Application (PMA) has been produced 
and used as a learning and persuasion approach through the use 
of Persuasive Technology. PMA has adopted a cause-and-effect 
principle from Persuasive Technology as a learning strategy at 
the macro-persuasion level, and Multimedia and Redundancy 
principles draw from Mayer’s Multimedia Learning Principles as 
a design strategy at the micro-persuasion level. A total of 54 
respondents have been selected and have undergone a 2x2 quasi-
experimental research design experiment. Considering the 
limitations of this study, only three selected PRIME domains in 
the form of Plans, Evaluations and Motives were measured by 
using an instrument adapted from the PRIME questionnaires 
and later analyzed using IBM SPSS 20. The results of the study 
prove that the PMA developed by using the cause-and-effect 
principle, specifically one in the Multimedia and Redundancy 
mode (Mode B), has produced a significant impact on motivation 
towards smoking cessation, especially in terms of the evaluations 
domain.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
Teenagers or adolescents are defined as individuals in the 
10 – 19 year age group according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) and the Canadian Paediatric Society [1]. 
WHO [13] added that there are more than 1.1 billion 
adolescents worldwide, and 85% of them live in developing 
countries. Heikkinen et al. [4] stated that smoking is 
associated with other types of unhealthy behaviours such as 
alcohol consumption. Thus, all efforts to control smoking are 
worthwhile, especially when intervention programmers have 
not paid attention to smoking cessation among adolescents [4]. 
     In the United States, tobacco use remains the leading cause 
of death, although its use is voluntary [12]. Research has 
proved that smokers, who quit, live longer than those who 
continue to smoke and those who receive intensive treatment 
receive a mortality benefit.  
The article is structured as follow: Section 2 will discuss the 
related research. Section 3 will define and discuss the concept 
of a behaviour and motivation support system. Section 4 will 
discuss the methodology employed in the research. Section 5 
will present the data analysis. Section 6 will discuss the 
finding. Section 7 will discuss the research implications. 
Finally, section 8 will suggest the future research directions.  
 
II. 
BACKGROUND TO THE PROBLEM 
 
In their official website the World Health Organization 
(WHO) has also said that 80,000 and 100,000 children 
worldwide start smoking every day, and roughly half of them 
are from Asia [6]. About 50 teenagers in Malaysia below the 
age of 18 start smoking everyday according to a survey 
conducted by the Malaysia Ministry of Health (MOH) (2003) 
even after the ‘Tak Nak’ (Say No) campaign. 
      In 2003, the United States Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) found that motivation and readiness to quit 
smoking are among predictors of successful quitting. They 
have also found from self-reports that 41% of current smokers 
(20.2 million) had tried to quit smoking for 1 or more days 
within the previous 12 months. Many smokers who try to quit 
cite a desire to improve their health as the main reason. 
     Parkinson et al. [8] also stated that beliefs about smoking 
are important predictors of smoking behaviour among youth. 
West [9] has also stated that human being’s motive for doing 
something (including smoking) depends on his/her beliefs, or 
what he refers to as the ‘Evaluations’ domain in PRIME 
Theory. 
     Therefore, developing innovative and effective approaches 
to control tobacco use among youth, through both prevention 
and cessation strategies, remains a high public health priority 
[6]. Parkinson et al. [8] also suggested that anti-smoking 
media may be an important means of targeting beliefs about 
smoking among youth, especially when they often respond 
defensively to messages that threaten their lifestyle, attributes 
and prospects [5]. 
 
III. 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY 
Persuasive Technology is defined as any interactive 
computing system designed to change people’s attitudes or 
behaviours [3]. Therefore, it has created a space for the 
development and the implementation of a Persuasive 
Multimedia Application which aims to increase motivation 
with regard to smoking prevention and cessation among 
teenagers. 
Previous studies that have used this technology showed that 
Persuasive Technology is capable of changing people’s 
attitudes or behaviour in terms of the expected attitudes or

behaviour. Hence, this study will produce a persuasive 
multimedia application that will contribute to the current 
efforts of the Malaysia Ministry of Health (MOH), the 
Malaysia Ministry of Education (MOE), the Malaysia Ministry 
of Youth and Sports and, especially, parents and teenage 
smokers themselves. 
This PMA has being designed and developed based on 
Multimedia 
Learning 
Principles 
[7] 
and 
Persuasive 
Technology [3]. The finding will help to enlighten other 
researchers about which of the multimedia presentation 
elements (words, images or both) and Persuasive Principles 
work best in increasing teenagers’ motivation with regard to 
smoking cessation, and then impacting on their smoking 
behaviour after gaining enough knowledge and motivation 
through persuasion. 
 
IV. 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
Two theoretical foundations of this study are the design and 
development of the PMA, which is based on Persuasive 
Technology [3], and Multimedia Learning Principles [2] and 
the use of PRIME Theory [10][11] to explain human 
motivational systems. 
The theoretical foundations can be interpreted in terms of 
the following conceptual framework (Fig. 1): 
 
Figure 1.  Conceptual Framework 
Persuasive Multimedia Application (PMA) has been 
developed by using the principles in Persuasive Multimedia 
Content. In the Planned Effects (increase motivation), the 
motivation is called intrinsic motivation and it is based on the 
satisfactions of behaving “for its sake." This intrinsic 
motivation depends on what is known as internal environment 
in PRIME Theory [11]. 
 
V. 
LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY 
There are more principles related to Persuasive Technology 
and multimedia learning principles than can be dealt with in 
this study in order to maximize the full potential of Persuasive 
Technology.  However, due to the limitations of the 
timeframe, only one principle from Persuasive Technology 
(cause-and-effect), two from multimedia learning principles 
(Multimedia and Redundancy) and three domains of PRIME 
theory (Plans, Evaluations and Motives) are used in this study.  
Finally, due to these limitations, this study could only focus 
on the proof of the persuasive multimedia model with the 
factors that foster intrinsic motivation based on three elements 
in PRIME Theory on the selected participants in the school’s 
multimedia lab. 
 
VI. 
METHODOLOGY 
The main purpose of this study is to design and develop a 
persuasive multimedia application based on Persuasive 
Technology principles and Multimedia Learning Principles in 
order to increase teenagers’ motivation in terms of smoking 
prevention and cessation in such a way as to enable them to 
quit smoking. The study also suggests an appropriate way to 
evaluate its effectiveness. 
A. Method and design 
 
     It is suggested that the study employed a 2 x 2 quasi-
experimental design in which two groups of participants will 
be tested twice using pre-test and post-test experiments with 
regard to a particular exposure to different modes of treatment 
as indicated by the following Table 1:

D. Data Analysis and Results 
 
The purposes of the analysis are to measure the 
effectiveness of Persuasive Multimedia Application on the 
teenager’s motivation towards smoking prevention and 
cessation, before and after the treatment. The scope for the 
analysis is based on the research hypotheses stated earlier in 
this study. 
 
 
VII. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
A. Combined effect of intervention and effects on modes of 
presentation 
 
There is no significant difference between two multimedia 
principles on persuasive design principle (cause-and-effect) in 
two Persuasive Multimedia Applications in terms of 
increasing teenage motivation with regard to smoking 
prevention and cessation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Generally there was no significant effect of courseware on 
smoking status for both modes at F=1.108, p = 0.513 from the 
ANCOVA result after controlling for the effect of smoking 
status prior to the intervention. Hence H2 is rejected. 
In terms of two different modes, group B in the 
redundancy mode showed a significant effect of courseware 
on smoking status at F=49.132, p = 0.004 from the ANOVA 
result.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS 
This study adapted PRIME Theory by West [9], in order to 
simulate the three different domains under PRIME Theory in 
terms of smoking prevention and cessation. With the increase 
in the three preliminary domains of motivation, there will an 
increase in one’s motivation level which will promote 
smoking prevention and cessation. 
Two types of Persuasive Multimedia Application (PMA) 
were developed as an intervention strategy to promote the 
three domains of motivation under PRIME Theory. The 
Persuasive Multimedia Application is developed based on

Redundancy) as a design strategy. The effectiveness of the 
Persuasive Multimedia Application (PMA) is tested using 
PRIME questionnaires developed by West [10]. 
A. Combined effect of intervention and effects according to 
modes of presentation 
 
The overall analysis with regard to the second hypothesis 
also shows that, in general, there is no significant effect of 
courseware on smoking status for both modes at F=1.108, p = 
0.513 from the ANCOVA result after controlling for the effect 
of smoking status prior to the intervention. 
However, group B in the redundancy mode shows a 
significant effect in terms of courseware on smoking status at 
F=49.132, p = 0.004 from the ANOVA result, compared to 
group A in the Multimedia mode, where the result is F=0.526, 
p = 0.828. These results suggest that the redundancy mode 
related to group B had a more positive result in increasing 
teenage motivation with regard to smoking prevention and 
cessation, based on prior smoking status, compared to the 
multimedia mode.  
Hence, despite the results of the overall analysis, the 
findings with regard to group B confirmed and were parallel 
with those of Toh, Waddah and Wan Ahmad Jaafar [11], 
where there are positive effects of redundancy principle on 
learning. One possible explanation is that the narration used in 
the redundancy mode in this study might have reduced the 
split-attention effect and learners’ cognitive load, which then 
promoted their motivation. 
B. PMA supports PRIME Theory 
 
The overall results show that there is no significant effect 
of Persuasive Multimedia Application on three different 
domains of PRIME Theory in increasing teenage motivation 
towards smoking prevention and cessation at F = 1.868, p = 
0.252 from the ANCOVA result in general. Specifically, 
however, there is a significant difference in terms of one 
domain (Evaluations) at F = 2.054, p = 0.038. 
This finding supports the PRIME Theory that the internal 
environment and the stimulation of the human motivational 
system depend on the external environment. In this study, 
Persuasive Multimedia Application (PMA) acts as the external 
environment or stimuli to stimulate them. The results show 
that one domain of the human motivational system - the 
Evaluations domain - shows a significant difference after the 
treatment. This result is vital in strengthening teenage 
motivation towards smoking prevention and cessation. As 
West [10] stated, human motives in doing something 
(including smoking) depend on their beliefs or what he 
referred to as ‘Evaluations’ in PRIME Theory. 
As the Evaluations domain is one part of the human 
motivational system, the results of the analysis with regard to 
the evaluations domain shows the effects of an interactive 
programme (Persuasive Multimedia Application) which in 
general is similar to the work of Fogg [3] in which an 
interactive programme can help someone to quit smoking 
when the urge (motivation) is strong. 
The results of the analysis with regard to the evaluations 
domain also proved the belief of Parkinson et al. [8] that anti-
smoking media may be an important means of targeting 
beliefs about smoking among youth. “Beliefs” is the same as 
the Evaluations domain in PRIME Theory. Therefore, findings 
with regard to this domain are vital for future research. 
 
IX. 
IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY 
The results of this study have confirmed that Persuasive 
Multimedia Application developed by using the principle of 
cause-and-effect as a persuasive design principle has 
stimulated human motivational system at macro level through 
stimulation.  
On the other hand, the Redundancy principle as a 
multimedia learning principle, has shown the significant 
impact of stimulating the Evaluations domain in PRIME 
theory in terms of the human motivational system at micro-
level.  
Hence, in order to ensure that persuasive messages are 
successfully delivered through a multimedia application in 
terms of stimulating the human motivational domains, and 
thus strengthening human motivation levels in terms of the 
targeted behaviour, the following design guidelines may be 
considered: 
 
 
Persuasive Multimedia Application may be used as a 
medium for stimulating and strengthening human 
motivation, where the focus is on the cause-and-effect 
principle as the main learning strategy. 
 
The redundancy principle should be the main design 
strategy 
in 
delivering 
the 
persuasive 
message, 
especially when teenagers are the target group. 
 
Based on the above design guidelines, a few suggestions 
have been made for future research. 
 
X. 
SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH 
Due to the study limitations, some areas were not covered in 
this study. The following are the areas that need further 
research based on the findings and the literature on which this 
study was based: 
 
 
A combination of persuasive principles with an 
integrative theory (CMOB: The Behaviour System and 
PRIME Theory of motivation) to provide a systematic 
basis 
for 
designing 
a 
Persuasive 
Multimedia 
Application 
and 
developing 
behaviour 
change 
techniques in order to elevate and strengthen the 
individual’s motivation which will lead to smoking 
cessation. 
 
 
A combination of other persuasive principles in 
designing and developing a Persuasive Multimedia 
Application to maximize teenage learning.

The effects of Persuasive Multimedia Application in 
elevating and strengthening the five domains of human 
motivational system according to PRIME Theory by

Findings, discussions, implication and suggestion for future 
research have led to the following conclusion. 
 
 
XI. 
CONCLUSION 
Smoking has been identified as one of the major problems 
in Malaysia. The literature review has revealed that motivation 
is closely connected with persuasion. Therefore, this research 
has added a new insight in terms of motivation with regard to 
the field of Persuasive Technology.  
Persuasive Technology has been used in many fields of 
study including education and health, where one of the 
ultimate aims is to change people’s attitudes or behaviour. 
Researchers have applied and tested different models and 
principles of design and used a variety of approaches in their 
studies, with various purposes and target audiences. Most of 
their attempts have produced significant results. 
The Persuasive Multimedia Application (PMA) used in this 
study were designed and developed by integrating Persuasive 
Technology and PRIME Theory, as these are firmly believed 
to be able to elevate and strengthen teenagers’ motivation with 
regard to smoking prevention and cessation. 
Stimulating and strengthening human motivation levels is a 
fundamental and also a vital step in terms of the ultimate goal 
which is to change people’s attitudes or behaviour. In this 
case, we are interested in smoking cessation. This Persuasive 
Multimedia Application thus is a preliminary intervention 
aimed at stimulating and strengthening motivation in terms of 
smoking cessation.  
West [10] stated that recovery occurs when an individual is 
no longer experiences powerful motivations to engage in an 
addictive activity to an extent that is harmful. Therefore, 
developing an intervention with regard to reducing an 
individual’s powerful motivation towards smoking is 
fundamental. This can be done by stimulating and 
strengthening the human motivational system. 
Based on the findings from the study, specifically both 
Persuasive Multimedia Application (PMA) that uses the 
cause-and-effect 
Principle 
derived 
from 
Persuasive 
Technology [3] as a learning strategy are confirmed as having 
a significant impact on smoking status treatment.  
The findings also confirm that a PMA that uses the 
Redundancy Principle from Cognitive Theory of Multimedia 
Learning [7] as a design strategy, will have a significant 
impact on the Evaluations domain. Therefore, a PMA that uses 
the Redundancy Principle is proven to be an effective tool in 
elevating and strengthening teenagers’ motivation towards 
smoking prevention and cessation among the two multimedia 
principles. It is also a proof that Persuasive Technology may 
provide the right kind of encouragement to help a person quit 
smoking [3].
