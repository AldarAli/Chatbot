Abstract—At its core, resilience refers to the ability to resist 
and/or respond to a shock (internal or external stressor, 
disruption, disturbance, or challenge), and recover from the 
event once it has occurred. Organizations are complex adaptive 
systems whose capacity for resilience is embedded in a set of 
individual-level Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Other 
attributes (KSAOs), as well as a blend of organizational system-
level cognitive, behavioral, and contextual capabilities. This 
paper applies complex systems theory and a Human Systems 
Integration (HSI) perspective to present a conceptual approach 
and computational model called simpathē (an acronym for 
Systems Integration of Manpower, Personnel, and Training for 
HSI Evaluations). The simpathē model aims to help assess 
organizational workforce resilience in two ways: first, it 
facilitates 
planning 
and 
preparations 
to 
help 
build 
organizational capacity to resist undesirable effects from system 
shocks; second, it enables rapid workforce trade-space 
evaluations to aid in developing situation-specific responses 
(and ultimately, transformative activities) that capitalize on 
disruptive events. This paper illustrates the simpathē model with 
a use case example that characterizes organizational workforce 
resilience in the face of a major technological perturbation 
within the system—namely, the large-scale (organization-wide) 
conversion to operating and maintaining a collection of new 
communication technologies.

 INTRODUCTION 
The nature of change and uncertainty in the environment 
surrounding businesses associated with health, defense, crisis 
management and emergency services constantly challenges 
the resilience of organizations in these industries. Rapidly 
changing technology, intense competition, the stress of 
constantly having to do more with less, not to mention the 
need to be prepared for and respond to natural disasters, 
pandemic diseases, terrorist attacks or other man-made 
calamities, economic recessions, safety/security threats, 
equipment failures and general human errors are just some 
examples of how many different types of shocks can 
undermine the stability and security of an organizational 
system [1]. An organization’s workforce—i.e., the resource 
pool of individuals engaged in or available for work—
comprises a major nexus of resilience potential for 
organizations. Having appropriate numbers of people who 
possess the appropriate knowledge, skills, and attitudes to 
operate efficiently and effectively is critical to an 
organization’s capacity to adapt to constant change, respond 
rapidly and adequately to organizational shocks, and thrive in 
dynamic and sometimes turbulent environments. 
This paper leverages theories and concepts from 
industrial/organizational psychology, ecology, industrial 
systems engineering, operations research and management, 
complexity science, and Human Systems Integration (HSI). It 
then combines them with resilience research to develop a 
method for characterizing organizational workforce resilience 
as a function of interdependencies between manpower (the 
number of people available for work), personnel (the aptitudes 
of the people who work), and the training needed to prepare 
those people to perform the work. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents background and related research that briefly reviews 
the foundational theory, principles, and concepts employed in 
this research effort. Section III describes the technical 
methods 
for 
characterizing 
organizational 
workforce 
resilience, while Section IV introduces simpathē, a 
computational model that implements those methods. Section 
V closes with a use case example to demonstrate how 
simpathē can provide insights and solutions to organizational 
decision makers for both planning/preparation (i.e., static 
resilience) and for response/recovery (dynamic resilience). 
II. 
BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
Recent years have seen a surge in resilience related 
research [2]. A considerable amount of this prior work is 
grounded in the context of disasters and other traumatic events 
[3]. Furthermore, much of the work is primarily concerned 
with understanding resilience from the perspective of either 
individuals or communities [4], with much less emphasis on 
understanding or characterizing resilience for sociotechnical 
systems at the organizational level.  
The research effort described in this paper is distinct from 
the (albeit useful and informative) prior literature in both 
respects. First, the current work addresses the issue of 
resilience at a system-level in a unique way (exploring static 
and dynamic resilience associated with an organizational 
workforce system). Second, the focus is on a more general and 
54

pervasive type of organizational system shock (i.e., 
technological disruptions affecting an industry or business).  
Such distinctions necessitate a brief review of exactly 
what the term organizational workforce resilience means in 
the this context, as well as what it means to refer to 
organizations as complex adaptive systems when referencing 
the specific domains of manpower, personnel, and training 
from the systems engineering sub-discipline known as Human 
Systems Integration.  
A. What is Resilience? 
The term resilience lends itself to interpretations that have 
relevance to a variety of research interests ranging from 
physical science disciplines like metallurgy and materials 
science, to natural science disciplines like ecology (where 
Holling’s seminal 1973 publication linked the concept with an 
ecosystem’s ability to absorb change and still persist [5]) to 
social sciences like individual and organizational psychology, 
and applied sciences like safety engineering [1]. Tracking the 
evolution of the definition of resilience through the years and 
across the disciplines gives an idea of the broad impact the 
concept has had to science in general, and helps shape the 
understanding of its use in this paper, which pairs it with 
organizational workforce systems. 
Shortly following Holling’s initial contribution to the field  
[5], the ecological literature began to reference two types of 
resilience: first, “ecological resilience” is consistent with 
Holling’s original definition (the ability to absorb change and 
still persist after a shock); second, “engineering resilience” 
deals with the dual processes associated with a) building up 
resistance capacity to potential disruptions a priori, and b) 
enhancing the speed of returning to the pre-existing 
equilibrium [2][6][7]. As one might infer from the title of this 
paper, these concepts are important to the current effort. 
For at least the past few decades, the economics literature 
has provided significant social science research contributions 
to the concept of resilience. In particular, Rose offers useful 
research from the perspective of economic resilience to 
natural and man-made disasters (c.f., [8][9]). Rose uses the 
term “static resilience”, which refines the concept of 
resistance in engineering resilience to incorporate specific 
consideration for proactively developing the ability for 
maintaining core functions and performing essential tasks 
when shocked. Rose also introduced “dynamic resilience” to 
refer to the speed at which a system returns or bounces-back 
to a pre-shock state. Regional studies literature on resilience 
further cultivated the concept by calling attention to an 
important aspect of dynamic resilience: it is “an adaptive 
notion […] characterized by complex non-linear dynamics 
and an adaptive capacity that enables [systems] to rearrange 
their internal structure spontaneously” [10].  
Progressing to the field of operations research and 
management, the concept of organizational resilience is 
instantiated as the capacity for an organization to resist shocks 
(by avoiding organizational breakdowns and failures) and 
return to a normal state—which may be the original state or 
some other new desired state [11][12]. Sheffi and Rice further 
emphasize that a resilient organization should incorporate a 
strategic initiative to build resilience by (preemptively, 
continuously) monitoring the organizational state, being 
sensitive to operations and having well-developed situation 
awareness, maintaining flexibility to create or reduce 
redundancy when and where needed [12]. Teixeira and 
Werther similarly advocate for organizations to be 
anticipatory responders—to anticipate potential challenges 
and disturbances and to adaptively adjust prior to a disruption 
[13]. Consistent with prior research [2], this paper synthesizes 
the above literature into a characterization of organizational 
resilience that embraces: 
a) the concept of engineering resilience [6][7], with both 
static and dynamic resilience [8][9], 
b) the perspective that organizations comprise complex 
adaptive systems and processes [10],  
c) the notion that a system may “recover” by returning 
to its original state or to a new desired state [11][12],  
d) resilience as a strategic initiative to be proactively 
evaluate organizational decisions [12], and  
e) resilient organizations as anticipatory responders such 
that adaptation to a new desired state may occur ahead 
of a disruptive event [13]. 
With these tenants of organizational resilience in mind, 
organizational workforce resilience further focuses and 
scopes the current effort to considerations associated with the 
organization’s human capital resources—i.e., the resilience 
embodied in the organization’s staffing, tasking, and training 
of individuals responsible for the work associated with 
maintaining core functions and performing essential tasks 
within the organization. The concept of organizational 
(workforce) resilience is quite different from notions of 
individual resilience pervasive in psychology literature. 
Research in that domain is typically oriented around personal 
characteristics that serve as protective factors and/or promote 
a person’s capacity to survive, bounce-back, and thrive when 
faced with adversity and crisis. Examples of factors discussed 
in psychology research include those related to self-esteem, 
self-confidence, self-efficacy, loci of control, adaptive coping 
and 
problem-solving 
strategies, 
flexibility 
and 
resourcefulness, personality (including the Big 5 and other 
ego-resiliency traits), emotional intelligence (including self-
awareness and assessment), health, and social relationships 
(see [14]–[18]). A common misconception of organizational 
resilience is to perceive it as a sum total of individual 
capacities to be resilient [19]. However, organizations are 
complex sociotechnical systems that change and evolve not 
just based on individual orientations and actions but more so 
through the interactions that individuals have with each other 
and from interdependencies among the sub-systems and 
processes in the organization [20]. 
Whereas individual resilience is too narrow for the 
purposes of the current effort, the notion of community 
resilience is slightly too broad. Research in community 
resilience typically attends to the connections between 
neighborhoods and community-level organizations, and 
between a variety of local and non-governmental groups 
whose professions necessarily focuses on building and 
protecting places (e.g., engineers, urban planners, architects), 
as well as those focused on growing and maintaining healthy 
people (e.g., health care and public health professionals,

emergency responders, social service providers, faith-based 
specialists, educators, law enforcement, etc.) [4][21]–[23].  
A. What is the Complex Adaptive Systems Perspective? 
The current paper provides a useful link between 
considering the resilience of individuals and the resilience of 
an entire community. This link is accomplished by taking an 
explicit complex adaptive systems perspective grounded in 
specific technical methods from systems engineering and HSI.  
Edson [24] offers a helpfully concise formal definition of 
complex adaptive systems, with short descriptions of the 
important characteristics that make the perspective so well-
suited for applications in organizational resilience research: 
Complex adaptive systems are diverse, interconnected 
systems that exhibit self-organization (purposeful internal 
evolution), hierarchy (certainty created through structures 
that bring order and meaning), emergence (a coherent and 
integrated dynamic of innovation), and learning (planned 
application of experience to future events) based on 
environmental feedback in response to uncertainty (p. 499). 
Thus, a complex system is composed of a large number of 
comparatively simpler parts interacting with each other so that 
the emergent behavior of the whole is intrinsically difficult to 
predict based only on the behavior of any single part [25][26]. 
This is due to the nonlinear interactions, dependencies, and 
relationships among the parts, as well as between parts and the 
system’s environment. Many complex systems are also 
adaptive, meaning they “respond to their environment and 
alter their behavior in such a way that they can maintain or 
improve their function, or so they can ‘survive’ (that is, 
continue to persist as organized systems)” [25].  
The complex adaptive system perspective is a useful 
framework for conceptualizing organizational resilience 
because it captures the tenant of adaptability, as well as the 
nonlinear relationships between aspects of human capital 
within the workforce (the number and type of people, their 
aptitudes, their training), the work environment (workweek 
demands in terms of the dynamics of situationally dependent 
tasks required, resource availability, time apportioned), and so 
on [10][23][27]. The emergent nature of this perspective is in 
contrast to reductionist approaches, which attempt to 
understand the system as a whole by study individual pieces 
in isolation; again, the systems perspective emphasizes that 
the whole is not equal to the simple sum of its parts. 
B. What is Human Systems Integration (HSI)? 
The International Council on Systems Engineering 
(INCOSE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers Computer Society (IEEE-CS), and the Systems 
Engineering Research Center (SERC) jointly define Human 
Systems Integration as an interdisciplinary technical and 
management process for integrating human considerations 
with and across all system elements [28]. HSI incorporates the 
following domains as integration considerations: manpower, 
personnel, training, human factors engineering, occupational 
health, safety, habitability, and human survivability. Of these 
domains, the current effort of engineering organizational 
workforce resilience is principally concerned with the trade-
offs related to manpower, personnel, and training. Manpower 
refers to the number and type of people who operate, maintain, 
support, and provide training for systems [29]. Personnel 
refers to the human aptitudes (such as knowledge, skills, 
abilities, attitudes) and experiences required to perform the 
jobs of operators, maintainers, and support staff  [29]. 
Training prepares people to perform the tasks necessary to 
accomplish organizational goals and objectives [29]. 
III. 
CHARACTERIZING WORKFORCE RESILIENCE WITH 
THE SIMPATHĒ MODEL 
Workforce resilience is an organization’s ability to 
respond and adapt rapidly to threats posed to its workforce. 
Organizations that can build resiliency into their human 
capital are more likely to protect their most valuable resources 
and maintain continuous operations in the event of a crisis. In 
general, this paper conceptualizes workforce resilience as a 
function of the interdependencies between manpower, 
personnel, training, and the organizational context in terms of 
core functions and essential tasks. The technical foundation 
for establishing this context is the task analysis. I refer to this 
conceptual approach for evaluating aspects of organizational 
workforce resilience as Systems Integration of Manpower, 
Personnel, and Training for HSI Evaluations, abbreviated as 
simpathē (pronounced “sympathy”). 
A. Task Analysis 
In HSI (from the human factors engineering domain), a 
task analysis involves the study of how a system goal or 
objective is accomplished. Task analysis includes a detailed 
decomposition and description of both manual and mental 
activities, timing/durations, frequency of occurrence, task 
divisions of labor and allocation (to some combination of one 
or more humans and/or technology), potential errors, 
information requirements (both inputs and outputs), requisite 
aptitudes for task performance, performance criteria, 
environmental conditions, and other factors involved in or 
required for one or more people to perform a given task (see 
[30] for a more complete list of task analysis elements used 
for various applications). The term task is often used 
interchangeably with activity or process. 
The method presented in this paper relies on a minimum 
of three specific task analysis elements: hierarchical task list 
with descriptions, task timing (duration), and task frequency. 
1) Task List and Descriptions. System functions (goals, 
objectives) serve as an initial hierarchical framework for 
further decomposition of goal-directed, step-by-step list of all 
essential tasks and activities needed to ensure the 
organization’s core functions can be maintained. Ensure that 
all collateral duties (especially those particularly relevant for 
disruptive situations) be incorporated to the extent practical. 
2) Timing. For each essential task activity, the task timing 
(durations) are needed in order to determine the labor 
requirements for ensuring core functions and essential tasks 
are maintained during organizational shocks. In the absence 
of direct observation, task times can be analytically derived 
using empirically-established human performance equations 
associated with human perceptual process, information and 
56

decision processing, and human body movements. For 
example, the Hick-Hyman empirical equation depicts motor 
reaction time (RT) in response to perceiving/processing 
information and making decisions as a logarithmic function of 
the number of alternative stimuli and responses. Fitts’ Law is 
an empirical equation for movement time (MT), which 
describes the logarithmic relationships of distance traveled 
and required precision with the time to complete discrete 
movement. When combined, the equations above allow 
analysts to derive total task times (TT), which account for 
perceptual delays, decision delays, and movement durations: 
 
 TT = 𝑎 + [ 𝑏 ∗ log2(𝑁)] + 𝑘 + [ 𝑐 ∗ log2(
2𝐷
𝑊) ]          (1) 
 
Where: a and b are empirically derived constants to 
account for perceptual and decision processing; N is the 
number of choices or attention items; k and c are empirically 
derived constants to account for times difference of specific 
body part movement (finger, wrist, arm, foot, etc.); D is 
distance of movement; W is width of target.  
Another analytical method used in industrial and 
production engineering are Predetermined Motion Time 
Systems (PMTSs), also referred to as Predetermined Time 
Standards or Predetermined Time Systems (PTS). Methods-
Time Measurement (MTM) is one such system useful for 
quantifying the amount of time required to perform specific 
tasks under defined conditions. 
Because of the complex adaptive nature of organizational 
systems, it is often useful to understand the range and 
distribution of times associated with tasks. The Program 
Evaluation 
and 
Review 
Technique 
(PERT) 
[31] 
accommodates uncertainty by incorporating timing appraisals 
based on three point estimates: optimistic time: the minimum 
possible time required to accomplish an activity assuming 
everything proceeds better than is normally expected or that 
the task is performed by a highly proficient expert; pessimistic 
time: the maximum possible time required to accomplish an 
activity, assuming things go awry (excluding major 
catastrophes) or that the task is performed by an non-
proficient novice; and the most likely time: the best estimate 
of the time required to accomplish an activity, assuming 
everything proceeds as normal or that the task is performed by 
a typical competent worker. The PERT distribution assigns 
very small probability to extreme values, and so the Modified 
PERT distribution introduces a fourth parameter, lambda (γ), 
that controls the weight of the most likely value in the 
determination of the mean and helps provide control on how 
much probability is assigned to tail values of the distribution: 
 
                                𝜇𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘 = 
𝑎+ 𝛾𝑏+𝑐
𝛾+2                                     (2) 
 
Where: a is the minimum (most optimistic) time; b is the 
most likely time, c is the maximum (most pessimistic) time; γ 
is the distribution control parameter that becomes useful when 
(b – a) and (c – b) are very different magnitudes [32].  
3) Frequency. In the absence of empirical data, task 
frequencies can be estimated or rated. For example, Subject 
Matter 
Experts 
(SMEs) 
reposnible 
for 
performing 
maintenance on the communications equipment for an 
organization might provide frequency ratings to estimate how 
often they typically perform certain maintenance tasks on a 
single piece of equipment. Ratings may be numerical anchors 
that represent the levels of granularity appropriate for the 
analysis, for example:  
1 = the task is performed at least annually, but typically 
not more than twice per year. 
2 = the task is performed at least semi-annually, but 
typically not more than monthly. 
3 = the task is performed at least monthly, but typically not 
more than twice per week. 
4 = the task is performed at least twice per week, but 
typically not more than twice per day. 
5 = the task is performed at least twice per day, but 
typically not more than twice per hour. 
6 = the task is performed at least twice per hour, but 
typically not more than once per minute. 
B. Manpower Calculations 
Using the data from the task analysis (task list, timing, 
frequency) in conjunction with information regarding 
numbers of systems and anticipated work-week labor, we can 
derive required full-time equivalents (FTEs) needed to 
maintain an organizations core functionality and essential 
tasks. 
1) Equivalent Man-Week. The EMW equation combines 
the frequency ratings with the modified PERT times to obtain 
the estimated weekly labor associated with a particular task. 
For example, the equivalent weekly proportion for any task 
with a frequency rating of 1 (task is performed at least 
annually, but typically not more than twice per year) ranges 
between 1/52 = 0.01923 and 2/52 = 0.03846, because the 
frequency is bound between 1 and 2 times per 52 weeks. Thus, 
the EMW labor requirement for a task that takes 90 minutes, 
but only gets performed once or at most twice in a year is 
between 1.7307 minutes and 3.4614 minutes. 
 
                  𝐸𝑀𝑊𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘 = 𝜇𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘 ∗ 𝑒𝑞𝑝𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘                       (3) 
 
Where: µtask is the task-specific point estimate obtained 
from the modified PERT equation; eqptask is the task frequency 
expressed as an equivalent weekly proportion.  
2) Full-Time Equivalent. The FTE is obtained by the 
summing the EMW times for all tasks, and then dividing by 
prescriptive workweek labor (e.g., a 5 day workweek of 8 
hours per day is 40 hours, or 2400 minutes). For large, longer-
term 
rebuilding 
efforts, 
individuals 
cannot 
sustain 
overload/overtime schedules. FTE should therefore be scaled 
with “maximum workload buffers” to account for any 
proportion of time reserved by a utilization threshold. Typical 
guidance from the field of Human Factors Engineering [33] 
57

is to limit human utilization workloads to 75%, which 
improves organizational workforce (static) resilience. 
 
                        𝐹𝑇𝐸 = 
∑ 𝐸𝑀𝑊𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘
𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 ∗ 0.75                        (4) 
C. Personnel 
For each of the core functions and essential tasks, a list of 
requisite KSAOs can be identified. Often, these KSAOs will 
be bundled together into specific job-roles. The degree to 
which the duties associated with specific job-roles occupy a 
person’s time interacts with the manpower FTE estimates 
such that the FTE associated with a particular job-role can be 
formalized as:  
 
               𝐹𝑇𝐸𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑒 = 
∑ 𝐸𝑀𝑊𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘∗𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑒
𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘
∗ 0.75                     (5) 
 
Additionally, a job-task analysis looks at the fit between 
the requisite KSAOs needed to accomplish the core functions 
and essential tasks for an organization versus the KSAOs of 
the people engaged in or available to perform those tasks. A 
KSAO mismatch (or “personnel gap”) occurs when a task or 
some set of tasks require specific knowledge, skills, abilities, 
or other aptitudes that are not possessed by individuals 
working in the organization. 
 
                         Δ𝐾𝑆𝐴𝑂 = 𝐾𝑆𝐴𝑂𝑟 − 𝐾𝑆𝐴𝑂𝑝                      (6) 
 
Where: KSAOr represents the set of requisite knowledge, 
skills, abilities, or other aptitudes and KSAOp represents the 
set possessed by individuals in the organization’s workforce. 
When ΔKSAO > 0 exists, organizations have a personnel gap. 
When ΔKSAO < 0 exists, organizations have overqualified 
personnel, which may lead to labor cost inefficiencies or 
retention issues. Furthermore, when the manpower and 
personnel domains interact such that there is a discrepancy 
between the number of role-specific FTEs required to perform 
all core functions and essential tasks and the number on hand, 
then the organization becomes less resilient due to either 
inefficiency (if over-staffed with too many role-specific 
FTEs) or inability to maintain organizational core functions 
(if under-staffed with not enough role-specific FTEs). 
D. Training 
In the ever changing environment of industry and 
business, an organization’s human capital (employee KSAOs) 
must be constantly updated to keep pace with change. This is 
especially the case for the type of emblematic shocks 
organizations frequently encounter (i.e., responding to rapid 
changes in technology and marketplace shifts). Oftentimes, 
such organizational system shocks will necessitate either a) an 
entirely new set of core functions for the organization, or b) 
new essential tasks to maintain the same core functions, and 
potentially also c) rendering previous functions and/or tasks 
obsolete, or d) other adjustments and modifications that affect 
task timing/duration, frequency, or requisite KSAOs.  
In complex adaptive systems like organizations, the 
training domain interacts (and is interdependent) with the 
manpower and personnel domains. Organizations can be 
anticipatory responders by identifying training gaps ahead of 
the crisis of workforce shortages or obsolescence. 
IV. 
SIMPATHE: COMPUTATIONAL MODEL 
The methods and techniques described in Section III for 
simpathē represent the conceptual approach for evaluating the 
interdependencies between manpower, personnel, training, 
and organizational context in a systematic and integrated way. 
A computational model that implements these methods and 
techniques is also useful to aid in more rapid exploration of 
the trade-space associated with such (nonlinear, complex) 
interdependencies. The simpathē computational model is 
available as either a standalone computer program (a script 
written in the Python programming language), or as an 
interactive browser-based Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab 
application. All implementations allow for programmatic 
access to the models and techniques, but the Jupyter 
implementations have additional (non-programmatic) user 
interface elements that add web forms and control widgets to 
aid with data importing, exploration, and visualization. For 
example, analysts can use the browser-based JupyterLab 
application to select an existing task analysis data file, run the 
program, and view tabular and graphical summaries for 
manpower requirements associated with all functions and 
tasks designated in the task analysis. Optional sub-groupings 
are enabled as well: manpower requirements by personnel, if 
roles are designated within the task analysis, by hierarchical 
function or functional area, or by other desired groupings (for 
example, see the use case example described in the next 
section). If data is available regarding the organizational 
system’s existing workforce structure, simpathē will also 
assess any potential manpower (and optionally personnel) 
mismatches between the human capital resources required 
according to the task analysis versus what is available in the 
extant workforce, and likewise presents summaries in 
interactive tables and graphical formats. 
V. 
USE CASE EXAMPLE: TECHNOLOGICAL DISTRUPTION 
The United States military is a national defense oriented 
organization that precisely meets the criteria of being a 
complex adaptive system, and decision makers regularly 
apply resilience-thinking to their organizational decision 
processes. This organization uses an assortment of specialized 
communications equipment for a large variety of situations. 
The organization not only operates these specialized 
communication devices, they must also conduct much of the 
maintenance for them. As one might imagine, the technology 
associated with range of these types of devices is widely 
varied, and is constantly evolving. Such technological 
innovations, advances, upgrades, or replacements are the 
source of disruptions for the organization’s MPT situation. In 
an effort to mitigate the negative impacts on manpower, 
personnel, and training (MPT) for technological disruptions, 
the organization used simpathē to assess MPT risks and 
potential courses of (COAs). First, simpathē helped 
summarize the FTE requirements for all functions and tasks 
associated with the maintenance journeymen, supervisors, and 
support technician roles for designated levels of maintenance 
(organization-level versus depot level) for one or more

selected types of communications equipment (e.g., radio types 
X, Y, and Z out of a set of 17 types of hand-held, vehicle 
mounted, or backpack carried communication devices). These 
FTE requirements were then compared to the extant MPT 
situation for over 1,000 different maintenance units within the 
larger organization such that current over- and under-staffing 
situations were identified. A range of possible technological 
changes that affected the maintenance functions and tasks 
were next assessed for their impact on the number and types 
of maintainers, their aptitudes, and their training. For example, 
some 
innovations 
made KSAOs 
related 
to analog 
communications less applicable, stressing aptitudes related to 
digital, satellite, and wired/wireless networking KSAOs.
