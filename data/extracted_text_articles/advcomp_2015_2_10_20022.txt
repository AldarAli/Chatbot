Abstract—Data mining (DM) approaches such as clustering
and classification are employed in this paper to identify and
classify the patent quality. We develop an effective and
automatic patent quality classification system. First, the Self-
organizing map (SOM) is used to cluster patents automatically
into different quality groups with patent quality indicators
instead of via expert identification. Then, the Kernel principal
component analysis (kernel-PCA) is used to extract key
indicator to improve classification performance. Finally, the
Support vector machine (SVM) is used to build the quality
classification model. The proposed classification model is
applied to classify patent quality automatically in solar
industries. Experimental results show that our proposed
approach KPCA-SVM can improve the performance of the
patent
quality
classification
when
compared
with
the
traditional
method.
Another
advantage
is
that
the
computational time is largely reduced.

INTRODUCTION
An important issue of patent analysis is patent quality.
The high quality patent information can ensure success for
business decision-making process or product development
[1-2]. This study reviewed the patent analysis approaches
that can understand patent status like patent quality, novelty,
litigation, trends and so on [3]. In addition, traditional patent
analysis requires spending much time, cost and manpower.
Therefore, the potential for high quality patent determining
approach need to shorten the time for business or production.
Recently, the self-organizing map (SOM) is used to analysis
patent for patent trend [4] and regional innovation systems
[5]. It can analyse patent current situation and trend, but it
doesn’t provide a solution for determine future patent
quality. The future patent recognition is a key research for
present time because patent impact on the industry. The
future patent recognition is a key research for the time
because patent impact on the industry need to response
quickly.
Therefore,
support
vector
machine
(SVM)
forecasting model can solve patent classification problem for
predict future unknown patent classification such as quality
[6]. In this study, we propose a KPCA-SVM patent quality
classification system that combines three data mining (DM)
methods such as SOM, Kernel-PCA and SVM. The SOM is
used to cluster patents into several groups for qualities
according to their data characteristics. Then, the quality
indictor can compute the quality levels for delimit patents
quality on each groups. The kernel principle components
analysis (kernel-PCA) is based on principle components
analysis and used to transform patent data into new features
set by nonlinear kernel mapping. SVM is used to build
classification
model
for
patent
quality
problem.
This
methodology helps experts rank and set values on patent
quality in solar industry. Therefore, a trained model can
evaluate unknown patents’ quality, better enable engineers
and product designers forecast patent potential for product
development.

LITERATURE REVIEWS
A.
Patnet Analysis
There are various tools utilized by organizations for
analyzing patents. These tools are capable of performing
wide range of tasks, such as forecasting future technological
trends, detecting patent infringement and determining patent
quality and so on [3]. Moreover, patent analysis tools can
free patent experts from the laborious tasks of analyzing the
patent documents manually and determining the quality of
patents. The tools assist organizations in making decisions of
whether or not to invest in manufacturing of the new
products by analyzing the quality of the filed patents [2]. The
eventually may result in imprecise recommendation of
patents. However, the larger data and indicators for patent
quality forecasting are needed.
B.
Patnet Quality Indicator
The primary patent quality indicators are related to
investment, maintenance, and litigation, which form a basis
for assessing patent quality, when the evaluation focuses on
the potential patents for business. One kind of indicator of
patent quality is legal status (LS) that it can show which
technologies are hot and which are not for business
intelligence. The legal status and search tools on the internet
are very sensitive that emphasis given to the issues related to
the date of availability to the public of an Internet disclosure,
its conformance and its possibly non-prejudicial nature [7].
The legal status change that suggestions on how these
changes may be tracked are provided, specifically resolution

is also complicated by the “first to invent” concept in US
patent law [8].
C.
Self-Organizing Maps
The SOM is a two-layer neural network that maps
multidimensional data on to a two dimensional topological
grid. The data are group according to similarities and
patterns found in the data set, using some form of distance
measure which use the Euclidean distance. The results are
displayed as nodes on the map, which can be divided into
different clusters based upon the distances between the
clusters. Since the SOM is unsupervised, no target outcomes
are provided, and the SOM is allowed to freely organize
itself, so the SOM is an ideal tool for exploratory data
analysis. The authors [4] used SOM to identify patent trends
that they analyze patent knowledge to identify research
trends. They tested on patents from the United States Patent
and Trademark Office (USPTO) and result both an overview
of the directions of the trends and a drill-down perspective of
current trends. Another algorithm using SOM that is
evolving self-organizing map (ESOM), which features an
evolving network structure and fast on-line learning. Their
result shows that ESOM achieved better or comparable
performance with a much shorter learning process [9].
D.
Kernel Principle Component Analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) is very useful to
extract nonlinear features for many research applications.
The Kernel-PCA is an extension of PCA using the kernel
mapping before the Eigen-problem. Kernel-PCA is as a
nonlinear
alternative
to
classical
PCA
of
combustion
composition space is investigated. PCA is mathematically
defined. The PCA is widely used in many field researches.
The research [1] wants to identify the key impact factors
using PCA and they selected a lot of variables according to
first five components indicate. The Kernel-PCA is used to
critical feature extraction in stock trading model and capture
best performance compared to PCA, ICA and so on [10].
E.
Support Vector Machinie
Support vector machine is a machine learning algorithm
and widely used for classification problems [5]. This method
aims to develop an optimal hyper-plane as a decision
function using the maximum margin hyper-plane between
class vectors on both sides of the hyper-plane. Support vector
machine map input vectors into the high dimensional feature
space via the non-linear mapping. An effective decision
hyper-plane is developed to distinguish the correct training
data. An approach is proposed integrated with a hybrid
genetic-based support vector machine (HGA-SVM) model
for developing a patent classification system [11]. But they
are needed expert’s knowledge to analysis. The authors
claim that they use these models in real-world cases of patent
classification rather than only use for International Patent
Classification (IPC). The study integrated the honey-bee
mating optimization algorithm with SVM (HBMOSVM) for
patent document categorization. In their results show that the
HBMOSVM could result in better patent documentation
accuracy and better F-measure performance as an evaluation
index
than
GASVM
model
in
patents
document
categorization [12].

an
automatic
patent

SVM; the components used are SOM, kernel-PCA and SVM
approaches. Fig. 1 shows that, first, we collect the patent data
related industries from the patent database, use SOM

by our proposed system. Our system is developed as follows:

Patent Quality Analysis and Identification by SOM with
Quality Indicators
The SOM approach is adopted to cluster the patents, to
identify patent quality and to explore hidden patterns among
these patents. According to SOM, these patents will be split
into several groups (clusters) and each cluster includes
number of patents with a similar patent quality. This SOM
analysis process continues until all input vectors are
processed. Convergence criterion utilized here is in terms of
epochs, which defines how many times all input vectors
should be fed to the SOM for analysis. Details of the SOM
algorithm are listed as follows:
•
Step 1: Set-up the parameters in the SOM network.
•
Step 2: Initialize each neuron weight

Step 5: repeat step 3 and 4 until the convergence
criterion is satisfied. Average value for each variable
of each clustered group was calculated after the
patent cases were clustered, and the average value
for each variable of each group would be the basis
when finding the most matching group for the new
case. After the set of patent data has been processed
by SOM, a new case can be categorized into a pre-
defined group.
The patents of each group will compute the quality by
quality indicators such as legal status. The quality levels of
each group are calculated as follows:

The input vector of SVM training employ the new
nonlinear feature space training(trk) by kernel-PCA and the
output vector of quality level is given by SOM with quality
indicators. The trained model of SVM is then used to
evaluate the testing data testing(trk) for patent quality
forecasting. Thus, the proposed model can be applied to
build the patent quality model for evaluating the potential of
patents.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this paper, these patents were divided into seven
groups in order to discriminating quality levels into seven
degrees. The parameters of SOM including epochs and
cluster are set up to 5,000 and 7, respectively. In SVM
model, the kernel is radial basis function (RBF), while the
cost is 256 and gamma is 0.25. The patent data of solar
industry are collected from patent database of Thomson
Innovation which has 60,000 patents in eleven patent offices.
Seven different quality groups are used in SOM and its
quality levels are sorted by legal status of quality indictor.
The Table 1 shows that the highest legal status is in group 7,
the second is in group 6 and the lowest is in group 1. The
legal status on group 7 is 10.120 and the number of patents is
2,235. We observed that the higher of patent quality is, the
less of patent number is. The other way around is for low
patent quality patent.

Fig. 2 shows that the distribution on patent applications
for 11 patent offices. The two larger shares of patents are US
and CN. Their patents exist in different quality levels
because their markets are the most important economic
region attracting many patent applications.

Distribution on patent applications for 11 patent offices
We focus on group 7 since the patent offices of US; CN;
EP; JP and AU include 88% shares as shown in Fig. 3. Other
offices are much less involved in solar industry. In addition,
the patent applies in EP patent offices are high quality which
are in Group 4, 5, 6 and 7. However, the quality levels are
evenly spread in CN patent offices.

The results show the forecasting performance for KPCA-
SVM and decision tree (DT). The optimal parameters were
decided from the training data for kernel-PCA and SVM.
Table 2 shows that our proposed model has best performance
on three measure indicators and they are 99.71% on
accuracy, 99.28% on average precision of all classes, and

CONCLUSIONS
We proposed the KPCA-SVM patent quality system
which combined SOM, kernel-PCA and SVM data mining
approaches in solar industry. The experimental results
showed that the proposed approach has a better performance
when compared with other traditional approaches in terms of
time consuming, cost and manpower. The proposed approach
take a shorten time to determine patent quality and has
99.91% accuracy. In addition, the proposed system performs
even better for a larger patent data and making fast and
accurate recommendations. In the future research work, we
will consider the relationship between patent quality and
patent value creation. Therefore, different patent quality can
be closely related to different patent values via accurate
classification system.
