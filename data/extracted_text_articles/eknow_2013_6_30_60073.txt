Abstract—Cognitive map (CM) has been widely accepted as a 
robust decision support mechanism with which decision 
makers can analyze causal relationships existing among 
relevant variables, and represent tacit knowledge explicitly in a 
form of causal relationships. In literature, there are many 
successful cases with CM. Nevertheless, there is no study that 
clearly investigates the potentials of CM in reducing decision 
maker’s perceived equivocality, and enhancing perceived 
usefulness. To pursue the research  objective like this, we 
organized an experiment in which participants are given two 
types of tasks (analyzable vs less-analyzable) and two types of 
task representation (text-based vs CM-based). Results clearly 
showed that the CM can provide significantly improved 
performance in decision making support.

INTRODUCTION 
Cognitive map (CM) is used to capture perception of 
decision makers (DMs) faced with complex and unstructured 
decision problems. Many relevant literatures showed that 
CM can be used for solving many kinds of decision 
problems [1], [2], [3], [4] most of which belong to 
unstructured decision problems. And also, CM can describe 
and facilitate elaboration of real world for individuals. 
Elaboration is the cognitive process whereby individuals 
consciously or subconsciously establish paths between nodes 
in a semantic network representing newly learned material 
and nodes representing already known material [5.  
This study attempt to verify that CM is an effective 
methodology by conducting an experiment which examines 
that CM is more effective than Text under analyzable tasks 
by comparing CM with Text. And further analyzes the 
difference in problem solving between analyzable tasks and 
less-analyzable tasks within the framework of equivocality 
of information in CM and Text. The focus is that that while 
CM method knowledge is important in solving all such tasks, 
the role of application domain knowledge is contingent upon 
the type of understanding task under investigation. We use 
the theory of cognitive fit to establish theoretical differences 
in the role of application domain knowledge among the 
different types of schema understanding tasks.  
 
II. 
THEORY AND HYPOTHESIS 
A. Semantic Network and Problem Solving 
CM proposes that individuals will be able to better 
understand domain knowledge that complies with its criteria. 
This is supported by two bodies of theories of cognition. 
Firstly, the semantic network theory proposes that CM lead 
analysts to construct efficient mental representations of a 
domain [6]. Semantic network theory states that individuals 
store concepts in memory as nodes connected by paths [7]. 
In order to perform cognitive tasks, individuals must recall 
concepts from memory; which follows a process of 
spreading activation: a node is primed in memory, which 
leads to paths connecting to it being activated [7]. Activation 
has to be strong enough for a search to reach a connected 
node. Empirical tests show that greater activation strength 
enables faster and more accurate recall [7]. CM leads to 
efficient mental representations by reducing activation 
strength and excluding relevant nodes. 
Secondly, the problem-solving theories suggest that the 
quality of a person’s mental representation of a domain is a 
key driver of his/her ability to reason about the domain [8]. 
Specifically, problem solving theories suggest that a person 
reasons about a domain is by drawing on his/her mental 
representation of the domain together with his/her mental 
representation of the problem s/he faces about the domain to 
construct a “problem space” in memory [8]. Tests show that 
problem solving performance is driven by a person’s ability 
to search his/her problem space [8], [9]. Since semantic 
network theory suggests that CM leads to efficient mental 
representations, we can therefore propose that CM reduce 
analysts’ ability to construct inefficient problem spaces in 
memory and thereby increase analysts’ ability to search their 
problem space when reasoning about the domain. 
B. Conceptual Schema Understanding Task 
Schema understanding tasks can be viewed as either 
read-to-do (with access to the schema) [10] or read-to-recall 
tasks (without access to the schema) [11]. Recall tasks have 
been used to investigate problem solvers’ knowledge 
structures, that is, chunks of knowledge that are stored in 
internal memory and reused when appropriate [12].

Two types of comprehension tasks that have been 
employed in prior Information Systems (IS) researches are 
supported in the education literature, which identifies two 
different types of knowledge, syntactic and semantic [13], 
[14]. Syntactic knowledge involves understanding the 
vocabulary specific to a modeling formalism and syntactic 
comprehension tasks are those that assess the understanding 
of just the syntax of the formalism associated with a schema. 
Semantic knowledge involves understanding the meaning, or 
the semantics, of the data embedded in the conceptual 
schema. Thus, semantic comprehension tasks are those that 
assess the understanding of the data semantics conveyed 
through constructs in the schema [15]. More recently, 
researchers have investigated tasks that require a deeper level 
of understanding than comprehension tasks, tasks that are 
referred to as problem-solving tasks [16]. 
C. Cognitive Fit 
The notion of task-technology cognitive fit is viewed as 
an important factor determining whether the use of 
technology would result in performance improvement [17], 
[18], [19]. Briefly, the task-technology fit hypothesis argues 
that for an IS to have a positive impact on performance, it 
must be designed and utilized in such a way that it fits with 
the tasks it supports. When the information emphasized by 
the presentation matches the task, DMs can use the same 
mental representation and decision processes for both the 
presentation and the task, resulting in faster and more 
accurate solutions [19]. When a mismatch occurs, one of two 
processes will occur. Firstly, DMs may transform the 
presented data to better match the task, which might increase 
the time needed and might decrease accuracy because any 
transformation can introduce errors [19]. Secondly, DMs 
may adjust their decision processes to match the presentation 
[20], decreasing accuracy and increasing time because the 
information does not match the ultimate needs of the task. 
To better understand this relationship, we first need to 
explain the key concept equivocality of information. High 
equivocality means confusion and lack of understanding 
[21]. Note that at times the literature uses the term 
equivocality to describe the characteristics of tasks. In this 
paper, the term exclusively uses to describe information 
characteristics. Furthermore, less-analyzable task is consists 
of syntactic and semantic knowledge. By contrast, problem 
solving task is presented as analyzable task. Therefore, we 
will examine whether quality in decision making can be 
changed by the task type (analyzable vs less-analyzable) of 
Text and CM and its equivocality. 
D. Hypotheses 
In this study, three hypotheses will be verified through 
one experiment. In this experiment, CM-based method is 
proposed to be more effective than text-based method under 
analyzable tasks by comparing CM-based method with Text-
based method. This was done by analyzing the difference in 
problem solving between analyzable tasks and less-
analyzable tasks within the framework of equivocality of 
information in CM and Text. For analyzable tasks, since the 
information needed to perform the task is known and clear 
guidelines about how to perform the task exist, the DM does 
not have to rely on subjective judgments or contextual 
information to interpret the situation or task. CM can capture 
perception of decision makers’ knowledge in real world, and 
describe and facilitate elaboration. CM is to support a “what-
if” and “goal seeking” analysis. In this regard, CM-based 
method can decrease the equivocality. It is because CM-
based method can provide more accurate information than 
text-base method in solving analyzable tasks. Therefore, a 
CM-based representation is more effective than a text-based 
representation in supporting the information needs of 
analyzable tasks. 
 
H1: For analyzable tasks, the CM-based representation, 
when compared to the text-based representation, will lead to 
a lower level of perceived equivocality. 
 
In this study, less-analyzable task is consists of syntactic 
and semantic knowledge. In other words, less-analyzable 
task means that DMs need knowledge of surface level that 
asks simply the true and the false of the facts. In this case, it 
is assumed that there will be little difference between Text-
based method and CM-based method. 
 
H2: For less-analyzable tasks, there will be no difference 
between the multimedia and the text-based representation in 
terms of the perceived equivocality level. 
 
Davis and his colleagues [22], [23] observed that if users 
perceive a system to be useful, they are more likely to use it. 
Other studies [24], [25] also found further support for the 
impact of perceived usefulness on system use. These studies 
established the theoretical and practical importance of 
perceived usefulness. Extending from the research in 
perceived usefulness, one can argue that users only perceive 
the system to be useful if the system helps them to perform 
the tasks it was designed for. 
 
H3: The CM-based representation will be perceived as more 
useful than the text-based representation. 
 
III. 
OVERVIEW OF THE EXPERIMENTS 
The experiment involved less-analyzable tasks and 
analyzable tasks, and two representations, text-based and 
CM-based information, representing two levels of richness. 
The two were equivalent in terms of text and diagram 
information content. It is hypothesized that the task required 
only surface-level understanding of the domain. Thus, it is 
predicted that the text effect would dominate elaborative and 
inferential diagram effects. Participants who used CM would 
therefore outperform participants who used text only. In 
analyzable tasks, it is hypothesized that this task requires a 
deep level understanding of a domain if it is to be performed 
effectively. Thus, it is predicted that the elaborative and 
inferential 
effects 
would 
dominate 
the 
text effect. 
Participants who used causal map only would therefore 
outperform participants who used text. The results supported 
this prediction.

IV. 
EXPERIMENT 
To test the first hypotheses, we conducted a laboratory 
experiment. The experiment employs a 2 x 2 x 2 design. The 
within-subject factors are representation type (CM-based vs. 
text-based representation) and task type (analyzable vs. less-
analyzable task). The between subject factor is the order 
(text-CM vs. CM-text).  
A. Task Setting 
1) Representation Type 
Two 
representations, 
text-based 
and 
CM-based 
information, representing two levels of richness were 
compared. The two were equivalent in terms of text and 
diagram information content. Appendix A shows the 
corresponding subjects the text-based method when the same 
selection was made. In both methods, subjects could 
reexamine the information which was presented with CM-
based method and text-based method. 
 
2) Analyzable and Less-analyzable Task Type 
In this study, the less-analyzable task consisted of 
syntactic and semantic comprehension tasks. By contrast, 
problem solving task was presented as analyzable task. The 
task 
employed 
consisted 
of 
evaluating 
the 
ambiguity/equivocality level of the information relating to 17 
statements. Subjects were asked to evaluate the degree to 
which they felt that the information needed to evaluate the 17 
statements, as provided by the method, was equivocal. Ten 
of these statements were related to facts that were surface-
level understanding stated in the method; these formed the 
less-analyzable task. The other seven required subjects to 
make judgments about the deep-level understanding of 
problem solving task stated in the method; they formed the 
analyzable task. All subjects performed both tasks. 
 
3) Order 
Subjects performed the experimental task twice: once 
with the text-based method and once with the CM-based 
method. Half of the subjects were randomly assigned to use 
the text-based method first (text-CM condition) while the 
other half started with the CM-based system (CM-text 
condition). Helson’s Adaptation-Level Theory [26], [27] 
suggests that a subject’s response to a judgmental task 
depends on three things: (1) sum of the subject’s past 
experiences, (2) the context or background (for making 
comparison judgments), and (3) the stimulus given (the 
representation type in this study). To the extent that there is 
no context/background given, the subject will make a 
judgment using the sum total of all his/her previous 
experiences about what he/she perceived as ambiguous. 
Given that each of the subjects has different experiences, 
when no context/background is provided there is no common 
frame of reference to make a judgment. The closer a context 
is provided to the judgment, the more it will be made within 
that context rather than based on the sum of all past 
experience. Following Helson’s argument, we used the first 
representation to allow our subjects to establish a frame of 
reference. The second representation was then presented and 
subjects were asked to evaluate the ambiguity level of the 
second as compared to that of the first. To take into 
consideration the potential learning effect, as is customarily 
done, we used a counter-balanced design by asking half of 
the subjects to first evaluate using the text-based and the 
other 
half 
to 
first 
evaluate 
using 
the 
CM-based 
representation. 
B. Participants 
The participants are college students who took one or two 
of the five undergraduate computer science courses offered 
by the School of Business Administration. The participants 
were organized into two groups. The 34 pre-test responses 
from the first group were used to pretest the manipulation 
check between analyzable and less-analyzable tasks. Pair t-
test was conducted to check analyzability after reviewing 17 
analyzable and less-analyzable tasks with students. The 
results show that there is a difference between analyzable 
and less-analyzable tasks (t(33) = 4.52, p<0.001). These 
results suggest that the experimental manipulation between 
analyzable and less-analyzable tasks was successful. 
The 64 responses of the second group were used to prove 
research hypotheses. They participated on a voluntary basis 
following the instruction that bonus points will be given for 
those who completed surveys successfully within the time 
limit. Of the respondents, 38 were male and 26 were female. 
On average, they were 24.5 years old, and they used the 
Internet for 21 hours per week.  
C. Dependent Variables 
Two dependent variables, perceived equivocality and 
perceived usefulness of the system, were used in the 
analyses.  
 
1) Perceived Equivocality 
Two Likert-type scales, adapted from [28], were used to 
measure perceived equivocality of the information used for 
evaluating the 17 statements which comprised the 
experimental task. Since this study focused on the 
equivocality level of information rather than solution, one 
item was not applicable to this study and was dropped. The 
internal reliability of the original instrument, as reported by 
Daft and Macintosh, was 0.73. The modified scale used in 
this study has a higher reliability score (0.86). For each of 
the 17 statements, subjects were asked to indicate (1) if the 
information used to evaluate the statement could be 
interpreted in several ways, and (2) if the information used to 
evaluate the statement could mean different things to 
different members of the website design team. The response 
scale ranged from –3 (full disagreement) to +3 (full 
agreement). For items (1) and (2), the higher score meant 
higher perceived equivocality. 
 
2) Perceived Usefulness 
The 10 item scale proposed by [22] was adapted for this 
present study. The reliability of the instrument, as originally 
reported by Davis, was 0.92. Subjects were asked to rate the 
perceived usefulness of the second method relative to using 
the first method.

D. Experimental Procedures 
Subjects were run through the experiment one at a time. 
Prior to the experiment, subjects were trained on how to use 
the CM method. The training session lasted about 30 
minutes. Next, subjects were handed a task description (see 
Appendix A) and the questionnaire for this experiment, 
which contained 17 statements. They were told to read 
through the questionnaire before examining the information 
in the method. This procedure was used to help them focus 
on the information needed to respond to the 17 questions. 
Depending on their assignment, subjects first used either the 
text-based method or the CM-based method to examine the 
described with information. After they had completed the 
questionnaire, the subjects were given a five minute rest 
break. After the break, subjects proceeded to second 
experiment. Second experiment was a repeat of first 
experiment, except that subjects used the other method 
(either text-based or CM-based system). At the end of the 
experiment, subjects were given the perceived usefulness 
questionnaire. The entire experiment took about an half and 
hour to complete. 
E. Results 
Data associated with perceived equivocality was 
analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA test with the 
three independent variables, representation, task, and order. 
Table I reports the results. The mean values and standard 
deviations are shown in Table II.

There are several significant outcomes: task (F = 80.073,

representation x order (F = 18.413, p < 0.000), and task x 
representation (F = 38.323, p < 0.000). The focus is on the 
task x representation interaction effect, which provides direct 
evidence for testing H1 and H2.

Figure 1. Task x Representation Interaction Effect 
 
The task x representation interaction effect is depicted in 
Figure 1. For analyzable tasks, the perceived equivocality 
ratings (summarized over the first and second set of ratings) 
associated with CM is lower than that of text (–1.35 for CM 
and 0.09 for text; t = 5.93, p = 0.000). This supports H1, 
which 
states 
that 
for 
analyzable 
tasks, 
CM-based 
representation will lead to lower level of perceived 
equivocality than the text-based representation. For less-
analyzable tasks, the perceived equivocality rating associated 
with the two representations are about the same (-1.81 for 
CM and -1.7 for text; t = 0.536, p < 0.594). This supports 
H2, which states that for less-analyzable tasks, the CM-based 
representation, 
when 
compared 
to 
the 
text-based 
representation, will be no difference in level of perceived 
equivocality.  
The order x representation interaction effect shows that 
the perceived equivocality reduced only when the CM-based 
representation was used after the text-based representation (t 
= 4.01, p < 0.000) but not vice versa (t = 0.78, p = 0.542). 
Consistent with H1 and H2, this suggests that only the CM-
based representation led to lower perceived equivocality. 
Recall the earlier discussion of Helson’s Adaptation 
Theory [26], [27]. How then can we interpret these findings 
within the context of this theory? Given that the first ratings 
were made in the absence of an established frame of 
reference for comparison, based on Helson, we would expect 
that the theoretical differences between text-based and CM-
based representations will be less evident for the first set of 
ratings, but more so for the second set, as they were made 
with a clear basis for comparison. In short, the differences as

delineated in H1 and H2 should be more evident in the 
second ratings than the first. 
Therefore, for H1 (analyzable tasks), we expect to 
observe significant differences in the second ratings between 
CM-based and text-based representations. For the first pair 
of ratings, there is a major difference (0.304 for text vs. -0.28 
for CM; t = 8.23, p < 0.000). However, such differences are 
expected to be weaker in the second ratings, due to lack of a 
frame of reference. For the second pair of ratings (-0.127 for 
text vs. -0.621 for CM; t = 1.292, p = 0.200), there was a no 
significant difference between the text and CM conditions. 
For H2 (less analyzable tasks), as stated previously, we 
will not expect to see any differences between CM and task 
in either the first or second ratings. But, for less analyzable 
tasks, for both the “text-CM” and the “CM-text” conditions, 
the first equivocality ratings are significant difference 
between the text and CM conditions (-1.295 for text versus –
1.955 for CM; t = 2.451, p = 0.02). For the second time (-
2.10 for text and –1.661 for CM; t = 1.53, p = 0.13), the 
equivocality level are no significant difference between the 
text and CM conditions. t-test on the aggregated score on

more useful than the text-based representation in helping 
them to perform the task (t(62) = 18.174, p < 0.000; mean 
score 5.89 vs. 1.55, for the range of 1 to 7). The results on 
perceived usefulness support H3, which states that the CM-
based representation will be perceived as more useful than 
the text-based representation. 
 
V. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS 
In this study, we observed a task cognitive fit relationship 
with regard to perceptions of equivocality. For analyzable 
tasks, only CM-based representation led to lower perceived 
equivocality levels. When subjects were given a second 
representation to perform the task, only those subjects who 
used CM method as the second representation reported a 
level of perceived equivocality that was lower than that 
reported after the first representation was used. This result 
indicates that conventional text-based representation is 
inferior in reducing equivocality for analyzable tasks 
compared to CM-based representation. For less-analyzable 
tasks, whether subjects use a text-based representation or a 
CM-based representation for the second task, their perceived 
equivocality level is the minor difference. This is because 
both representations are effective in conveying the 
information needed to perform less-analyzable tasks. 
However, it should be emphasized that this conclusion is 
based on subjects’ self-reported perceived equivocality levels 
rather than actual task performance, which is often difficult 
to measure when dealing with less-analyzable tasks [20]. 
Overall, we set forth to test our theory in the context of an 
individual decision maker interacting with a CM method to 
decision that was previously experienced and found support 
for the theory.  
There are two limitations of this experiment that warrant 
further discussion and need to be kept in mind when 
interpreting the results observed. The first limitation relates 
to the two tasks used in the experiment. The two tasks were 
chosen based on the construct level definition of task 
analyzability and to maximize the treatment effect variance 
[30]. Since these are two specific operationalizations of the 
construct, more tasks need to be tested to further validate the 
theory. The second limitation relates to the choice of the two 
representations used. To maximum the treatment variance, 
we chose to use text and CM in our operationalization of the 
rich versus lean representation construct. As such, these 
operational definitions only represent two specific instances. 
One interesting future research direction is to test a system 
that has various combinations of text and CM-based 
representation.
