Abstract‚ÄîRecently, a new family of recursive systematic
convolutional (RSC) encoders over Galois Ô¨Åeld GF(
2N)
was
introduced. The present paper considers the parallel turbo
trellis coded modulation (TTCM) scheme using these non-
binary encoders as constituent codes. Besides operating over
a higher order Galois Ô¨Åeld, these encoders use a non-linear
function, the left-circulate (LCIRC) function, to control the
encoder states. It is shown that these rate-(N ‚àí 1) /N GF(
2N)
RSC-LCIRC encoders offer the same performances in terms
of minimum Euclidian distance, effective length, and product
distance, as compared to corresponding binary encoders. More-
over, these RSC-LCIRC encoders are requiring less memory
usage. Extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts are used
to analyze the convergence of the proposed punctured TTCM
schemes, with 8-PSK and 16-QAM modulations, symbol-by-
symbol log-MAP decoding algorithm, when transmitting over
AWGN and Rayleigh non-selective fading channels. EXIT
charts show some improvements in terms of TTCM decoding
schemes convergence for the RSC-LCIRC codes as compared
to their binary counterparts.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the latter years, nonlinear functions proved to be
suitable to implement several telecommunications systems
blocks, such as pseudo-random number generation, spread-
ing for code-division multiple access systems, and encryp-
tion. Among these nonlinear functions the ones operating in
Ô¨Ånite precision are more suitable for digital implementations.
In [1], Frey proposed a nonlinear digital inÔ¨Ånite impulse
response (IIR) Ô¨Ålter for secure communications. The Frey
Ô¨Ålter contains a nonlinear function named left-circulate
function (LCIRC), which provides the chaotic properties
of the Ô¨Ålter. The above mentioned work considered the
Frey encoder as a digital Ô¨Ålter, operating over Galois Ô¨Åeld
GF
(
2N)
. In [2] it was demonstrated that the Frey encoder
with Ô¨Ånite precision (wordlength of N bits) presented in [1]
is a recursive convolutional encoder operating over GF
(
2N)
.
New methods for enhancing the performances of the phase
shift keying - trellis-coded modulation (PSK-TCM) trans-
missions over a noisy channel, using the recursive convolu-
tional LCIRC (RC-LCIRC) encoders, were proposed in [3].
These encoders follow the rules proposed by Ungerboeck
[4] for deÔ¨Åning optimum TCM by proper set partitioning
for channels with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
When assuming a Rayleigh non-selective fading channel,
other designing criteria can be used to optimize the TCM
system performances, such as minimum effective length and
product distance [5]. Turbo coded schemes were developed
as well for the TCM schemes [6], [7]. A family of nonlinear
encoders for turbo TCM (TTCM) scheme was proposed
in [8]. The present paper aims to extend the performances
analysis for these nonlinear TTCM schemes. The extrinsic
information transfer (EXIT) chart is an important tool for vi-
sualizing the exchange of the extrinsic information between
constituent decoders in a turbo receiver scheme [9]. The
EXIT chart was also applied to turbo TCM (TTCM) schemes
to depict the decoding trajectory, allowing the prediction of
bit error rate (BER) waterfall and BER Ô¨Çoor regions [10],
[11]. Therefore, the EXIT chart can be used as a tool in the
design of TTCM schemes [12].
In the present work, the analysis of the TTCM scheme
from [8] is extended by considering also the quadrature am-
plitude modulation (QAM) and a Rayleigh fading channel.
Moreover, the EXIT charts are presented to underline the
convergence behavior of these schemes.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II is present-
ing the recursive systematic convolutional LCIRC (RSC-
LCIRC) encoder operating over Galois Ô¨Åeld GF
(
2N)
and the
optimum set partitioning for two-dimentional TCM schemes.
The minimum Euclidian distance, minimum effective length
and product distance are estimated for the AWGN channel,
and the Rayleigh fading channel, respectively. In Section III,
a parallel TTCM transmission scheme using RSC-LCIRC
component encoders with symbol puncturing is presented.
A symbol-by-symbol log-MAP algorithm is used for the
iterative detection. EXIT charts are plotted in Section IV
to compare the convergence of different TTCM decoding
schemes for the punctured 8-PSK and 16-QAM TTCM
transmissions. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section
V.

schemes are presented. The main component of the RSC
encoder presented in the sequel is the nonlinear LCIRC
function introduced by Frey in [1] for chaotic encryption.
The use of the LCIRC function for channel encoding was
considered for the Ô¨Årst time in [2]. Optimum encoders using
the LCIRC function for TCM schemes were introduced in
[3]. However, despite being characterized by optimum Eu-
clidian distances, these recursive convolutional encoders are
non-systematic. Therefore, the coding features of these non-
systematic encoders are not fully exploited in turbo schemes.
In this section, we introduce a new encoder operating over
Galois Ô¨Åeld GF
(
2N)
, using the LCIRC function, which is
systematic, i.e., the encoder output value speciÔ¨Åes explicitly
the input value. Let us denote by N the wordlength used for
binary representation of each sample. The LCIRC function
performs a bit rotation by placing the most signiÔ¨Åcant bit
to the least signiÔ¨Åcant bit, and shifting the other N ‚àí 1 bits
one position to a higher signiÔ¨Åcance.
The block scheme for a rate (N ‚àí 1) /N RSC-LCIRC
encoder, using one delay element and the LCIRC function
is presented in Fig. 1. For each moment n, un represents
the input data sample, x1n denotes the delay output or the
encoder current state, and en is the output sample. The
superscript U denotes that all the samples are represented
in unsigned N bits wordlength, i.e., uU
n ‚àà
[
0, 2N‚àí1 ‚àí 1
]
,
eU
n ‚àà
[
0, 2N ‚àí 1
]
. The rate for the encoder in Fig. 1 is the
ratio between the input wordlength Nin = N ‚àí 1 and the
output wordlength N, i.e., R = Nin/N [2]. LCIRCN‚àí1
represents the LCIRC function application for N ‚àí 1 times
consecutively. Both adders and the multiplier are modulo-2N
operators. The modulo-2 block extracts the least signiÔ¨Åcant
bit, denoted by pn, from the encoder current state value,
x1n. Therefore, pn is the parity bit for the systematic rate
(N ‚àí 1) /N encoder. It is important to demonstrate that the
encoder is systematic, i.e., the encoder output binary repre-
sentation codeword eU
n includes the representation codeword
of the encoder input uU
n . Hence, the output is obtained by
shifting the N ‚àí 1 bits of the input representation codeword
by one position to a higher signiÔ¨Åcance, and adding the
parity bit pn to the least signiÔ¨Åcant position, a position
that was left empty, inside the N bits output codeword, by
the previously mentioned shifting. The one position shifting

presented above is equivalent to a multiplication by 2 in the

Ô¨Åeld. Therefore, the encoder output value eU

given by the following GF
(

equation:

n + pn = 2 ¬∑ uU

(1)
The trellis complexity of the codes generated with the
scheme in Fig. 1 increases with the wordlength N, because
the number of trellis states grows exponentially with the
output wordlength, i.e., 2N, while the number of transitions
originating from and ending in the same state grows expo-
nentially with the input wordlength, i.e., 2N‚àí1.
The set partitioning for the punctured TTCM scheme,
which optimizes the initialization of the a priori information
for the Ô¨Årst decoder, during the Ô¨Årst iteration, was introduced
in [6], and has two features. First of all, the set partitioning
follows the Ungerboeck optimum set partitioning rules from
[4], and secondly, the constellation points associated to the
same group of N ‚àí1 systematic information bits, i.e., to the
same input symbol uU
n , but differing in the least signiÔ¨Åcant
bit, i.e., the parity bit pn, should be placed at the minimum
distance in the set, ‚àÜ0,2N‚àíary modulation. Following these
two requirements, the optimum set partitioning rule for 16-
QAM is depicted in Fig. 2. The Ô¨Årst feature maximizes the
minimum Euclidian distance of the component TCM code,
while the second feature minimizes the distance between
elements of the subsets associated to identical systematic
bits, denoted by ovals in Fig. 2, for the global punctured
TTCM code.
It can be easily demonstrated that the minimum Euclidian
distance for the 2N-ary TCM component encoder presented
in Fig. 1, using the properly partitioned constellations, has
the following expression:

In Table I, some values of the minimum distance of the
TCM encoder in Fig. 1 are presented for different values of
N, and for the PSK and QAM constellations, respectively.
The associated coding rates are presented in the second
column. It can be easily noticed from (2) that all the rate

(N ‚àí 1) /N, for any N value, the RSC-LCIRC encoders
have the same minimum distances as the corresponding
binary optimum encoders [6], [7]. When transmitting over
a Rayleigh non-selective fading channel the TCM system
performances depend mainly on two parameters, i.e., the
minimum effective length, and the minimum product dis-
tance [5]. We call the minimum effective length lm the
length of the shortest path pair of encoder output values (xn,
x‚Ä≤
n). Among these paths of length lm there is one having the
smallest product distance d2
p = Œ†lm
n=1,xnÃ∏=x‚Ä≤
n | xn ‚àí x‚Ä≤
n |2.
The values of these parameters are presented in the last
two columns from Table I, for the same RSC-LCIRC codes.
Again, the RSC-LCIRC encoders have the same values for
minimum effective length and product distance, as their
binary counterparts [5]. However, the GF
(
2N)
RSC-LCIRC
encoders are less complex than the corresponding binary
encoders in terms of memory usage. The memory size of the
binary encoders increases logarithmically with the number of
states in the trellis, while the GF
(
2N)
RSC-LCIRC encoders
include only one delay element, no matter what the trellis
complexity is. As another advantage of these encoders, we
can also mention the Euclidian distance compact expression
(2) as a function of N.
III. RSC-LCIRC ENCODER IN TURBO-TCM SCHEME
Fig. 3 shows the turbo TCM transmitter for 2N-ary
modulation. The information 2N‚àí1-ary symbol sequence
un and its block-wise interleaved version u(i)
n
are fed into
two identical component encoders RSC-LCIRC1 and RSC-
LCIRC2 of rate (N ‚àí 1) /N. The encoders‚Äô outputs are
selected alternatively and mapped into 2N-ary modulated
symbol sequence xn. The output of the bottom encoder
is deinterleaved according to the inverse operation of the
interleaver. This ensures that at the input of the symbol
selector, the N ‚àí1 information bits from the 2N‚àí1-ary input
symbol, partly deÔ¨Åning the encoded 2N-ary symbols of both
the upper and lower input, are identical [6], [7]. Therefore, if
the selector is switched on a symbol base, the mapper output
is a punctured version of the two encoded sequences, and
the N ‚àí 1 information bits appear only once, mapped in a
single transmitted symbol selected either from e1n sequence
or from e2n sequence. Nevertheless, the remaining parity

bit carried by the transmitted symbol is taken alternatively
from the upper and lower encoder. Hence, the overall coding
rate for the scheme in Fig. 3 is (N ‚àí 1) /N. The 2N-levels
modulated symbol sequence is transmitted over a noisy and
non-selective fading channel. The received signal over the
n-th symbol interval is given by:
yn = hnxn + wn
(3)
where wn is an AWGN sequence with E
[
|wn|2]
= N0, and
xn denotes the 2N-levels symbol value mapped from the
encoders output sequences (e1n, e2n) by puncturing over
the n-th symbol interval. The coefÔ¨Åcient hn is the path gain
from transmit antenna to receive antenna, having a Rayleigh
distribution. The path gains are modeled as the absolute
part of samples of independent complex Gaussian random
variables with variance 0.5 per real dimension. The wireless
channel is assumed to be quasistatic, i.e., the path gain value
is constant over a group of symbol intervals, and varies from
one group of symbols to another. The receiver structure
including two component decoders that use the symbol-
by-symbol log-MAP algorithm was introduced in [6]. The
decoding process is similar to the binary turbo decoding,
except that the symbol probability is used as the extrinsic
information rather than the bit probability [6], [7]. The log-
MAP decoder computes the log likelihood ratio (LLR) for
each group of information bits transmitted at the n-th symbol
interval un, embedded in the 2N‚àí1-ary input symbol taking
one of the integer values j ‚àà {0, 1, ..., 2N‚àí1 ‚àí 1} as [7]
L (un = j) = ln P (un = j|y)
P (un = 0|y)
(4)
where y is the received signal vector. The symbol-by-symbol
log-MAP decoder operates on an L symbols block basis.
Hence, in all equations the symbol time variable n takes
values between 1 and L. We assume that the receiver has
perfect side information on the path gains (hn). The input
symbol j with the largest LLR in (4) is chosen as the hard
decision output.
A very important tool for the iterative decoding per-
formances analysis consists in the EXIT chart, which de-

scribes the extrinsic mutual information exchange between
constituent decoders. A complexity efÔ¨Åcient method for
generating the symbol-based EXIT charts from symbol-
based a posteriori probabilities (APPs) was proposed in [11].
The expression for the average extrinsic information IE (u),
estimated at the output of the decoder for the input symbol
vector u, is given by [11]:

where L is the number of information symbols in the
decoded block, N ‚àí 1 is the number of information bits per
input symbol, u(i)
n
is the presumed transmitted information
symbol at time instant n for i ‚àà {1, 2, ..., 2N‚àí1}, and e (¬∑)
is the extrinsic probability. The expectation E [¬∑] can be
approximated by simple time-averaging of the extrinsic
probabilities of the information symbol. We propose to
approximate the extrinsic probability as the normalized
joint extrinsic and systematic information of the log-MAP
decoder:
eD

u(i)

)
‚âà
exp (LD,es (un = i))
‚àë2N‚àí1
i=1
exp (LD,es (un = i))
(6)
In equations (5) and (6), D denotes the decoder number, i.e.,
D ‚àà {1, 2}. On the other hand, computing an exact value
of the extrinsic probability requires that the systematic and
parity parts of the channel observation variables are indepen-
dent. Thus, equation (6) represents only an approximation
of the true extrinsic information. The average a priori infor-
mation IA (u) is computed in a similar manner. The EXIT
chart is obtained by representing, on the same diagram, the
decoder 1 transfer characteristic, i.e., IE,1 = T (IA,1), and
the decoder 2 transfer characteristic, i.e., IE,2 = T (IA,2),
for a constant Eb/N0 value. The axes of the decoder 2
transfer characteristic are swapped.
IV. SIMULATIONS RESULTS
The TTCM scheme presented in Section III using the
RSC-LCIRC encoders presented in Section II was tested
for 8-PSK and 16-QAM by means of simulations over
an AWGN non-faded channel, and over an AWGN and
non-selective fading channel, respectively. Both component
encoders in the TTCM scheme are identical rate-2/3 RSC-
LCIRC encoders for 8-PSK, and rate-3/4 for 16-QAM,
respectively. The modulation is using the optimum set par-
titioning for the punctured TTCM scheme as presented in
Section II. The symbol interleavers used for simulations are
pseudo-random and operate independently on even and odd
positions [6]. The symbol-by-symbol log-MAP decoding
algorithm is used in the receiver. The decoding conver-
gence is investigated for several Eb/N0 values, where Eb
is the signal energy per bit and N0 is one-sided power
spectral density of the AWGN noise. The interleaver block
includes 1024 symbols. As references, we considered the

corresponding optimum binary encoders. Therefore, for rate-
2/3 8-PSK TTCM scheme the optimum binary encoder
with 8 states is given by the the generator polynomials,
represented in octal notation [11, 02, 04] [6]. The rate-3/4
optimum binary encoder with 16 states, considered as ref-
erence, was determined in [7] for 16-QAM TTCM with
the generator polynomials [23, 35, 33, 37]. In the following,
EXIT charts are contrived for 8PSK and 16QAM schemes
presented above, using a simulation procedure described in
[11]. These EXIT charts are relevant for the TTCM decoder
convergence analysis, revealing important features, such as
BER turbo cliff and BER Ô¨Çoor regions. The average extrinsic
information IE (u) and the average a priori information
IA (u) are estimated using equation (5), assuming that the
extrinsic probability is approximated with (6). Fig. 4 shows
the extrinsic information transfer characteristic of 8PSK-
RSC-LCIRC-TTCM decoder for a fading channel, assuming
a variable Eb/N0. The considered scenario assumes the
transmission over a non-selective Rayleigh fading channel,
LCIRC encoded 8PSK TTCM scheme, and a blocklength
of 214 symbols. Analyzing the curves in Fig. 4 one can
easily notice that above Eb/N0 = 6.4 dB, the average
decoding trajectory obtained from real simulations shows
convergence. In Fig. 5(a), the EXIT chart for Eb/N0 = 6.5
dB is depicted. This EXIT chart plots the bottleneck region
with the decoding trajectory just managing to pass through
a narrow tunnel, which corresponds to the BER waterfall
region. In Fig. 5(a), the convergence is almost reached after
30 iterations. The EXIT chart obtained under the same
assumptions, for the corresponding binary encoder, is plotted
in Fig. 5(b). It is clear that for the binary case decoder the
trajectory gets stuck as compared to the LCIRC decoder, for
Eb/N0 = 6.5 dB, assuming the same number of iterations.
In Fig. 5(c) the EXIT chart corresponding to the wide-open
region is depicted. The scenario is identical to the previous
one, but for Eb/N0 = 13 dB. This region is related to

teristic of 16QAM-RSC-LCIRC-TTCM decoder for a non-
fading channel, assuming a variable Eb/N0. A blocklength
of 214 symbols was considered. Analyzing the curves in
Fig. 6, one can easily notice that above Eb/N0 = 5.4 dB, the
average decoding trajectory shows convergence. In Fig. 7(a),
the EXIT chart for Eb/N0 = 5.4 dB is depicted. This EXIT
chart plots the bottleneck region, which corresponds to the
BER waterfall region. In Fig. 7(a), the convergence is almost
reached after 10 iterations. The EXIT chart obtained under
the same assumptions, for the corresponding binary encoder,
is plotted in Fig. 7(b). It is clear that for the binary case
decoder, the trajectory is better than the LCIRC decoder one.
In fact, the binary decoder needs less iterations (only 7) to
converge, and the EXIT diagram is wider. In Fig. 7(c) the
EXIT chart for Eb/N0 = 6 dB, corresponding to the wide-
open region, is depicted. In this case, the LCIRC decoder
outperforms its binary counterpart, due to the wider opening
of the EXIT chart. Moreover, the convergence is almost
reached after 4 iterations. As a conclusion, the LCIRC
outperforms the binary case for Eb/N0 > 5.8 dB, while
the opposite happens for lower values of Eb/N0.
V. CONCLUSION
It was demonstrated that using the LCIRC function, efÔ¨Å-
cient RSC encoders over GF
(
2N)
can be designed for punc-
tured TTCM transmissions. A generalized 1-delay GF(2N)
RSC encoder scheme using LCIRC was deÔ¨Åned, for any
possible encoding rate of (N ‚àí 1) /N. It was shown that
LCIRC-based encoders offer at least the same performances
as conventional binary encoders for the rate-(N ‚àí 1) /N
schemes. EXIT charts were provided to demonstrate their
convergence properties. In perspective, we intend to extend
the GF(2N) RSC encoders design using different nonlinear
functions.
