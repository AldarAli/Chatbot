Abstract—Digitalization is one of the words everyone gets to 
hear almost every day. The need to digitalize information and 
services is greater than ever. Municipalities try to digitalize 
themselves to service their citizens. First steps show 
municipalities starting different projects for digitalization. 
Nevertheless, a phenomenon, which is often seen, is that those 
projects do not have a common aim they are aligning to. As an 
instrument, digital strategies can help municipalities to align 
their projects, leading the way into digital transformation. 
However, what is a digital strategy and how is it structured? 
What can recent literature teach us about digital strategies? 
How 
can 
digital 
strategies 
help 
to 
support 
digital 
transformation processes in municipalities? To answer these 
questions, we conducted a systematical but selective literature 
research on digital strategies in the Information Systems (IS) 
and the public sector. We found that both literature streams 
show the development of a fusion between business and IS 
strategies leading to new concepts of capabilities, needed in 
municipalities to develop and monitor digital strategies.   
Keywords-Digital Strategy; Literature Research; Public 
Sector.  
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Digitalization is becoming one the most important words 
nowadays when we talk about transformation processes. 
With the digital age at hand, we seek for ways to digitalize 
the world around us, as everything needs to be digitalized. 
This is a phenomenon, which we can see in the private as 
well as in the public sector. Especially the public sector, 
which is interested in the needs of their citizen are on their 
way to digitalize e.g., their public services [1].  
Looking at transformation processes in the past, we can 
see that strategies are instruments, which were often used to 
guide ways into the future. Mintzberg [2] defines strategies 
as patterns in a stream of decisions guiding the way for 
future actions.  
In the last century, the concept of strategy developed in 
different ways regarding the stream of research we are 
looking at. For example, Jahn et al. [3] looked at strategies 
and tactics from the unit of analysis of employees, whereas 
Mintzberg [2] and Atkins and Lowe [4] looked at strategies 
from the perspective of businesses. Gottschalk [5] and 
Arvidsson et al. [6] looked at strategies from the perspective 
of Information Technology (IT) in organizations. As an 
example from IT strategies, Chen et al. [7] conducted a 
comprehensive literature review on Information Systems (IS) 
strategies in the IS literature. As an example, Chen et al. [7] 
showed that different studies named IS strategies in diverse 
ways. 
However, 
after 
they 
conducted 
the 
reconceptualization, measurement and implications of IS 
Strategies, recent literature is missing a research based on 
new developments of strategies which occur due to 
digitalization. While there has been an extensive debate on 
digital strategies, especially for municipalities, in practice, 
recent research has not developed a clear theoretical 
understanding of the phenomenon describing what digital 
strategies are and how they can help municipalities as 
guidelines in digital transformation processes. In order to 
address our objectives, this paper is guided by the following 
research question (RQ): 
 
RQ1: How does recent literature define and use digital 
strategies as a guideline for digital transformation processes? 
 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In 
the second section, we give a short background of the 
emergence of digital strategies in practice and science. 
Section 3, describes the research design of this study. In 
Section 4, the findings of the literature review are presented 
showing recent literature regarding the conceptual use of 
digital strategies. Section 5 discusses implications for theory 
and practice, especially municipalities, shows the limitations 
of the study, and gives recommendations for future research. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
An emerging topic for municipalities is the chances and 
challenges of digital transformation. With IT becoming 
ubiquitous, phenomenons like IT consumerization emerge. 
IT consumerization describes the use of consumer market 
mobile devices (e.g., wearables, smartphones, tablets) and 
shows the phenomenon of how citizens are able to engage in 
diverse governmental topics from everywhere at any time 
[8]–[11]. Thus, digital services around citizens are becoming 
more and more important [12]. However, not only services 
are important but also the whole governmental digital 
transformation becomes necessary (e.g., transformation of 
internal administrative processes, engaging diverse actors in 
decision-making processes and planning and implementing 
projects). At this point, digital strategies can help

municipalities to set guidelines for digital transformation 
processes.  
Recent literature has already studied the phenomenon of 
strategies, for example in the management studies [2][4], 
[13], in IS research [5][7] and of individuals regarding their 
use of mobile technologies [3][14][15]. In their literature 
review, Chen et al. [7] give a clear overview of different 
definitions of IS and IT strategy in literature. They also 
identified three conceptions of IS strategy: “(1) IS strategy as 
the use of IS to support business strategy; (2) IS strategy as 
the master plan of the IS function; and (3) IS strategy as the 
shared view of the IS role within the organization” [7] 
(p.233). Niehaves et al. [16] found in their case study 
structural features of digital strategies for municipalities. 
They found that the denomination of strategic alignment, 
strategy formation, core themes and fields of action are 
features, which structure digital strategies for municipalities. 
However, since Chen et al. [7] the emerging concept of 
digital strategies and their development from IS strategies 
has not yet analyzed from a theoretical point of view. The 
construct of digital strategies, especially for municipalities is 
yet understudied. We aim to enrich recent research on digital 
strategies by showing the development of the term digital 
strategy and by listing and describing recent research on the 
construct of digital strategy for municipalities. 
III. 
METHOD 
For our literature review, we applied the framework for 
literature reviewing proposed by vom Brocke et al. [17] 
consisting of 5 steps: (I) definition of review and scope, (II) 
conceptualization of topic, (III) literature search, (IV) 
literature analysis and synthesis and (V) research agenda 
[17]. 
We first defined our review scope using Coopers  
taxonomy of literature reviews [18]. Aligned to Cooper [18], 
we conducted a literature review of digital strategies for 
municipalities. Aligned to the taxonomy, we focused during 
our literature review on research outcomes having the goal to 
summarize our findings to get a more comprehensive inside 
of the term of digital strategies for municipalities. We 
decided to organize our literature review theoretical, as the 
question we are trying to answer is given. We aim to a 
neutral representation perspective and choose our audience 
to be general scholars and practitioners/politicians. We also 
cover our reviewed literature to central/pivotal to our topic. 
Table 1 summarizes our categories taken for the literature 
review. 
Second, we conceptualised our topic. We conduct a 
literature review of digital strategies for municipalities 
concentrating on the term digital strategy and their support 
for digital transformation processes. Regarding vom Brocke 
et al. [17], it is important to pay attention to the fact that a 
review must begin with “a broad conception of what is 
known about the topic and potential areas where knowledge 
may be needed”( p.10).We, therefore, provided a working 
definition of the key term “digital strategy”.  
In their study, Chen et al. [7] defined IS strategy as “the 
organizational perspective on the investment in, deployment, 
use, and management of information systems” (p. 237). Chen 
et al. [7] also found that a variation of expressions have been 
engaged to represent similar constructs such as IT strategy, 
IS strategy, IS/IT strategy or information strategy. However, 
aligning to Niehaves et al. [16] digital strategies are 
understood to be even more, looking not only for examples 
on the investment and management of information systems 
but rather on the whole business [19]. Such a digital business 
strategy could be defined as an “organizational strategy 
formulated and executed by leveraging digital resources to 
create differential value” [19] (p.472) and “to support or 
shape an organization’s competitive strategy, its plan for 
gaining and maintaining competitive advantage”[20] (p.191). 
Against this background and aligning to Niehaves et al. [16], 
we define digital strategy as an organizational strategy 
formulated and executed by leveraging digital resources to 
create differential value to support or shape an organization’s 
competitive strategy, its plan for gaining and maintaining 
competitive advantage. Summarized we define it as a fusion 
of a traditional IS/IT strategy with the business strategy of an 
organization in the digital age. For municipalities this 
definition offers a variety of possibilities how to align their 
digital strategy in practice. For example, it could be their 
own strategy itself aligned to an urban development strategy 
or it could be directly integrated in the urban development 
strategy. 
In the third phase (III), literature search, we conducted 
the actual search-involving database, keyword, backward, 
and forward search, as well as an ongoing evaluation of the 
sources [17]. Table II shows the structure and results of our 
conducted literature review.

As recommended by previous literature [17][21][22], we 
focused on the review articles of high quality. We also 
looked at rankings. For example, vom Brocke et al. [17] 
synthesized ranking for the AIS in order to select journals we 
would search in. Only to take the 10 best-ranked paper did 
not seem like a comprehensive overview for our topic, as we 
looked at the development of the term digital strategy since 
the literature review of Chen et al. [7] supplemented by 
governmental literature. This is the reason why we decided 
to look at the description and aim of each high quality 
journal ranked and take into account the journals, which fit 
into our topic the best. For our topic, we decided it is best to 
look at the eight highest ranked IS Journals (European 
Journal of Information Systems, Information Systems 
Journal, Information Systems Research, Journal of the 
Association of Information Systems, Journal of Management 
Information Systems, MIS Quarterly, Journal of Strategic 
Information Systems, Journal of Information Technology), in 
order to identify “digital strategies in IS”. Building upon the 
research from Chen et al. [7] we filtered, in a second step for 
research articles since the year 2010. As we look specifically 
at the formation of digital strategies for municipalities, we 
choose to look at high quality E-Government Journals with 
IS reference as well, namely Government Information 
Quarterly, Journal of E-Government Research, Transforming 
Government: People, Process & Policy, and Information 
Polity. As those were not included in the research of Chen et 
al. [7], we looked at those from their point of existence until 
now. In general, we looked for journal and publisher 
homepages in order to do a comprehensive literature search.  
Applying our working definition, we used following 
search items, “digital strategy”, “IS strategy” and “IT 
strategy”, during the literature review process. Our working 
definition would lead us to look also for “digital business 
strategy” as well as “smart city strategy” or “e-government 
strategy”.  
After we conducted the literature search (phase III, 
resulting list of literature can be seen in Table III), we 
analyzed and synthesised our literature (phase IV) as 
recommended and developed by and adapted by Webster and 
Watson [22]. As our aim was to focus on research outcomes 
with the goal of current issues, we analysed the current 
literature on digital strategies and derived key aspects out of 
the different research papers.  
We report that we found 218 Articles in 13 Journals 
looking for our three search items. However, we have to note 
that as our working definition let us expect, and as already 
presented by Chen et al. [7], IS- and IT Strategy led to 
almost the same results. We found 20 articles to help us get a 
glimpse of digital strategies as guideline for digital 
transformation processes, in the public sector and across 
organizations. Aligning to our taxonomy of literature 
research and our definition of digital strategy, we were only 
able to identify 20 research articles, which were able to help 
us answering our research question. This also shows how 
understudied this phenomenon is in literature. We conducted 
our analysis focusing on the unit of analysis explored in each 
research paper, the context of digital strategy and the key 
aspects of the research outcomes summarized. We classified 
the Unit of Analysis in Organizations (O), Government (G) 
and the Individual (I). As our working definition shows, 
35

COLLA 2019 : The Ninth International Conference on Advanced Collaborative Networks, Systems and Applications

digital strategies are important for the Institutional level. 
This is the reason why we excluded paper where the Unit of 
analysis is the individual and concentrated on paper 
examining governmental institutions and private sector 
companies.  
The analysis of our listed research paper led us to phase 
V of the framework for literature reviewing proposed by 
vom Brocke et al. [17]. Phase V describes how the synthesis 
of literature (phase IV) results in a research agenda (V). In 
our study, the result of our synthesis is our resulting research 
questions (RQ1: How does recent literature define and use 
digital strategies as a guideline for digital transformation 
processes?). 
IV. 
FINDINGS  
The following section will show our findings which are 
divided into two parts: First, development of the term and 
use of digital strategies as a guideline for digital 
transformation processes in E-Government- Literature; 
Second, development of the term and use of digital strategies 
as a guideline for digital transformation processes in IS-
Literature since 2010. 
A. Development of the term and use of digital strategies as 
a guideline for digital transformation processes in E-
Government- Literature.  
We noticed a change in definition of the term digital 
strategy in the E-Government Literature showing that in 
2005 Gil-Garcia and Pardo [23] described the term strategy 
as practical guidelines and systematic long-term approaches 
to problems in order to further e.g., e-government goals.  
In 2009, Yoon and Chae [24] conducted a study of 
national strategies for ICT (also called “national e-
Strategy”), which is supposed  to contribute to economic 
transformation. In this study, the trend to contribute to 
economic transformation with higher aligned strategies 
developed.  
In 2010, Shareef et al. [25] examined implementation 
strategies of electronic-government which are used to gain a 
competitive advantage. In this study, we notice that the 
development of digital strategies in the public sector seems 
to direct towards our definition of digital strategies, 
including competitive advantage of organizations.  
Anthopoulos et al. [26] introduced conceptualization, 
benchmarks and evaluations of the smart city concept. In 
their study, they discovered eight classes of conceptual 
models. The classes address  smart  city architecture,  
governance,  planning  and  management, data and 
knowledge, energy, health, people and environment and 
resulted in an unified smart city model (UFCM) [26].  
In 2018, Pedersen [27] recommended in his study to 
develop more balanced strategies which focus more on 
eliminating the contextual and organizational challenges 
instead of just aiming to increase project level capabilities.  
 
B. Development of the term and use of digital strategies as 
a guideline for digital transformation processes in IS-
Literature since 2010.  
In 2012, Benitez-Amado and Walczuch [28] found in 
their study IT capability to be an enabler of proactive 
environmental strategies. These strategies, as they found, 
mediate the effects of IT on firm performance. The finding 
of Benitez-Amado and Walczuch [28] can be seen also in 
our applied definition of digital strategies. In our literature 
review, we found in 2013 a special issue in the MIS 
Quarterly regarding digital strategies and their competitive 
advantage [19][29]–[31]. For example, Mithas et al. [29] 
found in their study that “IT both enhances the firm 's current 
(ordinary) 
capabilities 
and 
enables 
new 
(dynamic) 
capabilities, including the flexibility to focus on rapidly 
changing opportunities or to abandon losing initiatives while 
salvaging substantial asset value” (p. 511).  
Arvidsson et al. [6] conceptualized in their study the 
concept of strategy blindness. Strategy blindness describes 
“the organizational incapability to realize the strategic intent 
of implemented, available system capabilities” [6] (p. 45).  
In 2018, Yeow et al. [32] describe the blurring of the 
division between business and IT strategies which lead to a 
fusion between them. The fusion is described as digital 
strategy. Yeow et al. [32] study, found “an aligning process 
model that is comprised of three phases (exploratory, 
building, and extending) and generalizable organizational 
aligning actions that form the organization's sensing, seizing, 
and transforming capacities” (p. 43). 
 
With our study, we aim to enrich recent literature 
regarding digital strategies as a guideline for digital 
transformation of municipalities analyzing the development 
of the term and use of digital strategies in the E-Government 
Literature 
and 
the 
IS 
Literature (since 2010). 
A 
conceptualization of our findings can be seen in Figure 1. As 
our finding, Figure 1 only shows examples of the emerging 
literature streams. Every analyzed 20 papers can be seen in 
the Appendix in Table III. 
As we proposed, aligning to Bharadwaj et al. [19] in both 
literature streams, the term and use of digital strategy 
develops into the description of a fusion of business and IS 
strategies. We also can notice that this development leads to 
new emerging concepts, such as dynamic capabilities and 
strategy blindness in the digital strategy literature [6][29]. 
We also found that the use of digital strategy and its 
definition does not vary if we are looking at smart cities or 
municipalities in the E-government literature or if we look at 
companies showing a consensus for digital strategies as 
guidelines for digital transformation. 
V. 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK 
The following section will show the discussion and will 
give an outlook for future research. 
A. Implications for theory and practice.

strategies as a guideline for digital transformation in E-

Government literature and the IS literature analyzing the 
development of the term and the use of “digital strategies”. 
We enrich research by Chen et al. [7] by extending their 
literature review of IS strategy giving an overview of the 
development of digital strategies in the IS literature since 
2010. We also aim to extend research by Pedersen [27] 
giving empirical evidence that the fusion of business and IS 
strategies is taking place in theory and practice giving rise to 
new concepts like dynamic capabilities. Practice can also 
benefit from our study, as it gives guidance in which 
directions future digital strategies should be developed and 
gives research recommendations where to look for even 
more guidance. But practitioners need to take care, as digital 
strategies have still special features e.g., in their structuration 
[16] even if our study shows a consensus on a meta-level. It 
also shows different ways of developing a digital strategy. 
For example, a digital strategy for municipalities can stand 
on its own as digital strategy or it could be integrated into the 
urban development strategy showing a real fusion of the 
main strategies.

B. Limitations and Outlook.  
Like every other empirical study, our research as well has 
limitations that leave room for future research. Apart from 
the typical limitations of literature reviews [17], it is 
important to acknowledge that we only searched the highest 
8 and 5 ranked journals in the e-government and IS 
literature. Future research could extend our literature by 
including conference papers and book publication to extend 
our conceptualization.
