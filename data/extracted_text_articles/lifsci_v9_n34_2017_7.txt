Abstract - Capturing the benefits generated from investments in 
digital health is key towards demonstrating accountability to 
funders as well as to encouraging widespread adoption by 
clinicians and other health care professionals. The cumulative 
benefits calculation, developed by Canada Health Infoway, is a 
macro-level indicator trended since 2007. It represents 
estimated benefits accruing to various health care system 
stakeholders, as driven by component technologies and their 
associated adoption across the country. In-depth studies, 
validated by external experts in relevant fields, have been 
completed for diagnostic imaging systems, primary and 
ambulatory care electronic medical records, drug information 
systems and telehealth. The financially quantifiable aspects of 
each study are aggregated, trended over time, and indexed to 
inflation. From 2007 to 2016 benefits accrued to the Canadian 
health care system exceeded $19B. These benefits were driven 
by improvements such as clinician and clinical practice 
productivity; avoided health system utilization due to improved 
patient safety; reduced patient time and expense and fewer 
duplicate tests. Cumulative benefits represent the aggregated 
value accrued to various health system stakeholders that has 
been realized or could be harvested through re-organized 
business processes.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extended version of work published in [1]. 
We extend our previous work by updating data for an 
additional year (2016), elaborating on the studies supporting 
the findings, and further detailing the methods, inputs and 
limitations of the study. Federal and provincial/territorial 
governments across Canada have been investing in the 
creation of interoperable electronic health records (iEHRs) 
and other means for connecting health care providers with 
patient information for more than a decade [2]. While 
deployment progress and rates of usage vary across provinces 
and territories, the initiative has reached mainstream adoption 
by clinicians and other health care professionals. An iEHR is 
a secure, integrated view of a person’s medical records from 
all systems in the network; it provides a comprehensive view 
of a patient’s medical history. It is designed to facilitate the 
sharing of data across the continuum of care, health care 
delivery organizations, and geographical areas [3]. The 
potential benefits of the iEHR are substantial – improved 
quality of care, health system and provider efficiencies, 
improved access to care and use of health data to better 
manage the health system and facilitate research.   Typically, 
the iEHR integrates diagnostic imaging, laboratory, and 
medication data, along with clinical notes, to provide a 
longitudinal view of a patient’s clinical history.  As such, it is 
a similar concept to that of a Health Information Exchange 
(HIE) [4]. Across Canada, iEHRs are at various stages of 
implementation and maturity and have evolved according to 
provincial/territorial strategies and priorities.  As of 2017, 
each province and territory in Canada has an iEHR in place 
[5]. 
The iEHR acts as a complement to point of service 
applications such as EMRs in physician offices or hospital 
information systems. It is accessed through integration with 
clinical systems or through standalone, web-enabled viewers. 
Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between point of service 
applications and the iEHR infostructure (clinical data 
repositories in blue boxes) [6].

Regular measurement of adoption and maturity for these 
technologies has made progress easy to follow and manage.  
For example, in the 2015 Commonwealth Fund Survey, 73% 
of all family physicians reported they do use electronic 
records to enter and retrieve clinical notes [7]. They form part 
of the 301,000 health care professionals (more than half of 
estimated potential users) who were accessing one or more of 
the following sources for patient information needed to 
provide care (lab, DI, drug) in 2017.  Of these, more than 
162,000 were actively accessing two or more of these clinical 
information sources [8][9]. As the trend in Figure 2 illustrates, 
the number of active users has accelerated greatly in the past 
three years as adoption of connected health information 
reached a critical mass. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Trending iEHR systems use (2+ clinical domains). Active users 
have accessed the system a minimum of one time per month.  
The rapid increase in adoption is partially attributed to the 
integration of iEHR data into point-of-care systems in 
hospitals and clinics over the last two years. Healthcare 
practitioners and leaders report that this integration is allowing 
providers to incorporate iEHR data into clinical workflows 
[8]. 
In the interest of accountability for the public funds under 
its management, and optimizing the value accruing from 
investment of those funds, Canada Health Infoway (Infoway) 
has developed approaches to evaluate and systematically 
model the estimated value of outcomes related to select digital 
health solutions nationally [10]. The cumulative benefits 
model contains estimates for benefits generated through the 
use of diagnostic imaging systems, drug information systems 
(DIS), ambulatory and primary care electronic medical 
records (EMR), and telehealth.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II 
describes the methods used for calculating cumulative 
benefits. Section III describes the most recent results based on 
data up to the end of 2016. Section IV addresses the 
assumptions and limitations of the model. The conclusion, 
Section V closes the article. 
II. 
METHODS 
The cumulative benefits calculation is driven by individual 
quantitative estimates obtained from pan-Canadian studies 
commissioned by Infoway for each of the clinical domains 
mentioned above. The concept of pan-Canadian studies to 
estimate national value was developed in 2006 to summarize 
results across diverse data domains, settings, evaluation 
methods, and time periods. The studies aim to generate 
estimates, which are as comprehensive as possible, peer 
reviewed by expert panels, and reflecting best available 
evidence. The cumulative benefits studied cover a subset of 
digital health solutions, and as such represent a portion of the 
value from digital health at large.  The studies explored 
domains where federal funds directed through Infoway have 
been invested. A fulsome methodology, published in 2015, 
provides an assessment of gaps and recommendations for 
increasing and optimizing the use and spread of technologies 
in order to increase value over time [10].  Estimates are 
calculated in Canadian dollars realized on an annual basis and 
base assumptions to current contexts are applied and 
documented. Not all outcomes represent direct financial 
savings, but where possible, a value is expressed financially 
to allow comparison of magnitudes. Where the literature does 
not provide sufficient evidence to quantify the current dollar 
value of a specific outcome, the value is omitted from 
quantitative modeling. In instances where a range of estimated 
benefits is provided, the mid-point value was used as a base 
estimate.  The mid-point estimate for each domain-specific 
benefit is highlighted in Table I and corresponds to the year in 
which the study was carried out. Simplicity is a core principle 
of the specification of the quantitative benefits model, with 
most discrete value estimates derived by multiplying the 
magnitude of outcome observed per unit x value of outcome 
x extent of adoption across Canada. Adoption maturity 
variation (e.g., functionalities used, frequency of use, etc.) is 
an important driver of value in digital health deployment, so 
the extent of the adoption used in the model must be matched 
to the maturity required to achieve the magnitude outcome 
applied.

Adoption is determined by examining data from surveys 
of clinicians and patients, usage data from digital health 
solutions, and operational data sets collected by Infoway’s 
partners.  Specific definitions of adoption are designed to suit 
distinct kinds of solutions, and trended over time [10].  
Adoption is measured differently for each domain or 
technology. This is both due to the practicality and feasibility 
of collecting the data and the way in which benefits were 
initially modelled. Adoption metrics are applied in the model 
as drivers of the benefit magnitude. For example, telehealth

benefits are driven by the number of clinical sessions—
defined as consultations involving a clinician and a patient 
[11] whereas EMR benefits are driven by the number of 
Canadian physicians who reported using an EMR to document 
patient information as shown in Figure 3. EMR benefits 
largely accrue to physicians and their practices, and as a result, 
it is fitting for physician adoption to be a driving factor.  
Figure 3. Family physicians in Canada reporting EMR use: 
Commonwealth Fund Surveys.  
Conversely, telehealth benefits largely accrue to patients 
and the health care systems that fund patient expenses, such 
as the Northern Travel Grant in Ontario, which subsidizes 
patient and caregiver travel costs [12]. Diagnostic imaging 
benefits are driven by the adoption of picture archiving and 
communication systems (PACS) by radiologists, physician 
specialists, and emergency department nurses since they are 
the professions who would be the most likely to benefit from 
the workflow improvements facilitated by these systems. 
While other clinicians and health professionals are likely to 
benefit, it was preferable to be conservative in the adoption 
estimate, in line with Infoway’s overall reporting principles 
[10].  Drug information system benefits are driven by a 
combination of the percentage of pharmacies connected to a 
DIS across a given province and the percentage of connected 
physician EMRs.  This reflects the distributed nature of DIS 
benefits where significant portions accrue to pharmacies, 
physician practices, and health system funders among others.

RESULTS 
Between 2007 and 2016, over $19 billion in quantifiable 
benefits have accrued to various parts of the Canadian health 
care system as shown in Figure 4.  
The diagnostic imaging study completed in 2008 
documented benefits totaling an estimated $600M as a result 
of improved productivity for doctors and technologists (by 
more than 25%); improved remote reporting capabilities; 
improved access to care; and quicker turnaround time (by 30-
40%), meaning patients get diagnosed twice as fast and are 
able to start treatment sooner [13].  
The Generation 2 Drug Information Systems Pan-
Canadian Study, completed in 2010, demonstrated benefits

totaling $436M through improved safety and quality of care, 
fewer adverse drug events, reduced prescription abuse, 
increased medication compliance) along with increased 
provider productivity (greater pharmacist efficiency and 
fewer call-backs) and improved drug cost management [14]. 
From 2006 to 2012, the growth of EMRs in Canada 
resulted in cumulative efficiency and patient care benefits 
valued at more than $1.3 billion--$800 million in 
administrative efficiencies and $584 million in health system 
level benefits, such as reduced duplicate tests and adverse 
drug events [15].  
Lastly, use of EMRs in ambulatory care clinics across the 
country has resulted in benefits estimated at $196 million in 
2015 due to clinic efficiencies (improved chart management, 
reduced duplicate tests and reduced transcription costs); 
increased clinic capacity; fewer emergency department visits 
and hospitalizations as a result of adverse drug events; and 
avoided costs for patients due to avoidable delays in care [16]. 
Coloured cells in Table I represent base calculations in the 
years when each respective study was completed. Benefit 
estimates for previous and subsequent years are dependent on 
the changes in adoption of each technology by health care 
professionals and/or practices in each year as compared to the 
base years.  Each year’s estimate is adjusted for inflation 
according to the Statistics Canada Consumer Price Index for 
Health Care [17]. In 2016, the estimated value to the overall 
healthcare system in aggregate exceeded $3B.  These benefits 
accrue to various stakeholders within the system, as shown in 
Figure 5.  The largest piece (54%) accrues to health delivery 
organizations (HDO) such as hospitals, clinics, pharmacies 
along with their respective clinicians and other staff.  The next 
largest piece (36%) accrues to health system funders such as 
ministries of health and other government organizations as a 
result of reductions in reimbursable health system utilization 
and subsidies.  Lastly, 10% of quantified benefits accrue to 
patients and their families largely through time saved in 
accessing care and avoided travel.

It is expected that future pan-Canadian studies, examining 
incremental benefits related to other components of the iEHR 
such as patient access to health information and/or electronic 
prescribing, will expand the model according to the same 
overarching methods described above.  
IV. 
ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS 
The pan-Canadian studies completed to date, which drive 
the cumulative benefits calculation, were completed 
independently, over a number of years (2008 to 2015). As 
such, benefits calculated as part of one study, may also be 
reflected in another. For example, the Generation 2 Drug 
Information Systems study tracked patient safety benefits 
related to printing out prescriptions from physician EMRs—
this benefit was also included in the EMR pan-Canadian 
study. These benefits were included only once when 
aggregating totals in order to eliminate double counting. 
However, due to differing methodologies in each study, 
double counting cannot be eliminated completely. 
Significant limitations were noted in the availability of 
data upon which to model and quantify certain kinds of 
benefits.  For example, anecdotal evidence exists to support 
the idea that productivity and quality improvements in 
healthcare delivery would result in benefits for patients in 
terms of time saved, avoided losses in productivity, and 
improved convenience among others; however, insufficient 
data was available upon which to make evidence-based 
estimates.   As a consequence some types of benefits are 
understated in the cumulative analysis, such as value to 
patients, which is estimated at only 10% of the total. Another 
important example relates to improved compliance with 
quality of care guidelines.  Physicians with EMRs are more 
proactive in caring for their patients, but the long-term 
financial implications of these improvements could not be 
modelled or included with quantitative estimates.  As such, 
these benefits are largely addressed only qualitatively in the 
pan-Canadian studies.   
While it would be desirable to calculate return on 
investment (ROI), benefits and costs accrue to multiple 
stakeholders, making these calculations complicated, and best 
assessed on a stakeholder by stakeholder basis. Furthermore, 
while some stakeholders may see quantifiable benefits from a 
digital health investment, others may have to bear additional 
costs.  Such an example can be found with PACS where 
productivity gains for physicians may increase access for

patients, but result in additional costs to the health system 
since more clinical procedures and/or patient visits can be 
completed with the same inputs.  Nonetheless, this is a useful 
analysis at a macroeconomic level since it can demonstrate the 
positive effects of investing in digital health.  An important 
limitation of this analysis and digital health progress as a 
whole is the gap between value created and hard savings.  This 
limitation was also identified in analysis conducted by the 
RAND Corporation.  In 2005, researchers estimated that rapid 
adoption of health information technology could save the 
United States more than $81 billion annually [18]. In 2012 
RAND revisited the topic and found mixed results and 
growing health expenditures.  The factors that limited 
achievement of value were “sluggish adoption of health IT 
systems, coupled with the choice of systems that are neither 
interoperable nor easy to use; and the failure of health care 
providers and institutions to reengineer care processes to reap 
the full benefits of health IT” [19].  In the Canadian context, 
similar issues apply, but steps are being taken to address these.  
Adoption incentives, focus on interoperability, and attention 
to change management have been important for driving 
mature adoption of solutions.  The pan-Canadian studies apply 
metrics of adoption and maturity as drivers to model benefits, 
so estimated value reflects actual changes in clinical practice.  
In contrast, however, there are aspects of reengineering care 
processes and more broadly, health system organization and 
financing that are not addressed.  For example, time savings 
that accrue to providers who operate on a fee for service basis 
are gains to the specific providers, rather than the health 
system.  Reductions in ER and hospital utilization can add 
capacity, but for hard-savings, Canadian health systems must 
look at how different sectors of the system are financed.  As 
digital health becomes the norm, health systems leaders are 
increasingly aware of the need to be proactive in the 
harvesting of benefits.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The cumulative benefits calculation has been and 
continues to be a useful tool for demonstrating the benefits of 
digital health investments for the purpose of accountability to 
funders and taxpayers. In addition, it is a useful tool to 
persuade clinicians and other health care professional to adopt 
new technologies, and to encourage partners, such as 
jurisdictions and health care provider organizations to 
continue to invest in digital health. Its main limitation is that 
while the total figure represents aggregate value to various 
stakeholders, it does not represent actual dollar savings, since 
other workflow, policy, and personnel changes may need to 
be implemented in order to fully harvest the benefits.  
As connected health information continues to become 
more accessible across a number of clinical domains, it is 
contributing to the continued improvement of quality, access 
and productivity for patients, health care professionals, and 
the health system overall.
