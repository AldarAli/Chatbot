Abstract—Zigzag-shaped Pd-based thin films (pure Pd and Pd-
SiO2 mixture with thickness ranged from 10 nm to 100 nm 
deposited on cover-glass substrates were used to fabricate 
resistive-type hydrogen sensors. It is found that relative 
sensitivities are independent of the thin-film thickness and are 
10%, 7.4%, 6.1%, and 5% for the pure-Pd sensor in 2%, 1.5%, 
1%, and 0.5% H2/N2, respectively. However, its response time 
(ta) is substantially influenced by the thin-film thickness for 
pure-Pd resistive-type sensor. ta is measured with a thickness 
coefficient of 0.14 s/nm in 2% H2/N2 while it is 0.5 s/nm in 1% 
H2/N2. Compared to the pure-Pd sensor, the Pd-SiO2 sensor 
has a shorter response time (20 s to 33 s) and a higher relative 
sensitivity (8.7% to 6.1%) in 1% H2/N2. In 3% H2/N2, relative 
sensitivity is even as high as 15.2% with a response time of 10 s.

 INTRODUCTION 
Hydrogen has attracted attention as a clean energy carrier. 
However, it is volatile and explosive. Thus, a lot of efforts 
have been made to search for high performance hydrogen 
sensors to monitor hydrogen leak. This is required not only 
for better control of hydrogen-involved processes but also for 
health and safety. Various types of semiconductor hydrogen 
sensors have been reported [1]-[6]. Among them, resistive-
type sensors with Pd thin film have been reported to give 
good H2 sensitivity. Previous studies reveal that the sensing 
behavior is of two types, depending on whether the electric 
resistance is increased or decreased upon exposure to H2. 
Our previous work [6] also concluded that the resistive-type 
sensor with the Pd-SiO2 thin-film mixture exhibits much 
better sensing performance than that with the pure-Pd thin 
film did. However, the sensor reversibility was evaluated 
using testing gases with hydrogen concentration below 1% in 
N2. In addition, a fixed 30 nm Pd-SiO2 thin-film mixture or 
pure-Pd thin film was employed. No further effect of thin-
film thickness on sensitivity and response time was 
investigated. In this work, the Pd-SiO2 thin-film mixture was 
again successfully deposited upon a robust and low-cost 
cover-glass substrate. Various hydrogen-containing gases 
with concentration up to 3% in N2 were used to study its 
sensing properties that will be compared to those of the pure-
Pd thin-film. Besides, thin films with thickness ranged from 
10 nm to 100 nm were also employed in the fabrication of 
resistive-type sensors. Effects of thin-film thickness on 
sensitivity and response time were then investigated. It is 
found from experimental results that the Pd-SiO2 thin-film 
mixture really exhibits better sensing performance than that 
of the pure-Pd thin film. Experiments and measurements 
about the proposed resistive-type hydrogen sensor are 
described in following section. In Section III, experimental 
results including key merits, such as sensitivity and response 
time, are addressed. Finally, conclusions are drawn in 
Section IV. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTS 
Thin films of a pure Pd and a Pd-SiO2 mixture were 
deposited on 18 mm  18 mm  0.17 mm cover-glass 
substrates by a thermal evaporator equipped with multiple 
tungsten boats. The background pressure of the thermal 
evaporator for deposition was 210-7 torr. The pure-Pd thin 
film was deposited at the rate of 72 nm /min. The Pd-SiO2 
mixture was deposited by co-evaporating Pd and SiO2 at the 
rate of 80 nm /min. The thickness of the deposited thin film 
was monitored by a quartz crystal head real time. Fig. 1 
shows geometric dimension of the resistive-type sensor 
fabricated in a zigzag-shaped microstructure with a total 
length of 53 mm. The cross-sectional area which the current 
flows through is 50 m  t nm where t is the thickness of the 
deposited thin film. The sensing area of the resistive-type 
sensor is 53 mm × 50 m. Since no other metals are required, 
our Pd-SiO2 resistive-type sensor could be fabricated in a 
simple manner and at low cost. Besides, we found that 
surface morphologies between the pure-Pd and the Pd-SiO2 
thin films are quite different.  That is, the Pd-SiO2 thin film 
is indicative of porous-like morphology [7]-[8]. Hydrogen

detection was carried out using a custom-made flow-through 
test chamber made from stainless steel. A 500 ml/min 
constant flow N2 was used as the carrier gas to achieve a 
baseline.  It allows controlling the gas flow from N2 to gas 
mixtures with various concentrations of 100 ppm to 3% 
H2/N2. The use of H2 in N2 is to realize the role of oxygen 
species on absorbing H atoms. Current-transient responses 
were measured by mounting the resistive-type sensors on a 
test fixture and using a semiconductor parameter analyzer. 
Then the dynamic current at a constant voltage and hence the 
electric resistance change recorded every 5 s were obtained 
as sensing signals. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Fig. 2 shows the transient current response of the pure-Pd 
sensor to the introduction and removal of various hydrogen-
containing gases biased at 2 V. In a N2 ambience, a 
resistivity of 1.66105 cm was measured according to a 
thin-film thickness of 16 nm together with the zigzag-shaped 
dimension. When the pure-Pd thin film is exposed to a 
hydrogen-containing gas, hydrogen molecules are 
dissociated into hydrogen atoms, which are absorbed in the 
interstitial sites of the Pd lattice. The electric-resistance 
increment and hence the increase in resistivity can be 
attributed to carrier scattering due to the incorporated 
hydrogen atoms. On the contrary, by replacing the hydrogen-
containing gas with N2, desorption of hydrogen atoms gives 
rise to the reduction of the resistivity of the pure-Pd thin film. 
Then, the relative sensitivity (SH) is obtained according to 
experimental results shown in Fig. 2. It is found that SH are

7.4% and 6.1% for the pure-Pd sensor in 1.5% and 1% 
H2/N2, respectively. No clear correlation was found between 
the relative sensitivity and the thin-film thickness. However, 
as shown in Fig. 3, the response time (ta) as a function of 
thin-film thickness for a pure-Pd sensor subjected to 100 
ppm to 2% H2/N2, we find it is substantially dependent on 
the thin-film thickness. For example, ta with a thickness 
coefficient of 0.14 s/nm in 2% H2/N2 was obtained while it is 
0.5 s/nm in 1% H2/N2. Fig. 4 shows sensing characteristics of 
the Pd-SiO2 sensor. The baseline current in N2 is 436.2 A 
responding to a resistivity of 2.0310-5 cm. The high 
resistivity is due to incorporation of insulating SiO2. The 
current variation is more substantial when the gas with a 
higher hydrogen concentration is introduced to the Pd-SiO2 
sensor. This is because that the resistivity increased in the

sensing film is proportional to the H2 concentration in the 
sensing film. Since more hydrogen molecules coming to the 
sensing film can be dissociated into hydrogen atoms, more 
hydrogen atoms can diffuse into and locate inside the sensing 
film. It is thus easily demonstrated that the hydrogen 
concentration in the sensing film is enhanced by introducing 
hydrogen-containing gas with a high concentration. A typical 
response time of 12 s and SH  13.3% is obtained for the Pd-
SiO2 resistive-type hydrogen sensor in 2% H2/N2. We 
measured the high hydrogen concentrations 3% H2/N2. There 
is a better performance of SH   15.2% and ta  10 s. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Pd-based resistive-type hydrogen sensors were reported 
with new findings include at least that (i) response time is 
substantially dependent on the thin-film thickness and (ii) 
SiO2 incorporated into Pd thin film is useful for increasing 
sensitivity and shortening response time. However, studies of 
effects of the mole fraction of SiO2 incorporated into the Pd 
film on the sensor’s sensitivity and response time are 
undergoing to obtain low-cost and high-performance 
hydrogen sensors.
