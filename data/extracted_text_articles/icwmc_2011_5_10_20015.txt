Abstract— Inter-Carrier-Interference (ICI) is an effect that 
noticeably degrades the quality of the Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal. In this work, several 
proposed ICI cancellation schemes have been tested using open 
source Software Defined Radio (SDR) named GNU Radio. The 
GNU Radio system used in the experiment had one Universal 
Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) module connected to a 
computer. The USRP had two-daughterboard (RFX-400) for 
both transmission and reception of radio signals in the 400 
MHz band. The input data to the USRP was prepared in 
compliance with IEEE-802.11b specification. The experimental 
results were compared with the theoretical results of the 
proposed 
Inter-Carrier 
Interference 
(ICI) 
cancellation 
schemes. The comparison of the results revealed that the new 
schemes are suitable for high performance transmission. The 
results of this paper open up new opportunities of using 
OFDM in 400MHz band, where channels are heavily 
congested. The new ICI cancellation schemes can be used for 
Digital 
TV 
applications 
or 
for 
secured 
government 
communication services in the 400MHz to 500MHz band.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The OFDM is a technique, where a large number of 
orthogonal, overlapping subcarriers are transmitted in 
parallel, dividing the available transmission bandwidth into 
narrowband sub-channels [1, 2, 3]. The separations of the 
subcarriers are kept as minimal as possible to get a very 
compact spectral utilization. Due to the use of narrow 
bandwidth, each sub channel requires a longer symbol 
period. The orthogonality of the OFDM is lost when there 
are channel impairments and frequency mismatch in the 
transmitter and receiver. This leads to inter-carrier 
interference, phase rotation and performance degradation of 
the channel [4]. To reduce the effect of ICI, different 
cancellation schemes [5, 6] have been proposed and were 
tested in the GNU radio system. GNU radio is an open 
source software toolkit for building software radios by 
making use of software that defines the transmitted 
waveforms 
and 
demodulators 
instead 
of 
hardware 
components [7]. 
The paper is organized as follows: Section II illustrates the 
OFDM modulation and demodulation techniques; Section III 
describes different ICI cancellation schemes; Section IV 
explains the need of the experiment, Section V discusses the 
experimental setup; Section VI explains the binary data 
preparation; Section VII is about the unique modulation 
technique used; Section VIII explains software and hardware 
setup; Section IX describes the data retrieval process; 
Section X analyses the results; Section XI discusses the 
future scope of the technology and Section XII makes the 
concluding remarks. 
II. OFDM MODULATION & DEMODULATION 
OFDM is a technique as shown in Fig. 1, where the input 
data is converted to parallel bits and mapped according to 
predefined standard [9]. Inverse Fast Fourier Transform 
(IFFT) is a vital part to convert signal from frequency 
domain to time domain. After IFFT the parallel data is again 
converted to serial data. Cyclic prefix is also added before it 
gets converted from digital to analog data. The input data 
should be prepared maintaining specific standard. According 
to IEEE-802.11b specification [9], the data is transferred 
using 64 subcarriers. In the IFFT mapping, the total 64 
subcarriers in frequency domain are converted to time 
domain. In order to preserve the orthogonality of OFDM 
signal, preamble bits [9] are added. Also the cyclic prefix 
enables synchronization as the bits are used to detect the 
beginning and end of each frame and it appends the OFDM 
symbols one after another [9]. 
The received signal is demodulated according to the steps 
shown in Fig. 2, which is the opposite of OFDM modulation 
technique shown in Fig. 1.

III. ICI CANCELLATION SCHEMES 
Different cancellation schemes are used in order to reduce 
the 
effect 
of 
Inter-Carrier-Interference. 
Among 
the 
established models, self-cancellation and modified self-
cancellation techniques [11] are considered for the 
experiment. Also, two other new schemes have been 
developed and tested during the research [11]. 
A.  ICI self-cancellation 
In this scheme each data bit is sent through two adjacent 
sub-carriers, one with weight ‗+1‘ and another with ‗-1‘ [11].

In order to cancel the ICI at the receiver, adjacent sub-
carriers are subtracted, X(K)-(-X(K))=2X(K) [11]. This 
enhances the data value and reduces the noise level as given 
in equation (1). 
B.  ICI modified self-cancellation 
In this scheme each data is sent through two sub-carriers 
one with weight ‗+1‘ and another with ‗-1‘ [7]. The Kth and 
(N-1-K)th subcarriers are used.

Similar to ICI self-cancellation, the interfering components 
are removed by subtracting the Kth and (N-1-K)th sub-carriers 
in the receiving end as shown in equation (2). 
C.  New ICI cancellation scheme-1 
In this scheme each data is sent through four adjacent 
sub-carriers. The Kth and (K+3)th sub-carrier with weight 
‗+1‘ and (K+1)th and (K+2)th with weight ‗-1‘ [1].

To retrieve the data at receiving side, 1st and 4th sub-carriers 
are added and 2nd and 3rd sub-carriers are subtracted as 
stated in equation (3) [1], X(K)+X(K)-(-X(K))-(-X(K))=4X(K). 
So the original data values become prominent. 
D.  New ICI cancellation scheme–2 
In this scheme each data bit is sent through four adjacent 
sub-carriers, each with 90o phase shift [4]. This gives 
symmetry to the signal and greatly reduces the effect of the 
inter carrier interference.

In the receiving end, the 3rd and 4th are phase shifted by 90o 
and added to 1st and 2nd sub-carriers respectively. Then the 
results of 2nd and 4th phases are again shifted by 180o to get 
the original data as shown in equation (4). 
IV. THE NEED FOR THE EXPERIMENT 
In OFDM technique a large number of orthogonal 
subcarriers are transmitted in parallel dividing the available 
transmission bandwidth into narrowband sub-channels [1,2, 
3]. The separations of the subcarriers are kept as minimal as 
possible to get a very compact spectral utilization. The 
channel impairments and frequency mismatch in the 
transmitter and receiver, sometimes lead to inter-carrier 
interference (ICI) and phase rotation, resulting in 
performance degradation of the channel [4]. In order to 
reduce the effect of ICI, different cancellation schemes [5,6] 
have been proposed. These schemes help to reduce the 
effects of ICI by cancelling out the interference from carrier. 
As the data itself is used to cancel the interference, no extra 
encoding is needed for error correction. The results from 
hardware simulations give better insight about the real life 
problems than does software simulations. The GNU radio is 
a cost effective and flexible implementation platform that 
can be used to verify the functionalities as well as the 
performance of advanced models of wireless technologies in 
a real time setup. The advent of high speed processors with 
increased computational capability is making the software 
and hardware of GNU radio much closer to the antenna. 
One of the main advantages of SDR is that it is software 
reconfigurable, 
which 
leads 
to 
significant 
design 
simplification.

V. EXPERIMENT 
In the experiment, an input audio data was modulated 
using OFDM technique. The setup of the experiment is 
illustrated in Fig. 3 where initially a recorded audio voice 
signal was taken and it was imported into MATLAB where 
all the OFDM processing along with ICI cancellation 
encoding was performed and the resulting data was sent to a 
GNU Radio Companion (GRC) running computer. That 
computer was connected to a USRP transmitter. GNU Radio 
processed and transmitted the signal over the air. At the other 
end, an USRP receiver captured the signal, processed in 
GNU Radio and sent it back to MATLAB. The MATLAB 
demodulated and decoded the data and regenerated the sound 
and sent it to the speaker. 
 
VI. BINARY DATA PREPARATION 
The steps of preparing binary data in MATLAB are shown in 
the Fig. 4. In the experiment the input signal was a pre-
recorded audio voice signal as shown in Fig. 5. The duration 
of the audio signal was two seconds and it was sampled at 8 
kHz. The signal was compressed using the A-law 
companding technique [2] with A=80. The signal then 
quantized using pre-determined step size. In the experiment 
the step size was 512 in the range of -256 to 255. Then 256 
were added to all the quantized values to make it positive 
integer and the sample quantized. The quantized data then 
converted into binary string using MATLAB function. The 
system used 9 bits for each level. With total 512 levels 
ranges from 0 to 511. The produced data was binary strings. 
The strings were converted to individual number bits for the 
use of modulation. The numbers were then modulated either 
using Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) or Quadrature 
Phase Shift Keying (QPSK). In case of BPSK [9], the 
simplest form of digital modulation technique, the phase of a 
constant amplitude carrier signal is switched between two 
values of 1 and 0. The two phases are separated by 1800. 
Here all the 0‘s became -1 and 1‘s remained as 1. After the 
BPSK/QPSK modulation, each of the different ICI 
cancellation schemes (as discussed in section III) were 
implemented. 
VII. MODULATION 
Then OFDM modulation was performed according to 
IEEE-802.11b specification [9] as discussed in section II.

Figure 5.  Message signal 
Total 52 subcarriers were divided into two groups of 26 bits. 
A null value was added between the two groups. The 
subcarrier number 27 to 52 including the null value was 
placed in front of the signal. The eleven null bits or pilot bits 
were added, and the rest of the subcarriers were placed after 
the pilot bits [9]. This made 64 subcarrier long signals as 
shown in Fig. 6. Here each number denotes subcarrier 
number. 
In the IFFT mapping, the total 64 subcarriers in 
frequency domain were converted to time domain by IFFT. 
A 64-point IFFT was used in the experiment. The 
coefficients 1 to 26 were mapped to the same numbered 
IFFT inputs, while the coefficients –26 to –1 were copied 
into IFFT inputs 38 to 63. The rest of the inputs, 27 to 37 and 
the 0 (dc) input, were set to 0 or null as pilot bits [9]. The 
IFFT performs the process of transforming a spectrum 
(amplitude and phase of each component) into a time domain 
signal. An IFFT converts a number of complex data points of 
length that is a power of 2, into the time domain signal of the 
same number of points [9]. After IFFT the signal domain 
value of 64 subcarriers were placed, where the 49th and 64th 
subcarrier numbers are copied at the beginning of the signal 
as preamble as shown in Fig. 7 [9]. The addition of preamble 
bits allows the orthogonality of OFDM signals to be 
preserved. The total numbers of bits after a preamble 
addition was 80 bits. The addition of these bits enables 
synchronization as the bits were used to detect the beginning 
and end of each frame appending the OFDM symbols one 
after another. This was the 80 subcarrier long signal that was 
transferred. Fig. 8 was the signal that was transmitted. This 
signal was converted from complex to binary and was saved 
in a file to be exported to GNU Radio system. A special 
method was used to make binary conversion where the real 
and imaginary parts of the complex signals were separated

real and complex valued signal was mapped in a binary 
formatted file shown in Fig. 9. The GNU Radio can utilize 
the file as a source to transmit over the air. 
VIII. GNU RADIO AND HARDWARE SETUP 
GNU Radio is an open source software toolkit used for the 
experiment [7, 8]. In the GNU Radio Companion (GRC) 
software the file source block was used for feeding the 
binary file which was passed through a constant multiplier 
and was transferred to the USRP sink to transmit Over-the-
Air (OTA). Fig. 10 illustrates the implementation of the 
hardware parts of the GNU radio system. The binary file was 
transferred to the ―low cost‖ hardware called USRP and was 
passed onto the transmitter daughterboard which are RF 
frontends. The signal was received by a receiver 
daughterboard. Similarly, like the transmitter, the signal 
passed through the receiver USRP and this captured signal 
was saved in a binary file using the File Sink block [7]. The 
spectrum can be viewed using the FFT Sink block [7]. All 
the ICI OFDM BPSK/QPSK modulations were performed in 
MATLAB and the binary file was extracted from there.

DATA RETRIEVAL 
The received binary file was imported to MATLAB and the 
resulting received spectrum as shown in Fig. 11 was 
displayed. From the spectrum, densely congested ICI 
cancellation signal was noticed and also noise components 
were visible. Fig. 12 is the opposite of the data preparation as 
shown in Fig. 4. Here the received signal was saved to a 
binary file. From the binary file, the complex values were 
extracted, some representative samples are shown in Fig. 13. 
The 16 bits of cyclic prefix that was added was removed 
followed by FFT which converts the time domain signal into 
frequency domain.  The subcarrier bits have been extracted 
from this signal and the 12 pilot bits are removed. Step by 
step, the ICI cancellation schemes were performed followed 
by the BPSK/QPSK demodulation as shown in Fig. 12. The 
data was then converted to binary digits and A-law 
decompression was implemented and the audio voice signal 
was regenerated.

RESULT AND ANALYSIS 
Fig. 8 shows the transmitted spectrum of the OFDM BPSK 
signal which was generated in compliance to IEEE 
specification [9]. The spectrum has 80 sub-carriers according 
to the standard. There are 16 cyclic prefixes or preamble (8 
on each side). The middle portion contains the 64 IFFT data 
sub-carriers with 12 pilot bits. In total 52 data sub-carriers 
were embedded in frequency domain [9]. Fig. 11 shows the 
received spectrum of the same signal at the receiving end. 
The signal suffered attenuation and inter-carrier-interference 
(ICI) during transmission. From the figure the effect of 
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) noise can be 
clearly seen by looking at the cyclic prefixes. The visible 
figure can be said to have dominant noise components. The 
total power level also decreases significantly. There are 
many peaks and sudden drops in the spectrum which were 
not present in the original transmitted spectrum. The effects 
of ICI are also clearly visible from the figure as the adjacent 
carriers are almost overlapping. Fig. 14 is the original 
message signal, which is very nicely shaped and does not 
have any distortion pattern or sudden peaks or valleys. The 
received signal, however, is not fully free of noises. So, the 
reconstructed signal could not be retrieved as such from the 
received spectrum. Fig. 15 shows the reconstructed signal in 
time domain. The figure clearly displays the noises and ICI 
effects on the message. There are many drops across the 
message. However these problems can be resolved by using 
the new schemes. Fig. 16 shows received spectrum with ICI 
new scheme – 1 BPSK OFDM. From the figure it can be 
deduced that the spectrum has improved from the previous 
scheme. The regenerated signal also has low distortion. Fig. 
17 is the regenerated signal. 
In scheme-2, the performance improved a lot. Basically in 
the test, the scheme-2 was the most efficient signal. In that 
scheme the retrieved signal was almost same the original 
signal. From Fig. 18 the improvement in the dense sub-
carriers can be easily seen. The improvement is clearly 
visible in the cyclic prefix and also in the data sub carriers.

Figure 17.  Regenerated New scheme –1 signal 
 
Figure 18.  Received Spectrum of New Scheme – 2 
The sub carrier signals have retained their original shapes 
and power level. The signal has not been distorted severely 
due to AWGN noise and ICI as observed from the spectrum. 
The regenerated signal also shows the improvement as seen 
from Fig. 19. There are not many drops in the signal. The 
regenerated signal is almost 99% close to original signal. 
This improvement in the performance justifies the 
feasibility of the new schemes in OFDM to cancel the ICI 
and improve performance. The error percentages in new 
schemes are shown in Table 1 where the new scheme–2 gave 
the best CIR values. The performance improves because of 
the symmetrical transmission of the subcarriers. 
Though the new schemes improve the performance to a 
great extent, the bandwidth utilization has not been efficient. 
Normal OFDM uses full bandwidth of the channel whereas 
the self-cancellation schemes use only half of it. The new 
schemes are less efficient with the use of only quarter of the

Figure 20.  Performance comparison of schemes 
bandwidth as shown in Fig. 20. Theoretically, the data rate 
also decreases and new schemes has almost quarter the data 
rate than the normal OFDM. If the transmission gives more 
emphasis on performance and data rate is not a concern, the 
new schemes are better choice than the already established 
self-cancellation schemes. The New Schemes also require 
greater resources to process the cancellation on both 
transmitter and receiver. 
XI. FUTURE SCOPE 
The outcome of the research shows the feasibility of the 
implementation of OFDM in GNU Radio system, which 
provides a new field to explore. The project was used to 
verify the viability of the schemes that was considered for 
testing. Implementing the ICI cancellation scheme gives an 
opportunity to retrieve signals with better accuracy, so 
further test can be done using the GNU Radio involving ICI 
schemes. The availability of the hardware will enable the 
researchers to perform more practical implementation and 
hence to obtain more accurate results. 
This experiment was conducted in 400 MHz frequency 
band. Further investigation of the OFDM systems also can 
be done in 2.4 GHZ or 5GHz frequency bands in the future. 
The use of OFDM in newer technologies like LTE, WiMAX, 
Wi-Fi, Digital TV can be tested for practical feasibility in 
GNU Radio using the techniques used in this experiment. 
The research also opens up the opportunity to think and 
explore the options for 400 MHz frequency band similar to 
the initiatives taken in Australia [11]. The use of OFDM can 
help utilize the full capacity of this band to a greater extent. 
The new schemes can be tested in Digital TV services for 
getting the best possible clarity of the channel. 
XII. CONCLUSION 
The OFDM system, because of its robustness to multipath 
fading, has become popular in recent years. The project 
concentrated on testing the established schemes which were 
already developed and seemed to have improved the 
performance of the OFDM system. The schemes included 
ICI self-cancellation, and modified ICI self-cancellation. The 
two new schemes as mentioned in reference [10] were also 
tested in hardware radio transmission. The focus of this 
project was to check the viability of these schemes. The 
result shows significant improvements in new schemes. But 
the inefficient bandwidth utilization and low data rate restrict 
its use only in high performance systems. The digital HD 
TV, secured government communication network on 400 
MHz band, possibilities of data transfer through amateur 
radio band, emergency surveillance and rural telephone 
services [11] can utilize the effectiveness of the new schemes 
because in terms of performance the new schemes give far 
better performance than already established ICI cancellation 
techniques.
