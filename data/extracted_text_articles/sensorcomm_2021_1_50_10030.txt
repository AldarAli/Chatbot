Abstract‚Äî Icing at high altitudes is a major concern for energy 
sector and infrastructure development. Many icing models exist 
to predict and analyse icing conditions based on physical or 
analytical models. This paper presents a field study of 
meteorological icing events to estimate the Liquid Water 
Content (LWC) and droplets Median Volume Diameter (MVD), 
based on ice load from a single cylinder ice collector instead of 
using multi cylinder ice collector. In this study, ISO 12494 is 
used to analyse the data from a field ice monitoring station 
installed in Arctic region of northern Norway. This 
meteorological station consists of various icing sensors, weather 
sensor and web camera. Multiple icing events are recorded and 
analysed with a focus to estimate LWC and MVD using accreted 
ice mass from single cylinder ice collector. It is noted that 
accuracy for MVD and LWC estimation can be improved by 
using smaller time windows of icing events.

 INTRODUCTION 
Ice accretion poses significant challenges at high latitudes 
or in cold climatic regions around the world, affecting 
aviation, construction, and energy sectors. The ice accretion 
on aircraft can deteriorate its aerodynamic performance. 
Similarly, ice may accrete on suspension bridge structures that 
can pose a traffic safety risk resulting in long bridge closures 
[1]. Blade icing on wind turbines may incur Annual Energy 
Production loss of 2% ‚Äì 30%, change the blade aerodynamics, 
damage onboard controllers and cause safety risk to nearby 
population due to ice shedding [2] [3]. Similarly, ice accretion 
on power lines can result in the tower collapse. There‚Äôre 
multiple direct & indirect ways to detect icing on structure. 
Direct methods normally read on-site sensors or sense 
changes in different physical quantities (capacitance, 
vibrations, etc.), whereas indirect approaches make use of 
meteorological parameters such as temperature, dewpoint, etc. 
& apply different data analysis techniques to remotely 
evaluate ice presence. Extensive literature work is available 
on both ice detection methodologies [3]-[6]. This paper 
focuses on the indirect approach using ISO-12494 method for 
ice detection leading to the calculation of LWC and droplets‚Äô 
MVD. 
ISO-12494:(2001) formulates 
a 
standard 
for 
atmospheric ice modelling and field measurements. It 
suggests using a reference ice collector (0.5 m length, 30 mm 
diameter) of vertical (freely rotating) cylinder exposed to icing 
conditions (10 m.a.g.l.). 
Better knowledge about ice loads helps to improve the 
design and safety of structures in icing conditions. Different 
researchers have used ISO 12494 methodology to estimate ice 
loads on structures. H√§m√§l√§inen et al. [7] calculated icing 
related wind energy production losses by developing Finnish 
Icing Atlas after combining datasets of NWP and ice-growth 
model of ISO-12494. Sokolov et al. [8] used ISO-12494 to 
estimate Liquid Water Content (LWC) values in multicylinder 
assembly for dry ice monitoring to draw comparison of 
volume weighted averaging & spectrum averaging of 
droplets. Molkoselk√§ et al. [9] implemented ICEMET cloud 
droplet and imaging sensor in icing wind tunnel to determine 
LWC and droplets Median Volume Diameter (MVD) for 
mixed icing conditions using ISO-12494 standard for single 
rotating cylinder. Han [10] presented scaling method 
technique to determine LWC for glaze/rime ice from 
experimental ice thickness measured using 3D laser scanner. 
Rydblom et al. [11] introduced a cost-effective solution to 
measure MVD & LWC using Droplet Imaging Instrument 
(DII) for weather station in Sweden and validated its 
performance for Supercooled Liquid Droplets (SLD). 
This paper used a freely rotating single cylinder to model 
ice load on structure. For this purpose, a meteorological 
weather station was designed and installed in northern 
Norway at Linken Narvik mountain (1006 m.a.s.l.). The area 
is prone to icing events. The primary aim of using the 
meteorological and icing data on the reference collector is to 
employ the ISO 12494 standard to estimate the MVD and 
LWC values from the measured field meteorological data. The 
practical usage of the recovered values of MVD and LWC is 
that they can be used in the subsequent analysis for the 
purposes of icing load estimations, extreme value analysis and 
to build a ‚Äúcatalogue‚Äù of MVD/LWC values, which can be 
useful for the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) simulations 
in the local geographical conditions. While numerical 
modelling and laboratory experiments (using icing tunnel) are 
two other techniques to model/measure the extent of icing, 
field ice monitoring method used in this paper offers high 
accuracy but at the expense of cost and time. 
Section-II of this paper describes the analytical modelling 
theory for the calculation of  MVD & LWC in the light of ISO-
12494 standard. Section-III provides a description of installed 
weather station, followed by the obtained results for field ice 
monitoring in Section-IV. A brief conclusion is presented in 
Section-V.

ANALYTICAL MODEL 
Ice mass accumulation on the man-made onshore objects 
primarily comes from atmospheric icing, i.e., in-cloud or 
precipitation icing. For both the in-cloud icing and freezing 
rain/drizzle, the process of icing originates from the 
impingement of the supercooled water droplets onto the object 
in question. The main equation in the analytical modelling of 
22

icing, which describes the rate of icing per unit time is given 
as (ISO 12494, 2001): 
ùëëùëÄ
ùëëùë° = ùõº1ùõº2ùõº3ùë§ùê¥ùë£ 
In this equation, otherwise known as ‚ÄúMakkonen model‚Äù 
[12], A is the cross-sectional area of the object (with respect 
to the direction of the particle velocity vector, v; A = LD, 
where L is the length of the object in z-direction, and D is the 
characteristic length of the object, i.e., chord length, leading 
edge diameter, cylinder diameter, etc.), w is the liquid water 
content, Œ±1 is the collision efficiency, Œ±2 is the sticking 
efficiency, Œ±3 is the accretion efficiency. The correction 
factors Œ±1, Œ±2 and Œ±3 represent different processes that may 
reduce dM/dt from its maximum value wAv [the units of wAv 
term in the ISO 12494 standard are g/s (equivalent to the 
dimensions of dM/dt). The value of dM/dt = vAw is the 
theoretical maximum impingement rate]. These correction 
factors vary between 0 and 1. Factor Œ±1 represents the 
efficiency droplets collision, i.e., it is the ratio of the flux 
density (in this particular case it is the mass flux (flow) rate) 
of the droplets that hit the object, to the maximum flux 
density, which is a product of the mass concentration of the 
droplets, w, and the velocity, v, of the droplets with respect to 
the object. 
While under the ISO 12494 methodology, it is commonly 
assumed that for the supercooled water droplets, smaller in 
size than what can be classified as the Supercooled Large 
Droplets (SLD, with MVD (d) > 50 ¬µm), the sticking 
efficiency Œ±2 is always equal to 1, meaning all impinging 
droplets stick on impact, the same may not be true for the 
accretion efficiency Œ±3. Consequently, if the value of Œ±3 is 
reduced from 1, the ice growth can be classified as ‚Äúwet‚Äù, 
meaning that there is some loss of mass flux due to runback 
water and water droplets shedding, before they freeze. In this 
case the glaze ice will be formed. If the value of Œ±3 is equal to 
1, then all impinging droplet freeze on impact. While, in 
reality, the recorded icing events were a mix of wet and dry 
ice growth, the fundamental simplification has been made in 
this study that Œ±2 = Œ±3 = 1, i.e., all impinging droplets stick and 
freeze on impact. This is done in order to avoid the 
uncertainties, pertaining to the calculation of the iced surface 
thermodynamics, as the available measurement data may be 
insufficient for this purpose. Furthermore, since the 
Makkonen model equation described above has two 
unknowns (Œ±1 and w), and there is only one reference collector 
installed, the calculation procedure first starts with a ‚Äúguess‚Äù 
of LWC content. For the purposes of this study the range of w 
is 0.01 < w < 8 g/m3. The algorithm first starts with a 
prescribed LWC and then attempts to find such a MVD value, 
which produces ‚Äúoptimum‚Äù value of Œ±1 to minimize the error. 
The algorithm continues to sweep through the rest of LWC 
values till the ‚Äúoptimum‚Äù value is found for both Œ±1 and w, 
which minimizes the modelling error of measured accreted ice 
mass M. Figure 1 describes flowchart functionality for this 
method. 
 
Figure 1. Method used in this study to estimate LWC and MVD 
The overall collision efficiency Œ±1 is evaluated using the 
ISO 12494 formulae as: 
ùê∏ = ùê¥ ‚àí 0.028 ‚àí ùê∂(ùêµ ‚àí 0.0454) 
where constants A, B, and C are defined as: 
ùê¥ = 1.066ùêæ‚àí0.00616exp‚Å°(‚àí1.103ùêæ‚àí0.688) 
ùêµ = 3.641ùêæ‚àí0.498exp‚Å°(‚àí1.497ùêæ‚àí0.694) 
ùê∂ = 0.00637(ùúô ‚àí 100)0.381 
K and œï are the dimensionless droplet‚Äôs inertia and Langmuir 
parameter (sometimes also referred as impingement 
parameter), respectively and they are given as: 
K = 
2œÅprp
2u
9ŒºfC = 
œÅpdp
2u
18ŒºfC 
œï =ùëÖùëí2/ùêæ 
In which C is the characteristic length of the object, in case of 
cylinder C = R, where R is the cylinder radius. As it can be 
seen from the equations above, by manipulating the MVD 
value d the necessary change in the values of Œ±1 is achieved. 
III. 
FIELD ICE MONITORING STATION 
The field ice monitoring station used in this study, consists 
of a Campbell CR1000- data logger, which is interfaced with 
multiple meteorological sensors: wind speed/direction sensor 
(Lambrecht EOLOS), IR based ice detection sensor 
(HoloOptics T44) and ice load sensor (SAAB/Combitech). 
The ice load sensor consists of a freely rotating, heated single 
cylinder as per ISO-12494 standard. The setup also includes a 
web camera which was focused on the ice load sensor for 
verification of detected icing event. Data is recorded at the 
online server of Volue Instrument Technology AS via GSM 
module with a resolution interval of 1 minute for all sensors 
and 30 min for the web camera. Meteorological observations 
include average air temperature (‚ÑÉ), wind speed (m/s), wind 
direction (degrees), icing presence (0/1), ice mass (g), ice 
mass increment from previous value (g) and relative humidity 
(%RH). A brief description of these sensors is provided in 
Table-1. This filed icing station (Figure 2) was installed in 
Arctic region of northern Norway at Linken Narvik mountain 
(1006 m.a.s.l.).

Data collected from the weather station is sorted and 
analysed to detect meteorological icing events. Raw data for 
ice-mass (in kgm-1) as observed by ice load monitor is 
smoothed using local regression with weighted linear least 
squares and a 2nd degree polynomial model. 15 data-points are 
taken as a span for calculating the smoothed values while 
assigning lower weight to outliers. The smoothed ice mass 
values are treated for calculating LWC & MVD using the 
ISO-12494. Sticking efficiency (Œ±2) and freezing efficiency 
(Œ±3) are taken as 1 to simulate dry growth measurement of ice. 
Moreover, the increment of iced cylinder diameter is assumed 
to follow the following relationship: 
ùê∑ = ‚àö(4 √ó ùëö)
ùúãùúåùëñùëêùëí
+ ùê∑ùë¢ùëõùëñùëêùëíùëë

Here, ‚Äòm‚Äô represents ice-mass after applying smoothing filter, 
‚ÄòœÅice‚Äô is the ice density (the constant value of 700 kgm-3 has 
been chosen for this study as it is deemed to be a ‚Äúmiddle-
point‚Äù between the soft and the hard rime ice types and typical 
type of ice present in this region) and ‚ÄòDuniced‚Äô denotes original 
diameter of cylinder before experiencing icing (equal to 30 
mm). Since ISO-12494 method gives better results for high 
wind speeds, so only those data-points are evaluated where 
corresponding wind speed > 3ms-1. Similarly, ice shedding 
events are also neglected. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
From the recorded data sets from icing station, icing 
events are classified as long-term if they span more than 3 
hours, and short-term otherwise. For this purpose, the 
corresponding calculations for long-term icing events are 
made on 180 min interval, whereas short-term icing events are 
taken as whole. For analyzing the trend across different icing 
events, mean values of LWC, temperature, RH, ice mass are 
plotted against the icing event number. Visuals obtained from 
the camera are used to verify the detected icing events. 
 
1) Icing Events ‚Äì December 2020 
One short-term & two long-term icing events were 
identified on 10th Dec 2021. Figure 3 shows the raw data 
results from all sensors against time (Central European 
Summer Time; CEST) for specified icing events, whereas 
mean values for these parameters including MVD are plotted. 
The temperature during the first icing event increased with 
time from ‚Äì2.8 ‚ÑÉ to ‚Äì1.4 ‚ÑÉ and wind speed varied between 
0.6 ms-1 ‚Äì 6 ms-1. 
 
 
Figure 3. Meteorological data values for icing events detected on 10th 
December 2020 
LWC could only be calculated at few data points during 
this event, where wind speed was around 5ms-1 but greater 
than 3ms-1 & RH > 90%. This is due to the constraint of K < 
0.25 being reached for those points. Below this value the ISO 
12494 is no longer valid and thus this data is filtered out. 
During second icing event ice mass rate appears to be slower 
than first & third events. HoloOptics ice sensor showed ice 
presence during all icing events but turned off for a portion of 
time as it can‚Äôt detect icing thickness less than 0.01mm or 
when the probe surface is less than 25% covered with ice OR 
both. Two icing events are separated from each other in Figure 
3 as there was a gap of around 3 hours. However, their average 
values are shown in the same figure to draw comparison 
among parameters. Timeline images in Figure 4 show the

accreted ice on ice-load monitor depicting a gradual increase 
in iced cylinder diameter. These images also verified the icing 
events detected from the meteorological data.

2) Icing Events ‚Äì January 2021 
During the month of January 2021 a long icing event was 
observed starting from 14th Jan ,18:30hrs ‚Äì 17th Jan 00:30 hrs. 
For analysis purpose, this icing event is divided into 18 short 
icing events, each one with the duration of 180 min (Figure 6: 
right image). Figure 5 shows the datasets for atmospheric 
temperature, relative humidity, calculated LWC, etc. against 
time, in addition to mean values of these parameters 
(including MVD) for corresponding icing event. While 
considering the ice mass and temperature in Figure 5 which 
almost continuously increased till the last icing event, high 
values of LWC are achieved when %RH > 90% and wind 
speed is around 5 ms-1. It‚Äôs more evident on 11:15‚Äî20:00 
(15th Jan). The values of LWC in Figure 5 refer to ISO-12494 
equations where it has been conditioned with wind speed in 
acceptable range (> 3ms-1) and a positive change in ice mass; 
undefined LWC values against time fail either one or both the 
conditions. Infrared ice detection sensor remains turned on for 
whole duration defining it as a long meteorological icing 
event.

Examining the timeline images in Figure 7 shows rime ice 
appearance. A significant outer diameter change is observed 
for ice load monitor which allows to capture more striking 
droplets alongside an increase in %RH. Meanwhile taking ice-
mass graph (in Figures 5, 6) into consideration, ice mass curve 
depicts a nonlinear increase for ice mass accumulation till 
12:30 on 15th Jan after which the curve follows a linear fashion 
up till 17th Jan. %RH stayed above 90% for most of the time. 
Rest of the images show rime ice that apparently got hardened 
due to high wind speed and negative temperature on 15th Jan, 
possibly freezing the available captured water content.

3) Icing Events ‚Äì February 2021 
A long-term meteorological icing event spanning about 
18hrs is detected on 7th Feb. The event is subdivided into six 
small icing events, each one of 180min duration. Figure 8 
shows the plots of different meteorological parameters based 
on data collected from sensors. Temperature change of 
approx. 1.5‚ÑÉ is observed during daytime which then again 
decreased till night. Relative humidity stayed close to 90% 
most of the time however high wind speed is observed ranging 
from 1.6 ms-1 ‚Äì 12.8 ms-1. Cylinder endures a slight increase 
in diameter as rime accretes, as can be seen in timeline images 
in Figure 9.

B. Effect of Data Resolution 
Figure 3 showed ice accretion results on 10th Dec with 
180min timespan for events 2 & 3. To assess how MVD 
accuracy changes with resolution of time window, same icing 
events (07:31-13:30) are subdivided into smaller 90min icing 
events. Figure 10 presents the comparison of mean values of 
temp., %RH, LWC, etc. 
 
 
Figure 10. Comparison of mean values of icing parameters for a total icing 
duration of 6hrs (07:31-13:30) on 10th Dec. Left image displays results 
when icing duration is split into 2 icing events (comprised of 180min 
duration each), whereas right side image displays results when same 
duration is split into 4 small icing events (90min duration each). 
 
It can be observed that improved results can be obtained with 
high resolution (i.e., splitting into smaller duration of icing 
events). MVD values have changed from (12, 9.6) ¬µm to 
(10.8, 17.7, 20.9, 19) ¬µm; similar is the case with other 
parameters. Increasing the resolution for icing event means 
studying fewer no. of droplets impinging the cylinder surface 
in a stipulated time, which removes potential outliers in data 
and gives better results but at the expense of more 
computation time. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The paper presented an analytical method for ice 
modelling technique using field icing events data where a 
single cylinder assembly is used to estimate MVD and LWC. 
The method used in the study implemented ISO-12494 
standard cylinder (0.5m in height, 30mm diameter) by 
Combitech as an ice load monitor. Analysis show that LWC 
and MVD can also be estimated using single cylinder ice 
collector instead of just using the multicylinder ice collector 
assembly. Multiple icing events were recorded and analysed.  
During analysis longer icing events spanning several hours of 
continuous ice accretion are subdivided into smaller events 
(3hrs). It was noted that accuracy for MVD and LWC can be 
improved by using smaller time intervals instead of longer 
intervals of icing events. As a future work the results can be 
further furnished to compare the accuracy using multi-
cylinder network and assist the study of thermodynamics and 
heating phenomena in order to develop anti/deicing system. 
Due to high accuracy of field icing results, they can also be 
used to develop catalogues for Weather Research & 
Forecasting (WRF) simulations. Such measurements will 
provide a foundation for risk assessment during infrastructure 
development in Arctic region exhibiting similar climatic 
conditions.
