Abstract — Rapid proliferation of mobile technology and the 
Internet in Eastern-Europe for the past decade has had a 
significant impact on information distribution and has 
facilitated the introduction of novel e-Learning systems and 
technologies. The rapid growth and use of technology, as well as 
the ongoing transition towards a knowledge-based society of the 
workforce, has triggered in Romania the need and pressure to 
learn continuously. The paper provides an overview on e-
Learning developments in Eastern-Europe taking as case-study 
Romania. As part of the European Union (EU), Romanian’s 
education system is developed and evolves in the context of EU’s 
regulations. However, recent developments in the area of online 
learning in Eastern Europe, specifically the fast pace of 
development of these systems in Russia could have a strong 
impact on regional markets. A comparison with US 
developments in e-Learning is provided to emphasize common 
issues in the development and adoption of e-Learning systems.  
Keywords – e-Learning; Romania; Eastern Europe; Online 
Learning; Learning Management Systems. 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
E-Learning systems have been deployed in the US for 
several decades and currently more than one in four students 
take an online course according to a 2015 survey of online 
learning [1]. While in Eastern-Europe (EE), online programs 
are in their infancy, with the advent of high-speed Internet 
and mobile technology even in remote areas, the potential for 
rapid growth is tremendous.  
An important factor for the implementation of online 
programs in EE is the reduced cost associated with attending 
these programs, as well as the time flexibility provided to 
students and instructors. One can attend these courses from 
home without additional costs associated with travel, on a 
flexible schedule that allows keeping a full time job.  
Smarter/wider use of technology in teaching is generally 
seen as a promising way of controlling costs [2]. Higher 
education is being affected by the “cost disease” [3] since 
universities have high costs for infrastructure and labor, with 
reliance on expensive face-to-face provision. The urgent need 
to boost university productivity in US has been noted by 
many [4]-[6]. Likewise, productivity is a growing factor for 
e-Learning adoption in EE as well.  
This survey is structured as follows: in Section 2 an 
overview of e-Learning initiatives in Europe is provided, 
particularly highlighting some of the European Commission 
(EC) initiatives and some initiatives that fall outside EC 
jurisdiction. Since Russia is a major player in this field in EE, 
we provide a brief overview of systems employed there.  In 
Section 3 the current state of e-Learning initiatives in 
Romania are presented, focusing on the seeds of online 
learning in different areas – from K-12 to industry. Section 4 
illustrates the driving force behind e-Learning systems and 
investigates future trends. A parallel is drawn between e-
Learning implementation in EE and US since most “Dos and 
Don’ts” are invariable across continents and cultures. The 
Conclusion section summarizes the trends and requirements 
for a successful adoption of e-Learning in Romania. 
II. 
E-LEARNING IN EUROPE – WEST AND EAST 
The EC funds online collaborative platforms that bring 
education and training professionals together. These 
platforms allow education and training professionals to share 
ideas and experiences, learn new approaches or techniques 
from their peers and discuss important challenges faced by 
their colleagues around Europe. The digital single market -
digital economy and society [7] focuses on experimentation 
with such online platforms. 
The Electronic Platform for Adult Learning in Europe [8] 
is an example of the EC initiative for e-Learning. The 
platform is a multilingual open membership community for 
teachers, trainers, researchers, academics, policy makers and 
anyone else with a professional role in adult learning across 
Europe. It was launched in 2015 and is Europe's largest adult 
learning community. 
While EC has the funding to bring novel ideas to fruition, 
a large set of initiatives outside the EC domain have been 
taking shape in recent years. eTwinning [9] for example, is a 
platform for staff (teachers, head teachers and librarians), 
working in a school environment to communicate, 
collaborate, develop projects and share knowledge using 
online tools. eTwinning is now part of the Erasmus+ program 
[10] and, as of September 2016, there were approx. 40,000 
teachers, 
50,000+ 
projects 
and 
160,000+ 
schools 
participating in this e-Learning community. eTwinning 
impact on schools as measured through a survey in 2016 has

proven (by an 84% teachers vote) that the platform 
significantly facilitates and improves the relationship among 
teachers and students. Moreover, 77% of the teachers 
surveyed agree that eTwinning has had a moderate to high 
impact on fostering EU citizenship values in schools.  
The conclusions emerging from the eTwinning studies 
show that innovative schools promoting international 
collaboration and self-study among the teachers benefit the 
most from such an online system. eTwinning is now focusing 
on developing a full cycle of schools and on recruiting 
teachers for each school level [11].  
Another initiative that brings together the main players in 
the education system in EU: teachers, experts, policy makers, 
non-governmental associations, etc., is the School Education 
Gateway [12]. Sponsored through the Erasmus+ Program, it 
went live on February 2015 and is available in 23 languages. 
Shifting the analysis from Western to Eastern Europe, one 
notices Russia’s early efforts into upgrading the education 
system to cover the growing gap between rural and urban 
education. Russians have a long history of distance 
education; since 1920s the government Committee for the 
Advancement on Self-Education organized a nationwide 
correspondence education system to cope with the population 
spread over vast distances (e.g., since 1924 courses were 
taught in the area of agriculture, engineering, social sciences 
- through radio broadcasts for remote regions) [13]. Western 
e-Learning systems needed translation and some required 
software licensing posing a barrier in their adoption in 
Russia, hence, the need to develop in-house solutions. Russia 
is considered a leader in e-Learning systems development in 
EE with a yearly growth rate of approximatively 16% as 
illustrated in Fig. 1. 
 
  
 
Figure 1. E-Learning growth by region [14] 
 
The avant-garde of e-Learning systems in EE is led by the 
Russians through the use of software systems like Moodle, 
Khan Academy and Coursera. Moreover a partnership 
between Intel and the Volnoe Delo charitable foundation 
spawn in 2007 the program “Computers for Students”. The 
partnership aims at donating over 1 million laptops at the 
national level as well as setting up the “11e-learning” 
program for the K-4 schools in Russia. Of particular interest 
are the Massive Open On-line Courses promoted by the 
Moscow-based Digital October Technology Center [15] 
geared towards self-taught, self-paced learners.  
In addition to Russia, a number of EE countries are 
devoting significant efforts to grow and adopt e-Learning 
systems specifically in the mobile learning area. Countries 
like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Moldavia and Ukraine lead 
these efforts as illustrated in Fig. 2. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Mobile learning growth in the past 5 years [16] 
 
Russia, like the other EE countries faces many problems 
in course management systems deployment, including the 
need to localize content by translating it from English into the 
local language, a difficult adjustment of online courses to the 
country’s rigid universities’ curricula, as well as social 
acceptance of online learning as an alternative to traditional 
classrooms. 
III. 
E-LEARNING IN ROMANIA 
As a member of the European Union (EU), albeit part of 
the EE block, Romania is guided by decisions made at the EU 
level. In  this  context,  in  Romania,  within  the  general 
strategy of the EU’s Information and Communication 
Technologies,  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Research, 
has been trying to implement the online assessment, as well 
as the e-Lessons for various subjects. EU defines e-Learning 
as “the use of new multimedia technologies and the Internet 
to improve the quality of learning by facilitating access to 
resources and services, as well as remote exchanges and 
collaboration” [17]. 
The e-Learning concept was introduced in Romania 
approximatively two decades ago through the Virtual 
University paradigm, however, the first in-house Java based 
e-Learning software systems were surfacing in 1999 around 
major university centers [18]. 
Since then, the e-Learning concept has been more 
frequently used in Romania. Currently, all Romanian 
universities, as well as some governmental and non-
governmental organizations use e-Learning platforms with a 
slow but increasing frequency. The main goal of these 
platforms is to provide distance education for a growing 
workforce in the service sector, as well as to re-train 
Romanian workforce.  
The growth of the Romanian IT sector for the past decade 
has triggered the need for rapid education in a variety of 
technological areas. The great advantage of the sector is the

presence of a highly skilled workforce that has determined 
the development of software and services, with an amazing 
growth rate of approximately 40% since 2000 [19]. Using 
online courses for training eliminates the need to provide a 
full classroom setting for employees, greatly reducing the 
costs for establishing and maintaining an educational space 
for the Romanian workforce. Moreover, when the learner has 
control over when the material is being presented, they are 
better prepared to retain the information instead of feeling 
rushed or stressed. 
In Romania the older segment of the population has been 
experiencing the Digital Divide [20] and the rural segment 
the Urban-Rural Divide [21] due to the slow penetration of 
technology in the first years of the post-revolution era (i.e., 
1989). E-Learning technology can alleviate these gaps by 
allowing people of all ages and trades to learn new skills 
without the restrictions of a traditional classroom. Young and 
old alike can use online courses to learn a new skill, help 
improve their career or just to narrow the Digital Divide gap. 
While e-Learning implementation is still lagging behind 
in Romania, we identified a series of efforts in this direction. 
The e-Learning trend has not been uniformly adopted in the 
Romanian university system however, islands of initiatives 
can be found in other areas. The following sections present 
these initiatives classified based on their area of application.  
A. E-Learning in K-12  
There are roughly 80 virtual high schools [22] in 18 
different countries in Europe right now, with about 50% 
being private. Most K-12 initiatives have around 500 students 
and are targeted towards social inclusion for students outside 
the bounds of traditional schools. They represent a complete 
pedagogical spectrum from 100% online through to 
significant face-to-face interaction [23]. The schools tend to 
serve: the long-term sick, disabled students, young parents or 
pregnant young women, travelers, bullied or school-phobic, 
students with behavior problems, drop-outs, imprisoned 
youth or the geographically isolated. Other schools serve 
students with special language needs, expatriates or elite 
performers. 
One of the first e-Learning initiative in Romania [24] is 
targeted at secondary high school education and it is designed 
to prepare Romanian children who intend to continue their 
studies at an American University. 
A novel initiative in Romania along the trend set by the 
EU projects is the Romanian Teachers Online portal iTeach 
[25]. iTeach is a virtual online environment based on Web 2.0 
paradigms, facilitating the collaboration on didactic projects, 
socio-professional collaborations, learning and experience 
exchange, as well as familiarization with novel technology 
for e-Learning. Currently iTeach hosts seven online courses: 
two DigitalEdu courses – targeted towards teaching 
educators project based learning use in K-12 schools, as well 
as online tools for class interaction, an introduction to 
eTwinning and a module for international collaborations in 
which theoretical solution and their practical implementation 
is pursued. Other courses are targeted at collaboration quality 
assessment, teaching quality assessment, as well as a course 
on using digital systems and software tools in education.  
A research survey of new technologies in the teaching and 
learning process at both rural and urban schools conducted by 
the Center for Development and Innovation [26] shows that 
the frequency of using the e-Laboratories in the urban area 
(24.8%) is increased due to the large number of students, 
comparative to rural areas (19.5%), illustrated in Fig. 3. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Frequency of using the e-Laboratories 
 
The survey concludes with the need to expand 
development of e-Learning management systems in Romania 
at both rural and urban levels.  
B. E-Learning in Higher Education 
The slow deployment of e-Learning in Romanian 
universities is mainly due to the rigidity of the curriculum 
backed by the reluctance of the instructors, professors and 
academic leaders to support such systems for reasons similar 
to other countries (e.g., US), summarized as follows. 
Resistance to change – Change entails the development 
of new skills and requires leaders to become learners, 
generating for some uncomfortable situations. Studies show 
that in higher education institutes, only 10% to 15% of faculty 
is open to adopt e-learning tools and techniques. 
Approximately 70% – 80% constitutes the reluctant majority 
who has to be convinced that e-Learning rewards would 
benefit them also [27]. 
Short-sighted policies – Quality versus Costs – a 
simplistic view of e-Learning as a medium to increase 
enrollment 
and 
revenue 
is 
flawed. 
A 
successful 
implementation entails the right technology, reliability, 
security of student data, and ease of use for both faculty and 
students. 
Budgetary limitations – Money is a limited resource while 
technology is a field of moving targets, with many new 
products and services. Many pathways exist for the 
successful delivery of e-Learning, with selection and 
provision depending on factors, such as organization size, 
mission and priorities. Technology is as good as one’s ability 
to manage and exploit it. 
Unqualified decision makers – Administrators in charge 
often do not really have the background or knowledge of 
instructional design, compliance, intellectual property and 
experience to implement online courses. Such issues can be 
alleviated by selecting a qualified team of professionals with

relevant experience and by being prepared to understand and 
identify the e-Learning finest practice tools and services that 
would best differentiate the institution in the marketplace. 
An example of such an initiative is the Virtual University 
of Bucharest [28].  University of Bucharest, the second 
ranked University in Romania, has introduced e-Learning at 
the Economic Studies Academy and the National School of 
Administrative and Political Studies. The first online master 
program was attempted by the Faculty of Communication 
and Public Relations in 2004 [29]. A related effort is the 
Economic Studies Academy that deployed the first online 
Master program based on case studies form Harvard Business 
School. Subsets of online learning (e.g., blended learning) are 
also explored.  
The Polytechnic University of Bucharest has several 
ongoing e-Learning projects, some of them targeted at 
instructional design, others at developing new methodologies 
for teaching and most importantly projects devoted to 
experiential learning. 
With the rapid proliferation of networking technology in 
Romania, another initiative, the Center for Resources, 
Development, Information and Services, offers an online 
course dedicated to CISCO network specialization. 
There is a new trend for major Romanian Universities to 
provide online courses.  Timisoara Polytechnic for example, 
provides an online platform, UniCampus, offering a Mobile 
e-Commerce course and aiming at the development of the 
first Romanian Massive Open Online course. Such open and 
free systems resemble international initiatives like Coursera, 
EdX, FutureLean [30].  
A premiere for Eastern Europe, the Online Admission 
System recently deployed in Romania proposes online 
management of admission for Universities in Romania. So 
far five universities have joined the system: Romanian-
American University, Technical University for Building 
Management, Ovidius University of Constanta, Polytechnic 
University of Timisoara and Technical University ”Gheorghe 
Asachi” from Iasi. Similar platforms were implemented some 
time ago in Western countries, for example UCAS from 1996 
in Britain, Studielink in Holland and CommonApp in US. 
C. E-Learning in Industry 
Preferably, every company should have a strategy to set 
out career development paths and the required training 
curricula that will enable the personnel to develop the 
necessary knowledge and skills. These training initiatives 
should be monitored and managed through a consistent and 
reliable tracking system that can be stored, consulted and 
analyzed as required. The system’s data will be useful for 
management reports on productivity and for assessing 
individuals’ career advancement. This system of training 
management, referred to as a learning management system 
(LMS), is a key element of an effective professional 
development plan. 
The workforce training/re-training is a major issue in 
Romania and e-Learning platforms for these tasks are in their 
infancy. A survey of the Northern European countries shows 
that workers in North Europe are four times more willing to 
be taught by their employers than the workers in the South 
[31]. A recent survey in Romania [32] answered by a total of 
405 students, 904 graduates and 825 employers illustrates a 
positive view on e-Learning initiatives with the main priority 
on the increase in quality, the emphasis on practical aspects, 
and links with the realities of the economy and the labor 
market. 
An example of such an initiative is the Virtual Business 
University [33]. Its main goal is the advancement of 
online/distance learning aimed at filling in the workforce 
market needs. It offers online courses and advice for young 
entrepreneurs and it is providing theoretical and practical 
experience to its users. Students are required to attend these 
courses through comprehensive online interaction tools like 
discussion forums and chat channels. Upon completion they 
receive a certificate and the course credits can be used 
towards a graduate degree if the students decide to pursue a 
Master program in the area. The Virtual University has built 
partnerships with various marketing, communication and 
investment organizations (e.g., Finantate.ro, Markmedia.ro, 
Comunicare.ro and Comunicareonline.ro). 
A similar effort, Timsoft [34] has been focusing on e-
Learning for about four years and has offered over twenty 
online courses in IT, Counselling, Management, Marketing, 
and e-Training. Other Romanian software houses like Siveco 
[35] and Softwin have developed the AeL e-Learning system 
in an effort to facilitate the understanding of educational 
subjects and increase the efficiency of the learning process. 
AeL has a user friendly interface and can be easily translated 
in any language. 
Online Academy [36] is an e-Learning portal developed 
by InsideMedia with the help of experts from the Science and 
Education Institute and the Association for Excellence in 
Career. It offers a set of basic courses targeted to lifelong 
learning. The portal and courses’ modular structure facilitates 
active participation and collaboration among participants.  
D. E-Learning in GO and NGOs 
Governmental Organizations (GO) in Romania have 
shown significant interest in e-Learning technologies 
especially in the context of the e-Government initiatives (e.g., 
the use of information and communication technologies to 
improve the activities of the organizations in the public 
sector). Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in 
Romania have received in the past decade a significant 
amount of financial support through EU grants.  
The Foundation for the Development of the Civic Society 
[37] with the financial support of the Trust for Civil Society in 
Central and Eastern Europe deployed a few years ago an e-
Learning 
platform 
to: 
provide 
technical 
assistance, 
information, advertisement and research, to improve the 
impact of the NGOs in the community; present a 
comprehensive view of the NGO interests and involvement in 
other sectors of the society; improve the visibility and

transparency of the NGOs. The goal of the foundation is to 
enable through the use of e-Learning technologies a strong and 
influential civil society with responsible citizens that promote 
the community interests and values. 
The results of an assessment survey on the performance of 
the e-Government is illustrated in Fig. 4.

The e-Government implementation in Romania is 
beginning to show positive developments with 30% of the 
citizens using these services at present.  
IV. 
ALIGNING TO CURRENT AND FUTURE TRENDS 
There are many advantages in using an e-Learning system 
but the efficiency of such a system depends on many factors. 
Current and future trends are driven by several major aspects 
as highlighted in the following paragraphs. 
A. Continuous Education and Professional Development 
When people continue their education, they are growing, 
becoming more involved and curious, they develop skills that 
the modern job market requires, and they are cognizant and 
engaged in the world around them. Continuing education is 
essential in most areas and disciplines particularly in the 
technological sector. However, since technology is 
permeating in all areas and disciplines it triggers 
automatically the need for continuous learning. From job 
performance to promotion and advancement, continuous 
education is acknowledged as of upmost importance, as 
illustrated in Fig. 5. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Importance of continuing education [14] 
B. Adoption of Mobile Technology 
Mobile learning is a revolution in e-Learning. It is 
defined as “learning across multiple contexts, through social 
and content interactions, using personal electronic devices” 
[39]. From the perspective of learning technology, mobile 
delivery is the second most important priority for 
development in EU, as illustrated in Fig. 6. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Top 5 learning technology priorities [14] 
 
With the rapid and wide spread of handheld technology, 
currently there are more than 7 million smartphone users in 
Romania (i.e., one out of three Romanians is using a 
smartphone). It is estimated that by 2020 one out of two 
Romanians will use a smartphone [40]. Hence, the hardware 
required to deploy mobile learning applications is already 
available. 
C. The Cloud Effect 
Cloud-based learning management systems are hosted on 
the Internet and can be accessed by logging into a service 
provider's site. Rather than having to install course design and 
management software, instructional designers can simply use 
their Internet browsers to upload course content, create new 
courses, and communicate with learners directly. This is all 
done through a secure LMS, giving designers the ability to 
store information on the cloud, which can be remotely 
accessed by other, approved users. 
Major benefits of deploying an e-Learning platform on 
the Cloud include [41]:  
 
Lower startup costs - there is no software to purchase, no 
need to devote the time or human resources to installing 
programs and working out glitches; 
 
Enhanced data security – data is hosted on platforms that 
are better encrypted and safer to use; 
 
Improved accessibility – better accessibility for both 
learners and course designers. Learners are able to learn 
on-the-go, 
anywhere 
and 
anytime, 
instructional 
designers can utilize their tablets and any other internet-
ready device to upload content and communicate; 
 
Faster deployment – cloud-based eLearning is faster to 
set up and requires less time to actually deploy. There's 
no hardware of software involved, so one can have 
immediate access to the LMS; 
 
Cost 
predictability 
– 
cloud-based 
LMS 
offers 
administrators the ability to choose between plans based 
on registered users or plans based on activity;

 
Easier to maintain – cloud-based LMS service providers 
have IT staff on hand. One does not have to worry about 
dealing with glitches and other LMS operation issues; 
 
More storage space – all of the data will be uploaded 
directly to the LMS, releasing space on user devices. 
Other users, such as collaborators and content creators, 
will be able to share information with ease, given that it's 
being stored on a remote (and secure) server; 
 
Fully customizable and scalable - regardless of whether 
it is a smaller organization or a large corporation, cloud-
based LMS  offers the best of both worlds in the form of 
customizability and low cost. Owners can modify and 
scale their learning cloud-based LMS, providing the best 
learning experience for their users. 
V. 
COMPARISON WITH US,  BLENDED LEARNING  
The Gartner Group Research Institute in the United States 
anticipated that the world’s e-Learning sales would grow 
14.5% annually from 2006 to 2011 [1]. Campuses will still 
be active, however, technology will transform the way 
education is delivered and accessed, and the way value is 
created by higher education providers. A 4% growth for US 
is forecasted as related with 16% for Eastern Europe (Fig. 1).   
While in US more than 1 in 4 students take an online 
course, in EE we estimate the current ratio at about 1 in 30. 
However, when compared to Europe, similar issues plague 
the e-Learning system deployment. As mentioned in Section 
III.B, resistance to change, short-sighted policies, budgetary 
limitations and unqualified decision makers are universal 
problems in this area. However, another important factor is 
the maturity of the learner. Fully online programs are meant 
for those who live far from campus or may have jobs that 
prevent them from attending campus classes, but at the same 
time such programs require a mature learner that is self-
paced, responsible and motivated. To be successful in a fully 
online learning environment requires a strong sense of self-
directed learning. Of course many strategies exist to promote 
student engagement (e.g., enable students to monitor their 
own progress, help students set achievable goals in the 
course); however, often these strategies fail and sometimes 
are not correctly implemented due to the lack of expertise in 
instructional design. 
An alternative solution, especially useful for transitioning 
from a traditional course to an online course is Blended 
Learning [42]. The term Blended Learning is being used with 
increasing frequency in academic writing but there is no 
consensus on its meaning [43]. An alternative term, Hybrid, 
is defined as being of “mixed character; composed of 
different elements” [44], and Blended is defined as “an 
unobtrusive or harmonious part of a greater whole” [45]. 
Blended Learning has been described as a hybrid 
instructional approach combining aspects of e-Learning and 
a traditional classroom environment [46] and defined as 
courses that deliver material both face-to-face and online and 
where students interact with instructors both online and face-
to-face. Many colleges in US offer hybrid courses, which 
combine traditional face-to-face with online instruction. 
Previous research proves that this combination may promote 
learner-centered and active learning [47]. A similar trend is 
foreseen in Europe as well, specifically in Eastern Europe and 
particularly in Romania where e-Learning systems are still in 
their infancy.  
 As an example of this strategy the public University 
System of Georgia [48] defines the following: 
 Fully online: All or nearly all the class sessions are 
delivered via technology (96% to 100% online); 
 Partially online: Technology is used to deliver more than 
50% of class sessions (51% to 95% online); 
 Hybrid: Technology is used to deliver at least one class 
session up to 50% of class sessions; 
 Campus/on-site: No class sessions are replaced by online 
technology. 
Whether fully or partially online, the successful 
deployment of e-Learning systems in Romania will follow 
the regional trends and will be strongly influenced by the 
political decisions in the region. Young Romanian learners 
seem to be very flexible and motivated specifically in the 
technology sector. They know that e-Learning enables global 
learning, breaking the boundaries of local knowledge and 
they are eager to explore the possibilities.     
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
The paper provides an insight into e-Learning 
technologies and their evolution in Europe. The focus is set 
on Eastern Europe, particularly on the developments in 
Romania along several dimensions: e-Learning in high 
schools, higher education, government, as well as the private 
sector. Several important factors that influence the adoption 
and success of e-Learning systems are presented and should 
be considered by policymakers and educators. 
Spawning from the need for continuous education, e-
Learning generates advantages for both the young and the 
mature learner in Romania. Mobile and Cloud technology are 
fundamental factors for e-Learning growth and provide major 
benefits not only in terms of content storage and management 
but also in terms of content presentation and availability. 
U.S and East European e-Learning trends show common 
expectations from faculty, administrators and students, 
highlighting the need for a gradual and better managed 
introduction to online teaching. As a first step of this 
transition, a careful analysis along the main strengths, 
weaknesses, opportunities and threats of online teaching must 
be accomplished, and the subset of courses to be taught online 
must be identified.  Online teaching pedagogy courses must 
be subsequently offered to faculty and students, as well as 
training describing the features and the use of the LMS of 
choice. Ultimately a successful implementation of the e-
Learning paradigms depends on all the actors involved: 
administrators, faculty, students and policy makers.
