Abstract—Due to the broad range of options that wireless 
systems offer; Wi-Fi products are increasingly being used in 
agriculture environments to improve farming practices and 
better control the output of the production. However, the foliage 
has proven to harm radio-frequency propagation as well as 
decreasing the coverage area of Wireless Sensor Networks 
(WSNs). Therefore, near-ground channel characterization can 
help in avoiding high antennas and vegetation. Nevertheless, 
theoretical models tend to fail forecasting near-ground path 
losses. A comprehensive analysis of the influence of rural 
environments can help obtain better near-ground WSN 
performance and coverage in precision agriculture. Hence, this 
paper aims at determining how field components such as, soil, 
grass, and trunks affect radio-links in near-ground scenarios. To 
do this, we measure the Received Signal Strength (RSSI), the 
Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) and the Round-Trip Time 
(RTT) of a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) at different 
distances and compare the results with 6 prediction models: the 
Free-Space Propagation Model, the Two-Ray Ground Reflection 
Model, the One-Slope Log-Normal Model, the Two-Slope Log-
Normal Model, the Okumura-Hata Model, and the Walfisch-
Ikegami Model. The experiment was carried out by collecting 
experimental data at four different locations, i.e., an orange tree 
plantation with mature trees, an orange tree plantation with 
young trees, a persimmon field, and a field without vegetation, to 
compare and contrast the influence of field components on signal 
losses.

INTRODUCTION 
This paper is an extended version of the paper presented 
by M. Botella-Campos et al. in [1]. 
Smart Farming (SF) emphasizes the use of Information 
and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to leverage the farm 
management cycle. Improving the production capacity does 
not only enhance business efficiency. It also allows to increase 
production and reduce the environmental impact. Since the 
world population is expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050, 
human societies are facing the challenge of providing 
nourishment and livelihoods, while addressing the effects of 
climate change [2]. Smart farming applies measures that are 
ecologically meaningful and site-specific, focusing on 
implementing 
auto-piloted 
harvesters 
and 
other 
farm 
machinery [3]. 
The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing are 
expected 
to 
move 
forward 
in 
farming 
management 
development by introducing these technologies into machinery 
and production systems [4]. The gathered information will 
then be sent via different technologies such as, IEEE 802.11 
standards, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, 6LoWPAN, 3G, 4G, etc., 
depending on the amount of data to be transmitted [5]. 
Although IoT systems usually deal with small amounts of data 
to be transmitted through short distances, in some cases it 
could be required to send higher amounts of data and include 
images to monitor the status of the plants. The two main 
storage systems used to save the gathered information from 
the sensors are traditional databases or clouds. The most used 
databases are MySQL and SQL, while the ThingSpeak 
platform is the most used in cloud systems [5].  
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are needed to monitor 
environmental conditions and provide decision-making 
information and are composed of a group of spatially 
dispersed sensors to monitor and record environmental 
conditions such as, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, etc. 
WSNs are made up of four parts: a wireless sensor node, a 
gateway node, a wireless communication network, and a 
server [6]. Nowadays, sensor nodes have evolved to be small 
devices with sensing, communication, and computing devices. 
However, each node can only monitor a specific part of the 
field. Thus, the coverage area is a key problem since all nodes 
among a WSN must be autonomous to cooperatively pass data 
through the network to a main location. Moreover, its 
topology can vary enormously depending on the field. 
Many WSN applications generally use IEEE 802.11 g/n 
standard because it allows distances up to approximately 300 
meters in outdoor environments (when there is free space 
between devices) [7]. This allows a maximum raw data 
throughput of 54 Mbps or 600 Mbps, depending on the 
standard used. Likewise, the radio-frequency band can vary 
from 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz using Modulation Code Keying 
(CCK), Direct-sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) or 
Orthogonal 
Frequency-Division 
Multiplexing 
(OFDM) 
modulation schemes. Moreover, the use of this standard will 
reduce the cost of the deployment of the nodes as well as other 
time-consuming actions when processing the data. 
In 2019, Bacco et al. [8] conducted a survey on SF 
research activities to state the achieved results and current 
investigations within EU territory. In this study, challenges 
impeding the adoption of recent technologies and techniques

were highlighted. Although the current use of sensor nodes 
and analytic techniques is boosting Decision Support Systems 
(DSSs) in farms, the lack of diffusion programs is preventing 
areas affected by the digital divide from incorporating ICTs. 
Nevertheless, technology is expected to have an increasing 
role in agriculture so that operations, such as, planting and 
harvesting, may be automatized. Moreover, the availability of 
real-time data will allow finer control of pesticides and other 
chemicals. However, none of this will be possible without 
supporting policies to address poor telecommunication 
infrastructures and reduced digital skills. 
As for Precision Agriculture (PA), Lindblom et al. [9] 
conducted a review on agricultural DSSs within the frame of 
the ongoing Swedish project. This project intends to identify 
the scientific disciplines and other competences that need to 
work together in developing technology for agricultural DSS. 
Therefore, the discussion is focused on the importance of 
considering in-land processes to design suitable WSNs. 
However, the lack of active participation in agricultural 
research and development processes is preventing the 
development of new practices and behaviours for more 
sustainable farming. 
The effect of vegetation on radio-wave signals can be of 
great deal when designing such networks. Many studies have 
strived to evaluate and characterise land components that may 
affect signal strength. Still, the lack of experimental data has 
prevented scientists from developing generalized procedures 
to assess the foliage effect on attenuation. The International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommends a series of 
propagation models depending not only on frequency ranges 
but also different link geometries and vegetation types [10]. 
Nonetheless, relying on prediction models in near-ground 
scenarios may lead on over or underestimating the networking 
capacities of terrestrial systems. 
This paper aims to study near-ground wireless coverage in 
rural environments to ease multi-hop routing design. To this 
end, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), the Signal 
to Interference Ratio (SIR), and the Round-Trip Time (RTT) 
of a wireless signal were measured at two orange fields, a 
persimmon field, and a land with no vegetation. This study 
attempts to determine how near-ground radio-links are 
affected by field components such as, grass, soil, and trunks, 
and examine how accurate path loss estimation models are in 
this type of scenarios. In all cases, we used an access point and 
a laptop to take measurements at different distances, 30 cm 
above the ground at 2.437 GHz. 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II 
presents some related work. In Section III, several well-known 
propagation models are explained. The methodology and 
materials used in the experiment are presented in Section IV. 
In Section V, the experimental results are analysed. A 
comparison with previous works discussed in Section VI. 
Finally, the main conclusions and future work are exposed in 
Section VII.  
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Few technical works characterize near-ground radio-
frequency propagation. In this section, some of the related 
works are discussed. 
In [11], Torabi et al. proposed a near-ground prediction 
model to facilitate accurate WSN simulations using the 
principles of the Fresnel zones. In this study, the effects of 
antenna height, frequency, polarization, and electrical and 
geometrical properties of the terrain were studied. The 
accuracy of the proposed model was verified by comparing 
the theoretical results with near-ground measurements carried 
out in outdoor open areas at 300 MHz and 868 MHz. The 
results of this study showed that antenna height was by far the 
most 
influential 
parameter 
on 
network 
connectivity. 
Moreover, the wireless connection was proven to be sensitive 
to the reflection coefficient in near-ground situations. 
In 2014, Yildiz et al. [12] investigated the impact of path 
loss models on near-ground WSN lifetime. In this study, 
researchers performed a comparative analysis on the effects of 
path loss models and proposed a novel Mixed Integer Program 
(MIP) to maximize WSN lifetime. By designing an effective 
energy dissipation system, and using empirically validated 
characteristics of Mica2 motes, this investigation managed to 
characterize 
the 
parameter 
space 
through 
numerical 
evaluations of the MIP model at four different frequencies: 
315 MHz, 433MHz, and 868/916 MHz. The analysis of the 
results demonstrated that theoretical models, such as, the Free-
Space Model and the Two-Ray Model, can lead to 
overestimations on WSN lifetime and should be avoided in 
such scenarios. 
Tang et al. [13] studied a near-ground WSN at 470 MHz in 
four different scenarios to obtain the corresponding path loss 
models. To do this, measurements were taken on a flat 
concrete road, flat grass and two derived scenarios placing the 
transmitter directly on the ground. Three different antenna 
heights were used: 5 cm, 50 cm and, 1 m, and the RSSI was 
measured every meter at a distance up to 10 m, every 2 m at a 
distance of up to 20 m and every 5 meters at a distance of up 
to 50 m. The results showed that when antenna height is lower 
than 50 cm, prediction models tend to inaccurately forecast 
path loss and thus, network connectivity. 
Klaina et al. [14] performed a narrowband characterization 
of near-ground channels for WSNs at 5G-IoT bands. In this 
study, RSSI signal was measured at two different heights: 0.2 
and 0.4 m, to test the effects of ground coverings in path loss 
for three frequency ranges: 868 MHz, 2.4 GHz, and 5.8 GHz. 
To fit the signal strength decay caused by agriculture fields, an 
experimental 
measurement 
campaign 
was 
carried 
in 
agriculture fields with three types of ground: soil, short and 
tall grass. The path loss was estimated with a proposed 
narrowband radio channel model: the three-slope log-distance 
model. The analysis of the results demonstrated that the 
difference between the Free-Space model and the measured 
path loss is reduced with the increase in frequency. Moreover, 
lowering antenna heights increased attenuation. 
In 2017, Klaina et al. [15] presented a narrowband radio 
channel model operating under near-ground conditions. To do

this, a WSN based on ZigBee was designed to analyse the 
effects caused by soil and grass fields. In this case, radio 
communications were made at 868 MHz, 2.5 GHz, and 5.8 
GHz. In order to estimate signal quality, RSSI was measured 
and compared to path loss. Finally, they concluded that the 
ground has no effects on RF propagation except in the cases 
where antenna heights were 40 cm or less. However, signal 
levels decreased in the presence of grass fields and soil. 
Masadan et al. [16] studied the foliage effect in terms of 
attenuation and its contribution to the pathloss and link budget 
estimations. In this study, researchers quantified the path loss 
through 5 tree types in Malaysia for different path crossings 
(trunk, tree-top and branches) at 915 MHz. The analysis of the 
results showed that the RSSI values obtained in Line of Sight 
(LOS) scenarios were lower than expected due to tropical 
climate environment, as well as the size of the trees and 
density of the crowns. As for Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) 
scenarios, the obstructions caused diffractions, scattering of 
energy, and reflections that lead to larger attenuations. 
In [17], Wang et al. depicted a statistical model for near-
ground channels based on experimental data collected through 
three different scenarios at 2.4 GHz. The main objective of 
this study was to develop a WSN to collect data in military 
explosive research. To do this, sensor nodes with a 3 cm 
antenna height were fixed to the ground to resist damages 
from detonations. Different propagation models were applied 
to predict path loss and compare the results with the 
performance of the obtained model. The main conclusion of 
this research was that antenna height determines the 
breakpoint distance of the nodes. 
In 2011, Lloret et al. [18] presented a WSN that uses 
image processing to detect bad leaves in vineyards and sends 
an alarm to the farmer. In this case, wireless communications 
are made through IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n standard to allow long-
distance connections. Although the proposed system does not 
identify the cause of the deficiency, it detects bad leaves and 
notifies it to the farmer who can then decide what actions need 
to be taken. This solution provides a cost-effective sensor 
based on IP routers that have been adapted to fulfil this 
purpose. The designed WSN takes into account both sensing 
and radio coverage areas to allow low bandwidth consumption 
and higher scalability. The system to detect bad leaves goes 
through a 5-stage process before the node decides whether an 
alarm needs to be sent. 
In 2015, Szajna et al. [19] characterized path loss and near-
ground channels at 2.45 GHz on forested areas covered by 
snow. This study aimed to investigate the impact of antenna 
height and distance between nodes on path loss and special 
correlation. To do this, measurements were carried out in two 
different scenarios: a multi-purpose sports facility and a 
forested area covered by 15 cm of snow. In this case, antenna 
heights varied from 0 to 130.8 cm and the distance between 
the nodes varied in steps of 15.24 m and up to 79.2 m. The 
analysis of the results showed that reducing antenna heights 
increased path loss and reduced spatial correlation. 
Luciani et al. [20] described a study done on near-ground 
node 
range 
at 
different 
heights 
in 
Wi-Fi 
crowded 
environments. The designed WSN used IEEE 802.15.4 
standard to avoid direct Wi-Fi interference. Signal quality and 
range were determined by collecting RSSI data of three nodes 
at increasing node separation distance until signal loss. To 
perform the tests, measures were taken at three different 
heights: 15 cm, 30 cm, and 100 cm, at three different 
scenarios. The results of this experiment showed that 
prediction models failed to accurately forecast path loss. 
Moreover, ground-loss proved to be a major issue that 
determines node range and thus, must be taken into account 
when designing WSNs. 
Sangodoyin et al. [21] presented a near-ground channel 
model to achieve precision ranging and localization of 
ultrawideband (UWB) propagation channels. This experiment 
was performed using a self-built channel sounder with an 
arbitrary waveform generator and a high-bandwidth sampling 
oscilloscope. In this case, antenna heights ranged from 10 cm 
up to 2 m above ground to determine its effects on signal 
strength. The results showed that the distance-dependent path 
loss was highly dependent on antenna heights. Moreover, 
under near-ground situations, frequency-dependent path loss 
exponent and shadowing variance increased. 
Though many of these studies have attempted to 
characterize 
near-ground 
wireless 
systems 
in 
rural 
environments, the wide range of parameters to take into 
account, together with the randomness introduced by foliage 
and its different geometries in fields, have prevented 
researchers from stablishing a generalized procedure to assess 
the design and planning of WSN. 
For these reasons, in this work we present a site-specific 
study to guarantee the performance of near-ground radio-links 
in fruit plantations. To do this, measurements of RSSI, SIR, 
and RTT were collected at two orange tree plantations with 
different tree sizes, as well as a persimmon plantation and a 
land with no vegetation, to stablish the accuracy of six 
prediction 
models 
and 
test 
how 
distinct 
vegetation 
environments affect radio-links. 
III. 
PROPAGATION MODELS 
In this section, several propagation models are presented to 
predict the average signal strength drop and assess the level of 
accuracy that can be achieved in near-ground WSN scenarios. 
Thus, this section is divided into six different subsections. 
A. Free-Space Model  
The Free-space propagation model is the simplest way to 
calculate radio-signals propagation. From [12], we can extract 
the 
Free-Space 
propagation 
model 
based 
on 
Friis 
Transmission Formula. This equation is usually used when 
there are no obstacles in the LOS, and it is given by equation 
(1). 
           
       
 
(1) 
where: 
Pt: transmitter power, in watts.

Gt: transmitter antenna gain. 
Gr: receiver antenna gain. 
λ: wavelength. 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
However, it is possible to calculate the losses between a 
transmitter and a receiver in terms of the frequency with 
equation (2). 
                   
 
      
 
(2) 
where: 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
f: frequency in Hz. 
c: speed of light in the vacuum (meters per second). 
GT: transmitter antenna gain, in dBi. 
GR: receiver antenna gain, in dBi. 
B. Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model  
The Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model predicts path 
losses between a Tx and a Rx when they are both in line-of-
sight but have different antenna heights. This way, the 
received signal has two components: the line-of-sight 
component and the multipath component which is given by 
ground reflected waves. From [12], the given equation for the 
Two-Ray Model can be expressed by equation (3).  
 
         
  
   
 
  
 
(3) 
where: 
Pt: transmitter power, in watts. 
Gt: transmitter antenna gain. 
Gr: receiver antenna gain. 
ht: transmitter antenna height, in meters. 
hr: receiver antenna height, in meters. 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
Nevertheless, from the work in [13], we can tell that when 
radio-waves propagate near-ground in line-of-sight conditions, 
the path loss can be described by the plane-earth path loss 
formula, given by equation (4). 
                             
(4) 
where: 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
ht: transmitter antenna height, in meters. 
hr: receiver antenna height, in meters. 
C. One-Slope Log-Normal Model  
The log-distance path loss model is a statistical model that 
takes into consideration object blockage, environmental 
clutter, and other changes to predict path loss. From [12], the 
log-normal model can be described by equation (5). 
                
 
  
   
 
(5) 
where: 
PL (d): path loss at distance d, in dB. 
PL (d0): path loss, in dB, at reference distance of 1 meter 
(FSPL at 1 meter). 
n: path loss factor (n = 2). 
Xσ: zero mean Gaussian distributed variable with standard 
deviation σ. 
σ: linear regression of measured data. 
However, from reference [22] we can express One-Slope 
Log-Normal Model by equation (6). 
                     
 
    
(6) 
where: 
PL (d): path loss at distance d, in dB. 
FSPL (f, 1 m): free space path loss, in dB, at a reference 
distance of 1 meter. 
n: path loss factor (n = 2). 
d: distance, in meters, between transmitter and receiver. 
D. Two-Slope Log-Normal Model 
Although the Two-Slope Model is not often utilized in 
near-ground propagation scenarios, experimental studies on 
WSNs have shown that its use may result on better 
representations of the collected data [12]. From [20], this path 
loss estimation model can be expressed by equation (7). 
 
(7) 
where: 
PL (di): path loss at di distance (in meters), in dB. 
db: breakpoint distance, in meters. 
L0, Lb+1: path losses before and after the breakpoint, 
respectively. 
n1, n2: path loss factor (n = 2).

The breakpoint distance indicates a change rate of the path 
loss and can be calculated by equation (8) in LOS conditions 
[17]. 
 
(8) 
In this case, the estimated breakpoint distance for the given 
dataset was 8.64 meters. 
E. Okumura-Hata Model 
The Okumura-Hata path loss estimation model is an 
empirical formulation typically used for the frequency range 
of 150 MHz to 1500 MHz. However, this radio propagation 
model identifies the signal attenuation caused by reflections, 
diffractions, and the scattering of energy [16]. From [23], the 
Okumura-Hata path loss can be calculated by equation (9). 
 
 
(9) 
where: 
f: frequency, in MHz. 
hb, hm: Tx and Rx antenna heights in meters, respectively. 
d: distance between transceiver and receiver, in kilometres. 
The function a(hm) is dependent on the environment. In 
the case of rural areas, this correction factor corresponds to the 
same as in urban areas [23] and is described by equation (10). 
 
(10) 
As for the factor C, equation (11) formulates its value for 
rural areas [23]. 
 
(11) 
F. Walfisch-Ikegami Model 
This empirical model is considered to have a high accuracy 
in urban environments when the distance between the Tx and 
the Rx is relatively small [23-24]. In LOS scenarios, the 
Walfisch-Ikegami estimation model can be described by 
equation (12).  
 
(12) 
where: 
d: distance between Tx and Rx in the range of 20 m to 
5000 m, in kilometres. 
f: frequency in MHz (800-2000 MHz). 
Other studies have determined that, when antenna heights 
are lower than 50 cm, the One-Slope Model tends to estimate 
path losses better than other models [13]. However, other 
researchers state that the use of these theoretical models can 
lead to overestimations of the networking capacities and 
should be avoided [12]. In the following sections, we will 
compare these six models with collected data to evaluate their 
performance and verify their accuracy in near-ground 
scenarios. 
IV. SCENARIO DESCRIPTION AND TOOLS USED 
This section describes the devices used to perform the 
experiments, as well as the setup. Therefore, this section is 
segmented in four different subdivisions. 
A. Place of measurement 
In order to evaluate the path loss caused by vegetation in 
near-ground radio-wave signals, we sought out different 
plantations with no walls: an orange tree plantation of mature 
trees, an orange tree plantation of young trees, and a 
persimmon plantation of mature trees. Furthermore, we 
collected data at a land with no vegetation in order to compare 
and contrast the attenuation introduced by field components. 
B. Hardware used 
To perform this experiment, we used Linksys WRT320N-
EZ router as a Tx configured to work at 2.437 GHz (channel 
6) with IEEE 802.11 b/g/n standard [25]. This router has three 
internal antennas with 1.5 dBi of antenna gain and an RF 
power of 17 dBm. The Rx was ASUS Gaming Notebook 
GL753V, which has a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7-7700 HQ 
processor, 16 GB of memory. Wireless connections are made 
with Intel Dual Band Wireless Wifi Bluetooth Card 
7265NGW that uses the IEEE 802.11 ac standard and has two 
antennas of 5 dBi of gain. 
C. Software used 
The measurements were made using the software 
Vistumbler [26] to scan the wireless network and measure 
both the SIR and the RSSI. As for the latency of the 
connection, it was measured by sending a ping signal through 
MS-DOS commands to the gateway. 
D. Set-up of the experiment 
Both Tx and Rx were positioned along the same line, 30 
cm above the floor to measure the SIR and the RSSI. The 
evaluation of the path loss of RF signals was made by taking 
measurements in four different scenarios. 
• Scenario 1: Measurements were made on a field with no 
vegetation, collecting data every meter 30 cm above the 
ground. 
• Scenario 2: Measurements were made at an orange tree 
plantation with mature trees, with data being collected 
every meter 30 cm above the ground. 
• Scenario 3: Measurements were made at an orange tree 
plantation of young trees (3-year-old), with data being 
collected every 2 meters, 30 cm above the ground. 
• Scenario 4: Measurements were made at a persimmon 
plantation, with data being collected every 2.5 meters, 
30 cm above the ground.

Fig. 1 illustrates the set-up of the experiment and the 
vegetation geometry of Scenario 2. In order to be able to 
perform comparisons of the signal strength, measurements 
were made at the same distances in Scenario 1. Fig. 2 shows 
the set-up in Scenario 2. Fig. 3 exemplifies the geometry of 
Scenario 3 and the established set up. In Fig. 4 Scenario 3 is 
displayed. As it can be seen, the size of the trees is relatively 
small. As for Scenario 4, its geometry and set up are 
illustrated in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows the persimmon trees of 
Scenario 4. The noise floor in all cases was -80 dBm. 
Additionally, measurements were taken three times at each 
point. 
V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In this section, the accuracy of the chosen prediction 
models will be verified by comparing them to near-ground 
measurements. First, the measured data will be examined and 
then prediction models will be discussed and compared with 
collated data. 
Fig. 7 shows the RSSI levels measured in the chosen 
scenarios at 2.437 GHz. As the figure shows, the RSSI from 
Scenario 2 fluctuates much more than the one from Scenario 
1. This can be due to the random distribution of vegetation, as 
well as the presence of trunks. Moreover, the absorption of 
energy in Scenario 2 may be caused by the presence of grass. 
In the case of Scenario 3, the RSSI signal is quite stable up 
until 31 meters and does not reach levels lower than -80 dBm 
for the first 37 meters. This can be due to the cleanliness of 
this land as well as the low height of these trees. As this figure 
shows, the coverage area of Scenario 3 is larger than in 
Scenario 2. Finally, the signal levels of Scenario 4 are lower 
than in Scenario 2, which means that persimmon trees have a 
greater effect on the strength of the signal than mature orange 
trees. However, the RSSI signal does not exceed the 
established noise floor up until 23.5 meters, which is the same 
that happened in Scenario 2. 
Fig. 8 shows the SIR measured in all four scenarios. In this 
case, we can observe that mature orange trees from Scenario 2 
do not introduce interferences up until 15 meters. However, 
the collected SIR data shows that mature orange trees have 
little effect on the quality of the signal. In Scenario 3, the 
interferences appear after 11 meters and its SIR levels 
fluctuate much more than in Scenario 2 after 19 meters and 
surpass the 60% after 23.5 meters. This can be caused by the 
reflections on the ground, as well as the short height of the 
trees. As for Scenario 4, interferences appear after 6 meters. 
This may be due to the geometry of the land shown in Figure 
5. As the figure shows, the SIR levels rapidly drop. Though 
the signal levels do not fluctuate as much as in the rest of 
scenarios, its levels exceed 60% after 23.5 meters, which is 
the same that happened in Scenario 3, and errors may appear 
depending on the modulation used. 
Fig. 9 shows the RTT measured during the experiment. In 
this case, the time delays vary far more in Scenario 2 than in 
Scenario 1. In the case of Scenario 3, time delays are generally 
lower than in Scenario 2, although the measured RSSI in 
Scenario 3 is higher than in Scenario 2. As for Scenario 4, 
persimmon trees seem to have a greater effect on time delays 
even though RSSI levels are higher than in Scenario 3.

Figure 10f. Comparison of path loss models with collated data from Scenario 2 and Scenario 4.
Finally, we compared the selected prediction models by 
plotting them in Fig. 10a. In this figure, Two-Slope Model 
overlaps both Free-Space Model and One-Slope Model. 
Attending to the collected data curves from Fig. 7, the path 
loss is higher in all three scenarios with vegetation than in 
Scenario 1, which proves that vegetation does in fact introduce 
attenuations on wireless signal. As Fig. 10a shows, the 
Okumura-Hata Model failed to predict the attenuation 
correctly and will be taken out from the graphs for a more 
fluent reading.  
Fig. 10b shows the collected data from Scenario 1 and 
Scenario 2, together with the selected prediction models. In 
this case, the Walfisch-Ikegami prediction model is the only 
path loss model that accurately predicts attenuation for 
Scenario 1. Furthermore, the collected data from Scenario 1 
shows a greater path loss than one the predicted by the Free-
Space Model and the Log-Normal Shadowing Models. 
In Fig. 10c, the collected data from Scenario 1 and 
Scenario 3 were plotted, as well as the beforementioned 
prediction models. However, none of the selected models 
succeeded foreseeing attenuation for Scenario 3. In this case, 
the plotted data of this scenario shows a higher attenuation 
than Walfisch-Ikegami Model, but lower than the path loss 
predicted by the Two-Ray Model. 
In Fig. 10d, the collected data from Scenario 1 and 
Scenario 4 was plotted together with prediction models. As for 
the previous case, none of the selected path loss models 
managed to predict attenuation correctly. Persimmon trees 
seem to introduce much more losses than what prediction 
models estimated. 
Fig. 10e illustrates the collected data from Scenario 2 and 
Scenario 3 along with the propagation models. When 
comparing the trendline of the path losses from both scenarios, 
one can clearly see that young orange trees introduce higher 
attenuations on the radio-wave signal than mature orange 
trees. The reason for this is that, although young orange trees 
have lighter foliage, the treetop is in line with both the Tx and 
the Rx. As for the previous cases, none of the selected 
propagation models managed to forecast path losses, which 
highlights the need of finding ways to predict attenuation. 
Finally, Fig. 10f shows the collected data from Scenario 2 
and Scenario 4 together with the selected prediction models. 
Although none of the selected prediction models managed to 
predict attenuation, it can be highlighted that the attenuation 
introduced by persimmon trees is much higher than the one 
introduced by mature orange trees. 
VI. COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS WORKS 
In this section, we will discuss previous studies that have 
attempted 
to 
characterize 
near-ground 
wireless 
communications in rural environments in order to establish 
how frequency ranges and different testbeds may influence the 
results. 
A comparative of similar studies is presented in TABLE I. 
The research in [11] demonstrated that wireless connections 
were fairly sensitive to the reflection coefficient in near-
ground situations, achieving 101 dB of attenuation in over 14 
meters. Moreover, the study performed in [12] verified that 
theoretical propagation models fail to characterize near-
ground wireless communications. In this case, path loss 
reached 102 dB of attenuation in a radio network of 175 m. In 
[13], a near-ground WSN with a transmitter placed directly on 
the ground was presented, showing that prediction models fail 
to accurately forecast path loss when antenna heights are 
lower than 50 cm, although in this case, path loss surpassed 
100 dB after almost 200 meters. Furthermore, the studies 
carried in [14-15] to design a WSN based on ZigBee under 
near-ground conditions showed that grass fields and soil affect 
signal strength, but still reached 120 meters of distance to the 
access point with good coverage. In [16], Okumura-Hata, 
104
International Journal on Advances in Networks and Services, vol 13 no 3 & 4, year 2020, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/
2020, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org

Log-Normal Shadowing and foliage models were used as a 
reference to test their performance when comparing the 
predicted attenuation in tropical environments. However, none 
of these models managed to accurately predict path loss in 
tropical environments, which demonstrates the importance of 
characterizing foliage attenuation in different environments. In 
this case, path loss exceeded 100 dB after 13 meters. The 
statistical model described in [17] demonstrated that antenna 
height determines coverage area and that propagation models 
fail to accurately forecast path loss. However, path loss only 
surpassed 100 dB after 100 m. In [18], the presented solution 
did manage to detect bad leaves. However, in this case, 
vegetation loss was not introduced into the power balance 
formula and no information was given about the amount of 
attenuation. The study performed in [19] concluded that 
reducing antenna heights increased path loss, though this 
investigation was carried out in forested areas covered by 
snow where attenuation reached 96 dB after almost 40 m. 
Moreover, the study depicted in [20] demonstrated that 
ground-loss is a major issue when determining node range. 
Nevertheless, this experiment was performed in Wi-Fi 
crowded environments and after 30 m attenuation reached 100 
dBm. The experiment performed in [21] to characterize near-
ground UWB propagation channels showed that the node 
range is highly dependent on antenna heights and only reached 
75 dB after 200 meters. 
As it can be seen on TABLE I, our work expands the 
knowledge on this area by including the most common 
prediction models used in near-ground scenarios, and other 
propagation models that identify reflections, diffractions, and 
scattering. Furthermore, we attempted at testing these 
prediction models by measuring at different heights than the 
ones employed in other existing works.

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we attempted to determine how near-ground 
radio-waves are affected by field components such as, grass, 
soil, and trunks. To this end, we performed an experiment at 
four different scenarios: a land with no vegetation, an orange 
tree plantation with mature trees, an orange tree plantation 
with young trees, and a persimmon field, where measurements 
were taken 30 cm above the ground. 
In this case study, we analysed the signal quality by 
measuring the RSSI, the SIR and the RTT of a wireless signal 
and compared the collated data with six different path loss 
prediction models. The results showed that, in near-ground 
scenarios, the RSSI tends to fluctuate much more in the 
presence of vegetation. In other terms, the geometry of the 
trees and the presence of grass produce a scattering of energy 
and a higher number of reflections and refractions. However, 
the interference was only noticeable at the persimmon field, 
where noise was introduced from 6 meters. As for the selected 
prediction models, Walfisch-Ikegami Model managed to 
accurately predict attenuation for Scenario 1. However, none 
of the presented path loss models managed to accurately 
forecast path loss for Scenario 3 and Scenario 4, and 
Okamura-Hata Model failed capturing the effect of vegetation. 
As future work, we would like to include in the 
experimental test different types of plantations and agriculture 
environments, such as, vineyards [18]. Moreover, it would be 
interesting to test other propagation models to verify their 
accuracy in near-ground scenarios. Another important point 
for future researches would be introducing simulation models 
to effectively design and plan wireless networks in near-
ground scenarios with vegetation. Additionally, it could be 
interesting to perform these practical experiments with other 
technologies such as, LoRa [27], Zigbee and Sigfox which are 
currently being used in farming activities and compare them 
with the results of IEEE 802.11 standard.
