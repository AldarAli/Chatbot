Abstract—This paper presents a state-of-the-art of recent
research work analyzing the requirements of Industry 4.0,
particularly related to the competences issue. Over the last few
years,
the
fourth
industrial
revolution
has
attracted
researchers worldwide to find suitable solutions. However,
there are still
many
gaps related to the Industry
4.0,
particularly related to the humans competences issue. Among
the many challenges facing companies in this paradigm, one of
the most important is the qualification of employees with the
necessary skills to succeed in a transformed work environment.
To cope with knowledge and competence challenges related to
new technologies and processes of Industry 4.0, new strategic
approaches for holistic human resource management are
needed in manufacturing companies. The main objective of the
presented research is to investigate the importance of employee
competences, key to the development of Industry 4.0.
Keywords-Human Competences; Skills; Industry 4.0; human
resource management; Fourth Industrial revolution.

INTRODUCTION
In industrial companies that are subject to constant
competitive pressure [4], changes are coming faster and are
more unpredictable [5]. This has considerable consequences
on their investments and their competitiveness, which are
highly dependent on knowledge, skills, competences and
creativity of its workforce. Today, we are on the cusp of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution [35], or Industry 4.0, expected
to deeply change the future manufacturing and production
processes, and which leads to smart factories and networked
industrial environments that will benefit from its main design
principles. The adoption of new technologies and production
processes undoubtedly implies more qualified workforce.
Thus, the biggest challenge for industrials would be to adapt
their workforce to be able to follow the current revolution.
Fig.1 [8] provides a global view of enabling technologies for
Industry 4.0 and the organizational requirements in terms of
technical
and
management
problems
for
successful
implementation. In recent years researchers have been very
interested in Industry 4.0 and have published a large number
of works in this field. Some works focused on the challenges
that companies face in qualifying employees with the
necessary skills, while others emphasize new learning
approaches to adapting Engineering Education to Industry
4.0 Vision,
Certain researchers are particularly interested in specific
modules to integrate them into teaching programs and adapt
Figure 1. Overview of Industry 4.0
them to Industry 4.0. By contrast, other articles are also
focused on the transformation of education itself according
to the needs of Industry 4.0. Finally, a sequence of works
demonstrates
new
concepts
of
learning
factories
and
responds to
the growing
demand of future skills of
production staff and laboratories to allow students to
discover production environments type 4.0.
In Section 2, we will discuss the challenges and new
technologies facing business workers in Industry 4.0. Section
3 presents the required competencies in Industry 4.0. Section
4 finds the challenges facing the new technologies to respond
to Industry 4.0 requirements. Section 5 illustrates the role of
training in the formation of Industry 4.0 skills. Section 6
explains the requirement of skills approach and finally,
Section 7 concludes the paper.

THE ISSUES AND CHALLENGES RELATED TO SKILLS
FACE INDUSTRY 4.0
In
a
globalized
world
with
highly
interconnected
processes, companies are faced with an increasing number of
challenges to be met [1], especially in terms of adapting their
skills to the automation and digitalization in progress. In this
context, research work of great importance and surveys have
been carried out in search of solutions to face the challenges
of Industry 4.0. [29] presents a case study of an Estonian ICT
company, Proekspert, where the authors define the necessary
skills in the context of Industry 4.0 to explore how workers
can be included in the future planning process. It is based on
the creation of a prototype instrument to map the perceived
skills gap. It will help to inform the design and development
of a unified platform for defining and planning the skills
around which a fruitful dialogue of all stakeholders can take

place. In [8], a job that meets one of the challenges of
Industry 4.0 which is the qualification of future employees
with the skills necessary to act and work in the transformed
work environment. To meet this challenge and to have a
successful implementation of new Industry 4.0 systems in
organizations,
the
authors
combine
three
approaches:
sociotechnical
system
theory;
competence-based
view;
competence models of the Evolute approach, with a revision
and update of the latter.
Often technical skills help people to succeed in an
interview, but they need general skills to keep a job and
achieve professional development. The authors of [26],
describe a methodology, centered on a mapping of the skills
and personal qualities necessary to assess the specificity
required
by the
industrial environment
4.0, after
the
application of a complex psychological evaluation system
Abcd-M
based
on
a
psycho-lexical
approach
system
compatible with the Big Five personality traits (OCEAN
model) on successive series of students from Politechnica
University in Bucharest. A map of the capacities necessary
for the assessment and selection of human resources able to
work in the environment of Industry 4.0 was conceived.
Continuing on this path, and towards developing ethical
leaders, in a survey [31], young workers indicate that the top
four skills employers need to ensure long-term success are
interpersonal skills, confidence/motivation, ethics/integrity
and critical thinking. In [30], qualitative information is
provided from an ongoing collaborative research project
involving
a
variety
of
manufacturing
stakeholders
in
Northern Italy, to meet the challenges of changing technical
skills in the context of Industry 4.0. The results help to shed
light on manufacturing skills needs related to Industry 4.0, to
prepare the ground for future research on the subject.
The authors of [10] have chosen to help SMEs to cope
with the Industry 4.0 trend and prosper in the future, to
provide it with technological support that can help them plan,
direct and monitor the transition process, as well as develop
their employees. This fact belongs to the objective of the
Adaption project. In this article, the authors describe the
work in progress, in particular on the tool using the newly
created models of progress and maturity, but also on the
associated skills development approach. A huge effort is now
required in manufacturing companies in order to constantly
update the skills of workers. In this context, the question of
the evaluation of the training provided to workers is
increasingly critical, since increasingly complex data must be
collected in real time and correctly analyzed in order to
define the skill level of workers and to introduce in case the
necessary corrective actions.
[27] aims to present a training data evaluation tool based
on the integration of a training evaluation ontology with a
training analysis model to define the skill levels of workers.
[3] presents an initial competence model and describe the
dimensions of knowledge and skills necessary to Industry
4.0. This model can be used to create individuals for the
training proposal or to assess the knowledge gaps existing in
a company. The skills identified are classified as technical,
behavioral and contextual. To define the educational needs,
the authors propose to use six different dimensions namely
technology, industrial sector, software life cycles, transversal
skills, skills and job profiles. By combining factors of these
dimensions, it should be able to provide a skill set at the
individual or enterprise level.
III
INVESTIGATION TO UNVEIL THE REQUIRED SKILLS BY
INDUSTRY 4.0
Predictions
of
future
skill
requirements
in
the
manufacturing
sector
vary
widely,
depending
on
occupational requirements across sectors, regional variations
and
the degree of digitization [33]. Based
on these
requirements, surveys are carried out to find out the skills
necessary for Industry 4.0. [30] is a research based on a
qualitative
methodology,
aimed
to
achieve
a
double
objective. On one hand, it identifies the latest manufacturing
needs in terms of Industry 4.0 skills. On the other hand, it is
an attempt to anticipate the needs of businesses in the near
future. The results of this research also help to provide
business, government and education with new perspectives
relevant to the identification of the needs for recycling,
improvement and development of future industrial human
capital. Despite the limits of this study, it advances research
and practice by providing a precise set of technical skills
related to Industry 4.0.
Another survey was carried out on a group of companies
selected randomly [32]. In order to diagnose the willingness
of Polish companies to implement the concept of Industry
4.0, a questionnaire-based study focusing on individual
employee skills, the authors adopted their approach that
employee skills are one of the main challenges for the
development of Industry 4.0. Based on the results of the
German research conducted on the key skills of employees
for the development of the concept of Industry 4.0, the most
important skills, respondents indicated problem solving
(69.84%) and personal responsibility for decision making
(65.08%). The authors draw as a result that the essential
general skills of employees in a modern enterprise will be
mainly focused on understanding the problems and concepts
of other disciplines and on openness to change and novelty,
they argued that communication skills that are also cross-
cultural, often with the use of virtual tools, will be more
important. The authority of Engineer 4.0 will still rest mainly
on solid technical knowledge, but the importance of general
skills will continue to grow. The lack of importance of these
skills is interpreted by researchers as a lack of willingness on
the part of Polish employees to develop a new era.
[6] describes the results of a research carried out by its
authors at the Polytechnic University of Peter the Great Saint
Petersburg with the main aim of determining the status of
use
of
digital
technologies
and
advanced
means
of
communication by students during their studies and their
25

preparation to work for the future digital industry. According
to the research results, 30 to 35% of trainees do not actively
use the latest means and communication skills of information
technology. To address this challenge, it was proposed a
number of measures reasonable to implement, additional
training of university professors in the field of IT, as well as
the development of more mobile applications, practical to
use by students during their studies.
[9] makes a contribution to two important challenges
currently affecting the industry and the companies: the
definition of skills and the development of a skill model for
Industry 4.0, the study focuses on three areas: Information
System, Computer Science and Engineering which require
academic training and will play a crucial role in the Industry
4.0, where the authors propose a skills model for the
professions and develop a curriculum with content that can
be applied in these areas of education. A skills-based
program was developed, following a structured didactic
approach, for this purpose, the SHL skill framework was
used, therefore, 69 assessed skills were extracted. [17]
considers that the main asset of the Industry 4.0 framework
is the staff. The authors would like to determine what skills
and expertise are necessary for young engineers to be ready
for the framework of Industry 4.0. A questionnaire was
developed at the level of three Italian universities, Brescia,
Udine and Cassino, to analyze this situation. The questions
aimed to investigate certain key problems of Industry 4.0, as
well as the digital beliefs and behaviors of students when
they entered the system university education. Answering a
fundamental question: "Are our engineering students and
educators effectively ready for the Industry 4.0 framework?".
The results of the survey suggest the need to create a broader
and better structured knowledge of the basic concepts linked
to this new industrial revolution. Then, this knowledge
should be improved and integrated, taking into account the
revision of the educational content of the courses, in
particular with regard to technical subjects.
For the same reason, in [25], data were collected from 85
manufacturing companies in the cross-border cooperative
region of Lubuskie / Poland and Brandenburg / Germany.
Respondents were managers and general managers. They
were asked to rate the characteristics of employees in terms
of the most important for Industry 4.0. They stated that they
had sufficient knowledge of the assumptions of the idea for
Industry 4.0. In this article, the authors are confronted to
challenges from industry 4.1 which are the evaluation of the
qualitative factors in the basic skills for Industry 4.0 in
manufacturing companies, and the selection of employees
with the appropriate skills to undertake business projects.
The proposed approach, presenting the weighting of basic
skills, makes it possible to assess a potential employee in
manufacturing companies.
IV.
NEW TECHNOLOGIES FACING THE CHALLENGES OF
INDUSTRY 4.0
With the advent of Industry 4.0 and its components:
Cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, big data and
cloud computing, robotics, systems based on artificial
intelligence and additive manufacturing [26], companies will
not only have difficulties in implementing new technologies,
but some other challenges related to the adaptation of these
technologies to have a highly qualified workforce. As
Industry 4.0 takes shape, human operators experience greater
complexity in their daily tasks: they must be very flexible
and demonstrate adaptability in a very dynamic work
environment. [12] emphasized the need for tools and
approaches that could be easily integrated into daily practice
and capable of combining complex methodologies with high
usage requirements. For this reason, the authors offer a
multi-layered
modular
solution,
Sophos-MS,
based
on
augmented reality content and an intelligent personal digital
assistant with voice interaction capabilities. After deploying
the approach and studying its potential through field
experiments, the results of the experimental campaign were
first checked to ensure their statistical relevance, then
evaluated analytically to show that the proposed solution has
a real impact on operators' learning curves and can make the
difference between who uses it and who does not.
In [19], the authors present the aspects and limits of
Virtual Reality (VR) technology to help VR developers
create VR industrial environments that produce reliable /
achievable simulations of the behavior of machines and real
processes and stable operation of real processes afar.
Industry 4.0 relies on virtual reality in order to reduce design
and production costs, maintain product quality and overcome
several
technical
compromises
such
as
reducing
the
complexity of rendering while keeping rates high refresh
rates or increasing resolution while providing a stable VR
experience. [28] provides a first shared vision on how
Augmented Reality (AR) can tackle four different challenges
related to handling complexity in a Cyber-Physical Systems
(CPS) environment: develop intelligent assistance systems
for learning and performance assessment at the workplace,
adapt job profiles accordingly, and address also the issue of
work-life balance. The provision of such a technology will
help to improve employability in a sustainable way by
providing access to better paid jobs. It will also have a
positive effect on well-being, enabling more people to keep
their jobs
through
up-skilling,
while
job
performance
requirements increase.
V.
THE COURSE TOWARDS ADAPTING HUMAN SKILLS
TO INDUSTRY 4.0
The 4th revolution aims to push the industry to mutate
towards connected factories where humans and machines
collaborate
throughout
the
production
process.
The
digitization of the industry requires the rehabilitation of the
infrastructure and the invention of new methods and
26

processes. For these reasons, the industry makes call
university teaching and researches to help them to adapt and
qualify their workers according to the needs of Industry 4.0.
The rise of new digital industrial technologies and the
diffusion of the Industry 4.0 framework have also led
academia to be interested in possible changes that could
involve the academic education of young people in general
and, the learning of technical and engineering topics in
particular [17]. An important part of the tasks of preparation
for Industry 4.0 is the adaptation of higher education to the
requirements of this vision, in particular the training of
engineer, for which, [13] introduce a roadmap made up of
three pillars describing the changes / improvements to be
made in the areas of curriculum development, laboratory
concept and student club activities. In order to bring about
changes in behavior, attitudes and knowledge, a circular
four-step experiential learning cycle model developed by
Kolb is used. This model is selected as the most appropriate
learning theory to adapt engineering education to the vision
of Industry 4.0. Preliminary results from this implementation
of this framework at the Turkish German University showed
that it was possible to apply such framework and the
underlying theory adopted from Kolb to adapt engineering
education to the vision of Industry 4.0. [23] presents a
concept on the development of an information system in
order to formalize the reflections of the experts via business
scenarios by input-output model and to verify the influence
of
sectors
with
high
labor
intensity-work
on
related
professions and skills. The dynamic collection of input-
output and labor market data via the internet is new to the
system, where it provides an opportunity to test future
scenarios on the effects of technological change on the labor
market and determines the sets of skills for analysis. It helps
to rethink the skill sets provided by training programs in the
light of business scenarios derived from the business climate
of Industry 4.0. The educational process has experienced
difficulties in reaching national standards of competence in
specific teaching tools and the best way to solve this problem
is to compare different approaches, to study all the factors
and to find the best practical tool in education, like in [21]
where a questionnaire-based survey was conducted at the
level of the Korean University of Technology and Education
with the aim of carrying out a comparative study of two
university courses of engineering to present the difference
between the effect of education based on virtual reality (VR)
and traditional education on learning robotics. An expert
method, interviews with focus groups and a comparative
study are used by the authors to achieve this objective. The
authors studied the impact of different teaching methods on
the development of students' skills. They also analyzed the
effect of VR training in the classroom and found that there is
a significant impact of the report CQI (Channel Quality
Indication) on the performance of the teacher's teaching
system. [22] is a part of the Erasmus + project "Approach to
training in the workplace in the field of Industry 4.0 for a
competitive European industry" - iNduce 4.0, it presents a
state-of-the-art analysis of the knowledge and skill gaps on
Industry 4.0 and the workplace learning requirements
(WBL), using a large-scale survey of 6 European countries.
The researchers defined the key points concerning the
development of the iNduce 4.0 training course and the
iNduce 4.0 practical methodology for the WBL. It provides
awareness of the subject Industry 4.0, the training modules
developed, the necessary skills and the proportion of theory
and practice. [15] focuses on the facilitation of mobile
learning processes in technical vocational education and
engineering as well as its integration in learning about
employment
scenarios
in
Industry
4.0.
The
need
of
mLearning
(mobile
learning)
applications
that
support
learning in the real work process was motivated by two areas
of application: laboratory courses, Industry 4.0 where in the
latter, learning processes can be triggered by data cyber-
physical systems of work processes. This allows mobile
training on work scenarios. The author proposed the use of
competence extracts instead of complete documents easily
accessible via QRCodes, NFC or process data.
VI.
SKILLS APPROACH
All these challenges require continuous innovation and
learning, which is dependent on people and enterprise's
capabilities. Appropriate management approaches can play a
vital role in the development of dynamic capabilities, and
effective learning and innovation climate. [2] stresses the
important role of a learning factory (LeanLab) to improve
university
education,
company
training
and
practical
research in the fields of industrial engineering and logistics.
The authors present the current state of LeanLab and
illustrate the next concrete steps towards an Industry 4.0
learning factory. [11] describes the design of a learning
factory for Industry 4.0 that meets the growing demand for
future skills of production personnel. But it focuses on soft
skills such as decision making, group work and performance
monitoring. [7] presented a learning model based on serious
games, thought for industrial production plants, as a viable
alternative for the development of professional skills. [14]
presents a structured integrated vision of computer-aided
applications (CAx) and Product Lifecycle Management
(PLM) tools and their learning, for this purpose the author to
propose Learning by project (PDB) as an approach to
provide
a
learning
experience
that
facilitates
the
development of skills and competences of Industry 4.0. It
uses the Fusion 360 applications from Autodesk and
DExperience
from
Dassault
Systems,
which
have
functionalities
adapted
to
the
implementation
of
collaborative learning based on a project. To enable future
executives and workers of a factory to meet the challenges of
an increasingly digitalized production system, other skills
must also be addressed according to future production
scenarios in the sense of Industry 4.0. [16] makes the abstract
vision of Industry 4.0 more tangible using a Learning
Factory
approach
in
combination
with
scenario-based
learning. The TU Wien Industry 4.0 pilot plant served as the
27

eKNOW 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on Information, Process, and Knowledge Management

basic infrastructure for the implementation of this concept. In
order to supervise all the skills required, the authors have
developed a preliminary skills catalog in which they have
distinguished skills according to the skills framework of
Rosenstiel and Erpenbeck and according to the typical roles
in production. They are based on the RAMI4.0 architecture
model, to create a "problem skills cube" serving as a
reference for the targeted development of problem-specific
skills and educational formats. This theoretical approach is
intended to be a first step towards a more tangible vision of
Industry 4.0 in collaboration with the pilot plant of Industry
4.0.
[18] presents a generative method led by a model used to
adapt and reuse a set of learning components for the delivery
of a skills development program concerned with a given
learning objective and which serves a specific educational
context,
t
describes
a
generative
(IE)
Instructional
Engineering
method
used
to
create
and
adapt
Competence Development Programs (CDPs). Such
adaptations can be made at the time of conception or
at the time of learning, which complicates the task of
educational design. The generative framework of the work
consists
of
a
functionality
model,
a
set
of
learning
components and a transformational approach based on the
meta-model to eventually generate the learning artifact.
Another learning space presented in [20], the makerspace, a
type of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(STEM) creation space, where students must combine skills
and
knowledge
in
the
fields
of
science,
technology,
engineering and mathematics to create, build and review a
product, the Maker space in is different from project-based
learning because these products do not necessarily have to
take the form of projects such as tools, prototypes or designs.
The model developed was called Heat STEM Makerspace
and from analysis and discussion, the authors concluded that
the Heat STEM creation space could be used to stimulate
creative thinking, critical thinking and problem solving. The
design model could guide the teacher to help students
explore their best STEM potential. Students also learn better
because the model develops not only their 21st century skills,
but also their STEM literacy in physics so that the model can
promote higher order thinking skills. In industries, workers
may use different types of machinery or have to perform
manual tasks that require a specific sequence of actions. In
both cases, they may be faced with unexpected events, which
require great expertise, for these reasons.
[24] presents a concept of gamification suitable for
application in Industry 4.0 environments in the context of
knowledge sharing, thanks to this platform, workers can raise
discussions on certain problems, such as solutions to
execution
failures
of
automation
systems,
publish
multimedia content related to training on certain procedures
or cases of solution errors and also answer questions from
other colleagues. Other learning and knowledge-sharing
environments are cited in [29]: IntelLEO, an ICT research
project was initiated with the aim of developing intelligent
technologies that support Learning and Knowledge-Building
(LKB)
activities
in
Intelligent
Learning
Extended
Organization (IntelLEO). An example of real lifelong
learning
that
prepares
for
a
career
and
not
a
job,
eDidaktikum environment initially intended only for teacher
training in order to facilitate the exchange and collection of
didactic information within universities and between them.
To achieve this, the main aspects are the systematization of
information, cooperation and social learning, as well as
personal development and evaluation.
VII.
CONCLUSION
The
industrial
revolution
represents
an
issue
of
competitiveness for all industrial companies. Their objective
is
to
overturn
paradigms
and
make
industry
more
communicative and more interactive in order to simplify all
operations. Whether in terms of training, maintenance or
production, using new technologies must be thought out in
conjunction with other aspects of competitiveness, and in
particular the rise in skills of human capital to all levels of
the company. In this article, we have presented some
research work which presented the human skills necessary to
face Industry 4.0. This aspect is often displayed as a central
concern by public policies, but few are the concrete devices
to have emerged. Admittedly, many uncertainties about the
development of the industry make it difficult to accurately
anticipate
skill
needs.
Howeevr,
effective
support
for
employees affected by the changes will be the key to the
successful transition to the industry of the future.
