Abstract—Clinically, electroencephalography (EEG) is the 
most common tool used to diagnose epilepsy. However, if 
considering practicality and convenience, electrocardiogram 
(ECG) is more suitable for use in non-medical institutions. Its 
problem that needs to be overcome is the improvement of 
accuracy. Therefore, this study attempted to apply transfer 
learning strategy to develop a seizure prediction system based 
on ECG for detecting interictal and preictal periods. We 
trained a nonpatient specific epilepsy prediction model based 
on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and then used 
transfer learning to fine-tune parameters with the goal of 
reducing the model development time and improving the 
performance for each specific patient. ECG data were obtained 
from two open-source datasets, the Siena Scalp EEG database 
and Zenodo, including 13 and 14 patients, respectively. The 
results show that the patient-specific model with six frozen 
layers achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 100% 
for nine patients and required only 40 s of training time. By 
applying transfer learning, the model could directly use raw 
ECG signals, eliminating the time and manpower in extraction 
of features and greatly speeding up the training process. 
Furthermore, it achieved the purpose of personalized and 
accurate detection that could increase the practicality of 
seizure prediction in daily life.

 INTRODUCTION 
According to statistics report of the World Health 
Organization, epilepsy is one of the most common 
neurological diseases in the world, with about 50 million 
patients worldwide. It refers to the occasional, excessive, 
and disorderly discharge of brain neurons, resulting in limb 
movement disorders and perception, language, or other 
cognitive dysfunctions. Clinically, electroencephalography 
(EEG) is the most common tool used to diagnose epilepsy. 
However, its measurement environment is limited, and the 
operation requires the assistance of professionals. Besides, 
the interpretation of complex signals requires extensive 
work as well. Therefore, many researchers have used 
machine learning or deep learning technology to build an 
automatic epilepsy detection system (e.g., [7]). The 
recognition accuracies of those EEG models for epileptic 
seizures detection could reach more than 90%. However, if 
such signals were to be collected using a wearable device at 
home, various factors would have to be considered, 
including easy operation by a nonprofessional, and user 
comfort. Hence, some researchers have begun to investigate 
the potential of using other physiological signals, such as 
electrocardiogram (ECG), as an alternative (e.g., [6]). 
Because epileptic seizures often affect the autonomic 
nervous system, leading to effects on cardiovascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary functions during or 
shortly after seizures, cardiovascular changes are gaining 
attention because of their ability to cause sudden unexpected 
death in epilepsy [8]. That means excessive neural 
activation associated with seizures affects central autonomic 
network 
function, 
regulates 
parasympathetic 
and 
sympathetic heart rhythm and contractility, and thereby 
reflects in heart rate and ECG waveforms [9][10]. Although 
they concluded that ECG is quite feasible in practice for at 
home monitoring, effectively improving the low accuracy of 
this method would be challenging. Therefore, this study 
attempted to apply transfer learning strategy to develop a 
seizure prediction system based on ECG for detecting 
interictal and preictal periods. We trained a nonpatient 
specific epilepsy prediction model based on Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN), and then used transfer learning to 
fine tune parameters with the goal of reducing the model 
development time and improving the results for each 
specific patient. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
provides the classification method for CNN model. Section 
3 describes the performance of the model and the 
comparison results of the different models. Section 4 
includes conclusion and future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The followings describe the datasets, the analysis 
methodology and the evaluation metrics used in our study. 
A. Datasets 
ECG data were downloaded from two data sets: the Siena 
Scalp EEG database (including 13 patients; mean ± standard 
deviation age 42.6 ± 13.8 years) [3][5] and Zenodo 
(including 14 patients; mean ± standard deviation age 17.4 ± 
9.6 years) [1]. For each patient, the diagnosis of epilepsy and 
classification were made by a doctor. All patients provided 
written informed consent approved by the Ethics Committee 
of the University of Siena. 
B. Data Analysis 
ECG signals were preprocessed using MATLAB in three 
steps: detrending, 80Hz lowpass filtering and 60Hz notch

filtering. After preprocessing, the signals were truncated by 
using 10s overlapping windows with 8 s of overlap and 
divided into four epileptic states: seizure, preictal 20–10, 
preictal 30–20, and preictal 40–30. A total of 12,222 samples 
were obtained for each state (Figure 1). 
C. Classification and Performance Evaluation 
The CNN model was modified from the model of Wang 
et al. [7] and implemented using Python. It comprised four 
convolutional layers, five pooling layers, and three FC layers 
(Figure 2). Three approaches were used for training: 
recordwise (i.e., mixed datasets), subjectwise (i.e., cross 
dataset) and patient-specific (i.e., transfer learning). For all 
approaches, 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the 
trained models. The optimized model was then validated on 
the testing dataset by calculating its accuracy, specificity, 
and sensitivity. These processes were performed five times. 
III. 
RESULTS 
Effectiveness of the three training approaches for 
establishing a CNN-based epilepsy prediction model was 
investigated. The results for recordwise training revealed that 
the performance for classifying interictal and three preictal 
states were all greater than 97%; the training times for all 
three models were approximately 2 h (Table I). The results 
for subjectwise training revealed that the performance for 
classifying interictal and three preictal states were greater 
than 78%; the training times were approximately 2 h. A 
comparison of the results for recordwise and subjectwise 
training revealed that if the novel subject data were not used 
for model training, the test accuracy, sensitivity, and 
specificity decreased but the training time remained constant. 
Finally, the results for patient-specific transfer learning 
differed from those for recordwise and subjectwise training 
(Table II). The models with 12 frozen layers and used to 
classify interictal and three preictal states achieved 
performance of greater than 94% with training times of 
approximately 1 min. Models with nine and six frozen layers 
classifying interictal and three preictal states achieved 
performance of 100% with training times of approximately 
40 s and 45 s, respectively. Those with three frozen layers 
achieved performance of 97% with training times of 
approximately 50 s. In summary, freezing 9 layers led to the 
highest accuracy (i.e., 100%) and the shortest training time 
(~40 seconds), which further indicated that transfer learning 
was superior to recordwise or subjectwise learning. 
We then compared the accuracy rates of our model with 
those of models reported by other studies on epileptic seizure 
prediction using ECG data (Table III). De Cooman et al. [11] 
proposed a support vector machine with transfer learning 
approach for seizure detection using single lead ECG data 
from 24 temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Their personalized 
approach resulted in an overall sensitivity of 71% with an 
average decrease in false detection rate of 37%. 
Baghersalimi et al. [12] designed a standard federated 
learning framework in the context of epileptic seizure 
detection using a deep learning-based approach, which 
operates across a cluster of machines. They evaluated the 
accuracy on the EPILEPSIAE database consisting of one-
lead ECG from 29 patients. Their framework achieved a 
sensitivity of 81.25%, a specificity of 82.00%, and a 
geometric mean of 81.62%. The comparison result shows 
that ours had the best accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
EEG is currently the main tool used to diagnose epileptic 
seizures. Many studies have utilized deep learning 
technology for prediction of epileptic seizures (e.g., [2]); 
however, if considering practicality and convenience, ECG is 
more suitable for use in nonmedical institutions, while the 
problem that needs to be overcome is the improvement of 
accuracy [4]. Therefore, this study used three different 
training methods to evaluate ECG-based classification 
models. Recordwise training was used to test the architecture 
of our model. The performance could reach more than 97%. 
Subjectwise training was used to simulate practical situations, 
i.e., the test data are independent and unrelated to the 
training data. The performance was over 78%. Due to the 
sharp drop in model performance, we applied transfer 
learning approach to develop a patient-specific model. The 
results show that the training effect of freezing 6 layers was 
the best: the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity for 9 
subjects all reached 100%, and the training time was less 
than 40 seconds. By applying transfer learning, the model 
could directly use raw ECG signals, eliminating the time and 
manpower in extraction of features and greatly speeding up 
the training process. Furthermore, it achieved the purpose of 
personalized and accurate detection that could increase the 
practicality of seizure prediction in daily life. For future 
practical applications, such as wearable devices employed 
for seizure prediction, studies on more or larger datasets 
should be conducted to validate the reliability of the model.
