Abstract—The research presented in this paper focusses on a
new methodology for knowledge based mapping of objects and
entities for creating new multi-dimensional context. The mapping
to new context can improve complex knowledge mining, discovery,
and decision making results. The new context increases the
potential for creating new insights. The paper introduces the
new methodology used with advanced knowledge mining and
provides the results of the present research. Examples from an
implementation and a case study on knowledge mining and spatial
representations are given. The case study utilises commonly
available unstructured data and creates new multi-disciplinary
context, especially spatial mapping of entities and integration with
data and advanced tools, which can be used for further analysis,
e.g., automated and visual analysis. The methodology can employ
integrated knowledge resources and services for mapping support
and can be applied to any content from arbitrary disciplines.
The results of the mapping to new context can be used for
knowledge mining workﬂows, for gaining new insight, and for
creating and further improving long-term knowledge resources.
The methodology also supports automated learning processes.
This research aims on creating required bases for these goals
and for new practical mining procedures and algorithms.

INTRODUCTION
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that any knowledge,
e.g., based on unstructured and structured data, can contain
parts, which may refer to other knowledge but which are
not explicitely linked. Further, existing methods promising
to deal with lexical and term mapping or ontologies showed
deﬁcient and inadequate for coping with challenges of arbitrary
knowledge mapping and multi-dimensional context. Methods
[1] and implementations for automated mapping [2] are not
sufﬁcient, the more as approaches do not span disciplines [3].
Term identiﬁcation [4] is not suitable for mapping beyond
simple context like bibliographic data, too. Available mapping
approaches are very limited to non-general knowledge related
tasks [5], even when dealing with context [6].
The methodology presented here was developed in order to
identify entities inside of or referenced with data and create
new context for knowledge objects and entities. Knowledge is
an excellent integrator as it can complement, e.g., from factual,
conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge.
Knowledge mapping is the process of creating mappings
between two data objects. In that way knowledge mapping
contributes signiﬁcantly to data integration and data sciences
methods [7]. The means of referring objects and sub-objects,
“entities”, with a new context is considered as “knowledge
mapping”. Objects, e.g., a document, a part of a text, or an
image may be associated with other objects, by its knowledge,
e.g., its factual or conceptual knowledge. For example, creating
new spatial context for textual entities in knowledge objects
requires to build non-ﬁxed associations, apply a fuzzy spatial
locate, and implement a text location to map-mapping.
The procedure enables to automatically create a spatial
mapping for possible locations in a document, e.g., Points Of
Interest (POI) or other places in a data set or ﬁle.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II
introduces the new methodology applied for knowledge map-
ping. Section III discusses previous work, components, and
used resources. Section IV presents the implementation and
case study based on the methodology. Section V presents
generated interactive dynamical context examples. Section VI
summarises the lessons learned, conclusions, and future work.
II.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology can be used for creating new object
and entity context environments, e.g., in knowledge mining
context. The following steps describe the methodology.
1)
Start is an arbitrary object.
2)
Object / entity analysis.
3)
Object / entity mapping.
4)
Context creation.
5)
Result is an object and / or entity with a new context
environment.
Objects can be arbitrary objects, unstructured or structured,
unreferenced or referenced, e.g., containing different entities
of content. The methodology is not limited to any possibly
restricted implementation or platform. In case of textual objects
and entities, the object can, e.g., be a text document. In
case the mapping targets on geo-referencing otherwise non
geo-referenced objects or entities, then the mapping can be
considered a spatial mapping. With the latter target the context
creation can be considered a spatial visualisation.
The methodology of knowledge mapping for arbitrary ob-
jects and entities can be schematically summarised (Figure 1).

Data and modules are provided by Knowledge Resources, originary
resources, and application resources and components.
The facility for consistently describing knowledge is a
valuable quality, especially conceptual knowledge, e.g., using
the Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC). The knowledge
resources objects can refer to main UDC-based classes, which
for this publication are taken from the Multilingual Universal
Decimal Classiﬁcation Summary (UDCC Publication No. 088)
[8] released by the UDC Consortium under the Creative
Commons Attribution Share Alike 3.0 license [9] (ﬁrst release
2009, subsequent update 2012).
Data and objects result from public, commonly available,
and specialised Knowledge Resources. The Knowledge Re-
sources are containing factual and conceptual knowledge
as well as documentation and instances of procedural and
metacognitive knowledge. These resources contain multi-
disciplinary and multi-lingual data and context.
Context data for calculations and visualisation also requires
cartographic thematic context data. The knowledge resources
were integrated with data based on the gridded ETOPO1 1-arc-
minute global relief model data [10]. Data can be composed
from various sources, e.g., adding Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission (SRTM) data [11].
The Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) [12] devel-
oped by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research
(UCAR/Unidata), National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR) is used for spatial context data. NetCDF is an array
based data structure for storing multi-dimensional data. A
NetCDF ﬁle is written with an ASCII header and stores the
data in a binary format, e.g., with a mapping suite.
The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) [13] suite application
components are used for handling the spatial data, applying
the related criteria, and for the visualisation.
The visualisation ﬁles generated from the mapping results
are using the Keyhole Markup Language (KML), an eXtended
Markup Language (XML) based format for specifying spatial
data and content. KML is considered an ofﬁcial standard of
the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The KML description
can be used with many spatial components and purposes, e.g.,
with a Google Earth or Google Maps presentation [14], with a
Marble representation [15], using OpenStreetMap (OSM) [16].
Modules are employing Perl Compatible Regular Expres-
sions (PCRE) for specifying common string patterns and Perl
[17] for component wrapping purposes with this case study.
IV.
IMPLEMENTATION CASE STUDY: SPATIAL CONTEXT
The following sections provide information regarding im-
plemented components (lxloccoord, module for location
coordinates) and a practical case study, which was done
for demonstrating the methodology of mapping objects and
entities, creating new context environments. The case study
shows components, which were built for mapping scenarios
creating spatial context (Figure 3) and illustrates new insights
and relevance for knowledge creation and advanced mining.
A. The components
All the components and modules required for the architec-
ture (Figure 3) were implemented. The following components
were created for the practical implementation of the three
major central modules, object / entity analysis, mapping, and
context creation, demonstrating all steps of the methodology.
•
The object / entity analysis modules process objects for
entities, which can be fed into a mapping mechanism.
•
The pre-ﬁlters change, mark, and remove entities before
the mapping modules try to create entity mappings.
•
The mapping modules do have the task to deliver spatial
coordinates for appropriate entities.
•
The post-ﬁlters change, mark or remove entities after the
resolver worked on entities for a spatial mapping.
•
The context creation modules deliver the geo-referencing
for a spatial application.
The modules can be centralised or distributed, e.g., imple-
mented as a local directory of comparable and resolved entities
or an online service. Appropriate directories can be provided
by knowledge resources as well as by spatial mapping services.
Change processes in pre- and post-ﬁlters can include uniﬁ-
cation, improvements for resolvability, mapping and so on.
Different application components with different features can
be deployed for dynamical and interactive use and visualisa-
tion, e.g., GMT, Marble, and Google Maps.

A global view of all resulting entities automatically anal-
ysed and mapped from the single object [18] is shown in
Figure 10. The single-object-view integrates the new spatial
context of the object entities with a high precision topographic-
oceanographic thematic view. The bullets are very much
oversized for this illustration. The respective components are
provided by GMT suite applications, especially pscoast and
gmtselect [19], which allow a multitude of spatial operations
and criteria in context with the entities. Further, KML can be
used with many spatial applications, e.g., with Marble and
Google Maps. Generators can be conﬁgured to mark different
types of locations with different markers. It is also possible
to automatically mark locations with thumbnail photos being
associated with the respective location and so on.

FURTHER DYNAMICAL CONTEXT EXAMPLES
Figure 11 is a screenshot of an dynamical, interactive view
(Marble), a political map context for above created context.
Figure 11. New context for automatically created analysis and mapping of
resulting entities of a single object: Political context for labeled entities.
A consecutive mapping allows to analyse the entities in com-
pletely new context. For example, parts of an unstructured doc-
ument can be put into context with any type of n-dimensional
information, e.g., historical and climatological context by using
spatial information [20] and mapping for ﬁnding links. In this
case, data entities can be spatially mapped and associated with
multi-dimensional data from many disciplines, and data entities
can not only be associated in space but also in time. The data
allows to do detailed knowledge mining analysis as well as
visual analysis. For the created context, Figures 12 and 13
show screenshots of an interactive globe-view (Marble) with
climate zone context and an interactive view (Google Earth)
with Earth view context.
Figure 12. New context for automatically created analysis and mapping of
resulting entities of a single object: Climate zones context in 3D.
Figure 13. New context for automatically created analysis and mapping of
resulting entities of a single object: Google Earth context, labeled entities.
Besides the new context of spatial distribution and according
algorithms and math, the new context environments build links
in order to associate entities with knowledge from arbitrary
disciplines and proceed with further analysis.
Due to conceptual attributes of knowledge mapping and
spatial algorithms, the implementation allows high grades of
scalability and fuzziness. New context can also be kept and
used in learning systems components. This, e.g., can provide
conditional object / entity aggregation and time sequences.

CONCLUSION
This paper introduces a new methodology for knowledge
based mapping of arbitrary objects and entities and creating
new multi-dimensional context. The research presented the
theoretical background, a successful implementation based on
the methodology and a case study. The methodology fulﬁlls
the goals of successfully creating new context, knowledge
mapping can improve complex knowledge mining and asso-
ciated tasks as well as it can be beneﬁcial for the development
of knowledge resources. A practical case study, evaluated by
groups of independent researchers, showed that applying the
methodology can create relevant new context for entities in
commonly available unstructured data. Mapping to a spa-
tial context is just one of an arbitrary number of possible
mappings, which can be created with the methodology. The
quality of results can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from a training and
learning phase, depending on context. Here, with resolving
nearly all possible place entities with the used new resources,
the creation and learning phase of the modules accumulates to
several years. The methodology allowed to implement a data-
centric checkpointing, which corresponds to associated learn-
ing processes. As shown, in most cases it may be advisable
for ﬂexibility to create modular architectures of components
instead of monolithic applications. It can further be convenient
to consider robustness and reliability of service modules,
depending on the architecture of an overall implementation.
One means of dealing with infrastructure can be a failure
correction, e.g., multiple task runs and check modules.
Analysis and case studies are on the way implementing
advanced context generation, e.g., with spatial visualisation,
2D, 3D, route mapping, public transport, animation, and ﬂy-
over tours as well as analysing computational requirements,
which are widely scalable, depending on implementation of
components and computing architectures.
In addition, future work concentrates on further developing
and improving the mapping modules and features for closer
integration with the multi-disciplinary knowledge resources.
