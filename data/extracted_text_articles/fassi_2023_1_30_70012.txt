Abstract—Rail transport services are emerging as a major 
sustainable transportation option, especially in metropolitan 
areas. However, these services are significantly dependent on 
high investments and complex logistics, which creates the need 
to identify opportunities to minimize the waste of resources so 
that these services remain affordable and competitive. The 
digital twin, one of the core concepts of the Industry 4.0 
paradigm, enables detailed, real-time monitoring of the state of 
a piece of equipment during its operation. For this reason, the 
digital twin represents an important support in ensuring sound 
decision making. This work seeks to explore the potential of 
the digital twin to support the monitoring of the conditions of 
railway vehicles and railroad infrastructure. First, a research 
was conducted on the implementations and studies of digital 
twins carried out in recent years. Next, two digital twin 
prototypes – a digital twin of a railway vehicle model, and 
another one for a section of a railroad - were developed. Both 
prototypes are composed of a relational database for storing 
the data on the operational conditions of the equipment, a 
mobile application that works as a dashboard of the digital 
between the application and the database. With the developed 
prototypes, it was possible to glimpse how the digital twin 
concept provides a deeper knowledge of the working conditions 
of the components of a train. Besides, the prototype also 
supports preventive maintenance through the analysis of the 
historical evolution of the data collected from these 
components. The results of this study also allow the 
identification 
of 
possible 
improvements 
and 
research 
opportunities for future work.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Accelerated technological and scientific progress over 
the last few centuries has enabled the worldwide growth of 
industrialization [1]. This phenomenon began with the First 
Industrial Revolution at the end of the 18th century, which 
introduced mechanical manufacturing facilities powered by 
water and steam, as well as equipment such as the 
mechanical loom. A century later, the Second Industrial 
Revolution was marked by the spread of mass-production 
factories powered by electricity, along with the introduction 
of division of labor. The Third Industrial Revolution, which 
took place in the early 1970s, was characterized by the 
employment of electronics and information technology (IT) 
to achieve an even greater level of automation in 
manufacturing processes [2]. The emergence of Internet of 
Things (IoT) technologies has led to a new industrial 
paradigm shift, which has been dubbed Industry 4.0 [3]. The 
transition from centralized industrial control systems to 
decentralized intelligent systems can be considered the 
central principle behind the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The 
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) – which refers to the real 
time collection and sharing of data between products, 
components and industrial machines – allows industrial 
systems to adapt their behavior to different operating 
conditions [3]. 
One of the key technologies in the Industry 4.0 paradigm 
is the digital twin concept. The digital twin makes it possible 
to integrate the physical world with the virtual world by 
creating a virtual representation of a piece of equipment or 
object. For this reason, a digital twin facilitates the building 
of information systems that offer a solid basis for decision-
making [4]. Consequently, this concept has been adopted not 
only in the context of industrial production, but also in 
sectors such as urban planning and health [5]. The digital 
twin is also a promising technology for improving and 
modernizing rail transport processes. As these operations are 
significantly dependent on high investments and complex 
logistics, it is desirable to optimize costs related to 
equipment maintenance and modernization, as well as 
minimize downtime. The digital twin concept can be 
employed to tackle these challenges, as it enables the 
monitoring of the operational conditions of rail transport 
systems and its resources [6]. 
Rail transport represents a crucial service for a country's 
logistical and economic scenario, as it allows the 
transportation of a large number of passengers and heavy 
loads over long distances. In addition, it is an important 
means of transportation for maintaining a sustainable 
economy [7]. Considering the worsening climate crisis - to 
which the saturation of the road system contributes 
significantly - it is necessary to increase the competitiveness 
and attractiveness of rail transport services. For this reason, 
the European Commission has strongly recommended an 
increase in the share of rail transport compared to road 
transport [7]. 
The present paper seeks to explore the potential of the 
digital twin concept for rail transport support, especially 
regarding the monitoring of the conditions of railway 
vehicles and railroads, and the implementation of predictive 
maintenance. To this end, two digital twin prototypes were

developed: a digital twin of a train model, as well as a digital 
twin of a section of railroad. Both prototypes consist of a 
database, a web server and a mobile application for data 
visualization. This work was carried out as part of the 
Ferrovia 4.0 research project and was accompanied by 
project partners throughout the development process. 
The remainder of this work is structured as follows. 
Section II details related work in digital twins. Section III 
describes the methods and tools used in the development of 
the present work. Section IV delineates the process of 
implementation of the digital twin prototypes. The employed 
evaluation method is explained in Section V, and its results 
are presented and discussed in Section VI. Lastly, Section 
VII presents the conclusions and opportunities for future 
work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
The concept, as well as the term "digital twin" itself, 
were introduced in 2003 by Grieves in the Product Lifecycle 
Management course at the University of Michigan. At the 
time, the notion of virtual representations of physical 
products was in its infancy, and the technological limitations 
meant that data on the real product had to be collected 
manually through paper [8]. These same limitations were the 
main cause behind the lack of practical studies related to 
digital twins in the years following its introduction [9]. 
Although not very specific, a preliminary digital twin 
model was proposed by Grieves at the time. This model had 
three main components: the real product, the virtual product 
and the data connections responsible for linking the real and 
virtual 
products 
[8][9]. 
Accelerated 
advances 
in 
communication, sensor, simulation and big data technologies 
over the course of the 2000s have contributed to the rise in 
the number of digital twin studies over the last decade, as 
these advances enabled the automated collection of product 
data [9]. Fig. 1 shows the growth in the number of scientific 
publications related to digital twins since the introduction of 
this concept. 
In 2011, the first scientific journal article on the concept 
of the digital twin was published [9]. In this article, Tuegel et 
al., [10] sought to apply the digital twin concept to improve 
the prediction of the useful life of aircrafts, which at the time 
consisted of using individual physical models of the different 
categories of stress exerted on the airframe. To this end, the 
authors proposed the use of high-fidelity models for each 
unit of a specific variety of aircraft in an inventory. By using 
data on the estimated flight path and expected maneuvers for 
a given mission assigned to the aircraft, these models could 
perform a simulation and calculate the level of stress that 
would be exerted on the machine's structure as a result of the 
flight [10]. 
In an article published in the following year, NASA 
formalized the definition of a digital twin as a multi-physics, 
multi-scale, probabilistic, high-fidelity simulation that uses 
historical data, sensor data and physical models to reflect the 
state of a real product. In this article, the authors proposed 
the use of digital twins to address the shortcomings of 
conventional vehicle certification and fleet management 
methods employed at NASA and the United States Air Force 
[11]. 
Guo et al., [12] proposed a modular approach to assist in 
the development of a flexible digital twin for evaluating 
factory designs. The authors make use of parameterized and 
reusable modules that correspond to real physical entities to 
make the process of developing the digital twin more 
flexible, dynamic and faster. This approach results in a 
simulation model made up of modules that are independent 
of each other, which speeds up any changes to the model and 
enables collaboration between multiple designers [12]. 
Vachalek et al., [13] presented a digital twin-based 
approach for production line optimization. The authors used 
a simulated pneumatic cylinder production line paired with a 
detailed digital twin of the actual physical process. In 
addition 
to 
enabling 
the 
simulation 
of 
alternative 
manufacturing 
scenarios 
by 
modifying 
production 
parameters, the digital twin was also able to monitor the 
process in real time and identify opportunities for 
minimizing resource consumption [13]. 
Tao and Zhang [14] proposed the concept of the digital 
twin shop-floor, which consists of a virtual reproduction of 
the geometry, behavior and rules of a given shop-floor. This 
digital twin is updated in real time according to data related 
to the operations carried out on the physical shop floor. This 
enables the digital twin to carry out simulation, evaluation 
and optimization tasks, as well as regulating physical 
operations automatically as required [14]. 
Haag and Anderl [15] presented a proof of concept of the 
digital twin by employing it to a bending beam test 
procedure. The authors designed a test bench in which two 
actuators are used to apply force to both sides of the beam in 
order to make it bend. Integrated sensors are responsible for 
measuring 
the 
resulting 
force 
and 
calculating 
the 
displacement of the beam by using the difference in the 
position of the actuators. This data is sent to a digital twin of 
the test bench, which consists of a three-dimensional model 
of the built structure and a dashboard. Using this dashboard, 
users can monitor data about the force applied to the beam 
and the degree of displacement, as well as control the test 
bench's actuators [15].

Liu et al., [16] developed a digital twin-based approach 
to support the planning of diesel engine machining processes 
by analyzing and reusing knowledge from previous 
procedures. The digital twin built by the authors consists of 
geometry information and data on the current state of the 
equipment. This data was then combined with the 
accumulated process knowledge and then filtered through a 
similarity calculation algorithm, which discarded the process 
knowledge information that did not correspond to the current 
operation. The result was the set of process knowledge that 
was a candidate for the optimization procedure. Finally, the 
diesel engine components were applied to a prototype 
module in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed 
method [16]. 
Jeschke and Grassmann [6] proposed a strategy for 
implementing digital twins in the German rail transport 
system. The authors presented a use case of an Intercity 
Express train, a high-speed rail transportation service that 
connects several cities in Germany and other European 
countries. According to the authors, by allowing the 
representation of a real object in a virtual environment, the 
digital twin concept enables the monitoring of the rolling 
stock in real time and the identification of unplanned 
changes 
in 
service 
operations. 
Through 
data-based 
evaluation and simulation, a digital twin can make early 
predictions of future events, which enables predictive 
maintenance and preventive measures against possible 
failures, as well as avoiding the waste of financial resources. 
The authors also identify some of the biggest obstacles to the 
implementation of digital twins in the context of the German 
rail transport service. They point to the absence of technical 
norms and standards for the interoperable operation of digital 
twins on a network, as well as legal barriers to obtaining and 
using data from pre-existing control and monitoring systems 
on the system's trains [6]. 
The Alstom and Simplan companies have developed a 
digital twin – by using the Anylogic simulation tool - with 
the aim of optimizing transport services on the West Coast 
Main Line, one of the UK's most important railways. 
Although there are fixed schedules for train operations, the 
need for maintenance regimes and the possibility of faults or 
accidents make it extremely difficult to predict the location 
of trains a few days in advance. Considering that simulations 
based on fixed data are inadequate in this case, a digital twin 
made it possible to explore different scenarios for optimizing 
rail services more efficiently and accurately [17]. 
III. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
In order to achieve the desired objectives, two digital 
twin prototypes were built: the first one consists of a digital 
twin of an ARCO train, based on the vehicles operated by 
public transport services in Portugal. The second prototype is 
a digital twin of a 5km section of railroad based on a real 
section that is part of the Portuguese railway system. Both 
prototypes include mobile applications which serve as 
dashboards for the digital twins. These applications offer a 
visualization of metrics relating to a series of damage 
indicators, which are associated with the components of the 
vehicles and the railroad infrastructure. 
The Unity game engine [18] was chosen tool for the 
development of the mobile applications. Although primarily 
designed for video game development, game engines are 
extremely versatile tools that offer a wide range of 
programming libraries and plugins for building interactive 
software. In addition, many of the main game engines on the 
market are either free for non-commercial use or are open-
source projects. Unity was specifically chosen because for its 
versatility, its extensive support for 3D graphics and third-
party plugins, as well as for being frequently employed in 
other research work on the topic of digital twins [5]. 
The data used by the digital twins was stored in relational 
databases, which are accessed by the mobile applications via 
requests to PHP files stored on an Apache web server. We 
decided to use relational databases as they allow for greater 
organization and structuring of the data. MySQL was 
selected as the relational database management system as the 
PHP language offers native support for the software. 
We also chose to run both the databases and the web 
server inside Docker containers. Docker, unlike hypervisors, 
performs software virtualization at the operating system 
level, using individual user space instances called containers. 
Each instance contains an application and its dependencies 
and is completely isolated from other instances and the rest 
of the operating system. Fig. 2 illustrates the structure of the 
developed system. 
Partners involved in the research project in which the 
proposed work is framed accompanied the development of 
the prototypes through presentations in meetings and 
workshops. The final validation of the prototypes was carried 
out through a quality assessment survey, which was sent to 
the project partners to assess both the degree of suitability of 
the graphic interface of the mobile applications, and the 
potential of the prototypes to support railway operations in a 
real context. 
IV. 
IMPLEMENTATION 
This section details the structure of the proposed 
prototypes, as well as the functionalities provided by each of 
digital twin’s mobile applications.  
A. Railway Vehicle Digital Twin 
The mobile dashboard of the railway vehicle digital twin 
provides the user with a view of the metrics about two 
damage indicators associated with the components of the 
hypothetical vehicles: an indicator of the transmissibility of 
damage to the axle boxes, and an indicator of the length of 
wheel flats. The data relating to these indicators is synthetic 
and was obtained through simulations of different damage 
scenarios. 
Through the mobile application, the user is able to select 
the specific vehicle and railway carriage they wish to 
analyze. The application interface also features a computer-
aided design (CAD) model that represents an abstracted view 
of the railway carriage. This model was built using the 
Blender 3D modeling tool.

Figure 2. Structure of the developed digital twin system 
 
Vehicle and railway carriage selection is carried out 
through dropdown menus. It is also possible to navigate 
along the carriages of a vehicle using two navigation buttons. 
The component of the vehicle is selected directly on the 
vehicle's CAD model by using touch input. As this prototype 
only includes damage indicators for axle boxes and 
wheelsets, these are only component types that can be 
selected by the user. An indication of the level of damage in 
each carriage is displayed next to their respective carriage 
option in the carriage selection dropdown menu. This 
indication has four different levels, which are dependent on 
the severity of the damage measured on a given carriage: a 
green icon, which corresponds to the absence of damage or 
the presence of  superficial irregularities only; a yellow icon, 
which represents the presence of slight damage; an orange 
icon, which points to the existence of significant damage; or 
a red icon, which warns of the presence of serious damage. 
Similarly, each of the axle boxes and wheelsets in the CAD 
model are displayed in one of these colors, according to the 
level of damage shown by the indicators with which they are 
associated. The user interface also features an "Exploded 
View" button, which can be used by the user to switch the 
vehicles’ view between the standard view - with the vehicle 
properly assembled - and the exploded view - in which the 
carbody, bogies, axleboxes and wheelsets are displayed as if 
they were disassembled. 
An indication of the currently selected component, as 
well as the most recent measurement of the damage indicator 
to which the component is associated, are displayed in the 
left corner of the top menu. In addition, the user can also 
view a history graph of the indicator through the "View 
History" option. The user can navigate along the graph by 
tapping the left and right sides of the screen. Lastly, the user 
can also activate or deactivate the top menu freely. When it 
is deactivated, the CAD model of the vehicle takes up the 
entire screen. Fig. 3 shows the main view of the vehicle’s 
mobile dashboard. Fig. 4 presents the history graph of the 
damage indicator. 
B. Railroad Infrastructure Digital Twin 
In a similar way to the railway vehicle’s digital twin, the 
data on the railroad’s damage indicators is synthetic and was 
obtained through simulations of several damage scenarios. 
 
Figure 3. Main view of the railway vehicle's mobile dashboard 
 
 
Figure 4. History graph of the damage indicator 
 
This data refers to vertical and horizontal irregularity 
indicators on both the left and right rails. Each point on a 
5km stretch of a railroad has values associated with these 
indicators. For visualization purposes on the prototype, we 
decided to use a 100m interval between each point. 
Therefore, fifty points along this stretch were taken into 
account. 
A static image obtained using the Google Street View 
API was associated with each of these points. The Uniform 
Resource Locator (URL) addresses of the images are stored 
in a MySQL database, as is the data on the indicators of 
irregularities in the infrastructure. The railway prototype's 
mobile application, similarly to how the vehicle prototype 
works, accesses the database by requesting PHP files and 
displays the static image associated with the selected point 
on the railroad. As Unity does not offer native support for 
displaying web pages, the third-party plugin UniWebView 
was employed to perform this task. 
Through the mobile dashboard, the user is able to 
navigate along the fifty points of the railroad and interact 
with a map of the railroad section. This map was obtained 
via Google Maps and represents an aerial view of the 
railroad. Similarly to the approach used in the vehicle’s 
digital twin, alert icons with different colors are displayed on 
the map according to the severity of the irregularities at each 
point. These alerts can be yellow, light orange, dark orange 
or red, which correspond to light, significant, very significant 
and serious damage respectively. By tapping on one of these

alerts, the user can find out what the maximum permitted 
speed is for the selected point, given the level of irregularity 
indicated. The user interface of the railroad’s mobile 
dashboard is shown by Fig. 5. 
V. 
EVALUATION 
The evaluation of the proposed prototypes was done on 
meetings throughout the development of the work and 
through an online quality assessment survey sent to the 
Ferrovia 4.0 project partners, which served as a complement 
to the discussions raised at the meetings. The present paper 
will only discuss the evaluation of the railway vehicle 
prototype, as the railroad prototype will be assessed at a later 
date. 
We decided to formulate the survey items using the 
Likert scale, which is a technique for measuring respondents' 
opinions and attitudes towards a series of statements that 
represent value judgments. The respondent must indicate 
their attitude towards each statement on an ascending scale 
of agreement. This scale usually has five values, which are 
represented by the numbers 1 to 5 [19]. This method was 
chosen because it is the most suitable technique for 
measuring partners' opinions on the quality of the mobile 
application's graphic interface and the potential of the 
prototype as a whole. In addition, the Likert scale is widely 
used for the assessment of software usability evaluation [20]. 
The survey was developed in an online format through 
the Google Forms tool and sent to partners via email. We 
opted for an online survey because it makes communication 
with partners easier and faster, as it allows participants to 
respond to the survey at any time. Alongside the survey, we 
also included a demonstration video of the railway vehicle’s 
digital twin prototype, which respondents had to watch 
before submitting their answers. This was done to simplify 
the evaluation process and prevent partners from relying 
solely on the documentation made during the development of 
the project to answer the survey. A five-value Likert scale 
was used for the survey items, which are represented by the 
numbers 1 to 5 and interpreted in ascending order as 
"strongly disagree", "partly disagree", "neutral", "partly 
agree" and "strongly agree". A text field was also included 
for feedback, where respondents could, if they wished, 
describe their opinions on the prototype more clearly. It 
should also be noted that the survey was designed to be 
answered anonymously. Table 1 presents the statements 
included in the survey. 
VI. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The survey was sent to 63 partners in total, 3 of whom 
responded. Although the survey was answered by around 5% 
of the total number of people to whom it was sent, it should 
be reiterated that part of the validation of the prototype was 
carried out in meetings with the partners throughout the 
development of the project.

The participants' answers to items S1 to S3 indicate a 
generally positive opinion about the user interface of the 
mobile application, although some issues were raised 
regarding the clarity of the information and navigation, 
which still need to be improved. The feedback given by one 
of the respondents mentions that, when the application 
launches, the user interface displays placeholder texts in the 
dropdown menus and in the sections where the names of the 
component and the chosen variable will be displayed. These 
texts consist of generic words such as "Train", "Component 
Name" and "Variable". This could make the interface less 
intuitive, as it creates confusion among users. Changing the 
placeholder text to explanatory phrases - such as "Select 
variable" instead of "Variable" - could help make the user 
interface more intuitive.

A different participant also mentioned that they would 
like to be able to "click" on the vehicle component they want 
to analyze. Although the meaning of the term "click" was not 
entirely clear in this case, it is understood that the respondent 
would like to select the vehicle component directly on the 
CAD model of the vehicle. This functionality already exists 
and it is essential for the interaction with the application, as it 
is the only way to select components. This means that the 
need for direct interaction with the CAD model of the train is 
not obvious to some users. The inclusion of an explanatory 
text - such as "Touch the train to select the component you 
want to analyze" - could eliminate this issue. 
Despite receiving a positive evaluation from the 
respondents, the history graph of the damage indicators also 
has some points that need to be improved. It was mentioned 
that the way the graph is presented would not be appropriate, 
as continuous lines are used to illustrate variations in 
measurements. These lines, according to feedback from one 
of the respondents, do not represent real variations and, 
because of this, broken lines should be used instead. In fact, 
the value variations illustrated in the graph do not correspond 
to reality, which could lead to confusion among users and 
even result in misunderstandings in decision-making if the 
prototype was employed in a real-world scenario. As stated 
by the respondent, the use of broken lines would be the most 
appropriate method. 
The participants also mentioned that it would be useful to 
include a button for viewing measurements prior to those 
displayed on the graph. The functionality for navigating 
along the graph is already implemented and is done by 
tapping the right and left corners of the graph's window. 
However, due to the lack of buttons or visual indications 
alerting users to the existence of this functionality, it can go 
unnoticed. This shortcoming could be remedied by simply 
adding buttons with arrows pointing to the right and left, 
positioned in the right and left corners of the graph, 
respectively. 
Finally, the opinions expressed by the respondents in 
items 4 and 5 indicate that the proposed digital twin 
prototype shows potential for supporting the monitoring of 
railway vehicles and the implementation of preventive 
maintenance in a real-world context. The feedback indicates 
that, although some corrections are needed in relation to the 
user interface of the mobile application, the prototype 
displays the essential characteristics of a digital twin. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The present work was designed to explore the potential 
of the digital twin concept in supporting rail transport 
operations, particularly with regard to monitoring and 
preventive maintenance. This objective was achieved by 
developing digital twin prototypes of a railway vehicle and 
of a section of railroad, which provided a greater 
understanding of how the digital twin concept can offer a 
more complete and functional view of the operational 
conditions of railway equipment during operation. It was 
also possible to see how this concept supports the 
implementation of preventive maintenance processes for 
vehicles, by making it possible to visualize the evolution of 
damage indicators relating to the vehicle's components. 
Although the proposed prototypes allow us to see the 
potential of the digital twin concept in the context of rail 
transport, there are several improvements that could be 
implemented. Among them is the incorporation of 
functionalities for sending and displaying warnings, through 
which users would be able to alert others to potential defects 
or physical irregularities in the vehicles and in the railroad 
infrastructure. The mobile application would allow users to 
submit alert notes, which would be stored in a database and 
associated to the corresponding equipment. 
Another improvement that could be implemented is the 
real-time collection and display of vehicle location data 
using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) sensors. With this 
method, it would be possible to identify the exact location of 
a vehicle along its route, as well as allow the subsequent 
display of information about the schedule of the vehicles, 
such as the time taken to complete a given route. 
The present work could also encourage interest in 
exploring the potential of other technologies in the Industry 
4.0 paradigm - such as augmented reality and algorithms for 
analyzing big data and computer vision - in the context of 
rail transport services. Some of these technologies could be 
used, for example, to support the maintenance processes of 
train components: by using a mobile application, operators 
would be able to view interactive guides - generated by 
computer vision algorithms - and maintenance instructions in 
augmented reality.
