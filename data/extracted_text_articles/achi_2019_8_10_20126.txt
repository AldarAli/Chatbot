Abstract— Today, user-centered design has become an 
essential and successful practice to design interactive systems. 
With the growing acknowledgment of the importance of universal 
usability and the need for influencing designs, User-Centered 
Design (UCD) ought to be structured to adapt its methodologies 
to the needs and requirements of people with disabilities. This 
paper is preliminary research that identifies the most relevant 
UCD methods, needs and best practices for working with Visually 
Impaired and Blind (VIB) children.  We start by reviewing UCD 
methods and identify those that are most suitable for VIB 
children. We then propose a UCD process for VIB children and 
discuss how they apply with respect to needs, requirements and 
abilities of VIB children. 
Keywords- User centered design; Visually impaired and blind 
child ; Participatory design; E-learning system  
I.  INTRODUCTION 
User-Centered Design (UCD) is a collection of processes 
and techniques that emphasize putting users at the center of 
product design and development. It considers user’s 
requirements, needs, objectives and feedback. The Usability 
Professionals Association (UPA) [1] formally defines UCD as 
an approach to design that grounds the process in information 
about the people who use the product.  
According to Carr et al. [2], in User-Design users are 
engaged in the actual creation of their own systems in 
negotiation with leaders and designers; meanwhile in User-
Centered Design overall control remains in the hands of 
designers and approval power remains with leadership. We 
believe that by involving users at each phase of the 
development process, the end product will respond to their 
characteristics and, therefore, provide end-users with a positive 
experience and better usability.  
In comparison to their counterparts, children with visual 
disabilities have entirely different ways to structure, order, and 
perceive the world, assuming a singular mental model quite 
distinct from sighted children. Children with non-visual mental 
models have to cope with devices designed for children with 
visual mental models. Even though interactive systems 
designed for sighted children go through a rigorous UCD 
process, it does not mean that they meet the needs of non-
sighted children. This is a major issue affecting both usability 
and accessibility. Lots of UCD research exists for VIB 
adults, such as those surveyed by Sahib et al. [3], however 
there is very little addressing VIB children [4]-[7].  
This research proposes revising the UCD process to 
be adapted to VIB children by identifying their needs and 
requirements, and then highlighting appropriate methods 
and best practices that cater to them. The paper is 
organized as follows: Section II gives a review of UCD and 
research with children and VIB children. Section III 
highlights the requirements and needs of VIB children and 
the UCD methods most appropriate for them. Section IV 
proposes a refined UCD process for VIB children. And 
finally, in Section V, we conclude with the summary and 
potential future research.

II. RELATED WORK 
In this section we summarize methods found in 
literature used to implement UCD in general, with children 
and those used more specifically with VIB children.   
A. User Centered Design 
UCD is design that is based around real user 
requirements, and typically involves task analysis, 
prototype development with users, evaluation, and iterative 
design [8]. Devi et al. [9] defined UCD as a framework in 
which usability goals, user characteristics, environment, 
tasks and workflow of a product, service or process are 
given extensive attention at each stage of a design process. 
According to ISO 9241-210, the UCD approach 
shown in Figure 1 takes into account the user's abilities, 
limitations and context in which the user operates to ensure 
the design of usable and accessible products [8][10]. As

illustrated in Figure 1, each iteration of the UCD process 
involves four distinct phases. The complete process includes 
multiple iterations of these four phases, until evaluation results 
are satisfactory, and all requirements have been met: 
1. Understanding the context of use:  gathering requirements. 
2. Requirements specification - specifying the user and 
organizational requirements 
3. Design - Producing designs, prototypes and solutions 
4. Evaluation - Carrying out user-based assessment of the site 
and test need satisfaction against user specific contexts. 
To implement User-Centered Design a myriad of 
methods have been adopted. Some methods are investigative 
in nature (e.g., surveys and interviews) while others are 
generative (e.g., brainstorming) [8][10]-[12]. A summarized 
list of UCD methods and the UCD stage they are appropriate 
for are shown in the first and second columns of Table 1.  
The context in which UCD methods are applied can 
differ depending on the target audience and system being 
developed. To identify several areas of interface improvement 
for the user interface of a Hazard Service system, Argyle et al. 
[13], conducted usability testing on experienced forecasting 
professionals via web-based tasks and a questionnaire. 
Meanwhile, in an attempt to maximize patient engagement 
Wachtler et al. [14] employed focus groups and semi-
structured interviews in the design of a clinical depression 
prediction tool that will be incorporated into routine clinical 
practice. To design a preference-based family planning 
decision system Stevens et al. [15] used focus groups, 
qualitative surveys and evaluation measures. Couture et al. 
[16] adopted scenarios and usability testing in designing a 
safety-reporting tool for hospitalized patients and their family 
members. To enhance IoT wearable systems, Bernal et al. [17] 
identified contextual needs and iterative interviews to reach 
safer environments in energy companies. With futuristic goals 
in mind, Eggen et al. [18], used similar UCD methods to 
achieve seamless integration of user experiences in smart 
homes. In the following sections we explain why UCD method 
choices differ when the target audience is younger in age.   
 
B. User-centered Design with Children 
Since 2002 there has been more interest in involving 
children in the design process to which some have expressed 
as a complex process [19]-[21]. Nesset et al. [22] argue that 
there are more advantages than disadvantages of including 
children in the design process. But the issues is not including 
them, it is more to do with engaging them in the process 
according to Rogers et al. [23]. This engagement can take on 
multiple forms, each with various dimensions: user, tester, 
informant or design partner [24]. Schepers et al. [25] for 
instance, look at the role of children in participatory design as 
a co-designer and not just a participant. While Sims [26] looks 
at how children can be an advantage when incorporated in the 
design process of healthcare technologies. 
 
        
Figure 2.  User Centered Design process according to ISO 9241-210. 
 
In education through gaming, Gelderblom [27][28] 
finds that in spite of involving younger children in the 
design of a web based educational game using well-tested 
techniques; participatory design successfully meets the 
requirements. Despite not having fully developed language 
skills, the participation of children in UCD has been 
successful, 
encourages 
creativity 
and 
offers 
many 
opportunities.  
 
C.  User-centered Design for VIB children  
It can be problematic for designers to exclusively 
depend on their expertise to correctly imagine the needs of 
a normal end user. Designers depend on UCD methods to 
better understand the end users’ needs. Moreover, it is 
more challenging for the designers to make sure that they 
effectively understand the difficulties and obstacles VIB 
end user faces while interacting with interfaces. In order to 
create usable and accessible products for visually impaired 
children (VIB), it is essential to include them in all stages 
of the development process. Mattheiss et al. [5]-[7] 
highlight 
the 
problem 
of 
having 
many 
existing 
participatory design attempts for visually impaired adults 
as opposed to very few involving children. Bateman et al. 
[29] successfully incorporated UCD to VIB students in the 
design of an electrostatic haptic touchscreen, resulting in a 
noticeably high percentage of accuracy  
The inclusionary model for involving impaired 
children in the design process defines different levels of 
involvement (user, tester, informant, design partner) as 
well as severity of disability [30]. The Children in the 
Center framework by Kärnä et al. [31] suggests the need 
for participation of children, families, and researchers. 
Some participatory design methods suggest workshops 
comprising of both blind and sighted people together, were 
sighted participants are blindfolded to experience and 
subsequently discuss problems blind participants have to

face [4]. Mattheiss et al. [7] discussed lessons learned 
regarding approaches and issues with multiple UCD methods 
used with VIB children. 
III. VIB CHILDREN'S REQUIREMENTS AND NEEDS 
In a dialogue system there is almost no difference in 
using interfaces between sighted and VIB user. However, in 
case of graphical user interfaces special needs and 
requirements of VIB child should be considered. In this 
section special requirements and needs of the tools and user 
interface features used by VIB children are presented. Later a 
recommended, semantically, and blind-friendly adaptive user 
centered design is proposed. 
A. 
VIB Requirements and Needs 
1. Information access is sequential [32]. At any given point, 
VIB users perceive only a snippet of the content and 
often lose contextual information.  
2. No rendition of graphics [33]. VIB users cannot perceive 
or interpret information communicated through images, 
color, and layout.  
3. Quick information scan is not possible [34]. VIB users 
cannot locate goal-relevant information efficiently and 
easily by scanning information.  
4. Keyboard-based [35]. VIB users cannot use functionality 
that requires mouse input.  
5. Complex layouts create problems. When Web pages have 
a complex layout, screen readers feedback becomes 
ambiguous [32]. Screen-readers also mispronounce many 
words according to Theofanos and Redish [36] which 
creates comprehension problems for the VIB user.  
6. Requires learning complex interface. VIB interaction 
requires memorizing hundreds of key commands [36]. 
The wide range of screen-reader functionality makes it 
more difficult for VIB users to remember and use 
appropriate functions for effective Web interaction.  
7. Higher cognitive load. Cognitive resources must be split, 
trying to understand the browser, the screen reader, and 
content [36]. This leads to greater cognitive burden for 
VIB users on the Web [37][38]. 
 
VIB individuals are particularly dependent on their 
hearing and tactile senses. Adapting a graphical user interface 
for blind people involves some specific usability requirements: 
1. The task has to be adequate given the capabilities of blind 
users (task adequacy), 
2. The user interface has to provide a balance between the 
2D access of sighted people and the 1D access of blind 
people (dimensional trade-off),  
3. The user interface has to provide specific access to all the 
relevant user interface objects (behavior equivalence), for 
blind people 
4. The user interface has to avoid losing relevant semantic 
information (semantic loss avoidance), & 
5. The interface has to deal with a wide variation in the 
functionality and programming of the assistive 
technologies for blind people (device-independency). 
B. 
Recommended UCD methods for VIB 
The UCD framework for VIB should be dependent 
upon feedback gathered in the form of interviews with 
assistive device experts, as well as preliminary tests with 
visual impaired users. There is a need to select suitable 
UCD methods for VIB students and adapt them according 
to the situation (e.g., verbalization of ongoing processes in 
the moderation of workshops, allowing students to note 
down text on their devices, with assistive technology 
instead of posters or sticky notes). Table 1 illustrates the 
UCD methods, which phase they can be used, whether or 
not they can be used with the VIB, whether they are 
suitable for children and whether they are recommended 
for the proposed UCD for VIB children.

To understand why some of the UCD methods listed are 
recommended in VIB child research we offer the following 
descriptions: 
1. Participatory design with VIB children can be 
challenging, as designers have to ensure their methods of 
communicating design ideas and feedback with users are 
appropriate and effective [39]. 
2. Low and high fidelity prototyping is a common way of 
brainstorming design ideas with users, but for VIB children 
visual 
prototyping 
techniques 
are 
not 
appropriate. 
Therefore, alternatives have been proposed: Brewster et al. 
[40] describe haptic paper prototypes that use cardboard 
mockups, and Miao et al. [41] describe a tactile paper 
prototyping approach using Braille and tactile graphic 
mockups. 
3. User survey questionnaires are classic investigation tools 
[42]. Implementation can be based on individual 
comprehension level and tailored to needs using either 
braille-based or Web-based surveys. With the increasing 
uses of technology, meeting accessibility standards of web-
based versions should be considered to ensure text is 
focused, presented correctly, and is well organized. 
4. Interviews & contextual inquiry/interviews are powerful 
design and requirement gathering tools. They can be 
administered structured or semi-structured and adjusted to 
suit the VIB child’s cognitive level and education. 
Investigations into user’s environments might help 
elicit specific data that may otherwise not be considered 
[43]. 
5. User observation/field study witnessing users in 
specific contexts and/or environments is as powerful as 
contextual inquiries. By observing VIB children in 
action researchers can immediately identify problems 
with completion of specific tasks, identify frustrations 
while using tools and recognize things that work more 
efficiently. Pointers drawn from observations regardless 
of their numbers are key to successful design. 
6. Brainstorming. 
Although 
tricky 
to 
implement 
effectively with VIB children, brainstorming sessions 
can result in a myriad of preferences, needs and 
direction for further product and application designs 
[44]. Sharing visuals, conveying hand gestures, and 
information gaps between participants are some of the 
concepts to keep in mind before running such sessions. 
7. Design 
walkthroughs 
Creativity 
is 
key 
when 
attempting to run design walkthroughs with VIB 
children. Abate et al. [45] recommended using suitable 
tools to convey design and incorporating storytelling or 
game play into the process to keep children aware and 
engaged. 
8. Usability testing and evaluation is one of the best 
tools to recognize problems and points of frustration for 
users [46]. Being in a room with a VIB child and using 
a master apprentice model for example, can help 
researchers identify needs versus extras and ease of use 
issues. In addition, usability testing offers the option of 
comparing two designs in one session, which can help 
reduce the number of sessions needed. However, 
recruitment of participants willing to sit in hour-long 
sessions is difficult for these evaluations. 
IV. UCD PROCESS FOR VIB CHILDREN 
The User-Centered Design process is made up of a set 
of iterative activities that result in a final design that meets 
all the user requirements, as shown in Figure 2. The 
process includes collecting feedback from the initial stages 
to the very end, beginning with analysis, specifying the 
user requirements, producing design solutions and 
evaluation in addition to iterative cycles of all phases until 
the design is complete.   
However, as shown previously, when designing for 
VIB children it is important to modify the UCD process to 
cater for their needs and requirements. The proposed UCD 
VIB child-friendly process, shown in Figure 3, has been 
refined to include recommended methods from Section III. 
To understand context of use during the analysis 
phase of working with VIB children, we recommend 
adopting 
a 
user 
survey 
questionnaire, 
contextual 
inquiry/interviews, or user observations and field studies.

Figure 3.  User centered Design adapted to a VIB Child user. 
 
VIB children are more likely to convey opinion and ideas 
through speech rather than on paper, and through semi-
structured interviews instead of structured ones. As for 
specifying user requirements, methods like analyzing the 
context of use, and depending on the type of design, 
brainstorming and scenarios of use have a higher chance of 
acquiring needs as opposed to other methods. Again, here we 
notice verbal methods are more effective in acquiring needs 
and requirements.   
Iterative design process phase with VIB children will 
benefit from methods, such as participatory design and high-
fidelity prototypes and heuristic evaluations only if applied by 
experts. Participatory design methods are popular when 
designing with children. The need to engage a VIB child in the 
design process and communicate the design ideas to them has 
to be in a form accessible to them. This can be achieved 
successfully using scenarios and dialogue interactions [3]. 
Once complete, the evaluation phase for VIB children 
includes usability testing and design walkthrough methods. 
Watching and listening to VIB children using design 
evaluation methods can be very rewarding if done correctly 
and with clearly set goals. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
User involvement in the design process for VIB children 
is crucial for effective interactive interfaces. The proposed 
UCD 
process 
recognizes 
VIB 
child 
specific 
needs, 
requirements, abilities, and accordingly recommends the most 
suitable UCD methods. The ultimate goal is always to deliver 
successful systems that are easy to use and satisfy user needs 
and help motivate VIB child live more independently in their 
everyday lives. The process also ensures that the design and 
development teams remain focused upon the key users they are 
designing for, the VIB child. For future work we will conduct 
experiments to determine the feasibility and validity of the 
recommended VIB-UCD methods.
