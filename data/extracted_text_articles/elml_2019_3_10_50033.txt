Abstract— Ever since ancient times, learning was a two-way 
process, a dialogue among the tutor and the learner. The 
transfer of knowledge implies social interaction, hence the 
dialogue is of utmost importance. With the widespread of 
social media and mobile systems, learners expect quick, easy 
responses to their questions any time of the day. As e-Learning 
systems promote time and location flexibility, synchronous 
dialogue in such systems should not be bound to the time 
frames that the instructor is available, but should allow 
learners active real-time feedback throughout the day. Such 
synchronous interaction is possible through a variety of tools 
like: automated intelligent grading, intelligent tutoring systems 
and intelligent facilitator agents embedded in the Learning 
Management System or social networks. This paper provides 
an overview of automated dialogue characteristics and a 
survey on recent research efforts in academia and industry in 
building intelligent dialogue capable systems. Imagine a system 
that adapts intelligently to learners’ requests and allows them 
to take control of their own learning, making the bulky 
learning interface transparent to the user.  
Keywords-adaptive chatbots; intelligent user interfaces; 
artificial intelligence; adaptive dialogue. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Generation Z, the first generation after Millennials, is 
defined as people born from the mid-1990s to the early 
2000s makes up approximate 25% of the U.S. population, 
making them a larger cohort than the Baby Boomers or 
Millennials [1][2]. The young generation is very comfortable 
with technology, and keen on using mobile devices in their 
daily routine. They want their learning to be personalized to 
meet their needs while still enabling collaboration with their 
peers and mentors. Learning on the move, using mobile 
devices and liberated from a static classroom environment 
such learners still require the face-to-face-like traditional 
classroom interaction. 
Due to the increase of multimedia content on the web, 
and deeper penetration of machine learning into various 
applications, it is possible to deploy adaptive systems that 
guide student learning at the users’ request. While 
multimedia is gaining popularity on the Web with many 
technologies that support animation, video, audio and even 
novel forms of haptic (i.e., tactile) interaction [3], 
unconstrained use of multimedia results in user interfaces 
that confuse users and makes it harder for them to understand 
the information [4]. To cope with the amount of information 
available online, the dialogue has to be adaptively managed 
based on the user’s requirements and level of knowledge [5]. 
Adaptive dialogues can be implemented through Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) supported active assistants (e.g., chat bots) 
and other intelligent tutoring systems [6]. Such automated 
systems respond to natural language requests, provide 
answers and learn in this process. Building on the data they 
acquire about the users’ requests, they can make suggestions, 
adapt information to the users’ needs, and simulate an 
instructor. 
While the course content is important, the content 
exchanged through the teacher and learner’s dialogue 
(synchronous and asynchronous) is the most important 
component in the e-Learning environment [7], even for 
hybrid courses approaches [8][9].   
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a 
brief overview of synchronous/asynchronous tools for 
dialogue support followed in Section 3 by a brief review of 
intelligent, adaptive dialogue with a tutoring agent. Section 4 
provides a survey on recent intelligent automated facilitators, 
including the avatar forms in Virtual Reality/Mixed Reality 
(VR/MR) environments. Near future trends are discussed in 
the conclusion. 
II. 
INTELLIGENT DIALOGUE IN E-LEARNING    
A new study [10], indicates that over 80% of high 
school students use smartphones regularly, while 90% of the 
students agree that tablets will change the way students 
learn in the very near future and more than 80% of them 
agree that using tablets in the classroom allows them to 
optimize their learning. In an effort to cope with these fast 
technological advances, a continuous improvement of 
course materials and adaptation to the mobile devices is 
required but not sufficient. Generating intelligent dialogue 
among the users of an e-Learning system becomes a 
challenge. Moreover, dialogue becomes itself the central 
piece of learning as the lack of dialogue usually is 
associated with the lack of interest in the topic. Research 
suggests that learning is also enabled from the observation 
of the dialogue, the reflection induced by the potential of 
submitting questions and answers, and in the interaction 
between the face-to-face and on-line environments [11]. 
Intelligent dialogue is an enabling discussion allowing 
the learner to advance his/her understanding of concepts and 
paradigms associated with a specific paradigm. Such 
dialogue may be established between the learner and the 
following types of tutors:

 
Instructor – in a synchronous or asynchronous session, 
where the instructor is the main decision factor in 
providing learning directions to the learner. 
 
Peer – refers to the peers of the leaner (i.e., other 
learners) that have understood a particular concept or 
paradigm and are capable of explaining the concept to 
the learner in a sometimes, more “understandable” way. 
 
Intelligent agent. A software component designed to 
manage and adapt to the learner’s requirements and 
background knowledge. Such a software component is 
usually driven by a machine learning algorithm [12] 
and it establishes a meaningful dialogue considering the 
 learner’s requirements and background. 
Regardless of the type of the participants in the 
dialogue, an e-Learning systems supports different types of 
communication tools. In case of an intelligent software 
agent, the integration of the software module with one or 
more communication tools must be achieved. The 
communication tools can be divided into synchronous and 
asynchronous as illustrated in Figure 1, and their use 
depends on the time availability of the participants.  
 
 
Figure 1. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Dialogue Technologies 
A. Intelligent Synchronous Dialogue 
Synchronous dialogue is an essential component of 
discussions, lectures and in general presentations that occur 
at a predefined point in time and are typical in a face-to-face 
lecture. With the wide spread and proliferation of the 
Internet, such synchronous dialogue is supported through 
learning environments that provide multiple ways of 
interacting, sharing and the ability to ask and answer 
questions 
in 
real-time 
using 
synchronous 
learning 
technologies. 
Videoconferencing, 
web-casts, 
instant 
messaging and interactive learning systems supporting chat-
based communication are just a few examples. 
Synchronous dialogue requires participants to be 
available at the same time, however there is another 
essential requirement that is sometimes forgotten: the 
participants must also have to dedicate similar time frames 
for dialogue (i.e., class times are often set to 50 minutes 
intervals).  Care must be taken to keep the dialogue from 
degrading into a monologue.  
Techniques to improve synchronous dialogue from the 
tutor’s 
perspective 
include: 
assessing 
the 
learners’ 
background knowledge and skills level to predict the 
capability of the learners to grasp the content and ensure 
class uniformity; establishing a rapport with the learner at 
the beginning of the dialogue; High interactivity by keeping 
text-light and activity-heavy to stimulate the interaction; 
Encourage the learner to send queries and share his insights; 
Adapt dialogue pace based on the learner. 
On the learner’s side, it is important that the learner 
assumes an active participation role in the dialogue. 
Furthermore, self-directed motivation is expected of the 
participants in synchronous dialogue. 
B. Intelligent Asynchronous Dialogue 
An asynchronous dialogue is usually built upon the idea of 
time flexibility from the participant’s perspective. While 
synchronous dialog requires participant to be online at the 
same time, asynchronous systems dialogue is usually build 
on communication systems like e-mail and discussion 
forums and their various forms under social networks or 
specialized research networks (e.g., Academia, Research 
Gate, etc.) 
In an asynchronous learning environment learners are 
encouraged to actively participate in their own learning, 
providing them the chance to cooperate with their peers, 
provide peer feedback, and reflect on their personal learning 
objectives and outcomes. Such an environment implemented 
through a discussion forum for example and associated with 
a proper reward grading system, can increase the learner’s 
motivation as well as inter-peer interaction, generating the 
basis for an intelligent dialog among peers and hence 
improving the learning outcomes [9][10].  
In a web-based client-server environment, even though 
there are many types of asynchronous applications, 
communication can be classified as: poll, push, and long-
poll [13]. If a parallel is drawn among these categories and 
the asynchronous dialogue between the tutor and learner, the 
following dialogue categories are obtained, see Figure 2: 
 
Polling, asynchronous dialogue: the learner asks to the 
tutor at regular intervals and the tutor responds with 
guiding information. Such an approach can be 
implemented for example using an e-mail system with 
the “polling” initiated by the learner. 
 
Long-polling, asynchronous dialogue: is similar with 
the first approach in that the learner is sending a 
question to the tutor however the connection is kept 
open and the tutor provides an answer when s/he has 
the 
information 
available. 
Interestingly, 
such 
asynchronous communication can be implemented 
thorough a synchronous tool (e.g., web-chat) with the 
Audio/Video-
based: 
Conferencing, 
WebCasts.

condition that, both the learner and the tutor keep the 
chat channel open for a long period of time and monitor 
it for activity. 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Three approaches: Poll, Long-Poll vs. Push Dialogue 
 
 
Push asynchronous dialogue: the learner subscribes to 
a tutor channel by sending an initial request/question 
and from that point on s/he receives answers/updates 
“pushed” by the tutor. Such a dialogue can be initiated 
through a subscription to a discussion thread in a 
discussion forum for example. 
III. 
INTELLIGENT AND ADAPTIVE DIALOGUE 
The establishment of an intelligent dialogue itself is 
fundamental, as a simple one-way communication between 
the tutor and the learner, i.e., a monologue is a one way 
communication channel that eventually requires feedback. 
Although a monologue is theoretically defined as a 
“prolonged talk or discourse by a single speaker” 
conversations between two parties who are not really 
listening to each other are, essentially, monologues 
concealed as dialogues. The intelligent, adaptive and 
automated dialogue attributes have the following meaning: 
 
Intelligent dialogue must reveal good judgment and/or 
sound thought from both the tutor and learner. 
 
Automated dialogue implies a computing algorithm 
behind the user interface generating and managing the 
dialogue (i.e., an intelligent agent) with the learner and 
augmenting or replacing temporary the real tutor. 
 
Adaptive dialogue implies that various aspects are taken 
into account (e.g., user’s background knowledge and 
progress) and the tutoring agent is able to adapt to the 
learner, obviously exhibiting a certain level of 
intelligence. 
Intelligent, automated, adaptive dialogue between a 
learner and a software tutoring agent may be implemented in 
a learning management system at different stages: 
 
Assessment: through automated grading that provides 
the learner with feedback after and assessment (quiz, 
exam, etc.) has completed. It simulates the behavior of a 
human tutor, and helps assess learners’ knowledge, 
analyzing their answers, providing feedback and 
proposing personalized training plans, mostly in an 
asynchronous context. Automated grading is cheap, 
quick and without human bias, however it has serious 
limitations 
when 
applied 
to 
essay-type 
content 
assessment [14].  
 
Content Creation: “Smart content” creation, from 
digitized guides of textbooks to customizable learning 
digital interfaces, are being introduced at all levels, from 
elementary school to corporate environments [6]. 
 
Content Delivery: intelligent tutoring systems have seen 
a tremendous amount of progress in recent years [7]. 
Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have 
enabled 
dialogue 
management 
frameworks 
like 
Artificial Intelligent Dialogue Agent (AIDA) [12]. 
 
Integration of intelligent, adaptive and automated dialogue in 
popular Learning Management Systems (LMS) (e.g., 
Docebo, Adobe Captive Prime, Desire2Learn, Moodle, 
Looop, SkillCast, etc.) is still lagging behind. Most LMSs 
improve interaction through concepts like gamification, and 
enable learner’s self-management and enhanced visualization 
of learning progress, however dialogue is pushed to the peer 
or tutor level. 
IV. 
INTELLIGENT AUTOMATED FACILITATORS 
The main purpose of an automated facilitator in an e-
Learning environment is dialogue facilitation for learning. 
Most facilitator systems rely on speech recognition and/or 
text analysis and interpretation.  
The industry has implemented a variety of natural 
language ChatBots and voice-recognition modules trough 
projects like Apple’s Siri, Google Now, Microsoft’s Cortana, 
IBM’s Watson. LMS environments like Khan Academy, 
YouTube, Coursera, Lynda, and other massive open online 
courses (MOOCs) are growing in popularity, however they 
are still lagging behind in terms of intelligent dialogue 
creation. Many of these tools suffer from the lack of the 
immediacy and motivational qualities of personal interaction 
with a human. However, the effort to improve is ongoing 
with the goal of powering the intelligent dialogue inside a 
multitude of devices and digital services (e.g., Viv labs [15]) 
along the “intelligence becomes a utility” slogan. 
Among the notable ongoing research projects in 
automated, intelligent facilitator’s development, Mika [16] 
provides learners feedback and hints based on the learners’ 
background knowledge and the learner’s problem solving 
strategy. University of Southern California Institute for 
Creative Technologies is leading for a few decades research 
efforts in delivering Virtual/Mixed Reality based intelligent 
avatars that act as facilitators for different tasks using the 
“Virtual Classroom” paradigm. The SimCoach project [17] 
for example, implements a virtual human (avatar) support 
agent that facilitates intelligent dialogue with military 
personnel and family members to seek information and 
advice related to their healthcare. Moreover they have 
expanded the avatar facilitator approach to other areas like: 
STEM education, CANVAS project [18] and PAL3 [19], a

system for delivering education materials and intelligent 
dialogue via mobile devices, to provide on-the-job training 
and support lifelong learning. 
Projects like TLE TeachLivE™ [20] , reverse the coin, 
and explore Mixed Reality classrooms with simulated 
learners that provide tutors the opportunity to develop their 
pedagogical practice through intelligent dialogue in a safe 
environment that doesn’t place real learners at risk [21]. 
European Union research efforts (e.g., iTalk2Learn [22]) 
emphasize the importance of intelligent dialogue through 
interdisciplinary projects that aggregate expertise from 
machine learning, user modeling, intelligent tutoring 
systems, educational psychology and mathematics. 
V. 
CONCLUSION   
The dialogue is an essential component of any human 
activity, and it is fundamental for any type of interaction. 
Particularly in education, its importance is amplified by the 
fact that knowledge transfer occurs in the process of social 
interaction through intelligent dialogue.  
Artificial intelligence has been “married” with 
education for more than 30 years [23]. Personalizing 
teaching, learning 21st century skills, life-long and life-wide 
learning will spawn many AI based applications, targeted at 
new forms of intelligent dialogue design and development 
involving human senses beyond audio and visual. However 
care must be taken, to train teachers on how to balance their 
competences between the new, AI driven, intelligent 
dialogue systems and the traditional class activities. 
Haptic (“tactile”) interfaces [24] and Web3D [25] have 
recently been employed in e-Learning prototypes to enhance 
intelligent dialogue as well as to widen the communication 
channel. With the rapid evolution of technology, the 3D and 
haptic sense, seem poised for immediate adoption into 
virtual facilitators, embodied like virtual humans, for 
intelligent dialogue tailored to each learner.
