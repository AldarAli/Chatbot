Abstract— Telemetry signals are widely used in order to 
control electric equipment, collect information for launching 
satellites and for testing aircraft and guided weapons. In non-
cooperative contexts, a blind estimation algorithm is essential 
to acquire data from telemetry signals. Generally, telemetry 
signals have a frame structure which consists of data words 
and a unique frame synchronization pattern. To obtain the 
telemetry 
signals 
blindly, 
we 
have 
to 
estimate 
the 
synchronization patterns in the frame structure first. In this 
paper, we propose a new algorithm for the estimation of frame 
synchronization patterns for the blind detection of telemetry 
signals and verify the proposed algorithm through computer 
simulations. By exploiting this algorithm, structures of 
unknown telemetry signals can be reconstructed. 
Keywords- detection and estimation; telemetry signal; frame 
synchronization.

 INTRODUCTION 
Telemetry signals containing data measurements made at 
distance [1] are commonly used in vehicles such as aircraft, 
missiles, automobiles, and satellites, and applied in various 
fields including space exploration, flight control, and traffic 
control systems [2]. For example, National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA), European Space Agency 
(ESA) and other space agencies have used telemetry systems 
for the collection of data from spacecraft and satellites since 
telemetry signals can contain various measurements such as 
temperature, pressure and a  radian level. Telemetry signals 
have a frame structure for transmitting each measurement as 
a single stream. Generally, the frame structure consists of 
data words and a unique synchronization pattern. Data words 
are composed of  measurements, counters, commands, or 
other information. The synchronization pattern is a unique 
sequence for identifying each minor frame. To acquire the 
telemetry signals blindly, we first have to estimate the frame 
synchronization patterns in the frame structure.  
In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the estimation 
of frame synchronization patterns for the blind detection of 
telemetry signals, and verify the proposed algorithm through 
computer simulations. With this algorithm, unknown 
telemetry signals can be reconstructed.  
II. 
FRAME STRUCTURE OF THE TELEMETRY SYSTEM 
There are various telemetry standards, such as IRIG 106, 
CCSDS 102.0-B-4, and PSS-04-106 [3-5]. Among these the  
standards, IRIG 106 is widely used in both military and 
commercial fields because it is made to ensure the 
interoperability in aeronautical telemetry application from 
Range Commanders Council [6]. In this paper we consider 
IRIG 106 as a telemetry standard in this paper.  
Telemetry signals can be classified by the method of 
modulation: Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), Frequency 
Modulation (FM), and Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM). 
Among these schemes, PCM is widely used in telemetry 
systems because it has the advantages of better accuracy, 
greater dynamic range, and less noise than other schemes. In 
Chapter 4 of  IRIG 106 standard [3], the PCM formats are 
divided into two classes, Class 1 and Class 2. Table 1 shows 
the specifications of the two classes, and Figure 1 depicts the 
frame structure of Class 1 [3].

As shown in Figure 1, the major frame structure of IRIG 
106 Class 1 consists of up to 256 minor frames. Each minor 
frame has the maximum length of 8192 bits and 1024 words, 
and each word consists of 4 to 32 bits. Note that there is a 
minor frame synchronization(sync) pattern having 16 to 33 
bits at the head or tail of each minor frame, and each minor 
frame sync pattern is also treated as a word in a minor frame. 
Table 2 shows the minor frame sync patterns of IRIG 106 
Class 1. In a major frame, each minor frame has the same 
sync pattern.

BLIND ESTIMATION OF FRAME 
SYNCHRONIZATION PATTERNS IN TELEMETRY 
SIGNALS 
The length of minor frame in IRIG 106 Class 1 is up to 
8192 bits, and one minor frame can have up to 1024 words 
with the same sync pattern at the same position. If we divide 
the unknown telemetry data sequence into data blocks 
having the estimated minor frame length of 
e
N  and load the 
data blocks to a matrix 
(
,
H M Ne )
 row by row, then we can 
make the matrix for the analysis of minor frame sync pattern 
as shown in Figure 2, where 
e
N  is an arbitrarily chosen 
minor frame length, 
p
N  is the original minor frame length, 
M is the numbers of rows in the matrix 
(
,
H M Ne )
, and s  is 
an integer.

minor frame sync pattern 
 
In Figure 2, each matrix consists of sync patterns and 
words, where shaded areas represent sync patterns, and plain 
areas represent words. As shown in Figure 2 (a), when the 
arbitrarily chosen minor frame length 
e
N  is not an integer 
multiple of the original minor frame length 
p
N , the sync 
patterns are not aligned in the same column in the matrix 
(
,
H M Ne )
. On the other hand, if  
e
N  is an integer multiple 
of 
p
N , as shown in Figure 2 (b), the sync patterns are 
aligned in the same column and the correlation between the 
rows can be seen in the matrix 
(
,
H M Ne )
. If there is an 
equal bit sequence of the length over 16 bits in every row, 
we can find a sync pattern in the unknown telemetry data 
sequence. 
Figure 3 depicts the matrix 
(
,
H M Ne )
 constructed from an 
unknown telemetry data sequence with 16 bits minor frame 
sync pattern. As shown in Figure 3, if 
e
N  is estimated to be 
the original minor frame length 
p
N , the 16 bits sync pattern 
is aligned in the same position in the matrix.

To verify the equality of column bits in the 16 bits sync 
pattern, we change the data bit representations: zeros to -1 
and one to 1 in Figure 3, and show the results in Figure 4.

In Figure 4, if we estimate the sync pattern correctly, the 
column-wise sum of all data bits in the 16 bits sync pattern 
will be M or –M. In this case, if we take an absolute value

Figure 6. Blind estimation process of the minor frame length

As shown in Figure 6, we first divide the unknown 
telemetry data sequence into data blocks of the estimated 
minor frame length 
e
N  and load the data blocks to the 
matrix 
(
,
H M Ne )
 row by row. Then we map the data bits 
onto 1 or -1. If the absolute values of the column-wise sum 
of the matrix are equal to the number of divided data blocks 
through 16 consecutive columns, we can determine that the 
sequential bits in every row as a minor frame sync pattern 
and the estimated minor frame length 
e
N  as the original 
minor frame length. 
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
For simulation of the algorithm, two telemetry data 
sequences depending on IRIG 106 Class1 are made. First 
telemetry data sequence has one major frame which consists 
of 128 minor frames. Each minor frame has the length of 
1024 bits, and minor frame sync pattern of 16 bits. Second 
telemetry data sequence has one major frame which consists 
of 128 minor frames. Here, each minor frame has the length 
of 1024 bits, and minor frame sync pattern of 24 bits. 
Figure 7 depicts a minor frame of the telemetry data 
sequence which has minor frame sync pattern of the length 
16 bits and the estimated minor frame sync pattern.

As shown in Figure 8 (b), the estimated minor frame sync 
pattern is identical to 24 bits from 20th bit to 44th bit of 
Figure 8 (a).  
If there is an error in the minor frame sync pattern, the 
proposed algorithm can be modified to estimate the original 
frame sync pattern, by introducing the threshold coefficient 
that has a real value of 0 to 1.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have presented a new blind estimation 
algorithm to find frame synchronization patterns in telemetry 
systems based on IRIG 106, using the matrix constructed 
using estimated minor frame length. By computer 
simulations, we have confirmed performance of the proposed 
algorithm. Simulations are carried out for a major frame 
consisting of 128 minor frames with 1024 bits. By exploiting 
the proposed algorithm, we estimated 16 bits long and 24 
bits long sync patterns. In error environments, we can 
estimate the frame sync pattern also by using the threshold 
coefficient α . Our results can be applied to an unknown 
telemetry signal reconstruction for various practical cases in 
non-cooperative contexts such as spectrum surveillance 
systems and guided weapon systems.
