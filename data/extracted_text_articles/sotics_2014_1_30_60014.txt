Abstract—Online systems that rely on their participants to 
provide oversight and governance face the challenge of 
assigning administrative rights to appropriate people in the 
community of users. This study examines how system tools in 
one such system, Wikipedia, support and constrain the social 
processes of administrative rights granting. Reporting on the 
results of a survey of community participants in the English 
Wikipedia “Request for Adminship” process, the study offers 
an analysis of system tools in support of a high-stakes social 
process. It discovers that the existing tools offering basic counts 
of user actions in the system are not generally perceived as 
valuable; instead, members of the community develop 
nuanced, individualized means of assessing administrative 
candidates. The study offers insights into the implications of 
tool design for self-governing online systems.  
Keywords—Wikipedia; 
administrators; 
management; 
collaboration;  system tools. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In self-governing, social contributor systems, community 
participants need processes and tools that are well integrated 
to support their administrative work. Whether the 
community is setting policy, disciplining those engaged in 
disruptive behavior, or selecting who among the community 
will have access to special system tools, integrated processes 
and tools are essential for facilitating sustainable, 
communally valued practices [1]. This integrated process-
tool complex serves as a kind of bedrock on which a 
relatively predictable set of recurring actions can occur. At 
the same time, because a social contributor system is a 
dynamic entity made up of an evolving set of people and 
embedded in a larger, changing social context, it must 
necessarily mutate to remain viable. This need for relative 
stability and openness to change presents a challenge for 
those who aspire to design viable, socially attractive 
contributor systems. 
    Wikipedia, one of the most widely hailed social 
contributor systems in the world, is a flagship effort of the 
Wikimedia movement. As a multi-language encyclopedia 
notable for its relevance to the representation of human 
knowledge, Wikipedia is also notable for its reliance on 
interested people to make it work—including such key 
contributions as writing its content, supplying images and 
sounds, ensuring editorial integrity, and adding functional 
code to improve the underlying system itself. This reliance 
on contributors further extends to the selection of individuals 
who will be granted access to administrative tools that enable 
and sustain the system. In Wikipedia, such individuals are 
designated 
as 
administrators, or 
admins. Wikipedia 
administrators have access to tools and features that help 
them execute their maintenance responsibilities, such as the 
ability to block user accounts, to restore deleted pages, and 
to hide page revisions from standard users. (For a 
comprehensive list of administrator tools and capabilities in 
Wikipedia, see details at [2].)    
A. The Administrator Promotion Process in Wikipedia 
Within Wikipedia, Requests for Adminship (RfA) are 
handled via a formalized process by which editors determine 
who will become administrators. All registered editors in the 
community can potentially be involved by nominating users 
whom they see fit for the administrator role. Subsequently, 
all registered editors can potentially comment on and render 
an opinion about nominees to help decide who is a suitable 
candidate for an administrator role. This open process is 
exposed to the community with all transactions appearing on 
a wiki page. Prior research about the viability of this 
community-driven process [3] has identified a degree of 
urgency in developing a better understanding of the 
administrator promotion process because of the system’s 
need for more administrative help.   
When participating in the RfA deliberation process, 
Wikipedia editors may use whatever means the community 
will allow to make their assessment. A resource available to 
them is a set of guidelines published on the wiki, which  
provides some sense of appropriate means for evaluating 
whether candidates are experienced, active, responsible, 
interactive, and can be trusted to uphold Wikipedia policies. 
These and other characteristics are listed in the Wikipedia 
Guide to RfA, which is available on the wiki at [4]. Further, 
for each case presented to the community for consideration, a 
set of nominee-relevant exploration tools is presented via 
links on the nomination page.  
The RfA guidelines and the tools presented to 
participants in the process—like many other aspects of 
Wikipedia—have largely emerged from the joint efforts of 
editors working together. The guidelines, consequently, do 
not stipulate official or mandatory requirements to becoming 
an administrator. Instead, the guidelines offer community-
derived general advice for nominees and nominators as well 
as a description of the nomination process. Likewise, the 
15

nominee-specific tools presented with each RfA case are 
offered by members of the community invested in the 
process, but open to the involvement of others. Reflecting 
the priorities of those community members who have 
invested work in the process, both these guidelines and the 
nominee exploration tools embed a set of values. The 
guidelines and tools are tightly connected to characteristics 
and factors that RfA contributors hope to see (and hope not 
to see) in a candidate. This process of human defined values 
becoming embedded in system code is a phenomenon of 
interest to researchers in Science and Technology Studies 
generally, but within Wikipedia specifically, it has been 
studied by such researchers as [5].  
Our study advances this line of inquiry by investigating 
the relationships between the values embedded in the 
guidelines and tools and the actual work of editors 
participating in the RfA process. Through this investigation, 
we seek to discover the relationship between values in 
structural elements of the system (guidelines and tools) and 
the work that is conducted with and around them. Our work 
has potential value, then, for not only understanding a 
mechanism of self-governance in Wikipedia, but potentially 
also for understanding other systems that rely on their 
communities of users to develop community-governed 
policies to support collaborative action [6]. Researchers who 
are motivated to understand the dynamics of online elective 
processes like RfA [7], for example, would potentially 
benefit from our study. 
Prior work examining the RfA process within Wikipedia 
has addressed several concerns, most of which are indirectly 
related to the present study. For example, Burke and Kraut 
[8] propose models of behavior based on the outcome of 
nomination cases. Another study [9] employs social network 
analysis techniques to examine the effects of relationships 
among people on their decision patterns when participating 
in RfA. A third study [10] examines the editing histories of 
administrators and analyzes them in relationship to voting 
patterns in the RfA process. A final study [11] uses 
interviews to identify sensemaking practices of participants 
in the RfA process and to consider the design of a 
visualization tool to support such work. Our work 
complements these previous studies, examining the thoughts 
and experiences of RfA participants and connecting them to 
the general affordances of the tools readily available to 
support 
community 
deliberation 
about 
administrator 
candidates.  
In the paper that follows, we describe our means of 
understanding the social, tool-mediated process by which 
Wikipedians select community members to be elevated to 
administrative status (see Section II), examine the values that 
such members use to guide their opinions (see Section III), 
consider how the tools support such opinion development 
(see Section IV), and then, conclude with suggestions about 
designing for such contexts (see Section V). 
II. 
METHOD 
Our study employs survey and system analysis 
techniques to identify the relationship between community  
 
practices and values and the primary tools present in the 
context of RfA work. It is worth noting that our work 
focuses specifically on practices, values, and tools in the 
English Wikipedia, which is the largest instance of 
Wikipedia. Additional investigations of RfA in other 
language wikis (e.g., [10]) would be appropriate to determine 
if our results correspond to relationships and tool use in other 
language wikis.  
A. Design of the Survey 
We designed and offered an online survey of editors to 
study the RfA practices and values of active Wikipedians. 
Participants were solicited from within Wikipedia itself on 
pages and related forums on which editors involved in the 
RfA process were likely to notice the invitation (e.g., 
Wikipedia pages, such as the RfA talk page, the Village 
Pump Miscellaneous page, and various related Internet Relay 
Chat (IRC) channels). Additionally, Kudpung, a Wikipedia 
Online Ambassador and administrator, re-posted our 
invitation on the RfA Reform page within Wikipedia (see 
[12]), noting that WMF founder Jimbo Wales had recently 
expressed a firm desire to see more data driven contributions 
to proposals for RfA reform. 
The survey asked participants a mix of questions, 
including demographic characteristics, opinions about the 
process, frequency with which they used tools from the 
RfA toolbox, and what characteristics they value most when 
evaluating an administrator candidate.  
The survey was open for one month, during which 
61 Wikipedians responded.  
B. Data Analysis 
To analyze the responses of our participants, we 
considered the characteristics they identified as important in 
their consideration of RfA nominees and the tools present in 
the process that they reported using.  We then used their 
expressions about their deliberation practices to understand 
how they considered these characteristics and tools. 
 
1) Valued Characteristics 
Survey participants provided information about the 
characteristics they value in nominees in response to 
questions about (1) the normal evaluation practices, and (2) 
descriptions of what they look for when assessing a nominee. 
We then analyzed these responses to determine the 
frequency with which nominee characteristics were 
identified as valued. To categorize these responses, we used 
Wikipedia’s Guide to RfA to group characteristics users 
hope to see in a candidate. As shown in Table II, we created 
one subcategory that lists the exact characteristics described 
in Wikipedia’s Guide to the RfA, and one subcategory that 
lists additional characteristics participants mentioned in their 
responses that closely relate to those described in the guide. 
We made a count every time a participant mentioned one of 
the listed characteristics in their responses. In addition to 
these characteristics, we created a separate table (Table III) 
that lists characteristics participants collectively mentioned 
that do not relate to the categories in the guide to the RfA.

2) Tools 
We analyzed tools presented to RfA participants in the 
RfA toolbox (see Figure 1 for an example) to see if there 
were 
direct 
or 
indirect 
relationships 
between 
the 
functionalities of the tools and characteristics users would 
like to see in an administrator candidate. For every 
characteristic (presented later in Table IV), we determined if 
there are tools that could assist in researching if a candidate 
possesses such a characteristic.  
 
 
 
Figure 1. A set of tools presented to editors considering an RfA case. In this 
instance, the nominee is Go Phightins! An active version of this tool may be 
accessed here [13].  
 
In these automatically generated tool boxes, participants 
in the RfA process are presented with links to the candidate’s 
user page and user talk page, as well as links that yield basic 
data about the candidate’s prior system actions. These count 
links include a log of diffs committed by the editor over 
time, a count of edits over time, a list of instances in which 
the candidate’s account was blocked administratively, a 
count of the number of times the editor was involved in an 
arbitration process, and a count of the number of times the 
candidate’s account was flagged for investigation based on a 
request of another editor. Additionally, much of this type of 
data can be accessed via an “editing statistics” link to a talk 
page associated with the candidate’s nomination.     
III. 
RESULTS 
Our 61 participants included three types of Wikipedians: 
 
 
31 registered editors 
 
29 administrators 
 
1 bureaucrat 
 
Registered editors include those users who have created 
an account within Wikipedia (as opposed to those who edit 
anonymously). Administrators are editors who have been 
selected to have elevated systems permissions. Bureaucrats 
are those with system permissions to add and remove 
administrators. At the time of the survey, there were 
approximately 22,100,000 registered editor accounts, 14,000 
administrators, and 35 bureaucrat accounts.  (For more detail 
about the overall population of Wikipedians and their unique 
roles in the work and maintenance of the system, see [14]). 
All participants in our survey expressed opinions about 
the RfA process, and nearly all were regular contributors to 
such deliberations (Table I). Among the survey participants, 
20% reported that they participated in nearly every RfA case.

Survey participants were asked an open question about 
what they looked for when they considered a nominee: “In a 
few sentences, please describe what characteristics of an RfA 
candidate are most important to you as you evaluate him or 
her and why.” Participants offered responses of varying 
lengths. All responses were analyzed to extract a list of 
characteristics, and all characteristics were included in the 
final list. This list was then transformed into a regular list of 
common characteristics and counts of occurrence, as 
indicated in Table II. Some of these categories matched the 
characteristics mentioned in the RfA Guidelines and others 
were identified as closely associated.

Beyond those characteristics that matched or were 
closely aligned with characteristics from the RfA guidelines, 
our participants also identified others (Table III). These 
unique responses include such things as the nominee having 
an insider perspective (e.g., being “clued” in) and personal 
histories of interaction (e.g., knowing something about the 
individual because we have encountered each other while 
editing).

Given the characteristics identified by our survey 
participants, we then considered how closely they were 
aligned with the tools presented in RfA cases. As expected, 
some of the nominee characteristics that the community is 
encouraged to consider are discoverable in the toolbox (see 
Table IV). Notably, some of the characteristics are supported 
by multiple tools. For example, eight of the tools in the 
toolbox would allow an RfA participant to make an 
assessment about the strength of a nominee’s editing history. 
When considered in this framework, it became evident that 
the tools offered to the community are based on editor 
characteristics that are relatively simple and easy to represent 
as a count number. Notable then, too, is the fact that not all 
the suggested character attributes can be discovered with a 
tool. These characteristics are things that are not readily 
countable 
(e.g., 
trustworthiness 
and 
helpfulness). 
Additionally, none of the unique (non-guideline based) 
characteristics identified as important by our participants 
were discoverable via an offered tool.  
The lack of tool support for reasoning about a nominee’s 
characteristics, presented in a way that the community 
values, may indicate an opportunity for design enhancements 
to the RfA toolbox. Such opportunity, however, merits 
careful consideration. Additional input from our survey 
participants (discussed in the following section) offers a 
more complex picture of how tools are connected to the 
practices of RfA participants thinking through the 
characteristics they value and how an individual nominee 
exhibits those characteristics.

DISCUSSION 
Wikipedians are invested in the process of selecting high-
quality administrators from their ranks. As the process is 
now realized in the community, many tools (e.g., guidelines, 
essays, link-based count logs) have been developed to 
support this work. As representative voices from the 
community, our survey participants provide a sense of the 
nuanced and largely invisible aspects of the process-tool 
complex involved. As one participant explains,  
 
“The reality is that adminship is oriented to communal trust 
and confidence, not percentages and numbers, and each 
user will have their own way to assess candidates' readiness 
for the role.” 
 
As expressed here, among all the participants, there is 
some disbelief that tools based on automated counts can 
represent all the qualities of interactions and edits that are 
worth consideration. The implicit implication of these 
comments is that humans must judge candidates based on 
their reading/sensemaking about candidate behavior. 
A. Patterns of Consideration Used  
Although we see evidence among participant responses 
that each user has “their own way” of thinking about 
nominees, we note that these ways can broadly be organized 
into two categories based on the intensity of consideration. 
18
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2014.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-372-8
SOTICS 2014 : The Fourth International Conference on Social Eco-Informatics

Some participants describe a “systematic” investigation 
approach to considering nominees. These people explore a 
wide range of participation examples by methodically 
looking through the places where the candidate has edited. 
These people also look systematically at the exchanges the 
candidate has had with others. They specifically consider the 
user’s page and corresponding user_talk page (the primary 
on-wiki spaces used for direct communication between two 
or more editors) and those pages' revision histories. These 
systematic users explore deeply and would seem to be 
spending considerable time in their exploration.  
Other survey participants describe a comparatively 
shallow form of exploration. These users make general 
comments pointing out that there are other users who are 
likely to do a deep exploration and that any glaring flaws 
would likely be found by those others. Thus, these shallow 
explorers feel that they only need to look at a small number 
of issues which they care about. In these cases, there is not 
one thing that they consider as a group, but in general they 
are not looking widely. They tend to mention using the RfA 
comments posted by previous participants in the deliberation 
to help make their determination, before looking at one or 
two other items to render their opinion.  
B. Considerations Beyond Those Represented in Tools 
Regardless of how intensely and by what means the 
survey participants considered nominees, factors they 
considered extended beyond those that could be explored 
through existing tools.  These factors were diverse, as 
suggested in the quotes that follow. 
 
1) Breadth of Knowledge 
Participants cared about how a nominee demonstrated 
potential for thinking broadly. All nominees are specialists in 
certain topical content areas and/or types of work within 
Wikipedia, but a good nominee needed to show potential 
beyond those areas of specialization. A participant explained 
they wanted to see a “breadth and depth of knowledge of 
policies and guidelines, not simply being able to regurgitate 
sentences from policy pages.” Another participant expanded 
on this idea: “For me, a user must be competent and well 
aware of things that are going on on the wiki, not only in the 
area in which they wish to work (although this is most 
important).” 
A third participant offered a slightly different take on this 
expectation for breadth of knowledge. In particular, this 
participant wanted nominees to demonstrate an appreciation 
for the diverse work of Wikipedians. Such an appreciation is 
deemed necessary because of the power that a confirmed 
nominee would hold upon becoming an administrator:  
 
“Candidates don't have to be prolific content contributors, 
but they must show that they know all the content basics and 
can work effectively with experienced content editors. The 
‘janitor’ metaphor is misleading: a janitor can’t tear up 
your homework and ban you from school, but an admin 
can.” 
2) Bravery 
Paired with this concern about desiring admins who 
appreciated a breadth of experiences was a desire to identify 
nominees who would not shrink away from the necessary 
hard decisions an administrator must perform. In short, the 
community values an administrator who will step up and do 
difficult things. As a survey participant explained, an ideal 
nominee is “not afraid to step on a few toes to do their job as 
an admin.” 
 
3) Social Adeptness 
A valued consideration among survey participants was 
the sociability of nominees. Sociability included many 
dimensions. For example, it is related to social trust: 
“Probably the main question I ask overall is ‘Can I trust the 
candidate?’” Sociability is also related to moderate behavior 
in the face of heated debate. A survey participant explains, 
“A calmness and maturity that means the editor is generally a 
moderating influence in contentious or heated circumstances. 
This does not just apply to editors who can become uncivil in 
conflict, but also those who are naive and lack tact and 
sensitivity.” For some survey participants, social adeptness 
was something that could best (and perhaps only) be judged 
by prior intimate interactions: “Generally I comment only on 
the RfAs of users I’ve interacted with, positively or 
negatively, and base my position on that.” 
 
4) Fitness as a Representative 
Finally, survey participants weighed how well a 
candidate would represent the overall community. A survey 
participant explained that when considering a nominee, they 
thought about “whether the candidate will be a good 
spokesperson; admins are on a pedestal to some degree; they 
have the illusion of authority. As such, they should represent 
the project well to new editors, etc.” Related to this, there 
was concern for finding good representatives of the diversity 
of the community: “For Wikipedia to be ‘the free 
encyclopedia that anyone can edit,’ all demographics should 
be welcomed.” 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
As this study demonstrates, the means by which users of 
a large contributor system engage in the difficult work of 
self-governance are complex [15]. To ensure that the best 
possible users are elevated to the status of administrators, 
people create and participate in an integrated tool-process set 
of activities through which they endeavor to discover 
administrator candidates who exhibit characteristics they 
value. As the operators of such a contributor system consider 
options to better support the work of the community, they 
would ideally consider such integrated tool-process 
activities.  
Design considerations for future versions of such systems 
should include a rich model of the socio-technical aspects of 
sustainable community-driven collaborative work. Our study 
offers some initial basis for thinking through such design 
work in the future.

Following the results of our survey, the design of the RfA 
experience could be modified to better align tools with the 
needs of the community. This redesign would include the 
expansion of the tool set to be more than a collection of basic 
counters. It would be desirable, for example, to offer tools 
that could be configured by users to represent more complex 
patterns of counts that correspond to the kinds of patterns 
that many RfA participants seek out. Such configurability is 
technically feasible, drawing on the techniques of end user 
configuration used in other social media sites. Beyond 
supporting configurations of basic counts, it would be 
possible to allow users to weight such counts, which 
addresses some of the nuanced judgments that survey 
participants reported as part of their typical RfA work. 
Beyond supporting more complex, configurable views of 
counts, a redesigned system might also include new 
measures of candidate behaviors that are not currently 
available. Our examination of how existing tools support 
valued administrator characteristics as expressed in the RfA 
Guidelines yielded a set of characteristics not explorable 
based on simple edit counts. With the development of more 
sophisticated data mining and interpretation techniques, 
however, it seems feasible that some insight into these 
valued characteristics might be possible. For example, it 
would not be too difficult to classify previous user 
contributions to expose how frequently a candidate has 
engaged in actions that the community values as “chores” or 
has conducted work that is perceived as high quality. 
Additionally, textual analysis software could be used to 
characterize how individuals participate on talk pages which 
could help others to understand the social adeptness of a 
candidate with whom they had not yet interacted. 
Drawing on the expressed needs of the community (both 
through this survey and beyond), it seems reasonable that the 
community of editors in Wikipedia could be better supported 
in the social discovery of valued administrators to conduct 
important and much needed work in the system.
