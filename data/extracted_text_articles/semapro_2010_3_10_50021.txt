Abstract—The success of Web 2.0 has generated many
interesting and challenging problems as the discovering of
social interests shared by groups of users. The main problem
consists on discovering and representing the interest of the
users. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy based algorithm that
improves the Internet Social Interest Discovery algorithm. This
algorithm discovers the common user interests and clusters
users and their saved resources by different interest topics.
The collaborative nature of social network systems and their
ﬂexibility for tagging, produce frequently multiple variations
of a same tag. We group syntactic variations of tags using a
similarity measure improving the quality of the results provided
by the Internet Social Interest Discovery algorithm.
Keywords-Social interest discovering, syntactic variations,
collaborative tagging systems
I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, one of the problems of social networks in
Web 2.0 is the discovering of common interests shared by
user communities. Users of a community use to have same
interests. In this sense, social communities growth is limited
by the deﬁnition of scalable and well adapted communities
to user interests.
The discovering of social interests shared by groups of
users can be focused following three different approaches.
The user-centric approach focuses on detecting social inter-
ests based on the social connectivity among users [1], [2].
Those works analyse user’s social or on-line connections
to discover users with particular interests or expertise for a
given user. Recent works, as [3], [4] represent the three types
of entities that exist in a social tagging system (users, items
and tags) by a 3-order tensor, on which latent semantic anal-
ysis and dimensionality reduction is performed using both
the Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD)
method and the Kernel-SVD smoothing technique. In the
object-centric approach, [5], [6] explored the common inter-
est among user based on common objects they fetched in
peer-to-peer networks. However, without other information
of the objects, it cannot differentiate the various social
interests on the same object. Furthermore, in Internet social
networks such as del.icio.us, most of objects are unpopular.
Thus, it is difﬁcult to discover common interest of users on
them [7]. The tag-centric [7], [8], [9] approach focuses on
directly detecting social interests or topics analysing user
annotations. This approach avoids the limitation of object-
centric approach [7]. In [10], a tag-centric approach is used
to provide semantic resource classiﬁcation.
Tagging techniques have been widely used in many dif-
ferent social networks. As introduced in [8], the proportion
of frequencies of tags within a given site tend to stabilize
with time (due to the collaborative tagging by all users).
Furthermore, the distribution of frequency of tags for popular
sites follows the power law as proved in [11]. This reinforces
the need to discover the interests of users since although
they use automatic tagging systems, they do so using an
uncontrolled vocabulary.
Resource classiﬁcation can be performed by using cluster-
ing techniques using both keywords [12] and tags [7], [10],
[13]. An internet social discovery system (ISID) is developed
in [7], which cluster users and their saved URLs based
on their annotations. Although users may have different
interests for an item (and items may have multiple facets)
the fact is that tags implicitly describe the users’ interests.
We discover common interest shared by groups of users in
social networks by utilizing user tags. Our approach is based
on the insightful study and observation on the user generated
tags in social networks systems such as del.icio.us [7]. As
users annotate resources, the occurrence of common tags
reinforce their common interests.
A same resource can receive different tag annotations
from different users; then we consider that a resource has
converged when its distribution of tags converges rapidly
to a remarkably stable heavy-tailed distribution. Although
an increase on the number of annotations also includes
an increase on the number of different tags involved in
the annotation process, we can observe that most of users
agree on the more relevant tags. Those tags are used in
a great number of annotations, and by a great number of
users. So, a quantiﬁcation of this agreement degree aids to
deﬁne a certain threshold in charge of identifying resource
convergence. The set of aggregated user tags on a resource
is quite compact and stable enough to characterize the same
main resource.
One of the main problems of the tag-centric approach
is the existence of a high number of syntactic variations
(erroneous or not) of other existing tags. A pre-ﬁltering of
the tags, as occurs in [14] where the Levenshtein similarity

measure is used to reduce the number of tags (identifying
syntactic variations), allows increasing the quality of tag
clustering minimizing the effects of syntactic variations. In
previous works, we proved that the utilization of a fuzzy
algorithm (FAε) [13] provides best classiﬁcation results
than the obtained when using classical distances as the
Levenshtein and Hamming distances; and in [15], we im-
proved those results adding a semantic measure (cosine) to
the fuzzy automaton. Cosine similarity, traditionally used in
information retrieval [16], measures the similarity between
a couple of vectors of n dimensions by ﬁnding the cosine
of the angle between them. The semantic similarity is
obtained comparing the vectorial representation of a couple
of terms. In this paper, we present the Fuzzy based Internet
Social Discovery algorithm (Fb-ISID), which increases the
discovery results provided by ISID [7] by using the fuzzy
automaton with ε-moves in conjunction with the cosine
similarity to remove the syntactic variations of tags on a
folksonomy (tag cleaning). The good results obtained show
the convenience of re-clustering the tags in order to remove
the syntactic variation of tags. The tags containing syntactic
variations are clustered in their representative tags preserving
their semantic information and reinforcing the tag relevance
in the whole set of tags.
The tag cleaning process improves the interest discovering
results obtained. Finally, we consider that the appliance
of a tag cleaning process must be performed for all the
algorithms, which use the related tag-centric approach.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec-
tion II describes the Fb-ISID algorithm; Section III describes
the experimental results obtained; and ﬁnally, conclusions,
acknowledgements and bibliographical references end the
paper.
II. Fb-ISID DESCRIPTION
In order to deal with the large amount of syntactic
variations of tags usually existent in folksonomies, we
present the Fuzzy based-ISID (Fb-ISID) method. Fb-ISID
is based on the pre-ﬁltering of the posts with the aim of
increasing the interest discovering results obtained by ISID.
For such purpose, Fb-ISID clusters the syntactic variations
of tags reducing the entropy of the posts by means of the
fuzzy and cosine similarity measures above described. Fb-
ISID improves the search of topics of interest against ISID
introducing a new component Syntactic Variations which is
in charge of the elimination of syntactic variations on tag-
centric systems. This section is devoted to describe the com-
ponents of the Fb-ISID algorithm. The main characteristic of
Fb-ISID consists on the introduction of a component, called
SyntacticVariation, which avoids the syntactic variations of
the posts.
The Fb-ISID architecture provides functions as ﬁnding
topics of interests, resource clustering, and topics of interest
indexing.
1) Finding topics of interest. For a given set of bookmark
post (Bookmark Post is a social bookmarking site
alowwing users to submit their blog post and other
stories to share with others and make them popular),
ﬁnd all topics of interest. Each topic of interests is
a set of tags with the number of their co-occurrences
exceeding a given threshold. Those sets of tags, which
do not reach this threshold do not give rise to a new
topic of interests;
2) Clustering. For each topics of interests, ﬁnd the URLs
and the users such that those users have labelled each
of the URLs with all the tags in the topic. For each
topic, a user cluster and a URL cluster are generated;
3) Indexing. Import the topics of interests and their user
and URL clusters into an indexing system for applica-
tion queries.
The components of this architecture are: DATASOURCE,
SYNTACTICVARIATION, TOPICDISCOVERY, CLUSTERING
and INDEXING.
1) DataSource: Fb-ISID inputs are users’ posts obtained
from social networks as a stream of posts p =
(user,URL, tags), where the combination of user and
URL uniquely identiﬁes a post p, and tags is the set
of tags that the user uses to label the referred URL.
2) SyntacticVariation: the discriminator included in this
component is in charge of grouping syntactic vari-
ations of tags. It computes the fuzzy similarity and
the cosine measures among the observed tag and the
set of already existing tags (stored in a dictionary)
in order to discover syntactic variations of tags. The
dictionary includes all the tags that have been used
by users in their annotations provided that they are
not syntactic variations of other pre-existing tags. The
occurrence of a new tag not included in the dictionary
implies a clustering process. The identiﬁcation of a
tag as a syntactic variation of an existing tag by the
discriminator, implies the assignation of a new tag
to the cluster whose cluster-head is the pattern tag
with the higher similarity value (pattern). According
to the tag lengths, the discriminator calculates the
fuzzy similarity or both fuzzy and cosine similarities.
Three thresholds Th1, Th2 and Th3, which represent
the tag length threshold, the fuzzy similarity threshold
and the cosine threshold, respectively, are considered.
Whenever the tag length is greater than Th1, the
discriminator uses the fuzzy similarity measure for
the tag clustering process. In other case, the cosine
measure is also considered by the discriminator in
conjunction with the fuzzy similarity measure. If both,
fuzzy and cosine measures provided values greater
than Th1 and Th2 respectively, then the discriminator
identiﬁes the tag as a variation of a certain pattern tag,
and performs the tag clustering according to this result.

When fuzzy and cosine measures do not agree (values
lower than thresholds) the discriminator includes the
tag in the dictionary.
3) TopicDiscovery: this component is in charge of ﬁnding
the frequent tag patterns for a given set of post. Fb-
ISID uses association rules algorithms to identify the
frequent tag patterns for the post.
4) Clustering: this component collects the posts that con-
tain the tag set (topic), inserting into two collections
of clusters (identiﬁed by topics) the resources (URLs)
and the users of the posts. Its main problem is its
complexity, since the algorithm used matches each
topic against each post. Then, for a set of n tags, there
are 2n possible topics to check. In order to reduce this
complexity, we build a preﬁx tree over the merged
topics. The clustering algorithm for a given set T of
topics and a given set P of post is described in Fig. 1.
5) Indexing: this component provides some simple query
services for applications:
• For a given topic, listing all URLs that contain
this topic.
• For a given topic, listing all users that are inter-
ested in this topic.
• For given tags, listing all topics containing the
tags.
• For a given URL, listing all topics that are con-
cerned this URL.
• For a given URL, and a topic, listing all users
that are interested in this topic and have saved
the URL.

Figure 2 illustrates the Fb-ISID architecture, where the
Syntactic variations function is added to the ISID archi-
tecture. The posts obtained by DataSource are processed
by SyntacticVariation, which clusters the posts avoiding the
syntactic variations of tags. The resultant posts (Posts’) are
then processed by TopicDiscovery, which provides the topics
of interest. The Clustering component clusters these topics
and provide the results to the Indexing component.
In [13] we proposed a method to group syntactic vari-
ations of tags using pattern matching techniques. The aim

Fb-ISID architecture.
is to cluster in a single centroid all the tags that can be
considered as a syntactic variation of a given tag. This
centroid represents all the tags included in this cluster, which
are syntactic variations of it. In particular, the proposed
fuzzy similarity measure (a fuzzy automaton with ε-moves,
FAε) offers better classiﬁcation results than other classic
techniques (Hamming and Levenshtein measures) after com-
paring them over a large real dataset. The identiﬁcation
of syntactic variations depends on the length of the tags.
Similarity measures perform well for tag lengths equal or
greater than ﬁve symbols, providing poor results in other
cases. In [15] we proposed an hybrid method which adds
to the related fuzzy similarity measures a cosine measure in
order to improve the clustering process when dealing with
short length tags. The use of both cosine and fuzzy similarity
measures ensures recognition rates greater than 95% over
datasets including large and small length tags. Results have
been validated by experts outside the project. By adding
the cosine similarity, the tag clustering performed ensures a
higher semantic clustering.

Syntactic variation discovering.
The discriminator used to cluster syntactic variations of
tags (see Figure 3) computes the fuzzy similarity and the co-
sine measures among the observed tag and the set of already
existing tags (stored in a dictionary) in order to discover
syntactic variations of tags. The occurrence of a new tag
not included in the dictionary implies a clustering process.
The identiﬁcation of a tag as a syntactic variation of an
existing tag by the discriminator, implies the assignation of

a new tag to the cluster whose cluster-head is the pattern tag
with the higher similarity value (pattern). The discriminator
uses the fuzzy similarity or the fuzzy and cosine similarities
according to the tag length. Three thresholds Th1, Th2 and
Th3, which represent the tag length threshold, the fuzzy
similarity threshold and the cosine threshold, respectively,
are considered. Whenever the tag length is greater than Th1,
the discriminator uses the fuzzy similarity measure for the
tag clustering process. In other case, the cosine measure is
also considered by the discriminator in conjunction with the
fuzzy similarity measure. If both, fuzzy and cosine measures
provided values greater than Th1 and Th2 respectively, then
the discriminator identiﬁes the tag as a variation of a certain
pattern tag, and performs the tag clustering according to this
result. When fuzzy and cosine measures do not agree (values
lower than thresholds) the discriminator includes the tag in
the dictionary.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The comparison between Fb-ISID and ISID is performed
implementing all the components of both algorithms follow-
ing the same process and the same presentation of the results
than those of [7].
For such purpose, we have retrieved web pages annotated
by users from Del.icio.us using its Recent Bookmarks page.
We consider those resources bookmarked by at least 250
users, storing the URL of those resources. Information has
been retrieved during the period from 1-15 March, 2010. A
total amount of 419,891 resources, with 2,296,300 annota-
tions, 197,148 users and 156,897 tags have been obtained.
We have randomly generated some subsets of posts from a
total amount of 779,674 posts. Table I shows the number of
tags, users and resources (URLs) for each subset of posts.
For example, the subset containing 100,000 posts refers
to 36,603 different tags, 44,051 different users and 72,567
different resources. Repetitions are not considered.

tions (4.31% of the 779,674 posts) with a recognition rate of
the 96.97%, which has been veriﬁed manually with the aid

of the syntactic variations of tags.
Table III shows the number of subsets generated by
both algorithms. It can be seen that the number of tag
subsets generated by Fb-ISID is lower than the number of
tag subsets generated by ISID. We observe how Fb-ISID
(347,985,324) obtains a 24.10% less of subset tags than ISID
(458,452,178). The suppression of syntactic tag variations
causes the clustering of those concepts scattered in many
different terms. That allows the apparition of new topics
of interest since the new subset of tags reach the threshold
required to become a topic of interest.

One can note that Fb-ISID provides best classiﬁcation
results when grouping results by topic, while classiﬁcation
results remain unchanged when only considering User and
URL clustering.
The topic blog and the URL http://animoto.com are used
to build the following basic queries:
1) For the topic blog, list all the URLs associated with
the tag blog.
2) For the topic blog, list all users that are interested in
this topic.
3) For tag blog, list all topics containing the tag blog.
4) For the URL http://animoto.com, list all the topics
containing the resource animoto.
5) For the URL http://animoto.com and the topic blog,
list all the users interested in the topic blog that have
saved the URL animoto.
Table V shows the results obtained for the subsets of posts,
namely URLs, Users and Topics for blog, and Topics and
Users for http://animoto.com. The results obtained show that
Fb-ISID:
a) obtains a 25,73% of URLs containing the topic blog;
b) increases the number of users interested in blog
(29,05%);
c) increases
the
number
of
topics
containing
blog
(11,52%);
d) increases the number of topics that are related to
http://animoto.com (4,10%);
e) increases the number of users interested in blog, which
use http://animoto.com (23,44%).
Fig. 4 shows that Fb-ISID provides best results for the
number of URLs and Users related with the topic blog for
each of the post sets.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have introduced a new algorithm, named
Fb-ISID, for the discovering of the interest of users in
collaborative tag-based systems. The experiments performed
show that Fb-ISID obtains better results than the ISID
algorithm. This good behaviour is due to the fact that the
architecture of Fb-ISID contains one component not included
in ISID. This component ﬁlters or groups together syntactic
variations of the tags contained in the initial posts. In this
way, Fb-ISID obtains more topics of interests and performs
basic queries more efﬁciently than ISID. Finally, we consider
that the clustering of syntactic variation in the data sources
of social systems, improves the performance of algorithms
for interests discovery, based on tag-centric approaches.
