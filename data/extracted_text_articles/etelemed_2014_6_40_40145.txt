Abstract—Personal Health Records allow patients to maintain 
their own health information and are viewed as an important 
tool for patient self-management. However, uptake of these 
systems has been hindered by the large burden placed on 
patients to record information or to arrange for information to 
be transferred from other clinical systems. The favored option 
of transferring information from other systems is hindered by 
a lack of semantic and syntactic interoperability between 
Personal and Electronic Health Record systems. In this 
position paper, we describe the ongoing development of an 
information model that uses an ontology to ensure semantic 
integrity between concepts recorded by both types of record 
systems, and HL7 standards to maintain equivalent structure 
and function.  The information model acts as a middle layer 
between record systems and thus is not tied to any specific 
Personal and Electronic Health Record implementation.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Personal Health Records (PHRs) provide a summary of 
an individual's medical history and allow patients to view 
and edit their own medical data [1]. The aim of PHRs is to 
encourage patients to become more involved and informed 
as equal partners in their care, making positive choices to 
improve or maintain their health. Further, due to the 
increasing prevalence of long term conditions, patients’ 
involvement in their care is viewed as potentially cost 
saving, and as such PHRs have become a strategic priority. 
For example, in the USA most Americans will have access to 
a PHR by 2014 if present Federal goals are accomplished 
[3], and Australia’s 2011 budget mandated PHRs for all 
Australians to be achieved within 2 years [4]. However, 
despite much investment, adoption rates for PHRs remain 
low with causes such as lack of awareness, interoperability, 
and privacy and security concerns widely cited [5]. Although 
these 
are 
all 
important 
concerns, 
in 
particular, 
interoperability has been identified as a major barrier and in 
this research we focus on proposing a novel solution for 
PHR interoperability. 
There are two prevailing models of PHR - “tethered” 
systems, which are sponsored by an organization and where 
the record is automatically populated without the patient 
needing to enter information, and “untethered” standalone 
systems which are entirely under the control of the patient 
who must enter their own information or arrange for it to be 
transferred from another system. As the majority of PHRs 
are untethered, the success of these systems is determined by 
a person’s willingness to maintain their PHR information or 
on their health providers’ willingness to share data from the 
patient’s Electronic Health Record (EHR) so that it can be 
transferred to the PHR.  
Although the tethered approach places fewer burdens on 
the patient it presents challenges for healthcare providers.  
The development of tethered PHRs usually involves the 
costly process of exposing selected parts of an organization’s 
EHR to the patient by reprogramming or ‘retrofitting’ 
proprietary EHRs for purposes they were not originally 
intended [6]. As a result many tethered PHRs focus on 
providing simpler data to patients, for example, hospital 
visits or prescription drugs dispensed, rather than clinical 
data which requires gathering fragmentary information from 
multiple resources but which is necessary if patients are to be 
encouraged to self-manage in a meaningful way.  
The aim of our research is to develop a framework to 
enable seamless interoperability between PHRs and EHRs in 
order to allow meaningful exchange of clinical data from 
providers to patients and vice versa in order to better 
encourage PHR use and patient self-management. The 
solution is equally applicable to tethered and untethered 
systems as it abstracts away from the specific PHR and EHR 
using an ontology-driven Information Model (IM) based on 
the HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM) that acts as a 
middleware layer between PHR and EHR systems.  In this 
position paper we provide a description of the proposed IM 
for transferring information in a standardized way between 
EHR and PHR systems. In the next section we provide 
describe recent work on PHR interoperability. Section III 
describes the methods used to develop the middleware layer 
between EHR and PHR. Section IV presents a discussion 
and finally in Section V we outline some future work.  
II. 
BACKGROUND 
Our research proposes the use of an ontology-driven IM 
to address issues of semantic and syntactic interoperability 
between PHR and EHR systems. An IM is a representation 
of concepts and the relationships, constraints, rules, and 
operations that might be applied to these concepts for a 
particular problem space [7]. “An ontology is an explicit 
specification of a conceptualization” [8] and used to formally 
represent domain knowledge. Syntactic interoperability 
refers to the capability of communicating and exchanging 
data whereas semantic interoperability is the ability of 
systems to meaningfully interpret information exchanged.

Recent work by Puustjärvi [9] focused on achieving 
semantic interoperability by developing a specific ontology 
for active PHRs. We borrow from this work but extend it to 
include syntactic interoperability using Health Level 7 (HL7) 
standards for data and document exchange [10]. Other 
research using HL7 standards for PHR interoperability has 
focused on messaging rather than full document exchange 
[11, 12]. In order to facilitate full document exchange, we 
have developed a general ontology-driven IM derived 
directly from common PHR data and functions.  In addition, 
the proposed general framework provides a blueprint for 
developing new PHRs interoperable with EHRs. 
III. 
METHODS 
The process of developing the IM involved a number of 
distinct stages including an analysis of data and functionality 
available via common PHRs to determine information to be 
exchanged between PHRs and EHRs, a review of EHR and 
PHR standards, and designing and developing a middleware 
architecture for clinical document exchange. These steps are 
outlined in the following subsections. 
A. Analysis of common PHR functionality 
Initially 81 PHRs were accessed via myPHR web portal 
[13] and another 19 were selected based on a review by 
Carrión Señor et al [14]. By deciding to focus only on easily 
accessible free and web-based systems, 45 PHRs were 
selected. We applied a scoring system developed by [14] 
which assigns a utility score to PHRs based on data and 
access management, privacy and security settings and use of 
recognized standards. This resulted in the following 5 
systems that scored>70% and thus were selected for detailed 
review:  
1) Microsoft Health Vault 
2) Telemedical 
3) NoMoreClipboard 
4) Health Spek 
5) Health Companion 
 Due to the large variation among PHR systems, a 
template including a free text notes section was used to 
manually summarize functionality rather than a formal 
information extraction method. Table 1 summarizes 
extracted PHR information. Functionality has been separated 
into 6 categories which represent natural groupings of 
functionality: i) Patient Demographics and Other Family 
Members, ii) Care Provider Roles, iii) Clinical Record, iv) 
Interoperability, 
v) 
Social 
Aspects, 
and 
vi) 
Other 
Functionality. The last column (“Score”) assigns a score 
reflecting the number of features available in each of the 
outlined categories and the last row of the table summarizes 
the total number of available features for each PHR.

Considering the “Other Functionality” category in Table 
1, the majority of components have a score of 1/5. Many of 
the functions associated with specific PHRs in this section 
are either slightly different to common functionality grouped 
in other categories or represents the same functionality from 
other categories only labelled in a different way.  For 
example, the function of requesting lab results is additional 
functionality in Telemedical that allows users to requests lab 
results from third party applications but not to register results 
in the same way as in the other system (i.e. as part of the 
clinical record). This is an example of how similar 
functionality 
is 
implemented 
(lack 
of 
syntactic 
interoperability) as well as in nomenclature of similar 
concepts (lack of semantic interoperability) among PHRs. 
B. PHR and EHR standards in use 
HL7 RIM, HL7 CDA (Clinical Document Architecture), 
and messaging standards (e.g., HL7 v2.x and v3.0) form the 
backbone of EHR systems. RIM expresses the data content 
needed in a specific clinical context and provides an explicit 
131

representation of the semantic and lexical connections that 
exist between the information carried in the fields of HL7 
messages.  CDA is an XML-based standard that specifies the 
encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for 
exchange. The v3 messaging standard defines a series of 
electronic messages to support all healthcare workflows [10].  
The most common standards used for PHRs include the 
Continuity of Care Record (CCR) which specifies the 
encoding, structure, and semantics of a patient summary 
document. Furthermore, HL7 Continuity of Care Document 
(CCD) provides a template for representing vital signs, 
family history and plan of care [10]. In the case of the 
selected PHRs, CCD, CCR, and XML are used to import and 
export medical data. In most cases the imported documents 
are not fully embodied or merged with the patient’s medical 
record; rather they can be seen as separate documents using 
Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT). 
C. Representing PHR data and relationships 
Our proposed IM, shown in Figure 1, consists of four 
classes to represent PHR data and relationships, namely: i) 
Role (participants), ii) Entity (roles are played by Entities), 
iii) Act (happenings) and iv) Element (data corresponding to 
Acts). The classes Role, Entity and Act have been preserved 
from the HL7 RIM foundation classes, however, both the use 
of each class and their relations have been altered. In RIM 
the class Role is related to the class Act through another 
class named Participation, and to the class Entity. In our IM, 
class Role is related to class Entity and the latter is then 
related directly to class Act. This is due to the fact that Roles 
in PHRs are more limited than in EHRs and thus Entities 
participate directly in Acts.  The class Element has two 
subclasses named “Data” and “Unit” to manipulate 
represented data. These subclasses characterize data input or 
saved by a user as part of an Act.  Sub classing data into its 
constituent Elements allows for finer-grained representation 
of patient data thus allowing the IM to capture variations 
among data stored by various PHR, as well as to adequately 
capture the greater number of data and data types stored by 
PHR when compared to EHR.  
 
Figure 1. Information Model Classes 
Figure 2 provides a sample scenario representing a 
patient monitoring their vital signs. A person (Entity) who is 
the patient (Role), monitors (Act) his vital signs (Element). 
Monitor is a composite Act that involves the measurement of 
different Elements. Moreover, a simple Element may consist 
of Data Elements or/and Units Elements). Data Element 
contains the actual value of a measurement (e.g. 120) and 
Unit Element contains the unit of measurement (mmHg). 
Three of the proposed IM classes are used by HL7 RIM 
which is developed to accommodate any possible act in 
healthcare. Moreover the attributes of each class and the 
class themselves are flexible. Hence, it is expected that the 
proposed four classes can accommodate all relevant 
information for PHRs. 
 
Figure 2. Sample scenario 
D. PHR – EHR  semantic interoperability 
PHRs and EHRs may use different terminology to 
describe the same concept and thus obstruct data exchange 
between applications. To circumvent this obstacle the 
proposed IM uses an ontology developed using Protégé [15] 
and instantiated using Ontology Web Language (OWL) [16] 
as shown in Figure 3. The Ontology defines all classes 
described in the previous subsection along with their 
attributes, data properties (including cardinality and 
multiplicity) and relationships among them. This generic 
ontology may be instantiated for various PHRs. 
 
Figure 3. Information Model as an Ontology 
By utilizing an ontology-based approach, semantic issues 
can be effectively addressed. For example, the declaration of 
equal features “Past Medical History” and “Previous 
Medication”. Moreover, the use of Data Properties that can 
replicate coding schemas is also possible. For instance, the 
SNOMED CT code for past medication is “394829006”. By 
assigning this code to Past Medical History, the meaning of 
these two individuals could also be interpreted as equal.

E. PHR – EHR data syntatic interoperability 
Data exchanged between PHRs and EHRs must conform 
to relevant structure and syntactic rules. In our framework, 
information will be transformed to and transferred as a CDA 
document; therefore the syntactic rules are the actual rules of 
the HL7 CDA standard. The CDA is represented in XML 
and an XML schema has been developed which is 
responsible for encapsulating all relevant syntactic rules. A 
PHP script is used to verify the XML schema.   
F. Proposed Architecute 
Our proposed architecture is shown in Figure 4. Data 
may be either exported from a PHR to an EHR or vice versa 
with the ontology-based IM instantiated as a middle layer 
between the two systems. This is in contrast to the system 
developed in [9] where transformations for exchanging data 
were embedded within the specific PHR and thus any 
updates to the PHR (e.g. addition or deletion of a field) must 
also be propagated through PHR transformations. We 
decided against such a specific solution to ensure greater 
scalability. Our middle layer solution ensures that when 
modifications are made to either a PHR or an EHR, they can 
be encapsulated directly by altering only the middle layer.  
The other prevailing approach (e.g. as in [11, 12]) is to create 
a domain specific IM called a Refined Message Information 
Model (RMIM) using RIM classes. As demonstrated in II.C, 
RIM is composed of pre-defined attributes which are 
difficult to change and generally not flexible enough for the 
wide variety of PHR concepts and associated data. 
Moreover, the use of RMIM emphasizes message exchange 
rather than the exchange of full medical records.

IV. 
DISCUSSION  
Interoperability between PHR and EHR is a major barrier 
to PHR adoption. In this paper we have described ongoing 
development of an ontology-based IM for PHR to EHR 
interoperability. The proposed IM has been derived directly 
by analyzing common features and functionality of current 
PHRs.  It extends HL7 RIM beyond EHR requirements to 
cover 
essential 
PHR requirements. 
Furthermore 
the 
instantiation of the IM as a middle layer between PHR and 
EHR systems insures additional flexibility by not tying the 
solution to any specific system. As well as being applicable 
to existing solutions (both tethered and non-tethered), the 
framework could be used as a blueprint to develop new 
EHR-interoperable PHR by allowing better flexibility both in 
the types and volume of information to be represented. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  
The next stage of our research is to develop a set of 
mapping guidelines for transforming information from the 
ontology-based IM to CDA format. xPath and xQuery will 
be used to parse data exported from PHRs and EHRs and 
PHP scripts will be used to apply the required 
transformations and create the final CDA document. The 
guidelines will be evaluated using scenarios representing 
transformation of PHR data exported from CCR and XML 
format to CDA and vice versa. Longer term we intend to 
analyze PHRs that are not web-based or free of charge - 
primarily tethered systems - and make the required 
alterations to our framework accordingly.
