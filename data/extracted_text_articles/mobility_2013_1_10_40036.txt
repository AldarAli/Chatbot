Abstract— The new OFDMA-based technology is referred to 
as the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) 
through the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system. This paper 
proposes to add Self-Organizing functionalities on the antenna 
architecture, so that the network will be more responsive to 
changes in traffic and environment. This paper also shows the 
interest of a robust approach due to the uncertainty of the 
traffic distribution. First, we develop and validate the 
interference model based on SINR metric for the deployment 
of the LTE network, and then we use greedy algorithms to 
show how the antenna parameters settings such as frequency, 
tilt and output power, can highly impact the networks 
coverage due to the traffic changes.

INTRODUCTION 
The Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a new air-interface 
designed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 
[6]. The 4th generation of mobile system is aimed to achieve 
additional substantial leaps in term of service provisioning 
and cost reduction [3]. In addition, to make the network 
design process time-efficient, Self-Organizing Network 
(SON) functionalities added within LTE architecture by 
incorporating automated optimization, can significantly 
reduce deployment and maintenance costs (CAPital 
EXpenditure and OPerating Expenditure, respectively). The 
self-organization capability of a mobile network mainly 
includes three aspects: self-configuration, self-optimization 
and self-healing [17]. Focus in this paper is on self-
optimization to achieve better network performance goals. 
The self-optimization phase is preceded by a step of 
measurements carried out on all the resources to recover data 
as different as the workflow [18]. This will include assessing 
network performance toward the user request such as traffic 
and mobility. Measures may include the characteristics of 
radio channels, admission, congestion, handover, etc. These 
measures serve as input data for the self-optimization. In the 
self-optimization phase, considered as the intelligent phase in 
SON, effective methods are applied to the previous data to 
carry out the management of the network based on user 
needs in traffic demand and quality of service. The 
optimization involves the physical parameters of antennas 
(frequency allocation, tilt, azimuth radiation, power, etc.).  
In wireless networks, the main key to improve the 
achievable average throughput by user is to mitigate the 
inter-cell interference [1, 2] caused by using the same 
frequency within adjacent cells. Various frequency reuse 
schemes have been proposed in literature [3, 4, 5].  
Resource allocation in radio networks essentially 
depends on the quality of some reference signals received by 
the User Equipment (UE). In LTE, they are the Reference 
Signal Received Power (RSRP) and the Reference Signal 
Received Quality (RSRQ) corresponding, respectively, to 
Received Signal Code Power (RSCP) and Ec/No in UMTS 
(Universal Mobile Telecommunications System). Each user 
is assigned a portion of the spectrum depending on RSRP 
and RSRQ. The more complex optimization of reference 
signal is the RSRQ, which is based on Signal to Interference 
plus Noise Ratio (SINR) [2, 6]. SINR is an important 
performance indicator for estimating the achievable 
throughput, taking into account the interference received 
from the neighboring cluster of first-tier cells. The estimation 
and optimization of the SINR are well-known problems in 
radio communication systems such as the 802.11, the Global 
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or the UMTS 
[11, 12, 13], and LTE needs also a good estimation and 
control 
of 
SINR. 
Optimizing 
antenna 
parameters 
configuration to meet variant of services and performance 
requirement is one of main targets of next generation 
networks. It can significantly improve the coverage and the 
capacity of the network dealing with the lack of available 
bandwidth in base stations.  Several studies have been done 
in this direction to understand the impact of parameters on 
antennal quality of service offered by the network [6, 7]. 
Didan et al. in [14] have measured the impact of azimuth and 
tilt inaccuracies on network performance considering three 
main quality parameters: service coverage, soft handover 
areas and the ratio of chip energy to interference Ec/No. 
Many simulation results show that azimuth error in the range 
of ±8 degrees is tolerable to improve the Networks 
performance. 
Tilt parameter has the same effect on Network 
performance while setting tolerance is just about ±0.5 
degrees. The approach of simulated annealing is used by 
Siomina et al. [7] to study the number of network 
configuration parameters (the Common PIlot CHanel power, 
CIPCH, the downtilt and the antenna azimuth) effects toward 
coverage 
service 
in 
UMTS 
network. 
In 
modern 
communication systems, further parameters investigations

have been developed to meet requirement set. Various 
combinations of antenna have been studied in term of SINR 
and throughput performance in LTE case, outlined for 
example in [6, 15]. 
The interference model developed in this paper takes into 
account the load factor of cells to measure the impact of the 
traffic on the SINR metric. Our aim is to study the influence 
of the frequency, tilt and output power parameters on  the 
coverage performance metrics (quality of the SINR, users in 
outage…), and also emphasize the interest of robust 
optimization considering frequency, tilt and output power as 
important design parameters when tuning live network. The 
choice of the robust approach is mainly due to the 
uncertainty of the traffic distribution due to the traffic 
change. Our contribution for SON feature is designed to 
monitor the performance of the network operation. 
Following data analysis step, optimization algorithms and 
corrections will be triggered automatically to make decisions 
on how to operate the system and this according to the 
objectives of operators and users needs. We show here the 
“interest” of using robust approach based on simple greedy 
descent algorithm. Further work must be done on algorithmic 
approach.  
For this aim, the paper is structured as follows. Section II 
introduces the system model and basic assumptions. Section 
III extends this paper and shows the performance metrics and 
test assumptions. Subsequently, Section IV presents some 
results to highlight the use of SINR interference model and 
shows the utility of robust optimization toward the change in 
the traffic demand. Conclusion and perspectives are drawn in 
Section V.  
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
A. Basic Assumptions 
In this paper, we consider the downlink transmission and 
illustrate the interference schemes using a theoretical model 
of seven-cell hexagonal layout as shown in Figure 1. Three 
sectors are considered in each site (center of the cell) with 
three evolved Node Bases (eNB), which is the base station in 
LTE system. Each sector is covered only by only one eNB. 
Figure 1(a) represents the frequency reuse 1x3x1 pattern 
where 1 site with 3 sectors use 1 frequency set called sub-
band or carrier, that is the same frequency set for all sectors.

Figure 1.  Seven-cell hexagonal layout. a) 1x3x1 b) 1x3x3 
Figure 1(b) represents the frequency reuse 1x3x3 pattern 
where 1 site with 3 sectors use 3 frequency sets, that is 
different frequency set for all sectors. The 1x3x3 requires a 
frequency plan but should avoid interference when the 
network load becomes too high to apply the 1x3x1 pattern. 
The features of our computational model are the 
following:  
- Intra-frequency interference is avoided due to the use of 
the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access 
(OFDMA) technique in downlink transmission. In LTE the 
orthogonality 
between 
subcarriers 
insures 
that 
the 
interference inside the cell can be ignored.  
- The basic resource element in OFDMA is the Physical 
Resource Block (PRB), which spans both frequency and 
time dimensions. In this paper, we do not take into account 
PRB to estimate the inter-cell interference; we only consider 
the frequency sub-band (or carrier) reuse scheme. Two 
adjacent cells are scrambling with each other if they are 
using the same sub-band to transmit data. It gives a fast 
estimation of the SINR. 
- Scenarios are used to represent the traffic distribution of 
our model. Since LTE network traffic is unpredictable now, 
we adapt the real UMTS network to simulate the LTE 
system. The interference model defined here and based on 
SINR depends not only on antenna parameters (frequency, 
tilt, azimuth, etc.) but also on traffic load along day; then in 
our computation the users available in target sector or 
adjacent sectors can affect the received signal from other 
users. As we consider that all users communicate at the 
same time, a scenario of traffic shows the distribution of 
demand at a given time. 
- We introduce a performance indicator to measure 
occupancy rate on each sector, the load factor. This indicator 
is a ratio between used bandwidth and the maximum 
available bandwidth. It is measured for each sector of the 
network. The feature of the load factor is to determine the 
bottlenecks of the network and the overloaded sectors. This 
indicator will be used in the interference model. 
 
B. Case Study and Problem Formulation 
The considered network for this study consists of tri-
sectors sites in the city of Belfort, located in the north-
eastern of France. The service area is a 40km x 20km area 
with a lot of big industrial companies. For our model the 
service area is divided into a grid of equally sized test points. 
A test point is a 25x25 meters area. Due to the very small 
size of the test point, we assume the same signal propagation 
conditions for all users within the same test point; it means 
that all users located inside a test point have the same signal 
and the same RSRP, SINR and RSRQ. Thus, a test point 
determines the resolution of the computation and the amount 
of data on signals. A test point is characterized by its number 
of users and the category of required services for each user 
(voice, data, etc.). Each sector in the network is equipped 
with one directive antenna. Each antenna is characterized by 
its parameters: radiation pattern, azimuth, electrical and 
mechanical tilts, gain in transmission and reception, 
frequency and output power in downlink. Due to the 
dynamic aspect of the network and changes in traffic 
demand, we introduce the concept of traffic scenarios. A 
scenario is a given distribution and load of the traffic demand 
at a given time for each test point of the map.

Several scenarios allow us to compute different situations 
of network performance to study the robustness problem. 
The problem formulation is given by the following sets 
of data, parameters and functions. 
Let:

B  1,...,nB 

network; 

T  1,..., nTP 
, the set of nTP test points of the 
map; and Ct,s, the number of users located on the test 
point t in scenario s.

is the SINR received by the test point t and

bf  and 
bf   are 
binary variable frequencies used by eNB b and b’, 
respectively. It means 
1
fb,n
bf


as we consider that 
the eNB b is using the carrier n. and 
bf   is a binary 
variable, which is set to 1 if it uses the same carrier as 
bf  and 0 otherwise. 
δb,s
 and 
b'δ s,
 are load factors that 
corresponds to the target eNB b and interfering eNBs b’ 
in scenario s. Both load factors 
δb,s
 and 
b'δ s,
 are added 
in the model because we assume that users inside target 
and interfering cell could impact the quality if the SINR.  
Base station b is said to be saturated in scenario s if its 
load factor 
δb,s
 is equal to 1. The term w represents the 
total bandwidth used by b and n0 is the thermal noise 
over the bandwidth w. The terms 
R
pb,t
and 
R
t,
bp  are the 
end power received by UE located in test point t from, 
respectively, b and b’. Note that the load factor in the 
interference pattern is introduced because we believe that 
users scramble neighboring cells transmitting on the 
same frequency, causes more interference and suddenly, 
penalizes the SINR. 
The estimation of this power is based on the Hata 
propagation model [16] in (2):

adjusts the radiating currents in the antenna elements to

antenna parameters configuration on the coverage 
performance metric, with respect to traffic distribution.

In addition to Table I, further assumptions are used for 
robust optimization tests. Three realistic traffic scenarios 
are tested (8am, 3pm and 6pm). Frequency scheme reuse 
1x3x3 is retained. Deterministic allocation of sub-bands 
as showed in the right part of Figure 1 is now used. The 
antennas are grouped by site and stored on the basis of an 
index in ascending order of the x-axis (the coordinate of 
the position (x, y, z) of the antenna in the network). The 
performance metric considered is the Signal to 
Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR). 
The SINR, expressed in (1), is an important indicator 
to evaluate cellular networks. The SINR choice is 
motivated by the fact that: it takes into account all the 
parameters of the antenna; it depends on the traffic 
distribution and the load factor of the network; it resizes 
the network and determines which base station controls 
each user; and it allows us to estimate the total throughput 
of the network. We define two intermediate performance 
indicators that allow us to evaluate the SINR at each point 
of the network. 
A. The load factor  
The load factor of the sector/cell is the ratio between 
the total allocated bandwidth to the cell, which is the 
required bandwidth and the maximum total bandwidth 
available in the cell, which are the resources allocated to 
the cell. Let 
δb,s
 be the load factor, then: 
w /w
δ
S
b,s
s
b, 
 
where, 
S
wb,s
 is the total allocated bandwidth to the base 
station b in the reference scenario s, and w is its maximum 
available bandwidth. It is worthwhile to mention that load 
factor is one of the main key indicators in cellular 
networks. It has been suggested that the downlink cell 
load for a stable network should not exceed 70% [7]. 
Huge loaded cells are those for which 
0.7
δ s
b, 
and 
overloaded cells are those for which
1.
δ s
b, 
 
B. Throughput  
We used the SINR to determine the throughput 
offered by a base station to the set of users who are 
located in the cell test points: the higher the SINR, the 
greater the quality of the channel and the throughput.

IV. 
RESULTS EVALUATION 
In order to evaluate the SINR model presented in 
Section II, we focus on frequency reuse 1 (1x3x1 pattern) 
and 3 (1x3x3 pattern). The baseline network used for our 
study is the city of Belfort described in Section II.B. The 
UE are randomly dropped in each cell in proportion to 
UMTS traffic load regard to Belfort city. Due to the 
unavailability of data for LTE networks, we used data 
from a real GSM/UMTS and adapted it to a 4G-LTE 
system.  
We present now the methodology to evaluate the 
SINR model taking into account traffic data of the 
baseline network. Firstly, we assume that the base station 
is engaged to communicate with a UE if the SINR 
received by the UE is high enough, i.e., achieve the 
required SINR threshold to establish a communication. 
So, the UE is allocated to a base station according to the 
quality of the received SINR. Then we assume that the 
load factor is considered to calculate the SINR as 
mentioned in (1). 
A cell is defined as a set of test points of the map; a 
test point is assigned to the base station, which provides 
the best SINR. As a first step we assign the test point to 
the base station on the basis of the best RSRP and define 
the initial cell coverage for each station. Then we 
determine the number of UE per cell and the traffic 
demand as well. We compute the load factor for each 
station, and finally we estimate the SINR, which depends 
on the RSRQ. As a second step we assign again the test 
point to the base station on the basis of the best SINR. 
From there we estimate again the load factor for each 
station. This second step is repeated several times (10 
times) to try to reach a stable network configuration. The 
collected traffic data come from a real UMTS network. 
The tests consider three different scenarios originating 
from one-day traffic, as shown in Figure 3. The x axis unit 
is a set of time intervals of 15 minutes each. 
 
 
Figure 3.   One-day traffic with three chosen scenarios 
Three scenarios were selected at different times of the 
day as follows: a first scenario at 8am with low traffic and 
482 users dropped randomly in the network; a second 
scenario at 3pm with medium traffic and 1,019 users; and 
a third scenario at 6pm with high traffic and 1,471 users. 
We are considering that all users are accessing the 
network at the same time (saturated traffic condition). 
A. Interference model results 
To compare the performances of both reuse 1x3x1 and 
reuse 1x3x3 patterns, the number of users in outage is 
used as a performance metric. The minimum required 
SINR is equal to 0.9 dB. Below this value of SINR, one 
user cannot establish a communication as defined in (18):

Figure 4 depicts the number of users in outage 
obtained with both reuses pattern: scheme 1x3x1 and 
scheme 1x3x3. In the network design we test for scheme 
1x3x3, the sub-band assignment depends on the azimuth 
orientation of the sectors. Sectors in opposite direction 
from neighbor sites are assigned different frequency 
groups. 
The program implementing our model is developed in 
C++. We run the program 10 times to check the 
convergence of the SINR computation (the difference is 
below 5%). An example of three scenarios of traffic is 
presented in Figure 4 to show the interest of using the 
reuse scheme 1x3x3 in a real network design and traffic 
load. We see that the number of users in outage is more 
important in scheme 1x3x1 (13, 36, and 40) than in 
scheme 1x3x3 (8, 18 and 17) for the three scenarios of 
traffic load considered here (8am, 3pm and 6pm,   
respectively).

These results are consistent since the total bandwidth 
used in pattern 1 can assign more resources, but would 
jeopardize the rate offered by the network. This is due 
mainly to the undesirable inter-cell interference generated 
by neighboring cells using the same frequency set. Such a 
dense frequency reuse is an obvious pitfall, which limits 
the throughput at the cell edge. We can also note 
according to these results that, the higher the traffic, the 
higher the number of outage users, whatever the 
frequency pattern solution.  
B. Parameter setting optimization   
The second part of this study is dedicated to robust 
optimization. It shows that optimizing a number of 
network configuration parameters like antenna frequency, 
tilt orientation and power transmission helps considerably 
to meet variant of services and performance requirement.  
A greedy algorithm on frequency, tilt and output 
power is used to examine how the solution of the antenna 
configuration, behaves under realistic scenarios. 
Algorithm description 
In order to show the interest of robust optimization, 
we present an algorithm able to quickly find a good 
solution. We were not looking for the best solution at this 
stage. An iterative algorithm is used; the purpose is not to 
find an optimal solution but to get the benefit of robust 
optimization for 3 scenarios in comparison with local 
solution based on a single scenario. The algorithm with 
several variants is proposed for each parameter: frequency 
allocation, tilt and power configuration. We measure the 
effect of each parameter toward the network coverage 
performance metric. 
 
-Frequency parameter optimization 
It can be proved that frequency assignment problem is 
NP-hard as it is a graph-coloring problem [19]. For such 
problems, guaranteeing optimum requires, in the worst 
case, an enumeration of all possible configurations. The 
number of possibilities is enormous; in our case study, for 
36 cells, 88 antennas and 3 frequency groups, the number 
of possibilities is 636= 1.03*1028.  The robust optimization 
function takes into account the three scenarios considered 
above. The used algorithm is described in the following. 
We run the optimization with different varying 
conditions: 
- The scenarios of traffic: several traffic hours. 
- The initial frequency assignment to the base stations: 
deterministic or stochastic per sector from the same site. 
- The sites neighborhood search to test the permutation of 
frequency: sites ranked from the input file or randomly 
chosen during optimization. 
The algorithm starts with a solution using the reuse 
scheme 1x3x3. The optimization algorithm is run for each 
scenario to show the best configuration of the frequency 
parameter setting with respect to the performance metric 
given by the (14). For each explored site, we evaluate the 
6 (3! =6) possibilities of permutations for each sector of 
the site. The algorithm evaluates 6x88 permutations at 
each iteration. If a frequency permutation improves the 
evaluation function of the current solution, the algorithm 
keeps the last modification and goes through the next 
sector configuration. The algorithm stops once the current 
iteration brings no improvement. This is achieved by the 
following algorithm, which was used for all cases.

-Tilt and power parameters Optimization 
The same algorithm is implemented to optimize the 
tilt parameter and transmission power of the antennas. 
Different configurations are tested using a discretization 
of the possible values. We aim at finding good antenna 
configurations among a range of possible values for both 
tilt and power. For 36 cells and 88 antennas, we have 1388 
= 1.06 * 1098 possibilities. For the tilt parameter, the range 
of values is [0°, 12°] in degrees, and for power parameter, 
the range of values are [36dBm, 46dBm]. It is impossible 
in such case to guarantee an optimum solution; we aim 
then at finding an acceptable solution and show the tilt 
and power transmission effects on the traffic demand 
scenarios. We assume that: three scenarios of traffic are 
considered; the starting solution on the tilt and output 
power parameters are those given by the realistic 
GSM/UMTS network (operating data); the sites in 
neighborhood search are chosen first in the order of 
storage as it is in the data file and then, randomly during 
optimization phase. So, we have two variants of the 
algorithm for each parameter.   
We evaluate the possible values of each parameter for 
each antenna to meet better number of covered users, 
using the same starting solution and the same scenarios 
of traffic (8am, 3pm, and 6pm).  
In the first variant of our algorithm, sites are processed 
in the order of storage in the data file, all possible 
configurations are tested at each iteration for both tilt and 
output power parameters. If the current configuration 
improves the evaluation function of the current solution, 
we maintain the solution and then process the next 
neighborhood site chosen in the data file. The algorithm 
stops once the current iteration brings no improvement 
(stopping criteria). In the second variant, we keep the 
same assumptions (same scenarios of traffic and same 
starting solution) but sites are processed randomly instead 
of the order in the data file. In this case, the stopping 
criteria considered here is the running time duration. 
Results with non robust and robust optimization 
-Frequency optimization results 
The results of optimization are shown in the Figures 6 
and 7. We emphasize that for the non robust (each 
scenario tackled alone) and for the robust optimization 
(the 3 scenarios together) we use the same algorithm but 
in case of robustness the evaluation function is given by 
(15) and takes into account the configuration of the 
frequency considering all the scenarios simultaneously.

Figure 6.  Three scenarios of robust optimization with deterministic 
frequency allocation 
It means that, for each frequency of the network, we 
evaluate the non-covered users in the three scenarios on 
one run. So, we run the same algorithm 4 times (one run 
for each optimization s1, s2, s3 and robust case), we use 
the evaluation function (14) to optimize the 3 scenarios 
separately; then we use the evaluation function (15) for 
the robust optimization using the 3 scenarios at the same 
time. 
The x-axis represents the starting solution and the 
optimization of scenarios s1, s2 and s3 separately and the 
robust optimization at the end. The y-axis shows the 
number of users in outage for each scenario s1, s2, s3 and 
total number. We can note that scenario1 optimization has 
the smallest number of non-covered users when 
evaluating s1 (4 users) comparing to the other cases (8, 7, 
9). The same analysis can be done for the scenario s3 and 
it is different for s2 but not far away from the best one. 
We fixed the run to 20 minutes for random frequency 
allocation, so there is no guarantee on the solution quality 
(the convergence is not definitive). We observe that the 
result of the robust optimization is a trade off between the 
three scenarios, the best for s1 and s2 but not the best for 
s3. Finally, the fitness function value  of non-covered 
users for all cases corresponds to the global best solution 
(blue color in the right part), while in other situations, 
starting solution and non robust cases, the global function 
values are 43, 25, 27 and 29, respectively, from left to 
right part of the Figure 6. The robust optimization does a 
better compromise between all scenarios. This result 
shows how the robust approach is important for the 
remaining of this study. Different variants of the 
algorithm have been tested by varying several conditions. 
We run the program 20 minutes for each optimization in 
Test 2 and Test 3, and keep the best solution for the 
considered fitness function (so the test conditions are the 
same for all cases). Test 1 (Figure 6): the initial frequency 
plan is deterministically assigned and the sites are 
processed respecting their rank in the input file. Test 2: 
the initial frequency plan is deterministically assigned and 
the sites are randomly processed during optimization. The 
results are similar to the test 1 so we do not plot it. Test 3 
(Figure 7): the initial frequency plan is randomly assigned 
to the co-site sectors and the sites are randomly processed 
during optimization.

parameter effect on the number of non covered users, we 
limit at showing 2 tests varying the neighborhood sites 
process and the stopping criteria. 
Test 1 (Figure 8): the algorithm presented in Figure 5 
is implemented. It means that with the same starting 
solution (3 scenarios of traffic and the operating tilts in 
real network), the site neighborhood search is done 
according their storage in the data file. In addition of sites 
search, the algorithm stops once there is no improvement 
of the fitness solution. Results are shown in Figure 8. It 
shows 5 parts, from the right to left: starting solution, 
optimization of scenarios s1, s2 and s3 separately, and then 
robust optimization. The starting point of the algorithm is 
the starting solution (43, 8, 18 and 17), which represents 
the number of non-covered users in the global function 
(15) and scenario function (14) for each scenario. 
We emphasize that the optimization of each scenario 
brings better results when each scenario is tackled 
separately (7, 11, 12) respectively, but impacts the global 
function. In robust optimization, we can easily note that 
the configuration found by the algorithm is a better 
compromise between all scenarios,

Figure 9 shows the same results as in Figure 8. It 
confirms that optimizing by means of robust function can 
improve the network coverage with regard to traffic 
distribution.  
 
- Output power optimization results 
Initial output powers used for the starting solution are 
those operated by the GSM / UMTS network. The same 
initial conditions, as in the optimization of tilts, were 
used. Results are shown in the Figure 10. 
As in the case of frequencies and tilts, robust 
optimization of power offers a solution that is a good 
compromise between the three traffic scenarios (Figure 
10). This shows the interest of robust optimization due to 
the uncertainty of traffic and confirms the results already 
obtained in the previous cases.

Figure 11.   Comparison between frequency, tilt and output power 
optimization: Sites processed according their storage in data file;

The Figure 11 represents a comparison between the 3 
parameters setting optimizations; with the same initial 
conditions, using the same greedy algorithm. According 
to these results, we note that optimizing the frequency 
parameter provides better results while taking coverage as 
a performance indicator: less uncovered users for s1 case 
(4<7<7.5); s2 (8<11<13) and s3 (9<12<15) and also in 
robust optimization (21<31<34.5). This is due mainly to 
the undesirable inter-cell interference generated by 
neighboring cells using the same frequency set. It impacts 
more the SINR quality comparing to the tilt and output 
power parameters.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper focuses on the self-organizing networks to 
automate the configuration of the antenna parameters and 
shows the interference model and the interest of robust 
approach with respect of traffic distribution in LTE 
downlink system. The analysis has been carried out using 
model radiation pattern and simple model of system 
performance. We proposed an interference model, which 
has been validated based on SINR computation and

comparing two reuse schemes (1x3x1 and 1x3x3) under 
realistic scenarios. With respect to coverage, it has been 
observed that the reference reuse 1x3x3 present best 
results with respect to the number of covered users, 
independently on the traffic demand. It shows also that 
the load factor could impact the quality of signal at end 
users. It is an important indicator because it highlights the 
overloaded cells, which represent the bottleneck of the 
network.  Using system simulations, we studied how the 
frequency, tilt, and output power parameters setting affect 
the coverage of the macro-cellular scenario. Different 
combinations of frequency, tilt and output power are used 
and obtained results show how coverage indicator is 
sensitive to the combination, and also to the traffic 
inaccuracies. Simple algorithms used here confirm the 
interest of robust approach respective of realistic traffic 
load.   
As perspectives, we aim in further studies at analyzing 
the impact of the parameter settings configuration on the 
interference model and different performance metrics 
(throughput, capacity, and coverage). Furthermore, robust 
optimization approaches like the Variable Neighborhood 
Search and Tabu Search are under development to 
highlight the impact of the traffic uncertainty in the 
deployment of the network.
