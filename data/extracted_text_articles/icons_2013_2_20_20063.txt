Abstract—In the context of a project regarding a trafﬁc light
assistant on smart phones, a survey about ownership, usage
in relation to trafﬁc and car issues as well as acceptance of a
potential trafﬁc light assistant was carried out. The survey was
conducted as a paper-based poll as well as online. 694 people
took part. The user’s need to browse social media while driving,
as is sometimes mentioned in distraction debates, could not be
found. The idea of a trafﬁc light assistant on a smart phone
(as a guide to the next green phase, or inform the driver to
decelerate the car early) had different acceptance rates among
males and females, and was more acceptable to men.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the project KOLIBRI (Kooperative Lichtsignalop-
timierung
Bayerisches
Pilotprojekt;
engl:
cooperative
optimization of trafﬁc signal control
Bavarian pilot
project) [1], an application-oriented vehicular system is
prototypically developed and tested. The system, a trafﬁc
light assistant, is intended to inform the driver of a car
about upcoming trafﬁc signal states so he can adjust his
driving behavior.
The project develops two different ways to deliver
messages to the driver: an onboard system integrated into
the instrumentation of a demonstration car and a system
to inform the driver via a standard smartphone that can be
installed in any car. The data is transmitted over existing
2nd and 3rd generation mobile networks (GMS, UMTS)
from the trafﬁc lights to a central server. The demonstration
car or a mobile phone requests appropriate data ﬁles from
the server and displays the proper speed recommendation
or other messages for the next trafﬁc light approach.
The four partners of the project are responsible for
different
duties.
The
Institute
of
Ergonomics
at
the
Technische Universtit¨at M¨unchen is in charge of the
human machine interface (HMI) and evaluating the system
in a simulator and real ﬁeld trials. The institute found
the information of drivers via smart phones a promising
solution and is focusing on it.
Information communication via smartphones would not
involve signiﬁcant extra costs for installation or purchasing.
Nowadays, smart phones are widely used. Due to the use
of the assistant in the car, care must be taken for suitability
while driving. Ergonomic requirments, e.g. gaze durations
and acceptance, led a particular human machine interface
(HMI). The details are discussed in [17] and [18]. In
addition to simulated and real ﬁeld experiments, a parallel
survey was carried out to ﬁnd out more about the existing
prerequisites for a trafﬁc light assistant via smart phones.
How widespread are car mounts for mobile phones? How
often they are used? Would a trafﬁc light assistant via
smartphone be accepted?
The following methodology section describes the tools
used for the poll and characterizes the group of test sub-
jects. The results section shows the ﬁndings, based on the
sequence of the questions in the survey. The results are
grouped into subsections (Phone Type, Personal or Profes-
sional, Car Mount for Mobile Phone, Mobile Phone Usage,
Car Related, Acceptance of a Trafﬁc Light Assistant).
II. RELATED WORK
Early contribution in the ﬁeld of trafﬁc light assistance
can be found in the project Wolfsburger Welle [2], [3]. Also
Australian trafﬁc engineers experimented in the 80’s with
trafﬁc light related speed advices and identiﬁed potential
beneﬁts. [8], [9] compared an in-vehicle system to dynamic
trafﬁc signs along the road in a driving simulator experiment
and found subjective preferences for the variable message
signs and objective advantage for the in-car display. In [10],
different HMIs for an on-board system were tested and an
integration into the speedometer seems to be an adequate
solution. The interface idea of the Wolfsburger Welle was
(modiﬁed) adopted in the project TRAVOLUTION (Audi
AG) [11] and the German project aktiv [12], [13]. aktiv
used for the driver information a personal digital assistant
(PDA) with WiFi connection to the trafﬁc lights. The
drawback of this approach is the limited connection range,
to get data from a trafﬁc light. Experimental data for
the coverage and handshake times can be found in [15].
The WiFi connectivity for trafﬁc light assistance (under
different vehicle speeds) was also examined by [14]. The

use of already installed communication networks (GSM,
UMTS) within the project KOLIBRI overcomes the limited
coverage range of dedicated short range communications.
Another approach, that uses the camera of a smart phone
and image processing, is proposed by [16]. For this, the
phone (with the camera) must be installed with view to
the road. This is likely to mask the driver’s ﬁeld of view.
Within KOLIBRI the only constraint is an acceptable GPS
signal for the smart phone. On rural road this is not a
restraint.
III. METHOD
The survey was carried out on paper questionnaires as
well as online, using the LimeSurvey online system at the
end of 2011 and beginning of 2012. Participants for the
paper based pool were mainly acquired at the Technische
Universtit¨at M¨unchen (Campus Garching). For the online
survey the link to the pool was disseminated by email and
through the university’s Facebook page.
Twenty-ﬁve questions made up the questionnaire. It took
about 10 minutes to complete.
The analysis presented here considers 373 replies to the
paper-based form and 321 answers to the online survey (78
incomplete or blank forms were eliminated), for an overall
total of 694 participants.
The paper based participants were 76% male and 24%
female, aged between 16 and 64 with an interquartile
distance from 20 to 24 (median 22).
The online survey was ﬁlled in by 87% males and 13%
females, aged between 17 and 74 with an interquartile
distance from 20 to 26 (median 22).
The results from both sources are reported together and
are not further split up nor are analyzed independently. Thus
the overall group has an average age of 23.9 years (SD 6.9)
and the gender is 81 percent male and 19 percent female. The
average annual mileage is 9883 km (SD 12585). Driver’s
licenses were obtained at an average age of 17.7 years (SD
1.4).
IV. RESULTS
A. Phone Type
As shown in Figure 1, 43% of the phones run on
a proprietary operating system, 23% are based on the
(proprietary) iOS, 31% are Androids and 3% of users
did not answered, or have no mobile phone. The ﬁgure
does not explicitly distinguish between ‘smart phones’
and conventional mobile phones, because deﬁnitions are
evolving and there are many in-between devices. It can be
concluded that all of the Android and iOS devices (i.e.,
iPhones) are ‘smart phones’, plus some of the others.

B. Personal or Professional
Asked for the main reason (personal or professional) to
use their mobile phone 95.7% answered personal and 3.5 %
professional (0.8% undeﬁned).
For 90%, the main reason to use a car was for personal
use, and professional use for 6.5% (3.5% undeﬁned).
52% said they used the phone in the car for personal
reasons, while 3.5% used it for professional reasons and
42.4% never/seldom used it in a car (1.7% undeﬁned).
When asked about the main type of car used, 4.9% had
no car, 56.3% bought a used one, 29.2% bought a new car,
5.1% rented a vehicle and 4.3% have a company car.
C. Car Mount for Mobile Phone
For the safe use of a trafﬁc light assistant, cradles in the
cars would be a prerequisite. Asked about such a phone
mount, 82.3% of the participants had no car holder for their
phone. The traditional mounting method of a suction cup is
used by only 11%, and 5.3% use other ways to mount the
phone in the car (1.4% undeﬁned).
Figure 2 shows the mounting locations for the phone
holder. 45% of users who mount their phones use the middle
area of the windshield.
When asked how frequently the phone is ﬁxed in the
holder while driving (Figure 3), one-third of the already
small number of holder users mount the phone only for long
distances.

D. Mobile Phone Usage
The starting age of cell-phone usage was calculated based
on how long the subject had used the mobile phone and the
age of the person. Figure 5 shows that most begin at the age
of 14.
The ‘years per phone’ (Figure 6) were calculated based
on how long the subjects had been using a mobile phone
and how many different phones the subject had during this
time.

Asked which phone function is the most frequent used
while driving (Figure 11), the phone function is on top,
followed by ‘none’, SMS and music. The option ‘named
app’ is further classiﬁed in Figure 12. The app mentioned
most often, by far, is navigation. Whatsapp and Facebook
play only a minor role (each mentioned three times, in total
by ﬁve different persons). Apps mentioned only once, and
so not included in Figure 12, are: photos, ﬂight information,
music, GPS speedometer, Shazam, Siri, parking help, num-
ber plate information. It should be also noted that driving
with a radar warning system is forbidden in Germany.

F. Acceptance of a Trafﬁc Light Assistant
The test subjects were asked if they would have
safety concerns if a future smartphone app could provide
information about upcoming trafﬁc signal states (trafﬁc
light assistance) and if they were to use the app themselves.
Most of the males (84%) answered ’no’ (no worries about
safety). 62% of females share this opinion.
The question was then slightly altered: Would you have
concerns about safety if other drivers were to use a trafﬁc
light assistant app? This question reduced the males’ lack
of concern to 66% (no worries about safety) and 57% for
females.
The question as to whether a trafﬁc light assistant app
would be used by the participant was answered positively
by 78% of the males and 51% of females.
The maximum price the participants would be willing to
pay for a trafﬁc light assistant app is bimodal, with peaks
at zero euro and ﬁve euros (Figure 13).

Figure 14. What would be paid for an onboard trafﬁc light assistant system
And [20] found 31.2% Android and 20.7% iOS for Europe.
Based on the results of [21], it can be assumed that the
proportion of Android smartphones is increasing. The
often-used practice of implementing one app native for
both systems (iOS and Android) would apply to half of the
mobile phone population in this survey.
The young age, the high percentage of males and the
main use of phones and cars for personal purposes in
this survey is likely due to the academic, student-heavy
population at the technical university.
One requirement for safely providing driver information
via smartphones is having an appropriate mounting method
for the phone in the car. Currently only about on in ﬁve
people has a car mount for the phone and only one-ﬁfth of
these use it during each car ride. An introduction of a driver
information system must also advertise good practices for
mounting locations (no ﬁeld-of-view occlusions and no
signiﬁcant deviation from the line of sight).
Most people had no phone mount because they do not
see a need. Nevertheless, the high level of willingness to
use a trafﬁc light assistance system could be a chance
to promote the safe integration of mobile devices into the car.
The main age for start mobile phone usage in this study
seems to be 14. From data shown in [22], the actual starting
age of mobile phone usage for German children seems to
be somewhere between the age of 10 and 13.
Most of the time, phones are used for about two years.
This could be an artifact of the contract strategy of German
network providers. The contracts are generally limited to
two years and are bundled with a phone.
iPhone users seem to download more apps to their
phone. This is in line with [23], which found that iPhone
users download 48 apps/month and Android users 35
apps/month. A higher app activity for iPhone users was
also reported by [24] (37 installed apps on iPhone versus
22 apps on Android). It would be interesting to ﬁnd out
whether this is due to generally higher user activity, easier
app installation or reasons based on the phone itself: are
37

Androids better equipped with OEM preinstalled programs?
Or are the users wiser and realize that they will never
use more than a couple of apps? [25] found that users
installed an average of 24 apps and used 9 in the last month.
No matter how the answers for the most often used apps
are analyzed, Facebook is always in ﬁrst place. Facebook
was also found to be the favorite app in [24]. In [20],
Facebook is not the favorite app, but ranks among the top
apps. The next four places in this survey change order
depending on the analysis technique (Figure 8 and Figure
9), but the candidates are the same: whatsapp, public
transportation information, navigation and news. Navigation
was also found to be an important app in the above studies.
Some differences between the previous studies and this
survey: In this survey, music and weather do not play
an important role; on the other hand, the information
about public transportation is important here and was not
mentioned in the other studies. [26] also found Whatsapp
and Facebook to be top-ranking in Germany.
The most often used function of the mobile while driving
is the phone, different apps play only a minor role. If an
app is used while driving it is likely a navigation app. The
social media referred to as driver distractions ([27], [28])
are unimportant and are used to the same degree as already
forbidden radar warning systems. The vast majority of road
users are responsible drivers. Another survey found that
20% of driver would use Facebook while driving if it could
be controlled by speech [29].
The acceptance of a trafﬁc light assistance system by
females is surprisingly low, compared to males answers.
Most men also see no safety issue. This should also be
addressed if a trafﬁc light assistant were to be introduced.
The driver must be aware of his or her responsibility while
driving. From the results it is likely that the early adopters
will be males.
Due to the high willingness to use the system, the peaks
at zero euros for an acceptable price could be a sign that
people wish to use it for free. For an app this could maybe
be realized through various distribution models (goverment
grant, advertisement, etc). For an car onboard system it
would be not feasible to get it for free. Questions about
an appropriate price are also used in simulator studies and
real ﬁeld trials. It will be interesting to see how real-life
experience with such a system inﬂuences the perceived
value.
VI. CONCLUSION
For the trafﬁc light assistant project it is likely that a
ﬁrst native app will be implemented for Android, maybe
followed up by an iOS implementation. The high (male)
willingness to use the system should be a chance to promote
safe integration of mobile devices into the car and to raise
awareness among all stakeholders about responsibility while
driving. Given that a majority of participants does not have
a suitable mounting option and seems to be uncritical of
distraction issues, implementing this attractive app could be
an opportunity to provide users with relevant information
about these topics within the application.
From the small number of users found in this data the
‘social media while driving’ issue does not seem to be
worth discussing at this time. This opinion is in contrast to
[28].
It is important that systems are technically well designed,
in terms of hard and software, and also ergonomically sound.
[8] reported that usefulness of a system and the satisfaction
with its use were highly anticipated by test persons. These
expectations reduced after driving in a simulator with the
trafﬁc light assistance system. Another aspect is long-term
use of the system in addition to motivation to use it. Through
all stages of the project, human factors and ergonomics
plays a major role. It is here suggested to gather subjective
ratings from customers and users of systems both at an early
development stage and along the way. The next step is to
analyze the goals and tasks of the user, in order to gain a
better perspective on the additional tasks required by the use
of the system. The ﬁnal step is the technical implementation
of the system. Ergonomic and human factors is not a
discipline for quick usability tests in a late development
stage, but rather it must be involved from the beginning.
VII. OUTLOOK
Previous studies reviewed the trafﬁc light assistant in a
driving simulator and actually prototypically tested it in
real. The survey data documented in this paper will be
mentioned and related to the results found in these studies.
Recent experiments address the mental demands of a trafﬁc
light assistant, the gaze behavior and subjective measures.
