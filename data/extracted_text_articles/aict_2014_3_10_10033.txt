Abstract—Recently, cooperative communication has been 
proposed as an effective approach to enhance system 
performance 
in 
wireless 
networks. 
Cooperative 
communications fundamentally change the abstraction of a 
wireless link and offer significant potential advantages for 
wireless communication networks. In this paper, we propose a 
novel cooperative relay routing scheme based on the trust-based 
incentive mechanism. To maximize the network performance, 
the proposed scheme can take into account the measure of the 
probability of a relay node succeeding at a given relay service. 
By considering the current network condition, we can select the 
most adaptable relay node and pay the incentive-price for relay 
service. Evidences from simulations demonstrate that the 
proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes.

 INTRODUCTION 
Today, wireless communication systems are primarily 
designed based on point-to-point links whose performance is 
limited by the resources of a single transmitter. In particular, 
bandwidth and transmit power constraints often prevent a 
source node from achieving a desired data rate or 
communication range. Cooperative communications have 
emerged as a new novel approach that enables a source to tap 
into the available resources of local neighboring nodes in 
order to increase throughput, range and covertness [1]. 
Therefore, 
a 
cooperative 
communication 
improves 
performance in wireless systems, but it requires some nodes 
to expend energy acting as relays. Since energy is scarce, 
wireless nodes refuse to cooperate in order to conserve 
resources. However, only when relay node expends extra 
energy on its behalf, network performance can increase. Due 
to this realistic constraint, cooperative communication has yet 
to see widespread use in practical wireless systems [2]. 
Therefore, it is necessary to design incentive-aware relay 
routing algorithms for stimulating cooperation among nodes. 
But, despite the concerns, not much work has been done in 
this direction. In this article, we address this problem by 
examining the trust based incentive mechanism. In the 
proposed scheme, the attenuation window technique is 
adopted to estimate the trust value based on historical data [3]. 
Based on the individual trust value, we select an adaptive relay 
node and cooperative routing takes place with the help of the 
relay node, which is incentivized by the relay service price. To 
calculate the service price for a relay node, the basic concept 
of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism [4] is used.  
 
Usually, mechanisms that implement efficient social 
choice functions in environments in which participants have 
private information about their preferences have been studied 
extensively in the economics literature. A well-known class of 
such mechanisms are the VCG mechanisms [5]. It is a 
generalization of the famous Vickery auction where bidders 
submit written bids without knowing the bid of the other 
people in the auction. The important property of the VCG 
mechanism is that it is truthful; each bidder reveals his/her true 
value no matter what strategies the other bidder chooses. The 
main result in this setting provides an incentive compatible for 
the most natural social choice function [5]. 
  
In this work, the proposed scheme adapts in order to  
obtain the trust values in the real-time, online. This approach 
is able to select the relay node under dynamic changing 
wireless network environments; it is essential in order to 
maximize the network performance. Recently, several 
cooperative communication schemes – the Threshold based 
Cooperative Communication (TCC) scheme [6] and the 
Distributed Relay Routing (DRR) scheme [7] - have been 
presented for wireless network systems. This research 
implicates that cooperative communication is envisioned to 
achieve high diversity gain in terms of outage probability and 
outage capacity and scaling network capacity. The TCC 
scheme [6] is a new approach to relay selection using a 
threshold-based transmission protocol for a wireless system. 
The DRR scheme [7] is a decentralized and localized 
algorithm for joint dynamic routing, relay assignment, and 
spectrum allocation in a distributed and dynamic environment. 
All the earlier work has attracted a lot of attention and 
introduced unique challenges to efficiently solve the 
cooperative communication problem. Compared to these 
schemes [6][7], the proposed scheme attains better 
performance in cooperative communications. 
 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the 
proposed algorithms in detail. In Section III, performance 
evaluation results are presented along with comparisons with

Section IV.

PROPOSED COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATION 
ALGORITHM 
In this paper, trust-based VCG mechanism is used to 
design a new cooperative communication algorithm. Based 
on the trust value of each relay node, the most adaptable relay 
node is selected. To induce selfish relay nodes to participate 
cooperative communications, the relay service price is 
provided for the relay service. Finally, an effective solution 
can be obtained in the constantly changing environment.   
 
A. Trust Evaluation for Relay nodes 
 
In this paper, we assume a wireless network situation 
where there is a set (N) of potential relay nodes, N = 
{1,2..,i..,n}. Each relay node (i.e., i ∈ N) has a service value 
and privately-known relay cost of performing the service 
request 𝜏. Let 𝜎 denote a particular relay service acceptance 
within the space of possible acceptances 𝛹 and  τ𝑖 represent 
that the node i allows to relay call service 𝜏; 𝜎 ∈ 𝛹 and 𝛹 =
 {∅, τ1, τ2. . . τ𝑛}, where ∅ denotes the case where the relay 
request is rejected. If 𝛹 = {τ𝑖}, the relay node i participates 
the cooperative communication. The set of available power 
levels (𝕊) for each relay node is assumed as below.  
 
𝕊 = {Π𝑖∈𝑁𝑝𝑖|𝑝𝑖 ∈ [𝑝𝑚𝑖𝑛, 𝑝 𝑚𝑎𝑥]}               (1) 
 
where 𝑝𝑖 is the power level of relay node i. The 𝑝𝑚𝑖𝑛, 𝑝 𝑚𝑎𝑥 
are the pre-defined minimum and maximum power levels, 
respectively. Each relay node selects a power level from the 
𝕊, and estimates the expected value (𝑣𝑖(𝜏)) as follows. 
 
𝑣𝑖(𝜏) = (𝑊 × log2 (1 + 𝛾𝑖(ℙ)
Ω )) 𝑝𝑖
⁄
 
s.t.,  𝛾𝑖(ℙ) =
𝑝𝑖ℎ𝑖𝑖
𝜗𝑖+∑
𝑗≠𝑖 𝑝𝑗ℎ𝑗𝑖
                    (2) 
 
where ℙ is the power level vector for all nodes and W is the 
channel bandwidth of relay node i, and Ω (Ω ≥ 1) is the gap 
between uncoded M-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation 
(M-QAM) and the capacity, minus the coding gain [6]. 
Usually, service value is defined as the number of 
information bits that are transmitted without error per unit-
time. In wireless networks, it can be achieved with the Signal 
to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) in the effective range. 
Therefore, to estimate the service value, the SINR should be 
obtained. The  𝛾𝑖(ℙ) is a general formula for the relay i’s 
SINR, where 𝜗𝑖 is the background noise within the relay node 
i’s bandwidth, ℎ𝑗𝑖 is the path gain from the node j to the node 
i [8]. 
 
Under a dynamically changing network environment, 
there exists uncertainty about relay nodes successfully 
completing their assigned relay services. In the proposed 
scheme, we take into account the trust value (T) of relay 
nodes. 𝑇𝑖(𝑡) is the relay node i’s trust value at the time t. After 
the tth iteration, 𝑇𝑖(𝑡)  is using the number of packets 
successfully serviced in the relay node i (𝛼𝑡
𝑖) divided by the 
total number of packets that have been sent from the source 
node to the relay node i (𝛼𝑡
𝑖 + 𝛽𝑡
𝑖). 
 
  𝑇𝑖(𝑡) =
𝛼𝑡
𝑖
𝛼𝑡
𝑖 + 𝛽𝑡
𝑖                                     (3) 
 
𝑇𝑖(𝑡) is a general average function over the whole span of 
communication historical records. However, for a long-term 
period evaluation, the 𝛼𝑡
𝑖 and 𝛽𝑡
𝑖 will be accumulated and are 
growing into a very large value. In such case, a small amount 
of the recent malicious behaviours will be hard to be counted 
and thus has impact on the overall rating of trust. To solve 
this problem, attenuation window was introduced [3]. By 
considering more on the up-to-date records, we can calculate 
the trust value (𝑇𝑖(𝑡)) while fade away the out-of-date records. 
Based on the attenuation window, the 𝛼𝑡
𝑖 and 𝛽𝑡
𝑖 values is 
obtained as below.  
 
𝛼𝑡
𝑖 = ∑ ℯ
−(𝑛+𝑚−𝑡(𝜆)
𝑐
)
𝑛
𝜆=𝑘
                                 
 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝛽𝑡
𝑖 = ∑ ℯ
−(𝑛+𝑚−𝑡(𝜆)
𝑐
)
𝑚
𝜆=𝑗
                     (4) 
 
where the e is Euler’s constant, and c is the coefficient to 
adjust the speed of decreasing in the results of 𝛼𝑡
𝑖 and 𝛽𝑡
𝑖. The 
n and m are the total number of successfully serviced and 
non-successfully serviced packets, respectively. The k and j 
are the most out-of-date time for successfully serviced and 
non-successfully serviced packets, respectively. 𝑡(𝜆) is the 
time t when 𝜆 occurs. For example, there are 3 successful 
service records regarding to the packet relaying but 2 non-
successful service records, i.e., n=3 and m=2. Here, the 
successful service time set are t = {1, 3, 5} and non-
successful service time set are t = {2, 4}. Thus the k=1 and 
j=2. As the time t is from ascending order that it reflects from 
oldest to latest in time sequence [2]. While t is growing bigger 
and bigger, the value of (n+m-t) will become smaller and 
smaller, and finally ℯ−(𝑛+𝑚−𝑡
𝑐
) has a strong impact on the 
recent information. Moreover, the bigger value of coefficient 
c, the slower in speed of decreasing slopes of the value in 
ℯ−(𝑛+𝑚−𝑡
𝑐
) between 0 and 1. In such way, attenuation window 
can emphasize the most up-to-date records and fade away the 
out-of-date records by the speed controlled by the coefficient 
c.

B. Relay Selection and Relay Service Price Computation 
 
The proposed scheme adopts the basic concept of T-VCG 
mechanism to provide a normative guide for the payments of 
relay service [4]. Even more importantly, we consider the 
trust value in computing the relay payment. With the 
estimated trust value, the expected payoff value of relay node, 
𝜒̅(𝜏, 𝜎, 𝕋), can be calculated as:  
 
𝜒̅(𝜏, 𝜎, 𝕋) = 𝑣𝜎(𝜏) × 𝑇𝜎(𝜏),  s.t., 𝜎 ∈ 𝛹                  (5) 
  
where 𝑣𝜎(𝜏)  is the expected value with relay task 𝜏  and 
𝑇𝜎(𝜏) is the trust value in the selected relay node 𝜎, which 
performs the requested relay service 𝜏. To implement the 
execution uncertainty by a given relay node, the network 
system needs to require relay nodes to report their trust value. 
𝕋 = 〈𝑇1(𝜏) …  𝑇𝜎(𝜏) … 𝑇𝑛(𝜏)〉 is the vector of trust values of 
all the relay nodes. In this paper, 𝕋̂ represents the vector of 
reported trust values 〈𝕋̂1(𝜏), … , 𝕋̂𝑛(𝜏)〉; the superscripting 
the latter with ‘^’ indicates that nodes can misreport their true 
types. With the expected payoff value, service execution cost 
is necessary to estimate the total profit. The cost function 
defines the instantaneous expense for the relaying service 𝜎. 
It would be a linear function of the tower level, and given by 
K × (𝑝𝜎)𝑞, where K and q are estimation parameters and 𝑝𝜎 
is the power level for the 𝜎 service. 
 
In the proposed scheme, relay connections are adaptively 
controlled based on the accurate analysis of costs and payoffs 
to select the most suitable relay node. In more detail, the relay 
selection is determined as follows to maximize system 
efficiency.  
 
      𝑆∗(𝛹, 𝕋̂) = 𝑎𝑟𝑔 max
𝜎∈𝛹  [𝜒̅(𝜏, 𝜎, 𝕋̂) − 𝐾 × (𝑝̂𝜎)𝑞]     (6) 
 
In the real world operation, 𝕋 and 𝑝𝜎 can be misreported (i.e., 
𝕋̂ and 𝑝̂𝜎). After selecting a relay node, the next step is to 
compute the relay price, which is an incentive to encourage 
relay communications. In this paper, the relay service price is 
similar to that of the traditional VCG mechanism in that the 
marginal contribution of the selected relay node to the 
wireless network system; it is extracted by comparing the 
second best decision, excluding the selected relay node. 
Without the best relay node 𝑆∗(𝛹, 𝕋̂) , the second-best 
expected payoff for the relay service (𝐸𝑈𝜎∈𝛹−𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)(𝛹, 𝕋̂)) 
is given by 
 
𝐸𝑈𝜎∈𝛹−𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)(𝛹, 𝕋̂) =
max
𝜎∈𝛹−𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)
(𝜒̅(𝜏, 𝜎, 𝕋̂) − 𝐾
× (𝑝̂𝜎)𝑞)                                                      (7) 
 
where 𝛹−𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)  is the set of possible acceptances ( 𝛹) 
excluding the best relay node 𝑆∗(𝛹, 𝕋̂). If the selected relay 
node (𝑆∗(𝛹, 𝕋̂)) can success to provide relay service, the 
relay service price (𝑅𝑆𝑃𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)) is achieved based on the 
expected marginal contribution, which is the difference 
between the best and the second-best expected payoff. 
 
 𝑅𝑆𝑃𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂) = [𝜒̅(𝜏, 𝑆∗(𝛹, 𝕋̂), 𝕋̂) − 𝐾 × (𝑝̂ 𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂))𝑞]
− 𝐸𝑈𝜎∈𝛹−𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)(𝛹, 𝕋̂)                             (8) 
 
Sometimes, the selected relay node (i.e., 𝑆∗(𝛹, 𝕋̂)) can fail to 
provide relay service. In this case, the 𝑅𝑆𝑃𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂) is given by. 
 
 𝑅𝑆𝑃𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂) = − 𝐸𝑈𝜎∈𝛹−𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)(𝛹, 𝕋̂)                   (9) 
 
Finally, 𝑅𝑃𝑖(ℂ̂, ℙ̂, 𝜎)  can be obtained as follows by 
considering success and fail cases . 
 
𝑅𝑆𝑃𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂) = 𝑇𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)(𝑡) 
× ([𝜒̅(𝜏, 𝑆∗(𝛹, 𝕋̂), 𝕋̂) − 𝐾 × (𝑝̂ 𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂))
𝑞
] 
−𝐸𝑈𝜎∈𝛹−𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)(𝛹, 𝕋̂)) 
+ (1 − 𝑇𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)(𝑡)) × [− 𝐸𝑈𝜎∈𝛹−𝑆∗(𝛹,𝕋̂)(𝛹, 𝕋̂)   ] (10) 
 
III. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
In this section, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is 
validated through simulation. Recently, the TCC scheme [6] 
and the DRR scheme [5] have been published and introduced 
unique challenges for cooperative communications. Using a 
simulation model, we compare the performance of the 
proposed scheme with these existing schemes to confirm the 
superiority of the proposed approach. The assumptions 
implemented in simulation model are as follows. Each relay 
service is considered Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic with 
having a different deadline. In order to adaptively adjust the 
control parameters, we partition the time-axis into equal 
intervals of length (i.e., a short time duration). Every interval, 
the current system condition is examined periodically by a 
real-time online approach, and the performance measures 
obtained on the basis of 50 simulation runs. Relay transmitters 
use variable-rate M-QAM, with a bounded probability of 
symbol error and trellis coding with a nominal coding gain. 
Table 1 shows the system parameters used in the simulation.  
 
For dynamically changing network environments, the 
design goal of the proposed scheme is to improve the overall 
network performance. Figures 1 and 2 show the performance 
comparison for the network throughput and energy efficiency, 
respectively. All the schemes have similar trends. However, 
the proposed scheme constantly monitors the current network 
condition and effectively operates relay routing through the 
trust based incentive mechanism. Under various network

scheme is better than the other schemes.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
With the rapid growth of mobile Internet, offering 
seamless connectivity and high-speed multimedia services in 
different types of wireless networks are important features in 
next generation wireless networks (4G networks). For next-
generation wireless networks, cooperative communication is 
an emerging technology to overcome the current limitations 
of traditional wireless systems. This promising technique has 
been considered in the IEEE 802.16 standard, and is expected 
to be integrated into LTE multi-hop cellular network. In this 
paper, we have introduced a new trust-based incentive relay 
routing algorithm for wireless networks. Based on the trust-
based VCG mechanism, the proposed algorithm dynamically 
estimates relay nodes’ trust levels and adaptively selects the 
most adaptable relay node for the data transmission. Moreover, 
we suggest the new trust estimation mechanism. Our model is 
designed to adapt to various changes, such as changes in trust 
behaviors and trust accuracy requirement. Usually, traditional 
routing methods cannot solve the problem of malicious 
behavior and build the trusted transfers route between nodes. 
In the proposed scheme, the subjective confidence for the 
routing behavior has transform into trust evaluation with the 
probability model to solve the trust measurement and routing. 
Simulation results clearly indicate that the proposed algorithm 
generally exhibits superior performance compared with the 
other existing schemes. Future work in progress is to study 
efficient power control and relay selection schemes for green 
cooperative communications based on the game theory.
