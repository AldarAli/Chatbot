Abstract—The combination of MIMO with wideband (WB)
and ultra-wideband (UWB) systems imply many new effects,
which make the conventional channel models developed for
narrowband transmissions to be inadequate for communications
with large bandwidth. In this paper we use the Fourier analysis
of the cross-correlation functions (CCF)s between the space-
time-frequency (STF) transfer functions of two sub-channels
of an outdoor WB/UWB MIMO wireless channel to derive
the power spectral density (PSD) in a stationary scenario. The
assumptions of the stationary scenario transform the MIMO
channel into a Multiple-In Single-Out (MISO) channel and the
PSD is determined when the channel bandwidth is wide or
ultra-wide. The Fourier analysis of the CCF reveals the fact that
the PSD deviates from the U-shaped function, i.e., Clarke/Jake’s
model to a great extent. This deviation is strongly inﬂuenced
by the antenna directivity and the channel bandwidth. One
major phenomenon which become stronger when the bandwidth
increases is the frequency selectivity which is obviously larger
in case of UWB channels than in case of WB channels. This
characteristic makes possible the recognition of the type of the
channel for its bandwidth from its PSD only.

I. INTRODUCTION
The design of high performance wideband (WB) and ultra-
wideband (UWB) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
wireless systems, requires accurate prediction of the impact
of random multipath propagation and reliable MIMO channel
models which take into account the impact of the direction-of-
departure (DOD), direction-of arrival (DOA), time of arrival
(TOA) and the system bandwidth [2], [3].
The cross-correlation function (CCF) of two sub-channels of
an outdoor WB/UWB MIMO wireless channel [1] is used to
determine the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of WB and UWB
channels in a stationary scenario. The mathematical set-up of
the stationary scenario transforms the MIMO channel into a
Multiple-In Single-Out (MISO) channel. We analyzed a sta-
tionary MISO channel as a special case of MIMO channel. The
PSD is derived for outdoor channels, when omnidirectional
and directional antennas are employed at the mobile station
(MS), in a 2D non-isotropic propagation environment. The
CCF expression is based on the space-time-frequency (STF)
channel transfer functions (CTF) which is represented by a
sum of cluster waves over a number of dominant paths . We
derive the PSD using the Fourier analysis of the CCF of MIMO
channels. In the literature are other works which present
results obtained by using the classical approach that applies
the direct Fourier relation between the correlation and the
PSD [2], [3]. The majority of these models employ a speciﬁc
geometry for the scatterers around the MS [4], [5], [6]. Based
on this approach each model is just capable to predict the
behavior of that particular propagation scenario [8]. Moreover,
they are not able to investigate the spatial, the temporal, and
the frequency aspects of the wireless channel in one single
model. Alternatively in this paper, we do not assume a certain
geometry to describe the relative distribution of scatterers in
the space. We establish a mathematical relation between the
random time-delay and the random channel-gain associated
with each scattered waveform within each cluster and use
appropriate pdfs for the parameters such as the time-delay,
the DOA and the DOD. As a result the derived PSD is based
on a non-geometry approach, describing the non-isotropic
propagation by using appropriate pdfs for the parameters such
as the time-delay, DOA and DOD. The expression of the PSD
is the Fourier transform of a linear series expansion of a
number of Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind. The coefﬁcients
of the expansion of the PSD are described by three categories
of Fourier series coefﬁcients (FSC): a) linear convolution of
the FSC of the antenna pattern, b) the FSC of the azimuth
angular spread and c) the Fourier series expansion (FSE) of
the pdfs describing the non-isotropic environment.
This paper is organized as follows: the 2D channel model is
described in Section 2. In Section 3, the mathematical model
of the CCF it is presented. In Section 4, the PSD equation
is derived and it is numerically evaluated under different
circumstances. Conclusions are presented in Section 5.

We also emphasize the differences which exist between WB
and UWB channel models and how these differences are
included in our model.

When n → ∞, fΘM (Θ) = δ (Θ − µ), the propagation
environment is considered extreme non-isotropic scattering
concentrated at Θ = µ, where µ ∈ [−π, π) is the mean DOA
at the MS. For large n, say n ⩾ 3 we have a typical non-
isotropic environment [10]. When FSCs are determined the
parameter n appears as the argument of the Bessel functions,
where Jk (·) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind
and J0 (·) is the zero-order modiﬁed Bessel function.
Figure 2 compares the FSCs of Laplace and von Mises
pdf (at the MS). For the von-Mises distribution, FSCs are
presented when the propagation environment has two different
orders of non-isotropy.

different orders of non-isotropy n = 3, 10) determined to have
a good match to the real pdf for the non-isotropic propagation
Comparing the distributions in Figure 2, we see that the
necessary number of FSCs for the Laplace pdf is larger than
the necessary number of FSCs for the von-Mises pdf. One can
observe that the required number of the FSCs increases when
the non-isotropic characteristic of the propagation environment
becomes more pronounced.
E3) The most signiﬁcant effect for WB/UWB channels
is the different attenuation that the sub-bands undergo. This
phenomenon is known as frequency selectivity.
In our model the frequency selectivity of the radio channel
is characterized by the term

In the resulted CTF each l cluster, and implicitly each i
wave, is associated with a path attenuation gain, gpm,il, a path
phase shift, ψil, a time-varying delay, τpm,il.The Doppler shift
of the ith received wave, within the lth cluster, is represented
by ωil = ω
c V T ΘM
il where V and c are the MS velocity vector
and the speed of light, respectively.

The
CCF
expression
of
the
TFs,
hpm (t1, ω1)
and
hqn (t2, ω2), of two arbitrary sub-channels of a MIMO channel
is the result of the following deﬁnition:
Rpm,qn (t1, t2, ω1, ω2) ≜ E

hpm (t1, ω1) h∗
qn (t2, ω2)

(6)
In the CCF expression are three dimensions: space, two
pairs of antenna elements (p, m, q, n), time (t1, t2), and cen-
tral frequencies (ω1, ω2). According to these three dimensions,
we call it STF-CCF. The expectation operation is performed
over all introduced random variables. In the presence of
enough number of multi-paths by invoking the central limit
theorem the TF can be considered a Gaussian random process.
Therefore, the above second-order statistics fully characterize
statistical behavior of the channel.
By replacing (5) in (6), regrouping dependent and indepen-
dent random variables, using the elements described in E1-E6
and the results presented in [1] the CCF results in the following
expression:
Rpm,qn = (t1, t2, ω1, ω2)

i) the non-isotropic propagation environment around the MS
is represented by Laplace and von-Mises distributions,
ii) the WB and UWB antennas employed at the MS side
are represented by the helical and rectangular APPs,
iii) the direction of the MS speed is on the positive x-axis
or the positive y-axis direction.
Analyzing the presented results we observe that three of the
most important parameters which inﬂuences the PSD shape
are APPs, the pdf of the propagation directions, the mobile
speed direction and the channel bandwidth. The following
observations can be formulated:
• For both WB and UWB channels, the maximum Doppler
shift is ω
c |V | (i.e., RM (Λ) = 0, if |Λ| ⩾ ω
c |V |).
• These results are consistent with the results proposed
in [8], [13], [14]. In [8] it is presented the PSD of a
narrowband channel in non-isotropic 2D propagation. The
results presented in this work are similar to the PSD
shape we obtained for WB channels. Between our results
and the results presented in [8] there are similarities
regarding the U-shape of the PSD but there are also
differences determined by parameters characteristic to
wideband channels like frequency selectivity, higher cen-
tral frequency and APPs typically used for these types of
channels. Comparing the PSD obtained for WB channels
with those obtain for UWB channels, and even with those
obtained for narrowband channels in [8] we can conclude
that the channel bandwidth has a great inﬂuence on the
PSD shape. When the bandwidth increases the channel
frequency selectivity also increases and larger variations
can be observed over the PSD anvelope. The increased
frequency selectivity is obviously larger in case of UWB
channels than in case of WB channels. This feature offers
the possibility to recognize the type of the channel for its
bandwidth from its PSD only.
• It is clear that the majority of incoming/outgoing waves
do travel in nearly horizontal directions and when the
APP is directed along the vehicle motion the PSD has an
asymmetrical shape. This is what it can be observed in
our results: in Figure 3 when MS moves in the positive
direction of the x-axis the PSD is larger at positive Λ than
at negative Λ. This phenomenon is the consequence of
the interaction between the beam of the antenna pattern,
the direction of the MS speed, and the distribution of the
propagation directions around the MS. This asymmetry
of the PSD, is also determined by the Doppler spectrum
which concentrates towards positive frequency axis.
• In Figure 4.4 all the PSD curves are symmetrical around
the axis Λ = 0, because the pdf of the path directions
and the APPs are symmetrical around ΘM = 0, and are
perpendicular toward the speed direction.
• Generally speaking the PSD resulted for WB channels is
less ﬂuctuating than the PSD resulted for UWB channels.
These ﬂuctuations in the shape of the PSD of WB/UWB
channels is the consequence of the frequency selectivity
which increases with the signal frequency and signal
bandwidth.

V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we investigated the impact of the non-uniform
distribution of scatterers along with the non-omnidirectional
APPs on the PSD for a 2D-WB/UWB MISO channel. The
PSD is the result of the Fourier analysis of the CCF in a
stationary case. It was observed that the PSD deviates from
the U-shaped function, i.e., Clarke/Jake model. This deviation
depends on the AAS, the employed antennas, and the direction
of the MS speed. The results also prove that the range of
frequencies over which the channel operates as well as the
channel bandwidth have a great impact on the behavior of
these characteristics.
