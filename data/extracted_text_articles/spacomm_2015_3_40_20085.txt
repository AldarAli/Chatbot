Abstract— In this paper, an integrated active phased array 
multi-beam antenna system model including a nonlinear model 
of the amplifier and a digital pre-distortion linearizer is 
introduced and validated by simulation. To investigate 
nonlinearity effects in a phased-array antenna, a two-beam, 
three-beam, and five-beam S-band arrays are simulated and 
the results of the proposed system model are analyzed. The 
presented model is able to precisely predict the inter-
modulation products with an accuracy of 1 dB in power with 
small fraction of a degree in direction. The effect of integrating 
a digital pre-distortion linearizer is to enhance the efficiency of 
antenna array transmission power amplifiers. Therefore, the 
model can be used as a tool to accurately predict the inter-
modulation 
patterns 
for 
multi-beam 
satellite 
array 
applications, avoiding excessive system margin and reducing 
DC power consumption.

 INTRODUCTION 
    Modern satellite communication payloads require high 
directivity and multiple beams with large signal bandwidth 
to satisfy broad-band applications, such as multimedia and 
voice conferences. Therefore, an active phased array is ideal 
for such applications, since they can be configured in orbit to 
provide the bandwidth in demand and increase overall 
system utilization [1]-[3].      
    The total transmission quality of a communication satellite 
using a multi-beam phased-array antenna system is most 
dependent upon the nonlinear distortion of the Solid State 
Power Amplifier (SSPA) modules [2]. This distortion brings 
about Inter-Modulation (IM) interferences. The closer to the 
compression point in order to have the most power efficiency 
means more IM product levels that degrade Carrier-to-
Interference ratio (C/I) associated with beam steering 
direction. So, accurate modeling of these IM beams helps to 
control the IM interference, thus allowing the SSPAs to be 
operated with minimum back-off since fewer margins are 
needed. This results in a more efficient array that requires a 
lower system DC power with reduced mass and cost of the 
satellite [3].  
    Inter-Modulation Products (IMPs) in an active antenna 
array have characteristics that are different from those in 
lumped active circuits and systems. For multi-beam satellite 
digital communication systems, signal suppression and IMP 
interference in amplifiers may degrade the bit-error rate 1 to 
5 dB in comparison to passive antennas. The presence of 
interfering signals may result in an increase of the array 
beam width, sidelobe level, null depth degradation, as well as 
changing the null positions [2]. Sandrin [4] previously 
analyzed the radiating patterns of third and fifth orders IM 
products of active antenna arrays. In his analysis, he derived 
the phase gradient for the m-th order intermodes and used 
generic 
transfer 
functions 
for 
modeling 
nonlinear 
characteristics of the power amplifier. His analysis 
incorporates approximations appropriate for limited field of 
view arrays (as in the case of an earth-looking antenna on a 
geosynchronous 
satellite) 
and 
for 
small 
percentage 
bandwidth. Kohls [2] presented simulation and experimental 
results for KU band arrays. Bessel series function 
approximation is used to fit the above-mentioned model of a 
KU-band array for predicting third-order IM product beam 
patterns. Meanwhile, Maalouf et al. [3] studied IM 
estimation in an active phased-array theoretically and 
experimentally. 
    All of these studies involved narrow band signals. This 
implies that the amplifier characteristics are frequency 
independent over the frequency band of interest. However, 
while having broadband input signals, or systems including 
wide-band 
amplifiers 
and 
relatively 
narrow-band 
components, a frequency-dependent quadrature model is 
required [5]. Johari et al. [6] introduced an amplifier model 
with 
considering 
frequency-dependent 
parameters 
to 
investigate nonlinearity effects in a phased-array antenna and 
validate the model by experimental data. 
    For base stations, the major issue is linearity, as the 
down-link signal must be highly-linear in order to achieve a 
small error rate and a good quality of reception in mobile 
terminals.  Power amplification of RF signals faces a 
problem of achieving high linearity and efficiency at the 
same time. Efficiency is maximized when a PA operates 
with a small back-off, i.e., close to the saturation region. 
However, in this mode of operation, nonlinear distortions 
are produced, which degrade the system linearity. It means 
that efficiency and linearity are mutually exclusive 
requirements. A trade-off between them is usually sought 
for each particular application [7][8]. 
    Linearization techniques for nonlinear microwave power 
amplifiers have been around for decades, ranging from 
analog techniques such as feed forward linearization [8][9] 
and Cartesian loop feedback correction [8], to digital

techniques such as digital pre-distortion linearization [8]-
[10]. 
    This paper consists of eight sections. In Section II, the 
used power amplifier model in the integration process is 
introduced. Then, the mathematical modeling of IM 
products is calculated in Section III. Next, the model of 
radiation farfield pattern is considered in Section IV; a 
digital pre-distortion linearizer is explained in Section V, 
and finally the functionality of the proposed integrated 
system is introduced in section VI. The simulated results are 
presented in Section VII, and conclusions are given in 
Section VIII. 
II. 
NONLINEAR SSPA MODEL 
    Using a complex envelope instead of real narrow band 
signals; thus, there is no carrier information in the complex 
envelope except the modulation information is the main idea 
of quadrature modeling technique. This point is important 
from the viewpoint of computational efficiency. In the 
SSPA model, its characteristics are modeled with series of 
Bessel function coefficients [4] because of their ability to 
quickly converge to the nonlinear characteristics of the 
amplifier and model the IM products at the output of the 
amplifier. The mathematical model provides the gain and 
phase insertion of each carrier and IM component at the 
output of the SSPA; therefore, it is suitable to incorporate 
into the antenna phased-array model. Therefore, this method 
can achieve the necessary accuracy for active phased array 
systems [4][7]. 
    The nonlinear behavior of the amplifier can be expressed 
by the following Bessel function series [7]: 
 
              𝗀𝗀(ρ)𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗 𝜑𝜑 (𝜌𝜌 ) = ∑
𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠𝐽𝐽1( 𝛼𝛼 𝑠𝑠 𝜌𝜌 )
𝐿𝐿
𝑠𝑠=1
                        (1)          
where ρ, 𝗀𝗀(ρ), and 𝜑𝜑 (𝜌𝜌 ) denote the amplitude of the input 
tone and measured AM/AM and AM/PM single-tone 
characteristics, respectively.  𝐽𝐽1 is the Bessel function of the 
first kind with order 1; 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠, 𝛼𝛼, and 𝑠𝑠 are the complex number, 
the real number, and an integer, respectively. The
                   
 appendix 
in [7] shows in detail how the parameters 𝑠𝑠 and 𝛼𝛼 are 
chosen to evaluate 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠, by a linear search method. Once 𝑠𝑠 
and  𝛼𝛼 are selected, 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠is calculated to separately satisfy the 
real and imaginary parts of (1). In particular, the solution to 
the following two equations uses the least-squares method

fixed, both equations in (2) are quadratic minimization 
problems in 𝛽𝛽𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 (𝑠𝑠)and 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖  (𝑠𝑠) with known analytical 
solutions. Equation (2) is solved for several (𝑠𝑠, 𝛼𝛼) pairs, and 
the solution with the lowest residual error is kept. The final 
model coefficients are given by  𝛽𝛽(𝑠𝑠) = 𝛽𝛽𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 (𝑠𝑠) + 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 (𝑠𝑠)  
    This section investigates the effects of IM upon the 
performance of a K-element planar phased-array antenna 
satellite communication system. In an array, the input single 
of the k-th amplifier of the array can be represented by [6]:

    The radiation pattern of the array is modeled analytically 
as the product of the element pattern and the array factor, 
assuming identical element patterns over the array and no 
mutual coupling. These assumptions are relatively accurate 
for patch elements with distances of 1.5 times greater than 
lambda, which are considered in the modeling. Furthermore, 
it is assumed that the fundamental TM10 mode is 
propagating in the microstrip patch antenna. Here, the 
radiating elements are modeled in an array environment, and 
the array factor’s farfield radiation patterns are calculated 
for both the carriers and IM products based on excitation 
coefficients generated by the IM algorithm. The farfield 
array factor radiation pattern Pp(θ) for each component in 
any spatial direction is given by the coherent sum of the 
corresponding SSPA output component given in (7), 
expressed as[6]:

 LINEARIZER  MODEL 
 ) defines the 
spatial beam directions in spherical coordinates for the n-th 
beam [3]. 
    As processing power has become cheaper and more 
powerful over the last two decades, mainly due to the great 
advances in Digital Signal Processing (DSP), digital pre-
distortion linearization has become one of, if not the most 
cost 
efficient 
linearization 
technique 
available 
for 
microwave power amplifiers [8]-[10]. The overall goal is to 
design a block which compensates for nonlinear effects 
present in the power amplifier in digital baseband, allowing 
to utilize digital signal processing techniques to achieve 
great precision [9]. Prior to designing a digital pre-distorter, 
a model of the nonlinear microwave power amplifier is 
often required in order to estimate its inverse. the next step 
is to estimate the model parameters, either by an direct 
approach with least squares methods, or by an  adaptive or 
iterative approach, i.e.,  using an adaptive filter such as the 
Least Mean Square (LMS) filter [10], or the Recursive Least 
Square (RLS) filter [10]. 
    The Digital Pre-Distortion technique (DPD) has high 
efficiency, 
adaptability 
and 
good 
inter-modulation 
suppression as it is operated before the power amplifier, 
which means the signal processing does not consume large 
power [8]-[10]. 
    The best way to solve this problem is to use the discrete 
time form of Horison model which takes the following 
mathematical model [10]:

To compensate for the distortions introduced by the 
amplifier in the amplified baseband signal, it can be shown 
that according to Horison model (8), there exists an exact 
inversion [10]. Indeed, from (8), it follows that [10]:

, have 
been chosen to be spline functions, in particular, piecewise 
linear splines and the cubic parabola (third degree 
polynomial). 
    A functional block diagram of the proposed integrated 
active phased antenna array transmission system is shown in 
Figure 1. It consists of M radiating elements, M Solid State 
Power Amplifiers (SSPAs), and N  independent beamformer 
channels and M attenuators and phase shifters for each 
beamformer. The proposed integrated model functionality 
can be described briefly as following: 
• Antenna array radiating elements:  form the antenna 
aperture and consist of a set of identical  near-omni-
directional radiators (dipole, slot, horn, waveguide), 
usually located in the form of  right-angled or skew-
angled nodes; 
• Power amplifier modules: are usually implemented in 
the form of  electric vacuum or solid-state devices, 
which are connected directly to the antenna elements in 
order to eliminate the need for RF feeder line at a high 
power level, and thereby significantly reduce the high-
frequency loss; 
• Linearizer module: is responsible for the transmission 
factor adjustment (the gain and the phase) of each power 
amplifier module via linearization of PA  characteristics, 
which in turns achieves a higher efficiency performance 
due to the enhancement of power losses, which are 
generated by IM signals; 
• The central microprocessor:  determines the complex 
coefficients of transmission channels in accordance with 
a predetermined shape and position of the antenna array 
pattern in the space, which are determined by beam 
pattern control unit and simultaneously an adaptive 
monitoring of PAs outputs is achieved via a command 
control program within the linearizer module. The output 
signals are multiplied with the vector of coefficients that 
take into account the internal state of the system 
(failures, amplitude and phase calibration) for correction 
of antenna array pattern; 
• Modulator: adaptive phased antenna array emitted 
signals can be modulated in the excitation stage or at PA 
elements;

• Beam pattern control unit:  generates the necessary 
distribution of amplitudes and phases of the input signals 
to the array radiation elements. This system comprises a 
set of power amplifiers, a set of phase shifters and a set 
of matching circuits. Each radiator element is connected 
in series with the matching circuit, power amplifier and 
phase shifter to form a single adaptive phased array 
channel. Usually, all channel elements are combined into 
a unitary structure which is called a module; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Amplitude and phase control unit: generates the required 
phase and amplitude distribution of excitation signals. 
Usually it consists of a set of controlled delay lines or 
phase shifters, and attenuators; 
• Input power distribution unit: can be implemented in a 
passive or active forms. Passive type is based on the 
parallel, serial, or other multilevel scheme by using 
different types of power dividers (feeder excitation) or 
by the optical system (spatial excitation). Active type is 
intended to be included at different levels (stages) of 
cascaded amplifiers. Active types are used in cases when 
the excitation power is not sufficient to excite all PAs of 
adaptive phased array system, or when it is required  to 
build an array by using the same active devices, i.e.,  
unifying or standardizing  them; 
• Matching devices, such as impedance transformers and 
non-dissipative stubs, which have been installed to 
reduce the reflection losses from the antenna array 
radiators in the scan mode (or changing the array 
radiation pattern) and providing stable operating 
conditions at PAs outputs; 
• Non-reciprocal devices - valves or circulators can be 
installed for isolation PAs and radiators; 
• In addition, the construction of any adaptive phased 
array systems may include some other units such as; 
power supply, functional check control and cooling 
units, where the construction of adaptive phased antenna 
array system are mainly based on three factors:             
the location of the phase shifters in each transmitter sub-
channel, the number of distribution systems, and the 
presence of cascaded PA conversion (frequency 
multiplication stages). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VII. SIMULATION RESULTS  
    In this paper, a five-beam S-band array has been studied, 
which is comprised of sixteen patch antenna elements in a 
1x16 configuration. The amplifier characterization is 
described by measuring the single tone AM/AM and 
AM/PM of a subset of the SSPAs with frequency 3.5 GHz 
to represent the nonlinear response of the PA element. Then, 
the amplifier is modeled as described in Section II with ten 
terms of Bessel function series. The agreement between the 
measured and predicted amplitude and phase characteristics 
is shown in Figure 2.

nonlinear amplifier model [7] and digital pre-distortion 
linearizer model based on getting PA inverse by using 
Horison model. Also, the array farfield parameters, side 
lobe, and IM patterns are considered in the proposed 
integrated model. This analysis presents that IM interference 
can be predicted accurately, which enable controlling its 
effects in multi-beam phased-array satellite system. Hence, 
it reduces the necessary excessive margin. Therefore, with 
this reduction, the transmission power consumption will be 
decreased, and consequently, satellite power consumption 
and mass will be reduced.
