Abstract—A new generation of children, called “digital 
natives”, live in a world where technology is forever being used 
in their daily lives. Digital media, such as games and 
applications, are increasingly being designed with kids in 
mind. However, interface and icon design for kids are not just 
a matter of simplification or scaling-up buttons. Children 
should not be dumbed down during the design process. Given 
that children’s cognitive abilities vary at different ages, it’s 
imperative to avoid assumption of an icon or image will be 
targeting all ages. Designing for a 4-year-old may not be age 
appropriate for a 7-year-old. This paper discusses how to 
design icons for children from 4 to 6, on user interfaces, by 
investigating cognitive development theory and applying the 
concept of user-centered design into children-centered design. 
Along with that, it will compare different user interfaces on 
different media platforms like applications, games, and 
websites for kids. With the children’s unique characteristics at 
different ages in mind, designers can address age-appropriate 
design to those characteristics. 
Keywords-icon design; children; cognitive development. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Many media research studies have shown that children 
have become a large user group for digital products such as 
websites, applications, and video games. A report from 
Common Sense Media in 2013 pointed out that 72% of 
children under 8 years old in the United States own a mobile 
device for a different purpose [1]. Under such circumstance, 
younger users need more appropriate interface design.  
However, as some studies have pointed out, it is not hard to 
find general guidelines for interface design, but only a few 
have responded to the development world of today’s children 
[2][3][4][5]. We cannot design for children just based on 
intuition or memories from adult’s childhood [6]. The new 
generation of children thinks and processes information 
fundamentally different from their predecessors [7]. A study 
from Andrew Large and Jamshid Beheshti suggested that 
specific interface design guidelines are required for kids 
rather than just relying on general design guidelines [4]. 
When working with children, they do not always follow 
the strict requirements of experimental procedures, so the 
completion rates and data collection of this subject pool are 
usually not ideal [8]. This problem makes interface design 
for these “digital natives [7]” more challenging for designers. 
To crack this hard nut, designers should better understand 
their intended small-age users’ characteristics [10]. Piaget’s 
theory about the four stages of cognitive development may 
help us know why children behave differently at different 
age.  
The purpose of this paper is to employ findings from 
literature review to investigate some specific guidelines for 
icon and interface design for 4 to 6 year old by adopting 
children’s cognitive development theory and user-centered 
design concept. The main reason to choose this age group is 
that they have been missing from most literature [8]. Lots of 
relevant studies focus on children older than 7 year old.  
There are mainly three parts in this paper. Section II 
discusses the importance of icon and interface design for 
children; design for children is different from design for 
adults. According to Piaget’s development stage theory, 
Section III explains why design icon and interface for 
children should take different age segments into account. 
Section IV lists some problems in current icon design for 
children and attempts to incorporate user-centered design 
concept in the procedure of design for children users.  Other 
than that, it provides some specific guidelines for icon and 
interface design for children. 
II. 
ICON AND INTERFACE DESIGN IS IMPORTANT FOR 
CHILDREN AND SHOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM DESIGN FOR 
ADULTS 
When we own a new electronic device such as PC, iPad 
or smartphone, the way we interact with an unknown system 
is through activating the icons or other visual indicators on 
the graphic user interface (GUI). The term icon originates 
from a Greek word eikon, which refers to likeness, image or 
portrait. In the field of computer science, an icon is a small 
picture of symbol that represents a program, command, file, 
directory or device [9]. Usually, users can activate an icon on 
the graphic user interface (GUI) through a mouse, pointer, 
finger or voice commands. Icon interface has been 
extensively used on various smart devices because it has 
compact 
universal 
pictographic 
representations 
of 
functionality [11] and confronts fewer language obstacles 
[12]. Many studies have pointed out that children and young 
adults tend to rely on visual indication or visual cues rather 
than textual information [3][13][14][15]. Some researchers 
from Taiwan measured 104 children’s information search 
efficiency of finding icons (databases) in the virtual 
environment. The final statistical analyses demonstrated that 
children’s searching efficiency improves through using the 
graphical interface, compared to using text-focused interface 
[3]. Children at 4-6 year old still have poor reading ability, 
so appropriate icon and interface design are important for

them to easily retrieval information from digital products 
such as website, game, and application [16]. 
When kids open a website or an application, they think in 
the different ways as adults [3][17][18]. Adults use websites 
and applications to find information, do shopping, and 
communicate with friends, etc. Meanwhile, most of the kids 
consider digital media as a way to entertain themselves [19]. 
Jakob Nielsen found that lots of usability aspects apply for 
both kids and adults. Meanwhile, he also discovered that 
there are some different aspects. Table I [20] in his study 
summarizes the main similarities and differences in user 
behavior between children and adults when they use 
websites. It illustrates how children and adults think and 
behave differently as they use digital products. For instance, 
look at the seventh column in the first row, when users 
confront multiple or redundant navigations on user interface, 
children feel more confused. Then in the row that says Back 
button in the first column, it shows young kids barely use 
that icon, yet older kids and adults are relying on it. Those 
comparisons just indicate that younger children have a 
different interpretation to the same design than older children 
and adults. In addition to that, designers should also consider 
children’s immature cognitive development, and void 
experience of association to produce high recognizable and 
age-appropriate icon design for them. 
A. Immature Executive Function 
Neuroscience scholars discovered that the executive 
functions controlled by the frontal lobes allow adults to 
concentrate on relevant information on user interface and 
filter irrelevant information [21]. Children aged from 3 to 8 
have relatively immature executive functions and short-term 
memory [22], which hinder their ability to have a good 
command of interpreting the icon and visual cues on graphic 
interface as adults do. Hence, children may not be able to 
recognize some icons that we adults take for granted. 
B. Void Experience of Associating Icon Metaphor 
A study from National Taichung University of Education 
found that the users’ prior experiences could contribute to 
storing images and build up conceptual neural networks in 
our brain [22]. When an icon delivers a message, adult users 
can retrieve their previous long-term memory to interpret it. 
However, due to the void experience, children user would 
have difficulty associating the icon metaphors with the real 
objects. For example, we adults are quite familiar with the 
save icon (Figure 1), which we still frequently used in the 
Microsoft Word software (Figure 2).  Most of adults can 
recognize this icon because it is widely used on websites and 
applications. However, the image of this save icon is a 3.5-
inch floppy disk (Figure 3), the primary means of backing up 
files or transferring them between computers in the 1990s. 
We are no longer using this storage device. Apparently, 
children today cannot recognize this icon without training 
because floppy disk does not exist in their world. Therefore, 
it is important for adults and designers to avoid assuming 
that children’s world experiences and adult experiences are 
comparable, with regard to icon metaphor association. 
Children will feel quite confused if this assumption is

applied in the design for them. The icon metaphors used in 
interface should be familiar to children and connect to the 
physical world [20][23].  
III. 
WHY ICON AND INTERFACE DESIGN FOR CHILDREN 
SHOULD CONSIDER DIFFERENT AGE RANGES 
Children undergo dramatic physiological and cognitive 
changes as they grow up [3][24]. Children at different age 
segments have different user characteristics. Adult’s mental 
and physical situation usually remain pretty stable in the long 
term. Shneiderman argued that any design should be built 
upon an understanding of its target users. He also stated that 
age group and gender should be considered as important user 
characteristics alongside education, ethic, personality, 
training and so forth [3][25]. In addition, Sultan Idris 
Education University did a study on children’s ability to 
design icons based on the given tasks, the finding shows 
younger and older children have a different understanding of 
the same icon representation and their meaning. Children 
under 8 year old have difficulty in recognizing even some 
simple icons like undo icon and move-to-first-page icon [26].  
Figure 4 in this study report shows children interpret a given 
word differently according to their age [26]. It reveals that 
age plays an important role in icon recognition and visual 
information perception ability. 
According to Piaget’s theory [27][28][29], children have 
four stages of cognitive development: the sensorimotor stage 
(0-2 years), preoperational stage (2-7 years), concrete 
operational stage (7-11 years), and formal operational stage 
(adolescence through adulthood). Most children under 2 and 
half years old have few experiences with standard input 
devices like mouse trackball and keyboard to interact with 
technology. And children older than 14 years old have 
entered into puberty and are likely to behave as adults [30]. 
However, children aged 4-6 year old are in the development 
process of the preoperational stage, and they begin to 
develop various cognitive skills, such as language, memory, 
imagination and so forth. But they are unable to understand 
concrete logic yet, so they tend to know this world only 
through making connections between events and phenomena. 
Their ability to process information mentally is still very 
limited [8]. Statement from Piaget and Inhelder and Piaget 
[28][31] also identified that the children aged 2 to 4 like to 
engage in symbolic play, such as pretend play. It means they 
start to use symbolic representations. Later, children at 
preoperational stage achieve an important cognitive 
milestone when they behave better at language expression, 
draw and play [8]. Making use of symbol such as icons on 
user interface for children at this age group will help them 
get the hang of smart devices and understand things faster 
and efficient. 
IV. 
HOW TO DESIGN ICON FOR 4 TO 6 YEAR OLD 
Though there exist many studies and guidelines of user 
interface design, most of them still focus on adult users, only 
a small amount of them have taken children youthfulness as 
user characteristic [3][32]. This situation is typical in touch-
screen interface designed for children. A study from 
Romania noticed that only a few works had addressed 
children’s interaction behavior with touch-screen devices. 
Most existing touch interactions are designed for a generic 
user population. Those designers just assumed that all users 
could be able to target small graphical items precisely, and 
drag and drop them smoothly and effortlessly on the screen 
interface [8]. Nevertheless, as the study pointed out, 
children’s touch interaction patterns are different from 
adults. Children have smaller finger size, and their motor and 
cognitive ability are limited in accordance with their age and 
developmental stage [8][32][33][34]. In fact, small children 
are more complicated than they appear initially [24]. 
Designers should avoid dumbing down their young users by 
simply enlarging the icon size and brightening the color in 
UI design. Therefore, specific interface design guidelines are 
required for small-age children, rather than just relying on 
general design guidelines [3]. If needed, designers can also 
actively include the young user themselves in the design 
process. 
Icon and interface design for children can incorporate the 
concept of “User-centered design”. Most designers are 
familiar with the term “User-centered design”(UCD). Donald 
Norman’s research laboratory at the University of California, 
San Diego, originated the term ‘user-centered design’ (UCD) 
in the 1980s. The role of the designer in the user-centered 
design is to facilitate task for users, to make sure that users 
can use the product as intended, and with a minimum effort 
to learn how to use it [35]. Table II lists the four phases of 
the UCD process. A rule for user-centered design practices is 
that no design suits all users. Designers should design based

on the knowledge of the target users [4]. However, as 
Shneiderman argued [10], it is less common to find in 
practice that small-age users are being considered in the 
interface design guidelines. Sabina Idler, who is the founder 
of UXkids, mentioned the notion of child-centered design 
(CCD). She recommends designers to take what we have 
learned from UCD and to apply it to design for kids [36]. 
Based on the concept of UCD, and Sabina’s explanation of 
CCD, Figure 5 demonstrates the five phases of icon design 
for children. The first step is to have an idea; then designers 
should conduct some field research to understand their 
children user characteristics. Next, it is time for designers to 
produce design solution for a particular product. After that, 
usability testing is required to make the design evaluation 
and designers can modify their design based on the feedback 
from children users. 
A. Field and User Research 
Having a good understanding of target user’s needs is an 
evitable part of the design process. If users are preschoolers 
who have limited language expression and cognitive ability, 
designers should do more research on characteristics of 
children users. In this case, understanding the cognitive 
psychology at various age stages could help designers put 
themselves into children’s shoes. 
1) Children from Age 4 to 6 are in the Preoperational 
Stage: 
According 
to 
Piaget’s 
theory 
of 
cognitive 
development, children aged 4 to 6 are in the preoperational 
stage (2-6 years).  Piaget developed term “Preoperational” 
for children who don’t understand concrete logic yet and 
can only see objects and people from their perspective [24]. 
They are starting to have the ability to communicate via 
simple language and use symbols such as words, numbers, 
and images to represent real objects [6]. But kids at this 
stage are in the process of learning how to think abstractly, 
so they still are having trouble articulating thoughts and 
behaviors clearly. Hence, even if some icons and symbols 
are universally understood for adults, they make no sense in 
children’s minds. So, designers ought to think twice before 
using any icons and symbols that adults take for granted. 
2) Children Privacy and Parental Consent: Before 
conducting the on-site research or test for children, one 
thing should be kept in mind is that many countries have 
strict regulations about collecting personal data from kids 
younger than 13. Designers and researchers are required to 
obtain parental or guardian consent before conducting any 
testing. In the United States, detailed explanations of the 
rules could be found in the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy 
Protection Act (COPPA) laws [24]. Apart from getting 
permission, it is highly recommended to let the parents 
understand your research objectives [37].  
B. Produce Design Solution 
When designing icon graphics for 4 to 6 year old, the 
following aspects should be taken into account. The design 
concept can be applied to the user interface on different 
platforms.

Evaluate Design 
Conduct usability testing with actual users 
1) 
Icon Graphics Should Match User’s Mental 
Models: Icon metaphor should depend on user familiar 
mental models, for the purpose of reducing cognitive effort 
[3]. In other words, icon design should remind the user of 
real objects that they are already known [12] [38]. Many 
studies [39][40][41][42] shows that concrete icon sets tend 
to be more visually complex than abstract icons since the 
detailed interpretation of real world objects would allow 
users to access their existing knowledge and life experience 
related to these items to infer meaning. However, icon 
design should avoid being too complex, as it will increase 
the extra processing time for user to recognize [43]. Jeeves 
[3] example found that metaphors are related to age and 
culture. Chinese Academy of Science did a research about 
how the development of visual attention aged from children 
to adult affects interface design [44], the finding use series 
of data to point out that children participants need 
significant longer reaction time on user interface than 
adolescence and adult participants.  
In addition, for children who usually don’t have much 
life experience and haven’t received icon recognition 
training, learning a new set of visualized symbols is much 
difficult than recognizing images they observe in daily life. 
According to the study from Nation Taipei University of 
Technology [45], a design guideline is using icons based 
upon simplified images that relevant to children’s real life 
experience, as they can easily perceive the actual meaning 
on the user interface database. Figure 6, the screen shot of 
TV icons from website Sprout and CBeebies for 
preschoolers, is an example in practice. The biggest 
difference in these two icon graphics is that the right one has

two television antennas. Those antennas are not matched 
with nowadays children’s mental model because the truth is 
we no longer use TV with antennas and have not for quite a 
long time. Most of the kids nowadays are watching the TV 
in Figure 8 at home or school rather than the counterpart 
with antennas. Though the antenna makes the TV icon 
“childish” and more kid-friendly, it is at odds with children 
user’s sense of rightness, and result in a low recognizability. 
2) 
Semantic Distance: Semantic distance in interface 
design means the closeness between the icon and the 
function it represents [39]. When designing interface for 
children, icon graphic should match its function to avoid 
misunderstanding. Some researchers agreed that semantic 
distance 
plays 
an 
important 
role 
in 
determining 
interpretability 
[38][39][46]. 
Townsend 
[2] 
also 
recommended in his research that icon designed for children 
user should “clearly depict, indicate and distinguish a 
program's commands and operations” and "should suggest 
and indicate a command intention rather than just duplicate 
or represent a particular pictorial form.” Currently, some 
icons designed for children users tend to be looking good but 
not accurately matching the meaning of function [3]. For 
instance, the two icons represent the game section in Figure 
8, the graphic in the right one is a wheel with an arrow on it, 
and the left one is a game console. Apparently, most kids 
today know what a game console looks like, this graphic let 
them easily remind of video gameplay experience in real life. 
However, the wheel graphic does not accurately match the 
video game concept. Children may play wheel spin game in 
real life, but this cannot represent various kinds of video 
games in their mind. As a result, icon graphics need to be 
carefully selected, accurately matched with the label text to 
avoid any misinterpretations [3] for children users. 
3) 
Maintain Visual Hierarchy on User Interface: 
Color combination and color contrast on user interface 
would significantly influence the visual search performance 
of user [43]. Studies [47][48][49] show that proper use of 
color could enhance the graphical display effectiveness, 
which can lead to fewer search times for user. Children at the 
preoperational stage prefer bold and primary colors and high 
contrast in graphic layouts [50], because bright colors 
immediately catch their attention [3] and trigger their interest 
to explore. But some studies also stated that incorporate too 
much color into a user interface could be counterproductive, 
as it may generate a “fruit salad” look [49] feeling to the user. 
At the same time, it could also slow down children user’s 
visual search time on the interface. In the example shown in 
Figure 9, Webkinz Jr. is a website design for kids aged 3 to 
6, to play learning games online. You can tell from the 
picture that designers intend to use lots of bright colors to 
attract children’s attention of exploring. Also, the four icons 
at the bottom are quite colorful. However, the visual 
hierarchy on the interface is not evident, which makes 
children under 6 years old have trouble navigating it. 
Screenshot in Figure 10 is a good iconic interface design.  It 
is an early math application for preschoolers, named Eggy 
Substract to 20. The color on the interface is bright enough, 
and the graphic design is kid-friendly. The icons on Eggy 
Substract to 20 maintain have high color contrast with the 
background. For children user, it is easier for them to 
complete visual search and further navigate to the contents 
they want. Hence, user interface design for children should 
incorporate an appropriate amount of color and high contrast 
to increase visual search efficiency [43].  
4) Indication of Icon Clickability: Children love 
feedback, such as animation and sound when they interact 
with the game or application. A study result from University 
of Calgary [2] argued that animated icons are easier to 
decipher the meaning than static images for children. 
Children show an obvious preference for the moving icons. 
So incorporating animated icons in a user interface for 
children could have a merit. The click animation in Figure 11 
is a good illustration of this point. When the mouse cursor 
moves to the icon, the animation appears to give children 
users feedback and attract their attention. It uses a children-
friendly way to indicate that icon is clickable. 
C. Design Evaluation-Usability Testing with Children

For designers, it is highly recommended to get feedback 
from children about your design and make some proper 
modifications. In Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field, 
we usually use usability testing to do evaluation. This notion 
initially focused on adults [51][52], later children’s different 
requirement became noticeable, and it leads to more 
children-centered methods in usability testing. In a study 
from Malaysia [51], some researchers attempted to find out 
issues that have been overlooked in performing testing with 
children. They point out that some testers, especially younger 
ones, seemed to have trouble communicating with children. 
As we know, usually children are taught to not to trust 
strangers easily. When you first meet a kid, it is suggested to 
establish relationships by engaging him or her into some 
small talk to find out more about each other. Topics like 
birthday, favorite computer games, or favorite subjects at 
school [30] could trigger children’s interest. Other than that, 
some children are quite introversive, and not willing to talk 
too much. In this case, a good way is to use “friendship 
pairs” [37] during the communication with children. 
Friendship pairs in conducting research refers to obtaining 
information from participants, by speaking to their outgoing 
peers who know about their experience of using any websites 
or apps.  However, even the children users are willing to talk 
to the tester; another challenge is that they can be very 
unpredictable regarding actions and behaviors [51]. And 
most of the children aged from 4 to 6 year old are still not 
ready to sit at task and follow directions from an adult. 
Besides, children at this age stage usually have difficulty 
expressing their likes and dislikes in words [30]. Under this 
circumstance, we could apply observation in the evaluation 
process. When children users are sighing, smiling or sliding 
under the table, it can indicate they like or dislike your 
design to a certain degree. 
As for some other aspects, such as preparation, lab 
environment and so on need to be taken care during the 
usability testing with children, we can use Figure 12 and 
Figure 13 from previous studies [46][51] about usability 
testing with children to summarize the specific guidelines for 
testers. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper attempts to investigate some guidelines for 
icon and interface design for 4 to 6 year olds by analyzing 
children 
user 
characteristics, 
incorporating 
Piaget’s 
development stages theory and user-centered design concept. 
The design procedures could be summarized as having an 
idea, conducting field research, producing design solution, 
doing design evaluation by usability testing, and making 
some modifications. In general, based on findings from 
different studies, design icon on interface for children should 
strike a balance between a plain, unimaginative but 
functional design and a colorful and animated design.
