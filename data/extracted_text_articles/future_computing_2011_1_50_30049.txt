Abstract—Wind 
speed 
forecasting
is 
an 
essential 
prerequisite for the planning, operation, and maintenance 
works associated with wind energy engineering. This paper 
attempts to forecast fluctuations based only on observed wind
data using the data-driven artificial neural network approach. 
Wind fluctuations with varying lead times ranging from a half
year to a full year are predicted at Al-Hijana, Syria with the 
pre-preparation for the available data. Two layers of feed-
forward back-propagation networks were used along with the 
conjugate gradient algorithm and other
tested
training 
functions.  The results show that artificial neural network
models perform extremely well as low values of errors 
resulting between the measured and predicted data are 
obtained. The present work contributes to previous work in the 
field of wind energy independent power producer market and may 
be of significant value to Syria, considering that the country is 
currently in the process of transitioning into a free energy market. 
It is likely that this modeling approach will become a useful tool to 
enable power producer companies to better forecast or supplement 
wind speed data.

I. INTRODUCTION
The wind-energy spread usage in recent years is an 
attempt to address the environmental problems that result
from the consumption of energy and especially from nuclear 
power plant disasters like the one that recently occurred in 
Fukushima, Japan. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change) indicated that [1] human activities are 
directly related to increased
atmospheric levels of 
greenhouse 
gasses, 
i.e., 
carbon 
dioxide, 
methane, 
chlorofluocarbons, and carbon monoxide. Additionally, a 
correlation also exists between global warming involving
greenhouse gas and environmental problems. It is generally 
agreed that of those harmful greenhouse gasses, carbon 
dioxide contributes the most to global warming. The main 
artificial source of carbon dioxide discharge is derived from
fossil fuels (conventional power plants). Therefore, much 
recent research has focused on reducing the consumption of 
fossil 
fuels 
and 
replacing 
those 
with 
renewable,
environment-friendly energy sources. Currently, wind 
energy is considered as one of the most promising energy 
sources. However, since wind is difficult to manage, 
generating wind energy is still a challenge. Due to a variety 
of factors, the wind speed characteristic curve can change 
with time. Wind blows as a result of an imbalance in the 
quantity of heat on the earth by the energy from the sun.  
Experimentally, it is known that wind speed is intermittent, 
irregular, and frequently fluctuates in the short term. Since 
wind energy is directly related to the cubic value of the wind 
speed, any changes in the wind speed will greatly impact the 
amount of the energy.  In order to better support the
transition to a free energy market, a more accurate means of 
estimating the energy generated from the wind farm and 
pumped in the grid is needed. 
This paper thus introduces an ANN (Artificial Neural 
Networks) for wind speed predictions to estimate the wind 
speed in a suggested location in Syria that involves two 
main approaches.
1-
A one year prediction tool.
2-
A half year prediction tool.
Also, the different possible ways that can be used in order to 
improve the prediction output (e.g., choosing different 
training functions). This paper also introduces a model for 
energy estimation using the output of the wind speed 
prediction tool as an input for the energy model. Using the 
Matlab computing program for building the suggested ANN 
is one of the future computing methods for wind prediction.

WIND SPEED PREDICTION TECHNIQUES 
A. Introduction
The wind speed characteristic can be considered a non-
linear fluctuation. Therefore, the forecasting of this function 
using traditional methods can be very difficult and time 
consuming. In this case,
the intelligent engineering 
represented by a neural network, a chaos fractal, and a 
genetic algorithm, etc.
can be applied. While these 
techniques are already adopted in numerical predictions, the 
usage of the ANN gives a better performance in terms of 
pattern recognition and finding location peculiarities, 
especially when information on the used wind turbine and 
power curve is given [2].
There are two different types of wind speed predictions
[3]:
The vertical wind speed prediction or the prediction of the 
expected wind speed curve in one point on the geographical 
map with different height. This can be seen, for example,

when the wind measurement device is at a height of 40 m
and the wind turbine is installed in the same location yet in a 
different hub height like 105 m.
The horizontal wind speed prediction or the prediction 
of the expected wind speed curve in one point on the 
geographical map that has a horizontal difference from the 
point of measured data. This is witnessed when the wind 
measurement device is in one location and the wind turbine 
is installed in another location (top of a mountain where the 
measurement is very difficult to be obtained) [4].  
Fig. 1 Wind speed prediction and energy module connections
                
The historical wind data shown in Fig. 1 indicates that
the atmospheric parameter measurements such as the 
pressure and temperature that were available for the location 
in our case. The energy historical data indicates a previous 
energy output for a previous wind turbine installed in the 
location of interest which was not available in our case (as 
this was the first wind farm to be installed in this location).  
  
B. Feed Forward Neural Network with Backpropogation
A neural network is a computational structure that 
resembles a biological neuron. It can be defined as a 
“massively parallel distributed processor made up of 
storing processing units, which has a natural propensity for 
storing experimental knowledge and making it available for 
use”[5].
A feed-forward neural network consists of layers.  Every 
layer will be connected to the previous once with more than 
one connection that has a weight to determine the 
importance of this connection. Every network has at least 
three layers.  These include the input layer, output layer, and 
the hidden layer(s). The strength of a set of inputs can be 
determined by the activation function after adding the whole 
input signals as shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2  Basic structure of a neuron [5]
The raw data was provided in a form of Excel file. Patterns 
were generated and a statistical analysis performed to get a
good correlation among the input values. Some data was fed 
as an input in the prediction network for training purposes 
while other data was specifically employed for network 
testing purposes.
The following steps were taken to get the wind speed 
prediction:
1-
Data Acquisition & Pre-processing.
2-
Data conversion & Normalization.
3-
Statistical Analysis. 
4-
Design of the Neural Network &Training.
5-
Testing.
C. Data Acquisition, Pre-processing, and Data 
Conversion
The weather parameter values were collected at a weather 
station at the location of interest [6]. Time series was 
provided for every ten minutes with the help of the Syrian 
National Energy Center for Research and Development.  
The values of three different parameters were utilized to 
include the pressure, temperature and wind direction as 
shown in table I.

D. Statistical Analysis
Since the amount of available data is massive and the 
characteristic curve of the wind speed continually changes
with time, a statistical analysis is needed in order to measure 
the extent of
the
relationship between each of the 
meteorological values and to get rid of the redundant values 
that might be present in the data set. Therefore, a 
“Spearman rank correlation” was applied. The amount of 
correlation in a sample (of data) is measured by the sample 
coefficient of correlation, generally denoted by ‘r’ or by ‘ ’
E. Spearman’s Correlation
Spearman’s correlation allows testing the direction and 
strength of a relationship [9]. For example the relationship 
between the pressure and the wind speed will be shown (one 
of the inputs of the prediction tool and the output) to help 
determine the importance of this parameter on the output of 
the prediction.  This in turn can give a good vision of the 
expected output of the suggested ANN tool. This approach 
can also be applied to problems in which data cannot be 
measured quantitatively but
in which a
qualitative 
assessment is possible. In this case, the best individual is 
given rank number 1, the next rank 2, etc.  
The correlation coefficient takes values between [1,-1]. 
A value of /1/ indicates that the relationship between the 
two different parameters is very strong and has a positive 
effect (when “X” increases, the “Y” value will also
increase). The value/-1/ has the same strength meaning of 
/1/ yet the relation is inverse. A value of /0/ means that no 
relationship
exists
between the two different studied 
parameters. 
Steps for achieving a Spearman’s ranking:
A- Rank both sets of data from highest to lowest value
(make sure to check for tied ranks /readings of the 
same value and to obtain the same sequence of 
readings).
B-
Subtract the two sets of ranking data to get the 
difference /d/.
C-
Square the values of /d/.
D- Add up the squared values of the differences.
E-
Calculate the values using Spearman’s Ranking 
Formula [9]:
           
                      (1)
Table II shows the results obtained from this analysis for   
one year data (2008). It can be seen that the pressure has an 
inverse influence on the wind speed and that the temperature 
has an indirect effect on the wind speed through an inverse 
relationship with the pressure [12].

Fig. 3 gives a statistical analysis for 6 years of available 
data.  The figure can be used to clarify the results obtained 
from the prediction tool as it shows that the atmospheric 
parameters and the character curve of the wind speed 
changes on a yearly basis. The information obtained from 
Spearmen’s ranking can help determine which data should 
be selected as training data in order to contain the best 
possible situation and get better prediction results for this 
specific location.

F. Design of the Neural Network & Training
Designing the neural network means sizing the network 
in order to fit our need. Unfortunately, there is currently no 
mathematical equation for sizing the network or determining
which training functions to use [10]. Thus, engineers often 
rely on trial and error and personal experience to solve these 
issues. In our case, the sizing of the number of hidden 
layers, training functions, activation functions, number of 
neurons in the hidden layers, and determining the best 
training input pattern was accomplished through trial and 
error and, as shown in Fig. 4, a comparison of the results. 
Finally, 2 hidden layers with feed forward activity were 
chosen.  Using the back propagation algorithm in each 
training set, the weights were modified in order to reduce 
the root mean squared error (deviation) (RMSE/D/) between 
the predicted values and the actual readings as target values. 
Thus, the modification takes place in the reverse direction 
from the output layer until the terminating condition is 
reached. The steps are:
 Initialize the weights.
 Propagate the inputs forward.
 Back propagate the error.

G. Testing
Testing is the final stage needed to finalize the proposed 
wind speed prediction tool. While different methods can be 
used to evaluate the results obtained from the prediction 
tool, in this case the Mean Square Error method was used
[11].

RMSD
The previous tables give the results of the differing
sizing possibilities that can be used for the prediction tool.  
It can be seen that the usage of the pressure, temperature
and wind direction as inputs for the prediction tool is more 
effective than using each parameter alone.  Also, the 2007-
2008 input data gives better results than the 2006-2007 data 
because the MSE is better in the first case.
The most important conclusion that can be derived from 
the data in the previous tables is that if the error is reduced a 
new approach is needed in order to overcome the errors 
generated from the unaccounted character changes of the 
wind speed. In this new approach is to take only half a year 
into account. Also this half year was divided among 
collecting testing (or validation) data and training data.  The 
half year period was divided into days, with one day 
allocated for training and the next one for testing and so on 
as shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5  The new wind prediction tool (Tr= training, Ts= testing).
Fig. 6 compares the results of the old approach with the 
results of the new one.  The first two columns shows the 
results of the old approach along with the best results from 
the different input data and training data respectively, and 
the second two columns show the same results but for the 
new approach.  An error of /RMSD=0.0449/ was obtained.
Fig. 6  The error reduction due to the usage of the new approach.
Although the results shown in Fig. 6 only describe one 
year (2008), if applied to more than one year as shown in 
Fig. 7 it can be seen that the RMSD for the old approach is 
better than the new approach. However, since the purpose of 
this research is for energy calculations and the energy
market (in other words, for engineering not meteorological
applications) the approach needs to have a very small error.
For this reason, the new approach can be considered more 
effective in this situation as shown in Fig. 6 or Fig. 8, which
show the deviation between the measured and predicted 
wind speed.

H. Energy Module
After getting acceptable results as an output from the 
previously built prediction tool, those results are used as an 
input for the energy module. Fig. 9 shows the suggested 
energy model which has the following components:
1.
A signal Builder: contains the predicted wind 
speed data. 
2.
Lookup Table: contains the power curve data of 
the used power turbine [12].
3.
Integrator: is used to get the output energy from 
the wind turbine [13].
4.
Scope: is used to show the results in Fig. 11.
5.
Display: is used to show the accumulated value 
of the energy.
Fig. 9  Block diagram of the energy module.
Putting the previous component together give us the energy 
that can be produced by the used turbine.
Vestas Wind System /V90/ was selected as the working 
wind turbine with a 90 m rotor diameter, 105 m height, and 
2 MW power [8]. Fig. 10 shows the power curve of this 
wind turbine.
Fig. 10  Power curve of V90 wind turbine.
Using all of above information, the energy can be obtained 
as shown in Fig. 11 where the error is tripled due to the 
relation between the energy and the cubic wind speed.  For 
this reason, the error of the predicted wind speed should be 
at its minimum with no time deviation errors [14][15].

and measured wind speed

III. CONCLUSION:
As a conclusion of this work it is observed that the 
prediction errors can be reduced by the usage of same 
characteristic properties of the predicted wind speed and 
that in its turns will lead to less errors in the Energy module 
(the error of the energy is cubical to the wind speed errors 
due to the cubic relationship between the Energy and the 
wind speed). More understanding of the data lead to better 
results in the prediction tool that is why spearman’s analysis 
is an important method of determining the strength of 
connection between the different data used as input to get 
the output of the prediction tool. Finally, the short term 
prediction helps of reducing the errors in the prediction tool 
and also the work load on the computing device.
