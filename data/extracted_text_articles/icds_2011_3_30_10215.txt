Abstract—with the increasing number of mobile terminals, it is 
a  challenge  how  to  reduce  the  cost  and  provide  fast  and 
efficient call delivery to the mobile terminals. In the existing 
mobile networks, the call connection between the two terminals 
is based on the registration of their identity in the databases 
known as home location register and visitor location register. 
Conventional registration strategies will incur a high volume of 
signaling traffic. These strategies can work well up to a certain 
level of call to mobility ratio. In this paper, we propose a 
storage-based location tracking scheme based on the storage of 
the location of a mobile terminal at the repository database, 
which efficiently reduces the location updates and searching 
cost in the mobile networks.

I.      INTRODUCTION
Mobile communication is one of the emerging fields in the 
area of communication. In the mobile networks, the location 
of a mobile terminal changes frequently so it is difficult to 
trace a mobile terminal’s location. There are three main 
strategies proposed for location tracking in the hprevious 
work; these are local anchoring strategy (LAS) [1] [5] [12], 
IS-41[5],  and  group  registration  (GR)  [1]  technique  for 
location tracking in mobile networks.
In the previous studies, several strategies such as local 
anchoring strategy (LAS), forwarding strategy (FS) [7] [11]
[12][16] and replication strategy (RS) [17] were proposed to 
reduce the burden on the HLR. Since, a user may change his 
mobility patterns  frequently,  any single strategy  can  not 
cope with such time-varying mobility patterns efficiently. In 
this  paper,  an  efficient  strategy  based  on  storage  of 
information about the location of mobile terminal known as 
storage-based (SB) location tracking strategy is proposed 
which works well with a good level of call to mobility ratio 
(CMR). To reduce cost, we applied a repository database 
which will result in low cost and also have low complexity 
of database handling.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In 
Section 2, we explain the SB strategy.  This section also 
includes the details of location registration and updating 
procedure in SB strategy.  In  Section 3, we describe the 
analytical  model.  In  Section  4,  numerical  results  are 
described. Finally, conclusion is given in Section 5.
II.    PROPOSED STRATEGY
A.     Basic approach for SB location tracking
The proposed SB location tracking approach is based on 
the Group Registration Technique [1], which is modified to 
reduce the cost of mobile communication. In this strategy it 
is proposed to attach a database for storage which has a 
good capacity and the information from it can be easily 
accessed and provided for further processing. Each location 
area (LA) maintains a registration waiting list (RWL) to 
keep  the  newly  arrived  MTs  identities  (IDs).  However, 
before the location of the newly moved in MTs is updated at 
the  HLR,  a  mechanism  should  be  placed  so  that  any 
incoming call for these MTs can be successfully delivered 
to their current LA. For this purpose, either forwarding or 
local anchoring can be used to set up a forwarding pointer 
from a MT’s old LA or local anchor to its new LA as the 
MT changes its LA. The main factor which reduces the cost 
of mobile tracking is the repository database which stores 
the information about the mobile terminal and updates this 
information  in  the  neighboring  visitor  location  register 
(VLR).Two  methods  were  introduced  [1]  to  report  the 
location change to the HLR: 1) Static local anchoring (SL): 
an MT’s local anchor is changed to its new VLR upon the 
arrival of its next incoming call. 2) Dynamic local anchoring 
(DL): in addition to method 1, the MT’s new VLR becomes 
its local anchor if such a change results in a lower cost.
B.     Location Update Procedure in SB Strategy
When a MT changes its LA, the following procedure is 
performed (Figure 1) [1]
Figure 1. Location Update Procedure in SB Strategy old VLR is the Local 
Anchor
1. The new MSC detects that the MT enters an LA in its 
area and sends a message to inform to repository (central 
database) that MT has entered in it.
2. The repository updates the location of MT in its memory 
from old MSC to new MSC.
3. Repository sends a message to the old mobile terminal 
about the current location so that it can find it easily.
4. Repository sends an acknowledgement to the new MT 
that it has updated the location of MT in the database. The 
Old MSC checks if it’s associated VLR is the local anchor 
of the MT. If yes (Figure 1), the local anchor is updated to 
point to the MT’s current VLR, and the location update 
procedure is complete, otherwise (Figure 2) [1], go to the 
next step.
5. The old VLR removes the MT’s ID from its old LA’s 
RWL. A location update message is sent to the MT’s local 
anchor, which then updates itself to point to the MT’s new 
VLR.
6. The local anchor sends back an acknowledgment message 
to the MT’s old MSC. The location update procedure is 
complete.

Local Anchor
C.          Call Delivery Procedure
Local anchor changes occur only during the call delivery 
procedure.  The  call  delivery  procedure  proceeds  as 
follows: 
1. When a call for an MT is originated (the caller can be a 
wire line or mobile phone), a location request message is 
sent to the MT’s HLR. 
2. The HLR  obtains the ID  of the called  MT’s local 
anchor and sends a route request message to the local 
anchor. 
3. If  the local  anchor  is  the current  VLR  of the MT 
(Figure.3), go to the next step; otherwise (Figure. 4), the 
route  request  message  is  forwarded  to  the  current 
VLR/MSC. 
4. The called MSC searches for the called MT. If the MT 
is found, a temporary local directory number (TLDN) is 
allocated to the MT. 
5. If the RWL of the called MT’s current LA is not empty, 
all MT IDs in the RWL are sent to the HLR in the route 
response message along with the TLDN. 
6. The  current  VLR  registers  the  mobile  terminal’s 
location information to the repository which stores it in 
the database. 
7. Meanwhile, except for the called MT, for each other 
MT in the RWL, the current VLR sends a deregistration 
message to its local anchor, which removes the MT’s 
forwarding pointer entry. The RWL is then emptied. The 
current VLR becomes the local anchor of all MTs in the 
RWL. 
8. After receiving the route response message from the 
VLR, the HLR forwards the TLDN to the calling MSC. If 
the route response message contains any to be- updated 
MT’s ID, the HLR changes these MTs’ local anchors to 
the current VLR. 
9. After receiving the TLDN, the calling MSC can set up 
a connection to the called MSC 
III.  ANALYTICAL MODEL
A Location Update Cost of the Proposed Strategy 
Assume that the MTs arrive at an LA according to a 
Poisson process; the incoming calls to an MT follow a 
Poisson Process, and an MT’s residence time in an LA 
follows an exponential distribution [1].To evaluate the 
cost of proposed strategy following cost notation is used 
Figure 3Call Delivery Procedure Current VLR is the Local Anchor [1]
Figure 4 Call Delivery Procedure Current VLR is not the
Local Anchor [1]
Cv Cost for a query or an update of the VLR. 
Ch Cost for a query or an update of the HLR.
Cvv Cost for transmitting a signaling message between 
two VLRs.
Chv Cost for transmitting a signaling message between a 
VLR and the HLR.
As seen from call update procedure, in the proposed 
strategy, as an MT changes its LA, a location update is 
performed. However, the location update procedure may 
be different [1].
There  exist  two  cases  that  incur different  location 
update costs:
Case 1. The old VLR of the moved-out MT is its local 
anchor (Figure. 1).
Case 2. The old VLR of the moved-out MT is not its local 
anchor (Figure. 2).
Location  updates  cost  in  Case 1.  During  the time 
period that a MT stays in an LA, if there is at least one 
incoming call arriving for any MT in the LA, then the 
MT’s  current  VLR  becomes  its  local  anchor  and  its 
location is updated at the HLR during the call delivery 
procedure for the first incoming call to this LA. In this 
case,  when  the  MT  moves  to  another  LA,  the  cost 
incurred by the LA change, U1 is (Figure. 1)

cost for the new VLR creating the user profile and adding 
the MT’s ID to the RWL is Cv. All the data are centrally 
updated in the database.
Location  updates  cost  in  Case  2.  If  there  is  no 
incoming  call  to  any  MT  in  an  LA  during  a  MT’s 
residence period  in the LA, steps 5 and 6 in the location 
update procedure needs  to be executed  when  the MT 
moves to another LA. In this case, the cost incurred by the 
LA boundary crossing, U2 is (Figure. 2)

B.     Call Delivery Cost of the Proposed Strategy
There are two types of calls for which the call delivery 
cost may be different:
The first incoming call to an MT after the MT moved 
into a LA.The rest of the incoming calls to the MT during 
the period that the MT stays in the LA.
 We will compare the proposed strategy to the IS-41, local 
anchoring strategy and Group Registration Strategy. Since 
the cost for message exchanges between the caller and the 
callee’s HLR is the same for these four strategies, this 
cost is not included in the cost estimation in this paper. 
Note that the call delivery cost can be calculated in the 
same way for both handoff calls and non handoff calls, 
while the cost triggered by the handoff process can be 
omitted, since this cost would be the same for all the four 
strategies when the same handoff mechanism is adopted. 
When the first incoming call at an LA is for another MT 
in the LA since MT m0moved into the LA, the HLR is 
pointing to the current VLR of m0an incoming call arrives 
for m0. In this case, the call delivery procedure shown in 
Figure.3  is  performed  to  deliver  an  incoming  call  to 
m0.The call delivery cost, V1, is 
                 V1=2Chv+Cv+θCh+RL*Cv                    (6)
where  the  cost  for  the  HLR  sending  the  location 
request message to the called MT’s current VLR is Chv, 
the cost for the current VLR retrieving the location of the 
MT’s current LA is Cv, the cost for the current VLR 
sending the TLDN and the MT IDs in the RWL, if any, to 
the HLR is Chv, and the cost for the HLR to update the 
MTs’ service profiles is Ch. The last term represents the 
cost of step 6 for local anchor deregistration  θ is the 
probability that there is at least one MT ID in the RWL 
and RL is the average number of MTs in the RWL [1].
When an MT receives the first incoming call to an LA 
after the MT moved into the LA, the MT’s HLR is still 
pointing to the MT’s local anchor, and the call delivery 
procedure  shown  in  Figure.  4  is  followed.  The  call 
delivery cost, V2 is
                    V2=2Chv+2Cv+Ch+ϒCv                     (7)
where  the  cost  for  the  HLR  sending  the  location 
request message to the called MT’s local anchor is Chv, 
the cost for the local anchor retrieving and removing the 
forwarding pointer is Cv, the cost for the current VLR 
retrieving the location of the MT’s current LA is Cv, the 
cost for the current VLR sending the TLDN and then to-
be-registered MTs’ IDs to the HLR is Chv, and the cost 
for the HLR to update the MTs’ service profiles is Ch. In 
addition, the cost incurred by step 6 of the call delivery 
procedure is Cv for each MT in the RWL (except for the 
called MT whose local anchor is deregistered in step 3 of 
the  call  delivery  procedure).  ϒ denotes  the  average 
number of MTs in the RWL (excluding the called MT)[1].
Let 
p2
be the probability that 
0
m  receives the first 
incoming call to
0
m ’s LA since  
0
m  moved into the 
LA. The average cost of the first incoming call since an 
MT moved into its current LA, V is

After the first incoming call, any subsequent incoming 
call to 
0
m while it remains in its current LA invokes cost 
V1. Thus, the expected cost per call arrival is [1]

Note that, only when ρ > 1, there are likely more than one 
incoming calls to the MT during its residence at an LA.
Therefore, the total cost per call arrival for the proposed 
strategy, denoted by CT,s is
                         C T, S = Cu, s + Cc, s                              (10)
C.    Tracking Cost of the IS-41 Strategy
The location update cost incurred by each LA change 
in the conventional IS-41 strategy is 4Chv + 2Cv +Ch. 
Thus, the expected location update cost per call arrival in 
the conventional strategy is

D.  Tracking Cost of the Local Anchoring Strategy
The local anchor of an MT in the LAS strategy could 
be the current VLR of the MT or a different VLR. In the 
former case, the location update cost per LA change is 
U1, while in the latter case the location update cost per 
LA change is U2-Cv.(No RWL operation is needed here.) 
The average location update cost incurred by each LA 
change in the LAS strategy is

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, performance comparison studied. First, 
several  critical  parameters  of  the  proposed  strategy, 
namely, p1, p2,θ, and β(k) are taken [1] and their impact 
on  the  proposed  strategy  is  discussed,  after  that  the 
proposed strategy is compared with the IS-41, LAS, GR 
strategies under different scenarios. The proposed strategy 
and the simulations in this section are applicable to any 
user movement patterns such as random walk, moving 
back and forth across adjacent LAs, etc. In Figures 5, 6, 7, 
8,  and  9,  it  is  assumed  that  λn,i (i=1,2,……..,8)  are 
uniformly distributed over (0.1,3) and the incoming call 
arrival rates φi  (i=1,2,3,…….,M)  at all MTs in the LA 
are uniformly distributed over (0.2, 3), which implies that 
the µni,i(i=1,2,3,……8) are also uniformly distributed over 
(0.2, 3)
A.
   Parameter Evaluations 
Figure. 5 shows the graph of probabilities p1 and p2 
versus  λ0  where  Ni  =20  (i=  1,  2  …  8) are  used  for 
demonstration purposes. From Figure. 5, we can see that 
p1 and p2 are very small. As Ni (i =1, 2……., 8) increases,
1
p and  
p2
 decrease  further  
1
p increases  as  
0
λ
increases. This is true since as the mean LA residence 
time, (
0
/
1 λ ), of MT decreases, the probability that there 
is no incoming call to an LA during the MT’s stay at the 
LA increases. It is also noted that the impact of µ0 on 
1
p  is negligible. On the other hand, 
1
p decreases as µ0 
decreases and the impact of   λ0  on  
p2
 is negligible. 
That is, as the mean of an MT’s intercall interval, 1/µ0 
increases the probability that the MT receives the first 
incoming call to its current LA decreases. In real mobile 
networks, Ni (i=1,2,…………. ,8) may be much larger 
than  20,therefore,  
1
p and  p2 would  become  much 
smaller.  Thus,  the  location  updates  process  shown  in 
Figure. 1 and the call delivery process shown in Figure. 3 
are invoked by the proposed strategy most of the time, 
resulting  in  less  cost  than  those  processes  shown  in 
Figure. 2 and Figure 4 Figure. 6 studies the impact of the 
MT arrival rate at a LA on the probability θ [1] that the 
RWL is not empty when an incoming call arrives to the 
LA, under different numbers M of MTs registered at an 
LA. From Figure 6, it can be seen that  θ decreases as η 
decreases or M increases. This is true because a smaller 
MT arrival rate to an LA increases the probability that the 
RWL is empty upon the arrival of a call. On the other 
hand, more MTs in an LA will make the LA receive calls 
more often and the RWL will be emptied more frequently, 
thus the probability that the RWL is not empty becomes 
smaller,  resulting  in  a  smaller  cost  for  the  proposed 
strategy. Figure.7 studies the probability  β(k) that there 
are k MTs in the RWL, which determines the cost of 
piggybacking  the  RWL  in  the  route  request 
acknowledgment  message  as  well  as  the  memory 
requirement for maintaining the RWL in the VLR. Three 
sets of (M,η) i.e., (200,100),(200, 50), and (400, 50), are 
considered. It is observed from Figure. 7 that the 
first set of (M,η) results in the greatest β(k) (k= 1, 2 …). 
As the MT arrival rate at the LA decreases or the number 
of  MTs  M  in  the  LA  increases,  β(k)  k=1,2,3……  ) 
decreases. It can be seen that β(k) approaches zero when 
k ≥ 4 for all given parameter sets.

The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is 
usually used to identify an MT in location management 
and its length is no more than 15 digits. If one digit is 1 
byte long, then N MT IDs in the RWL require a space of 
15 × N bytes. For N=4, the required space is 60 bytes. As 
indicated in Figure. 7, usually a much smaller space is 
needed for the RWL.

         Performance Comparisons
Figure. 8 compares the total cost per call arrival of the 
proposed strategy with those of the conventional IS-41 
strategy,  GR  strategy  and  the  LAS  strategy  under 
different  λ0 values, where (M,η) is set to (200,100).In 
Figures. 8 and 4.5, the following cost values are used: Cv 
=1, Ch = 1.5, Cvv =1, and Chv = 2. It is assumed that a 
query or an update at the HLR incurs a larger cost than 
that at the VLR, and the message exchanges between the 
HLR and a VLR incur a larger cost than those between 
two VLRs.

strategies with 
0
λ =0.5 per hour
Figure 8 (b) Total cost per call arrival versus CMR for different 
strategies with

λ = 5.0 per hour
This reflects the generic view that the resources at the 
HLR are usually more expensive to consume than those at 
the VLR and the distance between the HLR and VLR is 
larger than that between two VLRs. From Figure 9, it is 
observed that the proposed SB strategy incurs a smaller 
total cost per call arrival than three other conventional 
strategy and the LAS strategy when an MT’s CMR ρ < 
10,  while  for  ρ>  10,  the  proposed  strategy  incurs  a 
slightly Equivalent  cost to  the other three strategies. 
Moreover, the impact 
0
λ on the total cost per call arrival 
of the proposed strategy is negligible. 
The  preceding  observations  can  be  explained  as 
follows Compared to the IS-41 strategy, the SB strategy 
has a smaller location update cost by reporting its location 
changes  to  the  local  anchor.  Compared  to  the  LAS 
strategy,  the  SB  strategy  incurs  both  smaller  location 
update and call delivery costs. The SB strategy also has 
low cost than the GR strategy in both the cases.
 
Figure 9 (a) Total cost per call arrival versus CMR for different 
strategies with M=200 and η=50
In Figure. 9, we compare the proposed strategy to the 
IS-41 strategy, LAS strategy and the GR strategy under 
two different sets of (M,η): (200, 50) and (400, 50)We 
observe  that,  as  M  increases,  the  proposed  strategy 
outperforms the IS-41,GR and

strategies with M=400 and η=50
LAS strategies over a wider range of ρ. When comparing 
Figure. 8a to Figure. 9a, we observe that as η  decreases, 
the proposed strategy results in a smaller cost for high ρ 
values. These observations are readily understood in that 
a larger number of MTs in the LA or a smaller MT arrival 
rate to the LA results in a smaller RWL (i.e., RL), thus 
reducing the call delivery cost of the proposed strategy 
(which especially benefits high ρ values). Furthermore, a 
larger M results in smaller 
1
p  and
p2
, reducing both the 
expected location update cost and calls delivery cost in 
the SB strategy.
V. CONCLUSIONS
A SB location tracking strategy has been proposed in 
this paper which is based on the modified version of 
group registration technique. It uses one repository as a 
central database which stores the information about the 
mobile terminal and also the updated location of it. An 
analytical  model  of  the  strategy  is  described  and 
numerical  result  is  presented  for  the  performance 
evaluation. The proposed strategy is compared to IS-41, 
the LAS and the GR strategies and it is observed that the 
proposed strategy can achieve a cost reduction over a

wide range of CMRs. Moreover, the proposed strategy is 
based on the concept of central database and storage of 
information  about  MT  deployed  in  existing  mobile 
systems and does not require the system to collect the 
mobility  and  calling  statistics  for  individual  mobile 
terminals. The proposed strategy work well for low CMR.
