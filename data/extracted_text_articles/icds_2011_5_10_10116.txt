Abstract - The Internet affects the behavior of the young
generations; it causes a mixture of virtual publicity,
amentia and idiopathy. Internet addicts suffer some
radiation defects due to their long sessions, this may
result in blood ionization, leukemia or eye cataract. The
paper presents a statistical study on health engineering
concerning the effects of Internet on the Arab Society. It
presents also some guidelines for a better Internet use.
Keywords – IPS; ISP; HDI.

INTRODUCTION
Internet handles data among
hosts in different
sites.
Information transfer via Internet results in technology
evolution and economy developments. Internet handles e-
commerce, educational sites, e-mail, chat, data transfer,
etc.,; it can handle twitters, virus and spam. The use of
Internet doubles annually. Many statistics were developed to
evaluate the usability of Internet. The next sections explore
statistical studies about Internet users, the harms and
benefits of Internet, wireless Internet and their harms, and
explore a regional study for Internet users in Egypt.
II. STATISTICAL STUDIES ABOUT INTERNET USERS
In USA, by 2005 [1], it was declared that the yearly access
to Internet was about 10.8 millions PC's, 46.1 millions of
mobile systems, and 1.7 millions of PDA's. This concludes
that the mobile systems are the dominant agents, because
ease of use. In USA, by 2005, about 55.3% have Internet
access [1]. Statistical study for Internet users is shown in
Figure 1.
Figure 1. Growth in Internet over the world [1]
The studies by 2006 [2] indicated that 35.8% of the world
population have computers, and only 15.7% have Internet
access. This percent increases in the Asia by a rate higher
than in Europe. Conrad [2], expected Internet users by 2010
to be 60%. The world's economic crises reduced this ratio
[3]. The percentage of Internet access depends on the user's
age; as shown in fig2. The dominant user ages are between
18 and 30; these form 52% of the users. They visit adult,
news, and job sites. The percentage of using Internet
decreases
for
ages
higher
than
50
years.
Internet
performance is improved annually by about 40% [3].
Performance of Internet is estimated via set of metrics like:
admissibility, sustainability, trip delays, and loss ratio.
These metrics affect the users' temper and Internet returns.
Figure 2. Statistical study for using Internet among ages in USA [1]
III. INTERNET USAGE
Middle east, Asia, and Africa still use Internet with rates
about 6%, but with a high growth rate. The highest Internet
use is accomplished in Japan and North America, as shown
in Figure 3.
Figure 3.a- Average use for Internet and average growth rate [2]
Most users use Internet via home ADSL, Internet centers
and telephone lines as shown in
Fig 4[4]. In France, by
2005, a study shows that more than 55% of people use
Internet, 26% of them use modem dialup, 53% use ADSL,
other 21% use wireless cells.

Figure 3b. Percentage of Internet use in a set of monitored
countries [4]
The rate of using wireless net increases while the dialup
rates reduce. In Arab countries, Arab Emerit has the highest
ratio for Internet users (about 30%). Saudi Arabia users are
about 10% , while in Egypt users are about 12% of
population, as shown in Figure 4.

IV. INTERNET ECONOMY
ISPs develop advertisements, adult videos, news, free
software, free email, messengers, IDM accelerators, on line
games, search engines, etc., to lure users to
spend the
longest time on Internet. The average money spend for
Internet per month over the world exceeds $5 billions [6].
The peak periods of using Internet are about 10AM, and
9PM. This time varies due to the geographic timing among
the countries. Therefore, the Internet load is almost regular.
The access to the Internet depends on levels of life, and
culture as shown in Figure 5. It was noticed that people with
high income, use internet with more ratios. The accessed
sites varies depending on the ages and cultures of users. It
was noticed in US and Europe [6] that 87% of the families
that have colleagues, have access to Internet, while less than
70% of the families that have no colleagues, access the
Internet. The e-commerce are the most objectives, while the
educational sites have low access rates and form about2% of
the accessed sites [5]. Figure 5, indicates relations between
HDI (Human Development Index), and the use of Internet.

Spammers and Intruders destroy information and emails.
Spammers catch the emails of victims by offering free
services, forum, online games, chat rooms, messengers,
videos, pornographic sites, anonymous connections, fake
websites, lottery scams, etc. USA, China, Korea, and Russia
deliver more than 93% of the world’s spasm [8]. Regarding
the languages, the percentage of Chinese emerged sites is
14%, Arabic sites is 12.8%, while the English sites are
emerged by a rate more than 70% [8] as shown in Figure 6.
Anti spam programs can detect only less than 80% of the
spam. Spam filters may cause negative detections (reject the
needed messages) or positives detections (reject un-needed
messages), according to the used keywords. Curious and
Intruders form more than 40% of spammers. Spam data
consume bandwidth of Internet [8]. This results in less
available bandwidth and more paid fees for the same data. A
statistical e-mail spam was declared by ITU [7] as shown in
fig6. The plot indicates that the advertisements trade form
about 50%, while adult dates, pharmacy and chat form more
than 30%.

In 2006, ITU recorded an average spam with $55 billion. In
2007, this rate was increased to more than $100 billion [8].
In 2008, the estimated cost of Internet spam in US was
about $17billions, and formed more than 92% of the
received e-mail [ 9]. Filtering spam improves the bandwidth,
admissibility, sustainability and serviceability of the Internet.
About 80% of spammers in America and Europe are
malicious. The other 20% entities use Internet mails for
marketing in low cost. E-mail spam grew exponentially, it
comprises more than 85% of the e-mail among the world,
which results that about 85% of Internet utility waste for
annoyments [10]. This decreases the returnee for the
Internet vendors. Table 2 indicates the countries that spread
spam around the world.
TABLE II. COUNTRIES THAT SPREAD SPAM [9]
EUIMC estimated the cost of "junk email" to be €10 billion
[10] in 2005, while the spam cost in USA exceeded
$13billion in 2007 [8]. In 2008[9], about $7billions were
recorded
for
adult
pharmaceutical
spam.
Anti-spam
programs were developed to avoid attacks, protect and filter
the junk e-mail, block spam, and terminate spammers'
accounts. Spam Avoidance Routines (SAR) are saved in
firewalls and routers to block the spam spreading. SAR
catch the duplicated messages and delete them. Many SAR
use statistical filters like: Mozilla thunderbird, mailwasher,
and spam assassination software. SAR list spammers, deny
their access, use learning techniques to analyze the content
of e-mails, and filter spams [10].
V. INTERNET HARMS FOR HUMAN HEALTH
Taylor
[11]
concluded
a
relation
between
computer
exposure
and
early
cataract.
In
2001
[12],
a
study
investigated a form of eye cancer called "melanoma" caused
for computer addicts. The research sounds that there is a
threefold increase in eye cancers among people who
regularly addict the use of Internet. Long exposure periods,
cause brain headache and idiocy. Long periods of hearing
clips, using headphone may deteriorate eardrum. The
radiation penetrates the organic cells of chronics, and affects
the regularity of endocrine and pineal gland[15]. Cataract,
125

results in loss of lens' transparency, and may lead to
blindness. Radiation suppresses the body's immune system
[13,14]. HCI has limited the exposure power to
be
less
than 10 mw. The electromagnet radiations affect the skin
and may lead to melanoma. Dermatologists in American
Cancer Society (ACS) declared that 20% of USA Internet
chronics has melanoma that may lead to skin cancer [15].
The wireless Internet has the main effective ratio. ITU [3]
had stated that the level of service sustainability affect the
user temper and may led him nervous or gloomy.
Computers, mobiles and wireless LANs, radiate harmonics
that cause blood ionizing. The harmonics cause cell heating
and results in disturbing cell functions. Although the power
of the harmonics is low, but the long sessions increase the
doses that damage the cells[16]. Radiations interact and
generate disturbed genes that perform malfunctions. When
the structure of the cells is altered, this may result in
cancers. An acute radiation dose is defined to be 10 radon,
during a period of 3 hours or more. This causes eye
inflammation. If the dose is greater than 100 radon, This
may
damage
the
lymphatic
tissues
and
may
cause
convulsions [13]. The radiations harms depend on the power
of the electromagnet radiations that is absorbed by the
human body. When the power of a channel becomes weak, a
hand over is assigned to another channel with a higher
power.
The
high
power
signals
are
more
harmful.
Electromagnet radiations, thermal radiations, and ionizing
radiations, cause unbalanced cellular performance which
may lead to cancer.
Bluetooth radiations, and radiations
produced at private WLANs, GSM, may lead also to cancer
[15]. The mobile Internet use 10 watts for upload and MSC
use
100 watts for download. This power is exponentially
decreases with the distance from MSC. Electromagnet
radiations penetrate the human tissues to a depth depends on
their frequency, and power. The high frequencies and high
power
penetrate
more
distances
and
result
in
more
harms[16]. These radiations are absorbed causing heat,
which disturbs the functions of human cells, and may cause
fever or cancer. Edwards[17] recorded
a relationship
between Internet addicts and the cataracts. The study
showed that the prolonged exposure to radiation, may lead
to cell damages and these damages accumulate and may be
unhealed. Cataracts result in loss the transparency of lens.
If cataracts are untreated, this may lead to blindness.
Radiation explodes the eyes' veins, causes high pressure in
the eyes, and deteriorates the vision. Wireless radiations
also reduce the efficiency of the immune system. Posluns
[19] reported that a cell phone call lasting more than two
minutes affects the activity of a child's brain for up to an
hour afterwards. This brain electricity leads to a lack of
concentration, and aggressive behaviors [19]. Neurologists
reported a fourfold increase in the risk of Alzheimer's
disease for persons who have jobs with EMF exposure [15].
About 65% of the sites are covered with wired links, about
30% are covered with wireless and satellite links, the other
regions
are
unmonitored
[18].
These
areas
are
rare
populations on south America, middle Africa,
Arctic and
Azerbaijan regions. Cables are more radiation immune.
WHO and ITU recommended replacing the satellite links
with fiber links [16]. The satellite links are used at the
countries
that
suffer
from
poor
telecommunication
infrastructures [18]. Fig 7, indicates that the number of
monitored sites doubles every three years.

VI. STATISTICAL EXPERIMENTS IN EGYPTIAN
UNIVERSITIES
ITU [3] used the average growth rate for using Internet as
a HDI. A study was done for Electrical Engineering
students
in
Tanta,
Zaqaziq,
and
Kafrel-sheikh
universities. The study assured that about 60% of the
students, visit Internet sites at least two hours per week,
about 7.6% use internet for less than an hour per week, as
shown in Figure 9. The average time of weekly Internet
use in these campuses, is doubled every couple of years.
The rates of
Internet access are reduced at vacations by
a factor between 10-40%. Users in age between 18-54
years
form
more
than
92%
of
internet
users.
Internet addicts may daily access Internet for more than
ten hours. About 83% of the accessed sites are by users
whom age less than 30years. These users concern on
chat, clips, news, forums, and movies. This concludes
that the percentage of guided Internet use is less than
20% of the total use, more than 80% of internet economy
waste for twitters and more than 80% of internet outlay
has a negative returnee for time and money.

usage
A study was done in 20 Cybers in Tanta, Zaqaziq and
Kafrel- sheikh cities (Egypt) during 2009, the sample
size was 200 healthy persons, 100 of them are Internet
addicts, with ages between 40 and 60years. This study
indicated during the year, that addicts suffer from
convulsion, 20% more than these that are not addicts.
Their eyes suffer iris inflammation, and cataracts,15%
more than these that are not addicts.
Radiation for long
sessions causes blood ionization, and high pressure, 15%
of the Internet addicts suffer from high brain electricity,
heart attack, and leukemia more than these that are not
addicts.
About 14% suffer hype, obesity, tingling,
backaches, anal fissure, piles and muscles weakness. The
family divorce rate was increased with 12% due to the
virtual relations among the Internet. About 6% has
paranoia, schizophrenia due to chat sessions.
VII. CONCLUSION AND REMARKS
The Internet consumes our time, money and health. The
paper discussed the harms due to the ill-guided use of
Internet, concerning the economy and health. The paper
presented a statistical study for the Egyptian society
concerning the problems of Internet addicts, and effect of
wireless networking. The paper concludes the next guides
for Internet users to reduce the harms. It is preferred to use
LCD screens with desktop systems, connected to fiber land
cables to reduce the effect of wireless networks. User must
reduce the use of Laptop to avoid the electromagnet
radiations. The use of Internet, must be not more than 2
hours, then take a break and resume the session later. This
helps the body to discharge the accumulated absorbed

radiations.
People
using
glasses
must
use
frameless
eyeglass, with no wires, because the wires act as antennas
that focus the radiation directly onto brain and eyes [11].
Internet addicts must take anti-oxidants and zinc doses, to
reduce the effect of radiations on blood ionization. Zinc
protects the eye from oxidative damage [13]. Long periods
of
exposure
cause
headaches,
dizziness,
lack
in
concentration, eye irritation, depression, anxiety, fatigue,
muscle spasms, and numbness. Radiations disturb the pineal
gland that regulates sleep, blood pressure, cholesterol levels,
and immune system [17]. Therefore, the guided use of
Internet, will save at least 80% of our time against Internet,
save effort, health, and result in a perfect returnee.
