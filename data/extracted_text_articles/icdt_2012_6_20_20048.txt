Abstract—Mobile networks have been continuously developed 
from 3.5G to 3.9G/4G  with high speed wireless  technologies 
(i.e., broadband mobile network). So, mobile networks need to 
provide more sufficient QoS  mechanism to provide enhanced 
user’s satisfaction.  In this paper, we propose a new adaptive 
resource allocation mechanism based on utility function 
borrowed from the field of microeconomics. Through the 
simulation and calculation evaluation, we show that adaptive 
resource allocation based on user preferences is effective.   
Keywords- QoS; utility function; mobile network;

 INTRODUCTION  
Currently mobile networks are being evolved from 3.5G 
to 3.9G/4G,  which is broadband mobile network, integrated 
into IP core network based on IMS (IP Multimedia Sub-
system). In this environment, it is essential to provide 
sufficient QoS (Quality of Service) mechanism which 
enables different services to provide enhanced user 
satisfaction. QoS for mobile networks is being studied 
mainly in 3GPP [1], but still deal with only class oriented 
mechanism. For example, QoS class is defined according to 
the service types, and mapping between QCI (QoS Class 
Identifier) and DSCP (DiffServ Code Point) is studied [2] [3]. 
So, it is required that QoS mechanism has to provide more 
flexible  resource allocation mechanism based on each user’s 
preferences.  
In this paper, we propose a new adaptive resource 
allocation mechanism based on each user’s preferences by 
using the utility function borrowed from the field of 
microeconomics.  The utility function qualifies the value 
that a user perceives for all possible amount of resources 
allocated. The field of microeconomics addresses the issue 
of resource allocation when many users compete for a 
limited amount of resource. Microeconomics has been used 
to address problems in networks by several authors. Some 
authors use it to address pricing issues [4] [5] [6] [7], and 
others to the problem of resource allocation [8] [9].Utility 
functions have been used by other authors for resource 
allocation in networks [7] [10]. These papers develop 
distributed mechanisms for resource allocation assuming 
that the network does not have knowledge of the utility 
functions of users. Our work is different in that we assume 
that the network has knowledge of the utility functions of all 
users.

BASIC TECHNOLOGIES 
A. Utility Function 
Utility is defined in the field of microeconomics that the 
level of satisfaction acquired from the consumption of 
properties such as services or commodities [11]. The user’s 
total utility obtained from a network service will depend on 
several QoS metrics, such as throughput, delay, and jitter. In 
the throughput perspective, the user’s utility depends on the 
bandwidth availability in the network to satisfy the resource 
requirement of service. Fig. 1 shows the example of utility 
function regarding the throughput allocated to user. User 
should define or select multiple utility functions for each 
service because the utility functions will be different from 
the kinds of services (e.g., streaming service).    
Let us consider the network situation in which we have M 
users in the system. We let Uί (rί) denote the utility derived by 
user’s flow ί for a bandwidth allocation rί and C is the total 
link capacity. User ί is allocated rί units of resource that is the 
i-th component of the solution r=[r1, r2, …, rM] of the 
following optimization problem: [12] 
M  
Max     Σ Uί (rί)                         (1) 
[r1,r2, … rM]    ί=1 
           M 
    subject to Σ rί  ≤ C         
ί=1 
       rί  ≥ 0 for ί = 1,2, .. , M  
 
In this network situation, in order to adopt utility function 
to the network QoS management, the following requirements 
should be satisfied.

 
Continuous utility functions should be represented 
in discrete functions in order to allocate the resource 
unit where the discrete segmental value of utility 
function is compared each other.  
 
Resource allocation should be done based on 
discrete utility function satisfying above  (1) 
 
Fig. 2 shows the example of discrete utility functions, 
which is the case that the two lines are differentiated by users. 
This value can be thought as the price that a user would be 
willing to pay to obtain a specific amount of resource. For 
example, in the upper line to obtain the throughput ri-1, a user 
will pay Ui-1 ($/second) and to obtain the throughput ri, a user 
will pay U i($/second). In Fig. 2, the slope of utility (ΔU) is 
more important since it means a unit price for a unit 
bandwidth. If a flow is a high priority flow, it has a higher Δ
U than other flows.  
Following, there are the properties of discrete utility 
functions: 
 
Non-negativity: U(r) ≥ 0 for all r ≥ 0. Obviously the 
users cannot associate a negative utility with a 
positive resource allocation. 
 
Non-decreasing nature: U(r) has to be a non-
decreasing function. Clearly also is the fact that 
users cannot associate a higher utility with a smaller 
allocation that with a higher allocation. 
 
B. MSS Resouce Allocation Algorithm 
 To satisfy (1), the MSS (Maximum Segmental Slope) 
resource allocation algorithm [12] has been developed by 
our colleagues based on the standard optimization problem 
solving method [15].  The main characteristic of this 
algorithm is that it allows resource allocation maximizing 
the user’s satisfaction by allocating a unit of resource firstly 
to the flow that has the highest segmental slope.  But, this 
algorithm is rather straightforward and it should be updated 
to enhance the performance. For example, some  heuristic 
sorting algorithm should be considered because the major 
portion of the algorithm is a sorting process.

ADAPTIVE RESOURCE ALLOCATION 
MECHANISM 
A. "etwork Architecture Model 
We assume the conceptual network architectural model 
as depicted in Fig. 3,  based on 3.9G network (i.e., LTE) 
which comprises RAN(Radio Access Network) with MNs 
(Mobile Nodes), and CN (Core Network) with two main 
players: the QS (QoS Server) and the MM(Mobility 
Manager)  [7].  The ARs (Access Router) in CN are key 
control points in the network. They are IP routers that are 
one IP hop distant from the mobile node via BS (Base 
Station, i.e., e-Node B in case of LTE). All data packets to 
and from the mobile node, and signaling messages between 
the mobile node and various servers in the network pass 
through the ARs. The CRs (Core Router) are high speed 
routers that lie in the core network. The main function of QS 
is an admission control based on the adaptive resource 
allocation mechanism proposed in the next section. The MM 
manages MN’s location information where the MN is 
located in the mobile network, and performs handover based 
on the handover policies provided by the network operator.  
The MM interacts with QS during the call setup and 
termination. 
 
B. Adaptive Resource Allocation Mechanism 
There are already some studies in which the utility 
function is adopted to QoS [13] [14].  But, these studies do 
not deal with the detailed adaptation algorithm considered 
the flow (i.e., consider caller and callee side together) 
proposed in this paper. Under the assumption that network 
has knowledge of utility function for all users, we adopt 
MSS algorithm from caller to callee side together.  Fig. 4 
shows the proposed a new adaptive resource allocation 
mechanism and details of the mechanism are as follows.

a) Initial phase(1-4),  
QS provides AR’s flow list for the caller and callee side. 
1).  QS receives resource allocation request from caller 
or caller’s AR called AR1. 
2).  QS generates this new flow’s entry called fi which 
has the information of its caller’s access router (fi –
AR1), and callee’s access router (fi –AR2). 
3)&4).  From previous step 2, QS generates a list of the 
existing flows that need to be re-allocated due to fi’s 
joining. It is called fi-re-flow-list. This list is made of 
flows that are passing through the caller and callee ARs 
and that are affected by fi joining. For example, fi-AR1-
re-flow-list  and fi-AR1-re-flow-list  
 
b) The second phase(5-7),  
Whenever new flow is added, for AR’s existed flows 
for both of caller and callee side, temporary bandwidth 
for each existing flows and new flow are calculated 
according to the MSS algorithm. For the new flow, 
select the minimum value between caller’s temporary 
bandwidth and callee’s temporary bandwidth and set it 
as middle allocation value.  
5).  By using the utility function based on MSS 
algorithm, a temporary allocation is made to fi and the

flows in the caller AR list. So, fi gets fi-er-alloc 
(bandwidth/sec), and the flows in fi-AR1-re-flow-list 
gets Σfi-AR1-re-flow-list-temp-alloc = [temp-alloc-a + 
temp-alloc-b + temp-alloc-c + ...] ). 
6).  Same procedures are done for the flow fi at the  
callee AR. Flow fi gets fi-ee-alloc (bandwidth/sec), and 
the flows in the list for callee AR(fi-AR2-re-flow-list) 
get Σfi-AR2-re-flow-list-temp-alloc = [temp-alloc-x + 
temp- alloc-y + temp-alloc-z + ...] . 
7).  QS calculates middle allocation for fi, this value is 
called fi-mid-alloc which is the minimum of [fi-er-alloc,  
fi -ee-alloc]. 
 
c) The third phase(8-11),  
1)  Receives Resource Allocation  Request  from 
AR1,  AR2 
2) Generates new flow’s entry called fi 
3) Generates Caller’s current 
flow table list : fi-AR1-re-flow-list 
for re-allocation due to joining fi.  
4) Generates Callee’s current flow 
table list :fi-AR2-re-flow-list for re-
allocation due to joining fi. 
5) Temporary allocation for fi and 
Caller’s current flow table list by 
using utility function based MSS 
Algorithm :  
fi gets fi-er-alloc(bandwidth/sec), 
fi-AR1-re-flow-list gets by using MSS 
algorithm 
Σfi-AR1-re-flow-list-temp-alloc = 
[temp-alloc-a + temp-alloc-b + temp-
alloc-c + ...] 
6) Temporary allocation for fi and 
Callee’s current flow table list by using 
utility function based MSS Algorithm ):  
fi gets fi-ee-alloc(bandwidth/sec), 
fi-AR2-re-flow-list gets by using MSS 
algorithm 
Σfi-AR2-re-flow-list-temp-alloc =  
[temp-alloc-x + temp-alloc-y + temp-
alloc-z + ...] 
 
 
7)  QS calculates middle allocation for fi :  
fi-mid-alloc=min[fi-er-alloc, fi -ee-alloc]. 
8)  In order to detects remained bw, 
recalculate bw for other flows in 
caller’s AR: Compare each flow bw for 
fi-AR1-re-flow-list, fi-AR2-re-flow-list 
then select minimum value for each 
flows.  
QS sums up  
Σfi –AR1-re-flow-list-last-alloc = 
[last-alloc-a + last-alloc-b + last-alloc-c 
+ ...] 
9)  In order to detects remained bw, 
recalculate bw for other flows in callee’s 
AR: Compare each flow bw for fi-AR2-re-
flow-list, fi-AR2-re-flow-list then select 
minimum value for each flows.  
QS sums up  
Σfi -AR2-re-flow-list-last-alloc = 
[last-alloc-x + last-alloc-y + last-alloc-z 
+ ...] 
10) Remained bw in Caller side AR  
fi-AR1-remain-bw = (fi –AR1-total-bw 
- fi-mid-alloc - Σfi-AR1-re-flow-list-
last-alloc) 
11) Remained bw in Callee side AR  
fi-AR2-remain-bw = (fi –AR2-total-bw - 
fi-mid-alloc - Σfi-AR2-re-flow-list-last-
alloc) 
12) QS calculates remained bw for –AR1, -AR1 = 
min [fi –AR1-remain-bw , fi-AR1-remain-bw ] 
13) Final allocation for  fi = [fi -mid-alloc + remain-bw]

In order to detect remained bandwidth for both caller 
side AR and callee side AR, compare with the temporary 
value for each existed flow’s in caller side AR and one 
of callee side, select minimum value and set as a last 
allocation for each existed flows, then sum up all as the 
last allocation for each caller side AR and callee side AR.  
8). QS will detect if there is remaining un-utilized 
bandwidth in the ARs. This is done by re-calculating the 
bandwidth of the other flows in fi-AR1-re-flow-list 
similarly to the process above. The calculation is done 
for the corresponding callee-AR of every other flow in 
the list. And again a minimum is selected for each flow. 
This is the last allocation for the other flows in the caller 
AR, resulting in last-alloc-a, last-alloc-b, last-alloc-c. 
Finally, QS sums up these values [last-alloc-a + last-
alloc-b + last-alloc-c + ...],  which can be expressed in 
Σfi-AR1-re-flow-list-last-alloc. 
9).  In the similar manner, QS re-allocates each flow in 
fi-AR2-re-flow-list and results in Σfi–AR2-re-flow-list-
last-alloc which is the sum of [last-alloc-x + last-alloc-y 
+ last-alloc-z + ...]. 
10). Then the remaining bandwidth in caller side AR is 
fi-AR1-remain-bw = (fi –AR1-total-bw - fi-mid-alloc 
– Σfi-AR1-re-flow-list-last-alloc). 
11).  Similarly, the remaining bandwidth in the callee 
side AR is calculated in the way as above and results 
in fi –AR2-remain-bw = (fi-AR2-total-bw – fi-mid-
alloc – Σfi –AR2-re-flow-list-last-alloc). 
 
d) Final phase(12-13),  
Compares the remained bandwidth for caller side AR 
with the one for callee side AR, then select minimum 
value and set as a network remained value. Then, 
allocate the middle allocation bandwidth and remained 
bandwidth to the new flow. 
12).  The remaining bandwidth for AR1 and AR2 for the 
flow fi  is remain-bw = min [fi –AR1-remain-bw , fi-
AR2-remain-bw ]. 
13).  At last, as the result, the final allocation for fi = [fi -
mid-alloc + remain-bw]. 
 
IV. 
EVALUATION 
A. "etwork Topokogy and Conditions 
In order to evaluate the feasibility of our proposal, we 
have developed the model system by using NS2 simulator 
with the topology shown in Fig. 5.  We have implemented 
the proposed adaptive resource allocation mechanism. All 
the entities in the model system are implemented on the 
NS2. It is assumed that location registration is conducted 
before call setup. When a MN enters into an area covered by 
BS, MN sends Registration Request message to its AR. 
Then the MN’s location is recorded in the Location server 
(i.e.MM). Each AR has 4 units of bandwidth to administrate 
(1 unit = 40 kbps) and the data flows use RTP packets. In  
 
Figure 5.  Simulated Network Model System 
 
this topology, MN1, 2, 3 and 4 under AR1 have session with 
MN5, 9, 13, and 17 respectively. Each node request 4 units 
of bandwidth (1unit = 40 kbps) and each AR has 4 units of 
bandwidth to administrate (1 unit = 40 kbps). In detail, the 
bandwidth between AR and CR, AR and MN, are 160kbps 
(4units). The data flows are using RTP packet and are called 
Flow1, 2, 3 and 4. Packet size is 250Byte. In the simulation 
video phone service is assumed as the application.  
 
B. Simulation Results    
Fig. 6 shows the bandwidth allocation of each user’s flow 
when a handover takes place. Utility value of Flow B, 
between MN2 and MN9, Flow S between MN6 and MN10, 
and Flow H (handover), between MN8 and MN14 are listed 
in Table I. Flow H starts its call at 30 sec and MN8 starts to 
move toward to new AR (AR3) at 40 sec. Before Flow H 
enters to AR3, there are two flows in AR3, our algorithm 
will therefore allocate 2 units of bandwidth to each flow 
(Flow H and Flow Sl). Once a new MN having an additional 
utility function joins to an AR, there is a need to re-allocate 
the existing resources among the users in the AR according 
to the utility function that the users have contracted.  Hence, 
when Flow H enters the area of AR3, the allocation 
becomes Flow B : Flow H : Flow S = 2 : 1 : 1 units. The 
reason for this allocation is that Flow H has higher utility 
than Flow H, and therefore it is not affected by Flow H 
joining the AR. On the other side, Flow S has lower utility 
than Flow H and therefore one unit is re-allocated to Flow H.

Fig. 7 shows another  bandwidth allocation result for 4 
flows. The utility value of Flow1 from MN1 to MN5, Flow2 
from MN2 to MN9, Flow3 from MN3 to MN13, Flow4 
from MN4 to MN17 are listed in Table2. For example, for 
Flow1, the utility values are 0.9 in U1 (0-40kbps), 0.3 in U2 
(40-80bkps),0.15 in U3 (80-120kbps),  and 0.1 in U4 (120-
160kbps) respectively. Flow1 enters the network at time 10s. 
As it is the first flow in the system, it is allocated the entire 
AR1’s bandwidth. At time 20s, Flow2 enters the network. 
Then at time 30s, with Flow3’s join, the allocation becomes 
Flow1:Flow2:Flow3 = 2:1:1. Finally, after Flow4 enters, 
each flow has same bandwidth and this is equal to the 
allocation that expected. We should consider both the caller 
side and callee side. However, in this case the caller side is 
congested and the callee side is not congested at all in each 
flow so that it is enough that only the caller side is 
considered.

Based on Fig. 7, the bandwidth allocation can be 
explained as follows. 
1) At time 10s there is only Flow 1 so that 4 units 
(160kbps) are allocated to Flow1.  
2) At the time 20s, Flow2 enters the network. According 
to calculation based on utility values in Table 1, 2 units 
(80kbps) are allocated to Flow1 and Flow2 respectively.   
3) 
At the time 30s, Flow3 enters the network. Then 2 units

(80kbps) are allocated to Flow 1, and 1 unit (40kbps) is 
allocated to Flow 2 and Flow 3 respectively.  
4) At the time 40s, Fkow4 enters the network. Then  1 
unit(40kbps) are allocated to Flow1, Flow2, Flow3 and  
Flow4 respectively. 
Fig. 8 shows the total bandwidth allocation  result of the 
current  method (i.e. static resource allocation method). The 
situation in  Fig.7 is the same as Fig.6. That is, at time 10s, 
20s, 30s and 40s, Flow1, Flow2, Flow3 and Flow4 enters 
the network via AR1 respectively. The allocated bandwidth 
is fixed (40Kbps) and always the same for all users. So the 
total bandwidth at AR1 is increased from 40kbps to 
160kbps from  10s to 40s. On the other hand, the total 
bandwidth of the adaptive allocation method is constantly 
160kbps.  
We have calculated and compared the total user 
satisfaction in the case of Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. The calculation 
result  is as follows,

C. Considerations 
Through the simulation and calculation we have 
confirmed the following facts.  
1) First, we have confirmed that the allocation in the 
simulation is equal to the allocation calculated theoretically. 
Actually,  the proposed  algorithm has been simulated and it 
is confirmed that allocation in Fig. 6 and in Fig. 7 are equal 
to the allocation calculated theoretically.  
2) Second, from the user’s viewpoint, users can obtain the 
more satisfied service by this mechanism. Normally when 
the bandwidth is fully utilized (i.e., congested), the new 
service request is rejected. But by this mechanism, the new 
service can be prioritized even in the congested situation 
case.  
3) Third, from the operator’s viewpoint, the revenue of 
operators will be increased by using this mechanism. 
Actually by this mechanism, it is confirmed that the 
bandwidth can be utilized at maximum. Moreover, if service 
price is linked to the value of the utility function, the user 
will pay more payment so that the operators can obtain more 
revenue and profit.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we have proposed a new adaptive resource 
allocation mechanism based on the utility function. As the 
next step, we can expand this mechanism on the following 
items.  
1) In case that some of existing user’s utility values are 
lower, and new users having higher utility value are joining, 
some of existing user’s flow may be suddenly suspended 
based on our proposed mechanism. This is issue to be 
solved from the service quality viewpoint. However, even 
in this case, the existing flow can be continued with some 
minimum bandwidth if we modify MSS algorithm and the 
procedure described in Fig, 4.  
2) In this paper, it is not clearly mentioned who will 
assign the utility function for each flow. About this we 
assume two cases; first case is that the mobile operators can 
define utility functions for flows and save the information in 
QS, second case is that mobile users can select a utility 
function for a flow and send this information to QS by using 
signaling. resources.  
3) We have focused on only bandwidth allocation, but 
other QoS metrics such as the delay or jitter can be studied 
in the next step. Also, we have to consider the performance 
aspect of the proposal, especially how to decrease the call 
setup delay by applying more efficient and heuristic sorting 
algorithm because the major portion of MSS algorithm is a 
sorting process.
