Abstract— This paper presents an introduction to 
Evolving Systems, which are autonomously controlled 
subsystems which self-assemble into a new Evolved 
System with a higher purpose. Evolving Systems of 
aerospace structures often require additional control 
when assembling to maintain stability during the entire 
evolution process. This is the concept of Adaptive Key 
Component Control which operates through one specific 
component to maintain stability during the evolution. In 
addition 
this 
control 
must 
overcome 
persistent 
disturbances that occur while the evolution is in 
progress. We present theoretical results for the 
successful operation of Adaptive Key Component 
control in the presence of such disturbances and an 
illustrative example. 
 
Keywords- adaptive control; aerospace systems. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
Evolving Systems [1]-[2] are autonomously controlled 
subsystems which self-assemble into a new Evolved System 
with a higher purpose. Evolving Systems of aerospace 
structures often require additional control when assembling 
to maintain stability during the entire evolution process [3]-
[5]. An adaptive key component controller has been shown 
to restore stability in Evolving Systems that would 
otherwise lose stability during evolution [6]. The adaptive 
key component controller uses a direct adaptation control 
law to restore stability to the Evolving System through a 
subset of the input and output ports on one key component 
of the Evolving System. Much of the detail of Evolving 
Systems appears in the chapter [8]. In this paper, we will 
deal with the situation where persistent disturbances can 
appear in some components and must be mitigated by the 
adaptive key component controller. Such disturbances will 
often be attendant in actively controlled rendezvous and 
docking. 
The control laws used by the adaptive key component 
controller to restore stability in an Evolving System are 
guaranteed to have bounded gains and asymptotic tracking 
if the Evolved System is almost strictly dissipative. Hence, 
it is desirable to know when the dissipativity traits of the 
subsystem components, including the key component, are 
inherited in an Evolving System. We present results 
describing when an Evolving System will inherit the almost 
strict passivity traits of its subsystem components. Then we 
will present an adaptive key component controller that 
restores asymptotic stability with bounded adaptive gains 
and mitigates the effect of persistent disturbances during 
evolution.

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF EVOLVING 
SYSTEMS 
A mathematical formulation of a nonlinear time-invariant 
Evolving System is given here. Consider a system of L 
components of individually, actively controlled subsystems 
which can be described by the following equations for the ith 
component:

together, the 
ij
 ’s evolve from 0 to 1. 
The components of the Evolving System are actively 
controlled by means of local control. Local control means 
dependence only on local state or local output information, 
i.e., 
 
ui  hi(xi) or ui  hi(yi). In general, the local controller 
on the ith component would have the form:

INHERITANCE OF SUBSYSTEM TRAITS IN EVOLVING 
SYSTEMS 
We say a subsystem trait, such as stability, is inherited 
when the Evolved System retains the characteristic of the 
trait from the subsystem. Previous papers have examined the 
inheritance of stability and shown that stability is not a 
generally inherited trait [3]-[5] and [8]. Inheritance of almost 
strict passivity of subsystems is desirable in Evolving 
Systems that use an adaptive key component controller to 
restore stability. 
In previous papers, [5]-[6], a key component controller 
has been proposed to restore stability to Evolving Systems 
which would otherwise lose stability during evolution. The 
design approach used by the key component controller is for 
the control and sensing of the components to remain local 
and unaltered except in the case of one key component 
which has additional local control added to stabilize the 
system during evolution. The key component controller 
operates solely through a single set of input-output ports on 
the key component, see Figure 1.  
 
Figure 1.  Key component controller. 
Only the key component of the Evolving System needs 
modification to restore the inheritance of stability. A clear 
advantage of the key component design is that components 
can be reused in many different configurations of Evolving 
Systems without the need for component redesign. The reuse 
of components which are space-qualified, or at least 
previously designed and unit tested, could reduce the overall 
system development and testing time and should result in a 
higher quality system with potentially significant cost 
savings and risk mitigation. 
In many aerospace environments and applications, the 
parameters of a system are poorly known and difficult to 
obtain. Adaptive key component controllers, which make use 
of a direct adaptation control law, are a good design choice 
for restoring stability in Evolving Systems where access to 
precisely known parametric values is limited. The sufficient 
condition for an Evolving System with an adaptive key 
component controller to be guaranteed to have bounded 
gains and to have asymptotic output tracking is that the 
system be almost strictly dissipative. So, we are interested in 
the conditions under which the inheritance of almost strict 
dissipativity can be guaranteed in Evolving Systems.

They are only equivalent if (8a) is an equality. (When 
equality holds in (8) and (9), the property is known as Strict 
Passivity.)

descriptions of persistent disturbances were first used in [9] 
to describe signals of known form but unknown amplitude.

sinusoidal disturbances can be described by

VI. 
ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE  
Example 1, which follows, is a two component linear 
flexible structure Evolving System. The components of 
Example 1 are stable when they are unconnected 
components, but the Evolving System fails to inherit the 
stability of the components. This example will be used to 
demonstrate the inheritance and lack of inheritance of almost 
strict dissipativity in Evolving Systems.

When two components join to form an Evolved System, 
at their point of contact, their velocities are equal and the 
forces exerted are equal and opposite. If the two components 
are given by 
f1,v1 
 and 
f2,v2 
, then the contact 
dynamics of the Evolved System can be represented by:

This connection can be modeled as the admittance of one 
component connected in feedback with the impedance of the 
other component [1]-[3]. When we use this idea of the 
joining of two components of an Evolving System as the 
feedback connection of their admittance and impedance, we 
can apply Theorem 1 from above to determine whether 
almost strict dissipativty is inherited by the Evolved System. 
The subsystem components from Example 1 are stable in 
closed-loop form when they are unconnected, i.e., 
12  0
. 
When
12 1
, the system is fully evolved and it has a 
closed-loop eigenvalue at 0.17, resulting in an unstable 
Evolved System. 
A Simulink model was created to implement an adaptive 
key component controller for Example 1 as described in the 
previous section. Simulations were run in which the 
connection parameter,
12
, ranged from 0 to 1, allowing the 
system to go from unconnected components to a fully 
Evolved System. The key component controller was able to 
maintain system stability during the entire evolution process

when it used the input-output ports on mass 1 of component 
1, see Figure 3. When component 1 was the key component, 


,
 is ASPR.  
 
 
Figure 3.   Adaptive key component controller on mass 1. 
When the key component controller was located on 
component 2 and used the input-output ports on mass 3, 
stability was not maintained, see Figure 4. The adaptive key 
component controller was not able to restore stability on 
mass 3 because that system was not ASPR, i.e., it had 
nonminimum phase zeros at 0.00515±0.2009i.

VII. CONCLUSION 
We have presented a result (Theorem 1) describing when 
an Evolving System will inherit the almost strict dissipativity 
traits of its subsystem components. An example was given of 
successful inheritance of almost strict dissipativity and failed 
inheritance of almost strict dissipativity. This result allows a 
control system designer to determine a sufficient condition 
for an Evolving System to use an adaptive key component 
controller to restore stability. We also presented a 
convergence result (Theorem 2) for an adaptive key 
component controller to restore stability during evolution 
and mitigate persistent disturbances.
