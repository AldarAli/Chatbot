I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Typically, a coupon is a certificate that allows a 
consumer some sort of incentive to buy a product or service. 
Although the incentive is usually a reduction in price, 
coupons can also be used for reimbursements, combined 
offers, free samples, or other types of promotions (e.g., 
sweepstakes or contests) [1]. The economic and financial 
crisis has reinforced the concerns of consumers in relation to 
issues of savings, causing a change in their behavior, 
particularly in relation to the savings obtained via coupons. 
The market share of digital coupons is increasing. Given the 
pace of change in mobile communications, they present 
enormous opportunities for companies with strategic vision 
that can use them to attract and retain customers [2]. Online 
social coupons that offer daily deals are gaining relevance. 
On the one hand, due to the emergence of new distribution 
channels, such as email and mobile applications, but also 
because they are reaching new markets and products (e.g., 
luxury goods, medical and dental care, etc.). Revenue from 
discount sites like Groupon and Living Social reached the 
2.67 billion US dollars in 2011, representing an increase of 
138% over the previous year [3]. According to NCH, 
manufacturers of packaged products distributed over 311 
billion dollars in coupons in 2009, and enabled consumers to 
obtain total savings of 3.5 billion [4]. 
The development of information technology and 
telecommunications generated a growing interest in mobile 
marketing. In the late nineties, market analysts projected a 
great future for marketing initiatives that used mobile 
devices [5]. Mobile coupons can be sensitive to time and/or 
location. Firms may use time sensitive coupons when sales 
are low due to the time of day or due to business seasonality. 
Often, companies have a deep knowledge of their customers, 
allowing them to create profiles of their tastes and needs, and 
use coupons to meet their specific needs [6]. 
For consumers, social coupons proved to be an excellent 
tool to support purchases. Besides offering great discounts, 
they allow consumers to have a first experience with various 
products at a lower price. Offering services that allow the use 
of online and/or mobile coupons has proved to be a 
92

profitable business model. However, the same is not 
necessarily true for those that offer the coupons themselves. 
In effect, big discounts, higher redemption rates when 
compared to traditional coupons, and payments to service 
providers makes it extremely difficult to achieve profitability 
in the short term.  Even in long-term profitability is uncertain 
[7]. Given these concerns, companies hesitate to develop 
large-scale initiatives and are cautious about the potential of 
the coupons. Despite these fears, some prospect a promising 
future for these strategies, since both coupons technology 
and the propensity of consumers to use it are evolving [8]. 
The remaining of this article is organized as follows: in 
Section 2, existent standards are introduced; in Section 3, 
current platforms and solutions are resumed; in Section 4, 
patents are presented; and in Section 5, future trends are 
addressed.  
II. 
STANDARDS 
One of the reasons why paper based coupons persist to be 
the predominant solution for processing promotional offers is 
the fact that there are well-defined and accepted 
methodologies for their generation. Their processing can 
easily be integrated in both suppliers and retailers systems. 
When digital coupons are at stake, in particular when its 
distribution is made through mobile devices, no similar and 
standardized methods exist. 
Interoperability issues between different technologies for 
processing digital coupons contribute to the lower 
redemption rates of this type of coupons when compared to 
the traditional ones in paper format. Most studies indicate 
that digital coupons redemptions account for only 2% of total 
redemption [9]. Points-Of-Sales (POS) are the main 
bottleneck, because of the heterogeneity of systems and 
versions and because most of them are unprepared to read 
bar codes from mobile devices. To overcome these obstacles, 
it is necessary to have standards that enable compatibility of 
various systems in the different stages digital coupons 
processing: 
from 
generation 
and 
communication 
to 
redemption and   ransom and financial reconciliation. 
The Mobile Marketing Association (MMA), the premier 
global non-profit association representing the various actors 
of the mobile marketing arena, seeks to define and establish 
standard languages and platforms for processing various 
types of promotional offers such as coupons, incentives, 
rewards, etc. It created the Mobile Coupon Ad Unit 
(MOCAUS) committee with this purpose. As the result of 
this effort, in [9] it is presented and described a processing 
platform that standardizes the various stages of the process 
(Figure 1). In [10], it is provided a set of diverse documents 
such as studies, reports, and guides to best practice in mobile 
marketing.

(adapted from [9]) 
Relating the standardization of business processes 
associated with the use and treatment of coupons, GS1 [11] 
is the main worldwide organization seeking to define and 
establish open standards for coding and managing the flow 
of goods, services and data through the value chain [12]. The 
set of open standards of the GS1 are recognized by the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and 
allow the correct identification (national and international) of 
items (products and services), logistic units, and commercial 
actors across the value chain and activity sectors. The 
identifiers of the European Article Numbering-Uniform 
Code Council (EAN•UCC) can be represented by barcodes  
and consist of three elements: Global Trade Item Number 
(GTIN) -; Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) -; and 
Global Location Number (GLN). Apart from the unique 
identification, these codes enable the exchange of additional 
information such as expiration dates, serial numbers, lot 
numbers, etc. [13]. 
More specifically, with regard to the processing of digital 
coupons itself, the normative document [14] from GS1 
establishes a set of specifications that define the first version 
of the ‘Digital Coupon Management standard.’ In [15], it is 
presented a first proposal for standardizing the digital 
coupons management process (Figure 2). This proposal 
specifies standards for the management process, the 
identification of objects and the data model.

(adapted from [15]) 
Relating the standardization of data communication, GS1 
Global Data Synchronization Network (GDSN) [16] defines 
a set of standards that specify the connection of the different 
93

actors in the value chain with the GS1 Global Registry 
through a network of certified data repositories (GDSN-
certified data pools) (Figure 3). In this network, all items are 
identified by a unique combination of GTIN and GLN 
identification codes. 
 
Figure 3.  GS1 Global Data Synchronisation Network 
(adapted from [16]) 
Inefficiency and fraud rate related to coupon processing 
in paper format results mostly from the fact that many 
retailers fail to make a correct validation of coupons offers at 
the POS. Therefore, the most logical way to solve the 
problem is to block the redemption of invalid coupons when 
presented at the POS by consumers. This can be achieved 
through the combination of three factors [17]: the new GS1 
Databar barcode; retailers' systems compatible with GS1 
standards; and ultimately, a real-time validation service 
interconnecting POS systems and the data pool server(s) 
containing date information on coupons offers. 
Despite GS1 being better known because of the barcodes 
used by companies to identify their products, their standards 
encompass other aspects than coding. In effect, the GS1 
system of standards enables organizations to identify, extract 
and share information in the supply chain [18]. More 
information on the architecture of the GS1 standards system 
can be found in [19]. 
III. 
CURRENT PLATFORMS AND SOLUTIONS 
The new digital communication channels are an excellent 
opportunity for the various stakeholders involved in the cycle 
of buying and selling products: suppliers, retailers and 
consumers. In particular, the use of coupons in digital form 
as well as its processing by electronic means offers the 
opportunity for suppliers and retailers to eliminate most of 
the problems associated with the traditional coupon 
processing cycle in paper. There are several companies that 
provide solutions for the different stages of digital coupons 
processing: issuance, distribution, validation, reconciliation 
and payment. However, these solutions often involve 
proprietary and local implementations based on non-standard 
protocols. They can be classified in two major types: global 
solutions; and partial solutions. 
A. Global Solutions 
In general, this type of platform relies in a base 
architecture that allows processing solutions for both digital 
and non-digital coupons, with a very similar flow of 
information. From the consumer’s viewpoint, the available 
systems can be used to combine discounts from the supplier 
with the local retailers. To use the service consumers register 
on the platform and add their coupons to their account. The 
coupons can be added from a mobile device or from a site 
(site of the platform itself, retailers sites, coupon distributors 
sites, etc.), with a pre-defined limit. Customers must have a 
mobile number or one or more loyalty cards associated with 
your account. The mobile device number or any of the cards 
associated with the account can then be used to redeem the 
coupons for the purchase of products at the POS. For some 
platforms consumer may print the coupons on paper to 
present them in the POS. The management of loyalty cards 
and mobile phone numbers is performed by the customer 
himself. He may add, change or remove any of the items 
associated with its account. Coupons are automatically 
removed from the consumer list when they are used at the 
POS. Besides automatic removing, some platforms allow 
consumers to remove coupons themselves from their 
account. This option allows consumers to replace a coupon 
when they find a more advantageous discount voucher for a 
specific product, for example. 
From the suppliers and retailers viewpoint, they offer 
coupons on the platform, which automatically updates the 
information in their website(s), twitter profiles, social 
networks and main search engines, thus informing 
consumers 
(through 
custom 
promotional 
marketing 
campaigns and taking into account the profile of the specific 
consumers). Concerning customized marketing, platforms 
provide some applications for mobile devices, which using 
geotagging technology enable consumers to receive alerts on 
the existence of offers of coupons when they are physically 
close to their favorite retail stores. In this case, both the 
activation of the alert service and its configuration 
(conditions and preferences) are made by consumers 
themselves. Whether distributed by the Web, email, 
newsletters, videos, social sharing, mobile devices, or in the 
retailer’s stores (for example, by capturing 2D codes), all 
digital coupons offers are processed electronically at the time 
of submission by the consumer at the POS. 
B. Partial Solutions 
In addition to the global solutions that deal with the entire 
cycle of coupons processing, many other solutions seek to 
meet the needs of retailers in terms of promotional 
campaigns, 
including 
discount 
vouchers 
(coupons) 
associated to specific products and other types of promotions 
that entitle discounts on services, restaurants, bars, clothing 
and convenience stores, etc. Promotions are offered in a 
similar way to the global solutions platforms. For consumers 
who have mobile devices there are applications that allow 
downloading of digital promotions. For other consumers, 
promotions are sent via services like Short Message Service 
(SMS), Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), etc. To 
benefit, consumers only have to show the coupon at the place 
94

eKNOW 2015 : The Seventh International Conference on Information, Process, and Knowledge Management

of purchase of the product or service. Promotions are made 
available to consumers according to their consumption 
habits. Nevertheless, they always have control over the 
information they want to receive. Some of the systems 
available on the market also provide geolocation features that 
allow showing the consumer where he can benefit from 
promotions and witch places near its location provide those 
promotions. 
Relating coupons processing in Portugal, PacSis 
(Systems Promotion and Marketing) [20] provides the 
service of managing discount vouchers. One of its newest 
marketing solutions is offering online coupons in partnership 
with Coupons.com Incorporated [21], also including mobile 
marketing and profiling targeting for brands. However, the 
solution does not currently include the integrated electronic 
processing of the different phases of digital coupons 
deployment. Digital coupons must be printed for later 
redemption at retailers. 
The ability of real-time analysis of data on purchases and 
redemption of coupons is one of the increasingly important 
features for those responsible for the definition of 
promotional campaigns. Several companies seek to explore 
and develop platforms to provide this kind of analysis based 
on the buying cycle, allowing the recommendation of 
products and the customization of coupon offers to 
consumers. 
In [22], it is presented a platform for implementing 
discount coupons which seeks to maximize both customer 
satisfaction and business profitability. The platform is based 
on three components: demand and recommendation of 
coupons; distribution of digital coupons; and multimodal 
redeem of coupons (1D barcode, 2D matrix codes, 
alphanumeric codes, and other visually represented codes). 
 
C. Research Work 
With respect to research-oriented view on the topic, the 
incorporation of Near 
Field 
Communication (NFC) 
technology in processing systems of digital coupons is 
currently a hot research topic. In [23] and [24], two different 
works present the WingBonus system, a solution used for 
dissemination, distribution, validation and management of 
vouchers, loyalty cards, and all kinds of coupons using NFC 
technology. The issues of security and usability are discussed 
in [25], where the authors suggest a vouchers management 
system that integrates NFC technology. A practical offline 
payment system based on digital vouchers using NFC in 
mobile phones is presented in [26], a project that assesses the 
feasibility of such a system, from a technical and security 
perspective, using tangible NFC devices.  
Another important filed of research is related to security 
concerns where some interesting works are being developed 
([26] is a good example]). In [27], the authors propose a 
chaotic maps-based authentication scheme for e-coupon 
systems that satisfies security and functionality requirements 
while preserving efficiency. A system of virtual coupons that 
is protected against illicit use is made in [28], where the 
authors provide a shortlist of possible attacks and describe 
the protocol to prevent them and the requirements for all 
major components. In [29], the authors propose a new 
efficient and secure micro-payment scheme, named e-
coupons, which can provide the users the facility for 
delegating their spending capability to other users or their 
own devices.  
Another important line of research is related to the 
utilization of mobile devices. In [30], a study is made on 
omnichannel commerce and on how mobile affects in-store 
traffic and sales, and in [31], a report makes an analysis on 
how coupons offers are reacting and adapting to mobile. A 
solution, called Mobeam, to overcome the problem of the 
inability of most barcode readers at retailers to reliably read a 
barcode displayed on phones, and through that to promote 
further utilization of mobile phone as a mean of coupon 
utilization [32]. 
With the increasing development of geolocation 
technologies, this field is becoming a central topic in digital 
coupons research. In [33], the authors made a study on 
location-based advertising on mobile devices and social 
networking that use local-tracking technology to target 
clients. A study on the e-coupons strategy problems in 
Location Based Advertising (LBA) using a full information 
model in a reduced optimization problem is made in [34]. 
IV. 
PATENTS 
Various forms and solutions for processing digital 
coupons are available in the market. Many of them are 
proprietary solutions that do not comply to standards. 
Amongst them, several successful applications explore new 
technologies and tools available in the area of wireless 
communications. Moreover, the new standard for digital 
coupon - GS1 DataBar - fostered the development of 
solutions 
capable 
of 
overcoming 
issues 
related 
to 
interoperability between systems [17]. 
Over the past four years, with the advances in terms of 
mobile communications, many companies proposed and 
patented systems for the electronic treatment of different 
stages of digital coupons processing. In [35], Coupons.com 
Incorporated describes a set of techniques and mechanisms 
for generation, distribution, redemption, reconciliation and 
payment of coupons. In the proposed architecture, a 
distribution of coupons entity, allows that, through a server, a 
set of previously registered entities can generate promotional 
coupons offers. Through a network, the distributor server 
receives from retailers the information regarding retail 
coupons presented for redemption by consumers. In 
response, the server of the distributor determines their 
validity, checking not only the terms of the offer, but also if 
they have been previously redeemed in other retailer, thus 
eliminating possible frauds and errors. If coupons are valid, 
the server labels them as redeemed causing the retailer to be 
credited for the amount of the respective discount. This 
solution includes the possibility of having a server at the 
retailer, enabling that the generation of coupons for a 
particular offer available in the distributor's server be made 
during the checkout process at the retailer. The solution also 
enables consumers to add coupons to their account in the 
distributor's server or to print them in paper. Upon checkout, 
consumers can thus redeem coupons in various forms: in 
95

paper; on a mobile device; or by indicating the identifier of 
their account in the distributor platform 
In [36], a solution similar to the above is presented. 
However, it does not include the possibility of generation 
coupons at the retailer side nor printing coupon in paper. The 
solution includes a component for managing the distribution, 
redemption, reconciliation and payment for retailers, and 
billing and payment to suppliers. 
In systems in which the consumer must provide his 
mobile device so coupon codes can be read, several 
problems arise. Namely, the processing time required at the 
POS checkout. The method described in [37] allows that the 
distribution, redemption and reconciliation be made by 
transmitting data of the digital coupon directly to consumer’s 
mobile devices via wireless communication. Similarly, it is 
detected directly from the consumer device the existence of 
coupons selected for redemption, the data being also 
received via wireless communication. 
Another area of development is the distribution of 
coupons and other offerings through consumer devices in 
direct connection with products and services. In [38], it is 
presented a system and respective method for the selective 
distribution of digital coupons based on the consumer 
geographical position relative the location of the retailer's 
store. 
Another example of solution for distributing coupons is 
the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags at 
various locations inside the shops as a means of sharing 
information about products, and download of coupons and 
other incentives, serving also as a way to detect the presence 
of consumers in the shops and facilitate commercial 
transactions in the POS. Labels placed on placards and ads 
near the products, shops entrances or POS can be read by 
consumer’s mobile devices using software for detection, 
reading and subsequent decoding of the information 
provided. Nokia Corporation [39] proposes a solution for 
processing promotional information using RFID tags. The 
proposed platform enables the capture of promotional 
information provided by the retailer, allowing the consumer 
to select coupons via the mobile device for later redemption. 
The platform then makes the validation of redeemed 
coupons, showing in the device information related to its 
validation that is used for confirmation by the retailer. A 
similar solution is described in [40] by Coupons.com 
Incorporated. The consumer has the opportunity to get 
promotional information not only through RFID tags but also 
using Quick Response (QR) codes. 
Still concerning the distribution of coupons, Apple 
Incorporated presents in [41] a specific solution for storage, 
management and redemption of digital coupons through a 
mobile device. Storage can be done either in a server 
accessible from the mobile device as locally on the device 
itself. Consumers enter the identifying code of the coupon or 
read a QR code to store coupons in the mobile device. The 
solution allows the device to alert the consumer of 
redemption possibilities according to the coupons it stores. 
That is, when the consumer is near a store where coupons 
can be redeemed, by using geotagging mechanisms or when 
the expiration date approaches. Additionally, alerts can be 
generated whenever the device verifies that there are nearby 
products of the consumer purchase list for which it holds 
discount coupons. Checkout redemption can be made either 
by introducing the coupon code in the POS or automatically, 
if the mobile device can be used for payments using NFC. 
Finally, regarding the generation of coupons and their 
identifications, most of the solutions that have been proposed 
implement coding schemes that lead to the standards 
proposed by GS1, particularly in regard to the designated 
‘mobile coupons’, that follow the GS1 DataBar standard 
[42]. In [43], it is described a system for generating coupon 
offers and respective barcodes. It enables the user (supplier 
or retailer) to generate coupons by selecting the type of 
barcode. In response to this choice, he is presented with a 
specific interface through which he will provide the data 
needed to generate the coupon. In the range of possible types 
of coupons, the progressive discount coupons, whose value 
increases with the number of consumers that perform a 
certain action, or with approach of the expiration date, 
constitute an increasingly important option in terms of 
marketing campaigns, especially in social networks [44]. In 
[45], it is described a specific methodology for the 
generation of variable-value coupons. In this case, besides 
the expiration date, the coupon includes its own schema 
associated with data associated to its progressive value. 
Thus, this variable schema depends on the time interval 
between the generation date and the date of redemption of 
the coupon. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
According to the statistics for the third quarter of 2012 
presented by NCH, the issuance of food coupons decreased 
3.5% when compared to 2011. However, during the same 
period, the coupons issued in products and services in 
healthcare and beauty increased significantly (10.4%). 
Regarding the type of emissions, the coupons are still mostly 
distributed in newspapers (89.7%). Digital formats represent 
only 2%. Lower than coupons distributed at stores (3.9%) 
and in magazines, mail or packaging (4.6%). 
In the same report, the NCH states that "marketers have 
further suppressed the attractiveness of their coupon offers 
with less savings and less time." In fact, between 2011 and 
2012 there was a decrease in the average discount and the 
expiration period, and an increase in coupons which required 
the purchase of more than one product. The attractiveness 
decrease “has significantly reduced the total number of 
coupons redeemed so far in 2012, halting a three-year 
growth trend." Between 2008 and 2011 the redemption of 
coupons grew 34.7%, but in 2012 the decrease was 
significant (17%). However, it is expected that in the future 
companies (re)start to be more aggressive in the use of 
coupons and in this context digital has a great room for 
growth, due to its current marginal share [46]. 
In a specific study on mobile coupons in 2013 [47], 
several experts predict that by 2016 consumers will redeem 
approximately $ 43,000 million US dollars worldwide, 
compared to 5,400 million in 2011. While most companies 
are still reluctant to adopt this strategy, mobile coupons will 
increasingly be an excellent way to implement advertising

and customer loyalty campaigns without incurring in 
extensive advertising or other brand building methods costs. 
In the same study, the main trends for the industry of 
mobile coupons are addressed: 
 
Location-based coupons - Walgreens can send 
coupons that apply to the store where the customer 
is, attracting him to a specific location. 
 
Barcode replacement by NFC - NFC is an intelligent 
technology far superior to existing methods and their 
application will be increasingly diverse. For 
example, integration with the "check-out" will allow 
customers to quickly pay, redeem coupons, etc. 
 
Dissemination of interest via social networks - It is 
rare to find someone who does not have a profile on 
a social network. By ‘forcing’ the publication of  
coupons in profiles, companies will be able to 
increase the interest in certain stores and products. 
 
Mobile Coupons as catalysts for online shopping - 
Customer interest in a specific product can be 
created by inducing him to search for it via online 
coupons. The placement of a link in the coupon can 
make the experience of purchasing online more 
friendly to the buyer, removing the inconvenience of 
looking for the article in the online store and 
increasing the propensity to buy immediately before 
the offer expires. 
In its annual report, Inmar [48] considers that the decline 
in coupon redemption in 2012 is explained by the divergence 
between consumer preferences and offerings. However, 
consumer interest in coupons is extraordinarily high, 
especially among young men. These groups never sought so 
much for discounts, and the new tools they have at their 
disposal opens excellent prospects for the use of coupons. 
Finally, Small Biz Trends [49] indicates that the main 
trends for the industry of the coupons will include the growth 
of localized offers, increase of online trading, more resources 
and tools for business users, and greater flexibility for 
consumers to personalize their offers.
