Abstract—Advanced wireless sensor network technologies, such 
as the Internet of Things and Machine to Machine, have recently 
been widely applied to various fields. The network protocol of 
future wireless networks, however, requires sensing data from 
the various monitoring values in the large-scale wireless sensor 
network and, hence, may not be effectively built if based on the 
current host-centric scheme. We must therefore redesign based 
on a content-centric concept. From this perspective, we focus on 
an information-centric network-based wireless sensor network 
framework. We propose a novel, efficient caching scheme using 
overhearing phenomena, and boost the proposed caching 
mechanism by using the successive interference cancellation 
technique. Moreover, we propose protocol stacking and signal 
processing based on a cross-layer design. Our numerical result 
reveals that the amount of stored sensing data can be increased, 
the number of multi-hops reduced, and the distance of data 
transfer between the publisher and subscriber nodes improved 
by using the exhaustive computer simulation.

 INTRODUCTION 
New WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks), such as IoT 
(Internet of Things) and M2M (Machine to Machine), play a 
primary role in providing global access by using billions of 
various devices. In general, a WSN system is constructed 
based on vast amounts of resource-constrained sensor nodes, 
e.g., a low-performance processor, low-capacity memory, and 
limited battery. However, we expect that the hardware 
limitations of current WSN devices will lessen in the near 
future. Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to redesign 
not only the radio transmission procedure, but also the 
network architecture and technologies for an advanced WSN 
framework. On the other hand, most users are interested in 
accessing the same contents or information sources, such as 
Google, Facebook, YouTube, Amazon, and Dropbox, despite 
the availability of numerous other web services over the last 
few years. This epidemic trend has led to a new paradigm shift 
in which the network architecture is designed from a content-
oriented aspect. In view of the evolving network framework, 
the ICN (Information-Centric Network) scheme promotes a 
new communication model [2][3]. We note that the current 
WSN’s network protocol is founded upon the host-centric and 
IP-based network architecture, such as the traditional Internet 
infrastructure. In short, the ICN architecture is fundamentally 
different from the host-centric network, i.e., the major concept 
of ICN is an ability to retrieve data independently from the 
current location where the required sensing data are provided. 
ICN design has been investigated not only for wired 
networks, such as the post/next Internet architecture, but also 
for wireless and mobile networks. For example, in a cellular 
telecommunications system, popular content is copied onto 
several intermediate servers called middle-box gateways or 
routers [4][5]. As a result, frequent requests for the same 
content data can be effectively provided without requiring the 
content providers to transfer the redundant data, thus reducing 
the number of data transmissions. The concept of an 
improvement mechanism for the ICN scheme resembles the 
CDN (Content Delivery Network) technique. In the CDN 
scheme, mirrored content data are stored and provided by 
using the in-network content servers of service providers; 
whereas, in the ICN scheme, the copied content data are 
cached and distributed by using the cache memory of the 
individual network node. 
As another related topic, for content flow, Higuchi and 
Hirotsu [6] proposed a novel verification-based flow space 
management based on the OpenFlow method that is a form of 
SDN (Software Defined Networking) technology. On the 
other hand, Zhang et al. and Amadeo et al. [7][8] investigated 
and surveyed emerging and hot trends in ICN-based and 
IoT/M2M-oriented WSNs, e.g., naming formulation, name 
resolution 
technique, 
data 
routing 
formula, 
caching 
mechanism, mobility support, and security protection. In 
addition, Wang et al. [9] examined two promising 
technologies: the wireless network virtualization and ICN 
scheme for the D2D (Device to Device)-assisted cellular 
network. Based on the above, in this paper, we place particular 
focus on the caching mechanism in order to share duplicated 
content data effectively. In general, there are two common 
principles for caching methodologies: the on-path caching 
scheme and the off-path caching scheme [10]. In short, in the 
on-path caching scheme, content data are copied along with 
the routing path by name resolution requests, whereas, in the 
off-path caching scheme, the network node located outside the 
routing path actively and positively executes the caching 
transaction. 
In related studies of the caching mechanism, in the 
traditional ICN architecture, the DONA (Data-oriented 
Network Architecture) framework [11] and the NDN (Named

Data Networking) framework [12] support natively based on 
the on-path caching scheme. On the other hand, Sourlas et 
al. [13] proposed four online intra-domain cache management 
algorithms with different levels of automaticity and compared 
them with respect to performance, complexity, execution time, 
and message exchange overhead to achieve both the on-path 
and off-path caching schemes. Wang et al. [14] proposed a 
collaborative in-network caching scheme that users both the 
content-space partitioning method and hash-routing technique 
in order to exploit the built-in caching capability of the ICN 
framework fully. Hajimirsadeghi et al. [15] investigated joint 
caching and pricing strategies based on duplicated content 
popularity with the game theoretic approach. Li et al. [16] 
proposed a modern dynamic caching mechanism for video 
streaming in order to guarantee QoS (Quality of Service) in 
terms of average throughput. 
In general, most researchers have utilized an exclusive and 
additive mechanism for replication of the frequently referred 
content data, which is undoubtedly a proper solution in a 
wired network. However, in this paper, we adopt a different 
approach for WSN; we effectively utilize the specific wireless 
feature. In our previous study [1], we proposed a novel scratch 
and blueprint strategy of the efficient caching scheme for the 
ICN-based WSN. We proposed a new off-path caching 
mechanism using overhearing phenomena and the SIC 
(Successive Interference Cancellation) technique [17] in order 
to boost caching capability. We note that, for the overhearing 
phenomena, when a sensor node wirelessly transmits any 
content data, its neighbor sensor nodes located in the 
transmitter sensor node’s coverage area can watch the 
forwarding content data due to free-space radio propagations, 
regardless of whether it is necessary. In other words, by using 
the overhearing phenomena, the proposed scheme can achieve 
an off-path caching scheme without using alternative 
exclusive control packets and without introducing additional 
and sophisticated wireless communication systems. 
As another key element technology of the proposed 
scheme, the SIC technique has been extensively studied as a 
familiar interference reduction mechanism at the physical 
layer [18]. SIC application technologies have already 
appeared as industry solutions for cellular and mobile 
communication systems, such as Qualcomm’s CSM6850 
chipset [19]. With the SIC method, the SIC-based receiver 
decodes the strongest signal in the parallel received signals 
from several various transmitters. If the strongest signal is 
successfully recovered, the correct decoded signal is encoded 
again and the re-encoded signal is subtracted from the 
received signal. As a result, the decoding performance of the 
remaining signal can be improved by removing the strongest 
interference; however, its performance and behavior in the 
ICN-based WSN remain unknown. Hence, our study can 
provide significant preliminary evaluations. 
Furthermore, for introducing the SIC technique into the 
ICN-based WSN system, it is important to consider the 
protocol layers holistically and integratively, and the protocol 
stack must be optimized. To the best of our knowledge, this 
optimization problem can be solved in a cross-layer design 
manner [20][21]. Cross-layer design is a new paradigm in 
network architecture that involves the interaction and sharing 
of significant information among layers. If we optimize the 
protocol stack by using the cross-layer design concept, several 
layers 
with 
different 
functionality 
performance 
can 
collaboratively work together. 
Consequently, we summarize the contributions of our 
paper as follows: 
 
• 
We formulate an ICN-based WSN framework for 
adopting the proposed caching mechanism. 
 
• 
We propose a novel caching scheme based on both 
the overhearing phenomena and SIC technique. 
 
• 
We propose a protocol design and procedure of signal 
processing for the proposed caching mechanism 
based on the cross-layer design concept. 
 
• 
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
scheme via exhaustive computer simulation. 
 
The remainder of our paper is organized as follows: 
Section II describes the manner of the proposed scheme; 
Section III provides the computer simulation results; and 
finally, we conclude with our acknowledgments and 
conclusions. 
II. 
PROPOSED SCHEME 
In the ICN-based WSN, the proposed scheme is 
constructed based on the overhearing phenomena and SIC 
technique in order to construct an efficient caching 
mechanism. In this chapter, after presenting our network 
model and the proposed caching mechanism based on the 
above two key technologies, we will provide the protocol 
stack and signal processing procedure for the proposed 
caching mechanism based on the cross-layer design concept. 
A. Network Model of Information-Centric Network Based 
Wireless Sensor Network 
In the network model of the proposed scheme, as shown 
in Figure 1, sensor nodes are distributed on the surface of the 
observation area and these sensor nodes measure the 
environmental monitoring values as the sensing data. Unlike 
the traditional host-centric network model in which the 
sensing data are gathered in a fusion center or cloud server, in 
the proposed scheme, the sensing data are managed in the 
WSN devices and stored among sensor node devices. As a 
common policy of the ICN-based system, when a sensor node 
acquires sensing data that have been already requested from 
other nodes, there is no difference between the original 
sensing data and the duplicated caching data. Therefore, in the 
proposed scheme, as shown in Figure 1, the sensor nodes copy 
and store the sensing data in their cache memories as much as 
possible. 
As the caching transaction trigger, the proposed scheme 
executes when the sensing data are transferred from the 
publisher node (source) to the subscriber node (destination). 
Specifically, when a user wants to acquire the sensing data, 
the user accesses any nearest and acceptable sensor node 
located in the proposed WSN system; that is, the sensor node 

144

works as a gateway node between the proposed WSN system 
and the users. In addition, the gateway node behaves as the 
subscriber node instead of the users; that is, the gateway node 
broadcasts the request message of the sensing data acquisition 
among the proposed WSN member nodes. When the request 
message arrives at the sensor node, the sensor node searches 
for the requested sensing data in its cache memory. If the 
sensor node finds the target sensing data, the sensor node 
holding the desired data replies to the subscriber node with its 
data as the publisher node in the response transaction. 
Therefore, the proposed scheme establishes a routing path 
from the publisher node to the subscriber node to transfer the 
required sensing data, the detailed procedure for which will be 
described later. In addition, a benefit of the proposed scheme 
is that the popular sensing data frequently requested by users 
are cached because of the above procedure. Thus, the 
proposed scheme promotes effective sensing data acquisition. 
As shown in Figure 2, we define and utilize three kinds of 
packets: the sensing data packet, the find packet, and the 
response packet. Especially, as shown in Figure 2 (a), the 
sensing data packet consists of two components—the header 
section and payload section. In the sensing data packet, the 
header part contains extra information, e.g., time, location, 
and sensor node identifier, that operates as searching tags 
when the subscriber requests their desired sensing data, 
whereas the payload part should be defined depending on the 
usage environment of the proposed WSN framework. 
Moreover, the find packet and the response packet have an 
identifier number, source/destination address, and the sensing 
data for the searching transaction, and the response packet also 
has the replied sensing data, as shown in Figures 2 (b) and (c). 
On the other hand, every sensor node has not only the cache 
memory, but also a routing table, as shown in Figure 1. 
Therefore, since the sensor nodes record both the tracking 
identifier and the source and destination node information into 
the routing table when the request messages are flooding in 
and passing through, we can determine the proper routing path 
between the publisher node and the subscriber node. 
As an addressing rule, the sensor node identifier must be 
assigned a unique physical address. In typical ICN-based 
systems, there are two types of naming rules, specifically, the 
hierarchical and flat naming formula. In the hierarchical 
naming rule, an individual sensor node is managed based on a 
hierarchical URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), such as an 
HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)-based website. On the 
other hand, in the flat naming rule, all sensor nodes are 
assigned the same and unique namespace. The hierarchical 
addressing method has the advantage of eliminating the 
overhead of the aggregations among sensor nodes; hence, the 
hierarchical naming rule achieves scalable routing. However, 
if the network structure must be dynamically changed when 
the sensor node is moved, appended, removed, and renewed, 
it is hard to adopt hierarchical addressing. As a result, if we 
define the sensor node that must transfer the sensing data as 
forwarding content data along the routing path as the relay 
node, we believe that the relay node can transmit and/or 
receive from/to the next relay node via the mechanism 
described above. 
B. Effective Caching Scheme with Overhearing Phenomena 
In this section, after describing the aim of the caching 
mechanism and the on-path caching scheme in the proposed 
scheme, we present the proposed off-path caching scheme 
based on the overhearing phenomena. Since there is no 
difference between the original data and the duplicated data 
from the subscriber node viewpoint, as mentioned above, if 
lots of sensor nodes have the required data, the hit probability 
of meeting the target data is improved. As a result, we can 
eliminate the number of wireless communications; thus, we 
expect that the proposed caching scheme will reduce energy 
consumption and radio frequency resources. 
Figure 3 
shows 
the 
proposed 
caching 
methods, 
specifically, the on-path caching scheme and the off-path 
caching scheme, and the relationship of the overhearing 
phenomena. For the on-path caching scheme, as with 
traditional schemes, the proposed scheme is copied and stored 
along the routing path; i.e., when the response packet is 
generated and forwarded, the relay node completes the on-
path caching transaction. In greater detail, when the relay node 
receives the response packet, the relay node extracts the 
sensing data from the received response packet and stores it 
into the cache memory. After execution of the on-path caching 
transaction, the relay node sends the response packet to the

neighbor sensor nodes, and the relay node updates the 
destination address from the current address to the next sensor 
node’s address based on its routing table depending on the 
tracking identifier. For the off-path caching scheme, we 
introduce the overhearing phenomena into the proposed 
scheme without the extra overhead cost of a sophisticated 
hardware module. Unlike the wired network system, in the 
wireless network system, the neighbor sensor nodes located 
within the relay node’s radio coverage area receive and 
acquire the sensing data, which is called the overhearing 
phenomena, as shown in Figure 3. When the relay node 
transfers the sensing data, the proposed scheme proactively 
watches and gathers the cross-talked and surrounded sensing 
data as the overhearing sensing data. The detailed procedure 
of the signal processing will be described later on. 
In the proposed scheme, the neighbor sensor nodes of the 
relay node need not communicate with the relay node because 
of the overhearing phenomena. However, there are two major 
and 
considerable 
drawbacks 
when 
the 
overhearing 
mechanism works effectively, specifically, an increase in 
energy consumption of the signal processing for the wireless 
receiving (overhearing) transaction and additional cache 
memory capacity for the overhearing sensing data. Formerly, 
even if the computational energy consumption, e.g., micro-
controller processing, memory access, and circuit power loss, 
is increasing, it is significantly (extremely) smaller than that 
of the radio transmission. Therefore, the proposed scheme 
reduces the total energy consumption depending on the 
decrease the number of wireless communications. On the 
other hand, for the latter issue, we (and everyone) will expect 
and experienience a decline in the RAM (Random Access 
Memory) hardware price under the influence of mass 
production, broad usage, and price competition, whereas, a 
shortage in the limited, common, and valuable radio resource 
will continue infinitely. 
Consequently, the proposed scheme has significant and 
sufficient benefits, such as reduced energy consumption and 
the effective utilization of radio resources, even with the 
above two costs. 
C. Effective Caching Scheme with Successive Interference 
Cancellation 
As mentioned above, the sensor node receives from its 
neighbor nodes, which is a double-edged sword. In other 
words, this circumstance is positively applicable as the 
overhearing phenomena; however, it causes significant 
interferences, that is, the probability of successful reception is 
negatively degraded. Therefore, in the proposed scheme, we 
will not only execute the off-path caching scheme but also 
reduce the interference by using the cached sensing data based 
on the overhearing phenomena. Specifically, we utilize the 
SIC technique in order to eliminate interference. The beauty 
of the SIC technique resides in its simplicity; it is a purely 
received-based interference management scheme that does 
not require sophisticated coordination among sensor nodes. 
Figures 4 and 5 show the fundamental SIC model. In short, 
the SIC-based receiver decodes in order of high-power among 
several received signals. If the strongest signal can be 
successfully decoded, its decoded signal is encoded again, and 
then this re-encoded signal is subtracted from the received 
signals in order to remove the greatest interference; i.e., the 
SINR (Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio) for the 
remaining signals is improved. Then, the SIC-based receiver 
continues to decode the second strongest signal, and so forth, 
until all signals are decoded or the remaining signals are no 
longer decodable. 
As shown in Figure 4, let 𝑃𝑖,𝑗 denote the signal strength at 
the 𝑗 -th sensor node that is a destination relay node or 
neighbor nodes based on the overhearing processing from the 
𝑖-th sensor node that is a source relay node. In addition, let ℳ𝑗 
denote the set of concurrent transmitting sensor nodes that can 
be heard by the 𝑗-th sensor node. As with the traditional 
wireless reception model, the 𝑗 -th sensor node treats all 
interfering signals from other concurrent and non-intended 
transmissions as a noise signal. When the 𝑖-th sensor node 
transmits the required signal, if its SINR at the 𝑗-th sensor 
node is greater than or equal to a threshold value Λ, the 𝑗-th 
sensor node can be successfully recovered. In other words, let 
𝑃𝑖,𝑗 denote the power level from the 𝑖-th sensor node to the 𝑗-
th sensor node; if the signal from the 𝑖-th sensor node to the 𝑗-
th sensor node can be correctly decoded, 𝑃𝑖,𝑗 is satisfied with

where Λ is the power level of the required received signal 
threshold and 𝜎2  is the power of the ambient noise, 
respectively. In short, (1) indicates that the 𝑗-th sensor node 
can store the replicated data of the 𝑖-th sensor node, if the 
SINR is sufficiently large.  
In Figures 4 and 5, let 𝑦  denote the received signal 
strength of the 𝑗-th sensor node, which is expressed as 
 
𝑦 = ∑ 𝑃𝑚,𝑗

where 𝑀𝑗 is the amount of ℳ𝑗’s elements. 
As shown in Figure 5, in the proposed scheme, the decoder 
works to recover the strongest signal among the input signals 
of 𝑦, such as the received signal in the first transaction. Based 
on (1), if the strongest signal can be successfully decoded, that 
is, its SINR is no less than threshold Λ, the decoded signal is 
subtracted from the aggregate signal. Following this 
procedure, the 𝑗-th sensor node decodes the second strongest 
signal and so forth until all signals are correctly decoded or 
the SINR criterion is no longer satisfied. Therefore, when the 
𝑗-th sensor node decodes the signals based on (1), the received 
signal can be decoded correctly if and only if

signal based on the decoded signal of 𝑦̂𝑘, respectively. 
In (2) and (3), we assume that both 𝑦𝑘 and 𝑃𝑚,𝑗 are in non-
decreasing order as 𝑦1 ≥ 𝑦2 ≥ ⋯ , 𝑦𝐾  and 𝑃1,𝑗 ≥ 𝑃2,𝑗 ≥
 ⋯ ≥ 𝑃𝐾,𝑗, respectively. If we achieve the SIC technique as 
shown in Figure 5, we can formulate the detailed protocol 
design, which we will describe in the next section. 
D. Cross-Layer Design for Protocol Stack 
In the proposed scheme, as shown in Figure 6, the ICN-
layer is constructed by summarizing the middle layers, which 
is Srivastava and Motani’s cross-layer design concept of 
‘merging of adjacent layers’ [21]. We note that, as mentioned 
in reference [21], the aim of ‘merging of adjacent layers’ is to 
design two or more adjacent layers together and a new super-
layer to provide the union services of the constituent layers. 
Namely, the ICN layer of the proposed scheme corresponds to 
this super-layer. In addition, this design concept should not 
require any new interface to be created in the protocol stack; 
that is, architecturally speaking, the super-layer should be 
constructed based on the rest of the layers by using interfaces 
that already exist in the original architecture. Therefore, the 
proposed scheme inherits the protocol stack of the host-centric 
network-based framework from the physical (PHY) layer, the 
application (APP) layer, and the IoT/M2M services layer, as 
shown in Figure 6. 
Regarding the ICN layer’s functionality, we examine and 
implement the separated data aspect, such as the C-plane for 
the control signal and the U-plane for the sensing data, 
respectively. As shown in Figure 6, there are lots of key 
technologies for the ICN-layer feature, and their elemental 
techniques, e.g., service policy, configuration, routing, 
security, strategy, naming, and caching, are essential to 
creating the proposed framework. However, we do not take 
into account their considerations without the caching scheme

as this is outside the scope of this manuscript and will be the 
focus our future work. 
E. Cross-Layer Design of Signal Processing Procedure 
Figure 7 shows our proposed sensor node device’s signal 
processing procedure. The routing table and cache memory in 
Figure 7 are the same components as in Figure 1. From a data 
flow viewpoint, the environmental monitoring data are 
observed from the target observation area. The micro-
controller digitizes them as sensing data via the various 
sensors; then, the sensing data are stored in the cache memory. 
Two types of preserving data accumulate data: the self-
sensing data that was previously mentioned and the 
overhearing sensing data that is acquired based on the 
procedure of the previous section. When the sensor node 
transmits the stored data, the micro-controller encourages the 
TX RF module to send the sensing data. On the other hand, 
when the sensor node carefully watches the radio propagation 
space at the RX RF module, the adequately received sensing 
data is stored in the cache memory as much as possible. We 
note that it is necessary to determine which sensing data 
should be stored because the cache memory capacity of the 
sensor node is limited, the consideration of which is outside 
the scope of this manuscript. However, we believe this 
decision rule poses a significant problem; in fact, we feel that 
the frequently requested data should be preferentially stored, 
and the old and worthless data should be removed. 
On the other hand, the micro-controller should not only 
generate the sensing data and manage the database of the 
routing table, but also control the cache memory and the RF 
TX/RX modules. Notably, when the sensor node works as a 
publisher node for response transactions, the micro-controller 
produces the response packet and then the generated packet is 
adaptively transmitted. To achieve this, the proposed scheme 
constructs and optimizes based on Srivastava and Motani’s 
cross-layer design concept of ‘downward information 
flow’ [21]. In short, in the ‘downward information flow,’ the 
setting parameters at the lower layer are adaptively controlled 
depending on the upper layer’s information as a notification 
and hint. 
Figure 8 shows the procedure of the signal processing for 
the transmitter, receiver, and wireless link in the proposed 
scheme. In Figure 8, the TX RF module (see Figure 8 (a)) and 
the RX RF module (see Figure 8 (c)) have the same 
components as in Figure 7. A detailed description of the 
wireless link model (see Figure 8 (b)) is provided in the next 
section. In addition, as shown in Figure 8 (c), the RX RF 
module has an encoder and decoder, which corresponds to the 
SIC-based encoder and decoder in Figure 5. 
As shown in Figure 8 (a), in the TX RF module, the 
transmission packets—the sensing data packet and the control 
signal packet—are streamed from the upper layers and 
buffered in the TX buffer in order to adjust the data 
transmission rate. The CRC inserter appends a sequence based 
on the CRC code to every packet to detect the packet errors. 
Then, the transmission bit-stream is modulated by using the 
modulator based on the BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) 
method. The transmission signal, i.e., the output signal of the 
TX RF module, is wirelessly transmitted via radio propagation 
space. Its model is shown in Figure 8 (b). In the proposed 
scheme, the wireless link emulator is designed based on radio 
attenuation model of Erceg et al. [22] and the Rayleigh fading 
channel model, which are described in the next section. 
As shown in Figure 8 (c), in the RX RF module, the 
demodulator recovers based on the soft-decision decoding 
formula in order to conduct a signal processing based on the 
SIC technique, and the demodulated soft-decision information 
temporarily queues in the RX buffer. The received and

detected signal is sent not only to the decoder, but also to the 
delayed buffer, for which the buffered signal is utilized for the 
interference removal stage in the SIC technique. In the 
decoder, the soft-decision information is judged based on the 
hard-decision metric, i.e., the hard-decision-based detector 
decides the estimated bit-stream. We note that, if we adopt the 
FEC (Forward Error Correction) mechanism, we need to add 
the error control decoder before the hard-decision. After that, 
the CRC checker verifies the estimated bit-stream sequence in 
order to detect bit errors and then the correct decoded bit-
stream sequence is stored in the recovered packet’s buffer. 
The verification result of the CRC checker can be utilized for 
the packet retransmission control signal, such as ACK and 
NACK, if we adopt the ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) 
mechanism. The properly recovered packet is sent to not only 
the upper layers, i.e., the cache memory in the ICN-layer, but 
also the encoder. This is because, for interference reduction 
based on the SIC technique, the re-encoded signal of the 
recovered packet in the encoder is subtracted from the 
buffered signal in the delayed buffer, the detailed mechanism 
and procedure of which are described in Section II-C. 
F. Wireless Link Model 
In the wireless channel, as shown in Figure 8 (b), the 
packet error probability is related to the received signal 
strength, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication), and the 
received signal strength can be calculated based on the 
distance between the sensor nodes. Hence, the goal of this 
section is to expose this relationship. Let 𝑃TX and 𝑃RX denote 
the electrical power, let 𝐺TX and 𝐺RX denote the antenna gain 
of the wireless communication module, and let 𝐿TX and 𝐿RX 
denote the circuit attenuation loss at the transmitter side and 
the receiver side, respectively. The circuit attenuation loss of 
𝐿TX and 𝐿RX is caused not only by the thermal noise due to the 
electric-resistive components, but also the impedance 
mismatching and transmission power losses of high-
frequency signals. In addition, let 𝐿P denote the radio-wave 
attenuation over the wireless channel. In general, the 
relationship among the parameters of 𝑃TX, 𝑃RX, 𝐺TX, 𝐺RX, 𝐿TX, 
𝐿RX, and 𝐿P are calculated based on 
 
𝑃RX = 𝑃TX − 𝐿TX + 𝐺TX − 𝐿P + 𝐺RX − 𝐿RX (dB) 
(4) 
 
where the constant parameters of 𝑃TX, 𝑃RX, 𝐺TX, 𝐺RX, 𝐿TX, 
and 𝐿RX are provided by the wireless module specification. 
For the radio-attenuation parameters, to determine the 
parameter of 𝐿P in (4), we use model of Erceg et al. [22], 
which can be calculated based on 
 
𝐿P = 𝛼 + 10 ⋅ 𝛽 ⋅ log10  (𝑑/𝑑0) 
(5) 
 
and 
 
𝛼 = 20 log10  (4𝜋𝑑0/𝜆) 
(6) 
 
and 
 
𝛽 = 𝑎 − 𝑏ℎ0 + 𝑐/ℎ0 
(7) 
 
where 𝑑 denotes the distance between the sensor nodes, 𝜆 
denotes the radio wavelength, ℎ0 is the antenna height, and 𝑑0, 
𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 denote the constant parameters depending on the 
surrounding environment given by Erceg et al. [22]. 
In our computer simulation, we calculate the packet error 
probability based on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the 
theoretical equation of bit error probability. If we utilize the 
BPSK method for the modulation scheme, we can calculate 
the SNR, 𝛾, based on 
 
𝛾 = 𝑃RX /𝜅𝜏o 
(8) 
 
where 𝜅 (= 4.0 × 10−21 W/Hz) is the Boltzmann’s constant 
parameter and 𝜏o (K) is the absolute temperature of the system 
device, respectively. 
On the other hand, the bit error probability, 𝑝b, under the 
Rayleigh fading channel that is utilized for familiar wireless 
communication system evaluation, can be theoretically 
calculated [23] based on 
 
𝑝b = 1
2 ⋅ ( 1 − √𝛾/(𝛾 + 1)  ) 
(9) 
 
Let ℓ denotes the packet length. We can calculate the packet 
error probability, 𝑝e, using (9) based on 
 
𝑝e = 1 − (1 − 𝑝b)ℓ 
(10) 
 
III. 
COMPUTER SIMULATION 
In this chapter, we evaluate the fundamental performance 
using computer simulation in terms of three benchmarks—the 
amount of stored sensing data, the number of multi-hops, and 
the data transfer distance between the publisher and subscriber 
nodes.

will evaluate the TX/RX RF module, wireless link, and cache 
memory as shown in Figures 7 and 8. Table I shows the 
parameter settings of our computer simulation. In the 
simulation scenario, the sensor nodes are randomly scattered, 
i.e., the position of the sensor node is distributed based 
uniformly. The publisher node and the subscriber node pair is 
randomly selected; that is, their identifier numbers are 
distributed based uniformly, and their identifier numbers are 
different. Let 𝑁SN and 𝑁PS denote the number of sensor nodes 
and the number of publisher and subscriber node pairs, 
respectively, which are provided in Table I. For the routing 
path decision and calculation, we introduce Dijkstra’s 
algorithm [24]. Dijkstra’s algorithm can calculate the optimal 
path while minimizing the physical distance as a metric of 
weight links in order to reduce the computational time 
complexity of our simulation. 
In the channel model, the constant parameters of 𝑃TX, 𝑃RX, 
𝐺TX , 𝐺RX , 𝐿TX , and 𝐿RX  in (4) and the RF wavelength, 𝜆, 
in (6) are determined based on the familiar XBee RF 
module [25]. On the other hand, in the radio attenuation model, 
the constant parameters of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 in (7) are provided by 
Erceg et al. [22] when the observation area is assumed to be a 
suburban area with trees and buildings standing sparsely on 
flat ground. These detailed parameter settings are shown in 
Table I. In addition, we assume that the control signal is 
ideally exchanged and we ignore the shadowing for the 
wireless communications to avoid system complexity. 
B. Simulation Result 
The numerical result reveals how the proposed scheme 
improves the caching capability. The proposed scheme 
reduces the number of multi-hops and the distance of data 
transfer between the publisher node and the subscriber node. 
Figure 9 shows how many sensor nodes hold the 
duplicated sensing data in the proposed sensor network. 
Namely, for the evaluation benchmark, we illustrate the ratio 
between the sensor nodes that are correctly copied and stored 
as cached sensing data, 𝜌, and all sensor nodes, as expressed 
as 
 
𝜌 = 𝑁SN
∗
𝑁SN
 
(11) 
 
where 𝑁SN
∗  denotes the number of sensor nodes that can copy 
and store the overhearing sensing data into the cache memory. 
As shown in Figure 9, from the qualitative viewpoint, 𝜌 
can be improved with increasing 𝑁SN, because of the increase 
in sensor nodes that can store with the overhearing 
transactions due to increasing dense deployment. In the 
proposed and comparable schemes, 𝜌 reaches its maximum 
value at 𝑁SN = 180 and 𝜌 is degraded in the case of 𝑁SN >
180 region. This is because 𝜌 reaches its upper limitations in 
the case of 𝑁SN = 180 and then decreases depending on 𝑁SN 
when 𝑁SN  is sufficiently large. However, in the proposed 
scheme, 𝑁SN
∗  significantly increases in proportion to 𝑁SN , 
which does not increase as dramatically as when 𝑁SN < 180 
region; hence, 𝜌 maintains a constant value when 𝑁SN > 500 
region. On the other hand, from the quantitative viewpoint, the 
proposed scheme can be improved 1.42, 2.61, 8.85, and 17.0 
times over the comparable scheme with any off-path caching 
mechanism in the cases of 𝑁SN = 100, 180, 500, and 1,000. 
Figure 10 shows how many multi-hops the response 
packet transmits from the publisher node to the subscriber 
node, namely, the number of sensor nodes, 𝑁SN, versus the 
average number of multi-hops for wirelessly forwarding the 
response packet among the relay nodes, 𝜇. From a qualitative 
viewpoint, in the proposed scheme, 𝜇  is improved in 
comparison with the comparable scheme. This is because the 
hit probability of the required sensing data increases 
depending on if 𝜌 is large; hence, 𝜇  can be improved. In 
addition, when 𝑁SN < 50 region, the difference of 𝜇 between 
the proposed and comparable schemes is significantly small 
because of the small 𝜌 difference, and 𝜇 reaches its maximum 
value at 𝑁SN = 180 by reaching upper limitation, the same as 
for 𝜌, as shown in Figure 9. On the other hand, the curve of 𝜇 
gradually increases depending on 𝑁SN, since the multi-hop 
transmission promotes by increased sensor nodes. From a

nodes correctly cached and all sensor nodes, 𝜌.

quantitative viewpoint, the proposed scheme can be improved 
by 3.35%, 8.51%, 10.8%, and 10.9% when 𝑁SN = 50, 100, 150, 
and 200, respectively. 
Figure 11 shows how long the response packet takes to 
transfer from the publisher node to the subscriber node; i.e., 
the number of sensor nodes 𝑁SN  versus the average 
transmission distance of the response packet per hop, 𝜂, which 
is calculated based on 
 
𝜂  = 𝜂
𝜇 
(12) 
 
where 𝜂  denotes the transmission distance of the overall 
routing path between the publisher and subscriber nodes. In 
our computer simulation, we utilize Dijkstra’s algorithm to 
obtain the routing path while minimizing 𝜂, as mentioned 
above. Hence, we can calculate 𝜂 based on the distance metric, 
which is the summation of the linked weights when the 
optimal routing path is decided. 
As shown in Figure 11, from a qualitative viewpoint, when 
𝑁SN < 100 region, the 𝜂 of the comparable scheme worsens, 
whereas the proposed scheme prevents an increase of 𝜂. This 
is because the probability of holding the target sensing data in 
the near sensor node becomes large due to the proposed 
caching mechanism, hence, 𝜂 improves. From a quantitative 
viewpoint, the proposed scheme is improved by 6.46%, 10.5%, 
12.3%, and 12.2% when 𝑁SN  = 50, 100, 150, and 200, 
respectively. 
Consequently, since the proposed scheme improves 𝜌, as 
shown in Figure 9, the proposed scheme reduces the number 
of multi-hops and the data transfer distance between the 
publisher and subscriber nodes as shown in Figures 10 and 11, 
respectively. In particular, for the numerical result of 
Figures 10 and 11, the target sensing data is randomly decided. 
However, the requested sensing data must have several biases; 
therefore, we demonstrate our computer simulations in the 
worst condition, such as an upper (or lower) limitation, and 
thus expect that the evaluation metrics of 𝜌, 𝜇, and 𝜂 will be 
significantly more improved in the practical environment. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we addressed an effective caching 
mechanism and its cross-layer-design protocol construction 
for an ICN-based WSN. We proposed a novel caching scheme 
using the overhearing phenomena and the SIC technique. We 
also proposed the protocol-stack and mechanism procedure 
based on the cross-layer design. The numerical result 
demonstrated that the proposed scheme is improved 2.61 
times that of the comparable scheme (without adopting an off-
path caching scheme) when 𝑁SN = 180  for the caching 
capability. In addition, the proposed scheme can maximally 
reduce the number of multi-hops and data transfer distance 
between the publisher and subscriber nodes by 10.9% and 
12.3%, respectively. In our future research, we will 
demonstrate and discuss our work further in a realistic 
environment using a hardware testbed-based experiment.
