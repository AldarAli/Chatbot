Abstract—The paper describes the development of the improved 
simulation model based on a six terminal Hall element 
implemented in the hardware description language Verilog-A. 
The new simulation model considers temperature effects, offset 
voltage, influence of mechanical stress, external magnetic field 
and internal magnetic field generated by the internal microcoil. 
To obtain the best accuracy of the Verilog-A based model, all 
key parameters of the simulation model were determined and 
characterized by measuring the manufactured Hall plate 
bonded into a ceramic package. The verification of the improved 
simulation model was performed in the Cadence Spectre 
simulator. The Hall element simulation model was designed in 
the 0.18µm technology but can be easily adapted to any 
technology to a certain extent by adjusting its parameters 
according to the measurement results. 
Keywords-Hall element; simulation model; Verilog-A.

 INTRODUCTION 
Hall sensors are still widely used in the magnetic sensors 
market, although the emerging magnetoresistive sensors, such 
as Anisotropic Magneto-Resistance (AMR), Giant Magneto-
Resistance (GMR) and Tunnel Magneto-Resistance (TMR) 
are showing impressive performance results. Recently, a 
comprehensive sensor market study has been taken. It 
concludes, that Hall-effect sensors will still lead the future of 
the sensor market exceeding $1.2 billion in 2030, although the 
Hall effect in semiconductor has been extensively studied in 
the past few decades [1]. The Complementary Metal Oxide 
Semiconductor (CMOS) Hall sensors are used to measure 
relative or absolute position, electric current, energy, speed, 
angle, Earth's magnetic field, etc.  The main reasons why 
CMOS Hall effect sensors lead the field of magnetic sensors 
are their linearity over a wide dynamic range, their low 
process costs compared to their competitors due to their 
compatibility with standard CMOS technology and their 
robustness. There are also many disadvantages of the Hall 
element compared to its magnetoresistive competitors, which 
need to be solved by researches. The low sensitivity, high 
power consumption and low signal to noise ratio are just a few 
of them.  The next is the relatively large offset voltage, which 
is a function of geometry and production errors. However, the 
high offset voltage and 1/f noise can be greatly reduced by 
applying the well-known current spinning technique [2], 
which is commonly used in the art of designing a magnetic 
microsystem with the Hall elements.  The second is the 
temperature variation of the sensitivity of the Hall element. 
The variation of sensitivity is non-linear and depends on the 
mechanical stress. One way to overcome the problem is to use 
an integrated microcoil that generates an internal reference 
magnetic field to calibrate the sensitivity of the magnetic 
microsystem [3].  
The magnetic system with an array of N Hall sensors is 
used to measure the spatial distribution of the magnetic field 
or to increase the low sensitivity of the Hall element by the 
factor N, to increase the signal to noise ratio and to minimize 
the offset by a factor √𝑁  [4]. The second is the use of 
ferromagnetic 
structures, 
also 
known 
as 
magnetic 
concentrators, where they are used as planer magnetic 
amplifiers [5]. Basically, the magnetic concentrator converts 
the parallel magnetic field into a magnetic field that is 
orthogonal to the surface of the Hall element. The mentioned 
disadvantage of the solution is an additional step in the 
production of the System on Chip (SoC). 
To reduce the power consumption of the magnetic 
microsystem, the bias current of the Hall element can be 
pulsed during signal processing. In order to simulate and 
design the high performance magnetic microsystem, an 
accurate simulation model of the Hall element must be used. 
Such a simulation model should take into account the offset 
voltage, the external magnetic field, the internal magnetic 
field, the mechanical stress and the temperature variations of 
the sensitivity [6]. Sometimes integrated circuit manufacturers 
do not provide all the necessary technological parameters 
required for a successful implementation of the Hall element 
model in e.g. multiphysics software such as COMSOL. In a 
case, where the technological parameters are treated as 
confidential, the Hall element model can be created using the 
measured results and know-how. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, 
the theory and the measured results of the Hall element 
designed and manufactured in the 0.18µm Bipolar CMOS 
Double Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductor (DMOS) 
(BCD) technology are collected. In Section 3, the 
development and verification of the Verilog-A model are 
presented. Finally we summarize the paper in Section 4. 
II. 
THEORY AND MEASURED RESULTS 
The Hall effect in semiconductor can be briefly described 
as a deflection of charge carriers caused by the Lorentz force 
when the magnetic field is present. If the magnetic field is 
perpendicular to the semiconductor surface and the Hall 
element is connected to the power supply, i.e., the current 
flows through the semiconductor then, the small Hall voltage 
appears at the edges of the Hall plate [7]. The Hall element

can be biased with current or voltage. This means that the 
Hall voltage can be described as a function of the selected 
bias [8]. If the Hall element is voltage biased, the Hall voltage 
is given by (1), 
 
 
𝑉ு =  𝐺 𝑊
𝐿 µு𝑉𝐵௭, 
(1) 
 
where the correction factor G depends on the shape of the 
Hall element, W and L are the width and length of the sensor, 
respectively, µு is the Hall mobility, V is the supply voltage 
and 𝐵௭ is the applied magnetic field orthogonal to the surface 
of the Hall element. Secondly, the Hall element can be biased 
using the current source. In this case, the Hall voltage is 
expressed as (2):  
 
 
𝑉ு =  𝐺 𝑟ு
𝑞𝑛𝑡 𝐼𝐵௭, 
(2) 
 
where 𝑟ு is the Hall factor, q the electron charge, n the 
doping concentration in n-doped silicon, t the thickness of the 
active N-well region and I the bias current flowing through 
the Hall element [8].    
The Verilog-A model is based on the six terminal Hall 
element model presented in [9] and serves as the starting 
point for a new Hall element model. The simplified electrical 
Hall element model and its cross-shaped layout model with 
four contacts U – Up, D – Down, L – Left and R – Right are 
shown in Figure 1. The electrical model consists of four N-
well resistors representing the N-well Hall element 
resistance. The cross-shaped Hall element is widely used due 
to its 90° symmetry, which reduces potential mask 
misalignment errors. It is also useful when current spinning 
technique, i.e., electrical rotation of its terminals, is used to 
minimize the offset voltage. The complete cross-shaped Hall 
element with integrated microcoil is shown in Figure 2. The 
active area width of the Hall element is 13 µm. It is worth 
mentioning that the minimization of the Hall element is 
crucial, e.g. to increase the spatial magnetic field resolution 
and the bandwidth of the magnetic microsystem. One of the 
disadvantages of miniaturization is a larger offset and errors 
e.g. due to etching. In addition, the efficiency of the microcoil 
is increased because it is closer to the active area of the Hall 
element. The number of microcoil turns is another parameter 
that is important when designing the internal reference 
magnetic field. The N-well area, microcoil and metal contacts 
are shown in Figure 2 as well. The complex electrical circuit 
schematic of the six terminal Hall element model is shown in 
Figure 3 [9]. The Hall element has four basic contacts U, D, 
L, R and an auxiliary contact B for the simulation of the 
external magnetic field. In addition, there are two more 
contacts CI, CO each representing the input and output of the 
internal microcoil. The resistance of the Hall element is 
represented by four N-well resistors connected in the resistor 
bridge. Four resistors are added between U and ua, D and da, 
L and la and R and ra as current sensing element. The value 
of each resistor is 1 Ω. This means that the voltage drop 
across the resistors directly represents the bias current of the 
Hall element. At each branch, 8 Voltage Controlled Resistors 
(VCR) and 8 Current Controlled Current Sources (CCCS) 
form a current loop. Four pairs (red current loops) are active 
when the external magnetic field is present and the other four 
pairs (green current loops) are active when the internal 
magnetic field is generated. VCRs only work for positive 
values (positive resistance), so two current loops are added to 
each branch. The value of the four VCRs when the external 
field is applied is determined by the voltage drop across the 
sensing resistors caused by the bias current of the Hall 
element. The others value is 0.  The current in each loop 
depends on the CCCS controlled by the current flow (vm) 
through the resistor connected between contacts B and gnd. 
The mentioned current depends on the voltage signal at 
terminal B, which represents the external magnetic field. 
Similarly, when the internal magnetic field is applied, the 
current in the other four loops depends on the current flowing 
(vs) through the 50 Ω resistor, which represents the resistance 
of the microcoil. The electrical model contains 8 Voltage 
Controlled Voltage Sources (VCVS) representing the offset 
voltage of the Hall element. The controlled voltage depends 
on the voltage drop across the current sensing resistors caused 
by bias current of the Hall element. The four current sensing 
resistors are used to maintain the symmetry of the resistor

bridge. From a functional point of view, only two of them 
could be used. The microphotography of the Hall element 
manufactured in the 0.18 µm BCD technology is shown in 
Figure 4. The Hall element was bonded with 30 µm bond 
wires into a ceramic package. The Hall element was exposed 
to an external magnetic field of 34 mT or 340 G between two 
circular magnetic coils - Helmholtz pair, which generated an 
almost uniform magnetic field. Thermal tests were carried out 
in the temperature chamber from -40 °C to 120 °C. First, the 
offset voltage was measured at different temperatures and in 
different bias modes without applied magnetic field. The 
average measurement results of the offset voltage based on 
N=20 samples are gathered in Table 1. When the Hall 
element is voltage biased, the bias current Ib decreases with 
temperature due to the positive temperature coefficient of the 
N-well. This means that the N-well resistance increases with 
increasing temperature and consequently influences the 
offset voltage Voff. When the Hall element is current biased, 
the changes in offset voltage are greater due to the applied 
constant current. The results show that the Hall element 
suffers from a large offset voltage (mV) therefore current 
spinning technique should be used to reduce it to (µV). The

offset voltage changes locally from die to die or globally from 
wafer to wafer, so it is a random function. In this case, the 
offset voltage could be expressed as a third order polynomial:  
 
 
𝑉௢(𝑥) =  2 · 10ି଼𝑥ଷ − 2 · 10ିହ𝑥ଶ − 0.0042𝑥
− 0.297, 
(3) 
 
where x represents a temperature. The polynomial is found as 
a line that best fits the measured data. Equation (3) is used 
later in Verilog-A description of the Hall element.  
Then, the sensitivity of the Hall element to the external and 
internal magnetic field was measured. The results are shown 
in Table 2. The measurement was performed for both bias 
modes. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the average measurement 
results of the current related sensitivity SI and voltage related 
sensitivity SV respectively for N=20 samples. The 
temperature coefficient of the Hall element sensitivity 
depends on the carrier mobility, the Hall element factor and 
the mechanical stress. To describe the absolute value of the 
current-related sensitivity variation with temperature, the 
relative error ẟௌூ can be added as:  
 
 
ẟௌூ(𝑥) =  8.83 · 10ି଺𝑥ଶ − 1.50 · 10ିଷ𝑥
− 0.0035, 
(4) 
 
where x stands for the temperature. In this case, the relative 
error 0 at 0 °C is selected. Again, equation (4) is found as a 
line that best fits the measured data, so the relative error 
deviates slightly from 0 at 0 °C.   
The sensitivity of the Hall element to the internal magnetic 
field generated by the integrated microcoil is 26 V/AA or 26 
µV at 1 mA of the bias current of the Hall element and 1 mA 
of the current flowing through the microcoil. The integrated 
coil generates a magnetic field of 0.52 mT or 5.2 G at 1mA 
DC current. The resistance of the microcoil also changes with 
temperature, so the temperature coefficient of the microcoil 
should not be neglected. Its measured value is 3· 10ିଷ /°C.  
With the measurement results obtained, the Verilog-A 
based Hall element model can be developed. 
III. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERILOG–A BASED HALL 
ELEMENT MODEL  
In this Section only a crucial part of the Verilog-A code 
will be analysed as, the rest is a top level description of the 
Hall element shown in Figure 3. The first part of the code is 
shown in Figure 7 and describes the VCR. The value of the 
resistor is represented by the voltage drop between p2 and n2. 
The current through p1 and n1 is proportional to the voltage 
difference between terminals p1 and n1 divided by vctrl. To 
avoid division by zero error or negative resistance, the vctrl 
is limited to 1· 10ିହ. This is achieved by using a conditional 
statement.  
The second part of the code is shown in Figure 8 and 
represents CCCS. The I(out) depends on the voltage drop

V(in) across the current sensing resistor, which represents the 
current that controls CCCS. The value of the current depends 
on the ports used (branch (pi, ni) in). First, when the input 
port B is selected, the current depends on the input voltage 
applied to port B, which represents external magnetic field. 
Second, when input terminal CI is selected the current 
depends on the input voltage applied to terminal CI, which 
represents internal magnetic field. The variable pt represents 
temperature. The absolute value of sensitivity to the external 
or internal magnetic field can be adjusted by the gain 
parameter. The polynomial ksen with the corresponding 
coefficients ksen3, ksen2, ksen1 and nsen representing the 
relative error ẟௌூ is used when the parameter sen is equal to 
1. If sen is 0 then, the relative error or ksen is zero.  
The third part of the code is shown in Figure 9 and 
describes the VCVS, which adds the offset in the model of 
the Hall element. The controlled voltage vctrl=V(p2,n2)/2 
depends on the voltage drop across the current sensing 
resistor, which represents the bias current of the Hall element. 
The polynomial koff with the corresponding coefficients 
koff3, koff2, koff1 and noff is added to simulate the offset 
voltage. The offset voltage can be switched on or off by 
setting the off parameter to one or zero.  
Figure 10 shows the Hall element and its parameters which 
can be set according to the measurement results. The absolute 
value of the sensitivity can be adjusted by changing the 
parameters emf (external magnetic field) and imf (internal 
magnetic field). The resistance of the N-well resistor can be 
changed by the parameters nw (width) and nl (length). The 
temperature coefficient of the microcoil can be adjusted by 
changing the parameter tc_coil.  
The next step in the development is the verification of the 
Hall element written in Verilog-A. Figure 11 and Figure 12

show the comparison between measurement and simulation 
results.  The proposed model shows a good agreement with 
the measurement results of N=20 Hall element samples 
bonded into the ceramic packages. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
A development of the Hall element model written in 
Verilog-A was presented.  Some solutions for characterizing 
the Hall element in case, the technological data are not fully 
available are described in the paper. The proposed Hall 
element model takes into account the internal magnetic field, 
the external magnetic field, and offset voltage, the temperature 
dependence of the sensitivity of the Hall element and its offset 
voltage, and the packaging stress. The simulation results show 
a good agreement with the measurement results.
