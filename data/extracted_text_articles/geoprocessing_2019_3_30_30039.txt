Abstract—The results presented in this paper are based on the
research conducted during the last years. Many multi-disciplinary
and practical geo-spatial data and application solutions require
to exploit holistically complex scenarios. In many cases, data and
algorithms as well as workﬂows have to be created and tackled
individually. The goal of this research is to create an innovative,
comprehensive tool base of conceptual knowledge in geo-spatial
application scenarios for arbitrary knowledge context in any
media. The solution should be complementary to the commonly
available geo-spatial features and should fulﬁll a range of further
criteria, especially for a coherent system of knowledge, multi-
disciplinary, and data-centric. The result should allow to create
and refer to facetted knowledge focussed on geo-spatial scenarios.
The paper presents the results of an implementation based on
the fundamental methodology of superordinate knowledge. The
solution is targeting geo-spatial application scenarios and has
been used for many practical implementations over more than
three decades. The resulting comprehensive subset of conceptual
knowledge reference divisions, which was created from this long-
term research, is available and ﬁrst published with this paper.

INTRODUCTION
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that geo-spatial
disciplines are specialised and very much concentrating on
providing solutions and tools for spatial data.
When it gets to more complex situations, then, spatial data
based on numerical coordinate reference systems and domain
only approaches may not be sufﬁcient. This is, for example, the
case when describing the target knowledge with mathematical
spacial facets and dimensions is not sufﬁcient. Many informa-
tion and context maybe lost when knowledge is handled as
plain data and mapped to preexisting attributes and categories.
This is the case when a more holistic and more fundamental ap-
proach should be considered. In practice, associating different
objectives and intentions, systematic knowledge, and physical
features with knowledge, from methodology to implementation
and realisation, can provide valuable solutions. The principles
of superordinate knowledge provide such fundaments, from
methodology to realisation.
The resulting solution should be complementary to the
commonly available geo-spatial topologies, taxonomies, and
features. In consequence, the means of describing spatial data,
objects, entities, and context should be substantially extended.
The resulting solution should fulﬁll a range of criteria in
order to provide a most sustainable, ﬂexible fundament, e.g.:
•
Covering a coherent system of knowledge.
•
Consistent implementation, quasi-standardised.
•
Providing facetted conceptual knowledge features.
•
Multi-disciplinary knowledge spectrum.
•
Features for multi-lingual implementation.
•
Data-centric implementation / method.
•
Extensible concept.
Therefore, these criteria should allow advanced features, e.g.,
documentation of data, objects, scenarios, concepts, algo-
rithms, as well as universal context of knowledge criteria for all
kind of knowledge in any media, knowledge documentation,
knowledge consistent integration of publications and research
data, knowledge mining, wide range of ﬂexible implementation
potential, supporting workﬂow features and documentation.
With this research, a comprehensive subset of conceptual
knowledge reference divisions was created, further developed,
and ﬁnally compiled from the practical application case stud-
ies, which have been conducted over the last decades.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II
introduces the state of the art and motivation. Section III
discusses previous work, components, and used resources.
Section IV presents the required implementation features and
sample scenarios. Section V presents the resulting conceptual
knowledge solution. Section VI presents evaluation references
to directly related implementations, research, development, and
cases studies. Section VII summarises the lessons learned,
conclusions, and future work.

STATE OF THE ART AND MOTIVATION
Geo-spatial practice is focussed on providing cartographic
means for certain space and environment. Widely employed
tools are Geoscientiﬁc Information Systems and Geographic
Information Systems. Most of these tools use geo-referenced
data in order to organise and reference information. Available
topologies can also provide for the categorisation of geo-
spatial entities. All together these means are very limited
when seen in a larger context as required for many complex
application scenarios. Regarding that, one of the major deﬁcits
is the lack of a consistent and holistic knowledge concept.
The fundaments of terminology and understanding knowledge
are layed out by Aristotle [1], being an essential part of
‘Ethics’ [2]. Information sciences can very much beneﬁt from

Aristotle’s fundaments and a knowledge-centric approach [3]
but for building holistic and sustainable solutions, supporting
a modern deﬁnition of knowledge [4], they need to go beyond
the available technology-based approaches and hypothesis [5]
as analysed in Platon’s Phaidon.
In sciences, observation is one of the most important funda-
mental tasks [6]. But, as John Burroughs expressed “There
is nothing in which people differ in more than in their
powers of observation. Some are only half alive to what is
going on around them.” [7]. Triggered by the results of a
systems cases study, it is obvious that superordinate systematic
principles [8] are still widely missing in practice and education.
Making a distinction and creating interfaces between methods
and the implementation applications [9], the results of this
research are illustrated here along with the practical example
of the Knowledge Mapping methodology [10] enabling the
creation of new object and entity context environments, e.g.,
implementing methods for knowledge mining context. This
motivating background allows to build methods for knowledge
mapping on a general methodological fundament.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-
opment (OECD) has published principles and guidelines for
access to research data from public funding [11]. The princi-
ples and guidelines are meant to apply to research data that
are gathered using public funds for the purposes of producing
publicly accessible knowledge. In this context, the OECD espe-
cially addresses knowledge, re-use, and knowledge generated
from re-use. The means to achieve such recommendations even
for complex scenarios is to use the principles of Superordinate
Knowledge, which integrate arbitrary knowledge over theory
and practice. Core assembly elements of Superordinate Knowl-
edge [8] are methodology, implementation, and realisation.
Separation and integration of assemblies have proven beneﬁcial
for building solutions with different disciplines, different levels
of expertise. Comprehensive focussed subsets of conceptual
knowledge can also provide excellent modular and standard-
ised complements for information systems component imple-
mentations, e.g., for environmental information management
and computation [12]. The conceptual knowledge reference
divisions presented here are the result from more than three
decades of scientiﬁc research in information science and multi-
disciplinary knowledge.
III.
PREVIOUS WORK, COMPONENTS, AND RESOURCES
For the implementation of case studies, the modules are built
by support of a number of major components and resources,
which can be used for a wide range of applications, e.g.,
creation of resources and extraction of entities. The facility
for consistently describing knowledge is a valuable quality,
especially conceptual knowledge, e.g., using the Universal
Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC) [13].
The UDC is the world’s foremost document indexing lan-
guage in the form of a multi-lingual classiﬁcation scheme
covering all ﬁelds of knowledge and constitutes a sophisticated
indexing and retrieval tool. The UDC is designed for subject
description and indexing of content of information resources
irrespective of the carrier, form, format, and language. UDC
is an analytico-synthetic and facetted classiﬁcation. It uses a
knowledge presentation based on disciplines, with synthetic
features. UDC schedules are organised as a coherent system
of knowledge with associative relationships and references
between concepts and related ﬁelds. Therefore, the UDC
represents a most ﬂexible facetted classiﬁcation system for all
kinds of knowledge in any media. The UDC provides 70,000
subdivisions, in 50 languages, which provides more than 3
million entries and verbal descriptions. The UDC is up to now
internationally used in 130 countries, for 150,000–200,000
document collections worldwide. The classiﬁcation has shown
up being especially important for complex, facetted, multi-
disciplinary, and long-term classiﬁcation, e.g., with Knowledge
Resources. The UDC is the best publicly available implementa-
tion of conceptual knowledge to illustrate the width and depth
of knowledge dimensions. The UDC allows an efﬁcient and ef-
fective processing of knowledge data and provides facilities to
obtain a universal and systematical view on classiﬁed objects.
Operational areas include author-side content classiﬁcations
and museum collections, e.g., with documentation of resources,
library content, bibliographic purposes on publications and
references, for digital and realia objects. The Knowledge Re-
sources objects and entities can refer to any conceptual knowl-
edge, e.g., main UDC-based classes, which for this publication
are taken from the multi-lingual UDC summary [13] released
by the UDC Consortium under a Creative Commons license
[14]. Facets can be created with any auxiliary tables, e.g.,
auxiliaries of place and space, time, language, and form as well
as general characteristics, e.g., properties, materials, relations,
processes, and operations, persons and personal characteristics.
IV.
IMPLEMENTATION AND BASIC EXAMPLES
A. Required conceptual knowledge features
Data and objects result from public, commonly available,
and specialised Knowledge Resources. The Knowledge Re-
sources are containing factual and conceptual knowledge
as well as documentation and instances of procedural and
metacognitive knowledge. These resources contain multi-
disciplinary and multi-lingual data and context. UDC provides
auxiliary signs [15], which represent kinds of standardised
“operations”. UDC allows the creation of facetted knowledge
using these features. The conceptual knowledge in focus
requires to provide references to any universal knowledge
context. References to UDC codes are capable to provide all
the required context. The main tables provide an entry point
to universal knowledge context [16]. For practical use, clas-
siﬁcation references can refer to UDC reference codes based
on science and knowledge organisation [17]. For conceptual
knowledge of place and spatial context the implementation
requires to provide references to classiﬁcation codes. The UDC
provides references based on the common auxiliaries of place
of the UDC [18]. In that context, besides universal knowledge,
additional closely related references are required. UDC can
provide appropriate references, e.g., geodesy, surveying, pho-
togrammetry, remote sensing, cartography (UDC:528) [19] and
geography, exploration, travel (UDC:910) [20], and nonliterary,
nontextual representations of a region (UDC:912) [21].

B. Examples of conceptual knowledge application
Examples of conceptual knowledge reference divisions ac-
cording with UDC (UDC:913, Regional geography, [22];
UDC:94, General history, [23]; UDC:(1/9), Common auxil-
iaries of place, [18]) and UDC conventions are shown in the
following four small sample groups:
UDC:913(3)
⇒ Geography of the ancient world
UDC:913(3/9)
⇒ Geography of the individual regions and
countries of the ancient and modern world
UDC:94(3)
⇒ History of the ancient world
UDC:94(3/9)
⇒ History of individual places of the ancient
and modern world
UDC:94(37)
⇒ History of ancient Rome and Italy
(to 5th century)
UDC:94(38)
⇒ History of ancient Greece
UDC:(37)(24)
⇒ Ancient Rome and Italy, below sea level

⇒ Ancient Greece, below sea level
A little more complex facetted example, a single data
object entity of a ship wreck realia as referred in a container
of extended Knowledge Resources, is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Knowledge Resources, conceptual spatial and geo-references:
Lindos object with ship wreck entity, Rhodes, Greece (excerpt).
Passages not relevant for demonstration and not adequate for
privacy and safety reasons were shortened to ellipses. The
object entity contains documentation, object categories and
factual data, conceptual data references, a source reference
[24], and data for geo-references. The conceptual knowledge
comprises details of non geo-spatial domains, e.g., from main
tables UDC:6 and UDC:9, and from geo-spatial context, e.g.,
auxiliary tables for place and space UDC:(24) UDC:(3/9). For
this case, the object entity references can be resolved as:
UDC:902
⇒ Archaeology
UDC:903
⇒ Prehistory. Prehistoric remains, artefacts,
antiquities
UDC:904
⇒ Cultural remains of historical times
UDC:629.5
⇒ Watercraft engineering. Marine engineering.
Boats. Ships. Boatbuilding and shipbuilding
UDC:(38)
⇒ Ancient Greece
UDC:(4)
⇒ Europe
UDC:(24)
⇒ Below sea level. Underground. Subterranean
The references can hold further details and sub-contain addi-
tional information, e.g., UDC:903 further refers to artefacts in
more detail. For a wider and deeper view, we have to refer
to a number of successful projects, which were conducted
by the author’s group and various collaborators over the last
decades. All these implementations are signiﬁcantly based on
the solution presented here.
V.
RESULTING CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE SOLUTION
Table I contains the compilation of a general comprehensive
subset of resulting major conceptual knowledge reference divi-
sions for geo-spatial application scenarios. All the conceptual
knowledge reference divisions presented are referring to UDC
codes, which have been made publicly available. Here, “UDC:”
is the designated notation of references used with Knowledge
Resources and objects in ongoing projects. The UDC illustrates
the width and depth of knowledge dimensions. The full details
of organisation and knowledge are available from the UDC.
As far a possible, the original verbal descriptions (English
for demonstration) were taken, even if the writing of terms
and words may differ from the practice used for the rest
of this paper. The resulting conceptual knowledge solution
comprises a most comprehensive knowledge compendium
of geo-spatially dominated facetted knowledge, which can
be effectively and efﬁciently used in geo-spatial application
scenarios. Besides the level of detail and arbitrary facetted
knowledge, the respective conceptual knowledge reference di-
visions provide a focussed discipline coverage while spanning
a large width and depth of knowledge reference divisions.
For example, let us take an additional view on depth for
UDC:004 (Computer science and technology. Computing. Data
processing), UDC:51 (Mathematics), and UDC:528 (Geodesy.
Surveying. Photogrammetry. Remote sensing. Cartography).
Besides the shown references, UDC:004 also comprises
important subdivision context of data and structure, e.g., data
handling (UDC:004.62), ﬁles (UDC:004.63), databases and
their structures (UDC:004.65), and systems for numeric data
(UDC:004.67). For practical references, UDC:004 can be used
to also hold references to many application scenarios, e.g.,
algorithms for program construction, low level as well as
high level and problem oriented languages, knowledge repre-
sentation, artiﬁcial intelligence application systems, intelligent
knowledge-based systems. For practical references with math-
ematical, geometrical, and topological context, UDC:51 can
be used to also hold references to fundamental and general
considerations of mathematics, number theory, algebra, geom-
etry, topology, analysis, combinatorial analysis, graph theory,
probability, mathematical statistics, computational mathemat-
ics, numerical analysis, mathematical cybernetics, operational
research as well as mathematical theories and methods. For
practical references with geoscience and spatial disciplines,
UDC:528 can be used to also hold references to a much
deeper discipline based knowledge, e.g., fundamentals derived
from potential theory, level surfaces, geoids, geometric/static
methods, use of longitudinal and latitudinal measurements,
gravity measurement, astro-geodetic determination of position,
geographical coordinates, topographic surveying, engineering
surveys, special ﬁelds of surveying, applications of photogram-
metry, fundamental and physical principles, data processing,
and interpretation.
The result of conceptual knowledge reference divisions
based on the methodology of superordinate knowledge is
complementary to geo-spatial topologies and geo-referencing.
It can be used complementary with any geoscientiﬁc and geo-
spatial knowledge in any context.

The result can provide solutions wherever conceptual knowl-
edge references are involved. The methodologies and imple-
mentations make sure that powerful sets of unique attributes
and features are available. The number of possible use cases
is practically unlimited. The case studies showed that a wide
range of application scenarios can beneﬁt from the principles
of superordinate knowledge and considering conceptual knowl-
edge as complementary means for consistently documenting
and handling knowledge. The passages in the following section
refer to discussions and details for an excerpt of successful
implementations.
VI.
EVALUATION FROM IMPLEMENTATION CASES
Many years of research and practical solution developments
contributed to creating a comprehensive subset of conceptual
knowledge, which is the fundament deployed for general
practical solutions, e.g., with geo-spatial applications and with
geo-data knowledge mining and processing. The conceptual
knowledge framework employed here, especially UDC, has
passed the test of time and is so mature and used in so many
scenarios that the ongoing knowledge development itself is
iterating with its application.
The previously unpublished results of practical conceptual
knowledge are ﬁrst presented here (Table I). The following
case studies are based on these results and present small
but illustrative excerpts (Figure 2) in form of a cross-section
of conducted research and development, of Knowledge Re-
sources, algorithms, intelligent workﬂows, and implementa-
tions. Here, for example, a knowledge mining process em-
ploying knowledge objects based on the referred conceptual
knowledge can use all the width and depth of knowledge
behind the comprehensive subset to automatically or semi-
automatically create new context and visualisation for a data
set containing non-georeferenced text entities (afﬁliations in
ﬂoating text), e.g., geographical, political, and climate zone
context.
Besides the knowledge fundament and framework being
focus of this research paper, the references in the next pas-
sages contain further details for the practical case studies, the
implemented methods and the technologies, which were used
for the different case studies.
•
Knowledge integration allows to create new views and
insights by computing Spatial Cogwheel modules [25].
•
Knowledge mining: Creating Knowledge Resources and
employing classiﬁcation and concordances can provide
a base for advanced knowledge discovery and compu-
tational solutions [26]. The integration of Knowledge
Resources and advanced association processing can be
beneﬁcial in many disciplines as it provides multi-
disciplinary and multi-lingual support [27]. Methods like
the Content Factor can be used for advanced knowledge
processing [28]. The integration of appropriate methods
can be used for further advancing the Knowledge Re-
sources, as well as the mining processes [29].
•
The methodology of knowledge mapping allows to create
ﬂexible methods in order to handle spatial represen-
tations and knowledge mining by creating a multi-
dimensional context for arbitrary objects and entities
[10].

Dynamical visualisation: The methodology can be used
for enabling knowledge based methods for computation

supports phonetic association and mining methods [31].
•
Verbal description: The employment of implemented
methods can be supported and make use of multi-
lingual verbal descriptions and concordances [32] as
the conceptual knowledge is consistently available in
50 languages, providing millions of basic conceptual
knowledge references.
VII.
CONCLUSION
This research achieved to create a comprehensive tool base
of conceptual knowledge in geo-spatial application scenarios
for all kinds of knowledge context in any media. The imple-
mented superordinate knowledge based solution fulﬁlls all the
required criteria as was presented and discussed in this paper.
The result was employed to successfully implement a wide
range of different geo-spatial cases.
With this research, a comprehensive subset of references
to conceptual knowledge, allowing geo-spatially dominated
facetted knowledge, was created, further developed, and ﬁ-
nally compiled from the application case studies, which have
been conducted over the last three decades. Knowledge based
fundaments, e.g., those built on UDC, showed to have a very
high impact on knowledge creation and mining in theory and
practice, not only for spatial knowledge.
The knowledge approach proved to be a fundamental “en-
abler” and contributed signiﬁcantly to many solutions. Cov-
ering a coherent system of knowledge provides a holistic and
consistent environment for any scenario, which is supported by
excellent features for facetted knowledge. The referenced con-
ceptual knowledge itself is consistent due to its development
and publication via editions. Implementations support fully
multi-disciplinary context and multi-lingual instances for many
languages. Solutions are extensible to integrate and ﬁt special
purposes. The methodology is data-centric and scalable for
width and depth of knowledge as well as for infrastructure re-
quirements. All the cases so far implementing the presented so-
lution provided seamless integration with common geo-spatial
practices and showed excellent sustainability, knowledge cov-
erage, long-term characteristics, and scalability. In review of
these results, all major institutions, e.g., libraries focussing on
information science and research data management, are using
and developing conceptual knowledge with their core tasks,
which opens up a wide range of excellent knowledge sources,
which can be considered high value resources. Moreover,
such Knowledge Resources are complementary, independent
of the fact that they can incorporate different methods and
approaches, e.g., thesauri, semantic frameworks, ontologies,
and phonetic interfaces for the content they handle.
Future research on theory and practice will concentrate on
further developing the spectrum of references and creating
knowledge reference based solutions for scenarios and disci-
plines.
