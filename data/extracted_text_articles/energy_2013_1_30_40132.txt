Abstract—Wind power gains a great attention among 
renewable energies because of its relative cost competitiveness 
and the maturity of the technology. This paper proposes the 
EPON-based communication network architectures as a 
promising candidate to replace the current switched-based 
networks for wind power farm (WPF). EPON-based networks 
combine the advantages of both the optical network technology 
and Ethernet technology. The proposed WPF network 
architecture is based on the electric transmission topology and 
consists of a central optical line terminal (OLT) placed in the 
control center and optical network units (ONUs) deployed on 
the wind turbines (WTs) side. There are no active electronic 
devices used between the OLT and the WT-ONUs to reduce 
the cost and complexity of maintenance and deployment. Two 
different EPON-based architectures for an offshore WPF have 
been proposed and compared in terms of optical power budget, 
path loss and network cost. The power budget is analyzed to 
ensure that the received signal power is enough to maintain 
acceptable 
performances 
even 
though 
the 
lengths 
of 
communication link between the control center and WTs are 
different. The total path loss includes the power reduction 
from fiber, connectors and splitters. The results show that the 
received power of each WT in EPON-based architecture 
satisfies the power budget requirements of IEEE standard.  
Also, the analysis of network elements shows that EPON-based 
architectures have a cost effective solution.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Nowadays, large-scale wind power farm become a reality. 
Many offshore projects were scheduled to be constructed in 
the coming years, to overcome the fossil fuel dependence, 
and reduce CO2 emissions. These platforms represent many 
engineering challenges related to electrical connectivity and 
communication infrastructures [1]. Current communication 
infrastructures were designed several decades ago, based on 
old technologies that have a low bandwidth such as 
telephone lines which need to be upgraded. To meet the 
demand of control operations and smart grid applications, 
communication infrastructures need fundamental changes to 
be reliable, scalable and extendable to future services and 
applications [2]. Supervisory control and data acquisition 
(SCADA) is the basis for monitoring, control and data 
gathering of wind power farm (WPF). It allows for remote 
control, monitoring of individual turbines, and monitoring 
the wind farm as a whole from central control station or from 
a remote control center. Furthermore, it enables full 
communication with the operator, manufacturer and 
maintenance staff [3].  
Ethernet passive optical network (EPON) technology is 
an optical access network, designed to serve customers with 
voice, video and data services. EPON is broadly deployed in 
Korea and Japan while GPON (Gigabit PON) is widely 
deployed in parts of the U.S. and Europe [4]. EPON-based 
networks were developed to solve the bandwidth bottleneck 
in the access network. Recently, many researchers have 
begun to address the applications of EPON technology in 
smart grid and power system.    
In China, there are many successful installations of 
communication network based on EPON technology in 
electric power system such as Yangjiaping power 
distribution [5]. Also, the authors in [6] present an integrated 
communication platform of a photovoltaic (PV) power 
station, which integrates EPON, power line carrier and 
wireless communication. The authors of [7] propose 
transmission lines monitoring system based on long distance 
EPON and wireless technology of Wi-Fi.  
Modern large-scale WPFs are located at offshore, with 
growing in wind farm size (number of WTs) and wind 
turbine capacity. These platforms represent great challenges 
in view of accessibility, reliability, cost and maintenance. 
The 
conventional 
communication 
infrastructures 
are 
switched-based, where each wind tower comprises an 
Ethernet switch (ESW) to interconnect communication 
devices inside the wind tower and the ESW requires electric 
power supply in the WPF field [8]. The prices of these 
industrial switches are expensive compared with the normal 
Ethernet switch [9]. The EPON is one of the promising 
candidates for next generation WPF because it provides high 
performance communication network with low cost, low 
power consumption and high reliability. The EPON doesn’t 
use active components between OLT and ONUs. This may 
result in the limitation of growing wind farm size because 
optical power budget operates as a bottleneck for EPON-
based WPF architectures. 
In this paper, we proposed two different communication 
network architectures based on EPON technology for 
offshore WPF. The power budget is calculated and compared 
to ensure that the received signal power is enough to

maintain acceptable performance under all conditions, due to 
limitation of EPON optical power. The optical power budget 
calculation in this paper includes losses in fiber, connectors 
and splitters. Also, we analyze the network cost to ensure the 
advantages of proposed architectures.   
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
presents the related work. In Section 3, the WPF layout is 
described. Section 4 details the proposed EPON-based 
network architecture with two different configurations; 
architecture (A) and (B).  Section 5 shows the optical power 
budget, path loss and network cost calculation and discussion. 
Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusion and the direction 
of future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK  
A. WPF Architecture  
First, The WPF consists of individual WTs connected 
together, and tied to the collector system. From the electrical 
topological point of view, the WTs are connected to the 
utility system through transformers and distribution lines, 
including one or more meteorological mast [10]. From the 
communication network point of view, the WPF includes the 
integration of SCADA systems, wind power management 
systems, protection and control systems, and various 
intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) [11].  
The information gathered from the WPF is processed for 
control and protection functions. Logically, according to IEC 
61850, the WPF comprising of three levels; process level, 
bay level and station level.  In the process level, sensors and 
IEDs transmits/receives small raw/control data packets [12]. 
At the station level, different devices are existing including 
for example; WTC (wind turbine controller), condition 
monitoring system (CMS), HMI (human machine interface), 
circuit breaker (CB) control, metering server, meteorological 
server and WPF server. Fig. 1 shows the WPF information 
flow, where each server provides information of, or controls 
to its devices.

B. Swiched-based Communication Networks for WPF 
The communication systems for WTs can be classified 
into two different categories [13][14]: 
a) Inside the turbine tower, including the WT controller, 
sensors and IEDs. This network supports different traffic 
such as CCTV system and internet connection to enable 
monitoring and controlling of the WT tower, as shown in Fig. 
2; 
b) Between wind turbines (within the WPF), including 
the connection between wind towers. This part constitutes 
the SCADA system. Due to the high cost of laying cables, 
optical fibers are integrated with the medium voltage and 
may follow the electrical topologies. The most widely types 
of communication networks are radial, ring and star. 
III. 
WIND POWER FARM LAYOUT  
A. Offshore WPF-Collector System Layout  
We designed the EPON network architectures based on 
the electric system layout of medium size offshore WPF, 
with four radials, 48 WTs and different cable lengths as 
shown in Fig. 3. All electric radial cables are connected to 
the offshore platform where the voltage is stepped up and the 
power is transmitted to shore. The circuit breakers and the 
main protection instruments are configured at different 
regions of the system [15][16]. The WPF is divided into four 
groups with 2Km space between each other. Each group is 
served by an electric power cable connected from the 
offshore platform to the nearest WT. Inside each group; the 
spacing between individual WTs is equivalent to 1Km along 
rows and between rows.  
The longest cable length between the offshore platform 
and WTs is 4.47Km, connected to WT-B01 and WT-G01, 
while the short cable length is 2.23Km connected to turbines 
WT-D01 and WT-E01. The submarine cable between the 
point of common coupling (PCC) from grid side and the 
offshore platform is 5Km. Due to the high cost of laying

cables; the logical option is to use the same power 
distribution cable routes for the SCADA communication 
network. In this work, the optical fibers are integrated within 
the electric submarine cables, therefore the communication 
network follow the wind farm electrical topology. 
B. Design of WPF Communication Network Based on 
EPON Technology 
EPON technology is an optical access network, consists 
of optical line terminal (OLT), optical network units (ONU), 
and passive optical splitter (POS). The physical layer uses 
PON technology while MAC layer uses the Ethernet 
technology which combines the advantage of low flexibility, 
low cost and high bandwidth [17]. Fig. 4 shows the proposed 
structure of the WPFs based on EPON technology. There are 
three main architectures; architectures (A&B) represent the 
design of new planned WPFs, while architecture (C) 
illustrates modifying existing WPFs to support EPON 
technology. 
The proposed network model consists of ONU deployed 
on the WT side, for collecting data from different internal 
networks. All ONUs from different WTs are connected to a 
central OLT, placed in the control center. There are no active 
electronic elements used between the ONUs and the OLT, 
which reduce the costs and complexity of maintenance and 
deployment.  
PON 
network 
architectures 
include 
different 
configuration such as star, ring and bus which can be applied 
for different WPF configurations. Also, it can be deployed in 
a redundant configuration as a double ring or a double tree. 
In Fig. 4, in control center side, there are two OLT connected 
to different WPF servers through Ethernet networks.

Figure 4.  Schematic view of proposed EPON-based architectures for 
WPF 
Architecture (A) represents star configuration, there are 
four ONUs connected to one POS using distributed fibers, 
where one ONU supports one standalone wind turbine traffic. 
In architecture (B), there are four POSs connected in cascade, 
each ONU supports standalone WT traffic. 
Architecture (C) shows the radial design, where all WTs 
are connected in series to one feeder. This hybrid 
architecture comprises both Ethernet switches (ESW) and 
ONUs. The traffic from each feeder is supported by one 
ONU, transmitted to control center through POS. All 
transmissions in a PON are performed between OLT and 
ONUs. Therefore, in the downstream direction (from OLT to 
ONUs), PON is a point to multipoint network, while in the 
upstream direction; it is a multipoint to point network. 
IV. 
EPON-BASED NETWORK ARCHITECTURE 
This 
section 
considers 
two 
different 
network 
architectures for WPF. All WTs are connected together in a 
radial topology from WTs (A01A06) till WTs (H01 
H06) as shown in Fig. 3. We assumed that: 
 
An OLT unit  is installed in the control center; 
 
Each WT has only one ONU device; 
 
Different network architectures are designed, using 
feeder fiber (FF), distributed fiber (DF) and passive 
optical splitter (POS). 
 For simplicity, the detail description of communication 
network for one group is given is more details, which is 
applicable for the whole WPF. The primary POS (1×8) is 
located on the offshore platform. Part of its output ports are 
connected to the four WTs groups, while the remaining ports 
are connected to IEDs and protection devices located on the 
offshore platform.

Architectures A: This begins with an OLT unit located in 
the control center, connected with a 5Km feeder fiber to the 
primary POS (1×8) located on the offshore platform. 
Cascade splitters are used to reduce the amount of deployed 
fiber in the network. The primary POS is connect to 
secondary POS in WT-B01, while the other output ports are 
connected to other secondary POS located at WT-D01, WT-
E01, WT-G01 respectively. The WT-B01 has the two 
identical POS (primary and secondary); both are (1×2). For 
all other wind turbines (WT-A01WT-A06 and WT-
B02WT-B06), each WT has only one POS (1×2); one port 
is connected using DF to the next WT, while the other port is 
connected to the WT-ONU unit.  
Architectures B: It differs from configuration (A) as it 
has less number of POS. Secondary POS is (1×2), the same 
like configuration (A). The first output port from secondary 
POS is connected to another POS (1×6) exist in WT-D01 
with six output ports. Each WT from (WT-D01WT-D06) 
has dedicated optical fiber cable from WT-D01. Also, the 
POS exist in WT-C01 is (1×6) connects a dedicated path to 
(WT-C01WT-C06). Group (2) in Fig. 5 shows the 
network elements of configuration (B). 
V. 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  
In this section we will study the performance of proposed 
WPF architectures with respect to power budget, path loss 
and network cost. In our network model, the OLT located in 
control center use a single port to serve the 48-WTs through 
different POS. There is no splices exist in the fiber link in 
our calculation. Passive optical splitters with split ratio of 
(1×2) and (1×8) are used for WPF configuration. The OLT 
transmits its downstream data to WTs over single-mode fiber 
(1000BASE‑PX20‑D) which supports at least 20 Km with 
1490nm, while each WT transmitted its upstream data to 
control center at 1310nm. Both upstream and downstream 
operate at 1.25Gbps [17][18].  
A. Optical Power Budget  
In case of 1000Base-PX20, the power budget for EPON 
specified in IEEE 802.3ah is 26 dB, including channel 
insertion loss, dispersion and noise. Table 2 shows the EPON 
specification according to IEEE 802.3ah standard. 
The optical budget [dB] in Equation (1) is the difference 
between the minimum transmitter launch power (Ptx,dBm) 
at the input of the optical link, and the minimum sensitivity 
of the receiver (Prx,dBm) at the output of optical links.  
 
                        Power Budget = Ptx - Prx                             (1) 
 
Along the communication link, there are many sources of 
attenuation including, connections, splitters and the fiber 
cable itself. The total insertion loss must be less than the 
value of power budget [19]. The total power loss (Ps) of 
passive components of optical link given in [dB] is 
calculated as shown in Equation (2). Note that, a safety 
margin due to aging of the Tx/Rx elements, and the effect of 
temperature should be considered in total optical power loss 
calculation.   
 
               Ps = ILcable Length + ILconn Nconn + ILsplit              (2) 
Where: 
ILcable      : Insertion loss for cable [dB/Km] 
Length    : length of cable from OLT to ONU 
ILconn      : Insertion loss per connector [dB] 
Nconn       : number of connectors (optical connection pairs) 
ILsplit       : Insertion loss for splitters [dB]

We considered the fiber attenuation is 0.4dB/Km, and the 
connector loss is 0.2dB. Passive optical splitter (1×2) 
insertion loss is 0.4dB for split ratio of 5%:95%, while the 
insertion loss is 3dB for split ratio of 50%:50%, as shown in 
Table 3.  
Figures (6, 7) show the total optical path loss calculation 
for 24 WTs of architectures (A&B) from WT-A01to WT-
D06. The remaining WTs from WT25 to WT48 are not 
shown as the WPF is symmetrical with same dimensions and 
configurations. In Fig. 6, group (1) represents 12 WTs 
connected in radial topology. With 1Km between WTs, fiber 
attenuation is 0.4 dB, connector loss is 0.4 dB and POS has 
the insertion loss of 0.4 dB. This is reason why the total loss 
appears to be growing linearly. The highest optical path loss 
value represents the farthest turbine (A06), about 24.18 dB, 
while the lowest value represents the nearest turbine (D01), 
about 16.89 dB. Considering the IEEE 802.3 standard, 
architecture (A) satisfies the requirements. In Fig. 7, the 
highest value of optical path loss for (A06) is about 28.78 dB, 
while the lowest value for WT19 is about 25.49 dB.

Figure 7.  Total optical Path Loss of WPF- Architecture (B)  
In architecture (B), the connector loss and POSs insertion 
loss are not changing according to distance: about 1.6 dB and 
21 dB, respectively. Each WT has a dedicated fiber to the 
secondary POS with fiber attenuation loss of 0.4 dB/Km. 
The dominant part of path loss is related to primary POS 
with 1:8 split ratio. Thus, architecture (B) does not fulfill the 
required of power budget. If we consider the new power 
budget classes (PX-30, PX-40) for symmetric (1/1G) as 
shown in Table 2, both network architectures will fulfill the 
required power budget [20]. If we re-configured the network 
architecture by placing the OLT unit at offshore platform, 
and connect each WPF group using dedicated optical fibers 
(DF1DF4). In this case, we could eliminate the path loss 
of the POS (1×8), which has a significant contribution to the 
path loss. For architecture (B), the highest value of path loss 
for (A06) will be 17.38 dB, while the lowest value for (D01) 
will be 14.1 dB. We believe that the industry will provide 
optical components with lower insertion loss which increases 
the launch power and improve the receiver sensitivity. 
B. Network Cost 
Capital expenditure (CAPEX) consists of both initial 
network equipments, and network installation costs [15]. In 
this work, the submarine cable comprises the electrical 
collection cables and optical fiber cables. Because the 
communication network part is integrated with the electrical 
system, we consider only the network equipment cost to 
evaluate and compare different network architectures. The 
network cost is calculated as follows:  
 
         CEPON = COLT + CFF + CPOS + CDF + NONU.CONU             (3) 
 
where COLT, CPOS and CONU represent the equipment of 
OLT, POS and ONU, respectively. CFF and CDF represent the 
costs of optical fiber cable of feeder fiber (FF) and 
distributed fiber (DF), respectively. NONU represents the 
number of WTs-ONUs.  
Fig. 8 shows the network cost for different WPF layouts 
and sizes: 12WTs, 24WTs and 48WTs. EPON-based 
architectures have the lowest cost compared with switched 
architectures. Architecture (A) is about 42,284 US $ for 
48WTs, and about 59,084 US $ for architecture (B). 
Compared with switched-based architecture with consists of 
optical fiber cables and Ethernet switches, the network cost 
is 99,984 US $. The comparative cost analysis shows that 
EPON-based architectures are a cost effective solution for 
wind power farm.

CONCLUSION 
 In this paper, we proposed two different communication 
network architectures based on EPON technology for 
offshore WPF. In order to evaluate the proposed 
communication architectures, we consider offshore WPF 
with 48 WTs which is located 5Km from the shore. The total 
path loss is analyzed for each wind turbine to assure that 
optical power budget is sufficient for maintaining an 
acceptable performance under any conditions. Considering 
the new power budget classes (PX-30, PX-40), our proposed 
architectures are valid for the offshore WPF, and the power 
budget can be also satisfied. This analysis results showed the 
applicability and robustness of EPON-based communication 
network architectures that can be applied for next generation 
WPF. There are two directions of our future works. First is 
building a simulation model of EPON-based architectures to 
evaluate network performance such as reliability, packet 
delay and packet loss in both upstream and downstream 
direction, considering turbine monitoring and controlling 
data and a real WPF dimensions. Second direction is 
considering hybrid network architectures of EPON and IEEE 
802.16 (WiMAX) for large-scale WPF. The wireless link of 
WiMAX can be incorporated into the WPF design as backup 
link to increase the network reliability.
