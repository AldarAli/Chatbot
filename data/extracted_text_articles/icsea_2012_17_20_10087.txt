Abstract—Customization is an important market trend be-
cause companies can only survive when they focus on their
customers’ needs. In order to offer demand-driven customiza-
tion options, it is necessary to empirically analyze the beneﬁt
of the various adaptations from a customer’s point of view. In
the software sector, only a few surveys have been conducted
that exceed technical aspects. Moreover, existing studies are
limited to the overall acceptance and beneﬁts of customization,
but draw no conclusions on different adaptation options. Thus,
we present a large study that analyzes the starting points of
software customization and deals with general questions of
customization. The results indicate that software customization
increases the willingness to pay (WTP) by about 15%. The
survey points out that especially customization options, which
adapt the functionality, increase the usability, and enable
parental controls are of great importance for future soft-
ware implementation. Hence, our results enable competitive
advantages by implementing customization options that meet
customer needs.

I. INTRODUCTION
Today, competitive pressure and customer empowerment
change selling conditions. Customers are no longer willing
to accept the customer sacriﬁce [1], [2], the gap between
products offered and customer needs. That is why the long
tail phenomenon [3], [4] starts to rule the market and a multi-
tude of tiny niche markets replaces traditional mass markets.
Hence, producers turn from selling off-the-shelf products to
offering customization. ˚Ahlstr¨om and Westbrook [5] have
shown that the demand for non-standard products is even
growing and producers plan to increase customization.
This trend can also be seen in the software sector. Software
product lines (SPL) help to build software that satisﬁes a
speciﬁc market segment on the basis of a common set of
core assets [6]. However, accessibility movements and the
regulation by law demand an even stronger focus on the
individual (cf. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act [7]
and the German Equality Law For Disabled People [8]).
However, accessibility is not the only reason for software
customization. The International Standard on Ergonomics
of Human System Interaction (ISO 9241/110) indicates that
customization is an important principle to design a dialog.
The Technical Report on Software Engineering (ISO/IEC
TR 9126-2) even says that customization is a requirement
of software quality that helps to meet the user’s needs.
Software customization could also enhance the customer
experience [9]. Thus, customization is a crucial part in
current software engineering.
There are various ways to customize software. The DUFS
customization classiﬁcation [10] organizes this richness and
helps us to outline software customization. This categoriza-
tion subdivides design customization, usability customiza-
tion, functionality customization, and customization of ser-
vice and communication. In this context, design customiza-
tion means an adaptation of the appearance of the Graphical
User Interface (GUI). As companies can only prosper if they
focus on their customers, software developers need to know
which customization features are in demand. A previous
empirical study [5] cites this lack of knowledge of customer
needs as the major difﬁculty in customization.
Nevertheless, existing studies often only focus on non-
software vendors and software customization surveys are
limited to technical aspects. Thus, we conduct a compre-
hensive survey. This paper elaborates on the small excerpt
presented in a previous paper [10]. The detailed results
on customization enable an in-depth analysis of customer
evaluation. Hence, customer opinions of customization in
the non-software sector as well as in the software sector
are considered and future chances are identiﬁed. To our
knowledge this survey is the largest one in terms of software
customization and the only one that considers customization
starting points. Thus, our study helps software developers
to decide on customization implementation and provide
adaptations that are valuable for their customers.
In the following, Section II summarizes previous surveys
on customization and explains why analyses of non-software
customization provide valuable insights that could be used
for software customization. Section III introduces our study
and illustrates the methods used. Afterwards, Section IV
presents the non-software analysis and spotlights customiza-
tion usage. The results of the software customization in-
vestigation are presented in Section V. Before concluding,
Section VI critically examines the survey.

II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
The beginnings of customization go back to 1987, when
Stanley Davis introduced a business strategy to implement
customization called Mass Customization (MC) [11]. In
1993, Joseph Pine made this strategy popular [12]. From
then on, the trend of customization spread. The following
lists the most important studies on customization in the
non-software sector as well as in the software sector. Ad-
ditionally, the section shows why ﬁndings of non-software
products could be valuable for software products.
A. Non-Software Products vs. Software Products
Kotler and Armstrong described a product as ”anything that
can be offered to a market for attention, acquisition, use,
or consumption that might satisfy a want or need” [13].
Additionally, Peter Dracker stated that a company can only
prosper if it focuses on its customers and their needs [14].
Consequently, the customer’s perception of the product and
its value determines the company’s success.
According to Kittlaus and Clough [15], the value that
comes out of the intangible product software can only be
realized in its functionality. However, the emergence of
appearance customization in software, e.g., the tailoring
of forum appearances, shows that software is more than
something to get things done. Thus, there are similarities
in customer perception between non-software and software
products, even though they differ greatly in characteristics.
Due to the importance of customer perception, we be-
lieve that ﬁndings from the non-software area in terms of
perceived customization could be valuable for the software
sector. This practice is useful since the non-software sector
has a much longer history and many people see software as
incomprehensible ”black magic” [16]. Thus, non-software
products are well-known to a wider audience whereas soft-
ware knowledge could still be limited.
In contrast to non-software products, many software
characteristics support its customizability. Software has no
physical form and belongs to the economic factor of knowl-
edge [15], [16]. This makes later adaptations easier and
enables repeated customization. As Frederick Brooks said,
this easy adaptability obliges software vendors to offer
adaptation options [17]. Besides, the delivery of software
is simple, fast and could be made on an individual basis.
These facts facilitate software customization.
B. Previous Studies on Non-Software Customization
To address customer needs it is important to know which
product features create value from a customer’s point of
view. As only customers can answer this question properly,
many surveys have been conducted. Unfortunately, many of
them only consider non-software products [18], [19], [20].
Piller et al. [21] listed existing studies of MC and highlighted
especially the additional contribution that could be achieved
with the help of customization. By offering shoes that are
adapted in terms of ﬁt, function and design, the sporting
goods producer Adidas, e.g., achieved 30 to 50% higher
prices [21], [22]. However, in 1998 Huffman and Kahn [23]
empirically documented problems in information retrieval.
C. Previous Studies on Software Customization
Despite the ﬁtness of software for customization few studies
analyze general aspects of software customization. The most
important one was made in 1991 by Mackay [24]. She
observed the triggers and barriers of software customization.
According to her, the main triggers are the reusing of
repeated patterns, the retroﬁtting after a system change, and
the avoidance of annoying behavior. In contrast, barriers are
a lack of time and knowledge. In 1996, these results were
proven by Page et al. [25].
Most existing studies on software customization only
consider technical aspects. Many authors compared the three
methods of software customization. Adaptable initiatives are
based on the self-customization of the user. Moreover, in
the non-software area it is also quite common for manu-
facturers to adapt the product to the customer’s needs. In
the software sector this can be done by the software itself.
This method is known as adaptive initiative. Additionally,
software could use a mixed initiative which combines both
aspects. Thus, several studies tried to identify the best
practices for designing menus [26], [27] or GUIs [28], [29],
[30]. Furthermore, research is done to analyze accessibility
aspects [31], [32]. These studies veriﬁed the beneﬁts of
software customization. With regard to quantitative aspects,
an increase in performance and decrease in error rates could
be measured. Moreover, improvements in qualitative aspects,
such as usability, stress in usage, and individual prefer-
ences, became visible. The increase in user satisfaction,
a software quality requirement (cf. ISO/IEC 25051:2006),
was empirically veriﬁed in a study on Apache Security
Software [33]. However, its validity was limited by only
interviewing skilled users.
The ﬁnancial effects of software customization have been
studied by Oliver et al. [34]. They found that 5 to 10% higher
proﬁt margins and doubled revenues could be realized.
All existing surveys on the subjective advantages of
software customization focused on overall feelings but no
conclusions on the acceptance and beneﬁt of particular
customization features could be drawn. Thus, we conducted
a large study that used the DUFS customization classiﬁca-
tion [10] to analyze customer perception on different cus-
tomization options. DUFS sub-divides software customiza-
tion into four categories. Design customization sums up all
options that help adapt the interface’s appearance according
to the customer’s preferences. Usability customization refers
to adaptations which make the software more effective,
efﬁcient and task satisfying (cf. DIN EN ISO 9241 Part 11).
All customization options that help close the gap between
offered and needed functionalities belong to the category of

functionality customization. Customized auxiliary services
and customized software messages and greetings are part
of service and communication customization. By using this
categorization and involving heterogeneous user groups our
survey gives detailed insights into the appraisal of software
customization. Additionally, it deals with general questions
on customization to form a basis for in-depth research.
III. METHODS
Our empirical study analyzes customization from a cus-
tomer’s point of view. All values in the text are rounded
off to two digits after the decimal point.
A. Data Collection and Sample
As previously outlined [10], the study was conducted in
2010 in South Germany. The answers of ten interviewees
could not be used because of missing data. Thus, the study
includes the answers of 274 participants. 43.43% of them
are female. The sample includes heterogeneous participants
(cf. Fig. 1 and Table I). The survey could be completed
either electronically (20.44%) or in paper form (79.65%).

The sample is slightly different to the whole German
population because of the proximity to the University of
Ulm. It includes comparatively many young, well-educated
participants and male opinions are somewhat overrated.
However, the large and heterogeneous sample allows con-
clusions to be drawn on perceived customization.
B. Participant Grouping
Two participants had never used a computer before, so
the sample size for the computer-related questions is 272.
For analysis purposes these participants were divided into
frequent users that use their computer daily and perform at
least ﬁve different tasks and non-frequent users. The study
contains data of 175 frequent and 97 non-frequent users.
IV. CUSTOMIZATION USAGE AND REASONS
The survey started with non-software customization to fa-
cilitate access and ensure the quality of the given answers.
Additionally, it helps to get elementary insights into cus-
tomization. These results are pointed out in the following.
A. Customization Usage
In order to analyze customization usage we subdivided non-
software products into the categories clothing and shoes,
vehicles and bikes, grocery and beverages, stationery, sou-
venirs, jewelry, health care, as well as electronic articles.
The survey gave examples of customization in the different
categories. This helped to ensure that all participants could
properly answer if they had ever used customization in these
categories. Fig. 2 illustrates the results.

Figure 2. Customization Usage.
The overall usage rate of 51.19% supports customization
research. Besides of adaptations of electronic articles, gro-
cery and beverage, customization usage is quite common.
Analyses of the adaptation starting points with the help
of the DEFS customization categories design, ergonomics
and ﬁtting, functionality, as well as services [10] show that
in most of the product categories adaptations are generally
minor variations in design. These adaptations are used with
clothing and shoes, vehicles and bikes, grocery and bever-
age, stationery, souvenirs, jewelry, and electronics. Neverthe-
less, products with adaptations to increase the ergonomics
and ﬁtting are also available. In the health sector these
adaptations are necessary to cope with the customer-speciﬁc
body. However, even clothes or shoes are adaptable in
terms of ergonomics. Thus, e.g., the sporting goods producer
Adidas offers ergonomically adaptable shoes. Above all, the
categories vehicles and bikes as well as electronic articles
offer ways of adapting the functionalities by adding adequate
modules. In contrast, service customization is only rarely
available in the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) sector.

B. Reasons for Customization Usage
The survey tried to get an insight into the reasons for the
named customization usage. The participants had to state if
they use customization to adapt the functionality, adapt the
design, highlight individuality aspects, or participate in a
future trend. They also got the chance to say they see no
beneﬁt in customization. This question was semi-open and
multiple answers were allowed. Fig. 3 lists the results.

Figure 3. Reasons for Customization Usage.
According to the participants, the main reason for cus-
tomization is to adapt the functionality. Another frequently
named reason is design adaptation. The enhancement of
one’s individuality which rests on a human basic need was
also seen as a major factor. Moreover, only 13.14% of the
participants see no beneﬁt in customization. In contrast,
18.08% judge customization as an important future trend.
This justiﬁes the importance of this paper’s topic.
The free-text answers showed that customization is used
to possess something unique, increase the imaginary value,
differ from the mass, and give presents. The participants also
revealed the importance of value for money aspects.
Since the female and male answers differ, we did a Chi-
Square Test (α = 0.05) to analyze this. Table II shows that
only the fact that the women use customization more often
to highlight their individuality (41.18% vs. 28.39%) could
be traced back to gender.

V. SOFTWARE CUSTOMIZATION
The second part of the survey examined the usage of
existing software customization options, ﬁnancial beneﬁts
for software vendors, and future chances.
A. Usage of Software Customization
In order to get meaningful results on the perception of
existing software customization options, we chose features
that are well-known to participants of all age categories.
The participants rated 15 adaptation options in the areas
operating systems, Ofﬁce products and world wide web. All
but one are adaptable options because users take more notice
of self-made changes than of automatic ones. This increases
the reliability of the ﬁndings. With regard to usability,
we listed the creation of links, creation of bookmarks,
the quick launch bar of the operating system, and the
tool bars of Ofﬁce programs which all help to get quick
access. Usability aspects can also be customized by tailoring
the update handling and choosing one’s native language.
Existing software offers many features to adapt the design,
i.e. the GUI appearance. We chose the adaptation of fonts,
colors and contrasts, icon size, desktop background, mouse
pointer, and the screen saver. Furthermore, the participants
judged the functional customization offered by iGoogle
and Windows gadgets. Since service customization is only
rarely available in the B2C sector, we limited our survey to
adaptive purchase proposals in online shops.
The survey explained each feature to ensure that all partic-
ipants understood the questions. Afterwards, the participants
stated if they knew the customization option and if they had
ever used this adaptation. Additionally, they rated the beneﬁt
of each option. According to Schwarz et al. scales with zero-
to-positive-values should be used to measure the intensity of
a single attribute [35]. Thus, we used a scale from 0 to 5 to
evaluate the feature’s beneﬁt. A value of 5 indicates that it is
very useful. In contrast, a beneﬁt of 0 shows that this feature
has no beneﬁt at all. Fig. 4 illustrates the results and maps
them to the DUFS software customization categorization.
It also shows the usage of the customization options. Even
though most of the options are well known, some partic-
ipants did not know several features. We excluded these
participants to calculate a meaningful percentage of usage.
The strong correlation (Pearson’s r = 0.87) between beneﬁt
values and usage highlights that the customer’s view is of
crucial importance in terms of customization research.

ticular achieved high beneﬁt values. Design customization
options are rated with high beneﬁt values, too. In contrast,
functionality adaptations as well as adaptations of service
and communication are rated particularly low. This might
be based on some external factors. In contrast to the long-
established examples in the categories usability and design,
the speciﬁed functionality adaptations are quite new. This
negatively inﬂuences the knowledge, acceptance and also the
perceived beneﬁt. The results of customization usage in the
non-software sector verify this argumentation. Functionality
adaptations are the main reason named for customization.
Furthermore, it has to be pointed out that service adaptations
have only been rarely available to date in the B2C sector.
Additionally, our ﬁndings show that all evaluated design
customization options achieved lower beneﬁt values than
usability adaptations. All functionality customization options
achieved lower beneﬁt values than design adaptations and
service and communication customization options are left far
behind. This proves that the DUFS classiﬁcation categories
reﬂect customer perception adequately.
B. Willingness To Pay
We differ between non-software and software products to
examine the Willingness To Pay (WTP) and evaluated the
additional contribution in comparison to an off-the-shelf
product. As our goal was to analyze the general WTP
rather than the WTP for a speciﬁc product, we chose an
hypothetical approach. The analyses of Miller et al. [36]
showed that hypothetical approaches could generate mean
WTP estimations that do not signiﬁcantly differ from the
actual WTP and could be used to make meaningful manage-
ment decisions. Our participants had to state if they would
pay not more, 10%, 25%, 50% more, double the price, or
more than double the price to get a customized product. The
latter was quantiﬁed by a contribution of 150%. Table III
summarizes the results – speciﬁed by age and user-group.
The WTP of the participants younger than 15 years and
older than 69 years are not representative but are listed for
completeness.

The overall average willingness for an additional contri-
bution in the non-software sector is 15.22% and indicates
that there is a broad-mindedness for customization. Other
surveys in the mass customization area document an even
higher WTP of about 30% and partly 100% [21], [37].
The average contribution of 14.97% in the software sector
is lower. The reason for this could be that software is not
a daily product for everybody and could seem to be less
important. This argumentation is veriﬁed by the fact that
the average contribution of non-frequent users is 14.90%
in terms of non-software products but 13.79% with regard
to software. In contrast, the average contribution of the
participants with frequent computer usage is in both product
categories exactly the same (15.46%). These ﬁndings could
encourage the assumption that in a world where computer
usage becomes increasingly common the WTP for software
customization will become more similar to non-software
products. Thus, the analysis of non-software products could
be valuable for software vendors.
C. Future Chances
In order to evaluate the potential of software customiza-
tion, the survey contained an appraisal of the perceived
future chances. We used the DUFS classiﬁcation to make
a distinction. By adding the subcategory parental controls
we extended the DUFS category functionality. The category
usability was also further divided by using the subcategories
intuitiveness and language. This enables detailed analyses.
In every category the participants rated the future chances
of software customization by evaluating their need for future
implementation. The survey highlighted that participants
should incorporate adaptable and adaptive adaptations. Once
again we used a 0-to-5 scale to achieve consistency and
support the reliability of the results. A value of 0 marks
no future requirements whereas a value of 5 characterizes
great future requirements. Fig. 5 illustrates the mean future
requirements and their variances in a simpliﬁed Software
Customization Chart (SCC) [10]. In contrast to a full SCC,
we make no distinction between adaptable, adaptive or
mixed initiatives.

great future chances in usability customization. Customiza-
tion options which enable parental control by limiting the
available functionality achieved high support, too. Moreover,
the results support the importance of adapting the language
of the GUI. The participants also called for an improvement
in design adaptations and the intuitive software handling.
In terms of service and communication customization the
estimations were only moderate. This might be based on the
fact that the participants could not evaluate the beneﬁts of
service customization because of the low availability in the
B2C sector. In summary, an overall value of 3.49 emphasizes
the future chances of software customization and highlights
the need for further research. Furthermore, the differences in
the starting-point evaluation support the DUFS classiﬁcation.
We performed t-tests to verify the differences in evalua-
tions of female and male participants. The results (cf. Ta-
ble IV) indicate that the differences in the categories design,
communication, and parental controls depend on gender.
With regard to parental controls the female rated the future
requirement very high (4.10) in comparison to a moderate
rate in the male group (3.58). The women also rated the
future chances of design adaptations (3.89) as well as
adaptations in services and communication (2.61) higher
than the men did (3.23 resp. 1.90). In all other categories
the differences could not be tracked back to gender.
Further t-tests analyzed the higher valuation of the fre-
quent computer users. Table IV illustrates that the differ-
ences in the rating of intuitiveness, design, and language
depend on the frequency of computer usage. Fig. 6 shows
these differences.

VI. DISCUSSION
In the following, some threats to validity are considered and
the importance of this paper’s topic is proved.
A. Threats to Validity
The chosen questions could have an impact on the results
and be a threat to internal validity. However, we controlled
this by carefully designing the questionnaire, avoiding am-
biguous questions, keeping consistency, and using well
known examples within the survey. Moreover, we checked
the survey in a pretest with ﬁve persons.
A potential threat to external validity might be the rep-
resentativeness. However, the age, the profession, and the
expertise of the participants differ signiﬁcantly and the data
set is sufﬁciently large. To our knowledge, this is actually the
largest study of customer acceptance and beneﬁts of software
customization. Moreover, it is the only one that evaluates
software customization starting-points. Hence, we judge the
reported results to be meaningful.
The large sample size also supports the validity of the
Chi-Square Test in Section IV. Although, there is only one
degree of freedom, the minimal expected frequencies (15.64
to 59.07) are far away from the critical border of ten.
B. Validation of the Need for Customization
The results show that some answers are related to being part
of a speciﬁc user group, e.g., men or women or frequent
or non-frequent users. Yet, many evaluations are based on
the user’s experience, characteristics, and preferences. This
diversity can be seen in the listed variances (cf. Fig. 5). Only
customization could cope with these individual aspects.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we analyzed the acceptance and beneﬁts of
customization in the non-software as well as in the software
sector. For this reason, we conducted a comprehensive study
with 284 participants. Our results showed that customers
want customization and are willing to pay a contribution of
about 15% for adaptable or adaptive software. The results
revealed an overwhelming approval of software customiza-
tion but indicated unused capabilities in existing systems.
The participants use the existing software customization

options. However, they highlighted that the importance of the
adaptation depends on the starting point of the customiza-
tion. The participants especially emphasized the beneﬁts
of adaptations to increase the usability. With regard to
future software engineering, the participants called for the
improvement of functionality and usability customization
options. Moreover, they requested further adaptations in
parental controls. Additionally, the ﬁndings supported the
DUFS customization classiﬁcation. In summary, the study
gave insight into the perception of software customization
from a customer’s point of view. This could help software
developers to detect valuable software customization and
provide software that exactly meets customer-speciﬁc needs.
For future work, the enlargement of the study could
identify cultural impacts on customization perception.
