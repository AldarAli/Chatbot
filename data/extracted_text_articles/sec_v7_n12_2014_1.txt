Abstract—Crime and feeling of security are omnipresent and
can be inﬂuenced by lighting conditions. However, lighting
improvements are generally concentrated on street lighting.
Meanwhile,
a
vast
variety
of
new
technologies,
including
innovative lighting systems and connected mobility, are entering
into the automotive ﬁeld. Hence, opportunities are not limited
only to provide trafﬁc improvements, entertainment features
or driver assistance functions but also measures to tackle
(vehicle-related) crime and to increase feeling of security. In this
paper, we suggest a security function, namely the cooperative
home light (CHL), which makes use of new technologies and has
the potential to tackle crime as well as to increase drivers’ feeling
of security. We also provide an overview of an implementation.
However, because of the underlying challenges, the main focus
of this paper is to assess the CHL. Therefore, we introduce our
three-steps approach consisting of a transfer of related work,
a customer survey and results from our proprietary simulation
environment in order to assess the CHL.
Keywords—Security functions; Tangibility of security;
Vehicle-to-X communication; Automotive lighting.
I. INTRODUCTION
Crime and fear of crime are omnipresent in our society,
provoke personal injury, economic losses and reduce quality
of
life.
Thereby,
vehicle-related
crime
is
a
worldwide
ongoing problem not respecting national borders and affecting
everyone. Criminals usually adjust their skills to stay ahead
of countermeasures. Therefore, continuous elaboration on
security measures is a priority to challenge criminals.
Considering security within the automotive ﬁeld, a lot of
resources and effort are invested in two ﬁelds. The ﬁrst
ﬁeld can be summarized to in-vehicle security, i.e., making
electronic control units secure. The second ﬁeld focuses
on securing Vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication. Security,
not only in the automotive ﬁeld, is essential and forms
the basis for reliable use cases. But the main drawback
of security is that it is not tangible, especially not for
customers. Therefore, the importance of security is mostly
not appreciated, and sometimes even neglected until security
measures get compromised.
Our
daily
life
is
increasingly
dominated
by
new
technologies. The vision of accident-free driving and the
guarantee of our mobility leads to an increasing number
of advanced driver assistance systems. Meanwhile, these
systems have also penetrated to mid and even low class
vehicles. Consequently, a multitude of sophisticated sensors
and actuators are available in a wide range of vehicles.
New technologies do not enter only into the automotive
ﬁeld but also into the consumer market at an even faster
pace. Especially, smartphones play a growing role in our
daily life and have become a constant companion. Thanks to
V2X communication, our society, including mobility, becomes
increasingly connected.
The aforementioned technologies are mainly used in
academia and industry to elaborate on use cases in three
categories considering the automotive ﬁeld. The ﬁrst category
of use cases aims at improving trafﬁc efﬁciency (e.g.,
reduce trafﬁc jams), and thus, enhancing customers travelling
experience and ecological friendliness. The second set of
use cases aims at providing the driver and passengers with
infotainment features. Reliable internet connection opens the
door for social networks or even movies in the vehicle.
Assistance functions form the last category, and are nowadays
the main reason for the increasing penetration of technologies
in the automotive ﬁeld. Besides assisting the driver while
driving, assistance functions mainly aim at reducing the
number of accidents as well as their impact. The elaboration
moves towards fully automated driving with zero accidents,
and consequently no fatality.
Until
now,
existing
countermeasures
dealing
with
vehicle-related crime are mostly concentrated on the vehicle
itself, and focus on physical target hardening. Therefore, they
neither involve other vehicles, occupants and infrastructure
nor do they make use of other sophisticated technologies.
To close the aforementioned gaps, we elaborate on a forth
category of use cases, namely automotive security functions,
which must not to be mixed up with safety functions. In our
opinion, new technologies also provide the potential to develop
use cases which ﬁght vehicle-related crime, increase drivers’
feeling of security as well as make security tangible, and thus,
visible to customers.
The
cooperative
home
light
(CHL)
is
one
possible
security function. The CHL combines the opportunities of
vehicles’ advanced lighting systems, V2X communication and
positioning technologies so that several vehicles cooperatively
light the surrounding. This way, the CHL aims at extending the
existing basic home light (BHL), which makes only use of the
own vehicle to light the surrounding. In [1], we have outlined
the idea for the CHL including a suggestion for effectiveness
evaluation based on a proprietary simulation environment.

In this paper, we propose a possible realization of the
CHL considering the underlying technologies. However, the
main focus of this paper is not on the development of the
CHL itself since, as we will see in the following sections,
the underlying technologies are being widely elaborated in
academia and industry. Instead, the main focus of this paper is
on the assessment of the BHL and CHL as security functions.
Therefore, we implemented a simulation environment, which
was presented in [1], as well as conducted a customer study
and made use of the opportunity to transfer related work. We
further assessed whether the CHL provides an improvement
of ﬁghting crime and increasing persons’ feeling of security
compared to the BHL. Additionally, customers’ satisfaction,
and thus, the tangibility of security was investigated.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section
II outlines the CHL including related work on the underlying
technologies. Section III shows the implementation of our
three-steps approach to assess the BHL and CHL. Section
IV presents results of the assessment. Finally, the paper is
concluded in Section V with open challenges for the CHL
function.
II. DESIGN OF THE COOPERATIVE HOME LIGHT
Most vehicle manufacturer provide a so called coming /
leaving home function, which is referred to in the remainder
of this paper as basic home light (BHL). Of course, the
functionality differs from manufacturer speciﬁc adjustments,
but the basic idea is similar. When leaving the car, e.g., coming
home, low beams, taillights and other available light sources
keep on lighting (during darkness) for a speciﬁed period of
time in order to light the driver the way “home”. The duration
can generally be adjusted by the vehicle owner. Referring to
the leaving home light, the aforementioned light sources start
lighting as soon as the driver remotely unlocks the vehicle.
The BHL has the drawback to be static. The lighting
duration can only be adjusted in the vehicle and is independent
of driver’s position. Hence, if the duration is to short, the
illumination turns off before the driver even reaches the
vehicle. Furthermore, the vehicle turns on all light sources
although some light sources are probably unnecessary since
the driver approaches the vehicle from one direction.
Our idea is to extend the existing BHL by the opportunities
of advanced sensors, sophisticated light systems and V2X
communication. We suggest to use the opportunity that low
beams can be moved vertically and horizontally to light
driver’s path to the vehicle, of course within the mechanical
constraints of the beams. Additionally, only light sources
directly inﬂuencing the illumination of the path are turned on
so that energy consumption is reduced.
To realize the CHL, a bidirectional communication between
the vehicle and a sophisticated key fob is assumed. The key
fob is a smart device, such as a smartkey or smartphone, and
must be in possession of the driver.
Furthermore, position estimation of the key relatively to
the vehicle is necessary. Thereby, it is irrelevant whether
the position is calculated by the key or by the vehicle

standardization [3]
since position data is continuously synchronized between
both participating partners via bidirectional communication.
The CHL is (de)activated similarly to the BHL, in case of
“leaving home” as soon as the doors are remotely unlocked.
Additionally, the two-way communication between the key
and the vehicle as well as the position estimation of the key
are triggered. The position of the key is updated at regular
intervals.
Due to physical and mechanical constraints, the own vehicle
is not always in a position to illuminate the path of the
driver. Therefore, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication
is used to include vehicles in the surrounding in order to
enhance the illumination of driver’s path. Since our vehicle
is continuously aware of driver’s position, it continuously
requests participating vehicles to help lighting.
In the following, we suggest the underlying technologies
and approaches needed for the realization of the CHL function.
A. Communication
To enable intelligent transport system (ITS) communication,
efforts have been undertaken in the United States, Europe
and Japan to establish a set of communication standards.
However, these standards are not fully harmonized yet.
Hence, we refer in the further course of this paper to the
standardization of the European Telecommunications Standard
Institute (ETSI) [2]. Figure 1 shows a simpliﬁed ETSI ITS
communication architecture [3]. To be able to participate in
ITS communication, ITS sub-systems need to implement an
ITS station which follows the suggested architecture. Thereby,
ITS sub-systems can be for example vehicle sub-systems or
personal sub-systems, such as smartphones.
The three lower middle entities in Figure 1 cover the
communication protocol stack. The security entity provides
security services to the communication stack, the management
entity
and
ITS-applications.
The
management
entity
is
responsible to manage the interaction between entities. Thus,
each ITS-application needs an application ID (AID), which
is used to verify the right to exist. Depending on the AID,
entire processes are accordingly managed by the management

entity within the stack. A registration authority is aimed to be
established where each ITS-application needs to be registered
and certiﬁed in order to receive an AID and to be considered
in the communication [4], [5]. Consequently, the CHL has also
to go through the registration process to become part of the
ITS communication.
The architecture and the standardization process are still
in progress, but the basis for V2V and Vehicle-to-Device
(V2D) communication is deﬁned and security mechanisms are
considered.
1) V2D
communication:
We
suggest
the
use
of
a
smartphone or a smart key as mobile device. The essential
requirement is to support an ITS station. Since the key
only communicates with the own vehicle, the common
IEEE 802.11a/b/g [6] standard is mostly suitable. The
majority of smartphones is equipped with the necessary
hardware. Also today’s vehicles are equipped at times with
hardware to support WiFi hotspots. Further, the access
layer in the communication architecture [3] considers WiFi
communication so that the basis for V2D communication is
given.
2) V2V communication: In the course of the introduction
of V2V communication into the market, vehicles will be
equipped with onboard communication units (OCUs) to
support V2V communication. Thereby, V2V communication
is based on IEEE 802.11p according to [3]. To tackle the
challenge of communication with other vehicles in order to
support the cooperative lighting, we suggest two approaches.
• Basic approach: The host vehicle, which asks for
lighting support, continuously broadcasts a message with
the driver position, while other vehicles do not reply.
This way the communication load is reduced and other
vehicles do not reveal any information, such as position
or lighting capabilities. However, the host vehicle is not
able to control the scenario so that redundant lighting
may occur and the host vehicle is uncertain whether the
way is sufﬁciently lighted.
• Sophisticated
approach: The host vehicle requests
lighting support and willing vehicles reply by providing
the host vehicle with their position information and
lighting capabilities. This way, the host vehicle is
able
to
create
a
map
including
the
surrounding
vehicles and to coordinate the lighting process by
asking only relevant vehicles considering their lighting
capabilities. Of course, this approach comes along with
additional communication load and other vehicles need
to reveal information, such as their position and lighting
capabilities. However, the beneﬁt is a more efﬁcient and
managed lighting process.
Independent of the cooperative lighting approach, the
standardization
process
is
mainly
driven
by
the
goal
of
introducing
assistance
applications
as
day
one
use
cases. Therefore, ETSI deﬁned two message types, the
decentralized environmental notiﬁcation message (DENM)
[7] and cooperative awareness message (CAM) [8]. DENMs
are event-triggered and transmitted to alert other users from
speciﬁc trafﬁc events. In contrast, the CAM is continuously
broadcasted with a maximum time interval of 1 sec and
minimum time interval of 100 ms to ITS stations located
within a single hop distance to provide information of
presence, position and other ITS station speciﬁc data.
This way, ITS stations are aware of other stations in the
neighborhood. Considering the sophisticated approach, CAM
and DENM are not suitable to realize the CHL because not
intended for bidirectional communication. So, implementing
a tailored message type which supports the CHL is the most
reasonable solution. However, considering the basic approach,
the use of the CAM is suitable. The CAM is continuously
broadcasted, contains necessary information, such as vehicle
position, and provides the opportunity to be extended by
optional containers including further data, such as driver
position.
B. Positioning
First of all, the driver position, i.e., driver’s position
relative to the own vehicle, forms a fundamental part
of the CHL. Additionally, each vehicle participating in
cooperative lighting needs to be aware of its position. Thereby,
a distinction between indoor and outdoor positioning is
reasonable. Outdoors, a fallback to the Global Positioning
System (GPS), where the precision varies depending on the
surrounding conditions, is the ﬁrst approach. Most vehicles
and smartphones are equipped with appropriate GPS receivers.
However, indoors (e.g., in parking facilities), GPS is not
suitable because requires a clear line-of-sight to orbital
satellites. Hence, additional solutions, which come along with
the integration of an additional infrastructure, are needed.
1) Driver positioning:
To overcome the lack of GPS
indoors, ultra-wideband (UWB) and wireless LAN (WLAN)
technologies are possible candidates. In the UWB approach,
the token, which is in our case the smartphone, estimates
the position based on the time difference of arrival (TDOA).
Hence, ideally the own vehicle is equipped with several
transceivers to estimate the position of the smartphone relative
to the vehicle. But, transceivers can also be mounted within
the facility. With the help of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
communication, the facility could provide the position to the
vehicle, which is able to recalculate driver’s position. Several
commercial solutions, such as Zebra’s Dart [9] or Ubisense
[10] exist and show the feasibility of this technology where
precisions below 1m are achievable.
In the WLAN approach, the position is estimated with the
help of the received signal strength. The feasibility has been
shown in research systems, such as Microsoft RADAR [11],
[12] and Horus [13], [14]. Ekahau [15] provides a commercial
solution based on a tracking-assistant positioning system
provided by Kontkanen et al. [16]. The WLAN technology
makes position precisions possible within the lower one-digit
meter range.
On the one hand, the UWB approach provides better
position precision and is preferably used for customer
products. On the other hand, this solution requires the

smartphone to be equipped with appropriate receiver hardware,
while all smartphones support WLAN technology.
We also found attempts to use smartphones with its
integrated sensors to estimate relative movements [17]–[19].
Hence,
data
fusion
of
relative
and
absolute
position
information has the potential to improve the overall position
estimation signiﬁcantly, independent on the technology for
absolute positioning.
2) Vehicle positioning: Considering the CHL, vehicles do
not move so that the position is stationary. Therefore, vehicles
need to be aware of their last estimated parking position.
Position estimation within facilities can be tackled similar to
the estimation of driver position, described above. We also
found other approaches in literature. Especially considering
autonomous parking, research projects such as AIM [20],
V-Charge [21] and Audi’s automated parking pilot [22] (partly)
address positioning challenges. In these projects, a similar
approach is used, where the parking facility is equipped with
sensors, such as LIDAR or cameras, in order to estimate
free parking spots. Further, entering vehicles are provided
with a digital map of the parking facility. Making use
of this information, vehicles autonomously drive to a free
parking spot, supported by on-board sensors, such as cameras,
ultra-sonic and radar sensors. Thus, a parked vehicle is aware
of its parking position within the facility.
C. Smart grids
A further challenge on the way towards the CHL is the
power supply of involved vehicles. Today’s common vehicles
possess a battery with limited lifetime posing a hurdle for the
CHL. However, electric mobility is attracting a lot of attention
and is pushed by academia, industry and governments. Hence,
smart grids, where electric vehicles (EVs) are connected
to, gain continuously in importance. In case of an excess
production of energy, especially due to renewable sources,
vehicles are intended to be used as temporary energy storage.
So, considering the introduction of EVs into the mass market,
the involvement of EVs into the power grid seems to become
indispensable.
The project E-Energy [23] showed the potential and future
challenges of smart grids. Additionally, the solution will tend
toward small and especially local smart grids fulﬁlling and
ﬁtting to local requirements. The follow-up research project,
INEES [24], [25] has recently started to continue the research
work on smart grids involving EVs.
D. Lighting
Depending
on
the
equipment
level,
vehicles
usually
possess at least the mandatory lighting systems for outside
illumination, which are mandatory by according laws and
inter alia regulated by the UNECE regulations [26]. They
form a framework for technological requirements of vehicles,
including lighting, and are accepted in the European Union
and further countries.

beam assistants, which detect incoming trafﬁc and adjust
beams accordingly, actively intervene with the vehicle’s
lighting
system.
Additionally,
lighting
systems
underlie
a steady development so that incandescent systems are
continuously replaced by LED systems, partly in combination
with xenon lights [27]. Researchers, such as H¨orter et al. [28],
even work on assistance systems for rural roads which make
use of the opportunity of moveable lights to precisely position
a light spot on persons and animals on the road(side), and thus
make them earlier visible to the driver. Hence, vehicles are
and will be increasingly equipped with sophisticated lighting
systems.
We suggest to use the light sources depicted in Figure 2 to
realize the CHL. The vehicle surrounding is divided into eight
areas, numbered with I to V III. Depending on the driver
position in the area, speciﬁed light sources are turned on. Table
I summarizes the dependency of light sources and area.
Additionally to simply turn lights on or off, the capability
to move low beams in the vertical as well as horizontal pane
improves the CHL. Since the driver is moving, low beams are
permanently aligned in the direction of the driver within the
mechanical constraints.

1) Horizontal beam movement: Horizontal beam movement
is mainly driven by the dynamic cornering light which is
intended to be used in rural areas or on highways while driving
through corners at higher speed. Low beams are actively
moved horizontally into the corner with a maximum angle
of commonly 15 degrees [29]. Beams are usually controlled
via electromotive actuators so that the mechanism to move
low beams is integrated in vehicles with the aforementioned
assistance system.
2) Vertical beam movement: To avoid dazzling incoming
trafﬁc, manual level adjustment exists besides the more
sophisticated static and even dynamic automatic leveling. The
static leveling system automatically adjusts the level dependent
on vehicle loading. Dynamic systems additionally take into
account vehicle’s acceleration and deceleration to adjust the
tilt angle dynamically. Hence, actuators to adjust vertical beam
movement are widely spread in vehicles as well.
III. ASSESSMENT IMPLEMENTATION
To assess the potential of the CHL, we propose a three-steps
assessment. In the ﬁrst step, research work is necessary to
identify comparable functions or countermeasures, which were
already evaluated and consequently provide evaluation results.
These results are transferred under our evaluation conditions
and provide a ﬁrst direction of possible behavior of our
security function. In the second step, a survey is conducted in
order to ﬁnd out test persons’ valuation whether the function is
effective to combat the intended crime as well as reasonable to
increase feeling of security. Thereby, test persons experience
the function but there are no violent or threatening attacks. The
survey further covers acceptance and usability issues related
to the potential security function. Knowledge about users’
attitude towards a security function is a factor of success.
No matter how effective a security function might be, a
security function with user handicaps will deter users from
making use of it and make the function useless, and thus
ineffective. The third step arises from engineering demands
being able to measure effectiveness, for example by making
use of simulations. Consequently, we simulate our security
function and propose metrics to evaluate the effectiveness.
A. Transfer of research work
Surveying the literature, we have not found any approaches
realizing a similar function as the CHL, and thus, no
immediate evaluation results exist. But, there has been a lot of
research on the inﬂuence of lighting, especially street lighting,
on crime and the fear of crime in the last decades. We
think that transferring these results, which are presented in
Section IV-A, provides a ﬁrst glance on the effectiveness and
success of making use of vehicles to cooperatively light the
surrounding.
B. Customer survey
We designed our own supervised one-to-one interview. We
pursue three goals with our survey:

1) Estimate whether the CHL is seen as effective to combat
robberies and assaults while going to or from the vehicle.
2) Gather subjects valuation about the effectiveness of the
CHL to reduce the fear of falling victim to a robbery or
an assault.
3) Estimate
the
user
acceptance
of
the
CHL
from
consumer’s point of view.
In the following, we introduce the survey design and concept,
explain our choice of subjects, show the survey procedure as
well as provide an overview of our analysis approach.
1) Survey design and concept: The experiment is structured
in three parts. The ﬁrst part contains sociodemographic
questions to gain deeper information about the subject.
Additionally, we use this part to ask questions about the
technical afﬁnity of subjects. We assume that gender, age and
subjects who rate themselves to have a high technical afﬁnity
inﬂuence the evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce assistance
systems and technologies which provide the basis for the CHL.
This is important for the further understanding and evaluation
of the CHL as well as to get all subjects on a similar level of
knowledge.
The second part ﬁnally tackles the assessment of the CHL.
Thereby, the questionnaire contains questions to cover the
following three constructs:
• Effectiveness of ﬁghting crime
• Effectiveness of increasing feeling of security
• User acceptance
Questions are answered on a ﬁve-point Likert scale with
according labeling. To get more granularity, we further
subdivide each category of the ﬁve-point Likert scale into
three parts. Consequently, we have an overall answer depth
of 15 possible answers. Table II shows an example of a 5x3
Likert scale in order to rate the importance. Using predeﬁned
questions with a judgement scale (Likert scale) facilitates the
evaluation of a questionnaire but the subject is eventually
pushed into a speciﬁc pattern.
Therefore, the third part provides comment ﬁelds in order
to provide the opportunity to freely comment on the beneﬁts,
drawbacks and also general feedback coming along with the
CHL. Additionally, the examiner documents questions and
remarks arising during the survey.
In order that the subject experiences the CHL, we decided to
implement in cooperation with the Volkswagen AG department
for visual communication a real world animation of one
speciﬁc scenario making the CHL tangible for subjects.
Thereby, we chose to model a parking garage with several
parking cars. The animation is made from the ﬁrst person view
where the car owner uses a smartphone to unlock the car, and

Fig. 3. Screenshots from the CHL animation
thus, starts the CHL. Figure 3 illustrates some pictures of the
animation. We further implemented two additional animations
in the identical surrounding and identical car owners path to
the car. One animation includes no function and the other
the BHL. The animation without any function is used to get
subjects familiar with the surrounding and the walking path in
the animation. The animation of the BHL is necessary since we
aim at comparing the constructs crime ﬁghting and increasing
feeling of security between the BHL and CHL, i.e., we want to
estimate whether the CHL provides an improvement compared
to the BHL. Therefore, our questionnaire contains similar
questions evaluating the effectiveness of ﬁghting crime and
increasing feeling of security for the CHL as well as the BHL.
2) Subjects: To recruit subjects, we made use of an internal
test person database from Volkswagen, which contains test
persons in a lower four-digit range. These test persons are
Volkswagen employees covering most areas of operations.
With the help of them, surveys or studies are conducted to
rate ideas and gain ﬁrst trends. All test persons are voluntarily
registered in the database. Furthermore, all data is treated
conﬁdential so that a conclusion on the identity of a certain
person is impossible. This anonymity and a detailed instruction
of test persons support an independent survey.
To estimate an appropriate sample size, which satisﬁes on
TABLE IV

the one hand our resources, such as time and money, and on
the other hand is large enough to provide reasonable results,
we conducted an a priori power analysis. Thereby, we made
use of a power analysis program for statistical tests, G-Power
[30]. According to Cohen [31], the sample size N is calculated
dependent on the required power level (1 − β), a previously
speciﬁed signiﬁcance level (α) as well as the population effect
size (d).
The main purpose of the survey is to estimate whether
the CHL provides an improvement compared to the BHL.
Consequently, each subject has to rate both functions and we
have matched pairs, i.e., dependent groups. Since we test for
improvement, an one-sided tail is chosen. Further, we decided
to chose a signiﬁcance level of α = 0.05 and power of
1 − β = 0.95 , which are common levels in social sciences.
With these settings, we compute a required sample size of 47
participants, which satisﬁes our resources and detects effects
of medium size (d = 0.5).
Furthermore, we aim at testing for differences considering
gender and age. We have the opportunity to control these
attributes while inviting subjects. Therefore, we want to
have equal groups considering both, gender and age. Testing
for differences between males and females as well as
between young and old participants implies two independent
groups. Further, we focus on one-sided testing and taking a
signiﬁcance level of α = 0.05, as well. Taking a power of
1 − β = 0.95 and a medium effect size (d = 0.5) would
require a total sample size of 184 subjects, i.e., 92 participants
per group. This is beyond our resources so that we decided
for a power of 1 − β = 0.8 and a smaller effect size, d = 0.8.
According to [31], a type 2 error being four times α, i.e.,
β = 0.2, is still reasonable and we detect at least small effects.
Taking these values for calculation, we need a total sample size
of at least 42 participants (21 per group).
Table III summarizes our beforehand described settings for
G-Power to calculate an appropriate sample size. In a nutshell,
to be on the safe side but satisfy our resources, we decided to
invite 56 subjects for the survey. Thereby, these subjects were
equally divided considering gender and age, as can be seen
from Table IV.
3) Procedure: We decided to take an experienced examiner
who conducts the survey. First of all, an experienced examiner
is trained to conduct surveys. Second, the examiner has an
open mind, that means, he is not involved in the topic
of security functions. Consequently, (indirect) inﬂuence on
subjects during the survey is minimized.
We deeply introduced the examiner into the survey and
conducted several test runs. Although, we do not participate

during the survey, the examiner and subjects had always the
opportunity to contact us in person to solve arising questions.
A further beneﬁt of conducting an interviewed survey is
that subjects have always the opportunity to ask questions.
Furthermore, the examiner has the opportunity to take care
of a completely ﬁlled questionnaire, respectively. This is very
important to achieve our predeﬁned number of subjects to be
able to conduct our statistical tests. The survey is conducted in
a separate room to avoid distraction. Thereby, each experiment
is conducted successively with one subject. So, the entire
survey took about two weeks. The room could be darkened
and was equipped with an 42 inch LCD-TV.
Each experiment started with editing the sociodemographic
questions by the subject and showing the animation without
function to the subject. To show subjects the animation,
our ﬁrst approach was to use an off-the-shelf head-mounted
display or video glasses to create a feeling of virtual reality.
But, after having discussed with experts within our company
and surveyed technical magazines [32]–[34], which tested
head-mounted displays and video glasses, we decided against
the use of such a device. In our animation, the car owner
walks on a static path to the car and we do not consider any
interaction, such as head movement. Hence the immersion into
virtual reality is limited to the visual experience. Especially
off-the-shelf head-mounted displays do not really convey the
feeling of being within the scene due to limited display
properties. Small resolutions as well as small angles of view
even partly convey the impression to stay close in front of
a ﬂat screen. An additional drawback is cybersickness [35].
Eyes observe movement although the subject stands still. This
contradictory information to sensory organs often leads to
sickness. Consequently, we decided to show the animation in
our darkened room on the 42 inch LCD-TV.
Next, subjects evaluated the BHL and CHL. Since, the CHL
is the more sophisticated function, evaluating the CHL after
the BHL may lead to biased results. Therefore, we divided our
subjects equally in two groups, A and B. Group A evaluated
the BHL ﬁrst followed by the CHL. In contrast, group B
evaluated the CHL ﬁrst. The procedure to evaluate a function
consists of three steps. First, the examiner brieﬂy introduces
the function. Second, the according animation is shown to the
subject. Third, the subject edits the according questions in the
questionnaire. Figure 4 shows the detailed procedure for both

4) Analysis: We have several items (i.e., questions) to
measure the same construct, for example fear of crime.
Hence, we have to combine data from related items. To test
whether several items propose to measure the same construct,
we calculate Cronbach’s alpha, the coefﬁcient of internal
consistency. The value varies from zero to 1 where a value
of 1 shows total reliability between the according items.
However, very high reliabilities, such as 0.95 and higher,
indicate that items are eventually redundant [36]. To estimate
whether related items are reliable, Nunnally and Bernstein [37]
recommend a value between 0.7 to 0.8 for basic research.
According to [38], a well-accepted value for Cronbach’s alpha
is between 0.70 and 0.90. Also Ferreira and Palhares [39]
suggest a value higher than 0.7 although references exist
accepting values lower than 0.7. So, in our opinion an alpha

2014, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
Fig. 5. Simulation environment to simulate the CHL
value between 0.7 and 0.95 is a suitable choice to estimate
reliability as well as eventual redundancy between items.
C. Simulation environment
We deﬁne the duration of the driver in a lighted surrounding
as a measurable criterion. The CHL is classiﬁed as effective,
in terms of reducing crime as well as increasing feeling
of security, when the driver is in a lighted surrounding.
Thereby, the improvement compared the the BHL considering
the number of participating vehicles is of interest. In other
words, driver’s duration in a lighted surrounding dependent
on the penetration rate of vehicles participating in V2V
communication is our measurement criterion. Thus, we need
a simulation environment which enables us to model freely
different parking constellations with an adjustable number
of vehicles participating in communication. Additionally, we
need to be able to model drivers path to or from the vehicle
and to conﬁgure the lighting capabilities of vehicles. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no simulation environment
supporting a simulation of our security function. Consequently,
we decided to implement a proprietary simulation environment
[1], [40], which is illustrated in Figure 5, to be able to model
diverse parking constellations, and thus, evaluate the CHL. As
can be seen, the simulation environment is implemented in
two dimensions, that means from bird’s eye view.
1) Parking Constellations: The number of possible parking
constellations is inﬁnite since the driver’s path can be
manifoldly modeled and vehicles can be positioned in different
ways. Therefore, we provide in our simulation environment the
opportunity to load a background image from Google maps
[41] or Bing maps [42], for example. Thereby, the background
image is scaled to ﬁt into our simulation environment. Hence,
we have the opportunity to add, i.e., overlay, and freely
position vehicles at positions where vehicles are parked when
the picture was taken. Furthermore, we can insert rectangle
obstacles, such as walls, and circular obstacles, such as trees.
Regarding parking constellations up to areas of 100m x 100m
is in our opinion a reasonable approach since typical remote
keys and low beams work nearly up to this distance.
2) Vehicles: Each vehicle has a set of light sources which
can be used to light the environment. Light sources are limited
to the light sources shown in Figure 2. Each vehicle can be
conﬁgured separately so that vehicles with different equipment
levels can be simulated. However, for reasons of simpliﬁcation,
all vehicles are equally equipped. Furthermore, we provide

9
International Journal on Advances in Security, vol 7 no 1 & 2, year 2014, http://www.iariajournals.org/security/
2014, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
four types of vehicles in order to ﬁt the vehicle class from the
real parking constellation. We consider only passenger cars,
namely low, mid and high class cars as well as sport utility
vehicles (SUVs).
3) Lighting and shadowing: Lighting is approximated by a
surface created with the help of a polygon. Thereby, the lighted
area can be adjusted for each vehicle separately. However,
we equip each vehicle with equal lighted areas according to
Figure 2 in order to limit the frame of inﬂuencing simulation
factors. This implies that all vehicles are equipped with the
same lighting technologies. Furthermore, we implemented in
our simulation a ray tracing approach to consider shadowing
effects.
4) Driver’s Path: Driver’s path is modeled via waypoints,
which are freely inserted in the simulation environment and
serve as anchors. The path is linearly interpolated between
these waypoints. A polynomial interpolation was discarded
due the tendency for oscillation [43]. The driver does not move
from one waypoint to the next. Instead, the driver moves along
the trajectories between waypoints by covering a distance
calculated from the adjustable walking speed as well as the
adjustable simulation resolution. Thereby, we use a walking
speed of 1m/s and a simulation resolution of 10ms.
5) Communication: The propagation of electromagnetic
waves highly varies affected by many inﬂuencing factors. For
example, Kwoczek et al. [44] investigated the inﬂuence of
roof curvature, roof racks and panorama glass roofs on the
antenna gain in the reserved V2V communication frequency
band and found inter alia a high loss of gain caused by glass
roof. Additionally, packet collision and channel congestion
inﬂuence communication. Hence, it is highly challenging to
consider and simulate all inﬂuencing factors. We implemented
a communication manager within our simulation environment,
which can be extended by communication models, when
necessary. However, we assume no message collision, all
vehicles being within communication range, and all messages
being correctly received. We consider the basic approach of
the CHL where only the host vehicle broadcasts messages
to reduce communication load. According to [45], the deﬁned
transmission power enables a theoretical communication range
up to 1000m, and we target to regard simulation areas with
a maximum size of 100m x 100m. Further, we consider only
parked vehicles so that effects due to moving objects can be
neglected as well.
IV. RESULTS
A. Transfer results
The inﬂuence of lighting, especially street lighting, on crime
and the fear of crime has been researched widely in literature.
On behalf of the US Department of Justice, Tien et al. [46]
analyzed over 100 projects and deeply evaluated the results of
15 projects. In 1979, they concluded that improved lighting
neither changes the occurrence of crime nor leads to an
increase of crime, concerning offenses such as robbery, assault,
burglary, car theft and larceny.
Ramsay and Newton [47] suggested on the basis of research
made in the years before 1991 that light improvements indeed
tend to have a positive inﬂuence on the feeling of security but
not crime itself.
According to [48], where street lighting evaluations were
reviewed having been conducted mainly in the 1990s,
increased street lighting leads to crime reduction when
measures are precisely targeted. Moreover, referring to newer
U.K. research results, more general measures seem to have a
crime prevention effect whereas the effect is strongly limited
referring to older and U.S. research.
In 2002, Farrington and Welsh [49] evaluated the results
of U.S. and British studies for the British Home Ofﬁce
[50] from former decades to estimate the effectiveness of
street lighting on crime. They prepared an update [51] for
the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention [52] in
2007 and concluded that the improvement of street lighting
reduces crime signiﬁcantly and seems to have no negative
effect providing beneﬁts for law-abiding citizens.
In a nutshell, the research on the effect of lighting on crime
has provided equivocal results. However, a positive inﬂuence
on the feeling of security is generally assumed. The interested
reader can ﬁnd further information and results on the effect of
lighting on crime and on the feeling of security in [53], [54].
B. Survey results
1) Effectiveness
of
ﬁghting
crime:
To
estimate
the
effectiveness of ﬁghting crime, subjects answered two equal
items referring to the BHL and CHL on the 5x3 Likert scale
ranging from not suitable at all to very suitable. The ﬁrst item
asked subjects to rate the suitability of the BHL / CHL to deter
a potential attacker from attacking the driver during the way
to the car. Second, the suitability of the BHL / CHL to reduce
robberies and attacks against the driver during the way to the
car was rated. Since Cronbach’s alpha is for the BHL 0.85
and the CHL 0.95, the items can be combined accordingly to
represent the construct effectiveness of crime ﬁghting.
Regarding the statistical test results, the CHL is rated
to be signiﬁcantly more effective to ﬁght crime than the
BHL (p-value: 3.70e-10). Thereby, there is also no difference
between group A and B, i.e., both groups show a signiﬁcant
result as well. Figure 6 shows the distribution of the suitability
to ﬁght crime. The mean of the BHL 8.0 (sd: 2.7) is
signiﬁcantly smaller than the mean of the CHL 10.9 (sd: 2.4).
Furthermore, we also tested for inﬂuence of gender, age and
technical afﬁnity. All p-values are above a signiﬁcance level
of 0.05. Thus, there is no evidence that females think that the
BHL as well as the CHL is more effective than males. Our
older subjects rate none of the function to be more effective
either. Lastly, subjects being more technically afﬁne follow
the aforementioned trend, i.e., there is no difference between
technically afﬁne and not technically afﬁne subjects.
2) Effectiveness of increasing feeling of security: Subjects
rated the suitability of the BHL and CHL by editing two items
on our 5x3 Likert scale ranging from not suitable at all to very
suitable. On the one hand, items asked to rate the suitability

CHL
Fig. 7. Suitability to increase feeling of security
to reduce the fear of crime from assaults and robberies during
the way to the car, and, on the other hand, the suitability
to increase the feeling of security during the way to the car.
Cronbach’s alpha between both items is for the BHL 0.90
and for the CHL 0.92. Thus, we can combine both items to
represent the construct effectiveness of increasing feeling of
security for the BHL as well as CHL.
The hypotheses test, which intends to research whether the
CHL is more effective than the BHL in increasing the feeling
of security, shows a p-value (1.09e-08) smaller than 0.05 so
that we accept the alternative hypotheses. Consequently, the
CHL is signiﬁcantly seen by our subjects to be more effective
than the BHL. The distribution of the suitability is depicted in
Figure 7 where the mean for the BHL is 8.9 (sd: 2.9) and for
the CHL 11.6 (sd: 2.4). Considering group A and B separately,
the CHL is also rated to be more effective than the BHL in
both groups. So, no matter if the BHL or the CHL was rated
ﬁrst, the CHL is signiﬁcantly seen to be more effective.
Furthermore, neither the gender and age nor the technical
afﬁnity inﬂuence the effect of the BHL and CHL on feeling
of security.
Considering the overall results, the CHL in generally
evaluated more effective to increase feeling of security.
However, we did not identify any stereotypes considering
gender, age and technical afﬁnity.
3) User acceptance: To ﬁnd out more about the user
acceptance, we focus on two categories. The ﬁrst category
covers subjects’ willingness to provide their own car to light
the way to someone else. We use three questions each with a
5x3 Likert scale going from not willing at all to very willing.

Willingness for cooperative lighting
Fig. 8. Willingness to provide own car for cooperative lighting
First, we asked subjects to simply rate their willingness to
provide their car to others for cooperative lighting. As can be
seen in Figure 8(a), the willingness is indeed widely spread.
However, there is more or less a tendency to be willing to
support cooperative lighting. A few questions later, we asked
our subjects again to rate their willingness. But, this time we
arranged an explanation in front of the question explaining
that there is an energy management avoiding a complete
discharge of the battery so that the car can still be started.
We additionally point out that battery life time is reduced due
to more load cycles, and thus, leading to an earlier battery
exchange. According to the results shown in Figure 8(b),
the willingness decreased. Conducting a statistical test, the
decrease is signiﬁcant (p-value=0.00345). The third question is
asked subsequently. This time, we point out that light sources
are increasingly switched on and off. This leads to a decreasing
life time, and thus, to an earlier exchange of light sources.
Figure 8(c) shows the according results, which decreased again
compared to the second question (p-value=0.00536).
Summing up, it seems that subjects generally slightly tend
to provide their car for cooperative lighting since they see a
beneﬁt. But, the enthusiasm in the beginning decreased with
the clariﬁcation of possible (economical) drawbacks.
The second category covers the maximal surcharge subjects
are willing to pay for the CHL. Therefore, we asked our
subjects to mark the maximal surcharge on a number line
ranging from 0e to 1000e they were willing to pay for the
CHL. Figure 9 shows the result where the surcharge is shown
related to the according subject ID.
We have few subjects that of course are not willing to pay
anything and vice versa a few subjects who are willing to pay

Maximal surcharge for CHL
Fig. 9. Willingness for maximal surcharge of the cooperative home light
far above the average amount of 244e. However, the majority
ranges between 100e and 300e. Hence, since subjects marked
the maximal amount, a customer price of around 200e seems
to be acceptable for the majority. However, a car manufacturer
and supplier need to manage a realization far below the
estimated customer price. So, a realization based on existing
hardware components seems to be unavoidable to keep the
surcharge low.
4) Subjects feedback: Several subjects state that they like
to make use of the BHL, especially in order to ﬁnd their car.
One subject added that after having ﬁnished work and going
to his car, which is parked at the parking area in front of the
company with thousands of further cars from the same make
and even model, the BHL is ideal to identify his car in the
mass. So, subjects mainly think of the BHL at the ﬁrst glance
as a car ﬁnder. Nevertheless, some subjects admitted to feel
more comfortable due to the lighted surrounding by the BHL.
But, they did not think about it immediately since this has
become kind of natural.
Furthermore, some subjects unlock the car ﬁrst when the
car is in their range of sight. They are afraid of pointing
by the light the unlocked car to a potential attacker. Further,
since the doors are immediately unlocked the attacker can
enter the car before the subject arrives. Hence, an additional
button on the remote control or additionally pressing the same
button is suggested to unlock the doors. The lighted car shows
a potential attacker that the car owner is approaching and
consequently hands the victim to the attacker on a silver
platter. This way the attacker knows where to wait.
Some subjects criticized the CHL complicating to ﬁnd the
own car due to the fact that several cars are switching on
their lights. Thus, the own car needs a unique lighting, e.g., a
unique interior lighting (color). Additionally, subjects worry
that the CHL leads to confusion, especially when several
persons make use of the CHL. One subject was afraid that
handling the challenge with several users needs additional
exchange of (position) data. The multitude of light sources
creates a lot of shadows which also might be irritating. Hence,
the desired effect gets lost. One subject also mentioned that the
light of other cars irritates since it is unknown whether the car
switched the lights on because of the CHL or someone really
started the car and wants to leave the parking lot.
Path 1
Path 3
Path 2
Fig. 10. Parking constellation with driver’s paths
Considering the CHL, most subjects are also concerned
about additional costs due to shortened lifetime of battery
and light sources. Associated with this, subjects doubt the
willingness of providing the car for cooperative lighting,
especially when there is no beneﬁt. They also mention the
chicken-egg-problem, i.e., the necessity to have an acceptable
amount of cars supporting the CHL but ﬁrst users will not
really beneﬁt since the penetration rate is too low. However,
two subjects also stated not taking care about the additional
abuse and offering their car for cooperative lighting as long
as they have a leased car which is driven only a short period
of time before being returned.
Further, the parking garage is not considered as the main
place where the CHL unfolds its main potential and beneﬁt
since a parking garage is generally lighted. Even if some light
sources are out of order there is still enough light. The main
use is seen on side roads with insufﬁcient illumination, streets
with lamps hidden by treetops or other dark outdoor places
where no illumination is available or lights are shut down to
save money for example. One subject would like to connect
the CHL with his carport, his house and his wife’s car being
also in the driveway. Another subject thinks that the CHL
would unfold its potential rather in countries such as Mexico
and Brazil than in Germany.
The
compatibility
with
other
car
and
smartphone
manufacturers raises also concerns. A preference is noticeable
to use the key instead of the smartphone, also in order not to
have to many devices. But a smartphone or other device with
an appropriate display opportunity could be used to show
an availability map of participating vehicles within the CHL
network.
Both, the CHL and BHL are mainly seen as additional
comfort to feel more comfortable and to ﬁnd the own car
easier. The use of lighting to ﬁght crime and increase the
feeling of security seems to play only a secondary role.
C. Simulation results
We decided to take and model the parking constellation
depicted in Figure 10. It refers to a mixed parking constellation

Fig. 11. Driver’s duration in lighted surrounding dependent on the penetration rate of vehicles participating in communication
from Berlin. Thereby, mixed means that vehicles are parked
side by side, consecutively as well as even skewed. We
simulated three paths, each to a different vehicle as illustrated
in Figure 10. The starting point of the driver was equal for each
of the three simulation settings. The path to driver’s vehicle
was planned based on our personal assumption a driver would
take. However, we avoided equal paths since the lighting
behavior is obviously equal on equal paths.
Each path was simulated for the BHL and the CHL with
penetration rates of participating vehicles from 0% to 100%
in 10% steps. A penetration rate of 0% means that the CHL
behaves similarly to the BHL except making use of the
opportunity to move low beams into drivers direction and
turning on only necessary light sources. A penetration rate
of 100% means that all vehicles in the scenario participate in
lighting the path. The BHL as well as the CHL with 0% and
100% penetration rate are simulated once since they are clearly
deterministic. In contrast, the simulation of the CHL with
penetration rates from 10% to 90% was conducted 10 times
per penetration rate. Thereby, we randomly estimated in each
iteration vehicles which participate in the cooperative lighting
within the scenario. As can be seen in Figure 10, the driver
approaches the own vehicle from the front considering all three
paths. Since low beams and cornering lights are the mostly
meaningful light sources, we conducted the aforementioned
simulations with a driver vehicle being rotated by 180 degrees,
respectively.
Figure 11 summarizes the results where Figure 11a shows
the results for the original parking constellation and Figure
11b shows the results with a driver vehicle rotated by 180
degrees.
First of all, the CHL(0%) provides an improvement in
lighting when the driver approaches from the front. This way,
the CHL releases the potential to move low beams into the
direction of the driver. The inﬂuence of the own vehicle is
especially obvious in the lower penetration rates where other
vehicles are not always able to replace the missing lighting of
the low beams when the driver approaches from behind.
Furthermore, up to a penetration rate of 50%, the average
duration constantly increases nearly up to 80%. Hence, on
average an acceptable lighting coverage is achieved with 50%
of vehicles. However, the standard deviation is approximately
20% considering penetration rates smaller than 50%. This
shows that the parking position of participating vehicles highly
inﬂuences the duration of the driver in a lighted surrounding.
This is not surprising. In worst case, none of the vehicles
participating in communication are in lighting range, and thus,
have no inﬂuence on lighting the surrounding.
From penetration rates of 60%, the average duration
increases only slightly up to a duration of 90% in a lighted
surrounding and the standard deviation decreases. That means,
high penetration rates do not necessarily provide much

higher lighting durations. But, they provide lower variations.
Moreover, a saturation is achieved by 90% of lighting duration.
Based on our simulation results, a penetration rate of 50%
of participating vehicles is the most reasonable trade off
providing a high duration in a lighted surrounding with low
variations.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we proposed a security function, namely the
cooperative home light (CHL), and showed the underlying
technologies for implementation. To assess the CHL, we
proposed a three-steps approach, which consists of analyzing
related work, conducting customer surveys and deﬁning
measurable criteria to conduct simulations. We applied
this three-steps approach to the CHL and presented the
implementation and the results. Thereby, surveying the
literature and analyzing the inﬂuence of lighting on crime
and feeling of security, we found equivocal results. A
positive effect on reducing crime was neither conﬁrmed nor
rejected. However, the majority conﬁrmed a positive effect
on the feeling of security. Moreover, our survey showed an
improvement of the CHL compared to the BHL, tackling both,
crime and feeling of security. However, it also became obvious
that the CHL is primarily not seen as a security function.
Instead, the convenience was highlighted by subjects. Hence,
the feasibility of the CHL to make security tangible for the
customer remains questionable. The simulation results showed
that cooperative lighting increases driver’s duration in a lighted
surrounding. A reasonable penetration rate of connected
vehicles participating in lighting the path was estimated to be
50%. Lower penetration rates suffer from variations dependent
on parking positions of connected vehicles. In contrast, higher
penetration rates provide only slight improvements.
In our future work, we will focus on two directions. First,
we will continue our work on evaluating the CHL. We
will simulate further typical parking constellations, such as
consecutively parked vehicles on public streets and side by
side parked vehicles on parking areas. However, our work
made also clear that a real world implementation of the
CHL is unavoidable to gain deeper insights whether the CHL
reduces crime or eventually even leads to abuse, and thus,
encourages crime. Therefore, detailed long-term statistical
data is necessary. While recording robberies and attacks, a
distinction needs to be made whether these crimes were
conducted on the way to/from a vehicle or not. Further,
information about vehicle’s equipment level needs to be known
and whether the driver made use of the BHL or CHL.
However, our vehicle-related crime analysis [55], which is
partly based on statistics, has shown that actual statistical data
do not provide the necessary granularity to assess the CHL.
Second, we will apply our three-steps approach to assess a
further security function, namely the electronic decal [56].
This way, we will be able to compare results with the CHL,
and additionally gain deeper understanding about the potential
of security functions to ﬁght crime, increase feeling of security
and make security tangible for customers.
