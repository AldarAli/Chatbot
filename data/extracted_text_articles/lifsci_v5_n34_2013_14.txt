Abstract—Patient’s compliance is crucial for the effectiveness 
of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment of 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Unfortunately, up to 50% of 
patients withdraw CPAP because of treatment side effects. 
Monitoring a patient’s CPAP compliance at home would be 
useful to early detect underuse and to properly address 
problems. 
Air

developed 
NOWAPI, 
a 
novel 
telemedicine system, which provides a remote monitoring of 
the CPAP treatment and is designed to be compatible with all 
CPAP devices under clinical use. The aim of this study was to 
validate this novel telemonitoring system in a bench test. 
NOWAPI detects important CPAP treatment efficiency 
parameters, such as the usage time and residual events, and 
sends them to a secure server, from which can be downloaded 
for analysis by the healthcare staff. In this study, NOWAPI 
was tested when using CPAP devices applied to a model 
simulating OSA patients. In a first test phase, to assess the 
influence of NOWAPI sensor unit geometry to the CPAP 
treatment, the responses of 2 different CPAP machines to a 
series of 10 disturbed breathing patterns with NOWAPI 
connected or not to the setting was compared. Then, the 
telemedicine system performance was tested in 30 simulated 
patients’ sleep periods of CPAP treatment, lasting 4 hours 
each. They consisted of disturbed breathing patterns built 
from selected events of real OSA patients’ polysomnographic 
recordings. The recorded data of each test were telemetrically 
sent to a server by the NOWAPI GPRS module, then 
downloaded and analyzed. The simulated patients were treated 
with 3 different currently available CPAP devices. NOWAPI 
sensor unit connection to the setting did not influence the 
CPAP treatment in the two CPAP devices analyzed. The 
difference between the treatment duration estimated by the 
device and actual values was never higher than 3 minutes over 
the 4-hour test. The absolute difference between the apnea-
hypopnea index estimated by NOWAPI and the actual values, 
0.9±1.6 events/hour (mean±SD), was not significantly different 
from the absolute difference between the AHI estimated by the 
CPAP machines and the actual values, 0.9±1.0 events/hour 
(p=0.171). NOWAPI showed an excellent performance in 
estimating the duration of the CPAP treatment and in 
detecting residual respiratory events in simulated OSAS 
patients. NOWAPI system could be a valuable tool for 
telemonitoring the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.

 INTRODUCTION 
The original version of this paper has been presented at 
eTELEMED 2013 conference, in Nice, France [1]. This 
extended version includes more detailed data across all paper 
sections. 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a very prevalent 
disease mainly associated with daytime sleepiness and 
deterioration of quality of life and is suffered by 2% to 4% of 
middle-aged adults [2]. OSA entails repetitive partial or total 
occlusion of the upper airway, which results in significant 
levels of sleep disturbance and snoring. However, the 
seriousness of untreated OSA is stressed by its significant 
consequences, including depression, ischemic heart disease, 
stroke, hypertension and significantly increased risk of motor 
vehicle crashes [3][4]. In addition, OSA is strongly related to 
obesity even though it is also increasingly identified in non-

obese subjects with a particular craniofacial structure. The 
incidence of OSAS is likely to grow in parallel with the 
spread of obesity now occurring in many countries. 
The treatment of choice for OSA is continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP) applied through a nasal mask during 
sleep. This constant pressure is transmitted to the pharyngeal 
area, thereby avoiding upper airway obstruction [5]. Despite 
the documented clinical efficacy of CPAP, up to 50% of 
patients suspend or underuse CPAP treatment, mainly due to 
its discomforting side effects, such as pressure intolerance, 
claustrophobic reaction to the mask, mask displacement, and 
machine noise [6][7]. Many of these problems could be 
easily solved by a closer follow-up, especially during the 
first weeks, but busy sleep centers have difficulties in giving 
such support. 
If patients do not use CPAP for the recommended 
minimum of 4 hours per night, clinical outcomes are 
compromised [8], demonstrating that adherence optimization 
is a critical aspect of patient management. 
Several studies confirmed that treatment compliance 
could be significantly improved by comprehensive support 
programmes and timely interventions by health professionals 
[9]. In recent times, it has been recognized that telemedicine 
could have a valuable role in improving CPAP therapy 
adherence [10]. In fact, telemedicine has been used in 
various studies to promote and reinforce CPAP treatment. In 
most of them a cognitive behavioural intervention was 
applied to OSA patients at home, by telephone, the Internet 
and videoconference. Namely, a randomized clinical trial 
showed that the use of a telephone-linked communication 
system, which provided feedback and counselling to OSAS 
patients at home, improved CPAP adherence, patients’ 
functional status and reduced depressive symptoms [7]. 
Another study employed an Internet-based informational 
support service for problems due to CPAP use [11]. Despite 
the organizational limitations and poor differences between 
intervention and control group follow-up, they obtained good 
patients’ acceptance of this monitoring strategy. It is also 
noteworthy that telehealth interventions, such as long-
distance visit via videoconference (or “televisits”), have been 
found to improve CPAP adherence in a small group of 
nonadherent patients versus a placebo-controlled group [12]. 
The cost of the interventions, including the telehealth 
monitor, home installation and telephone charges, was lower 
than the same number of face-to-face visits. However, larger 
studies are needed to generalize any conclusion. 
Although these previous studies achieved mixed results 
in terms of significant improvement of CPAP compliance, 
the potential of telemedicine as part of an integrated care for 
OSA patients was confirmed. 
Two recent randomized studies [13][14] combined 
elements of psycho-educational interventions together with 
technological innovation. Usual care was compared to a 
wireless telemonitoring of CPAP compliance and efficacy 
data, which physicians were able to daily monitor through a 
secure web browser and thus contact the patient if needed. 
Both studies resulted in higher CPAP adherence and 
improved OSA outcomes and demonstrated that continuous 
monitoring of patient’s compliance could be useful to early 
detect underuse and to properly address possible problems. 
Some existing CPAP and APAP (Automatic Positive 
Airway Pressure) devices monitor patient’s compliance by 
using different algorithms, but only few of them offer 
continuous remote monitoring. Air Liquide developed 
NOWAPI, a telemonitoring system designed to be 
compatible with all commercially available CPAP/APAP 
devices.  
The hypothesis of this study was that this new 
telemedicine system for CPAP therapy remote monitoring 
could provide valuable and useful data about treatment 
compliance and efficacy for the follow-up OSAS patients. 
The specific aims of this study were: a) to assess whether 
the connection of NOWAPI sensor unit to different 
CPAP/APAP machines influenced their normal functioning 
and responses to the disturbed breathing patterns generated 
by a simulated OSAS patient in a bench; b) to evaluate the 
NOWAPI’s performance in accurately detecting the 
CPAP/APAP treatment duration and the residual disturbed-
breathing events in a bench test.

METHODS 
A. System Description 
NOWAPI system has been designed to remotely monitor 
the CPAP or APAP treatment of patients with sleep apnea at 
home. The system overview is depicted in Fig. 1. NOWAPI 
comprises a small sensor unit (15x4x7 cm), shown in Fig. 2, 
powered by a rechargeable battery, which contains a pressure 
and flow sensing module, a specifically developed detection 
software for the analysis of the measured signals and 
detection the breathing events, a GPRS communication 
module, which enables data transmission to a server, and a 
clinical interface, which enables the physician to visualize 
and properly evaluate the data downloaded from the server. 
The NOWAPI sensors unit is connected between the

CPAP/APAP device outlet and the patient’s tubing. During 
the patient’s CPAP/APAP treatment, the system detects the 
pressure and flow signals, which characterize the patient’s 
breathing and estimates the treatment use rate and some 
important parameters to assess the effectiveness of the 
therapy, such as the number of apneas, hypopneas, flow 
limitations, snoring periods, and average breathing flow and 
nasal pressure. The system stores all data in 2 different files, 
a detailed file with a sampling rate of 25 Hz and a synthetic 
file where data are recorded as mean values over 15–minute 
consecutive periods. The latter file is sent by the GPRS 
module integrated into the device to a secure server then 
available to be downloaded and analyzed. 
Furthermore, a led in the sensors unit turns red if the 
treatment duration is less than the minimum standard of 4 
hours/night, giving an immediate useful feedback to the 
patient about his/her treatment compliance. 
 
B. Patterns of disturbed breathing 
NOWAPI was tested with 2 different sets of simulated 
breathing patterns. In the first phase, a series of 10 
waveforms consisting of the successive repetition of apneic 
or hypopneic events or persistent flow limitation with or 
without snoring [15][16] was used. For each flow pattern, the 
waveform generator (see Section C) produced a specific 
pattern of airway obstruction with the proper magnitude and 
duration for simultaneously mimicking the obstructive 
events and the flow shapes observed in OSA patients. The 
flow and obstructive events were combined for generating 10 
different breathing patterns. The description of these 
disturbed breathing patterns is summarized in Table I. Test 1 
simulated a breathing pattern with repetitive apneas with 
obstruction that correspond to the total airway occlusion. 
Test 2 simulated a breathing pattern known as central apnea, 
in which patients stop breathing due to brain's respiratory 
control centers imbalance, but no airway obstruction is 
present. Tests 3 and 4 reproduced two different severity 
levels of partial airway obstruction, called hypopnea. Test 5 
simulated a mild hypopnea with the addition of snoring 
vibrations synchronized with the inspirations.

the mouth. In Test 9 a signal mimicking the mask leaks was 
added to the repetitive obstructive apnea pattern. Test 10

simulated a breathing condition representative of a complete 
OSA patient breathing pattern that depended on the CPAP 
applied. Specifically, the generator reproduced apneas if 
CPAP was less than 5 cmH2O, severe hypopneas when 
applied CPAP was between 5 and 7 cmH2O, moderate 
hypopneas if CPAP was between 7 and 10 cmH2O, 
prolonged flow limitation when CPAP was between 10 and 
12 cmH2O, and normal breathing for CPAP greater than 12 
cmH2O. 
In the second phase, the system performance was tested 
in 30 different test scenarios especially developed for this 
study, simulating 30 sleep periods of OSA patients under 
CPAP treatment, lasting 4 hours each. In Table II the 30 
breathing patterns generated for this study are described in

detail. 
These simulated breathings consisted of realistic airflow 
patterns built from a library of actual events (e.g., normal 
breathing, apneas, hypopneas, flow limitations) selected 
from real OSA patients’ polysomnographic recordings. The 
selected events were exported by using the polygraph 
software with a sampling frequency of 64 Hz. Then, each 
event was properly elaborated by an algorithm implemented 
for this study. The block diagram describing the algorithm, 
developed by using Matlab computing tool, is shown in Fig. 
3. First, the flow event was integrated to obtain the volume 
signal. Then, the signal was detrended and adjusted in order 
to have the minimum signal point at zero. Then, to reproduce 
the typical tidal volumes for normal breathing (0.5 l approx.) 
and hypopnea (0.2 l approx), the signal gain was iteratively 
adjusted until the mean value of the signal peaks was 0.5 in 
the case of normal breathing and 0.2 in the case of hypopnea. 
Subsequently, the obstruction signal controlling the test 
bench valve was added to obstructive events. Moreover, a 
snore signal was added where requested. Then, the processed

events were assembled to obtain the 30 4-hour simulated 
breathing patterns (Fig. 4). In Fig. 5 some representative 
breathing patterns obtained by using the algorithm developed 
in this study are depicted. 
 
C. Measurement Setup and Protocol 
NOWAPI sensors unit was plugged between the 
CPAP/APAP device (or its humidifier) outlet and a model 
simulating an OSA patient [15][16], as shown in Fig. 6. This 
computer-driven model comprises a flow generator and an 
obstruction valve which allows the simulation of obstructive 
events. Other two valves (the leak and the exhalation valves) 
allow the simulation of leaks and mouth breathing and a 
loudspeaker simulates snoring. The test bench is equipped 
with two sensors, which record pressure and flow signals. A 
calibrated leak (EP on Fig. 6) simulates the mask leak. 
This validation study comprised two phases in which the 
same test setting (Fig. 6) was employed. 
 
1) First Test Phase 
The aim of the first test phase was to verify that the 
NOWAPI sensor unit connected between a CPAP/APAP 
machine and the conventional tubing connected to the patient 
did not modify the normal performance of the CPAP/APAP 
machine. Two commercially available CPAP/APAP devices 
(S9 AutoSet, Resmed and Remstar Auto, Respironics) were 
subjected to a set of 10 breathing patterns described 
elsewhere [15][16] with 2 alternative settings: with or 
without their Comfort Mode (CPR) activated and with or 
without NOWAPI sensors unit connected to the test setting. 
The responses obtained in the 4 different experimental 
conditions were compared and evaluated. 
 
2) Second Test Phase 
In the second test phase, NOWAPI was subjected to the 
30 patterns especially implemented for this study, which 
simulated 30 sleep periods of OSA patients under CPAP 
treatment. The aim of this phase was the assessment of 
NOWAPI’s performance in correctly detecting the treatment 
duration and the residual disturbed-breathing events.  
In order to assess the effect of water condensation into 
the tubing on the measurements, usually caused by patient’s 
breathing, three of the tests were performed with the APAP 
device humidifier turned on. To guarantee realistic water 
condensation, humidifier was set to maximum level and the 
APAP device tubing was immersed in ice. 
The simulated patients were treated with 3 different 
currently available devices for APAP treatment: S9 Autoset 
(Resmed), Remstar Auto PR1 (Respironics) and Goodknight 
420E (Sefam). Each APAP device was connected to the 
monitoring device with its own tubing. A Whisper Swivel 
valve (Respironics) was used as exhalation port for all 
devices. 
Each 4-hour test was preceded and followed by a 30-
minute period during which the NOWAPI device was 
functioning but not subjected to either APAP device pressure 
or patient simulator’s breathing. This was to ensure test two 
epochs in which no treatment time and no events should 
have been detected.  
The synthetic files for each of the 30 tests, containing the 
data recorded as mean values over 15–minute consecutive 
periods, were sent via GPRS to the Air Liquide secure server 
and then downloaded for analysis. In this study, treatment 
duration and respiratory events, measured as apnea-
hypopnea index (AHI), detected by NOWAPI were 
considered for analysis and compared to the ones detected by 
the CPAP/APAP devices and to the actual simulated patterns 
generated by the bench. 
 
III. 
RESULTS 
To assess whether the connection of NOWAPI sensor 
unit to the CPAP/APAP machines influenced their responses 
to the disturbed breathing patterns generated by the OSAS 
patient simulated by the bench, the absolute differences 
between the test setting with and test setting without 
NOWAPI in the circuit of the following parameters were 
calculated: the time taken by the CPAP/APAP machine to 
reach the pressure of 10 cmH2O (T10) and the maximum 
pressure applied by the machine (Pmax). These values were 
calculated for CPAP/APAP machines S9 Autoset (Resmed) 
and Remstar Auto (Respironics) with and without CPR. 
Table III summarizes the results, which corresponded to the 
4 experimental conditions.

In order to assess the intrinsic variability of the 
CPAP/APAP machines’ response to the same breathing 
pattern, we performed 3 rounds of the same 10 disturbed 
breathing patterns in both machines without the NOWAPI 
sensor unit in the circuit. The absolute differences between 
test rounds of T10 and Pmax are comparable with the ones 
found previously (Table IV and V), hence they can be 
imputable to the intrinsic variability of the CPAP/APAP 
devices’ response. 
In the second test phase, all data sent to the server via 
GPRS were successfully received and analyzed. Detailed 
results of the CPAP treatment duration analysis are 
summarized in Table VI. The percentage difference between 
the treatment duration estimated by NOWAPI and actual 
values was never higher than 1.25% (3 min) and never lower 
than -0.42% (-1 min). 
Detailed results of the residual event detection analysis 
are summarized in Table VII. The difference in absolute 
values between the AHI estimated by NOWAPI and the 
actual values, 0.9±1.6 events/hour (mean±SD), was not 
significantly different from the difference in absolute value 
between the AHI estimated by the CPAP/APAP machines 
and the actual values, 0.9±1.0 events/hour (p=0.171, the 
normality condition was achieved). This good agreement 
was confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis of AHI values 
estimated by NOWAPI in each test versus the actual ones 
(Fig. 7A). Also, AHI values estimated by NOWAPI showed

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
NOWAPI is a novel telemedicine system, which provides 
remote monitoring of CPAP/APAP treatment of OSA 
patients at home. It detects critical parameters to evaluate the 
patient’s 
adherence 
(treatment 
duration), 
and 
the 
effectiveness of the treatment (residual respiratory events) 
and sends them via GPRS to a secure server. In this way the 
data can be easily downloaded and revised by the physician 
or the health professional providing CPAP, who can perform 
a closer patient’s monitoring and timely intervene to improve 
his/her treatment compliance. 
Few systems in the market provide this kind of remote 
treatment monitoring, which is usually integrated in the 
CPAP/APAP devices and implemented with a different 
algorithm for each manufacturer. Since NOWAPI is a stand-
alone system, it can be compatible with all the commercially 
available CPAP/APAP devices currently in clinical use. This 
fact would make it easy to remotely monitoring any patient, 
regardless of the specific CPAP device he/she uses. 
In this study, NOWAPI system was evaluated in a bench. 
In a first test phase, two different CPAP/APAP machines 
were subjected to a previously validated set of disturbed 
breathing patterns [15][16] with or without NOWAPI device 
connected between the CPAP/APAP and the bench. The 
results of this phase demonstrated that the geometry of 
NOWAPI does not influence the CPAP treatment delivered 
by the devices considered in this study. 
In the second test phase, NOWAPI was subjected to 30 
different breathing patterns especially built for this study by 
assembling real respiratory flow signals recorded during

polysomnography in OSA patients. The telemedicine system 
successfully sent the recorded data to the central server and 
showed an excellent performance in estimating the CPAP 
treatment duration and in detecting residual respiratory 
events. 
This validation study was performed on a reduced 
number of NOWAPI devices. For this reason the conclusions 
of the study are limited to the tested devices. In addition, 
since this study was performed on a bench test and not in real 
patients, it could be argued that the results could lead to 
limited conclusions. Indeed, subjecting NOWAPI to 
reference breathing patterns at the bench was a first step for 
evaluating the performance of the hardware/software 
implemented in the system. The results of the study should 
subsequently be confirmed on patients in the clinical routine.  
A bench test is a useful tool to validate new systems such 
as NOWAPI, because it allows the comparison of different 
devices response when they are subjected to exactly the same 
patterns of disturbed breathing, which is not possible in 
patients, due to the biological variability in their disturbed 
breathing patterns [15]. Actually, bench tests and clinical 
studies are both useful and should be considered 
complementary when evaluating a specific system [16]. 
Subjecting NOWAPI to reference breathing patterns at the 
bench was a first step for evaluating the performance of the 
hardware/software implemented in the system. 
The encouraging results of this kind of study highlight 
the potential of Information and Communication Technology 
applications in the management of patients affected by 
respiratory diseases and, more generally, by chronic 
conditions. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
NOWAPI showed good compatibility with the CPAP 
machines and an excellent performance in estimating the 
duration of the CPAP treatment and in detecting residual 
respiratory events in simulated OSAS patients. The results of 
this study demonstrated that NOWAPI system could be a 
valuable tool for telemonitoring the treatment of obstructive 
sleep apnea. 
The results of the study will be verified in a clinical trial 
with real OSA patients, in which beside the assessment of 
NOWAPI system performance in a real setting, also other 
critical aspects will be analyzed, such us usability, 
implementation viability and cost-effectiveness.
