Abstract—According to the World Health Organization use of 
mobile, wireless and communication technologies to support 
healthcare and the achievement of health objectives is known 
as mHealth. This paper investigates sub-topics of mHealth, 
mobile health apps (MHAs) and mobile medical apps (MMAs), 
which have emerged with the increasing prevalence of smart 
phones and tablets. The number of health related apps 
available in 2014 is estimated at 100,000. However, various 
reports highlight details, such as:  40% of health apps are 
unused after the initial novelty has worn off; people with 
chronic diseases who need this technology are not using it; and 
that due to clinicians having issues with quality and trust of 
such systems they are not confident in using or in 
recommending to patients. The paper discusses issues for 
MMAs which are deterring development and innovation 
within the industry and the adoption of MMAs by the medical 
field. The discussion includes, the regulatory background, 
difficulties such as communication and vagueness surrounding 
the regulatory status of MMAs, time and cost, safety issues and 
the security and privacy concerns.  
Keywords: mHealth; mobile medical apps; regulation. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Mobile Health (mHealth) has an increasingly significant 
role to play in healthcare, both in terms of diagnosis and 
treatment. Perceived benefits of mHealth include; patient-
focused medical care [1]; greater personalization and  
improved responsibility of the individual for their health [2];  
an opportunity to provide medical support when and where 
people need it [3]; reduction of healthcare costs [4]; 
management of chronic diseases and outreach to remote 
areas [5]. This paper examines mobile health apps (MHAs) 
and mobile medical apps (MMAs) and the possible 
impediments deterring their impact on healthcare. The 
current regulatory process entails many overlapping 
analyses [6] that app developers and manufacturers need to 
consider with regard to their products. A MMA is an app 
that qualifies as a medical device (MD) and as a result is 
required to follow the applicable necessary MD regulatory 
requirements. In developing apps for the health market, an 
underpinning question for the developers is whether an app 
qualifies as a MD. MHAs and MMAs to a lesser extent, are 
currently the most dynamic in medicine and establishing 
appropriate and clear regulatory processes will support this 
potential [7]. Despite the overabundance of apps available to 
the general public and medical professionals, there is still 
the issue of identifying apps suitable for use [8], the safety 
of the apps [7][9], as well as  the privacy and security of 
consumer-protected health information (PHI) [3][6]. Further 
considerations include that apps are not being targeted to 
those that actually require them, uptake among late adopters 
of new technology is hesitant and the successful apps are 
those used by younger healthier populations [10]. 
II. 
REGULATION BACKGROUND 
The eruption of the MHA and MMA markets has 
resulted in regulating bodies being challenged to keep pace. 
Consequently mHealth applications are largely unregulated 
[11]. Guidelines have been released in the US and Europe to 
support developers and manufacturers ensure public safety.  
A. U.S. 
Regulators in the US are the Food and Drug 
Administrators (FDA), which issued a Final Guidance on 
Mobile Medical Applications on September 25, 2013. The 
guidance indicated the focus will be on regulating a small 
number of MMAs considered high risk [12]. The FDA 
ambiguously outlined three categories for mobile apps 
(MAs). The three categories are:  
      1. MAs that are considered MDs and will be regulated 
under the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C 
Act) of 1938 and are subject to regulation before and after it 
is marketed. The guidance defines a mobile medical app as 
“a mobile app that meets the definition of a [MD] and either 
is intended to be used as an accessory to a regulated MD; or 
to transform a mobile platform into a regulated MD [12].”  
      2. MAs that may be considered MDs but will not be 
regulated, as they are not deemed high risk, identified by the 
FDA to be “mobile apps that may meet the definition of MD 
but for which FDA intends to exercise enforcement 
discretion”; 
3. MAs that are not considered MDs. 
The FDA has provided an extensive list of examples for 
each of the categories. The FDA intends to oversee “only 
those MAs that are MDs and whose functionality could pose 
a risk to patient safety if the MAs were to not function as 
intended [13].” It will regulate MAs just like MDs if the app 
is intended to treat or diagnose disease. The intended use of 
the app is defined by the developer or manufacturer and not 
whether the device actually is used as an accessory or 
actually transforms a mobile platform for a MD [6]. If the 
app is not developed, designed and marketed for healthcare it 
will not be subject to FDA regulation. FDA stated in 2013, it 
would begin regulating apps and gadgets that collect or track 
medical information as MDs. As MMAs become more 
abundant and ambitious, targeted FDA oversight will help to 
protect the public health, sustain consumer confidence in

mHealth products, and encourage high value innovations 
[13]. 
B. Europe 
To date there is no direct legislation relating to lifestyle 
and wellbeing apps in Europe. The European Commission 
launched a consultation on mHealth, the Green Paper on 
Mobile Health (mHealth) on April 10 2014, which invited 
comments and opinions from professionals, patients, health 
organizations, administrations and industry. An objective 
was to discover barriers and issues related to the use of 
mHealth [14]. The Commission additionally published a 
Staff Working Document on the existing EU legal 
framework applicable to lifestyle and wellbeing apps to 
accompany the Green Paper [15]. This document was put in 
place to support software developers and manufacturers in 
identifying whether their products are subject to the 
European Medical Devices Directive (MDD) 93/42/EEC 
and 2007/47/EC or the In Vitro Diagnostic Device Directive 
(IVDD) 98/79/EC. Additional guidance (i.e., MEDDEV 
2.1/6) was published in January 2012 to provide guidelines 
on stand-alone software for MMAs [16]. The guidance 
states that an app must have a medical purpose to be a MD. 
In order to market an app as a MMA in the European Union, 
a CE Mark must be obtained which indicates that your 
device meets the requirements of either the MDD or the 
IVDD. Further guidelines are provided in the Manual on 
Borderline and Classification section in the Community 
Regulatory Framework for MDs 1.16 published July 2014 
[17]. 
III. 
POSSIBLE IMPEDIMENTS 
A. Regulatory Requirements & Communication  
A Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) report stated 
“uncertainty in regulatory requirements would likely 
dampen the growth of mHealth” [18]. A commissioned 
PwC report states innovation in mHealth is being impeded 
by the application of inappropriate regulations from earlier 
technologies [19]. Over 150 countries have not yet 
developed regulatory guidance or frameworks [18]. The 
category of MMAs is not experiencing the same rush of 
innovation and market share as MHAs. Reasons indicated in 
the literature include, frustration with regulation [20] and 
the complexity of the rules associated with bringing a MMA 
to market [11]. In 2013, there were no MMAs that pursued 
510(K) pre-market approval [21] in the U.S. In the EU due 
to the highly regulated nature of MDs, app developers face a 
lengthy and unpredictable process, which can delay product 
launches impacting profitability and market lead. FDA 
states that the guidance is not a regulation and not all 
devices require premarket clearances. This is based upon the 
safety classification of such devices, which depends on the 
level of harm that may result if a device fails. The 
classification of devices ranges from the low risk Class I, to 
the higher risk Class III devices which determines the level 
of regulatory control requirements. The complexities and 
overlapping reviews in the regulatory requirements become 
time-consuming and create demanding complexity for 
developers and device manufacturers [6], which require 
expert advice.   
B. Regulatory Grey Areas 
The definition of the boundary between general wellness 
and diagnosis or treatment of a disease or health condition is 
a grey area [11]. In both the U.S. and the EU, one of the 
biggest concerns is how vague the legal lines are between 
monitoring various vital signs for general wellness and 
crossing over into the realm of MDs. Clarification in terms 
of at what stage an app intended to support self-awareness 
and well-being becomes subject to the MD regulation [22]. It 
is believed that due to the FDA guidance on MAs being 
broad that the regulatory environment is ambiguous to MMA 
developers [23]. The enforcement discretion category in the 
FDA guidelines establishes a significant grey area 
concerning products that obviously must be regulated to 
ensure safety and those that pose little or no risk to patients 
[13]. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and 
Innovation Act (FDASIA) recommended a “risk-based 
regulatory framework for health information technology, 
including MMAs, that promotes innovation, protects patient 
safety, and avoids regulatory duplication [24].” The report 
recommended classifying health IT products into three 
categories: 1) “administrative” health IT functions e.g., 
claims; 2) “health management” functions, e.g., clinical 
decision support; and 3) products that perform “MD” 
functions [24]. FDA focuses on MD functionality because 
they present greater risks to patient safety than administrative 
or health management functionality. The benefit gained from 
classifying being legislation can be directed to particular 
apps without stifling the innovation of such technology.    
C. Regulation Time & Cost 
 Modern app development is fast-paced with emphasis 
on cost effectiveness and time to market. Regulatory 
overhead concerns do not encourage innovation as app 
developers shy away due to perceived costs and the added 
time required. Advice from the FDA and those marketing 
MMAs, is to engage early in collaboration with the 
regulators [25]. This will reduce time to market, cost and 
increase the rate of success in regulation submission. 
Manufacturers unfamiliar with the regulatory requirements 
may find it useful [11] to seek advice from regulatory 
experts. The time to clearance issue is an ever constant issue 
and with limited resources in the FDA, expectations for 
reducing time to market are slight. Once an app crosses into 
the MMA category, it then becomes subject to applicable 
regulations. This then requires investigation in relation to 
complying with regulations, applying for approval etc., and 
any other requirements the regulatory bodies impose upon 
MD manufacturers. The FDASIA Health IT Working Group 
recommend that the FDA provide greater clarity to several 
aspects of MD regulation involving health IT, including: 1) 
The distinction between wellness and disease- related

claims; 2) MD accessories; 3) MD clinical decision support 
software; 4) MD software modules; and 5) MMAs [24].  
D. Safety Issues 
Safety 
issues 
include 
concerns relating to 
the 
development, medical involvement and validity of app 
claims [26], software and medical updates of apps [3], and 
customer access [27]. Currently the market is flooded with 
apps that have many claims relating to uses for the health of 
the users [28]. There is little to no understanding relating to 
who is involved in the development and how the apps were 
developed and validated [8][7][9]. For apps that do not meet 
the definition of a MD establishing the validity of the app is 
challenging [29]. Classification schemes for MAs have not 
been widely established. The National Health Service in the 
UK has a Health App Library, which a developer can apply 
to have their app reviewed. Happtique Health App 
Certification Program (HACP) is a company in the U.S 
intended to support healthcare clinicians and consumers in 
identifying medical, health and fitness apps. Both perform 
assessments to assess operability, privacy, security and 
content [3] and remain voluntary. Pursuing the right ideas 
concerning how and why an app is used will return better 
results [6] and lead to focused and valuable development of 
MHAs and MMAs. Consumers have far greater access to 
these apps than consumers have had with traditional MDs 
[6]. Current regulation focuses on the device itself, but more 
attention also needs to be given to the effects of consumer 
access and actual use [6], otherwise the apps cannot be 
expected to properly improve healthcare.  
In the U.S regulatory context, a loop hole in the 
regulation enables the development of an app that would not 
require 501(k) clearance [30]. A healthcare system can 
develop an app that would be used only by clinicians within 
that system and not put onto the open market. The FDA 
states that as long as the app was used within the system's 
own practice and not marketed outside that healthcare 
system it does not require clearance. It is at the discretion of 
the developers and companies to present their app for 
regulation. An app for iPad Mobile MIM that enables a 
healthcare professional to view medical images on an iPad 
and make a diagnosis [3] was offered for download as early 
as 2008, before the FDA had cleared it [31]. The FDA 
oversaw the removal of the app from the store pending 
regulatory review it was cleared in 2011 as the first app for 
“viewing images and making medical diagnoses [32].” Apps 
for general wellness and health monitoring may be rendered 
harmless, but may pose higher risk than believed [6] when 
placed in the hands of the consumer. Consideration is 
required about the possibilities that health and wellness apps 
can go beyond what the manufacturer initially intended [6]. 
Disclaimers used by the developers stating the apps are not 
intended to be marketed as a MD but for educational 
purposes, have the potential to harm users. Users may 
believe naively that the evaluation given by an app is a 
substitute for medical advice [9]. Medical clinicians need be 
aware that some apps contain unreliable, non-peer-reviewed 
content and should choose carefully which apps to use in 
clinical care [33]. 
E. Security & Privacy 
Increasing reliance on mHealth raises questions about 
compromised patient privacy, the cross-jurisdictional 
practice of medicine, and legal liability for injuries [34]. 
Concerns relating to MMAs are security and privacy risks 
associated with mobile app deployment, which come from 
multiple sources, including networks, carriers, operating 
systems and MMAs. One of the risks related to MAs is the 
potential for breaches of confidentiality [7]. Currently, there 
is a lack of understanding that healthcare information is not 
yet fully protected. It is recognized that improved methods 
of data protection will evolve and enable mobile medical 
apps to attain greater patient outcomes [35]. The FTC in the 
U.S has released a staff report recommending that the 
mobile industry provide consumers disclosures about what 
data is being collected and how that data is being used [36].   
CONCLUSION 
Mobile app developers and manufacturers are presented   
with many regulations, standards, and guidelines to 
understand, implement and comply with. They are required 
to understand different regulatory requirements depending 
on the market where the app is intended to be 
geographically marketed. One major recommendation from 
the FDASIA to the FDA was clarification in relation to 
where a well-being app would fall into the category of a 
MD. The FDASIA report [24] also suggested a simple 
framework developers could follow to work through the 
regulatory requirements. Regulation in this field requires a 
clearer and streamlined regulatory system in order to keep 
pace with this quickly evolving technology [6]. Other 
concerns persist relating to apps available that are MMAs 
but have not been through the regulatory process. It is left to 
the developers to interpret the regulations and, given the 
associated difficulty and time issues many market their apps 
as having an intended use relating to health and wellness. It 
is difficult to see a growing impact in healthcare for MHAs 
and 
MMAs 
until 
the 
regulatory 
authorities 
take 
responsibility to ensure safety. Without the assurance of 
safety, MHAs will only ever be seen as a novelty. Equally, 
until the users can be ensured their data is safe and their 
privacy is intact, use for apps in the realm of serious health 
issues will be slow to follow in developing. Further 
consideration is also required to ensure the integrity, 
usability and safety aspects with apps if they are going to be 
fully embraced by medical clinicians and users.
