Abstract— The sensitivity of a force sensor based on photo-
elastic effect in a monolithic Nd-YAG laser depends strongly 
on the geometrical shape and dimensions of the laser medium. 
The theoretical predictions of sensitivity are in good agreement 
with first results obtained with a cylindrical crystal of (4x4) 
mm and some values reported by other groups. However, for 
small size of the laser sensor, the developed model predicts 
sensitivity, about 30 % higher than the values given by 
available experiments. In this paper, we present experimental 
results obtained with a force sensor using a monolithic 
cylindrical Nd-YAG laser of dimensions (2x3) mm with 
suitable optical coatings on its plane end faces. The new 
measure of sensitivity has allowed us to refine the theoretical 
model to treat photo-elastic sensors with small dimensions.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The metrological characterization of scientific and 
industrial instrumentation employing small forces remains an 
intermediate target to ensure that measurements of forces 
lower than 1 N are traceable to the S.I. system of units [1][2]. 
Recently, a number of laboratories have shown a particular 
resurgence and interest to connect results of small forces 
measurements obtained with various devices [3][4]. Indeed, 
development of micro-robots for microsurgery for the retina 
or colonoscopy, measurement of stiffness of atomic force 
microscope cantilevers and handling fragile objects all 
require one to know the forces exerted on the manipulated 
objects [5]. In these areas of activity, the implementation of 
forces in the range of 1N to 0.1 mN by instruments has led to 
the necessity to develop ways to measure and control the 
forces generated. In fact, measurements based on different 
physical principles can be compared, at least in the range of 
their overlap.  Systems of different configurations, based on 
the exploitation of the photo-elastic effect in a crystal, have 
been developed and used to measure small forces. The 
results obtained are encouraging despite the difficulties 
raised for the generation and application of small forces with 
good reproducibility [6][7]. 
Here, a focus on photo-elastic force sensors with high 
sensitivity is made. The reason for this approach lies in the 
fact that in previous work we observed significant 
discrepancy between available experimental values of 
sensitivity and those predicted by the theoretical model based 
on some assumptions that are discussed in Section II. To 
improve the theory we started to make a photo-elastic force 
sensor whose dimensions lie in a range for which there is no 
experimental data, i.e. length diameter is in between 3 and 
12 mm .
2 To realize a monolithic solid-state laser, we chose 
a cylindrical Nd-YAG (neodymium-yttrium aluminum 
garnet) rod of 2 mm in length and 3 mm in diameter having 
plane end-faces.  
In the next Section, a brief reminder on the theoretical 
photo-elastic effect in a laser will be done. Section III will 
describe the new laser, Nd-YAG playing the role of sensitive 
element of the force sensor, as well as the experimental set- 
up. The results will be presented and discussed in connection 
with theoretical predictions in Section IV. 
II. 
MECHANICAL-STRESS INDUCED  BIREFRINGENCE 
The birefringence is induced in an Nd-YAG laser rod 
under mechanical stress generated by external force applied 
on the crystal, as illustrated in Figure 1.  
In order to link the force intensity to the induced 
birefringence (based on photo-elastic effect), we assume the 
stress distribution over the length of the laser rod is uniform. 
The stress components 
 y
and 
 x
 along the principal 
directions of the rod, induced by the applied force F , are 
represented by [8]:

EXPERIMENT 
The laser sensor is a cylindrical Nd-YAG crystal of 
parallel end faces (Figure 2). The pumping face is coated to 
have HR@1064 nm and HT@808 nm and the second one is 
coated with HT@808 nm and HR (99 %) @1064 nm.  The 
laser is bonded to its holder formed by a rectangular channel 
having a width of 3.5 mm and a depth of 3 mm, machined in 
an aluminum part. The temperature of the rod and the holder 
assembly is stabilized to better than  0.02 °C by using a 
proportional-integral-derivative (P.I.D) controller.  
 In this experiment a new procedure is employed for loading 
the laser rod by a standard mass. In fact, a rectangular (3x2) 
mm flexible blade made from a sheet of HAVAR (a non-
magnetic alloy, Co/Cr/Ni/Fe/W/..., of high strength) with a 
thickness of 10µm is bonded to the upper portion of the 
laser and plays the role of a pan as in an electromagnetic 
compensation balance. The photography of Figure 3 gives 
an overview of the experimental set-up. One can find more 
details on the experimental design in [7]. 
The various components as indicated in this Figure 3 are:

Mass standard of 0.1 g to 20 g were used to study the 
response of the photo-elastic sensor. As shown in Figure 4, 
the response is almost linear over the range studied and is 
checked on a wider range. In fact, same results were 
reported before for other size of photo-elastic Nd-YAG 
force sensor [6][7]. 
Using the least squares method, we deduce, from results 
reported in Figure 4, the mean value of the sensitivity and 
its uncertainty to:

In terms of force this value of sensitivity is equivalent 
to:
 60.63 (0.35) MHz N 1

 
To study the reproducibility of measurements of 
frequencies we made several series of measurements using a 
calibrated mass of 5 g by measuring the frequency of the 
beat signal when the laser crystal was free and when it was 
subjected to the action of the net weight of the mass 
standard, 
e
m  placed and staying on the top of the crystal in 
a perfect balance in the local gravitational field.  
The condition to take correctly a frequency measurement 
is that mass standard placed on the crystal must remain truly 
balanced on the rod so that the load is distributed equally in 
each cycle of mass insertion and removal. This phase of 
measurement is the most critical because it affects the 
reproducibility of the stress exerted by the dead weight on 
the crystal.  
Despite the fact that the procedure of insertion and 
removal of the mass standard is performed manually, the 
measurements turn out to be reproducible. The results of the 
beat frequency measurement are given in Table I.

The mean value and the associated uncertainty of 
repeatability are derived from the average of an actual range 
of ten values of measured frequencies for each state of the 
laser crystal.  
The uncertainty of reproducibility is evaluated from the 
measurement of several repeated cycles of applying and 
removing the mass standard of 5 g. During successive 
cycles of loading and withdrawal of the force transducer, the 
mean frequency of the beat signal changes from 20.55 to 
23.51 MHz. These values are obtained by averaging the 
observed frequencies measured alternately when the mass 
standard is inserted then removed. For a given situation of 
the the sensitive element of the transducer, the frequency of 
the beat note is measured with a repeatabilty better than 50 
kHz. However, the reproducibility of the frequencies 
observed during a series of about fifteen successive loadings 
and removals is of the order of 100 kHz. This large scatter is 
mainly generated by the reproducibilty of internal stress 
distribution, induced in the center of the laser sensor, after 
each cycle of measurement when the sensing element is 
loaded by mass standard. A priori, one could reduce this 
limitation by improving the system of loading and 
unloading the sensitive element of the transducer.  
Experimental sensitivity of the transducer, determined here 
by using only one mass standard, is given by:

B. Sensitivity and size of the sensing element of the force 
sensor  
The new values of sensitivity and his uncertainty are 
reported in Figure 5 and compared to the experimental 
measurements available for different force transducer 
reported before by others authors [9][10]. In this figure, 
only results obtained with a photo-elastic force sensor using 
monolithic Nd-YAG laser are considered for comparison. It 
can be seen, from this figure, that the predicted sensitivities 
by (6) corresponding to the ideal situation, discussed in 
Section II, are clearly superior to experimental values when 
the dimensions (
 d
) of the laser sensor are small. As one 
can see from Figure 5, this is the case of the two available 
experimental values of sensitivity, corresponding to

, is an empirical 
relation which provides sensitivity values close enough to 
experimental results. Thus, the new results show that, when 
the sizes of the sensor are small, the sensitivity of the photo-
elastic force sensor depends, in a relatively complex way, on 
the nature of the contact and on the localization of the 
applied force associated with the calibrated weight. 
Therefore, for the small size of the sensitive element, it is 
difficult to obtain high sensitivity with good reproducibility 
required for the measurement of small forces at the 
micronewton level with acceptable accuracy.  
However, this type of sensor should prove useful for 
force measurement over a range of five orders of magnitude, 
namely from 0.1 mN to more than
10 N
. This wide range is 
very useful when trying to make comparisons with results 
obtained with other devices used in small force 
measurement.

Note that this uncertainty is at the level of the measured 
value for the applied force. On the other hand, the 
uncertainty of reproducibility is twice as important. 
Since the sensor output is governed by the stress 
developed in the photo-elastic material, reading could be 
erroneous if the contact is located at one end of the crystal 
and not along one of its edges. The range of the applied 
force, at the micronewton level, can be improved by 
increasing the contact area of the sensor or by using photo-
elastic material with higher constant of optical stress. 
V. 
CONCLUSION  
In this report, we have presented the photo-elastic force 
sensor used to characterize the response, in terms of 
sensitivity and its uncertainty, especially when the 
dimensions of the sensing element are small. The new 
determination of sensitivity was used to obtain the best fit 
between theoretical predictions and experimental values of 
sensitivity for the photo-elastic force sensors.  Hence, the 
result is novel in the sense that it provides new information 
on the behavior of the sensitivity for a given sensor size, 
which showed the overall effect of the nature of the contact, 
represented by the geometrical factor, on the sensitivity of 
the sensor. To adjust the theoretical model so it agrees with 
the results of a set of measurements, we have reconsidered 
the contribution of the shape factor to the value of the 
sensitivity. Thus, fitting this parameter, we have reduced the 
observed differences between experimental values of 
sensitivities, based on photo-elastic effect in a monolithic 
Nd-YAG laser, and theoretical predictions. 
Finally, we can conclude that this type of force sensor 
can provide high sensitivity, when using small size for 
sensitive element but we observe a slight deterioration in the 
reproducibility of the measurements. To avoid aging of the 
sensing element, the force range should be adjusted to avoid 
causing any distortion of the crystal as a result of lateral 
forces or torques. We plan to study these aspects in order to 
characterize the two sensors we have used for potential 
applications in industry. However, we believe that it can be 
quite suitable for the detection and measurement of force in 
the range of 1N- 0.1 mN. Also, it can be used and integrated 
to other systems in the view of traceable small force 
measurements to the International System of Units.
