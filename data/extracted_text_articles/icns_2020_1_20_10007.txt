Abstract—Nowadays, mobile users need faster data speeds and 
more reliable service. The next generation of wireless networks 
5G pledges to commit that, and much more. Multiple-Input, 
Multiple-Output (ΜΙΜΟ) technology in 5G networks is studied 
in this paper, with emphasis on the achieved performance in 
terms of achieved Bandwidth. Multi-antenna technologies, such 
as MIMO, are anticipated to play a key role in 5G systems, as 
they will have to handle much higher speeds than today's 
cellular networks and greater network traffic. Specifically, we 
will refer to Massive MIMO (Ma-MIMO) technology. In this 
paper, a resource allocation mechanism is proposed from the 
Base Station (BS) to the available antennas, using the Knapsack 
Problem (KP) algorithm. Our goal is to evaluate user access 
throughput to the antennas and to study the case where the BS 
allocates resources, according to the channel rate it receives 
from each User Equipment (UE). The scenario executed is about 
serving the maximum number of UE connected to the BS, in 
high quality services. Finally, we simulate the results in 
MATLAB, in order to be able to evaluate the Quality of Service 
(QoS) that is provided to the UE by the BS, with the resource 
allocation technique that is proposed.

 INTRODUCTION 
Some of the main reasons that lead us to the direction of 
5G networks is the necessity for greater capacity, improved 
Data Rate (DR), decreased latency, massive device 
connectivity, lower cost and better Quality of Service (QoS) 
It is expected these days that around 2020, a new fifth 
generation of mobile networks (5G) is going to be developed. 
The 5G network is the next major generation of cellular 
mobile communications beyond the current 4G/IMT-
Advanced standards. It is anticipated to maintain a significant 
quantity of mobile data traffic and a really big number of 
wireless connections to deliver better cost and energy 
efficiency, as well as QoS in respect of communication delay, 
reliability, and security. In order to achieve that, five brand-
new technologies are designed, including millimeter waves, 
small cells, Massive MIMO (Ma-MIMO), full duplex, and 
beamforming. 
With a primary adjust of the proper systems that refer to 
both 
communication 
and 
localization, 
location-aware 
communication can be perceived and a huge number of 
Location Based Services can be supported. 5G networks have 
a superior transmission scheme named Beam Division 
Multiple 
Access 
(BDMA). 
This 
technology 
serves 
simultaneously multiple User Equipment (UE) via different 
beams. Considering the communication between the Base 
Station (BS) and the UE, an orthogonal beam is dispensed to 
each mobile user. In this way, the capacity of the system is 
increased, owing to the BDMA technique that divides the 
antenna beam conforming to the UE position [1]. 
Ma-MIMO technology is a key enabler and foundational 
component when it comes to creating the next generation of 
network standards. MIMO stands for Multiple-input 
multiple-output. It is characterized by wireless systems, that 
allow to transmit and receive simultaneously more than one 
data signal over the same radio channel. This is accomplished 
by using separate antennas in the transmit and receive end for 
each data signal. In our days, 4G BSs have a dozen ports for 
antennas that handle all cellular traffic. From those twelve, 
eight of them are for transmitters and four for receivers. On 
the contrary, 5G BSs can support about a hundred ports, 
which signifies that on a single array many more antennas can 
fit. 
In previous research work, a greedy–knapsack algorithm 
is proposed to analyze system performance. The authors of 
[2] evaluate UE that wait to be served. Then, they choose 
from a set of UE to maximize system performance in an 
optimal way, without exceeding the available bandwidth 
capacity in LTE networks. Other work like [3], remodel the 
number of transmit antennas as a Knapsack Problem (KP). 
Furthermore, the authors of [4] investigate the Signal-to-
Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) precoding for Ma-
MIMO systems, since they need to bring quality to a 
satisfactory level. Related work like [2][3][4], have explored 
the resource allocation technique using the KP formulation. 
In this paper, a resource allocation mechanism from the BS 
to the available antennas is proposed, using the KP algorithm. 
This algorithm is a different approach of MIMO technology, 
as it seeks to serve as many UE as possible, with the support 
of a great service level. Our goal is to evaluate user access 
throughput to the antennas and to study the case where the 
BS allocates resources, according to the channel rate it 
receives from each antenna. The scenario described is about 
serving the maximum number of UE connected to the BS 
whereas some UE are on limits of a cell. It is very important 
for the proposed mechanism to manage to serve these UE, 
achieving a satisfying level of QoS, in terms of achieved 
Bandwidth. The resource allocation mechanism is proposed 
in a Ma-MIMO system. However, the results presented, are 
based on calculations, using a smaller number of users at

every base station, in order to present the experiments 
effectively. Finally, we will simulate the proposed algorithm 
in MATLAB, in order to be able to evaluate if the UE’s 
requests are served in an optimal way. To achieve this, we 
apply the 0-1 Knapsack Algorithm in our implementation. 
The variations in the number of UE connected to the BS, 
interference and other simulation parameters, will also be 
analyzed. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
provides a thorough analysis of the System Model in Ma-
MIMO. Section III provides the proposed mechanism for the 
resource allocation. Section IV provides the simulation setup 
for our scenario. In Section V, we display and discuss the 
results from the simulation that evaluate our system model. 
Finally, in Section VI, we state our summarized conclusion 
for this paper and provide insights for future work. 
 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
MIMO 
is 
an 
antenna 
technology 
for 
wireless 
communication that uses multiple transmission and receiving 
antennas. The antennas at the source and the destination are 
unified to reduce errors and optimize data speed [5]. This 
technology offers enormous advantages with respect to 
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, robustness and 
reliability [6]. MIMO specifically attributes to a practical 
technique for sending and receiving more than one data signal 
simultaneously over the same radio channel taking advantage 
of multipath propagation. In practice, the channel between 
the transmitter and receiver is estimated from orthogonal 
pilot sequences, which are limited by the coherence time of 
the channel [7]. 
Concerning Ma-MIMO technology, the term has been 
produced for using a much larger number of antennas per 
location. As reported by the authors of [6], the main idea is to 
use large antenna arrays at the BS to simultaneously serve 
many autonomous terminals. Ma-MIMO technology relies 
on a plain processing of signals from all the antennas at BS. 
Therefore, with more ports for antennas the BS can serve 
more UE at the same time and obtain better beamforming. 
This greatly improves the BS’s capacity and range. Still, 
using antenna panels covering 360 °, the classic antenna 
boundary problems can be avoided, since the BS (Ma-
MIMO) can thus be adapted in the optimal way to the UE’s 
movement in different directions. Moreover, the antenna 
arrays can be located in different positions at each BS, which 
then allows for optimal transmission of signals from different 
antenna locations. 
As pointed out by the authors of [8][9] and the authors of 
[10] consider a Ma-MIMO network with K links using the 
same time–frequency resource, ending up in co-channel 
interference. Therefore, the target link k receives data that 
constitute an additive combination of required signal, 
interference, and noise. They use scalars xk to declare the 
transmitted signals by the k-th link’s transmitter and they 
depicted the received signal, yk, at user k, as: 
 
𝑦𝑘 = 𝑟𝑘
+ 𝐻𝑘,𝑘
+  𝑡𝑘 𝑥𝑘 + ∑
𝑟𝑘
+
𝐾
𝑖=1,𝑖 ≠𝑘
𝐻𝑘,𝑖
+  𝑡𝑖 𝑥𝑖  +  𝑟𝑘
+ 𝑛𝑘   
 
(1) 
where tk represents the M × 1 precoding vector and rk is a 
N × 1 beamforming vector. Finally, nk represents the 
Gaussian noise vector at the receiver, while Hk,i is the M × N 
channel state matrix from receiver k to transmitter i. 
More research has been done in order to achieve a better 
resource allocation regarding the DownLink (DL) network. 
In [2], a greedy–knapsack algorithm is presented to estimate 
UE, which are waiting for scheduling. Then, they choose an 
optimal set of UE in order to maximize the performance of 
the system. Certainly, this needs to be done without 
exceeding the disposable bandwidth capacity in LTE 
networks. Furthermore, as presented in [3], so as to produce 
a service with an achievable quality, the number of the 
antennas at the source required, is determined by modifying 
it as a KP. Also, the BS transmits a signal vector with 
beamforming and is clarified in [3]. Moreover, in [4] the 
authors express the receiving signal of user k in cell j, as well 
as the DL SINR in a Ma-MIMO system and according to 
them, the DL SINR of user k in cell j is expressed as:  
 
𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅𝑗,𝑘 = 
|𝑓𝑗 𝑘
𝑗   𝑎𝑗 𝑘| 2
1+ ∑
∑
|𝑓𝑗 𝑘 
𝑗  𝑎𝑗 𝑘| 2
𝐾
𝑘=1
𝐼
𝑖=1,𝑖≠𝑗
 
 
 
(2) 
where 𝑞𝑖𝑘 is DL transmission signals and I = E [𝑞𝑖𝑘 𝑞𝑖𝑘
𝐻 ]. 
Also, 𝑎𝑗𝑘  is the precoding matrix and 𝑓𝑗𝑘
𝑗  is the channel 
matrix from the base station of cell j to UE k of cell j. Based 
on the research of the above authors, we will present an 
optimal Knapsack algorithm for resource allocation from the 
BS to UE and evaluate user access throughput.  
In MIMO systems, multiple refers to the streams that the 
source sends by multiple transmit antennas. These streams go 
through a matrix channel, which is composed of all Nt, Nr 
paths between the Nt and Nr. Nt stands for all the antennas at 
the transmitter and Nr stands for all the antennas at the 
receiver. Then, the received signal vectors reach to the 
destination. Likewise, this happens through the multiple 
receive antennas and it decodes the received signal vectors 
into the prototype information. A narrowband flat fading 
MIMO system is modelled by the authors of [11] as: 
 
y = Hx + n 
(3) 
where y and x are the receive and transmit vectors 
respectively. H refers to the channel matrix and n represents 
the noise vector. 
In our case UE connects to a Macro Cell BS for DL asking 
for a DR that can be provided by a BS, based on DL SINR. 
In our research, for two UE that are located within the same 
cell we suppose that there is no interference between them, as 
they can be equally delegated to non-interfering sets or 
Resource Block (RB). RB is a flexible resource structure, 
where the time-frequency spectrum is split into orthogonal 
RBs [12]. First, DR is computed as:

DR = 𝐵𝑅𝐵 ∗ 𝑙𝑜𝑔2(1 + 𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅𝑗,𝑖) 
 
(4) 
 
where BRB corresponds to the bandwidth of a specific RB 
and SINRj,i is the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio 
between UE j and BS i. DR is the data rate for the whole 
system and is equal to the Macro Cell data rate. This helps to 
achieve higher spectral efficiency. The number of RBs that a 
UE (suppose UEj) demands from a particular BS aiming at a 
desired rate, is computed below: 
 
𝑅𝑗,𝑖 = [
𝑔𝑖
𝐵𝑅𝐵∗ 𝑙𝑜𝑔2(1+ 𝑆𝐼𝑁𝑅𝑗,𝑖)] 
 
(5) 
 
where gj corresponds to the UE throughput demands and 
DRj refers to the desired Data Rate for the UEj.

PROPOSED MECHANISM 
Figure 1 represents the topology of the 5G network we will 
perform. In order to get a better estimate of the results, our 
suggested scenario is depicted below. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Topology of 5G network. 
A. Scenario 
We study the case where the maximum number of UE 
connected to the BS is optimally served. The scenario is 
depicted in cell i and cell j, where each BS serves more UE at 
the same time and obtains better beamforming. Later in our 
simulations we will explain the QoS provided to the UE. This 
scenario concerns the case of a number of UE who need to be 
served, whereas some others are located at the limit of a cell, 
as UE in cell l, who can be served by the BS of either cell i, 
cell j, or cell l. Obviously, the decision on which BS will serve 
that UE located at the limits, will be taken using the Knapsack 
Algorithm approach. In this way, we try to improve existing 
solutions from previous research that use the KP formulation, 
aiming at achieving a high level of QoS for all UE.  
 
B. Knapsack Problem (KP) 
For the purpose of reaching a satisfying level of QoS, in 
our approach we apply the 0-1 Knapsack Algorithm. The KP 
is an implementation of combinatorial optimization. 
Considering a set of objects, each with weight (𝑤𝑖) and value 
(𝑣𝑖), it determines the number of each object in a collection so 
that the total weight is less than or equal to a given threshold 
(W) and the total value is as high as possible. Given a set of 
items (suppose n items) we want to maximize our profit [13]: 
 
 
∑
𝑈𝑖𝑋𝑖
𝑛
𝑖=1
  
 
(6) 
We assume that we have a bag that can hold a set of m (m 
< n) item. For each item we define a variable Xi. With this 
said, we set Xi = 1, when an item belongs in the set of selected 
items, or Xi = 0, when an item is not chosen. Apparently, 
according to the previous equation (6), for our set of selected 
items: 
 
∑
𝑈𝑖𝑋𝑖
𝑛
𝑖=1
 ≤ W 
 
(7) 
Ui  represents the value of the item in the knapsack and W 
represents the knapsack's capacity. Thus, the goal is to 
maximize the sum of the values of the items, so that the sum 
of the weights, is less than or equal to the knapsack's limited 
space (W). We study the case of a resource allocation 
technique using the KP algorithm, from the BS to the available 
antennas. The main goal is to evaluate user access throughput 
to the antennas. Every BS has the same threshold (W) and is 
ready to serve the UE. Three variables are considered. The 
number of BS in our topology scheme, the number of UE and 
a counter for the total weight. As the BSs are allocated with 
equal RB (W) and while the counter for the total weight is 
lower or equal to the given threshold (W), we check the weight 
and value for each UE. There are two actions that take place. 
First of all we have to check that UE’s weight (𝑤𝑖) is less than 
the given threshold and if so, we add the value of this UE (𝑣𝑖) 
to a list. Obviously, if UE’s weight (𝑤𝑖) is greater than the 
given threshold, we reject that UE right away and continue to 
the next UE. Next, each BS checks the list and allocates RB 
to all the UE that have the smallest 𝑣𝑖, until the counter is less 
or equal than W.  
More specifically, for our KP, 𝑤𝑖 is considered as the 
bandwidth that the UE needs and 𝑣𝑖, as the distance of the UE 
from the BS. Moreover, in our KP we define (Xi) and Xi = 1, 
when a UE belongs in the list or Xi = 0, when a UE is not 
selected. Therefore, our mechanism is trying to serve the 
biggest number of UE with the minimum distance from the 
BS, in an optimal performance. Although the results presented 
depict calculations, in which a smaller number of users was 
used at every base station, the resource allocation mechanism 
is proposed in a Ma-MIMO system.

Considering the proposed mechanism and based on the 
System Model that was presented above, in the next Section 
we will describe each parameter needed for the results. 
 
IV. 
SIMULATION SETUP 
In this Section, each parameter needed for the simulations 
that will be executed in MATLAB is described, while the 
simulations are given in the next Section.  
The air interface defined by the 3rd Generation 
Partnership Project (3GPP) for 5G is known as New Radio 
(NR). Frequency bands for 5G NR are divided into two 
different frequency ranges. Frequency Range 1 (FR1) below 
6 GHz and Frequency Range 2 (FR2), each with different 
capabilities. According to the authors of [14], the range of 
channel bandwidth defined for FR2 is 50 MHz up to 400 
MHz, with two-channel aggregation supported in 3GPP 
Release 15. Frequencies of up to 300 GHz are used in 5G 
systems. The higher the frequency, the greater the ability to 
support high data transfer speeds without interfering with 
other wireless signals or becoming very cluttered. We will 
now describe in Table I all the parameters needed for our 
mechanism.

In our simulations we consider an area that consists of 19

375m), as shown below in Figure 3. Macro Cells are used in 
suburban, city and rural areas. Regarding the simulation 
deployment scenario, our simulation network contains a 
different number of UE (K). We will model its performance 
for K UE. First, we consider a BS that has a total Bandwidth 
of 400MHz (W) and there are 100 UE that need to be served. 
Then, we consider a BS that has a total Bandwidth of 400MHz 
(W) and there are 200 UE that need to be served. We also 
consider a BS that again has a total Bandwidth of 400MHz 
(W) and there are 500 UE that need to be served. Finally, we 
consider a BS that has a total Bandwidth of 400MHz (W) and 
there are 1000 UE that need to be served. In each example, the 
distance of the UE from the BS is estimated (𝑣𝑖), whereas in 
each example the demands for bandwidth from each UE differ 
(𝑤𝑖) and are randomly generated.

SIMULATION RESULTS 
In this Section, we analyze our experiments for multi-cell 
systems with random UE positions. In the simulations 
executed in MATLAB, we used every parameter described 
above and the results are given below. The figures given 
below are from our simulations with 100 UE, while the DL 
Bandwidth in each BS is 400 MHz and the DL Bandwidth in 
each UE, is randomly generated in the interval [50-400 MHz]. 
Note that our Network Deployment is 19 Macro Cells but in 
Figure 3, UE are distributed in 7 Macro Cells. Nevertheless, 
the proposed mechanism is applied to our COST Hata Model, 
which includes 19 Macro Cells. These values were chosen for 
10

our parameters, in order to present the experiments in a better 
way.   
To start with, the simulated network is described. We 
consider 100 UE that demand resources of our network. All 
UE are randomly generated with a personalized chance of 
appearing inside our area of interest that is served from a 
Macro Cell. Moreover, in the UpLink (UL) network, all UE 
have their personalized demands for Bandwidth that ranges 
from 50 – 400 MHz. As for the DL network, the Bandwidth is 
equal at all BS at 400MHz.    
Concerning the simulation of our experiments, our 
simulated network with 100 UE, is depicted in Figure 3. Each 
UE’s position is random and we simulated our experiments 
for a different number of UE. In this way, we create the value 
of distance between each UE and all the BSs. The signal 
power that the BS sends is proportional to the reciprocal 
distance between each UE and the BS. That is the reason why 
all active UE receive a signal power with the same intensity. 
The authors of [15] refer to this method as power control, 
supposing that the signal power that the BS sends changes 
continually, proportionally to the requirement. Following the 
above information, in Figure 4, the number of UE that 
normally connects to each BS, is presented with different 
colors, according to the minimum distance between them.   
 
Figure 4.  Number of UEs connected to the BS according to minimum 
distance. 
Foremost, if the BS is transmitting data to the UE with a 
target SNR, the transmitted signal designed is based on the 
distance between the BS and the UE. To be more specific, if 
the distance between the Macro Cell and the UE is small, then 
the Macro Cell is capable of satisfying the target SNR. What 
is more, it performs that with a small transmit power. In other 
words, the signal that the Macro Cell sends includes some 
details about the distance between the Macro Cell and the UE 
[16]. In Figure 4, we can clearly see what the topology scheme 
shows us in Figure 3. More particularly, Figure 4 shows us 
exactly in which Macro Cell each UE will connect, under 
normal conditions. That means each UE’s distance from each 
BS is computed and therefore we know which BS will serve 
the UE, according to the minimum distance between them.  
Furthermore, in our experiments we continued applying 
the KP formulation to our mechanism and the three 
parameters needed were defined. Considering a number of UE 
as our set of objects, each of them has its demands for 
bandwidth, which is shown below as each UE’s weight. The 
minimum distance for each UE was also defined, which 
determines the value. Finally, the total Bandwidth in each BS 
is 400 MHz and constitutes the given threshold. Our goal is to 
find the best Knapsack. Given a set of UE we want to 
maximize our profit, which in our case means that the best 
total value is a sum of all the values that are included in the 
KP. Hence, this can be considered as a small modification to 
the KP, because in this occasion, the value parameter is 
defined as the minimum distance between each UE and the 
BS. The bandwidth of each UE (𝑤𝑖) and the total Bandwidth 
of every BS (W), are shown below in Figure 5. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Number of each UE’s weight connected to BS with total weight 
of 400MHz. 
Finally, after our KP formulation and the resource 
allocation, Figure 6 presents the values of the best possible 
Knapsack in each BS. The value of the best possible Knapsack 
is computed as the sum of all the minimum distances of the 
UE that can be served by the BS, based on their weights that 
is each UE’s quantity for bandwidth that they demand. 
Moreover, in every Knapsack formulation, the “amount of 
use” of each UE that is served by the BS was also computed. 
This refers to the variable Xi, which is Xi = 1, when a UE is 
selected to be served by the BS and Xi = 0, when a UE is not 
selected. This amount was computed for every UE in every 
BS. The “amount of use” of each UE, represents which UE 
were served by every BS. Therefore, the best possible 
Knapsack in each BS, is trying to serve the biggest number of 
UE with the minimum distance from each BS, in an optimal 
performance, as shown below in Figure 6.

Figure 6.  Number of BS and the value of best Knapsack for each BS. 
From the above simulations we can clearly see that the 
results are different in each BS, but comparatively the values 
of the best possible Knapsack are optimal, as the distance in 
most of them remains small.  
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
From the produced results, the conclusion made, is that the 
KP formulation is a good technique to use when there is a 
great need to serve a maximum number of UE, with an 
optimum QoS, in respect of the achieved Bandwidth. Further 
research should be done using the KP formulation in a 
network deployment with Macro Cells and Pico Cells, where 
Macro Cells serve UE with the maximum distance, while Pico 
Cells serve UE with the minimum distance. In this way, the 
QoS in each UE will definitely be improved. More research is 
needed in Ma-MIMO when using KP formulation, as it can be 
an optimum solution when it comes to serving the maximum 
number of UE. Ma-MIMO technology uses multiple antennas 
at the transmitter and the receiver and this can be a great 
advantage for further research using KP formulation, in a 
sense of separating the UE in clusters, while each cluster will 
be served by the appropriate type of cell. Thus, each UE can 
be served optimally in a KP formulation, as each BS will serve 
the respective percentage of UE concerning their minimum 
distance. Again, this will offer each UE a great QoS, while it 
can reduce interference. 
Finally, the rapid increasing of the data volume in mobile 
networks forces researchers to study Deep Learning. Machine 
Learning used in Ma-MIMO can produce different scenarios 
when using KP formulation, while it can supply us the tools 
to modify these mechanisms in real time and predict UE’s and 
BS’s behavior.
