Abstract—High population density in India has led to rapid
inﬂux of citizens into urban cities. With urbanization, cities are
facing massive issues in terms of improving citizen health and
living conditions, medical infrastructure facilities and overall en-
vironmental conditions. The recent COVID-19 pandemic further
threw light on the need to solve these pre-existing challenges.
Academic scholars, researchers and industries across the country
have developed several platforms and smart city applications to
help city planners. However, the data sources largely remain
segregated. Due to this, applications have restricted ability to
provide interpretable results and quantiﬁed scores at a granular
level. Our paper introduces a novel data-driven approach that
helps city planners easily comprehend the current situation
and further prioritize action plans to solve urban challenges of
environmental health and medical infrastructure facilities in city
wards. Data from several sources are combined to provide scores
at a granular ward level that is indicative of ward environmental
health and ward level risk in situations like the pandemic. Health
score provides recommendations to improve the environmental
health while the risk score helps in identifying critical zones and
predicting the number of active patients in the region. Several
Machine Learning based scoring models to predict risk scores
for wards are considered. Risk scores are analyzed on a spatio-
temporal basis and results are validated with the actual data
from Pune smart city. The model introduced in this paper based
on Gradient Tree Boosting Algorithm successfully predicts the
ward risk scores with 94.55% accuracy.
Keywords—COVID-19; air quality index; tree cover; health
score; risk score.
I. INTRODUCTION
The urban population in India is one of the fastest growing
in the world. With more than half of world’s population
living in cities, there is tremendous attraction and focus
towards planning and development of cities. There is increased
connectivity as people and cities are getting smarter. However,
this rapid urbanization is causing several problems including
environmental degradation, excessive air pollution, deforesta-
tion, insufﬁcient water availability, waste-disposal problems,
poor healthcare facilities and so on. These issues are further
strengthened by the signiﬁcantly increasing population density,
unprecedented events and requirements of the urban cities.
There is an ardent need for solutions that quantify and provide
insights about these issues at a granular level. These solutions
can further aid city planners prioritize and resolve the issues
faster.
With increased population in India, Health care systems in
particular faced tremendous challenges during the COVID-19
pandemic [1]. Providing medical care to the citizens became
challenging due to grappling shortage of medical facilities
and infrastructure [2]. The need to primarily prioritize health
care facilities in cities became crucial. However, no method
provided granular information in the cities to help anticipate
the required medical facilities. Also, there were no solutions
or applications which helped city planners predict the risk
associated with anticipated number of patients in the cities.
The Government of India has already started several ini-
tiatives to promote urbanization and growth in a sustainable
manner. Smart city project is one such initiative that is
focussing on the development of 100 smart cities across the
country. Pune, a sprawling city in the western Indian state
of Maharashtra has received funding from the Government of
India to develop under this initiative. To tackle the problems
of urbanization via adoption of next generation technologies
and solutions, the Pune Smart City Development Corporation
Limited (PSCDCL) was formed on 23rd March 2016 in Pune.
Together with the India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX) [3], an
open source data exchange platform aimed at enabling cities
to harness full potential of the enormous data being generated
in the smart cities, Pune launched the Pune Urban Data
Exchange (PUDX) [4] pilot and exposed about 850 databases
via the IUDX APIs. Apart from PUDX, the Pune Municipal
Corporation (PMC) [5] has also created the Pune datastore
with around 450+ datasets related to varied sources including
but not limited to information and technology, environment,
transport, healthcare facilities etc. The intention behind this
is to mainly promote problem-solving, co-creation among
stakeholders to create sustainable outcomes in Pune.
In-spite of several data platforms and data sources being
available, the data is segregated and siloed. Data aggregation
becomes necessary to gain deeper and meaningful insights
from it.

This paper presents a novel data-driven approach that com-
bines several relevant data sources, creates data rich models to
improve the environmental conditions of the city, its medical
infrastructure and to provide better quality of life to its citizens.
The work is based on the data from PMC region in Pune. PMC
is the civic body that governs the inner limits of Pune spread
over an area of 331.26 sq.km. Based on the 2011 census, the
data from 144 wards of the PMC region is considered in this
study [6]. However, the same approach can be applied to other
smart cities as well. Contributions of this work are as follows:
• Combining and utilizing rich feature set to provide
ward-wise environmental health scores and recom-
mendations: Rapid urbanization has led to drastic dete-
rioration of Pune’s natural heritage. Low-density suburbs
rich in greenery have morphed into neighbourhoods con-
gested with high-rises [7]. This has negatively affected
environment, climate, overall health and biodiversity in
Pune. To help authorities get a wholistic view of the
environmental health at a granular ward level in PMC-
Pune [8], we provide a data-driven scoring and rec-
ommendation model. Environmental attributes like air
quality, tree cover and population of wards in the PMC
region are used to formulate a score that indicates ward
level environmental health. Relevant data features from
Pune sources are selected and sub scores are calculated
to compute the ﬁnal health score. Further, based on the
health score a recommendation is provided to increase
the green tree cover of the region. We also developed an
interactive user dashboard to visualize the results.
• Investigating
the
environmental
attributes,
their
trends and variations during the COVID-19 pan-
demic: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic over the
various environmental attributes including Air Quality
Index (AQI), sound, ozone, N02 and particulate matters
(PM10, PM2.5) are studied. Variations of these attributes
are quantiﬁed over time and relevant screens are imple-
mented to help user easily understand and interpret the
results.
• Aggregated data rich models that provides dynamic
ward level risk scores: PMC faced grappling shortage
of staff and medical facilities during the COVID-19
pandemic due to lack of planning [2]. A novel data-
driven scoring mechanism to indicate ward level risk
is implemented. Rich data sources that provides ward
level information related to air quality levels, tree cover,
population density, hospital and medical infrastructure
facilities and pandemic related information are combined,
relevant features are selected and latest data available is
utilized to formulate the score dynamically. The numeri-
cal score provided by the system represents the medical
health status of the ward which is indicative of the
number of predicted active COVID-19 cases in the ward.
The risk scores not only indicate the ward status but can
also be used to compare wards and gain deeper insights.
Overall the work in this paper provides granular ward level
details and localized information dynamically considering the
change in the attributes. The scores proposed in this work can
help provide adequate information to concerned authorities
to plan and implement control measures. It will also guide
them to prioritize and identify potential high-risk wards. Fur-
ther, map-based representation of wards to effectively provide
spatio-temporal information about ward health, environmental
attribute variations and risk levels is provided to relay infor-
mation in an easily understandable manner to the users.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 discusses the related work. Section 3 describes the
technical information pertaining to the data sources, score
computations, recommendations, detailed analysis with suit-
able graphs and plots. Section 4 presents the results and dis-
cussions while Section 5 describes conclusion of our approach.
II. RELATED WORK
Related works that analyse the environmental attributes like
the air quality index and the tree cover independently in Pune
exist. These works separately analyse the attributes and present
approaches to optimize the environmental conditions. Kane et
al. [9] studied the scope and opportunity in Pune to understand
the green cover for maintaining a balanced ﬂoral diversity.
While National Research Development Corporation [10] stud-
ied the air quality in Pune to develop an air information
response plan. These previous approaches study the environ-
mental attributes independently and do not provide any kind
of scoring mechanisms to quantify the ﬁndings. In our work,
we provide a wholistic view of the environmental health at a
granular ward level in Pune. We formulate a relative health
score for the ward by combining several attributes – air quality
index, tree and human population. Morani et al. [11] provide
a planting index for a location by analysing the associated tree
cover. It makes use of Geographic Information System (GIS)
based visual approximation techniques to estimate the green
tree cover. Our work utilizes the air quality, population and the
surveyed tree data from PMC-Pune to provide an index that
indicates the ward health. The publicly available geo-sensor
based surveyed tree information is used in the calculation of
green tree cover rather than the approximation techniques used
in [11]. We then aggregate the tree information at a ward level,
combine several tree attributes to score the trees and utilize
this sub score in computing the environmental health score.
Based on the ward health, our method goes one step ahead by
providing recommendations on how the score can be used to
further improve the green tree cover in the area.
Sharma et al. [12] studied the effect of restricted emissions
during COVID-19 on air quality in India. In our work, we
investigate the trends of air pollutant concentrations at a gran-
ular ward level in PMC-Pune during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Such granular details at ward level will help ward authorities
take speciﬁc actions on areas under their jurisdiction.
Yaro et al. [13] studied and evaluated the impact of some
selected demographic and environmental variables to identify
potential risk areas and hotspots for COVID-19 transmission.
The primary focus of this work was to identify statistically

signiﬁcant hotspots for further transmission of COVID-19
speciﬁcally in Nigeria. In our work, we make use of the
ward level medical infrastructure details, ward demographics,
environmental variables like air quality, tree data and the
existing hotspots information to collectively provide a single
numerical indicator of risk at a ward level. Our work is based
on data from PMC-Pune region.
III. METHODOLOGY
This section provides details on the data sources, formula-
tion of scores along with dashboard visualizations.
A. Environmental Health Score Formulation
1) Data Sources: To provide a relative measure of un-
derstanding the environmental ward health, health scores are
computed by combining air quality, tree details and population
data.
• Air Quality data [14]: The PUDX platform provides data
related to the air quality sensors installed in several parts
of Pune city. 50+ sensors installed across the city actively
measure the concentrations of pollutants. The sensors
provide AQI readings every 15 minutes. A pipeline is
created and a job to collect this data on a regular basis is
scheduled. The collected sensor data is then mapped to
the appropriate wards.
• Pune Tree Census data [15]: PMC has mapped over
40 lakh geo enabled trees using GIS technologies and
made data available to the public. It includes data of
tree attributes like height, girth, width, botanical names,
ownership details, location information and so on.
• PMC Population breakup of administrative wards [16] :
Census is conducted once in every ten years in India.
It provides information at the root level. The Pune city
census ofﬁce is responsible to carry out the census
activities effectively and efﬁciently in the PMC area. The
administrative ward level detailed census data in Pune is
made available to the public by the PMC.
2) Score Formulation: Health score is formulated using
air quality, population and tree data. The trees in the PMC-
Pune region are studied. Based on their importance and
contributions towards the environment, individual tree scores
are calculated. From the literature survey, we found out that
evergreen trees planted in rows can capture up to 85% of
the particulate air pollution blowing through their branches.
In addition, a single tree produces nearly three-quarters of
the oxygen required for a person and a canopy of trees in
an urban environment can slash smog levels up to 6% [17].
We also studied the local tree species, their ideal height and
girth requirements to come up with weights that will help in
scoring the individual trees. Based on our investigation, four
important tree attributes i.e. height of the tree (in meters),
its physical condition (poor, average, healthy), phenology
(seasonal, evergreen) and its canopy diameter (in meters) are
selected and used to score each tree (Tree Value).
Tree V alue = w1(Height) + w2(Canopy)
+ w3(Phenology) + w4(Condition)
(1)
Here weights w1, w2, w3 and w4 are calculated with respect
to Table I. We have assumed that taller and healthier evergreen
trees with wider canopies provide more contribution towards a
green buffer zone. Also, evergreen trees are more economical
requiring less maintenance when compared to seasonal trees.
The trees are mapped to appropriate wards based on geo
coordinates. According to an Indian Institute of Science (IISc)
report [18] from 2014, the ideal tree-human ratio should be
seven trees for every person. With this reference, if a ward has
n trees we calculate the Tree Score as a ratio of sum of all
the individual tree scores in the ward to the ideal tree score
(Ideal Tree Score).
Tree Score =
Pn
i=1 Tree V alue(i)
Ideal Tree Score
(2)
Ideal Tree Score = Max Tree Score
∗ Ward Population ∗ 7
(3)
Max Tree Score is the maximum score that can be assigned
to a tree based on Table I. The upper bound for the Tree Score
of a ward is set to 1. In several smart cities, health check
for the trees are done by authorities on a regular basis. They
periodically make a note of tree health and changes in their
conditions if any. Such periodically updated information can
be used in calculating more appropriate tree scores.
The AQI score is calculated by utilizing the dynamic AQI
values provided by PUDX every 15 minutes. For wards with
sensors installed, we take an exponential moving average [19]
(decay constant is calculated based on the number of AQI
observations in a span of one month) of AQI values for
individual sensors, calculate the mean of this value for all the
sensors available in that ward and then normalize the mean
value with respect to the maximum AQI value (considered as
500).
AQI Score = (Max AQI V alue – AQI V alue)
Max AQI V alue
(4)
For wards where air sensors are not available, we have
used approximations to get the AQI value at a ward level. We
identify ﬁve nearest sensors (based on PMC sensor locations,
ﬁve sensors are available on an average in the vicinity of a
ward) to these wards, take an average of their AQI value and
assign it as the AQI value of the ward. Geo-coordinates and
spherical boundary calculations are used here to identify the
nearest sensors [20].
To account for the increase in population over the years, in
our work we have studied the average population growth in
Pune and made interpolations to the actual population census
data collected in 2011. For calculating the population score, we
ﬁrst calculate the population density of the wards. Then, the
value is normalized with respect to the ward that has maximum
population density in the PMC region (Max Density).

Once the scores (Tree Score, AQI Score and Popula-

with a weight factor [11] and normalized on a scale of 0 to
100 as shown in (6).
Health Score = (Tree Score ∗ 30) + (AQI Score ∗ 40)
+ (Population Score ∗ 30)
(6)
3) Plots and Visualization: Figure 1 shows the health
scores for wards in PMC region. Health scores are numeric
values in the scale of 0-100. Wards are categorized into
zones (Extremely poor (0-20), Poor (20-40), Moderate (40-
60), Satisfactory (60-80) and Good (80 and above)) based on
the values of the health score.
Figure 1. PMC-Pune Ward Health Scores.
4) Green Buffer Zone recommendation and example: For
any selected location within the PMC region, recommenda-
tions to further improve the green cover of that place is
provided. For a selected location and a boundary area around
it, the attributes (air quality, tree count, population density)
are analysed to compute an environmental health score based
on (6). Our technique also goes one step beyond this by
providing recommendations for the construction of green
buffer zones. The green buffer zone recommender system
at the backend compares the health score of a place with
a pre-deﬁned threshold value (80 by default). If the health
score is less than the threshold and Tree Score is less than 1,
recommendation to further improve the green tree cover of the
place is provided to the user. To improve the health score of
a place to at least the predeﬁned threshold, the recommender
system provides insights on the number of trees that must be
planted (until Tree Score upper bound of 1 is not reached) as
shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Green Buffer Zone Recommendation.
5) Health Score usability: We have calculated the health
scores for PMC-Pune wards where data is available. Higher
value of health score indicates better ward health. Table II
shows health scores, tree count, population and AQI levels for
some wards.

Of the 63 wards, we noticed that 12 wards had moderate
health scores, 15 had satisfactory scores and 36 wards had
good scores. With the health score, it becomes easy to identify
wards with poor environmental health. Health score can help:
• Real estate owners decide selling and buying price of
properties across wards depending on its environmental
conditions.
• Government to impose certain restrictions on vehicular
movements in highly polluted wards.
• Authorities to grant or deny permissions for further
construction activities in wards based on their health
conditions.
B. Study of variations of environmental attributes during
COVID-19
With the onset of COVID-19 cases in India, the Gov-
ernment of India imposed a complete nationwide lockdown
[21] starting from March 25th, 2020 which restricted people
from stepping out of their homes. All transport services -
road, air and rail were suspended during the lockdown phase.
We studied the various environmental parameters like AQI,
Sound (in db), Ozone, Particulate Matters (PM2.5, PM10) and
NO2 across thirty-one PMC-Pune wards over a period of
four months (January 2020 to April 2020) and quantiﬁed
their variations. Average parameter variations observed across
PMC-Pune wards include:
• 41.0% decrease in AQI level
• 3.0% decrease in Sound level
• 70.3% decrease in PM10 level
• 83.7% decrease in PM2.5 level
• 82.5% decrease in NO2 level
• 77.5% increase in Ozone level
This signiﬁcant decrease in various attributes can be con-
tributed to suspension of activities and restrictions imposed
on citizens during the lockdown. Residential areas showed
signiﬁcant reduction in attributes like AQI, sound and pollutant
concentrations with the imposition of lockdown. However,
since few essential services continued their operations during
this phase, we could see variations in reduction of attributes
across wards. Based on the data avaiable from PUDX, sample
AQI variations of one of the residential wards: Phulenagar both
day-wise and month-wise is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4
respectively.
This study helps concerned authorities plan and prioritize
control measures to improve the quality of air in PMC-Pune.
Figure 5 shows a dashboard that helps users visualize the
variations and trends of these attributes. They can compare
wards and visualize the trends of the environmental attributes
over time using this dashboard. Figure 6 shows a dashboard
that helps users visualize the ward-level attribute variations
and trends in further detail. They can also analyse the ward
level variations on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.
Figure 3. Day-wise AQI variation in Phulenagar.
Figure 4. Month-wise AQI variation in Phulenagar.
C. Covid Risk Assessment Score
During situations like the pandemic, providing primary
facilities like healthcare to all the citizens becomes the need
of the hour. With the steady increase in the COVID-19 cases,
PMC faced grappling shortage of healthcare staff and hospi-
talization facilities over time [2]. With the inﬂux of patients
from rural areas into the cities, the hospital management
faced tremendous pressure in providing medical help. Thus,
we propose a solution that will help concerned authorities
get ward level insights for planning further development of
medical facilities in wards and to be better prepared in
situations like this. Our solution assesses the overall health and
medical infrastructure facilities available at a ward, formulates
a risk score and provides ward speciﬁc insights. A prediction
model learns from rich sources of data and predicts a risk
score that is correlated to the anticipated number of active
patients in the ward. Finally, based on the risk scores the
wards are categorized into risk zones. This categorization helps
concerned authorities take prioritized decisions with respect to
ward administration.
1) Data Sources:
• COVID hospitals and bed details [22]: A detailed list
of hospitals and the number of beds allocated to treat
COVID-19 patients that is updated on a day-to-day basis
is collected using web scrapping techniques.
• Additional hospitals [23]: Provides a list of additional
healthcare facilities and the number of beds available in
PMC-Pune region.
• Demographics [24]: Publicly available information like
- number of literates, number of children below age 6,

working population and average family size in a ward is
collected from the data source.
• Hotspots [25]: Information about the critical zones in
the PMC-Pune region with COVID-19 cases is provided.
Data is extracted using relevant APIs.
• Environmental health scores: The ward wise health scores
formulated based on AQI, tree and population count
mentioned in Section 3.1.3 is used.
2) Modelling System and Score Formulation: To predict
the ward risk score, ﬁrstly, a pipeline is created, and a job is
scheduled for periodic data collection. This is followed by data
pre-processing, data aggregation and model building. In the
ﬁrst step, data is collected from all the above-mentioned data
sources on a day-to-day basis. Next, in the pre-processing step,
the geo-coordinates and addresses available in the collected
data is mapped to appropriate ward IDs using geocoding and
mapping techniques. Further, in the data aggregation step,
based on ward IDs the data is aggregated at a ward level.
We studied an extensive set of environmental and demo-
graphic factors that are important attributes in contributing to
ward risk at times like the pandemic. Based on the literature
survey, thirteen relevant features as shown in Table III are
selected to train our model. However, it must be noted that
no single attribute or feature can individually explain the
measure of ward risk. Grietens et al. [26] in their work show
how factors such as high human mobility rate, age structure,
poverty level, high illiteracy and population density as well
as dependency ratio have been inﬂuencing the transmission
dynamics of diseases. As per a study conducted in New York,
USA, using Kendall and Spearman rank correlation test, it
was found that temperature and air quality had a signiﬁcant
association with the COVID-19 pandemic (Bashir et al. [27]).
Air quality, population density along with the green tree cover
is formulated as a health score and is used as an important
factor in assessing the ward risk (Feature 1) in Table III.
Dalziel et al. [28] and Casanova et al. [29] showed that virus
transmission can be inﬂuenced by several geographical factors
such as climatic conditions (temperature and humidity) and
population density. Also, as we are aware, the primary means
of transmission of the virus is through physical contact as
shown in work by Pung et al. [30]. The spread of infection is
usually accelerated in crowded conditions.
To account these notable factors and observations, this paper
considers demographic factors at ward level that include the
number of houses (Feature 2), literate population (Feature 3),
population below the age group of 6 (Feature 4), average
family size (Feature 5) and working population (Feature 6).
Apart from this, the preparedness of any ward in situations
like the pandemic, depends upon its ability to provide the
required medical facilities. To account this, the information of
hospitals (Feature 7) and the bed facilities: beds with oxygen
(Feature 8), beds without oxygen (Feature 9), ICU beds with
ventilator (Feature 10), ICU beds without ventilator (Feature
11), additional non COVID-19 beds available in medical
facilities across PMC-Pune (Feature 12) to treat patients is

The data collected for these features over a period of time
(November 2020 - December 2020) is used to train the model
and the data from January 2021 is used for testing. Models
are built to predict ward-wise Risk Assessment Score (RAS)
or risk score which is an indicator of anticipated number
of active patients for the next day in the ward. Several
Machine Learning based prediction algorithms like Linear
Regressor, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor and Gradient
Tree Boosting are used to predict the risk scores based on the
thirteen input features selected. In any ward, more the number
of active COVID-19 cases, more is the risk. With this analogy,
we calculated the number of active patients per day in a ward,
formulated the risk score as a function of category of active
patients. Weights are assigned to each of the category of active
patients as shown in (7). This is then normalized with the ward
population (8) and used as the Initial Risk Assessment Score
(Initial RAS) while training the model.
Risk Sum = 0.1 ∗ (Patients without oxygen)
+ 0.2 ∗ (Patients with oxygen)
+ 0.3 ∗ (Patients without ventilator)
+ 0.4 ∗ (Patients with ventilator)

Here, more importance is given to patients currently under
ventilator support in the ICUs (weight factor: 0.4) followed by
those in ICUs without ventilator (weight factor: 0.3), followed
by patients in regular wards with oxygen supply (weight factor:
0.2) and ﬁnally the regular patients (weight factor: 0.1).

Based on the thirteen input features (normalized with ward
population) and Initial RAS as the output, the model is trained
to predict the Risk Assessment Score (Predicted RAS) to
anticipate the number of active patients on the next day. For
evaluation, based on thirteen feature values on current date, the
model predicts Predicted RAS score (which is an indication
of active patients anticipated for the next day). This is then
compared with Initial RAS score (8) which is computed based

on the actual patient numbers on the next day. The Root
Mean Squared Error of the prediction (Predicted RAS) with
respect to the Initial RAS score is then compared to select
the best performing model. The predicted risk scores are
normalized on a range of 0-100, where 0 indicates minimum
and 100 indicates maximum relative risk score. Table IV shows
Gradient Tree Boosting based predicted risk scores for the
wards in Pune. A sample of the risk scores for the wards on
January 31st, 2021 is shown. Wards are categorized into ﬁve
zones based on the value of risk scores - Severe (100-80),
High (80-60), Moderate (60-40), Low (40-20), Very Low (20-
0). Higher the risk value, greater is the risk.

Based on the calculated risk scores as of January 31st, 2021
1 ward showed severe risk, 1 showed moderate, 2 showed low
while 18 wards showed very low risk. These relative ward
level risk scores can help the authorities take prioritized actions
by focussing on wards that require immediate attention. The
risk scores of wards also vary over days. Some wards show
signiﬁcant variations while some show minimal variations in
the risk levels.
3) Plots and Visualizations: The dashboard shown in Fig-
ure 7 help users visualize the ward risk scores and categorize
them into zones. Feature values across wards in PMC-Pune
along with the hotspot case progression is shown.
The user can also analyse details at a ward level and gain
insights on the various features, their values and compare it
with the overall PMC-Pune average as shown in Figure 8. With
such comparisons, it becomes easier to understand the relative
preparedness of the wards.
4) Evaluation: The performance of several Machine Learn-
ing models was considered to predict the risk scores. Table V
shows prediction errors in risk scores with various Machine
Learning algorithms.
The predicted risk score values and their variations for
wards across days is studied in detail. The average prediction
error rate of models using various machine learning algorithms
is compared. Table V shows a sample reference of various
models and their performance for 15 days. Gradient Tree
Boosting based Regressor shows 5.45% error in prediction
when compared to Random Forest Regressor (5.92%), K-
Nearest Neighbors (6.01%) and Linear Regressor (22.40%).

Based on the results, Gradient Tree Boosting algorithm is
selected to predict the ward level risk scores. The results are
further validated with the initial hypothesis which indicated
that risk score of the ward is correlated to the number of active
cases in the ward. A sample result is shown in Table VI.

Ward-wise risk scores can help authorities take planned
actions and be better prepared to provide required medical
facilities to its citizens in times of need.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In our work two scores to indicate the environmental health
as well as the risk score for wards in PMC region of Pune
are formulated. Out of 144 wards in PMC as per 2011 census,
based on data availability, data for 63 wards was collected and
scores were derived for them. In case of health scores, AQI
information was collected from 33 sensors, tree data from 73
wards and population census data from all the 144 wards.
AQI data was interpolated to calculate the health scores of the
wards. Out of the 63 wards, 12 showed moderate scores, 15
satisfactory and 36 showed good health scores. Additionally,
a few locations in PMC-Pune were also selected to check
the environmental health status. Some regions already showed
good health scores while some showed satisfactory and poor
conditions. For those locations appropriate recommendations

on the number of trees further needed to improve the health
score was provided.
Based on our detailed analysis of environmental parameters
during lockdown, a signiﬁcant decrease in level of pollutant
concentrations in Pune was observed. AQI, PM2.5, PM10, NO2
and sound levels showed decrease of 41.0%, 83.7%, 70.3%,
82.5% and 3.0% respectively while Ozone showed an increase
of 77.52%. According to a study [31] a high NOx level reacts
with Ozone and mops it up. The Ozone that escapes to cleaner
areas has no NOx to further cannibalize it and as a result,
Ozone concentration builds up in these areas. This explains
the increase in concentrations of Ozone in the atmosphere.
In case of risk scores, we combined several data sources
and collected data for PMC-Pune wards. The combined data
available for 22 wards was used to calculate the risk scores.
Majority of wards showed low risk scores while a few showed
medium risk scores. These relative scores help compare wards
and take further decisions to improve the ward level infrastruc-
ture and medical facilities.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper provides a data-driven method of modelling
environmental health and ward level risk of a city considering
the available infrastructure, demographics and the environmen-
tal health conditions. Our method utilizes the most recently
available data to provide dynamic scores to wards. These
numerical scores can be used as an indicator in prioritizing
the wards that need more focus than the others. It also gives
an understanding of wards at a granular level. A dynamically
changing health score index makes an attempt to quickly
assess the ward environmental health. It serves as an important
indicator that helps city planners improve the environmental
conditions of the ward. Our paper also studied the variations
of environmental parameters in Pune over a stipulated period
of time. Further, a dynamic risk score prediction model is
introduced in this paper that combines several relevant sources
of data to predict the risk levels of a ward. When the overall
condition of a ward improves, its ability to handle situations
like the pandemic increases. With better facilities, the living
conditions in the ward can improve and the ward can gradually
attain self-sufﬁciency.
The model can be further enhanced by adding valuable fea-
tures like average hospitalization duration of patients, number
of direct contacts and other COVID-19 transmission related
information based on data availability. The visualizations
presented in this work can be further enhanced by making
use of Human Computer Interaction techniques. We also plan
to implement a simulator that would help authorities foresee
the risk scores in wards with gradual changes in the ward
facilities over a period of time. Overall, the scores proposed
in this work and its evaluation was done based on the data
available in PMC-Pune. However, the same can be extended
to other smart cities where similar data is available.
