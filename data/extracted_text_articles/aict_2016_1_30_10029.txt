Abstract—Conventionally, the design of a correlation function for
unambiguous tracking of composite binary offset carrier (CBOC)
signals has focused on only the elimination of the side-peaks
causing the ambiguity in tracking without considering the loss
in height and sharpness of the main-peak during the elimination
process, thus resulting in a worse tracking performance compared
with that corresponding to the CBOC-autocorrelation function.
In this paper, we propose a novel correlation function with
no side-peaks and a main-peak that is higher and sharper
than those of the conventional correlation functions including
the CBOC-autocorrelation function, thus enabling us to have
not only unambiguity in tracking but also a better tracking
performance over that of the CBOC-autocorrelation function. We
ﬁrst split the CBOC sub-carrier into multiple partial sub-carriers
and correlate each of them with the received signal, yielding
partial correlations. Then, we combine the partial correlations in
a specialized way, where the side-peaks are canceled out and
the main-peak becomes higher and sharper than that of the
CBOC-autocorrelation function. Finally, the proposed correlation
function is shown to have no side-peaks and to provide a better
tracking performance than those of the conventional correlation
functions including the CBOC-autocorrelation function.

INTRODUCTION
Recently,
various
global
navigation
satellite
systems
(GNSSs) have been developed due to increasing demands for
location-based service [1]. Galileo is the GNSS developed by
European Space Agency and is now operating with twelve
satellites including six satellites launched in 2015 [2]. In
Galileo, CBOC signals have been employed in E1 band to
provide more precise location service than that of the con-
ventional GNSSs: The CBOC signal provides an improved
signal tracking performance compared with the phase shift
keying (PSK) signals of the conventional global positioning
system (GPS) due to its sharper correlation main-peak [3].
In addition, the CBOC signal enables Galileo to share the
frequency band with GPS. The CBOC signal is generated by
multiplying a pseudorandom noise (PRN) code and a CBOC
sub-carrier obtained from a weighted sum of two sine-phased
BOC sub-carriers, and is denoted by CBOC(x,y,α), where x
and y are the ratios of the chip period Tc = 1/(1.023 × 106)
of the PRN code to the sub-carrier periods of BOC(x,1) and
BOC(y,1), respectively, and α represents that the power of the
sub-carriers of BOC(x,1) and BOC(y,1) accounts for α and
1 − α of the power of the CBOC sub-carrier, respectively [3].
The main drawback of the CBOC signal is a problem of
ambiguity in tracking caused by multiple side-peaks around
the main-peak. The side-peaks could cause the tracking loop
to be locked on one of the side-peaks, eventually incurring a
biased tracking measurement. To tackle this problem, various
unambiguous correlation functions have been proposed [4]-
[12]. Several of them are for sine-phased or cosine-phased
BOC signals only and are inapplicable to the CBOC signal
[4]-[7]. Sousa proposed an unambiguous correlation function
for the CBOC signal, removing the side-peaks completely
[8]; however, the correlation function has a lower and blunter
main-peak than that of the CBOC-autocorrelation function,
and thus, leads to an inferior tracking performance compared
with the CBOC-autocorrelation function. Although there are
several correlation functions with a main-peak that is higher
and sharper than that of Sousa, the improvement in height
and sharpness of the main-peaks is not pronounced, and
consequently, the tracking performances of the correlation
functions do not exhibit a signiﬁcant improvement over that of
the CBOC-autocorrelation function [9]-[11]. In [12], a novel
approach based on splitting the sub-carrier was presented for
improvement of the main-peak and it was shown that the
main-peak can be much higher and sharper compared with
those of the correlation functions mentioned above through
the approach. However, the splitting method is empirical and
the number of the split sub-carriers is limited to four in the
method.
Observing that a higher and sharper main-peak could be
yielded by splitting the sub-carrier more, in this paper, we
propose a systematic method for splitting the sub-carrier, by
which the sub-carrier can be split into any number of partial
sub-carriers, and consequently, a signiﬁcantly improved main-
peak can be obtained. We ﬁrst split the CBOC sub-carrier into
multiple partial sub-carriers, and subsequently, generate partial
correlations by correlating each of the partial sub-carriers and
the received signal. Then, we cancel out the side-peaks while
making the correlation main-peak higher and sharper than that
of the CBOC-autocorrelation function by combining the partial
correlations in a specialized way.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II,
we describe the CBOC signal model. In Section III, we propose
an unambiguous correlation function with an improved main-
peak and no side-peaks. In Section IV, it is conﬁrmed that the
proposed correlation function provides a better tracking per-
formance than those of the conventional correlation functions
including the CBOC-autocorrelation function in terms of the
tracking error standard deviation (TESD), and in Section V,
conclusion is presented.

denotes the navigation data, and si
sc(t) is the CBOC sub-carrier
for the ith PRN code chip. In this paper, we assume that every
chip of the PRN code is an independent random variable taking
on +1 and -1 with equal probability and the code period T is
sufﬁciently large compared with the chip period Tc. It is also
assumed that a pilot channel for signal tracking is provided so
that no data modulation is present during the tracking process
(i.e., d(t) = 1). The sub-carrier si
sc(t) of the CBOC(6,1,1/11)
signal can be expressed as a weighted sum of the BOC(1,1)
sub-carrier and the BOC(6,1) sub-carrier with a power split
ratio of 1/11. Thus, the CBOC(6,1,1/11) sub-carrier can be
expressed as

A. Splitting the CBOC sub-carrier
First, we evenly split the CBOC(6,1,1/11) sub-carrier si
sc(t)
into 12q partial sub-carriers, where q is a natural number (i.e.,
q = 1, 2, 3, · · · ). Thus, the pulse duration of each partial sub-
carrier is given by Ts/q, and the CBOC(6,1,1/11) sub-carrier
can be expressed as the sum of the partial sub-carriers:
si
sc(t) =
12q−1
∑
m=0

m(t),

where ci
m(t) is the mth partial sub-carrier for the ith PRN
code chip as depicted on the right-hand side of Figure 1, and
{ci

are used as locally-generated signals instead of
the CBOC sub-carrier.
The normalized CBOC-autocorrelation function shown on
the left-hand side of Figure 2 can be expressed as

B. Combining the partial correlations
Now, we cancel out the side-peaks by combining two cen-
termost partial correlations S6q−1(τ) and S6q(τ). Speciﬁcally,
we use the following arithmetic relation: |x|+|y|−|x−y| = 0
for xy ≤ 0 and |x| + |y| − |x − y| > 0 otherwise. Since the
product value of the partial correlations S6q−1(τ) and S6q(τ)
is positive and negative when |τ| <
1
24qTc and |τ| >
1
24qTc,
respectively, we can eliminate the side-peaks as follows:
Z0(τ) = S6q−1(τ) ⊕ S6q(τ),
(7)
where A(τ) ⊕ B(τ) = |A(τ)| + |B(τ)| − |A(τ) − B(τ)|,
and Z0(τ) is an intermediate correlation function obtained
right after eliminating the side-peaks and is shown in Fig-
ure 3. In fact, we could employ other partial correlations
besides S6q−1(τ) and S6q(τ) in (7); yet, we found that
the combination of S6q−1(τ) and S6q(τ) yields the sharpest
intermediate correlation function. For example, the half-width
of the intermediate correlation function would be
1
12q if S0(τ)
and S12q−1(τ) are used, which is twice the half-width ( 1
24q) of
the intermediate correlation function obtained when S6q−1(τ)
and S6q(τ) are used, and so, the corresponding intermediate
correlation function would be half as sharp as that obtained
with S6q−1(τ) and S6q(τ).
Next, we increase the height of Z0(τ), which is much lower
than that of the CBOC-autocorrelation function; moreover,
decreases as the value of q increases, and so, is not useful
in obtaining a good tracking performance. We observe that
similar correlation functions to Z0(τ) are obtained by com-
bining each of the partial correlations and Z0(τ) as in (7), and
propose the following correlation function
Zproposed(τ) =
12q−1
∑
m=0
Sm(τ) ⊕ Z0(τ).
(8)
Figure 4 shows the whole process for generating Zproposed(τ),
where Ym(τ) = Sm(τ) ⊕ Z0(τ). Figure 5 shows the normal-
ized proposed and conventional correlation functions, where
we can observe that the proposed correlation function is much
sharper than the conventional correlation functions including
the CBOC-autocorrelation function, and also, that the differ-
ence in sharpness becomes larger as the value of q increases,
implying that we can further improve the tracking performance
by using a larger value of q. However, it should be noted
that the computational complexity is expected to increase as
the value of q becomes larger, and thus, an appropriate value
of q should be selected according to given system design
requirements.

NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we compare the tracking performances of
the proposed and conventional correlation functions in terms
of the TESD deﬁned as
σ
G
√
2BLTI,
(9)
where σ is the standard deviation of the discriminator output
D(τ) at τ = 0, G is the discriminator gain at τ = 0, i.e.,
G = dD(τ)
dτ

τ=0, BL is the loop ﬁlter bandwidth, and TI is the
integration time [13]. The discriminator output D(τ) can be
expressed as D(τ) = Z2
proposed(τ+ ∆
2 )−Z2
proposed(τ− ∆
2 ), where
∆ is the early-late spacing for a delay lock loop (DLL). For
simulations, we consider the following parameters: q=1 and 3,
BL = 1 Hz, ∆ = Tc
96, T = TI, and 20,000 Monte Carlo runs are
used for each carrier to noise ratio (CNR) deﬁned as P/N0 dB-
Hz, where N0 is the noise power spectral density. In addition,
we consider T −1
c
= 1.023 MHz and T = 4 ms, which have been
employed in the CBOC signal of Galileo E1 band [3]. For
several conventional schemes which have additional system
parameters [9][11], the optimized parameters of them are used
for simulations, and thus, the best tracking performances of
them are compared with those of other correlation functions
including the proposed correlation function.
Figure 6 shows the TESD performances of the proposed
and conventional correlation functions as a function of the
CNR. From the ﬁgure, it is clearly conﬁrmed that the proposed
correlation function provides a signiﬁcant improvement in
TESD performance over the conventional correlation functions
in the CNR range of 20 ∼ 40 dB-Hz of practical interest.
Speciﬁcally, the proposed correlation function gives a perfor-
mance improvement of more than 5 dB-Hz and 8 dB-Hz when
q = 1 and 3, respectively, over all of the conventional corre-
lation functions in the CNR range of practical interest. This
stems from the fact that the proposed correlation function is not
only unambiguous (i.e., the proposed correlation function has
no side-peaks), but also is the highest and sharpest. In addition,
as expected, the tracking performance becomes better, as the
value of q increases. Speciﬁcally, the tracking performance of
the proposed correlation function is improved by more than 3
dB-Hz when the value of q is changed from 1 to 3 as shown

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed an unambiguous corre-
lation function with an improved main-peak for tracking of
the CBOC signal. Splitting the CBOC(6,1,1/11) sub-carrier
into multiple partial sub-carriers and correlating each of the
partial sub-carriers and the received CBOC(6,1,1/11) signal,
we have obtained the partial correlations, and then, combining
the partial correlations through a specialized way based on
an arithmetic relation, we have canceled out the side-peaks
completely, and also, have obtained a main-peak that is higher
and sharper than those of the conventional correlation func-
tions including the CBOC-autocorrelation function. Numerical
results have conﬁrmed that the CBOC tracking loop using the
proposed correlation function offers a signiﬁcant improvement
over that using the conventional correlation functions in terms
of the TESD in the CNR range of practical interest.
