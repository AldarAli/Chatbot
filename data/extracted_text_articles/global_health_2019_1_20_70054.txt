Abstract—Stroke is a global health challenge and it represents a 
significant economic and social burden. The treatment of stroke 
requires urgent and coordinated procedures. In this clinical 
data analysis study, our aim is to identify anomalies in the stroke 
care system. We analyze the stroke care patterns using case 
records of all 281,948 publicly financed cases between 2010 and 
2017 in Hungary. The essence of the method is creating care 
events of some basic types, organizing event series into episodes, 
classifying episodes with respect to relevant care patterns, 
computing ‘spectra’ of episode type frequencies for the 
providers and forming clusters of the providers based on the 
correlations among their spectra. A similar method is applied 
for postal code areas. The results show that two clusters can be 
defined that divide the 61 clinics into a smaller and a larger 
cluster with significantly different care practices. The spatial 
analysis also revealed that the clusters of the postal code areas 
form geographically co-located patches marking anomalies in 
the stroke care system. The novelty of the paper is the proposed 
method and its application to stroke care. The findings may be 
used for quality management of the national stroke network. 
Keywords-stroke care; patient pathways; clustering; clinical 
data analysis. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Stroke is major cause of death in developed countries and 
the decreased quality of life of the survivors also means a 
heavy social and economic burden, making this disease the 
focus of several epidemiological studies [1]. 
The currently recommended best practices for the 
treatment of acute stroke involves in several cases 
thrombolysis and thrombectomia procedures, for which 
specialized stroke units are required at the care providers. 
Time is a crucial factor of the treatment as these procedures 
can only be applied during the first ca. 4.5 hours after onset 
according to the relevant medical protocols [2]. After the acute 
stroke has been diagnosed, the patient should be transferred to 
a stroke center as soon as possible. For the precise diagnosis, 
a Computer Tomography (CT) scan of the skull is normally 
considered a prerequisite. Due to the proven success of the 
specialized stroke units [3][4], a country-wide network of 
stroke centers with stroke units has been developed in most 
European countries over the past two decades.  
Due to the economic and social importance of stroke, the 
efficiency of the care services is vital and should be 
monitored, yet there are no widely accepted methods for this 
purpose. Our study focuses on Hungary, a country with a 
population of ca. 10 million, where the stroke center network 
was set up between 2010 and 2012. We do not analyze the 
clinical outcome (e.g., 30-day survival) of the stroke episodes, 
rather, we try to identify the typical care patterns of the stroke 
centers and the other, non-specialized clinics as well. The 
results presented here build upon our earlier results in this 
field [5]. Since the different patterns are associated with 
different costs and procedural risks, such results may be used 
for the planning of the national stroke care network. The most 
important original contribution of the paper is the proposed 
analysis method. To our best knowledge, no similar 
methodology has been used to date to characterize the stroke 
healthcare network at the population level. In the most closely 
related, recent analysis, the authors analyzed acute stroke-care 
quality for the cases of 74,000 patients in Great Britain, 
according to the connection between time of the day and the 
day of the week of the start of the care and the 30-day survival 
[6]. In our study, the main objective is to identify anomalies 
in the care system.  
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II and III, 
we present the input data and the analysis methods. The results 
are stated and visualized in Section IV, and discussed in 
Section V. Finally, conclusions are drawn. 
II. INPUT DATA 
Hungary has a single, centralized health care insurance 
system which makes it possible to gain access to the data of 
all publicly financed cases of the past 20 years in an 
anonymized Data Store (TEA) of the National Healthcare 
Services Center. The private domain care volume in this filed 
is negligible. The case data include patient demography, the 
start and end date of an inpatient case, the associated 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and the 
codes and time stamps of the performed procedures. This is an 
administrative data base, so it has some definite shortcomings 
for clinical analysis: the start time of the case and the time of 
the CT scans are stored only at date precision and also the ICD 
and WHO coding practices of the clinics must be understood 
properly in order to successfully reconstruct the real sequence 
of events in a case. 
For this study, we queried acute ischemic stroke cases 
from the TEA between 2010 and 2017 (eight full years) which 
4

had main ICD codes of I63 and I66. Since such main codes 
are often used too liberally for uncertain cases, we discarded 
cases which did not contain a skull CT scan in the time frame 
of -1 to 7 days of the inpatient case start date. Thus, we had a 
total of 281,948 cases belonging to 228,751 patients over the 
8-year period.  
III. METHODS 
The basic methodology of care pattern analysis is based on 
forming and classifying ‘episodes’ containing care events and 
computing a ‘care spectrum’ for each provider, and it was 
originally proposed for another care domain [7]. The 
‘spectrum’ contains the relative occurrence ratios of the 
various episode types and our basic assumption is that if these 
ratios are similar for two providers, then their care practice is 
also similar. Finally, the overall stroke care system can be 
assessed by finding groups of ‘similar’ providers at the 
national, i.e., population level. 
A. Data cleaning 
Since the TEA data was collected for financial 
reimbursement purposes, first we had to go through an 
elaborate data cleaning process: 
1) Patients for whom the gender, age, or residence data 
was missing or unclear, were excluded from further analysis. 
2) Since we wanted to assess the care profile of the care 
providers, we excluded the cases and the individual 
procedures if the provider could not be identified from the 
TEA records. 
3) Based on the case data, we created a list of care events 
for each patient. We had only four possible event types, the 
CT event, the thrombolysis event (TL), the thrombectomy 
event (TE) and the simple care event (C), i.e., an event in 
which the status of the patient is assessed by a medical 
professional without imaging. This may happen for example 
when the doctor decides to refer the patient further to another 
clinic, possibly a stroke center. 
For more details on data cleaning, please see the study by 
Vassányi et al. [5].  
B. Creating and classifying episodes 
An ‘episode’ means as all care activities related to a new 
acute stroke occurrence. Technically, we prescribed that an 
episode must be preceded by at least one event-free day and it 
may not last longer than two days (five days only in case of 
repeated TL/TE procedures). Since the transfer of an acute 
patient from a provider to another involves a time delay and a 
medical risk, we distinguished episodes involving a transfer 
from those that do not. We defined five episode types as 
shown in Table I. The table also shows the number of episodes 
of the respective types in bold face.  
C. Clustering the providers 
We created clusters from the providers as follows. 
1) We assigned each episode to a single clinic, which in 
the case of the type 4 and 5 episodes, was the first clinic, i.e., 
the clinic where no procedure was performed. 
2) We created a profile for each clinic. The profile is a 
template that consists of five numbers which are the 
frequencies of the clinic’s episodes of the above five episode 
types. 
TABLE I.  
EPISODE TYPES 
Type 
Code 
Event sequence 
1 
An episode without CT, with no further referral to another 
provider and no procedure performed. This may be due to a 
light stroke that requires no further clinical care or a late 
delivery to the clinic (over the 6-hour time window). 
Number of Type 1 episodes: 21,983 
2 
A CT was performed, but there was no TE or TL and the 
patient was not transferred to another clinic. The reason for 
this may be a not so severe stroke or a late delivery (over the 
6-hour time window).  Number of Type 2 episodes: 220,061 
3 
A CT and a TE or TL was performed, and the patient was 
not transferred to another clinic. The typical case for this 
type is a severe stroke patient that was delivered straight to a 
stroke clinic, within 6 hours from onset.   
Number of Type 3 episodes: 10,794 
4 
The patient was delivered to a clinic, where no CT or TL/TE 
was performed, then the patient was transferred to another 
clinic (in most cases, a stroke center) where a CT and 
TL/TE was performed (the TL/TE is optional). This is a less 
favorable scenario, because the patient should probably have 
been transferred straight to the second provider.   
Number of Type 4 episodes: 15,678 
5 
Same as Type 4 with the difference that a CT was taken at 
the first clinic. Such an episode type may emerge from a 
case when the CT suggests a TL/TE procedure, but first 
clinic has no such facilities and they are still within 6 hours.   
Number of Type 5 episodes: 2,182 
3) We used Pearson’s correlation as a measure of 
similarity between any two pairs of clinics, to build up a 
symmetrical correlation matrix in which the elementi,j is the 
correlation between the i-th and j-th clinic’s profile. 
4) We created a network using this correlation matrix in 
which the nodes are the clinics and the edge weights are the 
linearly transformed matrix elements. Thus, two clinics 
following a ‘similar’ clinical care practice were connected 
with an edge of a heavy weight.  
5) We used the Louvain network clustering algorithm 
based on modularity functions to identify significantly 
strongly connected sub-networks, i.e., clusters of clinics, of 
the above network [8]. 
6) In order to characterize the spatial distribution patterns 
of the episode types, we also used the clustering process 
described in the steps 3-5 above to cluster the postal code 
(ZIP) areas. Since the patient demography data contained the 
postal area code of the patient at the time of onset, we could 
compute the profile for each area from the episode types of 
the area’s patients. For that, we used the number of episode 
types per 1000 inhabitants of the area.  
For more algorithmic details on steps 3, 4 and 5, please 
refer to the study of Vassy et al. [7].

D. Software tools used for the analysis 
The data cleaning and provider profiling was performed 
using MS SQL Server 2014 database server. For the Louvain 
clustering we used the Modularity Optimizer tool, version 
1.2.0. Statistical pre- and post-processing was implemented 
with the R 3.1.1 tool. Data visualization for heat maps was 
created with the SeaBorn package in Python. 
IV. RESULTS 
At the end of the data cleaning process we had 904,089 
events, out of which there were 617,276 CT, 274,292 C, 
11,813 TL and 708 TE type events.  
The total number of episodes is 270,698 with an average 
of 2.09 events per episode. Table I shows the number of 
episodes of the respective types. 
There were 37 stroke centers in operation in Hungary in 
the analyzed period. Considering only the 37 dedicated stroke 
centers, the clustering procedure did not find significantly 
different clusters. When we considered all 61 clinics that have 
a total episode count over 200, two distinct clusters were 
identified: 
1) A small cluster of 9 clinics, of which there was only 
one specialized stroke clinic; 
2) A large cluster of the rest 52 clinics. 
The frequencies of the five episode types, as well as the 
average number of episodes for the two clusters are shown in 
Table II. 
In order to visualize the homogeneity of the two clusters, 
Figure 2 shows a graphical visualization of the correlation 
matrix in the form of a ‘heat map’ in which the correlations 
are color-coded according to the color ramp key at the left 
side, light shades meaning strong correlation. The 9 clinics of 
the small cluster are located in the first 9 rows of the 
symmetrical matrix. 
We also performed the clustering with slightly different 
algorithmic parameters of the Modularity tool and with 
another clustering methods, but there was no significant 
change in the cluster assignments, showing that the clustering 
method is quite robust. 
The clustering of the 2,637 postal code areas also resulted 
in two clusters. The cluster parameters are shown in the 
columns ‘Cl. 1 (all)’ and ‘Cl. 2 (all)’ of Table III. Cluster 1 
had a very high intra-cluster average correlation of 0.97.

We visualized the spatial location of the areas belonging 
to the same cluster to see whether they appear randomly at any 
part of the country or they form homogeneous patches. The 
resulting two maps are shown in the Figure 2. 
V. DISCUSSION 
The features of the two clusters of the clinics show quite 
characteristic differences. 
• 
In general, Cluster 1 is characterized by less valuable 
clinical services (c.f. the higher ratio of CT-less 
episodes) and a relative preference of ‘forwarding’ 
stroke care to other clinics, proven by an order-of-
magnitude difference in the type 4, and also a huge 
difference in type 5 episode frequencies.  
• 
Cluster 2, containing five sixths of the clinics, is 
characterized by a relative preference of on-site 
treatment, with or without a TL/TE procedure. This 
pattern is more in line with the expected practice 
according to the protocol.  
The very high correlation coefficients within the clusters 
and the low inter-cluster values (dark shades) in Figure 1 show 
a marked difference between the two groups. 
Since the cause of treating a stroke case without taking an 
emergency skull CT may be either a too late delivery of the 
6

patient to the clinic or the inability to perform a CT a possible 
reason for a clinic to belong to Cluster 1 could be a lack of 
proper imaging infrastructure or skilled staff. A possible 
interpretation of this cluster is that it is an outlier group as 
contrasted to the ‘normal’ majority of the other clinics, but this 
requires further investigation. On the other side, a high 
frequency of too late deliveries in the vicinity of a clinic may 
mean anomalies in logistics or emergency services.

with a ppopulation of less than 1000 (lower).  
Cluster 1: red patches, Cluster 2: light green patches,  
areas with less than 1000 are white  
As Table III shows, the two postal code area clusters, with 
huge differences in the number of Type 4 episodes, are very 
similar in nature to the two clusters of the clinics. The visually 
apparent, quite large red patches in Figure 2 show the regions 
where stroke services should be reviewed. Since we used no 
geographical information for the formation of the clusters, any 
contiguous patches of a cluster mean an anomaly in the care 
network. In our earlier work, we observed a similar spatial 
effect in the care patterns of ischemic heart diseases [7]. 
It should be noted that the ICD coding practices may vary 
slightly from clinic to clinic, which may add a bias to our 
survey. In other words, whether or not a case is coded as an 
acute stroke may depend on the subjective opinion of the 
medical professional in charge. Such variations, however, 
cannot be assumed for the CT, TL, and TE procedures, 
because a procedure has either been performed (and paid for) 
or not. The clear identification of the de facto heterogeneous 
care practices can be used when planning the care services at 
the national level. 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We proposed a comprehensive methodology for the 
assessment of the stroke care network at the national level. 
The analysis identified significantly different clusters of both 
clinics and geographical areas. The anomalies cannot be 
explained by different coding practices. Hungary, and Central 
and Eastern Europe in general has yet to reach the Western 
European quality parameters of stroke treatment [9]. The 
results presented in the paper provide a clear, fact based 
starting point to start in the right direction.  
Future work includes the analysis of the connection 
between the episode types and clinical outcomes as well as the 
associated costs of the treatment.
