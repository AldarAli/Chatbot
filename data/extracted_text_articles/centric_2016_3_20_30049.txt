Abstract—Pesticides are omnipresent in foods and drinks 
and their toxic effects are becoming evident, as well as their 
correlation with many diseases. Pesticides intoxication 
estimation could lead to lifestyle modification before certain 
disease symptoms occurrence. User centered application for 
pesticides blood and tissues concentration is proposed in this 
document, 
based 
on 
location, 
profession, 
mean 
food 
consumption and personal lifestyle indications. Three different 
mathematical PBPK models are used to create such system and 
parametrized from user personal data. User blood and tissues 
concentration of organophosphates per day or per year are 
speculated and indicated to the user. 
Keywords—Mathematical

Pharmacokinetic modeling; user centerd application 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a 
pesticide as: “any substance or mixture intended for 
preventing, destroying or controlling any pest, including 
vectors of human or animal disease, unwanted species of 
plants or animals causing harm during or otherwise 
interfering with the production, processing, storage or 
marketing of food […]” [1].   
In 2006 and 2007, approximately 2.4 billion kilograms 
of pesticides were utilized in the United States, comprising 
mainly herbicides (40%), followed by insecticides (17%) 
and fungicides (10%). The same year, more than 1,055 
active ingredients were registered as pesticides [1][2].  
Many pesticides can be grouped into chemical families 
and target organism families. Plant-derived pesticides 
mainly include the pyrethroids, rotenoids, nicotinoids, 
strychnine and scilliroside. Prominent insecticide families 
comprising 
organochlorines, 
organophosphates, 
and 
carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (such as DDT) 
could be further classified into dichlorodiphenylethanes, 
cyclodiene compounds, and other related compounds. 
Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and 
benzoic 
acid 
herbicides, 
triazines, 
ureas, 
and 
Chloroacetanilides [3]. 
It is estimated that over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 
95% of herbicides undergoes pesticide drift since air 
suspended pesticides are carried out to unwanted areas [4] 
[6]. Pesticides are one main cause of water pollution 
because most of currently used pesticides are Persistent 
Organic Pollutants (POP) and contribute to long lasting soil 
contamination [7]. Their toxicities vary greatly, as well as 
their persistence and potential to bio-accumulate [8][11]. 
In certain endemic areas, pesticides are used to kill 
mosquitoes that can transmit potentially deadly diseases like 
Malaria and can protect animals from deadly parasites 
[2][12]. Pesticides therefore provide variety of benefits in 
agriculture, although there are multiple undesirable and 
unwanted effects of pesticide usage that are now becoming 
apparent. In industrialized world, most of the pesticides 
contamination occurs in long term and low level exposure 
except 
for 
few 
directly 
exposed 
agricultural 
or 
manufacturing workers who suffer long-term high-level 
exposure or less frequently acute poisoning, whereas in the 
countries of the developing world, the situation is almost 
reversed [13]. 
Pesticides health effects, which can be acute or delayed, 
are difficult to characterize since they interact with a 
plethora of enzymes, proteins, receptors and transcription 
factors [14]. 
Countless studies demonstrate the detrimental impact of 
pesticides in human health. Many organophosphate 
pesticides are potent nerve agents, functioning by inhibiting 
the action of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in nerve cells and 
have been linked to increased Parkinson’s disease 
occurrence and may explain increased autism frequency rate 
in developed countries [15][17][18]. Several pesticides have 
been documented to affect the endocrine system from 
synthesis to hormone receptor binding, acting as Endocrine 
Disrupting Chemicals (EDC) [14]. Pesticides such as 
atrazine have hazardous impact on reproductive system and 
fetus development and have been shown to emasculate 
three-quarters of exposed male frogs [19][21]. Furthermore 
a growing number of epidemiological and molecular studies 
provide substantial evidence that the pesticides are

associated with increased cancer risk [22]. Analyzes 
presented in [23] provide additional evidence for a causative 
relation between Pendimethalin, Dieldrin, and Parathion use 
and lung cancer risk. Pesticides are recognized carcinogenic 
for several cancers including prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer 
[24]. Monitoring or estimating blood and tissues pesticides 
levels is hence of capital importance to prevent or cure an 
important number of prevalent diseases. 
Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSARs), 
are mathematical models, mostly based on Multiple Linear 
Regression or Partial Least Square algorithms, that attempt 
to relate the structure-derived features of a compound to its 
biological or physicochemical activity [25][26]. Although 
efficiently assessing acute toxicity risk linked to a chemical, 
chronic toxicity presents a challenge for QSAR modelling, 
which should ideally focus on groups of chemicals with a 
common mode of action [27]. 
Physiologically 
Based 
Pharmaco-Kinetic 
(PBPK) 
models consist of a series of mathematical representations 
simulating the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and 
Excretion (ADME) of chemicals that enter the body. PBPK 
models utilize experimentally accepted physiological and 
biochemical data to predict concentrations of chemical at 
target tissues or organs for a wide variety of exposure 
scenarios [28]. 
PBPK rather than QSAR models have emerged as 
satisfactory computational approach supporting quantitative 
risk assessment of agrochemicals [29]. Rat study based on 
radiolabeled Oxadiazin and Thiamethoxan injection showed 
that one compartment PBPK model fits best [30]. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Paraquat in Mice 
Following a Single Paraquat Oral Dose was performed in 
[31]. Cumulative risk assessment for organophosphate 
pesticide using PBPK model is reported in [32]. PBPK 
modeling was used to predict the total dose of Chlorpyrifos 
received by an individual from urinary biomarker 
measurements [33]. Since Animal studies suggest that 
Atrazine overexposure causes Parkinson Disease like 
dopaminergic toxicities, new PBPK models of Atrazine 
rodents exposure across the lifespan have been successfully 
developed 
[34]. 
Because 
recent 
exposures 
of 
organophosphate 
pesticides 
have 
shifted 
from 
multipathways to dietary ingestion only, modification of 
PBPK model input data is central to correct risk assessment 
and data validation [35]. 
In this paper, we aim to construct a system estimating 
user blood and other tissues pesticides levels following 
different types of exposure, using a two compartments 
PBPK model. Based on user location, job and data, a 
valuation of pesticides blood and tissues levels per year is 
proposed and near future pesticides body internal levels 
could be extrapolated. 
The first section of this document presents the general 
principle of the user based system developed, the second 
section introduces the theoretical basis of our model 
construction, mostly based on drugs pharmacokinetic 
mathematical models. The following section describes the 
corresponding results obtained from experimentally defined 
parameters. A final discussion concludes this paper, 
presenting the theoretical benefits and limitation of this 
proposed modeling work. 
   
II. USER CENTERED SYSTEM OF INFORMATION 
Estimating blood and other tissue pesticides is very 
challenging, partial, limited to a few compounds and most 
of the time highly speculative or inexact. We aimed to 
create an innovative program based on a few samples.  
User location once correlated to pesticides estimation 
maps per countries area which are available for certain 
regions, allowed to assess user exposure levels to water and 
air pesticides. The amount of food consumed per week and 
the quality of it is also a capital information helping to 
determine personal user pesticides exposure. We further 
develop 3 different PBPK models which were selected from 
user profession and location and corresponding to (1) low 
levels long lasting exposure (all population group), (2) 
middle to high levels long lasting exposure (pesticides 
manufacturer, user close to large agricultural fields, etc.), 
(3) very elevated models of exposure in a short time 
(pesticides poisoning corresponding to farmer pesticides 
dissemination periods, etc.). Finally, user lifestyle general 
data were also taken into consideration, such as the amount 
of sport per week since sweating may help in pesticides 
elimination for instance. 
Our program uses these values as parameters which 
were injected into different mathematical models to finally 
inform the user of its mean exposure exposition every day 
and user specific pesticides accumulation per year are 
speculated. 
Two types of user based systems are currently being 
developed: (1) the first requires user connection to an 
interactive website, (2) the second system is a smartphone 
apps, requiring the same user informative procedure and 
connecting to the same processing center address were 
computations are made. Then, user pesticides accumulation 
assessment are reported to the user, associated with general 
population statistics. Both systems are introduced in Figure 
1.

III. METHODOLOGY AND MODEL PARAMETERS 
Compartment models theoretical basis are generally 
described in [36][37][38]. They aim to characterize the 
dynamics of state variables in various volumes referred as 
compartments. PBPK drugs studies permit to characterize 
the dose-concentration-effect/toxicity relationship, evaluates 
the drug/disease interactions and simulate the drug 
responses in various organs [39]. Although very complex 
and multi-compartments models exist for drugs predictive 
evaluation [40], intervening in drug product development, 
analysis of pesticides dynamics once introduced in the body 
are less numerous [35][37][41][43]. 
The two compartments PBPK model was preferred since 
single compartment model does not correctly model 
pesticides accumulation in tissues and because pesticides 
blood concentration often involves two distinct biological 
half-live: one associated with rapid plasma removal and the 
other with long lasting pesticides accumulation in tissues 
[44]. Obviously, more complex PBPK models could have 
been used, permitting to more efficiently correlates 
pesticides accumulation in certain tissues and associated 
diseases occurrence, but pesticides distribution in tissues is 
insufficiently characterized in current literature. For 
instance, our model does not include permanent body 
pesticides stores which may be the case in real world such 
as bones or brain accumulation pools. 
Various pesticides kinetics experiments, mostly based on 
rats are reported in Table I, corresponding to the [31][34] 
[45][46] 
results. 
Performing 
interspecies 
results 
extrapolation of most of the parameters involved was 
proven acceptable according to [47] and parameters 
determined from rats experiments can be directly applied to 
humans by modifying only the body weight. 
Since the pesticides containing the organophosphates 
Parathion and Diazinon individuate the parameters needed 
for the two compartment PBPK model adaptation to 
pesticides, 
we 
chose 
to 
restrict 
our 
models 
to 
organophosphates Parathion and Diazinon only. The 
conclusion for other pesticides may vary greatly since the 
molecules involved could be totally different as their 
metabolism in the human body. Besides, in the result 
section we report pesticides models conclusions only based 
on Parathion and Diazinon pesticides dynamics and much 
diverse results may be obtained from different pesticides 
type. 
The two compartments PBPK model we used in 
described in Figure 2, where Ka represents the absorption 
rate, Ke the elimination rate, Kc and Kd the inter-
compartment exchange rate and Km the metabolic rate of the 
Peripheral Compartment (PC). We neglected Km in the first 
place although specific metabolic models such as Michaelis 
Menten could have been used [48][50]. The volume of the 
Central Compartment (CC) is referred as Vc which includes 
highly irrigated and poorly storing pesticides organs as well 
as plasma whereas Vp represents the volume of pesticides 
internalizing organs.

repartition and evolution 
 
A. Mathematical PBPK models of intravenous injection: 
According to the two compartments PBPK model, we 
suppose that the toxins concentration (Cc(t)) in the Central 
Compartment (CC) is described by (1):  
𝐶𝑐(𝑡) = 𝐴𝑒−𝛼𝑡 + 𝐵𝑒−𝛽𝑡 
(1) 
where 𝐴𝑒−𝛼𝑡 models the distribution phase of the 
organophosphates from the CC to the PC or the amount of 
organophosphates directly excreted. In contrast 𝐵𝑒−𝛽𝑡 
models the elimination phase where both CC and PC excrete 
the pesticides accumulated. 
The mathematical expression presented here corresponds 
to an intravenous injection of the organophosphates without 
PC metabolic activity (Ka = 0 and Km = 0). 
Defining mc(t) the mass of pesticides in the CC and 
mp(t) the mass of pesticides in the PC and applying the mass 
conservation principle, we obtain (2):

where DOSE corresponds to the amount of pesticides 
injected and was fixed to 5 mg/kg of body weight for the 
intravenous injection model (bolus model) or to 50 mg/kg of 
body weight for the oral absorption model, corresponding to 
the values described in Table I. 
The initial conditions are determined from experimental 
measurements (mc(0) = DOSE and mp(0) = 0 since the 
pesticides dose in directly injected in plasma at t = 0)  and 
were injected in the S1 system yielding (4): 
{
𝑟 + 𝑠 = 𝐷𝑂𝑆𝐸

𝑣 + 𝑤 = 0

𝛼 = 𝜆1
𝛽 = 𝜆2
 
 
 
(6) 
Solving S2 permits to extract the value of Ke, Kc, Kd. 
Because toxins kinetics are less well characterized than 
drugs kinetics, toxins body metabolism and excretion are 
often described by other constants such as biological half-
life (t1/2), rate of clearance (CL) and excretion rate (Ke). We 
should hence first find the corresponding (A, B, α, β) from 
(t1/2fast, t1/2slow, CL, Ke) before finding the two compartments 
models parameters (Kc, Kd, …) 
The elimination of a drug (or a toxin) in plasma (Central 
Compartment) has a distribution phase (rapid phase of 
plasma removal because of elimination and organs 
accumulation) and a slow phase (only elimination from the 
CC and PC), two biological half-life are often reported: one 
attributed to the rapid phase (t1/2fast) and one to the slow 
phase (t1/2slow), defining the system of equation (S3) reported 
in (7):

compute (A, B, α, β), using Maple® implementation of the 
(S3) system for instance. 
 
B. Mathematical PBPK models of oral pesticides 
absorption: 
Injection of pesticides intravenously only serves 
theoretical purposes. Pesticides are absorbed by various 
means and greatly depends on individual location, work and 
general lifestyle. We chose to model three types of 
pesticides absorption: (1) one associated with  repeated low 
levels of pesticides absorption (mainly oral through food 
and drinks contamination) and regarding all population 
groups, (2) another one associated with constant medium to 
high levels of pesticides absorption, mostly through skin 
and lungs and concerning very specialized workers such as 
pesticides manufacturers and (3) a model associated with 
high 
level 
and 
short 
term 
pesticides 
absorption 
corresponding to farmer pesticides exposition during 
pesticides field deposition. 
Accordingly, we modify the intravenous model of 
pesticides absorption, injecting an input term represented by 
the function Tx(t). Adding an input function (Tx(t)) to the 
system resulted in a permanent modification of the solution 
such as expressed in (8): 
(𝑆3)

The solution of this first order differential system of 
equations 
( 𝑚𝑐(𝑡) = 𝑟 ∗ 𝑒𝜆1𝑡 + 𝑠 ∗ 𝑒𝜆2𝑡  𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑚𝑝(𝑡) = 𝑣 ∗
𝑒𝜆1𝑡 + 𝑤 ∗ 𝑒𝜆2𝑡 ) is similar to the solutions of separated 
second order differential equations [51][54]. 
Noticing that the homogeneous solutions of mc(t) and 
mp(t) are similar to homogeneous solution of second order 
differential equations. Since the two mc(t) and mp(t) 
solutions are mutually independent, the corresponding 
second order differential equation particular solution can be 
determined separately. 
We first reconstructed the second order homogeneous 
differential equation generalized form leading to mc(t) and 
mp(t) homogeneous solutions by solving the system 
presented in (9): 
(𝑆4) {𝑎 ∗ 𝐶1 ∗ 𝑟 ∗ 𝜆1
2 + 𝑏 ∗ 𝐶1 ∗ 𝑟 ∗ 𝜆1 + 𝑐 ∗ 𝐶1 ∗ 𝑟 =  0
𝑎 ∗ 𝐶2 ∗ 𝑟 ∗ 𝜆2
2 + 𝑏 ∗ 𝐶2 ∗ 𝑟 ∗ 𝜆2 + 𝑐 ∗ 𝐶2 ∗ 𝑟 = 0  
(9) 
Fixing a = 1 to obtain the same number of equations and 
unknowns, resulted in: 
→ { 𝑏 = −( 𝜆1 + 𝜆2)
𝑐 = 𝜆1 ∗ 𝜆2
 
         (10) 
Therefore, 
the 
second 
homogeneous 
differential 
equations described in (11), also has 𝑚𝑐(𝑡)  =  𝐶1 ∗  𝑟 ∗
𝑒𝜆1𝑡 + 𝐶2 ∗  𝑠 ∗ 𝑒𝜆2𝑡 as (homogeneous) solution: 
𝑑2𝑚𝑐(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡2
+ ( −𝜆1 − 𝜆2) ∗ 𝑑𝑚𝑐(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
 + ( 𝜆1 ∗ 𝜆2) ∗ 𝑚𝑐(𝑡) =  0 
(11) 
Including the input function, leads to the differential 
equation governing the CC organophosphates pesticides 
concentration kinetics: 
𝑑2𝑚𝑐(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡2
+ ( −𝜆1 − 𝜆2) ∗ 𝑑𝑚𝑐(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
 + ( 𝜆1 ∗ 𝜆2) ∗ 𝑚𝑐(𝑡) 
 +  𝐾𝑎 ∗  𝑇𝑥(𝑡)  =   0 
(12) 
Finding the particular solution can be achieved using the 
method of undetermined coefficients such as indicated in 
[51][53][55]. We used Maple® software to obtain the 
particular solution for different input function (Tx(t)) types. 
 
1) 
Constant input function: 
The mathematical description of the generalized solution 
is presented in (13). 
𝑚𝑐(𝑡) =  𝐶1 ∗  𝑟 ∗ 𝑒𝜆1𝑡 + 𝐶2 ∗  𝑠 ∗ 𝑒𝜆2𝑡 + 𝐾𝑎 ∗ 𝑇𝑥(𝑡)
𝜆1 ∗ 𝜆2
   
(13) 
It should be notified that the amount of toxins found in 
plasma after a long period of time exceeding biological half 
lives is the ratio between the amount of toxins introduced, 
the absorption rate and the distribution and excretion 
coefficients. 
  
2) 
Decreasing exponential input function: 
This solution is associated with acute single pesticides 
exposure as it may be the case in various acute pesticides 
poisoning cases. We chose a decreasing exponential as input 
function rather than a window function as we consider that 
withdrawal from pesticides source exposure was gradual 
rather than suddenly interrupted. 
𝑚𝑐(𝑡) =  𝐶1 ∗  𝑟 ∗ 𝑒𝜆1𝑡 + 𝐶2 ∗  𝑠 ∗ 𝑒𝜆2𝑡

IV. MODELS IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS: 
The results presented in this section arise from Maple® 
software 
implementation 
of 
the 
two 
compartments 
organophosphates PBPK models.  
 
1) 
Intravenous injection of organophosphates 
Figure 3 depicts the CC and CP respective concentration 
of organophosphates. The intravenous injected dose was 
supposed equal to 0.05 mg/kg of body weight. Human 
Dianizon plasma clearance (CL) capacity was fixed to 7.58 
mg/L, t1/2α to 0.33mg/h, t1/2β to 4.70 mg/h.

2) 
Oral absorption of organophosphates: 
Oral absorption of a single dose of 5mg of 
organophosphates aimed to analyze the time needed for 
complete organophosphates clearance of the CC and PC. 
The absorption rate was based on rat gut measurements and 
was reported around 1.3 mg/h [45]. The other parameters 
were maintained similar to the intravenous model and 
organophosphates concentration in the CC and PC were 
reported in a normal and semi-log graph (Figure 4).

log plot). Figure 4. b.  Pesticides kinetic following oral absorption in 
humans (linear plot) 
 
3) 
Constant absorption of organophosphates: 
The third result presented in Figure 5 corresponds to a 
constant absorption of organophosphates over one day, as it 
may be the case for individuals living near to highly 
concentrated 
pesticides 
field 
areas 
or 
pesticides 
manufacturer laboratory employees [56]. The absorption of 
pesticides is mainly performed through inhalation (Kal=15 
L/min [57][59]) or through skin absorption (Kas=4.81 /cm2/h 
[60][61]). We supposed that the dose constantly in contact 
with population in such areas was around 25 mg/day [62]. 
Possibly because of excretion mechanisms saturation, the 
CL rate was decreased (CL = 4.6 mg/L) as well as the fast 
and slow organophosphate biological half-live in plasma 
(t1/2α = 0.13 mg/h and t1/2β = 1.08 mg/h).

evolution modeling workers involved in specific industries  
 
4) 
Acute pesticides intoxication: 
Dose response of organophosphate is presented in Figure 
6 and acute pesticides intoxication is modeled in Figure 7. 
Pesticides absorption is often associated with inhalation or 
with oral route in certain cases (drinking contaminated 
water, etc.). The absorption function follows a decreasing 
exponential mathematical description since we supposed 
that pesticides were progressively withdrawn following 
intoxication. Besides this absorption function can be easily 
transformed into a delta Dirac function (modeling a very 
short term and very elevated pesticides accumulation) which 
has a similar mathematical description. We suppose that the 
absorption function was described by (15): 
𝑇𝑥(𝑡) =  𝑃0𝑒−𝜎∗𝑡 
where P0 was fixed based on the Median Lethal Dose (LD50) 
of  values extracted from oral administration of  the 
organophosphate Diazinon animals experiments which was 
reported to be around 1.250 mg/kg of body weight, meaning 
that from an individual of 75 kg, the LD50 was equal to 93 
mg  [62][64] and σ was arbitrarily set to 6.5 mg/h. To 
simplify the analysis we kept the pharmacokinetics 
parameters values similar to the previous case, although this 
might not fully depict the reality.

Mean pesticides consumption over one year: 
The pharmacokinetic model implementation results 
presented in Section III.2 permit to estimate the amount of 
organophosphates still in the CC and PC volumes with 
respect to time after oral dose administration each days. We 
wanted to further estimate the consumption of pesticides per 
individual over one year, based on the following 
assumptions: 
- 
we supposed that for an average person, 
the main sources of pesticides intoxication is 
mainly from food and drinks consumption in 
accordance with [65][ 66]. 
- 
we estimated the pesticides ingested dose 
per day is between 2 and 10 mg based on National 
Estimate Daily Intakes (NEDIs) reports [67][70], 
although it may greatly vary depending on types of 
food consumed, quality of water drunk and general 
lifestyle. 
- 
we supposed that each day, 4 meals were 
ingested, 3 of these with 3 between meals times of 
approximatively 4 hours and one between meals 
time of approximatively 12 hours (night). 
- 
finally, we modeled the two different 
between meals times with Normal distributions of 
mean 4 and 12 (hours) and variance of 4 and 8 
(hours) respectively. 
Replacing the time by the Gaussian distribution values 
in the Cc(t) and Cp(t) functions , leads to the estimation of 
the amount of organophosphates stored per day in the CC 
and in the CP respectively.  
Pesticides statistical daily accumulation in the various 
compartment is presented in Figure 8 and organophosphates 
accumulation estimation in one year in the CC and CP is 
illustrated in Figure 9 an may certainly explain disease rate 
explosion in industrialized countries. 
 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In 
single 
organophosphates 
injection 
models 
(intravenous or through oral route), the concentration of 
pesticides in the Peripheral Compartment (PC) is greater 
than the concentration of pesticides in the Central 
Compartment (CC) in the distribution phase because the 
elimination of pesticides only occurs in the CC in this 
models. This may indicate that the blood concentration of 
pesticides does not accurately reflects the pesticides in other 
tissues, explaining why urine or hair analysis are sometimes 
preferred.  
In the constant pesticide inhalation model, the final 
concentration of pesticides in the blood compartment is 
proportional to the amount of pesticides injected weighted 
by the ratio between the absorption rate (intestines, lungs, 
etc.) divided by the distribution and elimination parameters.  
In the acute pesticides poisoning model, the CC and PC 
concentration of pesticides is maintained very elevated 
several hours after pesticides high exposure, most often 
requiring very quick and drastic detoxification measures. 
Notwithstanding the two compartments PBPK model 
does describe pesticides storage in tissues only if Kd is 
neglected (Figure 2), which was not the case in our 
implementation. 
Including 
another 
compartment 
(representing pesticides long lasting body stores) or 
modifying our model could possibly lead to improved 
experimental data matching.  
We estimated pesticides concentrated in blood and in 
other tissues, by extrapolating the organophosphates body 
kinetics. Since other pesticides may have very different 
kinetics 
and 
possibly 
much 
more 
elevated 
body 
accumulation, constructing PBPK models based on other 
pesticides types may help to better assess personal

intoxication. Ultimately pesticides biomarkers studies [57] 
should be confronted to our model for results validation. 
Pesticides blood and tissue concentration per year for an 
average individual is estimated to 25 mg, which however 
gradually grows with respect of time. Supposing that once 
the pesticides concentration in a certain tissue reaches a 
certain threshold, tissue dysfunction is expected and disease 
symptoms appear, such conclusions on tissue pesticides 
accumulation 
are 
extremely 
worrying 
and 
disease 
occurrence is unavoidable after a certain period of time. 
Pesticides, because of their omnipresence in foods and 
drinks may hence be considered as significant etiologic 
factors of many diseases. Consequently, measures reducing 
pesticides intoxication could result in a rate regression of 
some deceases in industrialized countries.  
Backbones for user based applications of personal blood 
and tissue organophosphates concentration are proposed in 
this document and may lead to lifestyle modification.
