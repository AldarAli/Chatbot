Abstract— Opinions differ on the relative costs and benefits of 
personas as used in Interaction design (IxD) and User 
Experience (UX). And yet there has been little research to 
systematically elicit attitudes towards them held by IxD and UX 
professionals. We report a ‘state-of-practice’ survey conducted 
with IxD/UX professionals called ‘What’s Hot in Interaction 
Design’ and focus here on 20 items from the survey that elicited 
usage of and opinions about personas. The survey items were 
derived from opinions and reports collated from the academic 
and professional literature. We use factor analysis to reduce the 
items to a fundamental set of areas or concerns (factors), and 
use significance testing to test for agreement on each item 
including an analysis of the strength of opinion using odds ratio. 
According to the findings, 64% of respondents use personas 
with usage during research, design & evaluation phases. The 
factor analysis shows that opinions fall into three broad areas: 
benefits, resource demands, and pitfalls. Practitioners tend to 
agree that personas have a range of benefits, but that they make 
demands on specific kinds of resources and there are some 
specific pitfalls—all of which we report. We discuss implications 
for improving personas through enhanced methods and tools, 
and curricula.

 INTRODUCTION  
This paper presents findings from a survey of Interaction 
Design (IxD) and User Experience (UX) professionals 
concerning their views about personas, presented initially in 
[1] and extended using exploratory factor analysis, which 
reveals three factors: benefits, resource demands and pitfalls. 
In 1999, Cooper [2] introduced the idea of personas as a way 
of anchoring design within a vision of intended users. A 
persona is a kind of user-model—a composite archetype [3] 
drawn from behavioral data from users of an existing or 
intended digital product. A set of personas can be created 
where each represents a group of users with similar behaviors, 
attitudes, aptitudes, and needs. Methods for creating personas 
have been suggested by Cooper [3], Pruitt and Adlin [4], and 
Nielsen [4][5] with semi-automated methods also being 
proposed [7]–[9].  
Personas can have a role in the three phases of the User 
Centered Design (UCD): User Research & Requirements, 
Designing & Prototyping and Evaluation. Advocates argue 
that they promote empathy and help focus design on the goals 
and characteristics of users. Despite the enthusiasm that some 
hold for personas, however, concerns have been raised about 
issues such as the resources required to create them [4][10]–
[13] and their value to the design process [12]–[16].  
A review of practitioners’ attitudes towards personas via a 
selection of articles on professional websites revealed views 
ranging from strong advocacy to skepticism. Although it has 
been 18 years since the publication of The Inmates are 
Running the Asylum [2], there has been little research to 
systematically elicit attitudes towards personas held by the 
people who might use them—Interaction Design and User 
Experience professionals.  
We conducted an online survey called ‘What’s Hot in 
Interaction Design’ to elicit details of current practices and 
attitudes of industry professionals. The survey spanned many 
topics, of which personas was one. Our motivation was to 
provide stimulus for considering new methods and tools, to 
inform university syllabus development, and simply to record 
and report current trends. The survey was in two parts: (1) an 
initial part about Interaction Design/User Experience practice 
in general (‘main survey’), which included 4 questions about 
personas, and (2) an optional additional part (‘persona 
survey’), with 16 items (hereafter referred to as ‘A1’ to ‘A16’ 
see Table I) focused on personas. Items were derived from a 
review of issues raised in the academic literature. The main 
survey was completed by 173 practitioners. 76 practitioners 
went on to complete the persona survey.  
In this paper, we report results relating to persona use from 
both the main survey and the persona survey. We also report 
an exploratory factor analysis that was used to organize the 
results in terms of a set of more abstract, latent variables. This 
provides an organizing principle for attitudes towards 
personas reducing them into to a set of more fundamental 
factors. We also report an analysis of each item using 
significance testing and prioritize items using effect size (odds 
ratio) as a measure of relative strength of feeling.  
In Section II, we review background literature that 
provided the basis for the persona survey items. In Section III, 
we discuss the survey and analysis method, and in Section IV 
we report the findings. In the final section, we summarize the 
results and discuss implications of our findings for interaction 
design practice. 
II. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Overview on Personas  
Cooper introduced the idea of personas in 1999 [2]. 
Although a method for creating personas was not clearly 

300

articulated at that point, the idea attracted a good deal of 
attention. According to Cooper, personas offer a balance 
between formality and informality that carries more nuance 
than diagrammatic models through capturing users' goals, 
tasks, characteristics, and environments. The belief was that 
they could allow design teams from different disciplines and 
stakeholders to communicate about and empathize with the 
users and develop more focused designs. Methods for creating 
personas were subsequently offered that provided a structured 
approached to the development of personas. These included 
Pruitt, Grudin and Adlins’ ‘role-based perspective’ [4][10]; 
Cooper, Reimann and Cronin’s ‘goal-directed perspective’ 
[2]; and Nielsen’s ‘engaging perspective’ [5]. Cooper, 
Reimann and Cronins’ [2] method is a 7-step approach 
representing user-goals and including activities, attitudes, 
aptitudes, motivations, and skills towards a product. Pruitt, 
Grudin, and Adlin [4][10] agreed on the benefits of personas 
suggested earlier, but proposed personas as a complementary 
tool. Their method is a 5-step approach that looks into massive 
data and attempts to verify the quality and adequacy of 
persona representation. Nielsen [4][5], who observed 
variations in persona use, criticized some practitioners for 
failing to fully appreciate the potential of personas and for 
adopting marketing archetypes as personas. She offered the 
‘Engaging Persona’ process, which is a 10-step approach 
aimed at establishing common ground on gathering data 
related to user needs, attitudes and aptitudes and includes 
details 
such 
as 
social 
background, 
psychological 
characteristics, and emotional relationship to invoke empathy 
and avoid stereotyping [17]. The method also included some 
steps that focus on how to make personas accepted and used 
by team members.  
B. Studies on Personas 
Some studies have explored experiences and outcomes of 
persona creation and use. Blomquist and Arvola [14], for 
example, observed a design team’s first experience with 
personas. Methods for creating personas were relatively 
under-developed at that time and the authors found designers 
lacked confidence in using them for communication or design, 
concluding a need for expertise and integrating personas 
within existing knowledge and practice. Chang et al. [18] 
reported a small study with practitioners comparing attitudes 
of some who used personas and some of who didn’t. The study 
found more positive attitudes towards personas from those 
who use personas who found it an essential tool for design. 
The study also found practitioners experimenting with new 
approaches. Later, Miaskiewicz and Kozar [19] elicited 
perceived benefits of personas from 19 experts (practitioners 
who created and used them) and derived a ranked list of 22 
benefits, including: providing audience focus, helping to 
guide decisions, supporting collaboration, acting as a 
communication aid and guiding evaluation. Mathews et al. 
[16] reported a study of 14 practitioners and observed that 
those trained on Cooper’s method tended to champion 
personas, whereas those trained in Engineering and Computer 
Science were  ‘moderate’ persona users, and those trained in 
HCI and Design were pessimistic. The study also indicated 
benefits of personas in helping understand users' needs and 
context and establishing common ground.   
A number of literature sources draw attention to the cost 
implications of personas creation. LeRouge [20] argued that 
despite their cost implications, when personas are successfully 
integrated into a design process by trained team members, the 
benefits outweigh the costs.  Billestrup et al. [21] designed a 
questionnaire survey to investigate the knowledge and use of 
personas across 60 software development companies within a 
specific geographical region. The results revealed that more 
than half of the respondents had not heard of personas while 
the other respondents stated that personas were not well 
integrated into the development process. In addition, some 
problems related to time and budget constraints, limited 
knowledge 
with 
persona 
methods 
and 
inadequacy/ 
shallowness of persona descriptions were reported. 
Based on an observational study of design team 
conversations, Friess [12] questioned the benefits of personas 
as a tool for communication. Fries’ study showed that despite 
time and resources spent on developing and refining personas, 
they were only referred to briefly in designers’ conversations. 
Fries, however, resists the conclusion that personas are not 
useful with the observation that members of the design team 
who created personas invoked them in conversations much 
more often than other team members and stakeholders. Tharon 
[13] commented on the result that,  “Leaving the development 
of the personas to a select few on the team seems likely to 
ensure that those few are the only members of your team who 
will benefit from the time and money invested in the personas 
development.”  
C. Personas and Empirical Methods of User Research 
It is argued across the several methods of creating 
personas [3]–[5][7]–[9][11] that personas should be derived 
from user research. The approach suggested by Cooper [2][3] 
was solely qualitative, involving informal manual clustering 
of users (based on ‘behavioral variables'). Such an approach 
has raised questions about possibilities of exploiting 
quantitative data [4][9]–[11], as well as issues of sample size 
[4][7][9]–[11][15], adequacy of personas in terms of validity 
and human bias [8][9][11][15], and time and budget 
implications [4][7][9]–[11][13][15][16][22]. In response to 
such issues, some have proposed the integration of 
quantitative research and/or automating clustering methods.   
Pruitt, Adlin, and Grudin [4][10] were the first to combine 
quantitative and qualitative methods based on existing data 
about users. Their clustering method remained manual and 
was performed by experts in user research. They suggested 
validating personas through “sanity checks” and “foundation 
documents” to link them with the original gathered data. 
Later, Chapman’s and Milham’s [15] discussed the 
unexplored limitations of the former persona methods in terms 
of significance, accuracy, validity, human bias, and relation to 
the design of the product. These authors focused on bringing 
some automation to the process to increase objectivity, 
improve validity by increasing sample size, whilst also 
improving the efficiency of the method and making it less 
dependent on research expertise.

Mulder and Yaar [11] proposed a mixed method for web 
design personas starting with a quantitative analysis of large-
scale market research and website log data and using semi-
automated 
clustering 
techniques 
to 
create 
market 
segmentation/user profiles, followed by qualitative analysis 
such as interviews, field studies or usability tests. Following 
this, McGinn and Kotamraju [9] suggested designing a survey 
with agreed attributes to collect large-samples of customer 
data. Factor Analysis (FA) was used from the initial 
groupings, followed by interviews with selected users to 
reveal the goals and motivation and to validate group 
membership.  
Maikenzie et al. [8] proposed Latent Semantic Analysis 
(LSA) for semi-automated clustering of qualitative interview 
transcripts data, proposing this method to be “more efficient, 
less subjective, and less reliant on specialized skills”. Brikey, 
Walczak, and Burgess [7] reported a study that classified the 
methods of creating personas in terms of manual qualitative 
techniques and semi-automated techniques (LSA, FA, 
principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate cluster 
analysis (CA)). The findings indicated that LSA semi-
automated method, when compared to the manual qualitative 
method, is not affected by the quantity of data, requires less 
expertise in clustering, is faster and cheaper, and minimizes 
human bias. The study also showed that the three automated 
clustering techniques didn't agree with the cluster assignment 
done by experts. 
In her 10-step approach, Nielsen [5] applies quantitative 
and qualitative research methods and considers manual 
clustering techniques (affinity diagrams and empathy maps) 
to be performed by qualified team members. These 
approaches each in its own capacity have exploited at least one 
of the following: sample size, adequacy of persona, time and 
budget; 
yet 
all 
of 
them 
need 
the 
expertise 
in 
quantitative/qualitative data analysis for clustering users. 
D. Professional Literature 
We also conducted a review of professional magazines 
and association websites for articles on personas. Here, mixed 
opinions can be found along with specific concerns that in 
many cases echo those expressed in the academic literature. 
For example, Sholmo [23][24] remarks, “For every designer 
who uses personas, I have found even more who strongly 
oppose the technique.” He reflects on his own conversion 
from negative attitude to positive once he started to develop 
and use personas “properly” in his work. He attempts to 
convince detractors to change their perceptions and promotes 
the use of personas for those who are unfamiliar with the 
process. Similarly Kellingley [25], another advocate for the 
development of personas, agreed with many of the criticisms 
under three headings: “Personas are time-consuming”, 
“Personas are expensive”, and “Personas need time to show 
ROI”. However, he argues that more time and money would 
be spent on building and rebuilding products without 
considering user requirements and personas. Accordingly, the 
attempt to reduce cost and time by cutting back on user 
research and abandoning the use of personas does not hold.  In 
the same way, Bryan [26] discusses three reasons that lead 
some peers to adverse personas as a design tool. First, the use 
of “Analytics”, which he argues can reveal many insights 
about the design components based on users’ interactions, 
overlooks how UX designers work and merely specifies user 
behaviors, which is essential to the UX strategy. Second, A/B 
and multivariate testing assesses alternative designs in terms 
of quantitative results, but do not suggest how to reach the best 
design. Third, in an agile environment UX practitioners feel a 
burden when creating and designing personas because of time 
constraints, which again reveals that there is a need for better 
ways of fitting personas in the UX process. 
III. 
METHOD 
A. Survey Design 
The main survey contained 29 questions distributed across 
sections on: (1) demographics; (2) user research; (3) design 
and prototyping; (4) product development; and (5) evaluation. 
Section 
(1) 
contained 
questions 
about 
respondents’ 
professional experience, the answers to which determined 
subsequent sections they were asked to complete. There were 
four questions about personas in the main survey across the 
remaining sections.  
The persona survey contained 16 items. Each elicited 
agreement with a series of propositions on a five-point Likert 
scale. Each proposition represents a possible attitude towards 
personas. These were derived from the literature by collating 
opinions and making observations of work reported by 
relevant academic sources (most appear in the literature 
review above) and a selection of industry blogs. The 
propositions are itemized in Table I and each is mapped 
against its sources.  
The studies we used to generate the propositions were 
typically qualitative and/or longitudinal and based on a small 
sample drawn from a specific context. In this sense, the survey 
can be seen as corroborating their findings against a larger and 
more widely drawn sample. In some cases, sources 
contradicted each other. Here the survey can be seen as 
helping to resolve such conflicts. Thus, we believed we 
converged on a set of concerns that were relevant and might 
be profitably tested with reference to the experience of a larger 
sample of practitioners.  
It is not uncommon for surveys to use both forward and 
reverse-keyed versions of items to control for possible 
acquiescence bias. However, Sonderen et al. [28] and 
Schriesheim & Hill [29] argue that there is little  empirical 
evidence to support this recommendation and demonstrate 
that it can increase respondent confusion and introduce 
difficulties in interpretation. Since reverse-keying effectively 
doubles the size of a survey, which would have a negatively 
effect on sample size, it was not used here. Hence, we opted 
for one item per proposition.  
B. Participants and recruitment 
The target population for the survey was UX/IxD 
practitioners. 
Respondents 
were 
recruited 
by 
non-
probabilistic convenience sampling via invitations to online 
interest groups, and by snowball sampling via the researchers’ 
professional networks. The requirement of working as a 
UX/IxD practitioner was included in invitations. Respondents

were asked to give job titles as part of the survey and these 
were subsequently reviewed for relevance prior to analysis.

C. Data Analysis 
Responses to each Likert item were coded on a scale of 1 
to 5 where 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 
= agree, 5 = strongly agree. For each item, a lower bound one-
sample, one-tailed sign test was performed to assess 
agreement according to the following hypotheses: 
 
H0: The population median response is equal to or 
less than ‘neutral’ (η<=3) (i.e., non-agreement) 
 
H1: The population median response is greater than 
‘neutral’ (η> 3) (i.e., agreement) 
Given the multiple tests, Benjamini and Hochberg [30] 
was used to control for inflated type I error rate (αadjusted 
=.040625). The odds ratio (OR) (an unstandardized effect size 
statistic) was also computed for each item and used to 
organize the responses in terms of strength of expressed 
opinion.

TABLE II.  FACTOR LOADINGS AND COMMUNALITIES BASED ON A PAF WITH OBLIMIN ROTATION FOR THE RESPONSE ITEM 
 
We used an EFA with Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) 
since PAF holds no assumption about the distribution of the 
data. The following steps were followed to ensure that validity 
and reliability of the final solution. 
The survey data fulfilled the following suitability criteria:  
1. Data on each item showed a correlation of at least 0.3 with 
at least one other item; 
2. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure was 0.746 (greater that 
0.6), and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (χ2 
(120) = 435.131, p < .001);  
3. The anti-image correlation matrix diagonals were all 
greater than 0.5;  
4. The communalities were all above 0.3 except for A16, 
confirming that each Ak except k=16 shared some 
common variance with other items. 
The second step was to decide the number of factors and 
rotation method. Initial eigen values were examined indicating 
that the first three factors explained 29%, 15%, and 10% of 
the variance respectively whilst the fourth and fifth factors had 
eigen values of just over 1, explaining 7% and 6% of the 
variance respectively. Also, the solutions for 3, 4 and 5 factors 
were each examined using varimax and oblimin of the factor 
loading matrix to interpret any correlation between the factors.  
A three-factor solution, explaining 54% of the variance 
and using the oblimin rotation, was chosen given: ‘leveling 
off’ of eigen values on the Scree Plot after three factors; an 
inadequate number of primary loadings; difficulty in 
interpreting the fourth and fifth factor; and correlations 
between factors (0.3) i.e. F1, F3 (r=.39) and F2, F3 (r=.312).  
A16 (‘Personas I use are usually well formed and adequate.’) 
was eliminated since it failed to meet criterion of a min 
primary factor loading of .35 or above. A6 and A1 were 
retained even though both contributed to two factors. A6 
(‘Collaborating around personas is difficult’) had a factor 
loading of 0.412 on F2 (resources for creating personas) and -
0.366 on F1 (benefits of personas). One explanation for this is 
that practitioners see collaboration as a needed resource that 
presents a challenge from the perspective of persona creation. 
And from the perspective of practitioners’ use, collaboration 
is not a persona benefit because it is difficult to apply. A1 
(‘Personas I create/use are time consuming’) had a factor 
loading of 0.382 on F2 (relating to creating personas) and 0.38 
on F3 (relating to the representation of personas. This was 
explained given that the question asked about “create/use” and 
the percentage of practitioners who create personas was 46% 
versus 54% who use them.  
A PAF of the remaining 15 items using oblimin rotations 
was conducted, with three factors explaining 56% of the 
variance. Most items had primary loadings above 0.5 except 
for A7 and A15. A1 and A6 had cross-loadings into two 
factors (as explained above). The pattern loading matrix is 
presented in Table II with items presented in descending order 
of factor loading to indicate strength and direction with respect 
to factor. The 3 persona factors were named as follows:

item (A7) negatively. The descending order of the factor

      The reliability of the solution was tested by checking 
internal consistency of items in each factor. Cronbach’s alpha 
of the 3 factors was good: personas benefits (6 items, =.788), 
persona resources (6 items, =.765), and persona pitfalls (5 
items, =.743). For the first factor, A6 was recoded to remove 
negative correlation. No substantial increases in alpha for 
factors could be achieved by eliminating more items.  The 
fourth step computed the composite scores (Table IV) for each 
factor based on weight sum score of the items and loadings on 
each factor according to the following equation: 
 
 
 
where it = items in each factor, FL = Factor Loading, S = 
Score. 
     The results of the correlation matrix in TABLE III. along 
the composite scores in Table IV showed that UX/ID 
practitioners feel more strongly about the following factors. 
1. Persona resources was the highest factor, had a left-
skewed distribution (Table IV), and was positively 
correlated (r0.3) with Persona pitfalls (Table III). This 
indicates that practitioners tend to think that persona 
resources are ranked first, and an increase in negative 
attitude towards persona pitfalls is likely to occur with an 
increase in negative attitude towards of Persona 
resources. 
2. Personas benefits was the second highest factor, had a left-
skewed distribution (Table IV) and was negatively 
correlated (r=-0.39) with persona pitfalls (Table III). This 
indicates that practitioners tend to think that benefits of 
personas come a close second, and an increase in negative 
attitude towards persona pitfalls is likely to occur with the 
decrease in positive attitudes to persona benefits. 
3. Persona pitfalls was the third with normal distribution 
(Table IV), indicating that practitioners tend to think last 
about the pitfalls which tends to correlate with the 
previous two factors. 
2) Attitudes towards Personas 
We report responses to the items in the persona survey, 
including results of a one-sample sign test used to assess 
agreement with each proposition. In each of the bar charts 
(Figure 1─16), the left end of the red arrow indicates the lower 
bound of the 95% confidence interval and the dot indicates the 
estimated population median (note that in a number of cases 
these coincide).  
 
A1: Personas are time-consuming to create/use  
Figure 1 shows that the attitudes to this item were mostly 
positive with median and mode of 4. 62% responded on the 
'agree' side of neutral (4 or 5) and 25% responded on the 
'disagree' side of neutral (1 or 2). A one-tailed sign test was 
highly significant (p=.0004 and p-adjusted=0.03125) 
supporting H1 (agreement). The odds ratio was 2.5.  
Conclusion: Practitioners tend to agree that personas are  
time-consuming to create/use. 
 
A2: Personas are expensive to create/use 
Figure 2 shows that the attitudes to this item were fairly 
even around neutral with a median of 3 and mode of 4. 34% 
responded on the 'agree' side of neutral (4 or 5) and 25% 
responded on the 'disagree' side of neutral (1 or 2). A one-
tailed sign test was non-significant (1-tailed p=.7052 and p-
adjusted=0.046875) supporting H0 (non-agreement). The 
odds ratio was 0.9.

DESCENDING ORDER OF OR RATIOS. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
Existing 
studies 
on 
personas 
are 
typically 
qualitative/ethnographic or case studies. They tend to involve 
small samples of practitioners with findings developed 
inductively. These studies are valuable for raising issues, but 
generalization can be difficult. Also, the claims in the 
literature are diffused, uncorroborated, and cannot be 
prioritized. The study reported here addresses these issues by 
providing a quantitative analysis of the views of a large 
number of practitioners. 
The results show that persona use is quite prevalent 
amongst IxD/UX practitioners, particularly to capture the 
results of user research, but also to support design activities 
and to some extent, to support evaluation. We group attitudes 
into 3 dimensions (in order of importance): persona resources, 
persona benefits, and persona pitfalls. There was a weak 
negative correlation between persona resources and persona 
benefits, an acceptable negative correlation between persona 
benefits and persona pitfalls and an acceptable positive 
correlation between persona resources and persona pitfalls. 
The survey showed that IxD/UX practitioners saw six 
kinds of resources as being consumed by personas with their 
order of importance indicated in Table VI. These findings 
provide a foundation for issues that might have the most 
impact when considering things like training needs, the design 
of persona creation methods and the design of persona support 
tools. Financial costs have also been considered a significant 
resource costs in the literature, and yet practitioners had an 
overall neutral opinion towards it. This might be explained by 
the fact that practitioners are more directly affected by time 
implications than they are by decisions about budgets. 
In terms of persona benefits, practitioners tend to perceive 
six items with their order of importance indicated in  
Table VI and collaboration (although not significant for 
reasons explained earlier) affecting benefits negatively. Our 
findings on benefits of personas are similar to others and 
subset of the findings in [8]. Yet, our three highest ranked 
benefits did not show a difference in opinions between 
creators and users of personas as suggested by [12][14][18]. 
These findings indicate that personas are perceived as 
beneficial for practitioners (creators and users) despite 
resource concerns and this could provide implications for the 
priority of benefits that we need our future approaches to focus 
on. 
Practitioners often had strong opinions about challenges 
that they face with personas. They tend to perceive five kinds 
of persona pitfalls. The literature has briefly addressed and 
introduced these (Table VI), but we wanted to explore if these 
pitfalls are common among practitioners. Our results show 
that there is one remarkably high ranked pitfall, which is that 
personas and often not properly used by teams, followed by 
time required to create them (also found under resources) and 
other relatively low ranked attitudes in terms of importance. 
As noted, time was also found under resources and this could 
be due to ambiguity in the stated term “time consuming to 
create/ use”, which may have been perceived as a resource for 
the creator, but a pitfall among persona users. This major 
finding indicates a need for design team members to work 
together around personas and for this to be addressed in 
methods and tools. Although collaboration was not explicitly 
addressed in literature, it was evident in some of the suggested 
persona development methods and practitioners had an overall 
neutral opinion towards it. This might be explained, not by a 
lack of collaboration difficulties, but by a lack of 
collaboration. 
In future work, we plan to follow up on the findings 
reported here by exploring them more deeply in an interview 
study with IxD/UX practitioners and to use the findings to 
support the identification of requirements for persona creation 
tools. And as educators, given that personas are usually 
perceived as beneficial in the UCD, we would do well to 
continue to include personas in our university syllabi but to 
find approaches that overcome or at least educate students 
about the challenges of resources and common pitfalls.
