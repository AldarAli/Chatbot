Abstract — Nowadays, linkage of BPMN 2.0 business process 
models with ontologies to achieve consistency and semantic 
compatibility is still a challenge. This paper addresses a 
question of finding BPMN 2.0 meta-model compatible upper 
ontology for the analysis of the completeness of BPMN 2.0 
model. Upper ontologies are meta-structures for domain 
ontologies and based on the correspondence between BPMN 
2.0 meta-model and upper ontology a link between BPMN 2.0 
models and domain ontology can be provided. A comparison of 
5 existing upper ontologies showed that the Bunge-Wand-
Weber ontology is the most compatible with the BPMN 2.0 
meta-model.

 INTRODUCTION 
Business processes are one of the most valuable assets of 
any organization. Business processes require applying 
existing business process knowledge. According to Grant 
[1], knowledge is the most strategically important resource 
of the firm and primary role of any organization is 
application of knowledge in its everyday activities. However, 
the application of existing knowledge has always been a 
sophisticated task. A holistic view of end-to-end business 
process knowledge is required because knowledge of cross-
functional processes is distributed across departments, 
documents, regulations and applications. Different stand-
alone applications and documents contain explicit process 
knowledge and tacit knowledge is “stored” in heads of 
employees. Business process knowledge must be reusable 
and applicable across many business processes. 
According to Xiao et al. [2], ontologies use a formal way 
to represent knowledge as a set of concepts and relationships 
among the concepts. As described by Xiao et al. [2]  
ontologies are widely used for knowledge representation and 
sharing. There exist many definitions about what ontology is; 
however, in the scope of this paper, ontology is a formal 
specification of a shared conceptualization, as described by 
Gomez-Perez et al. [3]. According to Gomez-Perez et al. [3], 
there exist different types of ontologies identified in the 
literature based on their conceptualization.  
Ontologies exist at several levels of abstraction. 
According to Semy et al. [4], upper ontology is defined as a 
high-level, domain-independent ontology from which more 
domain-specific ontologies may be derived. Domain 
ontologies are reusable in a given specific domain (e.g., 
medical, law, enterprise, engineering, etc.) providing 
vocabularies about the activities taking place in that domain 
and their relationships, as described by Gomez-Perez et al. 
[3]. As described by Mascardi et al. [5] upper ontology 
contains general concepts that are the same across all 
domains. Thus, upper ontology can be used as a meta-
structure for defining domain ontologies. 
Motivation for this research is described as follows. 
BPMN 2.0 (or Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 [6]) 
is the de-facto standard for representing in a very expressive 
graphical way the processes occurring in virtually every kind 
of organization, as described by Chinosi et al. [7]. However, 
the goal of any modelling activity is a complete and accurate 
understanding of the real-world domain. Hence business 
process modelling requires a background knowledge e.g., 
domain ontology that complements behavioural aspect of an 
information system. Providing linkage between BPMN 2.0 
and domain ontology will facilitate consistency between 
information system models and domain requirements. 
Nowadays, linkage between BPMN 2.0 and domain 
ontology is still a challenge. However the new BPMN 2.0 
specification [6] allows integration with third party 
components using XML-based representation languages 
(e.g., OWL, RDF) [8]. This new BPMN 2.0 “plug-and-play” 
feature opens the potential for linking domain ontologies 
represented as XML structures with BPMN 2.0 models. But, 
firstly, it is necessary to provide consistency and semantic 
compatibility between BPMN 2.0 and ontology at the meta-
level, namely, linking BPMN 2.0 meta-model with upper 
ontology that is used as a basis for deriving domain 
ontology.  
Figure 1 depicts the idea of linking BPMN 2.0 process 
models with domain ontology that is based on compatibility 
between BPMN 2.0 meta-model and upper ontology that is 
used as a meta-structure for defining domain ontology. In 
order to implement the proposed approach for linking BPMN 
2.0 process models with domain ontology it is necessary to 
choose an upper ontology that is compatible with BPMN 2.0 
meta-model. The chosen BPMN 2.0 compatible upper 
ontology will be used as a meta-structure for deriving 
domain ontology that will be linked with BPMN 2.0 process 
models in order to sustain the consistency and semantic 
compatibility between business process models and 
ontology. Hence, the goal of this research is to choose a 
BPMN 2.0 meta-model compatible upper ontology by 
evaluating the most popular upper ontologies described in 
the literature.  
Linking BPMN 2.0 process models with domain 
ontology will contribute to:

RELATED WORKS 
Semy et al. [4] examine standard upper ontologies and 
assess their applicability for a U.S. Government or U.S. 
Military domain. In this research authors evaluate the state of 
the art and applicability of upper ontologies using 
consideration of the ontology purpose, ontological content 
decisions, licensing restrictions, structural differences, and 
maturity [4]. Mascardi et al. [5] are finding correspondences 
between entities belonging to different ontologies describing 
a set of algorithms that exploit upper ontologies. The 
analysis presented by Mascardi et al. [5] shows under which 
circumstances the exploitation of upper ontologies gives 
significant advantages with respect to traditional approaches 
that do not use them. 
 Mascardi et al. [9] are analysing 7 upper ontologies 
namely BFO, Cyc, DOLCE, GFO, PROTON, Sowa’s 
ontology and SUMO, according to a set of standard software 
engineering criteria. Rosemann et al. [10] address the issue 
of modelling information systems by presenting a meta 
model of the BWW ontology using a meta language that is 
familiar to information systems professionals facilitating the 
application of the BWW theory to other modelling 
techniques that have similar meta models defined. 
Francescomarino et al. [11] propose an automated 
technique to support the business designer both in domain 
ontology creation/extension and in the semantic annotation 
of process models expressed in BPMN 2.0. Natschläger et al. 
[12] present BPMN 2.0 ontology. The defined BPMN 2.0 
ontology can be used as a knowledge base for learning 
BPMN, as a syntax checker to validate separate BPMN 2.0 
models and to identify contradictions in specification. 
sBPM (or Semantic Business Process Management) was 
introduced to solve the problem of inconsistency between 
various process models in a domain using semantic 
annotating of process models with concepts from ontology. 
That facilitates reusing of process model parts and 
unambiguity of the domain concepts. Francescomarino et al. 
[13] show how semantic web techniques can be applied to 
formalize, verify and integrate the domain knowledge in 
BPMN 1.1 diagrams. Wang et al. [14] propose the approach 
of ontological descriptions of semantics of supply chain 
processes. Nicola et al. [15] propose the approach of 
representing a BPMN diagram by using ontology based 
formalism. 
The SUPER EU project (or Semantics Utilised for 
Process Management within and between Enterprises) 
created the technological framework constituting BPM 
enriched with machine readable semantics by employing 
Semantic Web technology [16]. 
This research is based on the results of related works and 
related works have encouraged this research and showed that 
linkage between BPMN 2.0 and ontologies is an important 
issue to facilitate information system modelling consistent 
with the real-world domain. However, to the best of author’s 
knowledge there is no research that compares existing upper 
ontologies for the compatibility with BPMN 2.0 meta-model.  
III. 
PROCEDURE FOR COMPARISON OF UPPER 
ONTOLOGIES 
To compare existing upper ontologies and choose upper 
ontology compatible with BPMN 2.0, the following steps 
were carried out: 
 
During the mapping of BPMN 2.0 elements to 
elements of upper ontologies the correspondence 
link MAPS introduced by Etien et al. [17] has been 
applied. Etien et al. [17] define two correspondence 
links - MAPS and REPRESENTS, MAPS link was 
selected because it is defined as following: “one 
class X maps another class Y if there exist an 
isomorphism between the set of properties of X. In 
other terms, each property of X corresponds to one 
of Y even (domains being eventually different).” 
REPRESENTS link is defined as an association when 
two constructs of different nature can be linked. In 
this research MAPS link is applied to obtain an upper 
ontology that is compatible with BPMN 2.0. 
 
Meta-model for BPMN 2.0 analytical level or level 
2, as defined by Silver [8], is created using UML

class diagram. BPMN 2.0 meta-model is built to use 
it as a base for comparison of upper ontologies. 
 
Candidate upper ontologies are chosen based on 
whether upper ontology is free to use and whether 
upper ontology is still being maintained. 
 
Meta-models for chosen upper ontologies are created 
using UML class diagrams in order to explicitly 
compare them with created BPMN 2.0 meta-model. 
 
A table showing compatibility between chosen upper 
ontologies and BPMN 2.0 meta-model is presented. 
 
The upper ontology the meta-model of which 
supports all main BPMN 2.0 elements is chosen.  
IV. 
BPMN 2.0 
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0) [6] is 
the de-facto standard for representing in a very expressive 
graphical way the business processes occurring in virtually 
every kind of organization, as described by Chinosi et al. [7]. 
BPMN 2.0 core elements can be grouped in the following 
groups of elements [6]: 
1. Swimlanes – pools and lanes allow grouping BPMN 
2.0 model elements according to participants of the process, 
information systems, organization structure, etc. 
2. Flows – message and sequence flows between BPMN 
2.0 elements. 
3. Data – data in BPMN 2.0 is represented through data 
objects and data stores. 
4. Flow objects – events, activities, and gateways are 
main BPMN 2.0 flow objects.  
According to Silver [8] BPMN 2.0 allows integrating 
business process model with third party components (e.g., 
database, web services etc.). BPMN 2.0 defines formal 
mechanisms to link business process data with a process 
model using XML Schema Definition language (XSD) or 
Web Service Definition language (WSDL), as described by 
Silver [8]. BPMN 2.0 allows linking, sharing and re-using 
existing business process data across BPMN 2.0 models. 
This BPMN 2.0 feature can be extended to provide not only 
process data linkage with a BPMN 2.0 model, but also 
linking a domain ontology with a BPMN 2.0 model to enable 
semantic compatibility and consistency between process 
models and domain ontology. To achieve this linkage it is 
necessary to represent domain ontology as a BPMN 2.0 
compatible structure in order to be able to associate it with 
related BPMN 2.0 model elements. 
Based on a method described in Section II, in this 
section, a simplified BPMN 2.0 level 2 (as defined by Silver 
[8]) meta-model is presented in Figure 2. 
V. 
UPPER ONTOLOGIES 
The concepts expressed in upper ontologies are basic and 
universal concepts and are used to ensure generality and, for 
a wide range of domains, represent common sense. 
Two main parameters were established for choosing 
candidate upper ontologies - openness of upper ontology 
(meaning whether ontology is free available) and continuing 
development of upper ontology (whether upper ontology is 
still maintained). Based on these criteria the following 5 
upper ontologies were chosen for the assessment: 
 
Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) [18] 
 
Sowa’s Top level ontology, as described by Sowa 
[19] 
 
Bunge-Wand-Weber ontology (BWW), as described 
by Allen et al. [20] 
 
Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) [21] 
 
Cyc’s Upper Ontology [22].

genuine upper ontology which can be used in support of 
domain ontologies [18]. BFO consists in a series of sub-
ontologies but in this research the upper ontology of BFO is 
addressed. Figure 3 represents BFO upper ontology meta-
model created using UML class diagram.  
At the core of BFO consists of is Entity. Entities are 
either continuants or occurrents. A continuant is something 
existing at an instant in time, an occurrent is something that 
has temporal parts. A spatial region is three-dimensional. A 
processual entity is something that occurs or happens.  
B. Sowa’s Top Level Ontology 
Sowa’s top level ontology includes the basic categories 
and distinctions that have been derived from a variety of 
sources in logic, linguistics, philosophy and artificial 
intelligence, as described by Gomez-Perez et al. [3]. Sowa’s 
top-level ontology includes 12 central categories which are 
generated from primitive categories. Figure 4 represents 
Sowa’s top level ontology meta-model created using UML 
class diagram. 
C. BWW Ontology 
Rosemann et al. [10] describe BWW ontology as useful 
for description of information systems. As described by 
Davies et al. [23] an ontology presented by Bunge has been 
extended and applied to the modelling of information 
systems. Figure 5 represents BWW Ontology meta-model 
created using UML class diagram. 
D. SUMO Ontology 
The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO) [21] is 
an upper level ontology that has been proposed as a starter 
document for The Standard Upper Ontology Working 
Group, an IEEE-sanctioned working group [24] of 
collaborators from the fields of engineering, philosophy, and 
information science, as described by Niles et al. [25]. Figure 
6 represents SUMO meta-model created using UML class 
diagram. 
E.  Cyc’s Upper Ontology 
Cyc’s Upper Ontology is contained in the Cyc 
Knowledge Base, which holds huge amount of common 
sense knowledge, as described by Gomez-Perez et al. [3]. 
According to Mascardi et al. [9], the Cyc Knowledge Base is 
a formalized representation of facts, rules of thumb, and 
heuristics for reasoning about the objects and events of 
everyday life. Figure 7 represents Cyc’s Upper Ontology 
meta-model created using UML class diagram.

processes. 
VI. 
COMPARISON OF UPPER ONTOLOGIES FOR 
COMPATIBILITY WITH BPMN 2.0 
This section presents a comparison of upper ontologies 
for their compatibility with BPMN 2.0 meta-model. The 
analysis is presented in a Table I showing which elements of 
upper ontologies described in Section V correspond to 
BPMN 2.0 meta-model elements. 
From Table I, the following can be concluded: 
 
BWW upper ontology supports most of the 
presented BPMN 2.0 elements.  
 
SUMO upper ontology is not compatible with 
BPMN 2.0 meta-model because one of the most 
important notions of process modelling - the Event 
notion - is not supported by SUMO upper ontology. 
 
BPMN 2.0 meta-model element Gateway is 
supported only by BWW upper ontology with its 
State Law element which restricts the values of the 
properties of a thing to a subset that is deemed

According to Silver [8], a Gateway element in 
BPMN 
2.0 
has 
conditions

controlling the flow of the process. 
 
BPMN 2.0 elements Process, Subprocess, Activity, 
Call Activity, Loop Activity, Compensation, and Task 
are supported by all reviewed upper ontologies. 
 
For particular BPMN 2.0 elements relationship to 
upper ontology elements is 1 to many - one BPMN 
2.0 element can be associated with several upper 
ontology elements, e.g., BPMN 2.0 Event element 
can be mapped to BFO ontology elements 
ProcessBoundary, 
TemporalRegion 
and 
ConnectedTemporalRegion. 
 
BPMN 2.0 element Loop Activity is supported only 
by BFO ontology, which defines ProcessualContext 
element as “(..) consisting of a characteristic spatial 
shape inhering in some arrangement of other 
occurrent entities” [18]. 
 
Some elements of upper ontologies are not 
represented in BPMN 2.0 meta-model. 
Based on the comparison presented in Table I, BWW 
upper ontology is concluded to be the upper ontology 
supporting BPMN 2.0 meta-model at most.  
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In order to link BPMN 2.0 models with domain ontology 
to provide consistency it is necessary to ensure compatibility 
between BPMN 2.0 meta-model and upper ontology that 
domain ontology is derived from. The paper presented a 
comparison of existing upper ontologies in order to choose 
BPMN 2.0 meta-model compatible upper ontology. As a 
result BWW upper ontology was concluded to be BPMN 2.0 
compatible upper ontology supporting most of the basic 
BPMN 2.0 elements. 
By linking BPMN 2.0 process models with domain 
ontology, the enterprise may achieve the consistency and 
semantic compatibility between process models and existing 
ontology. This will help business process modellers across 
organization to identify, share and reuse existing knowledge 
explicitly and conduct qualitative process analysis to make 
decisions concerning new process development. With 
ontologies supplying the context of process, this contextual 
information can be exploited to perform semantic analyses of 
the process. 
Practical implications of the presented research can be 
summarized as follows. Connecting BPMN 2.0 models with 
ontology will contribute to more precise requirements 
definition and possibly reducing the time of development 
and implementation of changes. The BWW representation 
might be used to analyse the completeness of BPMN 2.0 for 
software requirements. 
However, the BWW ontology does not fully comply with 
the BPMN 2.0 meta-model. In the future research 
extensions of BWW and BPMN 2.0 will be addressed to 
tackle this issue. The author does not propose a new custom 
upper ontology, because the reviewed upper ontologies are 
largely recognized, especially BWW ontology in the IS 
modelling domain, as described by Rosemann et al. [10].   
The conducted research has mostly been of a purely 
theoretical nature. Technical linkage and consistency 
checking between BPMN 2.0 and upper ontology is a 
concern of further research. The future work will also 
address 
building 
of 
algorithms 
for 
evaluating 
the 
completeness of business process models based on the 
metrics developed by Etien and Rolland [17]. The future 
research includes development of the prototype of the 
proposed solution using existing Open Source solutions, as 
well as validation of the implemented prototype in the real 
information systems projects.   
In the future work implementation of the proposed 
approach will be addressed by using BPMN 2.0 existing 
capability to connect to third party components (e.g., to 
connect to domain ontology represented as a XML based 
structure - OWL). The paper has some limitations, namely, 
no verification or test for validity of this mapping is 
considered, which will be addressed in the future research.
