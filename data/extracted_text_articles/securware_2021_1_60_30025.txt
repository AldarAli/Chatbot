Abstract—The smart home is among the emerging technologies
designed to improve in-house quality of life by supplying many
services, such as home automation, healthcare, and energy man-
agement. Recent cyberattacks on smart homes affecting home
dwellers’ privacy, safety, and security could slow down smart
homes’ adoption. To identify smart-home attack surfaces, we
propose to use a risk analysis method called Expression of Needs
and Identification of Security Objectives - Expression des Besoins
et Identification des Objectifs de S´ecurit´e (EBIOS) Risk Manager
to evaluate the threat level of smart-home stakeholders in the role
of threat agents. The contributions of this paper are assessing
smart-home stakeholders and identifying attack scenarios in
which they could be involved to extend the reflection on smart
home security. We are the first to estimate the threat level
of fourteen smart-home stakeholders through assessing many
metrics. We use a 5-point Likert scale to collect data from security
professionals to conduct this assessment. We classify the smart-
home stakeholders into various threat zones and find that smart-
home inhabitants and home automation service providers have
the highest threat agent levels. This investigation will contribute
to designing security systems and policies for strengthening the
smart-home ecosystem’s security.

I. INTRODUCTION
A smart home is an Internet of Things (IoT) application that
promotes technology-based living places. It includes various
technologies such as devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, multi-
media), networking (e.g., wireless, wired), mobile and web
applications, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence [1]
[2]. Statista estimates that the worldwide revenue of smart
homes, US$78.9 billion in 2020, will increase to US$182.3
billion by 2025 [3]. This technology-based home attracts
considerably, not only normal users, but also attackers. Recent
cyberattacks exploiting home devices have revealed security
risk concerns in smart homes [4] [5]. Hence, carrying out a
risk assessment becomes necessary to identify and address the
security flaws in smart homes to withstand future cyberattacks.
Recent research have shown interests in the risk assessment
of the smart home security. Jacobsson et al. [6] propose an
empirical evaluation and scenario-based study. Wongvises et
al. [7] propose a Fault Tree Analysis to quantify security risks.
Most studies have only focused on assets such as devices and
networks. However, Cherdantseva et al. [8] emphasize that a
risk assessment needs to include stakeholders to provide a
complete set of risks. As stated in International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) 27005, a stakeholder is a “person
or organization that can affect, be affected by, or perceive
themselves to be affected by a decision or activity [9].” To
the best of our knowledge, prior work have not focused on
smart-home stakeholders-based threat analysis so far. As men-
tioned by Bregman [10], the smart home intelligence requires
developers, suppliers, and users to cooperate, specifically to
transfer information. If one or many of these stakeholders
get compromised by attackers or fail to secure information
transmission, the smart home security could be affected. Stake-
holders play an essential role in the smart home operations
and could, without realizing it, contribute to the fulfillment
of attack scenarios. Securing a smart home could require
a deep understanding of every stakeholder connected to the
smart home. Therefore, an assessment of how easy it is for an
attacker to exploit a stakeholder to conduct a cyberattack on
a smart home may provide security perspectives to reduce the
attack surfaces.
Our approach uses EBIOS Risk Manager, referred to as
EBIOS RM. It is a method based on the risk analysis and
management methodology called EBIOS, which has proven to
be effective for risk management in critical information infras-
tructures [11]. Furthermore, it includes stakeholder analysis.
The main contributions of this research are as follow:
• We introduce stakeholder-based risk analysis for smart
home security.
• We evaluate the threat level associated with smart-home
stakeholders to identify strategic scenarios that attackers
could exploit.
• We propose an approach of threat classification for risk
managers and compare our results with two other classi-
fication methods, including the EBIOS RM’s.
• We identify and describe potential high-level attack sce-
narios that could involve smart-home stakeholders.
We organize the rest of the paper as follows: Section II
describes the related work. Section III introduces EBIOS RM.
Section IV analyzes the threat level of smart-home stakehold-
ers using EBIOS RM. Section V discusses our results. Section
VI concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
This section presents previous work on smart home and
stakeholder security risks.
A. Smart-Home Security Risk
Wongvises et al. [7] use Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to
quantify security risks in a smart home. They show that
security risks in smart homes might be high through the
31

assessment of lighting systems. Ali et al. [12] use Opera-
tionally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation
(OCTAVE) Allegro to analyze information security risks in
smart homes. The authors identify ten critical information as-
sets (e.g., user credentials, log information, mobile application
data, and various smart home-related information) and evaluate
the risk scores associated with these information assets. We
note that the paper does not present the calculation of risk
scores. Kavallieratos et al. [13] use the Spoofing, Tampering,
Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Eleva-
tion of privilege (STRIDE) model to identify threats to smart
homes. They identify threats that relate to devices such as
IP cameras, smartphones, and alarm systems. The paper does
not evaluate the threat levels. Jacobsson et al. [6] evaluate the
risk exposure of a smart home by applying the Information
Security Risk Analysis (ISRA) approach described in [14].
They used a questionnaire to collect the opinions of nine
participants, including security experts, domain experts, and
system developers of smart homes. The authors recognize that
third-party stakeholders can access the whole smart home and
collect private data on inhabitants.
The previous work show that risk assessment is essential
to address smart home security. Furthermore, we can notice a
lack of study on stakeholders assessment whereas Bregman
[10] shows that they play a critical role in a smart-home
environment.
B. Stakeholder Security Risk
Grimble et al. [15] describe stakeholder analysis as a
powerful tool for policy analysis and formulation that help
understanding a system, and changes in it, by identifying and
assessing key actors or stakeholders. Stakeholder assessments
have been explored in many areas, such as human resource
development, business management, or natural resource man-
agement [16]. However, the related papers in the cybersecurity
area are limited. Mollaeefar et al. [17] propose a multi-
stakeholder cybersecurity risk assessment for data protection.
They focus their research on the estimation of the relation
between the impact levels and risk exposures. We note that
they consider the likelihood as the same for every stakeholder.
Even if this consideration could be effective in the proposed
configuration, it cannot be realistic in many areas, such as a
smart home where stakeholders have various interests, inten-
tions, and behaviors.
The limitations mentioned above motivate us to leverage
a risk analysis method that complies with international cy-
bersecurity standards and includes identifying and evaluating
security issues associated with stakeholders. To the best of our
knowledge, the related work has not explored this perspective.
In this research, we adopt the EBIOS RM method to identify
and assess the threat level of threat agents (stakeholders).
III. RESEARCH METHOD
This section presents the background of EBIOS RM, the
method used in this research.
A. Method
We often express information security risk as a combination
of the consequences (impacts) of an information security event
and the associated likelihood of occurrence [9]. This research
focuses on the likelihood assessment, and we use EBIOS
RM to evaluate the threat level of stakeholders in the role of
threat agents. We choose EBIOS RM because it is a flexible
method covering any system, regardless of its size and sector
of activity and whether it is under development or already
developed. Furthermore, unlike most qualitative risk analysis
methods, EBIOS RM introduces a new calculation of the threat
level and an approach to identify and evaluate threat agents
and attack scenarios.
Note that EBIOS is a methodology that was created in
1995 for risk management of information system security. It is
maintained by the National Cybersecurity Agency of France -
Agence Nationale de la S´ecurit´e des Syst`emes d’Information
(ANSSI) with the support of Club EBIOS [18]. This method-
ology is a comprehensive tool that complies with security
management policies and international standards such as ISO
27001, 27005, and 31000. Furthermore, it was used to address
risk management in critical information infrastructures [11]
and we believe it could be effective for a critical environment
such as a smart home where the absence of dedicated cyber-
security teams to support home users could facilitate attackers
activities to access users’ privacy.
B. EBIOS Risk Manager
Available since 2018, the so-called EBIOS Risk Manager
(EBIOS RM) is the latest version of the EBIOS methodology.
This method is iterative and includes two approaches: An
approach through “conformity” that identifies the security
baseline and through “scenarios” that analyzes potential attack
scenarios based on the point of view of attackers. EBIOS RM
comprises five workshops described as follows.
1) Workshop 1 (scope and security baseline): This workshop
aims to identify the scope of our study, its assets, and
its primary missions. Then, it determines the severity of
feared events associated with its assets.
2) Workshop 2 (risk origins): The second workshop aims to
identify the RO/TO pairs. This pair comprises risk origins
(RO) and their high-level targets, namely target objectives
(TO).
3) Workshop 3 (strategic scenarios): This workshop includes
the threat level assessment, establishes a mapping of
threat agents, and provides high-level scenarios, called
strategic scenarios. These scenarios describe the attack
paths a risk origin could use to reach its target objective.
4) Workshop 4 (operational scenarios): The purpose is to
define technical scenarios that include the methods of
attack that risk origins can use to carry out the strategic
scenarios. This workshop also assesses the risk of each
operational scenario.
5) Workshop 5 (risk treatment): In this workshop, the goal
is to summarize all the identified risks, then define a risk

treatment strategy. This workshop ends with a summary
of the residual risks and the framework for monitoring
risks.
Figure 1 shows the general flow of EBIOS RM. It presents
two risk management cycles. The strategic cycle includes
every workshop, and the operational relates only to Workshop
3, Workshop 4, and Workshop 5. We can see that Workshop
3 plays an indispensable role that consists of assessing threat
agents and determining scenarios involving these agents. Fur-
thermore, this workshop provides most of the information
required to identify the operational scenarios (Workshop 4)
and the appropriate risk treatment (Workshop 5).
We will focus exclusively on the first three workshops
because our purpose is to evaluate the threat level of smart-
home stakeholders.
IV. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
This section describes the participants of the study and
presents data collection and analysis.
A. Participants
In total, 17 participants (Academic Researcher (11.8%),
Cybersecurity Specialist (29.4%), Chief Information Security
Officer (5.9%), and IT Department/Information Management
Team (52.9%)) responded to our survey questionnaire. Fur-
thermore, 47.1%, 47.1%, and 5.8% of participants have respec-
tively less than 5 years, between 5-10 years, and more than 10
years of experience in cybersecurity. 76.5% of participants are
certified in one or many certifications: Cisco Certified Network
Associate (CCNA), Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Certified
Information Security Manager (CISM), Certified Information
Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Control Objectives for
Information and Related Technology (COBIT) 5 Foundation,
ISO 27001, Information Technology Infrastructure Library
(ITIL) V3, ITIL V4. These certifications are attributed to
individuals who can distinguish IT services, analyze and
mitigate risks, understand cyberattack methods, design security
countermeasures, and prevent unauthorized intruders from
accessing network systems.
We also interacted directly in private messages with six re-
spondents who wanted to get more details in our research. Four
of them were security professionals who wanted to confirm
that our study is real and legitimate. The two others were
IoT/smart home professionals who informed us that they do
not have the required skills for risk analysis. In a nutshell, the
participants are likely to be qualified and experienced enough
to assess the security of complex IT systems. Therefore, we
assume that they are all eligible to evaluate the threat level of
smart-home stakeholders.
B. Data Collection
We created an online Google Form and carried out the
survey questionnaire over two weeks through two primary
social networking services: LinkedIn for professionals and
researchers and ResearchGate for academic researchers. We
choose this short period of time to prevent eligible individuals
to repeatedly take the only form and ineligible individuals
to fill out the form. Our target was to reach cybersecurity
professionals, top managers, and IoT/smart home specialists.
To ensure the representativeness of the sample, we identi-
fied several private groups on LinkedIn related to IoT secu-
rity/Cybersecurity, IoT/smart home professionals, risk man-
agers, and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
The survey questionnaire provided six pages for a total of
13 questions, including five grid questions, which can be filled
in 15-20 minutes. The questions we asked included:
C. Data Analysis
First, we asked the participants’ opinions regarding the
stakeholders we selected. To the question “Do you think
that these stakeholders are part of the smart home ecosys-
tem?”, more than 70% of participants responded “Yes, I

do” to 10 out of 14 propositions: Energy service provider
(76.5%), Healthcare service providers (76.5%), Home au-
tomation service providers (88.2%), Courier service providers
(23.5%), Network service providers (88.2%), IoT cloud service
providers (88.2%), Sensor/IoT device manufacturers (70.6%),
IoT application developers (88.2%), IoT/smart home regula-
tors (97.1%), Real estate agents (11.8%), Dwellers friends
(17.7%), Dwellers collaborators (11.8%), Smart home own-
ers (dwellers) (76.5%), and Other smart home inhabitants
(dwellers) (70.6%). We can see that three stakeholders,
i.e., Courier service providers, Real estate agents, Dwellers’
friends, and Dwellers’ collaborators, did not get many favor-
able votes.
Furthermore, we asked the participants: “Please rate the
Dependency, Penetration, Cyber Maturity, and Trust levels
between each stakeholder and the smart home on a scale of
1 to 5.” to measure the metrics recommended by EBIOS RM
and calculate the threat levels. We used a five-point Likert
scale to measure the participants’ responses. The choice of
this measure is motivated by Boone et al. [19], who stated
that if one designs a series of questions that, when combined,
measure a particular trait, then one has created a Likert scale.
In this case, the authors recommended the mean and standard
deviation to describe the scale.
V. THREAT LEVEL ASSESSMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS
This section describes the threat level assessment of smart-
home stakeholders using EBIOS RM.
A. Scope and Security Baseline
The scope of this investigation is about the smart-home
services (functions) that relate to stakeholders. According to
Mendes et al. [20], we can distinguish four functions (i.e.,
energy efficiency and management, healthcare, entertainment,
and security) in a smart home. The analysis of smart home
devices discussed in [21] guided us to consider five essential
functions in a smart home: energy management, safety and se-
curity, healthcare, home automation, and entertainment. These
functions could be associated with one or many feared events
(FEs). For each essential function identified, we associate the
feared events, their impacts, as well as their severity. Table I
summarizes each instance of severity.
Energy management: This function helps to avoid wasting
energy and to supply power when a power failure occurs.
• FEs: Triggering power outage, tampering consumed en-
ergy amount, and alteration of heating, ventilation, and
air conditioning. These FEs could impact the quality of
service (QoS), comfort, safety, security of dwellers, and
financial losses (Severity: S3 or S4).
Safety and security: The goal of this function is to ensure
data and information confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
• FEs: Disabling of alarm system, smart door lock, or
network security services, and detection of human activ-
ities by an attacker. These FEs could impact the QoS,
data security, privacy, safety, and security of dwellers
(Severity: S2, S3, or S4).
Healthcare: This function remotely monitors and manages
the health of dwellers in the smart home.
• FEs: Leaking medical data records of dwellers and al-
tering medical data records. These FEs could impact the
safety and privacy of dwellers and involve financial losses
(Severity: S3 or S4).
Home automation: Smart homes automate the in-home
daily tasks of dwellers. This function controls and manages the
smart home appliances. Furthermore, it automatically monitors
and manages dwellers’ activities in the smart home.
• FEs: Altering the automation configuration and remote
control by an attacker. These FEs could impact the com-
fort, privacy, safety, and security of dwellers (Severity:
S1, S2, or S3).
Entertainment: This function provides amusement mo-
ments (e.g., music, movies, games) to dwellers.
• FEs: Leaking personal data of dwellers. These FEs could
impact the safety and privacy of dwellers and involve
financial losses (Severity: S3 or S4).
Our research does not include the security baseline because
it is only necessary for risk treatment in Workshop 5, which is
beyond this research scope. However, it is essential to note that
the security baseline of smart homes may include ISO 27030
and ISO 24391, which are currently under development.
B. Risk Origins
Bugeja et al. [22] classify the attacker profiles into six
profiles: “State-related”, “terrorist”, “competitor and orga-
nized crime”, “hacktivist”, “thief”, and “hacker”. In addition
to this classification, we consider the “amateur” profile as
script kiddies who use malicious codes and programs created

by more experienced attackers, the “avenger” corresponding
to profiles in bad relations with smart home inhabitants. An
example of an avenger could be a disgruntled service provider.
Furthermore, we consider the “specialized outfits” profile as
cyber-mercenaries who are often at the origin of the design
and creation of attack kits and tools. Lastly, we consider the
“inadvertent attacker” profile as another risk origin because
many recent attacks were due to human errors [23].
Note, the target objectives of attacker profiles are mostly
well-known and could relate to challenges (e.g., fun, curiosity,
or social recognition), profit (e.g., moneymaking by selling
dwellers’ private information), spying (e.g., access to dwellers’
privacy), obstacle to functioning (e.g., making smart home
services unavailable), strategic pre-positioning (e.g., using
smart home devices to perform another attack–case of DDoS
attacks), or terrorism (e.g., impacting smart home dweller
security for political or economic purposes.).
Detecting risk origins (ROs) and target objectives (TOs)
led us to determine the most critical attacker profiles to
the smart home security. We assess the RO/TO pertinence
as described in Table II by relying on the motivation level
(i.e., very low, low, fair, or high) and potential financial,
technical, human, and time resources (i.e., limited, significant,
considerable, or unlimited) of attackers to compromise a smart
home. Based on this assessment, the most relevant ROs are
terrorists, specialized outfits, and States-related. Next, the least
relevant but pertinent ROs are thieves, hacktivists, hackers, and
competitors and organized crimes. Finally, the least pertinent
ROs are inadvertent attackers, avengers, and amateurs. We
will build the strategic scenarios on the most relevant ROs
and the smart-home stakeholders.
C. Strategic Scenarios
1) Smart-Home Stakeholders:
EBIOS RM recommends
distinguishing internal stakeholders to the system from the
externals to identify the stakeholders to be taken into ac-
count. Regarding the internal stakeholders, we decided to
choose dwellers, i.e., people living in smart homes. They
comprise smart-home owners and other smart-home inhabi-
tants such as children. About the external stakeholders, the
information collected in various academic papers [20] [24]–
[26], led us to consider service providers, manufacturers,
IoT developers, IoT/smart home regulators, real estate agents,
dwellers’ friends, and dwellers’ collaborators. Note that ser-
vices providers enrich smart homes with many services. They
are energy providers, home automation providers, healthcare
service providers, courier service providers, network service
providers, and IoT cloud service providers. Manufacturers
provide smart homes with actuators, sensors, and IoT devices.
Developers create web and mobile applications that control
one or more aspects of the smart home. Then, IoT or smart
home regulators contribute to ensuring the quality of services
by accreditation. Real estate agents encourage people that seek
new properties to buy smart homes. Home dwellers’ friends or
collaborators may have direct or indirect access, depending on
their intimacy with smart homes’ owners and other dwellers.
2) Assessment of Stakeholders: This assessment is based
on a formula recommended by EBIOS RM. The formula
comprises four metrics (i.e., Dependency, Penetration, Cyber
Maturity, and Trust). Dependency and Penetration represent
the level of exposure to the system. More specifically, De-
pendency evaluates the degree of relationship between the
stakeholder and the smart home. Penetration assesses how far
the stakeholder could access the smart home assets (including
physical and remote access). Then, Cyber Maturity and Trust
give information on cyber reliability. Cyber Maturity measures
the ability of stakeholders to understand and implement cyber-
security best practices in their daily activities. Trust measures
the level of confidence the system should have regarding the
intention of stakeholders. Each metric is scored on a scale
from 1 to 4. When the threat level score of threat agents
(stakeholders) is close or equal to 4, it is highly feasible that
an attacker exploits the related stakeholder to compromise a
smart home.
Threat Level = Dependency × Penetration
CyberMaturity × Trust
(1)
[18]
3) Measurement of Threat Levels: The EBIOS RM method
recommends an assessment on a scale of 1 to 4 for each metric:
Dependency, Penetration, Cyber Maturity, and Trust. As we
used a five-point Likert scale in our survey questionnaire, we
consider the participants’ evaluations in the range of 0 to 4

evaluate the threat level of each stakeholder using the obtained
means.
4) Threat Classification: It provides a clear insight into
how critical the threats are and contribute to prioritizing the
countermeasures. Table IV presents the results of threat level
assessments.
Figure 2 maps the threat levels of smart-home stakeholders
according to the classification provided by EBIOS RM, i.e.,
the danger (red) zone is determined by considering 10% of
the stakeholders with the highest threat levels. The control
(yellow) zone is determined by considering 40% of the fol-
lowing stakeholders. The watch (green) zone is determined
by considering 40% of the next stakeholders. The remaining

the danger zone contains Smart-homes owners (dwellers) and
Other smart-home inhabitants (dwellers). The watch zone
contains the other stakeholders.
Given that the EBIOS RM recommends a threat assessment
in the range 1-4, a simplified classification could follow this
pattern: Danger zone (3 ≤ Threat level ≤ 4); Control zone
(2 ≤ Threat level < 3); Watch zone (1 ≤ Threat level <
2); Out-of-scope (0 ≤ Threat level < 1). Figure 3 maps the
threat levels. According to this classification, the danger zone
contains Smart-home owners (dwellers) and Other smart-home
inhabitants (dwellers), the out-of-scope contains Dwellers
collaborators and IoT/smart home regulators. The watch zone

contains the other stakeholders.
We can notice that Figures 2 and 3 give different results.
Furthermore, they do not distribute the threats onto each threat
zone, which could be troublesome for decision-makers.
To cope with this limitation, we propose to use the Pareto
principle [27] to determine the threat zones associated with
each stakeholder. According to the Pareto principle or “80/20
rule”, only a few vital inputs contribute to the greatest outputs.
In our context, this principle contributes to identifying the
most critical stakeholders who represent 80% of the total
threats. Figure 4 presents a distinction between the critical
and non-critical threats using a Pareto chart. Our proposed
classification consists of iterating the Pareto Chart three times
to determine respectively the stakeholders included in the
following zones: out-of-scope, watch, control, and danger.
We present the first iteration in Figure 4. The non-critical
stakeholder obtained represents the out-of-scope. The second
iteration uses the critical stakeholders obtained in the first
iteration to identify the non-critical stakeholders included

in the watch zone. Then, the third iteration uses the criti-
cal stakeholders obtained in the second iteration to identify
the non-critical stakeholders included in the control zone.
Finally, the remaining critical stakeholders of the third it-
eration is included in danger zone. Figure 5 presents the
outcome when we classify the smart-home stakeholders per
threat zone using a three-level Pareto chart. The danger zone
contains Smart-homes owners (dwellers) and Other smart-
home inhabitants (dwellers), and Home automation service
providers. The control zone contains Energy service providers,
Dwellers friends, and Network service providers. The watch
zone contains Healthcare service providers, IoT application
developers, and IoT cloud service providers. The out-of-scope
contains Sensor/IoT device manufacturers and Courier service
providers, Real estate agents, IoT/smart home regulators, and
Dwellers collaborators.
We summarize and compare the results of each classification
method in Table V. The table illustrates that the Pareto-based
classification can distribute the stakeholders’ threats to every
threat zone identified. Hence, a three-level Pareto chart can

provide better results than the two other approaches.
5) Identification of Strategic Attack Scenarios: The attack
scenarios present briefly which attacker’s profile may want
to exploit a particular vulnerability in smart homes, for what
purpose, and how they can realize that. Table VI describes the
needed information (e.g., RO/TO pertinence, feared events,
and threat level) to identify three strategic attack scenarios.
Strategic attack scenario 1: Experienced hackers with
specialized outfits use social engineering techniques (e.g.,
phishing) to trick smart-home dwellers or their friends and
get unauthorized access to a smart home. The attackers could
sell their personal data or medical data records on the dark
web to make profit (Severity: S4).
Strategic attack scenario 2: Terrorists put many smart
homes out of service and spread fear among citizens by
disabling access to Internet-based services after attacking
network service providers or triggering power outages of
many smart homes simultaneously after compromising the
infrastructure of energy service providers (Severity: S4).
Strategic attack scenario 3: A government spies and gets
confidential and sensitive information on opposition leaders
or other state leaders to blackmail them for national secu-
rity, political or economic purposes. The state-related profile
performs the attack after taking advantage of the strategic po-
sitions of home automation service providers, network service
providers, and dwellers’ friends (Severity: S4).
Figure 6 summarizes the three strategic attack scenarios.
VI. DISCUSSION
There are no easy solutions when discussing the security
issues of complex systems such as smart homes. We are aware
of the importance of developing robust systems to empower
the security of home networks, mobile apps, and IoT software
and hardware. Furthermore, we believe that attackers are
continuously looking for weak links to achieve their ends. As
in the recent attacks on the European aerospace giant Airbus in
which attack scenarios first targeted Airbus’ suppliers (external
stakeholders) [28], attackers could take advantage of one or
many stakeholders to harm a smart home and its inhabitants.
Hence, to prevent such attack scenarios, we used EBIOS
RM to evaluate the threat levels to which an attacker could
compromise a smart-home stakeholder.
Threat level calculation: In our work, we have used the
threat level equation proposed by EBIOS RM to evaluate
the likelihood of threat agents. However, in risk assessment,
many authors estimate the likelihood without the use of an
equation. For example, Nurse et al. [29] used a 3-point Likert
scale to estimate the likelihood directly, without considering
an estimation of relevant metrics. As these authors mentioned,
it is difficult to estimate the likelihood of risks. We believe
that an approach, such as that of EBIOS RM, that evaluates
many metrics to calculate the likelihood may provide more
reliable results than a direct assessment. We encourage future
research to investigate and provide new metrics and equations
to estimate the likelihood of threat agents and cyberattacks in
qualitative risk assessment.
Threat level of stakeholders: Our results showed that the
security education of smart-home dwellers is crucial to reduce
attack scenarios targeting these internal stakeholders. Further-

more, there is an imperative necessity to set up a regulatory
agency to check on home automation service providers and the
other smart-home stakeholders to ensure they comply with the
security standards of smart homes for the benefit of all. This
cybersecurity compliance will increase the values of Cyber
Maturity and Trust, and reduce the Threat Level given the
calculation proposed by EBIOS RM.
Classification of stakeholders: Risk managers always have
to make crucial decisions based on priorities to ensure the
security of the assets they are in charge of. As presented in
Table V, EBIOS RM could not distribute the stakeholders
in every threat zone. To address this issue and provide a
more effective classification to risk managers, we proposed a
three-level Pareto chart. By extension, an (n − 1) level Pareto
chart could distribute the threat agents on (n) threat zones
effectively.
Attack scenarios: We defined the strategic attack scenarios
based on information (e.g., risk origins, target objectives, fear
events, threat agents, and threat level) we collected through
our investigation. These scenarios support our claim regarding
the importance of assessing the stakeholders for smart home
security. However, it could be challenging to discuss how
realistic these scenarios are. To address these issues, note
that EBIOS RM recommends an assessment of every strategic
attack scenario in Workshop 4, which is out of the scope of
this paper.
Limitations: Given the complexity of smart home ecosys-
tems, one limitation of this paper could be the identification of
key smart-home stakeholders. “The Principle of Who or What
Really Counts” rests upon the assumptions and perception of
risk managers [30]. That being said, a comprehensive survey
study to identify the smart-home stakeholders in regards to
critical attributes, such as power, legitimacy, and urgency
proposed by [30], is necessary. Moreover, the results of our
research, especially those described in Table III and Table IV,
rely on the stakeholders we choose and participants’ responses
to our questionnaire. Since we used an online questionnaire,
we could not guarantee the integrity of the collected data.
Furthermore, the results could have changed with fewer or
more stakeholders and participants. It is necessary to remark
that risk assessment is evolutionary. Threats are constantly
evolving, and ecosystems are changing. Therefore, our results
are not timeless. We recommend a more global investigation
with considerable financial and human resources to perform
a benchmark for significant smart-home stakeholders in many
countries and collect evaluations of thousands of participants
to provide more robust and reliable results.
Our findings sound the alarm on the security of smart
homes, but mostly its stakeholders. This research fills a gap in
the literature since none of the previous works have considered
this perspective.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Cyberattacks regularly involve sophisticated means that
could be challenging to detect, mainly when they target a
dynamic and complex environment such as a smart home.
This paper elaborates the security risk analysis of a smart
home using EBIOS RM with a focus on the threat level
assessment of smart-home stakeholders in the role of threat
agents. The goal is to identify realistic attack scenarios to
smart homes involving these stakeholders. We provide high-
level attack scenarios involving smart-home stakeholders after
a step-by-step process to identify risk origins, target objectives,
fear events and their severity, threat agents and their threat
level, as recommended by EBIOS RM. This perspective of
the smart home security with a focus on stakeholders security
issues have not been explored in the previous studies.

We develop a questionnaire based on a 5-point Likert scale
to assess the threat level of threat agents. We propose a three-
level Pareto chart to classify the smart-home stakeholders into
different threat zones. This approach distributes the threat
agents into every threat zone, unlike the proposed distribution
suggested by EBIOS RM. Our results show that the threat
levels of successful attack scenarios involving smart home
inhabitants and smart home automation service providers are
very high.
Forthcoming work will cover the identification and risk
assessment of each operational scenario (Workshop 4) and
the risk treatment (Workshop 5). More broadly, the present
findings might contribute to extending the discussions on
smart home security to the security of stakeholders who
make smart home operations effective. Including stakeholders
when rethinking the security design of smart homes becomes
essential. Furthermore, multi-layered security cooperation for
smart home security could be possible in the future. Future
work will cover the designing of security systems and policies
considering stakeholders for smart home security. We invite in-
terested readers to engage in smart-home stakeholders analysis
to provide other perspectives and results.
