Abstract—Radar sensor provides a continuous and non-contact 
solution for human vital sign extraction. Radar sensor records 
the human chest vibrations and the received radar returns are 
processed to extract breathing rate (BR) and heart rate (HR). 
For directional radars, with an increase in angle of arrival 
(AOA), the strength of the signal reflected from target 
decreases. Since beamforming can increase the signal strength 
by steering the beam towards human target, this paper 
evaluates the performance of vital sign extraction with and 
without beamforming cases. Experiments were performed with 
human subject located at different AOA and vital signs were 
extracted in three different scenarios, which are (1) without 
beamforming, (2) with transmitter beamforming, and (3) with 
receiver beamforming. Preliminary comparison shows that 
focusing the radar signal towards the AOA decreases the mean 
absolute error (MAE) between the radar and the gold standard 
reference.

INTRODUCTION 
Short-range millimeter wave radars have enabled several 
wireless sensing applications such as human behavior 
monitoring, gesture recognition and vital sign detection [1]. 
Radars were used only to detect large targets until 1970s 
when Lin [2] proved the feasibility of human and animal 
breathing rate detection using microwaves. Human vital sign 
measurement through radar has gained huge attention 
amongst the research community due to the fact that the 
abnormality in human vital sign can directly lead to several 
health related complications. Monitoring the patients and 
elderly persons continuously let the early diagnostics to 
avoid serious outcomes.  
Unlike the other traditional Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
based vital sign monitoring, radar sensor provides a non-
invasive and non-contact solution for continuous vital sign 
measurement [3]. The principle of vital sign detection works 
on detecting and processing the chest displacement with 
time. The acquired chest displacement signal is passed 
through a signal processing chain to extract breathing rate 
(BR) and heart rate (HR).  
Off the shelf (OTS) radar sensors have a directional 
antenna which implies that as we move away from the center 
of radar beamwidth, the signal strength will decrease [4]. To 
overcome this loss, using beamforming concepts, multi-input 
multi-output (MIMO) radar are able to steer the beam 
towards the target under consideration [5]. However, the 
effectiveness of beamforming for vital sign extraction is yet 
to be explored. This study presents experimental comparison 
vital sign extraction with and without beamforming cases. 
For this purpose, we used an OTS frequency modulated 
continuous wave (FMCW) radar manufactured by Texas 
Instruments (TI IWR6843).

METHODOLOGY
In this paper, both transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) 
side beamforming concepts are utilized while making 
comparison. To achieve high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
using TX beamforming, the TX signals are aligned in such a 
way that the resulting constructive interference increases the 
TX signal energy in a particular direction. The TX system 
considered in this study comprises of horizontally aligned 
two TX channels as shown in Figure 1(a). Note that there 
must exist a phase difference of ߂߮ between the transmitted 
signals st1(t) and st2(t) to achieve beamforming for a target at 
angle ߠ. The phase delay ߂߮ is equivalent to the product of 
distance between two transmitters and the term sin(ߠ) [5].  
On the other hand, receiver beamforming is also achieved 
by delaying the received signal at each channel by a 
multiple of a phase difference ߂߶. The RX beamforming 
system with 4 RX channels is illustrated in Figure 1(b). In 
order to synchronize the phase of the received signal at each 
RX channel, the received signals sr4(t), sr3(t), and sr2(t) must 
be phase delayed by 3߂߶, 2߂߶, and ߂߶, respectively. The 
resultant vectors are added to achieve the RX beamforming. 
Figure 2(a) shows the experimental setup for human vital 
sign detection. We considered five different angles. Vital 
signs with radar and the reference gold standard sensor are 
simultaneously extracted in three different scenarios: (1) 
without beamforming, (2) with TX beamforming, and (3) 
with RX beamforming. We used GDX-RB Respiration Belt 
and PSL-iECG2 Electrocardiogram Device as reference 
sensors to measure BR and HR, respectively. For 
robustness, three different participants were involved in the 
data acquisition process. Data from each participant were 
collected separately for all three aforementioned scenarios

and mean absolute error (MAE) values between radar and 
reference sensors were computed. Figure 2(b) shows the

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We compared the MAE between radar and reference 
sensor device in all the cases, and the results are summarized 
in Tables I and II for BR and HR respectively. Tables I and 
II suggest that the TX and the RX beamforming has slightly 
reduced the MAE of the HR mainly. Based on results 
gathered with OTS radar under consideration, HR seems to 
be the main beneficiary of beamforming. The MAE for the 
BR on the other hand is not decreased significantly in 
comparison to the HR. Hence, it can be concluded that for 
this particular OTS FMCW radar, beamforming can be 
deployed mainly for HR extraction whereas BR can be 
extracted without using beamforming. In addition, when the 
participant is in front of radar, beamforming does not 
increase the performance of HR extraction. In fact, Table II 
shows a slightly increased MAE for the case of zero degree. 
In the future, we plan to extend the beamforming concept 
to extract vital signs for each of multiple humans coexisting 
at different distances and angles.
