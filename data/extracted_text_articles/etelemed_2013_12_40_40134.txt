Abstract— Cutaneous melanoma, one of the most aggressive 
malignant tumors, potentially leads to widespread metastasis. 
The prediction of early metastatic events by using clinical 
information and data from specific tumor markers could 
substantially augment the quality of diagnostic and treatment 
decisions. To predict potential metastatic events during follow-
up in patients with cutaneous melanoma, a knowledge-based 
system will be used during clinical routine by interpreting data 
from clinical history of the patient in combination with data 
from tumor markers. Specifically, data will be sent to an 
expert system including a rule engine which offers the 
physician a risk assessment and decision support. The 
interpretation of the tumor markers (n=493) resulted in a 
prediction sensitivity and specificity of 77.80% and 69.55% 
while using the multivariate combination of MIA, S100β and 
LDH. Additionally, the risk of metastasis was calculated based 
on fitted survival functions and was integrated into our system. 
Currently this knowledge-based system will calculate the 
individual likelihood for metastatic events based on the risk of 
the primary tumor, the duration of observation since the 
primary event and the recent values of tumor markers. The 
system aims to produce results that are compatible with 
medical expert’s opinion.

I. 
 BACKGROUND & MOTIVATION 
There is substantial evidence that cases of cutaneous 
melanoma (CM) are still increasing worldwide. The increase 
of the incidence amounts to about 4-8% [1, 2]. According to 
Meves, a duplication of the incidence until 2020 is 
conceivable [3]. Today’s incidence in Germany and Austria 
ranges between 12-15 / 100,000 inhabitants [2]. 
Clinically, primary CM is usually diagnosed by the naked 
eye and is supported by the use of diagnostic algorithms 
(ABCD algorithm) [4-7]. Usually, CM is initially treated by 
surgical excision. After excision, tumors are classified 
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) published TNM classification for CM, based on 
studies from Balch et al. [8, 9].  The AJCC classification [10] 
allows to stratify CM into different categories, predicting the 
risk for widespread metastatic disease. Numerous studies 
showed that metastasizing CM have a distinctly poorer 
prognosis than non-metastasizing CM [9, 11]. Consequently, 
the diagnosis of CM at an early stage and additionally the 
prediction of metastasis as early as possible stage of 
development are essential. 
Patients suffering from CM require a number of follow-
up examinations over a long period of time. These 
examinations include several imaging modalities like X-Ray, 
computed 
tomography 
(CT), 
 
magnetic 
resonance 
tomography (MRT) or positron emission tomography (PET) 
[12]. Additionally, blood tests are commonly used during 
follow-up, examining the serum concentration of the tumor 
markers such as S100β protein, melanoma inhibitory activity 
(MIA) and lactatdehydrogenase (LDH) [13, 14]. 
A. Relevance of tumor markers 
Generally, tumor markers are circulating molecules, 
which will be obtained from blood or other body fluids. 
According to Bosserhoff et al. [1], the presence of metastatic 
disease correlates with the concentration of tumor markers. 
Hence, it should be probably possible to predict the 
metastasis and the progression of the disease in CM patients 
[15-17]. 
The already routinely established tumor markers for CM 
are S100β, MIA and LDH. These parameters were chosen

for our predictive model [13, 15, 18-21]. In a retrospective 
study, performed by Schlager et al [15], tumor markers of 
patients with CM were already collected. The data included 
176 patients with 493 single examinations. Every patient 
received state of the art imaging modalities like CT, MRT or 
PET. In 85 cases metastases were found. Univariate 
examinations clearly demonstrated the predictive power of 
these tumor markers clearly. The area under the curve 
(AUC) 
calculated 
by 
receiver-operator-characteristic-
analysis (ROC) was 0.676 for S100β, 0.721 for MIA and 
0.725 for LDH, respectively. 
B. Pretest probability for a metastatic event 
In this context, the term pretest probability describes the 
statistical probability of developing metastases before tumor 
marker levels are taken into account. According to Bayes’ 
rule [22, 23], the posterior (posttest) probability is the 
arithmetic product of the pretest probability and the 
likelihood ratio. Assigning a numerical value to the pretest 
probability amounts to quantifying the clinical expertise of a 
physician who is able to build an internal, “holistic” 
impression of a patient that forms the baseline of his or her 
assessment of that patient. Results of medical tests are then 
interpreted against this baseline, in the sense that the same 
test result will be interpreted differently, depending on this 
baseline. Bayesian statistics offers a means to formalize and 
numerically represent this procedure.  
 
II. 
MATERIALS & METHODS 
The assessment of the patient's pretest probability is 
based on predictive characteristics from the literature. These 
include the tumor thickness according to Breslow [24], 
mitotic rate and ulceration which can be used to make 
conclusions about the behavior of the tumor. 
The final version of the seventh edition of the AJCC 
melanoma staging and classification [9] includes the revised 
TNM classification for CM. This classification is particularly 
well suited for rule-based programming languages because it 
consists of IF-THEN rules. Consequently, to a certain extent, 
it is possible to parameterize the pretest probability and 
therefore it can be used for the generation of automated 
decisions. The tumor classification of CMs using the 
categories of the TNM classification allows prognostic 
statements of the disease and often determines further 
therapies. 
A. A knowledge-based system 
The knowledge base developed in this project calculates 
the present risk for metastasis in CM patients. Calculations 
are based on the pretest probability for metastasis in 
combination with the recent results from the tumor markers 
stated above. Artificial intelligence and rule based systems 
provide decision support. More precisely, the knowledge 
base will be a combination of multiple risk assessments: 
 
 
Rule-based interpretation of the TNM classification 
according AJCC 
 
Interpretation of the tumor markers S100β, 
melanoma 
inhibitory 
activity 
(MIA) 
and 
lactatdehydrogenase (LDH) by a multivariate 
artificial neural network analysis 
 
Risk assessment of survival function (present 
statistical mortality risk) based on the recent 
published results of the AJCC 
 
The knowledge-based system (KBS) is able to support 
the physician by calculating the tumor stage. Furthermore, 
the KBS offers an interpretation whether a given pattern of 
tumor markers is suspicious for an underlying metastatic 
event. 
Matlab R2009b and SPSS Statistics 17 were used for 
various calculations, particularly for ANNs, logistic 
regression [25-27] and ROC-curves [28]. Matlab was used to 
construct an individual ANN by using scaled conjugate 
gradient optimization. Standard settings for all ANNs were 
70% training, 15% validation and 15% testing, with 20 
hidden neurons in each case. 
The study included calculations in variant types, whereby 
every calculation involved the computation of ROC-curves 
(Fig. 1).

Pretest probability according to TNM was implemented 
in Arden Syntax [29, 30]. The rules are grouped in modules, 
called Medical Logic Module (MLM). An example of an 
implemented rule is showed in Fig. 2.

B. Work in progress 
As an element of work in progress we recently 
implemented our knowledge base as clinical decision support 
system (CDSS) in a huge hospital information system (HIS). 
A screenshot of the implemented form in the HIS is showed 
in Fig. 3. We aim to validate the system now during clinical 
routine. This approach has been acknowledged by the local 
ethical board (EK Nr. 1110/2010). 
C. Workflow of the clinical study 
The CDSS integrates completely into the workflow of the 
HIS. A feature of the system is the implementation of 
parameterized documents (PMD) for retrieval of relevant 
data. Specifically, results from tumor markers are 
automatically fed into decision support system via the 
laboratory information system. Additionally, clinical data are 
extracted 
from 
patient’s 
history 
and 
from 
the 
histopathological report. As a result these steps of data 
extraction feed the CDSS with all relevant data. 
 
III. 
RESULTS 
Currently, the CDSS calculates the probability whether 
not a given pattern of tumor markers is suggested for 
metastatic disease, but will not display this result to the user. 
The response system is received just in the background and 
not shown to the physician. Instead, the user is prompted to 
give his or her expert opinion whether or not the given 
pattern is suggestive for metastatic disease. Up to now 
(October 2012) we gathered n=214 clinical cases.  
At the end of the clinical study phase, the agreement 
between the clinical expert decisions versus the CDSS will 
be analyzed. Technically, we do not experience any 
problems during the clinical study phase. The system 
appears to be well accepted by the clinical experts. The 
median additional overhead of time caused by using the 
CDSS was 62 seconds. 
Initial data show that the comparison of the physicians' 
decisions with the CDSS resulted in 106 (49.53%) complete 
matches, which implies that the CDSS and the physician 
completely agreed. In 48 (22.43%) cases, the system 
calculated a lower risk for the patient, whereby in 10 
(4.67%) cases the calculations resulted in a higher risk, 
respectively. In 50 (23.36%) cases, no decision was neither 
possible for the CDSS nor for the physician, due to the lack 
of parameters. A comparison of the results is shown in 
Table I. 
A. Problem analysis 
During the routine workflow, it was not always possible 
to respond to all parameters required for the CDSS, leading 
to missing data. Additionally, distinct subtypes of CM were 
not clearly defined by the TNM/AJCC classification system. 
For example, tumor thickness of uveal melanoma cannot be 
exactly identified. Yet, the tumor thickness is a mandatory 
field and a mandatory parameter to classify the tumor 
according to AJCC.

IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The CDSS, developed in the context of this clinical 
study, facilitates the calculation of the tumor stage for 
patients with CM and additionally provides a meaningful 
risk assessment of possible metastatic events. Our 
preliminary data show, that our system is well accepted by 
physicians. We think, this is mainly due to the fact that the 
CDSS is almost seamlessly integrated into the routine HIS. 
Parameters are automatically extracted from its data sources 
without any hassle for the physicians in charge. The 
performance of the system is still under investigation.  
Early data indicate a promising agreement between the 
CDSS and expert physician’s judgment. However, the risk 
analysis has not been finalized yet and a clear decision on 
benefit and hazard cannot be given at the moment. 
Based on the experience made during this project, we are 
convinced that the integration of CDSS are in different fields 
of medicine might be useful. The appreciation and 
compliance with physicians is astonishingly high. Future 
prospective and controlled studies are mandatory for 
balancing benefit and risk of CDSS in the clinical domain.
