Abstract—Anemia is a public health problem that affects 
populations in both rich and poor countries. The World Health 
Organization recommends hemoglobin (Hb) color scale (HCS) 
to estimate the level of Hb in low resource settings where lab 
facilities are not available. Our aim is to investigate if the 
subjectivity associated with the use of HCS in estimating Hb 
level can be reduced by image processing techniques. It is 
proposed to take an image of a drop of blood under controlled 
conditions and then estimate the Hb value of the blood using 
an image processing algorithm trained on HCS. In the first 
part of the paper, the protocol for taking the images by a 
camera is standardized and established. In the second part of 
the paper, on a set of 20 healthy volunteers, the Hb value of 
their blood is estimated by the proposed method and compared 
with their reference Hb value. The correlation between the 
estimated Hb values and reference Hb values is 0.8. This result 
on a small dataset is encouraging and shows that color image 
analysis of blood can be used to estimate Hb.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Anemia is a condition characterized by inadequate red 
blood cell volume and a low concentration of hemoglobin 
(Hb) in the blood.  Anemia, which has multiple causes, such 
as iron deficiency, chronic blood loss, and hemolysis, is a 
prevalent health problem affecting an estimated 2 billion 
people, or approximately 30% of the world’s population. The 
most common cause of anemia worldwide is iron deficiency, 
which is often exacerbated by parasitic infections [1]. 
In most developing countries, anemia in pregnancy 
makes a very high contribution to maternal mortality and 
morbidity. An Hb concentration of < 11.0 g/dl is commonly 
taken as an indication of anemia in pregnancy. Successful 
management of anemia in pregnancy depends on accurate 
and acceptable methods of detecting anemia, assessing its 
severity and monitoring response to treatment. In pregnant 
women with mild-to-moderate anemia, timely treatment is 
likely to prevent the development of more severe anemia and 
thus reducing the need for blood transfusion which has its 
own associated risks. Moreover, prevention of severe anemia 
has direct benefits for both mother and child [2]. 
A few of the adverse effects of anemia in pregnant 
women include substantial reduced working capacity, 
increased susceptibility to infections and prolonged recovery, 
cardiac complication, respiratory complications, premature 
births, still births, low birth weight babies and high perinatal  
mortality. Anemia in children leads to reduced exercise 
capability, slower growth, impaired neurological and 
cognitive development, delayed wound healing and 
increased risk of dying [3]. 
In absence of lab facilities in a clinical setup, following 
are the two most common methods for Hb estimation: a) for 
invasive Hb estimation, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) Hemoglobin Color Scale (HCS) is a standard tool 
recommended by the WHO to estimate Hb [4], and b)for the 
non-invasive Hb estimation, clinicians usually examine the 
pallor to categorize the level of anemia into three broad 
categories, viz, mild, moderate and severe [5]. Both 
approaches require prior training, and suffer from 
subjectivity associated with the estimation. 
Color analysis by digital photography of blood for 
estimating Hb value has been tried before. Ranganathan and 
Gunasekaran [6] used a sample of blood, then smeared it on 
a glass plate to prepare a slide and used color analysis to 
estimate Hb value using artificial neural networks. They used 
a standard method designed by them to capture the smeared 
images. AlZahir and Donker [7] used a novel regression 
based model for detecting anemia using color microscopic 
blood images and showed good results in classification of 
anemia but did not estimate Hb. In this paper, we have 
extensively studied the behavior of WHOHCS and tried to 
come up with an algorithm to estimate Hb based on the 
digital photograph of WHO HCS. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 
II, the WHO HCS and its usage is described. The basic 
characteristics of HCS when digitized by taking a digital 
photograph are explained in Section III. The important 
protocols for taking an image of HCS and a blood sample are 
established through experimental analysis in Section IV. In 
Section V, the database and the results of Hb estimation (by 
the proposed method) on a set of 20 volunteers are discussed. 
The conclusions of this study, its limitations and the future 
directions are discussed in Section VI. 
II. 
WHO HCS 
WHO’s HCS is a simple and effective medical device for 
accurate estimation of hemoglobin levels at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 
and 14 g/dl, respectively (Figure 1). WHO HCS has already 
been validated in a few studies [8][9][10]. The device is 
simple to use, and the usage process is as follows:

 
Place a drop of blood on the test strip provided. 
 
Wait for about 30 seconds. 
 
Immediately match the color of the stain against all 
the hues on the scale. The closest match is 
estimated as the Hb value of the blood. 
As shown in Table I, this estimation process indicates 
whether the patient is anemic, and if so, the severity of 
anemia in clinical terms. This method of estimating Hb value 
cannot track minor changes in Hb during treatment, but 
rather assist in the management of any patient with suspected 
anemia, for example, to decide whether a patient may require 
a blood transfusion, a blood count, be referred for laboratory 
tests or to a hospital or clinic for treatment.

In this paper, we have made an attempt to digitize the 
WHO HCS, and used it with a digital photograph of a drop 
of blood to estimate the Hb value of the blood using an 
image processing algorithm.  
III. 
CHARACTERISTICS OF HCS 
Each Hb level image from a scanned image of WHO 
HCS was cropped to understand whether the clusters of each 
Hb value are distinct and can be used for predicting the Hb 
value (of the blood) from an image of a drop of blood taken 
by a camera. 
Figure 2 reveals that Red is most discriminatory at higher 
Hb levels (14 and 12) whereas Green does a better job in 
distinguishing lower Hb levels. The histograms of Blue are 
similar to that of the Green but are less discriminating. RGB 
color space was considered for image analysis. We also tried 
HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity), YCbCr (Y is luma 
component, Cb and Cr are the blue-difference and red-
difference chroma components), Lab (L is lightness, a and b 
are the color opponent dimensions) and I1I2I3 (Ohta’s color 
space) color spaces [11] for initial analysis and found that 
RGB color space gives monotonicity in the Hb levels of 
WHO HCS.  The RGB cube of a scanned image of the HCS 
is shown in Figure 3. It is clear from the figure that each Hb 
level forms a distinct cluster and the clusters are orderly 
arranged such that monotonicity is maintained, that is, 
clusters of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 are arranged such that 
cluster of 4 is followed by 6, 6 is followed by 8, and so on in 
the RGB space. The aim was to compute the Euclidean 
distance between the cluster of blood and cluster of each Hb 
value, with the assumption that the nearest cluster would be 
closest to the actual Hb value of the blood. 
In the subsequent experiments, we found out that the 
following factors are responsible for displacement of the 
clusters obtained from WHO HCS. 
 
Distance: With the variation of distance between the 
camera and the HCS, the clusters move such that the 
monotonicity gets disturbed.  
 
Resolution: The change in the resolution of the 
camera from 2 Megapixel (MP) to 14 MP also 
changes the placement of the clusters. 
 
Illumination: The monotonicity is disturbed with the 
variation in illumination. 
 
Angle: The angle at which the photograph is taken 
also changes the distance between each cluster and 
the monotonicity of clusters. 
IV. 
STANDARDISATION OF PROTOCOL 
After conducting various experiments with the HCS, we 
designed a standard protocol where the factors responsible 
for the movement of the clusters mentioned above are 
controlled to an extent. We have tried to come up with a 
standard where the inter cluster distance (ICD) is high and 
the monotonicity between the different clusters of HCS is 
maintained. 
A. Effect of distance between HCS and camera and 
resolution of the camera 
Images of the HCS were captured from 10 cm, 20 cm, 
and 30 cm and at a distance from where the camera screen is 
spanned by the preview of the HCS (approximately 7.5 cm).  
The megapixels settings of the camera were 2 MP and 5 MP. 
All the images were captured in natural light. The clusters 
are plotted in RGB color space (Figure 3) and mean to mean 
ICD is calculated (Table II). It is observed that the distance 
of the camera for a linear distribution of the clusters of Hb 
values should be less than 10 cm. Even at 10 cm, camera 
with 2 MP fails to maintain the linearity of clusters whereas 
5 MP camera just about maintains the linearity with the ICD 
between Hb values of 8 and 10 being very small. Therefore, 
a good setting would be a camera distance of around 7.5 cm 
and the camera’s megapixel setting of 5 MP where linearity 
is maintained and ICD is high.

B. Effect of Illumination 
In the following experiments, images of HCS were 
captured by the camera placed at a distance of 7.5 cm and the 
camera’s megapixel setting at 5 MP. All the images were 
captured in natural light. When taking the photograph, the 
lux value near the scale was measured. It needs to be noted 
that it is an adhoc setting where the lux value was not 
controlled, that is, whatever value was there, it was just 
recorded. The clusters were plotted in RGB color space and 
mean to mean ICD is calculated (Table III). Detailed 
experimentation for different types of light under controlled 
condition was not conducted. The experiments revealed that 
in low light conditions (low lux value), the clusters of 
different Hb values overlap. 
Moreover, in low light conditions, the clusters are not 
ordered according to their Hb values. For example, cluster of 
Hb value 14 is between the clusters of Hb value 4 and 6. 
Similarly, the cluster of Hb value 12 is between clusters of 
Hb value 6 and 8. This change in cluster position is highly 
undesirable 
for 
Hb 
estimation 
using 
WHO 
HCS. 
Illumination above 500 lux in natural outdoor light gave high 
ICD between the clusters of different Hb values of the HCS.

a. Note that ICD is a symmetric matrix. The second element of the matrix is the distance from mean 
of the Hb level cluster ‘4’ to the mean of Hb level cluster ‘6’ and so on. The entries underlined in red 
show change in monotonicity which is reflected in ICD. 
C. Angle 
For all the above experiments, the HCS was kept right 
below the camera. So, the angle was fixed at nearly 90°.  In 
order to understand the effect of angle, the images of HCS 
were captured in the outdoor light at an angle of 60° and 90°. 
In both the cases, 5 MP camera setting was used and distance 
for image taken at 90° angle was 7.5 cm. So, the distance 
between the HCS and the camera would have changed 
slightly for image taken at 60°.The clusters were plotted in 
RGB color space and mean to mean ICD is calculated (Table 
IV).  There is a change in linearity between Hb value 8 and 
Hb value 10 when the HCS is captured at an angle of 60°.  
Even the ICD has decreased significantly.

D. Timing Significance 
To understand the importance of time difference between 
the instance when a blood drop is placed on the strip and the 
instance when the photo of the blood drop is taken, we did a 
few experiments directly with the blood. To study whether 
the RGB values of the blood change with time, the 
photographs of a blood sample (placed on the filter strip) 
were taken at 20s, 30s, 40s and 60s after being placed on the

filter strip. The variation in RGB values of blood with time 
(30s-60s) was found to be less than 5%.

DATABASE AND RESULTS 
In a volunteer study, with 5 MP camera setting and 
distance between HCS and camera being 7.5 cm and HCS 
right below the camera (Angle - 90°), the image of the blood 
with the HCS was taken in outdoor light, as shown in Figure 
1. The timing of taking photograph was delayed since as per 
the WHO HCS protocol, the Hb had to be estimated by 2 
physicians using WHO HCS after waiting for 30s. The 
timing of the photograph was kept constant around 60s after 
the prick (as mentioned in Section Timing Significance, the 
difference in RGB values between an image taken at 30s and 
60s is less than 5%). 20 samples were collected in this 
volunteer study.  
As this was a volunteer study in an office setting, the 
volunteers had typically high reference Hb values. The Hb 
value was measured through Sahli’s method. The estimation 
of the Hb value using WHO HCS was done by two 
physicians and these Hb values were also noted down. It is 
worth mentioning that HemoCue AB is used as a reference 
in many Hb studies. However, we could not procure 
HemoCue AB due to its conflict of interest with Philips. We 
compared our results with Sahli’s method which is widely 
used in India and many other developing countries such as 
Indonesia. 
A portion of each Hb level and blood sample is cropped 
from the image for each volunteer. As the scale behavior 
might have changed for each volunteer due to illumination 
change, for each image the WHO HCS levels and blood 
sample were taken for analysis. A part of the database with 
results is shown in Table V.

In Table V, ‘Average Hb’ is the average of Hb values by 
Sahli’s and physicians’ interpretation of blood sample while 
using WHO HCS. Since Sahli’s method also suffers from 
subjectivity of human vision and interpretation, we 
considered the ‘Average Hb’ for reference; this is expected 
to reduce the bias and give better estimate as compared to 
estimate by any of the individual reference method. The last 
two columns show the results of our approach. The means of 
the Hb level and blood were plotted in RGB color space, and 
Euclidean distance measure was used to find the nearest 
neighbor. The nearest neighbor Hb value in RGB color space 
for each sample is documented in the column ‘EucRGB’ of 
Table V. ‘EucRGB(interpolated)’ is calculated using the 
distance of the mean of blood with the Hb values. For 
example, if the Hb value of blood falls between clusters of 
Hb value 12 and 14, Euclidean distance between “cluster of 
Hb value 12 and blood” and “cluster of Hb value 14 and 
blood” is calculated, and these distances are used for linear 
interpolation.  
‘Average Hb’ value of each subject and means of red and 
green channels from the cropped blood sample of each 
subject (from the image of blood) are plotted in Figure 4. 
The Hb value for each subject is on the X-axis with mean of 
Red and Green channels in the Y-axis and Z-axis 
respectively. Two strong natural clusters are observed 
suggesting that the Hb value above 12.5 can be easily 
distinguished from the Hb values below 12.5 by the 
information present in the red and green channels.

with Hb value( by taking ‘Average Hb’). It clearly shows two natural 
clusters. 
 
Pearson’s 
product-moment 
correlation 
coefficient 
between various methods used in this study to estimate Hb is 
shown in Table VI. It is observed that the estimation from 
the algorithm (‘EucRGB (interpolated)’) has a correlation 
coefficient of 0.80 with the average Hb value. This is the 
highest correlation between any of the two methods studied 
in this paper (the correlation of 0.85 between ‘Average Hb’ 
and other methods which were used to derive ‘Average Hb’ 
needs to be discounted since it is going to be high by design). 
Bland-Altman plots [12] comparing ‘Average Hb’ value 
and estimation of algorithm (‘EucRGB (interpolated)’) is 
shown in Fig. 5. It shows that the algorithm overestimates 
the Hb values near 12-13 Hb levels and 10-11 Hb levels, 
whereas in 10-11 Hb levels the algorithm underestimates Hb 
values.

CONCLUSIONS, 
LIMITATIONS 
AND 
FUTURE 
DIRECTIONS 
In this paper, the important protocols for taking an image 
of HCS and a blood sample for estimating Hb value of the 
blood are established through experiments. The results show 
that there is a high correlation (0.8) between color of blood 
and its Hb value. Though the results are encouraging, the 
database is limited and has typically high values of Hb.  
The three methods (Sahli’s and judgment of physicians 
using WHO HCS) which were used for comparison with the 
estimate of the algorithm (Tables V and Table VI) have high 
subjectivity associated with them. So there is a need for an 
objective measure. In addition, this whole study was 
conducted in the natural light and there was no control on 
illumination conditions. Though the results presented in this 
paper on a small dataset are encouraging, the same results 
need to be replicated in controlled artificial light to make the 
system usable anytime and anywhere. One of the methods to 
achieve this is to mimic natural light using artificial lights.  
Despite all attempts to standardize the protocol of data 
collection, there were illumination changes in the outdoor 
condition. This might have affected the RGB values of the 
blood samples. Gray balancing and various other color 
constancy algorithms in computer vision can be applied to 
improve the performance of the algorithm. 
Fig. 4 suggests that the image of the blood sample on the 
filter strip (without validation of observation through WHO 
HCS) is enough and can be used to estimate the Hb value by 
using machine learning algorithms. However, we need a 
much larger dataset to develop this data driven approach.
