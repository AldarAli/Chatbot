Abstract— We present the design of a Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) system based on Helmholtz coil in place of a
permanent magnet which is common in commercial MRI
systems. Inspired by the homogeneity of the magnetic field of
the Helmholtz coil, the design has been proposed. This coil
generates a main magnetic field of 0.2T which is a low
magnetic field and hence it was possible to make the system
low weight to some extent. This makes the proposed design
suitable to be taken and operated at remote locations. Along
with the main magnetic field, other components are also
necessary like the gradient coils, radio-frequency coils and a
constant DC current source, to mention a few. The gradient
has strength of 75µT/m. The resonating frequency at which
the radio-frequency operates is 8.256MHz for 0.2T and the
DC source gives a current of 10A with 50V DC which is
essential requirement for the operating of the coils. All the
components taken together make the whole system.
Keywords - Helmholtz coil; Maxwell coil; RF coil; constant
DC source; homogeneity; magnetic field.

INTRODUCTION
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical
imaging method used in radiology to form images of the
biological processes of body in both health and disease
conditions.
MRI,
also
known
as
nuclear
magnetic
resonance imaging, is a technique for creating images of
external as well as internal organs of human body. MRI
scanners enable fast, non-invasive, and high-resolution
imaging of organs and soft tissue.
MRI was established as a promising diagnostic tool in
the beginning of 1980s. While high magnetic field (≥ 
1.0T) MRI scanners continue to be the most commonly
used, there is growing interest in the utilization of low-
field (≤ 0.5T) extremity scanners [6]. They are smaller, 
less expensive, and easier to install, and allow for quicker
patient diagnoses in an office setting. In contrast, high
magnetic field scanners have superior image quality
because of higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast,
and resolution [1]. It is possible for low-field scanners to
improve image quality by increasing scan duration,
although doing so also increases the chance of motion
artifacts [1]–[4] While lowfield MRI images may not be
able to compete with the quality of those produced using
high-field scanners, it is important to consider whether or
not they can provide comparable diagnostic capabilities to
justify their logistical benefits. When compared with
surgical findings, the use of low-field extremity MRI
scanners for identifying medical meniscus pathology has

been promising (sensitivity, 77%-96%; specificity, 71%-
100%); however, the results for identifying pathology of
the lateral meniscus have been more variable [5]–[13].
Most of these studies show low-field MRI to be a
moderately
good
identifier
of
sub-peripheral
and
meniscus pathology (sensitivity, 75%- 93%; specificity,
94%-100%).
Ghazinoor
et
al.
concluded
that
their
subjective
experience
is
in
concordance
with
many
studies
demonstrating the high diagnostic value in the use of low-
field
scanners
in
musculoskeletal
pathology
[1].
Tavernier et al. stated that the primary limitation of low-
field MRI is lower SNR, which has to be compensated for
by increasing the slice thickness, reducing the in-plane
resolution, increasing the number of acquisitions (and
consecutively the acquisition time), and decreasing the
bandwidth [14].
Tavernier et al. concluded that implementation of low-
field
MRI
systems
may
be
useful,
especially
in
orthopaedic centers, or if installation of an additional
high-field scanner is not possible because of economic
considerations [14]. Blanco et al showed that there is
trade-off in image quality towards less resolution due to
open structure of these systems [15]. The image quality of
low-field
scanners
is,
however,
sufficient
for
interventional use. In a review article, Hayashi et al. noted
that no reliable efficacy studies, however, exist comparing
the diagnostic capabilities of low- versus high-field
scanners [16]. In order to compensate for lower SNR,
scanners with low field strength tend to have longer
acquisition
times,
often
resulting
in
greater
image
degradation due to patient movement.
The current research focuses on the development of a
low cost and low magnetic MRI machine for the point of
ease testing support. In order to provide the diagnostics
support at the point of care, the MRI is proposed to
sufficient small weight, because of which Helmholtz coil
instead of permanent magnetic is proposed to be used to
generate the main magnetic field. The gradient coil is
implemented with Maxwell coil. The RF coil design has
been implemented based on the papers of Mehmet Bilgen
in 2004 and 2001[21-22]. Their study showed implantable
coils can work fine having good SNR.
The paper is divided in the following sections. Section
II focuses on the design of material and method, Section
III discusses the design of the different coils (Helmholtz
coil, Maxwell coil; RF coil which has done using concept
of COMSOL Multiphysics 5:2 and CST), Section IV
discusses results, and Section V the discussion. Section
VI concludes the paper.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The MRI in the proposed design is based on Helmholtz
Coil. Hence, the main magnetic field is generated using the
above mentioned coil. The main magnetic field is of 0.2 T.
For such a low magnetic field, the gradient strength is kept at
75µT/m. The gradient fields are necessary to obtain the
spatial information about the subject. Maxwell Coil and
Saddle Coil were designed as the gradient coils. All these
coils are concentric. The inner radius of the system is 40cm,
which is enough for head or limbs to be inserted. The inner
radius is the radius for the radio-frequency (RF) coil which is
a surface coil for the time being.
All the coils are built with annealed copper. For the
coils, copper wires were used with AWG gauge size of 11
(2.303mm diameter). Since RF coil is a surface coil it’s
designed on PCB (Printed Circuit Board) using annealed
copper.
III.
DESIGN OF COILS
A. Design of Helmholtz Coil
Helmholtz coil is basically a pair of coils that are
separated from each other at a distance equal to the radius
of the coil. The magnetic field is calculated applying Biot
Savart’s law for Helmholtz Coil. According to Biot
Savart’s Law,

where µ0 is the permeability constant = 4π x 10-7 Tm/A. I

the distance of a point from the coil on the axis of the coil
and n is the number of turns of the coil.

magnetic field generated along the axis of the coil due to
current I.
In case of Helmholtz coil the Biot Savart’s Law gets
modified a little. In a Helmholtz Coil, a point that is
halfway between the coils has a value of x equal to R/2.
The magnetic field at that point due to the two coils is
given by,

Since the main magnetic field was 0.2T and the radius
was taken to be 30 cm or 0.3 m, so for a current of 10A
the number of turns for each coil was obtained as 6675.
The orientation of the coil is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Helmholtz Coil pair of radius 30cm
It is necessary that the main magnetic field be uniform
over the volume of interest. Hence, homogeneity becomes
one of the important aspects for the main magnetic field or
Helmholtz Coil. Homogeneity is calculated from the
center of the coil to any particular point and it is measured
in percentage change of magnetic field strength from
center to any particular point.

H is the homogeneity or percentage change of
magnetic field strength at any point from the center. Bi is
the magnetic field at any point in the volume and B0 is the
magnetic field at the center. Generally volumes of spheres
or cylinders are considered to specify homogeneity. Here
a sphere has been chosen to calculate homogeneity in the
Helmholtz coil. From the homogeneity, the region of
study can be predicted very well, thus defining the area
where to place the patient.
B. Design of Gradient Coils
Gradient
coils
provide
some
deliberate
inhomogeneities which can be used to frequency encode
spatial information of the signal returned by the sample or
subject. Maxwell coil and Saddle coil has been used as
the gradient coils. While Maxwell coil provide the
gradient field along the z axis (longitudinal gradient),
Saddle coils provide the gradient strength along the x and
y axis (transverse gradients) respectively. The basic
equation governing the linearly varying the gradient
magnetic field is given by,

C. Design of Radio-Frequency Coil
The
radio-frequency
(RF)
radiation
on
the
magnetization of the sample is important to obtain images.
The RF coil consists of a transmitter and receiver section.
The transmitter section radiates the sample with a RF field
in order to tip the magnetization away from equilibrium
position and that it can generate a detectable NMR signal.
The receiver section receives the signal and transforms the
signal from analog to digital using some necessary
circuitry.
The protons in the subject or patients go from one
energy state to another energy state by releasing energy.
That is they emit photon of some frequency to move from
an excited state to equilibrium state. This frequency is
directly proportional to the magnetic field strength. The
relation between the resonating frequency and the main
magnetic field is given by,
  B0
(7)
where  is the angular frequency,
B0
is the
main
magnetic field and is the gyromagnetic ratio for protons
whose value is 42.58 MHz/T. From the fact that main
magnetic field is 0.2T the resonating frequency comes out
to be 8.526MHz. This frequency is also called the Larmor
frequency of the nucleus. For designing the coil, it is
required take the length of the coil less than the
wavelength. The length of the wire was taken at 1/20th of
the wavelength which is 1.76m. The design is simple
rectangular spiral coil (surface coil) whose dimension is
20cm by 10cm.
D.
Design of Constant DC source
The voltage-mode feedback approach in circuit design is
becoming more common; because circuits designed using
this approach will always work better at low speed-high
accuracy, than its current-mode counterpart. Therefore
many systems could take advantage of voltage-mode
feedback over a wide field of applications like low
frequency voltage or current reference design.
The block diagram of constant DC current source is
shown in Figure 3. Step down transformer converters
230V, 50Hz mains power supply to 50V, 50Hz. Rectifier
convert it into DC voltage. Later sensing feedback makes
sure that the output voltage and currents are 50V (DC)
and 10A (DC), respectively.
Figure 4. Circuit diagram of constant DC current source
Circuit diagram of constant DC current source is shown
in Figure 4. Rectifier contains bridge type rectifier with
large value capacitor. Sensing and feedback circuit consist
of resistors R3 and R4 along with two Darlington BJT
pairs of Q1-Q2 and Q3-Q4. The feedback factor in terms
of voltage is given in eq. 8.

RESULTS
The simulations
were
performed
in
COMSOL
Multiphysics
and
CST
(Computer
Simulation
Technology). In both softwares, a 3-Dimensional design
is provided, material is also assigned and also the study
type is given. The results are discussed in the subsections.
A. Simulation of Helmholtz Coil
The model of Helmholtz Coil has been built in
COMSOL Multiphysics. The coil was designed for a
magnetic field strength of 0.2T. The inner radius of the
coil has been kept 30 cm or 0.3 m while the outer radius
extends upto 59 cm. The material of the coil was copper
having a gauge size of 11. Using the equation of the
magnetic field the number of turns obtained was 6675 for
a current of 10A. Having considered these specifications
the
magnetic
flux
density
was
obtained
from
the
simulation. The results are shown in Figure 5 below.

Homogeneity of Helmholtz Coil is considered to be
uniform i.e. magnetic field is uniform within the coil. The
uniformity of the coil can be observed from the figure
above. Also, a line graph has been obtained from the
simulation as shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6. Homogeneity of Helmholtz coil
B. Simulation of Maxwell Coil
Maxwell Coil is anti-Helmholtz coil whose governing
equation has been given above. Maxwell Coil has been
used for longitudinal gradient and Saddle coil has been
used for transverse gradient. In Maxwell coil the distance
between the coils is √3 times the radius of the coil. The 
radius of the coil has been taken as 25 cm and the current
5A. Having these specifications the number of turns
obtained was 125 and the slope or gradient strength was
75µT/m. The slope was determined from this graph in
Figure 7.
Figure 7. Slope of the Maxwell coil
The simulation result in Figure 8 shows the distribution
of magnetic flux density of the Maxwell coil. The
magnetic flux varies from the center towards outside.

C. Simulation of RF coil
When it comes to radio-frequency coil (RF coil), it is
one of the important part of the MRI system. The RF coil
is responsible for images developed from a MRI system.
The RF coil consists of two parts, the transmitter part and
the receiver part. Both these parts are designed separately.
A basic design of the transmitter part is given in Figure 9.
It simply consists of a rectangular spiral coil which was
simulated in Computer Simulation Technology (CST).
The model is shown in Figure 9.

D. Experimental setup of constant DC source
Figure 12. Measurement set-up for constant DC current source
Measurement set-up is shown in Figure 12. Input
single phase- secondary’s AC is recorded i.e. 45 V.
Output DC voltage (50 V : clearly visible) and DC current
(10 A : little hazy) are shown here. Due to large value
capacitor we get 50V DC after applying 45 V AC as input.
The outputs are observed to be constant at 10A with 50V
DC. This circuit is useful as voltage and current reference
circuit for powering up the low cost MRI systems.

DISCUSSION
The
various
results
are
obtained
from
COMSOL
Multiphysics5.2
for
single
slice
and
multi-slice
in
multidomain and X-Y plane. The results show the
distribution of magnetic field in coil, surface charge
density of the coils and percentage of homogeneity of
magnetic field at the centre of the two coils. Helmholtz
coil and Maxwell coil have these results. The simulation
results give insights on placement of the subject inside the
MRI machine for MR imaging. Figure 3 shows the inner
side edge of second coil, which the reference edge is taken
for Helmholtz coil from where we started our studies.
However in the RF coil, studies were performed in CST.
In that simple design results were obtained for 1V input
voltage. And the output for the constant DC current source
is observed to be 10A with 50 V DC.
A. Helmholtz coil and Maxwell coil
Simulation studies regarding the Helmholtz coil as well as
the Maxwell coil shows the distribution of magnetic flus
density of the coils. Regarding the Helmholtz coil the flux
density was found to be 0.2T (calculated and simulated). For
the Maxwell coil, the flux density is zero at the center of the
coil, which is also depicted by the simulation result. From the
flux density graph in figure and the homogeneity graph in
figure it can clearly be inferred that the field is homogeneous
within the coil. The flux density is constant within some
region of the coil (region of study) inferring that field is
homogenous in that region.
A study of homogeneity along the radial length of the
coil is given in TABLE I. And it can be seen that
homogeneity lies within ±2% in the region of study.
B. RF coil
The design of RF coil is simple rectangular spiral coil.
And it’s electric and magnetic field has been shown in
Figures 8 and 9. Using these two fields the RF coil can be
easily designed. A magnetic field of 1.3T is within the coil
and an electric field of 867 V/m is within the coil.
C. Constant DC current source
An input of 45 V at the single phase secondary’s AC
is recorded while at the output DC voltage 50 V is
recorded. A DC current of 10A with 50 V is observed at
output.

CONCLUSION
This paper presents a design of Helmholtz coil,
Gradient coil, RF coil and constant DC current source for
the development of a low cost and low magnetic field
MRI system. The simulation results have been obtained
for Helmholtz coil and Maxwell coil in z-direction for
magnetic flux density, magnetic field at the centre of the
coil and over the surface of the coils obtained from
COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2. The RF coil was simulated in
CST environment to obtain the electric field and the
magnetic field which gave a rough idea regarding the
design of RF coil. The plots obtained from the COMSOL
and our calculated data shows the exact same values
prove that our approach is accurate. Our study reveals that
there occurs homogeneity in Helmholtz coil where we can
place subject for study. We have calculated and validated
through simulation that homogeneity at the centre of
Helmholtz coil is about ±2 per cent over the region of
study. The constant DC source gave an output of 10A
with 50 V which is our requirement. This machine will be
useful and harmless for mankind and will give the better
results as compared to bulky machines.
