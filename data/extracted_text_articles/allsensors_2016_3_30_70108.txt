Abstract—In applications with ultrasonic clamp-on sensors 
measurement, accuracy and repeatability are significantly 
worse when compared to ultrasonic inline sensors in spite of 
both sensor types using the same measurement principle. The 
positioning of the ultrasonic transducers of clamp-on sensors 
has a determining influence on the precision and accuracy of 
the measurement results. A study was made of sound 
propagation and receiver signal quality as they vary depending 
on the distance between the ultrasonic transmitter and the 
ultrasonic receiver. As a result of studying transducer 
sensitivity, it was possible to implement an automatic 
positioning system for ultrasonic clamp-on sensor applications. 
The positioning system automatically finds an optimal 
transducer position for a particular application. This allows   
the user to operate a clamp-on sensor without having any 
special knowledge of the application procedure or needing to 
set any parameters of the system in advance. 
Keywords—ultrasonic clamp-on sensor; receiver signal 
quality; propagation of sound; transducer positioning 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Today, a well-known application area for ultrasonic 
clamp-on sensors is in the flowmeters which are used in 
many industrial processes [1-6] . 
Ultrasonic clamp-on sensors offer the opportunity to 
measure other parameters, for example density and the 
concentration of ingredients in fluids [7-10] .  
Other kinds of ultrasonic clamp-on sensors allow 
detection of the composition of homogenous alloys or can 
distinguish synthetic materials without any chemical analysis 
[11]. Such systems are used where non-destructive material 
control is required.  
A. 
State of the Art 
The main advantage of all these kinds of ultrasonic 
clamp-on measurements is the possibility to measure non-
invasively. Parameters can be detected offline or online, so 
one does not have to disconnect a running system. This 
advantage led to successful development and deployment of 
clamp-on transducers for more than twenty-five years [12]. 
There are also some disadvantages of using ultrasonic 
clamp-on sensors particularly in comparison to ultrasonic 
sensors with fixed-mounted transducers in a complete sensor 
system. The main functional components, transducers and 
electronics of these different ultrasonic sensors generally 
operate in the same way. Only the positioning of the 
transducers is significantly different [13]. The greatest signal 
amplitudes and the best signal to noise ratio are expected 
when the transmitter and the receiver are located in an 
optimal relative position. 
Thus, the proposal is the following: if the positioning of 
the ultrasonic transducers can be optimized, then the 
precision of the measuring in clamp-on applications is 
improved. 
B. 
 Aim of the Study 
This study concentrates on flowmeter applications and 
finding an optimal relative position between an ultrasonic 
transmitter and an ultrasonic receiver when placed on a 
water-filled pipe. Without the influence of any flow, the 
signal quality of the receiver was measured as solely 
dependent on   the distance between the transducers. The 
maximum amplitude for the envelope curve of the receiver 
signal is a sure indicator of an optimal distance between 
transmitter and receiver. An automatic transducer positioning 
system for clamp-on flowmeter applications was developed 
using this criterion. 
C. 
Structure of the Paper 
The paper is subdivided into five main sections. 
According to this instruction, some relevant theoretical 
basics are elucidated and illustrated in section ‘Theory’. The 
section ‘Measurements’ contains a description of the 
experimental setup, the measurement results and an 
interpretation of the represented series of receiver signals. In 
section 
‘Development 
of 
an 
Automatic 
Transducer 
Positioning System’, such a system for clamp-on ultrasonic 
transducers is briefly depicted. In a last section, a summary 
and an outlook are written. 
II. 
THEORY 
One of these optimal relative positions results from the v-, 
and w-model arrangements of the transducers. The basis of 
these model arrangements is the SNELLIUS-law of reflection. 
It describes the change of the direction of propagation at 
boundaries between media with different sound velocities 
[14]. 
The sound propagation between an ultrasonic transmitter 
and an ultrasonic receiver (see Figures 1 and 2) takes place

by Rayleigh waves (surface acoustic waves) and by 
transversal and longitudinal waves. 
Furthermore, as is generally known, ultrasonic sound 
velocity depends on material properties [15]. In solids, the 
ultrasonic sound propagation is a result of volumetric 
deformation and shear deformation. All kinds of waves   
propagate in solid materials like the wall of the pipe. The 
sound velocity depends on the bulk modulus, the shear 
modulus and the density of the material in which the 
ultrasonic wave is travelling. Fluids do not transmit shear 
forces therefore only longitudinal waves have the capability 
to spread in liquids and gases. Typically, longitudinal waves 
travel faster in materials than do transversal waves [16]. 
Furthermore, the sound velocity of Rayleigh waves is less 
than the sound velocity of transversal waves [17].

Another aspect of sound propagation is the superposition of 
different orders in the pipe through the fluid (Figure  2).  
 
 
Figure 2.  Sound propagation with beam spread instead of supersonic jets 
A widespread beam is really propagated instead of a 
supersonic jet. Such a widespread beam has a similar effect 
like an instability or uncertainty of the inclination angle.  
Both the breadth of the real beam spread and the 
superposition of multiple reflections constitute reasons why 
there is a measurement effect in nearly every distance 
between the ultrasonic transmitter and receiver (Figure 2).

MEASUREMENTS 
A. General Description of the Experimental Setup 
The experimental setup is shown in Figures 3 to 6. Each 
horizontal pipe (Figure 3) consists of a different material. 
The pipes are filled with water. Ultrasonic clamp-on 
transducers can be mounted on these pipes. Usually, this is 
achieved by pipe clamps such as those used by the 
transducers of the reference clamp-on flowmeter F601 from 
the Flexim GmbH company (Figure 3a). Figure 3 shows the 
main parts of the experimental setup.

 In the test case, a pair of ultrasonic clamp-on transducers 
was mounted with only the force of permanent magnets on a 
pipe of steel (Figure 4). This made it very simple to change 
the distance between the transducers in the test scenario.

To study how the received signal quality depends on the 
distance between the transducers, the distance between the 
front-ends of the housings of the ultrasonic transmitter and 
the ultrasonic receiver was measured. The front-end distance 
of the housings is smaller than the real transducer distance. 
The relationship between the distances is illustrated in 
Figures 1 and 5. Ultrasonic transducers of a TUF2000-
Clamp-on flowmeter were used for the experiments (Figures 
4 and 5). In Figure 5 the pipe-sided design of the transducers 
used is photographed.

B. Technical Specifications  
The experimental setup used in the presented studies of 
ultrasonic signal quality considered paths without any flow 
(v=0 m/s). So, it was not necessary to use the installed 
clamp-on reference flowmeter (F601) for the presented 
studies. 
The main parameters of the experimental setup are: 
 
The outer diameter of the used steel pipe: 60 mm.  
 
The thickness of wall of the pipe: 2±0,1mm. 
 
The distance of ultrasonic transducers:  
sTR = sE + 2*s0 ;                                (2) 
 
 (sE = Front-end distance  s0 = 12 mm [18]). 
 
The ultrasonic transmitter is driven by an electronic burst 
generator. Every burst consists of 10 single pulses. While the 
frequency of the burst sequence is 1 kHz, the frequency of 
the single pulses in the bursts is about 1 MHz. The signals of 
the transmitter and the receiver were observed with an 
oscilloscope (DSO PM3394, 200 MHz, 200 MS/s, 16 bit 
ADC). In the detected signals of the receiver the transmitting 
burst is also observed (Figure 6).  This is a helpful effect of 
electromagnetic crosstalk (see below).

with electromagnetic crosstalk 
C. Signal Interpretation 
The observed parasitic crosstalk is helpful to detect 
absolute transmitting times of the ultrasonic signal passing 
the distance between the transmitter and the receiver by 
analyzing the data of only one channel. For instance, a 
representative measurement series of signals of the receiver 
channel dependend on the distance of the ultrasonic 
transducers is printed in Figure 7 (Ultrasonic transducer 
distance sTR =: front-end distance value sE + 24 mm): 
 
              sTR = sE + 2*12 mm.

Figure 7.  Measurement series of receiver signals in dependency of the front-
end distance of transducers (from 30 mm up to 85 mm  / step: 5 mm) 
A significant correlation between the transit time and the 
transducer distance is shown. The relevant time slot of the 
receiver signal can be easily observed. 
Furthermore, the experiment indicates that the amplitude 
of the receiver signal does not decrease with the distance of 
the transducers. 
Constructive and destructive interferences seem to have 
the effect of periodical increasing and decreasing of the 
envelope curve of the receiver signal. 
In this case, the best signal noise ratios are found to be: 
 
sTR_1 = sE_50 + 24 mm = (50+24) mm = 74 mm, 
 
sTR_2 = sE_65 + 24 mm = (65+24) mm = 89 mm. 
  
Such studies will be continued by using a novel 
automatic transducer positioning system. 
IV. DEVELOPMENT OF AN AUTOMATIC TRANSDUCER 
POSITIONING SYSTEM 
Following 
evaluation 
of 
experiments 
and 
some 
theoretical studies an automatic transducer positioning 
system 
for 
clamp-on 
sensors 
was 
developed 
and 
implemented [19]. This positioning system (Figures 8 and 9) 
consists of a motorized linear track. The system is 
augmented with sensors to detect the temperature, the pipe 
outer diameter and the pipe wall thickness. This makes a 
complete, generic measurement system  for pipes.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 
A study was made of signal quality and the resulting 
signal noise ratio dependent on the distance between the 
transducers.  During the study, a system was created which 
automatically detects all relevant parameters to set the 
optimal 
distance 
between 
the 
ultrasonic 
clamp-on 
transducers in a particular application [19].  
Including further variables would require additional 
sensors in this solution, for example sound velocities, 
temperature or geometric parameters of the pipe. But it 
seems possible to measure the effect of all relevant 
parameters with the required accuracy by varying the 
position of the pair of ultrasonic transducers. By motorized 
motion of one transducer the ultrasound path between the 
transmitter and the receiver can be varied optimally for 
different measurement tasks.
