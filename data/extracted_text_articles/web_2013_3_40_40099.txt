Abstractâ€” The paper deals with the issue of supporting users 
to 
enrich 
unstructured 
wiki 
contents 
with 
semantic 
annotations. The authors present the development of a 
semantic wiki that provides semantic annotations compliant to 
ontological models. The semantic wiki developed, called 
WiWork, is presented with two related ontological models, the 
WiWork Core ontology and the Labour Market ontology. 
Finally, a methodology to define ontology concepts and 
properties is proposed by using Information Retrieval and 
statistical techniques.

 INTRODUCTION  
Wikis 
are 
collaborative 
web-based 
environments 
allowing users to create, share and reuse useful knowledge. 
Wiki's knowledge is mainly represented by an amount of 
unstructured textual contents. Unfortunately, the big volume 
and the lack of structure make often such contents 
inaccessible or hard to reuse. 
A recent trend focuses on enhancing wikis with Semantic 
Web technologies and formal languages to access and reuse 
data, included the unstructured ones: namely semantic wiki. 
Semantic wikis are promising tools providing the users an 
easy way to manage machine-processable knowledge, 
allowing the creation of added-value services based on the 
semantics of Web pages. They support metadata insertions 
through semantic annotations and link relations between wiki 
pages. Annotations are required to refer to an ontological 
model defining concepts and properties that can be 
associated to pieces of wiki contents. 
In the Semantic Web, ontologies are mainly developed 
and encoded with formal languages like RDF (Resource 
Description Format) [1] or OWL (Web Ontology Language) 
[2]. Moreover, ontology modeling and updating tasks are 
still hard to be accomplished for common users, and 
semantic wikis need ontologies as conceptual models to 
structure their contents. 
The work described in this paper aims to provide to the 
users an easy way to annotate and to structure wiki 
knowledge without requiring the learning of formal ontology 
languages like RDF or OWL. The research questions 
investigated in this paper are, firstly, how to guide users in 
annotating semantic wiki contents according to ontological 
models, and secondly, how to build domain ontologies 
taking unstructured knowledge as source of concepts and 
relations. The proposed solution for the first question is the 
development of a semantic wiki, called WiWork, based on 
Semantic Mediawiki (SMW) [3]. The latter solution is 
addressed through the synergy between various research 
fields: ontology modeling, Information Retrieval (IR) and 
statistical methodologies. This synergy supported authors in 
defining two domain ontologies, the WiWork Core ontology 
and the Labour Market ontology. 
The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 the issue 
of annotating wiki's unstructured knowledge is discussed, 
and the semantic wiki WiWork is presented with some of its 
main functionalities; Section 3 describes the methodology 
used for ontology modeling based on Information Retrieval 
and statistical techniques and shows the produced ontologies; 
in Section 4 a brief survey of related works is provided; 
finally, some concluding remarks and the future works are 
outlined in Section 5. 
II. 
UNSTRUCTURED WIKI KNOWLEDGE 
Wikis are being confirmed as the most widespread 
collaborative technology supporting knowledge creation and 
sharing on the Web [4]. Mainly, wikis allow users to 
collaboratively create and maintain textual unstructured 
content by adding, changing, and sharing contents by means 
of a web browser and a simple markup language. A wiki 
limitation is that the contents are expressed using natural 
language text and its meaning is not directly accessible to 
automated semantic processing tasks. Knowledge in a 
traditional wiki is freely structured through pages, hyperlinks 
and user-generated tags (e.g., categories to label pages). 
Currently, the features available for searching and reusing 
wiki knowledge are based on full text keyword search. 
Therefore, wiki knowledge is not automatically accessible 
for functionalities such as querying, reasoning and semantic 
browsing. Semantic wikis add these functionalities (with 
respect to ordinary wikis) for managing knowledge in more 
formal, machine-processable ways [5]. To achieve this goal 
semantic wikis have to structure knowledge according to 
some conceptual models (i.e., ontologies) and to annotate 
texts with metadata (semantic links and properties). 
Ontologies written in RDF or in OWL are used in semantic 
wikis as a reference for concepts used in metadata and 
annotations.  
Adding semantic annotations to wiki's textual content is a 
complex and laborious process, mainly for common users

who have no competencies in formal languages or 
knowledge representation methodologies. One solution can 
be to provide tools facilitating the annotation tasks, a step 
further is to suggest the users the metadata to use during the 
creation of pages. Since metadata and semantic annotation 
are machine-computable in a semantic wiki, they can be 
either represented directly in RDF. RDF is a common 
standard to enrich content with formal semantic metadata, 
but is not easily understandable to common users. To avoid 
this issue it is necessary to transform RDF triples extracted 
from ontologies in user-friendly semantic wiki annotations. 
Various types of semantic wiki annotations can be provided, 
distinguishing between formal and semi-formal annotations. 
Tagging is a type of semi-formal annotation. Tags usually 
consist of keywords (i.e., categories and properties) that the 
users include in the text of wiki's pages. Semantic links are 
another type of semi-formal annotation, they consist in 
structured tags. 
According to [6], structured tagging is a semi-formal 
annotation type in the form of keyword:value pairs. This 
annotation type allows for a simple representation of formal 
RDF triples: the resource to annotate is the subject, the 
keyword is the predicate and the value is the object of the 
triple. Such semi-formal annotation provides an intuitive and 
easy means to the users for transforming knowledge from 
human-only to machine-processable content and vice versa. 
In this way, they provide low barriers for user participation 
on wiki content enrichment with metadata. The methodology 
presented in this paper aims to help users to define semi-
formal annotations derived from formal ones. 
In the next sections, the authors present the main 
requirements to address the development of a semantic wiki, 
and, specifically, to enrich wiki content with semantic 
annotations according to well-defined ontologies. 
A. WiWork, a semantic wiki for public services domain 
In this section the authors describe how a semantic wiki 
for the CRISP (Interuniversity Research Centre on Public 
Services) [7] was developed. The research centre develops 
models, methodologies and tools for collecting, analyzing, 
and supporting data useful to define and improve services 
and policies for the public sector. Specifically, the centre 
designs, develops and uses information systems, Statistical 
Information Systems and portals for analyzing labour 
demand and supply [8]. The semantic wiki introduced in this 
paper, WiWork, was designed with the goal to provide 
documentations and manuals to domain experts and common 
users interested in CRISP activities and topics (WiWork is 
actually not accessible on the Web, but only on the CRISP 
intranet). Indeed, the wiki has actually about 14000 pages 
containing knowledge about the public services and focusing 
on the labour market, on the health, and on the education 
domains. WiWork has been developed to enrich labour 
market knowledge with semantic annotations to support 
tasks, such as matching between different texts, querying, 
and reasoning. 
The content in WiWork is mainly unstructured text 
devoted to describe the taxonomy of occupations of the 
Italian labour market. The wiki pages on occupations were 
generated taking as primary source the Italian classification 
scheme of occupations (called CP2011) created by Italian 
National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) [9]. This scheme is 
substantially 
based 
on 
the 
International 
Standard 
Classification of Occupation (ISCO08) criteria [10].  
The classification scheme arranges all the occupations in 
four level groups: Major, Sub-major, Minor and Unit. 
Moreover, each occupation is classified according to the kind 
of work performed, the skill level, and the specialization 
required to fulfill tasks and duties of the job. The scheme 
provides, for each occupation, a textual description 
explaining: specific tasks, competencies, required field of 
knowledge, tools and machinery used, materials used, kind 
of goods and services produced, etc. The corpora of those 
textual descriptions contain the most of the domain 
terminology, mostly in an unstructured form. An example of 
textual description is the following, extracted from ISCO08: 
"Information and communications technology service 
managers plan, direct, and coordinate the acquisition, 
development, maintenance and use of computer and 
telecommunication systems." Such a description contains 
some terms that can be processed only if properly structured, 
thus requiring the development and the implementation of 
various semantic technologies and the modeling of 
ontologies to enrich WiWork content with semantics. 
B. Semantic annotations in WiWork  
WiWork is based on Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) [3], 
an extension of the well-known MediaWiki, the software 
used for running Wikipedia. SMW allows one to add 
metadata to wiki pages and to perform queries over the 
metadata. Such extension makes the users able to enrich the 
text using semantic annotations in a way that is accessible 
both to the human readers and to the machines. The content 
can be created and maintained collaboratively, while the 
semantic insertion creates a flexible, extensible, and 
structured 
knowledge 
representation 
that 
can 
be 
automatically processed, enabling features such as semantic 
search and RDF data export. 
In particular, SMW provides the means to develop a 
flexible, structured data schema consisting of properties and 
classes. Properties correspond to semantic links or tags 
inserted into the page text; classes correspond to categories 
grouping pages. Both classes and properties are the metadata 
that a user can manipulate in the wiki using the 
keyword:value form.  
The following string [[uses::computer]] is an annotation 
example for the occupation description mentioned above, 
expressed in SMW syntax. This annotation can be 
transformed into a RDF triple where an instance of the 
Occupation concept is the subject having a semantic 
property uses as predicate, and an instance of Tool concept, 
computer, as object.  
This kind of annotation in SMW can be used for 
semantically enriching both the link between two pages (if 
computer would be a page title) and the property value (if 
computer would be managed as a string of a property value). 
In both cases it is necessary to define the meaning of 
properties and concepts and make it available for wiki users.

What follows is the RDF code exported by WiWork of the 
example: 
<property:uses 
rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> computer 
</property:uses>   
Authors used the Pywikipediabot framework [11] for 
creating an initial draft of the pages containing the raw text 
descriptions of the occupations taxonomy. A bot is an 
application for creating, accessing, and modifying wiki pages 
via scripts. To this scope some templates were created: a first 
template to structure all the pages containing information 
about occupations, including the description, the related 
categories and the occupation position into the classification 
scheme (e.g., to which Major group the occupation belongs); 
a second template structures pages according to the 
economic sectors related to the occupations, and a third 
template structures all the information about professional 
skills linked to occupations. The bot manages the three 
templates to automatically create pages on the occupations. 
Moreover, Semantic Forms, an extension of SMW for 
data editing [12], was used to facilitate the users to annotate 
wiki texts with metadata, linking the templates with the 
forms. The forms provide a graphical user interface allowing 
the users to create and exploit the templates without 
requiring the usage of wiki markups. Forms can be 
composed of several types of fields, e.g., title of occupation, 
name of economic sector etc. Each field can be related to a 
specific semantic annotation (e.g., uses property), by 
entering a value in a field (e.g., computer), the value is 
assigned to the corresponding property. All the information 
inserted via forms is automatically annotated using the 
properties specified during the template design time. 
Therefore, the combination of forms and templates allows 
the users to have a set of predefined semi-formal framework 
for structuring and annotating information.  
Furthermore, the authors plan to develop a program that 
reuse ProtÃ©gÃ©-OWL API [13] and Pywikipediabot to 
automatically transform RDF and OWL triples created with 
the ontology editor ProtÃ¨gÃ¨ [14] in SMW constructs (semi-
formal annotations) to insert in WiWork pages. A list of 
categories and properties is necessary to enrich the fields of 
templates and forms for automatically create annotated 
pages. The list can be provided taking OWL classes and 
properties modeled in domain ontologies, as is described in 
the next Section. 
III. 
DOMAIN ONTOLOGY MODELING 
In the following, the authors explain how two domain 
ontologies were built, the WiWork Core ontology and the 
Labour Market ontology, representing the conceptual models 
of the WiWork's content. Ontologies define a set of 
primitives, e.g., classes and properties, modeling a domain of 
knowledge [15]. Domain ontologies provide a shared and 
formal description of the concepts and relationships of a 
domain grounded on the knowledge and terminology in use 
in the domain [16].  
The goal of this ontology modeling task is to enrich the 
semantic wiki WiWork with conceptual models that can be 
used to structure and to manage knowledge in a machine-
processable way. 
The adopted ontology development methodology was 
divided in two steps. First step was supported by the ProtÃ©gÃ© 
ontology editor to define the preliminary classes and 
properties in OWL [14], i.e., the CRISP core concepts and 
the categories used in WiWork pages. Second step enriched 
and expanded the ontologies with additional concepts and 
instances, i.e., the domain concepts. Both the ontology 
modeling tasks were performed with the support of 
Information Retrieval techniques to extract concepts from 
the texts. More precisely, the latter task was performed to 
identify a set of candidate words and relations to model the 
occupation terminology. 
A. WiWork Core Ontology and Labour Market Ontology 
Ontologies are designed to define concepts and 
relationships related to the WiWork knowledge and they are 
still under development. The methodology described in this 
paper helped designing and structuring two different OWL 
ontologies. The first is the WiWork Core ontology 
representing the conceptual model defining the main topics, 
research 
fields, 
activities, 
communities, 
users, 
and 
technologies managed by the CRISP.  
The second is the Labour Market ontology, being the 
conceptual model of one specific WiWork topic, used to 
model the wiki pages about labour market knowledge. 
Specifically, this ontology has the specific aim to provide a 
set of predefined metadata that should facilitate users in 
annotating the occupation descriptions within the wiki. 
Although the ontologies are being developed separately, 
they can be seen as two integrated parts of a global 
conceptual model. In this model the WiWork Core concepts 
are in the upper levels, and the Labour Market concepts are 
in the lowest levels. The integration between the ontologies 
is obtained through the identification of relationships 
connecting similar or equivalent concepts, and through the 
identification of relationship types connecting the concepts 
and the instances extracted from the documents, as 
described in next Section B. 
B. Modeling via IR techniques 
Since textual documents have an important role in 
sharing knowledge and concepts about a domain, a corpus of 
textual documents related to labour market was selected to 
automatically extract domain knowledge. Documents are 
mainly 
unstructured 
texts 
focusing 
on 
occupation 
descriptions derived from the ISTAT classification scheme, 
and on textual documents produced by domain experts.  
An experiment has been performed by focusing on a sub-
set of occupation descriptions extracted from the whole 
corpora (about 400 descriptions). The subset has been 
identified in this way: data about worker transitions among 
the several occupations has been considered. The data of 
labour market are extracted from the administrative archives 
of an Italian Region. The term transition refers to a worker 
dismissing an employee and starting a new one having a 
different qualification. The transitions from an occupation to 
77

a different one have been counted, in a given observation 
period. A high transition number means that the two 
considered occupations are related. Then an occupation sub-
set was selected performing a cluster analysis using the 
transition count as relatedness criterion [17][18]. This allows 
one to identify groups of related occupations representing 
consistent areas and coherent worker career paths. It is out of 
the scope of this paper to describe in detail the clustering 
algorithm, it is enough to report that several clusters were 
identified, and a cluster of 30 occupations related to ICT 
domain (in the following ICT cluster) has been selected for 
further analysis. A few operations performed on the ICT 
cluster are described below for extracting terms and 
expanding the ontology. 
1) Cleansing and stopwords elimination 
In this first operation, the documents containing the 
occupation descriptions are cleansed by removing the stop 
words, e.g., articles, pronouns, adjectives, prepositions and 
conjunctions, common adverbs and non-informative verbs 
(e.g., to be). The stop words carry on little informative 
content, indeed they get discarded. A list of stop words was 
built and checked in the documents contents to eliminate 
these words from it. 
2) Keyword extraction, indexing and weighting 
The second operation is extracting the keywords and 
measuring their degree of importance within the processed 
documents corpora. To this scope, an IR technique was 
used, namely the TF-IDF (Term Frequency, Inverse 
Document Frequency) weighting scheme to extract, and 
assign weights to distinguished terms in a document 
[19][20][21]. Each document is described by a set of 
representative keywords called index terms. An index term 
is simply a word whose semantics distinguishes the 
document's main themes. The assignment of numerical 
weights captures the ability of an index term to distinguish 
the document's main themes. 
The intuition behind using the TF-IDF is that the best 
term candidates for inclusion in the ontology are those 
featured in certain individual documents, capable of 
distinguishing them from the remainder of the collection. 
This implies that the best terms should have high term 
frequencies (within the document), but low overall collection 
frequencies (i.e., it appears in very few other documents). 
The term importance is therefore obtained by multiplying the 
term frequency with the inverse document frequency (see for 
further details [22]). The result of the operation is a set of 
weighted keywords (i.e., nouns and verbs). The ones having 
the highest values identify the meaning and the terminology 
of documents. In the experiment performed 619 index terms 
were extracted from the ICT cluster. 
3) Grouping terms in two groups, common and specific 
concepts 
In this phase the set of index terms is analyzed to 
distinguish the more generic from the more specific. This 
distinction is just required to identify the position that each 
term could take within an ontology (i.e., in which class to 
include them). Some of the generic terms have been 
allocated to fill the WiWork Core ontology classes, while the 
specific terms have been used to fill the Labour Market 
ontology classes. On the basis of the results of previous 
operations, it has been observed by domain experts that the 
generic terms are those having the lowest TF-IDF values, 
while the specific ones have the highest values. Through few 
operations of further cleansing (e.g., all the repetitions 
arising when considering the terms of several documents) a 
set of 360 index terms was obtained. In this group, the 70 
highest TF-IDF values were selected representing the 
specific terms of the ICT cluster (19%). These terms are the 
best candidates to be defined and included as instances in the 
Labour Market ontology. Some of the remaining terms are 
the candidates for the WiWork Core ontology. 
4) Relationships identification 
This task is still under development, during the 
experiment it was performed manually, but in the future the 
authors would to improve these steps with semi-automatic 
processes. This operation took as input the two groups of 
terms (i.e., the specific and the generic set) and started 
manually building the relationships connecting the ontology 
concepts and instances. Some relationships can be mainly 
induced by the verbs connecting relevant words in the 
occupation descriptions. The set of 70 highest TF-IDF 
values includes some verbs representing specific actions or 
tasks of only a few occupations. An example of this type is 
the verb to write extracted from the description of Journalist 
occupation. It can be easily put as instance of class Task, in 
relation with the instance Journalist of class Role (see below 
the ontology classes). While the most generic verbs, e.g., to 
control, to perform, to use, that more frequently appear in 
the occupation descriptions (and having the lowest TF-IDF 
values), describe common actions and tasks of many 
occupations. They can be managed as relations linking 
instances of, e.g., Occupation or Role classes with Tool or 
Product classes.  
5) Concepts 
and 
relationships 
integration 
into 
ontologies 
Nevertheless, ontologies modeled with index terms 
extracted from corpora of documents hardly represent an 
exhaustive terminology of a domain. An integration of 
domain concepts is required to provide a complete 
knowledge of that domain. 
 The approach planned for integrating other concepts 
and relationships into the ontologies is based on the 
comparison of terms and relations (identified during the 
previous operations) with classes and properties defined in 
domain dictionaries or specialized taxonomies as external 
data sources. In the Labour Market domain some specialized 
taxonomies, i.e., ILO (International Labour Organization) 
and O*Net [23][24], are internationally shared as the best 
semantic resources for the domain terminology. They 
provide the skeleton on which such ontologies can be built, 
mainly contributing to the classification of domain concepts. 
Moreover, searching RDF or OWL ontologies existing 
on the Web that already defined and modeled those terms 
and relations could enrich such task. Thus is possible, for 
example, by using Semantic Web search engines (e.g., 
78

Sindice [25]), or by querying Linked Data [26] repositories 
via SPARQL (Simple Protocol and RDF Query Language) 
endpoints [27] (e.g., Dbpedia [28]), to retrieve useful 
semantic resources and to reuse concepts and relationships. 
C. Some results 
The experiment on the ICT cluster produced a set of 
candidate terms modeled as concepts and instances in the 
ontologies. The WiWork Core ontology concepts are mainly 
generic terms, including: Person, Service, Institution, 
Technology, Knowledge Occupation. The Labour Market 
ontology main concepts include Economic Sector, Product, 
Material, Tool, Event, Role. Within the latter ones several 
entities (i.e., concepts, relationships, and instances) could be 
defined from the set of candidate terms extracted with the IR 
techniques. Nevertheless, in many cases authors noted that 
some terms are very specific and appear in only one 
occupation description, these terms could be managed as 
instances of ontology classes.   
In Table 1 some candidate terms are classified according 
to the Labour Market ontology classes.

All those terms derive from the occupation descriptions 
and belong to the group of specific terms with the highest 
TF-IDF values (see point 3 in the previous Section B). 
Ontology classes and relationships have to be refined from 
the initial classification taxonomy of candidate terms. By 
taking as main references the ILO and O*Net resources it is 
possible to specify some ontology parts, e.g., Sector class 
with its sub-classes and instances as represented in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Classes and instances of Labour Market ontology 
The candidate terms may be then annotated by users in 
WiWork pages using the property and category labels 
defined in the ontologies, and transformed in SMW 
constructs with the support of ProtÃ©gÃ©-OWL API and 
Pywikipediabot with an upcoming program described above. 
Moreover, users could propose new terms or lexical 
variations to include in the ontological models by exploiting 
the collaborative wiki functions. 
IV. 
RELATED WORK 
Several semantic wikis based on SMW extension exist, 
in various domains. To the best of the authors knowledge a 
similar semantic wiki on the labour market domain does not 
exist. One of the closest wikis to the one introduced in this 
paper is that of [29], that showed how difficult it is to find 
the right balance between structured and unstructured data 
in a semantic portal of a research centre. Another wiki based 
on ontological models is LinkedLab [30], a Linked Data 
solution 
for 
data 
management 
regarding 
research 
communities publishing and linking structured data on the 
Web using RDF. 
Important for this paper is also the work of [31] giving 
an overview of how semantic wikis manage structured, 
semi-structured and unstructured data. In the field of 
ontology engineering the use of wikis is a widespread 
research topic, confirmed by works of [32][6].  
Within the enormous literature related to ontology 
building some methodologies helped authors. In particular, 
the methodologies characterized by the synergy between 
various disciplines such as text mining, knowledge 
acquisition from texts, IR, corpus linguistics or even 
terminology [16]. In this context, authors found similarities 
with the research presented in this paper in the work of [33] 
that uses the TF-IDF to select the best candidate terms for 
ontologies, with the difference that their work is based on n-
gram detection. It is also relevant the work of [34] that uses 
TF-IDF to identify different types of relationships in a 
specific step of his ontology building methodology. 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The paper proposed a semantic wiki, WiWork, to enrich 
wiki unstructured contents using semantic annotations 
referring to ontological models. The paper showed also how 
to model domain ontologies required to structure the labour 
market domain knowledge managed by the wiki. The 
semantic wiki showed several advantages: it facilitates the 
task of structuring the knowledge according to ontologies, it 
guides users in annotating texts in an easy way and it 
provides means to process and reuse machine-readable 
knowledge.  
Moreover, a particular methodology was presented 
based on IR and statistical techniques to support the 
ontology modeling tasks. The results of an initial 
experimentation in this direction are showed, and they 
represent part of a work that authors are pursuing within a 
multidisciplinary research team.

In the future, the authors plan to include into the WiWork 
architecture some reasoning and querying features and to 
experiment it with both structured data (e.g., user-generated 
annotations encoded in RDF) and unstructured one (e.g., 
wiki pages about health domain). Moreover, WiWork will be 
made available on the Web and linked with triple stores and 
SPARQL endpoints, with the aim to support publishing of 
semantic documentation for Linked Open Data sets about 
public sector domains.
