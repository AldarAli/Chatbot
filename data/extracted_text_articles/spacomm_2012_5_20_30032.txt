Abstract—This paper presents a new iterative multiuser
detection algorithm for asynchronous spectrally-efﬁcient M-ary
continuous-phase modulation in additive white Gaussian noise.
This detection algorithm is closely related to another algorithm
that was recently proposed by the same authors, but it follows
from applying the sum-product algorithm to a different factor
graph of the same multiuser detection problem. This, in turn,
results in a different way to approximate the marginal bit
a-posteriori probabilities that are used to perform minimum bit
error rate multiuser detection. The girth of the factor graph
considered in this contribution is twice as large, which is known
to be potentially beneﬁcial for the accuracy of the a-posteriori
probabilities. The size of the largest factor graph variable
alphabets also multiplies with M, rendering the straightforward
application
of
the
sum-product
algorithm
more
complex.
Through approximating a suitable set of sum-product messages
by a Gaussian distribution, this complexity is signiﬁcantly
reduced. For a set of system parameters yielding high spectral
efﬁciency, the resulting algorithm signiﬁcantly outperforms the
previously proposed solution.
Keywords— Factor Graph; Multiuser Detection; Spectral Ef-
ﬁciency; Continuous Phase Modulation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Continuous-phase modulation (CPM) is a modulation
method commonly used in wireless modems [1]. It is attractive
because of its high power and spectral efﬁciency, and because
of its robustness to non-linearities. Although the optimal detec-
tion [2] of a bit interleaved coded CPM signal is prohibitively
complex, there exist approximate iterative detectors with rea-
sonable complexity that yield a very good performance. Such
practical detectors can be derived from the sum-product (SP)
algorithm and the factor graph (FG) framework [3]. In the past
few years, several advanced techniques have been proposed
for multiuser (MU) detection of spectrally efﬁcient (SE) CPM
systems [4], [5], [6]. In such systems, the spacing between
the carrier frequencies that are assigned to different users is
kept small, such that the leakage of the neighboring signal
energy into the desired frequency band cannot be ignored. This
leakage signal is referred to as inter-user interference (IUI).
In this paper, we derive a new FG based MU detector for
SE CPM. The proposed receiver algorithm will be referred
to as g6-MU-FG-GA. Numerical results indicate that, for a
set of system parameters yielding high spectral efﬁciency, the
novel g6-MU-FG-GA algorithm signiﬁcantly outperforms the
existing solutions in terms of reliability and/or complexity.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II reports
on the state-of-the-art in MU bit detection of SE CPM sys-
tems. Section III describes the considered system model. The
proposed g6-MU-FG-GA detector is derived in Section IV.
Its computational complexity and memory requirements are
adressed in Section V. Section VI presents numerical results
on the packet error rate (PER) performance of the SU-FG,
the g10-MU-FG-2IU, the g3-MU-FG-GA and the g6-MU-
FG-GA detectors. The main conclusions are summarized in
Section VII.
II. STATE-OF-THE-ART
In [6], an intuitive approach to MU detection of SE CPM is
proposed. The considered ad-hoc receiver executes a practical
form of MU detection by iterating between conventional FG-
based single user (SU) detectors and a separate module for
IUI cancellation. A similar solution is also considered as a
reference system in [5]. This receiver is further referred to as
SU-FG.
A more fundamental approach to MU detection is to con-
sider a FG of the actual MU detection problem. Such a FG
is not unique. It represents one particular way to factorize the
joint a-posteriori probability (APP) of the bit sequences from
all the users, given the observed received MU signal. Running
the SP algorithm on this graph yields an approximation of the
marginal bit APPs. Using the latter APPs to perform maximum
a posteriori (MAP) bit detection results in minimum bit error
rate MU detection. Choosing a FG is a matter of trading off
the accuracy of the obtained marginal bit APPs against the
computational complexity associated with their evaluation. An
important parameter for the accuracy of the SP algorithm is
the minimum cycle length (i.e., girth) of the graph, while the
complexity of the procedure primarily depends on the number
of edges and the size of the variable alphabets in the graph.
Optimal MU detection is obtained when the employed
FG corresponds to a tree (cycle-less graph). In that case,
running the SP algorithm is straightforward and yields the
exact marginal bit APPs. Using these APPs to perform MAP
bit detection results in minimum bit error rate performance.
Unfortunately, the complexity of this optimal MU detector is
extremely high and exponential in the number of users [5]. It
is therefore not suited for use in practice and one has to resort
to approximations.

The practical MU detector proposed in [5] is based on
another FG, which contains cycles. The complexity of this
receiver is lower than that of the optimal MU detector, but
still increases exponentially with the number of users, which
becomes impractical as the number of users increases. As an
option to further decrease the complexity, the authors propose
to apply the simplifying assumption that only the two most
adjacent users signiﬁcantly contribute to the IUI. This results
in a FG with girth 10, with a signiﬁcantly reduced the degree
of connectivity. The corresponding receiver will be referred
to as g10-MU-FG-2IU. It has a good performance and a
linear complexity in the number of users, but it still involves
quite a large number of computations and it also requires a
considerable amount of memory.
Another low-complexity MU FG-based detection algorithm
was proposed in [4]. It results from approximating, in a
FG with girth only 3, a suitable set of SP messages by
Gaussian distribution functions. The computational complexity
and memory requirement of this detector is considerably
lower than for the g10-MU-FG-2IU detector from [5]. A
signiﬁcant performance improvement over the SU-FG detector
was demonstrated for a particular SE CPM scheme, in [4]. This
receiver algorithm will be referred to as g3-MU-FG-GA.
In this paper, we derive a new variant of the algorithm from
[4]: g6-MU-FG-GA. The idea of approximating a suitable set
of SP messages by a Gaussian distribution is applied to a
different FG of the same detection problem. This FG is slightly
more complex than the one used to derive the g3-MU-FG-GA
detector from [4], but it has cycles of minimum length 6, which
is twice as long as the shortest cycles in [4]. This is potentially
beneﬁcial for the accuracy of the marginal bit APPs that result
from applying the SP algorithm.

The resulting symbols are then used to generate the complex
envelope s(u)

Here, T is the symbol period, h = K/P is the modulation

account that q (t) = 0 for t ≤ 0 and q (t) = 0.5 for t ≥ LT,
we can rewrite (2) for nT ≤ t ≤ (n + 1) T as:

A group of U users are simultaneously active. They asyn-
chronously transmit frequency-shifted versions of their signals
s(u)
SU (t), u = 1, 2, ..., U over an additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel, which is typical for satellite communica-
tions. The short-hand notations b, c, a, σ and S respectively
collect the information bit sequences, the coded bit sequences,
the data symbol sequences, the CPM state vector sequences
and the CPM state transition identiﬁer sequences from all the
users: b =
	
b(1), b(2), ..., b(U)

a =

and
S =
	
S(1), S(2), ..., S(U)
. The phase offset, frequency shift
and time delay associated with user u (u = 1, 2, ..., U) are
equal to θ(u), f (u)/T and τ (u)T, with f (u) and τ (u) denoting
the dimensionless relative (to the symbol interval T) frequency
shift and time delay, and are assumed to be known at the
receiver. We further assume that, within a given group of
users, all signals are received with the same power. The
complex baseband representation s (t) of the received signal
component, which aggregates the contributions of all users
from a same group is given by s (t) = U

(although this is not strictly true in the case of CPM signals
whose spectrum has an inﬁnite support) with bandwidth lower
than Rs/2T, where Rs is a proper integer value (determined
by the spectral shape of the considered CPM scheme and the

is applied to a low-pass anti-aliasing ﬁlter and sampled at
Rs samples per symbol interval; the corresponding sampling
interval is Ts = T/Rs. It is assumed that the spacing between

IV. PROPOSED G6-MU-FG-GA RECEIVER: DERIVATION
When an information bit is detected erroneously at the re-
ceiver, a bit error occurs. Optimal detection, which minimizes
the bit error probability is achieved by performing MAP bit
detection [2]:
ˆb(u)
k
= arg max
b∈{0,1} p

b(u)
k
= b |r

, ∀k.
(11)
The APPs p

b(u)
k
|r

involved in (11) are the marginals
of p (b |r), with p (b |r) the probability of b, given r. An
efﬁcient way to jointly compute these marginals is to apply the
SP algorithm to a FG representing a suitable factorization of
the joint probability p (b, x |r) of b and x, where x represents
a convenient set of additional variables [3].
In the following, we derive the proposed g6-MU-FG-GA
detector.
We construct a FG for deriving p

b(u)
k

by employ-
ing (c, a, σ0, σN, S, s) as additional variables. The vector s
results from stacking the U vectors s(u), u = 1, 2, ..., U,
where s(u) consists of all the samples (both zero and non-
zero valued) of s(u) (t) from (9), i.e., taken at instants kTs.
The vector s(u) itself results from stacking the vectors s(u)
x ,
where s(u)
x
contains the Rs samples s(u) (iTs + xT), i =
0, 1, ..., Rs − 1, that correspond to the xth symbol interval
[xT, (x + 1) T[ of the receiver signal s(u) (t) from (9). In
general, these samples are spread over the

minimum length are between the trellis constraint nodes of
two interfering users; they are of length 6. This is relatively
short, but twice as long as for the FG employed to derive the
low-complexity MU detector from [4].

The notation for the SP messages traveling along the FG
edges is also introduced in the ﬁgure. The rules for computing
the FG messages are the SP rules from [3], followed by a
normalization step such that all messages communicated along
the edges of the FG can be interpreted as probability mass
functions. Because the graph contains cycles (paths from a
node to itself), the SP algorithm is an iterative procedure that,
after convergence, yields only an approximation of the APPs

. The initialization and message passing scheduling
strategy is outlined in Algorithm 1. In most practical scenarios
and without further approximations, the multiuser processing
step in Algorithm 1 is prohibitively complex. This follows
directly from applying the SP algorithm and it is an inevitable
consequence of the large amount of variable edges entering the
observation function node and the large size of the associated
variable alphabet. It follows from (1)-(4), (6)-(8) and (9) that,

A common approach to simplify the SP algorithm is to
approximate messages by a canonical distribution. We will
apply this approach to the FG from Figure 1, which will lead
to a novel receiver structure. Based on the discussion in [7], we
propose to approximate the messages

The approximation (15) signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the multiuser
processing step of Algorithm 1. Exploiting the property that
the sum of independent Gaussian variables (signal samples
from different users v ̸= u) is Gaussian with mean equal
to the sum of the means and variance equal to the sum of
the variances, the SP messages M (u)

V. PROPOSED G6-MU-FG-GA RECEIVER: COMPLEXITY
The proposed g6-MU-FG-GA algorithm involves the same
steps as the g3-MU-FG-GA detection algorithm from [4], but
the execution of these steps it is slightly more complex. In
particular, the messages M (u)
f,n, M (u)
b,n , M (u)
T O,n and M (u)
OT,n
computed in the g6-MU-FG-GA detector take M times more
values than the corresponding messages computed in the g3-
MU-FG-GA detector from [4]. All these values have to be
re-computed and stored at each iteration. The number of
operations that is required to update the messages MT M,n
according to the SP rules and the number of additions that is
needed to evaluate the means μ(u)
q
from (16) is also M times
larger for g6-MU-FG-GA than for g3-MU-FG-GA.
The SU-FG detection algorithm from [5], [6] has about
the same computational load and memory requirement as the
g3-MU-FG-GA detector. The structure of the g10-MU-FG-
2IU detector from [5] differs substantially from that of the
proposed detectors g3-MU-FG-GA and g6-MU-FG-GA. Per
user, per iteration and per symbol period, 2 additional mes-
sages have to be evaluated and stored. Both these additional
messages take as much values as the messages M (u)
OT,n in
the proposed g6-MU-FG-GA detector. Besides, the number
of operations involved in the computation of these additional
messages is large and contributes signiﬁcantly to the overall
complexity of the g10-MU-FG-2IU detector.
Table I compares the memory requirements (expressed in
number of real values to be stored, MEM) and the compu-
tational complexity (expressed in the number of elementary
operation between two real arguments, OP) of the proposed
detection algorithm to those of the g3-MU-FG-GA and the
g10-MU-FG-2IU detector. Only the contributions to the re-
quired memory and the number of operations that result from
parts in which the g6-MU-FG-GA, the g3-MU-FG-GA and the
g10-MU-FG-2IU detector differ from each other are taken into
account. These contributions provide a solid basis for com-
paring the considered algorithms because they dominate the
detector’s total memory requirements and total computational
complexity, respectively. Operations that are executed only
once, at the start of the iterative process, are also not taken into
account. General closed form expressions are provided, as well
as numerical results for the simulation set-up in Section VI.
For the g10-MU-FG-2IU detector, we distinguish between
memory that needs to be allocated dynamically (ﬁrst term)
and static memory (second term). For the g6-MU-FG-GA and
the g3-MU-FG-GA detectors, the amount of static memory
that is needed is negligibly small as compared to the dynamic
memory resources they require, and therefore only the latter
is reported.
The g10-MU-FG-2IU detector requires a considerably larger
amount of memory than the proposed g6-MU-FG-GA detector,
which in turn requires about M times as much memory as
the g3-MU-FG-GA detector. The complexity of the g6-MU-
FG-GA detector is also signiﬁcantly less complex than the
g10-MU-FG-2IU detector. As opposed to the complexity of
the g10-MU-FG-2IU detector, the complexity of the proposed
g6-MU-FG-GA detector increases less than proportional with
the number of users in a group. Finally, the complexity of the
g6-MU-FG-GA detector is about M times as large as that of
the g3-MU-FG-GA detector.
A fair complexity comparison of the different algorithms
must also take into account the number of iterations that
actually needs to be performed by the receiver (in order to
meet some given performance speciﬁcations). The required
number of iterations for the different algorithms will be
considered in Section VI.
VI. NUMERICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS
Computer simulations have been run to evaluate the perfor-
mance of the proposed g6-MU-FG-GA detector. For compar-
ison, the performance of the simple ad-hoc SU-FG detector
(also used as a reference system in [5]), the performance
of the g3-MU-FG-GA algorithm from [4] and the perfor-
mance of the overly complex graph-based g10-MU-FG-2IU
receiver from [5] are evaluated as well. We consider one
of the MU BIC-CPM schemes with the highest asymptotic
(for U → ∞) spectral efﬁciency reported in [8]. Each user
asynchronously transmits an information bit vector of size
1024. Gray mapping and pseudo-random bit interleaving are
employed. The outer code is a (128,115) extended BCH code.
The CPM parameters are M = 4, L = 2, h = 1/3 and
q (t) =

, t ∈ [0, LT] (raised-cosine pulse
shaping). Equal normalized nominal frequency spacings of 0.8
are used such that f (u) = 0.8

u − U+1


. Groups of U = 17
active users are considered. In each simulation new normalized
time delays τ (u), u = 1, 2, ..., 17, are taken independently
from a random uniform distribution over [0, 8.5]. The inﬂu-
ence of adjacent user groups is neglected. The received signal
is sampled Rs = 16 times per symbol period. In this case, the
complexity (per user, per iteration and per transmitted symbol)
of the proposed g6-MU-FG-GA detector is about 4 times as
large as that of the g3-MU-FG-GA detector from [4], but
only about 1/8 times as large as that of the g10-MU-FG-2IU
detector from [5]. At every iteration, hard decisions about the
information bits are made from the corresponding a posteriori
information bit probabilities, after which a genie checks for bit
errors; the receiver stops iterating after a maximum number of
iterations imax, or when all information bits have been detected
correctly. Figure 2 shows the PER of the middle user (u = 9)
for several values of imax, at a given value of Eb/N0, with

Values of imax up to 30 are considered for SU-FG, g3-
MU-FG-GA and g6-MU-FG-GA. The latter two algorithms
are reasonably close to convergence after 29 iterations. The
SU-FG detector converges faster; for Eb/N0 above 6.5 dB,
the PER of this algorithm hardly decreases between the 20th
and the 30th iteration. For this particular simulation set-up,
the proposed g6-MU-FG-GA performs much better than g3-
MU-FG-GA from [4]. The gain in terms of PER amounts to
several dB. The g6-MU-FG-GA also outperforms the ad-hoc
SU-FG for PERs smaller than 3.10−5. Above PER = 3.10−5,
SU-FG yields a better performance. Values of imax up to 7
are considered for g10-MU-FG-2IU. This is too little to reach
convergence. This overly complex algorithm results in a lower
PER than g6-MU-FG-GA and SU-FG, after signiﬁcantly less
iterations. However, 5 or more iterations of g10-MU-FG-2IU
require considerably more computation time than 20 iterations
of SU-FG or 30 iterations of g6-MU-FG-GA.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have derived a new MU detection proce-
dure for asynchronous spectrally efﬁcient CPM. In practice,
the technique employs simple IUI cancellation, yet its deriva-
tion from the SP algorithm and a FG of the MU detection
problem with girth 6 is theoretically sound. It is characterized
by a relatively low computational complexity. For a set of
system parameters yielding very high spectral efﬁciency, it is
shown to outperform the existing solutions either in terms of
PER performance (SU-FG from [6] and g3-MU-FG-GA from
[4]) or computational complexity (g10-MU-FG-2IU from [5]).
Overall, the proposed detection algorithm can be a valuable
alternative to more complex algorithms for systems where
the main concerns are the computational complexity and the
memory requirements.
