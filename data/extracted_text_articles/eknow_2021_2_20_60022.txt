Abstract- In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in 
techniques for generating market comments from stock 
prices automatically. However, even today, it is still manually 
generated by analyst. In this paper, we propose a method for 
generating "comments on stock price fluctuations" included 
in market comments in order to reduce the workload of 
analysts. The proposed method learns stock price fluctuations 
and the corresponding expressions, generates comments, and 
completes market conditions comments by assigning them to 
prepared canned sentences. As a result of our experiments, we 
found that the features used to generate them are effective 
and the proposed method can accurately generate market 
comments.

INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, there has been an increase in the use 
of data in various fields, such as weather, sports, medicine 
and finance. However, when the data is large or complex, 
it is difficult for a person without expert knowledge to 
understand it, and even if he or she is an expert, it takes 
time to understand the data and extract the important 
elements. One way to make effective use of such data is 
the data-to-text technology. This is a technology that 
expresses the outline of data in text to make it easier for 
humans to interpret, and it has been gaining attention due 
to its increased demand in recent years. 
The task of generating market comments from stock 
price data, which is the subject of this research, is also a 
type of data-to-text technology. Currently, market 
commentary is generated by analysts, who are experts in 
researching and analyzing social conditions, etc. They 
analyze stock prices after they are released and generate 
market comment. However, it takes a lot of time and effort 
for analysts to generate full-text market comments from 
stock prices. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method 
for generating a part of the market comment in order to 
reduce the effort required for analysts to generate market 
comment. Specifically, we extract expressions related to 
the price movements of stock prices and their fluctuation 
ranges, and then generate comments by learning the price 
movements of stock prices and expressions through 
machine learning. By applying the generated comments to 
the pre-prepared format, the system automatically 
generates the quantitative analysis results in the market 
comment, and as a result, analysts can concentrate on their 
core business, such as factor analysis. 
In this paper, we extract various features from the time 
series data and convert them into text based on the task of 
generating market comments on the Nikkei Stock Average. 
First, we form long-term and short-term time series data to 
capture the changes in the time series stock price data. Next, 
we extract 12 important phrases from NQN(Nikkei Quick 
News) so that we can generate a expression in NQN. These 
phrases are frequent occurrences in the first sentence of the 
market comment, and the four main expressions are "続落
(continued to decline)", "続伸(continued to rise)", "反発
(rebound)", and " 反 落 (reactionary fall)", with " 大 幅
(large)" and "小幅(small)" added for a total of 12. By 
mapping these expressions to the price movements of stock 
prices, we create a single data set for learning. 
In order to compare our results with those of a 
previous study by Murakami et al [1], we unified the 
similar expressions among the generated ones. In addition, 
we omit sentences that do not need to be generated 
automatically using the neural network. We will verify if 
there is any change in the experimental results. 
 
II. RELATED WORK/METHODS 
In this section, we present a related work and related 
methods that this paper referred to. 
A. Related works 
Various studies have been conducted on data-to-text 
technology, which automatically generates a summary of 
time-series data in text that is easy for humans to interpret. 
For example, research has been conducted to automatically 
generate text about weather forecasts from time-series 
weather information [2], to generate text from clinical data 
to assist doctors and nurses in decision making [3], and to 
generate feedback text for students from time-series data 
that records their learning status within a certain period [4]. 
In the past, the mainstream of data-to-text research has 
been the generation of text using manually created rules. 
However, in recent years, with the development of 
information and communication technology, large-scale 
and complex data has become readily available, and 
interest in machine-learning type methods that generate

text based on large-scale correspondence between data and 
text has been increasing. For example, research has been 
conducted on the use of machine learning in various data-
to-text techniques, such as image caption generation [5], 
which generates descriptions from image data, and weather 
forecast text generation from molded weather data [6]. 
B. Related methods 
There are various approaches to the technology of 
generating market comment from various perspectives. 
For example, there are techniques to generate factors of 
change, such as events that are said to have affected the 
price movement of the Nikkei Stock Average and 
information on other stocks [7], to control the generated 
text by inputting topics that represent the content of the 
generated market comment in addition to the Nikkei Stock 
Average data [8], and to generate characteristics, such as 
the history of the price of the stock and time-dependent 
expressions [1].   
In this research, we are working on a technique to 
generate text by appropriately selecting words that 
represent the direction of price movement and the range of 
fluctuation of stock prices. 
 
III. PROPOSED METHOD 
In this section, we present a method for extracting 
words and phrases that represent the price movement and 
fluctuation range of stock prices from the Nikkei Stock 
Average and NQN, and the data used in this paper. 
A. Overview 
Figure 1 below shows the execution procedure of the 
proposed method. 
First, we molded the data in order to create a 
correspondence between stock price data and article data. 
Since the article data contains many noisy expressions, we 
set the conditions to remove the noise and extracted the 
original phrases of the expressions generated from the 
article data. The details will be described later. 
Next is the stock price data, which also contains a lot 
of noise and is inefficient for machine learning, so we 
molded it into a form that is easy to learn. 
We then created a correspondence between three days of 
stock price data and a single expression and used it to start 
learning. For machine learning, we used a Multilayer 
Perceptron (MLP), which is commonly used as an encoder. 
Finally, using the trained data, we input test data 
including stock price data to predict the expression. The 
predicted expressions are then substituted into the prepared 
format, and the market condition comments are completed. 
F value between the predicted expression and the correct 
data is calculated and used as an evaluation criterion. 
B. Dataset 
In this paper, we use the Nikkei Stock Average as 
stock price data and NQN as article data. The data used are 
for the four years from 2014 to 2017. TABLE Ⅰ and TABLE 
Ⅱ show examples of the Nikkei Stock Average and NQN 
used in this study. The Nikkei Stock Average is the five-
minute version, and the NQN is used for the part that can 
extract the expressions to be generated.

C. Pre-processing 
In various fields, such as image processing and natural 
language processing, it is common to perform prepr- 
-ocessing in order to generalize machine learning models 
and to remove noise from data. Also in this paper, 
preprocessing is applied to the Nikkei Stock Average data, 
which is numerical data. We used the standardization and 
the difference from the previous day as the preprocessing 
methods for the numerical data. The equations of the 
processing methods used are shown below. 
                   𝑥𝑠𝑡𝑑 = (𝑥𝑖 − 𝜇)/𝜃                         (1) 
                    𝑥𝑚𝑜𝑣𝑒 = 𝑥𝑖 − 𝑟𝑖             (2) 
𝑥𝑖 represents the stock price. 
In (1), standardization is performed using the data x, 
mean value μ, and standard deviation θ used for learning. 
In (2) calculates the difference between the price 𝑥𝑖 
at each time step from the previous day's closing price 𝑟𝑖 
in order to capture the change in price from the previous 
day's closing price. 
As in the previous study [1], Prepared “XShort”, a one-day 
stock price data consisting of 62-time steps and “XLong”, 
a long-term stock price data using the past closing price as 
an input, as a short-term time series data to capture short-
term and long-term stock price fluctuations. However, it 
was difficult to extract the expression of the short-term 
data from the articles, so this paper mainly deals with the 
long-term stock price data. 
As for the molding of the article data, since there is 
more than one expression extracted from NQN in a day, 
the first expression of the day is treated as the expression 
of the date. 
IV. EXPERIMENT 
TABLE Ⅲ compares the data set used in the previous 
study with the data set used in this study. The comparison 
with the previous paper is made only where the expressions 
are covered. The reason for the difference in the data used 
in the training data is that the data of the Nikkei Stock 
Average for 2013 was in a different format from the data 
of other years, making it difficult to extract the data. 
Although there are some differences between the Nikkei 
225 data of 2013 and 2017, the differences have been 
compensated by increasing the number of train data. In 
addition, the test data are all the same, so the results are 
expected to be fine.

Several methods have been used in previous studies 
as well as in this paper, and the results here refer to the 
method that produced the highest F value. The red letters 
represent the best results within Xlong. The blue letters are 
the ones with good results, but without the expression for 
the stock price fluctuation range. This is because when 
generating comments, NQN does not produce expressions 
at five-minute version, so I used a rule base to generate 
expressions without stock price fluctuation ranges. 
Although it is not directly related to the experimental 
results, it is described following the execution results of 
previous studies. 
In this table, we can see that the two types of preprocessing 
give the best results in terms of Xlong alone. 
 
VI. DISCUSSIONS 
In this section, we will discuss the results. 
A. Expressions about stock price fluctuations and 
Xshort. 
NQN does not produce expressions for every 5 
minutes, but only for important time periods (9:00, 12:00, 
15:00). Therefore, in the case of short-term data that deals 
with five-minute data, it is necessary to extract expressions 
mechanically or by using other data as training data and 
extracting expressions by predicting them. In this paper, 
the former method was used. In producing the expressions 
for short-term data, we used the difference from the 
previous day in two steps. Specifically, two steps of the 
previous day's difference are used, with a positive value 
indicating "続伸(continue to rise)" and a negative value 
indicating " 続 落 (continue to decline)". However, the 
thresholds for large or small at this time are not defined, 
resulting in the results shown in Table3. The NQN shows 
several instances of large and small falls, but the conditions 
for their appearance could not be determined because of 
only two steps of difference from the previous day, so it 
was not possible to set a threshold.     The reason for 
this is that the analysts who write the market commentary 
assign "large" and "small" according to their sensitivity.  
Therefore, the results show a high F value because there 
were only four expressions for three years of data. One of 
the future tasks will be to determine the threshold for 
mechanically generating expressions related to the range 
of fluctuation. 
 
B. Extraction methods considered based on differences 
with previous studies. 
TABLE V shows the comparable areas in this paper and 
previous studies. The present study produced high F values 
for all comparable expressions. This is thought to be due 
to the fact that similar expressions in the previous studies, 
such as "反発(rebound)" and "上げに転じる(start to 
move up)", were treated as the same in this study. In order 
to improve the accuracy of expression generation, we 
unified the expressions in this study. It was found that 
unifying the expressions increased the accuracy by about 
10-20%.

C. Number of expressions and number of data 
References 
The results show, there are some expressions whose 
occurrence rate is 0, and the problem is that the number of 
data is too large for the number of expressions prepared. 
The following is a table of the number of expressions 
that exist in the data (TABLE Ⅵ.) and the occurrence rate 
of the expression that represents the fluctuation range of 
stock prices in the data used (TABLE Ⅶ). The red letters 
in TABLE VI and TABLE VII are the three selected from 
the lowest values. 
Looking at TABLE Ⅶ, we can see that there are 
several expressions that are never generated. As in the case 
of Short, if the training data is biased, the result will be like 
this, so it is desirable to have training data where all 
expressions are generated to some extent. Or it is necessary 
to review the expressions to be extracted.

VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we extracted expressions related to the 
price movements of stock prices and their fluctuation 
ranges using the Nikkei Stock Average and NQN, learned 
the expressions and price movements by machine learning, 
and generated expressions for given stock prices. We 
compared the generated expressions with those extracted 
from the original article and verified which training data 
was superior in terms of correct answer rate and F value. 
In conclusion the results of the training data with two 
types of preprocessing implemented exceeded those of the 
previous study. This is thought to be due to the unification 
of similar expressions in the previous study. 
In addition, when generating expressions related to 
the range of variation of values, such as "大幅(Large)" and 
"小幅(Small)," it turned out to be difficult to generate them 
unless the training data contained this expressions with a 
certain degree of probability. 
Future tasks include setting the threshold for 
generating expressions related to the range of variation 
mechanically, creating better training data, and reviewing 
the expressions.
