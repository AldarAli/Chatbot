Abstract—The interdisciplinary nature of environmental 
research centres, dealing with geospatial data, analysis and 
environmental modelling on a daily basis, requires specific 
methods and technologies in the field of geospatial information 
management. The large amount of generated information has 
to be stored, catalogued, visualised and treated effectively for 
further analysis. The Public Research Centre Henri Tudor has 
set up a prototype system to create an integrated geospatial 
data infrastructure, serving the needs of various user profiles 
from novice level to advanced and experienced data analysts 
and modellers. The paper will show solutions on how to give a 
broad range of users access to an integrated infrastructure. 
This is achieved by introducing different user interfaces: an 
easy to use web interface for beginners - advanced web 
mapping and feature services coupled to desktop GIS 
applications for intermediates - direct data base access, making 
use of cutting-edge geospatial tools and spatially distributed 
modelling algorithms for experts. The system is fully functional 
on all user levels and based on free and open source software. 
It is integrating current standards of the Open Geospatial 
Consortium, to assure exchange with stakeholders and to 
guarantee its further functional extensibility. 
 
Keywords - Geospatial data management; geospatial data 
infrastructure; Web services; Web GIS; INSPIRE. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Since the enactment of the Infrastructure for Spatial 
Information in Europe (INSPIRE) directive [1] in 2007 the 
development 
of 
geospatial 
information 
services 
has 
increased. Stakeholders are obliged to create functional data 
and software infrastructures and to be compliant to defined 
data 
exchange 
guidelines. 
Web-enabled 
geospatial 
technologies are key components [2]; data base management 
systems with components to store spatial objects [3], data 
access libraries [4], map rendering engines [5] and web front 
ends are constantly adapted and developed to meet different 
needs.  
These components, though interactive, are merely data 
viewers; the information flow has to be more open and 
bidirectional when users operate with the data by further 
geospatial analysis or by creating new data sets. In this case 
the focus is on the interaction between data storage, single 
software components and modelling tools. If a geospatial 
data management infrastructure has to handle operations like 
real-time mapping or automated interpolations [6], then 
further components have to be integrated. Examples for these 
are algorithms powered by geostatistical software tools like 
R and Gstat [7] or GIS software libraries that are working on 
data base level like TerraLib [8]. 
In the recent years, the Public Research Centre Henri 
Tudor has faced an increasing amount of geospatial 
information, generated and compiled by its daily work for 
more and more demanding models. This called for integrated 
geospatial data management techniques and a concept to 
design a solution based on free and open source software. 
The solution to this is a geospatial data infrastructure that is 
able to operate as a central hub, serving geospatial 
information to provide the necessary data to each 
collaborator. 
This paper reflects on the possibilities of this proposition 
to build a fully functional integrated geospatial data 
infrastructure with free and open source components by the 
given constraints and requirements. This will be described in 
the next section, followed by an extensive description of 
used components and how they interact in Section III. 
Finally, a short description is given in Section IV on how the 
system is used in the institute so far and which major 
improvements will have to be made in the future. 
II. 
SYSTEM DESIGN, REQUIREMENTS AND CONSTRAINTS 
The topic of geospatial data was quite new at the institute 
and the collaborators were introduced to existing techniques 
and demo applications on the Internet illustrating how 
workflows could look like with advanced data management 
tools. In several brainstorming sessions certain requirements 
were identified and a prototype was designed. This led to a 
fully functional geospatial data infrastructure with advanced 
data management capabilities. 
One major constraint was that the whole infrastructure 
had to be built on free and open source software products. 
The main aim of this is to reduce licensing costs and to 
increase interoperability and extensibility considering open

standards. 
With 
the 
interdisciplinary 
nature 
of 
an 
environmental research institute the system should be fully 
scalable to serve the needs of the various user profiles in 
particular. 
An easy to use web based spatial information system 
should be an entry point for exploration (meta data search) 
and visualisation of all connected data pools. Furthermore, 
expert users should be able to make use of advanced 
geospatial data analysis and modelling with connected 
programming environments such as R [9], shown in 
Figure 1, and geographic information systems like GRASS 
GIS [10]; both embedded in high performance computing 
facilities. 
 
 
Another component is the meta data management and 
data exchange in standardised formats as defined by the 
Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) [11]. This ensures the 
compliance with infrastructures on the national level (e.g. 
GeoPortal Luxembourg [12]) and the fulfilment of 
international reporting needs compatible with the INSPIRE 
directives. Meta data are a crucial part to clearly identify data 
sets and have information about extent, quality, spatial and 
temporal schema, spatial reference, and distribution of digital 
geographic data. One wide spread standard and “best 
practice” is ISO 19115 [13] with its XML implementation 
schema ISO 19139 [14]. In addition, the general effort in 
maintenance and supervision of the whole system should be 
as small as possible. 
These requirements and constraints were leading to a first 
sketch of the infrastructure design shown in Figure 2 
summarising the most important parts of the geospatial data 
infrastructure. 
The central part is represented by the physical data 
storage system, which consists of one or more data bases and 
provides interfaces for exchange with software clients, such 
as GIS and other modelling environments used in the 
research centre. An application server is coupled to the 
physical storage and represents the high performance 
computing facilities of the institute. For data exploration, 
administration 
and 
maintenance 
the 
geospatial 
data 
infrastructure should provide a meta data system as well as 
administration tools. 
An example workflow is the geospatial analysis and 
automated mapping of field measured soil properties (e.g. 
texture, content of organic carbon and water uptake rate) 
using automated mapping algorithms as developed in the 
INTAMAP project [15]. A user can upload the relevant data 
sets via a web interface to the central data base where he is 
able to set corresponding access privileges to his working 
group. If the gathered data does not need further analysis in a 
laboratory, field devices with compatible software could 
upload it via cellular network without effort. Later, different 
group members are able to access the data with the 
connected software products of their choice for an initial 
overview mapping or to check data for consistency. After 
positive data checks, further geostatistical analysis, such as 
interpolation with kriging methods [16] will be done and the 
data as well as analysis results are fed into the meta data base 
and the web mapping interface. This ensures fast access of 
necessary up-to-date information to all collaborators. 
 
 
Figure 2. Overview of the main components of the prototype design. 
 
With the implementation of Web Processing services (WPS) 
[17] users are able to access and run predefined models on 
the application server. Necessary data sets and parameters 
have to be included in the server request. This is a favourably 
tool for non-advanced users to run complex calculations with 
automated error checking capabilities and visualise outputs 
directly in the WebGIS as overlay maps. This is a recent 
achievement running a cast shadow calculation module in a 
city area implemented in PyWPS [18]. We are using the 
OGC WPS standard which offers native support for GRASS 
GIS and supports a generic WPS Java Script library. 
III. 
THE GEOSPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURE 
The design of the geospatial data infrastructure can be 
seen in Figure 3, with special consideration of the given 
constraints and user needs. The figure shows the used 
software components and their arrangement and connection 
from a technical point of view. It is organized in five 
different layers with their unique assigned functions in the 
system.

The data pools at the bottom are representing the physical 
storage of different data sets. Vector and meta data are stored 
in a PostgreSQL [19] data base system with PostGIS [20] 
extension to allow the storage of spatial objects as well. 
Currently, raster data is stored simply file based, with ideas 
to move and couple it to the above mentioned PostgreSQL 
set up driven by PostGIS Raster [21]. This project is about to 
implement the raster data type as much as possible like 
vector type data in PostGIS. It will also offer a single set of 
overlay SQL functions operating seamlessly on vector and 
raster data. General user access and data security is handled 
on data base level by user login and password protection. 
With user and group privileges on table level inside the data 
base a granular access right system can be established to 
protect sensitive information. 
Libraries like GDAL/OGR [22] make sure that access 
and coordinate transformation of geospatial objects is 
possible. A map server like MapServer [23] is able to create 
different 
OGC 
compliant 
services, 
such 
as 
Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS) and 
Web Coverage Service (WCS) [18] and is providing the 
rendering of maps for the web client p.mapper [24]. This 
web interface is mainly based on PHP MapScript and is 
accessing data sets directly via the MapServer rendering 
engine. 
Direct data access for data analysis software, such as the 
wide spread Microsoft Excel, or the more advanced 
environments like R and S-Plus could be realised through 
ODBC/JDBC 
interfaces. 
Desktop 
GIS 
clients, 
like 
GRASS GIS, uDig [25] or Quantum GIS [26] can access the 
data storage directly with built-in interfaces to visualize or 
edit geospatial data sets. 
Another important component of the infrastructure is a 
catalogue service for meta data and a corresponding web 
interface like GeoNetwork [27]. It allows the user to 
interactively search for sets of any information in the system 
via related meta data. Furthermore it is a crucial part of 
compatibility to other infrastructures because GeoNetwork is 
acting as a CSW (Catalogue Service Web) service to publish 
data 
sets 
in 
higher-level 
infrastructures 
(e.g. 
Geoportal Luxembourg, INSPIRE services). Further it can 
connect to them as client as well. This feature enables 
harvesting of foreign data sets to link them into the own 
system by OGC web services. 
The geospatial data infrastructure and its diverse options 
of data access enable the acquisition and compilation of 
relevant information in an integrated way for all types of user 
levels. It ensures easy and compatible data exchange and it is 
fully functional and well integrated in the daily work flow of 
collaborators. 
A main tool for data research is the WebGIS and the web 
based meta data application where most basic information on 
available data can be retrieved. A most fundamentally work 
flow, such as search, selection, visualisation of geospatial 
information and printing of basic maps can easily be done 
via the web map interface adding full support to basic or 
novice users. Users with advanced geocomputation skills are 
using the WebGIS itself mainly for discussion purposes 
during meetings. Nevertheless, they are creating and 
analysing data sets by making use of powerful server 
hardware and further installed software products like 
PostGIS, which is offering spatial data queries and 
geoprocessing methodologies for vector data directly 
implemented into SQL (Structured Query Language). 
Further applications could be automated mapping of 
environmental parameters or statistical analysis tools built 
into the web based map interface to provide further insight to 
data to the more inexperienced user. The Public Research 
Centre Henri Tudor is also involved in geospatial uncertainty 
analysis and modelling within the developments of the 
UncertWeb project [28] and its Uncertainty Markup 
Language (UncertML). These are of importance in the near 
future, e.g. in decision making at administrative levels. 
All functional blocks are built on free and open source 
software (FOSS) components. FOSS is used in many 
applications and operational infrastructures, making use of 
advantages like the constant and continuous development 
and on-going support by the developer community. The 
monetary benefit of free and open source software could be 
reduced in the beginning phase because of extra expenses 
caused by an additional need in development of features that 
are not available out-of-the-box. In terms of desktop GIS 
software, standardized interfaces to OGC services are 
available due to the effectiveness of OGC standards and the 
active community support. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The presented infrastructure has the following benefits: 
improved data organisation and management, high data 
security and fast availability of information on all user levels. 
The system is able to connect all GIS and modelling tools 
that are used in the institute seamlessly and present them in 
an integrated way to the user. 
As European frameworks like INSPIRE are just being 
implemented, the integration of distributed data sources will 
continue in the future. This integration will be gradual, 
adding data when it is available and prepared for integration. 
The system provides all necessary interfaces to achieve an 
easy and straightforward integration of all OGC compliant 
data sources. At the same time it also complies with all OGC 
standards to provide data for many other geospatial data 
infrastructures and applications. 
Future work will have to be done in the fields of a more 
seamless WPS integration and the set up of more calculation 
modules to assist collaborators. The storage of raster data 
should be integrated in the data base system by the recent 
development of PostGIS Raster. This would allow making 
use of basic raster map algebra, also in combination with 
vector data, without using dedicated GIS tools. Furthermore, 
the overall usability of the web frontend should be improved 
with better support for data queries and quick look summary 
statistics of available data sets. In addition, the system should 
be referenced in the national geospatial data infrastructure to 
assure an exchange of information and make use of 
meta data services.
