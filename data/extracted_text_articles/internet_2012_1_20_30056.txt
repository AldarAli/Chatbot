Abstract—Edge-directed routing, a paradigm where sources
and sinks of trafﬁc, rather than the network, specify the com-
munication path has recently gained attention as a means to
deal effectively with potential conﬂicts that may arise between
various stakeholders in the future Internet. In this paper, we
use a simple economic model to show that contrary to current
economic thinking, networks can deploy edge-directed routing
without raising prices, provided that the service results in a
relative increase in external trafﬁc that outweighs the relative
increase in costs. However, when edge-directed routing merely
results in trafﬁc shift from one path to another, then price
increases are required to make it economically viable. Hence,
we recommend that edge-directed routing protocols put in place
payment mechanisms and support systems in their design to
facilitate various pricing strategies.

ture; economic incentives.
I. INTRODUCTION
Armed with lessons from almost two decades of commercial
operation of the Internet, network architects realize the need
to build a future Internet that is fundamentally secure and
ﬂexible enough to support diverse uses. At the same time,
there is increasing awareness that, in addition to providing
the right economic incentives to stimulate adoption, any new
architecture must possess mechanisms to deal effectively with
conﬂicts that may arise between various stakeholders.
It is not uncommon for an end-host’s objectives to conﬂict
with those of its provider. Unfortunately, the original architec-
ture of the Internet lacks effective mechanisms to address such
conﬂicts. In particular, de-facto network control over routing
precludes an end-host from utilizing alternate paths to the
default network-provider path. Source routing was introduced
in IPv4 and IPv6 to allow sources of trafﬁc to override default
network paths. However, the majority of routers on the Internet
do not support this functionality for a variety of reasons [1],
[2]. Consequently, end-hosts resort to ad hoc ﬁxes, such as
overlay networks, built on top of the Internet in order to
achieve performance and other security goals [3], [4].
One way to deal with conﬂicts between various stakeholders
is to design future Internet architectures to explicitly support
choice and/or competition at all levels of the architecture [5],
[6]. Designing for choice implies that the architecture allows
different stakeholders to express their preferences for different
services [5]. On the other hand, designing for competition
refers to the ability of stakeholders to “express their prefer-
ences for services by different providers” [6]. To illustrate,
edge networks can currently express a preference for a ﬁrst-
hop network provider. Nothing prevents an edge from having
multiple ﬁrst-hop providers, who provide the same or different
services, if desired. Hence, one can conclude that the Internet
is designed for both choice and competition with regards to
ﬁrst-hop providers. However, an edge network has no binding
input in the decisions about the intermediate networks used to
transport packets, once a ﬁrst-hop provider has been chosen.
Likewise, the destination or sink has no binding input in
how packets are routed to it, even when it has multiple ﬁrst-
hop providers. In order words, the Internet is not designed for
choice with regards to the nth-hop provider for both sources
and sinks, when n > 1. This lack of nth-hop provider choice
is the root cause of some of the conﬂicts between different
stakeholders. For instance, the current Internet architecture
does not support competition for the provision of intermediary
services, such as ﬁltering or virus scanning, by entities that are
not ﬁrst-hop providers because a sink cannot guarantee that all
of its packets pass through that intermediary.
The above realization has motivated several architecture
proposals that emphasize nth-hop provider choice and compe-
tition in routing [7]–[10]. It has also led to the development
of a number of standalone routing protocols that provide path
choice to end-hosts (e.g., [11]). We refer to these proposals
collectively as edge-directed routing protocols.
Previous studies on edge-directed routing primarily focus
on two main areas. The ﬁrst area of work develops protocols
to support edge-directed routing capabilities (e.g., [7]–[13]),
whereas the second studies the equilibrium properties of
networks built around edge-directed routing (e.g., [14]–[17]).
Unfortunately, most studies to date have largely ignored in-
centive compatibility, which is vital to the successful adoption
of any architecture. Speciﬁcally, previous work fail to provide
any useful analysis of the economic incentives of different
stakeholders to deploy and use architectures based on nth-hop
provider choice.
The few studies in this area focus on understanding how
network operators can maintain control over the ﬂow of trafﬁc
through their networks when they relinquish control of path
choices to the edge. For instance, Masuda and Whang use a
linear programming formulation to show that networks can
achieve any desirable trafﬁc ﬂow by using route pricing, node
pricing or source-sink pricing [18]. They further show that the
trafﬁc ﬂow that results from route or node pricing maximizes
social welfare for all network participants. Kelly [19] and
Laskowski et al. [20] obtain similar results.
However, neither of these studies addresses how such a

pricing mechanism is determined, the welfare effects if prices
are inaccurately determined, or the information requirements
needed to implement the pricing mechanism. It is very likely
that the costs due to the information requirements associated
with implementing elaborate pricing schemes alone will erode
any beneﬁts obtained from edge-directed routing [21]. Addi-
tionally, neither study sheds any light on whether ISPs will
be better off ﬁnancially from deploying edge-directed routing,
even with perfectly determined route prices. Without any solid
understanding of the ﬁnancial risks, network operators will be
reluctant to deploy edge-directed routing protocols.
In this paper, we build a simple economic model to inves-
tigate the incentives of a network operator to deploy edge-
directed inter-domain routing. Speciﬁcally, we investigate the
conditions under which network operators are better off from
deploying edge-directed routing, taking into account a few
pricing strategies that are relatively easy to implement. Our
model shows that contrary to the arguments usually advocated
in literature (e.g., [5], [20]), networks may be able to deploy
edge-directed routing without increasing prices, provided that
edge-directed routing results in a relative increase in external
trafﬁc that is at least equivalent to the relative increase in costs.
On the other hand, we show that if edge-directed routing
merely shifts trafﬁc from one path to another, then price
increases will be required to make it economically viable.
Thus, edge-directed routing protocols must incorporate pay-
ment mechanisms to support different pricing strategies. Inter-
estingly, we also show that a ﬂat-rate fee, with very little in-
formation requirements, will be enough to make edge-directed
routing economically viable under most circumstances.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we describe our network and cost model. Next, we use the
model to derive the conditions that make a network operator
better off from deploying edge-directed routing. We follow
this with a discussion of real-world deployment issues and
the implications for edge-directed routing protocol design in
Section III. We conclude and discuss some future research
directions in Section IV.
II. MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
Even though edge routing capability can be implemented
at either the end-host or autonomous system (AS) level, it
may be more practical to implement it at the AS level for
scalability reasons. Besides, a large fraction of end-users
consider the default network-selected paths sufﬁcient for their
needs and will therefore delegate path selection to the AS [11].
Moreover, it is likely that entities who are willing to pay for
the capabilities of edge-directed routing consist of enterprises,
educational institutions and other large organizations that can
be treated as ASes. One could imagine a scenario where
such an entity implements edge-directed routing on behalf
of end-hosts within its control. Because of these reasons, the
discussions which follow assume that edge-directed routing is
implemented at the AS level.
We consider a scenario where a transit network provider,
Network C, provides connectivity to N customers, who send
trafﬁc to various destinations. There exist potentially multiple
paths to reach each destination outside Network C. We refer
to destinations that are not customers or peers of Network C
as external destinations. We consider only a single external
destination for simplicity. An extension to multiple destina-
tions is straightforward and leads to the same results. We
think of each distinct path to an external destination as a
different routing service (RS). We assume that Network C
has the potential to offer M different routing services to
reach an external destination and represent the RS set by
S =
￿
S0, S1, S2, . . . , SM￿
. We illustrate this in Figure 1.
In the ﬁgure, Network C has the potential to offer four
routing services for its customers to reach Network L, namely
CDFIJL, CDFIKL, CEHIJL and CEHIKL.
Fig. 1. Network C has the potential to offer several paths to reach a particular
destination. Each different path can be considered as a routing service (RS). In
the above, Network C has the potential to offer four routing services to reach
Network L, namely CDFIJL, CDFIKL, CEHIJL and CEHIKL.
Network C has two options for routing packets. It could
advertise a default RS, S0, and select the actual RS used to
route packets on behalf of its customers or allow customers to
specify an RS from S. For a rational network provider, S0 is
the path that minimizes its external connectivity costs. In our
example in Figure 1, CDFIKL is the default RS to reach
Network L from Network C. This follows from the fact that
Network I will only propagate path IKL in BGP because it
earns more revenues when it routes trafﬁc to L through path
IK. In general, Network C can predict its own costs involved
in advertising only S0. However, the costs that Network C
incurs when it allows its customers to choose from S are not
well understood. In addition, it is not obvious how Network C
can recover additional costs that may arise from this routing
ﬂexibility. In what follows, we provide some insights into the
cost implications of allowing customers to choose from S.
Let us assume that Network C faces a total demand
for external connectivity, in packets per second, given by
d = ￿N
i=1 di[S], where di[S] is the demand for external
connectivity from customer i. In the rest of the paper, we
use f[x] to indicate that f is a function of x. Unlike most
previous work, which assumes that demand is independent
of the number of available paths through the network, we
explicitly make a provision for this dependency. We believe
that the existence of some paths may alter trafﬁc demand
for various reasons. For instance, a customer concerned about
trafﬁc monitoring will choose to send more trafﬁc when some
perceived trustworthy paths become available. We assume that
Network C has provisioned its network to support a total
demand for external connectivity d.

In Figure 2, we show the costs that Network C incurs
to route packets. In the short term, some costs such as,
local loop to reach the customer, internal bandwidth within
Network C and equipment, do not depend on the volume
of external trafﬁc. We denote these costs, in dollars, by
K. On the other hand, external connectivity costs depend
on both the volume of external trafﬁc, d, and the path,
since each path has an associated cost. Thus, we denote the
external bandwidth costs, in dollars per byte transferred, by
B [d[S]]. Additionally, Network C incurs costs, which increase
with M, to distribute and manage S and to account and
bill for usage. Finally, we assume that Network C faces a
twice differentiable and additive cost function of the form
C [B[d[S]], S, K] = C [B[d[S]] + C [S, K], which satisﬁes
∂C
∂d = C￿ [B[d[S]]] |d=d0 and ∂2C
∂d2 = C￿￿ [B[d[S]]] |d=d0 < 0.
The latter captures economies of scale in bandwidth costs.
Fig. 2.
Network C incurs several costs to provide both external and internal
connectivity to its customers. External connectivity costs depend on the path
chosen, whereas internal connectivity costs are assumed to be under Network
C’s control and ﬁxed in the short-term.
A. Network-Controlled Routing
The cost to meet a total demand of d packets per second, in
dollars, using S0 is given by Costnc = C
￿
B[d[S0]], S0, K
￿
.
Due to the presence of both ﬁxed and variable components
in the cost structure, we assume that Network C uses a two-
part pricing strategy to recover its costs [22]. The choice of a
two-part pricing strategy simpliﬁes our analysis, but does not
affect our results and is consistent with the interconnection
scenario in the Internet [23]. The two-part price consists of
a ﬁxed access charge over period T, Ei[S0, K], in dollars,
and a usage-based charge, Wi
￿
di[S0]
￿
, in dollars per byte
transferred by customer i. One could think of the ﬁxed
component as the ﬂat rate fee paid for internal connectivity.
Thus, over a period of T seconds, customer i pays a total
of Ei[S0, K]+Wi
￿
di[S0]
￿
di[S0]FT dollars for connectivity,
where F denotes the average packet size in bytes.
To reﬂect the situation in the current Internet peering
ecosystem, we assume that the market for external connectivity
is competitive. We do not make any assumptions about how
Network C sets Ei[S0, K] for each customer, but we assume
that ￿N
i Ei[S0, K] ≥ C
￿
S0, K
￿
. Given a competitive market
scenario, Network C cannot set Wi
￿
di[S0]
￿
greater than the
standalone costs that customer i will incur to provide the
same service. Otherwise, customer i will have incentives to
contract with another provider or provide the service itself.
A rational cost-minimizing customer will choose S0 when it
undertakes to provide its own external connectivity. Therefore,
it is reasonable for Network C to set Wi

is the cost to satisfy customer i’s exter-
nal bandwidth demand. In order to capture the fact that Internet
transit pricing exhibits economies of scale in volume, we
assume that the cost function for external bandwidth is strictly

necessarily implies that Network C obtains a pos-
itive proﬁt, that is, Πnc > 0.
B. Edge-Directed Routing
In edge-directed routing, Network C makes S available to
customers and does not impose any restrictions on the path that
can be used to reach any destination. We consider a scenario
where Network C has provisioned its network to support S
based on some a priori assumptions about d. We do not
address the question of how Network C selects S. Rather, we
set out to ﬁnd the forms that Wi [di[S]] and Ei[S, K] should
take, in order to ensure that Network C is not worse off when
it offers edge-directed routing based on S.

One could think of potentially inﬁnite ways to set Wi [di[S]]
and Ei[S, K] to satisfy (2). In what follows, we consider three
pricing strategies and evaluate the conditions under which
those strategies satisfy (2). In the ﬁrst, Network C charges
the same prices for both edge-directed and network-controlled
routing. In the second, Network C introduces some increment
on the ﬁxed price component. In the third, the usage-based
component of the price is based on the customer’s standalone
costs incurred to use the requested RS.
Case a : Keep same pricing as network-controlled routing:
In this case, Network C sets Wi [di[S]] =

is the differ-

network-controlled routing.
We see from (3) that the terms on the right side are positive.
This follows from the fact that C [S, K] > C
￿
S0, K
￿
. Also,
∆B is zero only when all transit links are priced equally and
trafﬁc distribution is symmetric on all links with and without
edge-directed routing, which is highly unlikely. Given this
observation, we immediately recognize one scenario where
(3) fails to hold. If the existence of a large set of path
choices merely shifts demand from one path to another without
increasing the total external demand, then di[S] = di[S0],
which makes the term on the left side of (3) equal zero. Thus,
in such a scenario, Network C is worse off when it deploys
edge-directed routing without raising prices.
One could imagine that a larger set of path choices increases
external trafﬁc ﬂowing through Network C, but does not
affect total external trafﬁc ﬂowing through all networks. This
could happen when customers move trafﬁc away from self-
provisioned (or contracted) links to Network C. If the increase
in demand is large enough, then it is likely that Network C
will be better off when it offers edge-directed routing without
raising prices. In the short-term, Network C will obtain a
competitive advantage by doing so. However, in the long-term,
offering path choices will become a competitive necessity
which will drive down industry-wide proﬁts. Still, it is possible
that a larger set of path choices increases external trafﬁc
ﬂowing through the entire network. Under such a scenario,
all networks will eventually ﬁnd it a competitive necessity
to deploy edge-directed routing without increasing prices,
provided that the cost increase for doing so are smaller than
the value of increased demand resulting from offering edge-
directed routing. Unlike the previous case, however, it may be
possible for all networks to maintain their proﬁt margins in the
long-run if external trafﬁc increases across the entire network.
To obtain some idea about the kind of trafﬁc increase
required to make the provision of edge-directed routing jus-
tiﬁable without price hikes, we consider a simple case where
all customers of Network C send the same volume of external
trafﬁc and pay the same prices for usage and access. Under
this special case, constraint (3) can be expressed as

where ς =

nc is the proﬁt margin that Network C
obtains when it undertakes network-controlled routing.
Let us deﬁne δ =
di[S]−di[S0]
di[S0]
as the relative increase in
external demand as a result of edge-directed routing. Based on
the pricing structure assumed in our model, we can also make
the approximation
C[B[di[S0]]]+Ei[S0,K]
C[B[di[S0]]]
≈
C[B[d[S0]],S0,K]
C[B[d[S0]]]
.
When changes in total costs are mostly due to changes in
external bandwidth costs, which is very reasonable when d ≤
D, then we can derive δ from (4) and (5) as
δ ≥
∆B
C [B [d[S0]]](1 − ς) .
(6)
Equation (6) simply states that when proﬁt margins are
close to zero, then the relative increase in external trafﬁc must
be at least equal to the relative increase in bandwidth costs
in order to justify the deployment of edge-directed routing
without a price increase in a well-provisioned network. For
instance, when external bandwidth costs increase by 10%, then
external trafﬁc must also increase by at least 10% in order
to make edge-directed routing worthwhile in the absence of
a price increase. It is interesting to note that networks that
only possess peering links (Tier 1 networks) do not suffer any
adverse economic consequences from edge-directed routing,
as long as, it does not reduce trafﬁc ﬂow.
Case b: Increase ﬁxed component of price: In a scenario
where the increase in external trafﬁc from S is not large
enough to overcome the additional costs associated with
edge-directed routing, Network C could increase the ﬁxed
access component of the price it charges to customers. This
scenario is likely to occur when edge-directed routing leads
to signiﬁcantly higher ﬁxed costs (e.g. due to the need for the
network to increase capacity to accommodate trafﬁc) and/or
external bandwidth costs. The idea here is that Network C sets
Ei[S, K] in such a way that ￿N
i Ei[S, K] ≥ C[S, K], while
keeping Wi [di[S]] =
C[B[di[S0]]]
di[S0]F T
.
In order to prevent distortion effects in pricing, we consider
the case where ￿N
i Ei[S, K] = C[S, K]. In setting Ei[S, K],
Network C could distribute the recovery burden equally among
all customers or target customers who make use of edge-
directed routing. It may be desirable to target the latter, in order
to prevent other customers from switching to other network
providers. Compared to the earlier discussion, we see that we
require a smaller increase in external trafﬁc in order to satisfy
(3) when ∆E = 0.
Case c: Charge based on actual RS used: When the
two pricing schemes described above fail to work, then
Network C needs to charge path-based usage prices in order
to make edge-directed routing economically viable. This is
the conclusion reached in previous studies such as [18]–[20].
Unlike these studies, we go a step further to suggest the
forms that the prices could take. For instance, the ﬁxed access
charges could be set such that ￿N
i Ei[S, K] = C[S, K],
with the burden preferably shifted to customers who make
use of edge-directed routing. If the network can estimate the
demand from customers that will result from S, then it can
set usage-based prices equal to the standalone costs for the
customers to acquire the service. In other words, Network C
sets Wi [d[S]] = C[B[di[S]]]
di[S]F T . Customers who obtain a utility
from S will have incentives to pay the increased usage-based
price, whereas other customers pay the price for using the
default network path.

To summarize, our analysis suggests that edge-directed
routing protocols that do not introduce signiﬁcant ﬁxed costs
can be deployed without any increase in prices, provided that
they lead to a relative increase in external trafﬁc roughly
equivalent to the relative increase in external bandwidth costs.
Even when ﬁxed costs increase, networks could recover these
costs by raising ﬁxed access charges for customers who utilize
edge-directed routing. From the network provider’s point of
view, such pricing schemes are desirable because they incur
minimum overhead to account and bill for usage. Hence,
designers must minimize the ﬁxed costs associated with edge-
directed routing protocols in order to provide the maximum
incentives for networks to deploy them.
Our discussion so far has focused on Network C as the
provider of edge-directed routing. In truth, the arguments we
have made and the pricing strategies we have discussed apply
recursively from Tier 1 Networks (F, G, H, and I in Figure 1)
to Network C. These Tier 1 networks offer edge-directed
routing to their customers based on an RS set S￿. Our results
suggest that Tier 1 networks can offer a large RS set, since
by deﬁnition, they do not pay for transit. The customers may
then act as providers to other networks and offer edge-directed
routing based on an RS set S, where S ∈ S￿. Thus, our model
is consistent with future Internet architectures like SCION (see
[10]), which relies on a top-down notion of trust (and payment)
relationships among networks.
III. REAL WORLD DEPLOYMENT ISSUES
In this section, we identify key features required to support
the deployment of edge-directed routing. After this, we high-
light some business opportunities enabled by edge-directed
routing and the potential costs to exploit them.
A. Features Required to Support Edge-Directed Routing
We identify ﬁve features necessary for commercial deploy-
ment of any edge-directed routing protocol namely knowledge,
choice, enforcement, metering and veriﬁcation.
1) Knowledge: First, edge-directed routing protocols must
provide a scalable means for edges to obtain knowledge of a
set of secure and policy-complaint paths to a given destination.
In particular, the process of path discovery must recognize
and address the business needs of ISPs. For example, ISPs
may want to control the diversity of alternative paths exposed
to the edge. Even though most previous work discuss ways to
provide knowledge about paths, more work is needed to design
scalable and incentive-compatible knowledge dissemination
mechanisms for edge-directed routing.
2) Choice: Secondly, edge-directed routing protocols must
equip the source, sink or both with the capability to specify
a policy-compliant path. Additionally, there must be mecha-
nisms for intermediate networks on the path to consent to the
use of the speciﬁed paths. In our model, the latter requirement
was achieved by making S a subset of S￿, but that is not the
only way one could meet this requirement.
In order to overcome some of the security issues that
plagued source routing in IP networks, we note that the
protocol must provide both the source and the sink with the
joint responsibility to specify a policy compliant end-to-end
path. This is the approach taken in proposals such as SCION
[10] and ICING [9]. Alternatively, the protocol could insist
that sinks ﬁnd an independent path back to the source. It may
be more desirable to give joint responsibility to the source and
sink because this allows both parties to effectively deal with
scenarios where they have conﬂicting requirements.
3) Enforcement: Thirdly, the protocol must provide a scal-
able means for the routers in origin and transit networks to
enforce that the ASes to which they belong have approved
the use of a speciﬁc network resource. This is especially im-
portant if networks charge for edge-directed routing, since the
network needs to distinguish between paying and non-paying
customers. This could be achieved using technical mechanisms
such as cryptography embedded within the protocol or with
other means outside the protocol such as admission control.
This area, which was largely ignored in the past, has attracted
some attention recently [9], [10]. For example, SCION uses
an opaque ﬁeld in the path construction beacon to account
for the use of speciﬁc resources [10]. Similarly, ICING uses
proofs of consent (PoCs), issued by networks on the path, as
a means to enforce the use of network resources [9].
4) Metering: In addition to enforcement, the network needs
to measure and track the amount of trafﬁc that customers send
in order to implement usage-based pricing. The information
requirements associated with different pricing strategies will
determine the viability of offering services based on that pric-
ing model. In general, path-based pricing will require the most
information to implement. Thus, ISPs will be reluctant to offer
services based on this pricing model unless the information
costs are negligible. However, designing metering schemes
with negligible information costs poses a huge challenge. To
date, most of the literature fail to address this important issue.
5) Veriﬁcation: Whereas enforcement allows the network
provider to account for resource use, veriﬁcation enables
the customer to attest that a requested edge-directed routing
service
was
delivered.
This
requirement
is
particularly
important when the customer pays for the requested service.
It has been shown by Laskowski and Chuang that, at a
minimum, contractible monitors, deﬁned as “a distributed
algorithmic mechanism that runs on the network graph,
and outputs, to speciﬁc nodes, proofs about current or past
network behavior that can serve as input to a contract”, must
be present in order to induce networks to deploy innovative
technologies
[24].
Most
edge-directed
routing
protocols
lack any features for veriﬁcation, thereby dampening any
incentives for networks to deploy and use them.
Based on the above discussion, we reckon that edge-directed
routing protocols that support all the above features could
lead to signiﬁcant packet and communication overhead. In
ICING for instance, a random packet is expected to have
about 45% packet overhead [9]. Further, the designers estimate
that ICING will add about 23% overhead to total trafﬁc,
which is quite signiﬁcant [9]. Indeed, the extra usage cost
associated with path choice may well be due to the increase
in overhead, which means that the network provider has to
acquire and pay more for external bandwidth, even when

all path choices cost the same per byte. Hence, an analysis
of typical communication overhead incurred to provide the
features above for proposed protocols will prove very useful
to understand the viability of some business opportunities.
B. Business Opportunities
A secure and policy-compliant edge-directed routing pro-
tocol could enable providers to deploy and monetize new
and enhanced routing capabilities. Business models based
on charging a premium for edge-directed routing require
mechanisms to distinguish between paying and non-paying
customers. They also depend on the existence of veriﬁcation
mechanisms or other notions of trust between the network
provider and the customer [24].
Unlike network-controlled routing, edge-directed routing
guarantees nth-hop provider choice for n > 1. This capability
opens up the possibility to purchase network services such as
ﬁltering, DDoS protection and virus scanning from entities
other than the ﬁrst-hop network provider [7], [9]. Without
edge-directed routing, edges either have to purchase such
services from the ﬁrst-hop provider or through other providers
that use BGP tricks to appear as a ﬁrst-hop provider. The main
limitation with purchasing middlebox services in this way is
that edges are consigned to only a single middlebox service
provider and cannot selectively choose which packets avoid
the middlebox.
On the contrary, edge-directed routing allows a sink to
simply specify a path that contains the middlebox provider for
a subset of packets that requires the use of the service. The
sink could even contract with multiple middlebox providers
for different classes of services and dynamically decide which
packets go through which middlebox service. This approach
provides greater ﬂexibility and choice to edge networks.
Nonetheless, this business opportunity imposes new costs that
could instigate new conﬂicts among Internet stakeholders and
needs to be investigated further.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have shown that it may be possible for net-
work providers to deploy edge-directed routing without raising
prices, provided that it results in a relative increase in external
trafﬁc that is at least equivalent to the relative increase in costs.
However, when edge-directed routing merely shifts the same
external trafﬁc from one path to another, then a price increase
is required to justify its deployment. For this, we have shown
that a ﬂat-rate increase, which requires relatively little infor-
mation to implement, will sufﬁce in most cases. Nevertheless,
it is important that edge-directed routing protocols provide
payment mechanisms to support various pricing strategies. In
addition, we have identiﬁed some essential features needed to
support real-world deployment of edge-directed routing. These
features include mechanisms to provide knowledge, choice,
enforcement, metering and veriﬁcation.
It will be interesting to investigate the relative magnitude
of the welfare loss that results from using our simple pricing
strategy, as opposed to route or node pricing. We plan to
explore this area in our future work. We also hope to further
explore the potential business opportunities that edge-directed
routing could open up and identify the challenges that must
be overcome in order to exploit these opportunities.
