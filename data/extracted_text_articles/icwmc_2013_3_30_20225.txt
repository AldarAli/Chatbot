Abstract—In this paper, we describe novel channel estimation 
schemes for terrestrial digital multimedia broadcasting (T-
DMB) receivers and present further results on their 
performance under fading channels. In order to improve the 
performance, novel channel estimation schemes utilize the 
weighted moving average. Numerical results show that the 
novel channel estimation schemes outperform the conventional 
scheme with approximately 2~3dB in the symbol error rate 
performance under fading channels.

 INTRODUCTION 
In South Korea, the mobile broadcasting standard for the 
terrestrial digital multimedia broadcasting (T-DMB) is based 
on the Eureka-147 digital audio broadcasting (DAB) system 
[1]. In the T-DMB system, the orthogonal frequency division 
multiplexing (OFDM) is used for signal transmission [2][3]. 
The T-DMB system supports the broadcasting of moving 
pictures and their reception in harsh conditions such as 
places surrounded by high-rise buildings and highways 
where vehicles are moving at very high speed. 
Recently, a coherent detection method has been 
developed to improve the reception performance of T-DMB 
receivers [4]. For the coherent detection, a one-tap equalizer 
in the frequency domain is used. The tap coefficients of the 
equalizer are obtained by estimating channel distortions and 
calculating the inverse of the estimated channel coefficients. 
However, the inverse of the channel coefficients can result in 
severe noise enhancement under deep fading channels. 
In order to reduce the noise enhancement, several novel 
channel estimation schemes utilizing the weighted moving 
average were proposed in [3]. In this paper, we describe 
novel channel estimation schemes for T-DMB receivers and 
present further results on their performance under fading 
channels. 
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the 
system model of the T-DMB system is presented. Section III 
describes the considered channel estimation schemes and 
numerical results are shown in Section IV. Finally, 
conclusions are drawn in Section V. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
In this section, we describe a system model for T-DMB 
systems. At the transmitter, binary bits are input and mapped 
into modulation symbols. After pilot insertion, the modulated 
signal 
[ ]
X k  is input to an inverse fast Fourier transform 
(IFFT) block and transformed into time-domain signals. The 
cyclic prefix (CP) is inserted to prevent possible inter-
symbol interference (ISI) between adjacent OFDM systems 
where a copy of the last part of the OFDM symbol is 
transmitted. The transmitted signal passes through the fading 
channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). 
At the receiver, the CP is removed and the pilot based 
signal correction is performed after FFT [5]. There are two 
typical pilot patterns of the OFDM transmission systems [6]. 
For the block-type pilot pattern, the pilot signal is assigned to 
the specified OFDM symbols. Since the pilot signals are 
periodically sent in the time domain, the block-type pilot 
pattern is suitable to slow fading channels. For the comb-
type pilot pattern, on the other hand, the pilot signals are 
uniformly distributed in the frequency domain for each 
OFDM symbol. Hence, the comb-type pilot pattern is 
suitable to fast fading channels. However, since the pilot 
signals are carried on the limited number of subcarriers, the 
channel state information for the data subcarriers should be 
estimated by interpolating with neighboring pilot subcarriers. 
As a result, the channel estimation performance with the 
comb-type pilot pattern is affected by the interpolation 
methods [8]. In the T-DMB system, the pilot signals are 
inserted at the fixed position in every 76 OFDM symbols. 
Hence, the pilot pattern in the T-DMB has the propensity of 
the block-type.

CHANNEL ESTIMATION SCHEMES 
The channel estimation of the T-DMB system consists of 
two stages. First, the received pilot signals are extracted from 
the pilot subcarriers. Next, the channel coefficients are 
obtained by comparing the received pilot signals with the 
known pilot signals. The received pilot signals 
p[ ]
Y k  are 
extracted from the received signals [ ]
Y k  after FFT, and the 
reference channel coefficients for the equalizer are estimated 
in the frequency domain by comparing the extracted pilot 
signals 
p[ ]
Y k  and the known pilot signals 
Sp[ ]
k . 
Assuming the perfect synchronization, the received pilot 
signals 
p [ ]
Y k  can be written as

Also, we assume that the transmitted pilot signal

known to the receiver. Therefore, the frequency response of 
the channel on the k-th pilot subcarrier, ˆ[ ]

. The channel estimation scheme is 
based on the least square method [7]. 
Since the tap coefficients of the equalizer are obtained by 
calculating the inverse of the estimated channel coefficients, 
the severe noise enhancement is induced under deep fading 
channels. In order to reduce the noise enhancement, we 
adopt novel channel estimation schemes based on the M-
point weighted moving average [3].  
Let

the M-point weighted moving average at the k-th pilot 
subcarrier of the OFDM symbol. Then,

where M is odd number and

In this paper, six weighted moving average schemes of 
[3] are considered. The considered weighting values of the 
respective schemes are given in Table I. The quadratic, cubic, 
and Lagrange weighting values are derived from the 
quadratic, 4-point cubic, 4-point Lagrange interpolation 
filters, respectively [8]. Note that the variance of the 
equivalent noise term in (1) can be computed as

Hence, the variance of the noise decreases with the 
increasing value of M. However, channel coefficients ˆ[ ]
H k  
used in the weighted moving average can be severely varied 
due to the channel variation. This results in the distortion of 
the estimated channel response and thus, the performance 
degradation. Therefore, it is required to determine the 
average number of points by considering the trade-off 
between the accuracy of estimated channel coefficients and 
the noise reduction. Note that the considered moving average 
schemes are performed after the channel estimation.

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this paper, we present further results on the 
performance of the novel channel estimation schemes for T-
DMB systems under fading channels via computer 
simulation. The channel model used for the simulations is 
Brazil Channel A [9]. Note that the Brazil channel A 
founded by the laboratory test in Brazil, represents the 
outdoor channel and is widely used in simulations for 
terrestrial digital television systems. We assume the perfect 
synchronization and known pilot signals at the receiver. We 
compare performances of the weighted moving average and 
conventional schemes. The T-DMB system is modeled based 
on transmission mode I of the Eureka-147 DAB system 
without any error correction coding scheme. Since the

elementary symbol period T is 0.48828μs  (=1 2048ms ) for 
the sampling frequency of 2.048 MHz [1], the maximum 
delay of Brazil Channel A corresponds to about 12 
elementary symbols. Note that the number of subcarriers, 
subcarrier spacing, OFDM symbol duration, and CP duration 
are 1536, 1kHz, 2551 T

(≈1.246 ms), and 504 T

(≈246 μs), 
respectively. 
The performance measure considered in this paper is the 
symbol error rate (SER) after one-tap equalization with the 
inverse of estimated channel coefficients. The transmitted 
signals are mapped with π/4 differential quadrature phase 
shift keying (π/4-DQPSK) constellations. Fig. 1 shows the 
SER performance of the weighted moving average and 
conventional channel estimation schemes under Brazil 
Channel A with 10 Hz Doppler. As shown in Fig. 1, the 
weighted 
moving 
average 
schemes 
outperform 
the 
conventional scheme with approximately 2~3 dB under the 
fading channel. Note that the performances of MA, selective 
MA, linear weighted MA, and quadratic weighted MA 
schemes are similar. Compared to MA, selective MA, linear 
weighted MA, and quadratic weighted MA schemes, the 
performances of the cubic and Lagrange weight MA 
schemes are degraded due to the estimation error.

According to (1), the weighted moving average scheme 
requires M multiplications and (
M 1)
 additions. As shown 
in Table I, since the weight values of five schemes except for 
the selective MA scheme can be precalculated and stored for 
a given M, the complexity for weight values can be 
negligible. Also, for MA and selective MA schemes, since 
the weight values are one and zero, the multiplication is not 
required. Therefore, MA and selective MA schemes 
outperform the cubic and Lagrange weight MA schemes 
with the reduced complexity. Note that the comparison test 
for the estimated channel coefficients is additionally required 
for the selective MA scheme. 
Note that the noise enhancement can be decreased with 
increasing number of points used for averaging. However, 
the accuracy of the channel estimation can be degraded with 
the large number of points for averaging due to the channel 
variation.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we described novel channel estimation 
schemes based on the weighted moving average in order to 
improve the channel estimation performance in T-DMB 
receivers. The channel estimation schemes based on the 
weighted moving average outperform the conventional 
scheme with approximately 2-3 dB in SER performance after 
equalization under fading channels. Also, the channel 
estimation schemes with weighted moving average are 
expected to contribute to the performance improvement of 
the channel estimation in any OFDM systems.  
Also, we are studying to further improve the channel 
estimation performance and reduce the complexity of the 
channels estimation by developing new interpolation 
schemes and optimizing the size of the moving window. 
Unfortunately, the Brazil A channel is the multipath profile 
for the static environment. Hence, we will use the well-
known TU6 multipath channel [10] in order to consider a 
mobile environment in the urban area. Also, in this paper, the 
size of the moving window was not optimized for a mobile 
channel but was set to be values for static channels. Under a 
high speed mobile channel, since the channel is rapidly 
varied, the size of the moving window should be optimized.
