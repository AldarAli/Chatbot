Abstract—Plastic 
Optical 
Fibers 
(POFs) 
are 
especially 
advantageous due to their excellent flexibility, simple 
manufacturing and handling procedures, great numerical 
aperture, large diameter, and the fact that plastic is able to 
withstand smaller bend radii than glass. Sensors based on 
POFs and Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) are 
presented in the selective detection of different analytes. The 
developed POF-MIP sensors represent a simple approach to 
low-cost sensing. In this work we have recalled a chemical 
sensor for furfural (2-FAL) detection in power transformer 
insulating oil, with a Limit Of Detection (LOD) of about 4µM.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a very sensitive 
method for determining refractive index variations at the 
interface between a metal layer and a dielectric medium. 
Thus, it is a transduction technique particularly suitable for 
marker free sensors, in which the dielectric is a receptor 
layer with refractive index depending on its interaction with 
a particular substrate. In the scientific literature, several 
review papers describe plasmonic sensor platforms and their 
applications [1]-[6].  
Jorgenson et al. realized SPR sensors in optical fibers 
without prisms [7], in which the metal layer was directly 
deposited on the core of an optical fiber. The SPR sensors in 
optical fiber allow for remote sensing and for reduced 
dimension and price of the whole sensor system. At the 
beginning, the optical fibers employed were made of glass, 
but more recently plastic or special optical fibers have been 
used too [7]-[17]. The Plastic Optical Fibers (POFs) present 
exceptional flexibility, simple manipulation, large numerical 
aperture, big diameter. Also, they are able to withstand 
smaller bend radii than glass fibers. Therefore, POFs are 
particularly advantageous for the realization of low-cost SPR 
sensors [16]. SPR sensors based on optical fibers show a 
noticeably high sensitivity, due to the fact that they are able 
to detect even small variations of refractive index of the 
medium (dielectric) in contact with the metal layer [18]-[21]. 
When biological or artificial receptors are present at the 
metal-dielectric interface, they selectively capture the analyte 
present in the sample under test, and a local variation of the 
dielectric's refractive index in contact with the metal film is 
produced. 
Different structures have been proposed for SPR sensors 
based on optical fibers [5]. D-shaped POF platforms have 
been successfully developed by our research group for 
different analytes and different receptors such as antibodies, 
aptamers and Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIP) too 
[22]-[28].  
The flat part of the D-shaped platform is suitable for an 
easy deposition of the receptors, in particular MIPs, and 
makes it possible to perform the determination in a drop, 
instead of requiring complex flux devices. It has been shown 
that MIPs are easily produced over gold by in-situ 
polymerization, forming thin and firm receptor layers, which 
are suitable for SPR detection by the D-shaped POF 
platforms [24]-[28].  
The D-shaped POF platforms are obtained by a hand 
polishing procedure, which could lead to a somewhat 
irreproducible 
morphology 
of 
the 
D-shaped 
region 
(roughness and total depth). Previous investigations showed 
that this could strongly influence the performance of the 
platform [29][30]. 
MIPs are synthetic receptors with many favorable aspects 
with respect to bio-receptors, such as an easier and faster 
preparation, the possibility of application outside the 
laboratory, for example under environmental conditions, a 
longer durability [31][32].  
The advantage of the MIPs combined with SPR D-
shaped POF platform is that they can be directly formed on a 
flat gold surface by depositing a drop of prepolymeric 
mixture directly over gold film, spinning by a spin coater 
machine and in situ polymerization [24]-[28], without 
modifying the surface (functionalization and passivation), as 
needed for the bio-receptors [22][23]. Besides, their 
refractive index can in principle be modulated in order to be 
suitable for the SPR transduction.  
Taguchi et al. presented a different interesting approach 
for Bisphenol A (BPA) detection, exploiting molecularly 
imprinted nanoparticles combined with a slab optical 
waveguide [33]. This approach is similar to that used in the 
Kretschmann configuration but exploiting optical fibers 
combined with a slab waveguide. 
In this work, we reported as the combination of a D-
shaped POF and an MIP receptor is an effective way to 
obtain a highly selective and sensitive SPR optical chemical

sensor. Several examples of applications of this optical 
chemical sensor have been demonstrated, as for example the 
selective detection of trinitrotoluene (TNT), for security 
applications [24], of furfural (furan-2-carbaldehyde) and 
dibenzyl disulfide (DBDS) in power transformer insulating 
oil, for industrial applications [25][28], of L-nicotine [27] in 
clinical applications, and perfluorinated alkylated substances 
(PFAs) in environmental monitoring applications [26]. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 
2, we have presented an optical platform based on plastic 
optical fibers. In Section 3, we have reported a particular 
synthetical receptor: the Molecularly Imprinted Polymer. In 
Section 4, we have illustrated an example of a chemical-
optical sensor based on an SPR-POF platform combined 
with an MIP receptor. We have concluded the work in 
Section 5. 
  
II. 
SPR-POF PLATFORM 
The D-shaped POF platform was realized as described in 
[16], the size of the POF is 980 µm of core (1 mm in 
diameter). Summarily, our SPR platform is made by 
removing the cladding of POF (along half circumference), 
spin coating a buffer layer on the exposed core and finally 
sputtering a thin gold film [16]. Figure 1 shows the SPR-
POF sensor and the outline of the manufacturing steps. The 
final length of sensing region is about 10 mm. The 
photoresist layer is about 1,500 nm thick and the gold film is 
about 60 nm, presenting a good adhesion to the substrate too. 
The buffer layer is made of photoresist (Microposit 
S1813), with a refractive index greater than that of the POF's 
core (PMMA). This buffer layer improves the performances 
of the SPR sensor and the gold film adhesion on the 
platform. 
The selectivity is obtained by placing a specific receptor 
(for example MIP) for the considered analyte in tight contact 
with the gold surface (see Figure 1). 
  
Figure 1.  SPR sensor platform based on D-shaped POF. 
The experimental setup consists of a halogen lamp (HL–
2000–LL, Ocean Optics) illuminating the optical chemical 
sensor and a spectrum analyzer (USB2000+UV–VIS 
spectrometer, Ocean Optics) connected to a computer, as 
shown in Figure 2. The spectral emission of the lamp ranges 
from 360 nm to 1700 nm and the spectrometer is sensitive 
from 300 nm to 1050 nm. 
Figure 2.  Experimental setup. 
 
Usually, in the bio-chemical applications, a small amount 
of solution with analyte (about 50 µL) was dropped over the 
sensing area (MIP layer, the chemical receptor) and the 
spectrum recorded after about ten minutes incubation. The 
transmission curves along with data values were displayed 
online on the computer screen and saved with the help of 
advanced software provided by Ocean Optics. Each 
experimental value is the average of 5 subsequent 
measurements. The signal processing is obtained by Matlab 
and OriginPro 8.5 software.

MIP RECEPTORS 
For the characterized optical chemical sensors [24]-[28], 
based on SPR-POF-MIPs, the MIP receptor layer has been 
obtained by three simple steps (see Figure 3).

In particular, we have used these steps: 
1) About 50 µL of the prepolymeric mixture were 
dropped over the flat optical sensing region (D-shaped area) 
and spun for 1 min at about 700 rpm, by a spin coater 
machine; 
2) Thermal polymerization was then carried out for 16 h 
at 80 °C, by oven; 
3) The template was extracted by repeated washings with 
96% ethanol.  
Figure 3 shows the outline of the MIP receptor layer with 
a summary of these manufacturing steps (the porous solid 
obtained by polymerization of the aggregate substrate-
coordinating monomers after extraction of the template from 
the selective site). 
 
IV. 
AN EXAMPLE OF SPR-POF-MIP SENSOR 
As an example, we report on the results of the 
exploitation of an MIP receptor on a D-shaped POF for 
furfural detection in power transformer insulating oil. 
Furfural (2-FAL) has been considered among several furanic 
compounds possibly present in used transformer oils, since it 
is usually the most prominent component of paper 
decomposition in power transformer [28]. 
The gold planar surface over the D-shaped POF (SPR 
active surface) was washed with ethanol and then dried in a 
thermostatic oven at 60 °C prior to depositing the sensing 
layer, a specific MIP layer. The prepolymeric mixture for 
MIP was prepared according to the classical procedure 
reported 
in 
[28] 
with 
only 
slight 
modifications. 
Divinylbenzene (DVB), the cross-linker, was also the solvent 
in which the functional monomer (that is, methacrylic acid, 
MAA), and the template, furfural (2-FAL) are dissolved 
[25][28].  
Figure 4 shows the spectra of the SPR-POF-MIP sensor 
for 2-FAL detection, where at about 860 nm a red-shift is 
present for increasing concentration of analyte (2-FAL) from 
0 ppm to 0.193 ppm. 
 
Figure 4.  SPR spectra obtained for different concentrations of 2-FAL in 
oil. 
 
The shift of resonance wavelength indicates that the 
refractive index in contact with the gold surface is increased. 
The dependence of the minimum wavelength on the 2-FAL 
concentration is evident. 
Figure 5 shows the dose response curves for 2-FAL 
(ppm) in oil, in semi-log scale, and the Hill fitting to the 
experimental data, obtained by the red shift resonances 
shown in Figure 4.  
Figure 5 shows that the experimental data are well fitted 
by the Hill equation, and, from the Hill parameters, we 
obtained a sensitivity at low concentration of about 6·107 
(nm/M) and a Limit Of Detection of about 4 (µM) [25][34].

in oil, in semi-log scale, and Hill fitting of data. 
 
Standardization curves like those reported in Figure 5 are 
generally used for chemo and biosensors, and their physical 
meaning can be linked to the fact that the absorption occurs 
by combination at specific sites, when the quantity of 
receptor sites available for the combination with the substrate 
is restricted [24]-[28][34]. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We have reported on the ability of a low-cost SPR-POF 
sensor platform to be exploited in chemical applications 
based on MIP receptors.  
The SPR-POF-MIP sensor systems are easy to use, small 
size and low-cost. As a paradigm, we have recalled the 
results for furfural detection in power transformer insulating 
oil.
