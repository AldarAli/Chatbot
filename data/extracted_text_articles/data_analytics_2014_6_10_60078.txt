Abstract—This paper describes the application of a novel 
domain-independent decision support approach for product 
quality management. It is based on customer satisfaction 
research through deep analysis of consumer reviews posted on 
the Internet in natural language. Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
techniques, such as Text Mining and Data Mining, are used for 
realization of consumer reviews analysis. In paper, specific 
Internet resources (such as yelp.com, tripadvisor.com, 
tophotels.ru) are used for accumulating customer reviews as a 
data source is considered. This is performed in accordance 
with the quality standard ISO 10004 proposed decision 
support approach, which allows for both qualitative and 
quantitative customer satisfaction surveys to be carried out. 
The output of the quantitative survey are values of customer 
satisfaction by product and each product’s aspect. The output 
of the qualitative survey are significance values of products 
aspect  for customers and identified latent relations between 
satisfaction by product and satisfaction by products’ aspects. 
The proposed approach is performed as a prototype of a 
Decision Support System. To evaluate the efficacy of the 
proposed approach, an experiment on hotel’s customer 
satisfaction has been carried out. The obtained results prove 
the efficacy of the proposed decision support approach for 
quality management and the concept of using it instead of 
classical methods of qualitative and quantitative research of 
customer satisfaction.  
Keywords-quality management; decision support system; 
sentiment analysis. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In order to provide product quality, a company should 
make effective managerial decisions. In the modern world, 
the efficacy of managerial decision-making process depends 
on the information available to the person that makes 
decisions and the depth of information analysis. Therefore, a 
company should develop processes of automated collection 
of information and its further processing and analysis. 
Decision-making should be based on the knowledge and 
principles obtained during the analysis of the collected data. 
Quality assurance is currently attained through a process 
approach based on the model of a quality management 
system [1]. It describes the interaction of the company and 
the customer during the process of product production and 
consumption. To correct the parameters of a product’s 
quality in order to improve it for the customer, the model has 
feedback. For companies, feedback during the process of 
quality management is the information about the level of 
customer satisfaction, which is expressed in the form of 
customer reviews about a product’s quality. That is why 
customer satisfaction is key information for quality 
management that influences decision-making. 
To collect data and evaluate customer satisfaction, 
International Quality Standards ISO 10004 (International 
Organization for Standardization) recommends using the 
following classical methods: face to face interviews, 
telephone interviews, discussion groups, mail surveys (postal 
questionnaires), on-line research and surveys (questionnaire 
surveys) [2]. However, these methods of collection and 
analysis of customer opinions have a number of significant 
drawbacks. 
A general drawback of these methods is a large amount 
of manual work: preparing questions, creating a respondent 
database, mailing questionnaires and collecting results, 
conducting a personal interview, and preparing a report.  All 
of these procedures make a research expensive. These 
methods cannot monitor customer satisfaction continuously. 
For this reason, monitoring is limited by a one time period. 
There is no possibility for monitoring trends of customer 
satisfaction. It also has a negative influence on lengthiness of 
managerial decision making.  
Another problem regards various scales for measuring 
customer satisfaction and their subjectivity perception. Value 
of customer satisfaction is estimated by abstract satisfaction 
indices that are difficult to understand, hard to compare and 
interpret. 
Furthermore, 
methods 
for 
data 
analysis 
recommended by ISO 10004 [2] allow detection of only 
linear dependencies and relations in data.

The aim of this paper is the development of a decision 
support approach for quality management based on the 
research of customer satisfaction with use of AI 
technologies. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in 
Section 2, we focused on overview of recent solutions and 
frameworks for analysis of user generated content and their 
drawbacks. In Section 3, we described architecture and 
workflow of proposed decision support system. In Section 4, 
we described using AI techniques for qualitative and 
quantitative customer satisfaction surveys. In Section 5, we 
provide experiment with researching customer satisfaction of 
two hotels and whole resort. The obtained results could be 
used for decision making.

RELATED WORK 
Applying Text Mining tools for analyzing customers’ 
reviews posted on the Internet is not novel. There are many 
studies concerning models and methods for data collection, 
sentiment analysis and information extraction. Recent studies 
show acceptable accuracy of methods for sentiment 
classification. Gräbner et al. [3] proposed a system that 
performs the sentiment classification of customer reviews on 
hotels. Lexicon-based method [27] allowed the correct 
classification of reviews with a probability of about 90%. 
These achievements make sentiment analysis applicable for 
an application on quality management. 
Jo and Oh [4] and Lu et al. [5] considered the problems 
of 
automatically 
discovering 
products’ 
aspects 
and 
sentiments estimation for these aspects which are evaluated 
in reviews. For solving these problems, they suggested 
methods based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation [28] and its 
modifications. 
A lot of social monitoring systems and frameworks have 
been developed for automatic analysis of reviews and topics. 
Liu et al. [6] presented framework called Opinion Observer 
for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of 
competing products. This prototype system is able to 
visualize the strengths and weaknesses of each product in 
terms of various product features. Kasper and Vela [7] 
presented a web based opinion mining system for hotel 
reviews and user comments that supports the hotel 
management called BESAHOT. The system is capable of 
detecting and retrieving reviews on the web, classifying and 
analyzing them, as well as generating comprehensive 
overviews of these comments. Blair-Goldensohn et al. [8] 
proposed a system that summarizes the sentiment of reviews 
for a local service, such as a restaurant or hotel. In particular, 
they focus on aspect-based summarization models. Ajmera et 
al. 
[9] 
developed 
a 
Social 
Customer 
Relationship 
Management (SCRM) system that mines conversations on 
social platforms to identify and prioritize those posts and 
messages that are relevant to enterprises. Bank [13] proposed 
interactive Social Media monitoring system to extract related 
information from user generated content. One of the 
important contribution of this work was the proposition of 
new quality indeces.  
In some related work, authors pay attention to relations 
between overall ratings of products, and ratings of products’ 
aspects evaluated in the review. Wang et al. [10] formulated 
a novel text mining problem called Latent Rating Analysis 
(LARA). LARA aims at analyzing opinions expressed in 
each review at the level of topical aspects to discover each 
individual reviewer's latent rating on each aspect as well as 
the relative importance weighted on different aspects when 
forming the overall judgment. De Albornoz et al. [11] aimed 
to predict the overall rating of a product review based on the 
user opinion about the different product features that are 
evaluated in the review. For experiments, authors used 
reviews on hotels. 
Wachsmuth et al. [12] formulated and validated an 
important hypothesis that the global sentiment score of a 
hotel review correlates with the ratio of positive and negative 
opinions in the review's text and that the global sentiment 
score of a hotel review correlates with the polarity of 
opinions on certain product features in the review's text. 
The main drawback of these considered systems is that 
they can provide entirely only a quantitative survey of 
customer reviews, i.e., provide measurement of the degree of 
customer satisfaction by a product and its aspects. 
Qualitative survey were usually only conducting the 
extraction of a product’s aspects. Estimation of the 
significance of each product’s aspects for the customer is 
missed.  The information about products’ aspects that 
influence satisfaction and their relative importance for the 
customer is missing, as well as an insight into customer 
expectations and perceptions. 
The most related work to this problem is [24]. It is 
dedicated to the topic of aspect ranking, which aims to 
automatically identify important aspects of product from 
online 
consumer 
reviews. 
Most 
proposals 
used 
a 
probabilistic model with a large number of parameters that 
lead to low robustness of the model. Total weighting values 
of aspects are calculated as the average of the weighting 
values by each review. Finally, significance values of aspects 
are estimated independently of an opinion's sentiment, e.g., 
in real life, we can discuss in review about bad “signal 
connection”, but we usually omit comments in case of good 
“signal connection”, because it must be in phone. In this 
manner, it is possible to use the Kano’s model of customer 
satisfaction [25], which classifies customer preferences into 
four categories. 
In this paper, for qualitative survey is used a novel 
approach based on transformation results of Sentiment 
Analysis into binary data. After that, binary data is processed 
with a Data Mining tool – Decision Tree (see Section IV). 
Qualitative survey aims to identify how the sentiment of 
reviews depends on the sentiment of different products’ 
aspects. In other words, how overall customer satisfaction by 
product depends on the customer satisfaction by a product’s 
aspects. Decision Tree performs this aim and identifies latent 
relations between the sentiment of reviews and sentiment of 
a product’s aspects. We estimate the significance of aspects 
from the constructed Decision Tree. Output of qualitative 
survey are significance values of positive and negative 
mentions about a product’s aspects for customers and 
identified latent relations extracted by Decision Tree. The 
availability of both quantitative and qualitative surveys

allows realizing Decision Support System for Quality 
Management in accordance with quality standard ISO 10004. 
III. 
THE PROPOSED DECISION SUPPORT APPROACH 
The suggested approach to decision making in product 
quality management accomplished through unification of 
methods for collecting and processing text data into 
Intelligent 
Decision 
Support 
System 
(IDSS). 
The 
architecture (subsystems and contained modules) of the 
obtained IDSS is presented in Figure 1. The subsystem of 
monitoring and data collection fills the warehouse with 
customer reviews and other relevant information. It also 
supports the actuality of data via automated monitoring of 
Internet resources and carries out data cleansing. The data 
storage subsystem provides safe-keeping and integrity of 
collected reviews and results of data processing. In the 
subsystem of data analysis are realized methods of sentiment 
analysis, aspect extraction, aspect sentiment analysis, and 
decision tree. In subsystem of user interaction is visualized 
results of analysis. 
 
Figure 1.  The architecture of Intelligent Decision Support System for 
product quality management. 
 
Figure 2.  Working algorithm of Intelligent Decision Support System 
In Figure 2, the algorithm of the IDSS is presented. It 
consists of four stages. The first stage includes collection of 
reviews from Internet resources, data cleansing and loading 
reviews into the database. The second stage performs 
processing collected reviews. It includes preprocessing 
procedures, such as preparing training samples of reviews, 
text lemmatization, and encoding text of reviews in vector 
form. Processing procedures include extraction of a 
product’s aspects, training of the classifier and sentiment 
analysis.  
The third stage is the quantitative survey. The 
quantitative survey is based on sentiment analysis of reviews 
entirely, and aspect sentiment analysis of sentences with 
mentions of a product’s aspects. Sentiment classification is 
attained through binary scale – positive and negative 
sentiments. As a measure of the customer satisfaction is used 
a ratio of positive reviews (or positive sentences with 
mentions of a product’s aspect) to the sum of positive and 
negative reviews (or sum of positive and negative sentences 
with mentions of a product’s aspect). The output of the 
quantitative survey is values of customer satisfaction by a 
product and each product’s aspect.  
The fourth stage is the qualitative survey of customer 
satisfaction. It is based on transformation results of sentiment 
analysis into binary data and following by constructing of 
decision tree on it. The qualitative survey aims to identify 
how sentiment of review depends on the sentiment of 
different aspects of a product. Decision tree performs this 
aim and identifies latent relations between sentiment of a 
review and sentiment of a product’s aspects. The output of 
the qualitative analysis is significance values of a product’s 
aspects for customers and identifying latent relations 
extracted by decision tree. Managerial decision development 
and making is carried out on the basis of the performed 
quantitative and qualitative surveys. 
IV. 
APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES  
In this Section are described implemented AI techniques 
for customer satisfaction surveys and support decision 
making. 
A. Data collection 
Nowadays there are a large number of Internet resources 
where users can leave their opinions about products and 
services. The most popular examples of review sites are 
tophotels.ru (635 thousand reviews), yelp.com (53 million 
reviews), tripadvisor.com (130 million reviews). Similar 
resources continue to gain popularity. As opposed to social 
networking services, the advantage of review sites lies in 
their purpose - accumulation of customer reviews. One more 
advantage is that many of such resources have moderators of 
reviews and confirmation of author's objectivity, e.g., 
registration procedure. 
There are two main types of collecting data from the 
Internet resources of customer reviews: 1) by using API 
(Application Programming Interface), and 2) by web data 
extraction. API is a set of ready-to-use tools - classes, 
procedures, and functions - provided by the application 
(Internet resource) for using in an external software product. 
114

DATA ANALYTICS 2014 : The Third International Conference on Data Analytics

Unfortunately, only a few resources that accumulate reviews 
have API.  
In this paper is used the second method for data 
collection – web data extraction. It is a process of automated 
content collection from HTML-pages of any Internet 
resource using special programs or script. Related work is 
presented in [14][15]. Scheme of reviews collection is 
presented in Figure 3. Web pages of review sources use 
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that sets the structure 
typical for a review. Such structure includes separate blocks 
with the name of a product or company with a review, and 
other blocks with additional information. Therefore, all 
reviews are clearly identified in relation to the review object. 
It significantly simplifies the process of data collection in 
contrast to collecting messages from social networking 
services. 
Input: review site 
1. Gathering links on pages with reviews or generating links by 
using a template.  
2. Setting boundaries for a content by using a HTML structure.  
3. Collection data on the set of links.  
4. Cleaning data and removing duplicates.  
5. Loading data into the database. 
Output: set of consumer reviews D 
Figure 3.  Algorithm of reviews collection 
B. Sentiment Analysis 
After data collection, it is possible to process review data 
with Text Mining tools. In this paper automatic sentiment 
analysis of reviews is used to evaluate product satisfaction. 
Sentiment stands for the emotional evaluation of author's 
opinion about a product that is referred to in the reviews. 
There are three main approaches to sentiment analysis: 1) 
linguistic, 2) statistical, and 3) combined. The linguistic 
approach is based on using rules and vocabularies of 
emotionality words [16][17]. This approach is quite time-
consuming due to the need of compiling vocabularies, 
patterns, and making rules for identifying sentiments. 
However, the main drawback of this approach is the 
impossibility to get a quantitative evaluation of the 
sentiment. The statistical approach is based on the methods 
of supervised and non-supervised machine learning (ML) 
[18][19]. The combined approach presupposes a combined 
use of the first two approaches.  
 In present work the methods of supervised machine 
learning is used - a Bayesian classifier and Support Vector 
Machines. Their realization in IDSS is based on techniques   
described by Pang and Lee [18][19]. More detailed 
information about implemented methods of sentiment 
analysis used in this paper can be found in [20][21]. In 
Figure 4 algorithms of learning and classification for naive 
Bayes classifier based on Multinomial model are presented. 
An advantage of these ML methods that they are quite easy 
in software implementation, and do not require making 
linguistic analyzers or sentiment vocabularies. They are able 
to 
evaluate 
sentiment 
quantitatively. 
For 
sentiment 
classification is used binary scale - positive and negative 
tonality. We use vector representation of review texts with 
help of the bag-of-words model. As attributes, we consider 
bit vectors - presence or absence of the word in the review 
text, and frequency vectors – a number of times that a given 
word appears in the text of the review. Lemmatization is also 
used.

C. Aspect Sentiment Analysis 
Sentiment Analysis of reviews allows the evaluation of 
overall customer product satisfaction. However, it does not 
clearly show what customers like about a product and what 
they don’t like. To answer this question, it is necessary to 
perform an aspect sentiment analysis. An aspect means 
characteristics, attributes, and properties that characterize the 
products, e.g., a “phone battery” or “delivery period”. 
However, one sentiment object can have a great number of 
aspects. Furthermore, aspects in the text can be expressed by 
words-synonyms, e.g., “battery” and “accumulator”. In this 
case, it makes sense to combine aspects into aspect groups. 
An Aspect Sentiment Analysis of the review is a more 
difficult task and consists of two stages – identifying aspects 
and determining the sentiment of the comment on them. To 
complete the task of the Aspect Sentiment Analysis, we 
developed a simple and effective algorithm (see Figure 6). 
Aspects extraction based on the frequency of nouns and noun 
phrases mentioned in reviews based [22]. 
A frequency vocabulary [23] (created on text corpus) that 
helps to compare the obtained frequencies from reviews with 
frequencies from corpus is used to identify aspects. The 
nouns with maximum frequency deviations are claimants to 
be included into aspect groups. Clustering of the nouns into 
aspect groups was carried out manual. It should be noted, 
115

that if a sentence includes nouns from several aspect groups, 
then it would refer to opinion about each aspect group. 
The results of sentiment Analysis and Aspect Sentiment 
Analysis 
can 
be 
presented 
in 
the 
form

variables
, 
where Obj – a object or a product, Revi – text of the i review, 
Datai – date of i review publication, Senti – sentiment of i 
review, Negij – negative sentences with mention about the j 
aspect group in the i review, Posij – positive sentences with 
mention about the j aspect group in the i review, i – number  
of review, j – number of aspect group, m – amount  of aspect 
groups . 
Aspect extraction 
Input: set of reviews D 
1. Extract all nouns S from the set of reviews D. 
Count the frequency of words 
 in the 
whole set of reviews D, where N – number of appearances of 
all words, Nt – number of appearances of the t noun. 
2. Count the difference 
 between the counted 
frequencies fi and vocabulary frequencies ftV. 
3. Sort the set of nouns S in descending order  ∆t. 
4. Divide the set of nouns S from 
 into aspect groups. 
Output: set of aspect groups and aspect words 
 
Aspect sentiment classification 
Input: sentiment classifier, set of aspect groups and aspect 
words 
1. Divide a set of reviews into set of sentences. 
2. Perform sentiment classification for each sentence. 
3. Check each sentence for the condition: if a sentence has a 
sentiment value (negative or positive) greater than a threshold 
h and contains at least one noun from any aspect group, then 
this sentence is labeled as an opinion (negative or positive) 
about the given product’s aspect. 
Output: positive and negative sentences with mentions about 
product’s aspects

D. Data Mining 
The present paragraph suggests an algorithm of the 
following processing of results of sentiment analysis. The 
aim of the developed algorithm is to discover latent 
knowledge that can be used for decision support in product 
quality management. To realize this algorithm we use the 
Data Mining tool – Decision Tree, since this tool is easy to 
understand and interpret results. It also can explain relations 
between overall sentiment of review and sentiment of each 
aspects by means of Boolean logic. 
The developed algorithm of knowledge discovery in 
results of sentiment analysis includes procedures presented 
in Figure 6. The described algorithm allows understanding of 
which sentiment sentences about a product’s aspects  
influence the overall sentiment of review or, in other words, 
what product aspects influence customer satisfaction and in 
what way. The constructed Decision Tree model allows the 
consideration of the influence of not only separate sentiment 
sentences on aspects, but also their mutual presence (or 
absence) in the text on overall satisfaction. The Decision 
Tree model also allows the detection of the most significant 
product's aspects that are essential for the customer. 
Input: positive and negative sentences with mentions about 
product’s aspects

6. Estimation significances of aspect groups and interpretation 
of extracted rules 
Output: significance values of product’s aspects, latent 
relations between satisfaction by product and satisfaction by 
aspects 
Figure 6.  Algorithm of knowledge discovery 
In Figure 7 an example of Decision Tree model is 
presented. Nodes of the Decision Tree are the aspect 
variables, i.e., presence or absence in the review tonality 
sentences (positive or negative) with mention about some 
aspect from aspect group. Edges of the tree are the values of 
aspect variables, i.e. 1 is presence, 0 is absence. Leaves 
present overall sentiment of review, i.e., each branch leads to 
either a positive review or a negative review that meets 
customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The Decision Tree 
model can be expressed both in the form of Boolean 
functions (see Eq. 1) in a disjunctive normal form, and in 
natural language as a rules. Each rule is characterized by 
measures of reliability and support. The reliability shows 
what percentage of reviews containing conditions of some 
rule, has the same sentiment corresponding to this rule. The 
support shows percentage of reviews that contain conditions 
of some rule regarding the entire number of reviews.

E. Measures for customer satisfaction 
To measure customer satisfaction by products (or 
product’s aspect group) we use a ratio of amount positive 
reviews (or positive sentences containing mentions about a 
product’s aspect group) to all reviews (or all sentences 
containing mentions about product’s aspect). The score of 
customer satisfaction CS by product is calculated by the 
formula: 



where Zpos  – the number of positive reviews, Zneg  – the 
number of negative reviews. 
The score of customer satisfaction csj by j product’s 
aspect group is calculated by the formula: 



where 
 – number of positive sentences containing 
mention about the j product’s aspect group, 
 – number of 
negative comments containing mention about the j product’s 
aspect group. 
Significance of aspects group shows how much the 
sentiment of a review depends on the aspect group in 
positive and negative sentences. Let the number of aspect 
groups is g/2, then the number of independent variables g 
(positive and negative statements for each group of aspect). 
According to the methodology described in [26] the formula 
for calculating the significance of variable m is: 



where kl  – number of nodes that were split by attribute l, El,j 
– entropy of the parent node, split by attribute l, El,j,i – subsite 
node for j, which was split by attribute l, Ql,j, Ql,j,i – number 
of examples in the corresponding nodes, ql,j – number of 
child nodes for j parent node. 
V. 
EXPERIMENT 
Efficacy evaluation of the developed IDSS was 
performed on the data obtained from 635 824 reviews about 
hotels in the Russian language. The reviews have been 
collected from the popular Internet resource tophotels.ru for 
the period of 2003-2013. The initial structure of the collected 
data consisted of the following fields: hotel name; country 
name; resort name; visit date; review's text; author's ratings 
of placement, food, and service. The data was preprocessed 
and loaded into the database SQL Server 2012. 
Classifying sentiment used a binary scale (negative and 
positive) on the hypothesis that the absence of negative is 
positive for the product. A training set of positive and 
negative reviews was formed using the collected data on an 
author’s ratings of placement, food, and service. The review 
site tophotels.ru uses a five-point grading scale. A review 
can have a maximum total rating of 15 points, and minimum 
total rating of 3 points. The training set included 15790 
negative reviews that have 3 and 4 total points, and 15790 
positive reviews that have 15 total points. We did not use the 
author's ratings for further data processing. Classification of 
another 604 244 reviews was carried out using a trained 
classifier.

For the purpose of training an effective sentiment 
classifier, the accuracy of classification was evaluated for 
machine learning methods and some peculiarities of their 
realization (see Table 1). The measure accuracy as a ratio of 
the number of correctly classified reviews to total number of 
reviews was used to estimate classification accuracy. 
Accuracy estimation was performed on two sets of data. The 
first set (Test No.1) represented a training set of strong 
positive (15 790) and strong negative reviews (15 790). 
Classifiers were tested by using cross validation by dividing 
the first set into 10 parts. The second set (Test No. 2) 
included random reviews from initial set of reviews (635 
824) with different points (3-15 points) and was labeled 
manual (497 positive and 126 negative). It was used only for 
accuracy control of the classifier that had been trained on the 
first data set.

To estimate influence of negative particles “not” and 
“no”, the tagging technique was used; for example, the 
phrase “not good” was marked as “not_good”, and was 
regarded by the classifier as one word. This technique 
allowed the increasing of sentiment classification accuracy. 
Accuracy values are presented in Table 1. The most efficient 
ML method was naive Bayes classifier with negation 
techniques (#7). In Figure 8 are presented ROC-curves 
classifiers #4 and #7.  The classifier #7 was trained on the 
training set and was used for further sentiment analysis. 
Using the aspect extraction algorithm (Section III), we 
extracted the nouns that were divided into seven basic aspect 
groups (see Figure 9): "beach/swimming pool", "food", 
"entertainment", "place", "room", "service", "transport". The 
following step was extracting and sentiment classification 
sentences with words from aspect groups using classifier #7.  
However, not all sentences with aspects had a clearly 
expressed sentiment; therefore, the sentences with poorly 
expressed sentiment using threshold h were filtered out. 
 
Figure 9.  Aspect groups of object “hotel” 
In present work we give an example of qualitative and 
quantitative surveys for two 5-star hotels “A” (1692 reviews) 
and “B” (1300 reviews) located on the resort Sharm el-
Sheikh (63 472 reviews) in Egypt. Firstly, we will make a 
quantitative survey, measure customer satisfaction, compare 
it with average satisfaction in the whole resort, detect 
negative trends by each hotel's aspect group, and identify 
problems in the quality of hotels. 
The dynamics of customer satisfaction is presented in 
Figure 10. Concerning the hotel “A”, there is a positive 
upward satisfaction trend from 2009, and it fixes on the 
average-resort level in 2013. Concerning the hotel “B”, in 
2012 there was a sharp satisfaction decline and the same 
sharp increase in 2013. For the hotel “B”, satisfaction 
decrease started in June 2012, and stopped in October 2012. 
Then, customer satisfaction grew to the level that was higher 
than the average resort level being ahead of its competitor – 
hotel “A”. 
To find reasons of hotel “B” satisfaction decrease, we 
will examine the diagrams in Figure 11. We can see that in 
2012, the hotel “B” on average was second to the hotel “A” 
in such aspects as “room” (∆12%), “place” (∆8%), “service” 
(∆5%), “beach/swimming pool” (∆3%) and “entertainment” 
(∆3%). Besides, in 2012, the Hotel “B” had more registered 
cases of intoxication, as well as cases of theft in August 
2012. We should also note that one of the reasons of 
customer dissatisfaction with the hotel “B” was the initiated 
repair of hotel rooms and buildings which, however, paid off 
in 2013. Customer satisfaction with the hotel “A” aspects 
conforms with the average resort level. 
In 2013, customer satisfaction with the hotel “B” 
exceeded the average level in all aspects (see Figure 12). 
Customer satisfaction with the hotel “A” dropped lower than 
average values in such aspects as “service” (∆3%), “food” 
(∆3%), “beach/swimming pool” (∆3%) and “transport” 
(∆4%). For hotel “A” manager arise questions like which 
aspects are the most significant for the customer and that 
should be improved in the first place,  is it possible to 
“substitute” the dissatisfaction with the service, e.g., by tasty 
food or employ new entertainer?

Decision Trees were constructed using algorithm C4.5. 
At the first step was constructed a tree for the all hotels of 
resort. Extracted rules are represented in Table 3. At the 
second step trees were constructed for hotel “A” and hotel 
“B”. Significance values of a product’s aspect groups are 
represented in Table 2. In Figure 13, there are the decision 
trees created for hotel “A” and hotel “B”. Due to the large 
size of the produced decision tree of the whole resort we 
omitted it, but in Table 3 its rules are presented that have 
reliability >80% and support >5% (5 rules from 27).

By analyzing significance values (see Table 2), we can 
say that the main factors of consumer dissatisfaction are a 
low service level (34,8%), problems with food (16%), and 
complaints about the hotel rooms (4%). The most critical 
aspect group for the hotel “B” is “room” (57,3%). In absence 
of negative opinions on the aspect group “room”, the review 
would be positive with a reliability of 95,5% (see Table 3, 
rule #10 ). That is why the repair that was performed 
facilitated to a significant increase of consumer satisfaction.  
The most critical aspect group for the Hotel “A” is “service” 
that corresponds with the resort in a whole.

Using significance values, we can relate each aspect 
group with Kano’s model categories [25]. Aspect group 
“service” has high significance on customer satisfaction in a 
“negative” case, but significance is near zero in a “positive” 
case (34,8% vs. 0,7%). It relates to “Must-be quality” of 
Kano’s categories. That’s why positive sentences with 
mentions about such aspect groups as “service” do not have 
an influence on sentiment of review, i.e., on overall 
satisfaction with hotel. That means the consumer a priori 
awaits a high-level service as a matter of course. For such 
aspect groups as “food” and “room” significance values are 
comparable (30,3% vs. 16% for “food” and 4% vs. 2,1% for 
“room”), that relates to “One-dimensional quality” of Kano’s 
categories. 
Aspect 
groups 
“beach/swimming 
pool”, 
“entertainment” and “territory” relates to “Attractive quality” 
because they have a significance on customer satisfaction in 
“positive” case only. 
 
Figure 13.  Decision trees for hotels 
In some cases, positive mentions about “food” and 
“entertainment” simultaneously in a review could substitute 
negative mentions about “services” and provide a positive 
review. That’s why the hotel's aspects which are contributing 
to customer satisfaction and important for both the resort and 
for the hotels are good food (30,3%) and amusing 
entertainment activities (8,5%). Customer satisfaction with 
these aspect groups can overlap dissatisfaction with 
“service” or “rooms” and make the customer overall satisfied 
(see Table 3, rules #5, #7, #11).

a. Support. b. Reliability  
The performed qualitative survey allowed the detection 
of the main ways to increase customer satisfaction for hotel 
“A”. The problem aspect groups identified through 
quantitative survey correspond to the most significant 
aspects detected during the qualitative research. Hotel “A” 
manager should firstly increase service quality, and then 
increase the quality of “food” and “beach/swimming pool” 
maintenance. “Transport” problems – concerning flights, 
early check-in, and baggage storage – are not significant for 
customers and can be solved in the frames of service 
improvement. The process of service quality increase can 
take much time; that is why organizing entertainment and 
animated programs together with enhancement of restaurant 
service could be immediate measures for increasing 
customer satisfaction. Specification of managerial decisions 
can be performed on the basis of the information on existing 
problems contained in negative reviews. The extracted 
sentences on aspects can be directed to the appropriate hotel 
services. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Poor quality of products and services contributes to a 
decrease of customer satisfaction. On the other hand, under 
the conditions of stiff competition, there are no barriers for

the consumer to change the supplier of goods and services. 
All these things can cause loss of clients and a decrease of a 
company’s efficiency indexes. Therefore, maintaining high-
quality standards should be provided by effective managerial 
decisions and based on opinion mining as a feedback. 
The suggested conception of decision support based on 
the developed approach of text data processing and analysis 
allows performing quantitative and qualitative surveys of 
customer satisfaction using computer-aided procedures, and 
making effective managerial decisions on product quality 
management. The present conception allows effective 
reduction of labor intensity of customer satisfaction research 
that makes it available for use by a wide range of companies. 
A prototype of IDSS was developed on the basis of the 
suggested conception. The performed experiment has proved 
its efficacy for solving real problems of quality management  
and consistency of the results obtained. Future research on 
the given topic can be devoted to automatic annotating of 
text data, representing text amount of review in the form of a 
summary, and extracting useful and unique information.
