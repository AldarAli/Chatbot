INTRODUCTION
In the era of digital transformation, the field of education
has witnessed a significant shift in the way learning takes
place. With the advent of technology, traditional teaching
methodologies are being reevaluated and new teaching and
learning approaches are being developed [1][2]. Among these,
design thinking has emerged as a popular problem-solving
methodology that is being adopted in various domains,
including education [3]. In the context of education, design
thinking offers a unique approach to developing innovative
solutions to the challenges faced by educators in the digital age
[4].
The use of design thinking in education is not new, and
there is a growing body of research that highlights the benefits
of applying design thinking to various educational contexts
[5][6]. However, despite its potential, the use of design
thinking in teacher professional development is still a relatively
unexplored area [4][7][8]. Teacher professional development
plays a crucial role in improving the quality of education and
ensuring that teachers are equipped with the necessary skills
and knowledge to meet the evolving needs of their students
[9][10][11][12]. Therefore, it is essential to explore the
potential of design thinking in developing a smart learning
environment
that
can
facilitate
teacher
professional
development in the digital age.
The
traditional
approach
to
teacher
professional
development typically involves workshops, seminars, and
conferences, which are often a “one-size-fits-all” approach and
lack personalization [13]. Moreover, they are often time-bound
and cannot be accessed at the teacher’s convenience. In
contrast,
a
smart
learning
environment
can
provide
personalized and flexible learning opportunities that can be
accessed
anytime
and
anywhere.
It
can
also
promote
collaboration and community building among teachers, which
can help to foster a culture of continuous learning and
improvement [14].
The aim of this research is to explore the potential of design
thinking in developing a smart learning environment for
teacher professional development in the digital age. The study
proposes a framework for a smart learning environment that is
based
on
the
principles
of
personalization,
flexibility,
collaboration, and innovation. It also discusses the benefits of a
smart
learning
environment
for
teacher
professional
development and highlights its potential to promote innovation
and experimentation in the classroom. The given below
research question guided the researchers to carry out this study.
RQ: How to promote teacher professional development in
smart learning environments using design thinking principles?
Overall, this research contributes to the growing body of
literature on design thinking in education and highlights the
potential of a smart learning environment to support teacher
professional development in the digital age. The conducted
study provides insights into the application of design thinking
principles in developing a smart learning environment and
highlights the benefits of such an environment for teachers and
their students.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In
Section II, the theoretical framework for smart learning
environments is presented, which includes an overview of
design thinking models and smart learning environment
frameworks. Section III describes the methodology used to
develop the proposed conceptual framework for a smart
learning environment for teacher professional development.
This includes a description of the research design, data
collection methods, and analysis techniques used. Finally, in
Section IV, the proposed conceptual framework for a smart
learning environment for teacher professional development is
presented, which integrates the principles of design thinking,
personalization, flexibility, collaboration, and innovation. The
section also includes a discussion of the potential benefits of
the framework for teacher professional development in the
digital age.

II.
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
A. Design Thinking
Design thinking is a human-centered problem-solving
methodology that emphasizes empathy, ideation, prototyping,
and testing. In the context of education, design thinking offers
a unique approach to developing innovative solutions to the
real-life challenges faced by educators in the digital age.
According to [15], design thinking provides a framework for
educators to
develop
personalized
and
flexible learning
opportunities that are tailored to the needs of their students
[16].
The use of design thinking In education is not new, and
there is a growing body of research that highlights the benefits
of applying design thinking to various educational contexts.
For example, in a study by [17] the authors explored the use of
design
thinking
in
a
teacher
professional
development
program. The study found that design thinking helped to
promote innovation and experimentation among teachers,
leading to improvements in their teaching practices and the
quality of education. On the other hand, design thinking
models are essential in education because they offer a
structured, user-centered approach to problem-solving that can
lead to more engaging and effective learning experiences for
students, promote innovation and experimentation among
educators,
and
help
develop
intuitive
and
user-friendly
educational technology products. Prominent design thinking
models include the 4D model, 3I model, and the widely-used
d.school model. These models provide a structured and human-
centered approach to problem-solving, generating innovative
solutions that are tailored to the needs and experiences of users.
In the context of a smart learning environment, design
thinking can provide a framework for developing personalized
and flexible learning opportunities that can be accessed
anytime and anywhere. A smart learning environment can
incorporate
adaptive
learning
technologies
and
learning
analytics to provide personalized feedback and support for
teachers. According to [18], a smart learning environment can
facilitate collaboration among teachers, enabling them to share
best practices and work together on common challenges.
Moreover, the use of a smart learning environment for teacher
professional development can help to promote a culture of
continuous learning and provide opportunities for teachers to
experiment
with
new
teaching
methodologies
and
technologies, resultantly promoting innovation and creativity in
the classroom.
Several studies have explored the use of design thinking in
teacher professional development. For example, [19][20]
applied design thinking principles to the development of a
teacher professional development program in Malaysia. The
program was designed to promote creativity and innovation in
the classroom, and it included elements of collaboration,
prototyping, and feedback. The authors found that the program
was effective in promoting creativity and innovation among
participating teachers. According to [21], a smart learning
environment can help to promote self-directed learning and
enable teachers to take ownership of their professional
development. Similarly, [22] explored the use of design
thinking and developed a design thinking curriculum that
included hands-on activities, collaboration, and feedback. The
authors found that the curriculum was effective in improving
teacher’' problem-solving skills and promoting innovation in
the classroom.
Other studies have explored the use of smart learning
environments
in
teacher
professional
development.
For
example, [23][24][25] developed a smart learning environment
that included elements of personalization, flexibility, and
collaboration. The environment was designed to support the
professional development of mathematics teachers in China.
The authors found that the smart learning environment was
effective in promoting collaboration and improving teachers'
problem-solving skills.
In responding to identifying various elements in SLEs,
various SLE frameworks are introduced in the wide body of
literature to structure for the development and implementation
of effective and engaging learning experiences based on the
principles of personalization, flexibility, collaboration, and
innovation. For instance, the Smart Learning Ecosystem (SLE)
framework, developed by researchers at the University of
Illinois, incorporates elements of personalization, adaptability,
and collaboration, and utilizes learning analytics to provide
feedback and support for teachers. The Personal Learning
Environment (PLE) framework emphasizes learner autonomy
and control over their learning experiences, using a variety of
tools and resources. The Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS)
framework incorporates artificial intelligence and machine
learning algorithms to provide personalized instruction and
feedback to learners, with learning analytics for monitoring
progress and teacher support. The Community of Inquiry
(COI)
framework
focuses
on
collaborative
learning,
emphasizing social presence, cognitive presence, and teaching
presence. These frameworks provide a useful structure for
meeting the diverse needs of learners in the digital age.
Thus, from the above literature, we can construe that the
use of design thinking in a smart learning environment can
provide a unique approach to developing innovative solutions
to the challenges faced by educators in the digital age. The use
of a smart learning environment for teacher professional
development can provide personalized and flexible learning
opportunities that are tailored to the needs of individual
teachers. It can also promote collaboration and experimentation
among teachers, fostering a culture of continuous learning and
improvement in the classroom. The proposed framework for a
smart
learning
environment
for
teacher
professional
development based on the principles of design thinking,
personalization, flexibility, collaboration, and innovation can
provide a foundation for the development of innovative
solutions in teacher professional development in the digital
age.
B. Design Thinking and Smart Learning Environment
Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that has
gained
popularity
in
recent
years.
The
approach
is
characterized
by
a
focus
on
empathy,
creativity,
and
innovation. Design thinking involves understanding the needs
of the user, developing a deep understanding of the problem,
and then generating innovative solutions. Design thinking has
been successfully applied in many fields, including business,
healthcare, and education. Additionally, design thinking can be

applied in the creation of a smart learning environment for
teacher professional development.

The first step in the design thinking process is to
understand the needs of the user. In the case of
teacher professional development, the user is the
teacher. The designer must understand the specific
needs of the teacher, including their knowledge, skills,
and experience.

The second step in the design thinking process is to
define the problem. In the case of teacher professional
development, the problem is to provide a flexible and
personalized approach to professional development
that is tailored to the specific needs of the teacher.

The third step in the design thinking process is to
generate ideas. In the case of teacher professional
development, the designer must generate innovative
solutions that meet the needs of the teacher. This
could
involve
the
creation
of
online
learning
resources, the development of a mentorship program,
or the creation of a social learning platform.

The fourth step in the design thinking process is to
create a prototype. In the case of teacher professional
development, the designer must create a prototype of
the smart learning environment. The prototype can be
a simple version of the final product that allows the
designer to test and refine the design. This could
involve developing a small-scale pilot program to test
the effectiveness of the smart learning environment.

The fifth and final step in the design thinking process
is to
test and iterate. In the case of teacher
professional development, the designer must test the
smart learning environment with a group of teachers
and iterate based on their feedback. This process
allows the designer to refine the design and make
improvements based on the needs of the user.

METHODOLOGY
The study aims to develop a conceptual framework to
explore the relationship between design thinking, smart
learning environments, and teacher professional development
in the era of digital transformation. To achieve this aim, a
comprehensive methodology was employed, which involved a
rigorous and systematic literature review [26][27].
The literature review was conducted using the two main
scientific databases, Web of Science and Scopus, and other
academic
databases
such
as
ERIC,
ScienceDirect,
and
SpringerLink. The academic search engine, Google Scholar,
was used in locating additional relevant literature. A literature
search strategy was employed using the relevant keywords
“design
thinking,” “design-based
learning,” “learning by
design,” “smart learning,” “smart learning environment,” and
“teacher professional development.”
For a study to
be
included, it had to be in English, full-text, and a journal article
and had to be aligned with the objective of this study by
focusing on using design practices to build a smart learning
milieu to promote teacher professional development.
Figure 1. PRISMA Diagram
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were employed to
select relevant articles and publications. The 24 research
articles were included in the analytic process in accordance
with PRISMA [28] the quality of the sources was assessed
using established criteria for critical appraisal [29]. This helped
to ensure that the literature reviewed was both comprehensive
and high-quality..
The literature review focused on exploring key concepts,
theories, and best practices related to the use of design thinking
and smart learning environments in teacher professional
development, as well as the impact of digital transformation on
the teaching and learning process. This allowed for a deep
understanding of the theoretical background of the study, and
provided a solid foundation for the development of the
conceptual framework.
A thematic approach was used to analyze the data collected
from the literature review, which involved identifying key
themes and concepts, and organizing them into a logical
framework.
This
helped
to
ensure
that
the
conceptual
framework was grounded in the relevant literature and
accurately reflected the key theoretical concepts and themes
related to the research questions.
The
limitations
of
this
methodology
were
carefully
considered and addressed. For instance, the potential for bias in
the selection and interpretation of the literature was minimized
by using established inclusion and exclusion criteria, and by
critically appraising the quality of the sources. Additionally,
the potential for gaps in the literature was addressed by
conducting a comprehensive search across multiple sources
and using a variety of search terms.

IV. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK FOR A SMART LEARNING
ENVIRONMENT FOR TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
The rapid pace of digital transformation has had a
significant impact on education, and teacher professional
development has become an essential part of the process. The
emergence of new technologies and the changing learning
environment
have
made
it
necessary
to
reevaluate
the
traditional
approach
to
professional
development.
The
traditional approach to professional development has typically
involved attending workshops, conferences, and other training
sessions. However, in the era of digital transformation, there is
a need for a more flexible and personalized approach to
professional development. Therefore, based on the principles
of design thinking, we propose a framework for the design of a
smart
learning
environment
for
teacher
professional
development. The framework is based on four key principles:
personalization, flexibility, collaboration, and innovation, as
shown in Figure 1.
o
Personalization: The smart learning environment must
be tailored to the specific needs of the teacher. This
could involve the creation of personalized learning
paths,
the
development
of
customized
learning
resources, or the provision of individualized coaching
and mentorship.
o
Flexibility: The smart learning environment must be
flexible and
accessible. This could involve the
creation of online learning resources that can be
accessed anytime and anywhere, or the provision of
virtual coaching and mentorship.
o
Collaboration: The smart learning environment must
promote collaboration and community building. This
could
involve
the
creation
of
social
learning
platforms,
the
development
of
peer
mentoring
programs, or the provision of opportunities for
teachers to collaborate on projects and share ideas.
o
Innovation: The smart learning environment must
promote innovation and experimentation. This could
involve the provision of opportunities for teachers to
experiment
with
new
teaching
strategies,
the
development of innovation challenges, or the creation
of incubators for new ideas.
Figure 2. Proposed Conceptual Framework
The proposed conceptual framework illustrates that TPD
programs with active and situated learning approaches have
shown to be effective in enhancing teacher competencies and
skills.
Active
learning
involves
hands-on
activities,
experiential learning, and interactive teaching methods that
promote engagement and participation. Situated learning
refers to learning that takes place in a real-world context,
providing
teachers
with
opportunities
to
apply
their
knowledge and skills in authentic situations. Collaborative
learning,
where
teachers
work
together
to
share
their
knowledge and experiences, can also enhance TPD outcomes.
Content-focused TPD programs are designed to deepen
teachers' knowledge of specific subject areas or instructional
strategies, and self-paced TPD programs allow teachers to
learn at their own pace, providing flexibility and autonomy.
Finally, reflective learning involves self-reflection on teaching
practices,
which
can
help
teachers
identify
areas
for
improvement
and
enhance
their
teaching
effectiveness.
Overall, TPD programs that incorporate these characteristics
can be effective in improving teacher competencies and
ultimately enhancing student learning outcomes.
On the other hand, relationship between TPD, design
thinking,
and
Smart
Learning
Environments
can
be
strengthened through the use of technology-mediated TPD
platforms. These platforms can provide anytime, anywhere
access
to
interactive,
intelligent,
and
adaptive
learning
activities that are content-sensitive and personalized to the
needs
of
individual
teachers.
By
incorporating
these
technologies into TPD, educators can promote a culture of
continuous learning and improvement, enabling them to
develop innovative solutions to challenges faced in the digital
age.

CONCLUSION
The era of digital transformation has made it necessary to
reevaluate the traditional approach to teacher professional
development. Design thinking offers a unique approach to
problem-solving that can help educators develop innovative

solutions to the challenges they face. A smart learning
environment can provide a flexible and personalized approach
to professional development that meets the specific needs of
the teacher. By adopting a design thinking approach, educators
can create a smart learning environment [30] that promotes
collaboration,
innovation,
and
continuous
learning
and
improvement.
