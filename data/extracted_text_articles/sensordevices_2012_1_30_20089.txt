Abstract—Vibration analysis is a promising approach in
order to detect early hip prosthesis loosening, with the potential
to extend the range of diagnostic tools currently available in
clinical routine. Ongoing research efforts and developments in
the area of smart implants, which integrate sensors, wireless
power supply, communication and signal processing, provide
means to obtain valuable in vivo information otherwise not
available. In the current work a medical wireless measurement
system is presented, which is integrated in the femoral head
of a hip prosthesis. The passive miniaturized system includes
a 3-axis acceleration sensor and signal pre-processing through
a lock-in ampliﬁer circuit. Bidirectional data communication
and power supply is reached through inductive coupling with
an operating frequency of 125 kHz in accordance with the ISO
18000-2 protocol standard. The system allows the acquisition
of the acceleration frequency response of the femur-prosthesis
system between 500 to 2500 Hz. Applied laboratory measure-
ments with system prototypes on artiﬁcial bones and integrated
prostheses demonstrate the feasibility of the measurement
system approach, clearly showing differences in the vibration
behavior due to an implant loosening.

I. INTRODUCTION
Established and widely used diagnostic techniques in
clinical routine, such as plain radiography, bone scintigraphy
or arthrography (subtraction or nuclear), are yet to unreliable
in order to determine the ﬁxation state of a hip prosthesis in
the bone as for example discussed in [1],[2],[3]. Under these
circumstances, a reliable predication of the loosening state
is still challenging and leaves room for misinterpretation.
This leads to either revision of sufﬁciently osseointegrated
endoprostheses (false-positive result) or a late diagnosis with
bone stock destruction and difﬁculties in implant revision
(false-negative result ).
Therefore, there are continuing efforts to establish new
or enhance established diagnosis techniques to increase
sensitivity and speciﬁcity. In [4], a shaft integrated loosening
sensor based on the conservation of momentum theory is
described and evaluated with an oversized demonstrator; in
[5], an ultrasound based extracorporeal testing method is

presented. A promising alternative approach to determine
the loosening state is vibration analysis, e.g., frequently used
in mechanical structural analysis. A measurement system,
capable of delivering amplitude and phase information of a
femurs’ frequency acceleration response due to a mechanical
excitation, is the required base to extract system resonance
frequencies. By monitoring the shift of these resonances,
predictions about the loosening state are possible. Several
early attempts used both extracorporeal vibration excitation
and extracorporeal acceleration measurement in order to
determine the system response in frequency or time domain.
Especially for an extracorporeal acceleration measurement
the obtained signal amplitude is heavily damped due to
the inﬂuence of tissue. Is a miniaturized system directly
incorporated into the prosthesis, as, e.g., realized by Puers
[6], the negative inﬂuences of tissue in the measurement
path are minimized. In difference to a previous realization
with a prosthesis shaft integrated system [7], a solution
with a femoral ball head integrated measurement system is

presented (Fig. 1). Within this work the proposed overall
medical system is described, a detailed view of the integrated
lock-in ampliﬁer is given and experimental results of ap-
plied measurements on an artiﬁcial bone-prosthesis system,
demonstrating the inﬂuence of loosening, are presented.
II. DIAGNOSTIC MEASUREMENT SYSTEM
The diagnostic measurement system (Fig. 2) consists of
two main components: the prosthesis integrated wireless
sensor system (intracorporeal unit) and a reader station
combined with a mechanical vibration excitation and mea-
surement system, both connected to a PC (extracorporeal
unit).
The wireless sensor tag is placed in the femoral ball head
of the hip implant, in difference to the previous placement
in the stem [7]. This approach follows the request of the
medical industry project partners due to the following rea-
sons: 1) it simpliﬁes the manufacturing process (modifying
stems involves higher costs) 2) it permits an unproblematic
sterilization process (stems exhibit a special micro porous
surface coating supporting osseointegration, which requires
a gamma sterilization process with devastating effect on
integrated hard- and ﬁrmware) and 3) it reduces the required
number of system variations (there are less femoral ball
head types and embodiments). The intracorporeal system is
built around a freely programmable transponder unit called
Smart Tag 1 (Fraunhofer IPMS ST1). A solution on chip
designed speciﬁcally for transponder applications requiring
a sensor interface in order to monitor physical quantities
besides providing identiﬁcation information. It includes a
16 bit MSP430 microcontroller core, 16 kByte Flash, 8
kByte RAM and 512 Byte EEPROM memory, 16 digital
I/O signals, 2 counter/interval timers, a Real-time clock, RF
front end, 10 bit A/D converter with four channels, I2C
bus module and an integrated voltage regulator. Wireless
energy transmission and bidirectional data communication
via inductive coupling and amplitude modulation between
tag and reader is in accordance to ISO 18000-2 standard
at a carrier frequency of 125 kHz. Transponder coil and a
tuning resonance capacity are connected directly to the chip.
In order to perform vibration analysis, the application
speciﬁc circuitry incorporates a low power acceleration
sensor (ADXL327, Analog Devices) for x, y and z axis
measurements with a mechanical resonance frequency of
5.5 kHz. It provides a typical measurement frequency range
(3dB cutoff frequency) of 0.5 to 1600 Hz in x, y direction
and 0.5 to 550 Hz in z direction and a typical mechanic
sensitivity of 420 mV/g with a measurement range of ±2.5g.
Since the acceleration sensor output is strongly affected by
noise, additional signal preprocessing is required. For this
purpose a lock-in ampliﬁer, based on the chopper principle,
has been integrated in the sensor tag in order to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio.
Figure 2.
Overview of the diagnostic measurement system.
The mechanic excitation system consists of an electro
dynamic vibration excitation (S50018, TIRAvib) with a
maximum force of 18 N (unloaded) and a working frequency
range from 2 Hz to 18 kHz. It is connected to a power
ampliﬁer and measurement unit. Besides ampliﬁcation of
the excitation signal provided by the reader, it is responsible
for measurements of excitation current and voltage as well
as acceleration and static pressure at the point of force
application. For a medical diagnosis system, these additional
measurements are necessary in order to detect faults and to
ensure reproducibility between different measurements.
The external reader unit is responsible for magnetic ﬁeld
generation, data extraction and provides the low frequency
input signal for the sinusoidal mechanical vibration exci-
tation. Further measurement ﬂow control, processing and
visualization of measurement data as well as data storage
and maintenance is carried out on a PC connected to the
reader.
III. INTEGRATED LOCK-IN MEASUREMENT
The lock-in measurement technique, as an application of
cross-correlation in signal processing, has been identiﬁed as
a very useful approach to reduce the noise inﬂuence in the
measured acceleration sensor signal [8]. It is integrated in
the wireless sensor tag as a discrete circuit. The approach
is feasible due to the facts that the mechanical system
(prosthesis, femur and surrounding tissue) is excited through
the shaker with a signal of known frequency and phase, the
acceleration response is time-periodic and shows a ﬁx phase
relation for each frequency, and the mechanical excitation
signals frequency and phase information is available in the
wireless sensor tag in order to generate the lock-in reference

signal. The integrated lock-in can be described through Eq.
1, in which UL is the voltage after applying the lock-
in technique, UM is the measured signal amplitude, ωM
the measured signal frequency, ωref the reference signal
frequency and φref the reference signal phase, which are
averaged over the time period T.

When the excitation signal has the same frequency as the

The unwanted parts in Eq. 2 are of increasing inﬂuence in
the case of small integration times and signal frequencies.
If for a given frequency a phase match is reached (phase
difference φref = 0) the lock-in ampliﬁed signal reaches its
maximum signal output (Eq. 3).
UL = UM

Due to technical constraints, such as available energy
and space in the sensor tag, the generation of a sinusoidal
reference can be to costly. In this case a periodic rectangular
signal can be used, as reference for the lock-in ampliﬁer
(chopper principle), an approach also chosen for the sensor
tag. The associated special circumstances (i.e., higher order
harmonics) have been discussed in [7].
The acceleration sensor signal is AC coupled and split into
two signal paths, which are separately ampliﬁed (inverted
and non-inverted) and passed through a switch to an integra-
tor (low pass). Switching is controlled with the rectangular
reference signal (with ωref, φref) by the transponder unit
ST1. The base frequency, for both excitation and lock-
in reference signal, is the 125 kHz telemetry frequency
of an internal oscillator (synchronized with reader station),
which is divided by the factor n. This leads to a large step
width with increasing frequencies. The controller can adjust
the phase shift to obtain measurements with an arbitrary
phase angle. A disadvantage of the chopper principle is the
occurrence of harmonics, due to the fact that the reference
signal is rectangular. These are damped by the low pass
before digitized through the 10 bit A/D converter in the
sensor tag.
The magnitude information, in general, is easier to in-
terpret in order to identify the initially unknown system
resonances. If the extrema of a single phase measurement
are evaluated a changing phase relation (i.e., change of

mined extrema frequency value (Fig. 3). By performing two
measurements for each examined frequency (UL,A,UL,B),
with a 90◦ phase difference, the magnitude can be calculated.
The result is independent from an unknown reference phase
angle (Eq. 4) and the behavior of a dual phase lock-in
ampliﬁer can be reproduced (regarding the magnitude).

Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 demonstrate the feasibility of the ap-
proach with both numerically simulated and experimentally
obtained data from the measurement system. For the applied
measurements with the measurement system, the reference
phase value has been varied in steps of 10◦ between 0◦ and
90◦. For each frequency point the two consecutive measure-
ments (φref =x◦, φref =x◦+90◦) were made instantly after
each other.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The overall system prototype has been tested in a mea-
surement setup, which allows a varying anchorage of a
prosthesis (Bicontact S, Aesculap) in an artiﬁcial femur
(Sawbone). The housed sensor tag prototype is placed at
the proximal end of the prosthesis stem and pressed onto
the stem (Fig. 6). A reproducible anchorage variation is
realized through threaded sleeves, placed in the artiﬁcial
femur, which are distributed evenly around the prosthesis. In
order to verify the feasibility of the measurement approach,
the inﬂuence of loosening (decreasing prosthesis anchorage)
on the resonance frequencies in the frequency spectrum
is of interest. Therefore, the mechanical setup focuses on
this behavior. Other inﬂuencing mechanical factors (i.e.,
surrounding tissue, hip and knee boundary conditions, etc.)

(TIRAvib S522). The mechanic connection is realized via
a clamp, placed at the central part of the femur, and a

is connected to a PC running the user application. It also

implant, the damping effects of tissue in the measurement
path can be overcome. Different loosening states of the
implant can be distinguished in the mechanic frequency
response of the bone-prosthesis system as demonstrated in
the experimental section. In general, resonance frequencies
are shifted to lower values if the loosening increases. When
later on performing measurements with real patients, the
obtained frequency spectra will be very different between
patients (bone and tissue mass/stiffness, muscle tension,
etc.). Therefore, a reference data set, obtained from a mea-
surement after the hip replacement and ﬁnished prosthesis
osseointegration, is needed for each patient. It can serve as
a reference for long term patient monitoring and can be
part of a medical case database. Additional experiments, not
in the scope of this paper, indicate that mechanic cross-
sensitivities, such as static load or mass of surrounding
tissue, also inﬂuence the detected resonances and need fur-
ther analysis. Current work focuses on the identiﬁcation of
additional affecting factors and their impact (e.g., inﬂuence
of lubrication) onto resonance shifts, the improvement of the
wireless data transmission within the challenging metal en-
vironment (stem and backing), an improved bio-compatible
housing and the preparation of the medical approval as
well as the development of meaningful data visualization
strategies supporting the diagnostic system.
