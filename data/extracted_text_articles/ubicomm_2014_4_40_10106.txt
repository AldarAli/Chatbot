Abstract—IPv6-based mobility management techniques for 
Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) system are proposed to improve 
the performance of a variety of Fast Handover of Proxy MIPv6 
(F-PMIPv6). However, F-PMIPv6 cannot be better than 
PMIPv6 in all scenarios. Therefore, selecting a proper mobility 
management scheme between PMIPv6 and F-PMIPv6 is an 
interesting issue, for its potential in enhancing the capacity and 
scalability of a system. We developed an analytical model to 
analyze the applicability of PMIPv6 and F-PMIPv6. Based on 
this model, we designed a Secure Smart Mobility (SSM) 
scheme that selects the better alternative between PMIPv6 and 
F-PMIPv6 for user according to changing mobility and service 
characteristics. When F-PMIPv6 is adopted, SSM chooses the 
best mobility anchor point and regional size to optimize the 
system performance. Numerical results illustrate the impact of 
key parameters on the applicability of PMIPv6 and F-PMIPv6. 
SSM has been proven to show better results than both PMIPv6 
and F-PMIPv6.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [1] lets Mobile Nodes 
(MNs) connect to the PMIPv6 domain with various 
interfaces at the same time, and supports inter-equipment 
handover. Even though PMIPv6 reduced the handover delay 
time compare to Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [2] and its extensions, 
it is inferior in regard to applications with requirements for 
real-time communications such as Voice of IP (VoIP). 
Moreover, the handover interrupt time of the vertical 
handover process is longer than that of a horizontal handover 
process, because a Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) 
process has to occur the new interface of the MN receives 
the packet. For these reasons, Fast Handover for PMIPv6 (F-
PMIPv6) [3] and Fast Handover for Hierarchical MIPv6 
(FH-PMIPv6) [4] is proposed to improve the handover 
performance of PMIPv6. 
PMIPv6 allows for maintaining the existing connection 
even if MIPv6 is not applied. It is a network-based mobility 
management technique to manage node mobility. Also, 
PMIPv6 supports multiple interfaces. Handover needs to be 
considered when Mobile Access Gateways (MAGs) have 
different interfaces. PMIPv6 must also go through a Local 
Mobility Anchor (LMA). If a Corresponding Node (CN) and 
MN are in the same area, packets inefficiently have to go 
through the LMA. Due to the network-based nature of 
PMIPv6, interfaces of the terminals can be known. Thus, 
additional signaling processes and MAGs have to be 
proceeded. If an MN connects through a new interface, the 
PMIPv6 domain does not have the information about the 
intensions of the MN regarding whether its connection is for 
undergoing handovers or multi-roaming. In the PMIPv6 
domain, packets converge to LMA and cause a bottleneck 
state. Additional LMAs with an inter-LMA redirection 
function can help with load balancing and network 
stabilizing. Therefore, the establishment of a protocol for 
inter-LMA redirection is needed. 
Based on [5]-[9], our SSM scheme is proposed to 
resolve two of the existing problems. It chooses the better 
alternative between PMIPv6 and F-PMIPv6 according to its 
mobility transitions and service conditions. When F-
PMIPv6 is chosen, SSM selects the optimized mobility 
anchor point and its regional size, as well as the better 
protocol by analyzing the applications of PMIPv6 and F-
PMIPv6. This paper proposes a reference analysis model 
based on two functions. First, Internet architectures are 
modeled using an MIP network. The MIP network is based 
on the cellular architecture used in Personal Communication 
System (PCS). PCS is region-oriented, while the Internet is 
space-oriented. In a region-oriented network, the distance 
between two terminals is measured by their physical spaces. 
Therefore, the Internet architecture is suitable for an abstract 
MIP network. The proposed analysis model considers both 
registration and packet transmission capabilities. Previous 
research preferred statistics about delayed handovers 
according to a registration record of the mobility 
management. However, packet transmission capability is 
also an important statistic in delay-sensitive services like 
mobile networks. Thus, considering both registration and 
packet transmission capability is important in analysis 
research. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
of this paper covers the handover techniques of PMIPv6 and 
F-PMIPv6. Section 3 proposes SSM and explains the 
security certification processes. Section 4 presents the 
numerical values and results, and Section 5 summarizes and 
concludes the study.

RELATED WORK 
A. Handover of Network-based Mobility Protocols 
To resolve the problems of the existing host-based 
mobility protocols, PMIPv6 [1] is proposed. When mobile 
terminal equipment tries to perform a handover, PMIPv6 
deals with the situation on the network, without concern for 
any of the IPv6 mobility protocol-related signals. In the 
current state of MIPv6, when mobile terminal equipment 
tries to do a handover, it has to register its location. But, in 
the case of PMIPv6, internet application services are 
available only with the IPv6 stacks.  
F-PMIPv6 [3] was proposed to reduce the packet losses 
from the MAG-LMA handover delay. Like the existing 
FMIPv6, F-PMIPv6 sets tunnels between the Previous MAG 
(PMAG) and destination NMAG to reduce the packet loss 
before the mobile terminal equipment moves to a new 
network. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Handover of F-PMIPv6. 
Fig. 1 shows the handover process of F-PMIPv6. 
Through tunneling, packets can be transmitted between 
PMAG and NMAG, even if the link is separated. However, 
this simultaneously overloads the network since the tunnel 
exchanges only the tunnel-related signals are exchanged 
between the MAGs, with no transmission of BU to LMA. 
Also, the transmission of BU from the MAG to the LMA to 
achieve Routing Optimization (RO) can cause order 
disturbance of packets. 
B. Security Certification Process 
Major operations of the security certification process are 
the initial registration process and the certification process. 
To join a regional mobile domain, an MN has to register at 
the AAA server and carry out a certification process to 
connect to the internet through the MAG [10]. 
III. 
SECURE-SMART MOBILITY (SSM) SCHEME 
In this section, the Secure-Smart Mobility (SSM) 
method is proposed. SSM resolves the two following issues. 
It selects the better alternative between PMIPv6 and F-
PMIPv6 for the users. And, when F-PMIPv6 is selected, 
SSM optimizes the LMA and system performance by 
choosing a proper regional size. Fig. 2 shows the structure 
of SSM and the operation of SSM. SSM is made up of four 
parts: LMA, MAG, MN, and a certifier AAA server. LMA 
and MAG are connected through a bi-directional tunnel 
using Proxy CoA. In SSM, a MAG does not have to be in 
the control of one LMA. 
SSM is a protocol that supports mobility in a limited 
domain without the additional functional modification of 
MNs. The MN in a relevant domain can be distinguished 
from its MN-ID. If MN operates in the domain, connection 
certification is performed, and when it is completed, the MN 
receives a Home Network Prefix (HNP). The network 
supports mobility by maintaining the HNP of the MN 
statically, so that the MN can operate as if it is in the same 
Layer 3 wherever it is. LMA acts as a kind of home domain 
of the MN in the domain. It is usually located in the gateway 
location in the domain, and assigns HNP and sends it to the 
MN. LMA ensures the connection by maintaining the 
location and address information of every terminal of its 
range of management. Every packet sent from outside of the 
domain to inside is designed to be received by the LMA, 
and the packets are sent to the MN through the tunnel with 
the MAG. In contrast, packets sent from inside to outside of 
the domain are tunneled from MAG to LMA, and LMA 
sends those to the outside. 
  
 
Figure 2.  Operation of SSM. 
MAG is the first hop that is directly connected to the 
MN, and instead of the MN, it undergoes mobility support 
signaling. Also, MAG performs the network connecting and 
routing functions of the MN. If the MN connects to the 
MAG, the MAG sets for the connection with LMA using 
the information of MN, and receives packets from the LMA 
for MN. Policy profiles include the address and its setup 
method of the LMA in charge, HNP information of the MN, 
the service policy, etc. MAG and LMA can be informed 
about the HMP information of the MN, and complete MN 
certification through these profiles. 
SSM concerns every factor related to the network and 
MN. The most important factor so far is reflected on LMA, 
which affects the values of A, B, and δ. The discovery of a 
mobile LMA needs an LMA option of the router 
advertisement propagated into the MN from the LMA by a 
specific router interface. The LMA option includes a 
preferences field which is utilized in reflecting loads in 
LMA, and it ranges from 0 to 15. Another important 
network factor is the average distance between an LMA and 
its reachable MAG(lLMA→MAG). lLMA→MAG  is made manually

in the LMA, and can be included in the extended LMA 
option offered to the MN. To obtain the number of hops to 
deliver the packets or signals, an MN or LMA can use the 
TTL field in the IP header. Then, the average number can be 
used when calculating CT. The most important MN-related 
factors are the average time (T) that an MN stays in the 
MAG, and the average ratio of packet arrival (α). These 
parameters can be collected regularly by each MN using 
statistical analysis. 
Suppose that the regional size of the MN’s relocation is 
K. When K has an increasing value, F-PMIPv6 can obtain 
more average registration while the average packet 
transmission expense is increasing. However, K cannot be 
increased 
unlimitedly 
because 
of 
the 
bottleneck 
phenomenon of LMA. The overall average packet 
processing delay occurs due to α ∙ (AωK + BlgK + δ), and 
can be differentiated by its load [9]. Thus, the optimized K 
which minimizes the overall cost CT can be represented as 
Kopt, and it optimizes the overall performance of F-PMIPv6 
compared to PMIPv6.

𝑠. 𝑡.   𝛼 ∙ (𝐴𝜔𝐾 + 𝐵𝑙𝑔𝐾 + 𝛿) < 𝜑         𝐾 ∈ 𝑍+     
where ψ is a constant which limits the overall packet 
process delay of LMA. 
CFPIMPv6, the cost function of F-PMIPv6, represents the 
absolute performance of F-PMIPv6 in view of the average 
registration and packet transmission delay. 
𝐶𝐹𝑃𝑀𝐼𝑃𝑣6 = 𝑛1 +
(𝑚−1)𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎+𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟
𝑚𝑇
+ 𝑛2 ∙ 𝑇𝑃𝐻       
Due to the restriction of α ∙ (AωK + BlgK+ δ) < ψ, CT 
and CFPIMPv6 are minimized which lets Kopt represent the 
absolute performance and the relative performance. 
CFPMIPv6 = CT + n1 ∙ D + n2 ∙ TPM                                   
Since it is independent of K, CFPMIPv6 moves through the 
Y axis by CT in the scale of CT + n1 ∙ D + n2 ∙ TPM. 
Consequently, the K value that minimizes CT and CFPMIPv6 is 
from the restriction α ∙ (AωK + BlgK+ δ) < ψ. Therefore F-
PMIPv6 can achieve both its absolute performance and its 
relative performance. Since (1) is too complex, it needs to 
be simplified. Since K is not limitless, suppose the 
maximum value is N, the same as the number of MAGs that 
MN can relocate. As K increases, the following will occur: 
Case 1: If the differential function of CT, CT’, shows the 
trend of CT’(N) > 0 on the site of its first origination from CT, 
then CT (K) increases instead of decreasing. In this case, CT 
(1) is the minimum. 
Case 2: In the case of CT’(K), the increasing and 
decreasing domain of CT (K) is first altered from over zero 
to below zero. CT’(K) is the minimum when K’ = K:min(CT 
(K=1), CT (K=Kmax). This analysis simplifies the solution 
of Kopt, as shown below. 
Clearly, Kopt can optimize the performance of F-PMIPv6. 
Yet, CT (Kopt) > 0 indicates that the optimized performance 
of F-PMIPv6 is still poorer than that of PMIPv6. Therefore, 
PMIPv6 is the most adequate alternative if CT (Kopt) > 0. 
However, F-PMIPv6 is more adequate when there are many 
MAGs in LMA. Since CFPMIPv6 represents the absolute 
performance of F-PMIPv6 and Kopt minimizes both CT and 
CFPMIPv6, LMA should be designated as an optimized 
regional mobility management entity with the minimization 
of CT (Kopt), and Kopt should be the optimized regional size.

PERFORMANCE EVALUTION 
A. Cost analysis of PMIPv6 and F-PMIPv6 
This section compares the register performance and 
defines the average registration profit DR as the average 
registration time using F-PMIPv6 instead of PMIPv6. If DR 
has a positive value, the average registration delay of 
PMIPv6 is shorter than that of F-PMIPv6. Independent from 
the handover delay time, the MN does not consider the 
regular binding update, which refreshes and delivers its 
binding record when analyzing CN or LMA. The major 
symbols of the subdivided section are displayed in Table 1.

The number of handovers required in moving an MN, 
m(m≥1) means that the MN relocates to a new area on the 
mth handover trial. Therefore, the overall average delays 
DFPT and DPT from the mth handover of MN in F-PMIPv6

Suppose that the average signal transmission delay of a 
wired link is proportional to the measured distance between 
the moving numbers of a hop. Let the cost of the unit 
distance signal transmission be μ, which includes the unit 
distance propagation delay and cuing delay of each hop. 
Since the wireless bandwidth is usually narrow, suppose the 
average signal transmission delay of a wireless link is θ ∙ μ 
when a > 1. The average signal transmission delay is 
different between the core network and the access network. 
To simplify the analysis, μ reflects the average level of a 
signal in the core network and the access network. 
Therefore, DR can be altered to (10).

       
Using (10), high registration profit from the distance 
between the MN and MAG and the distance between the 
LMA and MAG can be obtained from F-PMIPv6. When DR 
< 0, higher average registration profit can be obtained from 
F-PMIPv6. According to (9)-(10), m has to satisfy the 
following (11) to achieve DR < 0.

     
The value of m has a close relation with the size of the 
region. Suppose each MN transfers to a random LMA, and 
the regional size is K. 
When MN always roams in the assigned area, F-PMIPv6 
has better performance than PMIPv6 in registration, and the 
average registration profit can be calculated as |2μ ∙ (lLMA→
MAG-(MinInt + MaxInt)/2|. K≥N when MN roams in its 
region. If F-PMIPv6 is selected, the number of handovers of 
intra-LMA and inter-LMA are m-1 and 0, respectively. 
However, if PMIPv6 is selected, the number of handovers 
would be m-1. Therefore, DR can be calculated as below. 
𝐷𝑅 =
(𝑚−1)𝐷𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎−(𝑚−1)𝐷𝑅𝑀

Generally, lLMA→MAG-(MinInt + MaxInt)/2 < 0, and there 
are no big differences between MAG and MN in the average 
registration signal process delay time. In this case, DR can 
be simplified as 2μ ∙ (lLMA→MAG-(MinInt + MaxInt)/2. Since 
2μ ∙ (lLMA →MAG-(MinInt + MaxInt)/2 < 0, F-PMIPv6 has 
better performance than PMIPv6 in registration. Also, the 
average registration profit is related to |2μ ∙ (lLMA →MAG - 
(MinInt + MaxInt)|. 
When MN roams between indifferent areas, DR is 
dependent on the regional area K, and their relations are 
arranged in (13). Also, F-PMIPv6 can achieve average 
registration profit only when (14) is satisfied.

When MN roams between indifferent areas, K < N. In 
this case, when condition I indicates an MN which enters 
LMA(i = 1, 2, …, N), the movement of a roaming MN 
through different MAGs can be modeled by a Markov chain. 
As in Fig. 3, it is predicted that the MN can move in each 
direction (except for the boundary MAGs) with a 
probability of 1/2.

With (20), (10) and (11) can be converted to (13) and 
(14), respectively. Clearly, DR is dependent on the regional 
size by (13). A high K value indicates a high average 
registration profit. Also, the average registration profit of F-
PMIPv6 can be obtained only in case if (14) is satisfied. 
The packet transmission performance is compared and 
defined. The average packet transmission cost TP is defined 
as the average consumed time to deliver packets from CN to 
MN through F-PMIPv6 instead of PMIPv6.

The major symbols used in analyzing TP are shown in 
Table 2. In PMIPv6 and F-PMIPv6, packets can be 
delivered in two modes. One is transmitting packets through 
the MAG. In this mode, the MAG receives every packet 
instead of the MN and delivers it to the MN. In the other 
mode, packets are directly delivered to the MN. In the 
following analysis, the average packet transmission cost is 
modeled by the former mode, but its implied method is the 
latter. The average delay of packet transmission from CN to 
MN through PMIPv6 and F-PMIPv6 can be depicted as 
follows.

= 𝛼 ∙ (𝑇𝑀 + 𝑇𝐶𝑁→𝐿𝑀𝐴 + 𝑇𝑀𝐴𝐺→𝑀𝑁 − 𝑇𝐿𝑀𝐴→𝑀𝐴𝐺)         
The average processing delay of LMA(TM) is established 
in a similar way to that in the previous study. Since the 
average number of regional MN is ωK, suppose that the 
MAG can provide an average ω of MN. Therefore, the 
complexity of finding the binding cash in LMA is 
proportional to ωK. Also, since an inquiry of an IP routing 
table is generally based on the corresponding longest prefix, 
it is realized using a Patricia Trie [9]. The complexity of an 
IP routing table inquiry is proportional to the length of the 
routing table log. The average delay of packet encapsulation 
in LMA is δ. So, when A and B are clearly defined 
coefficients, TM can be calculated by (24). 
𝑇𝑀 = 𝐴𝜔𝐾 + 𝐵𝑙𝑔𝐾 + 𝛿                           
Suppose that the average packet transmission delay of a 
wired link is proportional to the number of relocated hops 
with coefficient η. Then, (23) can be converted to (25). 
𝑇𝑃 = 𝛼 ∙ (𝐴𝜔𝐾 + 𝐵𝑙𝑔𝐾 + 𝛿  
+η(𝑙𝐶𝑁→𝐿𝑀𝐴 + 𝑙𝐿𝑀𝐴→𝑀𝐴𝐺 −
𝑀𝑖𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑡+𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐼𝑛𝑡

)         
From 𝑙𝐶𝑁→𝐿𝑀𝐴 + 𝑙𝐿𝑀𝐴→𝑀𝐴𝐺 ≥
𝑀𝑖𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑡+𝑀𝑎𝑥𝐼𝑛𝑡

, it is clear 
that (25) represents the average packet transmission cost TP. 
TP < 0 indicates that the average packet transmission delay 
of F-PMIPv6 is higher than that of PMIPv6. This is based 
on the fact that the regional propagation of LMA is the 
result of a triangle routing problem. The route of packet 
transmission is converted from PMIPv6 to an outer network 
to the outer network of an MN F-PMIPv6 and then the 
LMA, and finally, the MN. 
The overall cost function expressed as CT describes the 
general performance of F-PMIPv6 compared to PMIPv6 in 
every point of view, including registration and packet 
transmission. n1 and n2 are coefficients defined in (26). 
𝐶𝑇 = 𝑛1 ∙ 𝐷𝑅 + 𝑛2 ∙ 𝑇𝑃                        
It reflects the application of F-PMIPv6 and PMIPv6. 
When CT < 0, F-PMIPv6 is applied rather than PMIPv6 or 
F-PMIPv6 is more adequate. 
B. Numerical Results 
The numerical analysis of several major parameters of F-
PMIPv6 and PMIPv6 is shown. SSM, PMIPv6, and F-
PMIPv6 are compared. The values of parameters used here 
are shown in Table 3.

The registration delay in PMIPv6 or F-PMIPv6 affects 
the handover delay directly. This is an important statistic to 
evaluate the quality of service in the network. n1 > n2 due to 
the importance of handover delay. 
Suppose that the MN does not relocate the access point 
more frequently than once every second. So, T ≥ 1. The 
TTL field of the IP header is generally 32 or 64. That is, the

limit of the number of hops through which packets can be 
transmitted is 32 or 64. 𝑙𝐶𝑁→𝐿𝑀𝐴 = 25 and 𝑙𝐿𝑀𝐴→𝑀𝐴𝐺 = 10. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Impact of T on CT. 
Fig. 4 explains the relations between CT and T. In this 
scenario, α = 0.05 and 𝑙𝐿𝑀𝐴→𝑀𝐴𝐺 = 6. CT is less than zero 
when K > 9, and it decreases with T since T reflects the 
velocity of MN. In a small region (K ≤ 9), the MN moves 
fast, and the ratio of MNs that show fast relocation is high. 
Due to the double registration in F-PMIPv6 would cause a 
long registration delay. In this case, F-PMIPv6 cannot 
deliver the average registration profit. As the MN movement 
becomes faster, the F-PMIPv6 registration performance is 
more degenerated. On the other hand, when K is high 
enough (K ≥ 9), the probability of an N that moves outside 
of the region is low, even if the MN is moving fast. In other 
words, most of the mobility is micro mobility. In this case, 
F-PMIPv6 can yield the average registration profit. 
 
Figure 5.  Impact of α on CT. 
Fig. 5 depicts the effect of α on CT. In this scenario, T = 
100 and 𝑙𝐿𝑀𝐴→𝑀𝐴𝐺 = 6. It shows the proportional trend of 
CT and α. The fact that the average packet transmission cost 
increases as α increases leads to an increasing value of CT. 
 
Figure 6.  Cost vs. T. 
In Fig. 6, the cost is a combination of the registration 
delay and packet transmission delay. The Cost of PMIPv6 
can be calculated as n1 ∙ DRM + n2 ∙ TPM.

CONCLUSION 
Both PMIPv6 and F-PMIPv6 are the mobility 
management solutions for IPv6 networks. However, F-
PMIPv6 is an extension of PMIPv6, and surpasses PMIPv6 
in some aspects, not every aspect. This study proposed an 
analytical model for an improved protocol, F-PMIPv6, and 
compared it to PMIPv6. Based on this analytical model, the 
SSM method selects the most adequate protocol and MAG. 
The mathematical results explain the effects of several key 
parameters based on the application ranges of PMIPv6 and 
F-PMIPv6. With the SSM method, an adequate protocol 
between PMIPv6 and F-PMIPv6 is chosen. Also, SSM 
showed better performance compared to PMIPv6 or F-
PMIPv6.
