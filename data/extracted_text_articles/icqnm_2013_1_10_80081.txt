Abstract—Fabrication 
method 
of 
self-organized 
silver 
nanostructures by annealing of thin films is studied. The 
method has poor reproducibility and generates different 
shapes and sizes of nanostructures for identical conditions, but 
in different furnaces. To clarify the source of instability, the 
self-organized nanostructures were prepared by annealing of 
silver films with different strength of thermal radiation. The 
results demonstrate dependence of morphology and reflectance 
spectra  of  the  samples  on  power  of  thermal  radiation.  
Numerical simulations of heating conditions were performed 
and confirmed effect of thermal radiation on melting of silver 
nanostructures. The obtained results can be used to control 
self-organization of silver nanostructures and to improve 
reproducibility of the fabrication processes.

 INTRODUCTION 
Metal nanostructures are widely used in different 
applications ranging from plasmonics [1] and nanopatterning 
[2,3] to chemical catalyst [4] and metamaterials [5]. The 
most attractive are silver and gold nanostructures, because 
they possess plasmon resonances in visible range of 
wavelength and are used in biosensors [6], surface enhanced 
Raman spectroscopy (SERS) [2], near field optics [7], etc. 
Despite of this, industrial application of regular or periodic 
metal nanostructure arrays is hindered by high cost and 
complexity of their fabrication. In view of this, significant 
attention is devoted to study of random or irregular arrays of 
metal nanostructures and their applications instead of regular 
arrays. In random arrays, nanostructure shape and space 
periodicity are varied in the limited range. As a result, 
random nanostructure arrays still possess resonance features, 
similar to periodic arrays, but they are not so sharp and 
strong. It is still suitable for many applications and irregular 
arrays are widely used in SERS substrate [2] and thin film 
solar cells [8,9]. Most attractive are random arrays in which 
one or more parameters are fixed and are not varied, e.g., 
thickness of all structures is the same or all asymmetric 
structures are oriented in the same direction or shape of all 
nanoislands is spherical. 
One of the easiest and oldest methods to produce 
irregular array of metal nanoislands is physical vapor 
deposition of ultra thin metal film [10-12]. The method 
works  well  for  film  thickness  less  than  5  nm,  when  as  
deposited film consists of isolated nanoislands. At higher 
thicknesses, when deposited film is lace-like, self-
organization of nanoislands can be stimulated by annealing 
[13,14]. Depending on film material and thickness, annealing 
cab be done at different temperatures (200 – 800 C), in 
different ambient (vacuum or gas) and in the time interval 
from 1 second to several hours. In the resulting nanostructure 
array, nanoisland size and separation between nanoislands 
are usually variable, but shape is similar for most of 
structures on a substrate, e.g., array of ellipsoids or array of 
peanut-shaped structures [15]. 
Many papers are devoted to fabrication and study of 
metal nanospheres, due to potential applications in 
plasmonics and nanotechonology. The results reported 
demonstrate broad 
range of shapes and 
sizes of 
nanospheroids for similar fabrication conditions (sample 
size, film thickness and annealing temperature) [13,14,16]. 
At the same time, all studies have common features: 1) the 
diameter of spheres is less than 30 nm or film thickness is 
less than 8 nm; 2) the sample size is less than 2 x 2 cm2; 3) 
there are no details of annealing process and especially no 
information about relative strength of heating modes 
(conduction, convection and radiation). Strength of heating 
modes depends on furnace design, sample holder, position of 
sample inside of heating volume etc. Any break out of above 
mentioned limits leads to nanoislands of irregular (non 
spherical) shape. Due to this, successful reproducing of 
reported results in other furnace is problematic. In first turn, 
it concerns preparation of silver and gold nanostructures, 
which are often formed by annealing. 
In this paper, we report on the silver film annealing in 
controllable conditions with different strength of thermal 
radiation. At the same time numerical simulations are 
performed to define variations of heat fluxes through the 
sample surface. These simulations are compared with 
corresponding 
experimental 
results, to 
find 
heating 
conditions for reproducible formation of silver nanosphere 
arrays.  
The paper is organized as follows. In the subsequent 
section II, details of sample preparation and measurement 
procedures are presented. In the section III, the results of 
work are demonstrated by SEM images and reflectance 
spectra of the nanostructure arrays and also by heat transfer 
simulations. The optimal conditions of silver film annealing 
are discussed in Section IV.

II. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
We have studied 12 nm thick silver films, deposited by 
electron beam evaporation at rate 0.5 nm/s. As a substrate 
were used pieces of 4” silicon wafer with 10 nm layer of 
thermal oxide. Annealing was done in diffusion furnace in 
nitrogen ambient. To measure temperature of the samples, a 
copper plate with a hole for thermocouple was used as a 
holder. The sample had good thermal contact with the holder 
which was located on the quartz boat during experiment. The 
furnace tube was opened from one edge to provide manual 
loading and unloading of the samples at temperature of 
annealing. The tube temperature was measured by 
thermocouple and stabilized at 400 C. 
Two series of samples were prepared to study effect of 
thermal radiation on silver self-organization. In the first 
series the intensity of thermal radiation was controlled by the 
shield above the sample, in the second series the samples 
were heated on the holder in loading zone of the furnace. In 
this case there was only radiation cooling of the sample, 
because holder was hotter than furnace tube walls. 
In the first series (tube annealing), the holder was 
preheated to 130 C in the central part of the furnace tube and 
moved to loading zone of the tube. After sample loading the 
holder was moved in the central zone of the tube. The holder

steel, respectively.Scale bar is 100 nm. 
with sample was heated up during 11 minutes and moved out 
from the central zone to load zone and the sample was taken 
out. The first sample was opened to heat radiation from the 
quartz tube walls, because it was not covered by anything. 
Another two samples were covered by shield (thin plate) to 
reduce heat radiation. As a material of shield were used 
silicon and stainless steel (UNS 304) plates with thicknesses 
0.7 mm and 1 mm, respectively. The shield had sizes 75 x 85 
mm2 and supported above copper holder on the height 2.5 
mm by ceramic posts. The samples were labeled 
corresponding to tube annealing and protective plate as T, T-
Si and T-304 for uncovered, silicon covered and steel 
covered samples, respectively. 
In the second series (hot plate annealing), the holder was 
heated to target temperature in the central part of the furnace 
and moved out for sample loading. The sample was loaded 
on the hot holder and left in the load zone of the furnace for 
1 minute. During this time the sample and the copper holder 
were brought to heat equilibrium. After that the sample was 
taken out. The samples were labeled corresponding to hot 
plate annealing and temperature as HP165, HP220, HP295 
for annealing at 165 C, 220 C and 295 C, respectively. 
The metal films were deposited in e-beam evaporation 
system IM-9912 (Instrumentti Mattila Oy) at base pressure 
of 2×10-7 Torr and at room temperature of the substrate.

Annealing was done in the diffusion furnace THERMCO 
Mini Brute MB-71. Plan view and tilted at 45ͼ SEM images 
of the samples were observed with Zeiss Supra 40 field 
emission 
scanning 
electron 
microscope. 
Reflectance 
measurements at normal incidence were carried out using 
FilmTek 2000M reflectometer in the spectral range from 380 
to 890 nm. 
III. 
RESULTS 
Fig. 1 shows plan view and tilted SEM images of the 
tube annealed samples. The samples have close values of 
areal density and nanostructure sizes, but shape of 
nanoislands 
depends 
on 
annealing 
conditions. 
The 
unprotected sample T demonstrates most irregular islands 
with straight flats on some of them. The sample with silicon 
shield T-Si has roundish nanostructures with large shape 
deviation and the sample with steel shield T-304 shows 
spherical 
nanoislands 
with bi-modal 
distribution 
of 
diameters. It is visible on the tilted images, that nanospheres 
of the sample T-304 touch substrate at small contact area. In 
case of samples T and T-Si this contact area is larger and 
height of nanostructures is less than for sample T-304. 
Fig. 2 shows plan view and tilted SEM images of the hot 
plate annealed samples. In this series shape variations are 
more significant. It is observed lace like structures for low 
temperature annealed sample HP165, irregular shapes with 
rounded corners for the sample HP220 and irregular shapes 
with flats for high temperature annealed sample HP295. The 
tilted images demonstrate lowest thickness of nanostructures 
at the sample HP165 and highest thickness of nanostructures 
at the sample HP295. The largest contact area with substrate 
has sample HP220. Tube annealed sample T and hot plate 
annealed sample HP295 possess flats and look similar. 
Samples HP220 and T-Si are also similar. The sample 
HP165 from the second series has no analogue in the first 
series of samples. 
It is need to note that samples have different colours of 
the surface. The samples T, T-Si and HP295 are green, the 
sample T-304 is blue, the sample HP220 is grey-blue and the 
sample HP165 is grey. Colour difference is explained by  
different reflection spectra which are connected with 
plasmonic properties of the structures. Fig. 3a demonstrates 
reflection spectra of the tube annealed samples. According to 
surface colour, the samples T, T-Si have similar reflection 
spectra with main peak at wavelength 490 nm and trough at 
750 nm. The sample T-304 has main peak at shorter 
wavelength 450 nm and trough at 640 nm. The coincidence 
of spectra for samples T and T-Si is unexpected, because 
they have different SEM images. On the other hand, samples 
T-Si and T-304 have similar SEM images, but different 
reflection spectra. Dotted line shows spectrum of the as 
deposited silver film, i.e., spectrum of the samples before 
annealing. Fig. 3b demonstrates reflection spectra of the hot 
plate annealed samples. The low temperature sample HP165 
has spectrum similar to as deposited silver film. The sample 
HP220 has spectrum similar to T-304, but with lower height 
of peak and wider trough. The spectrum of sample HP295 is 
close to the spectrum of sample T, only it has wider and 
weaker peaks.

The simulations were done with the help of software 
COMSOL Multiphysics 3.5a. It was used general heat 
transfer model for annealing in nitrogen ambient. The effect 
of heat convection was simulated for laminar nitrogen flow 
with velocity 0.03 m/s by means of heat transfer coefficients 
from the COMSOL library. The simulations were verified by

matching of calculated and measured heating curves of the 
copper holder (not shown). Fig. 4 demonstrates example of 
temperature distribution in the furnace with steel covered 
sample T-304. The distribution is given for the holder 
temperature 250 C, which is close (see below) to the melting 
point of silver nanostructres. The heat source and the heat 
sink are furnace walls and the copper holder, respectively. 
The vertical objects in the left-bottom and right-bottoms 
corners of the Fig.4 are cross-sections of the quartz boat. 
Fig. 5 demonstrates variations of heat fluxes for the 
uncovered sample T during annealing. The flux is calculated 
over upper surface of the sample and has positive sign in 
direction of normal to the surface, i.e., outside of the sample. 
In this case, the conductive heat flux and the radiative flux 
have comparable values and decreased during heating of the 
sample. Fig. 6 shows evolution of holder and steel shield 
temperatures during annealing of the sample T-304. In the 
beginning, the shield is heated faster, but in stationary mode

the temperatures of the shield and holder are close to each 
other. The maximum difference in the holder and shield 
temperatures (overheating) happens after 250 s of heating. 
Fig. 7 illustrates effect of shielding of infrared radiation by 
steel plate. The simulations confirm intuitive feeling that 
metal shield should decrease the radiation heating of the 
sample. Indeed, radiation flux of uncovered sample is four 
times more intensive than for protected one (Fig.5 and 
Fig.7), when samples have temperature 250 C. The radiation 
still exists in the shielded sample due to overheating of the 
shield relatively sample (55 C for the sample T-304), which 
in turn irradiates the sample. The most attractive in the 
annealing of the protected sample is three times less 
conductive flux in comparison with uncovered sample (Fig.5 
and Fig.7). It is very important in preventing quenching of 
melted silver droplets (see below). 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
Melting of silver nanostructures at low temperature 
annealing has been reported in several studies [14,17,18]. In 
case of liquid silver, the spherical shape of nanoislands for 
sample T-304, can be explained by droplet formation on 
non-wettable surface due to cohesive forces. On other hand, 
the results of hot plate annealing demonstrate existing of 
temperature point at which shape of nanoislands is changed. 
With the help of additional hot plate samples it was found 
that the point of shape transformation is close to 245 C. The 
result of annealing at low temperature looks like 
nanostructures of sample HP220, the annealing at high 
temperature provides nanostructures similar to sample 
HP295. The close results were obtained in several studies 
reported about melting temperature of silver nanostructures 
in the interval of 250-300 C [17,18]. Therefore, we believe 
that during our experiments the silver films heated above 245 
C were melted, e.g., in samples with flats HP395 and T. 
Silver properties modification caused by melting leads to 
changing of reflection spectra after annealing. It has been 
already mentioned that areal density and average size of

nanoislands are close to each other in studied samples. 
However, redshift of dipolar resonance in melted samples is 
relatively large and cannot be only explained by changing of 
island geometry. Resonance wavelength shift can be 
provided by changing of dielectric environment or dielectric 
function of silver in melted samples. Due to identical 
environment in the studies samples, it can be concluded that 
spectrum variations are connected with dielectric function of 
silver. Moreover, from spectral peak and trough broadening 
follows that not only real, but imaginary part of silver 
dielectric function was changed. One of the possible 
explanations is increased defect concentration in melted 
samples, how it was reported earlier [19]. 
It cost to note that additionally to bulk melting (discussed 
above) in nanostructures exists also surface melting or pre-
melting. Pre-melting happens at lower temperature [17] and 
is responsible for shape variation between samples HP165 
and HP220. But surface melting is not connected with 
increasing of defect concentration in resulting nanoislands 
(Fig. 3b).  
Reflection 
spectra 
(Fig.3) 
demonstrate 
plasmon 
properties of silver nanostructres. The troughs in the range 
650 – 750 nm correspond to dipole plasmon resonance and 
peaks at 450 – 500 nm correspond to quadrupole resonance. 
The different appearance in the reflection is connected with 
different radiation patterns of dipole and quadrupole [13]. 
These resonances are valid for annealed samples. Non 
annealed samples possess very broad range of infrared 
radiation (see spectrum of as deposited sample). During 
annealing silver temperature is higher than temperature of 
the substrate due additional radiation heating [20-22]. After 
melting liquid silver nanoislands are divided in smaller ones 
due to Rayleigh instability [14]. Geometry change causes 
blueshift of plasmon resonance, observed in the measured 
spectra and interruption of infrared heating, because 
radiation with new resonance wavelength does not exist. The 
cold substrate (Fig. 4) cools down silver nanostructures and 
causes their solidification. Our estimation for 100 nm sphere 
gives transition time to thermal equilibration with substrate 
in the range of 10-8 s. So fast quenching happens without 
proper crystallization and generates defects in silver lattice. 
In case of tube annealing of protected samples melting 
happens at higher holder temperature. Depending on 
conductive and radiative heat fluxes the melted silver is 
cooled with much lower rate (sample T-Si) or does not 
solidify at all (sample T-304). For the hot plate annealing 
there is also quenching mechanism, despite of absence of 
radiation. Silver nanostructure is heated by substrate and 
cooled by nitrogen. In other words, there is heat flow from 
the substrate to ambient through nanostructure. This heat 
flow creates temperature drop on the interfacial thermal 
resistance between substrate and silver droplet, what in turn 
leads to decreasing of silver temperature and quenching. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS  
We have demonstrated the effect of thermal radiation on 
furnace annealing of thin silver films. Due to plasmon 
resonance in infrared, the radiation heating of silver films 
can be very strong and provides overheating of the silver 
nanostructures relatively substrate. This overheating is self-
limited owing to size dependence of resonance wavelength. 
After melting and fragmentation of silver nanostructures to 
smaller nanoislands, plasmon resonance is shifted to visible 
range and does not support any more heating of silver 
nanoislands. As a result, they are quenched to solid state with 
irregular shape and high defect concentration. The 
minimization of radiation heating supports nanostructures in 
liquid state after melting, providing spherical shape of 
nanoislands after solidification. This opens new approaches 
to fabrication of self-assembled silver nanostructures.
