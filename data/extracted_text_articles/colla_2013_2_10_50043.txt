 INTRODUCTION
There are around 160 Higher Educational Institutions in 
Taiwan for a population of 23 million; however, the birthrate 
is  the  lowest  in  the  world,  which  will  inevitably cause 
damage  to  Taiwanese  society,  economy,  and  education 
system [1]. As a result, students will find it increasingly 
difficult to graduate (higher tuition fee, more competition) 
and to be hired (higher unemployment, notably in the sector 
of education). Professional networking might be a way for 
students to develop their skills, their motivation, and to boost 
their  career  prospects.  However,  a rapid  search  on  the 
Internet  shows  that  a  surprisingly  small  number  of 
Taiwanese  teachers  and  students  have  their  profile  on 
LinkedIn, the world’s largest professional network. We have 
begun  a  study  aimed  not  only  at  analyzing  the  present 
situation, but also at encouraging students to connect in order 
to  improve  their  writing  and  communication  skills,  to 
increase their learning motivation, and to boost their chances 
on the job market. In that matter, so far, academic research 
on LinkedIn is scarce. However, this field of study is very 
promising in Taiwan and in other countries facing lowering 
student  enrollment,  higher  graduate  unemployment, 
credential  inflation,  and  even  department  or  university 
closure.
This  paper  presents  some  publications  related  to 
networking and to the  selected  evaluation method (Data 
Envelopment Analysis [1, 11, 12, 13, 15] and  Malmquist 
index [13, 19]) in the literature review. The next section 
presents the objectives, methodology, and data source. The 
discussion is preliminary and can only present the expected 
results as we are still in the process of collecting the data.

LITERATURE REVIEW
A.
Professional networking
Rosenfeld  defines  a  network  as  a  place  where  “the 
members choose each other, for a variety of reasons; they 
agree explicitly to co-operate in some way and to depend on 
each other to some extent.” [2]. 
In the first decade of the twenty-first century, hundreds 
of social and professional networks have been created online, 
with more or less success.  MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, and 
LinkedIn are obviously among the most famous. LinkedIn is 
a business-oriented social networking site founded at the end 
of 2002 and launched officially on May 5, 2003, that is, 
more than 10 years ago. Data about how many professionals 
are connected vary widely; LinkedIn reports more than 200 
million in more than 200 countries and territories (including 
74 millions in the US); the largest industries were at the 
beginning  of  2013  information  technology  and  services, 
financial services, higher education, and computer software 
[3].  Forbes  states  that  LinkedIn  is  nowadays  the  most 
advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers 
and business professionals [4]. 
Many articles in newspapers [5], books [6, 7, 8], and 
portals [9] focus on how to help students finding a job. But, 
very little has been published so far in academic journals 
about professional networking and how it can boost students’ 
career plan. A study published in 2009 [10] shows that on 
the  question  “How  beneficial  would  a  graduate-level 
professional networking course be to helping you improve 
your skills?” 34 % of the students interviewed answered 
“somewhat  beneficial”,  32%  “beneficial”,  18%  “very 
beneficial”,  and  8  %  “invaluable”.  Moreover,  thirty-one 
percent of elite professionals spend one to two hours each 
week networking. Clearly, it takes time to build connections 
and make friends. Professional networking is a long-term 
investment, but twenty-seven percent of respondents network 
only when there is an immediate need, such as when starting 
a job search [10].
B.
Data Envelopment Analysis and Malmquist index
We  are  now  in  the  process  of  collecting  the  data 
necessary  for  this  study.  He  expects  to  apply  Data 
Envelopment  Analysis  (DEA),  which  is  a  quantitative 
evaluation method that can evaluate the relative performance 
of units called Decision Making Units (DMUs). There is a 
large body of literature on application of DEA in various 
fields, including education [11, 12]. Various studies evaluate 
the performance of departments [13, 14], classes [15], or 
individual  students  [16].  We  have  demonstrated  the 
reliability  and  relevance  of  applying  DEA  in  various 
academics papers, such as [17][18].
Malmquist index, a bilateral index defined by Caves et al. 
[19], has notably been applied in the field of education [13].

This index can help measure and analyze the improvement in 
motivation and learning over a period of time, e.g., from the 
time students register on LinkedIn to the time they find a job. 
By combining DEA with Malmquist index, this study will 
show the evolution of students’ motivation, of their scores, 
and of their participation to LinkedIn from February to June 
2013. This study is a work in progress and more time is 
needed to collect, run, and analyze the data.

METHODOLOGY
A.
Research Issue
In  February  2013,  Maclean's  Magazine  in  Toronto 
published  an  article  stating  that  Higher  Educational 
Institutions do very little to help students plan for future 
careers [5]. Some students feel that teachers and universities 
don’t do enough to help them connect to the market place. 
Perhaps, in times of economic crisis, HEIs should offer more 
concrete career advice and help students post their profile on 
professional networks (as to February 2013, on more than 
11,000 students at our university, less than 10 had a profile 
on LinkedIn and few of the students interviewed so far had 
heard about the network). Nowadays, social and professional 
networks are a great and fast growing place where people 
can connect and boost their career prospects. Students are 
often  clueless  about  future  pay  and  job  prospects. 
Surprisingly,  they  know  little  about  how  to  build  their 
network and how recruiting works.
B.
Research objectives
This research explores a number of issues in relation to 
networking practices. The objectives of the research are as 
follows:
•
Observe the state and evolution of students’ motivation 
from the beginning to the end of the semester;
•
Ascertain the perceived understanding of networking by 
Taiwanese students;
•
Explore how students form, maintain and develop their 
network and
•
Follow  students  from  the  moment  they  register  on 
LinkedIn; see if they can ultimately find a job.
C.
Research methodology
The  research  methodology  for  this  study  is  both 
qualitative  and  quantitative.  At  the  beginning  of  the 
semester, students answer a questionnaire we have designed. 
This  questionnaire  includes  20  questions  concerning 
students’ knowledge about and participation to social and 
professional  networks.  Some  questions  are  related  to 
indicators  of  good  teaching.  Students  can  rank  which 
indicators they feel are the most important (such as fair 
grading,  being  supportive,  communication  skill,  teaching 
contents, etc.). The research methodology is also quantitative 
and DEA combined with Malmquist index will assess the 
progress  and  motivation  of  students  from  the  beginning 
(period 1) to the end of the semester (period 2). Some of the 
indicators include the number of connections and the number 
of  groups  students follow or create  on LinkedIn,  scores 
during the  semester  (notably evaluation  of  their  resume, 
portfolio, and profile), and students’ evaluation of teaching.
D.
The data source
The study case is a private church-sponsored university 
in  Taiwan.  Preliminary  data  consist  of  four  classes  of 
students  (sophomore  to  senior  students  from  various 
departments).  Later  on,  a  larger  number  of  classes  will 
participate to the study. We will follow students from the 
moment they register to LinkedIn to their first job offers.
IV.
PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Out of 11,000 students at our university, less than 10 had 
a profile on LinkedIn. As to March 2013, there were 81 
followers of the institution, mostly registered teachers, staff 
members, and students from the university. All included, 
only 73 people had registered, often with an empty profile; 
that  is,  no  picture,  no  information  about  education, 
experience, interests, and almost no connections.
We propose to define three steps in order to help students 
boost their career on LinkedIn:
1.
We register first and connect to a large number of 
universities, companies, and recruiting agencies around 
the world. We registered on LinkedIn on February 12, 
2013.  One  month  later,  he  had  more  than  350 
connections (more than 50 in Taiwan, same in Japan, 
27 in China, and many in the US, England, France, 
etc.), many recommendations and endorsements from 
colleagues. As to July 2013, we had 1370 connections 
and we were linked to 12 million people.
2.
We  help  students  register  and  create  their  profile 
(developing their writing and communication skills). 
We create a discussion group on LinkedIn including all 
the  students  registered  and  we  invite  teachers  and 
professionals to join. The group has been created in 
March 2013. It is called “The Student Connection”.
3.
We help students build connections according to their 
skills, interests, and career plan. The teacher can here 
recommend students and endorse their skills. One of 
the students has already 90 connections and many skills 
endorsed. We have accepted to recommend him.
A.
Some preliminary results
On 93 students who responded to a questionnaire at the 
beginning of March 2013:

23 had heard about LinkedIn.

80 thought about going online to look for a job.

91 had a Facebook account.

Only 13 used Twitter.

23 had penpals abroad.

24 ran a website.

25 were blogging.

62 thought  their teachers  were  helping students 
enough to connect to companies.
We additionally asked 26 students coming from various 
departments at a national university in Taiwan to fill the 
questionnaire. 100% of the respondents answered yes to the

question “Do you have a Facebook account?” Students enjoy 
social networking, but don’t consider it might help them find 
a job. Only 6 students had heard about LinkedIn (including 2 
who already had a profile) and only 5 were using Twitter.
B.
Discussion
In order for this research to become reliable, we will 
improve the questionnaire, interview thousands of students, 
and  analyze  the  data  by  using  SPSS,  DEA  model,  and 
Malmquist  index.  So  far,  the  number  of  students  who 
responded to the questionnaire is too small to draw reliable 
conclusions;  however,  some  trends  appear:  even  though 
almost  all  the  students  use  Facebook,  few  of  them  are 
connected to LinkedIn. Most students seem to be unaware of 
the fact that CEOs and recruiting agencies are now using 
LinkedIn to hire graduates. Only 10 out of 93 students who 
answered the questionnaire said they have a very good idea 
about what job they want to do after graduation.
This study expects to show that:
•
Student’s learning motivation will increase if they built 
a  professional  network  and  connect  with CEOs and 
recruiting agencies;
•
Students’ grades in English writing will improve by 
using the network and by communicating with people 
around the world in English;
•
Students’ connections will help them to have a better 
understanding of the current job market and of what 
employers are expecting from graduates (employability 
skills);
•
Undergraduate students will increase their chances to 
enter  a  graduate  school  in  Taiwan  or  abroad  by 
connecting to professors in their field of research;
•
Some students participating to this study will eventually 
find a job with the help of their connections.
This is obviously a preliminary research, and it appears 
that more time is needed to introduce LinkedIn to workers 
and students at the institution studied in this paper and to 
analyze the impact of having new members registered.
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Even though many university educators share their well-
designed profile on LinkedIn, they rarely invite their students 
to connect. Most students are clueless about how to make 
their profile and about what good can come out of joining the 
network. Out of 11,000 students at our university, less than 
10 had a profile on LinkedIn and almost none of the students 
interviewed so far had heard about it. In March 2013, around 
100  more  students  connected  and  learned  how  to  use 
LinkedIn in order not only to improve their English, but to 
boost their career prospects. From March 2013 on, we will 
follow and guide them and many other students to observe 
their progress in writing and communication skills, hoping 
for  the  best,  that  is,  job  offers.  Clearly,  there  is  little 
academic  research  done  on  LinkedIn  and  its  impact  on 
students’ motivation and career prospects. According to a 
recent  article  [20],  97  percent  of  recruiters  are  using 
LinkedIn to find new employees, while only 27 percent are 
using Twitter and just 22 percent turn to Facebook as a 
source for recruiting.
