Abstract—The technological development of the blockchain 
technology allows a new way of processing secured transactions 
and payments between different parties. Therefore, it is not 
surprising that new virtual currencies are developed to open 
new payment methods, as well as investment opportunities. To 
estimate the intention to buy and use cryptocurrencies, an 
empirical analysis was performed. The question of research is 
whether an investment in cryptocurrencies is primarily made 
for speculative reasons or because of a belief in the 
establishment of a digital currency. Although eight different 
cryptocurrencies are investigated, most respondents refer to 
Bitcoin as the one over all cryptocurrencies. The ordinary 
regression analyses on base of survey data, which was 
distributed online, outlines that the intention to use 
cryptocurrencies is mainly driven by investment purposes.

INTRODUCTION 
The following article is an expanded work presented on the 
CENTRIC conference [1]. 
Cryptocurrencies have achieved market capitalization of 
currently around 250 billion euros due to the strong growth 
in recent years [2]. On the one hand, investors see 
cryptocurrencies as an opportunity to reach high revenues 
accompanied with a specific (potentially high) risk, while on 
the other hand, researchers and experts see cryptocurrencies 
as opportunity to create a new known and general accepted 
currency and payment method [3][4]. Therefore, it will be 
analyzed what most private customers/users think about 
cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) and how 
cryptocurrencies are used. To estimate the described 
customer behavior, quantitative research using an online 
survey is applied. The resulting database will be analyzed 
using statistical techniques for data estimation and the 
statistical program Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
(SPSS), which targets on the estimation of results about the 
later described hypotheses.   
In this respect, the paper is structured as follows. In 
Section II, (a) cryptocurrencies, (b) blockchain, (c) digital 
versus traditional currencies, as well as (d) challenges will be 
described. Section III will include the used research model. 
Following this section, the methodology and the theoretical 
approach for carrying out the analysis, will be explained. In 
Section V, the results of the empirical analysis are presented. 
The paper concludes with a summary of the results in Section 
VI. 
II. 
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND 
The following background section covers the definition of 
the research objectives cryptocurrencies and blockchain as 
well as the used research and conceptual model as well as the 
challenges in the named research field.   
A. Cryptocurrencies 
Although the first ideas to develop a digital and 
anonymous currency date back to 1989 [5], the first virtual 
cryptocurrency was implemented in 2008 [6], when 
Nakamoto published an approach for an electronic payment 
system and a new currency "Bitcoin" based on blockchain 
technology [7]. This approach differed from earlier 
approaches in particular in that all transfers must be validated 
by the community. This validation was performed decentral 
using a synchronized blockchain across multiple users [8]. To 
this extent, no third party is required as an intermediary to 
carry out secured transaction. This means that the currency 
Bitcoin was created primarily with the intention that 
transmissions can be cryptographically secured and tracked 
[6][9]. In addition, cryptocurrencies based on blockchain 
technology are implemented to (a) guarantee fast worldwide 
money transfers, (b) establish the privacy of the participating 
parties through anonymity, and (c) advance the development 
of a payment system independent of the traditional banking 
system [4]. 
B. Blockchain 
Following Nakamoto [6], a blockchain is a continuously 
expandable list of data records, called "blocks", which are 
linked together by cryptographic methods. Each block 
typically contains a cryptographically secure hash of the 
previous block, a timestamp and transaction data [10]-[12]. 
The blockchain allows the linking of transfers within a 
decentralized platform, which is distributed and publicly 
assessable [13][14], where through recording of transfers, 
processes and information are secured by cryptographic 
techniques [11][15][16]. The fact that a large number of users 
of the blockchain can access and track the linked blocks 
within the blockchain creates confidence in the reliability of 
the 
digitally 
applied 
processes 
and 
transfers

[8][11][12][14][16]. Finally, blockchain provides a solution 
for a trusted, secure, decentralized and (by consensus) peer-
validated approach [17]. In general, the entire database is 
embedded in a peer-to-peer network architecture with equal 
nodes. Due to the node principle, the system is not dependent 
on a central location, which could be a single point of failure 
[4]. 
Since, the information and data are implemented in the 
blockchain, 
which 
is 
decentralized 
distributed, 
no 
information can get lost [14]. Any implemented block is 
irreversibly linked to a previously block and cannot be 
deleted. Each block contains information about transactions 
and information of the previous block [6]. A new block is 
only added in case the verification through the validation and 
consensus process by the community is done [18]. Any 
update needs to be performed in a new developed block, 
which needs to be verified by the described process [19]. 
The application of blockchains guarantees a technically 
secure communication on the base of mutual authentication, 
as well as tamper-resistant asymmetric cryptography, which 
enables an information exchange by timestamped and logged 
records [8][13][20][21][22][23]. The blockchain approach 
implies the irrevocability of changes, i.e., the blocks or 
information remain permanently in the system and cannot 
simply be deleted [8][19]. The security mechanisms are 
implemented to avoid any spam and denial-of-service attacks 
[24]. 
The interaction of users within the blockchain takes place 
by using a related key pair, which comprises a private key 
and a public key [25]. The latter is publicly visible and 
comparable to an address that each node has; it can be 
regenerated for each transaction in order to maintain 
anonymity. If a node wants to create a transaction and, e.g., 
add new data, this can be done anytime autonomous by 
signing it with its (secret) private key [26]. It is then sent to 
all nodes of the peer-to-peer network to reduce single point 
of failures [16]. Each node is then able to use the public key 
to verify the node that created the transaction before a 
distributed consensus mechanism regulates the addition of 
the new 
block [27][28]. A consensus mechanism 
implemented through the Distributed Ledger Technology 
ensures that there is only one next block, which is necessary 
to obtain integrity of the blockchain [16][27][29]. This means 
that the consensus mechanism ensures that the transactions 
and blocks are sorted chronologically, which verifies the 
integrity, coherence and consistency of the blocks sustaining 
in the blockchain [8][16][20]. 
A subsequent update process ensures that all participants 
always have the latest version of the database at their disposal 
[30]. There are several methods for validating the transaction 
and reach consensus. The most common of which are 
currently known as 'Proof of Work' and 'Proof of Stake'. In 
these two methods, hash values are generated by the network 
nodes according to a certain pattern. Depending on the length 
of the blockchain, the degree of difficulty and the computing 
power required for this increase. In this context, the working 
nodes are also referred to as 'miners' [28]. The type of the 
utilized consensus mechanism varies in dependency from the 
type of network and other factors [26]. In summary, when a 
transaction is validated, it is stored in the block and chained 
in the blockchain [16], with the community deciding on the 
validation. I.e., this validation could only be manipulated by 
someone who has control over the majority (> 50%) of nodes, 
which is extremely unlikely due to the worldwide 
decentralized networks [8]. The timestamp documents 
(transparently for the whole network) the time of 
implementation and adjustments [31]. 
C. Digital versus Traditional Currencies 
The main differences between traditional and digital 
currencies are: (a) The digital currencies are organized 
decentral using block-chain technology and do not require 
banks or other intermediaries (unlike traditional currencies). 
(b) The digital currencies are (uniformly) valid and available 
worldwide [32], while the traditional currencies are generally 
specific to individual states or economic areas [33]. The use 
of traditional currencies (especially for international 
transactions) results in relatively high transaction costs, 
whereas digital currencies cause no or only very low 
transaction costs due to the consensus mechanism and the 
very fast "automatic" validation of transactions [4][32][34]. 
(c) Digital currencies offer a high degree of anonymity and 
protection of personal data, which is not provided by 
traditional currencies (e.g., credit card payments or money 
transfers). In traditional currencies, this anonymity could 
only be achieved through cash payments, but the transaction 
costs are extremely high. In addition, cash payments are 
strongly limited or regulated in many countries. 
Another central feature of a currency is that it is always 
available, transportable, and divisible. This is also true for 
cryptocurrencies [35]. 
In 
contrast 
to 
the 
traditional 
currencies, 
each 
cryptocurrency has a fixed limit regarding the maximum 
currency units that can be issued [35].  
D. Challenges 
Due to this "gap" regarding the legal and regulatory 
framework, there are potential uncertainties regarding the 
clarification of possible conflicts between trading partners 
[11][36]. 
In particular, the 'Proof of Work' mechanism causes 
extremely high-energy consumption, which is a factor of 
several thousand higher than traditional financial transactions 
[37]. 
For a long-term success, a digital currency (using 
blockchain technology) must achieve the acceptance of the 
majority of the population. After all, the long-term 
importance of the digital currency ultimately depends on the 
number of actual users and the acceptance as a payment 
system by the trade [38].

III. 
RESEARCH MODEL – ADJUSTED MODEL WITH 
ELEMENTS OF THE UNIFIED THEORY OF ACCEPTANCE AND 
USE OF TECHNOLOGY 2 
 
In this section, the used research model will be described. 
The focus in this research paper will be on the relationships 
between (a) the risks of cryptocurrencies and the intention to 
use 
cryptocurrencies, 
(b) 
the 
experiences 
with 
cryptocurrencies and the intention to use cryptocurrencies, 
and (c) the general experiences with investments and the 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. The analysis of the named 
research concepts follows the Unified Theory of Acceptance 
and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), which developed by 
Venkatesh, Thong, and Xin [39]. The UTAUT2 expands the 
existing UTAUT by the additional elements of hedonic 
motivation, price, and habit/experience, which allows a 
broader consideration of critical influence factors on the user 
behavior and the behavioral intention to use [39]-[41]. 
For this reason, to estimate these and further relations, an 
adjusted approach of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and 
Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) will be used, which is 
displayed in the conceptual model in Figure 1. 
In principle, it can be assumed that higher returns or 
expected returns are generally associated with a higher 
investment risk. In this respect, it is necessary to examine 
how much risk they are prepared to take in order to achieve 
high returns. It can be assumed that investors who have more 
experience with investments and who have often made these 
via digital channels (e.g., online banking) are generally more 
open to the use of cryptocurrencies. 
Finally, it should be noted that so far there has been no 
scientific review of the relationship between (a) performance 
expectations, (b) experience, (c) perceived risk and 
behavioral intention to use cryptocurrencies. The variable of 
perceived risk is treated as external variable in the further 
analysis. Additionally, the strength of perceived risk and 
experience will be estimated by linking these variables with 
the performance expectancy. The performance of the 
investments in digital currencies is rated by the performance 
expectancy. 
Problematically, (a) the expected performance, (b) 
experience, and (c) perceptions of risks differ between the 
individual customers [42]. This means, the user attitudes and 
beliefs are completely subjective [42]. The experience comes 
from the fact that users become more and more familiar with 
a technology or service after it has been used for the first time. 
[40][43][44]. With the increasing use of a technology or a 
service, the user gains more and more experience and 
knowledge and learns with it, whereby the use becomes more 
and more self-evident and "automatic" [45].  
Since habits and experiences allow predictions to be made 
for later use, it can be predicted that experience positively 
influences the utilization of cryptocurrencies. 
In principle, the existing risks influenced the uses and 
investment behavior of customers [46]. This is particularly 
reflected in the fact that the risk has a significant influence on 
customer acceptance of innovations (e.g., mobile payment, 
mobile banking, and mobile shopping) [47]-[52].  
Previous research identified that the perceived risk is one 
of the key drivers for the estimation of uncertainties in mobile 
payments, mobile shopping, mobile banking, and mobile 
transactions [47][49]-[53], because customers fear a lack of 
control.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Conceptual Model 
 
Consequently, the literature conveys the feedback that in 
several cases risks and uncertainties influence the customer 
user behavior. 
Based on the explanations, the hypotheses for this research 
paper are: 
H1: The customer perception of performance expectancy 
of investments (including digital currencies) has a directly 
positive effect on the intention to use cryptocurrencies. 
H2: Customers' experience with investments (including 
digital currencies) has a direct positive impact on their 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. 
H3: If customers are generally affine to risk when making 
investments, this has a direct positive effect on the intention 
to use cryptocurrencies. 
IV. 
METHODOLOGY 
In this section, the approach for the verification of the 
hypotheses will be shortly introduced. Therefore, to test the 
hypotheses, an online survey was carried out to obtain 
information on the investment behavior of private 
individuals. In particular, the survey covered the perception 
of users regarding cryptocurrencies and the resulting 
investment behavior. The focus here is on the perceived 
performance of digital currencies and investments made. 
To achieve the needed user information, a cross-sectional 
online survey (“one-shot survey”) had been prepared and 
distributed through multipliers in social media platforms 
[54]. 
As this is an online survey, it cannot be guaranteed (as 
opposed to a personal survey) that most respondents will fully 
answer the questions. In addition, the questionnaire was 
designed in such a way that individual questions could not be 
skipped without ending the survey. In this respect, a relatively 
large number of participants prematurely terminated their

responses to the questionnaire. The survey was distributed 
during the period from May to June 2018. In this period, 155 
people have opened and started the questionnaire. However, 
only 62% (96 out of 155) respondents have finished the 
questionnaire. For this reason, the sample of the whole 
analysis will be the data set covering the 96 respondents, 
which have fully completed the questionnaire. 
In the first part, the demographic information (such as age, 
gender and educational level) of the respondents was 
collected. In the following part the previous investment 
behavior and the knowledge of the participants about 
cryptocurrencies was determined. It should be determined 
whether the respondents know cryptocurrencies and whether 
they 
have 
already 
made 
investments 
based 
on 
cryptocurrencies. A positive answer (= experience with 
cryptocurrencies) was used to determine in more detail how 
many transactions, how much with which cryptocurrency the 
participants have already carried out. Since the third part is in 
higher importance for the later data analysis, all the 
implemented questions were coded in the 5-Point-Likert-
scale format [55]. The third part covers especially questions 
regarding 
the 
respondent 
investment 
intentions 
in 
cryptocurrencies. In addition, the risk appetite and expected 
return (5-Point-Likert-scale: high to low) are important 
information in this part. The subsequent fourth part of the 
questionnaire considers questions regarding the user 
perception about the course of the cryptocurrency 
investment. As in the part before, the questions are coded in 
5-Point-Likert-scale format (very likely to very unlikely). In 
the last part of the questionnaires, the respondents were 
queried about the future of cryptocurrencies in general. 
The collected data were analyzed using quantitative 
research methods and the SPSS statistical program. To 
examine the reliability and validity of the data, the estimation 
of the Cronbach’s Alpha and the Exploratory Factor Analysis 
were performed. 
Only the eight largest cryptocurrencies (measured by 
market capitalization) were taken into account. 
As mentioned above, the used approach only contains 
elements of the UTAUT2. Therefore, the evaluation is not 
done by structural equation modeling [39]. Instead, an 
ordinary least squares regression to test the significance of 
each hypothesis is used. In the final hypothesis, all the 
previous considered single variables, like (a) perceived 
performance, (b) experience, (c) risk appetite, (d) investment 
and speculation type, (e) regulations, and (f) assessment of 
the acceptance as alternative payment method will be related 
to the undertaking of investments in cryptocurrencies. 
 
V. 
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  
 
Following the described approach in conducting the 
survey, the outcomes for the estimation of the hypotheses will 
be deeply illustrated.  
A. The Difference of Cryptocurrency Applications 
Before going in-depth to the analysis of the questionnaire, 
one aspect is necessary to remind. Although most of the 
cryptocurrencies base on the blockchain and the wallets of 
the customers are numeric codes in general, cryptocurrencies 
are introduced for different purposes. Therefore, e.g., Bitcoin 
is implemented for solving financial transactions, whereas 
e.g., Ethereum is commonly used for establishing smart 
contracts. From this point of view, it would be preferable in 
differentiating the outcomes in relation to their purpose.  
Despite the descriptive results as well as mean 
considerations will indicate some outcomes differentiated on 
the respective cryptocurrencies. Most respondents refer to 
Bitcoin as the one over all cryptocurrencies. In this regard, 
the outcome is possibly kind of biased. Although further 
investigations would be preferable, the low number of 
respondents investing in other cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin 
and Ethereum does not allow a representative result. 
Therefore, a greater statistical differentiation cannot be 
pursued.     
B. Descriptive Results 
In the following, the descriptive results of the performed 
survey will be introduced. 53.1% of the respondents are male 
and the average age of a respondent is between 25 and 29 
years.  
With 41.7% respectively 24.0%, the group of the 18 to 24 
years respectively 25 to 29-year-old persons have the largest 
proportions of respondents within the survey (see Figure 2). 
On the base that the age group of the 20- to 29-year-old 
persons has only a 12.2% share of the total population in 
Germany, it must be noted that the young persons below the 
age of 30 years old are overrepresented in the survey by a 
factor of approx. five [56]. Since cryptocurrencies are virtual 
goods, their use requires a high Internet affinity. Based on a 
study of ARD/ZDF from 2015 the age group of the 20 to 29-
year-old persons does nearly complete use the internet [57].

have, the previously established overrepresentation of 
younger age groups is not surprising. With regard to the age, 
the survey is not representative for the total population of 
Germany.  
Considering the educational background in Figure 3, 
nearly the half of the respondents (46.9%) state that the 
school leaving examination is the education degree what they 
have. A quarter of the respondents have completed the Master 
degree (25%) from university. 
 
Figure 3. Distribution of Graduation 
 
The average net household income of the respondents is 
between 1,000 and 1,999 euros per month, with most of the 
participants (36.3%) having a net (household) income of less 
than 500 euros per month. In addition, almost three quarters 
(73.8%) have a net (household) income of less than 2,000 
euros. In connection with the level of education and age, it 
can be assumed that the interviewees are predominantly 
students. 
90.6% (= 87/96) of the respondents know what 
cryptocurrencies are. These 87 persons are the basic 
population (= 100%) for questions about cryptocurrencies. 
47.9% (= 46/96) of the respondents have already made 
financial investments. However, only 35.4% (34 of 96 
respondents) have already done investments in or with 
cryptocurrencies. From this point of view, the 34 respondents 
will be the basic population (= 100%) for all questions 
regarding the investment behavior with cryptocurrencies, 
especially number of transactions, amount of invested 
financial 
resources 
and 
perceptions 
regarding 
the 
development of the invested portfolio. 
Firstly, the descriptive results for the respondents, who 
know cryptocurrencies (=87), will be illustrated. In general, 
all the respondents know Bitcoin as cryptocurrency, whereas 
two thirds of the respondents answer to know BitcoinCash 
and Ethereum, which can be seen in Table I. 
Although 36.9% of the respondents are very risk-affine 
with regard to investments, only 23.4% of the respondents 
describe themselves as speculators. Contrary, 39.3% of the 
respondents answer to have a risk-shy nature, which can be 
also seen in estimation that 37.8% of the respondents estimate 
to be arbitragers. By regarding the estimation of returns, only 
21.7% of the respondents think to get low returns. Although 
it is well known that higher returns can only be achieved with 
higher risks, some of the respondents who are risk-averse 
hope for medium to high returns. 
 
TABLE I. DEGREE OF AWARENESS OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES 
 
Interestingly, 87.8% of respondents think that the new 
cryptocurrencies have been brought to life to drive a new 
form of speculation and investment. This is underlined by the 
fact that only 22.9% of respondents see Bitcoin as an 
alternative payment method to credit cards and the like. 
43.4% of respondents involved in investment argue for 
regulatory intervention or restrictions in the cryptocurrency 
market, while 32.5% reject it. 
Now, the results of the respondents using cryptocurrencies 
are shown. As already mentioned, however, the sample size 
is very small with 34 respondents, which is why the results 
cannot be generalized. 
Figure 4 shows the distribution of the investment in the 
eight most important cryptocurrencies. 83.0% of respondents 
have already invested in Bitcoin. In addition to Bitcoin, the 
currency Ethereum seems to be of particular interest to 
investors.  
48.5% of the respondents have invested at least 2,000 Euro 
in cryptocurrencies. 67.6% of these investors state that they 
make a profit by investing in cryptocurrencies. However, 
51.4% of the investors have only short-time experience with 
cryptocurrencies since they invest in them for the last 2 years. 
Cryptocurrencies have become much more popular, 
especially in recent years. It is therefore not surprising that 
many investors have only recently started to invest in and 
trade with cryptocurrencies. Due to this short experience time 
horizon, most investors have an extremely limited ability to 
assess the long-term performance of cryptocurrencies and the 
risk of an investment. In this respect, one would normally 
expect investors to be generally extremely cautious and 
careful in assessing the development and returns of 
cryptocurrency investments.  
 However, the results of the questionnaire, illustrated in 
Figure 5, show that investors have a vastly different 
assessment of the performance of their currency investments 
for each cryptocurrency. 
Most of the investors (82%) assumes that a total loss of the 
investment does not occur. Contrary, over the half of the 
investors assumes to gain profits (in 6 months: 55%; in 12

months: 71%). Considering, the probability to get a loss in 
the investments, 58% of the investors estimate this as 
unlikely within the next 12 months. 
     Interestingly, in case investors decide to invest in 
cryptocurrencies, they take a couple of cryptocurrencies. No 
one of the investors takes only one cryptocurrency. 54.5% of 
the investors invest in more than 5 different cryptocurrencies. 
Diversification of financial resources across different 
investments indicates hedging, if one cryptocurrency fails, 
other cryptocurrencies can compensate for the loss. Such 
investor behavior is typical for brokers who trade in different 
financial securities to make profits. It can therefore be 
assumed that cryptocurrencies are bought more as a tool to 
make (speculative) profits than as an alternative means of 
payment or as a tool to improve trading or production 
processes. 
 
 
Figure 4. Investments in Cryptocurrencies 
Figure 5. Expectations regard to the Cryptocurrency Investment 
 
Figure 6 shows the objectives of the investments. In 
general, most investors in cryptocurrencies believe in long-
term increases in value. In comparison to the overall group of 
respondents knowing and using cryptocurrencies, the users of 
cryptocurrencies believe in a higher degree that Bitcoin could 
develop to an alternative currency and payment method. 
In general, over 50% of the investors have a long-term 
direction by investing in cryptocurrencies. In this respect, the 
investment in these currencies usually takes place with a 
longer time horizon (of several years). 
 
Figure 6. Purpose in Cryptocurrencies 
 
Overall, 
the 
investment 
atmosphere 
regarding 
cryptocurrencies is quite positively. Investors perceive high 
profits by doing the investments and see only minor risks of 
a loss of their investments. 
 
C. Reliability and Validity 
The results of the reliability and validity analyses are 
illustrated in Tables II and III. In general, this study includes 
the following 7 concepts: (1) performance expectancy, (2) 
experience, (3) perceived risk, (4) intention to use 
cryptocurrencies, 
(5) 
purposes 
of 
investments 
in 
cryptocurrencies, (6) usage of cryptocurrencies, and (7) 
prominence of cryptocurrencies. 
 
TABLE II. RELIABILITY ANALYSIS 
 
Generally, all named concepts are examined in the terms 
of reliability and validity. Following Cronbach, Alpha values 
must be higher than 0.7/0.6 to for a good/sufficient reliability 
[58]-[60]. Based on the results in Table II, the collected data 
for 5 of the 7 named aspects are at least sufficiently reliable. 
Solely, the concepts of performance expectancy and 
experience seem to be completely not reliable. 
After the testing of the reliability, the exploratory factor 
analysis includes the assessment of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin 
criterion (KMO), the significance test from Bartlett, and the 
examination of the cumulative variance to evaluate the

validity of the collected data [61]-[65]. Validity considers the 
consistency of an empirical measurement with the based 
conceptual/logical measurement concept. To reach a good 
validity, the concepts should reach significant p values 
(p<0.05) in the Bartlett-Test and KMO values above 0.7 (at 
least higher than 0.5) [61]-[65].  
Table III shows a sufficient validity for 6 of the 7 concepts. 
The validity scores are also supported by the results of the 
cumulative variances higher than 50% except the concept of 
experience.

Despite the mark of 50% is not completely achieved, the 
explanatory rates of the variances can be rated as sufficiently 
high [62]-[64]. Consequently, the reliability and validity of 
the collected data are proved. 
D. Mean Analysis 
Before the relations between the different concepts will be 
illustrated in-depth, several mean analyses should give an 
insight if specific characteristics have an impact on the 
knowledge about cryptocurrencies as well as on the risk 
assessment and the development of the investment.  
Here, the Analysis of Variances (ANOVA) figures out if 
there are differences in means between the different groups 
of a variable (mostly the two specifications of a binary-coded 
variable) are considered. A difference in means gives a direct 
suggestion that possibly variables have an impact in changing 
the variable significantly. In more simplified words, the 
ANOVA-test reveals in a first stage, if possible, variables 
relate to the investigated variable. By performing the 
ANOVA, the F-Test needs to be greater than 3.90 to 
determine a significant difference in means [64]. 
Table IV indicates the differences in means in gender 
regarding the eight mostly used cryptocurrencies. Most 
importantly, the prominence is coded in a 3-point-scale with 
one for unknown, two for heard but unknown about the use, 
and three for known and trusted in the use. Considering the 
following Tables IV, V and VI, the ANOVA-tests identify 
significant differences in means between the two regarded 
groups. Since all F-values are above 3.90, it must be 
concluded that female and male respondents have different 
knowledge on average.

investors in the knowledge about the eight most common 
cryptocurrencies. 
In Table IV, we see that for the eight cryptocurrencies, 
male respondents on average have greater knowledge 
regarding cryptocurrency investments. Bitcoin is the most 
well-known 
cryptocurrency, 
while 
male 
respondents 
generally have at least a general idea about the other 
currencies. In contrast, female respondents hardly know any 
cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Table V shows that 
respondents who invest more frequently (regardless of which 
areas) are on average knowledgeable about the eight 
cryptocurrencies.

In particular, investors are generally familiar with Bitcoin 
and Ethereum. Conversely, people who do not invest 
regularly are, on average, unfamiliar with most of the eight 
cryptocurrencies surveyed. Only Bitcoin reach a greater 
prominence. Comparing these results with the responses of 
investors who regularly invest in in cryptocurrencies (see 
Table VI), the results are almost the same. 
Based on the further tables, the mean analysis should 
distinguish between the risk and return expectation regarding 
cryptocurrencies. Besides the risk type, which is coded with 
3-point-Likert-scale (1 = arbitrager to 3 = speculator), the 
other questions are coded in a 5-point-Likert-scale manner. 
For the risk and return expectation, the 1 stands for a low-
level-expectation, whereas the 5 means a high-level 
expectation. For the other variables, the 5-point-Likert-scale 
is going from do not agree (1) to agree (5).

Considering Table VII, the ANOVA-test identifies that 
regarding the risk expectations, the estimations between male 
and female respondents differ significantly. For the three 
questions to risk appetite, expected return, and risk type, the 
F-scores exceed the mark of 3.90.  
In average, the female respondents answer that they take a 
lower risk if they are doing investments, especially 
cryptocurrency investments. In this regard, the female 
respondents seem to be risk-averse, whereas the male 
respondents seem to be risk neutral. Considering the risk 
taken, male respondents on average expect a medium-high 
return, whereas the return expectation of female respondents 
seems to be lower.  
Despite 
the 
differences 
regarding 
the risk/return 
expectation, in average, independent from the gender, the 
respondents report that they see cryptocurrencies just for 
speculation perspectives. Regarding a possible regulation, the 
respondents do not give sophisticated feedback, independent 
from the gender. Accordingly, most respondents (of both 
genders equally) do not see Bitcoin as an alternative payment 
method. These results are supported by the ANOVA, as for 
the three questions a (weakly) significant difference in the 
means can only be seen for the question about Bitcoin as a 
means of payment. For the other two variables, the F-scores 
do not exceed 3.90, indicating that female and male 
respondents do not answer differently.

In the following, Table VIII displays that the F-values are 
only above of the value 3.90 and significant for the relation 
of the general investment behavior and the risk expectations. 
Regarding the other parameters in Table VIII, they do not 
reach a F-value greater than 3.90. 
Here, the outcomes of the general investment behaviors 
regarding the named expectations, do not change. This 
means, people, who invest in general, they anticipate a 
greater risk in doing that in comparison to people, who do not 
invest. However, in comparison with gender perspective, the 
differences between investors and non-investors are not 
heavily. Regarding the risk type and the risk appetite, in 
average both groups seem to be risk neutral.  
With Table IX, the cryptocurrency investment behavior is 
considered regarding the difference in means of the already 
named expectations. Since the cryptocurrency investment 
field is a specific part of the general investment, it could be 
assumed that the general results are not mainly different. The 
outcomes show that the F-Scores of the risk expectations 
even exceed the previous consideration. As a result, the risk 
expectations are more resilient than in the consideration of 
the general investment behavior. Following this point, 
investors in cryptocurrencies believe in a greater risk. As the 
general group, the investment in cryptocurrencies does not 
trigger the opinion about any regulatory or governmental 
intervention.  
However, overviewing the results of Table VII and Table 
IX, the outcomes for the questions regarding the usage of 
Bitcoin as payment method as well as the usage of 
cryptocurrencies for speculation purposes are differently. 
Table IX shows an F-value of 5.046 (and thus greater than 
3.90) for the use of Bitcoin as a means of payment. Compared 
to the overall group of all investors, the cryptocurrency 
investor group is more open to using Bitcoin as an investment 
option on a larger scale. Cryptocurrency investors have a 
neutral position regarding the use of Bitcoin as a means of 
payment, while non-cryptocurrency investors (who are 
invested in other asset classes) tend to reject the use of 
Bitcoin as a means of payment on average. However, the 
group of cryptocurrency investors does not exclusively 
believe that crypto investments are made only for speculative 
purposes. In contrast, people who do not invest in 
cryptocurrencies (but invest in other asset classes) believe 
that cryptocurrencies are only made for speculative purposes.   
Above of Table IX, Tables X and XI go in-depth of the 
cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum in relation to the risk 
expectations. The outcomes of the performed ANOVA-tests 
indicate differences in means whether the respondents invest 
in Bitcoin or Ethereum.  
Though, in comparison to the previous explanations, the 
ANOVA-tests identify that a difference in means between 
investors and non-investors of Bitcoin and Ethereum have not 
different expectations regarding risk and return of 
cryptocurrencies. All the F-tests are insignificantly, which 
identifies that averagely both considered groups decide 
similar in the questions. Since averagely there are no 
differences in the expectations, the in-depth consideration of 
Bitcoin and Ethereum does not add a new information.

Considering Tables XII and Table XIII, the relation 
between the investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum are related 
to the return development as well as the belief in 
cryptocurrencies. In average, an investment or non-
investment in Bitcoin does not lead to a different value 
expectation of the investment. In addition, investors or non-
investors 
do 
not 
anticipate 
differently 
regarding 
cryptocurrencies. For Bitcoin investment in all cases the F-
scores are below the mark of 3.90. For this reason, all the 
ANOVA analyses are insignificantly and a difference in 
means regarding the single variables and the investment in 
Bitcoin can be excluded.  
Reviewing the investors in Ethereum in relation to the 
return expectations, it can be mainly determined that also the 
most ANOVA-tests have F-scores below the mark of 3.90. 
This means, the F-Tests are insignificantly. For this reason, 
there is no difference in means between the investors and 
non-investors regarding the different variables. However, in 
comparison to the investors in Bitcoin, one expectation 
indicates a significant F-test. Regarding the variable, a 
promising high rate of return, the F-score exceeds the mark 
of 3.90. On this account, there is a difference in means 
between the investors and non-investors in Ethereum. The 
variation is that non-investors have a neutral expectation 
regarding a promising high rate of return of Ethereum 
investments. Oppositely, averagely investors in Ethereum 
believe in a high rate of return.

Although the outcomes have mainly no difference in 
means, it must be concluded that the investors in 
cryptocurrencies expect in general a long-term store of value 
by doing cryptoinvestments. Considering the beliefs in the 
cryptocurrencies as well as the short-term store of value, the 
investors in cryptocurrencies have generally a neutral 
attitude. 
Concluding the ANOVA-tests by considering, how the 
investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum averagely estimate how 
their investments will develop in the upcoming year. Before 
going in the estimations of the average responses, it needs to 
be underlined that the investors of cryptocurrencies 
(independently if Bitcoin, Ethereum or something else), the 
investors do not anticipate a total loss of their investments. 
Furthermore, they more likely expect a rise of their 
investments.

This is also underlined in Tables XIV and XV with the 
positive estimation about an uptick of the cryptocurrency 
investment. Furthermore, investors in cryptocurrencies do 
not averagely expect a downtick of the investment within an 
investment period of 12 months. Interestingly, investors, who 
do not invest in cryptocurrencies but in other kinds of

investments, see cryptocurrency investments more critically 
and averagely expect a downtick of an investment in Bitcoin 
or Ethereum. In general, it can be expected that investors 
expect a greater risk in doing cryptocurrency investments. 
Oppositely, the non-investors in cryptocurrencies have a 
more positive opinion about the return progression of the 
cryptocurrency investments.

However, looking for the F-test, it must be stated that the 
ANOVA-analysis does not figure out a difference in means 
in the relation between the return progression and the 
investment in Ethereum. All the outcomes in Table XV do 
not reach a F-value greater than 3.90. The F-tests are 
insignificantly and there is not a difference in means in the 
expectations about the development of Ethereum between the 
investors and non-investors in Ethereum. 
Considering the ANOVA for the relation between the 
investment in Bitcoin and the return expectation within the 
following 12 months. In general, three of five F-tests also 
identify values below the mark of 3.90, which are 
insignificantly and do not figure out a difference in means. 
However, regarding an uptick of Bitcoin within the next six 
months as well as a downtick in the next twelve months, the 
F-tests reach scores about the mark of 3.90. For these two 
questions, the investors and non-investors in Bitcoin have 
averagely a different expectation about the return 
development.  
Interestingly, for the uptick within the six months, the non-
investors in Bitcoin have a more positive expectation about 
the Bitcoin development than the investors in Bitcoin. 
Oppositely, within twelve months, the investors in Bitcoin 
reject a possible expectation about a downtick of the 
development, whereas the non-investors think about that 
averagely it would be likely that the Bitcoin investment gets 
a downtick.  
E. Correlation Analysis 
The correlation analysis measures the degree of the 
relationship between two individual variables. It is not, 
however, the degree of the linear proportionality. A 
correlation of 1.000 shows a ‘perfect’ relationship. A 
correlation coefficient higher than 0.500 is classified as a 
good correlation. Below 0.300, the correlation coefficients 
are weak [66][67]. 
The first correlation analyses build the pre step for the 
further investigations. For this reason, the correlations will be 
considered between the intent to use investment (to be an 
investor) and the variables considering the return and risk.

Based on the results in Table XVI, a positive significant 
relationship can be found between the general investment 
behavior as well as the risk taken and the expected return. 
Investors make investments to generate profits or to increase 
their financial resources. Therefore, the correlation with the 
expected return can be comprehended. Considering the 

12

relation to the risk expectation, it can be followed those 
investors, who already have decided to invest, anticipate the 
possible risk they have to face.

This means, investors are normally aware that they that 
they do not gain a financial profit or could lose their 
investments. Otherwise, non-investors, who reject to invest, 
are normally not willing to take the risks to possibly lose the 
financial resources. When investing, it must be clear that a 
loss as well as a possible is possible. 
Table XVII shows the variables that have a significant 
correlation with the intention to use cryptocurrencies. In 
addition to the values shown in Table XVII: (a) There are 
positive significant correlations for all variables of perceived 
risk 
and 
experience 
with 
the 
intention 
of 
using 
cryptocurrencies. (b) From the concept of performance 
expectancy, the variable of the expectation regarding the total 
loss of an investment in cryptocurrencies correlates 
negatively 
significant 
with 
the 
intention 
to 
use 
cryptocurrencies. The negative correlation identifies that the 
investors in cryptocurrencies do not expect a total loss of their 
taken investments. This result corresponds with the positive 
correlations between the intention to use cryptocurrencies 
and the rate of return. On this account, users of 
cryptocurrencies expect to get a positive return from their 
investment.  
Finally, in Tables XVIII and XIX, it can be remarked that 
the outcomes of the mean analyses can be supported. For this 
reason, the negative correlations for the investment in Bitcoin 
and the development of the investment identify those 
investors, who do not invest in Bitcoin, have a better 
expectation about the Bitcoin development than the actual 
investors. Oppositely, investors in Bitcoin do not expect a 
reduction of the invested financial resources in the Bitcoin 
investment. Although they are more carefully in the 
expectation regarding a positive development of the 
investment in the short run, in the long run, the investors do 
not expect a loss of financial resources within the investment.   
F. Regression Analyses 
As introduced earlier, the regression analysis will be 
performed on the method of an ordinary least squares 
regression. The intension is to verify if the dependent variable 
behavioral intention to use cryptocurrencies is affected by the 
developed three concepts of independent variables [67]. In 
this regard, it will be examined, in which degree the predictor 
variables can explain the generated values of the dependent 
variable [68]. 
In the application of the regression analysis, four major 
indicators need to be considered. Firstly, the r-square will be 
determined to quantify the explanatory power of the whole 
regression model. The r-square is the share of the dependent 
variable, which can be explained by the independent 
variables. Following Chin and Cohen, the value should be at 
least 33% [69][70]. 
Secondly, the analysis of the variances (ANOVA) needs to 
verify the model fit. The resulting values should be 
significant (p<0.05) and higher than 3 in order to evaluate the 
model as good, which is the case here. 
Thirdly, the regression coefficients of the independent 
variables need to be significant (p<0.05). In particular, the 
identified estimators must match the expectations in the 
research hypotheses. Fourthly, the test of multicollinearities 
by the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) needs to be performed 
to find out, whether the variables included in the regression 
analyses have an identical relation. In the case of existing 
multicollinearities, i.e., if the VIF values exceed 10 (or in a 
stricter definition 3), the outcomes of the regression analysis 
are biased [61][71][72].

In performing the regression analysis, the relation between 
the variables of perceived risk and the intention to use 
cryptocurrencies are investigated (see Table XX). In general, 
the r-square achieves a score of 35.2%. Since this value is 

13
International Journal on Advances in Systems and Measurements, vol 14 no 1 & 2, year 2021, http://www.iariajournals.org/systems_and_measurements/
2021, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org
slightly above the mark of 33%, there is at least a sufficient 
explanatory rate of the values of the dependent variable. The 
ANOVA scores an F-Ratio above the mark of 3.90. 
The expected return positively significantly affects the 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. This means, when investors 
expect a higher return, they are more open to use 
cryptocurrencies. In addition, the affinity for risk relates 
positively significantly but weakly with the intention to use 
cryptocurrencies. If investors are open to speculate and to 
take higher risks in investments, they intent to use 
cryptocurrencies for their investments. The VIF-values are 
below the mark of 3, so it can be excluded those 
multicollinearities are within the assumed model. 
In Table XXI, the variable of the expectation regarding a 
total loss of the investment is related to the intention to use 
cryptocurrencies. The r-square of the regression is 12.2%. 
Surely, the mark is below 33% and therefore, the explanatory 
rate seems to be low. In comparison to the other concepts, the 
expectation of a total loss of an investment in 
cryptocurrencies reaches a high r-square regarding that only 
one variable in the regression is considered. The F-Ratio of 
the ANOVA indicates a value better than the mark of 3.90 
and therefore, a model fit is given. The variable total loss is 
negatively significant related to the intention to use 
cryptocurrencies.  
The negative relationship remarks that investors perceive 
those investments in cryptocurrencies are very improbable to 
lead to a full loss of the investment. This induces the 
openness for and investments in cryptocurrencies. Since there 
is only one variable, there cannot be any multicollinearities. 
In Table XXII, the variables of the concept experience are 
directly related to the intention to use cryptocurrencies. The 
r-square of 45.8% describes a low to moderate explanatory 
rate of the values occurring by the dependent variables. At 
least two fifths of the values of the dependent variable 
intention to use cryptocurrencies can be explained by 
applying the independent variables covering the concept of 
experience. The F-Ratio of 8.734 remarks an existing model 
fit.

In the concept experience, two variables are positively 
significant with the intention to use cryptocurrencies. Firstly, 
the general investment behavior positively affects to the 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. In general, in case investors 
do regularly investments (indifferently in which field) they 
are more open to intent to use investments in 
cryptocurrencies. Secondly, the variable, which includes the 
investment duration, is positively significant related to the 
intention to use cryptocurrencies. This means, investors are 
more oriented in a long-term store of value. If they behave in 
this direction, they see cryptocurrencies also as opportunity 
to invest over a longer time. If investors want to invest for a 
longer period of time, they are more intent to use 
cryptocurrencies for their investments. The VIF-scores 
identify those multicollinearities can be excluded in the 
model. 
Finally, in a combined regression, all independent 
variables of the three individual regressions are used together. 
The combination of the independent variables leads to an 
enhancement to the level of 70.1%. Comparing the resulting 
r-square to the mark of 33%, the combined approach 
identifies a high level of explanatory power. In this regard, 
nearly three quarters of the data points of the dependent 
variable can be explained by the application of the 
independent variables. The F-Ratio of 8.041 identifies a good 
model fit. Through combining all independent variables of 
the previous regression analyses, only the variable covering 
the general investment behavior affects positively significant 
the intention to use cryptocurrencies. When investors have 
more experience with the application and execution of 
investments in general, they are more open and willing to use 
cryptocurrencies. This effect seems to be the most dominant 
one in the model, since all the other independent variables are 
getting insignificantly when they are considered in the 
combined approach. It can be assumed that investors in 
cryptocurrencies are persons, who have done investments in 
the past. Therefore, if persons are familiar with investments, 
they are more willing to do investments in cryptocurrencies. 
However, the combined approach identifies two variables 
(risk appetite and risk type), which have VIF-values above 
the mark of 3. In this regard, the combined approach cannot 
fully guarantee that no multicollinearities are within the 
model. For this reason, the regression coefficients could be 
biased by the overwhelming effects of the independent 
variables, which are strongly correlating with each other. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
The mean analyses underline the importance of Bitcoin as 
sign for the whole cryptocurrencies. In this regard, the 
outcomes of the regression and correlation analyses are 
influenced from the aspect that in the most cases, the 
investors anticipate Bitcoin with the term cryptocurrency. 
Although cryptocurrencies are implemented for solving 
several kinds of transactions, most of the investors see 
cryptocurrencies with the type of Bitcoin, an alternative 
payment method with speculation options. 
Summarizing the regression analyses, the hypotheses H1 
to H3 can be accepted. In general, when investors have made 

14

investments in the past, they are more open to use 
cryptocurrencies. This result is supported by the fact that how 
longer the investors do investments and have a long-term 
store of value, they intent to use cryptocurrencies. In addition, 
if the investors expect to experience not a total loss of the 
investment in cryptocurrencies, they have a higher 
willingness to use cryptocurrencies. Lastly, investors, who do 
investments with a greater risk, they have also a greater intent 
to use cryptocurrencies for their investment to reach higher 
returns. 
To sum up, all three concepts identify significant variables, 
which are influencing the intention to use cryptocurrencies. 
For this reason, the assumed research model and hypotheses 
can be fully confirmed. However, as remarked in the 
beginning, the sample size of the whole analysis is too low. 
On this account, the achieved results cannot be generalized, 
and further quantitative analyses and surveys are necessary to 
deepen the influence factors of cryptocurrencies. As this is a 
very topical issue, the authors expect that further research 
works will be performed, which focus on the influence factor 
for the adoption of Bitcoin, Ethereum and further currencies.
