Abstract  — This article is focused on development of a tool 
supporting physicians with an appropriate treatment decisions 
at patients with acute ischemic stroke. The automated tools for 
infarction  core  area  delineation  could  provide  important 
information  about  the  volume  of  the  infarction  core.  This 
article describes such automated method results used on both 
cerebral and perfusion blood volume computed tomography 
maps compared with manual infarction core delineations made 
by two physicians.
Keywords  -  ischemic  stroke;  infarction  core  delineation; 
perfusion blood volume maps; computed tomography

 INTRODUCTION
This paper deals with acute ischemic strokes, which are 
the third leading cause of death and the first leading cause of 
disability in population over 60 years old. Patients undergo 
several types of computed tomography (CT) examinations 
and  based  on  the  results  appropriate  treatment  follows. 
Possible treatment is a thrombolytical treatment, which can 
not be indicated if the patient exceeds certain level of the 
volume of the infarction core. Studies like [1] and [2] deal 
with  finding of  the best threshold value for the infarction 
core. The largest study [1] at 130 patients found threshold at 
2  ml/100g using  cerebral  blood  volume  maps  (CBV) 
provided  by  Perfusion  Computed  Tomography  (CTP) 
examination. The threshold can vary from patient to patient 
and the threshold is also dependent on the used method.
Thrombolytical treatment infarction core volume level 
limitation must be evaluated from the whole brain  but the 
CTP  examination  is  often  limited  in  the  covered  area. 
Different  methods  are  to  be  used  for  the  whole  brain 
infarction core volume evaluation. 
Several studies described process of construction of so 
called perfusion blood volume maps (PBV)  [3], which are 
constructed  from  non  contrast  computed  tomography 
examination  (NCCT)  and  computed  tomography 
angiography (CTA) [4]. It expresses also the blood volume 
level as CBV but the provided information is not the same. 
CBV maps are computed from a series of images observing 
spreading of the contrast material while the PBV maps are 
constructed by adjusted subtraction of two values – densities 
with and without contrast material, which is also depended 
on the  quantity of the contrast material in the time of the 
CTA data acquisition [3]. Another difference can be seen 
also in the slice thickness of the used CTA and NCCT 
examinations.  The  NCCT  slice  thickenss  is  often  about 
5 mm while the CTA slice thickness can be 1 mm. This 
difference increases partial volume impact in the final PBV 
maps.
This article shows comparision of  automated infarction 
core delineation method using CBV maps and PBV maps. 
First, we describe the used material and its adjusting for our 
use. Next, the method itself is introduced and results are 
presented. Discussion summarizes our findings and proposes 
future steps.
II.
MATERIAL
In cooperation with the University Hospital in Pilsen we 
had  an  access  to  24  anonymized  examinations  from  12 
patients with a supratentorial stroke. 12 examinations were 
CBV maps and 12 PBV maps. Both examination types are 
with the whole brain coverage acquired on dual-source CT 
(Somatom  Definition,  Siemens  Healthcare,  Forchheim, 
Germany)  and  PBV  maps  were  constructed  using 
commercial software Siemens syngo Neuro PBV. We also 
had available manually delineated best opinion prediction of 
infarction  core  provided  by  one  radiologist  and  one 
neurologist experienced in CT evaluation. CBV and PBV 
maps  including  the  manual  delineations  were  mutually 
registered. PBV and CBV maps were available in DICOM 
format and after the mutual registration they had dimensions 
512x512  with 44 images per examination  with used units 
ml/l.
We can refer the two physicians as Ph1 and Ph2. Ph2 in 
one patient's examination did not mark any area meaning the 
opinion that there is no infarction core at all. The average 
mutual  correspondence  between  the  findings  of  the  two 
physicians expressed by Matthews correlation coefficient is 
62.09% for CBV maps and 56.90% for PBV maps.
III.
SEGMENTATION ADJUSTEMENT
The CBV examinations were already segmented by the 
instrument  and  the  bones  and  cerebral  ventricles  were 
removed. The PBV examinations have already segmented 
bones and cerebral ventricles but  probably  because of  the 
partial volume effect the steep values changes persist on the 
two different tissue types borders. Both examination types 
contain a rests from non-ideal segmentation at the bottom 
part  under  the  skull  base,  which  would  significantly

influence the following methods' results. Because of this 
reason we performed segmentation adjustement step, which 
selects one image as a divider and for further processing are 
used only images from the top to the divider image. All 
images below are ignored. We used following technique for 
finding the divider image.
A.
Divider Image Detection
If we refer one examination image as  Imi where  i=0 
corresponds to the top of the examination (in the sense of the 
top of the head) and imax to the last image (in the sense of the 
bottom of the head), then, for every image, we can calculate 
following equation:
Ci = Ci
IN / Ci
OUT.
(1)
Ci
IN means count of voxels of the image i, which values 
are above zero, Ci
OUT means count of voxels of the image i, 
which values are below or equal to zero (except voxels with 
value -1024 representing the outer space). 
One of the image becomes the divider image according 
to the Ci value. For this purposes, we start comparing  Ci 
values from the bottom image with i=max towards the upper 
image with index i=0. The first image with index i, which 
satisfies condition  Ci<Th becomes the divider image. We 
found optimal Th value for CBV examination 2.0 and for the 
PBV examination 1.0.
This segmentation adjustment step (example in Fig. 1) is 
just auxiliary for following method comparison to remove 
posterior fossa from further processing. We evaluated that 
this segmentation adjustment step is successful in 95.8% (23) 
cases from all 24 examinations in the sense of providing 
enough  area  by the  segmentation  adjustment  step  to  be 
possible to delineate enough area to cover 100% of manual 
infarction core tracking. The only one unsuccessful  case 
reduces the area but it is still possible to find 96.3% of the 
manually marked infarction core volume. 
IV.
AUTOMATED DELINEATION METHOD
Details of the image processing method used in study [1] 
are not presented enough to reproduce it by own prototype 
software. PBV and CBV maps, which we have available, are 
also provided by commercial software and so that we tried to 
use simple thresholding for processing it. We found a need 
for the examination preprocessing and a need for focusing to 
area of the infarction core to avoid false-positive voxels, 
which would be included into the whole volume of the 
infarction core. 
We developed  a  prototype  software,  which  processes 
CBV and PBV examinations. The automated infarction core 
delineation  is  based  on  examination's  preprocessing,  and 
following thresholding and it is focused to delineate only the 
infarction core area and thus to reach higher specificity.
A.
Image Preprocessing
We used preprocessing examination in a form  of  edge 
preserving  smoothing  as  mentioned  in  [1].  We  used 
Curvature Anisotropic Diffusion smoothing with the usually 
used parameters defined by [5]:
Time step: 
0.0625
Conductance: 3.0
Iterations:
5
B.
Thresholding
After the preprocessing step we tried to find the best 
threshold corresponding to the highest specificity. We used 
thresholds  from  0  ml/l to  21  ml/l.  The  value  21  ml/l 
corresponds to the found threshold value from [1], which is 
2 ml/100g. The used increment was 1 ml/l. The thresholding 
process is simple in CBV examinations - all values from 0 to 
threshold  are  marked  as  infarction  core  but  in  PBV 
examinations we faced to high amount of negative values, 
which belongs to the imperfect bone and cerebral ventricles 
segmentation but also to supposed infarction core areas. In 
order to avoid marking such voxels we reduced them by 
lower limitation of thresholding to arbitrarily used value -50.
C.
Infarction Core Area Selection
We faced to too many false-positives voxels and thus we 
grouped all adjacent voxels, after the thresholding step, into 
groups and we discarded all groups instead of the largest 
one, which we believe to be the one corresponding to the 
infarction core. The disadvantage of this step is a possibility 
that the largest group does not correspond to the infarction 
core while the correct group was discarded since it is smaller 
than the largest group. 
D.
Match Evaluation
We have two patterns of how the automated findings 
should ideally look like. We compare our automated findings 
according to the patterns separately. Firstly, for the CBV 
examinations, and secondly, for the PBV examinations. Let

us call the match between CBV automated findings and 
findings of Ph1 as CBV-Ph1, similarly CBV-Ph2 and also 
PBV-Ph1 and PBV-Ph2.
For each match we can evaluate 4 voxel counts. TP (true 
positive)  -  increased  when  both  voxels  were  marked  as 
infarction core, by physician and also by automated method, 
TN  (true  negative)–  both  voxels  were  marked  as  non-
infarction core, FP (false positive) – the automated method 
marked voxel as infarction core while the physician marked 
the  same  voxel  as  non-infarction  core  and  FN  (false 
negative)  –  automated  method  marked  voxel  as  non-
infarction while physician as infarction core.
Tables I and II present sensitivities and specificities as an 
average values from all 12 patients excluding those with 
incorrect match, which count is presented in IM column.
E.
Incorrect Match 
We call incorrect match the case when the automated 
method findings and the physician's findings have marked no 
common infarction core voxel, it means TP = 0 while FP > 0. 
V.
RESULTS
Results of the described method are presented in Table I 
for  CBV  examinations  and  in  Table  II  for  PBV 
examinations.  Fig.  2  demonstrates  using  of  different 
threshold values on PBV examination. The specificities seem 
to  be  high  but  lets  consider  that  all  examinations  have 
512x512x44=11534336 voxels and for example the average 
infarction  core  area  from  manual  marking  of  the  Ph1 
contains 28603 voxels. If the automated method would find 
all voxels marked by physician but it would mark the 3 times 
larger area, the specificity would be 99.5%.
We can see that for CBV examinations we can obtain 
very high specificity, almost 100% (thresholds from  0 to 
7 ml/l)  but  for  the  PBV  examinations  the  maximum 
specificity  was  found  only  99.24378%,  which  is  not 
satisfying. 
VI.
DISCUSSION
We believe that the low specificity in PBV images is 
caused mostly by partial volume effect, which is caused by

different slice thickness of source images and also by the 
imperfect segmentation of the bones and cerebral ventricles. 
Because of this reason the PBV examinations contain steeper 
changes of values and also high amount of negative values 
especially at two different environment borders including the 
infarction core. The edge preserving smoothing at least with 
the used settings is not strong enough to make the infarction 
core distinguishable by used thresholding.
We also believe that the use of different kind of filters 
like meaning can be useful for the PBV examinations despite 
of  the  loss  of  details  and  in  combination  with  a  local 
neighborhood features better results could be obtained.
VII.
CONCLUSION
We presented simple combination of edge  preserving 
smoothing with selecting the largest continuous area, which 
is considered to be infarction core. Using the thresholding 
technique we evaluated correspondence between automated 
method and manual infarction core delineations provided by 
2 physicians. We can see that while the same method can in 
the case of CBV maps provide almost 100% specificity, it is 
almost unusable in the same form using the PBV maps. In 
discussion  we  mentioned  our  opinion  of  the  low  PBV 
specificity and we proposed our ideas how to improve results 
on PBV maps.
