Abstract— In this paper, we exploit the nonlinear property of 
the SiC multilayer devices to design an optical processor for 
error detection that enables reliable delivery of spectral data 
of four-wave mixing over unreliable communication channels. 
The SiC optical processor is realized by using double pi’n/pin 
a-SiC:H photodetector with front and back biased optical 
gating elements. Visible pulsed signals are transmitted 
together at different bit sequences. The combined optical 
signal is analyzed. Data show that the background act as 
selector that pick one or more states by splitting portions of 
the input multi optical signals across the front and back 
photodiodes. Boolean operations such as EXOR and three bit 
addition are demonstrated optically, showing that when one or 
all of the inputs are present, the system will behave as an XOR 
gate representing the SUM. When two or three inputs are on, 
the system acts as AND gate indicating the present of the 
CARRY bit. Additional parity logic operations are performed 
using four incoming pulsed communication channels that are 
transmitted and checked for errors together. As a simple 
example of this approach, we describe an all-optical processor 
for error detection and then provide an experimental 
demonstration of this idea.

INTRODUCTION  
Using visible light for data transmission, which is 
referred to as Visible Light Communication (VLC), opens a 
broad spectrum of applications, such as photonic circuits for 
the purpose of chip-level communications and location 
estimation. Increases in power efficiency per bit of data are 
projected 
to 
be 
achieved 
by 
replacing 
electrical 
interconnects with their optical counterparts in the near 
future. Digital optical systems and optical processors 
demand an all-optical arithmetic unit to perform different 
optical arithmetic operations. Various architectures, logical 
and/or arithmetic operations have been proposed in 
optical/optoelectronic computing [1][2][3][4]. Effort has 
been made for the development of all-optical logical 
functions [5] by using different schemes like optoelectronic 
devices based on optical nonlinear micro-ring resonators 
[6][7]. 
Multilayered Si/C structures based on amorphous silicon 
technology 
are 
reconfigurable 
to 
perform 
WDM 
optoelectronic logic functions [8][9]. They have a nonlinear 
magnitude-dependent response to each incident light wave. 
In this paper we exploit the nonlinear property of the SiC 
multilayer devices under steady state backgrounds to design 
an all-optical adder unit.  
The SiC optical processor for error detection and 
correction is realized by using double pin/pin a-SiC:H 
photodetector with front and back biased optical gating 
elements. Red, green, blue and violet pulsed signals are 
transmitted together at different bit sequences. The 
combined optical signal is analyzed by reading out the 
photocurrent, under low wavelength background (350 nm) 
and different intensities. The operational principle of SiC 
based switches is discussed and the theoretical design of all-
optical adder operation is reported. Experimental results 
confirming the described method are also presented. 
After a short introduction, in Section II the design, 
characterization and operation of the device are presented. 
In Section III, the spectral sensitivity of the device is 
analyzed and, in Section IV, the nonlinear spectral gain is 
presented. Section V, refers the coder/decoder optical 
processor and in Section VI, the full-adder design is shown.

Error control methodology based on SiC technology is

Section VIII. 
 
II. 
DEVICE DESIGN, CHARACTERIZATION AND 
OPERATION 
The full-adder device is realized by using a double 
pi’n/pin a-SiC:H photodetector with TCO front and back 
biased optical gating elements as depicted in Figure 1. The 
active device consists of a p-i'(a-SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n 
heterostructure. The thicknesses and optical gap of the front 
í'- (200 nm; 2.1 eV) and back i- (1000 nm; 1.8 eV) layers 
are optimized for light absorption in the blue and red ranges, 
respectively [10].  
Optoelectronic characterization was performed through 
spectral response measurements without and with steady 
state applied optical bias. 
Monochromatic (red, green, blue and violet; R,G,B,V;) 
pulsed communication channels (input channels) are 
combined together, each one with a specific bit sequence 
and absorbed accordingly their wavelengths (see arrow 
magnitudes in Figure 1). The combined optical signal 
(multiplexed signal; MUX) is analyzed by reading out the 
generated photocurrent under negative applied voltage (-
8V), without and with 390 nm background lighting at 
different intensities, applied either from front or back sides. 
The device operates within the visible range using as input 
colour channels the square wave modulated low power light 
supplied by red (R: 626nm), green (G: 524 nm), blue (B: 
470 nm) and violet (V: 400 nm) LEDs.

III. 
SPECTRAL SENSITIVITY   
The spectral sensitivity was tested through spectral 
response measurements [11] without and under 350 nm 
front and back violet backgrounds using different 
intensities. In Figure 2, the spectral gain (α), defined as the 
ratio between the spectral photocurrent with and without 
applied optical bias, is displayed under near-UV (=350 
nm) illuminations. In Figure 2a, the light was applied from 
the front (F) and in Figure 2b, the irradiation occurs from 
the back side (B). The background intensity () was 
changed between 5µWcm-2 and 3800 µWcm-2.  
Results show that the optical gains have opposite 
behaviours under front and back irradiations. Under 350 nm 
front irradiation (Figure 2a) and low flux, the gain is high in 
the infrared region, presents a well-defined peak at 750 nm 
and strongly quenches in the visible range. As the power 
intensity increases the peak shifts to the visible range and 
can be deconvoluted into two peaks, one in the red range 
that slightly increases with the power density of the 
background and another in the green range that strongly 
increases with the intensity of the UV radiation. In the blue 
range, the gain is much lower. 
This shows the controlled high-pass filtering properties 
of the device under different background intensities. Under 
back bias (Figure 2b) the gain in the blue/violet range has a 
maximum near 420 nm that quickly increases with the 
intensity. Besides it strongly lowers for wavelengths higher 
than 450 nm, acting as a short-pass filter. Thus, back 
irradiation, tunes the violet/blue region of the visible 
spectrum whatever the flux intensity, while front irradiation, 
depending on the background intensity, selects the infrared 
or the visible spectral ranges..

The results show that, low fluxes select the near infrared 
region and cuts the visible one, the reddish part of the 
spectrum is selected at medium fluxes, and high fluxes tune 
the red/green ranges with different gains 
IV. 
NONLINEAR SPECTRAL GAIN  
Several monochromatic pulsed lights separately (697 nm, 
626 nm, 524 nm, 470 nm, 400nm input channels; 
transmitted data) or combined (MUX signal) illuminated the 
device at 12000 bps. Steady state 390 nm bias at different 
intensities due to different LED input currents (0<ILED <30 
mA) were superimposed separately from both sides and the 
photocurrent was measured. For each individual channel the 
photocurrent was normalized to its value without irradiation 
(dark) and the photocurrent gain (αV
R,G,B,V) determined. 
Figure 3, displays the different gain as a function of the 
drive currents of the lighting LED under front (a) and back 
(b) irradiation.

Figure 3.  a) Front and b) back optical gain at =390 nm irradiation and 
different input wavelengths.  
Results show that the gain depends mainly on the channel 
wavelength and slightly on the lighting intensity, for high 
fluxes. Even across narrow bandwidths, the gains are quite 
different. Under front irradiation (Figure 3a) the magnitude 
of the short wavelengths signals is quenched and enlarged in 
the long wavelengths range. The opposite happens when the 
background lighting is at the back side (Figure 3b). Here, 
the short wavelengths gain increases while the long 
wavelengths gain decreases. This behavior can be used to 
build selective filters, where the gain of the short and long 
pass filters is controlled by optical bias either at the front or 
back sides.  
This nonlinearity allows identifying the different input 
channels in the visible range. Due to its low wavelength, the 
background light is absorbed at the top of the front diode 
and, due to the self-bias effect [6], increases the electric 
field at the back diode where the red incoming photons are 
absorbed accordingly their wavelengths (see Figure 1) 
resulting in an increased collection. Under back irradiation 
the electric field decreases mainly at the i-n back interface 
quenching the red/green input signals. 
V. 
CODER/DECODER DEVICE  
In Figure 4, the normalized MUX signal due to the 
combination of the red, green, blue and violet input channels 
(received data) is displayed under front and back 
irradiations (ILED=30 mA). On the top, the input channels 
(transmitted data) are displayed. In the right side of the 
figure all the possible sixteen RGBV sublevels and their 4-
bit binary code are inserted.  
The results show that to each of all the possible 24 on/off 
states it correspond a well-defined level. Under front or 
back irradiation, each of those four channels, in turn, is 
enhanced or quenched (Figure 2 and Figure 3) accordingly 
its wavelength. So, 24 ordered levels (d0-d15) are detected 
(horizontal dot lines) and grouped into two main classes due 
to the high amplification of the red channel (αV
626=4.5). The 
upper eight (23) levels are ascribed to the presence of the red 
channel (R=1), and the lower eight to its absence (R=0), 
allowing the red channel recognition. Since under front 
irradiation the green channel is also amplified (αV
 524=3) the 
four (22) highest levels, in both classes, are ascribed to the 
presence of the green channel (G=1) and the four lower ones 
to its lack (G=0). The blue channel is slightly amplified (αV
 
470=1.75), so, in each group of 4 entries, two subclasses (21) 
can be found: the two higher levels correspond to the 
presence of the blue channel (B=1) and the two lowers to its 
absence (B=0). Finally, each group of 2 entries have two 
near sublevels (αV
 400=0.78), the higher level where the 
violet channels is ON (V=1) and the lower level where it is 
missing (V=0).

figure the transmitted channels are displayed.  
Under back irradiation, the violet channel is strongly 
enhanced (αV
400=16), the blue channel moderately (αV
 470=2) 
and the green and red strongly reduced (αV
524,626=0.3) 
allowing to confirm the presence of violet channel. In 
Figure 4, under front irradiation, d1 and d2 have similar 
values making difficult the decoding; however under back 
irradiation their recognition is obvious. So, from the front 
and back information the different bit sequences were 
decoded and the signal demultiplexed [9].

DESIGN OF FULL-ADDER BASED ON A-SIC 
TECHNOLOGY 
A full adder circuit adds three single bit binary numbers 
(X, Y, Z) and gives result in two single bit binary outputs, 
called Sum (S) and Carry (C) that is a three-bit modulo-2 
addition [12].

Figure 5.  MUX signal, output levels and truth table of a SiC full adder. 
 
 
A full-adder circuit based on a-SiC technology uses the 
same principle; it adds three color single bit binary numbers 
(R,G,B) and gives result in two single bit binary outputs, 
(Sum, Carry). The design of full adder circuit is illustrated 
in Figure 5. Depending upon the state of the variables (R, G, 
B) the output is obtained from one of the eight output levels 
(d0 to d7). 
Figure 5 displays the normalized MUX signals (received 
data) due to the combination of the red (R), green (G) and 
blue (B) input channels (transmitted data), under front 
irradiation. On the top the signals used to drive the input 
channels are displayed showing the presence of all the 
possible 23 on/off states ascribed to 8 separate current levels 
(d0-d7). All eight conditions presented above are listed in 
Table 1. 
The corresponding truth table of full adder for three input 
binary (RGB) variables is shown in the right side of the 
figure. As expected from Figure 3 and Figure 4, the levels 
magnitude depends on the inputs wavelength amplification 
factors under irradiation. 
So, a 3-binary code is associated to each level allowing 
signal decoding. Data shows that when one or all of the 
inputs are present the output will be weighted by their gains 
(αV
R,G,B), which corresponds to four different levels (d1, d2, 
d4, d7; solid arrows in Figure 5), the system behaves as a 
XOR gate, i.e., S =1 [13].

If two or three input channels are simultaneously on, the

corresponds to four separate levels (d3, d5, d6, d7; dot 
arrows) and indicates the presence of CARRY bit (C=1).

ERROR CONTROL BASED ON A-SIC TECHNOLOGY  
Fault tolerance can be achieved in many systems by 
using parity bits. SiC optical processor for error control is 
realized by using the same double pin/pin a-SiC:H 
photodetector.  
Taking into account Figure 4, the encoder for code takes 
four input data bits [R, G, B,V; d8, d4, d2, d1] and creates 
three additional parity bits,  
 
[P-(VRG), P-(VRB), P-(VGB); d13, d11, d7] 
(1) 
 
given by: 
 
P-(VRG) = V  R  G 
 (2) 
 
P-(VRB) = V  R  B 
(3) 
 
P-(VGB) = V  G  B 
(4) 
 
i.e., the parity bits are SUM bits of the three-bit additions of 
violet pulsed signal with two additional bits of RGB. So, the 
seven-bit word at the output of the encoder will be in a 
bytewide format, with the data and the parity bits separated 
as decoded in Figure 4.  
Here, the solid arrows shows the different signals that 
arise from to the presence of one of the four wavelength 
channels [R, G, B, V] and the doted arrows marks the 
generate parity bits. Thus, three independent logic functions 
can be implemented in a SiC WDM circuit. In this case the 
three-bit adder circuit described above can be used as an 
encoder for the code, which simultaneously generates the 
three parity bits. This is schematically shown in Figure 6.  
To make a distinction between transmitted and received 
data, the transmitted bits are denoted by upper case and the 
received bits are by lower case. Thus, the transmitted word 
is:  
 
[R, G, B,V, P-(VRG), P-(VRB), P-(VGB)]

whereas the received word is:

(6) 
 
or else:  
 
[d8, d4, d2, d1, d13, d11, d7]. 
(7) 
 
Since d1 is present in all three parity bits, it is the first bit 
that is checked for errors. The following additions are 
performed on the received bits: 
 
v-(rg) = SUM[p-(vrg), r,g] 
(8) 
 
v-(gb) = SUM[p-(vgb),g,b] 
(9) 
 
v-(rb) = SUM[p-(vrb), r,b] 
(10) 
 
Taking into account Figure 3b and Figure 4 under back 
irradiation, the signal is strongly enhanced if the violet bit is 
on it on state, allowing confirming it presence if generated. 
Combining the two pieces of information (generated parity 
bits and back signal levels) either the absence, or the 
presence of one or double errors, even for similar values of, 
for instance, d1 and d2, will be easily checked.  
In the absence of any errors, received bit equals 
transmitted bit. Each of the above additions would equal d1. 
If v-(rg) is computed in the absence of any errors, it equals 
d1. 
 
v-(rg) = SUM[p-(vrg), r,g]= SUM[ d13, d8 , d4] = 
 
= d13  d8  d4 =d1  d8  d4  d8  d4 = d1       
(11) 
 
In the presence of one error, for example, if the error is 
on d2, (see Figure 4), i.e:  
2
d  = d2  1  
(12)

and making the same operation:  
v-(gb) = SUM[p-(vgb), g, b), d4 , 
2
d  ] 
(13) 
= d7  d4  
2
d  = d1  d2  1  d4  d2  d4= 
d1
 
 
(8) 
 
obviously, the results for the two other operation are: 
 
v-(rg) = d1  
(14) 
 
and  
v-(rb) = 
1
d  
(15) 
 
However, any double error will not violate the parity 
check of P 
 
P=  r  g  b v  p-(vrg)  p-(vrb)  p-(vgb)       (16) 
 
but will violate some of the p-(vrg), p-(vrb), p-(vgb) parity 
checks, thus providing an indication of the double error. 
Thus, parity preserving reversible circuit design can be 
implemented optically being very useful in the development 
of 
fault 
tolerant 
reversible 
systems 
in 
emerging 
nanotechnology.  
VIII. CONCLUSIONS  
The nonlinear property of the SiC multilayer devices 
under front and back lighting backgrounds were exploited to 
design an optical processor for error detection and 
correction that enables reliable delivery of spectral data of 
four-wave mixing over unreliable communication channels. 
The design of an optical full-adder was presented. 
Additional parity logic operations were performed using 
four incoming pulsed communication channels that are 
transmitted and checked for errors together. As a simple 
example of this approach, we described an all optical 
processor for error detection and then provided an 
experimental demonstration of this idea.
