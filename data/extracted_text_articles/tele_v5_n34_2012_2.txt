Abstract—In this paper, we propose a new teletrafﬁc model
for the calculation of blocking probabilities in an Optical Code
Division Multiple Access (OCDMA) Passive Optical Network
(PON) supporting multiple service-classes of Poisson trafﬁc.
OCDMA is a promising candidate of PON conﬁguration for
the provision of moderate security communications with large
dedicated bandwidth to each end user. The PON accommodates
multiple service-classes that are differentiated by either different
data-rates or different Quality of Service levels. Parameters
related to the additive noise, multiple access interference and
user activity are incorporated into our analysis. Based on a two-
dimensional Markov chain, we propose a recursive formula for
the calculation of the number of in-service codewords, when the
OCDMA PON guarantees Quality of Service (QoS), or not. To
evaluate the proposed model, the analytical results are compared
with simulation results to reveal that the model’s accuracy is quite
satisfactory.

I. INTRODUCTION
The exponential growth of the Internet trafﬁc volume and
popularity of broadband applications have accelerated the
demand for higher data rates. In backbone networks the
capacities have been signiﬁcantly increased, mainly due to the
utilization of the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
with hundreds of channels in each optical ﬁber. On the other
hand, current solutions in the access domain, such as the
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), are inadequate to deal with
the growing bandwidth-hungry applications. To break the
bottleneck between the access networks and the ultrahigh-
speed backbone networks, high capacity and cost effective
access solutions are required. The Passive Optical Network
(PON) has received a tremendous attention from both aca-
demic [1] and industrial [2] communities, mainly due to the
low operational cost, the enormous bandwidth offering and the
absence of active components between the central ofﬁce and
the customer’s premises.
Over the years, several standards for PONs have been
evolved, in the form of the G.983 ITU-T recommendations,
which include Asynchronous Transfer Mode PONs (ATM-
PONs) and Broadband PONs (BPONs) [3], or in the form of
IEEE 802.3ah for the Ethernet PON (EPON) [4], etc. These
PONs are based on a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
scheme and they typically use a 1550 nm wavelength for
downstream and a 1310 nm for upstream [5]. While these
TDMA-PONs employ two wavelengths for the upstream and
downstream direction, respectively, the WDM-PON utilizes
multiple wavelengths, so that two wavelengths are allocated
to each user for down/upstream transmissions. A different
approach for the provision of multiple access in PONs is
the Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA). In
contrast to the other multiple access schemes, OCDMA can
multiplex a number of channels on the same wavelength
and on the same time-slot [6]. In addition, OCDMA offers
full asynchronous transmission, soft capacity on demand, low
latency access, simple network control and better security
against unauthorized access [7].
In OCDMA, each communication channel is distinguished
by a speciﬁc optical code. At the receiver each data is multi-
plied by a unique code sequence either in the time domain [8],
or in the wavelength domain [9], or in a combination of both
(simultaneously) [10]. The decoder receives the sum of all en-
coded signals from different transmitters and recovers the data
from a speciﬁc encoder, by using the same optical code. All
the remaining signals appear as noise to the speciﬁc receiver;
this noise is known as multiple access interference (MAI)
and is the key degrading factor of the network’s performance.
Apart from MAI, other forms of additive noise deteriorate the
network performance, such as beat noise, shot noise, thermal
noise and ﬁber-link noise, and worth considering them in
performance analysis [11].
Service differentiation in OCDMA networks can be per-
formed by considering either different data-rates or different
QoS levels for the supported service-classes. For the provi-
sion of data-rate differentiation several solutions have been
investigated. A simple approach is based on the utilization of
multi-length codes [12]; however, under multi-length coding,
short-length codes introduce signiﬁcant interference over long-
length codes, while high error probability emerges for high rate
users. Optical fast-frequency hopping has been also proposed
for multi-rate OCDMA networks [13]. This technique is based
on multiple wavelengths, which requires multi-wavelength

transmitters with high sensitivity on power control. Another
way to provide data-rate differentiation is the assignment of
several codes to each service-class. This procedure is known as
the parallel mapping technique [14]. In this case the number of
codes is proportional to the data rate of the assigned service-
class. For the provision of differential QoS, one-dimensional
and two-dimensional variable-weight optical codes have been
introduced in order to control the Bit Error Rate (BER) at the
receiver [15], [16].
A call-level performance analysis of an OCDMA PON
supporting multiple service-classes of inﬁnite trafﬁc source
population, appears in [17]. The shared medium (link be-
tween Optical Line Terminal (OLT) and Passive Optical Split-
ter/Combiner (PO-SC), see Fig. 1) is modelled by a two di-
mensional Markov chain. Based on this chain, an approximate
recursive formula for the calculation of blocking probabilities
in the PON is presented. However, in [17], no mathematical
proof is provided for the recursive formula; its proof appears
in [1]. To prove it, we rely on the distribution of the occupied
bandwidth in the PON, which is calculated recursively. The
analysis takes into account the user activity, by incorporating
different service times for active and passive (silent) periods.
The capacity of the PON is deﬁned by the total number of
codewords assigned to active users. An arriving call is blocked,
if the resulting number of codewords assigned to all in-service
calls exceeds a predeﬁned threshold which represents the PON
capacity. This case deﬁnes the Hard Blocking Probability
(HBP). A call may also be blocked in any other system
state due to the existence of different forms of additive noise
(thermal noise, shot noise, beat noise). The latter case is
expressed by the Local Blocking Probability (LBP).
In this paper, (a) we include the analysis presented in [1] and
[17], (b) we provide further evaluation of the proposed loss
model, and (c) we extend our analysis (and the evaluation) to
cover the case of a multi-rate OCDMA PON that provides QoS
support. The QoS differentiation is performed by considering
variable-weight code lengths, in order to achieve different
BER levels at the receiver. Furthermore, we calculate the
link utilization in the PON either without, or with QoS
support. Finally, in both cases, we provide the analysis for the
determination of the Burst Blocking Probability (BBP), which
is the probability that a call cannot return to the active state
from the passive state, due to the unavailability of codewords,
or due to the presence of additive noise. The accuracy of the
proposed methodology is evaluated through simulation and is
found to be quite satisfactory.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we discuss about related works. In Section III, we present the
system model. In Section IV, we present the recursive formula
for the calculation of blocking probabilities in a multi-rate
OCDMA PON. This analysis is extended in Section V, in order
to cover the case of multiple service-classes with different QoS
levels. Section VI is the evaluation section. We conclude in
Section VII.
II. RELATED WORKS
There is a signiﬁcant research activity on OCDMA net-
works, but it is mainly focused on the performance of several
OCDMA components, and not on the teletrafﬁc performance
of the overall network, like a PON. Only a few analytical
models have been presented in the literature involving the
computation of blocking probabilities in OCDMA networks.
Goldberg and Prucnal [18] provide analytical models for the
determination of blocking probabilities and for the teletrafﬁc
capacity in OCDMA networks. The results of paper [18]
are applicable to OCDMA PONs, too. The capacity of the
OCDMA PON can be deﬁned by the traditional way, as the
number of continuously transmitting users, which depend on
the number of codewords that the PON supports, given that
each user needs a codeword. Obviously, when the number
of users exceeds the number of codewords in the PON, call
blocking occurs. The PON capacity is limited not only due to
the limited number of codewords, but also due to the presence
of MAI, as well as due to additive noise in OCDMA PONs.
In [18], only the MAI is taken into account. Due to MAI,
when the number of transmitting users in the PON becomes
excessive, the BER at the receiver degrades, causing an outage;
that is, blocking occurs. The number of users is assumed
constant (instead of considering Poisson arrivals). In addition,
the authors take into account in the analysis the stochastic
nature of the offered trafﬁc by a user. As it is clearly stated in
[18], the proposed analysis is independent of the spreading
code used by the OCDMA network. However, it has the
important limitation of considering just one service-class.
A similar study is performed in [19]. It is concentrated
on the performance analysis of the teletrafﬁc capacity of a
hybrid WDM/DS(Direct Sequence)-PON. In such a PON, for
each wavelength, each user data bit is temporarily encoded
with a given sequence of pulses. By this temporal encoding,
the same codewords are shared among different users; thus
many users can simultaneously communicate with each other
by using the same restricted number of codewords. In other
words, the user capacity performance is increased in a cost
effective way per wavelength for a hybrid WSM/DS-OCDMA
PON conﬁguration. In determining the teletrafﬁc capacity
of this PON, two considerations are taken into account: (a)
The so called nominal resource capacity, which is deﬁned
as the maximum number of resources both in WDM and
OCDMA system, that is: (number of wavelengths) x (number
of codewords). (b) The so called simultaneous user capacity
in OCDMA system, deﬁned as the maximum simultaneous
transmitting users at acceptable BER performance. As in [18],
it is also assumed in [19] that only the MAI affects the BER.
Blocking occurs when the system reaches either its nominal
resource capacity or the simultaneous user capacity. It is
shown that the blocking (and teletrafﬁc capacity) performance
depends on the code family used in the OCDMA system.
Again, this paper considers a single service-class, which is
a serious limitation in the study of broadband networks, like
PONs.

A basic conﬁguration of an OCDMA PON.
We also provide a call-level analysis of hybrid WDM-
OCDMA PONs [20], to determine connection failure proba-
bilities due to unavailability of a wavelength in the considered
WDM system with dynamic wavelength assignments, and call
blocking probabilities due to the MAI of the OCDMA system.
The springboard of the analysis presented in [20] is well-
established teletrafﬁc models, developed for Wireless CDMA
systems [21].
III. SYSTEM MODEL OF A MULTI-RATE OCDMA PON
We consider the OCDMA PON of Fig. 1. A number of
Optical Network Units (ONUs) located at the users’ premises
are connected to an OLT (located to Central Ofﬁce) through a
PO-SC (quite close to the ONUs). The PO-SC is responsible
for the broadcasting of trafﬁc from the OLT to the ONUs
(downstream direction) and for the grouping of data from the
ONUs and the transmission of the collected data to the OLT
through one ﬁber (upstream direction). We study the upstream
direction; however, the following analysis can be applied to
the downstream direction. Users which are connected to an
ONU, switch between active and passive (silent) periods. The
PON utilizes (L, W, λa, λc) codewords, which have the same
length L, the same W, while the auto-correlation λa and the
cross-correlation λc parameters are deﬁned according to the
desired value of the BER at the receiver. The PON supports
K service-classes. The service-differentiation in this OCDMA
system is realized using the parallel mapping technique. Under
this technique, the OLT assigns bk codewords to a service-
class k call that is accepted for service and these codewords
are used by the call for its entire duration. In particular, during
a service-class k call, bk data bits are transmitted in parallel in
each bit period. One codeword is used in order to encode data
bit “1”, while data bit “0” is not encoded. Therefore, in each
bit period at most bk data bits are encoded and this number is
equal to the number of “1” data bits that are transmitted during
this bit period. In this way, we avoid the complex procedure
of assigning codewords to calls in each bit period. Also, the
data rate of service-class k is equal to bk · D, where D is the
data rate of a single codeworded call, since bk data bits are
transmitted in parallel during a bit period.
When a single codeword is applied to an active call, the
received power of this call at the receiver is denoted by Iunit,
where Iunit corresponds to the received power per bit, for a
speciﬁc value of BER. Since different service-classes require
different data-rates, the maximum interference Ik that an active
service-class k call causes to the receiver is proportional to
Iunit, because bk data bits of service-class k are transmitted
in parallel, during a bit period, therefore:
Ik = bk · Iunit
(1)
This maximum value of the received power of a service-
class k call refers to the power of the call when all bk parallel
bits are “1”.
Calls that are accepted for service, start an active period and
may constantly remain in the active state for the entire duration
of the call, or alternate between active and passive states.
Throughout an active state, the trafﬁc source sends bursts,
while during a passive state no transmission of data occurs.
When a call is transferred from the active state to the passive
state, the number of codewords that this call was utilizing
in its active state are released, and these codewords become
available to new arriving calls. When a call attempts to become
active again, it re-requests the same number of codewords (as
in the previous active state); if the total number of codewords
of all in-service calls does not exceed a maximum value, a new
active period begins; if not, burst blocking occurs and the call
remains in the passive state. At the end of the active period
the total number of codewords held by all in-service calls is
reduced by bk and the call either jumps to the passive state with
probability vk, or departs from the system with probability
1−vk. Furthermore, calls that belong to service-class k arrive
to an ONU according to a Poisson process; the total arrival
rate from all ONUs is denoted λk. The service time of service-
class k calls in state i, (i=1 indicates the active state, i=2 the
passive state) is exponentially distributed with mean µ−1
ik .
A. Local Blocking Probabilities
According to the principle of the CDMA technology, a call
should be blocked if it increases the noise of all in-service
calls above a predeﬁned level, given that a call is noise for
all other calls. This noise is known as MAI. We distinguish
the MAI from other forms of noise, the shot noise, the beat
noise, the thermal noise and the ﬁber-link noise. The thermal
noise is generally modelled as Gauss distribution (0, σth), the
ﬁber-link noise is modelled as Gauss distribution (0, σfb) [22],
while the beat noise is also modelled as a Gauss distribution

(0,σb) [11]. The shot noise is modelled as a Poisson process
where its expectation and variance are both denoted by p [22].
According to the central limit theorem, we can assume that the
additive shot noise is modelled as Gauss distribution (µN, σN),
considering that the number of users in the PON is relatively
large. Therefore, the interference IN caused by the four types
of noise is modelled as a Gaussian distribution with mean
µN = p and variance σN =
q
σ2
th + σ2
fb + σ2
b + p2.
The Call Admission Control (CAC) in the OCDMA PON
under consideration is performed by measuring the total re-
ceived power at the receiver. When a new call arrives (which
automatically enters an active state), the CAC checks the total
received power and if it exceeds a maximum value Imax, the
call is blocked and lost. This condition is expressed by the
following relation:
PK
k=1(n1
kIk · Pinterf) + Ik + IN > Imax ⇔
IN
Imax > 1 − PK
k=1(n1
k
Ik
Imax · Pinterf) −
Ik
Imax
(2)
where n1
k represent the number of the service-class k calls
in the active system and Pinterf is the probability of inter-
ference. This probability is a function of the maximum cross-
correlation parameter λc, the weight W and the length L of the
codewords and the hit probabilities between two codewords
tha are used to encode data bits of different users. The hit
probabilities pλc,i of getting i hits during a bit period out
of the maximum cross-correlation value λc are given through
[23]:
λc
X
i=0
i · pλc,i = W 2
2L ,
while
λc
X
i=0
pλc,i =1
(3)
where the factor 1/2 is due to the fact that data-bit “0” is not
encoded. For λc = 1, the percentage of the total power of
another’ s user bit that interferes with a bit of the new call is
1/W, since 1 out of W “1” of the codewords may interfere. In
this case Pinterf = (1/W) pλc,1 = W/2L. In the general case
where the maximum value of the cross-correlation is λc ≥ 1
the probability of interference is given by:
Pinterf =
λc
X
i=0
i
W pλc,i = W
2L
(4)
The same condition is used at the receiver, when a passive
call jumps to an active state. Based on (2), we deﬁne the
LBP lbk(n1
k) that a service-class k call is blocked due to the
presence of the additive noise, when the number of active calls
is n1

Since the total additive noise IN follows a Gaussian dis-
tribution (µN, σN), the variable IN/Imax, which is used
for the LBP calculation also follows a Gaussian distribution
(µN/Imax, σN/Imax) Therefore the right-hand side of (6),
which is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of

B. The Distribution of the Number of Active and Passive Calls
The following analysis is inspired by the multi-rate ON-OFF
model for the call-level performance of a single link, presented
in [24], [25], which considers discrete state space. We consider
that the PON capacity is C1. This is a discrete parameter,
since it represents the total number of codewords that can
be assigned to the end-users. When a call is at the passive
state, it is assumed that it produces a ﬁctitious interference of
a ﬁctitious system, with a discrete capacity C2. This passive
system is used to prevent new calls to enter the system when
a large number of calls are at the passive state. In order to
employ the analysis presented in [24], we use the following
notations:
• the total number of codewords assigned to all in-service
active calls is denoted by j1.
• the total (ﬁctitious) number of codewords assigned to all
in-service passive calls is denoted by j2.
Based on the analysis presented in the previous section, a
new call will be accepted for service if the total number of
codewords assigned to all in-service active calls together with
the requirements in codewords of the new call, will not exceed
C1, which is the PON capacity. Moreover, in order to avert the
acceptance of new calls when a large number of calls are in the
passive state, the requirements in codewords of the new call
together with the total number of codewords assigned to all in-
service active calls and the number of codewords assigned to
all in-service passive calls should not exceed the ﬁctitious PON
capacity (which is expressed by the discrete value C2). Based
on this analysis, a new service-class k call will be accepted
for service in the system, if it satisﬁes both the following
constraints:
j1 + bk ≤ C1 and j1 + j2 + bk ≤ C2
(9)
If we denote by Ω the set of the permissible states, then the
distribution ⃗j = (j1, j2), denoted as q(⃗j) can be calculated by
the proposed two-dimensional approximate recursive formula:

The parameter s refers to the systems (s = 1 indicates the

passive state). Also,

Having determined the steady state of the system ⃗n =
(n1, n2), we proceed to the depiction of the transitions from

of the state transition diagram of Fig. 2 reﬂects the arrivals
on new calls and the termination of calls. More speciﬁcally,
when the system is at state (A) it will jump to state (B) with a
rate λk, when a new service-class k call arrives at the system.
This rate is multiplied by the probability 1 − lbk(n1
k − 1)
that this call will not be blocked due to the presence of the
additive noise. Similarly, we deﬁne the rate from state (C)
to state (A). From state (B) the system will jump to state
(A) µ1,k

.
The ﬁrst summation of the right part of (26) refers to the
probability that a new call could be blocked at any system
state due to the presence of the additive noise. The second
summation signiﬁes the HBP, which is derived by summing
the probabilities of all the blocking states that are deﬁned by
(9). Note that the bounds of the ﬁrst summation in (26) are
accidentally different than those of the corresponding equation
in [17] due to a misprint in (10) of [17].
The calculation of the BBP is based on the fact that burst
blocking occurs when a passive call cannot return to the active
state. This situation occurs when at least one of the two reasons
are valid: the ﬁrst reason refers to the case where the number
of codewords assigned to the call (so that this call could
be transferred from passive to active state) together with the
number of codewords assigned to all in-service active calls
exceeds the capacity of the PON. The effect of this reason
can be determined by the number n2
k of service-class k calls
in passive state, when the system is at any burst blocking state:
⃗j ∈Ω∗⇔
( 
C1−bk+1≤j1≤C1∩
 2
X
s=1
js ≤C2
!!)
(27)
By multiplying n2
k by the corresponding probability q(⃗j)
and the service rate in the passive state µ2
k we calculate the
rate that service-class k calls depart from a burst blocking
state, if it was possible. Then, we sum the rates that a service-
class k call would depart from any burst blocking state:
X
⃗j∈Ω∗
n2
kq(⃗j)µ2k
(28)
The second reason refers to the case where a passive call
cannot return the active state due to the presence of the additive
noise. Following the same procedure resulted in (28), we
calculate the sum of the rates that a service-class k call would
depart from any state, except from the burst blocking states.
Due to local blocking, however, each rate is multiplied by the
corresponding value of lbk(⃗j):
X
⃗j∈{Ω−Ω∗}
n2
k lbk(⃗j) q(⃗j)µ2k
(29)
By normalizing the sum of (28) and (29) (i.e. by taking into
account the state-space Ω), we obtain the BBP of service-class
k, Bbk:
Bbk =

IV. SYSTEM MODEL OF A MULTI-RATE OCDMA PON
WITH QOS GUARANTEES
In OCDMA networks, QoS differentiation can be realised
by the utilization of codewords with different weights. To this
end, we assume that the PON supports K = T · F service-
classes: F service-classes are differentiated by the data rate,
while each one of these F service-classes supports T different
QoS levels that express different values of the BER at the
receiver. We also consider that the PON assigns (L, Wt, λa, 1)
codewords to service-class t, t = 1, ..., T. Calls of these T
service-classes require the same number bf,t (f = 1, ..., F)
of codewords, while they are differentiated by the weight
Wt. The received power per bit “1” of service-class f, t is
denoted as If,t
unit, while the received power that corresponds
to a call of service-class f, t is at most Iact
f,t = bf,t · If,t
unit.
The trafﬁc parameters of service-class f, t are denoted as
(λf,t, µ−1
1,f,t, µ−1
2,f,t, vf,t). To simplify the presentation of these
parameters we use one notation for the service-classes; we
denote that the parameters of service-class k (k = 1, . . . , T ·F)
are Ik
unit = If,t
unit, Ik
act = If,t
act, bk = bf,t, λk = λf,t,
µ−1
ik = µ−1
i,f,t and vk = vf,t.
In order to determine the LBP of service-class k, we use
the following relation, which is based on (6):
lbk(n1

where the probability of interference P x,k

codewords with weights Wx and Wk is a function of the hit
probability [26]:

(34)
The probability of interference of a codeword of a service-
class k assigned to a new arriving call and a codeword
of service-class x can be calculated by following the same
procedure that was used in order to derive (3):

For the case of the multi-rate OCDMA PON with QoS
differentiation the distribution of active and passive calls is
given by (10), where the upper bound of the summations that
refers to the total number of service-classes has to be changed
(from K) to T ·F. The same change has to be applied in (26),
(30) and (31) in order to calculate the CBP, the BBP and the
link utilization, respectively.
V. EVALUATION
We evaluate the proposed analytical models through simu-
lation. To this end we simulate the OCDMA PON of Fig.1 by
using the Simscript II.5 simulation tool [27]. The simulation
results are mean values from 6 runs with conﬁdence interval
of 95%. The resulting reliability ranges of the simulation
measurements are small and, therefore, we present them only
in tables; in ﬁgures we provide only mean values. We consider
two application examples. In the ﬁrst example, which is
simpler for clariﬁcation, we assume that the OCDMA PON
supports K=2 service-classes that are only differentiated by
the data rate, without QoS differentiation. The PON utilizes
the (211,4,1,2) codewords, which result in a maximum num-
ber of 105 codewords. Based on the analysis presented in
[28] and considering a typical value of BER=10−6, the total
number of codewords is reduced to C1 for Iunit = 0.4µW.
The trafﬁc description parameters of the two service classes
are (b1, b2) = (7, 2), (µ−1
11 , µ−1
12 ) = (0.8, 1.0), (µ−1
21 , µ−1
22 ) =
(1.1, 1.4), (v1, v2)=(0.9, 0.95). We assume that the maximum
received power is equal to 4 µW, while the total number of

In Tables I and II, we present analytical and simulation
results of the two service-classes for the CBP and BBP,
respectively, versus the arrival rate. We assume that the arrival
rate is the same for the two service-classes. In Table III we

the active and the passive link, versus the arrival rate of the
two service-classes. As the results of the three tables reveal,
the accuracy of the proposed analysis is absolutely satisfactory.
We also investigate the impact of various network param-
eters on the CBP and the BBP. To this end, Fig. 3 and 4
present analytical and simulation results of the CBP and the
BBP, respectively, for the two service-classes, versus different
mean values µN of the total additive noise, while σN is kept
constant. In both Fig. 3 and 4 the arrival rate of the two
service-classes is (0.15, 0.15) calls/sec, while the values of
all other parameters are the same with those used in Tables I,

II and III. The comparison of analytical and simulation results
of Fig. 3 and 4 shows that the accuracy of the proposed model
is completely satisfactory for call-level performance. As it is
expected from (5) and (6), higher values of the mean total
additive noise results in higher values of the LBP and therefore
higher values of CBP and BBP. The increase of the mean total
additive noise results in the increment of both CBP and BBP
of the ﬁrst service-class, while the values of the CBP and
BBP of the second service-class are slightly decreased. This
is due to the fact that higher values of the total additive noise
increases the LBP; therefore the CBP and the BBP of the ﬁrst
service-class, which has the highest demands in codewords,
increases. But in this case more codewords are available for the
second service-class, which has lower demands in codewords.
Further increase of the mean total additive noise will result in
the increase of the CBP and BBP of the second service-class.
Another parameter that we examine is the total interference
Imax at the receiver. In Fig. 5 and 6, we present analytical and
simulation results for the CBP and BBP, respectively, of the

two service-classes, versus different values of the parameter
Imax. In both ﬁgures the arrival rate of the two service-
classes is (0.15, 0.15) calls/sec, while the values of all other
parameters are the same with those used in Tables I, II
and III. As the results of Fig. 5 and 6 reveal, the accuracy
of the proposed model is absolutely satisfactory, even for
small values of the total interference Imax. The decrease of
the total interference at the receiver results in higher values
of both CBP and BBP of the ﬁrst service-class, since less
interference can be received; therefore less calls of the ﬁrst
service-class can be accommodated at the PON. As in the
case of Fig. 3 and 4, this situation results in lower CBP and
BBP values of the second service-class, which requires smaller
number of codewords. Nevertheless, high values of Imax can
be achieved by receivers with higher sensitivity, which are
more complicated and therefore more costly.
In order to demonstrate the effect of the ﬁctitious capacity
to the CBP and BBP, in Fig. 7 and 8 we present analytical
CBP and BBP results, respectively, versus different values of

8 the arrival rate of the two service-classes is (0.15, 0.15)
calls/sec, while the values of all other parameters are the same
as the ones were used previously. The increment of the total
number of ﬁctitious codewords results in lower CBP values for
both service-classes, since more calls can be accommodated to
the passive system. However, this increment results in higher
values of the BBP, because the contention for the transition
from the passive to the active state. Note that when C1 = C2
no burst blocking occurs, but at the expense of higher CBP.
We now proceed to the second application example,
which refers to the case of a multi-rate OCDMA PON
with QoS differentiation. The PON supports 4 service-
classes. Service-classes s1 and s3 require the same number

s2 and s4 require the same number of codewords, but
different than that of s1 and s3. Service-classes s1 and

(0.9, 0.9, 0.95, 0.95). The maximum received power at each
receiver is assumed to be equal to 4.0 µW, while the total
number of ﬁctitious codewords is 52. The total additive noise
follows a Gauss distribution (1, 0.1) µW.
In Tables IV and V, we present analytical and simulation
CBP results of the four service-classes, versus the call arrival
rate. Tables VI and VII present analytical and simulation BBP
results of the four service-classes, versus the call arrival rate.
Also, in Table VIII we present analytical and simulation results
for the utilization of the active and the passive link, versus
the arrival rate. Comparison between analytical and simulation
results shows that the accuracy of the proposed model with
QoS differentiation is quite satisfactory. Note that although

the trafﬁc characteristics of service-classes s1 and s3 as well
as of s2 and s4, justify almost the same CBP and BBP results
(the small declinations are due to the effect of the LBP),
the obtained results are further differentiated because of the
different BER which is expressed by the different codewords.
VI. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we present analytical models for the blocking
performance of multirate OCDMA PONs with or without
QoS guarantees. Our analysis takes into account parameters
related to the additive noise, MAI and user activity. We provide
and prove an approximate recurrent formula for the efﬁcient
calculation of the CBP, which is a function of the LBP, and
of the HBP. The accuracy of the proposed analysis is quite
satisfactory, as it was veriﬁed by simulations. Of course, the
efﬁcient applicability of OCDMA technique to PON need
further study. As a future work we will incorporate a ﬁnite
population of trafﬁc sources in the CBP calculation, while
we will study the case where the receiver has an interference
cancellation capability.
