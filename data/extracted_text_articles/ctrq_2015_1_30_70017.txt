Abstract – The approaches for soft-decision decoding of maxi-
mum-transition-run (MTR) codes have been extensively re-
searched lately. Two different methods, named as min-max in 
LC and max-log MAP in LC have emerged as a fairly suitable 
for MTR code utilization in magnetic recording systems. Both 
methods were designed to enable the propagation of the soft-
values through the logic circuits of the MTR decoder, allowing 
the concatenation of MTR code with some powerful error-cor-
recting codes, such as the low-density parity-check (LDPC) co-
des. In this paper, the min-max in LC versus the max-log MAP 
in LC approach is considered in the framework of simple and 
the straightforward LDPC-MTR concatenation over E2PR4 
magnetic recording channel. Both methods show nearly the 
same coding gain of 2 dB at BER = 10-5.  
Keywords – soft-decision decoding; constrained coding; MTR 
codes; LDPC codes. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The maximum-transition-run (MTR) codes have been 
confirmed as very useful constrained codes for E2PR4 mag-
netic recording channel, preventing the dominant error-event 
± [+1 –1 +1] and consequently improving the distance prop-
erties of the channel by increasing the minimal squared Eu-
clidean distance between two distinct sequences in this type 
of the channel. Their design was primarily oriented towards 
constrained features, resulting with unsatisfactory error cor-
recting capabilities. Thus, the MTR codes need to be merged 
with some powerful error-correcting code, such as the well-
established low-density parity-check (LDPC) code [2].  
There were several attempts to combine/concatenate the 
MTR and LDPC [3]-[5], requiring that the MTR decoder is 
able to handle soft-values [6]. Independently, an approach of 
a simple and straightforward serial concatenation of these 
codes was considered, providing as a result two additional 
methods for the soft-decision decoding of MTR codes: the 
min-max in LC and max-log MAP in LC methods [7], [8]. 
In this paper, the min-max in LC and max-log MAP in LC 
methods are considered and compared as methods that ena-
ble propagation of the soft-values through the logic circuits 
of the MTR decoder in LDPC-MTR concatenation, where 
LDPC acts as an outer and MTR as an inner code, over the 
one-track one-head E2PR4 magnetic recording channel.  
Section II presents a brief overview of the min-max in LC 
and max-log MAP in LC approaches, while Section III ex-
plains the LDPC-MTR encoding over the E2PR4 channel. 
Section IV brings complexity analyses of the two proposed 
methods and Section V offers simulation results and perfor-
mance comparison. Finally, Section VI presents the conclu-
sion to this paper. 
II. 
MTR CODES AND SOFT-DECISION DECODING 
The MTR codes bring a constraint in the encoding pro-
cess by eliminating three or more consecutive transitions in 
the recording sequence of E2PR4 channel, and thus eliminate 
the most troubleshooting error-event ± [+1 –1 +1], enhancing 
E2PR4 channel distance properties [10].  
The MTR codes were originally presented by Moon and 
Brickner [1]. One of their major benefits is that they can be 
realized using simple logic circuits, as it is presented in Fig-
ure 1, for the well know rate 4/5 (2, k = 8) MTR code.

Such feature enables an easy hardware implementation, 
providing the low-cost realization for the MTR decoder.  
The key idea of the min-max in LC and the max-log MAP 
in LC methods was to implement the soft-decision approach 
in existing logic circuits and to assemble the novel MTR 
decoder with soft-decision capabilities. The soft-value of the 
variable x is defined as

where log() function is a natural logarithm. The sign of L(x) 
represents the binary decision of a variable, the so called 
hard-decision, while the magnitude represents the confidence 
or reliability of a binary decision [6]. 
Using the soft-decision approach, the MTR decoder will 
be able to offer the binary decision, as well as the reliability

of that decision for all its outputs, increasing information 
redundancy that will be delivered to the next step decoder. 
Such new MTR decoder that is capable to handle input soft-
values and produce subsequent soft-values on its outputs is 
necessary in iterative decoding schemes.  
A. Brief overview of the min-max in LC method 
The min-max in LC method suggests enhancing the exist-
ing Boolean logic circuits, so that they are able to produce 
the output soft-values according to the following expressions

Using this approach, the idea is to preserve the simplici-
ty of the hardware realization of the decoder and at the same 
time to design circuits capable of working with soft-values. 
III. 
MTR ENCODING/DECODING OVER E2PR4 CHANNEL  
Performances of the min-max in LC and max-log MAP in 
LC were considered over the high density E2PR4 magnetic 
recording channel, encoded by the simple LDPC-MTR serial 
concatenation. In this early stage of investigation, the simula-
tion schemes do not employ any specially designed codes. 
A. LDPC–MTR encoding process 
The LDPC-MTR encoding was performed using R = 0.96 
LDPC as an outer code and a well-known, rate 4/5 (2, k = 8) 
MTR, as an inner code, in the simulation scheme depicted in 
Figure 3.

The LDPC code of the length N = 4732, with M = 169 
parity bits and column-weight 3 is based on Kirkman triple 
systems [13]. 
Unfortunately, the resulting code rate of concatenation is 
only R = 0.771. This is not quite suitable for high density 
magnetic recording; however, it is not limiting for such ini-
tial investigation of MTR soft-decision decoding methods. 
It was assumed that the read-back signal y is distorted 
with the additive white Gaussian (AWGN) noise n and that 
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is defined as

where Ec = REb is the symbol bit energy at channel output, 
No is one-sided power spectral density and σ2 is noise vari-
ance. 
B. LDPC–MTR decoding process  
The channel detection was done using the Soft-Output 
Viterbi Algorithm (SOVA), with the detection window of 20 
symbols, while the LDPC code was decoded by the message-
passing algorithm [14]. 
During the decoding process, the soft information was 
exchanged between SOVA decoder and message-passing, as 
depicted in Figure 4.

Intention of this paper was to investigate the performance 
of the proposed methods for the MTR soft-decision decod-
ing. Thus, the simulation scheme implements the reverse and 
straightforward concatenation of LDPC-MTR, without any 
iterative exchange between them, focusing on the ability of 
soft-values propagation through the MTR decoder. 
IV. 
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROPOSED METHODS 
Both methods suggest the redesign and enhancement of 
the conventional logic circuits, though they determine the

output soft-values for particular logic circuits in a different 
way. This section is intended to emphasize the difference 
between them, as well as their complexity.  
A. AND logic circuits 
The analysis of difference between the output soft-values 
of methods, for AND circuits, was performed considering 
that both input soft-values range between -8 and +8, with the 
step of 0.1. The major difference can be noticed when inputs 
have the same value but different sign, as depicted in Figure 
5, part a.

Figure 5. Difference of the output soft-value for AND circuits. 
 
Moreover, analyzing the two-dimensional matrix, whose 
columns and rows represent Lin(x1) and Lin(x2), it can be no-
ticed that over the main diagonal, where Lin(x2) = – Lin(x1), 
the difference between methods is very high and symmetri-
cally distributed over the point where Lin(x1) and Lin(x2) are 
equal to zero, as depicted in Figure 5, part b.  
Furthermore, over the sub-diagonal of the matrix, where 
Lin(x2) = + Lin(x1), the difference between methods is lower 
and exists only when input values are negative, as depicted 
in Figure 5, part c. In case that both input soft-values are 
positive, the min-max in LC and max-log MAP in LC identi-
cally assess the output soft-values. 
Analyzing other points in [Lin(x1), Lin(x2)] matrix, which 
are off-diagonal elements, it can be noticed that certain posi-
tive differences exist, as depicted in Figure 5, part d. This 
difference is not extreme as those on the main diagonal and 
thus it can be concluded that both of these two methods asses 
correctly the output soft-value, but with different confidence.  
Even both proposed methods use the min() and max() 
functions, it seems that the min-max in LC approach produc-
es some higher soft-values on the output of the AND logic 
circuit than the max-log MAP in LC method. Only in a case 
when both input values Lin(x1), Lin(x2) are equal and positive, 
these two methods produce the same output soft-value. 
B. OR logic circuits 
The similar analysis of difference between assessment in 
the suggested methods can be performed for OR logic cir-
cuits, as depicted in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Difference of the output soft-value for OR circuits. 
 
In this case, the min-max in LC assesses lower output 
soft-values, compared to max-log MAP in LC, with the simi-
lar situation that the major difference lies on the main diago-
nal of [Lin(x1), Lin(x2)] matrix, where Lin(x2) = – Lin(x1). Also, 
we have symmetric distribution over the point where Lin(x1) 
and Lin(x2) are equal to zero, as depicted in Figure 6, part b. 
Additionally, on the sub-diagonal of [Lin(x1), Lin(x2)] ma-
trix, both methods equally assess output values, when input 
values are equal and negative, as depicted in Figure 6, part c. 
Moreover, analyzing the shape of the difference function, 
it can be concluded, again, that both methods similarly assess 
soft-values on the circuit output, unfortunately, with quite 
different confidence when Lin(x2) = – Lin(x1). 
C. XOR logic circuits 
In the case of XOR logic circuits, the min-max in LC and 
the max-log MAP in LC methods assess output soft-values 
with almost negligible difference, which ranges around 10-15, 
as depicted in Figure 7, part a. Thus, both the proposed 
methods are equally confident and offer a quite suitable soft-
value for XOR circuits.

Even more, there is no any difference on the main and 
sub-diagonal of [Lin(x1), Lin(x2)] matrix, as depicted in Figure 
7, parts b and c, while on a wide range of the off-diagonal 
elements this difference is zero, as shown in Figure 7, part d. 
These two proposed methods have suitable assessments 
of the soft-values on the circuit outputs. However, during 
their implementation into the new MTR decoder, the atten-
tion has to be paid to the complexity and the total number of 
the required operations in the decoder.   
D. Analysis on the required number of operations 
The min-max in LC and max-log MAP in LC methods are 
based on the min() and max() functions in order to assess the 
soft-values. Regarding the number of operations, the min-
max in LC is in slight advantage, as depicted in Figure 8.

Unfortunately, the several required operations with input 
soft-values, in the max-log MAP in LC, increase the number 
of overall operations, even though the complexity of both 
methods is still of the same degree. However, regarding the 
assembly of the new MTR decoder that is based on the soft-
decision approach, the total number of the required opera-
tions by both proposed methods in all logic circuits should be 
considered, since that can have a substantial impact on the 
power consumption of the newly created decoder.  
Analyzing the decoder for the well know rate 4/5 (2, k = 
8) MTR code, depicted in Figure 1, it can be noticed that 
such realization requires 5 NOT, 8 AND and 5 OR logic cir-
cuits, with a total number of decoder operations as depicted 
in Figure 9.

Additionally, the min-max in LC and max-log MAP in LC 
methods require one XOR circuit in the data sequence pre-
processing phase, before the sequence enters into the MTR 
decoder. The XOR circuit is not depicted in the MTR decod-
er, presented in Figure 1, though it should be counted in the 
total number of the MTR decoding process.  
Even though these proposed soft-decision methods have 
the same degree of complexity, the min-max in LC approach 
requires 6.3 times less operations than the other one. There-
fore, the min-max in LC outperforms the max-log MAP in LC 
and will be more desirable for the practical implementation 
into the soft-decision MTR decoder. 
V. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
In order to provide the final conclusion on min-max in 
LC and max-log MAP in LC approach for soft-decision de-
coding of the MTR codes, the comparison was made over the 
one-track E2PR4 magnetic recording channel, utilizing serial 
concatenation of LDPC-MTR codes. Performances of these 
methods have been summarized in Figure 10.

It can be observed that the utilization of both min-max in 
LC and max-log MAP in LC approaches in the logic circuits 
of the new MTR decoder, within the LDPC-MTR serial con-
catenation, resulted with almost identical and, in addition, 
the considerable coding gain of 2.2 dB for BER = 10-5, com-
paring with the uncoded channel. 
This result confirms that both methods properly estimate 
soft-values on the logic circuits outputs, allowing the propa-
gation of the soft-information to the LDPC decoder. 
Using both these approaches, the new MTR decoder can 
be equipped with the soft-decision decoding capability, of-
fering the confidence of binary decisions per output, which is 
required for the iterative simulation schemes.  
Both methods are almost identical with the achieved de-
coding gain, but a slight advantage is on the side of the min-
max in LC. This approach resulted with 6.3 time lower num-
ber of operations in the MTR decoder, which can be quite 
valuable in case of extensive utilization of decoder and de-
manding signal processing. The lower number of arithmetic 
operations can have strong influence on the power consump-
tion of practical MTR decoder.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper presents a comparison of two newly proposed 
methods, min-max in LC and max-log MAP in LC methods, 
for the soft-decision decoding of the MTR code. Both meth-
ods suggest the redesign and enhancement of the classical 
Boolean logic circuits and their implementation into the new 
MTR decoder. 
Both approaches achieved almost identical decoding gain 
in a serial concatenation of the MTR and LDPC codes, over 
the E2PR4 magnetic recording channel. The obtained decod-
ing gain confirms that proposed methods appropriately eval-
uate soft-values on the outputs of the logic circuits in a soft-
decision MTR decoder, enabling their implementation in an 
iterative decoding scheme.  
However, the slight advantage is on the side of the min-
max in LC method, regarding the required number of opera-
tions in a new MTR decoder. The reason for this lies in the 
fact that the simple min() and max() decisions are required in 
the min-max in LC method in order to assess the soft-value 
on the output of logic circuits, compared to the max-log MAP 
in LC, which requires additional operations with the input 
soft-values before the decision is made. 
The low number of operations recommends the min-max 
in LC method as a fairly suitable for the implementation into 
the soft-decision MTR decoder, which potentially can have 
relatively small power consumption.  
This paper has indicated also, that min-max in LC method 
is about to produce the less confident output soft-values, for 
AND and OR logic circuits, when the input soft-values are 
equal, though with a different sign, Lin(x2) = – Lin(x1). Thus, 
this issue can be a foundation for future research on the min-
max in LC enhancement.
