Abstract—Topic speciﬁc forums, which contain a vast amount
of information can aid in providing very useful and informative
advice to their readers. Forums that are speciﬁc to scam com-
plaints (and reporting) can also aid in raising public awareness to
new scams and fraudulent activities, and provide the support for
a more pro-active approach to the early detection and prevention
of fraud. Accurate and efﬁcient provision of contents from forum
sites are therefore very important, to provide information to aid
in preventive measures. In this paper, we acquire data from 6
popular and active scam reporting forums with varying ages
(from 1.07 to 9.45 years old). We then carry out an analysis to
investigate the ability to extract posts detailing victims’ encounter
with scams and fraud, based on the coverage via simple searches
on speciﬁc keywords and keyword combinations. We also carry
out an evaluation of the merchant coverage in each forum and
investigate the association of keywords to support future reliable
informative data provision from both topic-speciﬁc, and generic
forums and online sources.
Index Terms—Fraud detection, fraudulent merchant, fraudu-
lent activity analysis, scam, complaint, forum.
I. INTRODUCTION
The widespread use and contributions of knowledge in the
form of data uploaded to the Internet has made it a wealthy
source of information for any conceivable topics. One of the
most important platforms on the Web is the online forums.
Online web forums’ dynamically increasing contents, which is
contributed by millions of Internet users on a daily basis, has
led to its increasing richness of information. Its widespread
popularity is its facilitation of global, convenient, fast and
freely open discussions. Therefore, web forum data is an
accumulation of a vast collection of updated human knowledge
and viewpoints. Forums can thus be a highly valuable source
of online information for knowledge acquisition to build up
domain expertise [1], improve business intelligence [2], [3],
[4], and early detection of the presence (and study) of extremist
activities [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
In [5], the authors proposed a framework for Web forum
data integration to support the analysis of interactions among
discussion participants. The targetted forums were Jihadist fo-
rums. The authors introduced features such as forum browsing
and searching, multi-lingual translation and social network
visualization in their work to support the early detection of
extremism activities.
In [7], the authors carried out an analysis of U.S. and
Middle Eastern extremist group forums. An affect lexicon
based on probabilistic disambiguation technique was proposed
to measure the presence of hate and violence related words
in the forums’ contents. The authors concluded that a strong
linear relationship exists between the usages of hate and
violence related words in the Middle Eastern extremist group
forums.
In [8], the authors evaluated the usage of stylistic and
syntactic features for the sentiment classiﬁcation of English
and Arabic contents in Web forums. The authors concluded
that the stylistic features and their proposed entropy weighted
genetic algorithm (incorporating information-gain heuristic for
feature selection) could signiﬁcantly enhance the sentiment
classiﬁcation.
In [3], the authors conducted an experimental study by
asking consumers to gather online information on a spe-
ciﬁc product topic by accessing Web forums. The authors
concluded that consumers who acquired information from
online forum discussions reported a greater interest in the
selected product topic than those who acquired information
from marketer-generated sources.
In [4], the authors proposed a scoring technique to evaluate
speciﬁc product reviews and to summarize the opinions of the
product to the user. The methodology enables the user to save
time on reading all the reviews and at the same time, arrive
at a generic opinion of a product based on the reviews posted
on Web forums.
In [9], the authors proposed incorporating message content
similarity and response immediacy to measure the degree of
inﬂuence between any two users on Web forums. To ensure
an accurate approach of measurement, the authors proposed
the design of weight application and integration to the typical
user link analysis technique. The evaluation of the proposed
algorithms was carried out using the ACM Intelligence and
Security Informatics KDD challenge to show the potential in
identifying inﬂuential users.
However, there is no existing work which looks at the
analysis of fraudulent and scam related activity reporting
forums. Due to the important information they can provide,
we think it is necessary to be equipped with an understanding
of fraudulent and scam related activity reporting forums.
Therefore, in this work, we cover the analysis of fraudulent
and scam related activity reporting forums by collecting and
analysing a set of popular forums that provide a platform for
consumers to report their encounters as victims of scams and
frauds. Our work will enable a better understanding of such
forums to support the raising of public awareness to new scams
and fraudulent activities in the wild, and the early detection of
216

such activities and potential merchants/companies involvement
or association.
There are existing works in the area of forum crawling [10],
[11], [12], [13], [14] and its content extraction [15], [16], [17],
[18], [19]. In this work, we focus on forum content analysis,
speciﬁcally in scam reporting forums. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work which carries out an analysis
of forum data on fraudulent and scam related activities.
Our main contributions in this paper are:
1) the collection of complete fraudulent and scam related
activity reporting posts from active forums ranging from
the age of 1.07 to 9.45 years
2) the generation of keywords relevant to fraudulent and
scam related activities from the preliminary analysis of
online sources of incidents reporting
3) the preparation of the list of companies reported in the
scambook forum
4) the analysis of the forums and evaluation of the ability
to detect posts detailing fraudulent and scam related ac-
tivities and events, based on i) our single keyword based
analysis, and ii) keyword combination based analysis
5) the evaluation of the merchants (or companies) coverage
in each forum, and the investigation of keyword associ-
ation with each merchant
This work will be valuable in i) providing an in-depth under-
standing of current popular forum sites related to fraudulent
and scam related activity reporting, ii) enabling us to make
recommendations based on the ﬁndings from this research, and
iii) generating top relevant keywords as supporting features to
detect merchants and activities related to fraud and scams in
both topic-speciﬁc and generic online sources.
The rest of the paper is organised as follow. In Section II,
we describe our target forums and carry out a preliminary
analysis to obtain useful statistics. In Section III, we propose
the analysis of the forum post data/content based on our
generated keyword list, and present and discuss our results. In
Section IV, we extract companies’ names from the scambook
forum, propose the procedural steps to clean the list to prevent
high false positives and false negatives during detection, and
analyse the coverage of these companies in each forum. We
also investigate the association of keywords with each of
these companies based on the post contents in the forums. In
Section V, we provide the recommendations to improve the
applicability and usefulness of the forums in raising public
awareness to new scams, and to support the early detection
of fraudulent merchants and activities, so as to enable a more
pro-active approach in the handling of fraud and scams. We
summarise the important ﬁndings in Section VI.
II. COLLECTION OF DATA FROM SCAM REPORTING
FORUMS
For our forum analysis research, we collect the contents
from the following 6 scam reporting forums, namely ex-
poseascam [20], realscam [21],scambaits [22], scambook [23],
scamfound [24], and scamvictimsunited [25]. These forums
allow users to post reports and complaints of their encounter
with scam related incidents. We analyse the dates of the posts
in the collected contents to obtain the ﬁrst date of the post
(i.e., a forum’s start date) and the last date of the post (till
the end date of our retrieval of all the posts from each forum)
per forum, and compute their ages. However, an older age
does not imply that a forum is more active. We extract the
total threads and posts we ﬁnd in each forum, and present
the information together with the forum’s age in Table I. We
notice that the age of the forums differs very widely. We also
notice that the activeness (i.e., the average threads/posts per
day/week/month, and the gaps between no posting activity) of
the forums differs too. Therefore, when conducting analysis in
the subsequent sections, we will carry out normalization for a
fair analysis when necessary.

III. KEYWORD BASED ANALYSIS
To analyse the forum contents, we ﬁrst generate a list
of keywords to identify the applicability of scam related
keywords in the detection of posts that provide details on the
relevant incidents. From our observation of scam reports and
consumer complaints online, we notice that the 28 keywords
in Table II are often used. Therefore, we generate the list of
keywords based on Table II for the keyword based analysis of
the collected forums’ data.

TABLE II: Keyword List
Based on the keyword list, we analyse the forums’ data
and identify the posts that contain any of the keyword/s. Each
word (separated by at least a word delimiter such as a space,
tab, comma, full stop) is extracted from the post contents and
a strict matching (i.e., not substring) with the keywords is
applied. The keyword matching against the contents of the
posts also provides us with the posts that are closely related
to scam activities, for further analysis.
Next, we analyse the frequency of keywords found in the
above identiﬁed posts. We analyse the posts to evaluate the
keyword frequency by returning the post count for each key-
word. In addition, we consider the large deviation in the forum
sizes (i.e., number of threads/posts) and activeness, and thus
217

ICDS 2014 : The Eighth International Conference on Digital Society

carry out a normalization of the keyword frequency against
the total posts per forum, to present the percentage of the
identiﬁed posts containing each keyword per forum, in Table
III. Note that each post may contain more than one keyword.
Therefore, the total percentage per forum may be over 100%.
We also compute and show the average normalized frequency
of each keyword across all the forums. We observe that the top
10 keywords, in decreasing order according to their respective
average normalized keyword frequency percentage, are scam,
fee, fraud, damage, charge, rip, bill, refund, transaction, and
liar. We can also see that 94.99% to 100% of the detected
posts contain the keyword “scam” across all the 6 forums.
Next, we investigate the applicability and frequency of the
combinations of keywords in the detection of scam related
activities. We identify posts with contents that match any
combination of the 28 keywords, and compute the number of
posts matching a strict keyword combination (i.e., if the post
content contains 3 different keywords, the post count will be
incremented by 1 for this 3-keyword combination only. This
computation is different from the 1-keyword based analysis
where a post having 2 different keyword matches will have
each post count incremented by 1 for each speciﬁc keyword.
The keyword combination based analysis also ignores the
order of the keyword appearance in the post contents.). We
then extract the top 10 keyword combinations (based on the
post counts) for each forum. To give a better view of the
coverage of the detected posts on scam related activities based
on each top keyword combination, we compute the normalized
coverage in terms of percentage. The normalization is carried
out over the total number of detected posts with any keyword
occurrence.
The normalized coverage provided by the top 10 keyword
combinations is shown in Table IV, with the total normalized
coverage percentage for each forum shown in the last row of
each sub-table (in bold). We observe from Table IV that with
our chosen list of keywords, the top 10 keyword combination
can identify 65.60% to 93.55% of the posts related to fraud-
ulent and scam activities.
IV. COMPANY BASED ANALYSIS
In this section, we analyse each forum based on their
ability to identify popular companies mentioned in scam
reporting forums. We retrieve the popular company list from
the scambook forum. The scambook forum provides a list of
the most popular companies based on their site’s post data.
We retrieve the list of 1986 company names but notice that
the list contains several names that may potentially generate
high false positives (and false negatives) in our analysis results.
Therefore, before we proceed, we clean up the company list
according to the following steps (with real examples given
from the original company list from the scambook forum).
1) Remove names with only numeric characters (e.g. 2012)
2) Remove all 1-character names
3) Remove all 2-character names if they contain only
alphabetic characters (e.g. UK, SG, OK)
4) Remove trailing words if they are location name follow-
ing a company name (e.g. “, London”, “, Oxford”) so
that posts reporting a company in another location can
also be detected
5) Remove trailing words if they are in short form and
depict the company’s liability or taxation type (e.g. Int’l,
Ltd, LLP, Co, Inc, LLC)
6) Remove top level domain name if the company name is
distinct enough without it (that is, do not remove the top
level domain name if the company name is for example,
cars.com or lends.net)
Other than cleaning up the company list by removing the
less effective detection terms, we also generate new company
names based on sub-string extraction of long company names
if the original company names are too speciﬁc and may
potentially results in high false negatives. An example is
“Gameest Int’l Network Sales” where we additionally create
another company name in the list for “Gameest”. The ﬁnal list
contains 2019 company names.
As with the keyword based analysis, we also carry out a
strict form of matching for the company based analysis. In
addition, since we are carrying out the company based anal-
ysis using the company names generated from the scambook
forum, we exclude this forum from some experiments in this
section to remove the unfair bias in the analysis and evaluation.
First, we carry out an investigation on the number of
company names that are reported in the post contents in each
forum, and present the results in Table V.
We observe that there is no major overlap between the
other forums and the scambook’s existing reported companies,
with the exception of the scamfound forum. 47.60% of the
companies in the scambook forum can be seen as reported
in the scamfound forum. To better analyse and conclude on
the quality of the forums, it is necessary to understand if
the other forums do detect other additional companies not
included in the scambook forum’s list (i.e., not reported by
scambook members and users). However, the other forums do
not provide a company name list compilation. A fair evaluation
and comparison of all the forums should be carried out if such
lists are provided in future.
Next, we identify the posts in each forum that report the
companies in our list and compute the number of posts for
each company per forum. We then identify the top 20 detected
company names in each forum based on the number of posts
reporting them. We observe from the results that some detected
company names are not exactly distinctive as a company
name. Some obvious examples are “not sure”, “personal”,
“unknown” and “individual”. It is important to note that if
forums are to provide company name lists to aid in the
detection of fraudulent and scam related activities, they need
to be better maintained and cleaned up. Provision of such lists
will be very useful in raising the awareness on the fraudulent
merchants to look out for.
Another interesting observation from the results is the de-
tection of legitimate companies such as McDonalds, Walmart

and Apple, with a high number of reported cases (i.e., in terms
of the number of posts). A highly probable reason is the use
of these legitimate platforms and their resources by scammers
and fraudulent merchants to carry out scam related activities
(e.g., advertising). In the case where these companies offer
legitimate and highly popular products, the reports may also
be associated with counterfeit products being advertised or
sold as legitimate ones by the fraudulent merchants.
Other than that, we also observe that some companies are
actually reported to be directly linked to complaints of scams
and fraudulent activities. Some examples are C2 and C15 (as
shown in Table VI), which have been reported in the forums
to be associated with feedbacks such as delivering skin-care
products that caused serious negative reactions, charging cus-
tomers’ credit cards without authorization, and/or recursively,
or that they are uncontactable for feedback/refund thereafter.
Next, we carry out an analysis to identify the keywords
associated with a selected set of the detected companies. By
“associated”, we do not mean that the keywords are indicative
of the description of the company’s activities. We mean that
the keywords as well as the company name are within the
contents of a same post.
For the company name and associated keyword analysis, we
eliminate detected companies which do not have distinctive
company names, or are well-established legitimate, high set-
up cost companies, ﬁnancial institutions and multi-national
companies. We notice that the remaining companies are mainly
online merchants or shops associated with multi-level market-
ing, pharmaceutical products, dating/matchmaking, advertis-
ing, etc. We extract the top keyword combination associated
with each selected company name from each forum, consol-
idate them across all the forums, and present the selected
companies from the top 20 detected companies and the as-
sociated keywords (as found in the post contents) in Table VI.
In this table, company names are modiﬁed to preserve their
identities as the objective of this analysis is simply to identify
useful keywords associated with companies being ﬂagged or
complaint against.
While searching for the top keyword combination for the
selected companies in the forums, we notice that even though
some companies are not in the top 20 results of some forums,
they do exist within the forums’ post contents. We compile
a list to indicate the presence or absence of the selected
companies within each forum, and present the results in Table
VI. Since the company list is generated from the scambook
forum, it is excluded from this analysis.
From Table VI, we can see that there is a signiﬁcant
overlap in the presence of the detected top companies among
the forums. However, the total overlap for most companies
is minimal in some forums. Therefore, to enable a better
detection of the fraudulent and scam related merchants and
activities, we should rely on the detection results from multiple
sources and carry out correlations, to obtain a better detection
accuracy with a low false positive rate. There is also a need
to eliminate false positives due to the wide presence of well-
known legitimate sources. This elimination can be through
a whitelist conﬁguration and should only be implemented
when it is deﬁnite that these companies do not provide
resources that may be exploited by fraudulent merchants and
scammers. However, a scenario that may not be avoidable is
when scammers exploit the well-established reputation of such
legitimate companies and use these company names to carry
out malicious activities such as scamming and phishing.
V. DISCUSSION
Based on this research and the observations, an impor-
tant recommendation is the need for the provision of well-
maintained fraudulent merchants or company list by scam
reporting forums. The availability of this resource will enhance
the value of these forums and fulﬁll their main purpose in
providing readers with valuable information on the fraudulent
merchants and scams to avoid. In addition, such lists and
information could also be used by companies providing e-
payment services to monitor the on-going status and reputation
of their registered merchants, so as to take immediate action
in the event of any violation of their terms and policies.
As our work is to investigate the possibility to raise public
awareness to scams and fraud, and to enable the early detection
of such malicious activities in the wild, it is necessary to ensure
the quality of the detected results to prevent false triggering
for investigations. The ﬁrst and most important step would be
to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the information
from the online sources and forums. Scam reporting forums
can incorporate moderation of the posts submitted to their
forums to ensure that they are accurate through the provision
of concrete supporting evidence (e.g. legal incident report,
transaction statement) from the incident reporting user. This
step may incur an additional overhead but is essential in
ensuring the quality of the data in the forum.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have carried out a fraudulent and scam
related activity reporting forum data analysis. We collected the
posts from 6 popular and active scam reporting forums, and
generated a list of relevant keywords based on our preliminary
analysis and knowledge of online sources on scam incident
reporting. We then carried out an investigation on the ability
to detect posts relevant to fraud and scams based on different
keyword-based analysis scenario. We showed through our
analysis that the choice of a single keyword can have an
average coverage of 99.15% of the posts. However, the single
keyword based detection can result in high false positives

TABLE VI: Detected Individual Company and Associated Keywords in Post Contents, and Evidence of Presence of Detected
Companies in Forums
when the detection feature is applied to generic online source.
Therefore, we investigated the different keyword combinations
and showed that the identiﬁcation and selection of the top
10 keyword combinations is sufﬁcient to support 65.60% to
93.55% coverage of the posts in the forums. We also evaluated
the coverage of companies in the forums and investigated
the association of keywords with each company. Our results
showed that the merchant coverage in the forums is sufﬁciently
wide for the identiﬁed popular companies. Based on our
ﬁndings, we proposed some important recommendations to
improve and enhance the applicability of forums and online
sources in raising public awareness to new scams and fraud,
and the early detection and prevention of such incidents to
new potential victims.
