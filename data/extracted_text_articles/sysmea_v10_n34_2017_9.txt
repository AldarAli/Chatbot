Abstract—In agriculture, the chemicals should be applied evenly
and at a prescribed rate. An accurately calibrated boom will en-
sure that this is achieved. In addition, the correct use of pesticides
can deliver signiﬁcant environmental and socio-economic beneﬁts
in the form of safe, healthy, and affordable food, as well as to
decrease the impact in natural resources such as soil, water and
overall land use. The quality of pesticides application is dependent
on the hydraulic ﬂuidic resistance present in the nozzles of the
sprayers. This paper presents a method to evaluate the hydraulic
pressure drop in bars of agricultural sprayer systems using the
ﬂuid hydraulic resistance as a part of a sensor element associated
with point-wise Thévenin’s equivalents. This method makes it
possible to control and measure the pressure drop at lower
cost and greater accuracy. In this context, taking into account
a measurement-based approach, a parameterized relationship
among operating conditions and the ﬂuidic resistance was deﬁned.
Therefore, it was possible to obtain the hydraulic equivalents of a
sprayer system with direct injection based only on the hydraulic
ﬂow and pressure measurements. The results have shown that
it is possible to obtain the hydraulic equivalent resistances with
a relative error equal to 2.15%. Furthermore, the relationship
among the oriﬁce nozzle diameter, pressure and ﬂow was also
found.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, hydraulic systems can be found in a wide vari-
ety of applications, including agriculture. For such systems it is
important to determine the internal losses occurring not only
for the set up of upstream and downstream pressure valves,
but also to calculate the ﬂow rates through piping systems.
In this context, the ﬂuid hydraulic resistance from the nozzles
used in the agricultural sprayers plays an important role. A
previous discussion related to such content was presented in
[1]. In addition, such information can assist in establishing the
ﬂow rate range associated with pumps, compressors, turbines,
and relief headers to ensure that back pressure on the relief
devices does not prevent them from functioning properly [2].
Pesticide application is a vital component for food security,
and production is directly connected to pest control. Agricul-
tural sprayers are used to apply liquid chemicals on plants to
control pests and diseases. In addition, it can be used to apply
herbicides to control weeds and to apply fertilizers to enhance
plants growth. There are many types of sprayers commercially
available to producers designed for their own speciﬁc functions
and use. One may ﬁnd backpack sprayers, hand compression
sprayers, self-propelled sprayers, aerial sprayers, and pull-
behind sprayers, among others.
The manual application method was the ﬁrst to be used
in agriculture, but it has the disadvantage that it presents a
higher risk to humans. On the other hand, turning off sprayers
when there is no target, or adjusting application rates based
on canopy size and density became essential for production
with sustainability, that is, in such matters the automated
sprayers play an important role. Close to the 90’s, manu-
facturers introduced precision spraying technology in boom
sprayers [3]. Despite being still an open ﬁeld for research and
innovation, the variable rate methods, using the Global Position
System (GPS) and the Geographic Information System (GIS)
technologies were integrated into boom sprayers and became
already commercially available.
The adoption of precision agriculture (PA) for localized
application of agrochemicals can reduce pesticide wastage and
environmental aggression, providing a more efﬁcient produc-
tion of large-scale food and increasing agricultural produc-
tivity. With localized application of agrochemicals, herbicide
savings is in the order of 30 to 80% compared to the uniform
application in the total area. Automatic sprayers designed and
developed for localized application are currently available,
allowing the use of large volume of syrup, covering large
agricultural areas [4]–[7].
In this ﬁeld of knowledge, there are the use of conventional
and direct injection sprayer systems. The ﬁrst type of direct
injection system was developed between the 70’s and 80’s.
However, in that time such a system presented high cost,
complexity of operation and low performance. According to

Baio and Antuniassi [6], the main characteristic of direct
injection systems is related to the storage of the diluent (water)
and pesticide in separate containers.
The mixing of pesticides and water is carried out only
at the time of application, by injection of the pesticide into
the piping, which carries the syrup to the nozzles of the
sprayer. The amount of injected pesticide can be accomplished,
among other ways, by controlling the rotation of the piston
or peristaltic injection pumps. The main advantages of the
injection system are the reduction of risks involved during the
application process [8].
Other aspects one should take into account, in relation to
this matter, is the beneﬁt/cost rate in terms of the use of energy
in the agricultural machinery. Most ﬂuid energy systems are
conﬁgured with a positive ﬂow displacement pump that is
large enough to meet the ﬂow requirements of many circuits.
Different work functions require a variety of ﬂow and pressure
values to provide the desired operation. Branches of the system
therefore must include speciﬁc ﬂow and pressure regulating
valves.
This paper presents a method based on a measurement
approach to evaluate the hydraulic pressure drop in booms of
agricultural sprayer systems using the ﬂuid hydraulic resistance
as part of a sensor element associated with a point-wise
Thévenin’s equivalent measurement method.
The next sections of the paper are organized as follows.
In Section II the concepts of spraying quality and ﬂuidic
resistance are given. In Section III, the theoretical background
for the understanding of the parameterized input-output model
and the theoretical development of the measurement based
approach for unknown systems and the analog models be-
tween the electrical and hydraulic circuits to obtain point-wise
hydraulic Thévenin’s equivalent are studied. Subsequently,
in Section IV, the method used to obtain the internal loss,
pressure equivalents and the function relating the nozzle oriﬁce
diameter and pressure with the ﬂow in a full cone nozzle is
given. In Section V, the experimental validation of both the
nozzle ﬂow in terms of operating conditions and the point-
wise Thévenin’s equivalents using a laboratory sprayer setup
are performed. Finally, some concluding remarks are presented
in Section VI.

AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING QUALITY
As the ﬂuid moves inside a pipe occur a turbulence of the
ﬂuid with itself and a ﬂuid friction with the inner walls of
this pipe. This causes the pressure inside the pipe to gradually
decrease as the ﬂuid moves. The pressure decrease is known
as the pressure drop. In this way, the load loss would be
related to a resistance to the passage of the ﬂow of the ﬂuid
inside the pipe. This resistance is known as ﬂuidic resistance
and directly affects the volumetric ﬂow [9], [10]. Moreover,
the ﬂuid hydraulic resistance is subject to temporal variations
requiring a considerable effort to be determined. In Figure 1
it can be observed the functioning of a full cone nozzle and
the characterization of a ﬂuidic resistance.
In the process of agricultural spraying, it is of great
importance to know the value of the ﬂuidic resistance of the
spray boom since variations in this resistance can affect the
quality of the application, that is, size and volume of drops,
distribution of drops on the crop and the drift of the drops
produced by the wind [11].
Figure 1. Representation of a hydraulic full cone nozzle where for a given
ﬂow rate there is a pressure drop caused by the ﬂuidic resistance, which is
related to the internal mechanical characteristics of this nozzle.
Therefore, the value of the ﬂuidic resistance as well as
its behavior as a function of the operating conditions yield
relevant information to infer the quality of the pesticides
application. Droplet size and its distribution are critical factors
in such processes because can affect the penetration, coverage
and drift of the application on the crop [12].
The design of a hydraulic system can be improved with
the use of mathematical simulation. Numerous approaches to
energy systems modeling ﬂuids and components can be found
in the literature. Analysis of a ﬂuid feed system can cover
the ﬂow distribution, the functioning of components, or a
combination of both. Most of the useful equations for ﬂuid
analysis are derived from the law of conservation of energy,
the principle of continuity, and Newton’s second law [13].
Equations used to calculate ﬂow in circuits involve the
use of empirical expressions or laboratory-derived ﬂow co-
efﬁcients. Therefore, when two or more circuits are used
simultaneously, the principle of continuity may not be obeyed
exactly, because of the use of such empirical coefﬁcients.
To determine the desired pressure and ﬂow values, a set of
equations can be solved via an iterative method. Iterative meth-
ods work well under steady state ﬂow conditions. However,
they are difﬁcult to apply under non-steady state operations.
In relation to this subject Akers and collaborators proposed
a method based on electrical-hydraulic analogy [9]. In such
method, the ﬂuid pressure, the ﬂow, and the ﬂuidic resistance
are analogous to voltage, current, and electrical resistance,
respectively. The method uses the basic principle of Ohm’s
law, also referred to as the hydraulic Ohm.
In this scenario, a sensor that can measure the internal
losses of the hydraulic boom in sprayers is very much required.
The boom pressure drop denoted ∆P can be related to the
volumetric ﬂow rate denoted Q by:
∆P = fa

for a ﬂat tube with laminar ﬂow, where fa is the coefﬁcient
of friction [dimensionless], ρ is the speciﬁc mass of the ﬂuid
[kg/m3], L is the equivalent pipe length [m], D is the internal
diameter of the pipe [m], A is the inner area of the straight
section of the pipe [m2] and µ is the absolute viscosity of the
ﬂuid [Pa · s].
The coefﬁcient of friction fa, sometimes known as a
Moody friction factor or also as a distributed load loss co-
efﬁcient determined by mathematical equations, is a function
of the Reynolds number and relative roughness. Experimental
identiﬁcation of fa is more common due to the non linear
characteristics involved. For pipes that undergo changes in
pipe diameters, in general, ﬂow type or over-curves, the ﬂuidic
resistance denoted R may be related to the pressure drop as:
√
∆P = RQ.

For a tube, the ﬂuidic resistance is given by:
R =

For a nozzle (Fig 1), the ﬂuidic resistance is given by:
R =

CdA
(5)
where the unitless Cd is the discharge coefﬁcient. The dis-
charge coefﬁcient of an oriﬁce atomizer is governed in part
by the pressure losses undergoing at the ﬂow passages of the
nozzle and also by the extent to which the liquid ﬂows through
the ﬁnal discharge oriﬁce diameter denoted d [mm] [14].
In addition, the pressure drop and the outlet oriﬁce diameter
affects the size of the droplets in the spray [15]. In Figure 2, it
can be observed the volume median diameter of the drops de-
noted V MD [µm] inﬂuenced by the diameter of the discharge
oriﬁce d.
Figure 2. Relationship between the diameter of the nozzle oriﬁce d and the
mean diameter of the drops, which where simulated for different values of
exit velocity Vl in [m/s] for a full cone nozzle (ﬁgure extracted from [15] ).
The output velocity of the mixture Vl [m/s] is also shown
in Fig. 2. This velocity depends on the pressure and ﬂow of
the liquid in the nozzle.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
In this section the theoretical background of the param-
eterized input-output model and the point-wise Thévenin’s
equivalent are presented.
A. A Parameterized Input-Output Model
In many design problems there is a set of parameters
denoted by a vector p, whose inﬂuence on the output is
important to know. The parameters of interest in this work
are the oriﬁce diameter, drop pressure, and the Thévenin’s
equivalent ﬂuidic resistance.
For easy reference, in this section it is describe the main
results used in this work following [16]. Consider a linear,
parameterized, input-output in matrix form:
A(p)x
=
Bu
y
=
C(p)x + Du
(6)
where A, B, C, D are matrices of size n×n, n×r, n×m and
m × r, respectively and, y, u, x and p denotes the m-output
vector, r-input vector, n-state vector and ℓ-parameter vector,
respectively. With z ≜ (x y)′, (6) can be written as:
T(p) z =

B
−D

u where T(p) ≜

A(p)
0
C(p)
−I

.
Let
Tij(p) ≜

A(p)
bj
ci(p)
−dij

, i = 1, · · · , m, j = 1, · · · , r
(7)
with ci(p), i = 1, · · · , m being the i-th row of C(p), bj, j =
1, · · · , r the j-th column of B, dij the ij-th element of D,
and
βij(p) ≜ |Tij(p)|, α(p) ≜ |T(p)|.
(8)
For the model (6), the outputs can be determined in terms
of inputs and parameters. This is established below using the
results given in [17] and [18]. The following assumptions are
needed to establish the results.
Assumption 1: The parameter p appears afﬁnely in A(p)
and C(p):
A(p) = A0 + p1A1 + · · · + pℓAℓ
C(p) = C0 + p1C1 + · · · + pℓCℓ.
(9)
Assumption 2:
|T(p)| ̸= 0, p ∈ P.
(10)
Theorem 1: For system (6), the output is given by
yi =
r
X
j=1
βij(p)
α(p) uj, i = 1, 2, · · · , m
(11)
with βij(p) and α(p) as already deﬁned.
To describe the solution y from (6), one can use a form
for the functions α(p) and βij(p).
Lemma 1: Let A(p) = A0 + p1A1 + · · · + pℓAℓ with
rank (Ai) = ri, i = 1, 2, · · · , ℓ. Then α(p) = |A(p)|
is a multivariate polynomial in p, of degree at most ri in
pi, i = 1, 2, · · · , ℓ.
Now consider (7) written in polynomial form:
Tij(p) = Tij0 + p1Tij1 + · · · + pℓTijℓ.
(12)
186

Applying Lemma 1, one can see that
|Tij| = βij(p)
(13)
is a multivariate polynomial in p of degree at most rijk in pk
where
rijk = rank(Tijk),
(14)
with i = 1, 2, · · · , m, j = 1, 2, · · · , r, k = 1, 2, · · · , ℓ.
Then, it can be shown that the determinants of multivariate
polynomials in p can be written as:
|A(p)| =
rℓ
X
iℓ=0
· · ·
r1
X
i1=0
αi1···iℓpi1
1 · · · piℓ
ℓ
(15)
with rank (Ai) = ri, i = 1, 2, · · · , ℓ. In the form of (15), the
number of coefﬁcients in |A(p)| is µ ≜ Pℓ
i=1(ri + 1). The
following example shows the use of the rank of the matrices
Ai, i = 1, 2, · · · , m to obtain the determinant of a multivariate
polynomial in p.
Example 1: Let
A(p) =
" 1
2p1
0
p1
p2
p1
3
p1
3p2
#
.
(16)
As the parameter p appears afﬁnely in A(p), following (1),
one can write
A(p) =
"1
0
0
0
0
0
3
0

0
#
p1 +
"0

0

0
3
#
p2.
In this example, rank(A1) = 2, rank(A2) = 2. Matrix A(p)
is said to be rank 2 with respect to p1 and p2, which yields
r1 = 2 and r2 = 2. Thus,
|A(p)| =
2
X
i2=0
2
X
i1=0
αi1i2pi1
1 pi2
2
is a polynomial of degree at most 2 in both p1 and p2.
Calculating the determinant, it yields
|A(p)| = −6p2
1p2 + 5p2
1 + 3p2
2.
Now consider (7) written in polynomial form:
Tij(p) = Tij0 + p1Tij1 + · · · + pℓTijℓ.
Applying Lemma 1, one can see that
|Tij| = βij(p)
is a multivariate polynomial in p of degree at most rijk in pk
where
rijk = rank(Tijk), i = 1, 2, · · · , m
j = 1, 2, · · · , r, k = 1, 2, · · · , ℓ
and its determinant can be described in a similar manner as in
(15).
B. A Measurement Based Approach To Unknown Systems
The solution (11) suggests that knowledge of the functions
α(p) and βij(p) are sufﬁcient to determine the behavior of
the outputs yi as a function of p and u [18], [19]. The
knowledge of α(p) and βij(p) reduces to the knowledge of
the coefﬁcients of these polynomial functions. In an unknown
system (black box, for instance) these coefﬁcients are unknown
a priori. However, if one can conduct tests on the system by
setting the design parameter p and input u to various values
and measuring the corresponding yi, the polynomial functions
coefﬁcients can be determined. It is possible illustrate this
concept for the special case of a single output yi with inputs
u1, u2 and parameters p = p1 for a rank one model from
Lemma 1. Here,
yi = βi1(p)
α(p) u1 + βi2(p)
α(p) u2
(17)
with
βij(p)
=
βij0 + βij1p1, j = 1, 2
α(p)
=
α0 + α1p1.
(18)
Assuming α1 ̸= 0, one may divide both the numerator and
denominator of the right hand side of (17) and write a linear
algebraic equation to ﬁnd the unknown coefﬁcients of α(p)
and βij(p) from measurements as follows.
Set u2 = 0, u1 = u∗
1 and measure yi for three different
sets of values (p1 ≜ p) to determine the coefﬁcients of α(p)
and βij(p), j = 1, 2 from the following measurement equation
with yi(k) denoting the three measurement values and p(k) the
three sets of parameters with k = 1, 2, 3:
 yi(1)
−uj(1)
−uj(1)p(1)
yi(2)
−uj(2)
−uj(2)p(2)
yi(3)

=

(19)
with j = 1, 2.
C. Thévenin’s Equivalent From The Input-Output Parameter-
ized Model
Consider a nonlinear source, connected to a linear load
named R as shown in Fig. 3.
Figure 3. Nonlinear source.
The V-I characteristic of the source is described by:
I = f(V )
(20)
where f(V ) is assumed to be a continuous and differentiable
function. The operating point (Vo, Io) of the circuit in Fig. 3
can be obtained graphically as shown in Fig. 4.

D. Point-wise Thévenin’s Equivalents
Now consider a Thévenin’s equivalent of the nonlinear
circuit described by the V-I characteristic at the operating point
(Vo, Io), which yields the characteristic line L illustrated in
Fig. 5.
Figure 5. Point-wise Thévenin’s equivalent.
The Thévenin’s equivalent circuit is represented by the
resistance denoted Rth and the voltage denoted Vth connected
as shown in Fig. 6. Thus
V = Vth − IRth

and
I = − 1

If (22) is to represent the line shown in Fig. 5, which is
tangent to f(V ) at (Vo, Io), one must have:
I = MV + C
(23)
with
M

∂I

Comparing (22) and (23) it follows that:

(25)
Thus, the Thévenin’s equivalent of the nonlinear circuit of Fig.
3 at (Vo, Io) is given by:

(26)

.
(27)
Note that the above parameters can be determined, if the
nonlinear characteristic is known, at any point (Vo, Io) and
thus a family of point-wise Thévenin’s equivalents may be
constructed. If the I = f(V ) characteristic is not known,
the Thévenin’s equivalents may be determined by estimating
the parameters of the tangent line L using a ﬁxed number of
measurements.
IV.
METHOD
It is known that the ﬂow in a nozzle is a function of the
oriﬁce diameter, drop pressure and other hydraulic parameters,
which may change with different types of nozzle. Then, it is
possible to ﬁnd a function that relates the oriﬁce diameter and
pressure with the ﬂow in a nozzle.
It is assumed that the rank of the matrices appearing in
the description of the ﬂow Q in relation to parameter d and
boom pressure ∆P is unity. According to Bhattacharyya and
collaborators [18], it is possible to ﬁnd the rational function:
Q = β0 + β1d + β2∆P + β3d∆P
α0 + α1d + α2∆P + d∆P
(28)
where β0, β1, β2, β3, α0, α1 and α2 are constants and (α0 +
α1d + α2∆P + d∆P) ̸= 0. To obtain these constants, one
should take just 7 measurements with different values of d
and ∆P and solve the following linear system:

The well known Thévenin’s equivalent circuit of a linear
circuit is composed of an equivalent impedance and voltage,
which for some cases are represented as a resistor and a source
of continuous voltage. This equivalent circuit is obtained
through Thévenin’s Theorem.
Theorem 1 (Thévenin’s Theorem): The voltage and resis-
tance equivalent of a circuit is given by:
Vth
=
Voc
(30)
Rth
=
Voc
Isc
(31)
where Isc is the short-circuit current and Voc the open circuit
voltage [20]–[23].
The Thévenin’s equivalent circuit can be represented by
Fig 6. In Fig. 6, the voltage and current are described by:
I
=
Vth
Rth + R
(32)
V
=
RI = −RthI + Vth.
(33)
Let y(1) and y(2) denote current measurements taken with
the values of the load R denoted R(1) and R(2), respectively.
According to Bhattacharyya and collaborators [18] and Mohs-
enizadeh and collaborators [19], the Thévenin’s equivalent can
also be obtained by solving the linear equation system, in terms
of α0 and β0:

y(1)
−1
y(2)
−1
 
α0
β0

=

−y(1)R(1)
−y(2)R(2)

(34)
where α0 and β0 are given by:
α0
=
Rth
(35)
β0
=
Vth.
(36)
If one is considering a linear characteristic then is possible to
write:
Voc
=
Vth
(37)
Isc
=
Vth
Rth
.
(38)
One can consider, as a further step, the electric analog al-
ready described in Section I, then V =
√
∆P e Vth = √∆Pth.
Now, let y(1) e y(2) be measures of ﬂow in the boom with

where Rth and ∆Pth are the internal loss and pressure equiva-
lent, respectively. As the behavior of pressure and ﬂow is non-
linear, then there will be more than one possible representation
of the Thévenin’s equivalent. If the measurements are taken as
close as possible to each other, it is then said that a point-wise
Thévenin’s equivalent is obtained.

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
The Agricultural Sprayer Development System (SDPA)
used to obtain experimental results is located at the Laboratory
for Precision Agricultural inputs Applications of the Embrapa
Instrumentation (Figs. 7 and 8) in São Carlos, SP, Brazil [24]–
[28]. The goal is to describe the ﬂow in function of the oriﬁce
d and pressure drop ∆P and to obtain the linear pressure and
ﬂuidic resistance equivalent by selecting a boom with nozzles
of interest using regular measurements.

The results were separated into two different experiments.
The ﬁrst experiment was performed to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients of
(28), which are related to the oriﬁce diameter and pressure in
the nozzle. The second experiment was carried out to obtain the
Thévenin’s equivalent, where the goal was to obtain the linear
pressure and the ﬂuidic resistance equivalent by selecting a
boom with nozzles of interest and using regular measurements,
which is possible by solving (34).

A. Nozzle Flow Validation
To validate (28), which relates the ﬂow to the oriﬁces
diameters, the nozzles were used. The datasheet of a nozzle
MAG CH, produced by MAGNOJET®, was used. Then it was
possible to ﬁnd the values of pressure and ﬂow for each nozzle.
The oriﬁces diameters were measured using a pachymeter. The
7 points shown in Table I were selected, which cover the entire
producer table, and were used to solve the linear system (29).
The evaluated matrix is shown in (42) and the coefﬁcients
solution are shown in Table II. With the solution of (29), it
was possible to generate the surface shown in Fig. 9.

Using Fig. 9 it is possible now to predict the ﬂow of the
nozzle given the diameter of the oriﬁce and the pressure in the
nozzle, what can help in the design of the nozzle. In Table III,
the results of the prediction using the nozzle CH1 are shown.
B. Thévenin’s Equivalent Validation
To obtain the hydraulic Thévenin equivalent, according to
the proposed methodology, only two different ﬂuidic resis-
tances are required. However, it is necessary that when the
ﬂuidic resistance changes, a signiﬁcant variation of pressure
and ﬂow occurs at the point of interest. Otherwise, if any of
these measures are kept constant, a solution does not exist.
A pressure variation, in relation to the pump pressure, of
approximately 0.1 bar at the point of interest was considered
signiﬁcant because of the inherent noise of the spray sensors.
The objective is to extract the Thévenin’s equivalent of the
central sprayer boom, which is also shown in Fig. 8. All
nozzles of the central sprayer boom are of type CH05.
1) Measurements set-up: Firstly, the central sprayer boom
had 3 spray nozzles type CH05. The pump pressure was set
to 3.5 bar and the corresponding pressure at the center boom
spray nozzles was found to be about 3.48 bar. Then, only one
of the 3 nozzles was changed to type CH3. The pressure in
the spray nozzles rose to 3.47 bar and was therefore again
considered as noise. Another attempt was made by replacing
the same nozzle by a nozzle type CH6 (which allowed the
largest ﬂow in this line). The pressure at the nozzles rose to
3.46 and was again considered as noise. Two nozzle were then
replaced by CH3 type nozzles and the pressure at the spray
nozzles was found to be 3.44 bar, again considered to be noise.
In this way, all the nozzles of the central bar were changed to
type CH3 and the pressure was equal to 3.39 bar. This pressure
drop was then considered as signiﬁcant and thus concluding
that it was necessary to change all the nozzles of the boom to
take the measurements.

To extract the Thévenin’s equivalent, only two different
nozzles were required. To validate the Thévenin’s equivalent
obtained, a third different nozzle with a intermediate ﬂuidic
resistance between the other two nozzles were used to extract
the equivalent. The resulting data are shown in Table IV.

Using (39), the following equivalent was obtained:
∆Pth = 1.85 [bar]
Rth = 0.02 [bar · min · L−1].
Thus, this equivalent was used to estimate the ﬂow of arbitrary
pressure values. The result is shown in Fig. 10. The error of
estimated ﬂow was around 2.15%.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, a measurement-based approach was used to
emulate the behavior of a sensor to allow the control quality
analyses of direct injection sprayers. With few measurement, a
ﬂow function of a full cone nozzle relating the nozzle internal
diameter and pressure were estimated. In addiction, the ﬂuidic
resistance equivalent of a piping system was obtained.
The results presented showed that using the proposed
method, one can be able to ﬁnd the relationship among the
oriﬁce diameter of the nozzles, pressure and the ﬂow for an
adjusted operation using a graphical surface inspection. In
addiction, from the point-wise ﬂuidic resistance the conditions
necessary for the correct operation of each nozzle can be
deﬁned.
The experimental results obtained were satisfactory and the
extension of this work includes the hardware implementation
of the sensor and the application of the measurement-based
approach to analyze the control quality of spray droplets in
agriculture.
