Abstract—Information and communication technology 
in the medical field has witnessed great advances at 
research level but it is still largely unapplied in routine 
clinical practice.  Technology-driven solutions, proved 
experimentally effective, are not always efficient in the 
complex health world.  Each form of innovation needs  
to be sustainable, from an economic and organizational 
points of view, if it is to progress from the prototype 
phase to become a practical element of the healthcare 
system.  A cost-benefit analysis can help establish if this 
is the case.  Here, we apply a preliminary cost-benefit 
analysis to the real-time telemedicine platform we 
developed.  It has proven successful from a diagnostic 
point of view, but how does it perform from an economic 
perspective?  Our analysis compares the overall cost of 
the platform to the economic savings made from its 
operational use - where unnecessary patients’ transfers 
are avoided. We estimate potential savings of about 66% 
of current costs.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Tele-health, when supported by solid economic and 
organizational design, can promote new care models (like 
hub-and-spoke distribution or home monitoring), fostering a 
rational and effective use of investments [1] [2] [3] [4]. 
Standard telemedicine technology proves its validity in 
several contexts, but is generally unsuitable to situations 
involving operator-dependent diagnostic techniques – it is 
not sufficient simply to store and send images, it also needs 
the timely application of specific expertise in order to 
complete the examination.  Only by providing real-time 
collaboration do the standard telemedicine technologies 
produce value. Pediatric Cardiology is one of those clinical 
discipline [5] requiring a specialized operator to obtain a 
reliable result: echocardiography is the focus of a congenital 
heart disease (CHD) evaluation, and it is only accurate when 
performed by an expert. In general, specialists in this fields 
are rare and their lack is particularly critical in some regions 
with high incidence of this kind of disease, like Sardinia - 
one of Italy’s major islands (Fig. 1): in Sardinia CHD has a 
mean incidence of 20.25%, more than twice the typical 
incidence [6] and there is a unique specialized center 
(Pediatric Cardiology Structure in Azienda Ospedaliera “G. 
Brotzu”, Cagliari [7]). As can be seen in TABLE I, the 
distances between the center and the eight main health 
districts (ASL-Azienda Sanitaria Locale), corresponding to 
the main cities (Sassari, Nuoro, Oristano, Lanusei, 
Carbonia, Olbia, Sanluri, Cagliari), are not extreme but the 
logistic infrastructure can cause critical travel time for 
patients’ life. To mitigate the high risks deriving from this 
situation, CRS4 [8] and Brotzu hospital carried out a 
research project resulting in a real-time low cost 
telemedicine platform, able to support clinicians with the 
tele-presence 
of 
a 
specialist 
in 
real-time 
during 
echocardiographic evaluations [9]. The platform developed 
allows echocardiographic exams to be performed remotely, 
without physical interaction between the patient and the 
specialist. The ultrasound analysis is operated by a third 
doctor who physically visits the patient, while the specialist 
guides the operator directly, viewing the echographic output 
and the examination scene at the same time. The system has 
proven its diagnostic value [10] and the analysis presented 
below is a preliminary evaluation of its economic 
advantages, in anticipation of a regional scale trial. 
Here, we test the hypothesis that the use of our real-time 
telemedicine platform is economically beneficial for both 
the Sardinian health service and patients by comparing the 
system’s cost to that of savings to be made in patient 
transport - a very specific but substantial aspect.  At this 
preliminary stage, we do not attempt an assessment in terms 
of quality of care – the necessary data are not yet available.  
Similarly, at this stage, a cost-utility or cost-effectiveness 
analysis, as recommended by literature [11][12][13], is not 
attempted.  Nevertheless, this preliminary cost-benefit study 
gives some indicators for the future implementation of the 
system in real clinical life. The Material and Methods 
section describes the system workflow and the approach for 
cost evaluation analysis, which lead to the estimate 
summarized in the Results section and discussed in the 
Discussion and Conclusions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 
To evaluate the cost-benefit of our telemedicine system, 
we consider the route from the unique centre of 
specialization in Cagliari to nine secondary hospitals - one 
per Sardinian health district (ASL), plus another hospital in 
Cagliari (AO).  Below we outline the method of evaluation. 
 
A. Cost-benefit analysis: approach  
 
We take a societal perspective, highlighting cost and 
benefits deriving from the use of the system both for health 
system and for patients – but only in terms of travel savings, 
since our system is not currently operational so we are yet to 
measure benefits in terms of effectiveness. The analysis is 
based on a cost comparison during the year 2012 considered 
with and without the system. 
Currently, patients suspected of CHD are sent to Cagliari 
(Brotzu Hospital), by their General Practitioner (GP) or, in 
emergencies, sent directly by other hospitals, often by 
ambulance. A specialized visit then occurs to confirm CHD, 
or not.  Visits that do not confirm CHD are indicated as 
unnecessary below.  TABLE II details the consultations 
claimed by health structures or by GP (for outpatients).  We 
enumerate the former category into both necessary and 
unnecessary visits – but lack the data to do the same for 
outpatients consultations. 
With the presence of the telemedicine system, the main 
costs are those related exclusively to the system set-up and 
maintenance, while the main economic benefits consist in the 
savings due to avoiding patient transfers to Cagliari: the 
patients could be first visited in their health district and then 
only urgent cases sent to the main center. Therefore, the 
economic benefits are: 
 
for the patient, in saving the cost of all transfers 
required for outpatient consultations; 
 
for the health structures, in saving the cost of 
transfers at first considered to be urgent but 
revealed as unnecessary.   
 
These costs may be evaluated by this equation:

Ct = team cost (only in case of ambulance) 
Cf = fuel cost 
Mf = medium fuel usage 
Cu = fixed cost of usage 
D = distance 
T = time 
Mn= nth member of ambulance team 
 
When transfer is by ambulance, both the terms Cv 
and Ct are present, since both vehicle and the team have 
associated costs - which vary according to the specific 
conditions. 
D and T are the values of distance and time, respectively, 
taken from TABLE I. 
The term Cf is calculated as the average fuel 
(diesel and gasoline) costs in Italy in 2012, published by 
Italian Economic Development Ministry [15][16].

B. The Platform: Description and cost evaluation 
A suspected CHD case may be detected either by a GP 
or a health structure: with our telemedicine system in use, 
the patient is to be sent to the closest secondary center with 
a teleconsultation station. The workflow has three main 
parts, depicted in Fig. 2: 
1. scheduling: the secondary center, according to the 
tertiary/specialist 
center 
availability, 
requires 
the 
teleconsultation (step 1 and 2 in Fig.2); 
2. teleconsultation: the specialist accepts the request and 
starts the remote visit, interacting in real-time with the 
operator at the secondary center (step 3 and 4 in Fig.2); 
3. reporting: the specialist saves the digital diagnosis in a 
structured report which becomes immediately available 
to the doctor who performed the test and to the patient 
(step 5 in Fig.2). 
 
From the software point of view, the system is open-
source and composed of a portable application for the 
sonographer, a desktop application for the specialist and a 
web application for managing scheduling and patient 
information (clinical data and reports). As for hardware, the 
platform requires a central server, a laptop for the specialist 
and, for each center requiring teleconsultation, a network 
camera (to record the examination scene), an encoder 
(directly connected to the echograph) and a mobile device 
like an Apple iPod touch (to enable the communication 
between the clinicians through a VOIP audio chat). So, from 
the hardware point of view, the system costs are the sum of 
these items. 
 
 
Figure  2 – System basic workflow. 
 
The costs are based on market prices: the estimate for 
the server is based on the idea of using a clustered virtual 
machine [14]. There are no additional costs for the network 
infrastructure: the system is designed to take advantage of 
preexisting networks and it doesn’t need dedicated 
connections, requiring only 2.5MBps bandwidth. Each 
center has its own existing general purpose communication 
infrastructure so no additional costs are incurred during the 
development of the telemedicine intervention system due to 
such communication. 
Moreover, each center has an IT department and the 
maintenance of the system can be easily incorporated in the 
routine maintenance of the other systems already running in 
each center. The platform does not require specific 
knowledge to be used by the clinicians once they have had a 
few hours training experience. TABLE III summarizes the 
costs for the telemedicine system.

C. Transfer costs analysis: healthcare system perspective 
Adopting our telemedicine system ought to enable the 
specialist in Cagliari to see the patient nearer the onset of 
suspected CHD, allowing the patient to be transferred for 
therapy at an earlier stage.  
It is hard to quantify a priori the advantage of such 
prompt intervention, but we can evaluate the savings in 
transfer cost.  We have no hard data whether transport cost 
are incurred by health service (ambulance transfer) or by 
patient (own car) so we consider the costs in each case, 
supposing either transfer via ambulance or via a “standard” 
car. As the costs for medical and private vehicle transfer are 
not directly available, we estimate them using equation (1), 
taking into account both the cost of the vehicle and the cost 
of the team. 
For the evaluation of the medical vehicle costs we 
consider a series of 10 vehicles on the market [18], 
obtaining for each of them an estimate of our term Cu [17] 
and  term Mf. 
For the evaluation of the team costs, we consider five kinds 
of team, composed by: 
 
A1 – driver and nurse on duty; 
 
A2 - driver and nurse on call; 
 
B1 – driver, nurse and doctor on duty; 
 
B2 - driver, nurse on call and doctor on duty; 
 
B2 - driver, nurse on duty and doctor on call; 
 
B3 - driver, nurse on call and doctor on call. 
The hourly costs for the personnel are in TABLE IV.

Combining all these factors with data  from 2012 about 
transfers from health structures (TABLE II), it is possible to 
evaluate the total costs for (necessary/unnecessary) transfer 
by ambulance. The methodology used to evaluate term Cv 
in case of private cars is described in the next section. 
 
D. Transfer costs analysis: patient perspective 
In case of non-urgent suspected CHD, patient families use 
their own car for all outpatient consultations. To evaluate 
these costs, we considered only the term Cv in (1), 
calculating it for a “standard” car,  i.e. the best-selling car in 
Italy in 2012 [19], FIAT Panda “1.3 MJT 16V 95 CV”. Term 
Mf was obtained from the manufacturer website, term Cu 
from ACI databases [17] and term D from TABLE I. After 
estimating the cost for car, we multiplied it by the number of 
transfers in TABLE II. We did not include transfers from 
within the Cagliari District since patients would already be in 
the hospital of destination (Brotzu Hospital) so there was no 
need to move. 
 
III. 
RESULTS 
A. Transfer costs analysis results: healthcare system 
perspective 
The estimate of the transfer costs to Brotzu Hospital for 
the consultations required by other structures are presented 
in TABLE V, for both vehicle-types: ambulance and private 
car. Since for consultations by health structures we have the 
data for whether a request was necessary or not we also list 
the unnecessary costs in the table. 
 
B. Transfer costs analysis results: patient perspective 
The costs for patient transfers to Cagliari center related 
to outpatient consultations are depicted in TABLE VI. 
 
C. Transfer costs analysis results: societal perspective 
Considering all the results for the transfer costs analysis 
from health system and patients perspective, we obtained 
the overall cost-benefit results of  TABLE VII.  
In the table, the column “expenditure nature” clarifies if, 
for society, the amount must be considered a cost or a 
benefit. The costs for transfers from other structures by 
ambulance are marked with (A), while the costs by private 
cars are marked with (C).

The cost-benefit analyses are summarized in TABLE 
VIII, which shows that our telemedicine platform could help 
save between 33586 € and 35740 € within one year, 
reducing the costs of the system to 66% of the total 
expenditure. Moreover, in the future hardware costs should 
decrease, while the same is not expected for transport costs.

DISCUSSION 
Although the result of our analysis appear good we 
should emphasize some limitations of this study: 
 the precise number of consultation requiring 
ambulance transfer are unavailable for some 
health structures; 
 the ambulance costs are an estimate since the 
precise cost are unavailable;  
 for outpatient consultation we used average 
estimates of distance rather than precise 
mileages; 
 for the patient perspective costs, we excluded data 
from the Cagliari district. 
 
These limitations probably do not undermine the value 
of our preliminary analysis, but they do suggest themes for 
future studies: cost-effectiveness analysis and sensitivity 
analysis should be designed to enhance the quality of the 
system evaluation. 
Another question left open is that of the relative 
performance of telemedicine systems: our solution is open 
and low cost, but about commercial systems? We have yet 
to compile a similar table of costs for existing commercial 
telemedicine applications (their prices are not publicly 
available).  Instead, we tabulate some teleconference

used in similar way. TABLE IX summarizes the systems we

CONCLUSIONS 
The preliminary cost-benefit analysis presented in this 
paper shows that the adoption of the real-time telemedicine 
solution we developed is potentially useful from a societal 
perspective. This analysis is local and is focused on a 
specific situation, but the design principles that guided its 
development enable it to be applied in other clinical 
contexts 
that 
require 
operator-dependent 
diagnostic 
techniques. At the moment, the telemedicine system is 
under trial in emergency structures for the FAST (Focused 
Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) examination. 
Another added value of the system derives from its 
adaptability to support learning sessions. In conclusion, the 
benefits of our telemedicine system confirm the original 
hypothesis from which we started and encourage us to trial 
the system on a regional scale, once the an organizational 
model has been completely defined.
