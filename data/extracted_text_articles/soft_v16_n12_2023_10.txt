Abstract—Our paper proposes an optimal trading algorithm
based on a novel application of the conventional Control En-
gineering (CE) to Algorithmic Trading (AT). We consider a
fundamental CE concept, namely, the feedback control and
apply it to the algorithmic trading (algo trading). The con-
crete feedback control strategy is designed here in a form
of the celebrated Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) model.
The highly frequent nature of the modern financial markets
motivates the using of a model-free realisation of the generic
PID framework. The control theoretical methodology we propose
is additionally combined with some advanced statistical results
for the historical market data. We obtain a specific log-normal
probability distribution function (pdf) associated with the specific
relative characteristics of the available stock data. This empirical
pdf mentioned above provides a novel computational technique
for the necessary PID gains optimization. For this aim we apply
a suitable data driven optimization problem and also consider
an alternative stochastic programming framework. The stochas-
tic optimization naturally involves the Monte Carlo solution
procedure. The optimized PID trading algorithm we propose
is next represented in the frequency domain. This equivalent
representation makes it possible to introduce a new concept in
the financial engineering, namely, the ”stock market energy”
concept. Finally, we implement the resulting PID optimal trading
algorithm and develop a Python based prototype software. We
apply the corresponding prototype software to the Binance stock
market. This practical example illustrates the proposed optimal
PID trading scheme and also shows the effectiveness of the CE
methods in the modern AT.

I. INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
Optimal design of profitable trading algorithms for finan-
cial markets constitutes a very challenging and technically
sophisticated problem of the modern financial engineering (see
e.g., [1],[3],[4],[5],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[31],[38],[41]). In this
contribution, we study an idealized stock market and apply
the CE based PID control design in the development of an
optimization based trading algorithm. Recall that the PID
synthesis constitutes one of the most powerful and successful
real-world control algorithms (see e.g., [2],[27],[28],[34],[36]).
The conventional model-based PID control implements a fun-
damental idea of the feedback action and is widely used in
various engineering and applications.
The stock market idealization we follow in this paper
usually involves some generic technical assumptions. We con-
sider the situation characterized by ”no transaction costs” and
also assume the condition of ”one stock portfolio”. We also
consider some further simplifying hypothesises, namely, the
assumption of the ”zero interest” and the ”continuous trading”
condition. Let us refer to [7],[8],[9] for the necessary technical
details on the existing abstractions in the modelling of stock
markets. Our paper deals with the discrete-time dynamics of
the financial markets under consideration. This assumption is
motivated by the generic stock tick dynamics and also by the
corresponding decision making process. Recall that a tick is a
measurement of the minimum upward or downward movement
in the price of a security (see e.g., [24],[32] and the references
therein). The given discrete dynamics of the stock market ticks
naturally implies the discrete-time decision making in trading.
We next use the generic notation of the stock ticks t = 1,...,
and the corresponding semi-open time-intervals of the trading
buckets [t,t +1).
The advanced financial engineering and financial economics
constitute nowadays a powerful theoretical tool of the modern
financial science (see [15],[16],[23],[40]). On the other hand,
the mathematically rigorous time-series based financial theo-
ries can not be directly applied to an algorithmic generation of
a profitable trading decision. This fact is a simple consequence
of the highly frequent stock price dynamics that makes it
impossible any adequate price forecasting. This fundamental
property of the modern financial markets implies the so called
High-Frequency Trading (HFT) approach. We refer to [16]
for the corresponding concepts and useful information. A
successful HFT strategy development is a very sophisticated
challenging task. In this paper, we propose to use some
fundamental aspects of the conventional CE design for this

purpose. More specifically, we propose to use an optimized
PID type control strategy for a profitable trading algorithm.
The optimization techniques for this PID trading algorithm
involve some novel optimal PID gains tuning strategies.
Recall that the control theoretic approach to the modern
AT was originated in [7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[19],[31]. Let us
also refer to [3],[4] for some novel PID related trading
algorithms with a switched structure. Since the non-regular,
highly frequent bid-ask spread behaviour on a stock does
not admit a realistic forecasting model, we examine here a
specific model-free version of the classic PID control. Our
algorithmic approach proposes to react to the stock price
variations instead of modeling them. We next combine the
conventional PID control approach to AT with an advanced
statistical characterization of some historical market data sets.
We next identify a log-normal type probability distribution
function (pdf) for some concrete quantities related to the data
sets under consideration.
It is common knowledge that a classic and advanced
PID control design incorporates a very important technical
step, namely, the PID gains tuning [2],[27],[28],[34]. The
established log-normal pdf for some market characteristics
can next be used in the optimal PID gains tuning pro-
cedure. Note that various optimization techniques play an
important role in the modern financial engineering (see e.g.,
[1],[4],[5],[14],[22],[26],[29],[30],[33],[42],[43],[44] and ref-
erences therein). For the concrete PID gains optimization we
use here two conceptually different approaches. The first ap-
proach constitutes a data driven regression based optimization.
This useful approach can be combined with the well-known
Forward Testing methodology and with the consideration of
the corresponding In-Sample and Out-of-Sample concepts for
the data sets. The second optimization approach we use is
the classic stochastic optimization framework. This approach
uses the established log-normal distribution of some market
related quantities. It finally leads to the celebrated Monte Carlo
solution technique (see e.g., [22],[39] and references therein).
The resulting PID trading algorithm with the optimized
gains tuning procedure was applied to some concrete real-
world examples. We illustrate the efficiency, profitability and
practical implementability of the proposed algorithm and
consider a trading application on the Binance BTC/USDT
spot market. We also discuss shortly the necessary prototype
software for implementation of the proposed optimal PID
trading algorithm.
The remainder of our paper is organized as follows: Section
II contains a formal AT problem statement. This section
includes a mathematical description of the conceptually novel
model-free PID trading algorithm. In Section III we perform
an advanced statistical analysis of the stock market data. We
establish some log-normal probability distribution properties
for some specific subsequential market characteristics. Sec-
tion IV deals with the main problem of the PID trading,
namely, with the optimal PID gains tuning. We consider the
data driven optimization involving the historical data and the
corresponding backtesting procedure. The corresponding re-
gression analysis is considered in the general Forward Testing
framework. In this section we also propose an alternative
PID gains selection and use the scenario based stochastic
optimization problem for this purpose. The resulting stochastic
program is next solved by the classic Monte Carlo approach.
In Section V we discuss a novel frequency domain interpre-
tation of the proposed PID trading strategy. We apply the
conventional z-transformation and the Fourier transformation
for the constructive characterization of the PID trading scheme
in the frequency space. Section VI contains a practically
motivated application of the developed PID trading algorithm
to a specific stock market, namely, to the Binance BTC/USDT
futures stock. This section is also devoted to the prototype
software design. Section VII summarizes our paper.
II. MODEL-FREE PID BASED TRADING ALGORITHM
Consider a trading on an idealized stock market with an
initial deposit (initial investment) I(1) = I1 and introduce the
current return
∆g(t), t = 1,...,.
The current investment level at a time instant t is denoted
by ∆I(t). In parallel with the current values introduced above
we also consider the cumulative return and the cumulative
investment g(t) and I(t), respectively. The nonlinear discrete-
time PID trading strategy can be formalized as follows:
δI(t +1) = KP(t +1)∆g(t)+KD(t +1)˙∆g(t)+
KI(t +1)
Z t
t−T h(τ)∆g(τ)dτ,
∆I(t +1) = χ(δI(t +1)),
for t = 1,....
(1)
By KP(·), KD(·) and KI(·) we denote here the necessary PID
gains for the proportional, integral, and derivative terms of the
classic regulator scheme (see [2],[27],[28]). Let us introduce
the vector of these PID gains:
K(·) := (KP(·), KD(·), KI(·))T.
Note that the integral term in (1) incorporates the ”process
memory” on a given time interval [t −T,t]. The integral kernel
h(·) in (1) is defined by a suitable ”memory loss” function. We
consider an exponentially weighted ”memory loss” function
h(·) with h(t) = 1. Note that the proposed scheme (1) is similar
to the classic PID control design (see e.g., [28],[34]). The
nonlinear function χ(·) in 1 constitutes a ”control saturation”
and can naturally be defined as follows:
χ(δI) :=



δI,
if δImin ≤ |δI| ≤ δImax;
±δImax,
if |δI| > δImax;
0,
if |δI| < δImin.
(2)
Here
δImax, δImin
are prescribed maximal and minimal current investment levels,
respectively. The above ”saturated” investment model consti-
tutes a formal mathematical condition and serves as a natural
restriction for the investment volume.

Assuming the investment decision ∆I(t + 1) in (2) and
taking into consideration the stock price p(ω,t +1), we next
calculate the current return g(t +1):
∆g(t +1) = (p(·,t +1)− p(·,t))
p(·,t)
∆I(t +1)
(3)
If we use the CE analogy, we conclude that the proposed
investment level ∆I(t + 1) in (1) plays a role of a ”control
input”. We next call it ”investment decision”. Note that the
current investment decision is deployed at a present time
instant t under the condition of a natural unknownness of the
market price
p(ω,t +1).
By ω ∈ Ω and Ω we denote here a probability state space with
a unknown probability measure. This stock price
p : Ω×Z+ → R
is assumed to be a measurable stochastic function. Note that
the current return ∆g(t +1) is calculated an a posteriori value,
where p(·,t + 1) in (3) denotes a concrete realization of the
stochastic price p(ω,t +1).
Since we have a CE analogy, we also can represent the
above PID trading algorithm (1)-(3) using the block diagram.
The corresponding block scheme of the proposed model-free
PID trading strategy (1)-(3) is presented in Figure 1.

Fig. 1. Model-free PID based trading algorithm
Note that the feedback channel in (1)-(3) is implemented
by the current return ∆g(t +1) in (3). In fact, the PID trading
algorithm (1)-(3) and the corresponding block diagram (Figure
1) represent the so-called ”delayed PID” scheme. We refer to
[28] for details.
The general integral formula for
δI(t +1)
in (1) can be concretized in the discrete-time:
δI(t +1) = (KP(t +1)+KI(t +1)+KD(t +1))∆g(t)+
(KI(t +1)h(t −1)−KD(t +1))∆g(t −1)+
KI(t +1)
t−2
∑
τ=t−T
h(τ)∆g(τ).
(4)
Recall that the main CE problem of the conventional PID
control approach consists in defining the adequate PID gains
tuning rules (see e.g., [27],[28] and references therein). In
the generic real-world application fields of the classic PID
controllers the tuning techniques are well established [2],[34].
For the conceptually sophisticated model-free PID algorithm
under consideration, an adequate design of the PID gains
tuning schemes constitutes a challenging theoretic problem.
The suitable PID gains selection immediately determines the
main trading signal by the rule (4). In fact, an adequate
(optimal) PID gains tuning scheme development is a key
problem of a profitable PID based investment decision.
Let us also note that the model-free character of the pro-
posed PID scheme (1)-(3) and (4) indicates the application
possibility of the modern ML approaches to an optimal PID
gains tuning problem. We refer to [12],[13],[26] for the techni-
cal details related to the RL approach and to some applications
of the ML techniques in AT.
III. ADVANCED STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE
STOCK MARKET DATA
We now study the important PID gains tuning problem and
apply an additional statistical information related to the stock
market. Introduce the following ”price/volume” ratio:
θ(ω,t +1) := p(ω,t +1)
v(t +1) .
(5)
Here p(ω,t +1) is an unknown (stochastic) price at the time
instant t +1 and v(t +1) is an investment volume to the same
time:
v(t +1) := ∆I(t +1)
p(·,t) .
(6)
Note that (6) expresses the entities number of a traded financial
instrument (for example, futures trading). The comprehensive
(a posteriori) statistical analysis of a wide spectrum of stock
instruments demonstrates that the pdf of the above value
θ(ω,t)
constitutes
a
specific
log-normal
distribution
(see
e.g.,
[18],[20],[35],[44] and references therein). Clearly, the real
investment volume of a hedge fund, a private trader or of
a bank is usually a restricted. In the case of the PID trading
algorithm (1)-(3), the maximal investment volume is a direct
consequence of the boundedness of ∆I(t +1) in (1) and (6).
The log-normal pdf related to the financial markets has
mainly been studied for option prices. In this connection we
also refer to the celebrated Black and Scholes model [15]. A
useful discussion on this subject can also be found in [40].
Let us also mention the log-normal pdf’s of some volatility
involved quotients and other stock market parameters and
indices (see e.g., [1],[5],[18],[23]). We next analyze the sta-
tionary statistical distribution ρ1(·) of the quantity θ(ω,t +1)
introduced in (5):
ρ1(θ) =
a
√
2πσ(θ −s)×
exp−(0.5σ2)×(ln(θ −s)− µ)2.

Here µ ∈ R denotes a statistical mean, σ ∈ R+ is a dispersion
and s ∈ R denotes a shifting. Note that (7) is often called
”three-parameters”
{µ,σ,s}
log-normal distribution (see e.g., [1],[18]). The concrete pa-
rameter values of the log-normal pdf ρ(θ) can be calculated
using the backtesting on the historical stock market data. As
mentioned above, (7) constitutes an adequate model distribu-
tion for the introduced price/volume ratio θ(ω,t + 1). The
quality of this statistic model can be established by application
of the Chi-Quadrat test for distributions qualification. We refer
to [35] for necessary technical details. For example, one can
consider the normalized value
χ2/q
for the above test. Here q is the number of degrees of
freedom. The concrete stock market histogram for a monthly
Binance BTC/USDT price/volume ratio θ(ω,t +1) is depicted
in Figure 2.

USDT spot market
In parallel to (7) we also consider the log-normal pdf for
the following price/price ratio:
ϑ(ω,t +1) :=

additional optimization procedure for a ”best choice” of the
PID gains. In this section, we describe two advanced opti-
mization approaches to the optimal PID gains tuning. The
resulting PID based strategies (1)-(3) with an optimal gain
selection are next called optimal PID trading algorithms. Let
us note that the ”advanced” character of the optimal tuning
mentioned above corresponds to the model-free structure of
the proposed PID trading scheme. The model-free nature of an
optimal PID implementation (1)-(3) also indicates the usability
of the modern ML and RL approaches for optimal PID gains
selection problems. Let us refer to [12],[13],[26] for some
technical results and novel ideas.
A. Data Driven Gains Optimization
In this section we use a conventional regression based
optimization framework applied to the historical stock data.
Our aim is to combine the least square optimization with the
generic Forward Testing (FT). Note that the FT technique is a
common methodology of the modern AT (see e.g., [23],[26]).
It includes the so called In-Sample and Out-of-Sample data
subsets of the initially given historical data set. The In-Sample
data set is part of historical data on which the optimization is
performed. The subset of historical data that has been reserved
for a possible validation of the optimized trading algorithm is
known as an Out-of-Sample data set.
We now choose a number M1 ∈ N as a cardinal number of
the In-Sample set and consider the corresponding investment
volumes:
vj(t +1), j = 1,...,M1 −1.
Let M2 denotes a cardinal number of the Out-of-Sample sat
such that the complete historical data set under consideration
has
M := M1 +M2
elements. Using the given (nonlinear) structure of the PID
trading algorithm (1)-(3), we next introduce the following
main optimization problem
J1(K(t +1)) :=
M1
∑
j=1

127

is the absolute value of the optimal investment volume. The
above trading signal / trading volume pair definitively de-
termines a (t + 1)-trading decision of proposed PID trading
algorithm. The proposed nonlinear optimization approach (13)
implies that the optimal investment decision
∆Iopt(t +1)
constitutes an a priori optimized value in the above sig-
nal/volume pair. The corresponding optimal volume vopt(t +1)
is in fact an a posteriori value that can be computed after the
stock prise p(·,t +1) is known.
B. Stochastic Optimal Gains Tuning
The optimal gains selection problem (13) from the previous
section constitutes a data driven regression-like approach. This
generic optimization approach leads to the constrained nonlin-
ear optimization and is based on the given historical stock
market data. The additional FT technique discussed in the
previous section is in fact an adequate expert driven clustering
of the complete historical data set. Note that this separation
of the data set is methodologically similar to the main idea
of the celebrated Monte Carlo method (see [14],[22],[37] and
references therein). Let us recall that the classic Monte Carlo
method contains the so called ”training” and ”validation” steps
(see [14],[17],[42] and references therein).
In this section we will formulate the stochastic optimization
problem for an adequate gains selection in the proposed PID
trading algorithm (1)-(3). The stochastic programming prob-
lem we consider is conceptually different to the regression-like
problem (13). It involves the advanced statistical description
of stock markets discussed in Section III. Using (11), we next
introduce the following minimization problem:
J(ω,K(t +1)) :=
M
∑
j=1

The celebrated scenarios based approximating problem for
(16) can now be formalized as follows:
JE(K(t +1)) :=
M
∑
j=1
N
∑
i=1
P(ω = ωi)

Fig. 3. The one-day spot rate dynamics on the Binance BTC / USDT exchange
The corresponding DTFT of the one day FIR filter dynamics
(18), namely, the resulting FR (19) is presented on Figure 4.
Fig. 4. The FR characteristic of the Binance BTC / USDT spot rate
In fact, the resulting frequency diagram, namely, Figure
4 represents a specific ”market energy” distribution by the
corresponding frequencies. This energetic interpretation of
the presented DTFT is based ob the fundamental Parseval´s
theorem in from the classic Fourier analysis (see e.g., [35]).
Motivating from this consideration we introduce the following
price energy concept associated with the historical stock
market data:
E :=
N
∑
i=1
FR2( f),
where N corresponds to the dimension of one day data set
under consideration and FR(f) is the corresponding Frequency
response associated with this data set.
Finally, note that the proposed PID trading algorithm (1)-(3)
can also be combined with the several well-known momentum
trading strategies (see e.g., [31],[32]). In the framework of a
stock market we a are looking for a function
S : Ω×Z+ → R,
the trading strategy. For example, the celebrated fixed-mix
strategy Sconst(·,·) that keeps the value fraction of a risky asset
constant has the following easy formalization:
S(ω,t +1) =
c
p(ω,t +1),
where c is a given constant. The celebrated (random) trend-
following momentum strategy S(·,·) can also be easy repre-
sented:
S(ω,t +1) = tr{S}(t +1)+ζ(ω,t +1).
(20)
Here
tr{S}(t +1)
denotes a trend of the stochastic process S(ω,t +1). By ζ(·,·)
we denote here the stochastic nois model of the generic market
fluctuations. The trend following model (20) provides a future
promising tool for an optimal FR based PID gains selection
procedure. In fact, a frequency domain analysis provides a
natural analytic CE tool for the HFT algorithmic trading.
VI. PROTOTYPE SOFTWARE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF
THE PID TRADING ALGORITHM
We now present an application of the developed PID based
AT technique to a real-world stock market data. Consider
the Binance Bitcoin/USDT futures stock and apply the pro-
posed optimal PID trading algorithm (1)-(3). Consider the
BTC/USDT futures price dynamics mentioned above as pre-
sented in Figure 5.
Fig. 5. Binance BTC / USD one day price index
We have applied the novel OPID trading algorithm to the
above example. The PID gains optimal tuning procedure for

this example was determined as a data driven optimization dis-
cussed in Section IV. The corresponding (positive) dynamics
of the return is now presented in Figure 6.
Fig. 6. Binance BTC / USD one day price index
Note that the operation time for every subsequent trading
decision of the OPID in this example is timely restricted.
The stock market under consideration has an obvious high-
frequency behaviour. This fact naturally implies some expected
difficulties of the common trading algorithms. In particular,
this concerns the widely used moving average trading and
the general trend following trading strategies. As one can
see, the developed OPID constitutes an adequate approach
to the HFT. The time ticks in the above trading example
under consideration are significatively dense. The length of
the corresponding intervals of trading buckets is equal to 1.728
sec.
Let us also observe the typical ”hyperregulation and sta-
bilization” dynamics of the proposed PID trading algo-
rithm (see Figure 3). This dynamic behaviour is a charac-
teristic one for the conventional PID controller (see e.g.,
[1],[3],[27],[28],[34]). The presented practical example illus-
trates the implementability of the developed PID trading
algorithm AT. Moreover, as we can see the resulting financial
behaviour of the return is a profitable behaviour.
VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we developed a novel trading algorithm
that involves the model-free PID control methodology and
some well established statistical characteristics of the stock
market data. The proposed analytic approach can naturally
be extended to the real-time multi-asset trading. Moreover,
it can also be efficiently combined with some classical trading
strategies. The main idea of the proposed PID control approach
to the algorithmic trading consists in modern data involved
optimization techniques. These advanced optimization proce-
dures determine an optimal calibration (optimal tuning) of
the main PID trading parameters, namely, of the PID gains.
The resulting optimal PID gains calculated for every stock
price tick define a current trading decision. The optimization
procedures mentioned above involve the conventional FT
techniques in combination with the regression analysis as well
as the Monte Carlo method from stochastic optimization.
The given historical stock market data, the statistical prop-
erties mentioned above and the data driven optimization
techniques are constructively used for an adequate calibration
(tuning) of the PID trading algorithm gains. This calibration
involves the advanced backtesting procedure. The resulting
optimal trading PID strategy generates at every subsequent
time instant a profitable decision of the ”buy/sell/hold” type for
the stock market orders. In fact, the proposed CE like approach
to the AT involves a combination of some mathematically
rigorous tools, namely, the classic PID control methodology,
applied statistics and computational optimization. This inter-
connected structure of the obtained trading algorithm and the
model-free character of the PID scheme indicate the applica-
tion possibility of the modern ML approaches to the design
of the PID type trading algorithms (see e.g., [12],[13],[26]).
The above combination of different mathematical tools finally
leads to a novel and very promising trading strategy. The
resulting implementable PID trading algorithm, the discussed
initial software prototypes and the corresponding real-world
scenario based simulations extend the family of the feedback
based trading algorithms. We also expect a profitable appli-
cation of the proposed optimized PID trading methodology
in the High-Frequency Trading. Note that the developed PID
based trading approach can also be involved (as an additional
tool) into the several mathematical concepts of the modern
financial engineering. For example, it can be considered in
the framework of the well established financial time series
analysis and Kalman filter techniques (see e.g., [3],[6],[29]).
The proposed PID trading algorithm is also compatible with
the generic price prediction and trend following techniques
(see e.g., [24]).
Finally note that the algorithmic trading strategy proposed
in our paper constitutes an initial theoretical development.
We are mostly concentrated here on the mathematical and
algorithmic aspects of the proposed technique. The prototypes
of the financial solutions for the stock market proposed in our
contribution need the comprehensive additional analytic de-
velopment, the corresponding simulations, further backtesting,
adequate optimization approaches and practical applications to
the real stock markets.
