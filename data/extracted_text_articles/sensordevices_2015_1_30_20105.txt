Abstract — Sinusoidal encoders, including Hall effect sensors, 
are position sensors that provide analog sine and cosine signals 
of angular position.  All schemes used for converting these 
signals into measure of the angle require either trigonometric 
or inverse trigonometric function implementation. The 
proposed converter is based on the use of the alternating 
pseudo-linear segments of the sensor signals together with a 
simple and effective linearization technique. The theoretical 
absolute error of non-linearity of the converter is 0.05 degree 
over the full 360 degree range. The converter may be 
implemented 
numerically 
or 
electronically. 
The paper 
describes the proposed method, full details of its analog 
implementation, and experimental results obtained with a Hall 
effect sensor. Results demonstrate agreement between theory 
and experimental results. 
Keywords — amplitude-phase conversion, inverse sine 
synthesis, linearization, 
position measurement,

encoder,  Hall effect sensor.

 INTRODUCTION  
Rotational speed and position measurement and control 
is often required in various applications in industry, 
military, avionics, communication and other fields. 
Sinusoidal encoders  whether operating on optical, 
inductive, Hall effect or magnetoelectric principles produce 
quadrature electrical signals in which the unknown angle is 
encoded [1]-[10]. In practice, it is common to observe phase 
and amplitude imbalances in the sensor signals; therefore 
the sensor outputs may be written as:

where A is the maximum amplitude of the sinusoidal 
component of US(θ), θ is the shaft angle of the rotor of the 
sensor, and  and β are amplitude and phase imbalances 
respectively. Note that some sensors may produce signals 
with dc offset components; however, these may easily be 
removed before further processing. Amplitude and phase 
balancing may be achieved in a number of ways [11]-[14]. In 
this work, we propose balancing by generating a perfect 
cosine signal, from US(θ) and UC(θ), with the same 
amplitude as the sine signal,

The resolver requires a suitable converter in order to 
determine  from its signals (2); many open loop and closed 
loop conversion schemes have been described in literature. 
Some open loop converters based on the linearization of the 
pseudo-linear segments of sinusoidal signals have been 
described [10][15]-[22]. Ratiometric techniques based on 
arctangent method are also used in open loop converters 
[23]-[26];  these require the use of look up tables or 
linearization techniques. Other open loop converters based 
on the use of reference ac signals and time measurement 
techniques have also been described [8][9][27]-[29]. Closed 
loop converters employ the phase-locked loop (PLL) 
technique [30]–[37]. 
In the present work, we present an open-loop amplitude-
to-phase converter that uses a simple arcsine synthesis 
technique which can be easily implemented with few 
standard electronic components. The remainder of the paper 
is  organized as follows. In Section II, the principle and 
theory of operation of the proposed converter, including a 
novel linearization technique, are described in details. A 
dedicated signal shaping technique used for implementing 
the converter is also described.   In Section III, the practical 
implementation of the converter and experimental results 
are described. Section IV concludes the paper. 
II. 
PROPOSED CONVERTER 
The basic principle of the proposed converter (Figure 1) 
is based on making use of the alternating pseudo-linear 
segments of the sensors signals (2) in order to produce a 
signal U0(θ) which is almost proportional to the unknown 
angle θ in each of its four quadrants (Figure 2), as has been 
reported in previous works [5]-[19]. The four quadrants are 
identifiable using two binary outputs whose states depend 
on the signs of the sum and difference of the transducer 
signals (i.e., LOW state  for negative and HIGH state for 
positive values):

The sign of ÛS(θ) - ÛC(θ)  is used together with a 
synchronous rectifier to generate a rectified signal U0R(θ), a 
sawtooth-like waveform made up of four identical and 
positive-slope sections as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. 
The signal U0R(θ) requires further linearization in order to 
obtain a piecewise linear output U0RL(θ). The angle may be 
determined from the linearize signal V0RL(θ) using a simple 
linear equation within each quadrant of input angle with 
minimal non-linearity error. Within the full 360 degree 
range, the computed angle noted  θC (in degree) is 
determined from:

Note that in the range 315 to 360 degree, the angle 
determined using (5) is negative (i.e., measured clockwise). 
Evidently, the residual error (θC-θ) depends on the quality of 
linearization scheme. Previous works have presented 
various linearization methods with different degrees of 
complexity and precision [10][15]-[22]. These schemes that 
uses 
multipliers/dividers 
add 
complexity 
and 
cost, 
particularly, in analog implementation. In this work, the 
proposed linearization method is based on signal shaping 
techniques. 
Signal shaping networks are usually associated with 
trigonometric and inverse trigonometric function synthesis. 
In this application, the pseudo-linear segments of V0R(θ) 
belong to sinusoidal signals. Hence, linearization requires 
arcsine function synthesis, or in other words sine-to-triangle 
conversion. It is well known that signal shaping can be 
implemented using well established piece-wise linear 
approximation techniques involving diodes and/or transistors 
[38]-[40]. Other techniques based on differential pairs of 
transistors offer attractive and simpler solutions that closely 
approximate sine function [41]-[47]. In the present 
application, a signal converter based on the non-linear I-V 
characteristics of the base-emitter junction of low power 
bipolar junction transistors. The circuit diagram of the 
proposed linearization scheme is shown in Figure 4. This is a 
translinear sine-triangle converter inspired from the triangle-
sine scheme presented in [47].

Figure 2. Converter signals: input signals ÛS(θ) and ÛC(θ), non-linearized 
signals U0(θ) and U0R(θ) and binary outputs Bit0(θ) and Bit1(θ). 
 
The following analysis assumes that the transistors in the 
scheme of Figure 4 are matched. Because of symmetry, the 
current source of magnitude 2I ensures that the individual 
bias currents I in the two trans-diodes are equal. The 
sinusoidal segments of the rectified voltage U0R(θ) applied 
to the linearization circuit result in a current i= UR(θ)/R. 
Note that this current should always be lower than I; the 
maximum value should correspond to the maximum 
amplitude A of the sinewaves from which the segments of 
U0R(θ) are extracted and therefore imax= A/R=I. By invoking 
the Shockley equation for the base-emitter junctions of the 
transistors, we can write:

Since

the

value 
for 
R= 
10V/0.25mA=40kΩ. Simulation of U0RL(θ) according to (6) 
suggest that with R=40.04kΩ, R1=130Ω and R2=14130Ω , 
the residual error in the determination of θ using (5) is 
within  ±0.048° in the full 360° range as shown in Figure 3.  
 
Figure 3. Simulation of the performance of the proposed linearization 
scheme.  U0RL(θ) is computed according to approximation in (6) with 
A=10V,  I=0.25mA, R=40.04kΩ,  R1=130Ω, R2=14130Ω, and VT=26mV. 
 
Note that (i) the inversion of U0RL(θ) with respect to 
U0R(θ) is due to the inverting configuration of the 
operational amplifier, and (ii) the amplitude A of the sensor 
signals is assumed to be 20Vpp and therefore U0R(θ) is 
20/2½ Vpp. It is important to note that the operating 
temperature usually affects signal shaping schemes; this can 
be seen in (6) through the thermal voltage term. However, 
some degree of temperature compensation is achieved in the 
present scheme by selecting a suitable current source 
element with appropriate positive temperature coefficient. 
It is important to note that since the proposed scheme is 
open loop, the bandwidth is only limited by the dynamics of 
the components used, mainly the operational amplifiers and 
analog switches. In all cases, the bandwidth should be much 
higher than what is required in practical positioning 
applications: e.g., for a maximum rotational speed of 
24000rpm (i.e., considered to be very high for real 
applications), the corresponding frequency would be 
24000/60=400Hz only which does not pose any problem 
even for standard components.

EXPERIMENT 
The 
practical 
converter 
is 
a 
straightforward 
implementation of the scheme of Figure 1 using few 
standard electronic components. Figure 4 depicts the 
detailed circuit diagram. Matched dual NPN transistors 
(MAT01) and adjustable current sources (LM334) have 
been used in the implementation of the linearizer. The offset 
cancellation, amplification, amplitude equalization and 
phase correction of the encoder output signals are not 
shown. The amplitudes of the converter’s input signals 
ÛC() and ÛS() are 20Vpp, and the linearized output is 
20Vpp.  
The encoder used in the present work is a Hall effect 
sensor (model HSCB22). This sensor produces two

quadrature sine and cosine signals with a nominal peak-to-
peak amplitude of 4V and an offset of 2.5V. Appropriate 
analog signal conditioning is applied to the sensor signals in 
order to (i) remove the offset, (ii) correct the phase between 
its signals using (2) and (iii) adjust their amplitudes to 
20Vpp. The sensor was driven with a dc motor through a 
100:1 reduction gear.

Figure 5 depicts the amplified sensor signals (1) together

signals has been removed in the amplification stage 
generating (1) and the sensor was driven at 37rpm. Figure 6

and illustrates the effectiveness of phase and amplitude 
equalization.

Figure 7 shows the converter input signals ÛS(θ) and

rectified signal U0R(θ) and the linearized analog output

was driven at a fixed rotational speed of 37 rpm. Figure 8. 
shows the converter signals by driving the sensor at the 
maximum rotational 240rpm; this is the maximum rotational 
speed that the setup allowed. It is clear, however, that 
because of its open loop nature, the converter should work 
at much higher speeds.  
The characterization of the converter is shown in Figure 
9 where the sensor was mounted on a miniature rotary table 
(model A5990TS with an integral 90:1 gear ratio and 100 
arc-second accuracy) that enabled precise control of the 
angle θ.

The overall error in the determination of the angle θC

0 to 180° of input angle; this compares well with the 
theoretical error estimated above in Figure 3. Despite the 
simplicity and low cost of the proposed scheme, its error 
compares well with those of other more complex closed 
loop and open loop schemes reported in literature, e.g., 
0.01° in [15], 0.10° in [17], 0.04° in [20], 0.18° in [37]. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, low-cost and simple-to-implement open-
loop method for amplitude-to-phase conversion was 
proposed for use with sinusoidal Hall effect sensors. The 
conversion was based on a simple and effective linearization 
technique, full theory of which was given. The theoretical 
error of non-linearity of the converter is below 0.05°. The 
scheme was implemented using standard electronic 
components and was experimentally tested. The results have 
been excellent and showed that the proposed scheme can be 
used to measure angles in the full 360° range with an overall 
error lower than 0.09°.
