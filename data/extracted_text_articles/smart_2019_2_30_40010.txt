Abstract—Crimes are common social problems that affect the
quality of life, economic growth and reputation of a country. In
smart cities, the aim is to reduce crime rates using Information
and Communication Technologies (ICT), specifically with the
use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in combination with
legacy
information
systems,
in
order
to
obtain
data
automatically. In this paper, we propose an approach based on
deep learning for the classification of incidents of a crime of
public safety through predictive analysis. The predictive model
is based on a neural network Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), trained with a small group of attributes, enabling the
prediction of the class label in the validation stage, with a high
percentage of prediction accuracy. The proposed approach is
evaluated through a big data set (real data) of type open data,
which contains historical information about the crimes of a
smart city.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, smart city approaches are developed in order
to improve the economy, mobility, environment, people life,
living standards, and governance of cities [1], supported by
the design, implementation, management, and monitoring of
projects
based
on
Information
and
Communication
Technologies (ICT). The main smart city characteristics
include
sustainability,
resilience,
governance,
enhanced
quality of life and intelligent management of natural
resources and city facilities [2]. In this way, for the
development of the services deployed in the complex
systems of intelligent cities, the Internet of Things (IoT)
technologies
have
emerged
as
a
new
computational
paradigm.
The IoT consists of a large number of objects (physical
and
virtual
things)
with
pervasive
sensing,
detection,
actuation, and computational capabilities, allowing these
devices to generate, exchange, and consume data with
minimal human intervention [3]. Contributions from the
implementation of IoT technologies can be found in smart
cities,
smart
homes,
e-health,
smart
grids,
intelligent
transportation
systems,
crime
prevention
systems,
and
intelligent use of water, among others. The extensive use of
information systems (smart type) in various domains of the
city, as well as the use of smart devices in people’s daily life,
have as a consequence the production of massive volumes of
data [4], known as big data. These data are generated by
human-to-human,
human-to-machine,
and
machine-to-
machine interactions. The big data volumes consist of a
mixture of complex data characterized by large and fast-
growing data sets [2], which exceed the analysis capabilities
of the current data management systems. Therefore, there are
requirements related to the acquisition and storage of data,
the processing of information, and the development of
algorithms for intelligent decision support systems. In
addition, the monitoring, understanding, and analysis of the
data generated by the information systems using algorithms
based on data mining and machine learning, can be used to
advance their contribution to the goals of sustainable
development in a smart city [5]. The public safety data set of
smart cities holds a large amount of crime data that could be
exploited to discover patterns and predict future crime trends
[6]. The predictive analysis aims to optimize the exploitation
of these data in order to use knowledge discovery to
anticipate criminal events [6] [7].
Deep
learning
techniques
have
demonstrated
their
capability of the discriminative power compared with other
machine
learning
methods.
Recurrent
Neural
Network
(RNN) architecture has become a model of the deep learning
techniques
most
successfully implemented
in different
domains, due to its natural ability to process sequential
entries and to know their long-term dependencies [8]. That
is, RNN is designed to utilize sequential information of input
data with cyclic connections among building blocks. In the
RNN, neurons are connected to each other in the same
hidden layer and a training function is applied to the hidden
states
repeatedly
[8].
The
Long
Short-Term
Memory
(LSTM) neural network is an extension of the RNN, which
has
achieved
excellent
performance
in
various
tasks,
especially
for
sequential
problems
[9]-[11].
The
implementation of LSTM neural networks for the prediction
of the class label (classification) from a set of instances
through predictive analysis can be considered an important
strategy as a technique in the context of supervised machine
learning and data mining.

In
this
paper,
we
propose
a
deep
learning-based
predictive analysis approach for the classification of crime
incidents. The predictive model is based on an LSTM neural
network that is trained with a small number of attributes of
the big data set, enabling the prediction of the class label in
the validation phase. In order to validate the approach and
show the applicability to the public safety domain, we
present preliminary results using a data set with 6.9 million
registers. The test carried out on the trained LSTM network
shows that it has the capacity to predict the class label of a
new instance. For the evaluation of the system model, we
present a case study with data collected by a real smart city
system in Chicago, USA. This system combines IoT devices
and legacy system in smart city domain. Our case study
addresses the challenges of data analytics of smart city
public safety. In addition, a methodology is proposed to
guide the preprocessing and categorization of the input data
to the neural network, as well as the design and training of
the network.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II
presents a background review on LSTM neural network.
Section III presents a methodology proposed to construct the
predictive model. Section IV discusses the findings, while
Section V we discusses the related work. Section VI
provides the conclusions and plans for future work.

RESEARCH PROPOSAL
An LSTM neural network is considered a network with a
special structure consisting of memory blocks and memory
cells, together with the gate units (input, forget, and output)
that contain them [12]. This structure allows the LSTM
network
to
select
which
information
is
forgotten
or
remembered (see Figure 1). The multiplicative input gate
units are used to avoid the negative effects that unrelated
inputs can create.
Figure 1.
Structure of an LSTM cell.
In our proposed approach, the following is considered for
the definition of the neural network model: 1) the input gate
controls the input flow to the memory cell, 2) the output gate
controls the output sequence of the memory cell to other
LSTM blocks, and 3) the forget gate in the structure of the
memory block is controlled by a single-layer of the neural
network, as shown in Figure 1.
The operation of the LSTM network is based on
equations (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) [10][13]. Then, the
components of the LSTM units, at a time t are updated by
(1), where xt is the input sequence, ht-1 is the previous block
output, Ct-1 is the previous LSTM block memory, and bf is
the polarization vector; W represents separate weight vectors
for each input, and  is the logistic sigmoid function.




ht =  ottanh(Ct



On the other hand, the input gate is divided into two
networks and its function is to generate the new memory, as
shown in Figure 1. First, a single-layer neural network takes
the same inputs as the previous gate, which has a sigmoid
activation function. In this part of the network, it is decided
what percentage of the new memory will be influenced by
the memory of the previous block. Second, a single-layer
neural network, with an activation function tanh, generates a
new memory from the input vectors (xt) and the output from
the previous block (ht-1). Finally, a multiplication of vectors
is performed with the outputs of the two simple neural
networks, and the result is added to the output of the
forgetting gate. This process is performed by equations 2 and
3. Finally, the output gate is calculated by means of
equations 4 and 5, generating the probability value of the
current LSTM block. In summary, the input to the cells is
multiplied by the activation of the input gate, the output to
the network is multiplied by that of the output gate, and the
previous cell values are multiplied by the forget gate.

METHODOLOGY
The prediction of the class label is done by implementing
a set of stages, which can be grouped into pre-processing,
categorization of the data, and predictive model, as shown in
Figure 2. The proposed methodology consists of three
phases: data pre-processing, categorization, and construction
of the predictive model. These phases allow the prediction of
the label of a class based on a model of an LSTM neural
network
A.
Phase 1: Data Pre-processing
The data pre-processing phase consists of the following
stages:
1)
Data Extraction: In the data extraction stage, several
activities are carried out sequentially. First, a set of
attributes are extracted from the original data set. This is
performed through the execution of a feature selection
algorithm proposed in “in press” [14], generating a new data
33

SMART 2019 : The Eighth International Conference on Smart Cities, Systems, Devices and Technologies

group that will be used for the training of the neural
network. Then, in the training data set, a normalization task
is performed on the attribute that represents the class.
Subsequently, a cleaning process is executed to detect and
remove the corrupt or inaccurate instances in the database.
Moreover, the attributes that contain values of a numeric
type are updated, adding the first character of the name of
the attribute to the value of the variable.
2)
Segmentation: The segmentation task is applied to
the data set generated in the previous stage. This task
consists of creating a list of all the features of an instance
and implementing a criterion of separation between features.
Each feature is represented as a unique integer, converting
the instances into a sequence of integers, thereby generating
two lists of the sequence of integers. The former consists of
input features (X), and the later of the output feature (Y),
i.e., the class. Then, the input feature (X) is transformed into
a two-dimensional matrix (the number of sequences and the
maximum length of sequences).
Figure 2.
Methodology implemented for class prediction.
B.
Phase 2: Categorization
The intermediate categorization phase consists of a
process to categorize the sequence of integers corresponding
to
the
output
activities
(Y),
in
a
one-hot
encoding
representation type, specifying that the number of classes
will be equal to the size of the vocabulary.
C.
Phase 3: Prediction Model
The prediction model phase based on LSTM network is
composed of the following stages:
1)
Network Design: In our approach, the design of the
neural network consists of generating a set of three layers.
The input layer is created based on a word embedding
method. The hidden layer contains the memory cells, where
each cell is an LSTM unit. This layer contains a set of
LSTM cells that are composed of the input, output and
forget gates, which allow their interconnection. In the output
layer, only one neuron will be available since there is a
unique output value corresponding to the prediction. This is
shown in Figure 1, where xt is the input vector and ht is the
output result to the memory cell at time t. Furthermore, ht is
the value of the memory cell. At time t, it, ft and ot are
values of the input gate, the forget gate and the output gate,
respectively. Finally, Ct are values of the candidate state of
the memory cell at time t.
2)
Network
Training:
The
training
of
the
LSTM
network is performed using as training data, the integer
sequence list represented by the features contained in the
two-dimensional matrix (X) and the vector that contain the
class (Y) through of a representation one-hot encoding. We
use the configuration parameters presented in Table I.
D.
Prediction Class Label
The prediction is the output generated by the LSTM
neural network, which, through a training phase, allows
predicting the class label for a new instance, from a set of
input features of an instance, which is explained in the
following section.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Crimes are common social problems that affect the
quality of life, economic growth and reputation of a country
[15]. In smart cities, the aim is to reduce crime rates using
ICT. Through different information systems, data is collected
automatically, with the intention of generating knowledge
that allows decisions to be made to reduce the criminal
index. In this sense, our proposal aims to predict the value of
a class, from a set of attributes. The class prediction
represents the probability that an individual will be arrested
after committing a crime.
The data set used is of type open data and contains
historical information about the crimes to evaluate the
performance of the proposed LSTM model. This data set of
the reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of
Chicago from 2001 to 2018. The data set is composed of 22
attributes and 6.9 million records or instances. The complete
data set can be found in [16]. Some of these attributes were

such

attributes can be of data type: string, numeric, date, location
or Boolean. The data is extracted from the Chicago Police
Department’s CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis
and Reporting) system. The data set contains data from
arrests, including data on Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting
(IUCR), location description, domestic, date, ward, Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) code and more data fields. An

In our experiment, training data sets with 80% of the
observations of the original data set are used to train our
model. Instances of the training data set were selected by a
random method, automatically. The remaining 20% of the
instances are used to test our model prediction accuracy.
Table IV presents an extract of the results obtained in the
prediction of the LSTM network using the crime data set
presented before. In the column “Input Features”, it is
mentioned the group of the features used as a new input in
the LSTM network for the prediction stage. The values of the
“Input Features” column are formed by the IUCR code,
district and ward id’s, as well as the identifier of the
community area and the FBI code. The “Target Class” is the
expected label for the corresponding input instance, that is,
the class label with the highest probability of prediction by
the neural network, based on the weights of each class label.
Each row in the table shows a case of prediction of the class
from the input one. The “Output Class” column presents the
label or value that the LSTM neural network predicted from
the input instance for the “arrest” class.
In the column “% of prediction” (see Table IV), the
probability of prediction for each instance is shown. It can be
observed that, in some cases, the neural network fails to
predict the class (for example 3, 7, and 18). However, in
most cases, the neural network has a correct prediction of the
value of the expected class. The global percentage of the
prediction accuracy of the LSTM network for the complete
data set is 0.87.

The LSTM network is trained using an optimization
process that requires a loss function to calculate the model
error. The loss function allows to faithfully summarize all
aspects of the model down into a single number in such a
way that improvements in that number depict a better model.
Figure 3 visualizes the loss function and Figure 4 presents
the accuracy of the training and validation data for the final
model. The final LSTM model achieves an average loss
function of 0.0376 on the validation data and a validation
predictive accuracy of 0.87. Figure 4 shows the learning
curves, exhibiting how the model learned and suitably fit the
training data set. These results align with the loss function
we obtained on the testing data, which means our final model
generalizes well on new data.

automatically detect high-risk crime regions in urban areas
and to reliably forecast crime trends in each region. The
algorithm result is a spatio-temporal crime forecasting
model, composed of a set of crime-dense regions with
associated
crime
predictors,
each
one
representing
a
predictive model for estimating the number of crimes likely
to occur in its associated region. Also, in [18], the authors
propose the use of deep learning for the prediction of hourly
crime rates. In particular, their model is used in spatio-
temporal problems, like crime forecasting. They detected
that future crime rates depend on the trend set in the
previous week, the time of day and the nearby events, both
in space and in time. For each one of these contributing
factors, they use a separate model that offers a prediction
based on indicators of a weekly period, a daily period and
an hourly period, respectively. The outputs of the 3 models
are combined to form a common prediction.

a
system
for

analysis
of
multidimensional data on the macroscopic and microscopic
levels to show trajectories of crime based on their spatial
and temporal characteristics is presented. The system
incorporates a novel algorithm for the crime trajectory
segmentation
and
uses
LSTM
network,
generating
trajectories from heterogeneous data sources, such as open
data and social media, with the aim to report incidents of
crime. In [20], a neural network structure for crime
prediction and the appropriate inputs for crime prediction
are performed through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization for
the selection of network inputs and Virtual Leave-One-Out
test (VLOO) for the selection of the optimal number of
hidden neurons. Spatio-temporal distribution of the hot-
spots is conducted and a methodology is developed for
short-term crime forecasting using the LSTM.
In
[21],
a
context-aware
attention
framework
is
presented based on LSTM to accurately predict the amount
of unrest events news. The social event prediction model
consists of three parts: 1) the LSTM encoder, to get the
hidden representation of the input sequence, 2) the attention
layer, to automatically learn the weights of the hidden
representations, and 3) the context-aware fully connected
layer used to combine near historical target data and the
weighted representation vectors. In [22], a crime prediction
framework based on deep neural network that uncovers
dynamic crime patterns and carefully explores the evolving
inter-dependencies between crimes and other ubiquitous
data in urban space was developed. The model enables
predicting crime occurrences of different categories in each

CONCLUSION
The
advances
in Information
and
Communications
Technologies and the excessive use of smart devices have
produced a massive generation of data. This way, IoT
technologies and their implementation on the smart cities
have caused a growing need for data analysis and big data
analytics.
This paper investigated the effectiveness of LSTM neural
networks based deep learning approach for predicting the
future class labels of a crime incidents instance. To evaluate
the predictive performance of our method, we use a data set
that collects the historical information of crime indices in a
smart city. These data are generated, in most cases, by IoT
devices and managed by an information system of the police
department. Before applying the LSTM model, we used a
pre-processing and categorization of the data. Next, we
designed and trained a neural network model in order to
select the model that presents the best performance. This
process is described by the proposed methodology, which
guides the process of preparing input data for the LSTM
neural network and its implementation.
From the original data set, 80% of the instances were
used for the training stage of our model, and the remaining
20% for the validation stage of the model. The instances
used in the training stage were selected by a random method
automatically. Our deep learning approach achieves high
performance in the final model with 87.84% accuracy based
on the validation data. Furthermore, the final LSTM model
achieves an average loss function of 0.0376 on validation
data, using 20% of the data set for the testing stage.
The research objective was to examine the feasibility and
impact
of
applying
the
proposed
approach
to
class
prediction.
The
experimental
results
suggest
that
the
proposed method achieves good results on a big data set.
