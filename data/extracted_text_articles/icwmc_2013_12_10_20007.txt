Abstract—Bit-error-rate 
(BER) 
performance 
of 
coded 
cooperative networks with selection decode-and-forward (S-DF) 
relaying is analyzed over the Nakagami-m fading channels. 
Previously, in the literature, BER analysis was done only for 
the un-coded network, where an impractical symbol-based 
forwarding is employed. In this paper, we analyze the bit-
interleaved code modulation (BICM) coded cooperative 
network with an easy-to-implement packet-based forwarding. 
In particular, a closed-form BER expression is derived for the 
S-DF with source re-transmission (S-DF/RT) relaying, where 
the source re-transmits the packet to the destination on behave 
of a relay if it fails to decode. The accuracy of the proposed 
analysis is confirmed by computer simulations. 
Keywords-cooperative communication; bit-interleaved coded 
modulation; selection decode-and-forward. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Cooperative communication has recently emerged as a 
promising technique to combat multi-path fading in wireless 
systems, thanks to its ability to provide spatial diversity for 
the size-limited mobile terminals [1][2]. It exploits the 
broadcast nature of wireless communications by allowing 
intermediate nodes, called relays, to overhear the packet 
transmitted from the source and forward it to the destination. 
One of the commonly employed relaying methods is the 
fixed decode-and-forward (F-DF) [2][3], where relays 
decode the received packet, re-encode and forward it to the 
destination. However, as was shown in [2], F-DF fails to 
provide full diversity because the received packet is always 
forwarded by a relay even if it is decoded erroneously. 
Selection DF (S-DF) is a relaying method proposed in [2] to 
overcome the shortcoming of F-DF, where a relay forwards 
the overheard packet only when it is decoded correctly. In 
this way, a full diversity can be achieved.  
Performance analysis of the S-DF relaying has been a 
topic of extensive research [2][4]-[10]. Analyses were done 
over the Rayleigh fading channels from the aspects of 
capacity [4], outage probability [2][5] and symbol-error-rate 
(SER) [6], respectively. Very recently, analysis has been 
extended to the Nakagami-m fading channels in [7]-[10] for 
the un-coded network. In particular, in [7], SER was 
analyzed for a single-relay network under the correlated and 
uncorrelated channels, and exact SER was provided in [8] 
for multiple-relay networks. In [9], a closed-form expression 
for the moment generating function of the received signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination was derived, and it 
was used to evaluate SER, outage probability and channel 
capacity. Lastly, in [10], SER and diversity order were 
investigated for the networks with inter-relay links.  
In [6]-[10], the analyses were focused on the un-coded 
network using a symbol-based forwarding in which symbols 
are detected separately at a relay, and only the correct 
symbols are forwarded to the destination. Unfortunately, the 
symbol-based forwarding is not practical in real systems 
because whether a particular symbol is detected correctly or 
not is not known at the relay. In addition, a huge signaling 
overhead is needed for notifying exactly which symbols are 
forwarded.  
In this paper, we analyze the bit-interleaved coded 
modulation (BICM) [11][12] coded cooperative network 
over the Nakagami-m fading channels, using a packet-based 
forwarding which can be easily implemented by using a 
cyclic redundancy check (CRC). BICM has been extensively 
applied in real systems. To our best of knowledge, this work 
is the first attempt to do the performance analysis for such a 
system. Only the S-DF with source re-transmission (S-
DF/RT), where the source re-transmits the packet to the 
destination on behave of a relay if it fails to decode [2], is 
treated explicitly here; the S-DF with source idle in which 
source stays idle in the case of relay decoding failure can be 
viewed as a special case of S-DF/RT. A closed-form BER 
expression is derived, and simulation results are given to 
confirm the accuracy of the proposed analysis. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes 
the system models. BER performance is analyzed in Section 
III with numerical results presented in Section IV. Finally, 
conclusions are given in Section V. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODELS 
We consider the cooperative relaying network with one 
source, R   relays and one destination which are indexed by 
0, 1,, R  and 
1
R   , respectively. Each node is equipped 
with one antenna, and relays operate in the half-duplexing 
manner implying that they cannot transmit and receive 
simultaneously. In the S-DF/RT relaying [2], transmission of 
a packet is divided into two phases; at phase-I, the source 
broadcasts a packet to relays and the destination, and, at 
phase-II, relays forward the received packet over orthogonal 
channels to the destination if it is decoded correctly (with a 
CRC). In the case of decoding failure at a relay, on the other 
hand, the relay keeps silent, and the source retransmits the

packet on the relay’s behave over the orthogonal channel 
allotted to that relay. For convenience, the orthogonal 
channel allotted to relay j  at phase-II will be denoted as 
orthogonal-channel j .

assumed to be mutually independent, and under the 
assumption of a symbol inter-leaver with a depth larger than 
the channel coherent time, the channel gains of a channel 
are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) over 
different time index k . 
The general Nakagami-m fading model is adopted in 
this study, with the probability density function (pdf)

B. Bit-interleaved Coded Modulation 
BICM is employed at all nodes. At the source, an 
information bit sequence b  of length K  is encoded into a 
coded sequence c  of length N . After interleaving, the 
sequence is partitioned successively into groups of l  bits, 
called the labels, which are then mapped to a sequence of 
complex symbols

As can be seen, the analytical results obtained in (20) and 
(22) predict the BERs very accurately at performance of 
interest, say 
5
BER
10
. The PER prediction obtained in 
(21), on the other hand, is a bit mismatch with the true one, 
but the difference is only around 0.5  dB at 
3
PER=10 .  
Fig. 2 shows the simulation and analytical results of 
RT
bp ,2
 for Network-2, which is a 3-node network as well but 
with a varying channel condition on the S-R channel. 
Clearly, the analysis in (23) predicts the BER performance 
at the destination very accurately at 
5
BER
10
 for all the 
cases of 
n  2,4
 and 8. The slight difference between the 
analytical and simulation results for 
n  2
 is due to that in 
this case 
 
RT

 in (24) plays a more prominent role  
in determining 
RT
bp ,2
, and there is a bit error in predicting 
p f ,1
 as is shown in Fig. 2. In the typical scenarios of 
applying relay stations, the S-R channel often has a good 
channel condition; for example there is light-of-sight 
between the source and relay, and that results in a better 
BER prediction by the proposed analysis because in this 
case 
RT
bp ,2
 is well approximated by 
 

RT

bp
 and which can 
be predicted accurately. (see the cases of 
n  4
 and 8 in Fig. 
2.)   
Fig. 3 shows the simulation and analytical results for 
Network-3 (4 nodes) for the S-DF/RT with different 
constellations. As is shown, the predictions are quite 
accurate; a less than 0.3 dB error at BER of 
5
10  is 
observed.

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper investigates the performance of BICM-coded 
cooperative networks with the S-DF/RT relaying over the 
Nakagami-m fading channels. In particular, the BER 
performance is analyzed with a packet-based forwarding 
which can be implemented easily with CRC. In the literature, 
performance has been reported only for the un-coded system 
that uses an impractical symbol-based forwarding. A closed-
form expression is derived and verified by computer 
simulations. The numerical results show that the prediction 
error is less than 0.5 dB at 
5
BER
