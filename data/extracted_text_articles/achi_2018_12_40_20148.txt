Abstract-
Visually
impaired
persons
recognize
their
surrounding by using a white cane or a guide dog while they
walk. This skill called “Orientation and Mobility” is difficult to
learn. The training of the “Orientation and Mobility Skills” is
performed
at
the
school
for
visually
impaired
persons.
However, the evaluation of this skill is limited to subjective
evaluation by teacher. We have proposed that a quantitative
evaluation of the “Orientation and Mobility Skills” should be
required. In this paper, we tried to execute the quantitative
evaluation of the “Orientation and Mobility Skills” using brain
activity measurements. In this experiment, brain activity was
measured when subjects are walking in the corridor alone or
with a helper guide. Experimental subjects were sighted
persons whose visual information was blocked during walking.
The blood flow of prefrontal cortex was increased as the
movement distance of the subject increased when subjects
walked alone. From this result, it can be considered that the
feeling of fear and the attention relayed to “Orientation and
Mobility
Skills”
could
be
measured
quantitatively
by
measuring human brain activities.

INTRODUCTION
A visually impaired person recognizes the surroundings
using a white cane and/or a guide dog while walking. It is
very important to hear the environmental sounds for
recognition of their own position and surrounding situations
in details. This means, visually impaired people need
“Orientation and Mobility Skills” [1][2] to recognize the
surrounding situation by using sound information [3][4].
“Orientation and Mobility Skills” are necessary to move in
an unfamiliar place. The training to gain “Orientation and
Mobility Skills” is carried out at the school for visually
impaired. However, the evaluation of the education received
is a subjective method by teachers belonging to the school
for visually impaired person. It is difficult for the teacher to
understand everything the student recognizes even if a
student is able to successfully walk a very difficult path.
There is also a method of estimating the stress state during
exercise from HF / LF. However, HF / LF is affected by
heart rate variability due to exercise [5]. Therefore, we have
proposed that quantitative evaluation of the “Orientation and
Mobility Skills” should be required.
Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is easier to be used to
measure brain activity compared to other measurement
methods of brain activity such as Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) and functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (fMRI). In these other brain activities measuring
methods, the subject's posture needs to be fixed in a supine
position. Obviously, brain activity measurement during
walking is impossible with these devices. NIRS can measure
brain activity while subjects exercise. However, NIRS
measurement data is influenced by noise of various factors.
For example, there are noises due to heartbeat and body
movement.
It
is
also
difficult
to
separate
multiple
information stimuli into individual elements. In this paper,
we measured the brain activity data for the quantitative
evaluation of the “Orientation and Mobility Skills”.
In Section II, we describe the experimental method
conducted in this paper. In Section III, we describe brain
activity data obtained by these experiments. In Section IV,
we describe the relationship between brain activity data and
the stimulation by experimental tasks. In Section V, we
present the summary of this paper and future works.

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
The three experiments performed in this paper are
described below.

A)
Measurement of brain activity when walking alone in
the corridor without visual information.
In this experiment, the brain activity when subjects
walked alone was measured. The walking distance was
approximately
20m.
The
subjects
had
their
visual
information blocked by the eye mask. The resting time for
stabilizing the brain activity of the subjects was set before
and after walking. This resting time was more than 10
seconds. The experimental place was the corridor where
subjects walk on a daily basis. These experiments were
performed with no other pedestrians. Subjects were 6 males
who were sighted persons. The average age of them is 23.6
years old (SD = 0.47).
The experimental task setting was set as shown in the
upper part of Figure 3. All subjects of the experiment walked
on the same corridor. The subjects were instructed to walk at
a constant speed as much as possible. Subjects were orally
instructed the timing to start walking and stop walking. The
measurement equipment of brain activity used for the
experiment is “Pocket NIRS”, which was produced by
DynaSense Inc. in Japan (Figure 2). This NIRS device is
lightweight and could measure brain activity in two channels
in the prefrontal cortex. Measurement can be performed at a
sampling rate of 100 Hz.
B)
Measurement of brain activity when subjects walk with
helper guide in the corridor.
In the above experiment, subjects walked alone in the
corridor. In this experiment, the subjects walked with the
pedestrians who simulated the guide helper. The experiment
method was the same as the previous experiment. The
experimental method is shown in the lower part of Figure 3.
Subjects were the same persons as the A) experiment.
C) Measurement of brain activity when walking in a wide
space with visual blocking.
The environment of this experiment is different from the
A) and B) experiments. This experiment was performed in a
gymnasium. A large space like gymnasium has different
acoustic
characteristics
from
the
corridor.
Auditory
information is important for visually impaired persons to
perceive the surrounding environment. Visually impaired
persons also use their echoes and environmental sounds to
recognize their position and situation. Such ability is referred
to as obstacle perception. In the corridor, subject’s footsteps
sound from corridor floor reach the ear of the subject in a
short time. Thus, there is a possibility that the existence of
the wall could be recognized from the echo sound. In the
gymnasium, it takes longer time for subject's footsteps from
gymnasium floor to reach the subjects. On account of not
making the subject conscious with the floor, we conducted
this experiment in the gymnasium. The method of this
experiment was the same as the previous two experiments.
Subjects
were
the
same
persons
as
the
A)
and
B)
experiments.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A)
Measurement of brain activity when walking alone in
the corridor without visual information.
Figure 4 shows an example of brain activity data when
one subject walked alone. The red line shows the change in
oxygenated hemoglobin. The blue line shows the change in
deoxygenated hemoglobin. As a result of this experiment,
the cerebral blood flow did not increase when the subject
started walking according to the instructions. When the
movement distance of the subject increased to some extent, a

large increase in oxygenated hemoglobin could be confirmed
on right and left prefrontal cortex. After subjects were
instructed to stop walking, the blood flow on right and left
prefrontal cortex gradually decreased. This tendency was
seen from most subjects.
B)
Measurement of brain activity when subjects walk with
a helper guide in the corridor.
Figure 5 shows the brain activity result of the subjects
when walking with a pedestrian who simulated a guide
helper. In this experiment, the subject's cerebral blood flow
decreased slightly after the onset of the gait task. Even when
the migration distance increased, the concentration of
oxygenated hemoglobin in the blood did not increase greatly.
In an oral survey after the experiment, subjects said that they
were able to concentrate on walking without feeling uneasy
in this experiment.
C)
Measurement of brain activity when walking in a wide
space with visual blocking.
Figure 6 shows the measurement results when walking
alone. Figure 7 shows the result of brain activity when
accompanied by a pedestrian simulating a helper guide. An
increase of blood flow on the prefrontal cortex was seen
when the subject received instructions to walk. However, an
increase in oxygenated hemoglobin that continued was not
confirmed during walking. When subjects walk with a helper
guide, there was no change in oxygenated hemoglobin
similar to the previous experiment in the corridors.
IV.
DISCUSSION
In these experiments, measuring brain activity was
performed when subjects walked with a helper guide and
when subjects walked alone. When subjects walked alone, it
could be considered that subjects were in the state of mental
strain. When subjects walked with a pedestrian who
simulated a helper guide, subjects could rely on a pedestrian
for
safety
confirmation
and
were
able
to
walk
by
concentrating on walking. When subjects walked alone,
most subject's oxygenated hemoglobin on prefrontal cortex
did not show an increase after instruction to start walking.
As subject's walking distance increased, most subject's
oxygenated hemoglobin on prefrontal cortex was increased.
Such a change in oxygenated hemoglobin is considered that
subjects are strongly conscious of the possibility of collision
with the wall or other obstacles. When subjects stopped
walking, the oxygenated hemoglobin in prefrontal cortex
decreased gradually.
In the case of accompanying the pedestrian who

simulated with helper guide, an increase of oxygenated
hemoglobin in prefrontal cortex as compared with the case
of walking alone could not be confirmed. Oxygenated
hemoglobin
in
the
prefrontal
cortex
of
the
subjects
decreased slightly during walking.
In addition, when subjects walked alone in the large
space such as a gymnasium, no increase in oxygenated
hemoglobin was observed with increased walking distance.
Therefore, it is considered that the subject was able to walk
without being conscious of a collision with a wall or an
obstacle.
V.
CONCLUSION
NIRS devices can measure brain activity easily without
restraining the subject compared to other brain activity
measuring devices. However, the obtained brain activity
data may contain many noises originating from body
movements and heartbeats. In the experiment conducted in
this paper, the subjects were instructed to keep the walking
speed as constant as possible. As the result, only heartbeat
noise could be confirmed. This noise was sufficiently
smaller than the brain activity data. Previous studies have
not observed a large change in oxygenated hemoglobin
during slow walking as well [6].
It is thought that brain activities data which were
measured
in
these
experiments
include
subjects'
consciousness of collision with walls and obstacles. We
think that there is a possibility to quantitatively measure if
visually impaired persons correctly process the information
and walk without feeling uneasy.
In the future work, we think that it is necessary to
increase the number of subjects and types of experimental
tasks. The place we used for experiments in this paper was a
facility frequently used by subjects. As a psychological
element, it is an experimental task that does not include
brand new environment or interest.
