Abstract—With a multifold increase in the number of mobile 
users over past few years, mobile malware has emerged as a 
serious threat for resource constrained handheld devices. 
From experience of the Internet malware attacks like 
CodeRed and Slammer, it may not be difficult to predict the 
extent of devastation mobile malware could potentially 
cause. Numbering around 700 today, detection of mobile P2P 
malware may prove a serious challenge considering scarce 
memory, processing and battery resources of handheld 
devices. Issue may worsen if the detection takes place on 
mobile devices. Thus there is a strong need of identifying 
commonalities between various kinds of mobile malware to 
reduce the detection footprint. As a novel contribution, this 
work discusses various possibilities of classification of mobile 
malware 
and 
proposes 
a 
technical 
behaviour-based 
classification that could help detect a range of malware 
families in real time based on their behaviour during various 
stages of an attack.

I.    INTRODUCTION 
 
There exist over two billion mobile phones in the 
world today. Statistics from a survey conducted by Dong 
et al [1] reveal that Symbian is the leading operating 
system in terms of market density with 63% of the market 
share followed by Windows OS with 16% market density 
and Palm OS with 10% market penetration. Substantially 
large penetration of Symbian OS makes it a hot target for 
mobile worms and viruses. There are over 400 various 
kinds of mobile malware and around 700 of their variants 
discovered so far while approximately 90% of this 
malware targets Symbian-based handhelds [1]. It is 
difficult to develop an electronic system that detects all of 
these viruses as they use different strategies to attack the 
system. Mobile viruses and worms are known to have 
commonalities in terms of their behaviours however, no 
technical categorization of such malware exists to-date 
[2]. 
Besides common propagation avenues (i.e. MMS & 
SMS, Bluetooth and Mobile Internet), there are many 
other ways the malware could propagate in mobile P2P 
networks. Services like GPRS allow mobile devices to 
create IP connections with remote servers through cellular 
vendor’s network. This may allow an adversary to take 
advantage of inherently weak defenses of resource 
constrained mobile devices. Use of WLAN on handhelds 
may also put smartphones at risk from various kinds of 
security threats [3]. Copying files to mobile devices 
through removable media such as SD cards has proven 
dangerous with regards to virus replication. Email 
applications and instant messaging can also act as an 
avenue for malware propagation while web browsing on 
handhelds can be dangerous in terms of download and 
execution of malicious code on mobile device. Damages 
due to malware propagation through any of the means 
above can range from loss of privacy and transfer of 
unsolicited information to the system malfunctioning and 
failure. 
Malware 
causing 
service 
disruptions 
and 
economic losses can be termed critical though. Figure 1 
gives an overview of threat levels of prominent mobile 
malware by different antivirus companies.    
 
 
 
Figure 1: Malware Rating by Antivirus Companies 
 
This work mainly intends at giving new dimensions to 
the classification of mobile P2P malware and discusses 
novel contributions in terms of technical classification of 
malware in Section 4 and the modifications to an existing 
classification mechanism proposed by Kim et al [4] in 
Section 3. Section 2 discusses another classification of 
malware based on propagation technologies. Although a 
very generic and rather theoretical classification of mobile 
malware could be based on operating system alone 
however, we keep this work focused on technical 
classification that could act as a baseline for detection of 
malware in real time.  
 
II.    CLASSIFICATION BASED ON PROPAGATION 
TECHNOLOGY 
 
This section classifies mobile worm infections in terms 
of propagation technologies i.e. Bluetooth, MMS/SMS 
and Internet. It also paves the way for more elaborate 
technical categorizations in coming sections.       
 
A.   Infections through Bluetooth  
 
3G/4G mobile devices are usually equipped with 
short-range transmission technologies like Bluetooth and 
Infrared. This allows them to communicate directly with 
other devices nearby rather than through communication 
via a cellular services provider’s network. Bluetooth 
35

technology can be deemed as one of the contributing 
factors that gave rise to the concept of mobile P2P 
networks however, it could also be proclaimed as a major 
factor behind propagation of peer-related mobile malware 
in handheld devices. Bluetooth-based malware propagates 
using Bluetooth capabilities of mobile phones and exploits 
vulnerabilities 
of 
Bluetooth 
technology 
to 
cause 
catastrophes 
in 
mobile 
P2P 
networks. 
Bluetooth 
technology 
is 
known 
for 
its 
inherent 
security 
vulnerabilities, 
Bluetooth 
and 
others 
short-range 
technologies like Infrared open new avenues of threat 
dissemination from neighbours. Figure 2 gives a pictorial 
view of the propagation strategy adopted by the worms 
like Cabir [5], Metal Gear [6], PBSteal [7] and Lasco [6] 
mainly using Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth data 
transfer directly between P2P handhelds makes these 
resource-constrained devices and the mobile network 
extremely vulnerable to worm attacks.    
Once infected through its mobile peer, a victim will 
attempt to propagate malware further through the same 
strategy. Victim not only suffers in terms of battery drain 
but also in terms of infection to SIS or system files. 
Infected applications or even operating system may not 
function properly, hence leaving a mobile functionally 
dead. Variants of such mobile worms may also propagate 
secret mobile information to other devices through 
Bluetooth.   
 
 
 
Figure 2: Bluetooth Worm Attack 
 
B.   Infections through SMS & MMS  
 
MMS and SMS can be considered primary services in 
terms of mobile usage. Cellular service providers are 
offering enticing packages to attract customers use more 
MMS and SMS services. These services however could 
also be used as launching pad for different kinds of worm 
attacks in mobile networks. Worms like Mabir [8] and 
Commwarrior [5] propagate infection through MMS 
messages while malware like Mquito [9], Wesber [10] and 
RedBrowser [5] send premium rate SMS messages and 
incur costs on victim mobiles. An important motive of the 
attackers is to incur cost on customer. Mobile worms like 
Mabir and Commwarrior are capable of propagating 
through MMS thus giving worm propagation a global 
perspective. Figure 3 illustrates the attack scenario in 
which an infected mobile node can infect another mobile 
through a malicious MMS sent via MMS server. Variants 
of SMS worms besides sending premier-rate SMS 
messages could also disclose a mobile’s private 
information to its neighbours.  
 
 
Figure 3: MMS & SMS Worm Attack 
 
 C.  Infections through Fixed P2P Networks (Mobile 
Internet) 
 
A key attraction in use of mobile P2P networks is a 
tempting large repository of free downloadable content 
over World Wide Web. Besides mobile P2P applications 
like MBit and PeerBox, mobile peers can also interact 
directly with peers on fixed P2P networks. CDMA and 
GSM based 3G cellular networks offer higher data rates 
with rather reduced costs for downloading content. This 
entices more mobile customers to access P2P content 
through mobile Internet and hence become vulnerable. 
Doomboot [12], BBProxy [11], CARDTRAP [14], Metal 
Gear, PBSteal and RedBrowser are typical examples of 
malware that is downloaded onto mobile peers this way. 
Authors in [13] propose an architecture in which mobile 
peers are no different than fixed peers if a few P2P-
specific servers are deployed in cellular vendor’s network. 
Their framework enables mobile users transparently 
download P2P content from the Internet however it might 
put mobile peers at a direct risk of security attacks from 
Internet. Figure 4 illustrates another scenario in which 
worms originating from fixed P2P network could infect a 
device after downloading malicious content. Infected 
device could then infect other devices using data entities 
of the service provider’s network.    
This category mainly includes the malware that can be 
downloaded from the Internet while browsing fixed P2P 
networks. It then has capability to propagate further on 
mobile 
P2P 
network 
using 
different 
propagation 
strategies. This category of infections also includes worms 
from the previous two categories, such as RedBrowser, 
Metal Gear and Mquito that are downloaded through web 
browsing or accessing P2P content over the Internet. 
Victim devices are thus turned into launching pads for 
further attacks.

Figure 4: Worm Attack through P2P Core 
 
It was observed that although this classification can act 
as a baseline for future classifications, it might not be 
capable of providing a practical categorization of mobile 
malware capable of detecting malware families in real 
time. A same worm can potentially use different 
technologies to propagate during its infection and hence 
making identification of malware rather infeasible through 
this way of classification. Thus we proceed to the next 
section where a rather technical classification of malware 
is suggested and which to some extent is capable of 
detecting individual worms rather distinctly during an 
attack. 
 
III.    CLASSIFICATION BASED ON INFECTION 
SEQUENCE 
 
This section gives a categorization of malware in 
terms of sequence of operations performed by malware 
during an infection. Kim et al give set of operations for 
each of the four types of worms they brought under 
discussion. A set holds operations in a sequence they 
occur during an attack. Each line in Table 1 gives 
behaviour of a distinct malware in terms of sequence of 
operations. We extend the work of Kim et al by 
introducing more operations that enables us to cover 
further malware types. Rest of this section discuss various 
operations that could form the basis of detection of 
distinct malware types. 
 
 
EXEC:  This operation involves execution of 
malware code on a node to infect it and initiation 
of the process of propagation of malware. Generic 
SI model of propagation of malware assumes that 
every node that downloads the malware should 
execute it and thus get infected. Every infection 
starts with EXEC phase however EXEC may have 
different consequences in different types of 
malware. 
 
CRT_MSG: To transmit the infection, infected 
payload is created and in subsequent phases 
forwarded to the vulnerable devices. Payload for 
Bluetooth based infections like Cabir differs from 
SMS based infections like Mosquito.  
 
BT_SCAN: In Bluetooth based infections like 
Cabir, Lasco & PB Stealers, infected file created 
through CRT_MSG is propagated to all the 
Bluetooth devices in coverage are (i.e. in 
neighbour set). Hence a Bluetooth scan must takes 
place through Service Discovery Protocol [15] to 
discover the active Bluetooth neighbours. 
 
PB_SCAN: Infection through MMS propagation 
like Commwarrior, Mabir and Beselo involve 
selection of contacts (i.e. victims) from the 
phonebook for onward transmission of malware. 
Browsing of the phonebook for this sole purpose 
is covered under PB_SCAN.  
 
RD_PRM: Worms like RedBrowser, Mosquito & 
GameSat send premier-rate SMS messages to 
specific phone numbers for the purpose of 
financial gains against victim. Attempt to read a 
premier number from the memory may be another 
significant operation in terms of detection of such 
kinds of malware.   
 
SND_BT: After scanning for active Bluetooth 
devices around, malware is transmitted to those 
devices. SND_BT records the device IDs and the 
total number of Bluetooth enabled devices to 
which the malware is being propagated. Section to 
come will reveal that the number of devices to 
which the malware is propagated plays an 
important role in identification of a family. 
 
SND_MMS: Following EXEC, CRT_MSG and 
PB_SCAN, next step in the MMS based infections 
is to send the infected multimedia-message to the 
selected contacts from the phonebook. Cellular 
network radio interface is used to get the 
messages delivered. Again, the number of 
contacts to which the MMS is being sent plays an 
important role in identification of malware 
families in future detections.   
 
SND_SMS: For the SMS based malware families, 
premier rate SMS messages are sent form the 
infected device using Short Messaging Service 
Centre (SMSC) [16] of the cellular network. Apart 
from 
the 
SMS 
infection 
scenario 
above, 
SND_SMS also executes in other variants of SMS 
based malware that repeatedly send random 
messages 
containing 
personal 
information 
(suppose phonebook entries) of an infected device 
to its neighbours.    
 
CPT_BNRY: Worm families like Doomboot 
besides other MMS and Bluetooth related 
operations also corrupt system binaries on an 
infected device. Consequently, the victim device 
could fail on reboot. This unique operation may 
play a vital role in aimed future detections of this 
kind of families.   
 
LOG_SCAN: 
Worm 
families 
like 
Lasco 
constantly scan the call-logs of infected mobile 
and reply any incoming message with copies of 
the 
malware. LOG_SCAN operation could 
distinguish this type of malware from others.  
 
USR_IDLE: This operation is aimed at the 
detection of user idle time by logging data about 
key-presses and interaction of user with the 
device. Malware may propagate without the 
knowledge of phone user and logging such 
37

information 
may 
prove 
very 
effective 
in 
prevention of various malware related attacks.  
Building up on the work of Kim et al, Table 1 gives 
sequence of operations for two new families i.e. Call-
Loggers & Premier Chargers to be discussed in next 
section on lines 4 and 5.  
 
TABLE 1. CLASSIFICATION BASED ON SET OF OPERATIONS  
 
1. EXEC › CRT_MSG › BT_SCAN › SND_BT 
 
2. EXEC › CRT_MSG › BT_SCAN › SND_BT › PB_SCAN › SND_MMS  
 
3. EXEC › CRT_MSG › BT_SCAN › SND_BT › PB_SCAN › SND_MMS › 
CPT_BNRY 
 
4. EXEC › CRT_MSG › BT_SCAN › SND_BT › PB_SCAN › LOG_SCAN › 
SND_MMS  
 
5. EXEC › CRT_MSG › RD_PRM  › SND_SMS  
 
 
Although we have succeeded in extending the work of 
Kim et al in terms of adding new families and operations, 
the basic limitation of their work is its inherent 
incapability of detection of malware families as it purely 
follows a malware-specific classification model. For 
instance, their model fails in distinguishing between 
Commwarrior and Mutational Commwarrior (contains 
Beselo & Disco worms) families. A detection model based 
on their classification model may require definition (as in 
Table 
1) 
for 
every 
single 
malware 
discovered. 
Maintaining such a memory-intensive up-to-date database 
may not be feasible on resource constrained mobile 
devices and hence we propose a classification model 
capable of acting as a baseline for detection of malware 
families. 
 
IV.    CLASSIFICATION BASED ON BEHAVIOUR 
DURING ATTACK 
 
After attempting to classify malware based on the 
transmission technology and then on the sequence of 
operations a malware perform under an attack, this section 
gives a classification of malware based on their behaviour. 
Table 1 would suggest that although every set distinctly 
elaborates the behaviour of a particular malware, most of 
the operations in the database (Table 1) are redundant. 
Hence rather than selecting the whole set to describe a 
malware type, under this classification, we select key 
classification features pertaining to a group of various 
malware and name them as flags. Feature extraction and 
flagging mechanism is explained through Figure 5. Every 
malware family exhibits one or many characteristics 
named as flags in lower part of Figure 5. Sequence of 
occurrence of flags will eventually determine a malware 
family. Feature extraction also results in considerable 
reduction of the malware behaviour storage footprint. 
 
Step 1 of the classification based on behaviours is the 
identification of the core threat conditions during an attack 
and setting an appropriate flag to High if that conditions 
becomes to true while Step 2 will be to see that to what 
family this flag or the combination of flags belong to, thus 
declaring an appropriate alarm. Section below explains 
some of the extracted behaviours (pertaining to various 
classes of malware) that would help distinctly identify a 
malware family. These extracted behaviours are called 
flags.  
 
 
Figure 5: Classification Based on Behaviours 
 
A. BT Propagator 
 
Worms like Cabir, Lasco, PBStealer exhibit this threat 
condition as do a few malware droppers like Cdropepr 
[17] and MGDropper [18]. BT_SCAN alongwith 
SND_BT triggers this flag while the conditions like 
malware replication to all the active neighbours and 
repetition of this flag confirms the existence of a malware 
activity relating to a Bluetooth malware family. 
 
B. BT Mutator 
 
BT Mutator flag corresponds to the malware that uses 
Bluetooth technology for its replication onto its 
neighbours and mutates its signature after little iteration. 
Variants of Cabir family use mutational strategies to 
remain undetected during attack. Most of the signature-
based detection techniques fail in detecting such mutations 
however the proposed behaviour-based detection is 
inherently capable of detecting them. 
 
C. BT Replay 
 
This class encompasses the malware that uses 
Bluetooth technology for propagation to active neighbours 
of an infected device. Trojans like PBSteal repeatedly 
send copies of phone-critical information to first 
connecting neighbour in the list. Alongside stealing 
phone-critical information, the main motive of such 
malware is to flush the battery power of infected mobile 
device as well as the recipient of this transmission. Some 
dropper like SendTool [19] that eventually drop PBSteal 
into the target victim’s inbox can also be put into this 
category. 
 
D. BT Stealer 
 
On of the main motive of the malware exhibiting this 
behaviour is to disclose the phone and user critical 
38

information to the neighbours around. Malware like 
PBStealer [20] could be put in this category that after 
infecting 
a 
device, 
makes 
this 
devices 
transmit 
confidential information to all its neighbours and repeats 
this behaviour with constant intervals. PBSteal and 
SendTool could also be put in this category of malware. 
Relying on various other aspects beyond the scope of this 
discussion, detections in future stages of this project will 
be capable of distinctly identifying malware from BT 
Replay and BT Stealer families.  
 
E. MMS N Friends 
 
MMS N Friends is one of the most important threat 
conditions in which an infection is propagated to a fixed 
number of contacts selected from the phonebook of a 
device. This operation is repeated with constant intervals 
(in most of the cases interval gap is 10 minutes). 16 
Variants of the Commwarrior family and droppers like 
Commdropper [21] could be put in this category.  
 
F. MMS Replay 
 
One of the consequences of the malware exhibiting 
this condition is depletion of battery resources of infected 
and target mobiles. Infected mobiles send repeated copies 
of the same multimedia message to same mobiles every 
few minutes. As MMS is a premium service, cost incurred 
by the victim as a result of this replication could be way 
too high. Such kind of MMS replay attacks have resulted 
in various DoS attacks on MMS servers in the past [22]. 
 
G. MMS Mutator 
 
Even with MMS based malware families, mutation 
becomes a key challenge for signature-based techniques. 
Worms like Beselo and Disco [23] are similar in 
propagation behaviour to the Commwarrior families but 
their strategy to mutate makes them qualify to be 
identified as a distinct family. 
 
H. MMS Call-Logger 
 
Worms like Mabir listen very intelligently to the call 
logs on an infected mobile phone and reply to the 
incoming traffic with an infected MMS. Receiving victim 
device assumes malicious MMS as reply of its message, 
executes the file attached to the MMS and gets infected. 
 
1. MMS Binary Corruptors  
 
Characteristic that makes this family distinct and 
rather deadly from the Commwarrior family is that 
followed by a Commwarrior like infection, it also corrupts 
the system binaries of the victim mobile thus making it 
unable to reboot at the next start-up. Worms like 
Doomboot belong to this family of malware. 
 
J. SMS Premier Charger 
 
Malware families exhibiting this characteristic aim at 
incurring financial losses to the victim. Making use of 
SMS technology, the infected devices are made to send an 
SMS message to premier numbers every few minutes. 
RedBrowser, GameSat [24] and Mosquito are the most 
common worms that may fall under this family of 
malware. Symbian OS Viver [25] is more aggressive as it 
sends a premier message every 15 seconds and may cause 
a huge financial loss if remains undetected ever for a 
shorter time.  
 
K. SMS Randomizer  
 
By constantly listening at the call logs of victim 
mobile, this class of malware responds to every SMS or 
call with a random SMS message. Motivation behind this 
attack is to incur financial loss on the customer. In future 
though, SMS randomiser can be used to launch more 
classified attacks like MMS Call-Logger. Symbian trojans 
like SrvSender [30] belong to this family of malware. 
 
L. Spy-Server 
 
Discovered in January 2010, Ikee worm [29] for the 
IPhoneOS [26] devices belongs to this category of 
malware. Ikee makes victim IPhones periodically transmit 
phone-critical information to a remote server. Cross-
platform spyware like Flexispy [27], Mobispy [28] and 
Blackberry spyware MobiStealth [31] also belong to this 
category of malware.  
 
V.    DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION 
 
Table 2 gives various flags based on which the 
malware families are identified.

Every flag represents a distinct behaviour and 
characteristic of malware during an attack. A distinct set, 
sequence or pattern of flags represents the very core 
functionality of a malware family and thus forms the basis 
of its detection. Some of the families might not be 
detectable through one flag alone. BP flag alone if TRUE 
means alarms about an underway Cabir family infection 
while a specific pattern of repetition of BP flag confirms 
this infection. If both BP and MN flags are TRUE, it will 
prompt a Commwarrior family infection. Similarly if BP 
and MR flags are TRUE, it represents a Mutational 
Commwarrior family infection while MR flag alone if 
TRUE will indicate an MMS Replay family attack. 
It was observed that the malware classification based 
on communication technology alone was not appropriate 
because different kinds of malware propagating even 
though 
similar 
technology 
may 
have 
varying 
characteristics in terms of motives, damages and infection 
strategy. Extensions to the operation database of Kim et al 
although resulted in detection of more malware types 
however, the model fails to detect the malware families 
due to its inherent incapabilities. As their solution requires

logging definition of every malware in the detection 
database, its size may also prove a major concern for 
resource constraint mobile devices. Based on the example 
of Commwarrior and Mutational Commwarrior families in 
Section 3, it was also realized that the traditional signature 
based techniques may fail in identification of malware 
families 
while 
even 
some 
behavioural 
detection 
techniques like the one proposed by Kim et al may not 
prove effective in identification of mobile malware 
families. Alongside considerable reduction the in size of 
detection 
database, 
novel 
classification 
based 
on 
behaviours proposed in Section 4 has also proved capable 
of distinctly identifying 12 malware families that 
accommodate over 200 worms and make about 25% of the 
total detected mobile malware [32].
