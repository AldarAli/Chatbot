Abstract
Measurements of local and wide-area network trafc
in the 90's established the relation between burstiness
and self-similarity of network trafc. Several papers
demonstrated
that
the
widely
used
Poisson
based
models could not be applied for the past decade's
network trafc. Recent papers have questioned the
direct applicability of these results in networks of the
new century. Some authors of these papers demand
the revision of previous assumptions on the Poisson
trafc models. They argue that as newer and newer
network technologies are implemented and the amount
of Internet trafc grows exponentially, the burstiness of
network trafc might cancel out due to the huge number
of aggregated trafc ows. Some results are based on
analyses of high-speed Internet backbone links and other
trafc traces. We analyzed the same trafc traces and
applied novel methods to characterize them in terms of
packet interarrival time. We demonstrate that the series
of interarrival times in the 2003 traces is still close
to a self-similar process. Since then, new trafc traces
have been made public, including ones captured from
OC-192 links of the Internet backbone in 2008. We also
compare the 2008 trafc traces with the ones captured
in 2003 and apply our analytical methods to illustrate
the tendency of Internet trafc burstiness in recent
years. We found that the burstiness of the interarrival
times decreased signicantly compared to earlier traces.
Index Terms— Internet trafc; burstiness; Lévy Flights.
1. Introduction
Network congestion can be caused by several factors.
The most dangerous cause of congestion is the burstiness
of the network trafc. Recent results make evident that
high-speed network trafc is more bursty and its vari-
ability cannot be predicted as assumed previously. It has
been shown that network trafc has similar statistical
properties on many time scales. Trafc that is bursty
on many or all time scales can be described statistically
using the notion of self-similarity. Self-similar trafc has
observable bursts on all time scales.
One of the consequences of burstiness is that combin-
ing the various ows of data, as it happens for example
in the Internet, does not result in the smoothing of
trafc. Measurements of local area network trafc [20]
and wide-area network trafc have proved [21] that the
widely used Markovian process models could not be
applied for today's network trafc. If the trafc were
Markovian process, the trafc's burst length would be
smoothed by averaging over a long time scale contra-
dicting with the observations of today's trafc character-
istics. Combining bursty data streams will also produce
bursty combined data ow. Various papers discuss the
impact of the burstiness on network congestion [1], [3]
and [8]. Their conclusions are that congested periods can
be quite long with losses that are heavily concentrated.
The self-similarity of network trafc was observed
in numerous papers, such as [3], [9], [22] and [25].
These and other papers showed that packet loss, buffer
utilization, and response time were totally different when
simulations used either real trafc data or synthetic data
that included self-similarity [10], [11].
Papers, such as [16] and [31] challenge the direct
applicability of these results for today's network traf-
c. They argue that traditional Poisson models can be
used again to characterize the aggregate trafc ow of
multiplexed large numbers of independent sources in
the Internet backbone [17], [30]. Their explanation is
that as the amount of Internet trafc grows dramatically
mainly due to the implementation of ber optic backbone
links, the burstiness of network trafc might cancel out
as a result of the large number of multiplexed packet
ows. The paper describes the analyses of packet traces
captured in the Internet backbone. The authors found
that packet arrivals followed the Poisson distribution at
sub-second time scales, appeared to be nonstationary
at multi-second time scales, and the same packet trace
showed evidence of long-range dependence at scales of
seconds and above.

By the end of 90's, many previous works also analyzed
the burstiness and the correlation structure of Internet
trafc in various time scales according to the behavior
of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in terms of
timeouts, congestion avoidance, self-clocking, etc. The
paper [5] applied a wavelet-based multiresolution tool
to analyze the scaling behavior of Internet trafc on
short time scales. This paper was one of the rst works
showing evidence that Internet trafc could be analyzed
by a multifractal model. Recent studies in [[7], [2],
and [24]] have also proved that Internet trafc exhibits
not only monofractal properties, but also a multifractal
nature. Actual measurements have demonstrated that
low-aggregate network trafc can have more complex
properties than assumed previously.
The paper [12] illustrated that short time scale bursti-
ness was independent of the TCP ow arrival process and
showed that in networks with light trafc, correlations
across different ows did not have an effect on the
short scale burstiness. Internet trafc was classied in
alpha and beta ows in the paper [28]. It was shown
that large transfers over high-capacity links, called alpha
ows, produced non-Gaussian trafc, while the beta
ows, low-volume transmissions, produced Gaussian and
long-range dependent trafc. Long sequence of back-to-
back packets can cause signicant correlations in short
time scales. The reasons of sending long back-to-back
packets in TCP or UDP sources were analyzed in [14],
such as UDP message segmentation, TCP slow start, lost
ACKs, etc. The same authors in [15] identied the actual
protocol mechanisms that were responsible for creating
bursty trafc in small time scales. It was shown that
TCP self-clocking could shape the packet interarrivals
of a TCP connection in a two-level ON-OFF pattern.
The pattern causes burstiness in time scales up to the
round-trip time of the TCP connection.
In our paper we analyzed the same trafc traces as in
[16] and [35], and applied novel methods to characterize
them. The network trafc traces are considered as a
time series of the arrival times of the packets. Due
to space limitation the analysis of the packet lengths
is omitted. The arrival times form a monotone in-
creasing series. The interarrival times are independent,
identically distributed random variables. The classical
modeling of the interarrival times goes back to Erlang,
who successfully modeled the phone calls by a Poisson
process with interarrival times distributed exponentially.
We generalize his model by changing the distribution
to a general family of innitely divisible distributions
and by the corresponding Lévy processes [29]. Since
a subset of these distributions—called 
Since the interarrival times are positive, we consider
STLF with a totally asymmetric distribution. It is given
by the cumulant function (log of the characteristic func-
tion)

timestamp precision along with the packet lengths for
both IPv4 and IPv6 packets separately. It is noticeable
from the size of the traces that direction A had less trafc
then direction B. A possible reason of the difference is
that many content servers were located at one end of the
link. Another interesting observation of the trafc was
that based on a smaller sample, only a small portion
(~8.6%) of IPv4 addresses was captured as both source
and destination IP addresses in packets after merging
both directions. This could be the indication that the
network trafc in this area of the backbone may have
been routed asymmetrically (Email communications with
Emile Aben, Data Administrator, CAIDA/SDSC/UCSD).
4. Packet interarrival times
The series of interarrival times in the OC-48 traces
are modeled as stochastic series. If the series corre-
spond to a Poisson process, then the interarrival times
have exponential distribution. In Figure 1 we tted
the Gamma distribution to the interarrival times of the
OC-48 traces captured on April, 24, 2003 (20030424-
001000-0-anon.pcap). (The Gamma distribution is more
general than the exponential distribution. It reduces to
the exponential distribution, if the shape parameter is
1:)

Although
the
estimated
parameters
(0.945761,
30.3951) suggest that the distribution of the interarrival
times is close to the exponential distribution, the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test strongly rejects the hypothesis
that
the
series
follows
the
Gamma
distribution.
Consequently, the corresponding process cannot be a
Poisson process. Therefore we reject the hypothesis that
the packet trace follows a Poisson process.
We continue the search for a distribution that would
be suitable for characterizing the interarrival times by
applying the family of Lévy processes.
The Poisson process is one of the simplest Lévy
processes (see, e.g., [29]) with the main assumption
that the increments—the interarrival times— are inde-
pendent, homogeneous and exponential. Changing the
distribution of the increments we obtain a wide variety
of Lévy-stable processes as candidates for modeling the
interarrival times [37]. Lévy-stable processes show heavy
tail behavior making it impossible to apply them for the
measured interarrival times: Figure 1 depicts that there
are very few measurements after 200 micro second. The
heavy tail of a distribution also implies that the moments
do not exist, so these distributions are not appropriate
for modeling purposes. Other members of the family of
Lévy processes, the Smoothly Truncated Lévy Flights
(STLF), have higher order moments. Since they have
been successfully applied for nance, biological, and
physical phenomena it is reasonable to apply it for trafc
analysis as well. Some applications of the STLF are
demonstrated in [23], [19], [13], and [34]. The following
formula of the cumulants of STLF provides a means for
estimating the parameters by the method of moments,
i.e., calculating the empirical values from the trafc
traces and compare them with the theoretical values
above:

where b = 0:15570, b = 0:01768, ba = 1:30567. Since
the tting is good, it implies that this trace is close to
the self-similar process because the value of  is very
small. At the same time the trace is not too far from the
exponential distribution considering that the value of 
is small and a is close to 1.
Table 2 and 3 show the estimated parameters of the
OC-48 ve minute traces.
In general, we can conclude that the distribution of
these traces are close to  - stable distribution, since
the estimations of  are very small, hence the process is
close to a self-similar process (see Property 1 in section
II. A). It is also clear from the parameters that the traces
in direction '1' are closer to the exponential distribution
(see Property 2 in section II. A) than the ones in direction
'0', since the parameter  is small and a is close to 1
at least in these traces: 05_1, 10_1, 25_1, 45_1, and
50_1. Therefore, the traces in direction '1' are closer to

reason for the different characteristics of the trafc traces
in directions '0' and '1' is under investigation.
4.2 Analysis of OC-192 traces
Since the OC-192 datasets are signicantly larger that
the OC-48 datasets, we consider the parameters of the
model being time dependent. We analyze the behavior
of the model at every 0.1 second. The parameters of the
model are estimated for the duration of 1 second interval.
We assume that the trafc traces are locally stationary.
The following gures depict the characteristics of the
trafc ow in direction B and A. (We use the notations
direction A and direction B to clearly distinguish the
results related to the traces captured in 2003 and in
2008.) Figure 3 clearly demonstrates that  (t) is not
close to zero, therefore the trafc ow in direction B does
not exhibit the attributes of a self-similar or a Poisson
process (see Property 1 and 2).
We obtained a similar gure for  (t) and a (t) as well,
see Figure 4-5.
In Direction A  is equal to zero in 43% of the
samples, while a's values are close to 1. Figure 6 shows
these values of a. The gure demonstrates that the trafc
trace is approaching the Poisson process in 43% of the
total samples.
5. Conclusion
We presented a novel model for analyzing the self-
similarity of Internet trafc captured by CAIDA. The
network trafc traces were considered as time series of
the arrival times of the packets. We characterized the
trafc traces with three parameters of Lévy Flights and
placed a particular trace somewhere in the space gen-
erated by the Poisson and self-similar Lévy processes.
Previous papers characterized the same traces as either
self-similar or not self-similar traces. We were able to
measure how close these packet traces were to being
self-similar. We analyzed two sets of traces; one captured
