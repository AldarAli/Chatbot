Abstract—This paper presents a dipole antenna with dual-band 
operation designed for sensing applications in ISM bands. The 
proposed antenna has the advantages of being low profile, low 
cost, easy to fabricate with a flexible design based on the 
microstrip antennas. A prototype has been fabricated and 
tested. The measured results show good gain performance and 
omnidirectional radiation patterns for all the resonant modes. 
The proposed structure is suitable for integration with any 
wireless sensors in the ISM bands.

 INTRODUCTION 
The exponential growth of wireless communications 
technology has increased the need for highly integrated RF 
modules operating in multiple frequency bands. This 
expansion has been driving the development of dual-band 
and multiband antennas, in order to integrate numerous 
frequency bands within the same RF module. Some dual-
band or multiband antennas performances reported recently 
allow achieving wireless applications taking advantage of the 
free license ISM bands. This includes radiofrequency 
identification (RFID), wireless local area network (WLAN), 
wireless sensor network (WSN), and sensing [1-4].  
 
Multiband operation involving 434 MHz, 915 MHz, 2.45 
GHz and 5.8 GHz ISM bands has been significantly 
investigated. The performances reported include dual-band 
antennas with only one resonant mode inside the ISM bands, 
and dual-band antennas with the two resonant modes inside 
the ISM bands. For dual-band antennas with the two ISM 
resonant modes, most of them operate at 915 MHz – 2.45 
GHz, or 2.45 GHz – 5.8 GHz. As single or dual resonant 
mode, the 434 MHz band has been involved recently in 
medical applications and passive acoustic sensor, which 
represents an emerging technology for gas sensors [5]. But 
amongst the frequency bands listed above, 434 MHz 
resonant mode is not involved enough in dual-band operation 
with another ISM resonant mode. Yet, this mode together 
with the 915 MHz resonant mode can avoid the use of two 
distinct antennas [6, 7], integrate the UHF RFID function [8] 
and take advantage of the free license bands for these two 
functions and others.  Dual-band antennas operating in 434 
MHz – 915 MHz bands have been proposed in [1] and [2]. 
The antenna presented [1] consists of a metal plate of 335 
mm x 155 mm x 1mm acting as RFID tag antenna  while the 
antenna presented in [2] is a double loop patch antenna 
 
 
 
ensuring a bidirectional communication between sensors in a 
wireless sensors network. These antennas are not suitable for  
sensing applications since the RFID tag proposed in [1] 
suffers from non-compact configuration and metallic 
structure, while the double loop antenna proposed in [2] 
needs a matching network to operate properly. 
 
This paper presents a dual-band dipole antenna with the 
two resonant modes at 434 MHz and 915 MHz within the 
ISM bands. The proposed antenna operates in the two free of 
charge ISM bands to improve sensing possibilities with the 
same device, and use the sensing application together with 
another function such as UHF RFID. This antenna has a 
compact configuration in regards to the resonant modes 
involved and is very suitable for integration with all the 
sensors bonded within any package. The proposed antenna 
structure has the advantages of having high gain with 
omnidirectional 
radiation 
patterns, 
adjustable 
design 
structure and low fabrication cost.

As depicted in Figure 1, each half of the proposed dipole 
antenna has two arms, in order to achieve ISM dual-band 
operation.  
 
Figure 2.  Layout of the proposed dual-band antenna 
Given the fact that resonant frequency is inversely 
proportional to the arm’s length, the shorter arm ensures the 
915 MHz band operation, whereas the long arm ensures the 
434 MHz operation. To achieve a compact configuration, the 
short arm has been folded down and the long arm has been 
meandered, so that the antenna is 17.34 x 3.4 x 1.541 (cm). 
These dimensions have been obtained while taking into 
consideration the trade-off between the performances of the 
antenna such as matching levels for each resonant mode, and 
the compactness of the antenna. Figure 2 shows the layout of 
dual-band dipole printed antenna with dimensions, designed 
for matching to a 50 Ω feed line.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Figure 3 shows the simulated and measured S11 
parameters performed on the prototype shown in Figure 1.  
 
 
Figure 3.  Simulated and measured return loss of the fabricated antenna 
The results show a good agreement between simulated 
and measured results. There are only two distinct resonant 
modes in the frequency band (300 MHz - 1.1 GHz), the low-
band resonant mode is at 448 MHz, and the high-band 
resonant mode is at 924.3 MHz. The measured return loss is 
less than -10 dB for (423 – 470 MHz) and for (896 – 956 
MHz) bands, which covers the whole ISM bands. To 
evaluate the far-field behavior of the antenna, radiation 
patterns have been measured. The radiation patterns have 
been carried out with the antenna orientated as shown in 
Figure 4 in regards to the Cartesian axes (x, y, z). Figure 5 
and Figure 6 show the cuts of the radiation patterns made in 
x-z plane, y-z plane and x-y plane at 433.3 MHz for the 
lower band and 916.6 MHz for the higher band, respectively.

From this comparison, this work proposed a compact 
configuration in regards to the dimensions of the metal plate 
antenna reported in [1]. Moreover, the metallic structure is 
very limited to implement sensing applications and 
compromises the integration of the antenna proposed in [1] 
together with a sensor inside the same device. The antenna 
proposed in [2] is a patch antenna like the one proposed in 
this paper. It can be easily integrated with any sensor bonded 
within a package that can be welded on PCB. The antenna 
reported in [2] has a compact design compared to the 
antenna proposed in this work but is devoted to bidirectional 
communication inside a WSN. Thus, it needs a matching 
network to operate properly, which is an additional 
constraint in the context of achieving sensing applications 
with passive devices. The antenna proposed in this work 
does not need any matching network and can be directly 
connected to the sensor on a printed circuit board to achieve 
wireless applications. Like the antenna reported in [1], the 
proposed antenna can used the 915 MHz band to achieve 
UHF RFID applications.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
Dual-band operation with a novel dipole patch antenna 
has been investigated and a prototype to operate in the 434 
and 915 MHz ISM bands has been constructed. The results 
with the fabricated prototype show good gain and 
omnidirectional radiation patterns in all the two frequency 
bands. The antenna is compact in regards to the resonant 
modes and suitable for sensing applications. The proposed 
antenna can take advantage of these two ISM bands to 
improve sensing possibilities with the same device and use 
the sensing application together with another application 
such as UHF RFID.
