Abstract—The use of mobile devices in Brazil has grown in 
different groups of people, making it an essential element in 
people’s daily communication. Although there is a high 
concentration of users in the age group 20-40 years, it is the 
visible increase  in  the  number  of  people  over  60  that  
interacts  with  mobile  devices,  especially  smartphones.  
These different groups of different ages have different needs 
with regard to interaction with mobile devices. The objective of 
this paper is to present the results of an exploratory study on 
the interaction of the older users with mobile devices in Brazil. 
For this, we used an exploratory study with potential users in 
Brazil. The exploratory study outcomes allowed us to draw the 
personas for the Brazilian scenario. The main interaction 
personas were identified and defined from this survey, aiming 
at an efficient representation of the group studied. The survey 
showed us that although the majority of users had mobile 
devices and used them for daily activities, some of them still 
face difficulties on handling them. 
Keywords-mobile devices; elderly user; personas. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The proliferation of mobile devices has been increasing 
in recent years around the world. Currently, there are about 
2.5 billion mobile phones in the world and about 80 % of the 
population has network coverage. It is estimated that in 2015 
there will be over 5 billion active mobiles [1]. 
This phenomenon also occurs in Brazil. Among the most 
commonly used mobile devices can highlight the smartphone 
with the resources that are increasingly seeking to improve 
user interaction with the resources of the devices and their 
applications. However, the needs and preferences are diverse 
forms of interaction for each group of users, as elderly users. 
According to the United Nations [2], there are currently 
nearly 900 million people aged 60 or more in the world. The 
expectation is that, by 2050, this number will reach 2.4 
billion people, demonstrating that population growth among 
the elderly will be faster compared to other sectors of the 
population. In Brazil, this growth is no different. According 
to the 2010 Censo [3] prepared by IBGE (Brazilian Institute 
of Geography and Statistics), the population aged 60 or 
older, which was 4.8 % in 1991, came to 5.9 % in 2000 and 
reached 7.4 % in 2010. The institute is estimating that in 
2025 the population of elderly people in the country will 
reach 34 million people. Evaluating the last decade, the 
number of elderly in the country increased by almost 4 
million people, the result of vegetative growth and the 
gradual increase in average life expectancy. This is certainly 
a large group of people, with growth trend in the coming 
years. 
The purpose of this article is to identify the 
characteristics of the users of old age and collect the main 
forms of use, difficulties and facilities in view of this group 
of users. The identification will be obtained through an 
exploratory study on the interaction of this group of users 
with mobile devices in Brazil. From this survey, we 
identified and defined the main personas interaction, aiming 
at an efficient representation of the group studied. As a 
contribution, it is hoped that this article demonstrates for 
developers of applications for mobile devices, the need to 
design specific forms of interaction for users of old age. 
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the 
exploratory research and discussion of the survey results, 
Section 3 presents personas raised and Section 4 discusses 
some conclusions of the research. 
II. 
EXPLORATORY SURVEY 
Users interact with computer systems, whether in desktop 
environment, web or mobile elements via its user interface 
(the part visible to the user of the system). This interface can 
be understood as a space of communication, one semiotic 
system in which signs are created and used to promote 
communication [4] [5]. The challenge of a user interface is to 
provide a space for communication so that this makes sense 
to the user who will use it [6]. During the searching for 
references on the subject, no articles were found about South 
America. Observing the lack in this area, the main goal was 
to collect data of the older user groups, analyzing their 
difficulties.  
In this sense, the development of interfaces for mobile 
devices public-facing seniors should clarify the meaning that 
these users have in relation to the environment and the 
systems in which they interact in their day-to-day [7]. 
In order to achieve the goal, a questionnaire was 
formulated and given to the target audience. The planning 
and carrying out of the activity are described below. 
A. Planning 
Marconi and Lakatos [8] claim that an exploratory 
research can use questionnaires, interviews, participant 
observation and content analysis. In this work, we decided 
for the development and application on a questionnaire 
online; the application targeted for users participating in two 
groups of elderly. The content of the questionnaire was 
assembled based on related work and the goal set. The 
21

questionnaire has two sections, namely, the first on education 
level, age group and sex, and the second one on the use of 
mobile devices for seniors. In the survey on the age of the 
subjects, we planned to include users from age 50 to survey 
trends for the next decade. Although there are changes in the 
knowledge given in relation to technological developments, 
it is clear that users of old age usually fail to follow this 
evolution. If in the past the difficulty was the interface of a 
VCR (Videocassette Recorder) tape, now is the interface of a 
smartphone, which can be anticipated here for 1 or 2 
decades? With this, it is observed that age exerts a strong 
influence on the use of information technology and 
communication in which there is a significant reduction from 
the 50 [9]. Nine (9) questions were prepared, and one (1) 
open ended question was and the other multiple choice. 
Established the goal, hypothesis, methodology and 
materials used for the verification of the object of study: 
 
Hypothesis: Considering the users' interaction with 
the elderly mobile devices, there are many 
difficulties or points that could be improved to meet 
the needs of this user group. 
 
Objective: Collect the main forms of use, difficulties 
and facilities in the view of users of elderly facing 
the operationalization of mobile devices. 
 
Methodology: The proposed map the use of users of 
old age and thus define the personas, the user group 
was invited to participate in the completion of a 
questionnaire survey of socio-cultural and the use of 
mobile devices. 
 
Handout: To conduct the exploratory experiment we 
prepared a Questionnaire Survey Profile containing 
issues of social and cultural so that you can trace 
profiles of those users. 
 
Target Audience: Elderly users of social network 
Facebook to participate in groups. 
B. Execution of the Survey 
The presence of elderly users in the software market is 
still modest; considering the participation in Brazil of elderly 
users (aged 60 or older) on Facebook, for example, it is 
lower than 1% [10]. However, in the past few years there has 
been a growth in participation, and considering the current 
users aged 50 or above, which will be part of this group over 
the next decade, there will be a participation of more than 
4%. Although this percentage does not seem expressive, it 
will represent over 2.8 million users [10] just in Brazil. 
Through the social networking site Facebook, an explanatory 
message was posted on the research and inviting the 
administrators of 41 groups of elderly in different cities of 
the country to publish the link of the research groups of 
closed social network. 
The phase of contact with the administrators of groups of 
seniors, it was a very positive surprise, where the vast 
majority talked about the importance of research with this 
group of users. Only administrators of two groups (one from 
a local authority and other social network) showed resistance 
in the questionnaire. To these, we performed a more detailed 
explanation of the real goals. 
The questionnaire was also applied to two elderly groups 
located in the city of Itu in Brazil with 8 people filling it 
manually. The link to the questionnaire has been accessed 
297 times and got a total of 263 responses. For mapping the 
number of clicks, we used the Google URL Shortener [23] 
and the electronic form was created through Google Drive 
[24]. 
C. Results and Discussion 
In the consolidation of the results, we considered both 
questionnaires in groups of elderly as the electronic 
questionnaire, totalizing 271 participants. 
Understanding the educational, social and cultural issues 
assists in the process of formalizing the characteristics of the 
user group to be studied [8]. With this, we have analyzed the 
responses of users from the perspective of their profiles. The 
results are shown below. 
The majority (98%) of respondents responded to the 
survey via the electronic form available on the Internet; 63% 
were female;  91%  have cell phone. 
For many users, one smartphone can become the only 
way to connect to the Internet [11], and, with it, the same 
way one can use a desktop PC, several software interface 
elements, completely different between each application, can 
be installed. Thus, it was raised from the research subjects, if 
besides their cell, how many % were smartphones. The 
survey shows that 149 subjects (56 %) have a smartphone, 
while in male subjects the number of people who have a 
smartphone reaches 72 %. The age range of respondents is 
14 % between 51-59 years, 74 % between 60-75 years, 12 % 
between 76-85 years, and 0.01% or only 3 users  older than 
85 years. 
Figure 1 shows that a majority of respondents (54 %) had 
higher education is ”full” or ”Post Grad”. However, 
according to the questionnaire, 8 % of people have only the 
”elementary school incomplete”, demonstrating that mobile 
devices are used by people with different levels of education; 
since, the motivation in creating interfaces considering the 
experience of non-specialist users of different ages and levels 
of knowledge [6]. 
 
The users were asked about the main difficulties in the 
use of mobile devices (more than one option could have been 
selected). The highlight was the difficulty of visualizing the 
interface elements, where 58% of users above 76 years

showed that ”the letter of the text is too small”, while 37% 
mentioned that ”I have trouble seeing the images of the cell”. 
The complete survey of the difficulties can be seen in Table

Subjects above 60 years showed ”having no difficulty” in 
the use of mobile devices; 72 %  are ”Higher” or are ”Post 
Graduates”, demonstrating a trend where the level of 
education can directly influence the difficulty of the 
operation of the interface. 
The survey in Table 1 corroborates the set of challenges 
proposed by Nilsson [12] in developing user interfaces for 
mobile devices, where a major challenge is the efficient use 
of screen space, through the using different layouts that are 
appropriate to the device, mechanisms for grouping the 
information, screen scrolling, management of dialogues with 
the user from keyboards to touch screens resizing and 
management interface for different devices and types of 
users. 
Considering a qualitative research, a essay question was 
included on other difficulties encountered in mobile devices, 
where tissues were some comments: ’The configuration 
program has hidden options’; ’I find it interesting that the 
cell facilitates the lives of elderly since the technology is a 
permanent thing in our day-to-day.’. ’Why interaction with 
new technology is so complex?’. 
In order to verify the actual use that elderly users make of 
with their mobile devices, they were asked to talk about 
besides, what other interactions were performed on the 
devices (more than one option could have been selected). 
The result of the survey can be seen in Figure 2. 
 
Aiming to raise new possibilities of development for 
mobile devices (smartphones and tablets with touch 
interaction), there were three questions, as shown in Table 2, 
in which the subject can respond if ”not would be 
interested”, ”would some interest” or ”Had a lot of interest” 
in each item.

It was observed that, according to Table 2, 77 % of the 
subjects had ’Interest’ or ’Very Interest’ to use the drive in 
the device reading the update messages mobile device, and 
76 % shown ’Interest’ or ’Very Interest’ for “can dictate text 
instead of writing the message”. Only the activity Enabling 
“mobile reading aloud updates cell” had a majority group 
’No Interest’ totaling 53 %. This item demonstrates that the 
development of a mobile application in order to reach all 
audiences, should also consider the needs and desires of a 
specific audience, such as the elderly people. In Brazil, about 
80% of Internet aged users have education level above the 
national average, and economic classes are more favorable 
[13]. Thus, it is critical that developers of mobile 
applications consider the specific needs of this group of 
users, since the declines coming from natural aging can 
affect the users’ interaction with the interfaces. 
Based on the motivation of this paper, a comparison of 
the results of this study was carried out conducted in Brazil, 
South America with information in United States, North 
America [21][22]. The result can be seen in Figure 3.

III. 
IDENTIFICATION AND DEFINITION OF PERSONAS 
The persona is defined as a fictional character, a 
hypothetical model of a group of real users, created to 
describe a typical user [14][15]. Personas have been used as 
an important mechanism for the precise definition of the 
characteristics of potential users of a system [16]. To identify 
and define the personas, one must first observe the profile of 
the user group being studied. 
In this work, we decided to use the approach proposed by 
Nielsen [14] for modeling and analysis of user profiles. The 
personas are defined primarily by their goals, determined in a 
successive refinement process during the investigation of the 
domain and the characters that are part of it. 
Cooper [15] directs that instead of organizing features to 
accommodate all people, should design the interface for a 
single persona. Although personas are fictional, there are 
strictly defined details to represent typical users. The method 
of identification and preparation of personas, adapted from 
[14], consisted of the following steps: 
 
Discovery of users: Through exploratory study, the 
questions were answered as ’Who are the users?’ 
and ’What do they expect from an interface?’ 
 
Construction Hypothesis: Through the tabulation and 
analysis of the exploratory study, we identified 
groups of related users. 
 
Searching for patterns: Through the categorization of 
the data, it was verified that all groups have 
proposed the hypothesis of equal importance. 
 
Construction of personas: From the Categorization 
of the study group personas were prepared.  
 
The extraction of information from the database of users 
was performed using datamining software open-source Weka 
[20]. This software is used to identification of data clusters 
using techniques classification, clustering and association 
rules. Through Weka, using the KNN classifier (K - Nearest 
Neighbors) it was possible to identify the user profile 
collected on the various characteristics, since this demand K 
classifier elements of the data set that are closest to this 
unknown element, or which have the smallest distance. For 
this database was used Euclidean distance. 
After collecting all the data, a new challenge arose which 
was to transform the entire mass of data into useful 
information and sufficiently well structured for the creation 
of personas. Thus, it is justified to use the Weka [20] which 
were identified by cross-checking logic of user segmentation 
that will define personas profiles. From the questionnaire, the 
preferences of interaction, economic profile, education, 
personal goals and practical goals were observed.  
With this analysis, we reached at three personas featuring 
the group studied. Figures 3, 4 and 5 illustrate the personas 
encountered. 
 
 
 
Personas found from the exploratory study are quite 
similar to three groups identified by Gatto [17]. In his work, 
the author has identified five different types of personality of 
the elderly: 
1) Constructive - well integrated, respected, stable, 
enjoying what life gives you; 
2) Dependent - is passive, disengaged voluntarily and 
satisfied, sir rocking chair, because, finally, can rest; 
3) Defensive - assets, rigid, disciplined, individualistic, 
dedicated to many activities because he could not stand still. 
4) Choleric - blame the world and people for their 
personal failures, has little ambition for the future, social and 
economic standards unstable precarious; fight against the 
manifestations of aging; 
5) Pessimistic - shows steady decrease in socioeconomic 
status and no history of life, hates himself, is depressed and 
isolated and often exaggerate their lack of physical and 
psychological training, becoming a victim. Accepted the sad

old age, but has death as its release this unsatisfactory 
existence. 
The first three types (Constructive, Defensive and 
Dependent), each in their different lifestyle and worldview, 
have adapted successfully to the aging process. On the other 
hand, the last two types (Choleric and Pessimist) did not fit 
the aging [17]. 
Table 3 shows who represent these personas.

From Table 3, three very different profiles personas 
should be considered in the development of interfaces for 
mobile devices. The persona has Manoel higher level, there 
is great difficulty in the operationalization of mobile devices, 
but due to his age, he has some discomfort in reading texts; 
since, he considers that the font size could be larger. The 
Lucia persona is the typical user of seniors who are having 
their first contact with the technology and uses the mobile 
device as well as a platform for fun. Already persona Marina 
is a user who should have special attention from the 
development team of new interfaces, because, as she has 
strong reluctance with the technology of mobile devices, any 
negative experience with the interface can get her to give up 
time to have this contact. 
Another step in the construction of personas according to 
Nielsen 
[14] 
is

The 
characteristic of this work, this activity was not performed, 
nor were inserted pictures of real people in the personas 
created as proposed by Nielsen [14] in order to protect 
copyright of the photographer and the photographed person. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
This article aimed at studying users of mobile devices for 
the elderly in Brazil. Thus, the results represent trends, 
experiences and behavior patterns associated only with the 
study group. The cultural, religious, political, technical, can 
not be determined by the number of subjects studied. 
However, research can be considered as an initial study to 
help understand the use of mobile devices by users seniors 
and opportunities for future research, development or 
adaptation in the software specific for this group, since the 
software must serve the needs users [18] [19]. 
From this study, it is clear that an application of global 
reach such as social networks or solutions of e-commerce 
cannot consider, for example, only users of a certain age, 
because the interests and needs of each band is totally 
different, as was found in accordance with the personas 
raised. 
The research showed that, beyond the limitations of 
motor, cognitive or perceptual common users of old age, 
there are other obstacles in the use of mobile devices in the 
user group of seniors. The difficulty in performing 
operations theoretically simple as reading a text or click a 
picture, suggest the need for targeted approaches to the 
public studied. 
Thus, it is concluded that the need to understand how the 
techniques and methodologies aimed at IHC group of seniors 
can help to understand the real needs of this group of users, 
the social aspects and experience with technology users can 
interfere with successful acceptance of new software or 
technology.
