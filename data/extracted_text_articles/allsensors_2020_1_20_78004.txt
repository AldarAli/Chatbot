Abstract—This work presents a novel approach for the
fabrication of Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs) based on the
screen-printing of a commercial carbon-based conductive ink
on flexible substrates. This technique enables the fast and cost-
effective
production
of
ECs
with
high
flexibility
and
outstanding performance over bending states and voltage
cycling, as demonstrated by means of cyclic voltammetry and
galvanometric charge-discharge measurements. Despite the
fact that the specific areal capacitances achieved are lower
than the ones obtained using other carbon-based materials
(~22 µF/cm2), the results show that, as soon as new screen-
printable
carbon-based
pastes
become
available,
this
fabrication method will enable the mass production of ECs
that can be attached to any surface as a conformal patch, as it
is being required by a large number of the emerging
technological applications.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, flexible electronics has attracted the
attention of many researches. This technology is expected to
cause a disruption in the field of electronics devices, since it
arises from the need to fulfill the demands required by novel
technological applications, such as wearables or biomedical
sensors, which cannot be addressed by means of the
traditional
silicon-based
electronics
[1].
Many
of
the
advances in this context come with the emergence of new
conductive and flexible materials. Examples of those are
Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) [2], graphene and its derivatives
[3]-[5], or silver nanowires (AgNWs) and nanoparticles
(AgNPs)
[6][7].
Additionally,
alternative
fabrication
processes enabling cost-effective processing on large flexible
substrates are targeted. Those processes include printing
technologies or laser treatment approaches, among others
[8][9].
Thus, the combination of these two emerging lines of
research has resulted in the development of many flexible
electronics
devices,
including
sensors
[10][11],
Radio
Frequency Identification Tags (RFID) [12][13] and antennas
[14][15]. Besides, apart from these latter, the flexible
electronics progress is also requiring of flexible energy
storage devices that, combined with energy harvesting
technologies, contribute to the development of self-powered
devices [16].
Numerous studies have been conducted to examine
different materials as electrodes for the fabrication of flexible
Electrochemical Capacitors (ECs). Among them, carbon-
based materials are the preferred to play this role for several
reasons: i) exceptionally high surface area, ii) relatively high
electrical
conductivity
and
iii)
acceptable
cost
[17].
Examples of materials studied so far are Laser-Induced
Graphene (LIG) [18][19], reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO)
[20] and single walled CNTs [21]. Many researchers agree
that carbon-based electrodes will play an important role in
the supercapacitor technology and that is why a big effort is
being devoted to further optimizing its properties through
doping
[22]
or
surface
treatments
[23].
Besides,
the
performance of the electrochemical capacitors does not only
rely on the material of the electrodes, but also on the
electrolyte used. Therefore, it is also important to achieve a
proper
interaction
electrode-electrolyte.
Then,
different
acid/base/salt-Poly(Vinyl Alcohol) (PVA) gel electrolytes
have been widely studied for this purpose, being the
PVA/phosphoric acid (PVA/H3PO4) and the PVA/sulfuric
acid
(PVA/H2SO4)
the
ones
which
report
the
best
performance [24][25].
In this contribution, we present a novel approach for the
fabrication of flexible ECs based on the screen-printing of a
commercial carbon-based electrically conductive ink using
PVA/H3PO4 as electrolyte. We have opted for a 2D
architecture,
which
consists
of
several
InterDigital
Electrodes (IDEs) arranged on a flexible substrate, since this
configuration offers some advantages over the conventional
designs, such as lower thicknesses and smaller distances
between electrodes [16]. This paper is organized as follows.
Section II describes the materials and methods used. Section
III presents the performance of the presented ECs and,
finally, Section IV addresses the main conclusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. Materials
Transparent polyester films for water-based inks with a
thickness of 160 µm (from ColorGATE Digital Output
Solutions GmbH, Hannover, Germany) were used as a
flexible substrate for the fabrication of the capacitors. The
screen-printing carbon-based paste used in this work, product

name: C-220, was provided by Applied Ink Solutions
(Westborough, MA, USA). Both Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA,
Mw 31,000-50,000, 98-99% hydrolyzed) and phosphoric
acid (H3PO4, product name: 1005731000) were acquired
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Electrical access
to the capacitive devices was achieved using a silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs) screen printable ink (LOCTITE®
ECI 1010 E&C from Henkel AG, Düsseldorf, Germany).
B. Devices Fabrication
Figure 1 shows the scheme for the fabrication of the
carbon-based flexible electrochemical capacitors. First, the
in-plane interdigital electrodes were printed on the flexible
substrate using a 90 Nylon threads per centimeter (T/cm)
mesh with a FLAT-DX200 screen printing machine (from
Siebdruck-Versand, Magdeburg, Germany), as shown in
Figure 1a and 1b. The capacitive structure considered has the
following dimensions (number of fingers N: 20, width W: 1
mm, spacing S: 1 mm, interspacing i: 1 mm and length L: 1
cm), which results in an effective area of 4 cm2, see Figure
1c.
Following
the
manufacturer
recommendations,
the
samples were dried at a temperature of 130 ºC for 3 min to
remove all residual solvent using a UF55 oven (from
Memmert, Schwabach, Germany). Following the same
screen-printing process, electrical contacts were printed
using silver ink (Figure 1d), and the sample was dried
afterwards again (this time at 120 ºC for a duration of 15
min). Furthermore, the gel electrolyte was prepared by
dissolving 1 g of PVA in 10 mL of de-ionized water (10
wt%) with stirring at 80 ºC for 2 h using a VWR 12365-382
hot plate stirrer (from VWR International, Radnor, PA,
USA). Once the PVA was completely dissolved, 1.2 g of
H3PO4 was added to the solution and it was stirred for
another hour [26]-[28]. The final homogeneous gel solution
was drop casted (~1.5 mL) on the capacitive IDE structure
covering all the effective surface area (Figure 1e). Finally,
once the device is left standing overnight to remove the
excess of water, the EC looks as shown in Figure 1f.

C. Characterization
Microscope pictures were obtained with a ZEISS
Axioscope 5 (from Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).
The sheet resistances were measured through the four-point
method at a constant Direct Current (DC) of 100 µA using a
probe head from Jandel connected to a B2901A Keysight
(Keysight Technologies, Inc., CA, USA) Source Measuring
Unit
(SMU).
Cyclic
Voltammetry
(CV)
and
charge-
discharge measurements at Constant Current (CC) were
performed using a 2602B Keithley SMU from Tektronix Inc.
(Beaverton, OR, USA). The impedance of the samples was
obtained
using
the
impedance
analyzer
4294A
(from
Keysight Technologies, Inc., CA, USA). The performance of
the devices as a function of the temperature was studied
using
the
climate
chamber
VCL4006
(from
Vötsch
Industrietechnik GmbH, Balingen, Germany). A custom
bending setup was built to perform the bending tests using a
PD4-N5918M420 stepper motor together with a GPLE60
precision planetary gear (from Nanotec Electronic GmbH &
Co. KG, Feldkirchen, Germany). All the measurement setup
was automated using the software LabView 2017 (from
National Instruments Corporation, TX, USA).
III.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Microscope images of the screen-printed electrodes are
shown in Figure 2. On one hand, Figure 2a shows the
printing resolution achieved. From the microscope images, it
can be obtained that the average electrode width is W =
1.168 mm, while its interspacing and separation are found to
be i = 0.892 mm and S = 0.902 mm, respectively, as a
consequence of the paste spreading once it is deposited on
the substrate. On the other hand, the porous nature of the
carbon-based electrodes can be observed in Figure 2b. The
sheet resistance of these conductive patterns is 503.6 ± 74.4
Ω/sq.

First, the electrochemical performance of the ECs was
investigated
through
Cyclic
Voltammetry
(CV).
The
experiments were conducted considering a potential window
of ΔV = 1 V, from -0.5 V to +0.5 V, at different scanning 
rates (20 mV/s, 50 mV/s, 90 mV/s, 120 mV/s), as shown in
Figure 1a. It can be noted that the CV curves maintain the
quasi rectangular shape over the increasing scan rates,
indicating a good reversible Electrostatic Double-Layer
Capacitive (EDLC) behavior [29]. From these curves, the
capacitance can be calculated as follows:

where ΔV is the potential window, s the scan rate and I(V)
the current response as a function of the voltage [20]. The
results, depicted in Figure 3b, show an average capacitance
of ~12.5 µF (~3.1 µF/cm2). As seen, the capacitance does not
suffer from a considerable decrease as the scan rate
increases, which indicates a good interaction electrode-
electrolyte [30].

Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements are also
commonly used for the characterization of ECs. The
resulting curves associated with these measurements are
displayed in Figure 3c. In this case, the quasi triangular
symmetric shape demonstrates a good charge propagation
across
the
carbon
electrodes
and
negligible
internal
resistances [31]. In the same way, these results can also be
used to calculate the specific capacitance by the following
equation:
ܥ௖௖=
ூ
ௗ௏/ௗ௧


where I is the discharge current and dV/dt the slope of
galvanostatic discharge curve [22]. In this case, the specific
capacitance obtained is around 86 µF (~22 µF/cm2) with a
slight decrease as the discharge current increases (ΔC/C0 =
4.7%), see Figure 3d. This specific areal capacitance is
similar to that obtained with other non-treated carbon
materials [32][33].
The outstanding performance of the ECs under different
bending conditions (r = 1.25 cm, 0.75 cm and 0.5 cm) is
demonstrated in Figure 4. It can be noted how the EC
presents almost unchanged CC and CV curves for the
different bending states, which would allow to use these ECs
in
conformal
applications
with
no
effect
on
their
electrochemical performance.
The electrochemical cycling durability of the ECs has
also been studied. The results, displayed in Figure 5, have
shown that the capacitors are able to retain their capacitance
even after 1000 bending cycles (ΔC/C0 < 1%). However, it
can also be noticed how the rectangular shape of the CV
curves
is progressively deformed. This latter
can
be
attributed to the appearance of reversible pseudocapacitive
effects, indicating that an increasing number of continuous
cycles boosts the electrosorption, redox and intercalation
processes
on
the
surface
of
the
porous
electrodes
[20][34][35].

frequencies, the imaginary part of the impedances against

the real one is almost linear (up to ~65 Hz), then a
semicircle appears in the high frequency region indicating
the
transition
between
resistance
and
capacitance
behaviours. It should also be noticed that, at this point, the
curve faces the real axis at a ~45º angle, which is a common
characteristic when a porous electrode is saturated with
electrolyte [30][36][37]. Moreover, the interception with the
real axis is associated with the Equivalent Series Resistance
(ESR), which is estimated to be ~250 Ω. Lastly, Figure 6b 
and Figure 6c show the behaviour of the analyzed ECs if we
simplify its model to a capacitance in parallel with a
resistance.

curves at the four different states. Inset shows a bent EC, while the diagram

Finally, the temperature effect on the performance of the
ECs is represented in Figure 7. As demonstrated by both CC
and CV experiments, the specific capacitance increases as
the temperature incresases, as it has been demonstrated for
several
electrode/electrolyte
systems,
such
as
rGO-
PVA/H3PO4 [37], CNT-PC/TEABF4 [38] and others [39].
This effect has been attributted to changes in the electrolyte,
since an increase of the temperature possibly leads to the
physisorbtion of the electrolyte ions [37][38].

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we report the fabrication of thin-film
flexible electrochemical capacitors trough the screen-printing
of a carbon-based conductive ink on a flexible substrate.
Using PVA/H3PO4 as electrolyte, the devices present good
performance
as
ECDL
capacitors,
which
has
been
demonstrated trough cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge
experiments and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
Although
the
specific
capacitances
obtained
for
this
electrode material does not achieve those obtained with other
carbon-based materials, further studies aim to treat the
conductive ink in order to optimize its properties and
increase
the
specific
areal
capacitance.
It
has
been
demonstrated that this method paves the way towards an
alternative method for the large-scale and cost-effective
fabrication of flexible electrochemical capacitors.
