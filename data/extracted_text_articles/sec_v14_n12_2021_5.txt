Abstract— This paper describes the concept, implementation 
and first results of a multidimensional research approach to im-
prove the trustworthiness of digital services. It presents the cur-
rent perception of the concepts of trust and trustworthiness in 
technical and sociological systems, and their connection as an 
identified gap. Well-known environmental analysis is used to de-
fine the dimensions. The empirical investigations are designed 
separately for each dimension, or domains of study. The goal is 
to subsequently create a holistic and robust concept for trust-
worthy socio-technical systems.

INTRODUCTION 
This paper expands the view on the concept, realization 
and first results of the idea, which was originally and briefly 
presented at the The Fourteenth International Conference on 
Digital Society 2020, for the empirical analysis of digital ser-
vices in the context of digitization [1]. The variety of services 
offered in the digital world is constantly evolving and rapidly 
increasing due to the establishment of digital aspects in eve-
ryday private and professional life. The use of digital services 
is highly dependent on trustworthiness [2] [3] [4].  
However, the concepts of trust and trustworthiness are un-
derstood differently in different academic and industrial disci-
plines, as are the attributes associated with them.  
This idea paper aims to present a possible approach to an-
alyze significant factors of trustworthiness through various 
empirical studies from different fields. The trustworthiness at-
tributes can vary widely from discipline to discipline. In gen-
eral, it is assumed that these attributes differ mainly only in 
their weighting, related to the observed discipline for that they 
are relevant. 
This document is divided into six sections. Section I con-
tains the brief introduction. In Section II, different terms and 
viewpoints on the topic of trust and trustworthiness are de-
scribed to explain the motivation for this approach. In Section 
III, past and current related work is then examined, to demon-
strate the variations of the current understanding and related 
contexts that have been evaluated. Section IV describes what 
could be done to achieve a generic and general model of trust-
worthiness attributes and associated weights according to the 
area under study. The conceptional procedure to accomplish 
this idea is described in detail, as well as what fields are going 
to be involved as part of the planned project to enable this 
work. The fields and their individual empirical approach, thus, 
are presented briefly to demonstrate the general idea of the 
approach. Section V presents the early results. The outcomes 
of the analysis of WebAPIs and the survey for public wifis are 
visualized and explained in the context of trustworthiness. The 
Section VI contains a summary of the current status of the pro-
ject and briefly lists the open work packages. 
II. 
TERMS & VIEWPOINTS  
An agreed-upon definition of trust in the context of digital 
services is:  
“Trust by definition entails a willingness by the [trustor] to 
make herself vulnerable to the possibility that another will 
act to her detriment” [5, p. 28], which is also based on the 
sociological perspective on trust as an fulfilment of expecta-
tions towards a person or a system by taking risks [6] [7] [8] 
[9]. 
An acceptable definition of trustworthiness in the context 
of digital services therefore is formed over time and relative 
to the perception of certain, system specific attributes. Gener-
ally, trustworthiness of systems can be defined as being based 
on ability, benevolence and integrity of the system [10] which 
correlates with the development of predictability over depend-
ability to faith over time, regarding expectations towards the 
persistence, technical competence and fiduciary responsibility 
of a system as shown in Lee and Moray [7], p. 1245. Related 
approaches tend to a similar characteristic [11] [12] [13]. 
Digitization depends on the well-being of users. Entrust-
ing data and work steps to a computer system will be criticized 
by users. In addition to advantages, there are also disad-
vantages. Trust is the key to accepting digital services, and 
therefore the key to increasing productivity through digitali-
zation. This creative paper shows the dimensions of trust. 
These needs are resolved by the supplier. There are several 
participants with different interests and understandings of 
trust and trustworthiness.  
In the context of the credibility of digital services, the 
needs of stakeholders are consumers, providers and third-
party trustees. Consumers are trying to use services that are as 
trustworthy as possible, because the impact of data abuse is 
becoming more and more obvious. Digital service providers 
need consumer confidence in their products. They also need 
reliable supply services. The third independent authority can 
confirm the credibility of the digital service to the user, as long 
as it has the confidence of the user and can verify the service. 
From a service point of view, there are two main factors that 
play a decisive role in its reputation among consumers. User 
trust and service credibility are these two factors.  
In a research project called OPerational Trustworthiness 
Enabling Technologies, in short OPTET, the prerequisites for

trust in the context of Web-based services were determined. 
The result is that trust can be personal, transferable, and based 
on core trust, such as in an organization. The credibility of the 
service is based on its attributes and the attributes confirmed 
by third parties. Figure 1 summarizes these correlations and 
their impact [14] [15] [16]. 
This research focuses on the social, economic, and tech-
nological factors that influence trust in digital services, as an 
implementation of the proposal we presented at the ICDS con-
ference [1]. Based on the analysis of trust and trustworthiness, 
the following influencing factors can be determined. Social 
factors can be distinguished by personal, recommendation, 
and derived trust. Personal trust is characterized by emotions, 
such as browser authentication status color (red-dangerous, 
green-good) or knowledge, such as knowledge about two-fac-
tor authentication procedures. Recommended trust is based on 
trusted third parties. Derivative trust is usually formed by the 
experience of the organization and its status.  
The technical factor is the credibility attribute of the ser-
vice. These should be objectively measured or confirmed by a 
third party during the development and operation process. 
Economic factors are characterized by profit expectations. 
The provider aims to provide reliable digital services. He 
can achieve this by optimizing all factors, but each factor must 
have a minimum level. For example, a certain service may be 
technically perfect, that is, completely credible, but the pro-
vider’s reputation is poor, so the derived trust is low, and the 
service is not entirely credible. One factor that affects consum-
ers is no risk or low risk. If the risk is lower, the service will 
be more trusted because the potential loss is controllable. 
However, many users do not realize the value of user data. 
Therefore, risk assessment is useful for all stakeholders. 
Trust in digital services has been shaped by different im-
pacts. The identified influences are personal trust, referral 
trust and trust in the institution. These findings are based on 
McKnight's model of trust [17] and Robbins' trust-risk-act 
model [18] and is visualized in Figure 1. The trust models are 
briefly explained in the Section III. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Trust and trustworthiness for digital services [own 
representation based on [15] [16] [14] [19]. 
In our view, a holistic view of trustworthiness in the con-
text of digital services that addresses more than quality and 
security is missing. The possibilities for the technical 
consideration of services are limited, since only the interfaces 
are known, not their execution code. 
The structure of the well-known Social, Technological, 
Economic, Environmental, Political, Legal, and Ethical Envi-
ronment analyses, or STEEPLE, was used to classify the trust-
building measures as a view from the outside [20, pp. 80-84]. 
From the authors' perspective, the environment analysis for a 
digital service is essential for its trustworthiness and consumer 
confidence. 
In our discussion of trust patterns, we presented the con-
ceptual considerations that trust in WebAPI-based architec-
tures consists of more than just security aspects. We showed 
that trust develops from personal trust, e.g., in the provider or 
the technology and trustworthiness of the system. We have 
classified the trustworthiness attributes ac-cording to product, 
process and resource in order to determine the appropriate in-
dicators for trust patterns. The categorization is based on the 
influence on the trust and trustworthiness, which is based on 
trust aspects [21]. For the OpenAPIs Trustability Parser we 
also use this classification. The challenge in terms of deter-
mining individual values of the attributes, since many indica-
tors are transparent.

RELATED WORK  
Research on trust has been around for a long time; the ba-
sics have been interesting since the 1950s. Recent research has 
commercial reasons [22]. For trust in software and its use, this 
section briefly introduces the most important concepts. 
The social driver of trust is the honesty, integrity and reli-
ability of the interactive partner. Solving these relationships is 
the essence of trust. This is also the foundation of social sys-
tem and market stability. There is no doubt that trust is the 
basis of everyday interaction. 
In early considerations, trust was measured against ex-
pected results [23]. If it is good, trust will be established. If the 
situation is not good, trust will be destroyed. Later, the emo-
tional aspects and the behavior of the participants were iden-
tified as important influencing factors [24]. The change in per-
ceptual ability seems to occur mainly in citizens with high 
trust and little knowledge, and the change in perceived benev-
olence mainly occurs in citizens with low knowledge and low 
trust [25].

In a business setting, the cognitive and emotional dimen-
sions of trust were found to be powerful, independent, and in-
terrelated when it comes to building trust relationships with 
businesses [22]. In a study of the relationship with public in-
stitutions, it was found that they are considered more trustwor-
thy than private companies [26]. In a 2001 consideration, all 
aspects and the implications for trust are integrated into a sin-
gle design. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Basically, he distin-
guishes trust in institutions through psychology and sociology 
that affect personal trust. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Interdisciplinary model of trust constructs [recreated from 17, p.

An interdisciplinary model of trust was proposed as a 
modern trust-risk-behavior model, called relational trust [18, 
p. 985]. It is illustrated in Figure 3 and visualizes the links be-
tween trust, risk assessment, and relationships with activities. 
The factors that affect trust are the characteristics of the actors 
and the relationship between the actors and external parties.

In the OPTET research project, attributes for trustworthy 
software were compiled from literature on existing frame-
works and surveys in software companies [19, pp. 546-547]. 
Many attributes were found that represent the nature of a web-
based application in terms of its trustworthiness. Since these 
proper-ties must be evaluated at each point in the life cycle of 
the application, the main phases with the respective artefacts. 
A distinction is made between development, marketplace and 
runtime. In the development phase, the source code is availa-
ble for analysis. In marketplace phase the software is compiled 
but not in use. The runtime phase means that the software is 
operational. Our analysis refers to available WebAPIs, there-
fore in the runtime context. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Trustworthiness attributes [27, p. 236]. 
These attributes have a context-specific impact on credi-
bility. The fields and types of socio-technical systems, re-
ferred to as STS, are related. These attributes are measurable 
and can be influenced by weight mapping.  
The top three attributes identified in a study of 72 relevant 
papers are security, dependability and usability. In almost 2/3 
of the literature, security is mentioned as the most important 
attribute. Almost half of them mentioned reliability. One-
quarter of the paper mentions usability as an important attrib-
ute of credibility. Figure 5 shows all the attributes and their 
dependencies [21, p. 25].

Figure 6.  Classified trustworthiness attributes [28, p. 24]. 
Trustworthiness is an objective property of the WebAPI 
based primarily on security and quality attributes, but also in-
cludes specific attributes such as Complexity, Cost, Privacy, 
and Compliance [16, p. 14]. 
Trust is a subjective assessment and differs from the per-
spective of the respective stakeholder. This assessment is 
based on knowledge, emotions and expectations of the ob-
server [29, p. 4]. Knowledge in relation to trust states that one 
understands the rights and duties of a provider and can also 
understand the measures taken to secure the requirements. 
Emotion in relation to trust states that one trusts the provider 
from an inner feeling without knowing the exact measures. 
The personal risk assessment of a possible misconduct is sub-
jective. Most often, guarantees of the provider are included. 
The expectations in relation to trust are characterized by the 
hope that the system will perform the task with trust, because, 
for example, the function execution is important for the user 
and he has effort when changing providers [16, p. 11]. 
APIs, application programming interfaces, are important 
elements of software development for transparently coupling 
functionalities, resources and components. Hereby many re-
quirements are fulfilled to the software development. On the 
one hand can be ensured opposite monolithic systems, an ex-
changeability and the re-use of particular parts. On the other 
hand, functions can be outsourced.  If this takes place over the 
public Internet and the functionality as services are offered, 
we mean WebAPIs. The WebAPIs Economy has several ac-
tors. There is the provider, which offers at least one service 
through a public interface. There is a consumer that integrates 
these services into its software. This is not limited to one ser-
vice or one provider. The added value is generated just by 
combining different services. In between, there can be API 
brokers that consolidate providers and consumers so that one 
of the two needs only one point of contact. Furthermore, there 
is the end user, who uses the consumer's finished application 
or service [30, p. 19]. 
The OpenAPI Trustability Parser can support all stake-
holders in terms of evaluating the trustworthiness of WebA-
PIs. For this purpose, it takes the view of the consumer. 
WebAPIs are implemented for and by software developers 
and can be used as glue to hold together an increasingly digital 
world. They shall be specified in a suitable manner so that 
both the tasks of development-side composition and opera-
tionally used communication are supported [30, p. 12]. 
In our view, a good specification can also provide many 
indications and statements about individual aspects of trust-
worthiness. Therefore, the specifications are examined ac-
cording to the OpenAPI specification [31]. The OpenAPI 
specification defines a standard for describing Restful APIs. It 
is promoted by the OpenAPI Initiative, which is supported by 
the Linux Foundation. Members include Google, IBM, Mi-
crosoft and SAP. Operationally, it is implemented by swag-
ger.io, for example [32]. A public directory of WebAPIs ac-
cording to OAS is provided by APITree.com, for instance 
[33]. 
Despite user rates for Wi-Fi access outside people’s homes 
increasing across a range of countries including Germany [34] 
[35], the limited data published since 2015 indicates user rates 
only just exceeding 50%, with levels in 2015 at 39% [36] and 
55% in 2018 [37] or lower [38]. Usage varies according to 
provider, with cafes and restaurants (77%) and hotels (88%) 
at the vanguard [36]. In 2018, user rates shifted slightly in fa-
vor of transport infrastructure, with public transport at 60% 
and mainline railways at 59% [37]. 
To actually make use of the proposed approach derived 
from the results of this work for the conception of digital ser-
vices, the field of Requirements Engineering becomes im-
portant. As shown in [39], the field of Service Engineering fits 
as the wider context, whereas aspects such as Software Engi-
neering or even product Engineering are not to be excluded 
[40, p. 102]. The general aim is to develop services, that de-
liver a value to a asking unit as a result or product, by gener-
ating a use of potentials and processes of a offering unit whilst 
market factors are respected [40, p. 58]. 
The evaluation of the current common systemic view on 
the matter of the conception of digital services in [39] shows 
a conceptual lack of possible elicitation, evaluation or man-
agement mechanics in current Requirements Engineering ap-
proaches within Service Engineering regarding trust building 
requirements. The underlying definitions of Requirements En-
gineering for this matter is the knowledge, documentation, 
specification and management of relevant requirements 
through process orientation, stakeholder focus and the evalu-
ation of risk and value considerations [41]. This is something 
that has not yet been applied to the fundamental problem de-
scribed earlier in [1].  
IV. 
CONCEPT 
An environmental perspective becomes important, as dif-
ferent context fields with different environmental factors and 
thus attuites and requirements a present in this generic ap-
proach. The PEST model by [42] originally took four environ-
mental perspectives into account for the analysis: Political, 
economic, social and technological influences. Younger per-
spectives extended this approach by ecological, legal and eth-
ical dimensions [20]. 
In an economical sense this analysis enables market in-
sights as foundation for strategic decisions regarding market-
ing aspects [43, p. 238]. Regarding the aim of the work de-
scribed in this paper, it shall serve as an orientation and foun-
dation to cluster requirements coming from or being related to 
the dimensions.

The concept provides for a multidimensional model of 
trustworthiness based on the shown STEEPLE environment 
analysis. The architecture is intended to be designed so that it 
can be extended by further research in various fields across 
the sociotechnical spectrum by looking at the STEEPLE di-
mensions. The initial fields and respective systems considered 
are as follows: 
▪ 
S1 - Trustworthy WebAPIs. 
The consideration focuses on the collection and analysis 
of various trustworthiness-enhancing attributes of 
WebAPIs. The goal is to investigate the weighting of the 
different attributes in order to be able to define baseline 
requirements for digital services.  
▪ 
S2 - Trustworthy public WiFi. 
The empirical investigation in this area focuses on trust-
worthiness attributes in public WiFis through question-
naires and comparative interviews between user groups 
of different services with different trustworthiness lev-
els. 
▪ 
S3 - Trusted AI Web Services. 
This research area is concerned with identifying and 
evaluating the trustworthiness of web services that use 
artificial intelligence in addition to S1, due to more com-
plicated aspects of trustworthiness when it comes to AI 
approaches. 
▪ 
S4 - Trusted web services of intermediaries. 
Similar to the previous area, a variety of web presences 
of self-established mediators will be studied to gain a 
collection of empirically validated trustworthiness attrib-
utes in this area to enrich the proposed overall model 
with weights unique to this area. 
Subarea S1 deviates from the original idea of simulating 
the development process [1], since a simulation was assessed 
as unsuitable upon closer examination. On the one hand, the 
empery is very limited and on the other hand a theoretical 
model is already necessary for a simulation. However, this is 
the goal of the study. Simulation can be used later to evaluate 
the findings. 
Figure 7 shows a schematic representation of the proposed 
research objective. Each empirically determined trustworthi-
ness attribute (Ai) is to be weighted per system under study 
(Sj). In addition, these attributes will be categorized according 
to the STEEPLE dimensions, allowing the formation of clus-
ters. This is helpful to understand system specifications and 
build a general model. Any further investigation of similar or 
other systems will add to the overall set, but will also add in-
formation about different weights that are unique per area 
studied. This enables a generic overview over relevant attrib-
utes but also a specific derivation for similar systems under 
consideration in for example Requirements Engineering 
Frameworks, as this poses a fundamental view of relevant 
trustworthiness requirements in this field. 
In the following two subsections, we present the sub concepts 
for S1 and S2. The S3 and S4 sub concepts are currently in the 
design phase. 
 
Figure 7.  Visualization of the proposed approach. 
A. Concept S1 
For the first subarea S1 of the project, the empirical inves-
tigation of WebAPIs in the context of trustworthiness, the fol-
lowing was designed: The idea is to be able to evaluate the 
WebAPIs in a structured way according to trust and trustwor-
thiness by parsing OpenAPI specifications. For this purpose, 
it is necessary to identify indicators for determining the indi-
vidual attributes and to query them during parsing. Basically, 
there are two types of indicators that are used for evaluation 
in relation to trustworthiness attributes. On the one hand, there 
is the quantitative and on the other hand the qualitative. 
The quantitative indicators are countable methods, param-
eters and data types of the specification. For example, it is rel-
evant how many primary data types and un-structured data 
types are used. From this, for example, a statement can be 
made about Data Integrity and its Data Validity. Primary data 
types are easier to check for integrity in contrast to complex 
data structures. The attack surface can be deter-mined from 
the number and type of methods provided. For example, read 
operations via GET method have much less malicious poten-
tial than POST methods. The indicators are used for calcula-
tion with the help of metrics in the analysis step. An evaluation 
can then be made from their results in comparison with de-
fined reference values. 
The evaluation of qualitative indicators is significantly 
more complex, since on the one hand requirements are 
checked against current requirements and on the other hand 
several indicators have to be combined. For example, the re-
quirements for authentication and authorization are a good in-
dicator for security, e.g., Confidentiality and Non-Repudia-
tion. The evaluation of the indicator consists of several parts, 
like the technology, key length and cipher modes. Also, eval-
uating attributes from the categories of performance, usability 
and complexity is only possible with qualitative evaluation of 
the requirements to parameters by the specification. 
Knowledge of the individual data type is helpful, but not suf-
ficient. Best practices and standards are to serve as reference 
values for this purpose. Simple metrics are not sufficient at

this point, so that further procedures must be used, such as 
Cosmic function points, as described by us at the IWSM con-
ference [44], or AI analyses. 
For these objectives, we have created the following work 
plan. First of all, it is necessary to find a suitable parser that 
can capture all indicators and is also integrable. It should also 
be open and independent of the analysis and evaluation mod-
ule. In the second step, the parser and a metric analysis should 
be created with the help of a proto-type. In the third step, the 
analysis capabilities of the support tool will be exam-ined in a 
proof of concept with the help of a concrete scenario. In the 
fourth step, the evaluation of the trustworthiness in the analy-
sis part will be extended. 
In the first step, the optimal parser framework was deter-
mined. For this purpose, the criteria were defined and evalu-
ated in a decision matrix for each candidate. This is presented 
in Table 1. The candidates are three Java libraries and two Ja-
vaScript modules, where one is deployed as a command line 
application. The criteria are the supported OpenAPI Standard 
versions, technical requirements, quantitative and qualitative 
analysis capabilities. By technical requirements we mean the 
possibilities to integrate the framework into our tool-chain. 
Quantitative analysis involves the evaluation of amounts of 
data types and methods in the specification un-der study. 
Qualitative analysis includes the capabilities to detect specific 
methods, such as authentication and authorization, and evalu-
ate them. It also includes the detection of redundant and un-
necessary methods and data types. With the help of the respec-
tive documentation and test implementations, we have deter-
mined that all java candidates fulfill the functional require-
ments. There are differences in handling and documentation. 
For this reason, the Swagger parser was selected for the proof 
of concept. An own developed parser was also considered, but 
due to the non-specific requirements for trustworthiness in the 
parsing activity, this was discarded. 
 
Figure 8.  Scheme of software architecture for empirical data collection 
and processing. 
The parser is an important part in the full toolchain for the 
evaluation of WebAPIs in context of trustworthiness. Addi-
tional components are also required for analysis, visualization 
and management. We chose microservices as our architecture 
model because it allows us to flexibly integrate different col-
lection and analysis methods. The WebAPIs to be analyzed 
are captured and tracked via a management component. The 
architecture concept is shown in Figure 8. The analysis com-
ponents can also be extended later in this way, so that cosmic 
function points analysis (COSMIC FP) and machine learning 
(AI Analysis) can be involved in addition to trustworthiness 
metrics (Tw Metrics). This architecture also makes it possible 
to integrate and combine other data collection methods, web 
scraping and testing.

B. Concept S2 
The following was designed for the S2 strand of the pro-
ject, the empirical investigation of the relevance and percep-
tion of trustworthiness in the context of public WiFi as an ex-
ample of an exposed digital public service. 
The idea of the study was to investigate beneficial and re-
stricting factors of public WiFi usage. Existing studies showed 
a low average usage rate of public WiFis of around 50% of 
potential users [36] [50] [37]. The evaluation then was sup-
posed to concentrate on the reasons for and against the usage 
by forming an online questionnaire, which was conducted in 
Germany. A key element was the representativeness in a de-
mographical way, so results would be accountable for the 
whole sociological picture. Content wise the survey was di-
vided into different divisions, each focusing on different as-
pects of public WiFis. After general and statistically relevant 
questions like age, gender, education etc. data regarding the 
primarily used mobile device and tendency towards mobile 
network or public WiFi usage was collected. Following ques-
tions concentrated on the aspect of usage factors and personal 
perception of the relevance and perception of these factors. 
Part of the questions were explicit, closed answer multiple 
choice types. Others, to verify or falsify closed questions, 
were top of mind questions with a free text response option. 
Collectively they form a representative image on this matter 
through validation. The last part concentrated on risks and 
trust concerning public WiFis and the perception of same. Re-
garding the trustworthiness of such systems, it was also exam-
ined, which factors benefit trustworthiness and how they are 
perceived regarding their importance.  
V. 
RESULTS 
In this section, we present the preliminary results of the 
project areas S1 and S2, whose concepts are explained in Sec-
tion IV. 
A. Results S1 
In 2018, an investigation of WebAPI specifications was 
conducted. In this study, the specifications regarding the se-
curity requirements were examined. Over 900 WebAPI 
specifications were examined for security requirements. Only 
601 could be automatically parsed and evaluated. The selec-
tion of specifications is based on market share in order to be 
representative. So about 50% are from Microsoft Azure, Am-
azon AWS and Google Cloud. The survey provides insight into 
the status of concrete indicators for confidentiality: transport 
encryption, authentication and authorization. At this point, a 
repetition of the survey is useful to survey the current state.  
As shown in Figure 9, transport encryption is defined at 
over 90% and over 50% of the specification requires authen-
tication. Over 64% of these expect an OAuth 2.0 token for au-
thentication and authorization [51]. In 2021, the WebAPIs 
specifications were checked for these same criteria using the 
new analysis system. Updated specifications were used if they 
were available. There were 671 specifications valid and could 
be parsed. The goal is to determine the changes in terms of 
security and to evaluate the functionality of the prototype. The 
charts in Figure 9 show the results of the 2018 survey com-
pared to those from 2021. Transport encryption will be sup-
ported by almost all WebAPIs in 2021. In the current analysis, 
95% of all examined specify HTTPS and only 7% specify the 
unencrypted HTTP protocol. While in 2018, 17% still speci-
fied HTTP. It also requires little effort due to the wide availa-
bility of free certificates from LetsEncrypt. The benefit in 
terms of confidentiality outweighs this. 
Compared to 2018, the share of WebAPIs that require au-
thentication through their specification has grown from 75% 
to 82%. WebAPIs without authentication are therefore be-
coming increasingly rare. In terms of misuse and stability of 
the APIs, this development is certainly to be welcomed. From 
a data privacy point of view, this can be assessed differently 
OAuth 2 is the most frequently offered method for authenti-
cation and authorization. Compared to 2018, the share de-
creased slightly from 64% to 61%. Basic Auth is now only 
specified for 4% of WebAPIs. Compared with 2018, however, 
the proportion has fallen slightly from 5% to 4%. The basic 
authentication of http was also less specified. The percentage 
of APIs using an API Key has increased from 32% to 39%. 
The API key is a secret string and often serves as both a unique 
identifier and a secret token for authentication and authoriza-
tion.

B. Results S2 
The results have previously been published in [52] and 
[53] with a deeper statistical analysis of the results. Regarding 
the specific aim of this paper, the relevant results concern the 
relevance and perception of trustworthiness attributes and 
therefore form system requirements for this area. First, it is 
shown, that the trustworthiness of those systems – like esti-
mated – is rather low at 52.10%. With the security of those 
systems subjectively evaluated at 40.30% a significant corre-
lation of .75 shows the strong interconnection of security and 
trustworthiness attributes of a digital service as such, as shown 
in Figure 10.  
 
 
 
Figure 10.  Evaluations of correlations betweens usage, perceived 
trustworthiness and security of a system from [53]. 
This implied the question about the correlation of trust-
worthiness and usage, whereas the mean of selected service 
providers formed a correlation of .44 and therefore can be con-
sidered as relevant.  The underlying implication, that the ser-
vice provider is a significant factor in this system can be con-
firmed by the results regarding trust building attributes of a 
public WiFi, where the service provider was named as the 
most relevant attribute with 24.35% of all answers, followed 
by the previously discussed aspects of security at 20.87%, as 
seen in Figure 11. 
Regarding the personal preference of relevant trustworthi-
ness attributes, encryption aspects (66.20%) and a renowned 
service provider (51.50%) confirm this image as they mark the 
top two aspects.  
As the latter suggests, not only functional requirements 
were found applicable, as a third-party certification as well as 
communicative aspects such as the detailed clarification of 
data usage by the provider where in the lead compared to clas-
sical conceptions among public WiFi services such as the ac-
ceptance of terms of use etc. Therefore, the presentation of 
these explicit but nonfunctional requirements has to be taken 
into consideration, which poses another motivation for the 
general aim of the presented work.

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The initial results of subareas S1 and S2 clearly show that 
security and quality are important characteristics for trustwor-
thy services. The comprehensible, transparent communication 
of measures contributes significantly to the acceptance of the 
services due to a higher trustworthiness. This correlation 
could also be shown statistically. 
In the further progression of the project, we would like to 
deepen the sub-areas S1 and S2, as well as work on S3 and S4. 
The S3 subdomain addresses the trustworthiness of AI web 
services. For this purpose, the trustworthy properties are to be 
determined with the help of prototypical tests. Part S4 exam-
ines the trustworthiness of the mediator profession. With the 
help of automated web scrapers, findings on this are to be 
found and linked. A preliminary study conducted in 2019 
serves as the starting point for the investigation [54]. The goal 
is to determine the sociological role in the context of trustwor-
thy web services. 
This will allow us to combine the results from the subareas 
and obtain a multidimensional picture of the trustworthiness 
of digital services, as described in section IV. The goal is to 
support the viewpoints with empirical data in order to be able 
to set up the requirements for trustworthy services in concrete 
measures. 
Continuing this thought process, a framework benefiting 
from using such a model could be helpful. An assessment on 
how necessary a generic requirements engineering framework 
for trustworthy digital services would be can be found in [39], 
as well as an proposed approach. Basically, a related frame-
work would provide processes, methods and tools as well as 
provided forms of documentations for requirements engineer-
ing. The generic aspect towards including trustworthiness as-
pects includes a holistic variety of requirements sources for 
the requirements elicitation, as well as a model to map trust-
worthiness requirements across functional and non-functional 
groups, resources, processes and the product in form of a re-
sult at the customers end of a digital service. As part of the 
EUMovE Project and upcoming activities this approach will 
be further developed and discussed in the future.
