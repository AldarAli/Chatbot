Abstract— The Soundex method is the preferred method for
duplicate detection process on Malaysian Chinese names. The
names are written in English text, but are phonetically
translated from various Chinese dialects. When using the
Russell Soundex method, it is found that the number of
duplicates is high and the number of false positives is also high.
The adaptive nature of Soundex method provides an avenue to
optimize it for foreign language names, such as Chinese names.
Through a series of tests, this study has optimized the Soundex
codes for general Malaysian Chinese names. The test results
have shown that a few short Chinese surnames contribute to
false positives.
Keywords: duplicate detection; Chinese names; Soundex;
false positive.

INTRODUCTION
Normally, during data cleansing projects, duplicate
detection of foreign language names is done by using the
Soundex method [1]. When using the original Soundex
method for Malaysian Chinese names, it is found that it
produces a large number of duplicates and false positives. Be
it in the government or private office use, Chinese names are
written in English text, but they actually come from various
phonetics of respective dialects. It is possible that the same
Chinese character names are being translated into different
spelling names (Romanized) due to different phonetics
systems of Chinese dialects. Chinese names are normally
written either as three words or two words. Sometimes,
English names are also prefixed to the names. The different
name formats would affect the matching results with
Soundex codes. Emma Woo [4] described ten most popular
Chinese format names in America. Some of the Chinese
American formats also apply in Malaysia. This study
excludes other ethnicities including Malay, Indian, and
Kadazan, because their names are suitable for string
matching algorithm application.
There
is
a
large
number
of
duplicate
detections
approaches such as Levenshtein [13], edit distance [3] and
Soundex. In the Levenshtein method, edit distance and name
comparison methods match results based on substitution,
deletion, insertion or transposition of characters. In this
study, we selected the Soundex method because it can
process phonetic data effectively with its matching Soundex
codes. The Russell Soundex method was invented by Robert
Russell and O’Dell in 1918 [2]. A large number of studies
have been conducted to optimize Soundex rules [5] [6] [7]
[8]. A cross-language algorithm was developed to measure
the similarity of Asian words phonetically [9]. The algorithm
showed positive results for Asian names but it had limited
success when using Chinese names. Soundex-Pinyin is a
spelling correction system to detect Chinese strings, but this
system requires Pinyin input [10]. In this study, a newly
improved algorithm based on the existing Soundex algorithm
is proposed to optimize the detection results of names. An
investigation is also done to improve the algorithm on
Chinese names detection while it is developed as a plugin
component applicable to any data cleansing or ETL (Extract
Transform Loading) process workbench. The duplicate
detection process reads Malaysian Chinese names as input
and then applies the Soundex method. The matching records
are written to a duplicate list, while the non-matching records
are written to a non-matching list. The matching list is
further analyzed by a subject matter expert to determine
Chinese word relevance. If it is relevant and matched, the

outcome is true positive, otherwise it is considered false
positive, for example Chan and Chin surnames.
The results of this study are supported through the use of
a confusion matrix, which provides false positives and
accuracy readings [12]. False positive readings provide
information on the ability of the Soundex method to detect
the correct duplicates. The accuracy reading provides to the
user the confidence level of the Soundex method in general.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, the problem statement is formulated. In Section III, the
method to customize Soundex rules is described. In Section
IV, the results using the new Soundex are presented and
discussed. Finally, in Section V, this paper concludes with a
summary and ideas for future enhancement.
II.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
A.
English text based Soundex method
This study uses the Soundex method for duplicate name
detection; thus, the matching is done on the Soundex codes.
The Russell Soundex method was developed with the
following rules, to produce a four-digit alphanumeric code:
•
Step 1: The first letter of the name is selected as the
first digit of code, but all occurrences of characters
A,E,H,I,O,U,W,Y are omitted.
•
Step 2. Assign the codes to the letters as in Table I.
•
Step 3. If two or more letters with the code were
adjacent in the original name, omit all but the first.
•
Step 4. Convert to the four-digit format by adding
training zeros if there are less than three digits, or by
dropping the right most digits if there are more than
three.
The Russell Soundex is accurate to detect character
similarities
between
names
after
vowels
and
coded
characters are dropped. It is suitable to detect duplicate
names due to its nature to detect names based on closest
phonetic sounds. The Soundex was originally developed to
uncover specific relative’s names in American history
journals, but in recent time, it is used in record linkage
analytics [11]. The major problem was that the English based
Soundex did not produce good results when it was applied
for Chinese names. The original Soundex’s rules were not
suitable for detecting Chinese names. In the first duplicate
detection test with Russell Soundex code, the result was not
encouraging because there was a high a number of duplicates
and false positives.
B.
Multiple formats of Chinese names
The
collection of 300
and
527
names
from
our
experiment data also provides us with some information on
how the actual scenario might be found in government or
private agencies when processing Chinese names. There are
a few name formats to consider in the Soundex process that
might affect the accuracy. In particular, when working with 4
digit codes, the prefix with English name, for example
Franky Cheah, and double names with alias symbol for
example Chin@Ah Kow, have very limited success in
producing true positive duplicates. The name formats
encountered in our sample data for testing are described
below.
1.
Chinese name with surname first: Lou Sheng, Lin
Hui Ling.
2.
Chinese name composed of three or more separate
words: Kwai Yung Chui Ja
3.
Hyphenated
Chinese
disyllabic
name,
with
an
uppercased second syllable: Han-Sheng Lin
4.
Combination of an American given name and a
Chinese middle name: Jean Yun-Hua King
5.
Family name in the middle of the name: Abraham
Ng Kamsat
6.
Chinese name with alias of second name: Ngoh
Swee Lan @ Ng Swee Lan
III.
METHODS
A.
Customize Soundex rules
In this study, we present three rules, namely Soundex 13,
Soundex 20 and Soundex 21, that show significant results.
By using data integration tool, such as Pentaho or Talend, the
Soundex script is applied to an ETL flow. Matching the
duplicates
was
done
by
comparing
the
four-digit
alphanumeric codes against duplicate items. The duplicate
matching result is further examined manually in order to
determine the number of duplicates and false positives. We
tested two sets of names (300 and 527) and the results of the
Russell Soundex test is given in Table IV. Apparently, there
was a high number of false positives in the duplicates results.
The duplicate items, in general, were closely spelled names.
In Table II, the Soundex 21’s rules are described as
follows:
1) Vowels are considered for Chinese names due to the
fact that vowels are the core in Chinese syllabic structure.
Vowels cannot be omitted in any Chinese syllables and the
simplest Chinese syllabic structure is composed of a vowel
and a tone, for instance, “I” in International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA) or yi in Hanyu (Pinyin). There are two
values for vowels, 6 for “I” and 7 for “U”. The two
characters “Y” and “W” ( value 8) are also included in the
matrix as these two glides are regarded as allophones of the
high vowels /i/ and /u/ under certain conditions in Chinese.

2) For consonants, we grouped them according to the
place of articulation. For instance, value 1 is for labial
consonants “ B, P, F, V”; value 2 is for denti-alveolar
consonants “D, T, L”; value 3 is for alveolo-palatal
consonants “ J, Q, X”; value 4 is for denti-alveolar
consonants “ Z, C, S” and fricative “R”; value 5 is for velar
consonants “G, K”. Among these consonants, “V” is a
special one as it is used by Malaysian Chinese names due to
the fact that many names are spelled in dialects. However,
the pronunciation of “V” is not used in Mandarin.
3) The three vowels A, E, O and two other letters M,N
are omitted due to their high frequency in word histogram
(Table V).
In Soundex 13, the main difference from Soundex 21 is
the labial consonants “B,P,F,V,M” that include the M for
Chinese phonology nasal sound. Value 5 is left blank for
consistency. The omitted letters are “A,E,H,O,N”.
In
Soundex 20, the main difference from Soundex 21 is the
labial consonants “B,P,F,V,M” in which there is the
additional M for Chinese phonology nasal sound. The
omitted letters are “A,E,H,O,N”. After many test iterations, it
was found that Soundex 21 produces better results than
Soundex 13 and Soundex 20.
IV.
RESULTS
Given the experimental data from two data sets, namely
300 name lists and 527 name lists, four tests were conducted
using Russell Soundex and the customized Soundex versions
13, 20 and 21.
The result data is divided into actual and predicted output
in order to calculate true positives (TP), true negatives (TN)
and false positives (FP) readings. The accuracy and false
positives formulas are given in Table IV. With the help of a
Chinese language expert, we identified the duplicates by
taking into consideration at least two words and also close
spelling which should represent the same Chinese character
in reality. Actual duplicates are recorded in a data matrix.
After the Soundex tests, prediction observation is recorded
such as TP, TN, FP. The prediction data is either yes or no.
Thus, each set of data then has the confusion data matrix
ready for examination.
A.
Duplicate detections with Russell Soundex
The results in Table IV show duplicates, accuracy, and
false positives. The non-duplicate list shows false negatives,
whereby supposedly matched names are not detected.
The number of duplicates found for 300 and 527 names
are 45 and 85, respectively. The false positives percentage
was 46.3% for the first set of 300 names. The family name
Chong and Cheong were close, but they did not represent the
same Chinese character, similarly Lai and Lee, also Chin and
Chan. The family names heavy with vowels and short in
length would likely cause false positives if their first names
were the same or similar in spelling.
Referring to Table III, the names Lim Jing, Tan Sin Yee,
Wong Meow Fah, were given the respective codes L525,
T525 and W525. However, the algorithm also gave the same
codes for Lim He Jian, Tan Jenny and Wong Nyet Yin which
were not related in reality. The names were detected as
closely matched because Russell Soundex omitted many
characters that Chinese names usually have.
B.
Duplicate detections with customized Soundex rules
For the first stage of the project, we had our Soundex
method testing on the names using a revised phonetic
algorithm. For the 300 names list, Russell Soundex detected
a higher number of duplicates and accuracy readings as
compared to Soundex 13, Soundex 20 and Soundex 21. It is
also noticed that, in the set of 300 names, the false positives
of Soundex 21 were fewer than Soundex 20. For the 527
names list, the Soundex 13 had the most number of
duplicates.
For the 527 names list, the Soundex 13 had
38.3% of false positives and that was higher than Soundex
20 and 21. Both Soundex 20 and 21 had almost the same
number false positives. In general, the customized Soundex
results had lower false positives and number of duplicates
than the results from Russell Soundex. The accuracy of
custom rules is also generally higher than using Russell
Soundex. The number of false positives for Soundex 20 and
Soundex 21 was almost the same. The effect of letter M was
not significant. The Soundex 21 was far better than Soundex
20 in accuracy readings of the 300 names list, but both had
the same accuracy for the 527 names list.

There were false positive results due to the presence of
English names prefix, the closely matched spelling of
different family names, such as between Chia and Chai, and
the dissimilarities between first names (second and third) of
the same family name (first).
When applied to Chinese names, the Soundex result had
a few false positives because of misspelled names and
English
name
prefixes
and
closely
matched
name
consonants. The closely matched name occurred when all
vowels and other omitted characters were removed, such as,
in Soundex 13, Tee Yan Qi and Tan Hwa Jie revealed a
similar code, namely T735.
C.
Conclusions
Soundex 21 was generally far better than Russell
Soundex in producing fewer duplicates and false positives.
The false positives of Soundex 21 were slightly fewer than
Soundex 13, but almost the same as Soundex 20. The
Soundex 21 had higher accuracy reading than Soundex 20.
This result gave confidence that the Soundex 21 was able to
produce a good duplicate detection result.
V.
CONCLUSION
When using Russell Soundex in the duplicate detection,
the result produced a high number of false positives. The
number of false positives is reduced while the percentage of
accuracy is increased when the code rules are customized
and improved in Soundex 13, Soundex 20 and Soundex 21.
As a result, the duplicate detection, especially with Soundex
21, produced an acceptable result. Future research is needed
on automating the intelligence to detect and verify Chinese
names as part of a duplicate error correction system.
