Towards a New Alternative to Assess the Validity of Driving Simulators: 
The Concept of Presence 
 
Abstract— In this paper, we propose a new approach of the 
behavioral validity’s assessment of driving simulators. Our 
ambition is to find a way of measuring “presence” to use it as a 
measure for ecological validity in driving simulators. The 
underlying assumption is that a person experiencing a strong 
sense of presence in the virtual environment will react in this 
environment as if it would be a real one. We propose to 
measure "presence" by measuring “attention” toward the 
driving task". Our objective is to demonstrate that the higher 
the subject's attention required by the primary driving task 
will be, the more the spatial presence will be felt. In the 
experiment, we tried to vary "attention" by adding a dual task 
and by adding traffic and measure driving performance and 
subjective "presence" (MEC-SPQ: Measurement, Effects, 
Conditions-Spatial Presence Questionnaire). The main result is 
a lack of congruence between subjective and behavioral 
measures.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
In the 1960s, driving simulation was mainly used to train 
specific target audiences such as novice drivers, law 
enforcement officers and truck drivers [3]. Since then, many 
advances have been achieved in terms of computing, visual 
display and vehicle dynamics rendering [2]. Driving 
simulation was originally developed to avoid cost of field 
studies, allowing more control over circumstances and 
measurements, and ensuring safety in hazardous conditions 
[1]. In the second half of the twentieth century, simulation 
was being successfully applied to aeronautical, rail and 
maritime operations. In spite of significant differences, it is 
interesting to note that the development of driving 
simulation was based on the development of flight 
simulation. Driving is a dynamic task with a set of rapid 
control maneuvers involving critical feedback for avoiding  
obstacles and preventing crashes [10]. Compared to the 
activity performed by air line pilots, driving involves higher  
amplitude, and higher frequency cues. The motion feedback 
does not play a key role for the major part of slow 
maneuvers performed by civilian pilots. There is no 
evidence that motion base-simulators are more efficient than 
fixed base simulators for training of commercial pilots [6]. 
Thus, there is a stark contrast between driving simulation 
and flight simulation (Civil aviation only). Compared to an 
airline pilot, a driver needs a higher degree of motion 
simulation. That is probably the reason why the use of flight 
simulators is more than commonplace for pilot training and, 
conversely driving simulators are not widely used for driver 
training due to the inherent higher complexity of the driving 
task. 
 Nowadays, driving simulators are usually designed for 
two purposes: research and training. The simulator is 
essentially used to place constraints on driver behavior in 
order to study driver distraction and workload or used as test 
beds for highway design [15]. The use of a modern 
advanced driving simulator for human factors research has 
many advantages such as experimental control, efficiency, 
expense, safety, and ease of data collection [20]. However, 
the literature describes some possible disadvantages, i.e., 
simulator sickness, accurate replication of physical 
sensations, and most importantly, validity. 
In this paper, we will first look at a brief overview about 
the ecological validity to identify which specific issues still 
need to be addressed in driving simulation.  Then a 
methodological alternative will be exposed through the 
concept of Presence. The remainder of the report basically 
consists of exposing results about this new experimental 
approach. 
 
II. 
ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY 
In spite of significant advancements in the physical 
fidelity of the driving simulation, a lack of realism seems to 
be always observed in the major part of driving simulator 
studies [4]. The most important question is to know in 
which extent measures from simulation are similar to those 
obtained in the real world. This multidimensional problem 
is called simulation validation [5]. This question has been a 
concern for at least 25 years. Blaauw [5] defined two types 
of validity. The first one is the absolute validity; it deals 
with the extent to which a manipulation of a variable in the 
real world produces the same or equivalent change in the 
same measure when manipulated in a driving simulator. The 
second one is called the relative validity and refers to the

extent to which the direction of change of a variable is in the 
same direction as a corresponding manipulation and 
measure in the real world [16].  If absolute validity is 
obviously desired by researchers, regarding the variability 
of driver performance, it seems highly unlikely to have an 
exact correspondence of on-road and simulation measures. 
Furthermore, there is no bad or good simulator from a 
methodological point of view. The simulation validation 
seems to be arbitrated between the research issue and how 
simulators are used to investigate this question. 
 Each simulator must be validated for a specific use. In 
addition, the question of simulation validation has followed 
the perpetual development of a significant number of 
simulator components as computers and various display 
technologies. That is the reason why, since four decades, 
simulators have been designed to deliver more and more 
perceptual cues to the driver in order to reproduce as 
accurately as possible the experience of driving an 
automobile. Thus, simulator validity is often addressed in 
the extent to which a physical variable in a simulator 
corresponds to its operationally equivalent component in the 
real world is called Physical fidelity [19]. As previously 
discussed, simulation validity is multidimensional and can 
be related to behavioral and physical dimensions [12], but 
also to the perceived sensation of the subjective experience 
and objective performance [30]. Indeed, despite significant 
advancements in the fidelity of the driving experience 
driving simulator studies continue to be criticized for lack of 
realism [9]. More specifically, the physical fidelity of the 
driving experience appears insufficient to overcome 
criticisms concerning the lack of psychological fidelity [8], 
defined as the extent to which the risks and rewards of 
participation in the experiment correspond to real-world 
risks and rewards [21]. The main problem is that driving 
experimental studies failed to provide a non-artificial trip 
purpose which could be able to reproduce drivers’ motives 
inherent to the real driving activity.  
Generally, it appears that the assessment of the validity 
of the virtual environment involves the comparison of 
results obtained from studies conducted in real situations 
and in virtual environment. However, this comparison is 
expensive (instrumentation) and complex (strict control of 
all the events occurring in a real situation). This is probably 
the reason why questions about the validity of simulators 
are most often pending [23] and why only few studies on 
this question can be found.   
 
 
III. A METHODOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVE: THE 
CONCEPT OF PRESENCE  
Driving simulation is a historical component of virtual 
reality, the purpose of which being to enable one person (or 
more) to develop sensori-motor and cognitive activity in an 
artificial world [17]. The interaction of a person with the 
virtual world is a transposition of the perception-cognition-
action loop of human behaviour in the real world. 
Immersion in a virtual world cannot be the same as in the 
real world [11], since the user has learned to act naturally in 
a real and physical world (without, for instance, any delay 
and/or sensorimotor bias). Thus, immersion, depending on 
the sensorimotor contingencies permitted by the simulator, 
is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the expression, 
within the virtual environment, of a performance that is 
representative of the actual situation [18]. Facing this 
problem, a concept emerged in the '80s from the early steps 
of research about virtual reality. This concept addresses the 
issue of "ecological" validity of the behaviour observed in 
virtual environments. It is the concept of presence. This 
multidimensional concept is considered as the ability of 
individuals to adopt behavioural patterns similar to that 
observed in everyday life and therefore as their propensity 
to respond to various stimuli by a realistic way [26]. 
Kaptein et al. [14] and Tichon [28] already proposed this 
concept as a tool for assessing driving or railway simulators 
but only in driving situations generating a state of stress.  In 
studies about presence, finding a consensus about presence 
conceptualization in order to enhance its operationalization 
and its assessment [27] seems to be the main challenge. 
Various attempts have been made to describe this concept. 
Despite divergences, the major part of publications 
considers that presence rests on an attentional basis 
[22][24][25][31].  
Thus, we decided to modulate experimentally the 
cognitive load induced during the simulated driving task, in 
order to generate different attentional states and finally to 
induce different levels of spatial presence. We crossed the 
two following independent variables:  1) A secondary task 
(dual-task paradigm), supposed to distract the driver from 
the primary task (driving) and 2) the presence of traffic on 
the roadway, supposed to focus the driver’s attention toward 
the primary task. Our objective was to develop a sensitive 
measure of presence in order to assess the simulator 
validity. Our main hypotheses were: 
-H1: The vehicle traffic in the virtual world is a positive 
predictor of the different sections of the MEC Spatial 
Presence Questionnaire. 
-H2: A dual task performed during the driving is a 
negative predictor of the different sections of the MEC 
Spatial Presence Questionnaire and of the driving 
performance.

 METHOD  
A. Participants 
Twenty experienced car drivers, with at least five years 
of experience (14 men and 6 women), were divided into four 
groups, by crossing two independent variables, i.e., a dual 
task to be performed or not during the experiment and the 
presence or not of other vehicles’ traffic on the road. The age 
of the participants ranged from 22 to 45 (M=32.8 years,

SD=6.45). All were tested on a voluntary basis, having 
signed an informed consent form. 
B. Apparatus 
The experiment was carried out using the SIM²-
IFSTTAR (French Institute of Science and Technology for 
Transport) fixed-base driving simulator equipped with a 
multi-actor parallel architecture for traffic simulation 
(ArchiSim) and an object database SIM²-IFSTTAR 
(simulation software). The “ArchiSim” architecture was built 
on the DR2 traffic simulation model (management of 
“autonomous” and “enslaved” vehicle with a behavior 
defined by the scripts for each scenario, simulation generated 
by captors of punctual and space traffic) and on the 3D SIM2 
loop of visualization [7]. The interactive driving station 
comprised one quarter of a vehicle including a seat, a 
dashboard, and controls equipped with captors, i.e. pedals 
and steering wheel. The projected display (at 30 Hz) 
presented a field of view of 150° horizontally and 40° 
vertically. 
C. Procedure 
In our experiment, we used a digital model of the 
Versailles Satory runway, which is a closed loop of 3.7km, 
with long straights and corners with different radii of 
curvature.  The first factor was the level of attention induced 
by the virtual environment with two levels: automated 
bidirectional traffic or not. The second factor was the level 
of cognitive involvement induced by the real world with two 
levels: presence of a dual task or not. The secondary task 
consisted in launching every minute a digital hourglass by 
double clicking the mouse of a laptop positioned so that the 
person had to deport his gaze from the main visual scene. 
Half of the subjects had to perform the dual task, either in 
condition "traffic", or in condition "no traffic" on the Satory 
circuit. The dual task might be considered as a derivative of 
the time-production task [33]. It is important to note that 
this dual task was used as a manipulation device and not as 
a performance measurement. That is the reason why 
reaction times were not presented in this paper. Whatever 
the experimental conditions, each participant had to perform 
10 laps with a maximum speed of 110 km/h by respecting 
the Highway Code. We applied a 2 X 2 factorial design. 
Four experimental groups of five subjects were thus created 
(see Table I).

D. MEC Spatial Presence Questionnaire 
After each session, an adapted version of the MEC 
Spatial Presence Questionnaire (MEC-SPQ) [11][29] was 
used. As suggested for each scale, we used a 5-point Likert 
scale ranging from 1 (‘I do not agree at all’) to 5 (‘I fully 
agree’). We used 4-item scales for the tested dimensions. On 
the first level, Visual Spatial Imagery (VSI) was assessed 
with items such as " When someone describes a space to 
me, it’s usually very easy for me to imagine it clearly”; for 
allocation of attention "I dedicated myself completely to the 
medium"; for the Spatial Situational Model (SSM) " I was 
able to imagine the arrangement of the spaces presented in 
the medium very well".  On the second level, higher 
Cognitive Involvement (CogInv) was assessed with items 
such as " I thought most about things having to do with the 
medium"; for Suspension of Disbelief (Sod)" I didn’t really 
pay attention to the existence of errors or inconsistencies in 
the medium”. Finally, spatial presence was measured and 
analysed by the self-location dimension (e.g., «I felt as 
though I was physically present in the environment of the 
presentation”). 
E. Driving performance 
 We analyzed two behavioral variables reflecting the 
driving performance, i.e. means and Standard Deviations of 
speed and of Lateral Position (SDLP).

RESULTS 
A. MEC Spatial Presence Questionnaire 
A mean score was computed for each group for the 
various dimensions of the MEC SPQ (see Table II). Overall, 
Whatever the section of the questionnaire, participants 
reported rather high scores. Specifically, “attention” scale 
(M= 4.2; SD=0.70) had the highest score while “cognitive 
involvement” scale (M=3.33; SD=0.95) had the lowest. 
The generalized linear model was used in order to test 
our hypotheses, with a 2x2 factorial design and independent 
groups. Then multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) 
was considered for assessing interaction effects between 
independent variables. From the MANOVA analysis, no 
interaction effect was observed between the traffic condition 
and the dual task condition.

MEC SPQ RESULTS 
 
 
Whatever the experimental condition no significant 
effect was observed (p<0.05) on the various sections of the 
MEC Spatial Presence Questionnaire. Contrary to what had 
been hoped  the dual task and the traffic had no impact on 
the questionnaire results. 
 
 
B. Driving performance 
1) Lateral Position: An interaction effect was first 
observed 
between 
dual 
task 
and 
traffic 
(F(1, 
360)=28.827;p<0.01). Lateral positions of Groups 1 and 2 
submitted to traffic were higher than those of groups 3  and 
4 not submitted to traffic (see Table III). A dual task effect 
is also observed in the absence of traffic, (F(1,360)=35.27, 
p<0.01). Indeed, subjects not submitted to the dual task 
(Group3) had a higher mean lateral position compared to 
subjects submitted to the dual task (Group4).

was 
observed 
(F(9,360)=2.33;p=0.012) on 10 laps performed between 
groups not submitted to the dual task (group 1 and group 3) 
and groups submitted to the dual task (group 2 and group 
4).

SPEED (km/h) 
 
 
 
 
Subjects not performing the dual task drove faster than 
others (see Table IV). 
3) SD of lateral position (SDLP): There was no 
interaction effect between group and lap variables 
(F(24,1754)=0.60, 
p=0.94). 
However, 
the 
group 
significantly influenced the SDLP (F(3, 1754)=156,39, 
p<0.01). Over the 10 laps, the group 4 submitted to the dual 
task without traffic had the higher mean contrary to groups 
1, 2, 3. 
4) SD of speed: There was no interaction effect between 
group and lap variables (F(24,1754)=0.60, p=0.93). 
However, the group significantly influenced the SD of speed 
(F(3, 1754)=41,018, p<0.01). Over the 10 laps, the group 2 
submitted to the dual task with traffic had the higher mean 
contrary to groups 1, 3, 4.  
 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
Results globally showed that whatever the experimental 
condition, no significant difference was clearly observed for 
the different sections of our presence questionnaire. Indeed, 
the vehicle traffic in the virtual world was not a positive 
predictor of the different sections of the MEC Spatial 
Presence Questionnaire. The dual task was not a negative 
predictor of these different sections either. Although the dual 
task did not have a strong effect on the subjective measures 
of presence, it affected the behavioral measures. As 
described in the literature [13][32], low values in driving 
performance (SD of speed and SDLP) indicated a good 
steering control and a stable and consistent driving. Indeed, 
the SD of speed in traffic condition and the SDLP in no 
traffic condition were higher in dual task than in single task. 
Drivers submitted to the dual task without traffic drove in the 
middle of the road (the smallest mean lateral position), which 
could be interpreted as an efficient strategy but pretty 
inconsistent with the Highway Code. Similarly, participants 
submitted to the dual task in traffic condition have tried to 
reduce their speed as a compensatory strategy to deal with 
the dual task. Unfortunately, it appeared that they also failed 
to maintain a stable driving with a lack of speed control (the

highest SD of speed). Thus, driving performance seemed to 
be globally impaired by the dual task. 
In conclusion, the main outcome was that behavioral 
measures revealed significant effects of the manipulated 
variables (traffic and dual task) on driving performance. 
These effects showed that participants took into account 
these variables. For instance, they indicate that traffic clearly 
influenced the lateral position in the lane, which can be 
considered as a positive (although rough) indicator of 
presence and reactivity to the simulator’s scenario. However, 
these behavioral effects were not confirmed by subjective 
reports. One explanation could be that, whatever the current 
experimental conditions, driving activity did not involve 
high-level, conscious, cognitive processes. Despite high 
scores reported through the MEC Spatial Presence 
Questionnaire, driving was probably more based on a set of 
procedures or routines. Our experimental conditions might 
have been insufficient to induce several distinct levels of 
attention, involvement and suspension of disbelief, leading to 
several distinct levels of presence. Thus, high levels of self-
reported presence (positively correlated with behavioral 
measures) might require to develop more challenging 
scenarios, in terms of controlled attention, cognitive 
involvement and more specifically, in terms of emotions 
induced by the media.
