Abstract—Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become an
area of great interest due to their usage in a wide range of
applications. A preliminary study concerning the viability of a
WSN introduced in the environment is recommended, considering
that this type of network is applied with several variables that
inﬂuence the operation of the network. Those variables directly
affect the network performance metrics such as the Received
Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). The present paper provides a
study about the application of a WSN on a speciﬁc environment
to practice sports, in which the RSSI metric was used to study the
link quality. The study uses several power prediction models, and
the results were compared with real measurements in order to
identify the best prediction model in this particular environment.
Keywords–Wireless Sensor; RSSI; Sports environment; Real
measurements.

INTRODUCTION
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have became a very
interesting research topic in the last few years. The recent ad-
vances in microelectromechanical systems technologies, wire-
less communications, and digital electronics have enabled the
development of low-cost sensor nodes, that are capable of
communicating with each other over short distances. Small
nodes consist of a few components: a radio part for spreading
data, a sensor part for sensing environment phenomena, a
processing unit and a power supply. The potential application
of wireless technologies has also been recognized by the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which
set up a standardization group 802.15.4 for designing a new
physical layer for low-data rate communications combined
with positioning capabilities [1].
WSNs came into the spotlight during the past years due
to the advances in wireless communications, such as new
information technologies and electronic attributes developed
for those technologies [2]. It is even possible to afﬁrm that
WSNs are a quite promising technology of this generation
since they have a great utility because of their implementation
in industrial control systems. Other advantages to be mentioned
are their low cost and multi-functional sensors that perform
surveillance functions and day-to-day activities control.
It is because of their versatility that WSNs have generated
increasing interest in the past few years [3]. In the last two
decades, surveys indicate that the wireless systems will be
capable of extending even more the application ﬁelds. There
are applications such as in health care, home automation
and automation in general. A relevant topic observed while
researching wireless systems, was the characterization of how
the radio signals range varies according to indoor and outdoor
environments because of the conditions on some ambient
factors, that can immediately make a transmission harder to
be done, due to interferences [4].
The main goal of this research is to perform a study in
addition to the works presented by [5] and [6], in which the
authors conducted a performance analysis of ZigBee devices
in each environment. This work uses the same space so that,
from the results presented in [5] and [6] the performances
can be compared with power prediction models, and, thus,
estimate the accuracy of the proposed model. This application
has importance because of the existence of different places,
such as for sporting events, which makes necessary the use
of resources to provide improvements, such as water, in
environments where this type of WSN is widely used.
This paper is organized as follows: Section II shows fun-
damental concepts in ZigBee and RSSI. Section III shows the
related works and Section IV shows the importance of power
prediction in networks. In Section V the mechanisms of Radio
Frequency (RF) Propagation are shown. Section VI shows
the Propagation Models used in this paper. In Section VII
the Statistical Methods used to analyze the measurements are
explored. Section VIII shows the Methodology of Experiments
and ﬁnally, Section IX shows the results and conclusion about
this work.

ZIGBEE TECHNOLOGY AND RSSI
The ZigBee technology is an option to supply a space in
WSN’s network architecture. This technology has advantages
compared of other communications protocols, such as Wi-Fi
[7] and Bluetooth [8]. ZigBee technology has a protocol which
supports mesh, star and tree networks, creating more than one
path possible between transmitter and receiver.
Thus, an information packet that can not be transmitted
through one path can ﬁnd another path that may deliver it.
This works in a similar way with the routing table which is
created by a router, making possible the delivery of a packet.

ZigBee operates in three frequency bands: 868 MHz in
Europe, 915 MHz in the USA and 2.4 GHz in the rest of the
world. It bases on IEEE’s 802.15.4 protocol to implement the
Physical (PHY) and Media Access Control (MAC) layers from
the OSI model. Other layers are deﬁned by ZigBee Alliance
[9]. In many applications, and in the ZigBee Technology the
performance is measured by the RSSI metric.
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is used as
a measurement system to estimate the transmission quality
between two nodes based on their relative distance. RSSI is
implemented under IEEE 802.11 Standard [10]. This method
uses relative distance to estimate the transmitted signal quality
by comparing the received signal with probability distributions
and location measurements based on the statistic analysis
method [11]. On RSSI, its importance is due to the severity
of fading effects on wireless communications, causing their
existence to directly affect the performance of wireless com-
munications systems [6], [12], [13], [14]. Most 802.11 radio
modules support RSSI, which means it is possible to calculate
received power to each received packet. The power or energy
of a signal travelling between two nodes is a signal parameter
that contains information related to the distance between those
nodes. This parameter can be used together with path-loss and
shadowing model for distance estimation [1].

RELATED WORKS
Various papers have been published with the purpose of
investigating the effects on the propagation of radio signals
in the ZigBee devices. Jafer et al. [15] have investigated
the effects caused by external factors on the RF signals.
Speciﬁcally, they have analysed the RF activity outdoors for 24
hours in order to investigate the inﬂuence of time on the RSSI
measurements and therefore to estimate the difference between
day and night measurements. The effects of the communication
were aleatory and erratic because people might have been
passing through the area. The effects of internal factors on
RSSI measurements have also been analyzed, such as the
effect of polarization antenna between the transmitter and the
receiver [16], or the effect of the conception of hardware
devices [17]. Pellegrini et al. [18] perform a RF propagation
analysis using collected RSSI values.
IV.
IMPORTANCE OF PROPAGATION PREDICTION
Before implementing the designs and conﬁrming the plan-
ning of wireless communication systems, accurate propagation
characteristics of the environment should be noted. Propa-
gation prediction usually provides two types of parameters
corresponding to the large-scale path loss and small-scale
fading statistics. The path loss information is vital to determine
the coverage of a base-station (BS) placement and also in
optimizing it. The small-scale parameters usually provide
statistical information on local ﬁeld variations and this, in turn,
leads to the calculation of important parameters that helps im-
prove receiver (Rx) designs and combat the multipath fading.
Without propagation predictions, these parameter estimations
can only be obtained by ﬁeld measurements which are time
consuming and expensive [19].
V.
RADIO FREQUENCY PROPAGATION
With the increasing capacity of mobile communications,
the size of a cell is becoming continuously smaller: from
macrocell to microcell, and then to picocell. The service for
environments includes both outdoor and indoor areas.
When propagation is considered in an outdoor environ-
ment, three different areas catch our attention: urban, suburban,
and rural areas. In those cases, the terrain proﬁle of the
particular area needs to be considered. The terrain proﬁle may
vary from a simple, curved Earth to a highly mountainous
region. The presence of trees, buildings, moving cars, and other
obstacles must also be taken into account. The direct path,
reﬂections from the ground and buildings, and diffraction from
the comers and buildings’ rooftops are the main contributors
to the total ﬁeld generated at a receiver, due to radio-wave
propagation.
Reﬂection, diffraction, and scattering are the three basic
propagation mechanisms that impact propagation in mobile
communication systems [20] which will be brieﬂy explained
below.
A. Reﬂection
Reﬂection occurs when a propagating electromagnetic
wave impinges upon an object that has very large dimensions
compared to the wavelength of the propagating wave. It occurs
from the surface of the ground, from walls, and from furniture.
And when it does, the wave may also be partially refracted.
Figure 1. Reﬂection.
The coefﬁcients of reﬂection and refraction are functions of the
material properties of the medium, and generally depend on the
wave polarization, the angle of incidence, and the frequency
of the propagating wave [20]. These effects are shown in Fig.
1.
B. Diffraction
Diffraction occurs when the radio path between the trans-
mitter and receiver is obstructed by a surface that has sharp
edges, (Fig. 2).
Figure 2. Diffraction.
The waves produced by the obstructing surface are present
throughout space and even behind the obstacle, giving rise to
41

AICT 2017 : The Thirteenth Advanced International Conference on Telecommunications

the bending of waves around the obstacle, even when a line
of sight (LOS) path does not exist between the transmitter
and receiver. At high frequencies, diffraction - like reﬂection
- depends on the geometry of the object, as well as on the
amplitude, phase, and polarization of the incident wave at the
point of diffraction [20]. These effects are shown in Fig. 2.
C. Scattering
Scattering occurs when the medium through which the
wave propagates, consists in objects with dimensions that
are small compared to the wavelength, and also where the
volume number of obstacles per unit is large. Scattered waves
are produced by rough surfaces, small objects, or by other
irregularities in the channel.
Figure 3. Scattering.
In
practice,
foliage,
street
signs,
lampposts,
and
stairs within buildings can induce scattering in mobile-
communication systems. A sound recognition on the physical
details of the objects can be used to accurately predict the
scattered signal strength [20]. These effects are shown in Fig.
3.
VI.
PROPAGATION MODELS
Propagation models are fundamental tools for designing
and deploying any wireless communication system including
WSNs. The models are closely related to the system work-
ing environment and characteristics. In general, propagation
models are methods and algorithms used to predict the signal
strength level along with the description of the signal level
variability. Its main purpose is to predict the distortion and
attenuation of the RF signal that will reach the receiver [21].
Currently there are many mathematical models with the
purpose of predicting the average strength of the wireless sig-
nal transmission between two network devices. These models
are useful in estimating the radio area of coverage of a trans-
mitter and they are called propagation models, featuring the
signal strength when there is a separation between transmitter
and receiver. The PLdB represents the losses of the model, d
represents the distance, f represents the frequency, and the λ
is a wavelength and all losses from these models are given in
dBm.
A. Free Space Model
This model determines the power at the receiver in meters
of transmitting power, the gain of the antennas and the distance
between sender and receiver. They are not contemplated in
the model losses that may occur, due to the propagation
environment and the coverage area of an antenna that could be
irregular. The satellite communication, as there is line of sight
between transmitter and receiver, can be used as propagation
model. The attenuation (path loss) for the Free Space model
is deﬁned by equation (1).
PLdB = −10 ∗ log(Gt ∗ Gr ∗ λ2
(4 ∗ Π)2 ∗ d2 )
(1)
Where Gt and Gr represents the transmitter gain and
receiver gain.
B. Log-Distance Model
Deﬁned in [22] and [23], Log-Distance model considers
that the average received power decreases logarithmically with
distance from the transmitter. This model is characterized by
the (2) equation.
PLdB = PL(d0) + 10 ∗ n ∗ log( d
d0
)
(2)
Table I shows the values for the coefﬁcients (n).

C. Shadowing Adapted Model
Adapted models are implemented from the classic models
by adjusting (adaptation) their coefﬁcients relation to ﬁeld
measurement by the minimum mean square error technique.
The main advantage of this approach is the fact that it ”encap-
sulates” some model input parameters, thus avoiding problems
related to bad dimensioning, which can lead to considerable
errors of prediction. It is deﬁned in [24] by equation (3).
PLdB = −10 ∗ β ∗ log(d) + 9
(3)
Where β is a path loss exponent of the environment.
D. Tewari, Swarup and Roy Model
This model is deﬁned in [25]. This model was developed
based on measurements performed in the forest of India, which
resembles in some attributes, the Amazon rainforest [25], and
it is deﬁned by equation (4).
PLdB = 88 + 20 ∗ log(fMHz) + 40 ∗ log(dKm)−
20 ∗ log[Ht(m) ∗ Hr(m)] + Lf(dB)
(4)
Where Ht represents transmitter height, Hr represents
receiver height and Lf represents environmental losses deﬁned
in [25].

E. Weissberger Model
For empirical models, it was found that the model develo-
ped by Weissberger estimate the excess of attenuation pro-
duced by vegetation, which is a model of interest when
providing for the existence of foliage, and to make prediction
for small stretches [26]. The loss model is given by equations
(5) and (6).
Case d ≤ 14m:
PLdB = 0.45 ∗ f 0.284 ∗ d
(5)
Case 14m ≤ d ≤ 400m:
PLdB = 0.45 ∗ f 0.284 ∗ d0.588
(6)
Where d represents distance and f represents frequency.
F. ITU-R Model
The International Telecommunication Union Recommenda-
tions (ITU-R) Model, deﬁned in [27], is given by equation (7).
PLdB = 0.2 ∗ f 0.3 ∗ d0.6
(7)
G. COST 235 Model
Deﬁned by [28], this model is given by equations (8) and
(9).
PLdB = 15.6 ∗ f −0.009 ∗ d0.26 − With leaf
(8)
PLdB = 15.6 ∗ f −0.2 ∗ d0.5 − Without leaf
(9)
H. RIM Model
RIM (Radio Irregularity Model) is a model developed
purposefully for wireless sensor networks. In isotropic models
of radio coverage, the received power is obtained by equation
(10).
Pr = Pt − PL + F
(10)
Where Pr represents received power, Pt represents trans-
mitted power, PL represents the path losses and F represents
component of fading. This model is deﬁned by [29] and as the
literature already mentions, the radio coverage is not a perfect
circle in real environments [23], neither it resembles a circle.
The RIM model is based on this irregularity. To symbolize the
irregularity of the radio coverage model, the parameter DOI
(Degree of Irregularity), was introduced in the RIM model.
Fig. 4 shows this irregularity of behavior in the propagation.
It is possible to observe that the bigger by the image
irregularity of the radio coverage is, the higher the DOI value
parameter. The description of the DOI calculation irregularity
is given by equation (11).
PR = PE − (PLDOI ∗ Ki) + F,
(11)
where:
•
PLDOI = Path Loss with DOI adjustment;
•
F = Component of fading.
•
Ki = Coefﬁcient representing the difference in losses
path loss in different directions, where Ki
=
1, case(i = 0), i.e., the angle being the angle 0 is
analyzed, in reference to line of sight;
•
i = Coefﬁcient of i-nth degree.

USED STATISTICAL METHODS
The results obtained have undergone a process of statistical
analysis for validating data. Such reliability is based on the
methods that follow.
A. Mean Square Error (MSE)
In practical terms, the Mean Square Error (MSE) equals the
sum of the variance and tendentiousness square estimator. An
estimator is used to deduce the value of an unknown parameter
in the statistical model. The estimating of MSE is expressed
by (12).
MSE =

where:

predicted value;
•
n: number of periods.
B. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
The average absolute percentage error calculation estimates
how exact is the actual value with the estimated one, in
percentage. Such a connection is expressed by (13).

METHODOLOGY OF EXPERIMENTS
The methodology adopted during the assembly from a
RSSI measurer and subsequent measurements with it were
made under the following step’s schedule.
•
First Step: The used device had a direct-access
terminal on a speciﬁc pin to read the RSSI. A PWM
(Pulse Width Modulation) modulated signal was read
in the pin. This signal was treated as an analogical
output but it is, as a matter of fact, a digital output
that generates an alternating signal (low and high
digital levels), where the data is codiﬁed in how long
the pin’s output stands on a digital level.
•
Second Step: Compatibility tests were performed
between the used Arduino Uno R3 platform and the
XBee modules and basic trigger circuits with the
modules, in order to verify whether there was correct
communication maintenance between the devices. At
this stage, the prototypes were assembled in assembly
boards. Other electronic components were also added
to the project, such as a 16 × 2 LCD (Liquid Crystal
Display) display for showing the reading values, and
components responsible for maintaining and feeding
the display, among other devices.
•
Third Step: At this stage, the source-code executed
by the prototype was written. The source-code devel-
opment used an open-source programming framework
for microcontrollers, called Wiring, that includes sev-
eral on-the-box applications allowing an easy devel-
opment of various input-output operations. That is one
of the reasons whereby it is the standard development
language for Arduino projects. The analogical pin (the
one who provides the RSSI value) was read through
the pulseInt() function, made for occasions like this
one. This function reads a high or low pulse on the
pin and then returns to its duration in milliseconds.
Thus, it measures the PWM pulses length.
Figure 5. Receiving device standing on the ground, during ﬁrst measurement.
The code executed by the micro-controller responsible
for the reading function can be found in the following
code, and Fig. 5 shows the prototype.
int dur = pulseInt (A1,LOW,200);
float val = analogRead(A1);
int rssi=(dur+50)*(-1);
•
Fourth Step: The measurements were made on an out-
door sports ﬁeld, Fig. 6. The transmitter was ﬁxed and
the receiver was taken to increasingly longer distances
from the transmitter. Two tests were made: on the ﬁrst,
both devices were on ground level. Starting with one
meter distance, the transmitter’s signal strength on the
receiver was measured. The distance was increased up
to the point where there was no connection. This test
was performed on a sunny day, in the afternoon, with
low wind, temperatures between 28 and 31 Celsius
degrees, and air humidity at 65%.
Figure 6. Place of measurements.
•
Fifth Step: At this stage we did the analyzes of
samples collected from the comparison variables of
the models used and the real measurements.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
From the conclusion of the data analysis, which was the
last stage of the work methodology, we obtained satisfactory
results that were expected for the work proposed. Fig. 7 shows
the curve obtained from the real RSSI values versus power
prediction curves for each propagation model.
The calculations of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Percentual Error (MAPE) were used as statistical
methods to measure the approximation of the actual measure-
ment with the proposed models. The results are described in
Table II.

values is very important to building this network. This work
contributes to the deployment of WSNs in the region of the
Campina Grande - Para´ıba in order to optimize the usage of
resources, such as water and electricity, considering that those
sports environments require a lot of water.
Figure 7. Used Models and Real RSSI Values.
From the analysis of the propagation models to power
prediction, we conclude that the Weissberger Model d < 14
and COST 235 with leaf are the best way to model the
power prediction in that area, but other models also had good
results. The major contribution to the research was the use of
a technology, such as ZigBee, applied to the monitoring of
sports practicing areas. That was the main objective of this
research, which was effectively reached.
The requirement of the experiments stands in the veriﬁca-
tion of the viability of applying ZigBee in that speciﬁc type of
environment, since to our knowledge, was not done in literature
so far. In addition, it was possible to perform an experiment
to test the effectiveness of an external RSSI meter, which can
be used visually and externally.
For this work, we chose to study only the transmission
range of the sensors in sports environments. In future work, we
intend to study the impact of climate on those measurements,
arranging the schedules for data collection on different days
with different climate and temperatures.
