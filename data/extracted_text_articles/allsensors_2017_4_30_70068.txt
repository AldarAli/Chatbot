Abstract — In this work, we focus on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 
detection at temperature up to 100°C in order to be compatible 
with most of flexible substrates. Such low temperatures require 
dedicated materials, as Zinc Oxide (ZnO), a widely used 
material for its sensing properties. Functionalization or doping 
is a growing research activity to improve sensor sensibility at 
lower gas concentrations and lower working temperatures. 
Aluminum-doped Zinc Oxide (Al-ZnO) has been shown as a 
possible way for NO2 detection. Moreover, nanocrystals 
improve the gas detection due to their high surface/volume 
ratio. Therefore in this work, Al-ZnO nanocrystals have been 
deposited by drop coating from colloidal solution as sensitive 
layer for air quality monitoring. The platform consists of Ti/Pt 
interdigitated electrodes on Si/SiO2 substrate. Herein, a brief 
description of the process steps will be provided. Gas sensing 
properties have been investigated in dark and under 
ultraviolet illumination at various heating excitation from 
room temperature around 25°C up to 100°C. These sensors 
present repeatable responses toward (NO2) with fast responses 
for low gas concentrations as low as 0.2 ppm.

 INTRODUCTION  
Nitrogen dioxide comes from vehicles, power plants, 
industrial emissions and off-road sources, such as 
construction, lawn and gardening equipment. It is one of the 
most dangerous air pollutants. It plays a major role in the 
formation of ozone and acid rain. Continued or frequent 
exposure to NO2 concentrations higher than 150 ppb may 
cause incidence of acute respiratory. These concentrations 
are detectable by ZnO, a widely used material for its sensing 
properties [1]. Aluminum-doped Zinc Oxide (Al-ZnO) has 
been shown as a possible way for NO2 detection as low as 
20 ppm [2]. Moreover, Pr. Morante’s team has reported that 
illuminating metal oxide gas sensors with ultraviolet (UV) 
light improve SnO2 nanowires performances to NO2 
detection [3]. In this work, NO2 detections have been made 
under UV illumination by Al-ZnO nanocrystals deposited 
on interdigitated electrodes fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrate 
using photolithography. In Section II, the Al-ZnO solution 
process will be described and the results will be discussed in 
Section III.

DESCRIPTION OF APPROACH AND TECHNIQUES  
This description is composed of two parts, one is the 
sensing film fabrication; the other is the measurement 
system set-up.  
A. Al-ZnO solution 
The Al-ZnO nanocrystals were obtained by a surfactant-
free chemical synthesis approach using zinc acetate and 
aluminum isopropylate as precursors with potassium 
hydroxide [4]. Fig. 1 shows a typical Transmission Electron 
Microscopy (TEM) image of the Al-ZnO nanocrystals, 
evidencing their size (diameter about 10 nm) and 
homogeneous size and shape dispersions.

The Aluminum doping level of 0.8 at. % was controlled by 
the metal precursors ratio, and determined by inductively 
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses. The 
Al-ZnO nanocrystals were dispersed in isopropanol as 
solvent using ethanolamine as short-chain surfactant to 
obtain aggregate-free solution. Al-ZnO nanocrystals drop 
casting allows the formation of thin films with improved 
conductivity compared to ZnO nanocrystals reference, both 
with and without low temperature annealing. 
B. Gas sensors 
Our gas sensor consists of Ti/Pt interdigitated electrodes 
for gas detection. Temperature is controlled underneath up 
to 100°C to improve the gas detection. The metal electrodes 
Ti/Pt were deposited on Si/SiO2 by magnetron sputtering 
with thicknesses of 5 nm and 100 nm, respectively. In this 
work, Al-ZnO nanocrystals were deposited by drop coating. 
They were used as sensitive material with a thickness of 200 
nm measured by a Dektak 6M stylus profiler. The Al-ZnO 
films obtained were annealed for 30 min at 150°C for 
removing solvents and improving their quality and stability. 
The aim was to study the possible use, in a future work, on

flexible substrates which do not allow temperature process 
higher than 150°C. In order to find the best operating 
conditions, the gas detections were carried out in a closed 
chamber by measuring the resistance through the sensitive 
material using UV light (λ = 325 nm) and temperature 
excitations (up to 100°C) under 30 s exposures to NO2. We 
used a power supply to control the operating temperature, a 
SourceMeter Keithley 2450 for the data acquisition and one 
UV Light-Emitting Diode (LED) for UV illumination 
situated at 10 mm from the sensing material to obtained 
more photogenerated charge carriers.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The gas sensor fabricated with Al-ZnO nanoparticles as 
sensitive material and deposited by drop coating on Si/SiO2 
substrate is presented in Fig. 2.  
                               
 
Figure 2. Sensor fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrate. 
Gas response of a gas sensor is defined by (1) as the ratio of 
the resistance change on the surface of the gas sensor before 
and after being exposed to NO2: 
R= Ra/RNO2  
      
      (1)  
where Ra is the sensor resistance through dry airflow and 
 RNO2 the sensor resistance in presence of NO2. 
Detection was possible in dark at 25°C, but without coming 
back to the baseline (not shown here). From 75°C, the 
resistance returns to its reference value obtained through dry 
airflow. In dark, our best operating temperature has been 
determined at 100°C. Fig. 3 shows responses in dark for 0.2 
ppm to 2 ppm of NO2 at 100°C.

Oxygen vacancies on metal-oxide surfaces function as n-
type donors increasing the conductivity of oxide. When Al-
ZnO gets exposed to NO2 (a typical oxidizing gas), an 
increase in resistance occurs due to oxygen ion adsorption 
from NO2 on the surface by trapping of electrons. Under UV 
illumination, the interaction between NO2 and oxide is 
greatly enhanced with the abundant photogenerated free 
electron. Similarly, UV illumination facilitates desorption of 
oxygen anions into neutral gaseous oxygen by providing 
photogenerated holes during the recovering period. Under 
continuous UV illumination, it was possible to detect low 
NO2 concentrations at room temperature and return to the 
sensor resistance in dry air after stopping the gas injection. 
However, Fig. 4 shows that, at 25°C under UV, about 45 
minutes are needed to return to the baseline.

By increasing the temperature up to 100°C, the response 
amplitude is multiplied by 10 at least and the time to return 
to the baseline is divided by 8. Fig. 5 illustrates sensor 
responses at 100°C under UV light illumination for 0.2 ppm 
to 2 ppm of NO2.

CONCLUSION  
This paper reports nitrogen dioxide (NO2) detection at 
temperature up to 100°C. Room temperature NO2 detection 
have been achieved by sensors on rigid substrate and 
improved with one UV LED illumination. The gas 
measurements in our experiments under UV showed good 
responses with fast response / return times towards NO2 
even at 0.2 ppm. The photogenerated charge carriers 
(electrons and holes) present important benefits for working 
at low temperatures. UV light illumination results in an 
increase in the response signal, enhanced sensing 
reversibility, and an enhanced recovery rate. It is open a 
new way to use Al-ZnO nanocrystals as sensitive layer for 
gas sensor devices on flexible substrates.
