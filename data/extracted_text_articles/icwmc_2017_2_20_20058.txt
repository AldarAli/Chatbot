Abstract—The macrodiversity system reduces long term fading 
effects and short term fading effects on wireless system 
performances simultaneously. The received signal is subjected 
to Nakagami-m short term fading and Gamma correlated long 
term fading resulting in signal envelope and envelope average 
power variation, respectively. The macrodiversity considered 
in this paper has macrodiversity selection combining (SC) 
receiver and two microdiversity SC receivers. Signal envelope 
average power at inputs in microdiversity SC receivers have 
correlated Gamma distribution with different average values. 
Level crossing rate of macrodiversity SC receiver output signal 
envelope is evaluated for the case that the user is at different 
distances of microdiversity SC receivers. 
Keywords- Gamma correlated long term fading; Nakagami-m 
short term fading; level crossing rate; selection combining (SC). 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Gamma long term fading and Nakagami-m short term 
fading degrade the bit error probability and the outage 
probability of wireless mobile communication radio system 
[1]. Macrodiversity technique can be applied to mitigate 
small scale fading effects and large scale fading effects on 
the outage probability, average bit error probability, the level 
crossing rate and average fade duration [2]. 
There are several diversity techniques which reduce 
fading effects on the bit error probability, the outage 
probability and the channel capacity. Maximal ratio 
combining (MRC), equal gain combining (EGC) and 
selection combining (SC) are the most widely used diversity 
combining schemes. In the scenario where Gaussian noise 
power is equally distributed in each branch of MRC receiver, 
squared output signal can be calculated as a sum of squared 
signals from its inputs [3]. Signal envelope at the EGC 
receiver output is a sum of signal envelopes from its inputs 
[4]. The SC receiver selects the branch with the highest 
signal envelope from input to provide service to user [5]-[7]. 
MRC is the optimal combining scheme, but its price and 
complexity are the highest. MRC and EGC combiners 
require knowing of all or some of the fading channel 
information and separate receiver for each branch of the 
diversity system, which increase the complexity of the 
system.   
The macrodiversity, considered in this paper, consists of 
macrodiversity SC reception and two microdiversity SC 
receptions. The macrodiversity SC reception selects the 
microdiversity with the highest signal envelope average 
power to enable transmission to the user and microdiversities 
select the branch with the highest signal envelope. 
Microdiversity receivers use antennas at one base station and 
macrodiversity receiver uses antennas at two or more base 
stations.  
Nakagami-m distribution describes small scale signal 
envelope in non line of sight multipath fading channels. For 
the case when parameter m is 1, shadowed Nakagami-m 
fading channel becomes shadowed Rayleigh fading channel, 
and when m goes to infinity, shadowed Nakagami-m channel 
becomes shadowed fading channel. When Gamma long term 
fading severity parameter goes to infinity and Nakagami-m 
short term fading severity parameter goes to infinity, Gamma 
shadowed Nakagami-m multipath fading channel becomes 
no fading channel [8]. 
The first order performance measures of wireless mobile 
radio systems are average symbol error probability, the 
channel capacity and the outage probability, and the second 
order performance measures are the level crossing rate 
(LCR) and average fade duration (AFD). The level crossing 
rate can be evaluated as mean of the first order of random 
process and average fade duration can be calculated as the 
ratio of the outage probability and the level crossing rate.     
There are more works considering LCR of wireless 
macrodiversity communication system operating over 
shadowed multipath fading channel. In [5], LCR and AFD of 
macrodiversity, with macrodiversity SC receiver and two 
microdiversity maximal ratio combining (MRC) receivers, 
operating over correlated Gamma long term fading and 
Nakagami-m short term fading channel are calculated. On 
the other side, the authors in [6] derived the infinite-series 
expressions for the second-order statistics (LCR and AFD) at 
the output of SC macrodiversity consisting of two 
microdiversity systems of MRC type with arbitrary number 
of branches, which is operating over Gamma shadowed 
Nakagami-m fading channel. 
The macrodiversity system with macrodiversity SC 
receiver and three microdiversity SC receivers working over 
Gamma 
shadowed 
Nakagami-m 
multipath 
fading 
environment is studied in [7]. The level crossing rate of

signals at outputs of microdiversity SC receivers are 
calculated and based on these formulas, the closed form 
expression for average LCR of macrodiversity SC receiver 
output signal is calculated. 
 The second order statistics of macrodiversity in Gamma 
shadowed Rician fading channel is analyzed in [3]. In paper 
[9], macrodiversity, with macrodiversity SC receiver and two 
microdiversity SC receivers, is studied and LCR of 
macrodiversity SC receiver output signal is calculated for the 
presence of Gamma shadowed k-μ multipath fading. 
In this paper, macrodiversity, with macrodiversity SC 
receiver and two microdiversity SC receivers, in the presence 
of Nakagami-m small scale fading and correlated Gamma 
long term fading is considered. Average powers of Gamma 
distribution are different. The distances of user and 
microdiversity receivers are different. The closed form 
expression for LCR of proposed wireless macrodiversity 
system 
is 
calculated. 
The 
level 
crossing 
rate 
of 
macrodiversity, when distances of user from microdiversity 
receivers are different, is not considered in open technical 
literature. 
This paper consists of five sections. After the first 
section, Introduction, where the topic is introduced and 
related papers analyzed, in the second section the system 
model is described. The expression for level crossing rate of 
macrodiversity SC receiver output signal is derived in the 
third section. In the forth section, numerical results are 
analyzed. Then, Conclusion is given with some final 
comments. In the Appendix, the integrals, which appear in 
the expressions for LCR, are solved.

MODEL OF MACRODIVERSITY SYSTEM  
The macrodiversity  has macrodiversity SC receiver and 
two microdiversity SC receivers. Macrodiversity operates in 
the presence of Gamma long term fading and Nakagami-m 
short term fading. This macrodiversity SC receiver selects 
microdiversity with the highest signal envelope average 
power and microdiversity SC receiver selects the branch 
with the strongest signal envelope. Model of considered 
system is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 3.  LCR versus macrodiversity SC receiver output signal envelope 
for variable Gamma fading severity parameter. 
It is visible from Figure 2 that LCR is bigger for smaller 
values of Gamma fading parameter β2 at low values of the 
signal envelopes. The system performances are better for 
lower values of the average level crossing rate.  
All these curves have maximums. When the Gamma 
shadowing severity increases, the maximal values increase 
also, moving to higher values of the SC receiver output 
signal envelope. 
The LCR takes greater values as the correlation 
coefficient increases. When the correlation coefficient goes 
to one, the least values of signal envelope occur at both 
microdiversity receivers and system has the worst 
performance. 
In Figure 3, the level crossing rate, depending on 
microdiversity SC receiver output signal envelope, is plotted 
for a few values of Gamma fading severity parameter. The 
LCR increases as the parameter β1 decreases at small values 
of the signal envelopes. Then, all curves achieve maximums 
and start to decline. The curves become wider at higher 
values of the parameter β1. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, macrodiversity with macrodiversity SC 
receiver and two microdiversity SC receivers is studied. 
Received signal experiences correlated Gamma long term 
fading and Nakagami-m short term fading resulting in signal 
envelope variation and signal envelope average power 
variation. 
Performance 
of 
macrodiversity 
system 
is 
considered for the case when distances between user and 
microdiversity SC receivers are different. Macrodiversity SC 
receiver mitigates Gamma long term fading effects on the 
level crossing rate and microdiversity SC receivers reduce to 
Nakagami-m short term fading effects on the outage 
performance, simultaneously.  
The closed form expression for LCR of macrodiversity 
SC receiver output signal is evaluated. The obtained 
expression can be used for calculation the level crossing rate 
at the output of macrodiversity operating over Gamma 
shadowed Rayleigh multipath fading. The influence of 
Gamma long term fading severity parameter, Nakagami-m 
short term fading severity and Gamma long term fading 
correlation coefficient is analyzed and discussed. Also, the 
influence of distances of the users from microdiversity SC 
receivers is studied.  
The system performance is better for lower values of the 
level crossing rate. The level crossing rate decreases as 
Gamma long term fading severity parameter increases and 
when Nakagami-m short term fading severity parameter 
increases. When Gamma long term fading correlation 
coefficient goes to one, LCR increases and macrodiversity 
system has performance as simple microdiversity system.  
LCR increases for lower values of the SC receiver output 
signal, and decreases for higher values of that signal. The 
influence of SC receiver output signal on the level crossing 
rate is more pronounced for lower values of this signal. 
The biggest contribution of this paper is derivation of 
LCR of macrodiversity system with different distances 
between user and microdiversity receivers.
