Abstract—Current health systems are becoming stronger and 
more efficient, with promises for better and healthier life 
quality. However, one of the prerequisites for this promise is 
that health systems are able to connect and interact with each 
other, by quickly and seamlessly exchanging data, using open 
standards and bypassing interoperability constraints. For that 
purpose, several researches have been proposed focusing on 
the field of interoperability, dealing with specific one-to-one 
scenarios of data transformation. Among these solutions, the 
translation of healthcare data into ontologies is considered as a 
solution towards interoperability. However, healthcare data 
can be found in multiple formats, while most of the current 
approaches are dealing with specific data formats and designs. 
To address this gap, in this paper, we are proposing an 
extended approach to create an ontology model from any data 
format, taking into account complex cases arising from 
multiple data design styles, by transforming the healthcare 
data into XML Schema Graphs (XSG) for providing it as an 
input to the Apache Jena, and finally generating Resource 
Description Framework (RDF) entities.

 INTRODUCTION 
Worldwide, healthcare is at the intersection of the 
introduction of disruptive digital innovations, with digital 
health revolutions playing a significant role in decreasing 
long-term healthcare costs, enabling better healthcare 
outcomes, and empowering both the patient and the 
healthcare provider with real-time data and connections with 
each other [1]. However, for this promise it is considered 
crucial that health systems are able to communicate with 
each other, by quickly and seamlessly exchanging data using 
open standards [2]. Nevertheless, one of the biggest issues in 
healthcare research is the ability of researchers to obtain 
healthcare record data, as information silos of healthcare data 
exist across both private and public sectors, affecting both 
patient care and medical research [3]. In order to overcome 
these information silos, there is a great need for legislative 
directives that allow and encourage data sharing across both 
federal and commercial healthcare environments, including 
security requirements to protect personally identifiable 
information and protected health information [4]. Even with 
these directives, issues will remain regarding information 
exchange, since data has to be shared with as many 
stakeholders as possible. To this domain, interoperability is 
the only sustainable way for letting systems to talk with one 
another and getting the complete image of a patient [5], 
considered of great importance to overcome today’s 
fragmented and proprietary global health systems, allowing 
stakeholders to make the most of health data, including 
extending, upgrading, and preserving it. According to [6][7], 
while global annual health spending reached $7.077 trillion 
dollars in 2015, this metric should increase to $8.734 trillion 
dollars by 2020. Moreover, according to [8], researchers 
predict that the healthcare market will have a value of $18.7 
billion by 2020, up from a size of $5.8 billion in 2015. What 
is more, the global healthcare middleware market is expected 
to reach $3.07 billion by 2023 from $1.90 billion in 2018, in 
order to overcome healthcare interoperability issues [9]. 
Such issues include exchanging healthcare data between 
disparate systems to support care coordination, population 
health management initiatives and most importantly to stay 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) 
compliant to support meaningful use of data and protect the 
privacy of individuals [10]. Based on [11], 86% of the 
mistakes made in healthcare are due to administrative 
reasons, where 30% of clinical tests have to be re-ordered 
since the results cannot be found. Moreover, the same report 
has showed that patient charts cannot be found on 30% of 
visits, while about 80% of all serious medical errors involve 
miscommunication during care transitions. 
Henceforth, it is undeniable that healthcare provisioning 
and research require healthcare data to be restructured into a 
common format and standard terminologies. In general, 
healthcare data can be either structured such as in relational 
databases, or semi-structured such as in eXtensible Markup 
Language (XML) data sources [12]. Therefore, data sources 
can be heterogeneous in syntax, schema, or semantics, thus 
making 
data 
interoperation 
a 
difficult 
task 
[13]. 
Consequently, syntactic heterogeneity is caused by the use of 
different models or languages, schematic heterogeneity is 
caused 
by 
structural 
differences, 
while 
semantic 
heterogeneity 
is 
caused 
by 
different 
meanings 
or 
interpretations of the data in various contexts. In all these 
cases, interoperability can be achieved by manufacturing 
medical domain ontologies for representing the different 
concepts, relationships, and axioms among the different 
healthcare 
datasets, 
and 
for 
representing 
medical 
terminology systems [14]. More specifically, ontologies 
provide a promised technology to solve especially the 
semantic heterogeneity problem, as a formal, explicit

specification of a shared conceptualization [15], referring to 
an abstract model of phenomena in the world, having 
identified the relevant concepts of those phenomena. 
‘Explicit’ means that the type of concepts used and the 
constraints on their use are explicitly defined. ‘Formal’ refers 
to the fact that the ontology should be machine readable, 
while ‘Shared’ means that the ontology should capture 
consensual knowledge accepted by the communities. 
In 
all 
the 
aforementioned 
cases, 
healthcare 
interoperability is currently delivered through the HL7 Fast 
Healthcare Interoperability (HL7 FHIR) standard [16], which 
despite its wide adoption, it still needs much time to become 
a global healthcare data exchange standard, as there exist 
systems that still produce data that are not related to it. 
Taking into consideration these challenges, in [17] a holistic 
approach has been presented for achieving interoperability 
through the transformation of healthcare data into its 
corresponding HL7 FHIR structure. Shortly, the provided 
mechanism was building the healthcare ontologies that were 
primarily stored into a triplestore, in order to identify and 
compare their syntactic and semantic similarity with the HL7 
FHIR Resources. Consequently, according to the aggregation 
of the syntactic and semantic similarity results, the matching 
and translation to the HL7 FHIR was taking place. In this 
paper, we are going to describe the mechanism of the 
automatic ontology creation of any data format that is 
currently in [17], taking into consideration that dozens of 
ontology creation mechanisms have been developed over the 
last decade, and nearly all of them are able to perform 
transformations only on specific data formats and standards 
(e.g., csv or xml files). 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, the related work is illustrated, while Section III 
depicts the overall approach with regards to the automatic 
ontology creation of any data format. Section IV includes the 
results of the evaluation of the proposed approach, while 
Section V presents our concluding remarks and future 
directions.

RELATED WORK 
A. Ontologies in Healthcare 
Current healthcare systems need to have the ability to 
communicate complex and detailed medical data in a secure, 
automated, and effective way. This can be achieved by 
building medical domain ontologies [18], in order to 
represent medical terminology systems. In general, an 
ontology represents a common, shareable, and reusable view 
of a particular application domain that gives meaning to 
information structures that are exchanged among different 
information systems. As a result, ontology’s aim is to 
achieve shareable knowledge for transmitting it between 
different stakeholders and application systems. Henceforth, 
the main goal is to create semantics in a generic way, 
providing the basis for agreement within a domain. 
Generally, the advantage of wrapping each information 
source to a local ontology is to allow the development of a 
source ontology independently of other sources or 
ontologies. Engineering new ontologies is not a deterministic 
process, since many design decisions must be made, while 
the designers’ backgrounds and the target application, 
influence their decisions in different ways. 
In the context of healthcare, ontologies may bring the 
indispensable integration of knowledge and data [19]. They 
are composed of existing medical knowledge, providing a 
way for building systems that help healthcare providers to 
perform clinical actions in a more efficient and effective 
way. Ontologies also specify semantic-based criteria that 
support different statistical aggregations for different 
purposes in healthcare, improving the accuracy of diagnoses 
by providing real time correlations of symptoms, test results 
and individual medical histories through standards-based 
systems for systematic crosschecking diagnoses. To this 
context, the authors in [20] developed a healthcare 
information system based on ontology methods, where 
healthcare practitioners were able to construct ontologies 
about new diseases, being easier to predict upcoming 
diseases. Furthermore, the authors in [21] built an ontology-
based healthcare context information model to implement a 
ubiquitous environment. In that case, contextual information 
was extracted and classified to implement the healthcare 
services using the context information model that could be 
defined through ontologies. As a result, application and 
healthcare service developers could use the sensed 
information in various environments by authoring device- 
and space-specific ontologies based on this common 
ontology. The research of [22] should be mentioned, where 
the authors proposed a framework and toolset that could 
provide a secure single point of access to a client’s full 
picture of her personal health information, by proposing an 
ontology-based framework. This framework was an 
independent tool that could automatically gather and 
combine a client’s health information from the various 
providers in their circle of care and provide the information 
securely and electronically without inconveniencing the 
client with multiple requests and sharing agreements. 
Finally, the researchers in [23] developed an ontology-based 
toolkit for improving the field of semantic interoperability in 
healthcare data. Shortly, the authors identified and specified 
the potential data sources, they conceptualized their semantic 
meaning and defined to what extent routine data could be 
used as a measure of the process or outcome of care required, 
in order to finally formalize and validate the final ontology. 
B. Ontology creation from different data sources 
In the field of ontology creation, several strategies and 
researchers have been developed for deriving ontologies 
mainly from heterogeneous XML data sources. Some of 
these approaches target on a general mapping between XML 
and Resource Description Framework (RDF) [24], while 
others aim at mapping XML Schema [25] to Web Ontology 
Language (OWL) [26]. In this domain, the authors in [27] 
proposed direct mappings from XML Schema to OWL, 
describing mappings from XML to RDF graphs, where the 
generated instances did not necessarily respect the ontology 
created from the XML Schema. The XML Schema to OWL 
mapping process was based on a set of interpretation and 
transformation rules from XML Schema to OWL. What is 
44

more, the authors in [28] developed a tool to create an OWL 
ontology from an XML Schema, and convert XML data to 
OWL instances compliant to the created ontology, through 
the development of four Extensible Style Sheet Language 
Transformation (XSLT) [29] instances to transform XML 
files to OWL, without any other intervention on semantics 
and structures during the transformation. The research in 
[30] proposed a tool that aimed at building an OWL 
ontology from an XML data source. This method was based 
on XML Schema to automatically generate the ontology 
structure, as well as a set of mapping bridges between the 
entities of the XML data source and the created ontology, 
contributing into query translation between OWL and XML. 
The authors in [31] proposed a framework that aimed to 
generate an ontology from a large source of XML Schemas. 
They presented a set of patterns that enabled the direct, and 
automatic transformation from XML Schema into OWL, 
allowing the integration of huge amounts of XML data in the 
Semantic Web. They focused on an advanced logical 
representation of XML Schema components and presented 
an implementation that was possible to mine XML Schema 
sources in order to extract enough knowledge to build 
semantically 
correct 
ontologies 
with 
considerable 
expressivity. Moreover, the research in [32] proposed an 
approach to construct OWL ontology from XML document 
with the help of entity relation model. The authors proposed 
an XML-to-Relational (XTR) mapping approach to map an 
XML document to an entity-relation model, and then a 
Relational-to-Ontology (RTO) mapping approach to map an 
entity-relation model to an OWL ontology. What is more, the 
authors in [33] proposed an approach to integrate 
heterogeneous XML sources using an ontology-based 
mediation architecture. The ontology integration process 
contained the schema transformation and ontology merging 
steps, used for modelling each XML source as a local RDF 
ontology. Finally, the authors in [34] were based on XML 
Schema to build an ontology. In the case that the schema did 
not exist, it could be automatically generated from the source 
XML document, coping with all the possible complex cases 
that could arise from different XML Schema design styles. 
C. Key contributions of the proposed approach 
Several researches have been proposed so far in the 
literature focusing on the healthcare interoperability field, 
whereas dealing with specific one-to-one scenarios of data 
transformation. Among these solutions, the translation of 
healthcare data into ontologies is considered as a solution 
towards interoperability. However, healthcare data can be 
found in multiple data formats, while during ontology 
transformations, different terms are produced for the same 
concept. Most of the developed approaches are dealing with 
specific data format (i.e., mostly XML data format), while 
they do not tackle the question on how to create the ontology 
model, if there is not any XML Schema available. To 
address this gap, in this paper we are proposing an extended 
approach to create an ontology model from any data format, 
taking into account even the most complex cases arising 
from different data formats and design styles.  
III. 
PROPOSED APPROACH 
This study is based on an existing approach [17] that can 
transform any healthcare dataset of any format and nature, 
into HL7 FHIR through the translation of the latter into 
ontologies, and their matching through syntactic and 
semantic similarities. In our case, we are going to propose a 
mechanism for describing the automatic creation of the 
healthcare ontologies for the ingested healthcare dataset. Fig. 
1 illustrates the overall architecture of the mechanism as 
depicted in [17], where the components that are highlighted 
with grey color are going to be ignored since they have 
already been discussed. Therefore, in the proposed 
mechanism only the Ontology Building System is going to 
be described in deep details. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Overall architecture. 
A. Ontology Building System 
The objective of the Ontology Building System is to 
gather the XML Schema of the gathered healthcare datasets, 
and conclude in building the corresponding ontologies as 
described in the following five steps (Fig. 2): 
 
 
Figure 2.  Ontology Building System. 
1. 
Each healthcare dataset is being preprocessed 
through a document parser (Data Transformer) in order to 
identify the type of the document in which the dataset is 
stored (e.g., JSON, CSV, etc.). In any case, the Data 
Transformer converts the type of the healthcare dataset into 
XML format, by identifying the different elements of the 
document, as well as the parent and the child nodes, along 
45

with their attributes. Henceforth, all the converted data is 
being stored into an XML document. 
2. 
The created XML document is transformed into 
XML Schema using the Trang API [35]. Shortly, Trang 
performs conversions between different schema languages 
for XML, and is constructed around a RELAX NG object 
model [36] designed to support schema conversion, taking as 
input a file written in XML syntax and producing an XML 
Schema. 
3. 
Afterwards, the XML Schema is analyzed using the 
XML Schema Object Model (XSOM) [37]. The SOM 
provides a set of classes in the System.Xml.Schema 
namespace that allows the reading of a schema from a file or 
the creation of a schema in-memory. The schema can then be 
traversed, edited, compiled, validated, or written to a 
fileXSOM. In this context, XSOM allows applications to 
easily parse XML Schema documents and inspect 
information into them. 
4. 
Sequentially, the output of the XSOM is used as an 
input for the Java Universal Network/Graph framework 
(JUNG) [38], which is used for graph-based manipulations. 
The latter, generates an XML Schema Graph (XSG) [39] that 
describes the schema in the same way whatever its design 
style is. 
5. 
Finally, the XSG is used as an input to the Apache 
Jena [40], in order to generate ontologies in the form of RDF 
entities [41]. It should be mentioned that RDF entities 
emerge from complex types, element group declarations, and 
attribute-group declarations according to specific matching 
rules. Apart from these, ontologies contain different object 
properties that emerge from relationships that are of type 
element-subelement 
relationships, 
while 
they 
contain 
datatype properties that emerge from attributes and from 
simple types. 
IV. 
EVALUATION 
A. Use Case description 
The use case exploits a healthcare dataset structured in 
CSV format, covering all the previous steps. The dataset that 
has been used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed 
approach (Fig. 3) was a sub-dataset of anonymized citizens’ 
personal information, derived from Karolinska Institute [42].  
 
 
Figure 3.  Use case dataset sample. 
 
In more details, it consists of 5000 different instances of 
the personal information of certain citizens about their:  
(i) subject: string that depicts the personal identifier  
(ii) gender: integer that varies between 0 (male) and 1 female  
(iii) date of birth: date/time that depicts the birth date  
(iv) date of death: date/time that depicts the death date 
(v) cause of death: string that depicts the cause of death 
B. Application of the Ontology Building System 
In order to depict the proposed ontology creation process, 
after providing as an input the described dataset, we gather 
the following results, for each different step of the described 
process of Section III.  
Initially, after the preprocessing of the CSV use case 
dataset through the Data Transformer, the results of the 
XML creation of this dataset are represented in Fig. 4. 
 
 
Figure 4.  XML document of the use case dataset. 
In sequence, the XML Schema that is created through the 
derived XML document is represented in Fig. 5. 
 
 
Figure 5.  XML Schema of the use case dataset. 
The next step of the proposed mechanism deals with the 
analysis of the XML Schema through the XSOM, whose

results are provided as an input to the JUNG in order to 
finally generate the XSG. The latter is represented in Fig. 6. 
 
 
Figure 6.  XSG of the use case dataset. 
To this end, the XSG is used as an input to the Apache 
Jena to generate the RDF entities that are depicted in Fig. 7. 
 
 
Figure 7.  RDF entities of the use case dataset. 
Finally, Fig. 8 represents the final output of the 
mechanism, depicting the ontological hierarchical tree of the 
use case dataset, as it is visualized by WebVOWL [43].

CONCLUSIONS 
Currently, health systems are becoming stronger and 
more efficient, with promises for better and healthier life 
quality. However, one of the prerequisites for this promise is 
that health systems are able to interact with each other, by 
seamlessly exchanging data using open standards, thus 
bypassing interoperability constraints. In this domain, 
healthcare ontologies have been developed to resolve data 
heterogeneity issues, resulting in interoperability by 
knowledge sharing and reuse. Most of the developed 
approaches that aim in ontology building are dealing with 
specific data format, while they do not tackle the question on 
how to create the ontology model, if there is not any XML 
Schema available. In order to address the gap of automated 
ontology creation, a previous research was considered about 
a healthcare ontology matching mechanism that has the 
ability of transforming healthcare data to HL7 FHIR format, 
by building healthcare ontologies, and finding syntactic and 
semantic similarities among these ontologies and the 
ontologies of the HL7 FHIR Resources. In that case, an 
extended approach was presented that is able to create an 
ontology model from any data format, taking into account 
complex cases arising from different data formats and design 
styles. According to the results of the evaluation of the 
proposed approach, the overall ontology creation mechanism 
provided reliable results that are compatible with the 
manually derived results. 
Generally, writing an automated ontology building 
mechanism that is able to cover multiple data formats is still 
a challenging research task, since there exist several 
mechanisms that provide the same functionalities. In this 
context, we will work on the evaluation of the Ontology 
Building System with the similar mechanisms that were 
studied and are currently used, in order to identify potential 
errors and gaps that could be addressed in the current 
approach. What is more, we want to perform a similar 
comparison and evaluation concerning the other sub-
mechanisms of the current approach for healthcare 
interoperability, in order to conclude to more reliable and 
efficient results. To this end, we will continue on the 
evaluation of the Ontology Building Systems with datasets 
of different sizes, standards and formats, respecting privacy 
issues, based on the mechanism developed in [44].
