Abstract—To design a building that fulfills requirements 
regarding low energy use, it is crucial to perform energy 
simulations of the building in question during the design 
process and the simulations must be representative of the 
building during operation. All countries within the European 
Union will require new buildings to be nearly zero energy 
buildings beginning in 2019. In nearly zero energy buildings 
and passive houses, the user related energy uses, household 
electricity and domestic hot water heating, make up about 80 
% of the total energy use since the use of space heating is low. 
The building's heating demand is affected by the occupants’ 
use of domestic hot water and household electricity. Increased 
use of domestic hot water increases the heating demand, while 
a high use of household electricity can reduce the heating 
demand. Different user characteristics will result in different 
heating demand in the same building, and in low energy 
buildings, different user characteristics will have a relatively 
higher impact compared to less energy efficient buildings. 
There is a lack of studies that analyze resulting energy use of 
dwellings based on distribution of measured user related input 
data. The aim of this paper was to annually measure household 
electricity and domestic hot water volume in 562 apartments, 
present the measured distributions and analyze the influence 
on the apartment heating demand of energy efficient buildings 
and typical buildings by use of simulations of the building 
physics and the building services. The results show that, in 
order to predict the energy use of energy efficient residential 
buildings, with a reasonable accuracy, the different users’ 
characteristics regarding household electricity and domestic 
hot water must be taken into account. Furthermore, to 
determine the impact that different users will have on a 
building's heating demand, the analysis must be based on the 
actual building and the result should be given as a distribution 
rather than as a single figure.

 INTRODUCTION 
To design a building that fulfills requirements regarding 
low energy use, it is crucial to perform energy simulations of 
the building in question during the design process and the 
simulations must be representative of the building during 
operation [1]. Research on the agreement between predicted 
and actual use of space heating in residential buildings in 
Sweden shows that measured use of energy for space heating 
during operation exceeds the predicted energy use by 
between 50% and 100%, even in low energy buildings [1][2] 
[3][4].  
Karlsson et al. [5] stressed the importance of accurate 
input data for the energy simulations of buildings. The 
building users’ behavior is very important in low energy 
buildings and is the hardest to model according to [5]. Low 
energy buildings have well insulated building enclosures and 
efficient ventilation heat recovery systems which lead to 
small transmission and ventilation heat losses. During a large 
part of the year, internal heat gains from people, household 
electricity and solar heat gains balance the heat losses with a 
zero heating need as a result.  
The use of household electricity is influenced strongly by 
the building users’ behavior and is a major internal heat gain. 
Household electricity is defined as all electricity, not used for 
heating and ventilation, used in an apartment or a house. 
Domestic hot water is the hot water from taps in an 
apartment or a house. A large variation has been measured in 
equal apartments by [6]. Example of reasons for this 
variation can be occupancy levels and shower habits.  
All energy uses in a building are part of the buildings 
energy balance and, for example the heat gains from a higher 
use of household electricity should result in a lower use of 
heating given that the heating control systems work as 
intended. Different user characteristics will result in different 
heating demand in the same building, and in low energy 
buildings, different user characteristics will have a relatively 
higher impact compared to less energy efficient buildings. 
The users’ relatively larger impact on the building's 
performance in today's and tomorrow's buildings must be 
taken into account during design and management [7]. The 
users’ impact on the building performance has usually been 
described by different categories of users, for example 
families with children or single elders. Bagge [8] proposed to 
describe the different users’ lifestyle and impact by statistical 
distributions of user related parameters and combinations of 
parameters for the reason that it is unknown who will live in 
an apartment or a house over time. A vast majority of 
residential buildings are certainly not built for a specific 
category, but for a cross section of the population leading to 
an urgent need for a statistical approach on users’ variation. 
Energy use in buildings is commonly regulated. For example 
in Sweden, there are requirements on the sum of heating and 
non household electricity [9]. Heating is the sum of space

heating for keeping the interior at desired temperature and 
domestic hot water heating. Non household electricity is 
used for ventilation and purposes outside apartments. A 
building's heating demand is affected by the occupants’ use 
of domestic hot water and household electricity. Increased 
use of domestic hot water increases the heating demand, 
while a high use of household electricity can reduce the 
heating demand.  
Various combinations of high and low uses of household 
electricity and hot water may be more or less favorable for 
achieving a low heating demand depending on building 
characteristic such as insulation standard and efficiency of 
ventilation heat recovery.  
All countries within the European Union will require new 
buildings to be nearly zero energy buildings beginning in 
2019. In order to make accurate predictions and decisions 
regarding future buildings, it is important to have a good 
statistical description on energy related user characteristics 
and its impact on buildings energy use and not only use 
average values of guessed or measured user related 
parameters. 
There is a lack of studies that analyze resulting energy 
use of dwellings based on distribution of measured user 
related input data. The aim of this paper was to annually 
measure household electricity and domestic hot water 
volume, which by definition are totally user influenced, in 
562 apartments, present the measured distributions and 
analyze the influence on the apartment heating demand of 
energy efficient buildings and typical buildings by use of 
simulations of the building physics and the building services 
taking into account the user of the building. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the 
methods used and has four subsections A. Measurements, B. 
Simulated buildings and apartments, C. Parametric study and 
D. Simulation tool. Section III presents the measurement and 
simulation results and discusses these. Section IV presents 
the conclusions. 
 
II. 
METHOD 
The measured use of household electricity and domestic 
hot water in 562 apartments were used as input data in 
simulations of total heating demand of apartments in order to 
study the effect of different users. Parametric studies were 
performed to study the effect of different window area, 
ventilation heat exchanger efficiency, the average heat 
transmittance of the building and the location of the 
apartment within the building on the total heating demand 
taking into account the 562 different users. 
As defined in the introduction, heating refers to the sum 
of space heating and domestic hot water heating. Space 
heating is the heating supplied by the heating system to the 
interior and the ventilation supply air, that means excluding 
domestic hot water heating. Household electricity is in 
practice completely used within the apartments, and is the 
only electricity used within the apartments [10]. There are 
also other internal heat gains such as solar radiation or 
occupant heat gain that is handled by the simulation 
program. 
A. Measurements 
As a basis for individual billing, household electricity 
and domestic hot water was measured during 2012 in 562 
one bedroom apartments in buildings located in Karlstad, 
Sweden at latitude 59.39°, and built between 1932 and 2007 
with a large portion built in 1980 and in the period 1961-
1965. To obtain the domestic hot water heating, the 
measured domestic hot water volume was multiplied by 55 
kWh/m³ based on [11]. The distribution of the uses and their 
average values are presented as well as the actual 
relationship between the measured parameters in the studied 
apartments. Each measured apartment’s use of household 
electricity and domestic hot water describes a user which 
means that in this study, 562 users are described. 
B. Simulated buildings and apartments 
The 562 combinations of use of household electricity and 
domestic hot water heating were used as input data in a 
simulation model of two different apartments in two different 
buildings. Building 1 had building technology representing a 
typical Swedish building designed during 2014 in 
accordance with the Swedish building code [9]. Building 2 
had building technology representing a Swedish passive 
house [12]. 
In each building, the heating demands of one bedroom 
apartments, at two different locations in the building, were 
simulated. In both buildings, one of the apartments, 
Apartment 1, was located in the center of the building with 
adjacent apartments on two sides, above the ceiling and 
below the floor. That means that the apartment was going all 
way through the cross section of a floor of the building with 
half of the exterior surfaces facing north and the other half 
south. The other apartment, Apartment 2, was at the eastern 
gable and on the top floor meaning that exterior surfaces also 
included the eastern wall and the roof. The eastern wall did 
not include any windows. The outdoor climate data were 
obtained from Meteonorm [13] for Karlstad, the same city as 
measurements were from. Figure 1 presents the hourly 
outdoor temperature during the normal year. The normal 
year average outdoor temperature is 6.4°C.

Building 1 had exterior walls with a U-value of 0.18 
W/(m²·K), roof with U-value of 0.13 W/(m²·K) and 
windows with a U-value of 1.3 W/(m²·K). Building 2 had 
exterior walls with a U-value of 0.1 W/(m²·K), roof with U-
value of 0.08 W/(m²·K)  and windows with a U-value of 0.8 
W/(m²·K). Thermal bridging was estimated by adding 20 % 
to the described transmission losses for all building 
components. Mechanical supply and exhaust ventilation with 
heat recovery was used, 75 % temperature efficiency. The 
apartments had a heated floor area of 60 m² and a ceiling 
height of 2.4 m2. The apartments north and south facades 
were 18 m2 respectively and the eastern façade was 19.2 m2 
in the gable apartments. 60 % of the window area was facing 
south and 40 % of the window area was facing north. The 
ventilation airflow was 25 l/s and the leakage airflow was 
0.04 l/(s·m2) and 0.013 l/(s·m2) referring to exterior surface 
area for Building 1 and Building 2 respectively. The 
apartments were heated to 22 °C and the occupancy was 0.03 
persons/m² based on actual measurements of occupancy in 
the city of Karlstad [14]. The solar heat gain coefficient of 
the widows was set to 0.4.  
Energy simulations in practice are commonly based on 
one-zone calculations. The same approach was chosen in this 
study to match sector practice. 
C. Parametric study 
In order to study different building technology 
characteristics impact on the heating demand with the 
different user scenarios, a parametric study was carried out. 
Window area was varied from zero to 45 % of heated floor 
area in steps of 5 %. Ventilation heat recovery temperature 
efficiency was varied from 50 % to 95 % in steps of 5 %. 
When the window area was varied, the ventilation heat 
recovery temperature efficiency was set to 75 %. When the 
ventilation heat recovery temperature efficiency was varied, 
the window area was set to 25 % of heated floor area. For 
each step, the heating demand was calculated with the 562 
different user scenarios which results in the same number of 
different heating demands for each of the four different 
apartments studied. Statistics regarding the heating demand 
are presented for each step for each of the studied apartments 
respectively. The presented statistics are minimum, 10, 25, 
50, 75 and 90 percentile and maximum as well as average 
values of total heating demand. That means that a total of 
45120 simulations of heating demand were carried out to 
obtain the results of the parametric study. 
D. Simulation tool 
Code was developed in the Delphi programming 
language to simulate the energy use hourly over a normal 
year explicitly by help of the power balance shown in Figure 
2 [15][16] to handle user scenarios and parametric studies 
effectively. ROOM is the simulated zone. Ptrans is the 
transmitted heat through the envelope, Pcap is the heat from a 
first order heat capacitor with the temperature tcap and a heat 
capacitance of 15000 J/(m²·K). Psolar is incoming shortwave 
solar radiation that heats the room and Pvent is the power 
needed to change the temperature of the supply air, tsa, 19°C, 
to the temperature of the exhaust air, tex. It is assumed that 
the room temperature, troom, is 22°C and can rise to 27°C and 
is the same as the exhaust temperature. Pint refers to the load 
from people and household electricity that both were 
assumed to be constant during the year based on the 
measurements.

Quantities are given in the text. 
Psupport is the energy needed to keep the room in balance 
at the desired troom. Since no cooling system was used, Psupport 
could not be negative. Air heating after the heat recovery of 
the heating recovery ventilation is included but not shown in 
Figure 2. Also no air cooling was included. The SFP value of 
the air handling unit was set to 2 kW/(m³/s). Freezing 
protection of the heat recovery is modelled by keeping the 
exhaust air above freezing temperature. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
All measured calculated and simulated energy results are 
annual with the area referring to heated apartment floor area. 
The abbreviations HEL is used for household electricity and 
DHW for domestic hot water heating. As defined, Heating is 
the sum of Space heating and DHW.  
Figure 3 shows the distribution of the annual use of HEL 
and DHW respectively. Average annual use of HEL was 
26.7 kWh/m2 and average annual DHW was 21.4 kWh/m2. 
The median values are by definition the 50 percentile, 
directly readable in the figure. The highest use of HEL was 
100 kWh/m2 and the highest use of DHW was 104 kWh/m2. 
Figure 4 shows DHW as a function of HEL, a regression 
line and its coefficients are given. There is a rather weak 
correlation with a coefficient of determination of 0.14. In 
Figure 4, an apartment with low use of household electricity, 
about 11.5 kWh/m2, had the highest use of domestic hot 
water, and an apartment with high use of household 
electricity, about 63 kWh/m2, had a domestic hot water use 
close to zero which indicates the weak correlation. This 
implies that it is not straight forward to define a typical user 
of HEL and DHW. Hence, the actual distribution of 
combinations needs to be taken into account. 
Figures 6 and 8 present statistics regarding the simulated 
total heating demand for different window areas in the 
apartments in Building 1 while Figures 7 and 9 present 
corresponding statistics for the apartments in Building 2. 
When the window area increases, the total transmission 
losses increases due to the higher transmission losses through

a window compared to a wall. However, a larger window 
area can result in more solar heat gains. 
Figures 10 and 12 present statistics regarding the 
simulated total heating demand for different ventilation heat 
recovery temperature efficiencies in the apartments in 
Building 1. Figures 11 and 13 present corresponding 
statistics for the apartments in Building 2. In Figures 6 
through 13, maximums are given in the figure caption and 
percentile curve types are presented in Figure 5.

The results show that the heating demand increases with 
raised window area and decreases with raised ventilation

average heating demand increased 43 kWh/m2 in Apartment 
1 and 47 kWh/m2 in Apartment 2 when 45 % window area 
was used compared to zero. In Building 2, the corresponding 
increase was 17 kWh/m2 in Apartment 1 and 23 kWh/m2 in 
Apartment 2.

The difference between the 95 percentile and the 5 
percentile of heating demand in Figures 6 through 13 
represents the resulting span of heating demand taking into 
account 90 % of the users excluding the 5 % low and high 
extremes. The average difference between the 95 and 5 
percentile of heating demand was about 42 kWh/m2 for all 
studied window sizes in both buildings both apartments. In 
Building 1’s Apartment 1, the span in heating demand, 
taking into account the middle 90 % of the users, is about the 
same as the average increase in heating demand when having 
45 % window area compared to zero while the span is 
slightly lower than the heating demand increase in 
Apartment 2. In the more energy efficient passive house type 
Building 2, the span in heating demand was more than twice 
as high compared to the  average increase in heating demand 
when having 45 % window area compared to zero in 
Apartment 1 and almost twice as high in Apartment 2. The 
above mentioned analysis compares the heating demand at a 
very large window area, 45 % of heated floor area, to the 
heating demand at no window area. It is not likely to have 
apartments with no windows due to daylight requirements. 
The difference in heating demand between all other studied 
window percentages will be smaller while the difference 
between the 95 and the 5 percentile of heating demand is 
about the same for all studied window sizes. The different 
user behaviors have a higher impact on the heating demand 
compared to different window areas and this increases with

increasing energy efficiency regarding building enclosure 
and ventilation heat exchanger efficiency. 
In Building 1, the average heating demand decreased 16 
kWh/m2 in Apartment 1 and 17 kWh/m2 in Apartment 2 
when 95 % temperature efficiency of the heat recovery was 
used compared to 55 %. In Building 2, the corresponding 
decrease was 13 kWh/m2 in Apartment 1 and 15 kWh/m2 in 
Apartment 2. The average difference between the 95 and 5 
percentile of heating demand was about 42 kWh/m2 for all 
studied efficiencies in both buildings both apartments. The 
span in heating demand was about three times higher than 
the average decrease in heating demand when having 95 % 
efficiency compared to 55 %. The difference in heating 
demand between all other studied temperature efficiencies 
will be smaller while the difference between the 95 and the 5 
percentile of heating demand is about the same for all studied 
efficiencies. The different user behaviors have much higher 
impact on the heating demand compared to different 
ventilation heat exchanger temperature efficiencies. 
As expected, the heating demand increases with raised 
window area and decreases with raised ventilation heat 
changer efficiency. However, different user behavior can 
have a much higher impact on the heating demand compared 
to different window sizes and heat exchanger efficiencies. 
Since today’s buildings are, and tomorrows buildings will be 
even more, energy efficient, the user related energy uses will 
be an even larger part of the buildings energy balance. As 
important as it is to accurately model the physical properties 
of the building enclosure and the building services in 
simulation tools, as important is it to take different users’ 
behavior into account. 
The building technique and building services might have 
actual performance that differs from design values. For 
example, the thermal transmittance of the building enclosure 
is to some extent dependent on the quality of the construction 
work on site. However, according to the results, even 
relatively 
large 
variations 
in 
thermal 
transmittance, 
exemplified by the difference between Building 1 and 
Building 2, at 25 % window area and 75 % heat exchanger 
efficiency, is 17 kWh/m2 which is less than half of the 
difference in heating demand taking into account the 
difference from the middle 90 % of the different users and 
slightly higher than the difference between the 75 and 25 
percentile representing the middle 50 percent of the users. 
The results imply that energy simulations of residential 
buildings should take the variation in user behavior into 
account and rather than presenting a single figure, present the 
predicted energy use in a span that represents the variation of 
the user behavior, for example based on the middle 90 % or 
50 % of the users. Based on the performed simulations, the 
span representing 90 % of the different user behaviors is 
about 42 kWh/m2 and the span representing 50 % is about 14 
kWh/m2.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
Annual use of household electricity and domestic hot 
water was measured in 562 one bedroom apartments in 
Sweden. Simulations of annual heating demand, taking into 
account the 562 different users, show that in order to predict 
the energy use of energy efficient residential buildings, with 
a reasonable accuracy, the different users’ characteristics 
regarding household electricity and domestic hot water must 
be taken into account. Furthermore, to determine the impact 
that different users will have on a building's heating demand, 
the analysis must be based on the actual building and the 
result should be given as a distribution rather than as a single 
figure.
