Abstract—By proposing a new approach to fuzzy decision 
making, we try to support the medical decision, concerning 
recommendations for the treatment with hyperbaric oxygen 
(HBO). This treatment can be used for patients, suffering from 
necrotizing fasciitis. Due to the disease rarity, it sometimes is 
difficult for a physician to determine, if a single patient needs 
the treatment with HBO. We thus identify the decision with a 
linguistic variable, equipped with treatment recommendation 
levels. The choice of the appropriate level is based on values of 
clinical symptoms, found in the patient. To extract the optimal 
recommendation level for the treatment with HBO, we involve 
fuzzy set techniques in the decision model. In the paper, we 
mainly concentrate on designs of fuzzy sets, standing for clinical 
symptoms and recommendation levels. The levels act as the 
outcomes, dependent on the cumulative input of the patient’s 
clinical markers. Since the focus is laid on a parametric 
structure of the outcomes, then we can categorize the model as 
robust approach to algorithmic modeling of outcomes, being 
part of eHealth data records.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare, but deadly soft tissue 
infection. The disease is known from Hippocratic times, but 
has been newly rediscovered in modern times as an “infection 
with flesh eating bacteria” by Jones in 1871 [1]. More 
specifically, the illness was described in 1952 by Wilson [2], 
who also renamed these types of infections as necrotizing 
fasciitis. The NF group contains various types of infections, 
usually treated with antibiotics and surgery [3]. In some 
cases, the treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is the 
adjunct of treatments, mentioned above [4]. Blekinge County 
City Hospital in Karlskrona, Sweden, has the possibility of 
providing HBO. Therefore, we serve the treatment to NF 
patients, who live in the south-eastern part of Sweden. 
From the clinical point of view, we want to know, if the 
patient has a good prognosis of recovery without 
recommendations for the specialized treatment with HBO or 
he/she needs the HBO supplement.  
To make this prognosis, a physician has to rely on his 
experience. Nevertheless, the number of patients is not so 
large, which makes difficult to solve routinely the problems 
of HBO dosing.  
Therefore, we initialize the mathematical model of fuzzy 
decision making, which considers only one decision 
(indications of treating the patient with HBO).  
From our design, we have excluded a utility matrix, which 
constitutes the main part in most of fuzzy decision making 
models [5]-[9]. The entries of the matrix are stated as 
numerical or verbal utilities, assigned to pairs (decision, state). 
When using the utility matrix, shown in Section II, the 
researchers developed different decision methods, like, e.g., 
unequal objectives or minimization of regret in order to 
extract an optimal decision [10][11]. 
The theoretical designs of fuzzy decision making [5]-[11] 
were benefited in practical applications like, e.g., medical 
decisions [12], making decisions in nutrition [13] or making 
decisions in stock market [14].  
The authors applied fuzzy decision making with the utility 
matrix to select the most efficacious treatment having an 
effect on a collection of clinical symptoms. In our proposals, 
the pair (decision, state) was interpreted as (treatment, 
symptom) [15]-[17]. The results of determining the optimal 
decision-treatment had a general nature, and were not adapted 
to the health state of a single patient.  
The decision, concerning the treatment with HBO, is 
differentiated in recommendation levels. These create a scale 
of hints, telling us, if the health condition of the patient agrees 
with the decision of giving HBO to him/her or not. For one 
decision “treatment with HBO”, we arrange a verbal 
recommendation range of stages in two families of terms, 
namely, “stages of non-indication” versus “stages of 
indication”. The conversion of these terms in two families of 
fuzzy sets with parametric membership functions is planned 
as a substantial contribution in the model proposed. The 
procedure of establishing two common formulas of parametric 
membership functions of fuzzy sets, representing “stages of 
non-indication” and “stages of indication”, should prevent us 
from determining the boundary values of fuzzy sets in an 
intuitive manner. Another task to fulfill will concern the 
introduction of fuzzy sets, assigned to symptoms. By 
cumulating the symptoms intensities, we wish to find the 
patient’s clinical characteristics. To accept the most 
convincing recommendation for HBO dosing, the cumulated

characteristics of the patient will be tested in all decision 
levels. 
We recall the classical fuzzy decision making model with 
the utility matrix in Section II. Our proposition of the one-
decision model is sketched in Section III. Section IV contains 
the descriptions of constructions of clinical entry data. The 
structure of fuzzified outcomes will be engineered in Section 
V. The case study, referring to the treatment with HBO, will 
be tested in Section VI. We will formulate some concluding 
remarks in Section VII. 
II. 
THE  MODEL OF FUZZY DECISION MAKING WITH THE 
UTILITY MATRIX 
Let us recall the definition of a fuzzy set. 
If X is a collection of objects denoted generically by x, 
then the fuzzy set A in X is a set of ordered pairs 𝐴𝐴 =
{൫𝑥𝑥, µ𝐴𝐴(𝑥𝑥)൯: 𝑥𝑥 ∈ 𝑋𝑋}, where  µ𝐴𝐴(𝑥𝑥) ∈ [0,1] [18].  
Each element x gets a membership degree µ𝐴𝐴(𝑥𝑥), which 
expresses the strength of the relationship between x and A. 
Membership degrees, equal to 1, inform about the total 
relation between the element and the set. The function 
µ𝐴𝐴: 𝑋𝑋 → [0,1] is called “the membership function” of A. 
In classical fuzzy decision making, we introduce the 
notions of a space of states (e.g., symptoms)

and a decision space (e.g., treatments)

has the entries ubj, b = 1,…,d, j = 1,…,n [5]-[9]. Each ubj is 
the fuzzy utility of applying decision db to state xj. In most of 
applications, ubj are evaluated intuitively as values belonging 
to interval [0, 1], e.g., utility of (d1,x1) = 0.7. Some users 
prefer determining the utilities as fuzzy sets, e.g., utility of 
(d1,x1) = “large”.

III. 
THE OUTLINE OF FUZZY ONE-DECISION MAKING 
Before discussing our conception of fuzzy decision 
making, let us add other useful definitions. 
The support of a fuzzy set A, supp(A), is not a fuzzy set 
(it is a crisp set) of all x ∈ X, such that  𝜇𝜇𝐴𝐴(𝑥𝑥) > 0 [18]. 
The α-cut of a fuzzy set A, Aα, is a non-fuzzy set of all x 
∈ X such that  µ𝐴𝐴(𝑥𝑥) ≥ 𝛼𝛼 [18]. 
The Euclidean distance d(P1, P2) between points P1 = 
(x1,µ(x1)) and P2 = (x2,µ(x2)), in the two dimensional system 
with x- and µ(x)-axes, is estimated as d(P1, P2) = 
ඥ(𝑥𝑥2 − 𝑥𝑥1)2 + (µ(𝑥𝑥2) − µ(𝑥𝑥1))2. 
In the current trial of fuzzy decision making, we suppose 
that set D = {d} consists of only one decision, i.e., the 
treatment with HBO. Decision d, made for patient Pi, i = 
1,…,p, is constructed as a linguistic variable, whose verbal 
values are term-sets Ll, l = 1,…,m. These terms are edited as 
recommendation levels of the treatment with HBO. The 
levels graduate indications of the treatment, scaled from the 
most contraindicated to the most advised by a physician.  
We still keep the set of symptoms 
{
nx }
x
X
1,...,
=
. 
For patient Pi, i = 1,…,p, we need to sample the 
characteristics si, informing about presence or absence of 
symptoms Xj, j = 1,…,n, in the patient. Symptoms Xj are 
typical of necrotizing fasciitis. We test the behavior of si on 
all levels Ll to select this Ll, for which the patient 
characteristics matches best. 
Let us suppose that each clinical marker Xj, j = 1,…,n, is 
replaced by a fuzzy set, also named Xj. If a marker value xi,j 
for symptom Xj is found in Pi, then the membership degree 
µ𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗)  will be assigned to xi,j. The way of designing 
membership functions µ𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗: 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 → [0,1]  will be evolved in 
Section IV. 
The importance weights wj of symptoms Xj are added to 
the formula of si to emphasize Xj’s harmful influence on the 
disease course. Due to the professional experience, the 
physician suggests the placement of Xj in the sequence 
X1...Xn, where “” means “Xj emerges more dangerous 
impact on the patient health state than Xh, j, h = 1,…,n. We 
state w1>…>wn and want  ∑
𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 = 1
𝑛𝑛
𝑗𝑗=1
. 
The collected patient characteristics si (the numerical 
knowledge about the symptoms), made via all xi,j and wj, will 
be derived for patient Pi as 
 
𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖=∑
µ𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗) ∙ 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗, 𝑖𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑝𝑝.
𝑛𝑛
𝑗𝑗=1
 
(2) 
We note that the minimal value of si is 0 since, for all 
minimal µ𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗) = 0, we obtain 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 =∑
0 ∙ 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 = 0, 𝑖𝑖 =
𝑛𝑛
𝑗𝑗=1
1, … , 𝑝𝑝. 
The maximal value of si will reach 1 if, for all maximal 
µ𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗) = 1, 𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖=∑
1 ∙ 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 = 1 ∙ ∑
𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗
𝑛𝑛
𝑗𝑗=1
= 1 ∙ 1 = 1, 𝑖𝑖 =
𝑛𝑛
𝑗𝑗=1
1, … , 𝑝𝑝.  
Hence, si ∈ [0, 1], i = 1,…,p. 
The term-sets Ll, l = 1,…,m, are designed as a collection 
of fuzzy sets, assisting recommendation levels of decision d. 
Sets Ll have their supports allocated in a common non-fuzzy 
reference set L = [0, 1] in compliance with the domain of si 
(si ∈ [0, 1]).

We prove the action of si, found in Pi, in each Ll by 
computing µ𝐿𝐿𝑙𝑙(𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖), l = 1,…,m. We adopt the optimal decision 
level Ll of d as level L*, satisfying the condition

IV. 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF ENTRY DATA 
Symptoms Xj are recognized as quantitative and 
qualitative features. We assign fuzzy sets Xj, j = 1,…,n, to 
both types. As the rising order of symptom values (real values 
or codes) is associated with the growing states of the disease 
threat then, as a consequence, the membership functions of Xj 
will be constructed as ascending functions.  
For the measurable symptoms Xj, taking values xi,j in 
interval [α, γ] continuously, we have prepared the 
membership function

We adopt the own procedure [19] to calculate the

characterized by a list of codes 
{
z}
k
C
X j
= 0,..., ,...,
, where k  
= 0,…,z, are non-negative integers. Let us assume that z is an 
even integer. The codes k mark alternative answers to a 
question, investigating the intensity of symptom Xj in Pi. We 
suppose that answer 0 denies the presence of Xj, whereas 
value z confirms Xj’s critical stage. Code value 
2
0 z
+  indicates 
the uncertain symptom status as “medium intensity”, 
“difficult to say”, and the like.  
Let us first set up a function g(k), which starts with g(0) =

function of Xj, the s function

In the last part of Section IV, let us solve the problem of 
assigning the importance weights wj to symptoms Xj. By 
“importance” we mean the strength of Xj’s adverse and 
harmful power in the running process of the illness 
diagnosed. We bring into light another own mathematical 
algorithm, allowing the estimation of weights [19]. 
Generally, if we consider n symptoms Xj to find 
importance weights for them, we will wish to arrange them 
in the sequence X1...Xn in accordance with the expert’s 
opinion. We want the sum of all weights wj, assisting Xj, j = 
1,...,n, to be 1. Therefore,

6r+5r+4r+3r+2r+r = 1 provides r = 0.0476. After employing 
(8), we receive, in turn for j = 1,…,6, the weights: w₁ = (6–

w₅ = 0.0952, and w₆= 0.0476. 
V. 
THE STRUCTURE OF FUZZIFIED OUTCOMES 
As (3) recommends, we should now generate a sample of 
output recommendation fuzzy levels Ll of decision d, l = 
1,…,m. The supports of Ll cover parts of [0, 1], as proved in 
Section III (si ∈ [0, 1]). To calculate the membership degrees 
of signal si in Ll, i = 1,…,p, we need to derive a formula of 
the membership function of each Ll. The largest value 
( )
μ
L si
l
, l = 1,..,m, points out the optimal recommendation 
level of decision d, advised for Pi. 
Theoretically, m can be either an even or an odd positive 
arbitrary integer. An own procedure [20], expanded in this 
paper, helps us to derive membership functions of Ll. These 
are dependent only on two parameters, namely, a number m 
of term-sets in a list of decision d and a width E of the 
common reference set L, containing all supports of Ll.  
In the medical problem discussed, m is supposed to be the 
even number, as the differentiation of non-indication and 
indication levels of the HBO treatment is bipartite. Our 
intention is to derive two common formulas of membership 
functions of sets Ll, separated in two families. Then, we do 
not need to predetermine the boundary values of supports of 
fuzzy sets in an intuitive or a random way. By the way, it is 
important to emphasize that the procedure can be easily 
computerized. 
Due to the definition of the α-cut set of a fuzzy set 
(introduced in Section III), we denote by Ll,α a set of si ∈ L = 
[0, 1], for which µ𝐿𝐿𝑙𝑙(𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖) ≥ 𝛼𝛼, 𝑙𝑙 = 1, … , 𝑚𝑚.

Theorem 1 
Let us suppose that term-sets Ll, l = 1,…,m, have supports 
included in the common non-fuzzy reference set L, where 
min(L) = 0. Patient characteristics si belongs to L and the 
width of L is E.  
If m is even, then we divide all fuzzy sets Ll in two 
families. A family of “left” sets L1,…,

The modifier δ(t), 0 < δ(t) ≤ 1, is inserted in (12) to cause 
narrowing effects of supports of Lt, t = 1,…, 2

Fuzzy sets L1-L4 are sketched in Figure 1. 
Section VI is devoted to tracking the theoretical proposal 
by a solution of the medical query, formulated as the 
recommendation of the treatment with HBO. The decision is 
made for a single patient. 
VI. 
THE RECOMMENDATION FOR TREATING WITH HBO 
It has already been mentioned in Section I that the 
mathematical apparatus, built in Sections III-V, will be 
applied to select either a non-indication level or an indication 
level of decision d.  
The data, including the values of crucial clinical markers, 
have been sampled for 13 patients (12 men and 1 woman) 
treated in the Blekinge County City Hospital in Karlskrona, 
Sweden, between 2006 and 2010. 
The clinical symptoms, essential in NF, have been 
introduced in Example 3. For quantitative symptoms we 
adapt (4) as follows:

TABLE I contains the clinical data and assigned to them 
membership degrees, computed in compliance with the 
membership functions of Xj. The membership degree of xi,j in

VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
By suggesting modifications in the classical fuzzy 
decision making, we have used our model to advise the 
treatment with hyperbaric oxygen. This treatment can 
improve the health state in patients, suffering from 
necrotizing fasciitis. 
Instead of designing a utility matrix filled with distinct 
utilities of pairs (decision, state), we have introduced only 
one decision, designated by the list of term-sets. These 
express recommendation levels of the treatment as non-
indications and indications. The decision levels are involved 
in the algorithm in its final phase. This differs the model, 
proposed in the current paper, from most of fuzzy decision 
making models, in which decisions are already active in the 
first stage of designing the utility matrix. It is also worth 
emphasizing that our decisions are made for individuals, and 
they have not general characters, as it often happens in other 
patterns of fuzzy decision making. 
The input data and output recommendation levels are 
fuzzified by designs of own suggestions of membership 
functions. The membership functions of the outcomes 
(recommendation levels) are sampled in two common 
formulas. The formulas depend only on a number of 
recommendation terms and the width of a reference set, 
linking all supports of recommendations. The functions are 
derived in the way, which allows entering an arbitrary 
number of recommendation levels. This extends the decision 
scale of linguistic expressions without making changes in 
formulas. 
The own procedures of estimating the importance weights 
of symptoms and approximating membership degrees of 
qualitative symptoms have also been added as contributions 
in imprecise mathematics.  
Necrotizing fasciitis is a quite rare entity, and there is no 
widespread consensus regarding neither treatment nor

grading. There were done several attempts of using 
laboratory results to facilitate grading of the severity of the 
disease, but as far as we know, they are not used widely. The 
idea of combining analysis of numerical parameters, such as 
body temperature, white blood cell count, age etc. with the 
qualitative estimations, such as, e.g., medical state, is very 
promising because it will reflect the real decision making 
progress. The model, tested above, is based on retrospective 
analysis of data of patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen 
(HBO) at the surgery department in Karlskrona, Sweden.  
We realize that the proposition of making decisions in the 
case of the HBO dosing has weaknesses, mostly, when the 
group, used to check the model, has not been very numerous. 
In spite of this, it seems that we have been successful in 
selecting essential clinical and biochemical parameters for 
the correctness of the mathematical model. The decisions 
have “softer” character than two-valued decisions “yes-no”. 
This is a result of imprecision, introduced by the overlapping 
effect of fuzzy sets. 
In the further research, we will redefine the ordering of 
importance weights of symptoms more carefully to refine the 
results. We also plan to test the model with an odd number of 
decisions levels, where the middle level ”wait and see” will 
be assigned to values about 0.5. 
Since an emphasis is laid on the design of 
recommendation levels, appearing as the output of the 
mathematical algorithm, then we can classify the model as 
robust approach to algorithmic modeling of outcomes.
