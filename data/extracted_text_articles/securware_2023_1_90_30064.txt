Abstract—With the increasing dependence on digital systems 
and the pervasive nature of cyber threats, ensuring secure 
access to information and resources has grown to be a 
crucial component of our activities online. Access control 
lists serve as foundational frameworks that govern the 
authorization and authentication processes within computer 
systems. This paper examines how access control lists can be 
employed effectively in the field of cybersecurity and digs 
into its important role in protecting sensitive 
data, 
mitigating risks, and safeguarding against unauthorized 
access. Access control lists play a vital role in ensuring the 
security and confidentiality of sensitive information and 
resources. Traditionally, access control has relied on 
predefined rules and policies to determine who has the 
eligibility in accessing which data. However, the rise of 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced new possibilities 
and challenges in the field of access control. This paper 
explores the impact of AI on access control lists, examining 
the benefits and potential concerns associated with the 
integration of AI technologies. In order to secure the 
organization’s network, we propose an AI-driven ACL 
management system which generates ACL automatically. By 
managing the network traffic with the generated ACL, the 
system supports network analysts to prioritize certain 
threats that require immediate response. By discussing the 
effectiveness of the system, we explore the possibility of AI- 
driven ACL management.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Access Control models are crucial components in the 
field of information security, ensuring that only authorized 
individuals or entities can gain entry to protected resources 
[1]. Over the years, advancements in technology shifted 
towards access control systems. One such transformation 
is the integration of AI and access control models. AI, with 
its ability to mimic human intelligence and make informed 
decisions based on a vast amount of data, can 
revolutionize the way of how access control can be 
managed which can lead to securing our networks. When 
applied, AI-powered access control models can offer 
numerous benefits over traditional rule-based systems. 
These models can have the ability to strengthen machine 
learning algorithms [7] to analyze and understand network 
traffic patterns, behaviors and contextual information to 
make real-time based access decisions. The shift from 
static rules to dynamic decision-making can lead to more 
accurate and adaptive access control mechanisms, 
strengthening security measures and reducing the risk of 
unauthorized access. One of the key advantages of AI in 
access control models is its ability to detect anomalies and 
identifying potential security threats. By analyzing 
historical data and learning from past patterns, AI 
algorithms can establish a baseline of normal behavior for 
users and systems [7]. Any deviation from this baseline 
can trigger alerts or generate preventive actions, helping in 
mitigating risks and preventing security breaches. This 
proactive approach to access control is particularly crucial 
in today's ever-evolving threat landscape, where traditional 
rule-based systems often fall in detecting sophisticated 
attacks. 
Furthermore, AI can significantly improve the user’s 
experience in access control systems. With traditional 
models, users often face heavy processes, such as 
repeatedly entering passwords or providing multiple 
credentials for different systems. 
The purpose of our paper is to propose an architecture 
that can help in increasing the organization’s network 
security when applying AI to generate countermeasures 
based on ACL rules. 
The remaining of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II presents the background which discusses the 
current problems that this paper is aiming to solve. In 
Section III, we presented our vision on solving the 
drawbacks that were discussed in the background section 
through an overflow figure. Section IV illustrates the 
benefits of AI when it is integrated with detecting 
anomalies and generating ACLs. Our architecture proposal 
is presented in section V along with a detailed description 
of its components. The architecture’s assumptions, 
challenges and limitations are explained in Section VI and 
Section VII respectively. In Section VIII discusses the 
importance of AI in generating ACLs. The discussion part 
in section IX describes how effective our proposed system 
can be if it is applied when detecting anomalies and

generating ACLs. We end our paper with a conclusion in 
section X. 
II. 
BACKGROUND 
By controlling user access and privileges, access 
control models can have a significant part in guaranteeing 
the security and integrity of digital systems. There is a 
considerable 
interest 
in 
examining 
the 
potential 
enhancement of access control systems in the light of 
significant advancements in AI. This background section 
seeks to give an overview of AI's use in the access control 
paradigm, as well as its advantages, challenges, and 
potential future applications. The goal is to obtain an 
understanding of the evolving status of AI-powered 
technology and its influence on cybersecurity by studying 
the existing literature and industry practices [8]. 
The basis for controlling users’ interactions with 
digital systems and safeguarding sensitive data is access 
control models. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and 
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) are common 
access control methods. The current Access Control List 
(ACL) system has some weaknesses even though it works 
well in many situations. 
The existing ACL mechanism has a number of 
disadvantages that are frequently encountered [13]. For 
instance, managing an ACL system can be very 
challenging. The more users, resources, and permissions 
there are, the harder it is to accurately manage and update 
ACLs. When the number of users and available resources 
considerably 
rises, 
ACL 
systems 
can 
experience 
scalability problems. The network administrator in this 
case will need to maintain a high number of access 
control entries which could affect the performance of the 
network [13]. ACL maintenance calls for constant work 
and modification. The ACL needs to be manually updated 
if the environment changes, such as when a new user 
joins a workplace or when resources are added or deleted. 
This maintenance work can get tedious, especially in 
complex systems. 
In 
traditional 
ACL-based 
systems, 
ACLs 
are 
inefficient because they only support explicitly declared 
access controls. For example, if a user has access or 
permissions that are unique because they belong to both 
the IT department and the management department, that 
level of access should be explicitly stated rather than 
inferred on belonging to both. The requirement to 
explicitly declare these access controls also has an impact 
on scalability. As the number of users, groups, and 
resources increases, so does the length of the ACL and the 
time it takes to determine how much access is granted to a 
particular user. Also, ACLs lack visibility because user 
permissions and access levels can be scattered across 
many independent lists. Auditing, modifying, or revoking 
access require testing every ACL in the organization's 
environment to apply the new permissions 
[14]. 
Therefore, we need a system that can deal with the 
previously mentioned current problems as the cyber- 
attacks are on the rise of being more sophisticated. The 
promising machine learning algorithms that are used by 
AI-based ACL can create wise access control decisions. It 
can help in dynamically determining access privileges 
which involves examining a number of variables such as 
users’ behaviors, and previous historical data [15]. This 
strategy can improve security by spotting and identifying 
anomalies. 
Managing alerts from an Intrusion Detection System 
(IDS) can be a challenging task for a network analyst. 
These difficulties include the volume of generated alerts, 
the complexity of the alerts and the need for quick and 
accurate responses. The reason is most modern IDS 
systems can generate a large number of alerts, especially 
in large and complex networks. The volume of these 
alerts can quickly overwhelm analysts, making it difficult 
to prioritize genuine threats that require immediate 
response. Our proposed system will be focusing on 
managing ACLs for analyzing suspicious traffic and for 
generating relevant countermeasures. This strategy can 
improve security by spotting anomalies and abnormal 
behaviors. Managing ACLs plays a crucial role in doing 
such tasks. By configuring ACLs properly, suspicious 
traffic can be filtered out, preventing potentially malicious 
packets from reaching critical network resources. 
Therefore, ACLs can help in identifying common attacks 
that have the ability to compromise the network. Regular 
analysis of ACLs and their effectiveness in dealing with 
suspicious traffic can lead to a continuous improvement in 
the organization’s network security posture. Managing 
ACLs is an essential part of network security because of 
its efficiency in detecting and preventing suspicious 
traffic. By analyzing ACLs and adjusting access control 
rules, network analysts can improve the security of their 
network infrastructure and protect it from potential 
threats. 
Our proposed system will be relying on machine 
learning algorithms [6] to assist our AI-based ACL to 
create wise access control decisions. This strategy can 
improve security by spotting anomalies. AI-based ACLs 
will be capable of using related data to determine access 
decisions and generate countermeasures based on the 
activities of the users and possible risks that may occur 
when an incident may happen. By considering these 
generated countermeasures, the proposed system can have 
the ability to accurately determine the risk involved with 
each access request and modify access rights 
as 
necessary. The reason behind this accuracy is due to the 
fact that AI-based ACLs can continuously learn from 
access patterns and modify their decision-making models 
as necessary. 
III. SYSTEM OVERFLOW 
We propose a dynamic AI based Access Control system 
for solving the problems which are explained in Section 2.

Our system involves the integration of AI and generating 
ACL for improving the network structure in dealing with 
suspicious traffic analysis [5]. This can lead to generate 
an efficient countermeasure against future similar attacks. 
Figure 1 shows an overview of our proposed architecture, 
it consists of five phases which work in a sequential step- 
by-step order. We will describe details of each phase 
below. 
 
Figure.1 Proposed System Overflow 
 
A. Data Collection 
This is the first phase, in which the collection of 
several attributes of data is required [9]. To be specific, 
we will be focusing on five attributes. These attributes 
have an edge over other candidates due to their particular 
concentration on certain aspects of network security. 
Organizations can improve their capability to identify, 
address, and avoid security issues by gathering and 
analyzing data from these sources. 
These attributes include network traffic (which is all 
the network traffic data that is observed in the 
organization’s network e.g., source IP-address and 
destination IP-address, protocol, source port, destination 
port). The second attribute is the firewall access logs 
(which are obtained and stored in the firewall e.g., rule 
numbers, protocols that have been used and the action that 
is taken by the firewall). The third attribute is the network 
access logs, (which includes the permissions of allowing 
or denying users from accessing the network e.g., the user 
name, connection type and connection duration). Then, 
we have the fourth attribute which is the resource access 
logs (that determine which resource are allowed or denied 
for specific users to access with its timestamp e.g., 
accessing a financial report by a specific user in 3:00 
PM). The final attribute is the applied network ACL that 
already existed in the system, e.g., source IP-address, 
destination IP-address, protocol, source port, destination 
port, and the action that has been taken for that rule. 
These attributes vary depending on the product and 
configuration, but are basically above formats. 
These attributes are all required for the next anomaly 
detection phase [3]. 
B. Anomaly Detection 
In this phase, the collected data in phase one will be the 
input to several anomaly detection 
methods 
[4]. 
Currently, a lot of anomaly detection methods exist. With 
such existing methods, we can detect anomaly behavior 
from the collected data in phase one. As a typical example, 
we will consider IDS in detecting anomaly traffic from 
the network traffic data. Moreover, the applied network 
ACL and access logs can be used in detecting suspicious 
activities that are out of the authorized scope access of the 
network. We chose IDS in our case because it can be 
adapted to fit into several security configurations and to 
the needs of organizations as well as its effectiveness 
when combining it with machine learning methods [7]. 
They can adjust to various network and system designs 
because of their flexibility. By inputting these data to AI, 
it can help in deciding whether the unauthorized activity 
is due to a user’s fault or if it is a suspicious access 
attempt. 
C. ACL Management 
In the first and second phases, we used the existing 
techniques. The third phase is where AI will be applied by 
controlling ACL configurations to keep track 
of 
suspicious activities. Generally, this phase is the core of 
our architecture and is responsible for managing access 
rules and access policies. It will also be used to examine 
historical access logs and permissions data to identify 
patterns and their relationships. It is important to mention 
that the patterns and security criteria that are found here 
will introduce optimization algorithms or reinforcement 
learning approaches to enhance the ACL policy for later 
effective countermeasures. This will help in adjusting the 
ACL rules to make the network more efficient and secure. 
D. Analysis 
In this phase, the network analyst will evaluate the alert 
outcomes from the detected anomalies (in the second 
phase) and from the alerts that are generated from the 
ACL management (the third phase) to obtain a 
comprehensive understanding of the system security 
posture [5]. This posture analysis will be the input for the 
final countermeasures phase. 
E. Countermeasures 
After the analyst’s evaluation, the countermeasure phase 
with the help of AI will estimate the seriousness and 
potential consequences of the detected alerts based on the 
analysis result. 
IV. 
THE AI MERGING OF ANOMALY DETECTION AND 
GENERATING ACCESS CONTROL LISTS 
AI helps in access control list (ACL) merging with 
anomaly identification. ACLs are used to restrict access to 
54

resources and systems based on predefined rules, whereas 
anomaly detection focuses on spotting patterns or 
behaviors that dramatically depart from the norm [2]. By 
employing machine learning algorithms [7] to analyze 
massive volumes of data and spot strange patterns and 
behaviors, AI can enhance anomaly detection [6]. 
An AI model may learn what is considered typical 
behavior and recognize variations that may reveal 
potential security issues or anomalies by being trained on 
previous data samples. Identifying unauthorized access 
attempts and odd system activities will be easier for the 
network analyst for examining the network’s security 
position. AI can assist in automating the management and 
enforcement of access restrictions in the context of access 
control lists. AI algorithms are able to decide what 
permissions are appropriate for certain users or groups of 
users by examining user behavior and previous access 
patterns [5]. This will also simplify the management of 
ACLs [11], particularly in complicated systems with lots 
of users and resources. Access control lists and anomaly 
detection can be used to offer a more complete security 
solution. AI system’s detection of anomalous behavior 
may result in updates to access control lists (ACLs) to 
restrict access or notifications for further enquiry. By 
dynamically modifying permissions based on in-the- 
moment abnormalities, this integration makes it possible 
to take a preventative approach to security, lowering the 
likelihood of unauthorized access and malicious activities. 
Overall, AI can enhance security posture, automate 
procedures, and increase the effectiveness of permission 
management in complicated systems by combining 
anomaly detection and access control lists. 
work properly. Moreover, it will validate the accuracy and 
effectiveness when they will be examined by a network 
analyst. 
This 
iterative 
process 
helps 
refine 
the 
architecture's performance and will enhance the overall 
system’s output. The proposal of our architecture is as 
follows. 
When matching the discussed overflow in Figure 1 
with the system proposed in Figure 2, we will notice that 
the architecture is emphasizing on generating an AI-based 
ACL rules (phase 3) depending on the alerts form the 
Intrusion Detection System IDS (phase 2). The analysist 
(phase 4) will be responsible for monitoring the results of 
the IDS (phase 2) and regulating the countermeasures 
(phase 5) when examining the system. Our architecture’s 
components are presented in Figure 2. 
A. Data Processing 
In this step, the preparation of data will be managed to 
distinguish the data to two types of alerts: old and new 
alerts. The old alert refers to the alerts that are initially 
coming from the IDS; while the new alert refers to the 
alerts that is coming from IDS after applying AI to the 
managed ACL. In other words, the system will receive 
concerning alerts previously due to the fact of being IDS 
always 
analyzing 
the 
traffic 
and 
sending 
alerts 
accordingly. Therefore, the input data is a combination of 
both types of alerts (old and new). 
B. Existing ACL 
We mean by this a dataset of existing ACLs. These data 
sets will contain examples of input queries and 
descriptions along with their corresponding ACL rules. It 
 
 
 
 
 
V. PROPOSED ARCHITECTURE 
Figure 2. Proposed System 
is worth mentioning that these datasets should cover a 
wide range of scenarios to train the module effectively. 
Before presenting our proposed system in this section, 
it is important to mention the idea of iteration. Our system 
is based on the alerts and the generated ACL rules that 
will be the fundamental concept behind our architecture to 
C. ACL Management Training 
In here, the AI system will be adjusted to our processed 
dataset. The adjustment involves training our module on 
55

SECURWARE 2023 : The Seventeenth International Conference on Emerging Security Information, Systems and Technologies

the ACL rules to make it more knowledgeable and better 
at generating relevant ACLs. Some machine learning 
approaches are needed to train the model at this stage. 
D. Integration 
This step is the result of the combination between the 
existing ACL and the ACL management training unit. 
The integration will be beneficial for well training the 
system to new rules and as a result adapting to newly 
upcoming permissions. This will also help in optimizing 
the system’s countermeasures. 
E. Network Equipment Deployer 
The countermeasures (phase 5) that were generated by 
the alerts of the IDS will be shared with the results of the 
newly integrated AI-ACL rules. The deployment process 
will help in generating flexible ACL rules that will be 
able to deal up with changes that may occur to the 
network. 
F. IDS 
Intrusion Detection Systems will include analyzing 
patterns and behaviors within our system to identify 
abnormalities from the norm. It will generate alerts when 
detecting unusual or suspicious actions. These alerts are 
usually based on pattern recognition techniques but as 
within our system it will be enhanced with the machine 
learning approach [6]. In our system, the IDS will be 
generating alerts when it finds activities that fall outside 
the predefined threshold. 
G. Countermeasure 
The role of countermeasures in our case is to respond 
to the alerts that the network analyst handles to prevent or 
mitigate the identified threats. These responses may 
include blocking malicious IP addresses, modifying 
firewall rules and notifying the network analyst about 
potential threats. 
VI. 
ASSUMPTIONS 
There 
are 
several 
assumptions 
to 
take 
into 
consideration when implementing such a system. It is 
expected that plenty of data will be available to train the 
AI model for both access control lists and the detected 
anomalies. To create precise models and comprehend 
typical patterns and behaviors, we will need enough data 
samples to begin with. 
Our system in which the AI model will be deployed is 
presumed to be represented by the data used to train the 
AI model. This presumption guarantees that the model 
can accurately identify anomalies and decide what the 
best access control measures are based on actual 
circumstances. A precise definition of anomalies is 
necessary 
[3]. 
The 
system 
must 
have 
a 
clear 
understanding of what defines an anomaly. This definition 
could change depending on the system’s situation. 
Therefore, it is crucial to have clear standards for spotting 
unusual patterns or behaviors. 
Access control policies must be in place before AI can 
be integrated into access control lists. These regulations 
specify who has access to what resources and how. Rules 
governing 
access 
levels 
(network 
administrators), 
responsibilities (managing alerts), permissions (allowing), 
and restrictions (denying) are examples of prerequisites 
that are needed. In real-time applications, AI systems 
should be scalable to handle any data volumes as well as 
to the amount of access control requests. We mean by this 
that traditional anomaly detection methods may struggle 
with complicated data to handle effectively. To find 
abnormalities and decide on access restrictions without 
noticeably affecting performance of the system, our 
system has to be able to process and analyze data 
effectively. 
AI systems are expected to be able to continuously 
learn from and modify their behavior to match changing 
patterns and trends. To enable efficient anomaly detection 
and access control, The system should be able to update 
models based on new data and to modify access control 
policies accordingly. 
VII. CHALLNEGES AND CONSIDERATIONS 
The quality and accessibility of the data used for the 
training purposes have a significant impact on how 
effective our AI systems will be. To identify deviations 
from typical patterns and impose the proper access rules, 
anomaly detection and access control systems need 
thorough and precise data. 
The threat landscape is also rapidly changing, with new 
attack vectors appearing frequently. In order for models to 
continuously learn and update for countering new threats, 
our AI system design must be flexible. It is crucial to 
routinely update anomaly detection and access control 
systems based on newly fresh updated information to 
retain efficacy [12]. 
False positives and false negatives are also possible [3]. 
Systems for detecting anomalies can produce false 
positives (which misinterpret typical behavior as 
abnormal) and false negatives (which fail to detect actual 
anomalies). It is crucial to strike a balance between these 
two types of errors in order to prevent unneeded 
disruptions and potential security breaches. Adjusting the 
thresholds and the AI model are both necessary to 
minimize any likelihood of errors. 
Techniques for adversary strength, such as adversary 
training and input validation, should be taken into 
consideration to make the AI system more resistant to 
such attacks [10]. These difficulties and factors are 
highlighting the complexity in implementing access 
control lists, anomaly detection, and AI into one system 
architecture. Carefully addressing these issues will assist 
in creating a strong and reliable security framework.

VIII. IMPROVING ACCESS CONTROL LISTS WITH AI 
As was stated in our proposal, we can utilize AI to 
examine patterns and behavior to spot anomalies in 
network access requests. AI systems can identify 
suspicious or suspicious access attempts and send 
notifications and take preventive measures by learning the 
typical behavior of users [7]. AI can be used to 
dynamically modify access control policies depending on 
current information and circumstances. AI algorithms are 
able to intelligently decide whether to give or refuse 
access in a more precise and context-aware manner by 
considering specific user behavior, device attributes, 
network information, and other related aspects. 
ACL rules can be improved over time by AI algorithms 
that continuously learn from access patterns and security 
events. This adaptive learning strategy [7] can help in the 
evolution of ACLs to block unauthorized access more 
successfully while lowering false positives. AI algorithms 
can analyze large volumes of data related to user 
behavior, network traffic, and system logs to identify 
patterns, anomalies, and potential security risks [8]. This 
analysis helps in understanding the access requirements 
and potential threats [5], forming the basis for ACL 
generation. 
Based on historical data and specified risk models, AI 
algorithms can evaluate the risk related to granting or 
rejecting particular rights. By taking into 
account 
elements like the user's role and potential vulnerabilities, 
AI systems can provide access control policies that reduce 
security risks. 
Network traffic, user behavior, and security events will 
be continuously monitored by AI, which may see changes 
and emerging patterns that can call for ACL adjustments 
[11]. By constantly modifying ACLs based on current 
findings, AI systems contribute to the maintenance of an 
efficient and up-to-date access control architecture. 
AI classifies various kinds of network traffic and user 
behaviors using machine learning algorithms. AI systems 
can create ACL rules that permit or limit access based on 
particular categories or traits by comprehending these 
classifications. 
IX. DISCUSSION 
Anomaly detection systems and access control lists 
(ACLs) are fundamental components for protecting 
computer networks from unauthorized access 
and 
potential threats. An IDS is designed to monitor network 
traffic and generate alerts when suspicious or malicious 
activity is detected. AI-based ACLs, on the other hand, 
use AI techniques to automatically manage and enforce 
access control policies. Combining AI algorithms for IDS 
(Intrusion Detection System) alerts with ACL (Access 
Control List) alerts provides a more complete and 
intelligent approach to threat detection and response will 
improve the organization’s network security. 
Anomaly detection systems are designed to monitor 
network traffic and detect potential security breaches and 
malicious activity [2]. It will be used in generating alerts 
when suspect behavior or patterns are detected. ACLs, on 
the other hand, are used to regulate access to network 
resources by creating rules that permit or deny traffic 
based on predetermined criteria. By combining the AI 
algorithms of IDS alerts and ACL Alerts, 
the 
organizations can harness the power of machine learning 
and sophisticated analytics to evaluate, classify, and take 
appropriate actions of incoming alerts. 
X. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
By leveraging the capabilities of AI in conjunction with 
anomaly detection and access control lists, organizations 
can achieve proactive threat detection, adaptive access 
control policies, and efficient countermeasure generation. 
This paper presented an architecture for managing ACLs 
for analyzing suspicious traffic and for generating 
relevant countermeasures. We believe that this will help 
in creating wise access control decisions by adopting an 
AI-based ACL. This will help in predicting possible risks 
that may occur before an incident happen. This research 
highlights the potential benefits and challenges associated 
with integrating AI into security systems, along with 
implementation strategies and performance evaluation 
metrics. It emphasizes the importance of continually 
updating and refining AI models to stay ahead of 
emerging security threats, ultimately strengthening the 
overall security posture of various domains. Moreover, 
this will help network analysts in identifying alerts 
efficiently. In our future work, we will be focusing on 
managing how ACL can be adapted based on anomalies 
and policies to create a more secure environment.
