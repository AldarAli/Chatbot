Abstract—There are major challenges in establishing effective
communications between nodes in vehicular ad hoc networks
(VANETs) that are subject to disconnections, hinder end-to-
end source and target connection. Another problem arises when
VANETs are sparse, whereby communication between vehicles
occurs after long periods of time causing delays. In these
environments, traditional routing protocols proposed for VANETs
suffer holding continuous connection and performance problems.
To overcome these problems, Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN)
for Interplanetary Networks (IPN) routing protocols, which
encourages applications to use a minimized number of round
trips are considered suitable alternatives. They are designed for
storing and forwarding messages when nodes can ﬁnd other nodes
to maintain end-to-end connections. In our previous work, we
proposed a routing protocol VDTN-ToD based on DTN which
uses a metric Trend of Delivery (ToD) scheme to assist in its
routing and forwarding decisions. In our current work, we use
this metric in order to provide better performance for DTN
routing protocols Spray-And-Wait and PROPHET in VANETs.
The results show that the inclusion of ToD in VANETs allows
signiﬁcant performance improvements and it can also be used in
many other routing protocols to overcome performance issues.

I. INTRODUCTION
The TCP/IP architecture is largely robust to deal with
infrastructure networks, where a disconnection is improbable
and the end-to-end path between two source/destination nodes
hardly broken. This feature changes in a Mobile Ad Hoc
Network (MANET) environment, where nodes are mobile and
are operating in relative disconnected mode. In such conditions
the TCP has its performance degraded [1]. Such a problem gets
even harder when we imagine a scenario where the network
is sparse and the nodes cannot mount and continuously retain
an end-to-end route, which is what also happens in VANETs.
In VANETs with these problematic conditions the use of
DTN architecture [2] (primarily designed for IPN routing
protocols which can withstand huge delays, connections dis-
ruptions and minimizes the number of roundtrips response
conﬁrmation) is considered and proposed as a suitable alterna-
tive. DTN is also applicable in all other types of mobile net-
works such as cellular and wireless sensor networks. In these
scenarios it is necessary to develop new protocols which know
how to take advantage of the DTN paradigm. Particularly, the
so-called Store-carry and Forward with random or controlled
movement of mobile nodes called ferries are looked for. This
allows the preamble information for connecting and routing to
be in a single packet as a complete data packet, which permits
the node to retain for a long time until delivery to the next
participating node is successful.
Some DTN protocols are: Spray-And-Wait [3], PROPHET
[4] Epidemic [5] and MaxProp [6]. However, they do not con-
sider the speciﬁc restrictions of VANETs. Some protocols for
VANETs that have been proposed based on the technique DTN
are: VDTN-ToD [7], FFRDV [8], VADD [9], and GeOpps
[10].
In our previous work [7], we proposed a routing protocol
VDTN-ToD which uses a metric called Trend of Delivery
(ToD) mechanism to assist in its routing and forwarding deci-
sions. In this our current work, the ToD is inserted in Spray-
And-Wait, MaxProp and PROPHET protocols; thus they take
into account features that are speciﬁc to VANETs. The results
show a considerable improvement in their performance in a
VANET environment. For this, all protocols were developed
for simulation in Network Simulator 3 (NS3) [11], in this
article the comparisons are based on Spray-And-Wait and
PROPHET protocols.
The other sections in this paper are organized as follows:
Section 2 presents related work, Section 3 describes the
theoretical basis with a brief overview of DTN, its architecture
and routing as well as the ToD mechanism. Section 4 describes
how the ToD has been incorporated into Spray-And-Wait
and PROPHET protocols. Section 5 shows and describes
the scenarios used together with the results from our work.
Finally, in Section 6, we conclude the work and present some
suggestions for future research work.

tion; therefore, DTN routing protocols have been designed for

vehicular scenarios, some are reported below.
The VDTN-ToD [7] uses the metric Trend of Delivery
(ToD) to assist in routing decisions to allow a particular
network node to decide when it is best to keep, forward
or copy a packet, taking into account improvements in the
delivery rates and decrease in the message delays. The VDTN-
ToD also uses a scheme of disclosure and maintenance of
location messages based on the concept of Adaptive Coverage
Detection (ACD), which takes into account the transmission
range, to reduce the number of update messages with their
location details given by the nodes.
Yu and Ko [8] proposed the VANET/DTN protocol called
Fastest-Ferry Routing in DTN-enabled Vehicular Ad Hoc
Networks (FFRDV). It works speciﬁcally in motor-highway
scenarios. It divides the highway into blocks and within them
it decides to which vehicle as a relay node it will forward
the packet, based on the vehicle speed. The ToD that we
incorporated into the DTN routing protocols in our work
reported in this paper also uses the speed factor to assist in
the routing decisions, but we go one step further taking into
account the angle between the vehicle and the distance to the
target node.
Zhao and Cao in [9] proposed the protocol Vehicle-Assisted
Data Delivery in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VADD) that
uses a digital map to obtain the maximum speed, the vehicle
density and intersection places. Based on this information,
it uses a metric called expected delay for delivery to make
routing decisions when one arrives at an intersection/junction.
When it is not at an intersection it typically works like Greedy
Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) [12]. The VADD does not
perform packet replication, but forwarding, and furthermore
the target nodes are ﬁxed in the proposed application. In
our proposed scheme in the ToD protocols reported in this
paper, we go one step further to ensure knowing each target’s
geolocation of the vehicle nodes, which are e evaluated on
their mobility.
Another VANET/DTN protocol that uses metrics for its
routing decisions is the Geographical Opportunistic Routing
for Vehicular Networks (GeOpps) [10], which is obtained with
the aid of a navigation system that makes a node to know
the routes of its neighbors in it vicinity range. Since the
navigation system indicates which way the neighbors will take
(based on their source-to-destination route selection), suggest
that GeOpps may achieve more optimum routing than in other
protocols with ToD. However, this scheme may expose user
security and privacy that could be used by criminals and other
agencies for the wrong reasons. Protocols with ToD have
the advantage of requiring less information from the VANET
environment. Another proposal GeoSpray [13], which is a
combination of GeOpps with Spray-And-Wait extends .
In our research work reported in this paper, the ToD
mechanism has been incorporated in the Spray-And-Wait and
PROPHET protocols to determine and compare their respec-
tive performances in a VANET environment.
III. THEORETICAL BASIS
A. Delay Tolerant Networks
Initially in the 90s, IPN project was developed aimed to
deﬁne the architecture for land interoperability internet with
an interplanetary one. It was reported that the solutions used
in IPN could also work for terrestrial networks that faced
problems of disconnections and disruptions [14].
The DTN architecture uses the strategy called Store-carry
and Forward, in which the ﬁrst packet as a package is fully
received at an intermediate node, then it stores the packet and
carry (forward) it until it reaches its target destination.
The packet may be stored for hours or even days, depending
on the life time set for the packet. This functionality is placed
in a new layer called Layer Bundle [15], which is located
below the application layer and above the transport layer.
The DTN applications generate messages of different size
called bundles and they are processed, stored and forwarded
in DTN nodes.
B. DTN Routing
The traditional routing protocols for networks on Earth as-
sume that they establish an optimum end-to-end path between
source and target according to some metric, such as number
of nodal hops. In DTN, the concept is to establish a journey
so that the bundle reaches its target by taking the maximum
advantage of possible contacts (opportunity to send data) that
occur with the nodes to maximize the delivery rate as quickly
as possible, because there is no guarantee that a particular
bundle enroute through the network will reach its destination.
The protocol also has to manage the use of storage space of
nodes, since in some schemes, such as epidemic routing, it can
quickly ﬁll the buffers of these devices. Another important
metric is the delay metric to ensure that the protocol can
deliver bundles to the target as fast as possible.
C. Trend of Delivery (ToD) Mechanism
The value of ToD is achieved through the use of fuzzy
logic from soft computing that seeks to discover through the
mobility of nodes how good that node is to forward or copy a
packet. The ToD is based on three variables: direction (ωi,d),
distance (Ψi,d) and speed (τi,d), where i is the node with the
message and d is the ﬁnal destination of the message.
The direction indicates how close the direction from i to
d is, thus a θ angle formed between the direction vector −→u
indicating the direction of vector i and facing the recipient −→v
is calculated, so the angle between them indicates how good
or bad the value (ωi,d) is. The associated values are great,
good, bad and awful.
For distance, four values are considered: very close, close,
far and very far; each of them is achieved by the value of the
transmission range of the vehicles as nodes.
In the case of the speed, four values are considered: low,
medium and high, which indicates how fast the vehicle as a
node travelling.
With the values of the variables (ωi,d), (Ψi,d) and (τi,d),
the value of ToD is set in seven parameter values: maximum

(MA), great (GR), very good (VG), good (GO), bad (BA),
very bad (VB) and awful (AW).
IV. TOD APPLIED TO PROTOCOLS
A. ToD Applied to Spray-And-Wait
The idea used to implement ToD in the Spray-And-Wait
protocol to limit the number L of copies, thus the ToD is
applied to assist to choose the L copies; whereas in Spray-
And-Wait, these copies are spread to the ﬁrst neighbors found
in their immediate vicinity. The pseudo-code below shows how
the decision is made:
/*
* Consider j as being the best
* neighbor of i, ie neighbor with
* best ToD for the bundle m chosen
* ALPHA 0.05
*/
if (node is source && L(i) > 1) {
L(i) = L(i) / 2;
L(j) = L(i);
i copies the bundle m to j;
}
else if (val(ToD (i, m)) + ALPHA
<= val(ToD(j, m))) {
if ([(Tod(j, m)] is subset of
[Maximum, Great, Very Good]) {
i forwards the bundle m to j;
}
else if (L(i) > 1) {
L(i) = L(i) / 2;
i copies the bundle m to j;
}
else {
i keeps the bundle m;
}
}
else {
i keeps the bundle m;
}
It can be observed that before making decisions based on
ToD, we check whether the node i is the source node, in
which case it always copies directly to j (where the bundle
is still L > 1 ). This decision is taken due to the possibility
of having ﬁxed source nodes in some VANET scenarios. In
which case, whenever it has the opportunity it spreads the
bundle to its best neighbor. We also see in the pseudo code
that routing decisions are different when compared to VDTN-
ToD. Since the α constant indicates the minimum difference
that j must have to node i. This decision is made in order
to have the best selection of neighbors, since they may show
values even greater of ToDs. When the ToD node j is greater
than the node i with a difference greater than or equal to
alpha another check is performed, which examines whether j
has a ToD that is subset of [Maximum, Great, Very Good].
When this occurs, the bundle is transferred to j, since it has a
high chance of ﬁnding the destination, thus avoiding spreading
unnecessary copies in the network. Moreover, the bundles are
transferred even when L = 1, allowing the spread to take place
successfully. If the ToD of j is not a subset of [Maximum,
Great, Very Good], the bundle is copied, dividing the number
of copies with the two nodes. In any other case the bundle is
maintained at node i.
When a node contacts another node, each one has a list of
bundles and must choose the order in which bundles should be
sent, thus three mechanisms were chosen. The ﬁrst works with
First in First out (FIFO), in the second approach, the sequence
is established based on the value of L, so the ﬁrst bundles are
those with the highest values of L, aiming to prioritize those
bundles that were less spread. The third mechanism is the same
as that used in VDTN-ToD; in this case, the bundle selection
is based on its ToD.
For this work we evaluated the behavior of 4 versions
for Spray-And-Wait, as follows: Spray-And-Wait original
version using FIFO, Spray-And-Wait V1 original version
using queue approach based in the number of copies of L,
TrendOfSpray version with trend of delivery using the same
approach queue V1 and TrendOfSpray 2 version with trend
of delivery using the same approach as VDTN-ToD queue.
B. ToD Applied to PROPHET
PROPHET has its own routing strategy which is based on
nodal encounter history. Hence, we applied the ToD strategy
associated with the PROPHET strategy. Two approaches called
PROPHETorToD and PROPHET+ToD were created.
The ﬁrst works by performing an “or” between the two
strategies when a bundle (chosen from the top of the queue)
is ready for forwarding when it meets the sending conditions
of the PROPHET protocol. If the protocol does not authorize
the sending, then it goes to the strategy based on VDTN-ToD.
This approach is shown in the pseudo code below:
/* Given the bundle m, that i
* need to send to the destination
* d and i have a set of n neighbors
* P(k, d) -> Probability of node k
* find the node d
*/
best_neighbor =
neighbor_with_best((P(k, d));
if ( P(best_neighbor, d) >
P(i, d)) {
i copies the bundle to
the best_neighbor;
}
else {
i transfers the bundle queue
to strategy of VDTN-ToD;
}
In the second approach, the ﬁrst bundle is always chosen;
thus seeking the neighbor j that adds the greater delivery
probability value added to ToD according to the pseudo-code
below:
/* Given the bundle m, that i
* need to send to the destination
* d and i have a set of n neighbors
*/

for each k that is a neighbor of i
j = neighbor with highest sum
of ToD(k, m) + P(k, d)
sum_j = val(ToD(j, m)) + P(j, d);
sum_i = val(ToD(i, m)) + P(i, d);
if (sum_j > sum_i) {
i forwards the bundle m to j;
}
else if (val(ToD(j, m)) >= val(ToD(i, m))
|| P(j, d) >= P(i, d)) {
i copies the bundle m to j;
}
else {
i keeps the bundle m;
}
V. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
A. Scenarios Description
For the experiments, two scenarios developed in Simulation
of Urban Mobility (SUMO) [16] were prepared and the
behavior of the protocols in two different scenario applications
in a VANET environment was evaluated as follows.
1) Scenario 1: The ﬁrst scenario is shown in Figure 1.
This simpler scenario was used to evaluate a type of VANET
application in which there are ﬁve nodes exchanging messages
among them in the form a chats between vehicles or ﬁles
exchanges.

All vehicles are randomly generated at the scenario edges

value of L for Spray-And-Wait is according to Equation 1
L = (N ∗ 0.1) + 1

where N is the number of network nodes, whose value is
approximately 10% as suggested in [3]. For PROPHET values
are PINIT = 0.5, γ = 0.98 and β = 0.25. Other details of the
scenario are shown in Table I.

the previous work [7], as shown in Figure 2. In this scenario,

is the similarly to scenario 1: the vehicles are generated at

simulation. Moreover, all the tracks have four lanes (two each
direction).

B. Metrics
Several studies suggest which metrics should be used to
evaluate the performance of a DTN routing protocol. The

three metrics are suggested, Delivery Rate, Average Delay,
and Overhead [7] [17]. The calculations of these metrics are
the same as reported in our previous work [7].
C. Analysis of ToD applied to Spray-and-Wait
We begin the analysis with the ﬁrst scenario, where the
VANET environment is also simpler.

Spray-And-Wait - Graphics of delivery rate and overhead for scenario
1
By evaluating the results in Figure 4, it can be observed
that there was a slight improvement over TrendOfSpray when
there was an increase in the number of vehicles, it achieved
greater delivery rates, and thus keeping the overhead low. Only
in once instance it achievd lower improvment to V1. Figure
5 shows a lower average delay for TrendOfSpray in all cases.
These results come from a better choice of L copies that are
spread associated with the strategy of the queue based on the
value of L. Hence, the overhead is more controlled, since a
bundle is only spread to a neighbor with a higher ToD. The
bundles with these smart copies of information, tend to reach
the destination faster, thus keeping the average delay lower.
According to the results (Figures 6 and 7), it can be
observed that both TrendOfSprays had delivery rates below
the two versions of the Spray-And-Wait. This is due to
the scenario being more complex, where the guarantee that
a bundle reach its target is very low. In the case of the
two TrendOfSpray approaches, several bundles are retained
because the neighbor does not have a higher ToD, but it is
possible that it ﬁnds its target late, since the environment is
much more sparse, allowing the protocol to spread more copies
speedily, hence the possibility of ﬁnding the target is greater.
So, in this case the delivery rate versions of Spray-And-Wait

are higher, becasue they only retain bundles when L = 1. The
low overhead of TrendOfSpray approaches are reﬂections of
bundles that are retained. Regarding the average delay, the
versions of TrendOfSpray showed higher values, since they
take longer to spread the bundles to network.
The TrendOfSpray (version 1) provides better results for
scenario 1, keeping good delivery rates, low overhead, as well
as achieving shorter delay than the two versions of Spray-
And-Wait. However, in scenario 2, it did not achieve better
results due to the bundles not spreading widely. A possible
improvement could be to try to calibrate a better value for α;
for instance, it can be 0, making the bundles to achieve more
spreading in the network.
D. Analysis of ToD applied to PROPHET
From the analysis, it is important to know that PROPHET
suffer more difﬁculties in a VANET environment of scenario

2, because it depends on a history of reencounters [7], since
the bundles are forwarded only when there are reencounters or
when the transitivity case occurs. This is made more difﬁcult
because both source and target nodes are ﬁxed.

By observing Figure 8, it can be noticed that PROPHETor-
ToD achieves superior delivery rates than others, with the vari-
able overhead in relation to PROPHET (sometimes gaining,
sometimes losing). The gain was due to greater probability to
spread the bundles, allowing PROPHETorToD to spread the
copies even if the metric PROPHET did not authorize it. in
this case, with VDTN-ToD approving, with this the overhead
was well controlled. For the case of PROPHET+ToD, it kept
a delivery rate similarly to PROPHET, but with much lower
overhead. This is due to PROPHET+ToD uses two metrics
to better help their routing decisions. From Figure 9 it can
be seen that compared to average delay, the PROPHET+ToD

and PROPHETorToD showed a better performance since more
bundles are spread using the two metrics ToD and delivery
predictable. So, on the average, the bundle arrives at their
target faster with greater regularity.
Observing the results shown in Figure 10, the PROPHET
achieves much lower performance. In this scenario, both
PROPHET and PROPHETorToD retain more bundles, making
the PROPHET+ToD to achive a higher delivery rate. In the
case of PROPHETorToD, it suffers from the problem of the
bundles being retained longer in ﬁxed source node (since in
this case it retains the bundles due to PROPHET and VTDN-
ToD not authorizing forwarding or copying), which hinders the
possibility of the bundle arriving speedily at its target. With
more retained bundles, the PROPHETorToD and PROPHET
have lower overheads.

conditions of scenario 2 the PROPHET+ToD achieve a better
value for average delay, since the bundles spread faster.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The proposed mechanism, called ToD, has succeeded in im-
proving the performance of traditional DTN algorithms when
they are applied in VANET environment. This mechanism has
been also tested with the MaxProp routing protocol, and it will
be reported in another follow-up paper.
The Spray-And-Wait and PROPHET protocols, using the
ToD, had a signiﬁcant improvement in the evaluated metrics.
In the case of Spray-And-Wait, this result was expected, since
it does not use any criteria for the scattering of bundles. For
PROPHET, the ToD expanded the possibility of spreading the
bundles, which was depended solely on historical encounters.
As future work, we consider implementing VADD and
GeOpps protocols in NS3, incorporating the ToD mechanism
and compare them to VDTN-ToD to perform more compre-
hensive evaluation.
