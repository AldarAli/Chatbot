Abstract—This 
work 
elaborates 
on 
the 
real-time 
implementation and comparative evaluation of an Energy-
efficient scheme for sharing resources using the MICA2dot 
wireless nodes/motes. The proposed scheme allows the nodes 
to sleep adaptively according to the volume of incoming 
traffic, offering Energy Conservation (EC) to the moving 
nodes. Nodes that are exchanging delay sensitive/constrained 
resources apply the one-level Backward Traffic Difference 
(BTD) scheme or the two-level BTD, according to delay 
transmission and capacity criteria, in order to enable nodes 
to sleep, based on their activity and their admitted traffic. 
The incoming traffic impacts the Sleep-time duration of the 
node by using traffic’s backward difference in order to 
define an adaptive Sleep-time duration for each node. The 
proposed scheme is being evaluated through real-time 
implementation by using MICA2dot wireless motes, which 
are exchanging resources in a Mobile Peer-to-Peer manner 
using certain motion pattern. Performance evaluation and 
the extracted results validate the scheme’s efficiency for 
minimizing the Energy Consumption in real-time. In 
addition, comparative performance evaluations with other 
similar schemes show the efficiency of the proposed research 
approach. The framework of this paper maximizes further 
the efficiency and reliability of the resource exchange 
process of the nodes, while it minimizes the Energy 
consumption.

 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, the number of wireless network 
deployments 
for 
real-time 
applications, 
including 
individual and global industrial applications, has rapidly 
increased. As a variety of device-dependent applications 
were born, the necessity for developing a scheme for 
conserving energy becomes even more timely. Wireless 
nodes communicate over error-prone wireless channels 
with limited battery power, vulnerable reliability and 
through deployed energy-hungry applications. These 
characteristics of wireless nodes make the design of 
resource exchange schemes challenging. However, with 
mobility many inherent problems follow such as the 
resource scarceness, finite energy for the wireless nodes 
and low connectivity whereas, mobile nodes demand high 
levels of responsiveness that in turn, demand resource 
intensive computing resources. Wireless devices in order 
to conserve energy switch their states between Sleep 
mode, Wake mode and idle mode. This is reflected to the 
responsiveness of the underlying applications and 
processes hosted by these devices, which are reduced 
significantly. These devices, while being in the process of 
sharing resources, face temporary and unannounced loss of 
network connectivity as they move whereas, they are 
usually engaged in rather short connection sessions since 
they need to discover other hosts in an ad-hoc manner. 
Due to wireless resources’ scarceness, in most cases the 
requested resources claimed by these devices, may not be 
available. Therefore, a mechanism that faces the 
intermittent connectivity problem and enables the devices 
to react to frequent changes in the environment, while it 
enables energy conservation in regards to the requested 
traversed traffic, is of great need. This mechanism will 
positively affect the end-to-end reliability, facing the 
unavailability and the scarceness of wireless resources.  
This work elaborates on the capabilities of the 
backward estimation model for extracting the time-
oriented differential traffic, in contrast to the nodal 
characteristics of the wireless device in time. The 
proposed work exploits the model proposed in [1] and 
utilizes 
the 
resource 
availability 
and 
capacity 
characteristics in a reflected model for offering Energy 
Conservation and minimization of scarcity of the 
requested resources. The proposed scheme uses the cached 
mechanism (as in [1]) for guaranteeing the requested 
resources which are delay sensitive, whereas wireless 
nodes are subject to sudden failures. The proposed 
mechanism extends the introduced Backward Traffic 
Difference (BTD) scheme [1], by adding a second level of 
traffic difference in the proposed framework-namely two-
level BTD. The designed model guarantees the end-to-end 
availability of requested resources while it reduces 
significantly the Energy Consumption and maintains the 
requested scheduled transfers, in a mobility-enabled and 
cluster-based communication. Furthermore, since each 
node has different capacity measures and undefined 
remaining energy, this work adopts a differential

dissimilar 
assignment(s) 
of 
sleep-wake 
schedule 
estimation, based on the traffic difference through time 
and the relative capacity and the associated traffic 
characteristics. The proposed model has been applied in 
real-time devices and the conducted experiments using 
various capacity and traffic-aware metrics, were carried-
out for the energy conservation and the evaluation of the 
proposed model. The BTD scheme initially evaluates the 
data 
volume/traffic 
and 
according 
to 
the 
delay 
bound/limitations, the model adds a second level of traffic 
difference. Real-time experiments show that different 
types of traffic can be supported, where the adaptability 
and the robustness that is exhibited is mitigated according 
to the proposed scheme’s Sleep-time estimations and 
assignments supporting delay sensitive data transfers.  
The structure of this work is as follows: Section II 
describes the related work done and the need in adopting a 
Traffic-based scheme, and then Section III follows by 
presenting the proposed Backward Traffic Difference 
estimation for Energy Conservation as in [1]. The 
proposed framework makes progress beyond the current 
state of the art by supporting delay bounded/sensitive data 
transfers in collaboration with the promiscuous caching 
recoverability mechanism in the case of intermittent 
connectivity. 
Section 
IV 
presents 
the 
real 
time 
performance evaluation results focusing on the behavioral 
characteristics of the scheme and the Backward Traffic 
Difference along with the system’s response, followed by 
Section V with the conclusions and foundations, as well as 
potential future directions.

RELATED WORK AND MOTIVATION 
Multimedia or delay-sensitive applications can only be 
implemented with guaranteed QoS and QoE support, in 
wired environments whereas, rarely mobile devices can 
guarantee the communication in an end-to-end reliable 
manner. This is primarily the reason that the number of 
applications beyond file sharing is kept on a low 
implementation level [2], despite the penetrative character 
of Peer-to-Peer systems nowadays. The type of application 
hosted on wireless devices typically relies its presence on 
the energy that the device hosts. Recent research has 
addressed the Mobile Peer-to-Peer (MP2P) connectivity 
from different perspectives. Work done in [3] has 
introduced a middleware support for client-server 
architectures in nomadic environments, where in an 
organized way the terminals take into consideration the 
group-oriented characteristics. In these environments, the 
associated RPC-based middleware mechanisms have been 
enhanced with queuing or buffering capabilities in order to 
cope with intermittent connections. Examples of these 
implementations are introduced in Mobile DCE in 
researches [4], [5], [6] and [7] including diffusion policies 
and resources’ processing [4] and [5] and manipulation as 
well as different replication procedures [6] and [7]. 
Moreover, many recent high-quality design and 
validation measurement studies in [8], [9] have 
convincingly demonstrated the impact of traffic on the 
end-to-end connectivity (like the work in [10]) and thus 
the impact on the Sleep-time duration and the EC. The 
realistic traffic in real-time communication networks and 
multimedia systems, including wired local-area networks, 
wide-area networks, wireless and mobile networks, 
exhibits noticeable burstiness over a number of time scales 
[11] and [12]. This fractal-like behavior of network traffic 
can be much better modeled by using statistically self-
similar or Long Range Dependent (LRD) processes. These 
processes can be further improved in terms of estimations, 
taking into consideration different theoretical properties 
from those of the conventional Short Range Dependent 
(SRD) processes. There are many Sleep-time scheduling 
strategies that model each node’s transition between ON 
and OFF states. Existing scheduling strategies for wireless 
networks could be classified into three categories: the 
coordinated sleeping [13], [14], where nodes adjust their 
sleeping schedule, the random sleeping [15] and [16], 
where there is no certain adjustment mechanism between 
the nodes in the sleeping schedule with all the pros and 
cons as expressed in [17], and on-demand adaptive 
mechanisms [18], where nodes enter into Sleep-state 
depending on the environment requirements whereas, an 
out-band signaling is used to notify a specific node to go 
to sleep in an on-demand manner.  
In addition to the existing architectures, a number of 
researches have attempted the association of different 
parameters with communication mechanisms, in order to 
reduce the energy consumption. These researches have 
been introduced in [1], [8], [9] and [19] where different 
traffic-based manipulations are modeled, in order to 
overcome the over-exposure and over-activity of nodes. 
These traffic-aware mechanisms can be classified into two 
categories: active and passive schemes. Active techniques 
conserve energy by performing energy conscious 
operations, such as traffic and data volume transmission 
scheduling by using a directional antenna [20], and 
energy-aware routing [21]. On the other hand, passive 
techniques conserve energy by scheduling the interfaces of 
the devices to the sleep mode when a node is not currently 
taking part in communication activity [22] and host 
different adaptive methodologies like the Adaptive-Traffic 
enabled methodologies [9], [10]. The latter takes into 
consideration the traffic pattern that a node is experiencing 
as incoming and outgoing traffic. Authors in [17] consider 
the 
association 
of 
EC 
problem 
with 
different 
parameterized aspects of the traffic (like traffic 
prioritization) and enable a mechanism that tunes the 
interfaces’ scheduler to sprawl in the sleep state according 
to the activity of the traffic of a certain node in the end-to-
end path. Authors in [18] aim to minimize energy 
consumption in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) 
through a 2-tier asynchronous scheduling scheme for delay 
constrained connectivity in wireless devices that are 
asymmetrical in terms of capacity and battery lifetime.  
Within the context of providing an energy-efficient 
traffic manipulation, a fertile ground has been the idea of 
the development of new heuristic approaches, by 
associating different traffic-aware (transmission-aware) 
parameters with communication mechanisms for reducing

the Energy Consumption. In this context, the main goal of 
this work is to further minimize the energy consumed by 
the wireless nodes by applying further traffic association 
and stationarity measures to the estimated sleep-time 
duration of the node. This work aims at prolonging further 
the 
network 
lifetime 
by 
minimizing 
the 
energy 
consumption. This is performed through the incoming 
traffic that traverses each one of the nodes, taking into 
consideration the repetition pattern of the traffic. In 
addition, with the work done in [1], the proposed scheme 
estimates the Backward Difference by using a second level 
of traffic difference estimation, for extracting the time 
duration for which the sensor mote (the node) is allowed to 
Sleep during the next time slot T. This mechanism, in 
order to enable further recoverability and availability of 
the requested resources, proposes an efficient way to cache 
the packets destined for the node with turned-off interfaces 
(sleep state) onto intermediate nodes and enables, through 
the Backward Traffic Difference estimation, the next 
Sleep-time duration of the recipient node to be adjusted 
accordingly. The model has been applied to MICA2 sensor 
nodes hosting a TinyOS operating system which has been 
programmed to tune the wireless interfaces of the motes 
using the Nested C (NesC) language. The designed model 
and the real-time conducted experimental results, show 
that the proposed scheme guarantees the end-to-end 
availability of requested resources, while it reduces 
significantly the Energy Consumption and maintains the 
requested scheduled transfers, in a mobility-enabled 
cluster-based communication. 
 
III. 
TWO-LEVEL BACKWARD DIFFERENCE TRAFFIC 
ESTIMATION FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION FOR MOBILE 
PEER-TO-PEER OPPORTUNISTIC RESOURCE SHARING 
Sleep/wakeup schemes can be classified  into three 
main categories namely: on demand, asynchronous and the 
methodologies based on the scheduled rendezvous. On-
demand schemes assume that destination nodes can be 
awakened somehow just before receiving data. As traffic-
aware policy requires an active scheme to be applied and 
reflective solutions to be adopted, this work uses the time-
based 
incoming 
traffic 
to 
minimize 
the 
energy 
consumption and the relative trade-offs while prolonging 
the systems’ lifetime. The scheduled rendezvous for 
assigning the independent sleep/wakeup slots requires that 
nodes in the system are synchronized and neighboring 
nodes wake up and communicate at the time that at least 1-
hop neighbor is awake and informed. In this work the 
input nodal traffic is being considered and manipulated 
according to the BTD. This manipulation is the basis for 
providing using a feedback model, the sleep-time duration 
estimation to nodes. Wireless nodes have to be self-aware 
in terms of power and processing as well as in terms of 
accurate participation in the transmission activity. There 
are many techniques such as the dynamic caching-oriented 
methods. The present work utilizes a hybridized version of 
the proposed adaptive dynamic caching [9], which is 
considered to behave satisfactorily and enables simplicity 
in real time implementation [10]. On the contrary with 
[10] [19], in this work a different real-time mobility 
scenario is modeled and hosted in the scheme, which 
enables an adaptive tuning of the Sleep-time duration 
according to the activity of the traffic on each node.  
The following section presents the estimations 
performed on each node in order to evaluate the next 
Sleep-time duration according to the node’s incoming 
activity by using the BTD and the second level of BTD 
estimation to extract the time duration for which the node 
is allowed to Sleep during the next time slot T.  
A. Backward Difference Traffic Estimation for Energy 
Conservation for delay sensitive transmissions 
Taking into account the fact that opportunistically 
connected 
nodes 
are 
dynamically 
changing 
their 
operational characteristics, when a source needs to send 
requested packets or stream of packets (file) to a 
destination where the destination node(s) may have moved 
or is/are set in the Sleep-state, then the requested 
information will be missed and lost. This implies that, in a 
non-static multi-hop environment, there is a need to model 
the activity slots that a node experiences in contrast to the 
requested resources in the end-to-end path such that the 
resources can be efficiently shared among users whereas, 
any redundant transmissions and lost packets/streams are 
avoided.  
 
Figure 1.  Real-time Incoming traffic that a node experiences with the 
associated traffic capacity and activity duration of the node with mean
(
E Aft )
.  
As appropriate mechanisms are required to guide the 
activity periods of each one of the nodes, the traversed 
traffic can be the parameterized input. In this way, it 
evaluates the next Sleep-time or the Active periods, and 
considers the terminal’s transmission and reception 
durations. This can be achieved through the BTD 
estimation. The proactive scheduling may increase the 
network lifetime, contrarily with periodic Sleep-Wake 
schedules, as it enables dissimilar active-time. The nodes 
are set in the active state for a period of time according to 
the incoming traffic. The activity period(s) of a node is 
primarily dependent on the nature and the spikes of the 
incoming traffic destined for this node [6]. If the 
transmissions are performed on a periodic basis then the 
nodes’ lifetime can be forecasted and according to a model 
can be predicted and estimated [7]. In this framework, this 
work introduces the one-level BTD and the second level of 
BTD estimation, in order to associate the traversed traffic

of a node with the previous moments and, in real-time, 
reduce the redundant Activity-periods of the node in order 
to conserve energy. Figure 1 shows the incoming traffic 
that a node experiences in real-time with the associated 
traffic capacity and activity duration of the node. The 
traffic can be seen as a renewal process [7] that has 
aggregation characteristics [9] from different sources.  
This work primarily assigns a dissimilar sleep and 
wake time for each node, based on traffic that is destined 
for each node which is cached onto 1-hop intermediate 
node(s), during the Sleep-time of the destination node. 
Figure 2 shows that in a pre-scheduled periodic basis, 
nodes can be in the Sleep-state. Likewise, the packets that 
are destined for the certain node can be cached for a 
specified amount of time (as long as the Node (i) is in the 
Sleep-state) in the 1-hop neighbor node (Node(i-1)) in 
order to be recoverable when node enters the Active state.  
 
 
Figure 2.  A schematic diagram of the caching mechanism addressed in 
this work. 
The 1-hop neighbor node (Node(i-1)) is selected to 
cache the packets destined for the node with turned off 
interfaces (sleep state). The principle illustrated in Figure 2 
denotes that when incoming traffic is in action for a 
specific node, then the node remains active for prolonged 
time. As a showcase, this work takes the specifications of 
the IEEE 802.11x that are recommending the duration of 
the forwarding mechanism that takes place in a non-power 
saving mode lays in the interval 1 nsec < τ <1 psec. This 
means that every ~0.125μsec (8 times in a msec) the 
communication triggering action between nodes may 
result a problematic end-to-end accuracy. Adaptive 
Dynamic Caching [2] takes place and enables the packets 
to be “cached” in the 1-hop neighboring nodes. 
Correspondingly, if node is no-longer available due to 
sleep-state in order to conserve energy (in the interval slot 
T=0.125μsec), then the packets are cached into an 
intermediate node with adequate capacity equals to:

ft , ( )  
k s

t is the needed capacity where iis the destination 
node and k  is the buffering node (a hop before the 
destination via different paths). 
As this scheme is entirely based on the aggregated self-
similarity nature of the incoming traffic with reference to a 
certain node, there should be an evaluation scheme in 
order to enable the node to Sleep, less or more according 
to the previous activity moments. This means that as more 
as the cached traffic is, there is an increase in the sleep-
time duration of the next moment for the destination node. 
This is indicated in the following scheme that takes into 
account the Self-Similarity to estimate the potential spikes 
of the Sleep-time duration. The Sleep-time in turn 
accordingly decreases or increases, based on the active 
traffic destined for Node(i) while being in the Sleep-state.  
 
1) Backward Difference Traffic Moments and Sleep-
time duration estimation 
In [1], authors expanded the traffic-oriented Sleep and 
Wake durations by using single moment Backward Traffic 
Difference and exploiting the silent periods to estimate an 
increase of the sleep-time duration and conserve energy. 
Further to the work done in [1], this work evaluates the 
second level of BTD by using a statistical mean in the 
evaluation of the duration of the next sleep-time of the 
node. Let 
( )
C t be the capacity of the traffic that is destined 
for the Node i in the time slot (duration) t, and 
Ni ( )
t
C
is 
the traffic capacity that is cached onto Node (i-1) for time 
t. Then, the one-level Backward Difference of the traffic is 
evaluated by estimating the difference of the traffic while 
the Node(i) is set in the Sleep-state for a period, as

According to [9], the Long-Range Dependence of self-

mean size of packet train and mean size of inter-train gap

2) Two-level Backward Difference Traffic Moments 
and Sleep-time duration estimation 
 
According to the one-level Backward Difference of the 
Traffic, the difference in the capacity measure can be 
estimated as the difference of the traffic while the Node (i) 
is set in the sleep-state. This corresponds to the admitted 
nodal traffic for a period, as the estimations of the one-
moment traffic difference set above. Therefore, in order to

the Backward slots that are associated with the traffic.  
According to Equation (9) the second level Backward 
Traffic Difference defines the moments that a specified 
volume of traffic traverses the Node(i). Therefore, the 
second level Backward Traffic Difference can impact the 
evaluated sleep duration if the traffic has increased or the 
sleep-time duration of the Node(i) has increased, by 
avoiding the node to become saturated [8], [9], [24] and 
[25]. This estimation after consecutive statistical mean

In order to avoid node’s capacity diversities and 
saturations, each node re-evaluates the sleep-time duration 
by applying idle listening slots. These slots occur when a 
sensor wireless node listens to an idle channel to receive 
possible traffic. Hence, in order to evaluate the idle time

IV. 
REAL TIME PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ANALYSIS, 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, the effectiveness of the proposed BTD 
approach is demonstrated and the accuracy of the 
developed scheme is validated in real-time by comparing 
the analytical results of the scheme to those obtained from 
extensive simulation experiments in work done in [8],[9] 
and [10]. Towards evaluating the proposed scenario in real 
time, the MICA2 sensors nodes have been used [27] 
configured to be manipulated as Peer devices hosting the 
proposed BTD scheme. These sensors were equipped with 
the MTS310 sensor boards.  
The MICA2 features a low power processor and a 
radio module operating at 868/916 MHz enabling data 
transmission at 38.4Kbits/s with an outdoor range of 
maximum set to 50 meters-taking both no-fading and 
fading obstacles in-between for better evaluation of the 
signal strength. The TinyOS operating system is hosted 
onto MICA2 using the Nested C (NesC) language. As the 
sensors are application-specific, they can only host a 
single application. TinyOS does not support memory 
management or internal process management and, 
therefore, it discourages applications from allocating or 
using dynamic memory. This feature enables to evaluate 
the trade-off between the periodic sleep-wake slot 
assignments and the proposed scheme which uses a 
variable and dynamic Sleep-slot assignment. A dynamic 
topology with the mobility expressed in Section IV.A is 
implemented, where the BTD scheme assigns the traffic-
oriented Sleep and Wake durations. Furthermore, MICA2 
supports an expansion connector for attaching various 
sensor boards on it. The MTS310 board was utilized, 
which supports a sensor board with a variety of sensing 
modalities including sounder and an overclocking alarm. 
The sounder was used to extract sound when needed and 
denoting the overload of the node or other determined 
functionalities. Towards evaluating the proposed scheme 
the signal strength measures were taken into account as 
developed in [8] and [9], as well as the minimized ping 
delays between the nodes in the end-to-end path according 
to the

d

, where D is the delay from a node i 
to node j, and 
p
d is the minimized evaluated delay in the 
end-to-end available path. Moreover, considering the need 
of bandwidth and the limited battery power for wireless 
devices, it is necessary to apply efficient routing 
algorithms to create, maintain and repair paths, with least 
possible overhead production. The underlying radio 
technology supports the Cluster-based Routing Protocol 
(CRP) [28]. A common look-up application is being 
developed to enable users to share resources on-the-move 
that are available by peers for sharing. This application 
hosts files of different sizes that are requested by peers in 
an opportunistic manner.

A. Mobility Model used for mobile peers 
Unlike the predetermined Landscape in [31], in this 
work, the mobility scenario used is the Fractional Random 
Walk. The random walk mobility model was derived from 
the Brownian motion, which is a stochastic process that 
models random continuous motion [30], [31]. In this 
model, a mobile node moves from its current location with 
a randomly selected speed in a randomly selected direction 
as real time mobile users act. However, the real time 
mobility that the users express, can be defined by spotting 
out some environmental elements (obstacles, point-of-
interest et.c) where users’ decisions may be affected. In the 
proposed scenario, the new speed and direction are both 
chosen from predefined ranges, [vmin, vmax] and [0, 2π), 
respectively [1], [30]. The new speed and direction are 
maintained for an arbitrary length of time randomly 
chosen from(0, tmax]. At the end of the chosen time, the 
node makes a memoryless decision of a new random speed 
and direction. The movements are expressed as a 
Fractional Random Walk (FRW) on a Weighted Graph, 
utilized in the same way as in [32]. The topology L and the 
sample location of the sensor nodes in the experimental 
room are shown in Figure 5. In addition, this work uses the 
Random walk as a Markov chain (designed as in the 
theoretical foundations in [30]) for the motion of each one 
of the nodes. This allows nodes to continue their 
path/journey according to their initial selection-decision 
from a point, i.e., A to a point B in L. By using the 
Random walk as a Markov chain model it denotes that the 
last step made by the random walk influences the next one 
based on the stationarity and the correlations between the 
movements. Under the condition that a node has moved to 
the right the probability that it continues to move in this 
direction is then higher than to stop movement. This leads 
to a walk adjusted to a walk mobility that leaves the 
starting point much faster than the original random walk 
model. The probabilities are defined as follows: assuming 
that a device is currently at location il , the next location 
of the node 
jl  is chosen from among the neighbors of i 
with probability: 
ij
L
ij
ik
k
w
p
 w
                       (16) 
Equation (16) presents the pij which should be 
proportional to the weight of the edge ( il ,
jl ) and defines 
k as the destination location. In turn the sum of the weights 
of all edges in the landscape L is: 
, :

                   (17) 
All nodes have asymmetry in the signal strength and 
obstacles within their communication with other nodes 
whereas, they are moving with random walks. The 
mobility of each nodes is generated via mechanical robots 
using the Lynxmotion Track Robot Kit [35], which are 
programmed to follow the pattern of probabilistic 
Fractional Random Walk model. The control of the Robot 
is performed through a 2.4GHz Spectrum radio controller 
for the movements in all directions. 
 
B. Real-time performance testing and evaluation using 
the MICA2 sensors equipped with the MTS310 sensor 
boards 
In this section, the results extracted after conducting 
the real time evaluation runs of the proposed scenario, are 
presented. In the utilized scenario, 30 nodes were used 
with each link (frequency channel) having max speed 
reaching data transmission at 38.4Kbits/s. The wireless 
network is organized in 6 overlapping clusters, which may 
vary in time in the active number of the nodes. Each 
source node transmits one 512-bytes (~4Kbits-light traffic) 
packet asynchronously and randomly each node selects a 
destination. The speed of each device can be measured 
with the resultant direction unit vector [9] and the speed. 
Each device has an asymmetrical storage capacity 
compared with the storages of the peer devices. The ranges 
of the capacities for which devices are supported are set in 
the interval 1MB to 20MB
1.  
Figure 6 shows the average Throughput in contrast to 
the number of nodes in the streaming zone that were 
evaluated in real-time using comparatively the periodic 
sleep-time durations, the scheme in [33] and the proposed 
scheme. It is undoubtedly true that the proposed scheme 
enables higher Average Throughput response in the 
system whereas, comparing with the results extracted from 
Figure 7, the proposed scheme enables greater network 
lifetime by using the proposed activity traffic-based 
scheme. Moreover, Figure 8 shows the Successful packet 
Delivery Ratio (SDR) in regards to the simultaneous 
requests in the intra-cluster communicating path for the 
proposed two-level BTD scheme. The results extracted in 
Figure 8 are characterizing both statically located nodes 
(where no movement exists) and mobile nodes where 
Fractional Random Walk is applied. It is important to note 
that when the number of mobile nodes increases the SDR 
drops dramatically. After conducting controlled real-rime 
evaluations it was noticed that, the significant decrease in 
the SDR appears, if the total number of moving nodes 
exceeds the 60% of the nodes in the cluster. This is due to 
the promiscuous caching policy that it affects the active 
nodes to prolong their active-time duration causing 
thereafter to prolong their sleep-time duration which in 
turn, results in a significant drop in the SDR. Figure 9 
shows the Average Throughput with the Total Transfer 
Delay in (μsec) is shown, for different mobility models. 
Figure 9 presents the different Throughput responses that 
the proposed scheme exhibits in contrast to the mobility 
characteristics, for full node mobility, moderate and low 
(30%) mobility. It is important to mark that in the cases of 
full node and moderate mobility, the Throughput decreases 
when the delays experienced are increased. This is 
expected, as when the delays on nodes increase the overall 
                                                           
1 The capacity for each device can be tuned according to the volume of the Traffic 
in the configuration process.

cluster throughput drops. This is due to the transfers’ end-
to-end delay metric that characterizes the sensitivity of the 
transfer in delay.

Figure 10 shows the lifespan of each node with the

Time evaluated comparisons. Measures for the Delay 
requests with the corresponding Energy efficiency are 
presented in Figure 11. Results obtained in Figure 11 show 
that the network lifetime can be significantly prolonged 
when the 2nd level BTD is applied. By comparing the 
results obtained through real-time experiments for the 
scheme developed in [33] as well as with the periodic 
Sleep/Wake scheduling, the proposed scheme offers 
greater Energy-Efficiency, while it minimizes the delay 
per request.

schemes. It is important to notice that the network lifetime 
is significantly extended by using the proposed one and 
two level BTD for enabling Energy Conservation.

node is expecting to receive.  
 
 
Figure 18.  Energy Efficiency (service capacity/total energy consumed) 
bytes/mW with fraction of the remaining energy onto each node.  
 
The Throughput response of the system under the 
evaluated two-level BTD in contrast to the number of 
requests for certain fading measures’ characteristics is 
shown in Figure 16. The proposed scheme shows that in 
the case of Rayleigh fading characteristics the evaluated 
Throughput for the two-level BTD in contrast to the 
number of requests remains at relatively high levels when 
the number of requests is decreased. Contrarily when the 
number requests increases the Throughput drops as the 
Rayleigh fading takes place. This is somehow expected as 
in the presence of Rayleigh fading the packet transmission 
and service rate of the wireless channels drops 
dramatically. In Figure 17, the number of incoming flows 
on each node in real-time with the incoming traffic, for 
both the cached traffic and the traffic that a node is 
expecting to receive is presented. It is important to notice 
that the cached traffic is not negligible compared with the 
total volume of traffic that traverses the node. The 
promiscuous caching enables recoverability of the cached 
traffic that is forwarded to the destination node. It is 
obvious that the promiscuous caching enables high SDR 
rates as data can be recovered, however, it aggravates the 
energy conservation mechanism by prolonging the next 
active time duration of the node causing energy 
consumption.

optimized Energy-Efficiency behavior as it allows greater 
Energy-Efficiency in contrast to the remaining Energy of 
each node. Scheme adopted by [33] is shown to have the 
lowest Energy-Efficiency behavior compared also with the 
periodic sleep-wake schedules.  
 
 
Figure 21. Using the likelihood of Fractional Random Walk (FRW) on a 
Weighted Graph compared for BTD and two-level BTD schemes. 
 
 
The main reason that the work in [33] behaves in this 
way is probably the communication structure of Zerba-
MAC which it still relies on time slots similar to TDMA-
based solutions. Hence, each slot is tentatively assigned to 
a node whereas, it can be stolen by other nodes if it is not 
used by its owner. In Figure 19, the average pair-wise 
inter-contact time (msec) with the number of pairs of 
participating nodes (1-hop nodes that are supporting the 
promiscuous caching process) is presented.

important metric, since participating nodes enable the 
multi-hop communication for a certain time duration and 
hence the establishment of End-to-End connectivity. 
Moreover, the latter enables us to evaluate the 
performance and robustness of the proposed scheme 
regarding the support of delay sensitive transmission 
handling and recoverability effectiveness. Results obtained

Average Throughput with the number of Nodes in the 
streaming zone. The results extracted for CCDF Sharing 
Reliability with the Number of sharing Peer-users were for 
both Simulation experiments and real-time estimations 
similar with minor and expected variations (within the 
confidence interval of 5-7% for the conducted simulation 
experiments as in [12] and [19]). It can be depicted that the 
simulated results and the results extracted through real-
time traffic and experiments are experiencing 8-12% real 
values variations. 
 
Figure 25. Delay requests in seconds with the Energy Efficiency (Eq. 
(14)-(15))  compared for three different schemes. 
  
Figure 21 shows the comparison of the two schemes in 
reference with respect to the likelihood of Fractional 
Random Walk (FRW) on a Weighted Graph with the 
average distance for each one of the nodes. The 
transmissions are interrupted when the transmission 
distance of the node is increasing whereas, node in 
reference may find alternative paths to complete the 
transfers. Figure 22 shows the mean total download time 
with the contact time for the peers. It is important to mark-
out that the proposed optimized scheme in this work 
outperforms the scheme proposed in [1] allowing less 
mean total download time and minimizing their respective 
durations.  
The mean replicated capacity in MB per user with the 
peer-contacts and their respective durations is shown in 
Figure 23. During the replicated evaluation measures 
parameters such as the promiscuous caching threshold 
parameter 
i
 introduced in [9] were used in order to avoid 
saturation of nodes [9] and capacity failure due to repeated 
caching to intermediate nodes. Packet drop ratio during 
real-time evaluation experimentation for two mobility 
models is shown in Figure 24. Figure 24 shows that 
statically located nodes are shown to have the least 
possible packet drops whereas the proposed scheme 
behaves satisfactorily when the Fractional Random Walk 
with Distance broadcast takes place.  
The Energy Efficiency is obviously the most important 
measure for the performance and the energy effectiveness 
of the proposed scheme. In Figure 25, the delay requests in 
seconds with the Energy Efficiency (as presented in 
Equations (14) and (15) compared for three different 
schemes are shown. It is important to emphasize in the 
optimization of the Energy Efficiency measures exhibited 
by the proposed scheme whereas, at the same time to 
underline the energy differences by the scheme proposed 
in [1] as well as with the periodic schedules. Figure 25 
shows the Energy Efficiency levels in contrast to the delay 
for each particular request (transfer). It can be depicted 
that the results extracted for the Energy Efficiency show 
that the proposed scheme hosting the two-level BTD 
outperforms the one-level and the periodic sleep, offering 
in almost all Energy Efficiency levels, minimized delay 
for the users’ requests/transfers.

CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH 
This 
work 
proposes 
an 
adaptive 
traffic-based 
mechanism taking into consideration the active moments, 
and measures the incoming traffic by using the active-time 
comparisons. Moreover, the proposed two-level backward 
traffic-difference is presented. This work considers in real-
time the one-level BTD scheme and compares the 
performance with the proposed two-level BTD evaluation 
hosted on wireless nodes. The proposed methodology 
takes place during the resource exchange process taking 
into account the promiscuous caching characteristics and 
the associated transmission aspects (delay and capacity 
characteristics) for establishing and maintaining reliable 
communication. The research framework proposes and 
provides comparative evaluation of a two-level backward 
estimation model for allocating the sleep-time duration to 
a certain node based on the volume of traffic that the node 
is expecting and admitting (traversed traffic). The 
proposed scheme aims to further enable Energy 
Conservation during the resource sharing process of the 
wireless nodes. The scheme uses the promiscuous caching 
mechanism for guaranteeing the requested resources and 
utilizes the one-level and based on delay criteria, the two-
level BTD model for the Sleep time estimation. Based on 
the extracted real-time results and compared to the 
simulated and results extracted in [1], the designed model 
guarantees the end-to-end availability of requested 
resources while it reduces significantly the Energy 
Consumption. Moreover, the proposed two-level BTD 
maintains the requested scheduled transfers while, at the 
same time it increases the throughput response of the 
system. The evaluated results obtained in real-time show 
that this method uses optimally the network’s and system’s 
resources in terms of capacity and EC and offers high 
SDRs particularly in contrast with other similar existing 
Energy-efficient schemes as well as the one-level BTD 
scheme in [1].  
Next steps and on-going work within the current 
research context will be the expansion of this model into a 
variable level-based BTD which will encompass a multi-
level Markov Fractality Model (MFM). This fractal model

will potentially associate the different moments of the 
traffic activity and it will be able to extract the Sleep-time 
estimations for the nodes, in order to enable them to 
conserve Energy, while it will maintain a reliable resource 
sharing process on-the-move.
