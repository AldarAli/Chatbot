Abstract— Data-driven business models play a significant role 
in the digital transformation of traditional value-added 
industries. More and more existing and potential partners of 
automobile manufacturers show interest in the data generated 
by the vehicles. However, there is still no monetary value 
assessment to support decisions regarding the release of data. 
Traditional pricing approaches for material goods are based 
on cost, margin, and volume. However, these bottom-up 
calculation concepts are not applicable to digital goods. The 
background to this is, among other things, the uncertainty 
about the potential sales volume, the difficulty of cost splitting, 
and the high unit cost degression of digital goods. This paper 
provides a decision support for selling data to third parties as 
an intangible product. It introduces a concept that allows to 
value data generated by a motor vehicle in order to determine 
potential prospects and prices for sale. The evaluation model 
developed can be used to strengthen the car manufacturer's 
negotiating position towards potential data buyers.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
 The use of valuable data will fundamentally change 
competition in the future [31]. “The expected growth of the 
value pool from car data and shared mobility could add up to 
more than USD 1.5 trillion by 2030“ [1]. Volume and quality 
of this “data treasure“ will create strategic as well as 
operational competitive advantage [21]. 
Today, data is generated in large quantities by the 
vehicle, recording thousands of attributes. On the one hand, 
the vehicle user (driver) has the opportunity to enter data in 
on-board systems and “exchange” them for services. He/she 
is offered individually adapted functions, such as voice 
control, comfort settings when entering the car, navigational 
instructions in real time or other services [4][5]. On the other 
hand, a variety of sensors and computers in the vehicle, 
unnoticed by the driver, generates a steady stream of data, 
which among others serves for control purposes [14]. 
Examples are the anti-lock braking system or the automatic 
windscreen wiper and light regulation. 
The data usage can be divided into nine purpose oriented 
categories [27]: 
 
Meeting regulatory and legal requirements (e.g., 
liability for material defects) 
 
Supporting marketing and advertisement (e.g., 
customer profiling) 
 
Assessing IT security (e.g., logging and monitoring) 
 
Improving technical processes (e.g., diagnostics and 
programming) 
 
Fulfilling terms of contract (e.g., new digital 
services and solutions) 
 
Innovating 
and 
developing 
products 
(e.g., 
monitoring and analytics) 
 
Ensuring road safety (e.g., traffic management) 
 
Transferring to third parties (e.g., car sharing) 
 
Facilitating vehicle use (e.g., autonomous driving) 
All these categories have in common that value is created 
through the use of collected vehicle data. On the one hand, 
this 
value 
is reflected in 
technical or qualitative 
improvements as well as in cost reductions of the company's 
internal processes. On the other hand, the use of vehicle data 
can also lead to an economic improvement of the business 
results and in particular to an increase in turnover [32]. This 
may be a result of higher sales figures of products, i.e., 
manufactured vehicles, which are more attractive through 
data-based functions (“data infused products”). In addition, it 
is possible to offer certain data for sale as an end product 
itself [20].  
This paper focuses on selling data to third parties. The 
demand for vehicle generated data depends on the benefit 
seen or expected by the buyer. From the perspective of the 
data provider, it is important to determine the value of the 
data in order to estimate the demand potential on an external 
market and to create appropriate pricing models [1].  
II. 
EXISTING VALUATION APPROACHES 
The generic value of a data product in sales situations 
cannot be determined by a benefit that has already been 
realized, since the data is not yet being used by the buyer at 
the time of the transfer. Therefore, an evaluation must be 
based on probable and potential benefits [20]. This value can 
be estimated 
by using qualitative and quantitative 
methodological approaches. For a corresponding systematic 
value determination of vehicle data, a number of existing 
evaluation methods are presented. This is initially done in a

tabular overview in Section II.A, followed by a more 
detailed description in Sections II.B and II.C and by a 
discussion of limitations and transferability in Section III.A. 
Literature often speaks of data and information without 
exactly differentiating between these terms. Some authors 
see in information “refined data”, e.g., by placing it in a 
context of meaning. In this paper, both terms are used 
synonymously according to the quoted sources. 
A. Overview of potential methods for data evaluation 
The identification and selection of potential valuation 
procedures is done through a combination of literature 
review and in-depth interviews. First, 20 sources of literature 
are used to collect a comprehensive set of possible valuation 
approaches. Subsequently, valuation approaches are selected 
and specified with the help of 50 in-depth interviews with 
experts from the divisions or departments in the areas of cost 
engineering, data strategy, data analysis, and purchasing. The 
consolidated results are shown in Table I [27].

B. Qualitative evaluation 
The qualitative assessment and selection of methods is 
carried out by the procedure described in Section II.A. The 
following common methods for evaluating vehicle data are 
identified: 
 
Data Product Scorecard 
 
Data Value Design Canvas 
The Data Product Scorecard is a method of pricing on 
data marketplaces. For this purpose, the customer's 
willingness to pay depending on various data properties must 
first be estimated. This qualitative evaluation of the data 
properties is made by the Data Product Scorecard from a 
simulated perspective of end users or potential buyers of the 
data [21]. As part of an evaluation workshop within the 
company, the role of the user is taken and each data 
characteristic given in the scorecard is rated with 0, 5 or 10 
points. 
The Data Value Design Canvas approach looks at the 
data value chain. The approach is based on the theory of 
Service Dominant Logic and the “Jobs-To-Be-Done” theory 
[3][22]. 
According to [25], the data value chain begins with the 
generation of data and extends up to the provision of 
information to the (paying) customer. 
C. Quantitative evaluation 
Many companies have problems finding the real 
economic value of their data [23]. For a rethink in the 
development of new business models [12] and the 
optimization of internal processes, the determination of this 
value, especially for the automotive industry, is of particular 
importance. 
 
Value determination per user  
When acquiring companies with data-driven business 
models who have not yet monetized their database but still 
offer data-based applications to the end user, the data value 
is often determined by the value of the application per user. 
The price of acquisition is divided by the total number of end 
users of the application. From this calculated price per user 
the average user acquisition costs are subtracted [16][28].  
 
Value determination by Laney   
According to Laney the data is evaluated through quality-
based and quantitative financial analysis [20]. In the quality-
oriented evaluation, the output is a scoring value between 
zero and one, in the financial evaluation it is an absolute 
monetary value. The two-part consideration focuses on 
methods for improving the “Information Management 
Discipline” and deals with “Foundational Measures” as: 
 
How correct, complete and exclusive is the data? 
(Intrinsic Value), 
 
How good and relevant is the data for specific 
purposes? (Business Value), 
 
How does this data affect key business drivers? 
(Performance Value). 
On the other hand, the “Information Economic Benefit“ of 
“Financial Measures“ is examined: 
 
What would it cost us if we lose this data? (Cost 
Value), 
 
What could we get from selling or trading this data? 
(Market Value),

 
How does this data contribute to our bottom line? 
(Economic Value). 
Both considerations provide a quantitatively measurable 
contribution to the value of data and will be explained in 
more detail below. Based on a collection and analysis of 
existing valuation approaches according to Laney, a 
plausibility check and a requirement analysis lead to new 
valuation perspectives for the developed new process model 
(see Section III.A). 
Basically, Laney's approaches are not limited to any 
specific field of application [33]. Section III.A discusses to 
what extent these approaches are suitable for vehicle data in 
the automotive industry and in what form adaptations and 
expansions are necessary for this. 
 
Intrinsic valuation 
The intrinsic value of information (IVI) is based on a 
consideration of information regarding quality and rarity. 
  
 
 
 
(1) 
“Validity” reflects the proportion of “correct” data, 
“Completeness” the proportion of available data in all 
potentially accessible data, “Scarcity” the proportion of 
competitor data to the data available on the market and 
“Lifecycle“ the period of usefulness of the respective 
information. 
 
Business value of information 
When calculating the Business Value of Information 
(BVI), a process-specific value of data is aggregated for all 
corresponding processes of the customer’s company. 
 
 
 
(2) 
 
Business Value of Information 
 
Number of considered processes 
 
Process index 
 
“Relevance“ indicates the usefulness of the data or 
information for a business process. This value lies in the 
interval between zero and one. The probability measure 
“Timeliness” mirrors the aspect that data is not workable at 
every instant of time. 
 
Performance value of information 
The performance value of information (PVI) expresses 
how the performance of the object of consideration changes 
with the inclusion of data or information. 
 
 
 
(3) 
 
Performance Value of Information 
 
Key Performance Indicator using data 
 
Key Performance Indicator without using data 
 
Information lifetime 
 
Period of KPI consideration 
   The key performance indices quantify the power of 
processes with and without data support. The quotient of 
both KPIs (KPIi, KPIc) conduce to the understanding how 
data can improve value creation. One example for the 
“performance value of information” in practice is the data 
driven Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) for defect 
prevention [35].  
 
Cost value of information 
According to Laney, the cost of information is limited to 
the process costs for acquiring the data.  
 
 
 
 
(4) 
 
Cost Value of Information 
 
Process expenditures 
 
Proportion of process costs for data 
acquisition 
 
Average information lifetime 
 
Period of the process cost measurement 
 
Process index 
 
Number of processes 
 
The process expenditures “ProcExp” of an overall 
process are multiplied by a contribution factor “Attrib”. The 
contribution factor expresses which proportion of the process 
costs can be attributed to the acquisition of the data. 
“LostRevenue” takes into account the loss of revenue 
through information shortage in each process. 
 
Market value of information 
The market value of information (MVI) is relevant in 
public marketplaces. The market value of data is expressed, 
e. g., by a license price (exclusive price) multiplied by the 
number of licenses. 
 
 
 
 
(5) 
 
In addition to the market price and the number of 
licenses, the Premium factor takes into account the brand 
strength and rarity of the data. This Premium factor 
determines the extra charge a customer would be willing to 
pay to obtain exclusive rights. 
 
Economic value of information  
The Economic Value of Information (EVI) expresses the 
extent to which revenue changes as soon as the information 
is used to generate and increase revenue.

Period of the measurement 
 
First, the revenue is recorded without the use of certain 
relevant information. Subsequently, the turnover is estimated 
by a control group using this information. Also the 
expenditures for obtaining, storing, managing, and using 
information are identified. The respective revenues and 
expenditures are measured in a period t. The economic value 
of the information is now calculated by subtracting the 
revenues without information and the costs incurred from the 
revenues gained with the information. The resulting value is 
multiplied by the ratio of information lifetime T to duration 
of measurement t. This results in an EVI value for the full 
information lifecycle. 
III. 
DEVELOPED METHODOLOGY 
A. Motivation of a new valuation approach 
IVI, BVI and PVI are pure comparative methods. These 
do not calculate monetary values, yet they show some 
interesting perspectives. The BVI sums up the value of 
special information over all use cases in the company, and 
both the rarity and the quality indicators are taken into 
account in the IVI. 
The methodology introduced in this section follows an 
approach also based on PVI and BVI. The value of data can 
lead to process improvements and profit increases. The Data 
Value Design Canvas lists nine factors which affect the value 
of data. The effects of information/data are considered 
generally. For example, information/data protects against 
unwanted events or promotes wanted events. Unwanted 
events always result in costs. Thus, the avoidance of 
unwanted events corresponds to a cost reduction. The 
realization of desired events effects an increase in sales as 
the most relevant example. 
The Data Product Scorecard assesses the willingness to 
pay of a customer. If the information considered is “perfect”, 
the customer is willing to pay the full price for this 
information. The determination of willingness to buy is 
based exclusively on estimates. 
The method according to Laney, the Data Value Design 
Canvas and the Data Product Scorecard focuses on the 
quality of the information/data. 
The monetary impact of EVI relates to an increase in 
sales. A monetary value can be derived from the Data 
Product Scorecard by multiplying the qualitative result score 
by the willingness to pay. A market value, in turn, may result 
from a fixed license price multiplied by the number of 
licenses sold or salable and a rarity and reputation factor. 
All methods have in common that always certain use 
cases of data usage are considered. The PVI and BVI 
consider process improvements, the MVI and the Data 
Product Scorecard data sales, the Data Value Design Canvas 
both data sales and process improvements. Only the IVI does 
not aim at a defined application field because it is based on a 
general quality criterion. 
By comparing the different approaches listed in Section 
II, some requirements can be derived for a new concept 
integrating different aspects: 
 
Quality factors must be taken into account. 
 
The willingness to pay is relevant for data sales. This 
depends on various factors, including the purchase 
motive, the perceived benefit, the reputation of the 
seller and the individual purchase situation.  
 
Data has the potential to increase sales on the 
customer side or to reduce costs for internal 
customer processes.  
 
Competition should be considered as an important 
factor. 
B. Evaluation model 
The developed “integrated methodology” for an 
innovative evaluation model meets these requirements by a 
combination of quality assessment [26], price differentiation 
[36], cost management, and competitive analysis [32]. So, 
for a specific use case, it is possible to estimate a monetary 
value of data by integrating the various value perspectives. 
The plausibility of selling prices is achieved by combining 
qualitative tools based on methods such as Business Model 
Canvas or Data Canvas with a practical evaluation through 
quality workshops as well as quantitative calculations. These 
include, among other things, the valuation by Laney, a 
bottom-up cost calculation as well as profit split approaches. 
Figure 1 shows the process steps of the model for a use-
case-specific value determination. The non-rivalry property 
of data enables multiple sales of similar data bundles or even 
the same dataset. The total value of the data bundle can be 
determined as the sum of the values across all (potential) use 
cases:

Figure 1. Process for the monetary valuation of data 
 
As a first step in the process, data requests from potential 
business customers are collected or data is proactively 
offered to potential customers. In order to be able to identify 
potential data needs, a customer's business model must first 
be understood (1 + 2). 
In which way the customer translates the data into 
benefits can be identified through a systematic analysis of 
possible use cases. For this a combination of the Business 
Model Canvas and Data Value Design Canvas is suitable. 
With progressive understanding of the application, it is 
theoretically possible to offer the customer additional 
versions of data bundles (2 + 3). 
In order to determine the customer's willingness to pay, 
the value of the use case must be understood in detail [15]. 
For this, a possible cost reduction or increase in sales by the 
data must be determined.  
For each use case, there is both a short-term and a long-
term monetary benefit, which in individual cases can also be 
zero. The model of Figure 1 shows a parallel approach to 
Laney's business value calculation of information, which 
determines the data relevance for specific processes (4). 
In cases where there is competition on "data 
marketplaces" or the self-collection of data is significantly 
more favorable than granting the monetary benefit to a third 
party, these influences must be measured for further 
calculation (5). 
At the same time, the data is qualitatively evaluated 
based on selected criteria (see Section II.B). The model 
considers the monetary value of quality criteria, following 
Laney's valuation ideas in the form of a quality factor Q (see 
Section IV.D) (6). 
In addition, the data contribution factor C takes into 
account that other vehicle generated data or additional 
information may be necessary in addition to the offered 
vehicle usage data (see Section IV.D) (7). 
After having carried out steps 1 to 7, finally the use-case-
specific combined value of the data is calculated. The 
determined preliminary data value 𝑉 (see Section IV.B) is 
multiplied by the quality factor 𝑄 and the data contribution 
factor 𝐶. Both of them are discount factors. The preliminary 
value and the willingness to pay is reduced according to low 
quality or insufficient amount of data. Interdependencies 
between the factors are possible but not taken into account.  
C. Restrictions 
It is important to make the best selection of use cases to 
generate the maximum revenue of data sales for the business.

The present technical restrictions must be observed. 
However, this limits the number of possible applications. 
The possible amount of data to be transferred to different 
use cases is restricted by the number of transmission paths 
and the transfer rate of each of them: 
 
 
 
 
(9) 
 
Maximum transfer rate for transmission k 
 
Data volume j to be transferred by path k 
 
Index of possible transmission paths 
 
Index of required data for each transmission path 
depending on the requirements of the application 
 
Total number of required data volumes per 
transmission path 
 
Since many use cases are based on fleet data, the 
complexity is additionally increased. Accordingly, it has to 
be determined which vehicles transmit which data via which 
path with which transfer rates, in order to technically enable 
the optimum amount of use cases. This problem cannot be 
solved conventionally or manually. It is necessary to test new 
tools for this, such as machine learning algorithms.  
IV. 
USE CASE RESULTS 
The applicability of the developed methodology is 
experimentally tested on the basis of three real sales 
situations. The first use case deals with the sale of weather 
data to a weather service provider who wants to offer 
additional hazard warning services for autonomous driving. 
The second use case relates to the sale of weather data to 
a transmission system operator to “ensure a reliable and 
uninterrupted supply in the high voltage grid for 
approximately 41 million people” [34]. 
In the third use case the sale of road segment data (RSD) 
to a navigation maps provider is considered. This data helps

to provide a high definition road map for autonomous 
driving.

In the business structure analysis, data is divided into 
four categories. “Internal rational data” is owned by the 
organization and updated at certain points of time. “Internal 
continuous data” is owned by the organization and available 
in the form of continuous streams. “External rational data” 
is owned by third parties and updated at certain points of 
time. “External continuous data” is owned by third parties 
and available as continuous streams. This classification is 
used for the data contribution factor defined in Section 
IV.D. 
B. Monetary Effect 
Next, the financial perspective is taken and the monetary 
effect of the three use cases is considered.

per year and the estimated globally available 3.3 million 
high or fully autonomous vehicles in the year 2020, this 
results in a potential revenue of 4.95 million €. The 
calculation assumes a market share of 15%: 
 
Market shares of up to 25% are often predicted in this 
product category [36]. In this best-case scenario, the 
weather service provider reaches a market share of 3.3 Mio 
* 0.25. This number is based on market data for navigation 
charts [36]. In this case, the data buyer reaches a revenue of 
8.25 million €. 
 
For the further demonstration of the methodology the 
lower potential revenue of 4.95 million € is assumed. 
 
Transmission system operator 
The data sets offered in this use case are generated by a 
dynamic car-sharing fleet of 650 vehicles, covering the 
entire business area of Munich (82 km2). The value of the 
data is analyzed on the one hand by means of a pure cost 
estimate and on the other hand by an opportunity analysis. 
In total, the transmission system operator allocates 1 billion 
€ to grid stabilization in Germany in 2017 [18][34]. 
According to Statista, the total turnover of the German 
network operators in 2015 was 31.2 billion €, in which the 
company in question realized 3.3 billion  [24][34]. This 
results in a market share of 10.6%.  
 
In 2017, 547 TWh of electricity were produced in 
Germany [9]. Adjusted for the market share of 10.6%, 57.8 
TWh of electricity are attributable to the company.  
 
Since the company also has another location, the total 
transfer performance must be considered. At the second 
location, the company is the sole network operator [34]. 
There are about 106 TWh of electricity generated [11]. This 
results in a total transmission capacity of 153.8 TWh per 
year. 
 
The necessary data for the solar energy forecast 
(temperature and GPS coordinates) resulting from business 
model analysis are delivered via the dynamic vehicle fleet in 
the Munich area. The power consumption in Munich is 
identified as a reference. In Munich, 2.8 TWh of electricity 
are consumed per year in total of all inhabitants [30][37].  
Compared to the total transfer performance of the company, 
this results in a share of 1.7% for the Munich area. 
 
If one multiplies this percentage with the amount of one 
billion €, which the network operator identifies as costs for 
network stabilization in 2017 [34], this results in a 
maximum possible cost reduction of 17 million euros, 
which the network operator saves in a best-case scenario, in 
which  perfect network stabilization over the data supply is 
provided. 
 
However, it can be assumed that the provided data cannot 
be expected to improve the forecast of renewable energy 
performance for grid stabilization perfectly. Nevertheless, 
even the assumption of a ten percent improvement leads to a 
cost reduction of 1.7 million €. 
This achievable value is calculated taking into account 
the average solar energy generated in Bavaria. The value of 
the data material is justified by consideration of an 
opportunity value.  Here, the value of data for a perfect solar 
energy forecast results from the price and the amount of solar 
energy in the Munich area, which would have to be bought 
in the absence of such a data-based demand forecast. In other 
words, the amount “price times quantity” reflects the short-
term purchase of solar energy which is necessary for grid 
stabilization, resulting from inadequate predictions. This 
could be avoided by making good use of the data. The 
Fraunhofer Institute gives an average value of produced solar 
energy of 9.8% in electricity generation in Germany [13]. 
The Federal Network Agency's statistics show that Bavaria 
produces the most solar energy in Germany [8]. Munich is 
the leader in hours of sunshine [19], which is why for 
Munich the average value of produced solar energy is 
calculated as the lower limit in a minimum scenario. 
 
Taking into account a green electricity price of 56 € per 
MWh, this results in a potential saving of 14.4 million € 
(assuming a perfect prediction) [10]. 
It is striking that the calculated values of the best possible 
savings are relatively close (14.4 million € and 17 million €).  
 
Navigation maps provider 
The calculation for this use case is similar to the 
monetary revenue estimate for the weather service. The 
willingness to pay for the HD card in the automotive 
industry is 60 € for a highly autonomous or fully 
autonomous vehicle per year.  
For the year 2020, a global volume of 3.3 million high or 
fully autonomous vehicles is expected on the market, in 2035 
a total fleet of 28 million vehicles (see Table III).

Figure 2. Evaluation of the quality criteria of data 
The market for navigation charts in vehicles is divided 
into market shares of 15% to 25% [36].  
These assumptions lead, in the worst case scenario 
(assuming a market share of 15%), to a potential turnover of 
at least 29.7 million € in 2020 (3.3 million * 60 €* 0.15) and 
252 million € in 2035 (28 million * 60 € * 0.15). 
C. Market competition 
The market position is qualitatively described for all 
three use cases by the criteria according to [23] “is it 
valuable”, “is it rare”, “is it hard to imitate” and “is the firm 
organized for success”. The answers to the questions are 
based on a competitive analysis in which 22 competitors are 
considered in the case of the transmission system operator, 
24 for the weather service and 26 for the navigation maps 
supplier. The qualitative assessment shows that there is a 
“short term competitive advantage” for all three use cases. In 
the case of the transmission system operator, also a 
quantitative value can be set by an “in-house manufacturing 
vs. external purchase analysis”, which means a counter-
calculation of an internal generation of data as an alternative 
to an external purchase. From practical experience, a rigid 
sensor system of 2000 sensors for the price of 145 € per 
sensor is assumed. Surcharges are 8,000 € for housing 
development, 90,000 € for programming and 5,000 € for 
position planning. 
This results in investment costs of 393,000 euros: 
 
Furthermore, a monthly failure rate of 0.5% is assumed. 
This results from damage done by weather and vandalism to 
publicly accessible sensors. Corresponding monthly repair 
costs are 1,850 €. For data transmission 20 € per month are 
estimated. This results in a total annual expenditure of 
415,440 €: 
 
This consideration is a minimum estimate. It can be 
assumed that the transmission system operator does not own 
2,000 relevant properties in Munich to set up sensors.  
The value of 415,440 € corresponds to the amount that 
the transmission system operator would have to raise to 
collect perfect data in the same quantity. 
D. Data quality and contribution factors 
In order to evaluate the data quality, 14 data scientists are 
interviewed in four expert workshops for each case on given 
quality criteria. The results of the workshops are summarized 
in Figure 2 and transformed into a quality factor Q.

The evaluation factor values ci of the criteria result from 
a pairwise comparison of all criteria in a preference matrix. 
The data contribution factor C expresses if all required data 
(contribution factor = 1), almost all data (contribution factor 
= 0.75), about half of the data (contribution factor = 0.5), few 
data (contribution factor = 0.25) or no data at all 
(contribution factor = 0) can be provided.

Evaluation of key data 
The use-case-specific factors CM und CK differentiate 
between key data und metadata (additional data). The expert 
based weights wcm and wck rate the relative data contribution 
of each data type in the use case. Location based services are 
one example. They are based on customer preferences 
(metadata) on the one hand and GPS data (key data) 
generated by the vehicle on the other hand.  Experts give 
weights of 0.2 for GPS data and 0.8 for preference data. It is 
assumed that the vehicle can deliver 90 percent of the GPS 
data needed, however none of the preference data. So, the 
contribution factor of the metadata is zero. The calculation of 
C results in the value of 0.18: 
 
The 
corresponding calculation rules provide the 
following results (see Table IV) coming from the workshops 
for the three use cases.

E. Selling prices 
Through the product of monetary effect (V), quality (Q) 
and contribution factor (C) (see Figure 1) a value for the 
offered data of 1.95 million € (4.95 million € * 0.79 * 0.5) 
for the use case “weather service” is calculated, for the use 
case “transmission system operator” 332,352 € (415,440 € * 
0.8 * 1.0) and for the use case "navigation maps 
manufacturer" in the worst case scenario 13.07 million € 
(29.7 million € * 0.8 * 0.55). With the weather service as 
well as the navigation maps manufacturer the turnover is in 
the foreground. In the case of the transmission system 
operator, the focus is not on turnover, but on cost savings. 
The costs for the self-collection of the data are less than the 
calculated costs of externally purchased data that lead to the 
same savings effect, so that this lower value of about 
415,440 € is used. In the case of self-collection of data the 
contribution factor is 1.0, since all required data is recorded 
internally.  
F. Lessons Learned 
On the one hand the presented evaluation model was 
applied to several ficitious use cases with real information 
coming from companies interested in buying data but 
without any decision. On the other hand, the evaluation 
model was tested on several specific sales situations and the 
outcome of the model, i.e., the post calculated data value, 
was compared to the real sales price. The monetary data 
values determined using the evaluation model show an 
average deviation of 8% from the sales prices negotiated in 
practice.  
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The methods of data evaluation identified in the literature 
are individually not suitable for practical value determination 
of data and their pricing in sales situations. This paper 
presents a methodology that focuses on the selling of data as 
intangible products to external business partners.  
The methodology can also be transferred to use cases 
within the company. In addition to determining the value of 
the data, decisions regarding the pricing model must be 
made.  
However, for long-term strategies it is unclear to what 
extent recorded data is valuable in the future. Data that is still 
useless, because currently there are no use cases, can be 
highly relevant for future use cases. Because of the existing  
knowledge gap and missing empirical values, it is impossible 
to determine a value of data over the entire lifecycle, above 
all because of very uncertain future potentials.  
This article exemplifies a possible evaluation and 
monetization of a small fraction of the total data available in 
the automotive industry. 
Looking at the huge amounts of data available there, it 
quickly becomes clear that due to technical limitations 
probably never all potential use cases can be implemented. 
There are various transmission options for vehicle generated 
data. The built-in memory can be read in authorized garages, 
updates can be transmitted at weekly or daily intervals, or 
data can be transferred in real time. There is always a 
technical limitation due to the restricted transfer rates or 
transfer options. Not all conceivable applications can be 
realized at the same time. 
It is also an open question whether it makes sense to 
regard the vehicle as an open platform. In this case, an 
automobile manufacturer or even the automotive industry as 
a platform provider could probably sell the platform as a 
service (PaaS) to service providers who will pay for specific 
data accessed via the platform. As an analogy, platforms of 
Apple and Android can be considered. Third parties develop 
services to be offered on these platforms. The developed 
services (e. g., apps) increase the attractiveness of the 
platform. Depending on the design, there are direct and 
indirect network effects. With regard to autonomous driving, 
this approach may potentially increase the attractiveness of 
vehicles and vehicle fleets acting as such platforms. For 
example, at BMW, in addition to many existing Connected 
Drive services, applications of third-party providers can be 
activated, which leads to an immense increase of the value of 
a ride and the driving experience for the customer. Here, 
completely new service ecosystems spanning and connecting 
different industrial sectors are appearing. To name only one 
step toward the future, the intelligent personal assistant from 
BOSCH enables the networking of car services and e-home 
services [6].
