Abstract—Using a new concept of request/response in a two-
way-to-way traffic light controlled crossroad, the redesign of 
the trajectories can be accomplished by the application of 
methods for navigation, guidance and combination of expert 
knowledge of vehicle road traffic control. In this work, the bi-
directional communication between the Vehicles (V2V), 
between vehicles and Infrastructures (V2I)) is performed 
through Visible Light Communication (VLC), using the street 
lamps and the trafﬁc signaling to broadcast the information. 
Data is encoded, modulated and converted into light signals 
emitted by the transmitters. Tetra-chromatic white sources are 
used, providing a different data channel for each chip. As 
receivers and decoders, SiC Wavelength Division Multiplexer 
(WDM) devices, with light filtering properties, are considered. 
A Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) traffic scenario is proposed, 
and bidirectional communication between the infrastructure 
and the vehicles is tested, using the VLC request/response 
concept. A phasing traffic flow is developed as a proof of 
concept. The experimental results confirm the cooperative 
VLC architecture. A significant increase in traffic throughput 
with the least dependency on infrastructure is achieved.

INTRODUCTION
Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) [1][2][3]. To 
increase the efficiency of traffic management and control, 
many efforts have been made. Two technical challenges 
were considered: trajectory redesign and real-time traffic 
planning. Our goal is to increase the safety and throughput 
of traffic intersections using VLC connected cooperative 
driving. 
For 
vehicular 
communications, 
two 
emerging 
technological trends in the vehicular industry are reshaping 
the physical world, which are corresponding to the self-
driving and remote driving technologies [4][5]. To enable 
both driving technologies, massive Vehicle-to-Everything 
(V2X) communications will be studied and incorporated in 
6G [ 6 ]. V2X communication technologies give new 
possibilities to autonomous cars, since they create the 
opportunity for constant cooperation among different 
vehicles and between vehicles and intelligent road 
infrastructure, thus making tasks like route planning and 
accident avoidance much easier. Communication between 
fixed locations and vehicles is essential to transfer 
information in real time. Here, the communication is 
performed through VLC [7][8] using the street lamps and 
the trafﬁc signaling to broadcast the information.  
The 
proposed 
system 
is 
composed 
of 
several 
transmitters, the street lights and the traffic signals, which 
transmit map information and traffic messages required to 
the moving vehicles. Data is encoded, modulated and 
converted into light signals emitted by the transmitters. 
Then, this information is transferred to receivers installed in 
the vehicles. Tetra-chromatic white sources are used 
providing a different data channel for each chip. The 
receiver modules include a photodetector based on a tandem 
a-SiC:H/a-Si:H pin/pin light controlled filter [9][10][11]. 
In this work, a two-way communication between 
vehicles and the traffic lights is implemented, using VLC. 
The redesign of the trajectory, inside a complex intersection, 
is presented. Street lamps and traffic lights broadcast the 
information. The On-vehicle VLC receivers decode the 
messages and perform V2V distance measurements. An I2X 
traffic scenario is proposed and characterized. A phasing 
traffic flow is developed as a Proof-of-Concept (PoC). The 
arrival of vehicles is controlled and scheduled to cross the 
intersection at times that minimize delays. Delays between 
left-turns and forward movements are also allocated. The 
simulated results confirm that the redesign of the 
intersection and its management through the cooperative 
request/response VLC architecture allows to increase the 
safety and to decrease the trip delay. 
In this paper, a traffic scenario for a light controlled 
crossroad is proposed, along with the transmitter to receiver 
setup. The paper is organized as follow. After the 
introduction (Section I), in Section II, the performance of a 
cooperative driving system is analyzed. To achieve 
cooperative vehicular communications (I2X), streams of 
messages containing the ID physical address of the emitters 
are used, transmitting a codeword that is received and 
decoded by the SiC pin/pin devices. As a PoC, in Section

III, a traffic scenario with bidirectional cooperative 
communication between the infrastructures and the vehicles 
is presented and tested. Finally, in Section IV, conclusions 
are addressed.

VEHICULAR COMMUNICATION 
Vehicular communication using visible light is analysed 
using redesign concepts were the request/response idea 
between the vehicles and the infrastructures is implemented.

This information generates phase durations appropriate 
to accommodate the demand on each cycle. Examples of the 
representation of a redesigned phasing diagram, a functional 
area with two-way-two-way intersection and a timing 
function configuration are presented in Figure 1. In Figure 
1a, a phasing diagram is displayed. Each Timing Function 
(TF) controls only one movement. Since two movements 
can proceed simultaneously without conflict as shown in 
Figure 1b, hence two of the timing functions will always 
have simultaneous control, as exemplified in Figure 1c. The 
problem that the traffic-actuated intersection manager has to 
solve is to allocate the reservations among a set of drivers in 
a way that a specific objective is maximized. Signal timing 
involves the determination of the appropriate cycle length  
and apportionment of time among competing movements 
and phases. The timing apportionment is constrained by 
minimum “green” times that must be imposed to provide 
pedestrians to cross and to ensure that motorist expectancy 
is not violated.  
The use of both navigation and lane control signs to 
communicate lane restrictions is demanding. Downstream 
from that location (request distance in Figure 1b), lane 
restrictions should be obeyed. Vehicles may receive their 
intentions (e.g., whether they will turn left or continue 
straight and turn right) or specifically the need to interact 
with a trafic controler at a nearby crossroad (message 
distance in Figure 1b). In the sequence, a traffic message 
coming from a transmitter nearby the crossroad will inform 
the drivers of the location of their destination (i.e., the 
intended intersection exit leg). 
B.
Virtual V2X scenario . 
To build the I2V, it is proposed a simplified cluster of 
unit square cells in an orthogonal topology that fills all the 
service area. To realize both the communication and the 
street illumination, white light tetra-chromatic sources are 
used providing a different data channel for each chip. At 
each node, only one chip of the LED is modulated for data 
transmission, the Red (R: 626 nm), the Green (G: 530 nm), 
the Blue (B: 470 nm) or the Violet (V) while the others 
provide constant current for white perception. Thus, each 
transmitter, X i,j, carries its own color, X, (RGBV) as well as 
its horizontal and vertical ID position in the surrounding 
network (i,j). In the PoC, was assumed that the crossroad is 
located in the interception of line 2 with column 3, and the 
emitters at the nodes along the roadside (Figure 2).  
The VLC photosensitive receiver is a double pin/pin 
photodetector based on a tandem heterostructure, p-i'(a -
SiC:H)-n/p-i(a-Si:H)-n. [ 12 ][ 13 ]. To receive the I2V 
information from several transmitters, the receiver must be 
located at the overlap of the circles that set the transmission 
range of each transmitter. The nine possible overlaps are 
displayed in Figure 2 for each unit square cell. When a 
probe vehicle enters the streetlight´s capture range, the 
receiver replies to the light signal, and assigns a unique ID 
and the traffic message [14].

.V2X lighting plan model and generated joint footprints in a 
crossroad (LED array=RGBV color spots). 
Four traffic flows were considered: One from West (W) 
with three vehicles (“a”, “c”, “d”) approaching the 
crossroad, Vehicle a with straight movement and Vehicle c
and Vehicle d with left turn only. In the second flow, 
Vehicle b from East (E), approaches the interception with 
left turn only. In the third flow, Vehicle e, oncoming from 
South (S), has e right-turn approach. Finally, in the fourth 
flow, Vehicle f, coming from North, goes straight. Using the 
I2V communication, each street lamp (transmitter) sends a 
message, which is received and processed by a SiC receiver, 
located at the vehicle’s rooftop. Using the headlights as 
transmitters, the information is resent to a leader vehicle 
(V2V) or, depending on the predefined occupied lane, a 
“request” message to go forward or turn right (right lane) or 
to turn left (left lane) is sent directly to a crossroad receiver 
(V2I), at the traffic light, interconnected to a local manager 
that feeds one or more signal heads. For crossroad 
coordination, a emitting local controller located at the light 
signal, sends a “response” message to the intersection 
approaching vehicles. In the following, bidirectional 
communication is stablished (V2I2V). 
To build the V2V system, the follower sends the 
message that is received by the leader and can be 
retransmitted to the next car or to the infrastructure [15]. 
The leader vehicle infers the drive distance and the relative 
speed between them [16]. This information can be directed 
to the next car (V2V) or to an infrastructure (V2I).  
For the intersection manager crossing coordination, the 
vehicle and the intersection manager exchange information 
through two specific types of messages, “request” (V2I) and 
“response” (I2V). Inside the request distance, an approach 
“request” is sent, using as emitter the headlights. To receive 
the “requests”, two different receivers are located at the 
same traffic light, facing the cross roads (local controller of 
the traffic light). The “request” contains all the information 
that is necessary for a vehicle’s space-time reservation for 
its intersection crossing. Intersection manager uses this 
information to convert it in a sequence of timed rectangular 
spaces that each assigned vehicle needs to occupy the 
intersection. An intersection manager’s acknowledge is sent 
from the traffic signal over the facing receiver to the in car 
application of the head vehicle. The response includes both 
the infrastructure and the vehicle identifications and the 
“confirmed vehicle” message. Once the response is received 
(message distance in Figure 1b), the vehicle is required to 
follow the occupancy trajectories (footprint regions, Figure 
2) provided by the intersection manager. If a request has any 
potential risk of collision with all other vehicles that have 
already been approved to cross the intersection, the control 
manager only sends back to the vehicle (V2I) the “response” 
after the risk of conflict is exceeded.  
C.
Coding/decoding Techniques 
To encode the messages, an on-off keying (OOK) 
modulation scheme was used. The codification of the optical 
signals is synchronized and includes the information related 
to the ID position of the transmitters and the message to 
broadcast. We have considered a 32 bits codification as 
described in Figure 3.

Each frame is divided into three or four blocks 
depending on the kind of transmitter: street lamps, 
headlamps (Figure 3a) or traffic light (Figure 3b). We 
assigned the first block to the synchronization (SYNC) in a 
[10101] pattern and the last one to the message to transmit 
(Payload Data). A stop bit is used at the end of each frame. 
Thus, R3,2 , G3,1, and V21 are the transmitted node packets, in

a time slot by the headlamps. In Figure 3b, the second block 
(INFO) in a pattern [000000] means that a response message 
is being sent by the controller manager. Here, the signal 
controller responds to the request of the vehicle located in 
position # 8 (R3,2, G3,3, and V23) at the request time. This 
response is received in the unit cell adjacent to the crossroad 
(message distance, Figure 1b) that shares a common node 
(R3,2) with the request distance (see Figure 2).  
In Figure 4, a MUX signal due to the joint transmission 
of four R, G, B and V optical signals, in a data frame, is 
displayed. The bit sequence (on the top of the figure) was 
chosen to allow all the on/off sixteen possible combinations 
of the four input channels (24).

and the 4 bits binary code assigned to each level is shown. 
For demonstration of the decoding technique, the signal 
transmitted in Figure 3a and received, in the same frame of 
time, is also added (dotted curve). Hence, the signal can be 
decoded by assigning each output level (d0-d15) to a 4- digit 
binary code [XR, XG, XB, XV], with X=1 if the channel is on
and X=0 if it is off.

Figure 5. Normalized MUX signals acquired by a receiver at the 
crossroad, in positions #1, #2, #4, #6 or #8 On the top the transmitted 
channels packets [R, G, B, V] are decoded. 
On the right hand side of the figure, the match between 
MUX levels and the 4 bits binary code ascribed to each 
higher level is shown. Decoding, when the four channels 
overlap (#1), is set on the top of the figure to direct into the 
packet sent by each node. After decoding the MUX signals, 
and taking into account, the frame structure (Figure 3), the 
position of the receiver in the unit cell and its ID in the 
network is revealed [ 17 ]. The footprint position comes 
directly from the synchronism block, where all the received 
channels are, simultaneously, on or off and is pointed out in 
the right hand of Figure 5. For instance, in #4 the maximum 
amplitude detected corresponds to the binary word [1011], 
meaning that it has received the joint transmission from the 
red, blue and violet channels. Each decoded message 
carries, also, the transmitter’s node address. So, the next 
block of six bits gives it ID. In position #4 the network 
location of the transmitters are R3,4 [011;100], B2,4 [010;100] 
and V2,3 [010;011 ]. The last block is reserved for the traffic 
message (Payload data). The stop bit (0) is used always at 
the end of each frame. 
To compute the point-to-point along a path, we need the 
data along the path. Taking into account Figure 1 and Figure 
5, in this example, Vehicle a enters the crossroad in position 
#8 and it goes straight to position #2 (Phase1, TF1), while 
vehicle c turn left, moving across position 1 (Phase2, TF2). 
In Phase3, TF3, Vehicle b, coming from East and Vehicle d
coming from West, both turn left. The speed of Vehicle b 
was reduced, maintaining a safe distance between Vehicle b
and Vehicle a. Results show that, as the receiver moves 
between generated point regions, the received information 
pattern changes. The vehicle speed can be calculated by 
measuring the actual travelled distance overtime, using the 
ID´s transmitters tracking. Two measurements are required: 
distance and elapsed time. The distance is fixed while the 
elapsed time will be obtained through the instants where the

number of received channels changes. Between two 
consecutive data sets, there is a navigation data bit transition 
(channel is missing or added). It was observed that when the 
receiver moves from #8 to # 2 (Figure 7) one ID channels 
was lost (B2,4) and one are added (V2,3). Here, the 4-bynary 
bit code has changed from [1101] to [1110] while Vehicle c
and d change theirs from [1111] to [0011] and Vehicle b to 
[1100]. The spacing between reference points is fixed while 
the correspondent time integrated by the receiver varies and 
depends on the vehicle’s speed. The receivers compute the 
geographical position in the successive instants (path) and 
infer the vehicle’s speed. In the following, this data will be 
transmitted to another leader vehicle through the V2V 
communication or to control manager at the traffic light 
through V2I. 
B.
Cooperative system and phasing diagram 
To model the worst-case scenario, vehicles approaching 
the intersection from different flows are assumed to have a 
conflicting trajectory (Figure 2). Two instants are 
considered for each vehicle, the request time (t) and the 
response time (t’). All the requests contain vehicle positions 
and approach speeds. If a follower exists (Vehicle d), the 
request message from its leader includes the position and 
speed previously received by V2V. This information alerts 
the controller to a later request message (V2I), confirmed by 
the follow vehicle. In the PoC we have assumed that 
ta<tc<td, and ta<tb<tc.

Traffic Signal Phasing in a V2X Communication  
A phasing diagram and a timing function configuration 
were presented in Figure 1, for functional areas with two-

(Figure 2) using the new concept of VLC request/response 
messages. A brief look into the process of timing traffic 
signals is given in Figure 7.

Vehicle x and t’[X] the correspondent response time from the manage 
controller. 
Redesign traffic-actuated controller uses a, b, c, d, e and 
f vehicles requesting and responding message information to 
generate phase durations appropriate to accommodate the 
demand on each cycle. Each driving vehicle is assigned an 
individualized time to request (t) and access (t´) the 
intersection. The exclusive pedestrian stage, “Walk” interval 
begins at the end of Phase 5 (see Figure 1). 
A first-come-first-serve approach could be realized by 
accelerating or decelerating the vehicles such that they 
arrive at the intersection when gaps in the conflicting traffic 
flows and pedestrians have been created. However, a one-
by-one service policy at high vehicle arrival rates is not 
efficient. From the capacity point of view, it is more 
efficient if Vehicle c is given access at t’c before Vehicle b, 
at t’b to the intersection and Vehicle d is given access at t’d
before Vehicle e, at t’e then, forming a west left turn of set 
of vehicles (platoon) before giving way to the fourth phase 
(north and south conflicting flows), as stated in Figure 7.

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents a new concept of request/response 
for the redesign and management of a trajectory in a two-
way-two-way traffic lights controlled crossroad, using VLC 
between connected cars. The connected vehicles receive 
information from the network (I2V), interact with each other 
(V2V) and also with the infrastructure (V2I), using the 
request redesign distance concept. In parallel, a control 
manager coordinates the crossroad and interacts with the 
vehicles (I2V) using the response redesign distance concept. 
A simulated traffic scenario was presented and a generic 
model 
of 
cooperative 
transmission 
for 
vehicular 
communication services was established. As a PoC, a 
phasing 
of 
traffic 
flows 
is 
suggested. 
The 
simulated/experimental results confirmed that the proposed 
cooperative VLC architecture is suitable for the intended 
applications. The introduction of VLC between connected
