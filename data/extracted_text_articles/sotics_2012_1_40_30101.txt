Abstract—Bitcoin is an electronic currency designed to use
a public protocol that implements it in a totally decentralized
manner, so as not to need the control of any central issuing
organization that manages it. Though still in development, it
has been proven to be a modern payment system referred
to have been used in some procedures commonly associated to
money laundering or traﬃcking of illegal substances of various
kinds. Thus, in this article, we analyse those features which
transform such a cryptocurrency in a useful tool to perform
any kind of transactions far from the control of any kind of
regulatory agency, as well as we pinpoint some of the ﬁelds in
which their usage can derive in new illicit behaviours.
Keywords-bitcoin; cryptoanarchism; cryptocurrency; fraud;
speculation; virtual money.
I. Introduction
The phenomenon of virtual coins is neither new nor partic-
ularly recent. The inception of the concept is usually located
in some distribution lists in the mid nineties [1]. Thus,
nowadays, there are lots of virtual currencies being used
with more or less success in the Internet: from Pecunix to
e-gold, passing from all kind of virtual currencies associated
to leisure applications such as Second Life’s Linden Dollars,
whose economy has also been studied by some authors [2],
[3], and the well-known Facebook’s Facebook Credits.
The novelty of Bitcoin —originally created by Satoshi
Makamoto in 2009 [4]— is the fact of being a public
protocol implementing a peer-to-peer-based cryptocurrency.
Its deﬁnition as a distributed currency comes from the
absence of an existing central entity in charge of regulating
either the value or the amount of the total number of existing
coins. It is the network itself, making use of the computa-
tional capacity of its own users, the one that manages and
maintains it. This calculation capacity is used, amongst other
things, to manage the transaction history —what is known
as the block chain— and to conﬁrm and validate each and
every new transactions to be happening in the future.
The characteristics of its distribution protocol are provid-
ing Bitcoin with a strong boost in certain communities in the
internet. In fact, the value of the total transactions performed
annually has raised in 2011 to 150 million dollars as stated
by the website blockchain.info while the protocol manages
peaks of 25,000, 30,000 and even 47,000 daily transactions
as displayed on Figure 1.
Thereby, the remainder of this paper is structured as
follows. Section II states some of the key aspects that make
Bitcoin special. Section III deﬁnes some scenarios in which
the use of this cryptocurrency may lead to illegal behaviours.
Section IV summarises and deﬁnes the main conclusions to
be extracted about this new reality.
II. Bitcoin key features
Against this background, the appearance of a currency
with such special characteristics leads to a new scenario
which possibilities have never been explored before. In
this section, we collect some of the aspects that make this
cryptocurrency a diﬀerentiating factor.
A. Distribution protocol
Its speciﬁc characteristics stablish a particular method for
allocating bitcoins amongst those nodes in the peer-to-peer
network that share computing capacity for the distributed
maintenance of the system. Notwithstanding, the coin assig-
nation process eﬀectiveness is inversely proportional to the
total network’s capacity. By protocol, the maximum number
of total monetary units is set to the amount of 21 million
bitcoins [4] —sometimes represented using the Thai baht
(ISO 4217 code: THB) symbol 
or, in text format,
as BTC—, being reached approximately by 2040. This
deﬁnition of the protocol makes possible to predict the total
number of coins in circulation in any moment of the history.
For instance, by mid-2012, this ﬁgure rounds the 9 million
of already distributed coins, with an estimated value in the
markets of 52.99 million dollars.
By June 2012, the distribution process takes place ap-
proximately every 10 minutes. With that frequence, 50 are
assigned randomly to one of the nodes that have contributed
to solve a given mathematical problem: ﬁnding the result
of a given hash. A hash function is a computable function
that takes as an input a set of elements (usually strings)
and maps them in a ﬁnite output range, typically ﬁxed-
length strings, being theoretically impossible to reverse it.
Thus, the only way of ﬁnding the input of a given hash
is to bruteforce the calculations. The complexity of this
problem is adjusted every two weeks to maintain the rhythm
of 6 handouts per hour. To illustrate this situation, in
the current circumstances, the great amount of connected

devices and the increasing capabilities of the network to
work out this hashes will let a standard user exploiting
not optimized hardware —i3 processor, 4 cores, NVIDIA
GT240 graphic card— and contributing without any kind
of aﬃliation to the development of the network —practice
known as solo mining— to develop a computing capacity
of 20 million hashes solved per second. In other words, this
standard user would receive the mentioned 50 per block
approximately every 11 years. Although we could also use
the processors computing capacity, this chance is deprecated
as it is estimated to be between 30 and 50 times slower
that the one produced by modern graphic cards designed for
GPU computing —8 Intel ® CoreTM i7 processors are hardly
capable of reaching the ﬁgure of 2 million hashes/second—.
In the table I, we show some estimations of the needed time
for the obtention of the 50 depending on the computing
capacity deployed by the user.
This reality has led to the concept of pool mining versus
the already described of solo mining. The philosophy of the
former lies in the grouping of isolated users computer power
under one unique operator with the ﬁnal goal of hoarding
a much greater power to receive the bitcoins assignations
more continuously and relying less on luck. Thus, pool
operators retain a ﬁxed amount —between the 2 and the 10
per cent depending on the mining pool and its distribution
method— in concept of management and maintenance of
the website, resharing the remaining amount proportionally
to the computer power provided by all the users who have
trusted on that operator. Usually, the corresponding traﬃc
runs on port 8,332, but, as a side note, it is true that there
exist some pools that encapsulate Bitcoin traﬃc through port
80 to avoid the blocking of certain ﬁrewalls.
B. Currency exchange markets
There are numerous ways of buying or selling bitcoins.
In fact, in Bitcoincharts [5], more than 50 active markets
were already listed in June 2012, with very diﬀerent avail-
able currencies as shown in Figure 2, but the options are
unlimited: from accessing to exchange websites in which
perform Paypal, Liberty Reserve, WebMoney or OKPay
transferences or executing directly bank transfers depending
on the site (some of the most well-known are MTGox,
Bitcoinmarket or BTC-e); till the acquisition of the gift
vouchers to be used in sites such as eBay, Amazon or
Steam; passing by buying directly any kind of goods and
services in E-Commerce platforms supporting Bitcoin such
as osCommerce, which counts with a plugin that permits the
transferences using Bitcoin since May 2011 [6].
C. Oﬀ-line payments and transactions acceptance period
One of the main problems of using a cryptocurrency is the
need to verify that the coin has not already been previously
used by its owner to perform another transaction. Bitcoin

choose a distributed checking model instead of checking the
legitimacy of its use against a single point.
Thus, this veriﬁcation process requires the disclosure of
the transfer to the rest of the network nodes, which are
responsible for verifying that the given coin has not been
used in more than one occasion by introducing duplication.
To achieve this objective, it is necessary that the charging
platforms were connected, being impossible to conﬁrm
whether a transfer is valid or not if this were not so. This
process often lasts an undeﬁned period of time ranging from
10 to 60 minutes [4]. However, this period is potentially
reducible if it includes the payment of a small commission
to be assigned to that node in the network that is able to
verify the transfer. This fact introduces a new motivation
component for user sharing their computing power whenever
the total amount of bitcoins have been handed out.
D. Transactions tracking
Anyway, the anonymity of the transactions is not guar-
anteed by the protocol itself since this is not its ultimate
goal [4]. In fact, the need for open veriﬁcation requires
the disclosure and publication of every transfer. Recent
studies have used traﬃc analysis tools so as to identify the
called egocentric networks, showing that anonymity is not a
standard pattern in the majority of the transactions [7]:
• In the analysis conducted by Reid et al. [7], a col-
lection of transactions were monitored from an self-
incriminated thief, to whom the authors assume the
interest of remaining anonymous so as not to be tracked.
The point is that the authors were capable of identify
relationships of up to n = 1, 2, 3 hops between the
victim and the alleged cybercriminal.
• Another case brought by the authors referred to the
announcement of Wikileaks to accept anonymous dona-
tions via Bitcoin using a single public key per transac-
tion. The authors call into question the real anonymity
of the donor.
In short, it is assumed that the strength of Bitcoin does not
rely on boostening the anonimity: in fact, the transactions
will be only as anonymous as impossible it were to uniquely
identify the connection of the user that runs them.
III. Prospective on criminal behaviour
The aforementioned characteristics can be exploited in a
healthy and reliable way, but also agglutinate features that
may be exploited in the shadow. In this section, we will
cover some of them.
A. Speculative movements sensitivity
As most economic elements, bitcoins are also sensitive
to radical changes linked to speculation. The exchange of
bitcoins for euros, dollars, pounds or any other cryptocur-
rency is particularly sensitive to speculative movements and
the subjective perception of its value. Figure 3 shows the
evolution of the exchange markets since the birth of the
cryptocurrency till the actual situation. As can be seen,
the perception of their value has markedly ﬂuctuated to
reach the astonishing levels of 25 dollars/bitcoin, ﬁgures far
removed from the far more stabilized 5.3 dollars/bitcoin in
June 2012; identifying around June 2011, what some authors
have deﬁned as the Bitcoin Bubble [8].
Speculation is also present in the long run. Considering a
constantly growing user population over time and knowing
that the total amount of bitcoins ends up being a ﬁnite
number, the value of 1 will tend to represent goods
with increasing value: that is to say, Bitcoin will move
towards becoming an economy with hints of ﬁnally evolving
into a potentially deﬂationary system. The main operational
problem that entails the divisibility of money, is already
tackled by Bitcoin as each coin is divisible up to 10−8 parts.
Or what would be the same, each coin could be divided in
parts equivalent to µ10 (10 nanobitcoins), placing the total
amount of independent coins in 2,100 trillion units.

However, the actual circulation of all coins is an utopia.
The reason for this is the existence of hundreds of coins
which are assigned daily to users who lost or will lose
the control over them for reasons that do not need to be
associated with fraudulent practices:
• It could happen that bitcoins get either lost or forgotten
somewhere inside a legitimate computer.
• This hardware, can also be aﬀected by any kind of
technical issues that may make impossible the recovery
of the cyberwallets.
• It could also happen that the legitimate users would
forget the password that unlocks them.
B. Money laundering and illegal traﬃc
Using online entertainment platforms that somewhat sim-
ulate an internal monetary system to hide certain cyberdelic-
tive behaviours is not a recent issue. Mallada [9] described
how certain criminals have started to exploit the possibilities
oﬀered by some Role-Playing Games (RPG) such as World
of Warcraft or the virtual world of Second Life. For instance,
in the case of the latter, the author estimates its Gross
Domestic Product in $500 million.
Taking into account that Bitcoin develops a payment
system which ﬁnal objective is no longer to simulate but
to substitute traditional currencies, the implications and
chances of the aforementioned potential applications are
even bigger. Even more, despite the characteristics in the
previous subsection which do not make the payment method
intrinsically anonymous, it is true that the performance of
transfers could end being untraceable if some appropriate
preventive measures were taken [10]:
• The performance of transferences behind a proxy or
other anonymisation systems such as networks like Tor.
This is the case of the Silk Road online merchant [11]:
to access to the oﬀered services it is compulsory to be
using the Tor browser so as to preserver the anonymity
of both, buyers and sellers. Already referenced by some
authors as the Amazon of illegal drugs [12], [13], in
some countries such as the USA some policy initiatives
have been carried out to close similar platforms to
prevent the illegal drug traﬃcking [14].
• The execution of n transferences at a time towards an
account that, later and as part of a batch or oﬄine
self-controlled, redistributed the received money in m
diﬀerent accounts. Given a great number of transactions
from a great number of users, it would be virtually
impossible to track the coins from their real owner lost
in a woods of relations. This process, as deﬁned in
Nakamoto’s original description of the system [4], can
take place under the following circumstances: either by
means of individuals oﬀering the chance of voluntarily
increase the anonymity, or by means of organized net-
works oﬀering this and other similar services in a sort of
dark-market operating with cyberwallets in the cloud,
also kwnown as eWallets. These eWallets are Bitcoin
accounts created and managed by third parties which
oﬀer to their users an easier way of keeping in touch
with their bitcoins. However, given the irreversibility
of the transactions, there is no real guarantee that those
transferences performed to or from an eWallet will be
run, apart from the conﬁdence that the user has on the
service itself. A possible scenario may be the following:
1) A big amount of bitcoins is to be sent to a new
eWallet anonymously created using, for example,
tools like Tor, described above.
2) Small transfers are made from such wallet in the
23

cloud to a set of similar eWallets —inside or
outside the original service— before receiving in
a collection of new Bitcoin accounts the money
to operate with them again.
This approach raises points that are likely to require an
automated account management, suggesting a greater
knowledge and better use of the computer tools already
available.
C. Virtual pickpocketing
System features make the coins being stored as .dat ﬁles
in the computers of their owners. Those may make backup
copies to be stored in alternative computers or devices —
or even in the cloud— in order to maintain access to them
whatever kind of failure takes place as this would imply the
automatic loss of the control on the coins as there would be
no way to recover them.
Nonetheless, any user or program with logical access to
the .dat ﬁle could execute transactions on his/her/its own if
this ﬁle has not been adequately protected. Although the
use of the so called military encryption standards —as,
for example, AES-256, the Advanced Encryption Standard
speciﬁcation for encrypting electronic data adopted by the
U.S. government [15], widely considered as a de facto
cryptographic standard— is accessible by any user since
the protocols are public and implemented in numerous
libraries and open-source platforms; it is a standard pattern
coming across with unprotected ﬁles, resulting in a stream
of malware threats uniquely dedicated to stealing these ﬁles.
In this line, Laboratories such as Kaspersky Labs, de-
activated in late March the Command & Control channel
(simplifying, the C&C channel is the tool for managing and
controlling a network of kidnapped computers or botnets,
used in a bunch of diﬀerent criminal ways) of Hlux/Kelihos.
In this case, Hlux was a botnet specialised in stealing Bitcoin
wallets [16], proving that even cybercriminals have found
a new battleﬁeld from which obtain illegal beneﬁts easy to
monetize. Meanwhile, the Sections on ÇyberIntelligence and
Criminal Intelligence of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) stated in a recently ﬁltered intelligence report [17] that
there exist Zeus samples —a Zbot trojan version specialised
in the recruitment of machines as part of a botnet— spe-
cially designed to operate in the shadow using the victim’s
resources in the dark.
D. Unauthorized use of computing power
However, the use of similar networks may also have other
purposes. Similarly to what happens with the distributed
computing projects, could be used downtime CPU or GPU
of infected machines for the generation process of exchange
without the user’s knowledge. Currently, mining of bitcoins
is not considered a proﬁtable business if it is not performed
using the appropriate hardware. In many cases, the revenues
produced in the mining process are not able to cover the
energy costs of the generation.
An important aspect to avoid the detection of any unau-
thorized process is to give the user the fewer indicator
as possible. This also occurs when hiding illegal mining
processes. In this sense, the use of applets which make use
of processor idle time —for example, assigning the mining
processes the lowest possible priority as the Bitcoinplus
miner does— or not exploiting all the capabilities of the
graphics card —avoiding overloading and warming— would
become essential. This may be enough to avoid the end
inexpert user of the machine noticing the symptoms of a
machine being remotely used, unless he/she manually checks
the use percentage of the processor.
In the scenario of a middle-size-botnet compounded
by 10,000 usable computers, and considering a comput-
ing power of an average of the 0.005 bitcoins/day and
machine, the derivated exploitation would round the 50
bitcoins/day—about 200 euros/day in the most common ex-
change markets—. Taking into consideration the dismantling
in 2010 of the botnet Butterﬂy, on a combined action of
Panda Labs along with the Spanish Guardia Civil, and which
size stood at 13,000,000 infected machines, the numbers
speak for themselves about the potential beneﬁt in which
may incur the administrator of such a network. Being able
to exploit these characteristics would make any botmaster
leverage from a seemingly innocuous part of the computing
power of the infected machines obtaining a direct beneﬁt
and increasing artiﬁcially the electric bill of the legitimate
user.
E. A likely jump to the real world
For the writing of this report, the authors have inde-
pendently contacted with certain European business that
publicly state that accept Bitcoin as a payment and which
actually use this cryptocurrency as bait to attract Bitcoin new
customers. In the public list available online in Bitcoin’s
oﬃcial Wiki [18], where the reader can mainly ﬁnd local
hotels and restaurants among other businesses, it becomes
clear that the use of this currency, which in principle might
seem limited to Internet shopping, has surpassed, although
still timidly, the barriers to real world.
Its presence introduces an additional component of com-
plexity in the control of buying and selling process as there
is no oﬃcial entity to recognize its use and, therefore,
there is a full absence of any kind of oﬃcial change in
the diﬀerent central banks. What is more, this may lead
to problems associated to tax evasion and fraud because
of the impossibility of calculating the oﬃcial value of the
transaction in what can be considered, technically, a barter
economy: that is to say, exchanging goods or services for
bitcoins, which may be deﬁned under certain circumstances
as other cryptographic goods with some subjective value.

F. Alternative cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin
Bitcoin’s source code can be widely studied since it is
distributed under the MIT License. This, almost naturally,
has led to various sister cryptocurrencies which implement
speciﬁc characteristics that diﬀerentiate them from the orig-
inal:
• IXcoin (IXC). This is a cryptocurrency with a parallel
development to Bitcoin but scheduled to have a shorter
maturity period, as the maximum number of coins (also
21 million) will have been generated by 2015. This
suggests that speculative movements in the maturation
period of the currency are potentially more violent and
less predictable.
• Devcoin. This is a currency that allocates the 90% of the
resources generated to developers participating in open
source programs so as to fund their work, reserving
only the remaining 10% to the miners.
• Namecoin (NMC). Also based on the architecture of
Bitcoin, the namecoins constitute a currency which
target is creating a domain name system (DNS) using
the .bit TLD. The objective is to provide resources and
tools to protect the community against a censorship to
be potentially applied by a central entity (like ICANN
in the case of domain names). Thus, the .bit domains
are maintained entirely by a Bitcoin-like peer-to-peer
network.
In another development, the philosophy Bitcoin uses to pre-
vent double spending and limit the proliferation of fraudulent
currency has been studied by some authors as Becker et
al. [19] for a generalization and export to other areas that
share similar needs, even beyond the domains management
Namecoin tries to implement.
IV. Conclusion
Though yet in an underground development phase and,
mostly, pretty unknown for the general public, the pro-
liferation of these new payment alternatives brings many
uncertainties. What is more, the intrinsic complexity of
the protocol and the necessity of having some relatively
advanced knowledge on cryptography and computer studies
to understand its real behaviour, make these cryptocurrencies
the perfect place for speculation and misinformation. For
instance, as already stated, there is a widespread belief of
the mere fact of using it is suﬃcient guarantee to perform
anonymous transactions, when this is not true by deﬁnition.
At the same time, the absence of a regulatory central
organism and the chance of not being able to ﬁx the prizes
in a explicit way as it happens with the traditional cryptocur-
rencies, deﬁnes a new scenario on an economy strictly ruled
by the market movements with all the consequences that
this fact leads to in terms of control of massive speculative
eﬀorts. At this point, amongst the possible failure scenarios
the most urgent for Bitcoin, excepting a dramatical reduction
of users which may devaluate the currency once mature, is,
precisely, a global governmental campaign against its use.
Just before the end, we can conclude that there is a
real risk of a recurrent illegal use of the cryptocurrency.
The great number of existing markets and the possibility of
exchanging easily bitcoins by euros, pounds or dollars, make
this new method the perfect vehicle to perform every kind
of transactions related to money laundering or illegal traﬃc
of substances, with all the legal implications associated to
the jurisdictional limitation of the criminal acts performed
in the cyberspace.
