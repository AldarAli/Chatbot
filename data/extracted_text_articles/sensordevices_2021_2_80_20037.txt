Abstract—Monitoring of elderly health in real time could be 
vital in the event of emergency medical incidents and could 
possibly result in saving a person’s life. Researchers are focusing 
on the field of monitoring vital signs in real time via biosensors 
with non-invasive methods, followed by processing and 
assessment of the acquired data. Due to Internet of Things 
technology, vital signs could be gathered and distributed in real 
time to multiple users simultaneously. The main indicators of 
vital signs involve measurements of skin temperature, heart 
rate, blood pressure respiration rate, oxygen saturation, PH 
level, calories, etc. In this paper, we present a novel approach of 
a wearable device fabricated in a flexible substrate that can 
measure such bioindicators and notify caregivers in order to 
assist an elderly person in a potential emergency situation. In 
this paper a wearable vital sign monitoring wearable device is 
presented in order to monitor the physiological state in real 
time.  
Keywords- Internet of Things; homecare elderly; elderly care; 
wearable monitoring; health monitoring system.

 INTRODUCTION  
Recent technological advances that brought about the 
Internet of Things revolution that we are experiencing today 
[1], can provide efficient and innovative solutions to issues 
related to elderly care, taking in the average life expectancy 
[2]. Elderly care facilities are investing in human resources to 
provide high quality treatment to elderly people in need, 
which in many cases is a must for people with continuous 
medical treatment. Caregivers must spend multiple hours 
measuring and recording vital signs of people with high 
probability of human errors through this process. The cost for 
such an institution is highly raised due to the numerous 
personnel needed and the fees for the boarders are raised 
proportionally. Towards this direction, researches have been 
carried out in order to integrate wearable technology in the 
continuous monitoring and precision measuring of the user’s 
vital indicators [3]. 
Wearables have been a growing technology in recent 
decades. More and more are getting involved in our daily life 
in the forms of smartwatches, bands, Virtual Reality glasses, 
etc. This technology provides an easy-to-access method to 
precise recording of vital signs with low cost [4].  
In addition, measuring and monitoring by a sensor device 
could provide stable, long term, continues medical records 
without 
requiring 
personnel 
and 
expensive 
medical 
equipment; moreover, it provides extended freedom of 
movement to the user. These medical records could be stored 
in cloud services 24/7 and prove to be a useful tool for future 
state of health analysis or even for early diagnosis of 
potentially harmful diseases. 
 The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes 
recent advances on wearable systems and devices. Section III 
presents in the first part the wearable device fabricated for the 
purpose of this research and in the second part the monitoring 
system designed for the same reason. Section IV presents the 
results of the measurements and the corresponding procedure. 
Finally, conclusions and future research directions are drawn 
in Section IV. 
II. 
BACKGROUND  
Several research groups have already fabricated wearable 
devices for continuous real time monitoring of vital signs with 
non- invasive technics. 
Duran-Vega et al. [5] created a system for monitoring and 
storing vital signs called “Abuelometro” to assist in an elderly 
care facility. Using the Hexiwear biometric [6] wearable 
device, a platform was fabricated, able to monitor skin 
temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation in real time, as 
well as additional data, such as exercise time, sleep time, meal 
time etc. Relatives and caregivers could have access to that 
information and would be notified in case of an emergency 
condition. 
Kumar et al. [7] demonstrated a wearable device 
measuring blood vessel change via an optical device in real 
time using the Photoplethysmography method. The system is 
separated in 4 main parts, the sensor device, the gateway the 
smartphone app and the cloud server. The device 
communicates with MiWi and BLE protocols to a smartphone 
app through a gateway and the data are uploaded to the cloud 
where they stored and visualized.  
Cohen et al. [8] demonstrated a ring sensor device able to 
measure blood pressure and heart rate using transmission 
Photoplethysmography technique. In their device, an LDR 
and a LED were used to observe the pulses using transmission 
Photoplethysmography while a microcontroller was reading 
the change in the LDR resistance. The accuracy of the device 
prediction exceeds over 90% compared to an average real for 
both systolic and diastolic pressure. 
Zheng et al. [9] demonstrated a cuff-less wearable system 
using pulse arrival time measurements for monitoring blood 
pressure in order to obtain and diagnose hypertension.

Wearable contained of optical Photoplethysmography sensor 
parted from a led and a photodiode and two pieces of 
Electrocardiography patches sewed on the inner side of the 
armband. The receiving signal is amplified and filtered before 
it reaches the microcontroller. After that, data can be stored 
and transmitted via Bluetooth to a smartphone app. The 
system was tested on both healthy and hypertense subjects. 
Gao et al. [10] demonstrated a wearable device capable of 
performing perspiration analysis by sampling human sweat 
and measuring sweat metabolites such as glucose and lactose 
and electrolytes such as potassium and sodium ions. The 
device was placed in a flexible substrate in order to achieve 
contact with human body and a skin temperature sensor was 
used in order to monitor thermal shift. A microcontroller was 
implemented for gathering all the measurements and sending 
the corresponding data to a smartphone app via a Bluetooth 
module. The aim of the researchers was to monitor the 
physiological state of an athlete in real time. 
The devices mentioned above are using Internet of Things 
technology to gather data from the biosensor in order to 
determine and present the physiological state of the user. 
Despite vital signs, it is common to monitor information such 
as environmental conditions, the kinetic changes, or the time 
and duration of the measurements taken from the user. 
Research is continuing in the integration of new biosensor to 
wearable systems in order to improve the quality of the 
measurements and the variety of vital signs collected.  
III. 
WEARABLE DEVICE 
In this section an overview of our approach and the 
corresponding monitoring system will be presented. 
A. Overview of the present approach  
The wearable device fabricated for the purposes of this 
research consisted of both vital sign and environmental 
sensors. The criteria for choosing the sensors are driven by the 
main specifications of the device, which can be analyzed as 
follows: At least two user’s vital signs of the user must be 
monitored, non-invasive methods must be implemented, and 
the device should be flexible and easily fit. Furthermore, the 
final device should be low cost and expandable.  
A schematic indicating the main parts of the proposed 
device is illustrated in Figure 1. The device implements a 
microcontroller 
(atmega328p) 
in 
order 
to 
collect 
measurements, perform calculations and send data via a Wi-
Fi module to a MQTT server in real time. The device is 
powered by 2 Li-po batteries of 400mAh in series. 
All data collected by the microcontroller are processed and 
send in real time to the Wi-Fi module placed in the flexible 
substrate. The Wi-Fi module (esp8266) is constantly 
connected to the internet and posting the measurement 
received by the MCU to a MQTT cloud server. The 
measurements are shortly stored on the server and posted to 
all the subscribers.  
In order to build the device, a commercial Kapton 
substrate was chosen since it provides stability in high 
temperatures and can be commonly found in many 
thicknesses and covering metal layers. A Vishay PT100 
thermistor (100-ohm PTS SMD flat chip temperature 
dependent resistor) was integrated in the above-mentioned 
substrate for skin temperature monitoring. A simple passive 
linear circuit of a voltage divider was used for this purpose, 
with a resistor and a thermistor in series, and the output was 
connected to an ADC channel of the microcontroller. The 
voltage divider transfer function was used for the calculation 
of the thermistor resistance value. 
The person’s heartbeat (also referred as 'pulse') can 
commonly be measured on the wrist or neck. The pulse of a 
person is measured by counting the number of heart beats in 
one minute. Beats per minute measurements were calculated 
using 
a 
non-invasive, 
optical 
sensor, 
using 
the 
Photoplethysmography method [11] to determine the heart 
rate of the user. Specifically, the HRM-2511E optical sensor 
was utilized, which is a transmissive sensor with a 
phototransistor output, emitting at 950nm. The sensor system 
consists of an infrared LED and a photodiode pair in a 
transmissive topology (LED is placed opposite of the 
photodiode, with the finger in between). A proportion of light 
passes through the finger to the photodiode is absorbed by the 
hemoglobin (a protein in red blood cells carrying oxygen) 
resulting to a pulsation relevant to the heart rate. The 
corresponding principle of operation is presented in Figure 2a 
(depicted by [12]). The recorded signal of the photodiode after 
been filtered by a high pass - low pass filter and amplified, 
ends up to the ADC channel of the microcontroller.  
Additionally, a 3-axis accelerometer (ADXL362) with a 
12-bit output resolution was used for precise monitoring of the 
person’s movements. An environmental sensor (HIH6130) 
was used to measure humidity and environmental temperature 
in order to acquire data regarding the user’s background 
conditions. All the parts of the system were fabricated on a 
flexible substrate (Polyimide), so that the device could easily 
fit on a person’s wrist.

B. Monitoring System 
A software written in C, using Arduino and public libraries 
was developed in order to achieve communication among the 
integrated ICs. 
Several protocols were used for the communication of the 
atmega328p microcontroller with the various peripherals. 
More specifically UART was used for esp8266 connection, 
SPI was utilized for ADXL362 communication and I2C was 
implemented for HIH6130 connection. 
Real time monitoring system is based on the MQTT 
protocol. The WIFI module (subscriber) is publishing data on 
an MQTT server (Broker). We used the MQTT cloud server 
of Amazon as a Broker and our device publishes data on it. 
The Node-RED online platform [13] was utilized (as a 
Subscriber), to receive the data acquired by the server. A 
custom user interface called FRED was created for the data 
transferring, visualization and storage. More specifically, we 
develop an interface to visualize the sensor readings, create a 
user’s archive, and alert the caregivers regarding the user 
condition, when potential danger situation is detected. In this 
way, relatives and caregivers could monitor vital signs of elder 
people and become alert to act in case of an emergency. 
 Figure 3 shows a typical representation of the device 
output when it is connected to a user.

of Things wearable device.

RESULTS 
In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed 
device, commercial systems were utilized for reference 
purposes. In our case, the optical sensor’s measurements were 
compared to a commercial band, a Xiaomi Mi smart band 
integrated with a 3-axis accelerometer sensor, a 3-axis 
gyroscope, a Photoplethysmography heart rate sensor and a 
Bluetooth 5 BLE module. The temperature sensor 
measurements were compared to a digital infrared 
thermometer, Mastech MS6522B, simultaneously in four 
different daily routine tasks. During Sleep, at Lunch time, at 
Rest time and during casually exercise. For both test 
scenarios, a series of measurements were taken, up to 1 
minute, and the final result was the average for each task. This 
process was repeated 3 times, over 3 different days to improve 
the reliability of the corresponding evaluation. 
Table 1 and Table 2 present the results for the optical 
sensor and skin temperature evaluation, while Figure 4 
illustrates the corresponding raw data of the accelerometers’ 
signals in all axis. 
Additionally, further processing of the acquiring data could 
occur in order to extract more bio-parameters. For example, by 
integrating a burnt calory counter in the measurements of the 3-
axis sensor stored in the UI platform via the use of open-source 
algorithms, we can determine calories burn. Furthermore, by 
processing the measuring data acquired from the optical sensor, 
the systolic and diastolic pressure [8] can be extracted from the 
average maximum and minimum bits per minute. 
Although the system design was successfully performed, 
there were some limitations that were faced during the procedure. 
The main limitations were focused on the process complexity and 
time, Moreover, the fitting of the optical sensor was also an issue 
mainly in terms of device robustness.  
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
A system for monitoring vital signs of elderly in real time 
was presented. The system is capable of performing real-time 
vital signs monitoring and transferring them to an Internet of 
Things platform for future medical processing and analysis. 
The device is low-cost and could easily be fitted to a 
wristband for daily use due to its flexible substrate. The main 
parts used for the device include several sensors, namely: a 
thermistor, a reflective sensor combined by an IR transmitter 
and a phototransistor, an environmental sensor and an 
accelerometer. Those parts were connected directly to the 
MCU, which processes and transmits the data via a Wi-Fi 
module to a Web server using the MQTT communication 
protocol and presented the results in a web UI. 
The measurements took place for 4 different body states and 
during 3 different days. The preliminary data demonstrate the 
ability of the device to successfully monitor predefined 
biosignals and its potential to discriminate among various 
activities of people.
