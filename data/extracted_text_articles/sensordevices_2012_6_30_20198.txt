Abstract — A novel optical fiber having its cladding doped with 
Au nano-particles was developed by modified chemical vapor 
deposition process. Absorption peaks of the optical fiber 
preform and the fiber appearing at 585 nm and 428 nm, 
respectively were due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of 
the incorporated Au nano-particles in the cladding. The 
measured peak wavelength of the SPR was found to increase 
from 480.9 nm to 505.5 nm with refractive index (n) from 1.406 
to 1.436 and the SPR sensitivity was estimated to be 820 
nm/RIU.  
Keywords - nano-particles; cladding-doped optical fiber; 
absorption;  surface plasmon resonance.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, optical fiber sensors based on surface plasmon 
resonance (SPR) have gained attraction of scientists and 
engineers due to their all-optical remote sensing capability to 
measure various chemical, physical, and biological quantities 
[1-11]. SPR sensing phenomenon of the optical fiber can be 
divided into two categories, a propagating SPR and a 
localized SPR. The former can be obtained from thin metal 
coating onto the surface of optical fiber and a surface 
plasmon comes from extended charge waves traveling on the 
interface of metal and glass that are excited when dispersion 
of output light matches with that of incident light. Therefore, 
it is evanescent electromagnetic waves bounded by metal-
glass interfaces induced by oscillations of the conduction 
electrons in the metal [12-14]. The latter is usually observed 
by confined colloidal, periodic, nano-systems [6][14-25], and 
a localized surface plasmon gets resonantly excited when the 
wavelength of incident light is equal to the characteristic 
wavelength of metal nano-particles [11-14]. It comes from 
confined conduction electrons oscillating in resonance with 
the electromagnetic field. In general, the excitation of surface 
plasmon is known to occur when the wave vector of the 
propagation constant of evanescent wave exactly matches 
with that of the surface plasmon of similar frequency and 
state of polarization. This occurs at a particular angle of 
incidence and the corresponding resonance condition for 
surface plasmons. The sharp absorption peak is observed at 
resonance angle because of reduction in the energy of the 
reflected light due to its energy transfer to surface plasmons. 
The resonance angle is very sensitive to variation in the 
refractive index of the sensing layer [1-5][8-11]. 
Optical fiber sensors based on SPR usually use thin metal 
film or nano-particles of Au or Ag because these noble 
metals present a sharp and intense plasmonic band in their 
internal 
reflectance 
spectrum 
when 
excited 
in 
the 
Kretschmann configuration of SPR [1-5][12-14]. To increase 
the sensitivity of optical fiber based SPR sensor, various 
configurations of optical fiber such as polished fiber, tapered 
fiber, grated fiber and coated fiber have been suggested [1-
8][10-12][16]. 
Also, 
to 
improve 
the 
SPR 
sensing 
performance, 
effect 
of 
size, 
thickness, 
shape, 
and 
composition of plasmonic materials have been studied [4-
6][25-28]. Despite all the efforts, however, optical fiber SPR 
sensors with controlled coating parameters have limitations: 
handling difficulty, difficulty of mass production, and high 
manufacturing cost.  
In this paper, we developed a novel optical fiber 
incorporated with Au nano-particles (NPs) in cladding region, 
which is the first in the world to the best of our knowledge, 
allowing simple fabrication process due to no metal coating 
needed, mass production and compatibility with the existing 
SPR probe. Optical fiber sensor based on SPR of the 
fabricated fiber was demonstrated and in particular effect of 
environmental refractive index change on the SPR 
characteristics was investigated.

doping solution was prepared by dissolving 0.025 mole of 
reagent grade Au(OH)3 powder (Aldrich Chem. Co. Inc., 
99.9 %) in nitric acid solution (Junsei Co., 70 %). To make a 
solid glass rod, known as a preform, the porous germano-
silicate layers were deposited onto the inner surface of a 
silica glass tube by using primarily silicon tetrachloride 
(SiCl4) and germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4) in MCVD 
process. To incorporate Au NPs, the porous deposition layers 
were soaked with Au doping solution for two hours and the 
tube was dried and sintered. Then a silica glass rod 
(refractive index, n = 1.4571 @ 633 nm) was inserted in the 
tube and consolidated into a rod to obtain a fiber preform. To 
reveal the doped layers to surface of the rod as a cladding, 
the outer part of the glass rod that was the silica glass tube, 
was etched off using hydrofluoric acid solution (J. T. Baker, 
49%). The final preform consisted of the cladding doped 
with Au NPs in germano-silicate glass and the core of pure 
silica glass. Finally, the fiber preform was drawn into a fiber 
with 124.3 µm in diameter using the draw tower at 2150 °C. 
During the drawing process, the fiber was coated with lower 
refractive index polymer (EFIRON UVF PC-375, n = 1.3820) 
than that of the germano-silicate glass of the cladding to

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the measured refractive

Successful removal of the silica glass tube by the etching 
process was indicated by the measured indices of the 
preform and the fiber as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, 
respectively. The refractive index difference between the 
core and cladding was about 0.00125, enabling light signal to 
propagate into the cladding region not into the core, as 
shown in Figure 4. The cladding width and total diameter of 
the optical fiber were 2.6 μm and 124.3 μm, respectively. To 
confirm formation of Au NPs in the cladding, the optical 
fiber preforms were examined by transmission electron 
microscope (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-TWIN) and UV-
VIS spectrophotometer (Varian, Cary500Scan). Optical 
absorption of the optical fibers was also measured to confirm 
the propagation of light and the existence of Au NPs by the 
cut-back method using the Optical Spectrum Analyzer (Ando 
AQ 6315B). Then, to characterize SPR sensing property, 
optical absorption of the fiber was measured by putting small 
drops of the refractive index matching oil with various 
refractive indices (n = 1.406 - 1.436) on the surface of the 
fiber. The total and detector length of the fiber used for the 
SPR measurement are 50 cm and 5 cm, respectively, as 
shown in Figure 5.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Figure 6 compares the UV-VIS spectra of the optical 
fiber preform incorporated with and without Au NPs. The 
absorption band centering at 585 nm was found to appear 
after the incorporation of Au NPs and it was attributed to Au 
NPs in the cladding region of the preform [29-31]. The 
existence and size distribution of Au NPs of the preform was 
verified by the TEM morphology of the fiber preform, as 
shown in Figure 7. The Au NPs was found to be crystalline 
and the rather spherical particles were dispersed 
homogeneously without agglomeration. The average

diameter of Au NPs was ~ 3.8 nm (2.5 nm ~ 5.2 nm). Note 
that peak position of the optical absorption is known to 
depend on the particle size of Au metals [31-33].  
In the case of optical fiber, which was drawn from the 
fiber preform incorporated with Au NPs, the existence of Au 
NPs was verified by optical absorption spectra, as shown in 
Figure 8. Absorption peaks appeared at 428 nm and 1380 nm 
and they are due to surface plasmon resonance from Au NPs 
and OH impurities, respectively [30-34]. Note that to extract 
the absorption peak from the detector noise, we performed 
the spectral decomposition and denoising by using the 
OriginPro-8.6 code, which clearly distinguishes the 
absorption peak at 428 nm as shown in Figure 9. 
As per earlier reported work, the Au NP related 
absorption peak has been observed at around 520 nm; 
however we measured the absorption peak at 585 nm in the 
optical fiber preform. Moreover, the absorption peak due to 
Au NPs was found to shift to shorter wavelength of 428 nm 
in the optical fiber as compared to 585 nm peak in the

preform. As we needed to heat the fiber preform at 2150 °C 
to draw the fiber, Au NPs size would increase due to the 
growth of Au NPs after the high temperature drawing 
process. Thus, our sample showed the blue-shift of Mie 
resonance absorption peak with increment in the size of 
nano-particles, which is quite opposite behavior where 
increment in nano-particles size gives red shift in the 
absorption peak [35-37].  
The blue-shift of SPR peak with the increase of nano-
particles size is not a new behavior, it has been already 
reported for Au particles in Au-alumina composite film [38] 
and Au NPs dispersed within pores of porous silica [31-33]. 
The peak position from Mie resonance is almost independent 
of the size of Au particles in the range from 4 to 25 nm (by 
using the dielectric constant of Au [31][39][40]. The blue-
shift can be thought to be due to association with the 
boundary coupling (interface interaction) between Au 
particles within the pores and pore walls of porous silica [31]. 
Usually, a small lattice contraction yields to the high surface-
to-volume ratio and, hence, high surface energy (surface 
tension) for metal NPs. The lattice dilatation in [31-33], it is 
probably related to the decreased surface energy of Au 
particles via boundary coupling. It is well known that at the 
surface of small particles, there exist many dangling bonds 
(unsaturated bonds). In other words, the extension of 
electronic wave function outside particles surface becomes 
significant for small particles. Thus, interactions at the 
particles’ surface are inevitable due to the high activity, and 
charge transfer from metal particles to the matrices occurs 
during interface interaction. This charge transfer can induce 
a decrease of the free electron density in metal particles. 
Therefore, the blue-shift occurs with the increase of Au 
particle size due to the electron charge transfer from Au 
particles to the silicate glass host at the interface. 
Figure 10 shows the absorption spectra of the optical 
fiber after dropping the index matching oils (n = 1.406 - 
1.436) to confirm the SPR and its dependence of 
environmental change. Because of noisy behavior of the 
output spectrum, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) filtering 
method was adopted to locate peaks. The SPR band was 
found to occur at a particular wavelength around 500 nm for 
the corresponding refractive indices, increased with the 
increase of the index [1, 3][8-11]. The measured peak 
wavelength of the SPR band were at 480.9 nm, 483.3 nm, 
494.4 nm, and 505.5 nm with refractive indices (n) 1.406, 
1.416, 1.426, and 1.436, respectively as shown in Figure 11. 
The observed red-shift of the SPR band with the increase of 
the refractive index of matching oils is related to the angle of 
incident light, increased with the increase of refractive index 
[1-3][8-11]. The shift of the Au plasmon peak towards a 
longer wavelength with the increase of the medium 
refractive index can be understood by the well-known Mie 
theory. It is noted that the absorption peak of the fiber coated 
with low-index polymer (n=1.382) appearing at 428 nm due 
to surface plasmon resonance from Au NPs was also found 
to shift to ~ 500 nm after dropping the index matching oils, 
which is basically an extension phenomenon by the Mie 
theory. The SPR sensitivity (wavelength/RIU), which is the 
slope of Figure 11, of the optical fiber incorporated with Au

NPs was estimated to be 820 nm/RIU. Indeed, the SPR 
sensitivity of optical fiber sensor based on glass optical fiber 
incorporated with Au NPs in the cladding region is smaller 
than that of the conventional Au thin film based optical fiber 
SPR sensor, which has about 9,630 nm/RIU [41]. However, 
820 nm/RIU is still a valuable level to identify the possibility 
of a new type fiber SPR sensor for its advantage of mass 
production. In this paper, we have focused on the fabrication 
of specialty optical fiber incorporated with Au NPs in 
cladding region for SPR sensor applications, which is the 
first in the world to the best of our knowledge. Increase of 
the sensitivity of the sensor is under progress and will be 
communicated in future.  
It is noted that the increase in intensity and width of the 
SPR absorption band was also found to be 1.5 dB and 91 nm 
(after baseline correction), respectively with the increase of 
the refractive index from 1.406 to 1.436. The broadening of 
the SPR absorption may be due to the spatial spreading and 
scattering of the conduction electrons [42].

The proposed fiber sensor based on optical fiber 
incorporated with Au NPs in the cladding region has the 
clear advantages over the conventional Au thin film based 
optical fiber SPR sensor such that the bulk metal film coating 
is not necessary after post-processings of fiber polishing and 
tapering to satisfy the phase matching criterion for excitation. 
Since no metal coating is needed for the sensor, mass 
production with simple fiber fabrication is possible and 
compatibility with the existing SPR probe is secured. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
We developed and demonstrated specialty optical fiber 
incorporated with Au NPs in cladding region for SPR sensor 
applications. The optical fiber incorporated with Au NPs in 
cladding region was fabricated by using the modified 
chemical vapor deposition (MCVD) and the fiber drawing 
process. Porous germano-silicate layers were deposited onto 
the inner surface of a silica glass tube and the layers were 
soaked with Au doping solution to incorporate Au NPs 
followed by drying and sintering. Then a silica glass rod 
(refractive index, n = 1.4571 @ 633 nm) was inserted in the 
tube and consolidated into a rod and the outer silica glass 
was etched off to obtain a fiber preform incorporated with 
Au NPs in cladding region. Finally, the fiber preform was 
drawn and coated with the lower refractive index polymer 
(EFIRON UVF PC-375, n = 1.3820) than that of the 
cladding to obtain a fiber with the cladding width of 2.6 μm 
and total diameter of 124.3 μm.  
The measured SPR absorption band centered at 585 nm 
of the optical fiber preform was attributed to the large 
concentration of the Au NPs with the average diameter of 3.8 
nm.  In the case of the fiber, the SPR absorption peak due to 
Au NPs was found to shift to 428 nm as compared to 585 nm 
of the preform. This blue-shift is due to the increase of the 
particle size through the growth of the Au NPs during the 
fiber drawing process at 2150 °C, the absorption band of Au 
NPs within pores of porous silica yielded the significant 
blue-shift, which was interpreted in terms of interface 
interactions between Au NPs and silica glass host. The blue-
shift of the absorption band in the present study may 
originate from the electron transfer from Au particles to the 
silica host during interfacial interaction.  
The SPR absorption peak due to Au NPs in the bare 
optical fiber was found to appear at 428 nm. When the index 
matching oils was dropped onto the fiber, the SPR was found 
to occur at a particular wavelength around 500 nm. The 
measured peak wavelength of the SPR increased from 480.9 
nm to 505.5 nm with refractive index (n) from 1.406 to 1.436. 
The SPR sensitivities of the optical fiber incorporated with 
Au NPs in cladding region was estimated to be 820 nm/RIU.
