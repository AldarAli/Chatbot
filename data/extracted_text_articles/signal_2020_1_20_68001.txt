Abstract—The global stability of continuous-time fractional 
orders nonlinear feedback systems with positive linear parts is 
investigated. New sufficient conditions for the global stability 
of these class of positive nonlinear systems are established. The 
effectiveness of these new stability conditions is demonstrated 
on a simple example.

order; 
positive;  
nonlinear; feedback system. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In positive systems inputs, state variables and outputs 
take only nonnegative values for any nonnegative inputs and 
nonnegative initial conditions [1][4][9]. Examples of positive 
systems are industrial processes involving chemical reactors, 
heat exchangers and distillation columns, storage systems, 
compartmental systems, water and atmospheric pollution 
models, and so on. A variety of models having positive 
behavior can be found in engineering, management science, 
economics, social sciences, biology and medicine. An 
overview of state of the art in positive systems theory is 
given in the monographs [1][4][9][13][18]. 
Mathematical fundamentals of the fractional calculus are 
given 
in 
the 
monographs 
[13][18][23][24]. 
Positive 
fractional linear systems have been investigated in 
[3][5][7][10]-[14][17][21][24][25][26]. 
Positive 
linear 
systems with different fractional orders have been addressed 
in [10][11][28]. Descriptor positive systems have been 
analyzed in [2][28]. Linear positive electrical circuits with 
state feedback have been addressed in [2][18]. The 
superstabilization of positive linear electrical circuits by state 
feedback has been analyzed in [16] and the stability of 
nonlinear systems in [17][18]. The global stability of 
nonlinear systems with negative feedback and not necessary 
asymptotically stable positive linear parts has been 
investigated in [6][8]. The global stability of nonlinear 
standard and fractional positive feedback systems has been 
considered in [15]. 
In this paper, the global stability of nonlinear fractional 
orders feedback systems with positive linear parts will be 
addressed. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the basic 
definitions and theorems concerning the positive different 
fractional orders linear systems are recalled. New sufficient 
conditions for the global stability feedback nonlinear systems 
with positive linear parts are established in Section 3. 
Concluding remarks are given in Section 4.

CONCLUSIONS 
The global stability of continuous-time different fractional 
orders nonlinear feedback systems with positive linear parts 
and positive scalar feedback has been investigated. New 
sufficient conditions for the global stability of this class of 
positive nonlinear systems have been established (Theorem 
6). The effectiveness of these new stability conditions has 
been demonstrated on simple a example of positive 
nonlinear different orders system. The considerations can be 
extended to discrete-time standard fractional different orders 
nonlinear systems with positive linear parts and scalar 
feedback. An open problem is an extension of the 
considerations to nonlinear different orders fractional 
systems with interval matrices of their positive linear parts.
