Abstract— Survey agencies in the United States continue to 
move many map-based surveys from paper to handheld 
computers.  With large highly diverse workforces, it is 
necessary to test software with a diverse population.  The 
present work examines the performance of participants 
grouped by their level of spatial visualization.  The 
participants were tested in either the field or in a fully 
immersive virtual environment. The methodology of the study 
is explained.  The performance of the participants in the two 
environments is modeled with least squares regression.  Results 
of the study are presented and discussed.  
Keywords- map-based survey; virtual reality; spatial ability 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
     Survey agencies in the United States have been moving 
towards using handheld computers to replace the use of 
paper in their field operations.  Since most field surveys are 
inherently location dependent, a lot of the software used will 
be map-based.  Agencies, like the Bureau of Census, are 
forced to couple this move to map-based software with a 
highly diverse workforce, especially in large scale 
operations like the decennial census.  Due to the wide range 
of individual differences typically encountered in such 
diverse workforces, software testing is a critical component 
of this process.  Ultimately, the software has to be tested in 
the field to fully understand how it will perform.  However, 
a significant issue with testing in the field is the cost.  An 
interesting question is the viability of doing at least the 
initial testing of software in a virtual environment. 
 
     In the present work a study is described that looks at the 
participant’s performance in either the field or in a fully 
immersive virtual environment.  The task chosen for the 
study was address verification, where a census worker is 
given a list of addresses and they are expected to either 
determine the address is correctly located on their map or 
make the necessary corrections. The contribution of this 
paper is the direct comparison of a complex real world 
operation performed in both the field and virtual reality.  
This initial study didn’t show very much difference between 
performance in the field and virtual environments.  We did 
see a significant impact of the role that spatial visualization 
played in both environments. 
 
     In the remainder of the paper we look at related work, 
examine the methodology used in the study, present the 
statistical results, and provide a discussion of what we 
found. 
II. BACKGROUND 
 
      Wobbrock et al. [24] proposed ability-based design as a 
paradigm for constructing individual-centric systems.    
According to Murray & Kluckhohn [18],”Every man is in 
certain respects (a) like all other men, (b) like some other 
men, (c) like no other man” (p.35).  Benyon, Crerar, & 
Wilkinson [3] predicated the prominence of cognitive 
differences in human-computer interaction on the divide 
between physical and digital artifacts and noted that 
cognitive differences may have amplified effects in 
computing contexts (pp. 21-22).   
 
     Spatial ability is a compound factor that has often been 
linked to performance in interactive tasks. Several authors 
have used factor-analytic techniques to decompose spatial 
ability into constituents.  In the nineties, [5] and [16] 
reported that it consists of five parts: spatial visualization, 
speeded rotation, closure speed, closure flexibility, and 
perceptual speed. Earlier publications by [6] and [20] 
suggested other combinations. Spatial visualization ability–
defined by [9] (p. 173) as “the ability to manipulate or 
transform the image of spatial patterns into other 
arrangements”–has 
been 
shown 
to 
correlate 
with 
performance with command-line interfaces [11, 4], file 
system navigation [22], searching an information retrieval 
system [8], web browsing [25], simulated driving [1], and 
remote control of robots [15].   
 
      Beyond the combination of software and hardware, we 
also need to consider the field operating environment, which 
presents a multitude of stimuli and a continuously changing 
external context, unlike the traditional computer desktop. 
Whether a field setting can be reasonably approximated in a 
laboratory virtual environment is still an open question. Ref. 
[17] highlights the tradeoff between experimental control 
and ecological validity in traditional research methods and 
suggest that improved-fidelity virtual reality may reduce the 
compromise.  If correct, their claim has practical 
implications, as well: virtual reality may become a low-cost 
alternative for field training.  Two components that 
distinguish reality from a virtual environment are distance 
perception [23] and embodiment [2]. Ref. [10] compared 
environmental learning from the real world, non-interactive 
274

video, and a desktop virtual environment, concluding that 
spatial ability is correlated with learning in both the real 
world and virtual environment, with a stronger effect for the 
desktop simulation.  Ref. [21] compared walking patterns in 
reality and on a treadmill in non-immersive virtual setting, 
noting persisting small differences in gait after 20 minutes 
of acclimatization.  Ref. [19] showed that increasing display 
size and resolution improved wayfinding and object location 
performance in a non-immersive virtual setting. The 
outcomes in these publications suggest that as we improve 
visualization and locomotion technologies, we may be able 
to run virtual reality experiments approaching ecological 
validity.  Refs. [13] and [14] used a study design that 
appears similar to ours but was driven by a different agenda.  
The authors constructed a high-fidelity virtual reality model 
of a residential area in the United Kingdom and asked 27 
participants to navigate to five locations inside an 
immersive environment designed by [7]. Participants had 
access to schematic maps, detailed maps, and written and 
spoken route instructions on a handheld device that served 
as a pathfinding aid.  The authors described three different 
pathfinding behaviors, noted geographical hot spots for 
handheld device activity and per-destination aggregate 
device activity. The focus of the research was on linking 
location to handheld usage, and the authors did not report 
measures of statistical validity.   In contrast, we set out to 
find statistical evidence for performance differentials on a 
software map task.  Our experiment includes both a virtual 
reality and a field setting.  Additionally, our task is a 
software task that has a navigation component.  Finally, the 
virtual environment in [13, 14] had a lesser degree of 
immersion, because participants navigated with a joystick 
and the virtual model was projected on up to three VR 
walls. 
III. MATERIALS AND METHOD 
 
      The experiment contained a screening phase and an 
exercise phase.   
 
A. Screening phase 
 
      During the screening phase, one-hundred-and-twenty-
four participants were individually assessed on spatial 
visualization, visual memory, perceptual speed, and 
perspective-taking ability. The tests were VZ-2, MV-2, and 
P-2 given in [9], and the perspective-taking assessment 
described in [12]. Participants with spatial visualization 
scores greater than or equal to 15 or less than 9 (out of 20) 
were randomly assigned to one of two treatments in the 
exercise phase.  Pairs from either the low or high spatial 
visualization groups were randomized together, allowing 
each participant a 0.5 probability of assignment to either be 
tested in the virtual reality treatment or the field treatment. 
Thirty-two participants (14 males, 18 females) were 
assigned to the second phase of the experiment. 
 
B.  Field phase 
 
      For the field treatment, 15 participants (8 males, 7 
females) were taken individually to the same spot in a 
residential neighborhood in Ames, Iowa. They were first 
trained on using the handheld device, locating addresses in 
the field, and the think-aloud protocol.  An observer 
provided them with a stylus and a handheld computer: a 
Pharos Traveler 535x with a 240x320, 3.5” transflective 
screen and a 624 MHz Intel PXA270 processor.  The 
observer explained the address verification task. 
 
      Participants would have to physically walk to an address 
in order to answer the question. If the map contained errors, 
they had to use the software’s editing features to position 
the address at the correct location or remove it altogether.  
Four outcomes were possible. An address needed to either 
be added to the map, deleted, moved to a new location, or 
confirmed without changing the map.  Participants were told 
to only correct the addresses in their task list and to ignore 
other possible errors on the map. (The map contained no 
errors outside of scenario addresses.)  Participants were then 
taught how to edit the software map and were also 
instructed to verbalize all their thoughts for a think-aloud 
protocol.  The map software was started in training mode 
and participants were asked to locate and verify three 
training addresses in the immediate vicinity, while the 
observers answered procedure questions and provided 
feedback on the quality of the think-aloud.  At the end of the 
training session, observers answered the participant’s final 
questions, and also explained that observers would not talk 
during the actual exercise, other than to prompt the 
participant to keep verbalizing or to ask about behavioral 
details. Observers then returned the participant to the 
location where all trainees started, switched the map 
software to experiment mode, and started an audio recorder 
(worn by the participant) and a GPS tracker (carried by the 
observer).  The GPS tracker was not given to the participant 
so that they would not be interrupted to time-stamp address 
completions.  
 
     All participants verified the same six addresses off of an 
identical randomized list order (Figure 2), and therefore 
could not benefit from completion sequence hints. The list 
could be viewed at all times in the software by tapping the 
currently selected address.  Errors for each address in the 
task list are shown in Figure 1.  Participants were allowed to 
work on addresses in any order and could return to 
previously submitted addresses as many times as they 
wanted.  Only final answers were evaluated for correctness.      
When finished, participants were then taken to two locations 
on the map and asked to point in the direction of the starting 
spot. 
 
Finally, 
observers 
audio-recorded 
an 
exit 
questionnaire detailing the participant’s perceptions of the 
study.

C. Virtual reality phase 
 
      Seventeen participants (6 males, 11 females) were 
randomly assigned to the virtual reality treatment and were 
taken individually to the VRAC C6 immersive virtual 
reality environment on the Iowa State University campus.   
 
Virtual reality model-The virtual setting loaded in the 
environment was a high-fidelity three-dimensional model of 
the residential area portrayed in Figure 1, with an additional 
block modeled outside the westernmost and easternmost 
extents of the map.  The model was created in SketchUp 
(www.sketchup.com) and imported into the virtual reality 
environment through VR Juggler (www.vrjuggler.org). 
Housing units and streets were georeferenced. However, 
actual housing units were represented by house models of 
similar size and style selected from Sketchup’s repository of 
three-dimensional housing models (sketchup.google.com/ 
3dwarehouse/).  The neighborhood model also incorporated 
notable landmarks in the area, such as, street signs, curbs, 
textured surfaces, a day sky with sun, trees, shrubs, a 
playground, and a large building on the Iowa State 
University campus that was visible in some parts of the 
study area.  The model did not include sidewalks, but did 
represent multi-lane streets and split boulevards, keeping 
throughway widths consistent with reality.  
 
Virtual reality equipment-The virtual reality room is a cube 
with dimensions 3.05 x 3.05 x 3.05 m.  Each of the four 
walls, floor, and ceiling displayed stereo images of 4096 x 
4096 pixels at approximately 16 frames per second.  Video 
projection is driven by a cluster of 48 HP xw9300 
workstations with 96 nVidia Quadro graphics cards sending 
video frames to 24 Sony SRX-S105 digital cinema 
projectors.  InterSense’s IS-900 tracking system tracked the 
participant’s head location and gaze direction, and the stereo 
perspective dynamically shifted with the user’s gaze.  The 
participants wore active stereo glasses.  
 
Moving in virtual reality-Movement in the environment was 
accomplished by stepping towards the desired direction.  A 
circular spot in the center of the floor, approximately 0.6 m 
in diameter, was the “dead zone”. If the participant’s head 
was located in the column of the spot, all movement 
stopped.  Stepping outside the dead zone would start 
moving the virtual reality model in the opposite direction of 
the step, giving the illusion of the participant moving 
through the model in the direction of the step. As the 
participant stepped closer to the walls, movement speed 
increased, from approximately 0.1 m/s to a maximum of 
approximately 2.22 m/s (8 km/h or 5 mi/h).  We fixed the 
maximum speed to a slow trot, because we were concerned 
that a higher speed could not be encountered in the range of 
walking speeds available to participants in the field 
treatment, and a lower maximum speed might bore 
participants, causing them to lose focus. 
 
Protocol changes-Study protocol was exactly the same as in 
the field treatment, but prior to introducing the handheld 
device, participants were trained on moving inside the 
virtual environment.  Participants also started training and 
the exercise at the same geographic spot in the virtual model 
as participants in the field. 
 
Data collection and analysis-We tracked: distance traveled 
via GPS and virtual movement logs, time taken to complete 
the task, and number of addresses incorrectly verified 
(number of task errors). The virtual reality model was 
georeferenced, so travel coordinates within the immersive 
environment reflected actual distances.  Additionally, we 
recorded all handheld software actions and user speech from 
the end of the training session to the end of the exit 
questionnaire. 
 
We used least squares regression to explore 
statistical relationships among the data.  Our response 
variables were distance traveled, time taken to complete the 
task, and number of errors.  Predictor variables included 
spatial visualization category (low or high); field/virtual 
environment category; gender; perceptual speed, visual 
memory, and perspective-taking scores; and zoom, pan and 
map reset actions.   
 
We hypothesized that: 
 
Hypothesis 1: High-spatial-visualization participants would 
travel significantly shorter distances than low-spatial-
276

visualization participants in both the field and virtual 
environments. 
Hypothesis 2: High-spatial-visualization participants would 
take significantly less time than low-spatial-visualization 
participants in both the field and virtual environments.

       In addition, we expected that there would be some 
impact on the participants between treatments, especially 
the participants with low spatial visualization in the virtual 
environment. 
 
IV. RESULTS 
 
     The results reported in this paper are based on least 
squares regression models.  The focus has been to look at 
two slightly different sets of variables.  The first model 
looks at how a set of variables based on the environment 
and the participant impact performance measures (e.g., time 
and distance), while the second model adds a software 
flavor to the analysis by adding a variable that incorporates 
map resets and pans. 
 
A. Regression based on Environment and Participants 
 
      The first model examines the impact of the environment 
(E = 0 Field or 1 Virtual), spatial ability (S = 0 High 
Visualization or 1 Low Visualization), and gender (G = 0 
Female or 1 Male) on time and distance.   
 
      In particular we looked at Y = E + S + E*S + G, where 
Y is the prediction of either log(time) or log(distance) and 
E*S is the interaction of the environment and the 
participant’s spatial ability assignment. 
 
     The regression results for log(time) and log(distance) are 
shown in Tables I and II, respectively.

      The most interesting aspect of the results shown in the 
two tables is the significance of the participants’ level of 
spatial ability in both results (Pr(>|t|) = 0.014 and 0.026, 
respectively.  The regression model for distance (Table II) is 
suggestive that the interaction of E and S is important with 
Pr(>|t|) = 0.062.   
 
      The box plots for log(Time) and log(Distance) mediated 
by the interaction are shown in Figures 4 and 5, 
respectively.  While the box plots don’t provide too much 
information, they do provide some insight.  First, in Figure 
5 it appears that high spatial participants in the virtual 
environment traveled greater distances than the high spatial 
participants did in the field.  The log(Time) boxplot (Figure 
4) is suggestive that spatial ability is important in terms of 
277

the time taken (log(Time)).  Such a result makes sense in 
light of the significance of spatial ability seen in Table I.

Figure 5. Boxplots for log(Distance) vs E*S. 
 
B. Including Software Operations in the Regression 
 
      To bring the software performance of the participants 
into the regression model, we defined a variable (Resetpan) 
as a measure of how many times a participant interacted 
with the map on the handheld device.  Formally, ResetPan is 
defined by 
Resetpan=0.5(Resets-mean(Resets)/sd(Resets) + 
Pans-mean(Pans)/sd(Pans)). 
The choice of map resets and pans was motivated by the 
experiment observers’ experience in both the field and 
virtual environments.   Tables III, IV, and V show the 
regression results for the least squares regression models for 
log(Time), log(Distance), and Errors, respectively.

       From the results in the three tables, it appears that the 
spatial ability levels of the participants was again an 
important variable as it is significant for log(Time) (Pr(>|t|) 
= 0.034 in Table III) and for Errors (Pr(>|t|) = 0.045 in 
Table V).  It was also suggestive for log(Distance) (Pr(>|t|) 
= 0.064 in Table IV).  As expected, Resetpans showed up as 
significant for both log(Time) and log(Distance) results.  
Interestingly, it doesn’t show up as a factor in the number of 
errors made by the participants.  Finally, as in Table II, the 
interaction between the environment and the level of spatial 
ability was significant for log(Distance) (Pr(>|t|) = 0.031 in 
Table IV).   
V. DISCUSSION 
 
      The spatial visualization ability level of the participants 
was a significant factor in the regression models for all but 
the regression model for log(Distance) using the Resetpan 
variable and was suggestive there. The boxplots in Figures 4 
and 5 show some support for the hypotheses given earlier 
except for the virtual environment participants in the 
log(Distance) boxplot.  Somewhat surprising was how little 
impact the environment (and the interaction between the 
environment and spatial ability) had in the experiment.  
Beyond the suggestion of a difference in the distance 
278

traveled between high spatial visualization ability people in 
the field versus high spatial visualization ability people in 
the virtual environment (Figure 5), we did not find a 
separation based on the environment.   
 
Two issues that made it difficult to work with the data 
were the number of participants used in the study and the 
high level of variation that we found in the performance of 
low 
spatial 
participants, 
especially 
in 
the 
virtual 
environment.  The number of participants that we used in 
the experiment was a function of the difficulty that we had 
in finding participants with a low level of spatial ability.  In 
spite of testing a large pool of subjects in Phase I, we 
struggled to find a sufficient number of low spatial ability 
participants to increase the size of the experiment.   
 
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
The experiments provided support for the development of 
map-based user interfaces that work with both high and low 
levels of spatial ability.  Since we were unable to find a 
significant difference due to environment, testing software 
in the virtual environment remains a realistic possibility.  
However, we expect that we will have to do more testing 
with an increased Phase II sample size in order to validate 
such an approach.
