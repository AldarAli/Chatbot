Abstract – This paper investigates discrimination of plaque lesion 
from other types of psoriasis lesions using fuzzy logic technology. 
The proposed intelligent model can aid dermatologist in doing 
pre-diagnosis of psoriasis lesion particularly in hospitals that are 
scarce of expert persons.  Skin lesions can be represented in terms 
of enhanced image pixel indices from various color models such as 
RGB, HSV and YCbCr. These indices are used as inputs in 
designing an intelligent model based on fuzzy algorithm. However 
prior to that, numerical analysis is done statistically in order to 
select only significant color components that would infer plaque 
discrimination from the non-plaque group samples. The outcome 
of the designed fuzzy model has produced sensitivity and 
specificity of 72.72% and 90.09% respectively. Eventually, the 
overall accuracy of the fuzzy model is 81.82%, and is about 7% 
higher when compared to the optimized ANN model developed 
earlier from previous work.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Psoriasis comes from the Greek word psora, meaning the 
state of being affected with itch. It is an immune mediated, 
genetic disease manifesting in the skin and/or the joints. This 
chronic scaling disease belongs to the papulosquamos diseases 
group of skin disorders [1]. In psoriasis, the epidermis layer 
beneath the outer skin surface thickens because of an 
abnormality growth of melanocyte cells causing dilation of 
blood vessels for nourishment. The immune system then sends 
faulty signals that speed up the movement rate of these cells to 
the surface within days instead of weeks where they will pile 
up with the dead cells, sometimes creating white, flaky layer 
over a patch of an inflamed skin. Psoriasis is prevalence 
worldwide effecting 1% to 2% of the population [2]. In 
Malaysia, the top five skin disorders seen by dermatologists 
each year are psoriasis, chronic eczema, allergies, occupational 
dermatitis and acne [3]. About 3% of the citizen population 
was reported to suffer from psoriasis alone, compared to only 
0.756% that was having malignant skin problems [4]. Psoriasis 
has variety of clinical presentations. The major ones are the 
scaly plaques, noduled guttate, reddish erythroderma, and 
sometimes creating pus in pustular. It may range from just a 
few spots anywhere on the body to large areas of involvement. 
Nevertheless, it is not contagious or spreadable from one part 
of the body to another or from one person to another. However, 
individuals with severe psoriasis have a profound emotional 
and social as well as physical impact on their quality of life [5]. 
The exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, but it is common 
that psoriasis is heritable [6].  
Dermatology is about medical study on skin diseases 
or lesions [2]. The fundamental concept of learning 
practiced by dermatologist is by looking at the skin lesion, 
applying morphological learning method and then follow-
up by differential diagnosis steps in order to identify the 
types of diseases. These methods would include matching 
the skin lesion appearance to the closest appearance photo 
from a library text as guidance for the diagnosis. 
Basically, dermatologist needs to know the preliminary 
spatial and spectrum information when diagnosing a skin 
lesion. Since the human eye has limitation in performing 
such difficult tasks, dermatologists sometimes would rely 
on true color digital imaging to assist them in their work. 
Nowadays, with the rapid advances in computer and video 
technology, producing such a low-cost biomedical 
imaging based on analysis of color and texture of skin 
lesions has become very feasible. These support systems 
not only enhance the dermatologist ability to communicate 
with patients and colleagues but the quantified data 
images can be used more efficiently and perhaps diagnose 
the lesion with better accuracy and efficiency [7]. 
Many research works have applied available computer 
vision 
technology 
and 
other 
sophisticated 
image 
processing techniques on capturing and improving images 
of skin lesions. Characteristics such as Asymmetry in the 
shape of lesion, irregular lesion Border, variegated 
Coloring in the lesion and Diameter of the lesion are 
useful and important features for dermatologist whenever 
skin diagnosis is concerned [1]. All of the lesion features 
based on the ABCD rule can be proposed as the front-end 
inputs in designing an artificial intelligence for automated 
dermatological diagnoses of a specific lesion. In fact, 
several work concerning realization of this idea have 
already been described and implemented where artificial 
neural network (ANN) were used as the lesion classifier 
[8-10]. These work focused on discriminating malignant 
melanoma from other types of skin tumor based on color 
features 
where 
several 
color 
models 
have 
been 
experimented to describe the colors characteristics of 
melanoma in terms of means and variances. Such models 
are the primary RGB, spherical color coordinates (CIE-
L
), relative chromaticity (rgb), CIE-LUV, and the non-
linear transformation model of YCbCr and HSV. Other 
artificial intelligence related work that used fuzzy 
algorithm for skin color image segmentation of lesions

was described in these literatures [12-14]. However, these 
works mainly focused only on enhancement of selected lesion 
segmentation that utilized RGB and HSV color models. No 
discrimination between lesions was reported.  
Application of neural network in automated diagnosis of 
psoriasis skin lesion has been initiated by Hashim et. al. His 
investigation was on discriminating plaque lesion from other 
psoriasis using ANN algorithm where several color models 
were used and reported in these literatures [14-16]. Most of the 
trained optimized ANN models were trained using Levenberg-
Marquardt algorithm and later, validated based on the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve that conveniently displays 
diagnostic accuracy expressed in terms of sensitivity and 
specificity with respect to selected threshold values. When 
comparing between color models, the investigations have 
shown that HSV is the best color space for discriminating 
plaque with accuracy of 75.21% [15]. This result will be used 
for comparison later on with the investigation outcome of this 
paper. 
As an additional study of the previous work, investigation 
on using fuzzy algorithm is proposed as the pattern classifier 
based on various color models. Therefore, this paper described 
the scope of work in Section I, followed by methodology in 
Section II. Section III is for the results and discussion. Finally, 
Section IV is the conclusion of the findings. 
 
II. SCOPE OF WORK 
Scope of this study is on designing an intelligent fuzzy 
model that can discriminate plaque from non-plaque group of 
lesions based on three color models i.e. RGB, YCbCr and HSV. 
Digital image processing technique is applied to produce 
quantitative color measurements. Each lesion sample from the 
respective group is represented by its differential mean pixel 
index which will be elaborated in the following section. The 
group indices are tested statistically using Statistical Package 
for Social Sciences (SPSS) tool in order to observe any 
discrimination through independent t-test and eventually, 
computation of measurement range with respect to the group‟s 
mean, upper and lower confidence limit (UCL and LCL) [17]. 
The information is then used as inputs to design intelligent 
model using a fuzzy algorithm. 
 
 
III. METHODOLOGY 
 
A. Data Collection 
Three sets of digital images of psoriasis lesions 
representing plaque, guttate, and erythroderma were captured 
from psoriasis patients under controlled environment at the 
Hospital Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (HUKM) and 
Hospital Melaka. These images have 600 samples representing 
the 3 lesions (plaque:guttate:erythroderma), cropped and 
divided into training set of 468 samples with a proportion of 
234:117:117 representing each lesion respectively. The testing 
set has 132 samples with 66:33:33 proportions. Just notice that 
all these sets are evenly distributed between plaque and non-
plaque samples. These samples were then separated by three 
categorized color models which are the RGB, YCbCr and HSV. 
The samples were later clustered into two groups: plague and 
non-plague (comprised of guttate and erythroderma) and acts 
as inputs for fuzzy logic system. Initially, the RGB 
component color images were acquired using FinePix 
6900 Zoom (FujiFilm) digital camera, with pixel 
resolution of 786x512. This size is sufficient for analysis, 
as all relevant details of the lesions are shown [18]. During 
the photo session, the camera was placed at a distance of 
one foot directly above the patient‟s skin. 
 
B. Pre-processing 
Each image from the stored database was being 
filtered using median filter technique in order to remove 
any artifacts such as small white ellipse lines or dots. 
These artifacts can be considered as impulsive noise and 
may thus be reduced using a median filter given by [19]:

where Nmed is an odd number that indicates the selected 
size of a two dimensional median filter. P represents all 
the color components. Note that only square median filter 
kernel was considered. After the filtering process, region 
of interest (ROI) which includes a sample of normal skin 
and three samples of lesion area were selected. Each 
image was carefully studied and observed by the 
dermatologists involved in this research. Once the regions 
have been identified by them, the images were cropped 
out sequentially with the normal skin first and followed by 
the other lesion sample. All samples were then been 
resized to a dimension of 256 by 256 pixel area for 
consistency in this research [14-16]. The differential 
method of gathering lesion sample color indices is defined 
as:  
 
Phsv(i,j) = [Phsv lesion (i,j) – Xhsv skin]          (2) 
 
where Xhsv are the computed mean index for each color 
component of the selected ROI normal skin sample. 
 
HSV parameters were derived non-linearly from RGB 
through the following mathematical conversion [15];

using two defined Kb and Kr and the transformation are as 
follows:

     (6)

Here, R’, G’ and B’ are assumed to be nonlinear (gamma-
adjusted) and has a nominal range from 0 to 1, with 0 
representing the minimum intensity and 1 the maximum. The 
prime symbols denote the use of gamma adjustment. The 
resulting luma (Y) value will then have a nominal range from 0 
to 1, and the chroma color difference(Cb and Cr) values will 
have a nominal range from -0.5 to +0.5 [16].  
 
C. Inference Test 
Independent t-test was applied to obtain p-values that 
provide valuable information because it measures the amount 
of statistical evidence that supports the alternative hypothesis 
in this work as shown below.

Statisticians translated p-value into 4 different descriptive 
terms, which are [17]: 
 
 
 p-value <0.01: 
 
There is overwhelming evidence to infer that H1 is true 
 0.01<p-value < 0.05: 
 
There is strong evidence to infer that H1 is true 
 0.05<p-value < 0.1: 
 
There is weak evidence to infer that H1 is true 
 0.1<p-value < 1.0: 
 
There is no evidence to infer that H1 is true 
 
D. Fuzzy Inference Systems 
Basically, fuzzy logic based in fuzzy inference systems 
(FIS) or Fuzzy-rule based systems as depicted in Figure 1 [20]. 
In this system a fuzzy fication interface transforms the input in 
degrees of match with linguistic values. Then a decision-
making unit performs the inference operations on the rule base. 
Finally, a defuzzification which is a process of combining 
applicable fuzzy rules in order to assign a value to a given 
output interface transforms the fuzzy result of the 
interference process in a crisp output. Fuzzy inference is 
the process of formulating the mapping from a given input 
to an output using fuzzy logic. The mapping then provides 
a basis from which decisions can be made, or patterns 
discerned. The process of fuzzy inference involves all of 
the pieces that are described in the previous sections: 
membership functions, fuzzy logic operators, and if then 
rules. There are two types of fuzzy inference systems that 
can be implemented in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox: 
Mamdani type and Sugeno-type. These two types of 
inference systems vary somewhat in the way outputs are 
determined. But, in this study,  Mamdani type is selected 
due it more suitable  for human input [20].

E. The FIS editor 
The fuzzy inference system (FIS) Editor displays 
general information about a fuzzy inference system as 
shown in Figure 2. There is a simple diagram at the top 
that shows the names of each input variable on the left, 
and those of each output variable on the right. The sample 
membership functions shown in the boxes are just icons 
and do not depict the actual shapes of the membership 
functions [20].

F. Input and Output Membership Function 
The fuzzy sets and the membership functions are defined in 
the following manner: if X is a collection of objects, then a 
fuzzy sets A in X is defined as a set of order pairs [20], as in 

X
x  x
x

A


, ( )
                        (9) 
From (7), A represent a fuzzy set and 
A (x)
is a memberships 
function of x in A. 
 
G. Fuzzy Rule Base 
Fuzzy rule are a collection of linguistic statements that 
describe how the FIS should make a decision regarding 
classifying an input or controlling an output. This fuzzy logic 
was used production rules that consist of s precondition (IF-
part) and a consequence (THEN-part) to represent the relation 
among the linguistic variables and to derive actions from 
inputs. There are six rules were defined for fuzzy logic system. 
 
H. Defuzzification 
The choice of defuzzification method depends on the 
precision of the result [20]. There are five types of 
defuzzification methods where for this study, the Min of 
maximum (MoM) technique was chosen. This technique takes 
the output distribution and finds its mean of maxima to come 
up with one crisp number.  
 
 
I. Performance Indicators 
Optimizations of the designed models for best learning 
coefficients were based on performance indicators such as 
sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and receiver 
operating characteristic curve. Sensitivity and specificity are 
commonly used terms that generally describe the accuracy of a 
test. Sensitivity is a measure of the ratio or percentage of „true‟ 
lesions (TP) and a positive diagnostic test result (
D 
). It 
represents the actual percentage of a „true‟ lesion disease 
realized by a positive test result and is also known as true 
positive rate (TPR), defined as [14-16]: 
Sensitivity:


D
TP
TPR
                       (13) 
 
Specificity measures the ratio or percentage of „false‟ 
lesions (TN) and with a negative diagnostic test result 
(
D 
). It is actually represents the actual percentage of a 
„false‟ lesion condition realized by a negative diagnostic 
test. Specificity is also termed as true negative rate (TNR) 
and is given as: 
Specificity:


TN
TNR
                       (14)      
                       
The percentage for diagnostic accuracy (DA) refers to 
the percentage of samples that have been correctly 
classified or diagnosed, and have output values within the 
predefined threshold range for the respective output level. 
It can be derived as: 
Accuracy:
 x 100%

IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
 
Table I shows multiple comparison independent t-tests 
result to obtain p-values for quantitative measurement. It 
is observed that three color component; B, S and Cb has p-
value >0.05 which implies that plaque cannot be 
discriminated from either both or one of the non-plaque 
lesions. Thus only six color components were considered 
for constructing the fuzzy model.

level while the output has two levels for plaque and non-
plaque. Ranges for each input membership function are taken 
from the outcome measurements of error plot obtained by the 
descriptive explorer SPSS with respect to UCL and LCL. The 
ranges for these inputs are shown in Table II. The number of 
training set samples is 468 and each sample‟s values were set 
as plaque boundary in membership function editor for FIS. 
Eventually, the triangular (trimf) has been used because it is 
the simplest way to describe the range of output. However, for 
input membership function, gaussian (gaussmf) has been used 
where it has more suitable curves that have advantage of being 
smooth and nonzero at all points.

Table III below shows the output ranges where it is divided 
into two categories; plaque and non plaque. Range of 0-5 
represents plaque while range of 5.1-10, is for non-plaque. For 
example, if a new lesion sample is being applied to this 
designed fuzzy model, and has output range between 0-5, 
therefore that this sample is classified as plaque.

Figure 3 describes the membership function for this 
investigation. The  six yellow boxes shown on the left-hand 
side of the figure are the inputs membership function that have 
being applied to build the fuzzy system while the blue color 
box presents both targeted outputs. The membership function‟s 
value was obtained from previous input tables. The collection 
of linguistic statements was combined and a decision was made 
regarding classifying an input or controlling an output. In this 
system, fuzzyfication has transformed each input in terms of 
degree of matching with the respective linguistic values and 
later, an inference operation was performed by a decision 
making unit.

Table IV shows the performance indicators output 
produced by the fuzzy model. The testing set comprised of 
132 samples of lesion tested in the fuzzy rule viewer. The 
percentage accuracy for plaque or TPR (sensitivity) is 
72.72%, implying the model can recognize 48 samples out 
of 100 positively diagnosed samples. Only 18 samples 
would be falsely indentified as non-plaque. Alternatively 
when the model was tested with 100 negatively diagnosed 
as non-plaque, the percentage accuracy TNR (specificity) 
is 90.09%. This implies that the model has better 
capability to recognize non-plaque samples. Only 6 
samples were falsely identified as positive. The overall 
diagnostic accuracy (DA) is calculated using equation (15) 
and for this fuzzy model, it is 81.82%.

Finally, the performance of the designed fuzzy model 
is compared to ANN best model performance as described 
in Section I. Table V shows the comparison in terms of 
DA% and as a note, the number of training and testing 
samples used for designing and validating both models are 
the same. From the table, it is noted that the fuzzy model 
has higher percentage accuracy and outperformed ANN 
model by atleast 7%. This simulation results indicates that 
the fuzzy model is better in discriminating plaque lesion or 
otherwise non-plaque lesion.

V. CONCLUSION 
The aim of this investigation is to design an intelligent 
fuzzy model that can discriminate plaque skin lesions from 
non-plaque or otherwise.  This dermatological pre-diagnostic 
procedure utilized on lesion sample‟s color image processing 
and fuzzy logic algorithm. Combination of various color 
models, i.e. RGB, YCbCr and HSV were chosen because of 
widely being used for skin image study and also to be 
consistent with the previous work that used ANN as the pattern 
classifier. The front-end phase involved enhanced samples 
image processing for feature extraction in terms of differential 
mean pixel indices. These indices were statistically using 
independent t-test in order to identify the valid color 
components that have strong evidence for discriminating 
plaque 
from 
non-plaque 
group. 
The 
identified 
color 
components‟ parameters in terms of ranges of statistical 
measurements with respect to UCL and LCL were later used as 
the input membership function when designing the fuzzy 
model. While training the model with 432 samples, fuzzy 
fication has transformed each input in terms of degree of 
matching with the respective linguistic values and later, an 
inference operation was performed by a decision making unit 
where the targeted model output is to decide between plaque 
and non-plaque. Performance validation was conducted later on 
the fuzzy model with 132 samples of lesion and the result 
showed that it produces an overall accuracy of 81.82%. This 
proposed fuzzy model has also outperformed the best designed 
ANN model from previous work by at least 7% in terms of 
overall accuracy. The outcome of this experiment has 
concluded that fuzzy algorithm has better accuracy and can be 
recommended to be utilized in developing intelligent plaque 
psoriasis classification model.
