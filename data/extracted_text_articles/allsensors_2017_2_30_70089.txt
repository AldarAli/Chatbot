Abstract—In wireless networking, clustering techniques add scal-
ability, reduce the computation complexity of routing proto-
cols, allow data aggregation and then enhance the network
performance. The well known MaxMin clustering algorithm
was previously generalized, corrected and validated. In [1] we
improve MaxMin by proposing a Single-node Cluster Reduction
(SNCR) mechanism which eliminates single-node clusters and
then improve energy efﬁciency. In this paper, we show that
MaxMin, because of its original pathological case, does not
support the grid deployment topology, which is frequently used in
WSN architectures. The unreliability feature of the wireless links
could have negative impacts on Link Quality Indicator (LQI)
based clustering protocols. So, in the second part of this paper
we show how our distributed Link Quality based d-Clustering
Protocol (LQI-DCP) has good performance in high unreliable
link environments. Performance evaluation results also show that
LQI-DCP fully supports the grid deployment topology.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUNDS
In a cold chain monitoring application, due to the size of
a warehouse which hosts large numbers of pallets, provided
each with a temperature sensor, the Wireless Sensor Network
(WSN) can reach several hundreds of nodes which collaborate
for sending alarms towards the Base Station (BS). This ap-
plication speciﬁcally collects rare events (alarms) to ensure
the proper monitoring of the system. If the temperature is
over a threshold, an alarm will be generated; this "interesting
event" is then sent towards the BS. In such a context, network
clustering techniques add scalability feature and then reduce
the computation complexity of data gathering and routing
protocols.
The more often WSN architecture used in cold chain
monitoring applications is the grid deployment topology. So,
in this paper, we show that one should be careful with the
MaxMin clustering heuristic [2] in such a topology.
In [1] and [3], we show how it is important to sufﬁciently
outspread clusterhead in oder to reduce cluster overlaps, the
amount of channel contention between clusters and energy
wastefulness due to overhearing phenomenon. The MaxMin
clustering heuristic, as proposed in [2][4], has the drawback
of not taking into account this problem. In order to solve
this issue, we have proposed LQI-DCP in [5]. LQI-DCP is
an energy efﬁcient LQI based protocol which aims to con-
struct multihop clusters by producing clusters of which each
clusterhead has a better positioning regarding the locations of
other clusterheads. The clusterheads resulting from LQI-DCP
are sufﬁciently outspread. LQI-DCP also reduces the density
of clusterheads and then improves the WSN energy efﬁciency,
while each sensor still remains at most d-hops away from its
own clusterhead.
In a cold chain monitoring application, the warehouse hosts
hundreds of pallets, one upon the other. This environment is
subjected to some unreliability of the wireless links. So, it is
important for LQI based clustering schemes to fully support
such an environment. This is the main objective of the second
part of this paper.
Previous works [1][2][4] present details on MaxMin,
whereas LQI-DCP is described in [5]. All clusterhead selection
criteria used in this paper are deﬁned in [1][5]. As in [1][5]
we indifferently use caryomme(s) or clusterhead(s).
To carry out our work, this paper is organized as follows:
the MaxMin Pathological Case is described in tne next section.
Consequently, we explain, in the third section, why MaxMin
does not support the grid deployment topology. Then, in the
fourth section, we present how LQI-DCP is well adapted
for the grid deployment topology. Finally, the last two parts
present performance results pertaining to the LQI-DCP proto-
col when one takes into account the unreliability feature of the
wireless links.
II.
THE MAXMIN PATHOLOGICAL CASE
Given the similarities with Linked Cluster Algorithm
(LCA) [6] and LCA2 [7], MaxMin naturally inherits the
same pathological case. Thus, in the original paper [4] which
revealed MaxMin to the scientiﬁc research community, the
authors reported the pathological case for which MaxMin fails
in the process of cluster formation. We reproduce here the
ﬁgure (see Figure 1) and the argument as they were stated
in [4] : "There is a known conﬁguration where the proposed
heuristic fails to provide a good solution. This conﬁguration is
when node ids are monotonically increasing or decreasing in
a straight line. In this case, the d+1 smallest node ids belong
to the same cluster as shown in Figure 1. All other nodes
become clusterheads of themselves only. Again, while this is
not optimal it still guarantees that no node is more than d-hops
away from a clusterhead. Furthermore, this conﬁguration is
highly unlikely in a real world application. However, this is a
topic of future work to be performed with this heuristic."

Figure 1. Worse case performance scenario for MaxMin [4]
In the next section, we will show how this pathological case
has negative impacts on the grid deployment topology. Indeed,
the authors of [4] said that : "Furthermore, this conﬁguration is
highly unlikely in a real world application". This is obviously
wrong because the grid deployment topology is more often
encountered in real WSN applications, especially in a cold
chain monitoring application.
III.
MAXMIN INCOMPATIBILITY WITH THE GRID
DEPLOYMENT TOPOLOGY
To better understand the consequences of the MaxMin
pathological case on the grid deployment topology, let us
consider the representation in Figure 2 where N nodes are
deployed on a rectangular area of length L and width l.
Considering a grid where each side of the area is subdivided
with a constant pitch λ. Then, the coordinates x(i) and y(i)
of the ith node i ∈ J1, NK are obtained as follows:
n = ⌊ L
λ ⌋, m = ⌊ l
λ⌋, N = ((n + 1) ∗ (m + 1)) − 1, where ⌊ L
λ ⌋
denotes the integer part of L
λ
x(i) = λ ∗ ⌊
i
m+1⌋
y(i) = λ ∗ i mod (n + 1)
Figure 2. MaxMin incompatibility with the grid deployment topology
If we assume that all nodes have the same transmission
range R = 2 ∗ λ, then by running MaxMin algorithm with the
parameter d = 1 and the function criteria f(x) = id(x) for
the WSN example in (Figure 2):
•
During ﬂoodmax phase, the node 2 receives the value
12 from 12th node.
•
Next, the node 12 receives this value 12 from 2th node
during the ﬂoodmin phase.
•
Accordingly, the 12th node is selected as clusterhead.
•
As far as that goes, all the ith nodes, i ∈ J10, 30K
(Figure 2), are selected as clusterhead.
•
More generally, it’s easy to show that all the ith nodes
i ∈ J2(m + 1), NK are selected as clusterhead by
MaxMin.

Thus, it is important to be careful when one chooses
the criteria used to select the MaxMin clusterheads in the
context of a grid deployment topology. Indeed, the "degree
of connectivity" and "MinLQI" criteria also suffer the same
effects because of the smoothness of the grid topology. These
critera are monotonically increasing in each row and each
column of the grid when one moves from the edge toward
the center of the deployment area.
Thus, MaxMin run with the Single-Node cluster reduction
mechanism (SNCR) [1] leads to the following results for
criteria: "Node id" (Figure 3), "Degree of connectivity" (Figure
4), and "MinLQI" (Figure 5). These results are explained by
the neighbourhood relationship (transmission range) between
the selected clusterheads. So, we obtain a series of clusterheads
located in adjacent columns which are periodically seperated
by adjacent columns composed of regular nodes (Figure 5).

To overcome this issue of MaxMin pathological case in
a grid deployment topology, one should choose a criterion
function of which the values are randomly distributed to the
nodes. This helps avoiding a function which is monotonically
increasing (or decreasing) along the lines of the grid. This ran-
domization of the criterion overcomes the problem of MaxMin
pathological case (Figure 6) but also has the disadvantage
of leading to unpredictable results. Indeed, the beneﬁts of
choosing a particular criterion rather than another one is to
promote optimal results with respect to the main objectives of
the application according to its operational conditions. Figure
6 shows the location of caryommes obtained for a randomized
function criteria. As we can see, this result is not optimal
because some clusterheads are too closely located. Therefore,
this leads to high energy consumption because of overhearing,
channel contention and overlaps between clusters [1].
According to these results, we tend to conclude that
MaxMin is not suitable for the grid deployment topology
which is by far the most common topology encountered in
cold chain monitoring applications.
The MaxMin pathological case is also a big drawback for
multihop clusters, d ≥ 2, as shown in Figure 7.
To overcome this problem with MaxMin, as we stated in
Section III, one should choose a criterion function of which
the values are randomly distributed to the nodes. This helps
avoiding a function which is monotonically increasing (or
decreasing) along the lines of the grid. Even in this case, LQI-
DCP (Figure 10) is more efﬁcient than MaxMin (Figure 11)
by sufﬁciently outspreading selected clusterheads.
Conversely our LQI-DCP protocol fully supports the grid
deployment topology both for 1-hop and for multihop WSN
clustering (Figures 8 and 9).

At each given time t, the LQI value of the link formed by
any pair (x, y) of nodes is calculated by using the ℓ(x, y, t)

In the context of a cold chain monitoring application, the
warehouse hosts hundreds of pallets, one upon the other. Each
pallets is provided with a temperature sensor. This environment
is subjected to some unreliabilities of the wireless links. So, in
the formula (2), Pr [ℓink(x, y, t) = Unreliable] denotes the
probability that the link ℓink(x, y, t) becomes unreliable at
time t. This probability is used in some simulation scenarios,
in order to evaluate the behavior of our LQI-DCP protocol
with respect to the unrelibility aspect of the wireless links.
The choice of this model, formula (3), is guided by
experimental results shown in [8] and [9], which stated that
the LQI decreases when the distance between nodes increases
in Zigbee-based WSN.
As we can see, ℓ(x, y, t) ̸= ℓ(y, x, t), because of the
formulas (5) and (6). Hence, the model allows to take into
account asymetrical aspects of the wireless links.
For moteiv′s Tmote Sky [10] sensors equipped with
chipcon′s CC2420 [11], the LQI values range from 50 to
110. Even so, we stick with the ZigBee standard [12],[13]
because some manufacturers, such as Sun-SPOT [14] and
WiEye [15], are still using the standard LQI values. Then, we
use the standard values (i.e., [0, 255]) increased by α = 50,
instead of those of CC2420. The use of α = 50 allows to
keep the null value, ℓ(x, y, t) = 0, only for the two cases
where the node y is not in the transmission range of the
node x, or when the ℓink(x, y, t) becomes unreliable i.e.,
Pr [ℓink(x, y, t) = Unreliable] = 1.
This LQI model is only used for simulation purposes, so
sensor nodes do not compute these above formulas.
Simulations, using Matlab, are run for a network size
ranging from 200 to 4000 nodes. The performance results
presented here are obtained by averaging the results for 100
different simulations for the two scenarios (Figures 12 and
13). As for others scenarios 80 different simulations were run.
For each simulation, a new random node layout is used. In all
simulation results presented below, ℓmax = 230 and ℓmin = 70
as deﬁned in [5]. The MinLQI clusterhead selection criterion
is also deﬁned in [1]. For a node, the MinLQI value represents
the minimum LQI value beyond a given threshold which is set
to 100, in all simulation scenarios.
V.
IMPACTS OF THE UNRELIABILITY FEATURE OF THE
WIRELESS LINKS ON LQI-DCP OPERATIONS
In the context of a cold chain monitoring application, the
warehouse hosts hundreds of pallets, one upon the other. Each
pallets is provided with a temperature sensor. This environment
is subjected to some unreliabilities of wireless links. In this
section we take into account such a phenomenon. For a sensor
Si, its unreliable links with some neighbors are modeled by
the Bernoulli distribution of parameter p which takes the value
"unreliable" with the probability deﬁned as follows:
Pr [ℓink(i, j, t) = Unreliable] = 1 , if δ(i, j, t) ≤ p
(7)
where δ(i, j) is a random generated number which is
uniformly distributed in ]0, 1] for each neighbor Sj of the
sensor Si. If Pr [ℓink(i, j, t) = Unreliable] = 1, then at
time t, ℓ(i, j, t) = 0 and the node Sj would not become a
whipping boy node related to the emissary node Si even if
Sj is too closely located to Si.

Figure 12. LQI-DCP: Average density of whipping boy nodes ﬁnally selected
as clusterheads, d = 1, p = 0
Before inspecting the impacts of the unreliability feature
of the wireless links, it is useful to examine the average ratio
of the whipping boy nodes ﬁnally elected as clusterheads in
the scenario where all links are considered reliable, i.e.:
∀t, ∀x ∈ V, Pr [ℓink(x, y, t) = Unreliable] = 0 , ∀y ∈
N1(x). (8)
Then Figure 12 plots the average number of the whipping boy
nodes ﬁnally selected as clusterheads divided by the overall
number of clusterheads produced by LQI-DCP. For all studied
criteria, this ratio is too low. For the proximity with respect
to the BS, around 1% of clusterheads are choosen from the
whipping boy nodes. This ratio is between 1% and 2, 5% for
the degree of connectivity criterion and between 3% and 4%
for the MinLQI criterion.

Figure 13 shows that the unreliability of the wireless links
has negligible effects on the average density of clusterheads by
comparing results for p = 0 (all links are reliable), p = 0.25,
p = 0.5 and p = 0.75 (high unreliability), when the degree of
connectivity is used as criterion. Figure 14 displays the average
positions of clusterheads for p = 0.75. In these scenarios, no
unreliability is taken into account for the MaxMin clustering
scheme. Wireless link unrelibilities are only considered for the
LQI-DCP clustering scheme.

into account. Then for all scenario in this paper, p = 0, for
MaxMin protocol. The unreliability feature of the wireless
links is taken into consideration only for LQI-DCP.
Figures 14, 15, 17 and 19 plot, for LQI-DCP, the average
clusterheads location when the WSN is subjected to high
unreliability phenomenon of the wireless links, i.e., p = 0.75.
These results show that the unreliability of the wireless
links also has negligible effects on the locations of clusterheads
selected by LQI-DCP: caryommes are sufﬁciently outspread.
If a link were to be unreliable, the only effect on LQI-DCP
is to decrease the number of whipping boy nodes in both ﬁrst
and second round of the LQI-DCP process. As a neighbor of
a ﬁrst round elected node can not become a clusterhead. Then
unreliability of the wireless links has low impact on the LQI-
DCP clustering scheme.
Figure 20. Stability of LQI-DCP in unreliable link environments
For explanation, consider the example illustrated in Figure
20, in which we suppose that the sensor Ci, although located
closely to the preselected node PN, also forms a link of poor
quality with PN, i.e., ℓ(PN, Ci) ≤ ℓmin. Thus Ci would
be an "emissary node" of PN. However, even if Ci has a
good link quality with Cj, i.e., ℓ(Ci, Cj) ≥ ℓmax, Cj will not
become a "whipping boy node", relatively to Ci, because it is
already clusterized and attached to PN as clusterhead [5].
In the same example (Figure 20), the unreliability of the
wireless links could also affect the quality of the link formed
by the emissary node Ei with the sensor BEi. Which might
result in considering BEi as a non-clusterized regular node
which is not a "whipping boy node". However, in a dense
WSN, BEi could have some good links with other emissaries
such as Ej or Ek. In this case, BEi would become a "whipping
boy node" (Figure 20). This property could be less true in cases
where the WSN is deployed with a low node density.
So, as we can see, in dense wireless sensor networks, our
LQI-DCP protocol also supports the unreliability feature of the
wireless links.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper complements our previous contributions [1] and
[5]. Firstly, it shows how MaxMin is not fully compatible with
the prevalent grid deployment topology. So, because of the
smoothness of this topology, MaxMin fails with most of the
criteria used in clusterhead selection such as "Degree of con-
nectivity", "node id", "MinLQI", and "Proximity-BS". Then,
the only way to use MaxMin in a grid deployment topology is
to choose a radomized criterion function. However, in doing so,
it becomes impossible to choose the most appropriate criteria
for a speciﬁc application.
Secondly, we complete the LQI-DCP contribution with
some results which show that this protocol fully supports the
grid deployment topology. LQI-DCP is also performant in
environments subjected to high unreliabilities of the wireless
links. This property is important for a LQI based multihop
clustering protocol such LQI-DCP.
Finally, it can be noted that the issue of security has not
been addressed here. Thus, in our future work, we will be
interested in the aspects of securing the LQI-DCP protocol
while taking care to minimize energy consumption.
