Abstract‚ÄîIn recent years, the increasing amount of data arisen
from mobile terminals has deteriorated the response speed felt
by users especially in a crowded place. Our previous studies
have proposed a method of identifying an application being
used by each terminal and selecting the optimum access point.
However, there are some considerations in an actualizing the
system. In order to compose a more realistic environment,
this research developed a prototype system with an Android
application on each mobile terminal and a control server. Some
network performances are evaluated from the perspective of
assignment status and computation time.

INTRODUCTION
While the Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been in
widespread use and the line speed for data communications
has also been improved, the exploding data trafÔ¨Åc that evolving
applications require lead to increase the utilization factor of
public WiFi services from now on. However, the response
speed that users feel might become longer due to throughput
degradation on a public WiFi station because of increasing
network load in a crowded place such as a railroad station
and a classroom in an academic campus. Particularly, Japanese
train stations are congested during commuting rush hours.
One of the above causes is considered that there are some
mismatches between users and Access Points (APs). Therefore,
it is essential to associate with an appropriate AP to improve
the Quality of Experience (QoE). A problem to lead a user
to an appropriate AP is named an AP selection problem. The
current association policies are mostly based on a selÔ¨Åsh user‚Äôs
behavior maximizing its own throughput [1][2]. However, it
should be realized that different users have different needs
since running applications have their particular Quality of
Service (QoS) requirements [3]. Our previous studies [4] have
proposed a method of identifying an application being used by
each terminal and selecting the optimum AP.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
A. System Model
Our proposed system includes a control server, plural APs,
and mobile terminals in Figure 1. Each AP is constantly
associated with a Measuring Terminal (MT) that is dedicated
to measuring the response speed. MTs regularly obtain RTT
and throughput by using ping and PathQuick, and send the
information to the control server. PathQuick is a systematic
approach to estimate the throughput in brief time [5].

Figure 1. System Model
The control server solves an assignment problem by the
Hungarian method to Ô¨Ånd the optimum AP for each user based
on the information acquired from the MTs and the running
applications on user terminals. Then, the server sends the
suitable AP information to terminals.
Finally, according to the information sent from the control
server, all user terminals switchover to the optimal AP.
B. Problem Formulation
There are some real-time applications, which require more
strict RTT between a user terminal and a destination server, and
others which might strongly demand throughput. The former
applications belong to a group GRT T and the latter ones belong
to a group GT P . Therefore, the needed RTT (RTTneed) and
throughput (TPneed) are deÔ¨Åned by four different types of
applications shown in TABLE I.

Equation (1) expresses a satisfaction degree Si of each mo-
bile user. APPi indicates an application running on terminal
i. RTTlink and TPlink indicate RTT and throughput provided
when connecting to the AP i. The objective is to maximize
the harmonic mean for all Si.

C. Research Tasks
In the previous research, the system was evaluated by
simulating only an assignment algorithm in a control server.
However, it is needed to consider the detailed communication
contexts and a practical network environment to develop an
implementation plan for a real case. This paper explains a
system with actual devices, such as user terminals and a control
server, and evaluates the validity of the assignment results and
computing time by constructing the system.
III.
DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
The software on a user device includes the Ô¨Åve main
functions, ‚ÄùObtain the available AP informations.‚Äù, ‚ÄùSwitch the
connection automatically.‚Äù, ‚ÄùMeasure the response speeds.‚Äù,
‚ÄùIdentify the running application.‚Äù, and ‚ÄùCommunicate with
the control server.‚Äù. The system used an Android application
which is relatively easy for implementation.
The software on a control server includes the four main
functions, ‚ÄùCommunicate with the user device.‚Äù, ‚ÄùDecide the
needed response speed.‚Äù, ‚ÄùCalculate the assignment problem.‚Äù,
and ‚ÄùStore the virtual terminal informations.‚Äù. Also, because
of fairness, the control server must be located on a different
network, and be able to access the Internet.

In this paper, the response speed considered is only RTT
at this stage, for that reason the applications included in
GT P need to be redeÔ¨Åned. The redeÔ¨Åned RTTneed is shown
in TABLE II. Instead of using (1), the satisfaction degree
RTTgap is derived by subtracting RTTneed from RTTlink.
If the RTTgap is a negative value, it is set to 0. The objective
in this paper is to minimize the total amount of the RTTgap.
B. Conditions
In the experiment, the number of APs is set to 3, the
number of terminals is set to 50 (pattern 1) and 70 (pattern 2),
and the terminal capacities of AP are set to 20, 25, 30 in pattern
1 and 30, 40, 50 in pattern 2. The RTTlink is set to increase
by 3ms or 4ms for each connected terminal. This research also
veriÔ¨Åed the greedy method and the random method. The greedy
method prioritizes assignment in order from the terminals with
the shortest response speed required, and the random method
assigns the terminals in a random manner.
C. Results and Discussions
The results are shown in TABLE IV. The experimental
results have demonstrated that the Hungarian method gains the
highest satisfaction degree compared with two other methods.
The satisfaction degree by the Greedy method does not in-
crease because a terminal judges an appropriate AP according
to a transient response speed.

This research deÔ¨Ånes computing time as a processing inter-
val from identifying an application to establishing a connection
to an assigned AP. The greedy method and the random method
Ô¨Ånish the calculation within below 1 second in every case.
However, the Hungarian method Ô¨Ånishes that within around
12 seconds in the most frequent processes. This processing
time leaves room for improvement on the effectiveness.
V.
CONCLUSION
This research implemented the previously proposed system
with actual devices and showed the higher satisfaction degree
by using Hungarian method. The developed system has to
be extended with considering TP in order to improve the
effectiveness, since the experiments consider only RTT. The
processing time in our proposed system has been found to be
longer for users in a certain case. The future tasks include
devising a simpler approximate method for rapidity.
