Abstract—This paper presents a solution for creating dynamic 
flight plans for drones. The number of drones is expected to 
increase dramatically, and there will be a demand for drone 
traffic planning solutions. The approach used here is based on 
a multidimensional grid with fixed top-level paths and lower-
level paths used for local traffic between the departure and 
arrival points and the top-level paths. Flight plans may change 
dynamically if disruptions happen. The proposed solution 
includes the establishment of temporary no-fly zones and 
priority traffic.

 INTRODUCTION 
“Smart cities” is a concept that uses information and 
communication technology to improve the quality of life for 
its citizens by delivering better services, reducing 
environmental footprint and improving citizen participation. 
One aspect of smart cities is to make transport smarter [1]. 
This paper focuses on how to meet the challenges of drone 
traffic for delivery and other applications. 
Some of the leading information and communication 
technology companies (Google and Amazon) are currently 
exploring new delivery services using unmanned aerial 
vehicles (drones). Drone technology has also attracted the 
attention of traditional logistics companies like DHL, UPS 
and Deutsche Post AG, as well as big retailers like Walmart. 
Drones 
are 
becoming 
increasingly 
important 
in 
agriculture, medical sector, civil engineering, insurance, 
security, and energy. According to Goldman Sachs, the 
future drone market is predicted to be $100 billion by the 
year 2020 [2] where the defense sector remains the largest 
consumer with around 70%. However, Business Insider 
Intelligence researchers are less optimistic and expect sales 
of drones to surpass $12 billion in 2021 [3]. The lift capacity 
and operating distance are improving, mainly due to 
advances in battery technology. 
Drones are particularly of great interest for last mile 
delivery applications in smart cities. Last mile delivery is the 
end part of the delivery chain, which deals with the 
distribution of goods from long haul to the end user, being 
the most expensive part of the delivery chain. As part of the 
upcoming Industry 4.0 revolution, the autonomy of drones 
plays an essential role in the evolution of logistics. Drones 
are becoming commonly used in the early stages of logistics 
(commonly called first-mile) as well as in its last stages. 
Intralogistics operations deal with the optimization, 
integration, automatization, and management of data flow 
and goods inside a distribution center. Drones can be smartly 
used for transportation inside factories, spare parts delivery, 
goods storing and delivering. 
Use of drones for city infrastructures surveillance is of 
great interest as they can be used for building inspections and 
maintenance. 
In 2013, Amazon announced Prime Air [4], a service that 
utilizes multirotor drones to deliver packages from Amazon 
to customers. The German logistics company Deutsche Post 
DHL started its Parcelcopter project in 2014. One application 
of the Parcelcopter [5] has been to transport medicine to the 
German island of Juist in the North Sea. 
Google revealed Project Wing [6] in 2014 to produce 
drones that can deliver larger items than Prime Air and 
Parcelcopter. Recently, in April 2019, Project Wing has 
received regulatory approval to start making last-mile 
commercial drone deliveries in Australia, according to the 
American technology news channel - The Verge [7].  
In 2014, the US company PINC launched the PINC Air 
service, using its drones to follow goods in transports, 
vehicles and more. These drones are equipped with cameras, 
Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) and barcode readers, 
and have software for real-time 3D mapping, navigation, 
goods identification and localization [8].

In 2014, the United Arab Emirates announced its plan to 
use drones to distribute official government documents such 
as permits and identification cards [9].  
A startup company, Matternet has partnered with Swiss 
Post to test a lightweight package delivery drone [10]. 
Recently, the UNICEF Innovation labs [11] explored the 
use of drones for search and rescue operations. The drones 
could be useful in emergency situations, such as rescuing 
victims of natural disasters (floods, extreme temperature 
events, earthquakes, mudslides, storms and wildfires) when 
roads are no longer usable. Drones may be used to transport 
life-saving materials in both humanitarian and development 
contexts [12]. Deliveries of emergency medical supplies and 
kits can reduce the response time in multiple humanitarian 
contexts 
that 
require 
the 
provision 
of 
life-saving 
immunization materials, biological samples, transfusion 
plasma or organs. UNICEF has used drones for such 
operation in African countries and Vanuatu isle in the Pacific 
Ocean [13]. 
A kidney scheduled for transplant was delivered by a 
drone for the first time on April 19th, 2019, in Baltimore, 
United States [14]. A specially tailored drone having the size 
of a washing machine carried a healthy human kidney to 
hospital. The doctors successfully transplanted the organ. 
The operation took place at night, and the drone traveled 4.5 
km in 10 minutes. The whole operation was the result of a 
three-year collaboration of a team of doctors, researchers, 
engineers and plane experts who worked together at the 
Maryland 
Medical 
Center 
and 
the 
Living 
Legacy 
Foundation. The transport of transplant organs using the 
drones reduces costs, reduces transport time and improves 
the quality of medical services. Conventional transport 
methods, including the use of cars, helicopters and planes, 
have significant drawbacks: airplanes are too expensive, 
commercial flights take too long, and small aircraft are 
dangerous to medical teams. 
The increase in drone traffic calls for a traffic 
management system to make sure that drones operate in a 
regulated environment to avoid collisions and improve the 
safety of drone operations. The aim of this paper is to present 
an idea for how drone flight management can be 
implemented in urban areas. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next 
section addresses some current challenges related to the 
commercial use of drones. Section III provides an overview 
of related work. Section IV discusses drone flight planning. 
Section V presents an idea for an algorithm. Section VI 
concludes and provides ideas for further research. 
II. 
CURRENT CHALLENGES 
The use of drones for professional purposes introduces a 
set of challenges that must be observed and addressed: 
• 
Most drones use electrical motors. The battery capacity 
is proportional to the weight of the battery. The capacity 
of the batteries becomes a limiting factor in how far a 
drone can travel before needing to be recharged. Battery 
technology is improving and will increase both travel 
distance and payload weight. 
• 
Flying distance and payload weight depends on battery 
capacity. A larger battery will increase flying distance, 
but also decrease the payload capacity. Balancing 
payload weight, battery weight, and flight time are 
important considerations when attempting to minimize 
the cost or the delivery time for drone deliveries [15]. 
• 
The flight planning for drones is a multi-objective 
optimization problem. The solution needs to take into 
account the existence of no-fly zones and dedicated 
paths for drones to follow. 
• 
Drones may be difficult to maneuver in tight spaces. 
• 
Scalability: How does a fleet of drivable drones might 
be organized so that they do not crash into one another 
implemented in the complex reality of real city streets 
and 
the 
surrounding 
airspace. 
This 
calls 
for 
implementation of traffic planning and collision 
avoidance systems as more and more drones enter the 
airspace. 
• 
Algorithmic path-planning taking into account of urban-
like landscape with buildings, roads, parking areas, 
landing pads and no-fly zones. 
• 
Since the law regarding the use of drones is still not 
fully developed, other challenges or restrictions are 
currently being regulated by the European Union [16], 
e.g., drone weight, maximum possible flying altitude, 
no-fly zones over "crowds", minimum safe distance, etc. 
III. 
RELATED WORK 
Mok [17] presents the prototypes of drones developed at 
MIT´s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence 
Laboratory (CSAIL), located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
USA. These drones, equipped with wheels, represent a mix 
between a drone and a tiny car that can not only fly but are 
capable of driving on the ground, making a tradeoff related 
to energy consumption and speed (time of delivery). Their 
tests included eight drones deployed at the same time and 
following autonomously their own path revealed the 
machines could fly for 90 meters or drive for 252 meters 
before needing to recharge their batteries, a relatively short 
distance. 
Schermer et al. [18] used a heuristic algorithm to extend 
the original Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) [18] to the 
Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRPD), where a 
drone works in tandem with a vehicle to reduce delivery 
times. The authors emphasize qualitative differences 
between trucks and drones and highlight the usefulness of 
incorporating drones in last-mile logistics. 
The limitations of existing VRP solutions applied for 
planning drone deliveries are illustrated by Dorling, 
Heinrichs, Messier and Magierowski [15]: multiple trips to 
the depot are not permitted leading to solutions with excess 
drones, or the effect of battery and payload weight on energy 
consumption is not considered, leading to costly or infeasible 
routes. The authors solve drone delivery problems with a 
Multi-Trip VRP (MTVRP) that compensates for each 
drone’s limited carrying capacity by reusing drones when 
possible. The authors used a model based on the 
13

approximately 
linear 
relationship 
between 
power 
consumption and battery and payload weight. The main 
drawback of their solution is their local optimization 
algorithm based on simulated annealing and not a global 
optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the authors also admit 
that the simulated annealing algorithm does not take 
advantage of characteristics inherent to a VRP such as it does 
not use geographical information to reduce the likelihood of 
trying infeasible routes between two locations at opposite 
ends of the area of operations. 
The researchers from MIT [20], using extra hardware 
(video camera and processing power for image recognition) 
developed 
an 
obstacle-detection 
system 
that 
allows 
autonomous drones to zip through trees at 48 km/h in 
different delivery scenarios. 
The UTM (Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic 
Management) project [21] enters in the fourth stage where 
NASA will test drone traffic management systems in six 
field test sites of U.S. cities – Alaska, Nevada, Texas, North 
Dakota, Virginia, and New York. The project aims 
developing technologies, responsibilities and procedures for 
safely managing the airspace that includes autonomous 
aircraft operations in populated areas. Structured in four 
levels entitled technical capabilities, and focused first on 
agriculture, firefighting and infrastructure monitoring, the 
operators of drones are enabled to set flight plans reserving 
airspace for their operations and provide situational 
awareness about other operations planned in the area. The 
second stage explores the space beyond visual line of sight of 
the operator in sparsely populated areas and contingency 
management. The third involves tracking capabilities of 
drone operations over moderately populated areas. Perhaps 
the most complex, the fourth stage, aims to extend the 
operations defined in the third stage by sending 
correspondence and delivering packages in high populated 
areas. Also, testing the technologies that could be used to 
manage large-scale contingencies aims this last stage. 
Dukowitz [22] revealed other important Urban Aerial 
Mobility (UAM) projects supported by more than 500 
European stakeholders and by European Commission funds 
that intend to bring urban mobility to the third dimension 
bridging the Unmanned Traffic Management with Urban 
Traffic Management. The goal of such projects is to develop 
a cloud-based software platform to integrate low-flying 
unmanned aircraft systems into the airspace safely. 
Since scientific literature is mostly limited to the physical 
implementation of the flying devices and to the control 
methods, not to the integrated solutions, maybe the most 
useful and with open content related work from software 
point 
of 
view, 
about 
algorithms 
and 
information 
management systems focused on drone traffic management 
systems is represented by Plaza [21]. The author creates an 
elaborated model of the system of information for the traffic 
management of unmanned aircraft systems composed by 
Users (the human components clustered on 10 groups 
depending on their role), Functions (22 information 
management activities according to the temporality of the 
flight / mission), Datasets (managed data sorted into groups 
by the content and the temporal validity in order the 
conformability and the orderliness) and 2 Functional 
subsystems 
(Technical 
infrastructure 
elements 
and 
Operational support systems). The model is implemented 
like an information structural matrix, which systematically 
contains the managed data handled by the users connected to 
the execution of the functions. The activities described are 
related only to civil operations, not military, which must 
follow other rules. Besides collecting data covering UAV 
position and movement data, UAV status data, UAV type 
related data (static data), mission-related flight plan data, the 
author also considers environment-related data, which is 
relevant for the safe operations. Operation of the information 
structural model provides comprehensive data sharing 
among the industrial partners, deliverables companies, user 
communities, about the UAVs and their operations. Another 
merit of [23] is that it provides a clear separation of notions 
like UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), which is the flying 
object (technical parts), and the UAS (Unmanned Aircraft 
Systems), which is a greater technical solution, that includes 
the UAV plus the sum of the control infrastructure (the 
human operator). 
These related works do not handle the increasing number 
of drones and the need for traffic planning, including the 
dynamic establishment of no-fly zones and noise reduction. 
Our solution addresses these problems, but does not concern 
itself with battery time. We expect the development of 
battery technology to increase both distances traveled and lift 
capacity. 
The solution is based on two well-known areas from 
computer science: scheduling and routing. To allocate time 
slots, a scheduling algorithm is used. The scheduling 
algorithm makes sure that the drone gets operating space 
throughout the flight. The routing algorithm calculates an 
efficient route through the airspace. Scheduling algorithms 
are heavily used in operating systems. Routing algorithms 
are found in both computer networks and the design of 
printed circuit boards and integrated circuits. 
IV. 
DRONE FLIGHT PLANNING 
An increase in drone traffic will require a traffic 
management system to control the airspace.  
Land-based transport is basically handled by paths in a 
two-dimensional grid, but with possibilities to make 
intersections multi-level to avoid roundabouts or single-level 
intersections. The infrastructure for land-based transport is 
expensive and inflexible. A road or a train line normally has 
a life-span of hundreds of years. 
A. A layered model of the airspace 
The difference between land-based transport and air-
based transport is that paths may be established in three 
dimensions since it is possible to divide the airspace into 
several horizontal layers. This is already done for 
conventional air transport. Drones will use the airspace 
below that used by conventional air transport. Another 
advantage is that airspace is not fixed. The paths may be 
dynamically established and removed based on needs.

Figure 1.  Layer design 
The dynamic flight planning system presented here is 
using five levels (Figure 1), but the number of levels can be 
increased if necessary. On the upper levels, a number of 
fixed paths are established. These will be the “highways” for 
the drone traffic. When the drone needs to go from a location 
to the highway entry point or from the highway exit point to 
a specific location, separate paths will be established on 
endpoint layers 1, 2 or 3. The algorithm will start with 
endpoint level 1, and check for conflicts. If a conflict is 
detected, it will move on to endpoint layer 2, and so on. 
These paths are allocated dynamically. The algorithm 
proposed for channel routing is based on a multi-layer 
algorithm for printed circuit board design. The modification 
is to make it dynamic. A set of fixed channels is established. 
Then, from the nearest point in an existing channel, the 
dynamic path is established from the source to the 
destination. 
The rationale for using fixed upper levels (“drone 
highways”) is considerations about noise. This is important 
for urban areas, where the main corridors for drone traffic 
may be located away from noise sensitive areas.  
B. The algorithm 
Figure 2 shows the establishment of the flight path from 
the point of departure (S) to the point of arrival (E). The 
yellow path shows a part of fixed high-level path (“drone 
highway”). The orange paths show the path from the point of 
departure (S) to the entry point of the fixed path, and from 
the exit point of the fixed path to the point of arrival (E). The 
algorithm will include the following steps: 
1. Based on departure location, find the nearest entry point 
to the higher-level fixed path (“drone highway”) 
2. Based on arrival location, find the nearest exit point 
from the higher-level path (“drone highway”) 
3. Calculate distance and air time between departure point 
and entry point 
4. Calculate distance and air time between the exit point 
and the arrival point 
5. Search for next available slot time taking distance to the 
higher-level path into consideration 
6. Reserve slot time 
7. Check for collisions in the departure area, if collision 
move to next endpoint layer 
8. Check for collisions in the arrival area, if collision 
move to next endpoint layer

Figure 3.  Single-level path flight planning 
At the scheduled time, the drone will take off and follow 
the calculated path to its destination. Figure 4 shows how 
multiple fixed paths can coexist. In this case, the paths will 
be on different levels, with intersections where drones can 
shift from one fixed path to another. This increases the 
complexity of the algorithm, since slot times for each path 
must be taken care of.  The green fixed path is on one of the 
upper levels, the two blue paths are on another upper level. 
The drones will shift from one level to another at the 
interchanges (grey color).

C. Disruptions 
Disruptions may happen.  In particular, disruptions may 
be caused by the establishment of temporary no-fly zones. 
This can be above areas that either represents a danger for 
people on the ground, like large gatherings, or accidents 
where drone traffic could disrupt emergency service 
operations. 
Disruptions may also be caused by priority traffic, e.g., 
for delivering a heart defibrillator. 
If drones have communication capabilities, it is possible 
to upload new flight instructions if something happens. 
Figure 6 shows the establishment of a no-fly zone marked in 
red. The top-level path needs to be reconfigured. 
In this case, it is possible to change the path to not 
conflict with the no-fly zone. The distance will be one grid 
unit larger, so original slots can be reused.

Figure 7 shows the reconfigured high-level path, and also 
introduces a no-fly zone close to the arrival point. The last 
stretch is recalculated to not interfere with the no-fly zone. 
Since drones always have a limitation on flying distance, 
it is necessary to plan for situations where the drone will run 
out of battery before accomplishing its mission, e.g., due to 
the establishment of no-fly zones or priority traffic. The 
problem can be solved by establishing some locations where 
drones can land and later be picked up by the operator. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
As drone lift capacity is growing and travel distance 
increases, drones will be used for commercial purposes. 
Drone traffic, especially in cities, will increase dramatically. 
This calls for a drone traffic management solution to keep 
the air space safe. In this paper, we have shown one possible 
solution to drone traffic management using multiple layers 
where some layers contain fixed paths (“drone highways”) 
and other layers are used for traffic from departure points to 
the highways and from the highways to the arrival point. A 
flight plan is submitted before the flight, and the system will 
find the best possible schedule. 
However, an important issue regarding drones refers to 
governing laws of flying. According to [24], every country 
has specific laws. Thus, our algorithm would not be applied 
in regions like the State of Alabama, USA, where a city 
ordinance ban flight over city properties, parks and 
recreational areas or any other area specified by the police. 
Future research includes developing a simulator for the 
flight scheduling system. The simulator should allow for a 
large number of submitted flight plans in order to prove the 
concept. The simulator should have a visualization module to 
show drones moving in the airspace. 
Since, as far as we know, no fully functional and 
available UTM solution is known, the business model and 
operating methods of the system are not known at present. 
Future research should find answers to these questions and 
address the development of such measures. In this sense we 
will also include developing a business model for the flight 
planning system. 
Blockchain 
is 
an 
immutable 
distributed 
ledger. 
Cryptographic techniques make sure that it is not possible to 
change the content of an entry when it is put on the 
blockchain. All entries are recorded in blocks that are 
distributed to many computers. If one or more computers 
fail, the data is still obtainable from the network. If there 
should be an inconstancy, the majority will win. Essentially, 
blockchain makes it possible to do transactions without an 
intermediary. Since a traffic planning system will handle 
many different actors, the use of blockchain technology and 
smart contracts may be explored as a possible repository for 
flight plans.
