Abstract — Internet processes information in the form of 
distributed digital resources, which have to be available for 
authorized use and protected against unauthorized access. 
The implementation of these requirements is not a simple 
task because there are many ways to its realization in the 
modern multiserviced and congested networks. In this case 
many well-known solutions of the past became inappropriate 
because of traffic fractal statistics, which are caused by 
persistent packet dynamics of transport protocols and loss of 
available throughput. Therefore we offer the new approach 
to raise access control functionality, taking into account 
models of transport protocols in congested network 
environment, characteristics of virtual channel throughput 
and features of active queuing management mechanism that 
based on randomized preemptive procedure. 
Keywords — access control, authorized use, virtual

I. INTRODUCTION  
Internet as a global information infrastructure is 
used widely for business, education and research. This 
infrastructure keeps information in the form of distributed 
digital resources that have to be available for authorized 
use, and protected against unauthorized access. However, 
the implication of these requirements is not a simple task 
due to many elements and many ways of realization. 
Therefore solutions of the past have become inappropriate 
because of traffic fractal statistics, which are caused by 
persistent packet dynamics and correspondent loss of 
virtual channel available throughput. In this paper we 
propose a new approach to access control flexibility 
enhancement based on active queuing management 
mechanism and randomized preemptive procedure. The 
offered solution can be implemented by a firewall and can 
be applied in the existing network environments. 
To reach this purpose we propose: 1) the new 
classification of virtual connections (VC) based on 
security characteristics and throughput requirements; 2) 
VC model, which takes into account fractal characteristics 
of packet flows; 3) randomized preemptive queuing 
management mechanism in congested networks. We use a 
combined method of VCs throughput management that 
unites principles of feedback and program control within a 
framework for Policy-based Admission Control (Fig. 1): 
• 
Policy Decision Point (PDP).  
• 
Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) – security-critical 
component, which protects the resources and enforces 
the PDP's decision. 
• 
Policy Administration Point (PAP).

  Firewall as a central component of access policy enforcement 
In this framework firewall combines PDP and PEP 
by controlling access request and enforcing access 
decisions in real-time. In this case, access control can be 
considered as the throughput control of VC. So, access to 
the specific network resource is prohibited if the 
corresponding VC between the user and resource has no 
available throughput. Therefore from PAP firewall 
receives two types of acce
nd data flow rules. 
The parameters of firewall rules depend on the set 
of network environment and/or protocols characteristics 
A. This set can be divided on two classes with different 
access conditions. In proposed approach the classification 
decision is based on indicator function F and firew
two modes in accordance to possible F (A) values: 
• 
0, if the data flow is forb

• 
1, if the data flow is permitted. 
Forbidden mode means that access denied by PAP. Then

•

has no delivery time requirements. 
To provide this classification procedure we proposed 
active queuing management mechanism, which based on 
randomized preemptive control. Therefore in the firewall 
the data flow throughput and time that packets spend in 
queue (minimum value for priority permitted flows and 
infinity for denied) are the functions of randomized 
control parameter α. Each of the firewall rules has a set of 
attributes: identifiers of subject and object and the access

environment access rules have much more attributes that 
need to identify two subsets of permitted flows. Therefore 
the actual problem of access control within framework for

II. VIRTUAL CONNECTION CLASSIFICATION 
In this paper we use the term “access management” 
as the combine of access control and traffic management. 
Access control is the basic technical method of information 
security in the computer networks. It is providing 
confidentiality by blocking the denied data flows, 
availability by permitting legal connections and integrity 
by reducing the risk of data modification or destruction. 
Confidentiality, integrity and availability are the core 
principles of information security. Access control is based 
on subject-object model, where subjects are the entities 
that can perform actions in the system and influence the 
environment condition and objects are the entities 
representing passive elements between which access need 
to be controlled. Data flows between objects and subjects 
named virtual connections (VC). In this paper Virtual 
Connection is the type of information interaction between 
applications on object and subject by means of formation

IV. MODEL OF NETWORK ENVIRINMENT 
According to the VC models written above we 
consider the preemptive priority queueing system with two 
types of customers. First type of customers has priority 
over the second one. The customers of the type 1 (2) arrive 
into the buffer according to the Poisson process with rate 
 (
). The service time has the exponential distribution 
with the same rate 
λ1

λ
μ  for each type. The service times are 
independent of the arrival processes. The buffer has a finite 
size 
 (
) and it is shared by both types of 
customers. The absolute priority in service is given to the 
customers of the first type. Unlike typical priority 
queueing considered system is supplied by the randomized 
push-out mechanism that helps precisely and accurate to 
manage customers of both types. If the buffer is full, a new 
coming customer of the first type can push out of the 
buffer a customer of type 2 with the probability

have to mention that if α =1 we retrieve the standard non-

The scheme described priority queueing is resulted 
on Fig. 5. The priority queueing without the push-out 
mechanism (
α = 0
) and with the determined push-out 
mechanism (
α =1
) are well-studied. The concept of the 
randomized push-out mechanism with reference to 
network and telecommunication problems is offered in [1] 
where this mechanism was combined with relative priority, 
instead of absolute, as in our case.

Problems of research priority queueing have arisen 
in telecommunication with the analysis of real disciplines 
of scheduling in operating computers. Last years a similar 
sort of queueing model, and also their various 
generalisations are widely used at the theoretical analysis 
of Internet systems. 
As shown in [1], the probability pushing out 
mechanism is more convenient and effective in 
comparison with other mathematical models of pushing 
out considered in the literature. It adequately describes 
real processes of the network traffic and is simple enough 
from the mathematical point of view. The randomized

push-out mechanism helps precisely traffic management 
and security. The another control and security factor is the 
telematics device buffer size. It can be varied to increase 
the throughput of necessary connections and reduce 
throughput of suspicious ones.

Figure 9.  The time that priority packet spend in queueing 
 
Figure 10.  The time that non-priority packet spend in queueing 
Fig 9,10 show that proposed queueing mechanism 
provide a wide range of control feature by randomized 
push-out parameter α and buffer size k. According to the 
packet’s mark (Forbidden, Priority, Background) the 
period that packet spend in queue can vary from 1 to 1014 
times, which can be used to control access to information 
resource providing confidentiality. 
For highly congested network the priority type is 
much less important, than the push-out mechanism and 
the value of α  parameter. The push-out mechanism 
allows to enforce access policy using traffic priority 
mechanism.  
By choosing α  parameter we can change the time 
that packets spend in the firewall buffer, which allows to 
limit access possibilities of background traffic and to 
block forbidden packets. So by decreasing the priority of 
background VCs and increasing the push-out probability 
α  we can reduce the VC throughput to low level without 
interrupting it. 
The most wide range of control can be reached in 
intermediate environment conditions when linear law of 
the losses has already been broken, but the saturation zone 
has not been reached yet. Numerical experiment [4] has 
been made to detect conditions in which

wide range from 0,1 to 2,5, and

PRACTICAL USAGE AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.  
Good example of opportunity to use such 
mechanism is the problem of controlling removed robotic 
object, which telemetry data and a video stream are 
transmitted on global networks. In this case control 
commands are transmitted by TCP, and a video stream 
data are transmitted by UDP. A mean values of 
throughput of our robotic object: throughput of TCP 
channel (control and telemetry packets) ~100Kb/s, 
throughput of UDP video stream ~1,2Mb/s. 
 
 
 
Figure 11.  The scheme of space experiment "Contour" 
 
In a considered example on Fig. 11 (ROKVISS 
mission [5]), the choice of a priority of service and loss-
probability of a priority packet α  allows to balance such 
indicators of functioning of a network, as loss-probability 
of control packets 
 and quality of video stream for 
various conditions of a network environment. The 
parameter 
(1)
loss
p
α  can vary for delay minimization in a control 
system’s feedback. 
The given problem is important for interactive 
control of remote real-time dynamic objects, in a case 
when the complex computer network is the component of 
a feedback control contour, therefore minimization of 
losses and feedback delays, is the important parameter 
characterizing an effectiveness of control system. 
In future this method of preemptive access 
management could be used to mature the DTN technology  
for space exploration missions and communications 
architecture for example for robots control on planet’s 
surface from orbital station through the network 
environment with unstable throughputs and unpredictable 
packet delays. 
Of course in this case two types of priority are not 
enough for enforce access policy in multiservice network 
environment, but the recurrent mode of proposed 
procedure can increase the number of priority VC subsets.

VII. CONCLUSION.  
1. The offered access control approach allows more 
deeply and more detailed understanding of requirements of 
access policy in the form of firewall configuration rules. 
2. Proposed model based on DiffServ approach 
considers computer network as the set of VCs, which 
throughput is easy controlled by proposed classification 
procedure and algorithm that divides the set of non 
forbidden VCs in two subsets: non forbidden priority 
connections and non forbidden non priority or background 
connections. 
3. Introduced VC model takes into account several 
parameters such as: dynamic and statistics characteristics 
including fractal properties of VC with feedback 
throughput control like TCP. 
4. Considered preemptive queueing mechanism can be 
viewed as a background for DiffServ access control 
because it provides a wide range packet loss probability 
ratio using flexible randomized push-out algorithm. 
5. Proposed push-out algorithm based on selecting 
priority parameter controls packet loss probability taking 
into account restricted capacity of packet buffer in 
DiffServ access point. The most interesting result obtained 
in congested network allows to keep priority VC 
throughput near the requested value, which is important for 
specific space experiment with robotics arm on ISS board.
