Abstract— This work is a follow-up to our previous study “2D 
Virtual Learning Environments for Tertiary Education”, which 
was carried out in 2022. The main focus was to analyze the 
suitability of a 2D Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for 
tertiary education using the desktop based 2D immersive 
environment 'gather.town'. The study was conducted with a 
selected course of a Master's program at the Technical 
University of Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt over one 
semester. Accompanying the course, subjects were asked to 
complete the Online Learning Environment Survey (OLLES) 
questionnaire weekly for analysis, and additional qualitative 
interviews were conducted afterwards. The descriptive analysis 
suggests that the immersive 2D environment used is holistically 
suitable as a learning environment in the tertiary sector, due to 
high and very high values for presence, participation, 
collaboration and active learning. For this paper, two seminars 
were conducted using Virtual Learning Environments, one of 
them in ‘gather.town’ and the other in ‘Zoom’. In addition to 
the OLLES questionnaire and the qualitative interviews, the 
Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) was also queried. 
Additionally, the exam grades were also collected as a 
performance measure. This made it possible to compare the 
different learning environments. When comparing the 
questionnaires, only some dimensions showed a difference 
between Virtual 2D Learning Environments and Classic Video 
Conferencing Systems. In contrast, with exam grades, subjects 
were found to perform better with Virtual 2D Learning 
Environments than with Classic Video Conferencing Systems.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
This contribution is based on the first step of the study 
published in 2022 in the International Journal on Advances in 
Systems and Measurements, vol. 15, no. 3 & 4 with the title 
“2D Virtual Learning Environments for Tertiary Education” 
[1]. As the main result of the study, the high scores of the 
OLLES [2] questionnaire can be mentioned. In connection 
with the interviews, it can be said that an Immersive 2D 
Environment can be used holistically as a form of teaching 
and has advantages over Classic Video Transmission Tools. 
As a practical implication, it can be deduced that the use of 
Virtual Learning Environments in the tertiary sector, on the 
one hand, can be relatively easily deployed with existing 
software solutions and, on the other hand, are also well 
received and therefore offer benefits for students.  
Nevertheless, this first study was only an overview of the 
use of an immersive 2D environment as a learning tool within 
tertiary education. Group comparisons with other teaching 
formats were not possible. Therefore, this is the goal for this 
research. Here, the same teaching unit is being tested again in 
gather.town and at the same time another teaching unit is 
being tested in Zoom. Again, the OLLES questionnaire is used 
and additionally the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) [3]. 
The IPQ is a scale for measuring the sense of presence 
experienced in a Virtual Environment (VE). The qualitative 
interviews were also be used again for data collection. In 
Figure 1, there is an overview of the timeline and the different 
learning environments and measuring instruments.

The definitions and explanations for the basic terms, as 
well as the overview of studies and related works about 
Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) and Virtual Reality 
(VR) in higher education were made in the study from 2022 
[1]. 
Additional, to the literature review from our study in 2022 
[1], there were several new studies published about 
educational online learning, especially with Learning 
Management Systems (LMS) like Moodle and Video 
Conference Systems, especially Zoom [4] - [8]. In addition, 
many studies about the phenomenon of “Zoom fatigue” were 
published [9] - [13] which underlines the need for alternative 
online Learning Environments like low immersive Desktop 
Environments. Probably because of this need, several studies 
appeared with gather.town as one example for this kind of 
Virtual Environment. Lo and Song [14] performed a review 
of the empirical studies in gather.town and revealed that there 
is still a lack in studies besides computer science courses, the 
examination of student’s behavior and learning achievements. 
The authors also found out, that most of the studies had only 
a short duration and suggest studies with a longer duration. 
With this study, we evaluate Virtual Learning Environments 
over several semesters in the context of seminars, not in 
computer science, but in business administration. We also 
include exam grades for learning outcomes. With these 
conditions, we fulfill some of the requirements for further 
research. To summarize, so far we have looked descriptively 
at the suitability of 2D Virtual Learning Environments for 
tertiary education and now we want to test this statistically by 
means of a first comparison of 2D Virtual Learning 
Environments and Classic Video Conferencing Systems. 
Following in Section 2, we explain the method used. 
Section 3 resumes the results, which are then discussed in 
detail in Section 4 with some limitations. Section 5 forms the 
end of the paper and contains the conclusion with the main 
results and future studies. 
II. METHOD 
In the following, we present the immersive learning 
environment gather.town, in which the course took place, and 
the measuring instruments OLLES and IPQ, which were used 
for the assessment. In addition, qualitative interviews were 
subsequently conducted with some of the subjects, which will 
also be presented here. 
A. Immersive 2D environment gather.town 
The software gather.town [15] was used as an immersive 
2D environment. This is a web conferencing software, which 
allows to create a complete virtual replica of the teaching 
building. Within this virtual space, users can move around 
using avatars and interact with each other and their 
environment, similar to real life. If the avatars now walk 
around in the Virtual Environment and then meet each other 
at a certain distance, the camera and the microphone of the 
computers are automatically switched on, and the users have 
the opportunity to communicate. The graphical user interface 
is quite simple and it does not demand any special 
requirements to run on a variety of computers. In preparation, 
the entire real seminar building was recreated in the 
gather.town 
environment 
and 
the 
following 
Virtual 
Environment settings and software features were used: 
The podium is the classic teaching situation, as shown in 
Figure 2. Within the gather.town environment, all students 
and the tutor are in one large room. The tutor stands in front 
at the lectern, while the students take their places at the tables. 
All students can see, hear and, of course, communicate with 
each other via camera and microphone. It is possible to share 
the screen to provide lecture slides or other content to all 
participants in the plenum area. In this way, the tutor can use 
lecture slides in addition to a verbal execution of the learning 
topic, as they would be used in a real teaching situation. 
We refer to our publication in 2022 [1] for explanation of 
the features “Workshop”, “Whiteboard”, “Break Rooms” with 
games and yoga room, and “Interactive elements”. 
B. Video conference tool Zoom 
Zoom is one of the Classic Video Conferencing Tools with 
quite wide spread usage for education, especially during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, but also after reopening universities in 
2021 [4] [16]. With Zoom, it is possible for one or more 
people to interact through chat messages, video based visual 
communication, and group work [17]. Besides the 
communication in the whole group of participants, it is also 
possible to create subgroups (Break out rooms) for group 
work or group discussions. There is also the possibility to 
share the screen with other participants, to do little surveys 
and to use a whiteboard. The classic appearance is the monitor 
full of video tiles with the participants of the Zoom meeting, 
as shown in Figure 3.

C. Measuring instrument 
The OLLES questionnaire in its modified 35-item form 
was used as the measurement instrument [2]. The OLLES 
questionnaire is a web-based survey instrument for use in 
online learning environments in tertiary education. In this 
context, the OLLES questionnaire provides inferences about 
students' perceptions of interaction opportunities within an 
online environment in terms of economy and efficiency. The 
dimensions of the OLLES are Student Collaboration (SC), 
Computer Competence (CC), Active Learning (AL), Tutor 
Support (TS), Information Design and Appeal (IDA), Material 
Environment (ME), and Reflective Thinking (RT). In 
addition, questions about general computer use and Internet 
use were also recorded. All items were measured on a 5-point 
Likert scale [18]. 
The IPQ [3] was also used. The IPQ is a scale for 
measuring the sense of presence experienced in a Virtual 
Environment. Here, the sense of presence is understood as the 
subjective sense of being in a Virtual Environment. Also, the 
igroup.org project consortium states that: “the sense of 
presence can be separated from the ability of a technology to 
immerse a user. While this immersion is a variable of the 
technology and can be described objectively, presence is a 
variable of a user's experience. Therefore, we obtain measures 
of the sense of presence from subjective rating scales.” The 
IPQ has three subscales and one additional general item not 
belonging to a subscale. The three subscales are Spatial 
Presence (the sense of being physically present in the VE), 
Involvement (measuring the attention devoted to the VE and 
the involvement experienced) and Experienced Realism 
(measuring the subjective experience of realism in the VE). 
There is also a general item that assesses the general “sense of 
being there”. This item has high loadings on all three factors, 
with an especially strong loading on Spatial Presence. The 
original questionnaire was constructed in German, so we used 
this one, since the subjects are German native speakers. All 
items were measured on a 7-point Likert scale with a range 
from 0 to 6 [18]. 
For the qualitative interviews, a separate questionnaire 
was developed, which can be viewed in full in our previous 
paper [1] where the same questionnaire was used. First, an 
introductory question was asked in order to lead the test 
persons into the interview situation in a relaxed manner and to 
check whether they could still remember the seminar well 
within the Virtual Learning Environment. Building on this, at 
least one question was asked about each dimension of the 
OLLES to develop a deeper understanding of why one of the 
dimensions had performed well or poorly. In addition, the 
questions of the questionnaire still investigate whether the 
subjects prefer face-to-face classes, a Virtual Learning 
Environment such as gather.town or Classic Video 
Conferencing Software such as Zoom and why this is so. 
Finally, the questionnaire examines whether the Virtual 
Learning Environment gather.town was also used outside the 
actual seminar and, if so, for what other purposes. In addition, 
questions are asked about the highlights and shortcomings of 
the software used. 
Furthermore, exam grades were collected as a form of 
performance measure. 
D. Experimental procedure 
Even before the first seminar, all test persons were 
familiarized with the gather.town environment resp. the Zoom 
environment. In particular, the basic functions were tested, so 
that everybody knows them and can use them independently. 
In addition, the OLLES questionnaire was introduced, since 
this was used in its original English language, but the test 
persons were not native English speakers. 
Both seminars were held over 5 days each, with one 
teaching session starting in the early afternoon and lasting 5-
6 school lessons each. Both seminars were held exclusively in 
their respective VE used. There were a total of two time 
measurement points, one after the first seminar and one after 
the last seminar. Both questionnaires were completed online 
directly after the seminar. 
The qualitative interviews were collected a few days after 
the last seminar, but they were conducted within gather.town 
resp. Zoom. An appointment was made with a respondent 
within gather.town resp. Zoom, where the interview was 
conducted and the audio track was recorded. The audio track 
was then transcribed, analyzed and interpreted. 
E. Sample 
All data were collected at the Technical University of 
Applied Sciences Würzburg-Schweinfurt within the seminars 
“Scenario Based Strategic Planning” (from here just 
“Strategy”) 
and 
“Trend 
Analysis 
and 
Innovation 
Measurement” (from here just “Trend”) of the master study 
program “Integrated Innovation Management”. The seminar 
“Strategy” was held in gather.town and the seminar “Trend” 
was held in Zoom, as shown in Figure 1. 
For the seminar Strategy, a total of 19 subjects 
participated. However, only 16 subjects completed the 
questionnaires. This leaves n = 16 valid subjects for the final 
analysis. The average age of the subjects is 25.19 years, with 
a minimum of 22 years and a maximum of 33 years. Of the n 
= 16 subjects, 5 are female (31.3 %) and 11 are male (68,7 %). 
In addition, it must be noted that only 11 subjects could be 
used for the comparison of the two measurement points, since 
only these 11 subjects completely filled out the two 
questionnaires. For the remaining statistics, however, all 16 
subjects can be used. In addition, for a performance 
comparison in the form of the scores, the scores of all 19 
subjects of the seminar were used. Five randomly selected 
subjects were used for the qualitative interviews. Afterwards, 
it was checked to what extent the answers of the subjects 
overlapped or whether new insights could still be gained with 
further surveys, but a feeling of saturation set in. Therefore, n 
= 5 interviews were considered sufficient. Of the n = 5 
subjects, 3 are female and 2 are male. 
For the seminar Trend, a total of 19 subjects participated. 
However, only 17 subjects completed the questionnaires. This 
leaves n = 17 valid subjects for the final analysis. The average 
age of the subjects is 25.06 years, with a minimum of 22 years 
and a maximum of 33 years. Of the n = 17 subjects, 6 are 
female (35.3 %) and 11 are male (64.7 %). In addition, it must 
be noted that only 10 subjects could be used for the

comparison of the two measurement points, since only these 
10 subjects completely filled out the two questionnaires. For 
the remaining statistics, however, all 17 subjects can be used. 
For a performance comparison in the form of the scores, the 
scores of all 19 subjects of the seminar were used. 
Four randomly selected subjects were used for the 
qualitative interviews. Afterwards, it was checked to what 
extent the answers of the subjects overlapped or whether new 
insights could still be gained with further surveys, but a 
feeling of saturation set in. Therefore, n = 4 interviews were 
considered sufficient. Of the n = 4 subjects, 2 are female and 
2 are male. 
III. RESULTS 
The results section is divided into different areas. First, 
there is a statistical part in which the time measurement points 
of the individual subjects are compared to see if there is a 
difference between the first time measurement point after the 
first seminar unit and the last time measurement point at the 
end of all seminar units. This is complemented by a purely 
descriptive part, in which the mean values of the OLLES and 
IPQ questionnaires are considered. Thereafter is the part in 
which the results of the qualitative interviews are presented. 
Both of these parts are again subdivided into the individual 
seminars. Lastly, there is a statistical part. In this part, first 
there are group comparisons related to the values of the 
OLLES and IPQ questionnaires. The data from our previous 
paper [1] will also be used. Finally, there is a group 
comparison of the exam grades as a performance measure. 
A. Results for “Strategy” using gather.town 
First, the Wilcoxon test will be used to examine whether 
there are differences in the OLLES test between the individual 
time measurement points and thus whether there was a change 
in the evaluation with regard to the repetition of the use of 
gather.town. 
Two time measurement points were not available for all 
16 subjects, therefore the following Wilcoxon test was only 
calculated with n = 11 complete subjects. 
The Wilcoxon test showed that there was no difference 
between time measurement point 1 and time measurement 
point 2 regarding the OLLES questionnaire. 
Next, using the Wilcoxon test will be used to examine 
whether there are differences in the IPQ test between the 
individual time measurement points and thus whether there 
was a change in the evaluation with regard to the repetition of 
the use of the gather.town environment. 
There was a significant difference of the variable G 
(General Presence). The statistic test is z = -2.850 and the 
associated significance value is p = .002. Thus, the difference 
is significant: the central tendencies of the two time 
measurement points differ (Asymptotic Wilcoxon test: z = -
2.85, p = .002, n = 11). 
For the other scales, there was no significant difference 
between time measurement point 1 and time measurement 
point 2. 
The next step is a descriptive analysis of the mean value 
variables of both time measurement points together. This also 
includes all measured values regardless of whether there were 
only one or two time measurement points for a subject. 
In terms of computer use, it was found that all subjects use 
their computers daily or at least several times a week. In the 
case of Internet use, it was found that all subjects use the 
Internet on a daily basis. 
A test for normal distribution of the OLLES dimensions 
revealed that the dimensions Student Collaboration (SC), 
Information Design and Appeal (IDA), Material Environment 
(ME), and Reflective Thinking (RT) are normally distributed 
and the dimensions Computer Competence (CC), Active 
Learning (AL), and Tutor Support (TS) are not normally 
distributed. Those descriptive values can be seen in Table 1. 
A test for normal distribution for the dimensions of the 
IPQ revealed that the General Presence (G), Spatial Presence 
(SP), and Involvement (INV) variables were normally 
distributed, and the Experienced Realism (REAL) variable 
was not normally distributed. Those descriptive values can be 
seen in Table 2. 
Next are the results of the qualitative questionnaire. A 
complete overview of the guideline interview can be found in 
our previous paper [1] and can be referred to for better 
understanding. Question 1 revealed that all subjects could still 
remember the seminar and the use of gather.town well to very 
well. Question 2 revealed that cooperation within gather.town 
was rated as sufficient to good. Walking around and 
interaction opportunities were rated positively. Beyond that, 
however, additional tools for collaborative workshops like, 
e.g., Miro [19] outside from the gather.town environment 
were more likely to be used. Nevertheless, further inquiry 
revealed that most subjects indicated that there was enough 
opportunity for successful collaboration. However, some also 
said that it was somewhat difficult for them to assess this, 
since they had only used a few functions themselves. Question 
3 showed that although there were sometimes technical 
problems in using gather.town, as an example the browser 
compatibility, the use itself was always understandable and 
simple and therefore it did not represent a technical hurdle. 
Question 4 showed mixed responses. Some subjects found 
gather.town motivating because it has a certain gaming 
character and thus offers more functions and possibilities than 
Zoom, for example. On the other hand, however, it was also 
increasingly noted that concentration suffers in online 
seminars and a general demotivation takes place, since the 
exchange is missing and the classroom is generally preferred. 
This was also confirmed by the query. Walking around 
independently in gather.town is more motivating than Classic 
Video Conferencing Tools, but more demotivating than a 
seminar in a real classroom. Question 5 and the related query 
revealed that the tutor's contact and accessibility was good and 
enough opportunities were given for feedback, and further 
questions were answered quickly. Based on question 6, it was 
found that the learning materials were perceived in a very 
mixed way. However, the query showed that the learning 
environment apart from the learning materials was perceived 
as very interesting and appealing. Especially the "Pokémon 
charm" was very appealing and cute. Question 7 showed that 
the test persons assess their learning success minimally better

than with Classic Video Conferencing Tools, however, they 
generally assess their learning success online lower than in 
presence, even if the test persons think that this does not 
necessarily have an effect on the grades, nevertheless felt on 
the knowledge that remains at the end. Question 8 further 
confirmed that subjects prefer gather.town over Classic Video 
Conferencing Tools like Zoom because it offers more 
interaction options, facilitates individual conversations, it is 
very easy to log in, and is generally more dynamic. However, 
there was also one respondent who preferred Zoom simply out 
of habit. Question 9 then went on to confirm that all subjects 
preferred face-to-face lectures. The main reasons for this are 
that one can interact best with each other, there is also a 
physical exchange with people, it is more personal and one is 
less distracted than at home. Question 10 showed that some 
subjects also used gather.town outside of the lecture for quick 
communication for projects, or in the work context. However, 
some did not continue to use it. Finally, question 11 and the 
two follow-up questions showed that it would be better to 
integrate additional tools, but gather.town was generally well 
received due to the diversity as well as physical activation 
(e.g. yoga) and provides a lot of potential for creative things. 
Isolated connection problems and browser incompatibility 
were mentioned as negative points. 
B. Results for “Trend” using Zoom 
First, the Wilcoxon test will be used to examine whether 
there are differences in the OLLES test between the individual 
time measurement points and thus whether there was a change 
in the evaluation with regard to the repetition of the use of 
Zoom. 
Two time measurement points were not available for all 
17 subjects, therefore, the following Wilcoxon test was only 
calculated with n = 10 complete subjects. 
The Wilcoxon test showed that there was no difference 
between time measurement point 1 and time measurement 
point 2 regarding the OLLES questionnaire. 
Next, using the Wilcoxon test will be used to examine 
whether there are differences in the IPQ test between the 
individual time measurement points and thus whether there 
was a change in the evaluation with regard to the repetition of 
the use of the Zoom. 
The Wilcoxon test showed that there was no difference 
between time measurement point 1 and time measurement 
point 2 regarding the IPQ. 
       The next step is a descriptive analysis of the mean value 
variables of both time measurement points together. This also 
includes all measured values regardless of whether there were 
only one or two time measurement points for a subject. 
In terms of computer use, it was found that all subjects use 
their computers daily or at least several times a week. In the 
case of Internet use, it was found that all subjects use the 
Internet on a daily basis. 
A test for normal distribution of the OLLES dimensions 
revealed that the dimensions Student Collaboration (SC), 
Information Design and Appeal (IDA), Material Environment

(ME), and Reflective Thinking (RT) are normally distributed 
and the dimensions Computer Competence (CC), Active 
Learning (AL), and Tutor Support (TS) are not normally 
distributed. Those descriptive values can be seen in Table 3. 
A test for normal distribution for the dimensions of the 
IPQ revealed that the General Presence (G), Spatial Presence 
(SP), and Involvement (INV) variables were normally 
distributed, and the Experienced Realism (REAL) variable 
was not normally distributed. Those descriptive values can be 
seen in Table 4. 
Next are the results of the qualitative questionnaire. A 
complete overview of the guideline interview can be found in 
our previous paper [1] and can be referred to for better 
understanding. Question 1 revealed that all subjects could still 
remember the seminar and the use of Zoom well to very well. 
Question 2 revealed that cooperation within Zoom was rated 
as sufficient to good. Further inquiry revealed that most 
subjects indicated that there was enough opportunity for 
successful collaboration. However, there were problems with 
collaboration due to a lack of a personal level, which was 
especially exacerbated by cameras being turned off. Question 
3 showed that there were no technical problems in using Zoom 
and the use itself was always understandable and simple. 
Question 4 revealed that the use of Zoom mostly demotivated 
the subjects. One respondent, however, stated that he was 
more motivated because of the time saved. Time saving was 
more often mentioned as a positive point while less 
involvement and more distraction at home were mentioned as 
negative points. One respondent therefore also felt that the 
sense of learning together is lost somewhere. Question 5 and 
the related query revealed that the tutor's contact and 
accessibility was good and enough opportunities were given 
for feedback, and further questions were answered quickly. 
Based on question 6, it was found that the learning materials 
were perceived in a very mixed way. However, the query 
showed that the learning environment apart from the learning 
materials was perceived as very neutral, sometimes even 
boring, but sufficient to fulfill the purpose. Question 7 showed 
that the test persons assess their learning success much worse 
than in presence. Only one respondent stated that he might 
have even better learning success than in presence, because 
this allowed him to focus exclusively on the learning content. 
Based on question 8, a mixed opinion emerged. Some subjects 
prefer Zoom because Zoom contains fewer distractions from 
game-like elements. Exactly the opposite, some subjects 
prefer gather.town because of playful elements, as these 
promote interpersonal relationships and group work. It was 
often said that the more interactive and intensive the group 
work, the more likely they would choose gather.town, but 
Zoom is perfectly adequate for normal lectures. Question 9 
then went on to confirm that most subjects preferred face-to-
face lectures. The main reasons for this are that it is more

personal, and they prefer the physical exchange with people 
before and after a lecture. They can also pay more attention 
when they are present, and they are less likely to be distracted. 
However, one respondent also prefers Zoom because of the 
time and cost savings in particular. Question 10 showed that 
some subjects also used Zoom outside of the lecture for 
projects, or in the work context. Others used it only during the 
time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, question 11 and the 
two follow-up questions showed that Zoom is simple, runs 
stably and the important functions are well integrated. 
However, it is easier to sit back and turn off the cameras, and 
this means that the group loses a lot. 
C. Group Comparisons 
The following is a comparison of all three seminars 
conducted to date. These are the seminar Trend held in 
gather.town [1], the seminar Strategy held in gather.town and 
the seminar Trend held in Zoom. For an overview, see Figure 
1. First, the results of the OLLES and the IPQ questionnaire 
are compared. Afterwards, the exam grades are compared as 
a performance measure. 
First, the seminar Trend (gather.town) was tested with the 
seminar Strategy (gather.town). In total, the data of 32 
subjects are compared. There are 16 from Trend (gather.town) 
and 16 from Strategy (gather.town). The Mann-Whitney U 
test showed no significance for any variable. The computer 
and Internet variables remained without significant difference, 
as did the OLLES variables. The IPQ could not be tested here, 
because no survey of the IPQ was conducted for the seminar 
Trend (gather.town). 
Second, the seminar Trend (gather.town) was tested with 
the seminar Trend (Zoom). In total, 33 subjects are compared. 
There are 16 from Trend (gather.town) and 17 from Trend 
(Zoom). Here, the IPQ also could not be tested. The Mann-
Whitney U test showed a significant difference in the Active 
Learning (AL) and Information Design and Appeal (IDA) 
variables of the OLLES. 
Subjects in the gather.town learning environment perceive 
Active Learning (Mdn = 3.6) better than subjects in the Zoom 
learning environment (Mdn = 3.0), asymptotic Mann-Whitney 
U test: U = 57.000, p = .004. Cohen's effect size is r = .50, 
corresponding to a strong effect. 
Subjects in the gather.town learning environment perceive 
the Information Design and Appeal (Mdn = 3.6) better than 
subjects in the Zoom learning environment (Mdn = 3.2), 
asymptotic Mann-Whitney U test: U = 57.000, p = .004. 
Cohen's effect size is r = .50, corresponding to a strong effect. 
Last, the seminar Strategy (gather.town) was tested with 
the seminar Trend (Zoom). In total 33 subjects are compared. 
There are 16 from Strategy (gather.town) and 17 from Trend 
(Zoom). The Mann-Whitney U test showed only a significant 
difference in the General Presence (G) variable of the IPQ. 
Subjects in the gather.town learning environment 
perceived General Presence (Mdn = 1.25) better than subjects 
in the Zoom learning environment (Mdn = .00), asymptotic 
Mann-Whitney U test: U = 73.000, p = .019. Cohen's effect 
size is r = .41, corresponding to a medium effect. 
When comparing grades, the seminar Trend (gather.town) 
is compared with the seminar Trend (Zoom) first. In total 36 
subjects are compared. There are 17 from Trend (gather.town) 
and 19 from Trend (Zoom). The Mann-Whitney U test 
showed a significant difference. 
Subjects in the gather.town learning environment have 
better grades (Mdn = 1.7, low values represent better grades) 
than subjects in the Zoom learning environment (Mdn = 1.9), 
asymptotic Mann-Whitney U test: U = 90.000, p = .021. 
Cohen's effect size is r = .38, corresponding to a medium 
effect. 
IV. DISCUSSION 
In the dimensions of computer use and Internet use, the 
subjects indicated that they use this on a daily basis. In 
addition, the gather.town environment as well as the Zoom 
environment and all basic functions were sufficiently 
explained before the start of the study. Thus, we assume that 
there were no poor ratings for the environments due to 
possible lack of technical skills. 
The test whether there were differences between different 
time measurement points showed the following results. With 
the Strategy seminar and the OLLES questionnaire there was 
no difference in the time measurement points and with the 
IPQ, there was a difference in scale G (General Presence). The 
difference in scale G could be explained by the fact that it 
consists of only one question item and therefore reacts much 
more strongly to minimal deviations. At the seminar Trend, 
no significant difference was found between the two time 
measurement points for either the OLLES or the IPQ. 
Although a meta-study by Merchant et al. [20] found small 
effects in simulation studies in terms of number of sessions, 
these were measures of learning outcome and not an 
assessment of the immersive environment as in this study. In 
our previous paper [1], there were also no significant 
differences at several different time measurement points. 
Therefore, it can be assumed that it is sufficient to query the 
questionnaires once. 
If one compares the statements of the qualitative 
questionnaires, it becomes clear that the same statements can 
be found repeatedly. Almost all subjects showed a hierarchy 
in their preferred choice of teaching styles. Classroom 
teaching is clearly preferred. This is followed by the use of 2D 
Virtual Environments. Classic Video Conferencing Systems 
are least preferred. If we take a closer look at this hierarchy, 
we can see that the more opportunities for interaction and the 
more personal a teaching style is, the more it is preferred. 
Subjects consistently said they preferred gather.town over 
Zoom because they had more human proximity and also more 
opportunities to interact with other students. Nevertheless, 
ideally, they would like face-to-face teaching. This statement 
seems to be even more prevalent after the COVID-19 
pandemic. However, it also became clear that simple lectures 
could be replaced more easily by online teaching than 
seminars in which the focus is on working together. 
The group comparisons showed that a comparison of two 
different seminars with different subjects in gather.town 
nevertheless resulted in equal evaluations of the Virtual 
Learning Environment regarding the OLLES questionnaire. 
Therefore, stable valuations can be assumed here. A 
comparison of the same seminar with different Virtual

Learning Environments showed that gather.town scored 
significantly higher on the Active Learning (AL) and 
Information Design and Appeal (IDA) dimensions of the 
OLLES questionnaire than Zoom. However, this result could 
not be repeated for different seminars and different Virtual 
Learning Environments. There was a significant difference in 
the G scale of the IPQ, with gather.town showing a higher 
general presence than Zoom. The Active Learning (AL) 
dimension of the OLLES specifically asks about the 
motivation created, as well as the feedback received through 
the activities or the teaching unit within the environment itself. 
Again, various studies already showed that motivation [21] - 
[25] is a crucial factor in the use of VLE's. That there was 
increased motivation was confirmed by the interviews. The 
motivation arose primarily through increased interactivity. 
For the test persons, it was clearly more motivating to walk 
through the Virtual Environment by moving the avatar and not 
just to sit in front of the laptop. This also led to the 
environment being perceived as very varied. The dimension 
Information Design and Appeal (IDA) of the OLLES asks in 
particular how creative and original presented teaching 
materials are and whether graphics used are helpful and 
visually appealing. This mainly refers to the teaching slides 
presented as if they were in a presentation. Since the same 
learning materials were used here, this difference is difficult 
to explain. It is possible that the actual learning environment 
was included in the evaluation and not just the learning 
materials. Perhaps this double assessment was due to the fact 
that, in this particular case, it was not always clear to the 
subjects what the individual question items referred to in this 
dimension. The scale G (General Presence) of the IPQ asks 
solely about the sense of being there. This feeling could not 
be created at all with Zoom and at least minimally with 
gather.town. However, only in one of the two tests with 
different seminars. Whether there is an influence of the 
seminar on the evaluation of a Virtual Learning Environment 
is difficult to say. Nevertheless, the results found could also 
be due to a still small sample size. Statistically, however, the 
difference between the two Virtual Learning Environments 
turned out to be smaller than the qualitative interviews 
suggested. In the end, only partially significant differences in 
the evaluation could be found and these could not be repeated. 
Looking at the exam grades, a significant difference was 
found between the Virtual Learning Environments used. 
When using the gather.town environment, the subjects had 
better grades than using the Zoom environment. This is a 
medium effect. Although there was not much difference in the 
assessment of Virtual Learning Environments, it does seem to 
have an impact on performance measurement in the form of 
exam grades. The results also confirmed that it is only possible 
to compare the same seminars with each other. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This study shows that, according to the subjects, there is a 
hierarchy of teaching styles. Classroom teaching is the most 
popular form. This is due to the direct contact with fellow 
students, greater motivation and the best possible opportunity 
for interaction in order to solve tasks in a team and learn 
together. This is followed by the use of a 2D Virtual Learning 
Environment. Here, direct contact is much more limited than 
in face-to-face teaching, but this can be partially replaced by 
the use of avatars and the resulting interaction possibilities. 
Thus, the test participants are also motivated to use the Virtual 
Learning Environment. The most unpopular are Classic Video 
Conference Systems. These have the least interaction 
possibilities and are therefore perceived as demotivating. This 
hierarchy, especially the preference of face-to-face personal 
teaching is confirmed by several other studies [26] - [29]. Also 
the preference for gather.town as 2D Desktop VR to Zoom as 
Classic Video Conferencing Tool can be explained and

confirmed by several studies [30] - [33]. It seems to be 
important to use VLE that are innovative, social emotional, 
and engage formal and informal communication, which seems 
to be better solved within the Virtual 2D Learning 
Environment gather.town.  
In an evaluation of Virtual 2D Learning Environments and 
Classic Video Conference Systems using the OLLES and IPQ 
questionnaire, however, this could only be shown for some 
dimensions or scales. Contrary to the statements of the 
qualitative interviews, the quantitative evaluation of the two 
online teaching formats therefore seems to make no or only a 
very small difference. In contrast, when exam grades were 
measured as a performance measure, subjects were found to 
perform better with Virtual 2D Learning Environments than 
with Classic Video Conference Systems. Thus, the use of 2D 
Virtual Learning Environments seems to be a better choice 
than Classic Video Conference Systems for successful online 
teaching. However, it must also be noted here, that this is a 
field study and therefore the number of subjects is low. Future 
work needs to clarify whether face-to-face teaching also leads 
to the best performance measures. In addition, other online 
forms of teaching will also be tested. For this purpose, it is 
initially planned to hold the same seminars as in this study in 
the next semester once in face-to-face teaching and once in a 
Virtual 3D Learning Environment. An overview can be seen 
in Figure 4. 
Since it has been found that realism plays an important 
factor in the evaluation of Virtual Learning Environments, this 
will also be used to explore which factors contribute to a 
higher degree of realism. For example, the change from a 2D 
learning environment to a 3D learning environment with 3D 
avatars could be an improvement. This could then be seen 
with a better IPQ rating. In addition, this study will be 
extended to the application of I-VR environments, as soon as 
this can be implemented with enough test persons, since 
sufficient equipment must be available and software must 
offer all necessary functions. Now, there are many indications 
that hybrid forms of teaching and learning will be used in the 
future. Above all, the type of seminar also plays a role. 
Roughly speaking, the more interactive the seminar, the more 
opportunities for interaction are required and the more the 
seminar should tend towards classroom teaching. It also 
shows that personal contact cannot be replaced and that this 
provides more motivation for learning. In the end, the goal 
should always be to provide the best possible teaching and 
learning experience for all involved.
