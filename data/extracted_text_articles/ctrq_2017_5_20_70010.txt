Abstract— A cascading failure is a failure in a system of 
interconnected parts, in which the breakdown of one element 
can lead to the subsequent collapse of the others. Cascading 
effect is quite common in power grids and can also frequently 
occur in computer networks (such as the Internet). In this 
paper, we consider systems composed of components having 
interdependence and cascading effect. For this, based on the 
notion of conditional failure rate, a new bivariate distribution 
for modelling the lifetimes of dependent components is 
constructed. 
A 
comparison 
of 
systems 
having 
interdependence and cascading effect with those having 
independent components is also performed.

 INTRODUCTION 
Dependent 
random 
quantities 
can 
frequently 
be 
encountered in practice and they have been modelled by 
using bivariate distributions. In the literature, various 
specific parametric models for bivariate distributions have 
been suggested and studied [1]-[4]. A good review on the 
modelling of multivariate survival models can be found in 
[5]. An excellent encyclopedic survey of various bivariate 
distributions can be found in [6]. 
In this paper, we propose a new general class of 
dependent distributions, which is different from the previous 
models in [1]-[6]. The structure of this paper is as follows. 
In Section 2, taking into account the physics of failure of 
items and the interrelationship between them, we propose 
and discuss a general methodology for constructing a 
general class of bivariate distributions. In Section 3, based 
on the developed class, we study the lifetimes of systems 
having interdependence and cascading effect. Finally, in 
Section 4, concluding remarks are given. 
 
II. 
MODELLING BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTION 
Suppose that the system is composed of two components: 
component 1 and component 2 and they start to operate at 
time 
t  0
. The original lifetimes of components 1 and 2, 
when they start to operate, are described by the 
corresponding failure rates 
( )
1 t
 and 
( )
2 t
, respectively. 
These original lifetimes of components 1 and 2 are denoted 
by 
*
X1
 and 
*
X 2
, respectively, assuming that 
*
X1
 and 
*
X 2
 are stochastically independent.  
Similar to [1]’s model, we consider the practical situation 
when the failure of one component increases the stress of 
the other component, which results in the shortened residual 
lifetime of the remaining component. Under this type of 
dependency, we denote the corresponding eventual lifetimes 
of components 1 and 2 by 
1
X  and 
2
X , respectively.

the baseline distributions are Weibull (see [7]). Let

Thus, in this case, the lifetime of a system having 
interdependence components is the same as that of a system 
having independent components. Thus, this case is not 
relevant to the dependence structure of the proposed model. 
We now assume that the system is a parallel system. In 
this case, the lifetime of a system having interdependence 
components is

Figure 1. The survival functions. 
 
As can be seen from Figure 1, the survival function for the 
interdependent case is smaller than that for the independent 
case. For brevity, we have just considered two simple cases 
(series and parallel systems).  More complex cases could be 
considered in similar ways. 
IV. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
There have been studies on real systems with several 
interdependent components and with propagated and 
cascading effects (see, e.g., Mo et al. [8] and Bobbio et al. 
[9]). In this paper, a general methodology for constructing 
new general classes of bivariate distributions has been 
suggested. Based on the proposed class, the lifetimes of 
systems having interdependence and cascading effect have 
been studied. Based on the developed class, numerous 
bivariate distributions can further be generated and new 
issues on the estimation and testing of the model parameters 
should be discussed in the future studies. In this paper, our 
discussions are mainly focused on generating bivariate 
models. However, a similar approach could be applied to 
generate a new class of multivariate distributions. More 
detailed discussion on this issue is also given in Lee and 
Cha [7].
