Abstract— The hypothesis tested in chronic heart failure 
patients with inspiratory muscle weakness demonstrates that 
the Resistance Training results in further improvements 
compared to control in terms of dyspnea, cardiac, skeletal and 
inspiratory muscle function and quality of life. Twenty patients 
with ejection fraction ≤45% and inspiratory muscle weakness 
described by maximal inspiratory pressure <70% predicted, 
had undergone 3 exercise training sessions per week for 12 
weeks. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups: 
RT group or control group. RT performed at 60% of 1 
repetition maximum. Control group patients had no training at 
all. At the beginning and the end of the study, patients 
underwent pulmonary function test, respiratory muscle 
function test, echocardiography, exercise test, skeletal muscle 
function test, 6 minutes’ walk test and were evaluated for their 
quality of life using the Minnesota living with heart failure 
questionnaire. RT showed significant positive effects on 
ejection fraction, exercise test variables, functional capacity, 
respiratory muscle function, skeletal muscle strength and 
endurance as well as dyspnea and quality of life. Resistance 
training was superior to control in all parameters assessed, and 
most importantly in exercise time (68% versus 27%, P=0.008), 
respiratory muscle function (Maximal inspiratory pressure, 
60% versus 14%, P=0.001; Sustained maximal inspiratory 
pressure, 
71% 
versus 
non-significant 
improvement 
in 
resistance training group, P=0.022) and skeletal muscle 
endurance. However, no significants improvements were 
detected in control group patients. Resistance training has 
been applied to improve respiratory muscle strength in chronic 
heart failure patients. In addition, the resistance training was 
safe and resulted in additional benefits in cardiac, respiratory 
muscle and skeletal muscle function compared to the control.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Exercise intolerance, dyspnea and fatigue are the main 
obstacles that Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) patients face 
during their daily life activities [1]. These phenomena might 
contribute to physical impairment and result in a poor 
Quality of Life (QoL) [2]. Such restrictions happen as a 
consequence of reduction in skeletal muscle mass and 
strength, which might be explained by both qualitative and 
quantitative abnormalities [3]. In fact, there are histological 
and biochemical derangements expressed respectively by 
altered fibers distribution and reduced oxidative enzyme 
activity in addition to muscle metabolism impairment, 
mitochondrial changes, inflammation and muscle atrophy 
[4]. Skeletal muscle abnormalities are mainly characterized 
by muscle fiber type switch, fiber atrophy and muscle 
wasting, as well as the reduction in mitochondrial volume 
density and mitochondrial aerobic capacity [5–7]. Similar 
alterations have been detected in the respiratory muscle, 
with the exception of fiber type switch. In the peripheral 
skeletal muscles, the switch appeared to be in favor of type 
Ⅱb fast twitch fibers with low aerobic capacity that gets 
quickly fatigued [5] while respiratory muscles had a switch 
towards type Ⅰslow twitch fibers [5]. After a period of 
intense evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of exercise 
rehabilitation in CHF patients, exercise training was shown 
to be the cornerstone of cardiac rehabilitation programs.  
Because muscle dysfunction represents a hallmark of 
heart failure, the emphasis was on Resistance Training (RT), 
in order to restore the normal muscle structure and function 
[8]. For many years, bed rest and limited physical activity 
were recommended for all stages and forms of heart failure; 
while exercise was not suggested [9]. Nowadays, however, 
the concept of cardiac rehabilitation, including exercise 
training, and specifically RT, is well spotlighted and highly

recommended recently, mainly because of studies that show 
its benefits in various outcomes [6].  In fact, application of 
such programs induces significant histological, metabolic 
and functional adaptations in skeletal muscles, thereby, 
improving patient’s QoL. McKelvie was the first to 
demonstrate in 1995 that there are no significant differences 
between cycling and RT regarding left ventricle response in 
heart failure patients [10]. This study found similar results 
with those obtained from Meyer et al. where central 
hemodynamics was stable and well tolerated during 
resistance exercise [11]. In addition, from the research 
conducted by Grosse et al. who performed RT at 65% of 1 
Repetition Maximum (RM), an increase of 80–102% of 
muscular endurance and 14.5% of VO2peak was reported 
[12]. Pu et al. who performed RT at 80% of 1RM, also 
showed a 43% and 13% increase of muscular strength and 
Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), respectively [13].  
These findings are consistent with those of Levinger et al. 
who discovered 18% increase of muscular strength and 19% 
amelioration of VO2 peak after training patients at 40–80% 
of 
1RM 
[14]. 
As 
shown 
above, 
the 
significant 
improvements in muscle strength and endurance, the 
adaptation of muscle mass and the increase in the QoL and 
functional capacity had been proved by many researchers 
after RT [11] [13] [14]. Each study performs RT according 
to specific characteristics such as intensity, duration, 
frequency, number of repetitions and sets of exercise. 
Overall, these features should be taken into consideration to 
avoid any cardiovascular stress, and thereby any harmful 
consequence. The aim of our study is to determine the 
effects of RT on skeletal and respiratory muscle function, 
functional capacity, cardiac function, dyspnea [15] and QoL 
in patients with CHF. The paper proceeds as follows: 
Section II describes the experimental design, data are 
analyzed in Section III, Section IV presents the discussion 
and, finally, Section V draws the conclusions. 
II. 
METHODS 
 
A randomized, single-blinded, parallel controlled study 
was performed in patients who were diagnosed with stable 
CHF and inspiratory muscle weakness (IMW) [maximal 
inspiratory pressure (MIP) <70% predicted] and recruited 
from Beirut Cardiac Institute. 53 patients were assessed for 
eligibility and 33 were excluded due to some limitations 
(figure 1). Eligible subjects [Ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 45%, 
NYHA class II or III, diagnosed with CHF for more than 6 
months as long as there has been no admission to the 
hospital or any change in medications throughout the 
previous 3 months] were randomized to different exercising 
groups. Excluded subjects suffered from pulmonary 
limitation [Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and/or vital 
capacity <60% of predicted], orthopedic or neurologic 
disease, had a history of significant cardiac arrhythmia, a 
history of myocardial infarction or a cardiac surgery over 
the past 6 months, non-echogenic, unstable, poorly 
controlled blood pressure and/or end-stage HF.  
 
A written informed consent form was signed and 
obtained from all the participating subjects and all of them 
were receiving the same type of medication that included 
mainly beta blockers, Angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin II receptor blockers 
(ARB) and Diuretics.  
 
Furthermore, an approval for the experimental protocol 
was obtained from the Committee for Ethics in Research of 
Beirut Cardiac Institute. Since humans were included in this 
study, a certificate from the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) for Protecting Human Research Participants (PHRP) 
was obtained. The patients received detailed information 
and gave written informed consent before their inclusion in 
the study.

20 subjects were block randomized with 1:1 to 2 groups 
as shown in the consort diagram in Figure 1. Randomisation 
was conducted by using a research randomiser web site 
(Scott Plous and Jeff Breil, Lancaster, Pennsylvania). The 
patients were divided, thereafter, into two different groups: 
controls (n=10) and resistance (n=10) for 12 weeks (3 times 
/ week).  
Demographic, clinical characteristics and drug therapy 
lists for all patients were collected at the beginning and the 
end of the study. Arterial blood oxygen saturation and heart 
rate (HR) were monitored using VIAMED pulse oximetry, 
and blood pressure (BP) was measured using a 
sphygmomanometer prior to the initiation and after the 
termination of each exercise session.

A. Cardiac Function 
Echocardiography test: it is a test that makes an 
evaluation of the heart function possible. It creates images 
of the heart and helps in the analysis of different cardiac 
measures. Assessment of heart structure and function at rest 
was done using a Vivid S6 ultrasound probe (General 
electric healthcare GEMs supplies) where the patient was 
seated in a supine position. Two experienced cardiologists, 
blinded to subject’s allocation and his/her study period, 
performed the test.  
Measurements of ventricular volumes were assessed 
using the biplane method of disks (Biplane Simpson’s 
method) from an apical 4 chamber view. Noting that this 
method is highly recommended for measuring the LVEF 
[16]. 
B. Exercise Test  
Bruce treadmill protocol was used for the assessment of 
cardiovascular status during a progressive incremental 
exercise. Patients exercises on a treadmill with intensity and 
grade increasing progressively throughout the test following 
Bruce protocol. They also had ECG leads placed on their 
chests and a sphygmomanometer cuff for BP monitoring. 
Exercise time, grade, METs and BP were recorded during 
and after the test. 
C. Lung Function 
Pulmonary function was assessed using Digital 
Spirometer device. During this test, subjects were seated 
and instructed to inhale deeply through a mouthpiece well 
fitted between the lips and to exhale quickly and forcefully 
straight after. Air leakage was prevented by using a nose 
clip during the maneuver that was repeated three times to 
guarantee maximal performance.  
The important parameters detected through this test 
were: forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital 
capacity (FVC) and FEV1 to FVC ratio. 
D. Respiratory Muscle Strength 
Respiratory pressure meter (MicroRPM carefusion), a 
portable hand-held device, was used to measure MIP and 
maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). The results of the test 
were displayed on a screen in cmH2O. A PUMA PC 
Software that offers unique features could associate with the 
hand-held MicroRPM in order to improve its functionality. 
During this test, patients were instructed to tightly fit the 
mouthpiece attached to the instrument between both lips. 
Familiarization with the device and the ventilator operation 
was done before starting the test.  
To measure MIP, the subject had to exhale to residual 
volume then perform Mueller maneuver characterized by a 
forceful inhalation against the instrument as long as 
possible.  
To measure MEP, the subject must inhale to total lung 
capacity (TLC) and then exhale forcefully (Valsalva 
maneuver) over a minimum duration of 2 seconds. Both 
maneuvers were repeated at least 3 times in order to obtain 
the best values of MIP and MEP; noting that reported values 
were the maximum pressures sustained over a one second 
period. 
E. Respiratory muscle endurance  
To measure the endurance of the respiratory muscle, 
patients were instructed to breathe using Power Breathe set 
at 70% MIP/sustained maximal inspiratory pressure 
(SPImax). The maximum time (in seconds) tolerated was 
recorded and meant to evaluate inspiratory muscle 
endurance, SPImax/time. This test was repeated 3 times, with 
1-2 minute rest intervals. 
F. Leg Skeletal muscle function 
Skeletal 
Muscle 
Strength 
Test: 
A 
handheld 
dynamometer (Lafayette instrument) was used to assess the 
skeletal muscle strength by measuring the force generated 
by the quadriceps. Because this device is portable and light, 
the examination procedure is made easier. Before the test, 
the subjects had been familiarized with the operative device 
and the intended protocol. Patients were placed in an upright 
seated position at a knee and hip angulation of 60° and 120° 
respectively. Verbal encouragement was used during the test 
period. Maximum voluntary isometric force (MVIF) in kg 
was measured; three sets of three repetitions were given to 
each patient to develop maximum force with a 20 second 
rest period between each set. MVIF was reported as the 
average of the nine values taken. Peak force, average force 
and peak time were recorded by the device and transmitted 
to the computer software.  
Skeletal Muscle Endurance Test: 50% MVIF was used 
to assess skeletal muscle endurance. Patients were told to 
maintain 50% of the MVIF as long as possible until 
maximum tolerable elapsed time is recorded. The procedure 
was repeated three times separated by 5 minutes of rest. 
Endurance time was calculated as the average of the three 
sets. Verbal encouragement was given to patients before and 
during the test to achieve the best possible performance. 
G. Physical Activity 
Inclusion criteria for this study required that patients had 
a sedentary lifestyle to avoid bias since some patients might 
be following a specific activity program. Thus, in order to 
make sure that all the patients met the criteria, the short 
international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) [17] 
was used to assess the level of each patient’s physical 
activity. The questionnaire was administered over the phone 
or during the first office meeting. It is made up of 7 
questions the patients were asked to answer telling the time 
they spend doing an activity. The activities include those 
done at work, at home, yard work, exercise and others. 
H. Functional Capacity 
Functional capacity in CHF patients was predicted by 
using the 6 minute walk test (6MWT) [18], which is

evidenced to be reliable and reproducible. The test was 
performed in a 60-meter corridor under the supervision of a 
physical therapist. Initially, patients had been familiarized 
with the corridor space and the time needed to complete the 
test. BP, HR, and arterial oxygen saturation were measured 
before and after the test. A stopwatch was used to record the 
elapsed time as soon as the subject’s began the test. Patients 
were free to decrease their speed and stop if necessary. The 
test was repeated three times with 5 minutes of rest between 
sets. 
I. 
Dyspnea 
During each training session and during the exercise test, 
patients were asked to evaluate their exertion level using 
Borg scale [15].  
Borg scale provides information about perceived 
exertion but nothing on the level of difficulty of the 
exercise. The scale is a set of different intensity levels, 
where patients evaluate their exertion level using an 
attached visual numerical scale of 6 to 20 with 6 
corresponding to no fatigue or other symptoms and 20 to 
maximum exertion. Borg scale is known for its sensitivity 
and reproducibility to be used as a subjective reference 
during submaximal workouts [19]. 
J. 
Quality of Life 
QoL was assessed using Minnesota living with heart 
failure questionnaire (MLwHFQ), which was approved for 
the use in clinical practice and research [21]. MLFQ has 
been translated into and approved in Arabic. 
This questionnaire is composed of 21 items used to 
qualify physical and emotional aspects. A grading scale that 
evaluates the degree of HF impact on the QoL, with 0 
(none) to 5 (very much), was used. Low scores indicate that 
patients had mild problems associated with HF and high 
scores indicate a high impact of HF on QoL. Introducing the 
questionnaire to the patients was easy and questions were 
answered clearly. 
The information collected thanks to MLHFQ provided 
an overview about the physical, social and mental status of 
patients before and after the interventional process. 
K. Training programs 
Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. The 
training regimens were performed 3 times a week for 12 
weeks.  
Control: The control group included 10 patients who did 
not exercise at all and were instructed to continue their 
normal life activities during the three months of trial.  
Resistance Training: Ten patients were included in the 
RT group. The training protocol encompassed strength 
exercises that targeted the muscles of the quadriceps, the 
hamstrings and gluteus muscles of the lower extremities; 
Biceps, Triceps, Deltoid and Pectoralis of the upper 
extremities.  
A total of seven strength exercises were used to train the 
upper body and six strength exercises to train the lower 
body limbs. Each workout was composed of 3 sets and each 
set of 10 repetitions, with at least 15 seconds of rest between 
sets. The patients started training at 60% of 1RM that was 
assessed and recalculated every two weeks. All the patients 
started with 3 sets of 5 repetitions each but after the third 
session, all of them had completed the whole 3 sets with 10 
repetitions each. The total training time was 30 minutes. 
L. Statistical analysis 
All continuous variables are expressed as mean ± 
standard deviation of the mean (m ± SD). Baseline 
comparisons among the groups were performed using one 
way ANOVA-test for the normally distributed variables and 
Kruskal-Wallis test for the non-normally distributed 
variables.  
The paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were 
used to assess training induced changes (pre vs. post) within 
a particular group. The effect of intervention among the 
groups, the effect of time and the effect of group-by-time 
interactions were evaluated using repeated measures 
analysis of variance (RMANOVA).  
Friedman test was used when data was not normally 
distributed, knowing that normality was tested using 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.  
The inflation of type-I error due to multiple comparisons 
was controlled using Bonferroni rule. Statistical analyses 
were performed using SPSS software (version 20, SPSS 
Inc., Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.). 
III. 
RESULTS 
 
A total of 53 patients were assessed for eligibility and 20 
patients were recruited. After the first office meeting, 25 
patients failed to reach randomization and eight others did 
not participate for the following reasons: long distance, 
family issues and other limitations. 
 
No side effects have been recognized during the training 
period, and all patients in training groups seemed to be 
enthusiastic and interested. Compliance was monitored 
using a daily log booklet, and was excellent in the two 
groups.  
 
Drugs were taken properly by all the patients according 
to their cardiac specialist instructions (ACE- or ARB, beta 
blockers, and diuretics).  
 
Pharmacological therapy has not been changed over the 
3-month training period. At baseline, there were no 
statistically significant differences among the two groups 
(Control 
and 
RT) 
with 
respect 
to 
demographic 
characteristics, drugs, Cardiac Function, Exercise Test, 
Pulmonary Function Test, Functional capacity, Qol 
Respiratory muscle function and leg skeletal muscle 
function (Table I).

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
In this study, RT was able to bring out significant 
improvements in the skeletal muscle function, the cardiac 
function, NYHA functional class, and dyspnea as well as on 
functional capacity and QoL. Surprisingly, RT has also 
shown significant impact on respiratory muscle strength. 
Since the control group had no significant improvements in 
any of these parameters, we can confirm the effectiveness of 
the RT. 
The benefits gained in skeletal muscle function affect 
positively the overall exercise performance and are closely 
related to beneficial adaptations in the muscle structure and 
function such as an increase in type 1 fiber, decrease in 
circulatory pro-inflammatory markers and a better muscle 
oxidative capacity [8].  In addition, such an intensive RT 
might induce an increase in the motor unit recruitment and 
so will impact on root mean square (RMS) value towards an 
upward trend. 
In addition, we observed that the right quadriceps muscle 
is stronger than the left quadriceps muscle. These variations 
can be explained by the fact that maybe most of patients are 
right leg dominants. 
Besides, as known, skeletal and respiratory muscle 
changes in heart failure are associated with biochemical and 
metabolic disorders. Thus, the fact of improvement in 
respiratory muscle function in our study may be attributed to 
the beneficial effects of RT in increasing mitochondrial 
enzymes and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines [4]. 
The 
skeletal 
muscle 
hypothesis 
confirms 
that 
impairments in the skeletal muscle not only alter the skeletal 
muscle by itself, but also contribute to further deteriorations 
and worsens the symptoms [21]. In the same manner as this 
hypothesis, RT also works not only by improving the 
skeletal muscle function, but also by enhancing the overall 
exercise 
performance 
and 
QoL, 
thus 
reducing 
hospitalizations as well as mortality rates. Therefore, regular 
RT programs are very efficient in counteracting these 
negative skeletal muscle abnormalities seen in CHF. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
 
Considering our findings, we highly recommend the use 
of resistance training in CHF and IMW patients. This study 
had shown the crucial effect of RT, for it has improved the 
respiratory muscle strength. RT was safe and effective in 
improving skeletal muscle function, exercise performance, 
dyspnea and QoL in CHF patients, as well as in improving 
cardiac LVEF. Surprisingly in our study, RT improved 
respiratory muscle function in addition to improving cardiac 
left ventricular EF%. 
 
We recommend that future studies investigate the 
usefulness of the electrical activity of the muscles known as 
Electromyography (EMG) in clinical diagnosis, in heart 
failure patients, in order to monitor the progression of 
skeletal muscle activity and function. Cardiac biomarkers 
could also be assessed in order to confirm the safety and 
effectiveness of interventions. Furthermore, studies at the 
cellular level could be a plus if added to the non-invasive 
measurements we used. Finally, biopsies of skeletal muscle 
might give a clearer insight about potential skeletal muscle 
adaptations after exercise conditioning. 
 
It was not possible to assess aerobic capacity through 
measuring peak oxygen consumption (VO2max). However, 
we have used 6MWT and METs as prognostic outcomes. 
Both METs and 6MWT have been approved to be used 
instead of direct measurement of oxygen uptake [22], [23]. 
In addition, there is heterogeneity in training load, 
especially in exercise duration.
