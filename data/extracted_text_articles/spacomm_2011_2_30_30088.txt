Abstract—The low-density parity-check codes are one of the 
most promising coding schemes that allow high throughput, 
high data rate and good error correction like in the DVB-S2 
standard that was the first standard in satellite communication 
using this coding. The paper presents the concept and bases of 
low-density parity-check codes and the design strategies used. 
A simulation model of the end-to-end communication based on 
low-density parity-check coding is described. The model was 
designed by using the National instruments’ LabVIEW.  
Simulation results gained with this model show that our model 
is corresponding to the DVB-S2 standard.

 INTRODUCTION  
Low-density parity-check codes (LDPC) are error 
correction codes and a class of linear block codes that have a 
very high throughput and very good coding performance [1].  
Originally, the low-density parity-check codes were 
proposed by Robert Gallager in his thesis in 1962 [2], but 
this work received no attention because of the encoding and 
decoding complexity at that time. They were “rediscovered” 
with the appearance of turbo codes in the 90’s by MacKay 
[3]. Recently, LDPC codes are able to compete in 
performance with turbo codes and they show the advantage 
of allowing a finer adjustment of trade-off between 
performance and decoding complexity [4, 5]. They are 
suitable for any digital environment where high data rate and 
good error correction is important [6]. Furthermore, they are 
suitable for implementations that use advantage of 
parallelism and take effort of the fact that LDPC codes for 
large block length perform near the Shannon limit of a 
channel [7, 8, 9]. The DVB-S2 standard is the first standard 
using low density parity check codes as its forward error 
correction.  
A wide array of other communication application uses 
LDPC codes such as the 10 Gigabit Ethernet, the broadband 
wireless access or the deep-space communication [10, 11]. 
Adoption of LDPC codes is one of the keys to achieve lower 
transmission power and more reliable communication [11]. 
In this article, we detail a simulation model of a low-density 
parity-check channel coding system developed via use of 
National Instruments’ LabVIEW [12].  
The low-density parity-check codes and their basic 
concept are discussed in Section II. Section III describes the 
LDPC based end-to-end communication model. The 
performance and results are shown in Section IV. Section V 
concludes the article.  
II. 
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
 
Low-density parity-check codes are binary linear codes 
where a block of data is encoded into a codeword. They are 
obtained from sparse bipartite graphs [13], the so called 
Tanner graph [14] which consists of two types of nodes: of 
n variable or message nodes and of r check nodes [15]. Out 
of these graphs can be derived a linear code of block length 
n and dimension of at least n–r. Such a graph representation 
has an analogue matrix representation. The LDPC codes are 
specified with their sparse parity-check matrix H of the size 
M
×N
. Two numbers define such a matrix: ωr is the 
number of ones in every row and ωc is the number of ones in 
every column. If ωc<<N and ωr<<M then such a matrix is 
called a low-density (sparse) and is usually very large.  
 
When the check node j from the Tanner graph is 
connected to the variable node i the entry (i, j) of H is 1 with 
j є {0, ..., N-1} and i є {0, ..., M-1}. That means that the 
corresponding codeword bit takes part in the corresponding 
parity-check equation [5]. When there is no connection then 
H (i, j) = 0 [15]. 
 
A) Decoding  
 
 
The decoding algorithm named the sum-product 
algorithm (SPA) was already proposed by Gallager in 1962 
[2, 3]. There are two types of this algorithm: the hard and 
the soft decision. The hard decision decoding is mainly 
introduced for educational purpose but since the soft 
decision decoding provides better decoding results [1] it will 
be focused on. Soft-decision decoding of LDPC codes is 
based on concept of belief propagation. It is an iterative 
process where the information of the received bits is refined 
iteration by iteration [16]. First, variable node cj sends its 
message qij to the fj-check node. qij contains the amount of 
belief the message bit yi is a zero and the amount of the 
belief, Pi  that yi is a one:

B) Encoding  
 
 
The decoding algorithm does only the error correction. 
For protecting the message from noise and intersymbol 
interference the message has to be encoded. Encoding of 
message is done using the parity-check matrix H:

following equation (7). Since the low-density parity-check 
codes are mostly extended irregular repeat-accumulate 
codes (eIRA), [18] the encoding can be done via the parity-
check matrix with linear complexity by noting:

                    (8) 
where c is the codeword [17]. Equation (8) has to be solved 
for parity bits recursively [18].  
 
In many other applications, additional outer coding 
techniques 
are 
used 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
higher 
communication quality, e.g. the outer Bose-Chaudhuri-
Hocquengheim, BCH code [19] in the DVB-S2 system 
cleans up additional errors and improves the overall 
performance [7]. 
 
Broadcast applications, mainly use code (frame) length 
of 64800 [7] or 16200 [6] and variable code rates from 1/4 
up to 9/10 [16]. Individual parity-check matrixes are defined 
for each code rate [3]. Coded data blocks that come from the 
encoder are always of the same length. The number of 
message information bits is not constant and depends on the 
code rate [16, 20]. 
 
III. 
MODELING 
In this section our simulation model of end-to–end 
communication based on DVB-S2’s LDPC coding method 
was presented.  
National Instruments’ Laboratory Virtual Instrument 
Engineering Workbench LabVIEW with its Modulation 
Toolkit is used to design the end-to-end communication 
model because LabVIEW virtual instruments (VIs) can be 
built simple and combined to produce a flexible and 
powerful communication test system [21]. LabVIEW is 
based on graphical programming and in contrast to the 
sequential logic of most text-based programming languages; 
the execution of a block or graphical component dependents 
on the flow of data. More specifically, a block executes and 
the output data are sent to all other connected blocks when 
all input data are made available. 
Figure 1 presents the main block scheme of our 
communication model. Via the Bit generator, message to be 
sent is generated and sent to the LDPC code. After coding, 
message is modulated onto the carrier, filtered with the root 
raised cosine filter and sent through the AWGN (Gaussian 
white noise) channel. At the receiver’s side, the received 
message is filtered, demodulated and decoded. In order to 
measure the communication quality, the bit error rate is 
calculated and plotted on the BER versus 
0
Eb /
N  graph. 
b
E  
stands for energy per bit and 
0
N  is the noise power of 
spectral density [20].  
Before simulating the communication system, some 
optional parameters of the system may be predefined by 
simply texting them at the Front panel, a LabVIEW provided 
graphical user interface. The input parameters for the 
program are the code rate defined with the size of the parity-
check matrix (n – number of rows in the matrix, m- number 
of columns in matrix):

as well as the number of ones in one column and the 
maximal number of iterations performed by the encoder and 
decoder. The program uses this information to calculate the 
matrix H for the encoding and decoding process. The code 
rates, according to the standard are [2]: 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 
2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9 and 9/10.  
The DVB-S2 standard specifies two word lengths for the 
LDPC: 16200 or 64800 bits. Since the longer word length is 
used for sending information through channel, only the word 
length of 64800 bits will be considered in this paper.  It has 
to be denoted that the coded message, delivered from the 
encoder is always the same length, but the number of 
information bits is not constant and depends on the code rate.  
For decoding the received messages different algorithms 
may be used. In our work the Sum-product algorithm 
decodes the message. It exchanges the soft-information 
iteratively between variable and check nodes. Updating the 
nodes can be done with a canonical, two-phased scheduling: 
In the first phase all variable nodes are updated and in the 
second phase all check nodes. The processing of individual 
nodes within one phase is independent and can thus be 
parallelized. The exchanged messages are assumed to be log 
likelihood ratios (LLR). Each variable node calculates an 
update of message according to equations (1)-(5).  
Next input parameter for the program is the modulation 
parameter M for the M-PSK modulation. According to the 
standard [2], the PSK modulates the message onto the carrier 
although other modulation types, like the amplitude 
modulation may be used, too.  
For filtering the root-raised cosine filter is used. The 
default value of the roll-off factor of this filter is set to 
0 35
α = .
but may be changed to values according to [2].  
The user also defines the symbol rate for sending the 
message.  
In our version of the model, there was no use for the 
BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) encoder. BCH is not 
very good for error protection and correction itself, but it 
performs the erasure of error floor after the LDPC encoder 
encoded the message.

RESULTS 
As the result, the BER versus 
0
Eb /
N  curve is plotted in 
order to show the system performance, analyse the 
communication quality itself and the parameter influence on 
communication quality. First, the performance of LDPC 
coding is shown. The coding gain for the no coded and the 
LDPC coded message is calculated. The influence of the 
modulation parameter M is shown and the third simulation 
result is made in order to show how the code rate affects the 
communication quality.  
In Fig. 2, the BER versus 
0
Eb /
N  graph for the LDPC 
coded and no coded BPSK is shown. Since communication 
with higher modulation parameter M gained same conclusion 
as with the BPSK, this modulation type, being the simplest 
one was chosen to show system performance. Other relevant 
system parameters for the simulation are given in Table 1. 
Simulation result shows that, as expected, coding improves 
the performance of the communication system. Low-density 
parity-check coding is an error correction code that ensures 
not   only   error   protection   of  the  message  but  also error

 graph showing that by lowering the 
modulation factor M, the communication becomes accurate 
and safer. For the same noise level in system the probability 
of error during communication is lower.  
 
Figure 4 shows the influence of the code rate on the bit 
error rate. For modulating the signal onto the carrier the 
phase shift keying modulation was used with its modulation 
factor set to 
M = 2
. Filtering was done with the root raised 
cosine filter’s roll off factor set to
0 35
α = .
. The parity- 
check matrix had 5 ones in every column and its size was 
changed in order to gain different coding rates according to 
Table 2. Other parameters were as it is given in Table 1.  
 
Simulation shows that by lowering the code rate, 
communication becomes much safer. As the code rate 
reduces, more parity bits are used to protect one single bit. 
Therefore, a lower code rate ensures better communication 
quality but provides lower bit rate. With a lower code rate 
more bits have to be sent for transmitting the same message 
then with a higher value of the code rate and this takes more 
time. The lowest bit error rate, with a constant level of noise 
in system is achieved with code rate set to
1 2
R = /
. The code 
rate is defined by the size of the parity-check matrix.

V. 
CONCLUSION  
In this paper, after a basic theoretical background on low-
density parity-check codes, our end-to-end simulation model 
based on DVB-S2’s LDPC coding is presented. For 
modeling the National Instruments’ LabVIEW and its 
Modulation Toolkit were used. Encoding is based on 
forming the parity-check matrix. At the receiver’s side, 
decoding is done. Decoding of received message is done via 
the sum-product algorithm and soft decision decoding.  
Simulations were made and the influences of different 
parameters were tested. Results show that low-density parity-
check codes improve the communication quality. Lowering 
the modulation factor M gained a lower bit error rate in 
system, as well as reducing the code rate. Since, with lower 
code rate more bits have to be sent for transmitting the same 
message the transmitting takes a higher bit rate.  
In future work, the model will be augmented with an 
outer BCH encoder in order to improve the existing model 
and move it closer to the DVB-S2 standard.
