Abstract— Secondary spectrum access is a promising approach 
to improve spectrum utilization by enabling new wireless 
systems to opportunistically use and efficiently share the 
licensed bands. This paper targets a WiFi-like reuse of 
available spectrum in the TV bands and proposes a novel 
cooperative centralized spectrum sharing scheme that enables 
protection for the primary users and provides efficient usage of 
the available spectrum for multiple coexisting secondary users. 
The proposed scheme relies on a Non-Linear Integer 
Programming (NLIP) optimization method to maximize the 
average SIR per secondary user. Furthermore, the sharing 
scheme introduces interference protection zones for primary 
users' protection from excessive interference. The simulation 
results show performance enhancements in terms of average 
throughput increase for the secondary users. Finally, the paper 
investigates the relations between secondary channels widths 
and the number of secondary users under strict interference 
constraints for primary users' protection. In this respect, the 
smaller step sizes for the channel widths lead to higher SIR 
increase regardless of the number of users.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The need for anytime-anywhere wireless service access 
leads to a number of user wireless devices requiring 
dedicated spectrum resources. Therefore, efficient spectrum 
utilization is of great interest today. It fosters discovering of 
spectrum 
opportunities 
that 
enable 
new 
emerging 
technologies and services and also yields utilization of the 
licensed 
frequency 
bands 
with 
increased 
spectrum 
efficiency. 
The Cognitive Radio (CR) represents a key enabling 
technology for secondary spectrum usage [1]. It facilitates 
the  unlicensed Secondary Users (SUs) to opportunistically 
access available spectrum that is currently not used by the 
legacy Primary Users (PUs) owning a license to operate in 
the  particular spectrum band. Two main functionalities 
characterizing the CR concept are spectrum sensing and 
spectrum sharing. Spectrum sensing is a method used to 
determine whether a certain portion of the spectrum is 
available for a possible set of secondary transmissions. 
Spectrum sharing refers to techniques enabling multiple 
SUs to access and to coexist in the available vacant 
spectrum.  
The spectrum sharing schemes can be classified 
according to different criteria (e.g., based on the network 
architecture, based on the possible mutual cooperation 
among the SUs, based on the access technology, based on 
the method used for spectrum availability retrieval etc). The 
classification according to the spectrum availability retrieval 
criterion results in sensing based, database based and mixed 
approaches. In the sensing based approach, the SUs use 
only the CR functionality of spectrum sensing in order to 
determine whether there is an available spectrum for 
possible secondary transmissions. Database based spectrum 
availability retrieval is more suitable for static and 
predictable in time and space primary systems (e.g., TV 
networks). This approach is preferred in practical 
implementations yielding a centralized topology where the 
central entity hosts the database providing information on 
spectrum availability (e.g., FCC ruling on database based 
sensing [2], other sharing approaches [3] etc.). Therefore, 
the newly proposed scheme in this paper relies on the 
database based approach to spectrum sharing.  
One of the most promising scenarios for secondary 
spectrum access is the usage of TV white spaces for WiFi-
like secondary transmissions. The term white spaces is used 
by the FCC [4] to denote available spectrum at Very High 
Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) TV 
bands. These bands provide better propagation possibilities 
in terms of transmitting range, shadowing etc., but pose 
additional technical challenges and limitations such as risks 
of generating excessive interference due to multiple 
secondary transmissions, establishment of control channel 
for SUs signaling etc. [5]. The use of these bands for WiFi-
like 
systems 
enables 
higher 
coverage 
and 
higher 
transmission rates. Excessive knowledge on TV bands 
spectrum availability will be also available in terms of 
Radio Environmental Maps (REMs) and databases [6]. 
However, the lack of awareness and cooperation between 
the secondary systems in future WiFi-like scenarios can 
cause significant degradation of the primary and coexisting 
secondary systems due to interference. Hence, intelligent 
sharing schemes among secondary systems can provide

protection for the primaries while at the same time 
guarantee an efficient usage of the available spectrum. 
This paper proposes a novel centralized spectrum 
sharing scheme using a NLIP-based optimization in order to 
enable efficient spectrum resources utilization for WiFi-like 
devices accesssing TV white spaces. Moreover, the scheme 
introduces strict interference constraints for PUs' protection 
and allows for maximization of the SUs’ achievable 
throughput. The sharing scheme envisiones granular channel 
widths and dynamic central frequencies for the SUs. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an 
overview of the related work in the field. Section III 
describes the targeted scenario and gives insight into the 
proposed spectrum sharing scheme. Sections IV and V give 
the analytical background and the performance evaluation of 
the spectrum sharing scheme, respectively. Finally, Section 
VI concludes the paper and pinpoints future research 
directions.

RELATED WORK 
A number of organizations and research groups work 
today on developing protocols or applications that would 
enable efficient reuse of TV white spaces by secondary 
WiFi-like devices. From a spectrum sharing perspective, the 
work mostly refers to more efficient resource management 
that improves spectrum utilization, ensuring interference 
protection.     
The 802.11 task group is developing 802.11af standard 
also called White-Fi, which will be used in the unlicensed 
TV white spaces [7].  
The authors in [8] propose a framework for decentralized 
control and management solutions in dense Wireless Local 
Area Network (WLAN) environments using multi agent 
systems. The impact of both inter-WLAN and co-channel 
Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) interference is 
considered. The method emphasizes the predictability of the 
time-varying network states using predictive models while 
incorporating the impact of interference into the sharing 
scheme. The decentralized scheme is compared with a 
centralized approach that uses a similar concept as the one 
being a subject of interest in this paper. Reference [9] 
elaborates similar approach for managing channels in 
WLAN scenarios. The developed solution uses a distributed 
algorithm for assigning non-overlapping channels and 
managing fixed and roaming users in the network. A NLIP 
optimization method is used for interference minimization. 
The proposed algorithm is used to maximize the channel 
efficiency and network throughput in indoor dense WLAN 
scenarios. Ref. [10] proposes Radio Resource Broker (RRB) 
architecture for fair resources allocation among providers. 
The algorithm limits the number of available channels and 
implements load balancing. The simulation results show the 
effectiveness of the method for dynamic radio resources 
redistribution. While all these papers refer to resource 
management in pure dense WLAN scenarios, reference [11] 
concentrates on PU protection in networks with opportunistic 
secondary access. It proposes a planning tool and channel 
assignment mechanism for cellular OFDMA networks that 
takes into account the primary system requirements. The 
concept introduces cell division into interference zones that 
will limit the secondary transmissions.  
Unlike previous work, this paper proposes a spectrum 
sharing scheme that uses a NLIP optimization for efficient 
resources management among SUs. The sharing scheme is 
envisioned for centralized database based secondary WiFi-
like in TV white spaces system. It introduces strict constrains 
for the SUs in order to enable PUs interference protection for 
the specified scenario. Moreover, the sharing scheme 
proposes flexible channels widths and adaptable central 
frequencies for SUs transmissions. 
III. 
NOVEL SPECTRUM SHARING SCHEME 
This section elaborates the targeted scenario (i.e. WiFi-
like usage of TV white spaces) and proposes a novel 
spectrum sharing scheme. It tries to closely resemble a future 
realistic scenario.  
A. Envisioned scenario 
The scenario envisions WiFi-like secondary systems 
opportunistically accessing TV white spaces. Its essential 
components are (Figure 1): 
 
TV broadcast network as a primary system and 
 
WiFi-like system as a secondary network. 
The secondary WiFi-like system components comprise: 
 
WiFi-like Access Points referred as Secondary APs 
(SAPs); 
 
End WiFi-like users (each connected to only one 
SAP) referred as Secondary Users (SUs); 
 
Central Network Controller (CNC) that controls all 
SAPs and conducts the resources optimization and  
 
Database (possible REMs [6]), collocated with the 
CNC, 
that 
stores 
information 
on 
spectrum 
opportunities (TV white spaces). 
The scenario envisions that multiple SAPs coexist in a 
small geographic area, e.g., as office buildings, a city 
downtown area or a university campus (Figure 1). The SAPs 
can be placed randomly as in traditional WiFi systems. The 
present observed scenario does not concern users’ mobility.

B. Novel spectrum sharing scheme 
This subsection proposes a novel, database based, 
spectrum 
sharing 
scheme 
for 
WiFi-like 
devices 
opportunistically accessing the TV white spaces. The main 
objective is to maximize the SIR at an SU level and allocate 
an appropriate portion of the vacant spectrum to different 
SAPs. This would result in SUs throughput increase.  
The scheme’s operation is depicted on Figure 2. All 
SAPs communicate periodically with the CNC transferring 
parameters such as SAP Identification Number (ID), number 
of SUs associated to the specific SAP and location. Each 
SAP is envisioned to be equipped with a geo-location device 
in order to report its location to the CNC. After the SAP is 
associated with the CNC, it retrieves information from the 
database about spectrum opportunities in terms of available 
UHF channels (white spaces) in its vicinity. The SAPs 
receive information on Signal to Interference (SIR) at every 
user, communicating with the SUs. The SIR per SU data is 
resent to the CNC in order to be taken in the optimization 
calculations. The CNC calculates the optimal resources 
allocation and applies control decisions to the SAPs based on 
the received information, environmental parameters and 
predefined limitations. All SAPs retransmit this information 
to the connected SUs in order to adjust their communication 
parameters to the redistributed resources. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Message sequence chart for the proposed scenario 
 
The newly proposed spectrum sharing scheme in this 
paper introduces a PU protection zone in terms of multiple 
SAPs' transmitting range overlapping limit. The overlapping 
limit represents a newly introduced mechanism ensuring 
interference protection for a possible primary receiver 
located in this PU protection zone. Namely, the uncontrolled 
random deployment of different SAPs would inevitably lead 
to overlap of multiple SAPs transmitting ranges. This often 
results in excessive interference for the PUs in the 
overlapping areas. Regarding this limitation, the best case 
scenario would be when every two SAPs have non-
overlapping PU protection zones, thus the channel 
assignment can be any set of overlapping channels. 
The following section provides the necessary analytical 
background of the algorithm used for resources optimization 
in the proposed spectrum sharing scheme. 
IV. 
ANALYTICAL BACKGROUND 
The objective of the proposed sharing scheme is to 
maximize the SIR at the SU level, which reflects in 
maximization of the throughput per user. The actual 
optimization is carried out in the CNC. The CNC uses the 
available information on SIR per SU for calculating the 
optimal channel allocation pattern.  
The targeted scenario considers a set of M SUs and a set 
of N SAPs to be served by the SAPs. The SAPs and the SUs 
are randomly distributed in a certain area. Each user is 
assigned to a single SAP. The power received by every user 
is evaluated using the free space path loss model (used in 
WiFi-like secondary systems models [12]), i.e.

where dij is the distance between SUi and SAPj and λ is the 
signal wavelength.  
The sharing scheme represents a channel assignment 
problem formulated as a NLIP [13] optimization. The 
complexity of solving the problem increases with the 
increase of number of entities in the simulation. Each SAP 
and SU is enabled to use different central frequencies and 
flexible channel widths (channels granularity). The available 
spectrum opportunity can be divided into chunks of up to 2 
MHz subchannels. The SUs are envisioned to be able to 
adapt their central frequency and channel width to a multiple 
of 2 MHz subchannels located in the UHF band.  
The sharing scheme permits a channel bandwidth overlap 
for non-overlapping PU protection areas, while it dedicates 
non-overlapping channels to overlapping SAPs’ PU 
protection zones (see Figure 3). This limitation protects the 
PUs from interference produced from multiple SUs 
transmissions. In order to quantify this rule, a parameter sjk is 
defined as:

or 1).

where fcj is the central frequency of the channel assigned to 
SAPj, fck is the central frequency of the channel assigned to 
SAPk and m is the narrower channel width for the two 
channels, expressed in MHz. One example is the case when 
two SAPs, SAPj and SAPk use overlapping channels, where

SAPj utilizes three UHF channels from 694 Mhz to 718 MHz 
and SAPk utilizes the three UHF channels from 702 MHz to 
726 MHz. In this case, αjk = max(0, 1-|706-714|x1/24) = 2/3. 
It should be noted that if the channels overlap, then fcj – fck 
=0, whereas if the channels do not overlap, then αjk = 0. The 
scheme enables SAPs to be assigned with minimum 
overlapping channels. 
The optimization problem in the sharing scheme targets 
maximization of the SIR per SU, i.e. minimization of the 
interference from other SAPs (downlink transmissions) at a 
user level. The induced constraints due to interference in 
overlapping areas to the primary system are applied as:

1) SIR maximization analysis: Table II shows the 
parameters' behavior from the analyzed simulation scenario 
at the initial phase (no sharing scheme implemented) and 
after the implementation of the sharing scheme. The 
parameters of interest comprise an initial random number of 
users connected to a specific SAP. The channel width 
dedicated to every SAP suits the number of SUs that it 
serves at that specific moment. The table clearly depicts the 
central transmitting frequencies for every SAP in the initial 
and in the end phase after implementing the sharing scheme 
and completing the simulation. It is evident that SAPs 2 and 
4 changed their central frequencies in order to achieve 
maximum average SIR per SU in the whole system.

The purpose is to compare the effect of channel 
assignment at the initial design stage, and later stage when 
the optimization algorithm is applied.     
Figure 4 depicts the average SIR in the initial channel 
allocation phase and the increase in average SIR per user 
after implementing the sharing scheme. It is evident that the 
implementation of the sharing scheme improves the average 
SIR by 29.7% in this specific configuration as shown on

As previously explained, the channel bandwidths per 
SAP are allocated in accordance with the relative number of 
users per SAP. Figure 5 depicts the achieved average SIRs 
in the initial phase and after implementing the sharing 
scheme, depending on flexibility of the channels bandwidth. 
Although the maximum average SIR is achieved with step 
of 4 MHz for the channels granularity, the highest 
percentage improvement in maximizing the average SIR is 
reached with a granularity of 2 MHz (i.e. 9 possible channel 
bandwidths). As a result, the flexible channel bandwidth can 
also improve the maximal throughput per SAP, where the 
flexibility is customized according to the number of SUs per 
SAP. However, the channel width step size can be limited 
by the devices’ hardware characteristics in practical 
implementations.

The average throughput per SU can be calculated using 
the IEEE 802.11a standard [16] specifications. The 
throughput per user is calculated based on the received 
power from the corresponding SAP. The roughly calculated 
physical level mapping between the SINR and throughput is 
presented in Table 3.

Figure 7 shows the variance of the average throughput

increase is greater due to granular throughput dedication 
mechanisms used in IEEE 802.11 standard.

optimization depends upon the number of SAPs and SUs in 
the system. Though it is hardware dependent, the figure 
clearly shows how greater number of secondary entities

processing time in the CNC.

The proposed and analyzed sharing scheme establishes 
an efficient way for secondary WiFi-like use of the TV white 
spaces that leads to evident system performance increase and 
efficient PU protection. Moreover, the elaborated idea for the 
sharing scheme sets the basis and opens further possibilities 
for additional investigation and analyses. 
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The use of TV white spaces is expected to become one of 
the key drivers in the development of the secondary systems 
fostering new wireless applications and driving novel 
technical solutions. Different scenarios and possible 
implementation examples are scrutinized in the academia 
and industry. The WiFi-like secondary systems deployment 
in TV white spaces is currently the most interesting scenario 
because of the TV digital switchover.  
The spectrum sharing scheme proposed in this paper 
targets the WiFi-like usage of TV white space scenario and 
provides the improvement of the average SIR leading to a 
higher throughput per SU. The optimization method 
combines the channel widths and central frequencies at the 
SUs while enabling interference protection for the PUs from 
multiple transmitting SAPs through usage of interference 
protection zones. The sharing scheme proposes granular 
adjusting channel widths and central frequencies increasing 
SUs’ performance (i.e. achieve a higher SIR per SU). Higher 
performances are experienced with smaller steps of the 
channel widths. The scheme’s performance is independent of 
the number of active SUs in the system.  
Real implementations with large network topologies 
would result in longer computations necessitating powerful 
high speed processing servers to be used as CNCs. 
Additionally, more realistic scenarios would require that the 
sharing scheme is performed dynamically and repetitively on 
a precisely estimated time periods in order to prevent 
performance decrease due to the system changes in time 
varying networks.  
Future work will include adoption of a more complex 
propagation model, investigation of cooperation techniques 
among the SUs, Common Control Channel (CCC) signaling 
overhead 
analysis, 
performance 
evaluation 
through 
introducing several different secondary systems/technologies 
etc.
