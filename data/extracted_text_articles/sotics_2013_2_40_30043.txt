Abstract—Facebook applications are one of the reasons for
Facebook attractiveness. Unfortunately, numerous users are not
aware of the fact that many malicious Facebook applications
exist. To educate users, to raise users’ awareness and to improve
Facebook users’ security and privacy, we developed a Firefox
add-on that alerts users to the number of installed applications
on their Facebook proﬁles. In this study, we present the temporal
analysis of the Facebook applications’ installation and removal
dataset collected by our add-on. This dataset consists of informa-
tion from 2,945 users, collected during a period of over a year.
We used linear regression to analyze our dataset and discovered
the linear connection between the average percentage change of
newly installed Facebook applications and the number of days
passed since the user initially installed our add-on. Additionally,
we found out that users who used our Firefox add-on become
more aware of their security and privacy installing on average
fewer new applications. Finally, we discovered that on average
86.4% of Facebook users install an additional application every
4.2 days.

I. INTRODUCTION
In the last decade, online social networks have gained
enormous popularity. Over a billion users worldwide are using
these networks [18] to share information, communicate with
friends, play games, etc. [6]. Recently, J.B. Duggan [12]
discovered that 67% of adults in the United States use online
social networks. These results demonstrate a 2% increase in
comparison to a previous report [20]. The exponential growth
of social networks created a reality where there are social
networks for almost every usage. These vary from social net-
works for connecting with business colleagues like LinkedIn
[7] and Xing [9] to social networks for animal lovers, such
as Dogster [2], Catster [1] and YummyPets [10]. The biggest
online social network is Facebook, [3] which has more than
1.11 billion monthly active users as of March 2013 [6]. The
median Facebook user is 22 years old [8], and has 138 friends
on average [6]. Facebook users have made 140.3 billion friend
connections and used over 1.13 trillion likes [8]. Moreover,
every 60 seconds Facebook users post 510,000 comments,
update 293,000 statuses, and upload 136,000 photos [22].
One of the main reasons for Facebook popularity is its third-
party applications [26]. The Facebook application platform
popularity is growing rapidly; for example, more than 20
million Facebook applications are installed every day [24].
There are many different kinds of Facebook applications, such
as utility, productivity, and even educational applications [5].
According to Nazir et al. [21], the most popular applications
are games; approximately 230 million people play games on
Facebook every month [13]. The most popular games such as
“Candy Crush Saga” have more than 2.7 million daily active
users [19].
In recent years, hackers and spammers have found Facebook
applications to be an efﬁcient platform for spreading malware
and spam. Moreover, recent research has found that at least
13% of applications on Facebook are malicious [26]. Recently,
Rahman et al. [26] described in their study that spammers
use Facebook applications to lure their victims into clicking
on speciﬁc malicious links. Additionally, hackers can take
advantage of Facebook application platform properties to: (a)
ﬁnd their next potential targets across a large base of potential
users [26], (b) use the trust between friends to infect more
users [23], (c) exploit the application developers API [4] to
collect information, such as personal information, photos, tags,
posts, chat threads, etc., and (d) use the user’s credentials
to publish posts or to spread spam, advertising and phishing
under the name of a legitimate user [17].
To deal with this problem, we developed an add-on that
is part of the Social Privacy Protector (SPP) [15], [16]. The
purpose of this add-on is to educate and to increase user
awareness about the threat that lurks in social applications. Our
add-on notiﬁes users of their current number of applications.
By notifying the users, we encourage removal of third-party
applications that are not in use by the user.
In this study, we utilize a dataset that was collected by our
dedicated Firefox add-on. It contains information about 44,541
different occasions collected from 2,945 users between May
2012 and June 2013. Each entry in our dataset consists of the
user id, application number and date.
In our previous study [16], we presented preliminary statis-
tics on this dataset. We analyzed this dataset and discovered
that users who used the SPP add-on for application removal,
removed more than 50% of all their installed applications one
day after its installation. These results indicate that in many
cases the installed applications are unwanted or unneeded
applications. In this study, we perform a temporal analysis of
the installed application data that was collected for a longer
period of time red than in our previous study. We discovered
that within the ﬁrst week after the add-on’s initial use, the
user’s number of applications decreased by 12.1% (see Table I)
on average. Moreover, the application removal rate continued
to grow up to 27.7% (see Table I) by an average of 63 days
after the initial use. According to the results presented in this
study, we can conclude that using our add-on made many
users become more aware of the existence of unnecessary
applications on their Facebook proﬁles.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section II, we give a brief overview on different related
solutions that help users in social networks protect themselves
from malicious applications. In Section III, we describe our
methodology for analyzing the information and how we used
linear regression to predict the application number. In Section
IV, we present our study’s initial results. Finally, in Section V,
we present our conclusions regarding the change in awareness
that resulted from our add-on notiﬁcations and offer future
research directions.
II. RELATED WORK
Recent reports [27], [28] have indicated that due to the
growth of social network popularity, there also has been a
massive rise in malicious activity and security threats to online
social network users. In recent years, social network users,
social network operators, security companies, and academic
researchers have proposed solutions to increase the security
and privacy of social networks users. In the remainder of this
section, we describe notable solutions in the area.
A. Detecting Malicious Applications
Detection is the most standard way to deal with security
and privacy problems. There are many works on this topic and
many different ways to detect malware. For example, Rahman
et al. [25] presented MyPageKeeper, a Facebook application
that protects Facebook users from socware. MyPageKeeper
is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer that
uses a main feature speciﬁc keyword occurrence in a post
made by an application. MyPageKeeper was able to identify
socware posts and alert the user with 97% accuracy, but was
unable to detect malicious applications. Websense Defensio
[11] is a Facebook application from Websense that monitors
posts in a user’s proﬁle and determines whether they are
legitimate, spam, or malicious. Defensio also uses SVM to
detect malicious posts and in addition they could delete them.
Abu-Nimeh et al. [11] used Defensio as a platform to study
malicious links. They found that about 9% of the studied
posts were spam or malicious. In 2012, Rahman, et al. [26]
improved his previously mentioned work. Rahman, et al.
developed the FRAppE: A tool that can identify malicious
applications by using the application information as features.
Some examples include the number of permissions required,
the domain reputation of redirect URI, and others. FRAppE
can detect malicious applications with 99.5% accuracy and a
low false negative rate 4.1%.
B. Increasing User Awareness of the Threat
Another approach is informing the user about possible
threats that can jeopardize his or her security and privacy.
By using this approach, it is possible to stimulate users to
react and to protect themselves. This tactic is about teaching
users what kind of threats exist and how they should protect
themselves.
In 2012, Xu et al. [29] chose to redesign the Facebook
application authentication dialogue to increase user awareness
of the permissions that are required by applications. Recently,
Fire et al. [15] presented the SPP software, a Firefox add-on
and a Facebook application. This software contains three pro-
tection layers, which improve user privacy by implementing
different methods. (1) The friends layer - suggests friends who
might pose a threat and then restricts these friends’ exposure
to the user’s personal information. (2) The privacy settings
layer
is based upon different types of social network usage
proﬁles. (3) The application layer - alerts users to the number
of installed applications on their Facebook proﬁles.
In our previous study [16], we presented initial results,
which were based on a dataset from 1,676 users collected
between the 27th of June, 2012, and the 10th of November,
2012. In this study, we perform a temporal analysis on our
complete dataset, which contains information from 2,945 users
between May 2012 and June 2013. Unlike our previous study,
this is the ﬁrst study where we focused on analyzing user
application installation and removal from different aspects for
long periods of time.
III. METHODS AND EXPERIMENTS
Our study’s main goal is to study how awareness affects
installation and removal of social applications. To perform
our research, we collected data from the Facebook online
social network by using the SPP Firefox add-on (see Figure 1),
which collected the following information: (1) Hashed User
Id, (2) Installed Application Number - the number of installed
Facebook applications on the user’s Facebook account, and (3)
Date - the date when the information was collected. To avoid
duplicate entries, we collected only one entry for each user
per day. Our ﬁnal collected dataset included 2,947 Facebook
users with unique hashed user ids across 351 different days
between the months of May 2012 and June 2013. On average,
we obtained information of 63 days and 15.1 entries per user.
In addition, we discovered that Facebook users have a mean
of 41.86 applications.
Fig. 1: Warning about installed applications.
To perform temporal analysis of our dataset we carried
out the following steps. First of all, we divided all the users
into two groups as follows: (1) Regular Users - users whose
number of installed Facebook applications did not decrease
between the initial and last use of the add-on (2) Add-on Users
- users who decreased the number of installed Facebook ap-
plication between their initial and last use of the add-on. Next,
for each user, we calculated AppChangeRatio(u, d): the ratio
between the change in the number of applications user, u, had
after, d, days and the number of applications that, u, had when
the add-on was initially installed. AppChangeRatio(u, d)
was calculated only for the ﬁrst 63 days after the add-on
was initially installed, where 63 days is the average add-on
use period. The formal deﬁnition of the AppChangeRatio
35

function is as follows:
AppChangeRatio(u, d) := ACR(u, d) :=
AppNum(u, 0)-AppNum(u, d)
AppNum(u, 0)
(1)
Where AppNum(u, d) is a function that returns the number
of applications user, u, had at a day, d, after the add-on
installation. Then, for each day, d, we calculated the average
ACR(u, d) for each group as follows:
AvgAppChange(u, d) := AvgAC(u, d) :=
P
u∈Users ACR(u, d)
|Users|
(2)
We performed t-test to reject the null hypothesis, which states
that the mean number of applications of the Regular Users
and the Addon Users is identical and the observed differences
are merely random. To ﬁnd correlation between the application
number and time, we conducted a linear regression experiment
for each of the groups. The independent variable is the number
of days passed since the initial install. The dependent variable
is the percentage change in the applications number since the
initial install.
Lastly, we tested if there are speciﬁc days of the week
when users install or remove more applications as opposed
to other days. To test this we calculated the average change in
application number for every day of the week, w, for all the
users, u. The change in application number is the calculation
of difference in the number of applications between sequel
days, we deﬁned AppNumDelta as:
AppNumDelta(u, d) := ANDelta(u, d) :=
AppNum(u, d) − AppNum(u, d + 1)
(3)
The results were divided into two cases:
I(w) =
P
{wday(d)=w|ANDelta(u,d)>0} ANDelta(u, d)
|{u ∈ Users|wday(d) = w ∧ ANDelta(u, d) > 0}|
(4)
R(w) =
P
{wday(d)=w|ANDelta(u,d)≤0} ANDelta(u, d)
|{u ∈ Users|wday(d) = w ∧ ANDelta(u, d) ≤ 0}|
(5)
where wday(d) returns the day of the week for d. I(w) is
the average number of applications installed on that day of
the week, w, and R(w) is the average number of applications
removed on that day of the week, w.
IV. RESULTS
At the end of our analysis, our Regular Users group
consisted of 2,545 users and the Add-on Users group consisted
of 400 users, out of which 52 (13%) also used our Friends
Analyzer application, which is responsible for identifying a
user’s friends, who may pose a threat to the user’s privacy.
Therefore, we can classify these 52 users as privacy concerned
users. Further, this suggests that less than 2% of all Facebook
users are highly aware of their privacy.

0.12) and the Regular Users
(µ = −0.19, σdev = 0.05) have a signiﬁcant difference in
their mean values t = 25.936, p − value < 2.2e − 16. Next,
we used the linear regression method to ﬁnd the correlation
between the change ratio in number of applications and
period of time in days.
Fig. 2: The ratio between the percentage change in the applications
number and days passed for the Regular Users. The solid line
equation - ApplicationChangePercent = 0.006Days + 0.05
As a result of the difference we have shown between the
two groups, we divided the linear regression into two cases: (1)
Regular Users - users whose number of applications increased
or did not change (see Figure 2), (2) Add-on Users - Users
whose number of applications decreased (see Figure 3).
Fig. 3: The ratio between the percentage change in the number of
applications and days passed of the Add-on Users. The solid line
equation - ApplicationChangePercent = −0.002Days − 0.125
Using linear regression, we received the following regres-

sion equations (see Figure 2 and 3):
RegularUsers : ApplicationChangePercent =
0.006Days + 0.05
(6)
where R2 = 0.736, and p − value = 2.2e − 16.
AddonUsers : ApplicationChangePercent =
− 0.002Days − 0.125
(7)
where R2 = 0.57, and p − value = 1.351e − 12
According to the linear regression results, the average Face-
book user application number increases linearly over time, and
the user installs about 7.15 applications each month.
Fig. 4: Average application install and removal per day of the week.
In addition, we tested if there is a speciﬁc day of the week
when users install or remove more applications than normal.
We discovered that for both cases there is more activity on
Saturdays and a signiﬁcantly lower removal rate on Thursdays
(see Figure 4).
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we presented our initial methods and results
in studying online social network applications with an aim
of improving users safety and awareness. According to our
results, it is possible to predict the number of applications a
casual user has with high accuracy. Moreover, we discovered
that users install many applications every month, and the aver-
age user installs approximately 7.15 applications each month.
Currently, there are several malicious applications available.
Rahman et al. states [26] that at least 13% of Facebook
applications are malicious. By joining these two statistics
together, we shockingly conclude that on average a Facebook
user installs more than ten malicious applications each year.
Our results show a possible solution to this problem. After the
installation of our add-on, users become more aware of the
number of installed applications they had. Users removed on
average 12.1% of their applications after the ﬁrst week, and
they continued to remove even more applications afterward.
Furthermore, by using the equations we discovered, it is
possible to classify users who are not aware of the number
of applications they have.
In addition, we discovered that users install and remove
more applications on Saturdays. We assume this is due to
many users being at home instead of working on this day of
the week. It is possible to use these results to notify users more
often, in ways that are more noticeable and on speciﬁc dates
regarding the danger of installing applications. For example,
we can conﬁgure our add-on to give more alerts and add
special alerts on Saturday.
The study presented in this paper is a work in progress
with many available future directions. By gathering additional
information about what kind of applications users tend to
restrict, we can develop an algorithm for application removal
recommendations. Moreover, when the same applications are
restricted by many users, we can conclude with high likelihood
that these applications are fake applications and recommend
to Facebook and our users to remove these applications from
the social network and their accounts. Another possible future
direction is discovering the point in time when the Add-on
Users’ application numbers start increasing again, and at that
point, to give the user a special warning regarding his or her
number of applications.
