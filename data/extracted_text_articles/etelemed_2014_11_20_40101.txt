Abstract— This study aims to demonstrate that telecare (e-
Health) is one essential measure for coping with increases in 
medical expenditure related to chronic diseases such as heart 
failure, high blood pressure, diabetics, and stroke. To do so, the 
long-term effects of telecare use by residents of Nishi-aizu Town, 
Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, between 2002 and 2010 is 
examined by comparing medical expenditure and days of 
treatment between telecare users (treatment group) and non-
users (control group) based on receipt data obtained from the 
National Health Insurance. Our previous studies used receipt 
data obtained for the years 2002 to 2006. This study expands the 
period of analysis for four more years with respect to 
respondents who were included in previous analyses. 90 users 
and 118 non-users were included in both analyses. Using rigorous 
statistical methods, including system Generalized Method of 
Moments (GMM), which deals with the endogeneity problem, 
this paper demonstrates that telecare users require fewer days of 
treatment and smaller medical expenditures than non-users with 
respect to chronic diseases, even in the long run. To date, there 
have been no studies examining the long-term economic effects of 
telemedicine use, and thus the current study presents a new facet 
of research in this field. In particular, the economic foundation 
for the sustainability of the telecare (e-Health) project will be 
supported by this study.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Increasing medical costs and shortages of medical doctors 
in rural areas are issues that urgently need to be addressed in 
healthcare around the world. Medical expenditure in Japan has 
been steadily increasing, and in FY2012 amounted to JPY35.1 
trillion (US$4,387 billion) with more than half (51.7%) of that 
being spent on the care of patients over the age of 65. In 2012, 
24.2% of the Japanese population was over the age of 65, and 
this is expected to increase in the near future. Furthermore, the 
number of outpatient days in Japan is the largest among the 
OECD member countries at 13.4 days per person per year, 
compared with 4.0 (US), 5.9 (UK), 7.8 (Germany), and 6.9 
(France) days per person per year (OECD Health Data). It is 
imperative to reduce the number of treatment days as well as 
overall medical expenditure in Japan. To cope with the serious 
healthcare situation in Japan, local governments have begun to 
implement telecare, or e-Health, which allows the local 
government to remotely monitor the health of elderly residents 
at home by transmitting health-related data, such as blood 
pressure, blood oxygen level, and ECG, to medical institutions 
via telecommunications networks. Telecare is thus expected to 
improve users’ health, as our previous studies[1][2][3][4] 
demonstrated. 
The present study selected Nishi-aizu Town as the project 
site. This town, located in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, has 
nearly 20 years experience with telecare. The objective of the 
paper is to demonstrate that telecare use reduces not only 
medical expenditures but also days of treatment of patients 
with chronic diseases such as stroke, hypertension, heart failure, 
and diabetes, even over the long-term period of nine years. In 
addition, a rigorous statistical method, system Generalized 
Method of Moments (GMM), is used to statistically assess the 
causal relationship through which telecare use actually reduces 
medical expenditure and days of treatment. This relationship is 
not “seemingly correlated”[3][5][6]. In order to carry this out, 
field research was conducted in March 2012 to obtain two 
basic data for the statistical analysis; receipt data for 272 
telecare users (treatment group) and 247 non-users (control 
group) for the period 2007 to 2010, and their responses to a 
questionnaire. This data included individuals who were 
included in our previous studies in the period 2002 to 2006, 
and thus data for 90 telecare users and 118 non-users for the 
whole period 2002 to 2010 were used in this study. 
Another objective of this paper is to focus on medical 
expenditure and days of treatment of patients with particular 
chronic diseases such as stroke, hypertension, heart failure, 
and diabetes, since the increase in the number of chronic 
diseases is one of the major reasons for medical expenditure 
rises worldwide. Although the previous paper[7] compared 
these two outcomes for general users and nonusers for five-
and nine-year data, this paper examines whether the same 
results hold particularly for patients with chronic diseases. The 
rationale for this research question is that the increase in 
medical expenditures is a common global issue and it is 
generally understood that the increase in chronic diseases is 
the major cause. Moreover, it is well known that chronic 
diseases can be prevented by lifestyle changes, for example. In 
this context, this study can provide one solution to these issues.

Another objective of this study is to compare the results 
from the same telecare project in Nishi-aizu obtained by our 
previous studies[1][2][3][4]. These studies cover the data for   
199 telecare users (treatment) and 209 non-users (control) in 
the period 2002-2006. The results of this five-year period are 
summarized as follows: (i) telecare users had lower medical 
expenditures for chronic diseases than non-users; (ii) the 
longer the subjects used telecare, the lower the medical 
expenditures  became; (iii) the longer the subjects used 
telecare, the larger the elasticity of the reduction of medical 
expenditures became; that is, the more years users utilized 
telecare, the greater the decrease in medical became for each 
additional year of use compared with those whose years of use 
were fewer; and (iv) the effect of the reduction of medical 
expenditures due to telecare is higher, especially for telecare 
users with chronic diseases.  
The same hypotheses are applicable to treatment days. This 
paper thus compares the results for the five-year and nine-year 
research. This paper consists of the following sections. Section 
II describes the usage of the telecare system in Nishi-aizu, 
Section III outlines the materials and methods of the paper, 
Section IV indicates the results of the estimations, and in 
Section V we state our conclusions. 
II. 
TELECARE USAGE IN NISHI-AIZU 
Here we describe the background and history of the 
telecare system in Nishi-aizu. 
A. Healthcare in Nishi-aizu 
Nishi-aizu is located in the northwest corner of Fukushima 
Prefecture, Japan, and is an important point of transit to and 
from Niigata Prefecture and the nearby major city of Aizu-
wakamatsu. The town is surrounded by mountains, which 
cover 86% of the prefecture, and the town center is located in a 
geographical basin. There are approximately 10,000 residents 
in 3,000 households, and in 2001, 35.9% of the population was 
over the age of 65. The town’s main industry is agriculture, and 
rice is the main product. The climate is characterized by very 
high temperatures in summer and very low temperatures with 
heavy snow in winter. The severe winter conditions deprive the 
elderly residents of opportunities for sufficient physical 
exercise. Furthermore, due to a traditional diet of salty and 
protein-poor foods, the town’s death rate was 1.7 times higher 
than the national average between 1983 and 1987, with 
relatively high rates of stomach cancer. The number of 
bedridden elderly people suffering from osteoporosis or 
arthritis is also higher than the national average[8]. 
B. Introduction of the telecare system in Nishi-aizu 
The town introduced telecare in 1994 to reduce the 
incidence of chronic diseases such as cerebral infarction and 
stroke. Three hundred peripheral devices, called “Urara,” 
manufactured by Nasa Corporation, were provided to residents 
with chronic diseases. The Urara device is connected to a host 
computer via a public switched telephone network. Health-
related data such as the user’s blood pressure, pulse rate, ECG, 
blood oxygen level, weight, and body temperature are 
transmitted to a server operated by the town. In 1996 and 1997, 
an additional 50 terminals were purchased with subsidies from 
the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. In 
2002/2003, an additional 187 terminals were purchased with 
the town budget. The town thus currently owns 587 terminals. 
These terminals use the CATV network for transmitting data. 
All the costs of operating the system are paid for by the local 
government. The Urara devices are distributed to the following 
three groups of patients: (i) elderly residents with diseases, (ii) 
elderly residents who have been referred by a doctor, (iii) other 
residents who are living alone or referred by a doctor[9]. 
C. Operation of the telecare system in Nishi-aizu 
The Nishi-aizu Department of Health and Welfare oversees 
the administration of the telecare system. Six public health 
nurses check the health data transmitted by the Urara devices 
and use that data as part of their consultations with users. If 
these nurses observe unusual data, they ask a medical doctor 
from one of the clinics to visit the user in question. The health 
data for each user are summarized in a monthly report, which 
is then sent to the physician in charge. After the physician and 
a public health nurse add their comments, the report is sent to 
the user. When the user visits a doctor, they are asked to bring 
the report with them (see [9] for more details). 
The telecare system is operated as part of the town’s 
“Project for Promoting Total Care,” and the underlying 
principle is close collaboration between the health, medical, 
and welfare activities in the town. Regional Care Meetings are 
an important example of this collaboration. More than 20 
people attend each meeting, which consists of doctors, nurses, 
public health nurses, town office staff, care-takers of the 
elderly, and lifestyle advisers. At these meetings, medical care 
for individual telecare users, such as necessary medical 
examinations, specific health advice, and general healthcare 
issues, are discussed in detail, the telecare health data playing a 
central role. To improve the residents’ motivation for using the 
telecare system, the town office organizes telecare users’ 
meetings five times a year. At the meetings, users can 
exchange their experiences and views of using the system. In 
fact, our in-depth interviews conducted with public nurses 
working in Nishi-aizu revealed that the number of patients with 
chronic diseases visiting doctors decreased with increasing 
telecare use.  
The introduction of the telecare system should not be 
considered the sole factor promoting better regional healthcare; 
rather, it should be seen as the framework that assists all the 
departments and personnel involved to deliver more effective 
health care. 
III.     MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Here we outline the materials and methods used in this 
paper. 
A.  Sample selection 
Here two kinds of data for analysis, namely receipt data and 
responses of questionnaire are explained. In our previous study, 
the receipt data for 199 users and 209 non-users collected 
between 2002 and 2006 was obtained from the National Health 
Insurance. The receipts for each month are kept at the Nishi-
aizu town office, and include a range of information. In the 
current study, the following data were used: (i) name of patient, 
(ii) birth date, (iii) regular outpatient treatment or hospitalized 
225

patient treatment, (iv) name(s) of major disease(s), (v) date of 
initial treatment, (vi) number of days of treatment was needed, 
and (vii) the medical treatment “points” (one point is 
equivalent to JPY10).  
Next the receipt data for the years 2007 to 2010 was 
collected. To ensure that the patients included in the previous 
studies were also included in the current study, we first 
checked whether they responded to the questionnaire survey 
(whether the person had deceased or not, etc.); about half of the 
subjects failed to respond, which resulted in a lack of samples. 
We therefore selected 565 new subjects from among the 
telecare users. The questionnaire used in this study was the 
same as that used in our previous studies. The questionnaire 
asks for information on characteristics such as sex, age, and the 
individuals’ use of the telecare system, which is data not 
included in the receipt data. Non-users were selected by 
stratified sampling from the list of subscribers to the National 
Health Insurance, which amounted to 1035 non-users. The 
respondents are summarized in Table I, which shows that 272 
users and 247 non-users were selected as valid respondents for 
this study; 91 users and 118 non-users were included in both 
the previous study and the current study. We then collected the 
data mentioned above (regarding the construction of data, see 
[9] in more detail.).

The telecare system in Nishi-aizu was implemented to help 
in the management of chronic diseases such as heart disease, 
hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. Table IV shows the number 
of patients with these four diseases that were treated within the 
study period. Hypertension was the most common of these four 
diseases, followed by heart disease. 
Table V summarizes the number of years of individual 
telecare use. Users that had used the telecare system for more 
than 10 years accounted for 25.6% of the total number of users, 
which is the largest percentage, and this makes examination of 
the long-term effect of the system possible. The number of 
respondents who replied that they did not use the telecare 
system accounted for 30% of the respondents, which is larger 
than expected. It is possible that they responded that they did 
not use the system since they became too old, even though they 
had a telecare device in their homes.

Table VI summarizes frequency of telecare use. More than 
half of the respondents reported that they used the telecare 
system at least once a week to communicate with a nurse or to

alert medical staff of distress or discomfort. This high 
frequency of use is possibly due to the town office’s efforts in 
holding public meetings to educate users in the use of the 
system, as already mentioned. One fourth of respondents 
answered that they rarely use the telecare system, which 
corresponds with the number of users who answered that they 
do not use the system (Table V). 
D. Method of estimation 
The outcome variables of days of treatment and medical 
expenditure are not stable over the study period, and it is 
difficult to assess whether there are any differences between 
users and non-users over the study period. Rigorous statistical 
analyses are therefore necessary. We thus employed a 
regression analysis to assess whether telecare use reduces days 
of treatment and/or medical expenditure. Studies in this field 
face a number of important methodological issues. First, there 
is the problem of endogenous explanatory variables. One 
method of solving this is by using system GMM, which allows 
treatment of not only endogenous explanatory variables but 
also of the dynamic relationships among the variables that arise 
due to the chronic time-lagged effect of chronic diseases on 
patients. Moreover, system GMM is able to deal with the 
reverse correlation between outpatient medical expenditure and 
telecare use. In this context, we attempted to demonstrate 
causality between telecare use and decreased medical 
expenditures, or, in other words, to show that the relationship is 
not seemingly correlated. A number of previous studies have 
successfully attempted to handle endogeneity problems in 
telemedicine and telecare evaluation[3][5][6]. 
IV.    RESULTS 
Here we set out the results of our estimations. 
A.  Model for estimation 
In the estimation, the dependent variables were (1) days of 
treatment of outpatients, all diseases, (2) medical expenditure 
for outpatients, all diseases, (3) days of treatment of outpatients, 
chronic diseases, and (4) medical expenditure for outpatients, 
chronic diseases. The explanatory variables were telecare use 
(if users, 1; otherwise, 0), age, income, and the presence of any 
of the four main chronic diseases such as heart disease, 
hypertension, diabetes, and stroke (if treated, 1; otherwise, 0). 
In addition, other factors were added as instrumental variables, 
such as dummy variables for sex or year dummies. System 
GMM estimators developed by Arellano–Bond, Arellano–
Bover, and Blundell–Bond are general estimators for coping 
with data that have “small T, large N” panels. System GMM 
can be used in models in which the independent variables are 
not strictly exogenous, namely, those correlated with past and 
possibly current realizations of the error. System GMM can 
also be used to treat data with heteroskedasticity. The 
Arellano–Bond test for AR (2) (second stage autocorrelation), 
the test of weak instruments, and the Hansen test for over-
identifying restrictions were used. 
B.  Estimation results, all diseases 
Tables VII and VIII show the results of the estimation 
using system GMM. The coefficient of telecare use is 
negatively significant for days of treatment (p<0.10) and 
medical expenditure (p<0.05). These findings imply that 
telecare contributed to reductions in days of treatment and 
medical expenditure. However, the Arellano–Bond test for AR 
(2) for the model of medical expenditures (see Table VIII) 
showed that there was autocorrelation under the 1% 
significance level. This means that serial correlation of the 
error terms cannot be denied, and accordingly, the estimates 
still have small biases. The test of weak instruments showed 
that instruments and endogenous variables used are correlated 
significantly, which indicates exemption from a problem of 
weak instruments. Furthermore, the Hansen test for over-
identifying restrictions showed that the instrumental variables 
were properly chosen. This means that the model specification 
was adequate and that the parameters were significant and 
robust. In addition, age is positively significant for both days of 
treatment and medical expenditure (p< 0.01), which is natural 
considering that days of treatment and medical expenditure 
increase with age. Finally, the coefficients of three chronic 
diseases (heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes) are 
positively significant for both days of treatment and medical 
expenditure. According to the estimations, telecare use reduces 
days of treatment for all diseases by 7.9 days per user per year, 
and medical expenditures for all diseases by approximately 
JPY 106,904 per user per year. However, the latter may contain 
biases due to serial correlation, and therefore the result may not 
be reliable.

C.  Estimation results, chronic diseases 
The same models were applied for patients with chronic 
diseases. The other variables were the same as in the previous 
estimations. Tables IX and X summarize the results of these 
estimations. Both the Arellano–Bond test for autocorrelations, 
the test of weak instruments, and the Hansen test for over-
identifying restrictions were satisfied, since they were not 
significant (p =0.692). Thus, the instrumental variables were 
selected appropriately. The coefficients for telecare use were 
negatively significant for both days of treatment (p<0.05) and 
medical expenditure (p<0.05). Age was again positively 
significant for both outcomes (p<0.01). In contrast to the 
previous estimation, only hypertension was positively 
significant for days of treatment (p<0.01) and medical

expenditure (p<0.01). This means that hypertension is a major 
contributing factor to days of treatment and medical 
expenditures. The coefficients indicate that telecare use reduces 
days of treatment for chronic diseases by 4.2 days per user per 
year, and medical expenditure for chronic diseases by JPY 
64,944 per user per year.

D.  Comparison with the results of five year data  
Table XI summarizes the results from our previous study of 
the five-year period between 2002 and 2006[1][2][3]. The 
results obtained in the current study are larger than those 
reported previously, which means that telecare use produces 
both long-term and short-term effects. Therefore, the longer 
patients use telecare, the larger the reductions in days of 
treatment and medical expenditure. 
The analysis of the nine-year period only demonstrated the 
result (i); telecare users had a lower medical expenditure on 
chronic diseases than non-users. Regarding the result (ii); the 
longer the subjects use telecare, the lower medical 
expenditures become, [10] demonstrated this result by using 
the difference-in-difference propensity score matching (DID-
PSM) method, which enables examination of the time trend 
effect. In particular, for patients with chronic diseases, 
medical expenditures over 10 years are reduced by 
JPY21,194.6 (US$235,5) (p<0.05), and treatment days by 1.73 
days (p<0.05) per year per user. These are smaller than the 
results obtained in this paper. Other results obtained in the 
five-year data are unable to show reductions mainly due to the 
small number of subjects in the 2012 research. In addition, 
further rigorous statistical inference is required.

V.       CONCLUSTIONS 
This study aims ato providinge one clue tofor solveing athe 
global issue of the increase in patients with chronic diseases 
and suggests itthat the solution is telecare. The economic effect 
of telecare obtained here is not limited to an example in Japan 
alone. The research of the effect of telemedicine in other 
countries with macro data, representative macro approaches 
include those of [11] and [12], which used national cross-
sectional data or panel data from OECD countries, 
respectively. Representative micro approaches include the 
following four papers. Evaluating 19 cases in Australia, [13] 
found that the cost-effectiveness of both telehealth and 
telemedicine improved considerably when they were part of 
an integrated use of telecommunications and information 
technology; [14] showed that advancements in e-Health 
transformed health care delivery and achieved such positive 
results as improving clinical decision making, increasing 
efficiency, and strengthening communication between 
physicians and patients; [15] found that an interactive 
telephonic support system which included coaching, 
education, and reinforcement modules reduced total costs 
for hospitalizations and emergency room visits by $5,271 
per user per year; and [16] reported an average visit cost of 
$48.27 for a face-to-face home visit versus $22.10 for a

virtual visit. Moreover, [17] conducted a systematic search 
of the literature and concluded that information technologies 
were effective in improving the quality and efficiency of 
care.     
Regarding the studies that used micro data, there are similar 
projects with telecare in other countries. Scientific results have 
been obtained and it is possible to compare our results with 
those of other projects. Results obtained in other countries 
consist of the Kent Development Pilot in the UK and the VHA 
CCHT project in the US. The former studied the effect of 
telehealth on the number of inpatient days, general 
practitioners (GP), acute care, and others by experimental 
observation with statistical analysis[18]. This study compared 
outcomes at baseline and after six months with a focus on 
patients with COPD, heart disease, and diabetes. The authors 
concluded that telecare use resulted in a decrease in the number 
of home visits and GP surgery per participant, Accident and 
Emergency (A&E) visits of 0.5days, and inpatient treatment 
days of 1.5days. The results of the VHA CCHT project in the 
US are similar to those of the Kent study, that is, the number of 
inpatient treatment days was reduced by 25%, and the number 
of hospital admissions by 19%[19]. Thus the results of 
international projects were estimated mainly in terms of 
inpatient treatment days, not expenditures, and for all diseases, 
not only chronic diseases. This paper aimed to obtain results 
which are directly comparable with other studies. According to 
our results, the Nishi-aizu project shows a larger reduction in 
inpatient treatment days than the Kent project (3.3 vs. 1.5 days). 
On the other hand, the reduction of bed days is calculated as 
approximately 16.12% in this paper, which is smaller than that 
of the VHA project (25%). 
The results obtained in this study show the importance of 
telemedicine. Japanese local governments implementing this 
system currently do not charge users for the service. The 
system is funded from tax money raised from local residents. 
For the initial investment for the in-home devices, servers, and 
network, local governments receive subsidies from the central 
government. The Nishi-aizu local government received funds 
from three different ministries. However, due to the current 
adverse economic situation in Japan, local governments can no 
longer rely on such subsidies, implying that the sustainability 
of telecare or e-Health is an issue that urgently needs to be 
addressed[8]. From a financial point of view, a new framework 
is required. Reimbursement through the medical insurance 
system, for example, is one possibility for increasing the use of 
telecare systems. Here, we provide an important basis for 
evidence-based public health policies.  
It should be noted for further research that chronic 
conditions tend not to occur singly, and many patients have 
more than one at the same time. For example, patients with 
high blood pressure or diabetes are also likely to suffer from 
heart disease. This multiplicity of conditions hampers analysis. 
This paper examines single chronic diseases, and does not 
include multiplicity. In addition, neither does this study analyze 
how telecare improves these outcomes. In the telecare system 
introduced in Section II, telecare users become more concerned 
about their health condition when reviewing the data returned 
to them by the town health office, and make personal efforts to 
improve their health indicators. This assists in the prevention of 
chronic diseases. Although these psychological effects cannot 
be denied, more studies are required on the medical 
mechanisms by which telecare imparts positive impacts on 
health. These are remaining issues for future study.
