Abstract— The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
equivalence 
of 
head 
computed 
tomography 
(CT) 
interpretations 
performed 
with 
either 
a 
diagnostic 
workstation or a smartphone in an emergency telestroke 
service. After institutional review board approval, a factorial 
design with 1504 interpretations was used (188 patients, 4 
radiologists, and 2 reading systems). The variables evaluated 
included the following image findings: presence of 
hemorrhagic lesion, imaging contraindications for the 
administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator 
(tPA), ischemic lesion in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA), 
middle cerebral artery (MCA), and/or posterior circulation 
(PC) territory, hyperdense MCA, and a dichotomized score 
of the well-known Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score 
(ASPECTS). The statistical equivalence between each 
variable was studied for all reading systems, and the 
reliability was analyzed using the Fleiss’ kappa coefficient. 
The statistical equivalence (P < 0.05) was achieved at a 5% 
difference for all variables. To claim equivalence, the 
differences between the two reading systems were obtained 
and ranged from 0.5% to 4% - the minimum for 
hemorrhagic lesions and maximum for hyperdense MCA. 
Intraobserver agreements were classified as moderate, good 
or very good, with kappa values ranging from 0.52 to 0.94. 
In addition, we obtained a maximum agreement on the 
hemorrhagic lesions and a minimum agreement on the 
presence of ischemic lesions in ACA; this outcome deserves a 
particular analysis. Finally, we conclude that after providing 
radiologists with real clinical scenarios, the diagnostic 
performance for detecting acute stroke is likely equivalent 
regardless of the use of a smartphone or a diagnostic 
workstation. Mobile solutions are feasible alternatives for 
the interpretation of head CT images in patients with acute 
stroke and can be used as a handy tool in the development of 
more efficient telestroke services.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Stroke is an acute neurologic dysfunction of vascular 
origin involving focal areas in the brain. It is considered a 
major cause of death and disability in developed and 
developing countries [1][2].

Patients with acute stroke symptoms who arrive at the 
emergency 
room 
require 
a 
comprehensive 
initial 
evaluation including the time of symptom onset, baseline 
risk factors, severity of their neurologic condition [3]-[5] 
and their potential for recuperation based on several 
clinical predictors, most importantly, an ischemic versus 
hemorrhagic etiology [6]-[9]. This task requires high 
levels of clinical and radiological expertise. For patients 
with ischemic stroke, determining whether to perform an 
endovascular thrombectomy and/or treat the patient with 
the administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen 
activator (tPA) is always a challenging task [10]. 
However, few eligible patients receive these treatment 
modalities due to their geographic distances from primary 
stroke centers or the limited availability of vascular 
neurologists and neuroradiologists to define the eligibility 
to receive this treatment. 
In most hospitals in Colombia, there are no 
neuroradiologists at all. Similarly, in our location, which is 
a Joint Commission International (JCI)-certified primary 
stroke 
center 
with 
endovascular 
thrombectomy 
capabilities, there are not enough neuroradiologists in situ 
to support a telestroke network. To increase the 
availability of neuroradiologists, mobile solutions using 
smartphones should be evaluated. 
Noncontrast head CT is the most widely used first 
imaging technique in patients with acute stroke symptoms 
[11]. This examination allows us to establish whether the 
stroke is hemorrhagic or ischemic and for ischemic 
strokes, determine whether it is acute or chronic; in 
addition, it allows professionals to rule out any 
contraindications to tPA administration from the imaging 
point of view. These contraindications may be the 
presence 
of 
the 
following: 
intra-axial 
neoplasm, 
intracranial 
neoplasm, 
arteriovenous 
malformation, 
aneurysm, hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic 
infarct, and infarction > 1/3 of middle cerebral artery 
territory, which may be estimated using the ASPECTS 
[12]. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and 
diagnostic equivalence of head CT interpretations when 
using a smartphone compared to a primary diagnostic 
interpretation workstation in an emergency telestroke 
service. 
Next, we describe how the variables were determined, 
the characteristics of the remote equipment used, the 
methodology for data collection and the statistical tools for 
the analysis of the results; in Section 2, we describe the 
results according to the intraobserver agreement with 
respect to the diagnostic performance of stroke. Finally, 
we describe our experience with the reliability of the 
remote smartphone device and the projections of 
teleradiology in a society that seeks to efficient attention in 
the cases of stroke. 
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of our institution 
approved this retrospective study and waived the 
requirement of informed consent. We employed a factorial 
design with repeated measures. 
A. Sample 
Patients with symptoms of acute stroke who presented 
to the emergency room for urgent evaluation between 
2013 and 2018 were included in the study. The patients 
were randomly selected without repetition. Cases with 
image artifacts were excluded. The cases consisted of head 
CT examinations stored in our hospital Picture Archiving 
and Communication System (PACS), which were acquired 
using a General Electric LightSpeed 64 slice CT 
scanner (General 
Electric 
Healthcare, 
GE 
Medical 
Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA), with 100 kV, 10 mAs, 
axial: 5 mm, sagittal: 3 mm, FOV: 26 cm, pixel spacing: 
0.469, and matrix: 512 x 512. 
B. Observers and interpretation variables 
Four neuroradiologists were selected as observers 
(three with over ten years of experience and one with four 
years of experience in neuroradiology). They were asked 
to evaluate the presence of hemorrhagic lesions, the 
confidence in the presence of any ischemic lesion in the 
ACA territory, MCA territory, PCA territory, and the 
confidence in the presence of a hyperdense MCA. The 
confidence in the presence of these conditions was ranked 
using the following scores: 0, definitely absent; 1, most 
likely absent; 2, cannot decide; 3, most likely present; and 
4, definitely present. For all cases in which an ischemic 
lesion was detected in the MCA territory (scores 3 or 4), 
time evolution was also inquired (i.e., acute, subacute, 
chronic). For acute lesions, the ASPECTS score was 
reported by selecting regions with infarcts in the MCA 
territory, obtaining a score that ranged from 0–10. Finally, 
the presence of one or more imaging contraindications for 
tPA administration, such as an intra-axial neoplasm, 
intracranial 
neoplasm, 
arteriovenous 
malformation, 
aneurysm or hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic 
infarct, was also evaluated. 
C. Display monitors and viewer software 
The routine reading system for CT interpretations in 
our hospital is a PACS workstation with a Digital Imaging 
and Communication in Medicine (DICOM)-compliant 
viewer software Agfa IMPAX 6.5 (AGFA HealthCare, 
Mortsel, Belgium). Images were displayed using an E-
2620 BARCO monitor (BARCO N.V, Kortrijk, Belgium), 
which is a 2-megapixel (MPx) LCD medical grayscale 
display, DICOM-compliant, dot pitch of 0.249 mm, with a 
spatial resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels, a maximum 
luminance of 700 cd/m2, and an 8-bit grayscale. This 
reading system, hereafter referred to as Medical-IMPAX, 
was used as the reference reading system in this study. 
As a mobile alternative, a Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus 
(Samsung Electronics, South Korea) smartphone, with a 
display of 146.5 mm (5.8"), 570 pixels per inch, a spatial 
resolution of 1440 x 2960 pixels, and a maximum 
luminance of 1000 cd/m2 was selected. The viewer 
software used on this smartphone was the Agfa XERO 
130

Viewer 3.0 (Agfa HealthCare, Mortsel, Belgium) software. 
This reading system is hereafter referred to as 
Smartphone-XERO. 
D. Procedure 
Each radiologist read all cases using both the Medical-
IMPAX and the Smartphone-XERO systems. At each 
reading, 
the 
radiologist 
determined 
the 
variables 
mentioned in the section “Observers and interpretation 
variables”. The two reading software packages provided 
image manipulation tools to adjust the window/level, 
zoom and multiplanar reformation presentation. These 
tools were available for all images and could be used at the 
observer’s discretion to improve the image interpretations. 
The radiologists were blinded to the patient name, any 
individualizing items and the original image report. Data 
collection was performed using a web-based platform, and 
image readings were stored in a secured database. This 
software randomizes cases and guides the radiologist 
throughout the complete report, thus ensuring the integrity 
and completeness of the data. Relevant clinical data such 
as sex, age, main neurological symptoms and relevant past 
medical history (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, headache, 
Parkinson’s 
disease, 
Alzheimer’s 
disease, 
sleep 
apnea/hypopnea syndrome, or cardiac arrhythmia) were 
also available. Readings were performed over the course 
of one year in two or four-hour sessions per reader, with 
no time limitations for each case. This was a 
counterbalanced study for the reading systems used by 
each radiologist in each session. 
E. Data analysis 
The confidence scores were dichotomized to evaluate 
both reliability and equivalence. Scores from 0–2 were 
classified as negative, and scores from 3–4 were classified 
as positive. Patients with an ASPECTS score ≤ 5 are not 
eligible to receive tPA treatment. Thus, we dichotomized 
the ASPECTS score into two categories: 0 if the score 
ranged 
from 
0–5 
(a 
contraindication 
for 
tPA 
administration) and 1 if the score ranged from 6–10 
(indicating eligibility for the administration of the tPA 
treatment). This variable was named “dichotomized-
ASPECTS”. 
The variables presence of hemorrhagic lesions and 
presence of any imaging contraindications to tPA 
administration were not dichotomized as they were already 
binary (i.e., 0: negative, 1: positive). 
Reliability was evaluated in terms of intraobserver 
agreements of interpretation (cases rated by the same 
observer using different reading systems), with the Fleiss’ 
kappa coefficient [13]. The kappa coefficients were ranked 
as defined by Altman [14]: “very good”, ( = 1 to 0.81); 
“good”, ( = 0.8 to 0.61); “moderate”, ( = 0.6 to 0.41); 
“fair”, ( = 0.4 to 0.21); and “poor”, ( < 0.2). For these 
calculations, STATA 13.0 software (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX, USA) was used. 
The dichotomized variables were evaluated to 
determine their statistical equivalence by means of 
generalized estimated equations (GEE) [15] using IBM 
SPSS Statistics 19 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, 
USA). To evaluate equivalence, mean differences and 
standard errors were obtained from the GEE analysis. The 
hypothesis test for equivalence was as follows: the null 
hypothesis H0 was |Mean Difference (I-J)| - δ = 0, and the 
alternative hypothesis Ha was |Mean Difference (I-J)| - 
δ < 0, where I and J are the two reading systems compared 
and δ (delta) is the maximum allowable difference 
permitted to claim equivalence, as suggested by several 
authors in recent years [16]-[19]. We calculated a (1-2α)% 
confidence interval for all comparisons, which is also a 
method to evaluate equivalence [18][19]. The significance 
level was set to 5% (i.e., α = 0.05), and δ was set to 0.05 
(5%). Finally, we calculated the required value of δ to 
claim equivalence for each variable (named δeq in our 
result tables). 
The reading time was also recorded by the software to 
evaluate the equivalence between the two reading systems. 
As this variable is continuous, the mean differences and 
their standard errors were obtained from an ANOVA with 
the IBM SPSS Statistics 19 software. 
III. 
RESULTS 
There were 90 (47.87%) males and 98 (52.13%) 
females in the sample. The ages of the patients ranged 
from 30–97 years, with a mean age of 71.3 years (standard 
deviation of 15) overall, with a mean age of 69.1 years for 
males and 73.3 years for females. 
To carry out the reliability and equivalence evaluation, 
each variable must be set by all four observers. The 
detection of any hemorrhagic lesion was set by all 
observers; hence, there were 188 patients for this variable 
and 1504 readings (188 patients by 4 observers by 2 
systems). Of these 188 patients, 28 were classified as 
hemorrhagic lesions by all observers, and 160 were 
evaluated for other findings (e.g., contraindications to the 
tPA administration, infarct in the anterior, middle or 
posterior cerebral artery territories, and hyperdense middle 
cerebral artery). For these variables, 1280 readings were 
included in the reliability and equivalence evaluations. 
Finally, for patients with acute infarct in the middle 
cerebral artery territory, the ASPECTS score was 
calculated, ending up with 118 patients with ASPECTS 
score set by all radiologists; therefore, 944 readings were 
included in the evaluations. 
A. Intraobserver agreement 
The intraobserver agreements between the Medical-
IMPAX and Smartphone-XERO reading systems, i.e., 
when each case was interpreted the same way using both 
the Medical-IMPAX and the Smartphone-XERO reading 
systems, by the same observer, are presented in Table I. 
There was very good intraobserver agreement on the 
hemorrhagic lesion detection, ( = 0.94, P < 0.001). 
There was a moderate intraobserver agreement on the 
detection of contraindications to tPA administration 
(presence of intra-axial neoplasm, intracranial neoplasm, 
arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, or hemorrhagic 
transformation of an ischemic infarct), ( = 0.55,

P < 0.001). There was a good intraobserver agreement on 
the dichotomized-ASPECTS (0-5; 6-10) in the MCA 
territory ( = 0.66, P < 0.001).

a Readings were performed on the two systems by four observers. All values were significant 
(P < 0.001) b as defined by Altman [14]. Intraobserver agreement between both reading systems 
showed a very good agreement for the diagnosis of hemorrhagic lesions and an appropriate 
agreement for those variables that are the most important for stroke in which administration of 
tPA determines the survival of the patients.

a Equivalence tests for all variables were statistically significant, all P < 0.05, at a difference of 
5% (δ = 0.05). SE = Standard error of the mean difference, α = significance of the test (0.05), δ = 
difference of the means set to test equivalence, δeq = minimum δ required to achieve equivalence. 
The null and alternative hypotheses were |difference| - δ = 0 and |difference| - δ < 0, respectively. 
 
A moderate intraobserver agreement on the presence of 
an ACA territory infarction was also observed ( = 0.52, 
P < 0.001). In contrast, good intraobserver agreements on 
the presence of an MCA territory infarction and the 
presence of a PCA territory infarction were observed, with 
 = 0.68 and 0.63, respectively (both P < 0.001). In the 
presence of a hyperdense middle cerebral artery, a good 
intraobserver 
agreement 
was 
observed 
( = 
0.62, 
P < 0.001). 
B. Equivalence tests for the imaging findings 
The mean differences between the variables using both 
reading systems, the standard error of the differences, and 
the (1-2α)% confidence interval for equivalence testing, at 
a delta (δ) difference of 5%, are presented in Table II. In 
addition, the minimum δ required to claim equivalence 
(δeq) was calculated and presented in the last column. 
Equivalence tests for all variables were statistically 
significant, all P < 0.05, showing equivalence at a 
difference of 5%. The largest (1-2α)% confidence interval 
was for the presence of a hyperdense middle cerebral 
artery and the smallest was for the detection of a 
hemorrhagic lesion. The minimum δ required to claim 
equivalence (δeq) for each variable ranged from 0.0051 
(0.51%) for the detection of hemorrhagic lesions to 0.0401 
(4.01%) for the detection of hyperdense middle cerebral 
artery. 
Both a low mean difference and a low minimum δ 
required to claim equivalence were observed for the 
presence of contraindications to tPA administration and for 
dichotomized-ASPECTS 
(δeq = 1.52% 
and 
3.23%, 
respectively). 
C. Reading time 
The mean reading time was 114.31 s for the Medical-
IMPAX system and 143.39 s for the Smartphone-XERO. 
The mean difference between the two reading systems was 
-29.08 s (standard error = 5.4). The equivalence tests for 
this variable produced a significant (P < 0.001) result at a 
reading time delta of 60 s. The minimum δ required to 
claim equivalence (δeq) for reading time was 38 s. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
High intraobserver agreements between the Medical-
IMPAX and Smartphone-XERO reading systems were 
observed, with kappa values ranging from 0.52 to 0.94. 
This suggests that every time that a radiologist reads the 
same patient image using any of the two reading systems, 
either the Medical-IMPAX or the Smartphone-XERO, 
there are no differences in the initial patient outcome. A 
very good intraobserver agreement was observed for 
hemorrhagic lesions ( = 0.94). These findings are 
consistent with other studies that used a tablet computer as 
a mobile solution [20]-[24]. 
Previous 
studies 
have 
reported 
nonsignificant 
differences in the detection of ischemic lesions between 
tablet 
computers 
and 
primary 
workstations 
[20][22][25][26]. However, the variables and evaluation 
methods used in these studies were different from those 
132

used in our analysis, and it is important to note that other 
similar studies did not include a smartphone as a 
diagnostic device. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that 
used reliability and equivalence statistical methods to 
identify potential diagnostic differences between a 
smartphone and a primary diagnostic workstation in 
reading head CT examinations in a telestroke context prior 
to intravenous thrombolysis. Furthermore, when the gold 
standard is available, a diagnostic accuracy evaluation, 
using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves, 
will be conducted. 
The results of our study indicate that the patients who 
were not eligible for tPA administration based on imaging 
criteria, e.g., those having ASPECTS ≤ 5, or the presence 
of an intra-axial neoplasm, intracranial neoplasm, 
arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, or hemorrhagic 
transformation of an ischemic infarct, were well detected 
when performed by experienced radiologists using both 
reading systems. 
One limitation of this study centers on the illumination 
conditions. Readings using the Medical-IMPAX system 
were performed in diagnostic rooms with controlled 
ambient light levels. In contrast, readings using the 
Smartphone-XERO system were performed without 
controlling ambient light levels. Nevertheless, this 
situation is more realistic for a telestroke system in which 
a radiologist is asked to interpret a head CT as soon as 
possible wherever he or she is located. 
The smartphone used in this study was an average-
sized mobile phone compared to the ones used today, in 
which the XERO viewer software allows adjustments of 
window/level and changes over reconstruction planes 
(sagittal, coronal or axial), similar to a PACS workstation. 
Radiologists indicated the absence of ergonomic problems 
because the use of the smartphone was comparable with 
the daily use of personal devices. Finally, they reported 
better performance when making adjustments using a 
mobile pen than when they did it tactilely. Interpretation 
using the smartphone spent an average of 29 seconds more 
than a PACS workstation, which is a reading time that 
does not affect the goals stipulated in our protocol for 
stroke code and is negligible compared with the transport 
time of a neuroradiologist to the hospital in our city. 
. 
In conclusion, there was no superiority of any specific 
reading system on the evaluated clinical variables. In 
addition, a high intraobserver agreement was documented 
for the same variables, providing evidence that the 
Medical-IMPAX and Smartphone-XERO reading systems 
may be interchangeable without any reliability loss. 
This study provides evidence that the Smartphone-
XERO reading system can be used for acute stroke 
diagnosis based on head CT examinations, ruling out 
possible imaging contraindications to tPA administration 
and ASPECTS quantification. 
In the statistical design of this study, the radiologist 
and the reading systems were fixed factors because they 
were not selected at random; therefore, our results only 
apply to them. Nevertheless, as neuroradiologists are 
highly specialized readers of neurological images, we 
expect that our results may be extrapolated to other groups 
of neuroradiologists. Similarly, the reading systems in 
radiology must be DICOM-compliant, which allows us to 
generalize our results to other reading software or medical 
displays. In contrast, the smartphone display used in this 
study may be significantly different when compared to 
other smartphone displays; hence, our results only apply to 
smartphones with “retina” display or similar displays. 
As future work, the web platform for reading the Head 
CT of patients with suspicion of acute stroke will be used 
to train radiologists for these cases, for example, to train 
them in evaluating the infarct size using the ASPECTS 
and finding contraindications for tPA administration. In 
addition, the data stored will be used with machine 
learning and data mining techniques to understand and 
improve the reading process of neuroradiologists and the 
subsequent search of diagnostic aids using image 
processing.
