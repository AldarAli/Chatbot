Abstract—This article describes an exploratory study in which
children with autism interact with KASPAR, a humanoid robot,
equipped with tactile sensors able to distinguish a gentle from a
harsh touch, and to respond accordingly. The study investigated
a novel scenario for robot-assisted play, namely to increase
body awareness with tasks that taught the children about the
identiﬁcation of human body parts. Based on our analysis of the
childrens behaviours while interacting with KASPAR, our results
show that the children started looking for a longer period of time
to the experimenter, and a lot of interest in touching the robot
was observed. They also show that the robot can be considered as
a tool for prolonging the attention span of the children, being a
social mediator during the interaction between the child and the
experimenter. The results are primarily based on the analysis of
video data of the interaction. Overall, this ﬁrst study into teaching
children with autism about body parts using a humanoid robot
highlighted issues of scenario development, data collection and
data analysis that will inform future studies.

I. INTRODUCTION
Three critical factors for the healthy physical and psycho-
logical child’s development are touch, movement and interac-
tion with other humans. Touch is one of the earliest senses
developed in human embryos and the most developed sense
at birth [1]. Thus, touch plays a key role in the physical,
emotional, and psycho-social development. Touch deprivation
early in life leads to severe consequences, like complete
emotional isolation or lack of trust in others [1]–[3]. Children
need up to four hours per day of physical play to accomplish
satisfactory sensory stimulation for their proprioceptive and
tactile systems in order to develop normally [4]. On one hand,
touch can convey affectioned feelings, on the other, it can
express pain or discomfort.
Touch can be divided into cutaneous, kinesthetic, and
haptic systems [5]. The cutaneous system is constituted of
mechanoreceptors set in the skin. This system composes
the tactile sense, processing stimulations on the skin. The
kinesthetic system is constituted of receptors situated in the
muscles, tendons, and joints. The kinesthetic sense allows
humans to identify positions and movements of upper and
lower limbs and muscle tensions. The haptic sensory system
concerns both cutaneous and kinesthetic receptors, but it is
associated with an active procedure [5]. Children learn early
on to understand and to identify different types of physical
contact in order to communicate with other children and
adults, building trust relationships, based on the exchange
of support and mutual conﬁdence, developing their social
relationships.
According to Piaget infants develop object permanence
through touching and handling objects [6]. Object permanence
is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when
they cannot be seen, heard, or touched [7]. Caregivers typically
offer organized environments where children can explore,
touch and manipulate different materials and where they can
be able to ask questions, use their creativity and learn new
concepts. Children have to build their own learning experience,
with the focus on the reasoning processes [8].
In this study, we used a humanoid, minimally expressive
child-sized robot with a static body - KASPAR ( [9] for
technical details), able to move its arms and head in order to
simulate gestures in social interaction. KASPAR has simpliﬁed
and minimalistic human-like features. The robot’s behavioural
repertoire includes expressive postures, it can approximate
the appearance and movements of a human without trying to
create an ultra-realistic appearance. KASPAR is equipped with
tactile sensors that allow it to automatically respond to a gentle
or rough touch from the child. The tasks used this study aim
to teach the children to identify their body parts, and increase
their body awareness. As we can see in the Section II, robots
have already been used with children with autism to develop
their social and communicative skills with encouraging results.
In the present study, the robot is going to be used as a mediator
between the child and the experimenter but also as a tool of
teaching. Our main research interest is to understand if the
robot can help to elicit interactions between an autistic child
and another person, and whether it can facilitate the ability to
acquire knowledge about human body parts. We want to verify

if the robot can help children with ASD (Autism Spectrum
Disorder) to learn appropriate physical social engagement. The
experiments consisted of 7 sessions with 8 children diagnosed
with autism, using qualitative and quantitative measures to
evaluate the triadic interaction between the children, the robot,
and the experimenter. In this article, we present the analysis
of the observations of the ﬁrst and the last session with the 8
children. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst article that studies
how to use robots in order to teach children with autism
about body parts. Due to the novelty of the subject a main
purpose of the article was to develop scenarios, means of data
collection and to learn how to analyse the data. This paper
is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 will be presented research
projets that also use tactile human-robot interactions. Sect. 3
features the procedures during the experiments. The results and
the discussion are described in Sect. 4 and 5. Sect. 6 provides
the conclusions and future work.
II. TACTILE INTERACTION
As mentioned earlier, touch plays a vital role in human-
human interaction. Since it is our goal to transmit extra
information to the robot, so it can react predictable and
convincing to a human tactile interaction, the robot needs
to be equipped with tactile sensing capabilities. The robot’s
behaviour must appear natural, in order to generate enjoyable
interactions.
There are several research projects concerned with the phys-
ical contact between humans and robots, presenting various
types of sensors to detect these interactions, for example the
cheap and robust sensors that can measure force or pressure,
changing its resistance, called force-sensing resistors (FSR)
[10]. The information provided by tactile sensors aims to
increase quality and interpretation of sensor data. We can mea-
sure improvements in tactile sensing according to data quality,
assessed relatively to detection sensitivity, noise and physical
toughness and also its signal interpretation, assessed relatively
to computational cost and measurement accuracy [10]. The
detected contact should be used to produce compliant robotic
behaviours.
Robots for human-robot interactions (HRI) within the cur-
rent tactile HRI literature can have different shapes [10]. The
baby seal Paro [11], the teddy bear Huggable [12], the robotic
cat NeCoRo [13], and the child-sized robot KASPAR [9]
are some examples of different artiﬁcial pets and humanoid
robots designed to engage people based upon relational touch
interactions. This kind of affective interaction is a growing area
of research, especially concerning the target group of people
with special needs.
Tactile data contributes to the determination of the Paro’s
internal state, driving the choice and implementation of a
limited number of hand-coded behaviours, similar to those
of a real seal [14]. Huggable, the robot teddy bear able to
orient itself towards the direction of the human touch through
motion in its neck and shoulders. A soft multi-modal sensory
skin plus the fur covering its entire teddy-bear-shaped body
are able to classify multiple human touch types and perform
tactile interactive behaviours [12]. The robotic cat NeCoRo
is used to analyse personrobot communication, responding
to human voice, movements, and touch. Its multiple sensors,
together with artiﬁcial intelligence technology produce a real-
life-looking robotic cat capable of a playful and natural
communication with humans [13]. KASPAR is a robot that
has been used e.g. in call-and-response games, where its goal
was often to imitate the human partner [9]. In the ROBOSKIN
project, researchers develop a robotic skin to provide tactile
feedback which was added to KASPAR. One goal is to
improve human-robot interaction capabilities in the application
domain of robot-assisted play [15].
III. PROCEDURES
The experiments were performed in four different phases:
familiarisation, pre-test, practice, and post-test (ﬁg. 1).
Figure 1. Phases of the study, in this paper only the pre- and
post-test, and the analysis of the ﬁrst and last session of the
practice phase will be presented
Before starting the experiments with the robot, the children
and the experimenter took part in a familiarisation phase. The
goal of this phase was to get acquainted with the children and
to integrate the experimenter in the school environment. The
experimenter spent one day at the school, in the classroom
where the children normally do their activities. A pre-test
served as baseline to be compared with the results of a post-
test. The task tested in these two phases was the performance
task. The post-test phase had the same conditions of the pre-
test phase in order to evaluate if the children were able to
improve the performance of the task done in the pre-test. In
the practice phase, three different activities were introduced
according to the children’s accomplishment. The next sub-
section presents the different tasks associated with each phase.
Each session with the robot was introduced with a Picture
Exchange Communication System (PECS) card, that the chil-
dren usually use in their daily routine to start new activities.
The PECS card used for this experiment depicted the KASPAR
robot (Figure 2).
A. Tasks
In the performance task, carried out in the pre- and post-
test, the children were asked to choose the right place for
the different body parts, and place them on a drawing of a
little human ﬁgure printed on a cardboard (Figure 3). The

teachers into consideration.

Figure 3. Performance task done in the pre- and post-test
In the practice phase, with 7 sessions of approximately 10
minutes each, there were three different activities, focusing on
body awareness skills. The complexity of the activities was
different, so whenever the children managed to accomplish
the ﬁrst activity, in the next session they would perform
additionally the next more complex activity. If a child did
not manage to progress, more sessions were done with the
basic activity. The evaluation of the right transition moment
to the next level for each child was done by the experimenter
based on the opinion of the teachers. At this stage the robot’s
response was triggered remotely by the experimenter.
• Activity A: The robot identiﬁed one part of its body say-
ing: ”This is my head”. Then, it asked: ”Can you please
show me your head?”. If the answer of the child was
correct, the robot responded with a positive reinforcement
like ”That’s right!” or ”Well Done!”. If the answer was
not correct, the robot encouraged the child to try again,
e. g. ”Almost. Try again!”. The human body parts to be
identiﬁed were: head, tummy, nose, ears, eyes, hands toes,
and mouth.
• Activity B: The robot identiﬁed a sequence of human
body parts on its own body. For example: head and
tummy. Next, it asked the child to point at the same
body parts and in the same sequence on her own body.
Then, the following step was to use three body parts (e.g.,
head, tummy and toes). The same type of reinforcement
of Activity A was used.
• Activity C: This activity involved the learning from the
previous activities together with joint attention and inter-
action with the experimenter. The robot asked the child
to sing together a song about human body parts, and the
experimenter encouraged the child to do the gestures that
accompanied the song. If the child did not have verbal
communication, he was asked to do the same gestures of
experimenter (moving their body parts according to the
song). The song was chosen based on simplicity and the
practical learning approach is normally used in the school
to teach other contents.
B. Participants
The eight participants in the experiments were boys with
ASD aged six to ten years old. Four of the participants were
high-functioning (Group A), the others were low-functioning
(Group B), according to the diagnosis of the children. The
experimenter was in the room to introduce the robot, and to
intervene in case of difﬁculties. She was also involved in the
activity as a facilitator of the interaction, providing guidance
and ensuring that the children did not become agitated or
damage the robot during the activity. A signed informed
consent form was obtained from the parents of each child.
This work was granted ethics approval by the University of
Hertfordshire.
C. Settings
The experiment took place in a familiar room in the school
often used by the children for their activities (Figure 4). The
robot was connected to a laptop and placed on a table in the
centre of the room. The children were sitting or standing facing
the robot.

ipants in the room

The two cameras were placed in such a way that one
recorded the face of the child and the other the experimenter
during the experiments.
D. Touch Feedback
The robot was equipped with 8 FSR sensors positioned on
the right head, left head, right shoulder, left shoulder, right
wrist, left wrist, right hand, left hand, right foot, and left foot
of the robot. These FSRs only distinguished a gentle from
a harsh touch. If the child touched the robot, activating the
sensor below the threshold limit, it answered a sentence such
as ”You are so gentle. Thank you.”. If the child touched the
robot and activated the sensor above the threshold limit, it
answered with a sentence such as ”Ouch, you are hurting me.”.

The threshold limit was deﬁned in experimental pre-tests. The
goal of this feedback is to automatically produce a response to
the children’s tactile interaction, teaching appropriate physical
social engagement, reinforcing suitable behaviours when using
touch to interact with another agent.
E. Evaluation Tools
As a qualitative measure, we used a structured interview. As
quantitative measures, we used questionnaires, a behavioural
analysis, where the children’s behaviours were identiﬁed and
coded with video analysis, and the comparison between the
pre- and post-test.
1) Questionnaires: The questionnaire aimed to measure the
development of children assessing their skills regarding tactile
interaction. The questionnaire was delivered at two different
points during the trials. First, before the trials with the children
to establish a data baseline for each child. Then, the last evalu-
ation was done at the end of the study, to evaluate the changes
in the behaviours of the children. The items were with a 5
point Likert-scale. Three teachers completed the corresponding
questionnaires for the children. For each question, space was
available for comments, providing information not covered by
the response categories. The questions were mainly related to
tactile interaction and the knowledge about body parts, such
as, ’Does the child use his/her hands to explore novel/unknown
objects?’ or ’Can the child point or identify parts of his/her
body in any way?’.
2) Structured Interview: The structured interview was done
with one of the teachers, showing her extracts of the videos
of each child. In this interview, we were interested in the
perspective of the teacher on the children’s behaviours. Mainly,
we wanted to know, how the teacher would describe the
reactions of the children towards the robot and what usual
or unusual behaviours the children showed in the video. Also,
the children’s social behaviour seen in the video was compared
with the behaviour of the children towards teachers and other
children in the classroom (tactile interaction, eye gaze, playing
with others, among others). After discussing this, the main
differences in the children’s behaviour in the two videos were
discussed, as well as whether the robot could have had an
inﬂuence on the speciﬁc behaviours performed by the children.
The interviewed teacher knew only four of the eight children
very well and thus only commented on these. Despite this fact,
we considered her comments very relevant and included them
in this article.
3) Behavioural Analysis: The sessions were examined via
video analysis (using the Observer XT 11 program by Noldus).
The behaviours coded were the following: looking, touching,
following, pointing, imitation, prompts, and identifying body
parts. For each coded behaviour (except for looking) the coders
marked whether the child showed the behaviour spontaneously
or whether the behaviour was prompted by the experimenter.
If the child was, for example, touching the experimenter for no
speciﬁc reason, the behaviour was classiﬁed as spontaneous.
If the child touched the experimenter after the experimenter
said ”Where is my nose?”, the behaviour was classiﬁed as
prompted. A behaviour ended if the child stopped exhibiting
that behaviour or showed another behaviour, directly related
(for example, looking at KASPAR/looking at the experi-
menter). When the child exhibited behaviours that are not
speciﬁed in our list, they were not coded. For eye contact
turning away ended the behaviour. Turning back immediately
and making eye contact again counted as a new behaviour. To
ensure inter-rater reliability 10% of the videos were re-coded
by a second independent coder (Cohen’s kappa k = .63).
4) Comparison between pre- and post-test: When compar-
ing the pre- with the post-test, special attention was paid to
the time taken to accomplish the performance task. Some of
the children needed help to ﬁnish the task, but this help was
only provided when it was veriﬁed that the children were not
able to solve the performance task.
IV. RESULTS
The collected data from the questionnaires, the behavioural
analysis, and the comparison between pre- and post-test were
statistically analysed, and a descriptive evaluation was made
based on the structured interview.
A. Questionnaires
To determine how the responses of the teachers on the
written questionnaires matched for the same questions, we
examined the numerical differences between the responses to
the two sets of questionnaires, using a paired sample t-test.
We found that there were signiﬁcant differences between the
two sets of data regarding the exploration of unknown objects
by the children using their hands (p = 0.033), and the verbal
identiﬁcation of at least one part of the child’s body (p = .033).
In addition, we also discovered that there were signiﬁcant
differences between the ﬁrst and last session, for pointing to
at least one part of their body when asked to do so (p = .011),
and when identifying body parts in any way (p = 0.041).
As comments, teachers added that one child has changed
and that he is now able to listen and understand body parts.
Another child changed to being more focused compared with
his previous state and he was enjoying the body part activities
much more.
B. Structured Interview
The interviewed teacher had prior knowledge about the
robot’s functionalities. During the interview the teacher clas-
siﬁed the following behaviours as improved:
• ”Child 1 held attention for a longer period of time”;
• ”When Child 3 touched KASPAR’s face, he was com-
pletely engaged with the robot. And he was touch-
ing KASPAR’s body parts and face, because he was
happy. KASPAR was deﬁnitely facilitating the interaction
between you [the experimenter] and Child 3, because
he wanted to engage with you [experimenter]. His eye
contact was just amazing.”;
• ”Child 5 was interacting, and I said previously I did not
see him interacting with someone, but today he and Child
1 spoke to each other. And I stopped the lesson, for them
to continue, because they were speaking to each other.”.

C. Behavioural Analysis
To compare the data from the video analysis of the ﬁrst and
the last session we used a paired sample t-test. As mentioned
above, one of the coded behaviours was the direction of the
eye gaze of the children when they were interacting with the
robot. We found signiﬁcant differences, comparing the ﬁrst
and the last session, for the children looking at KASPAR (p
= .001), at the experimenter (p = .004), and elsewhere (p =
.032). The results (Fig. 5) show, that the average time the
children looked at the robot decreased (75.04% - 51.01%),
at the experimenter increased (4.29% - 16.01%) and to no
particular place also increased (20.66% - 32.97%).
Figure 5. Percentage of eye gaze in the ﬁrst and last session
of the Practice Phase
Comparing the Group A (High Functioning) with Group B
(Low Functioning), we found signiﬁcant differences between
the average time Group B looked at KASPAR in the ﬁrst
and in the last session (p = .048). There are no signiﬁcant
differences between the average of time that Group B looked at
the experimenter or elsewhere. The average time the children
in Group B looked at the experimenter increased from 4.32%
to 15.3% group.
In Group A, we found signiﬁcant differences in the average
time of looking at KASPAR (p = .025), at the experimenter
(p = .033), and looking elsewhere (p = .417), comparing the
ﬁrst and the last session. The average time that the children
in Group A looked at the experimenter increased from 16.7%
to 49.4%.
Concerning the tactile interaction of the children in the
ﬁrst and last session, there were no signiﬁcant differences
of the number of times the children touched the robot or
the experimenter, gently (p = .281) or roughly (p = .381).
Despite having no signiﬁcant differences when evaluating
tactile interaction, more than 90% of the times the children
touched the robot gently (Fig. 6).
We video coded the following behaviours: the children
following a pointing gesture with head movement of the
experimenter (following), the children pointing at something
with an index ﬁnger to attract the attention of the experimenter
(pointing), and the children imitating vocalisations or gestures
of KASPAR/experimenter (imitation). There are no signiﬁcant
differences between the ﬁrst and the last session in any of
the interaction parameters (pointing, following, and imitation).
The behaviours that were shown most were imitation and
pointing.
Regarding the success of the children while performing the
Figure 6. Percentage of gentle and rough touches during the
interaction with KASPAR in the ﬁrst and last session of the
Practice Phase
proposed activities Figure 7 shows that the children managed
to complete Activity A more than 70% of the times in both the
ﬁrst and the last session. There were no signiﬁcant differences
between the ﬁrst and the last session.
Figure 7. Percentage of Success of the Activity A in the ﬁrst
and last session of the Practice Phase
D. Comparison between pre- and post-test
When comparing the pre- and post-test there were no
signiﬁcant differences in the time children took to complete
the performance task (p = .365). The average time the children
took was 156 seconds in the pre-test and 124 seconds in post-
test. 75% of the children managed to perform the task in less
time in the post-test than in the pre-test.
V. DISCUSSION
We observed that from the ﬁrst session with KASPAR to
the last, children directed their eye gaze increasingly less
towards KASPAR. Instead the time they spent looking at the
experimenter and at no particular place increased. The latter
can be explained with the familiarisation of the children with
the situation, but looking four times longer at the experimenter
can be interpreted as KASPAR successfully functioning as
social mediator. Comparing Group A and Group B, we found
that the results follow the trend of the entire group. Despite
the increase in time the children in Group B looked at the
experimenter, they did so only 15% of the time in the last
session. In Group A on the other hand this time increased up
to almost 50% of the last session. The difference between
the two groups show that children at the high functioning
end of the autistic spectrum are much more attentive to the
social partners face then children at the low functioning end. In
both groups this attentiveness seemed to have been promoted
by the activity with KASPAR. An increasing familiarity with

the experimenter could be an alternative explanation of these
results, which nevertheless would be a desirable outcome of
the triadic interaction between the robot, the experimenter and
the child.
The fact that the difference between the ﬁrst and the last
session regarding the tactile interaction of the children with
KASPAR was not signiﬁcant, could have different reasons.
One explanation could be that all the children were even in
the ﬁrst session gentle in more then 90% of their tactile inter-
actions. This by itself is interesting, since the teachers reported
that this initial gentleness was surprising to them. Based on
this descriptive quantitative data it is possible to argue that
the exposure of the children to the interactive situation with
KASPAR already induced a more careful behaviour. However
a more detailed evaluation of the tactile data from all sessions
is needed to understand how the children interact with the
robot.
Even without analysing quantitatively the number of times
that the children performed interaction behaviours (pointing,
following, and imitating), it is interesting to notice that imita-
tion is the most pronounced behaviour. Previous studies with
KASPAR [17] show that children on the high functioning end
of the spectrum are able to imitate KASPAR’s movements, and
that it was easier for them to imitate and understand the partial
movement of the body of KASPAR than the total movement
of IROMEC, a mobile robotic platform. This indicates that
KASPAR can be useful to facilitate interaction behaviours.
According to the data from the interview and the ques-
tionnaires some of the children that initially were not able
to identify any of the body parts on themselves, showed an
improvement on their knowledge. The teachers also indicated
that the children transferred some of the knowledge learned
during the sessions with KASPAR to the classroom. They gave
in general very positive feedback
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper presents a study in which children with autism
interacted with a humanoid robot. The children learned about
body parts and at the same time the robot was equipped to
respond accordingly to tactile interaction from the children.
We wanted to test whether the robot could facilitate the inter-
action between the child and another person in the experiment,
and to acquire knowledge about human body parts. Another
point of interest was to see if the robot could help children
with ASD to learn appropriate physical social engagement.
Our results show that from the ﬁrst to the last session with
the robot, the children increased the time they looked at the
experimenter. An evaluation by teachers of the children shows,
that they improved the ability to identify parts of the their
body with their own hands. Additionally, some of the children
that initially were not able to identify any of the body parts
on themselves, showed an improvement of their knowledge. In
this paper we used a robot to enable the learning of body parts
by children with autism and due to the novelty of the topic, we
wanted to construct and test different scenarios in this respect.
A more detailed analysis of the data is still ongoing and will
enable with a better interpretation of the ﬁndings. Due to the
preliminary nature of the data analysis, no causal conclusions
can be drawn at this point. It is necessary to point out that it is,
due to the school environment design of the study, not possible
to exclude that any observed improvements could be due to
other activities at school or at home. Further research is needed
to conﬁrm the extent in which the robot was instrumental in
causing these changes.
