Abstract‚ÄîRegarding indoor location estimation, many smart
positioning techniques have been proposed and they could be
classiÔ¨Åed into several categories. Fingerprinting is one of the
categories and its features are to build the indoor radio map
during ofÔ¨Çine phase and to utilize the radio map to estimate the
location during online phase. Creating indoor radio map is the
most critical step, where the accuracy of location estimation de-
pends on the distribution and number of reference points (RPs).
Usually, the time required to collect received signal strengths
(RSSs) is proportional to the number of ‚Äôreal‚Äô RPs. To reduce
the complexity of ofÔ¨Çine process, this paper proposes an efÔ¨Åcient
scheme, which is based on the well-known signal propagation
model, to construct ‚Äôvirtual‚Äô RPs in indoor radio map. The RSSs
on virtual RPs are calculated and used to substitute for the
training RSSs on ‚Äôreal‚Äô RPs collected during ofÔ¨Çine phase. The
proposed scheme can not only shorten the collecting time but also
achieve high accuracy for indoor positioning. The indoor location
estimation using smart antenna system (SAS) also requires longer
time to collect all RSS information because of multiple antennas.
By combining this scheme with SAS, we can easily obtain enough
and valid RSSs information to build the indoor radio map in a
more efÔ¨Åcient way. Experimental results showed that applying
virtual Ô¨Ångerprint construction scheme on SAS can decrease 33%
‚Äôreal‚Äô RPs in indoor radio map without sacriÔ¨Åcing the positioning
accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, indoor location estimation is very important for
many contemporary location-based services, such as health
care monitoring, indoor navigation, personal tracking, inven-
tory control, and so on. Without Global Positioning System
(GPS) in indoor environment, there are many alternative tech-
niques have been proposed [1][2] and they could be classify
into several categories including Time of Arrival (ToA), Angle
of Arrival (AoA) and the RSS-based location [3][4][5]. There
are two reason why ToA and AoA are unsuitable for indoor
environments: 1) they require the line-of-sight (LOS) between
a pair of transmitter and receiver and 2) the special hardware
design to support ToA and AoA algorithms is expensive.
RADAR [6] is the Ô¨Årst explored indoor positioning system,
which computes the user location based on the RSS [7][8]
from wireless local area network (WLAN). It is an attractive
and suitable solution for indoor positioning since it reuses the
existing and pervasive WLAN infrastructure. However, RSS-
based location estimation is challenging because the radio
signal is easily affected by reÔ¨Çection, refraction, shadowing
and scattering. To resolve the problem of unstable RSSs in
indoor environment, Ô¨Ångerprinting is considered as a feasible
solution. Using the Ô¨Ångerprint technique with smart antenna
system (SAS), which uses multi-antenna to form several
logical APs with different radio coverage areas, three major
processes for location estimation are required: 1) building the
indoor radio map, 2) logical AP selection and 3) location
estimation. The Ô¨Ångerprint technique consists of the ofÔ¨Çine
phase and the online phase. During the ofÔ¨Çine phase, the
target indoor area is logically partitioned into a number of
equal subareas. For simplicity, all the corners of subareas
could be arranged as the reference points (RPs) in indoor
radio map. After then, a smart phone is placed on every RP
to transmit a number of dummy packets to every logical AP
co-located within the centric SAS. For each dummy packet,
the SAS measures the RSS and stores it with the coordinate of
corresponding RP and the index of logical AP into the database
in designated server. During the online phase, SAS measures
the RSSs of received packets sent from one mobile device
at unknown position and then forwards them to designated
server for further processing. Based on these received RSSs,
the server calculates the possible position of mobile device
by means of online location algorithm. The estimated location
may either fully match or just closely match an RP in database.
Without loss of generality, the online location algorithm
often relies on well-known pattern-matching algorithms in-
cluding the k-nearest neighbor [1], neural network, the prob-
abilistic approach [9], and so on. In other words, the pattern-
matching algorithm tries to Ô¨Ågure out the possible location
according to the known relation between the RSS and the po-
sition of mobile device. From our observations, the weighted-
based kernel function, which has been proposed in [10], to
improve the indoor positioning accuracy is very suitable for
SAS-based online location estimation.

The architecture of smart antenna system
Recall that constructing radio map is the most critical step,
where the accuracy of location estimation depends on the
number of RPs. Obviously, the process of collecting RSSs
often takes much time as there are many real RPs in radio
map. To reduce the complexity of ofÔ¨Çine process, this paper
proposes an efÔ¨Åcient scheme, which utilizes the signal propa-
gation model, to construct virtual RPs in radio map. Those
calculated RSSs on virtual RPs are treated as the training
data on real RPs. The proposed scheme not only shortens the
RSS collecting time but also achieves high accuracy for indoor
positioning. Similarly, using SAS to estimate indoor location
also requires longer time to collect all RSS information.
Combining this scheme with SAS has the advantage of easily
obtaining enough RSSs information to build the radio map in
a more efÔ¨Åcient way.
The organization of this paper is described as follows. In
Section II, we introduce the developed SAS for indoor location
estimation. Section III is devoted to the proposed scheme
of efÔ¨Åciently constructing the radio map and the applied
indoor estimation algorithm. In Section IV, we describe the
experimental environment and the obtained results. Finally,
Section V concludes this paper and also gives some remarks
for future works.
II. INTRODUCTION OF SMART ANTENNA SYSTEM
Smart antenna system is an emerging technique to promote
the communication efÔ¨Åciency in wireless networks. It works
by taking the advantage of the diversity effect at the transceiver
in wireless systems. The diversity effect is used to decrease
the error rate during data communication and to increase data
transmission rate between transmitter and receiver.
The SAS designed for indoor location estimation is com-
posed of eight directional antennas which are divided into hor-
izontal plane (with horizontal polarization) and vertical plane
(with vertical polarization). Each plane has four antennas to
cover four different directions, one antenna for one direction.
The SAS generates 16 (4√ó4) distinct antenna sets by combin-
ing any pairs of antennas from two planes, where one antenna
from horizontal plane and the other antenna from vertical
plane. As a result, those antenna sets have different signal cov-
erage and trajectory to provide a better characteristic for indoor
location estimation. For brevity, in this paper the antenna set
is called as ‚Äôlogical AP‚Äô ,which represents for the traditional
AP from the aspect of WLAN client. The block diagram

of SAS is shown in Fig. 1(a)[13]. The embedded platform
includes a programmable 2 √ó 2 IEEE 802.11n Media Access
Control (MAC) Controller and it uses 8 general purposes I/Os
(GPIOs ) to connect to two switches for dynamically selecting
2 antennas from 8 antennas (one from horizontal plane and
one from vertical plane) for transmissions and receptions. The
state of the switch is determined by the DC voltage. The RF
output connects with the designed antenna array on the circle
plate as shown in Fig. 1(b)[13]. In the antenna array, four
antennas, denoted as ANT A, ANT B, ANT C, and ANT D,
respectively, are formed an angle 90 degree with respect to the
other four antennas, denoted as ANT E, ANT F, ANT G,
and ANT H, respectively. Fig. 2[13] is the photograph of
smart antenna system and Table I[13] shows the conÔ¨Åguration
between the index of antenna set and corresponding antennas
controlled by MAC controller. For readability, terms ‚Äôlogical
AP‚Äô and ‚Äôantenna set‚Äô are interchangeable.
III. SMART INDOOR LOCATION ESTIMATION
If the indoor signal propagation model is able to derive
the precise path loss, the RSSs on any RP in indoor envi-
ronment could be obtained without any actual measurement.
However, from our observations, it is very difÔ¨Åcult to use
a signal propagation model with single pass loss parameter
set to cover the whole indoor environment. That is why the
convenient way to achieve more precise indoor positioning
is to arrange as more RPs as possible regardless of the
signal propagation model. However, because the SAS aims
to generate distinct antenna patterns in different directions,
the path loss parameters for different antenna sets would be
naturally varied even in the same indoor environment. In other
words, if an RP in the indoor radio map can have different path

The real RSS values derived from measurements
loss parameters to reÔ¨Çect different antenna patterns, the indoor
signal propagation model could be applicable for Ô¨Ångerprint-
based indoor location estimation. It also implies that the
number of real RPs for building indoor radio map could be
reduced signiÔ¨Åcantly. In a word, the way of increasing the RPs
in this paper is to utilize the real measurements from real RPs
to generate virtual measurements of other new RPs, called
virtual RPs, in database for shortening the ofÔ¨Çine process
meanwhile maintaining high positioning accuracy.
A. Location Estimation Algorithm
At the beginning, we simply assume RSS values are random
variables and they could be modeled as a Gaussian distribu-
tion. The whole location process is composed of two phases.
The ofÔ¨Çine phase is to build the radio map which is the key
part for the Ô¨Ångerprint technique. As mentioned above, with
the signal propagation model, we are going to further generate
more virtual RPs in radio map for online computation.
We divide ofÔ¨Çine phase into two steps: 1) constructing the
radio map which stores RSS values from 16 antenna sets (i.e.,
16 logical APs) at every real RP and 2) performing the logical
AP selection to Ô¨Ånd a proper candidate set of logical APs
for online location estimation. This set could be regarded as
the basis for subsequent online computation. Online phase is
also composed of two steps: 1) collecting RSS values from
the logical APs in candidate set at unknown location, and 2)
estimating the user location based on the RSS values from
logical APs in candidate set and the radio map prepared during
ofÔ¨Çine phase.
B. Probabilistic-based Location Estimation
1)
Scheme of Virtual Fingerprint Construction: Generally,
the relation between signal strength and distance can be
expressed by the following equation:
P(d)[dBm] = P(d0)[dBm] + 10Œ≥ log10( d
d0
) + XœÉ
(1)
where P(d0) represents the transmitting power of a wire-
less device at the reference distance d0, d is the distance
between the wireless device and the SAS, Œ≥ is the path

The Index of Antenna Set
Fig. 4.
The virtual RSS values generated from signal propagation model
loss exponent and XœÉ is the shadow fading which follows
zero mean Gaussian distribution with œÉ standard deviation.
To Ô¨Ågure out d0 and d, we should deÔ¨Åne dAP (R)
=
‚àö
(XR ‚àí XAP )2 + (YR ‚àí YAP )2 as the distance between
smart antenna AP and the real RP, where (XAP , YAP ) and
(XR, YR) denote the coordinates of smart antenna AP and a
real RP respectively.
Owing to the diverse radio Ô¨Åeld pattern and trajectory in
SAS, each antenna set should have its own distinct value of
path loss parameter. For the case that the SAS is located in
the center within the target area, we can easily Ô¨Ågure out the
path loss exponent (Œ≥) for each antenna set by two real RPs
and then use it to generate new RPs in the radio map. Let m
denote the index of antenna set and Œ≥m denote the path loss
exponent of the m-th antenna set. More speciÔ¨Åcally, we Ô¨Årst
carefully choose two real RPs (along one radiation direction)
from the radio map and then calculate the path loss exponent
of every antenna set. After deriving all the path loss exponents
(i.e., the set of { Œ≥1, Œ≥2, ..., Œ≥16 }), the RSSs of a new virtual
RP with speciÔ¨Åed distance to SAS are derivable. Afterward,
the virtual RP and corresponding RSSs are added into the
radio map. Fig. 3 shows the real RSS values derived from
measurements at a certain RP and Fig. 4 shows the virtual
RSS values generated by the proposed virtual Ô¨Ångerprint
construction scheme. From these two Ô¨Ågures, it reveals that
the virtual RP indeed has similar radio characteristic compared
with the actual measurements.
In this paper, we let N denote as the number of total RPs
for online computation and NR and NV respectively represent
the numbers of real RPs and RPs in the database. In this paper,
we let NR = 24 and N = 36, which indicates that there are
12 virtual RPs (NV =12) in the database.
2) The Algorithm of Antenna Set Selection: For some loca-
tions, the measured RSSs from one logical AP might be similar
to the other logical AP. Such similarity will lead to biased
location estimation and redundant computations. Therefore,
it is important of using antenna set selective technique to
determine a proper candidate set of logical APs for location
estimation.
The selection methodology is to choose a set of logical APs
283

with the highest correlation of RSSs. Therefore, the highest
correlation of RSS could provide the highest probability of
coverage over time [11]. It is worthwhile to notice that the
logical APs with the strongest signal with respect to WLAN
client may not provide the best positioning accuracy [12].
Here, we brieÔ¨Çy introduce the weighted-based kernel func-
tion [10] and explain how to calculate the weighted values for
the SAS. First, the information of each logical AP is quantiÔ¨Åed
by calculating the signal discrimination between different RPs.
Let ¬Øom denote the mean value of RSSs obtained from the m-th
antenna set. We have
¬Øom =
1
N ¬∑ Nrssi
N
‚àë
i=1
Nrssi
‚àë
j=1
oi,m(j),
(2)
where N, Nrssi, and oi,m(j) represent the total number of
RPs, the number of collected RSSs at every RP and the j-th
(1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ Nrssi) collected RSS at the i-th (1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ N) RP
obtained from the m-th (1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ M) logical AP, respectively.
Therefore, the information of the m-th logical AP denoted as
Œ∑m is given by
Œ∑m =
1
N ¬∑ Nrssi
N
‚àë
i=1
Nrssi
‚àë
j=1
(oi,m(j) ‚àí ¬Øom).
(3)
It is noted that the RSS does not change signiÔ¨Åcantly at
different RPs if Œ∑m is small. On the contrary, the higher value
of Œ∑m reveals that the RSSs varies obviously at different RPs.
To obtain a quantitative metric by calculating the spatial
likelihood of the measured RSSs, a quasi entropy function
denoted as H(¬∑) is used to determine the weight œñm. We
have
œñm = 1 +
H(1 ‚àí Œ∑‚àó
m)
max [H(1 ‚àí Œ∑‚àóm)],
if 0 < m ‚â§ M,
(4)
where Œ∑‚àó
m =
Œ∑m
‚àëM
m=1 Œ∑m and M indicate the normalized value
and the number of logical APs respectively. The value of
weight ranges from 1 to 2. The weighted value œñm is related
with the value Œ∑m.
[13] has shown that the order of Œ∑m
does not affect the positioning accuracy in SAS. Therefore,
the weighted value œñm could be ignored in SAS.
3) Online Location Estimation: This paper adopts the the-
orem of Bayesian Network [14] to estimate the conditional
probability of each location according to the observed samples
during the ofÔ¨Çine and online phases.
Let li and Oi denote the location of the i-th RP and the
mean RSS observation set of the i-th RP respectively. The
vector of RSS values for the i-th logical AP could be denoted
as Oi = [Oi,1, Oi,2, . . . , Oi,M]T . According to the inference
form [15], given the observation O, the posterior distribution
indicates the likelihood of location li. We have
p(li|O) = p(O|li)p(li)
p(O)
= C ¬∑ p(O|li),
(5)
where C indicates a constant value when the value of li fol-
lows a uniform distribution and and O is the online measured
RSS. To estimate p(O|li), the kernel-based method [9][16]

IV. EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT AND RESULTS
A. Experimental Environment
Fig. 5 illustrates the layout of the indoor radio map, where
the red nodes represent the real RPs and the yellow nodes
represent the virtual RPs which are not really measured. The
dash circles mean the radio wave contours generated from the
SAS in the center and the dash line delegates how to use
real RPs to derive the virtual RPs according to the signal
propagation model. More speciÔ¨Åcally, a dash line always
crosses two red nodes (i.e., real RPs) and one yellow node
(i.e., virtual RP), and the yellow node just locates between two
red nodes. It means that the new data of the yellow node is
constructed within the range of known data of two red nodes
by means of interpolation method. For applying the signal
propagation equation, we need to have two distances (d and
d0) with respect to centric AP and two RSS values (P(d), and
P(d0)) per logical AP to derive the real path loss exponent
Œ≥m of the m logical AP. To do that, we need two real RPs
for constructing every virtual RP. For the sake of explanation,
we use the virtual RP, say V1, as an example to explain how
the scheme uses two real RPs, say R1 and R10, to generate
virtual RP, V1. Because the distances between AP and real RPs
(R1 and R10) and the sixteen mean RSSs of sixteen logical
APs measured at real RPs (R1 and R10) are known, the path
loss exponent Œ≥m of the m-th logical AP along the path from
R10 to R1 is known also. By simply replacing the real RP
R1 as virtual RP V1, the sixteen mean RSSs of sixteen logical
APs probably measured at virtual RP V1 can be derived if the
sixteen path loss exponents are known already.

The set of experimental parameters is shown in Table II.
The number of real RPs (NR) is 24 and the number of virtual
RPs (NV ) in radio map is 12. These virtual RPs play the role
of real RPs. Consequently, the number of total RPs N is 36.
B. Experimental Results
Fig. 6 shows the path loss exponent Œ≥ as a function
of virtual RP and logical AP. It can be observed that the
path loss exponents are somehow different in the considered
indoor space because of the diversity effect of SAS. As
a consequence, the constructed RSSs of a virtual RP are
depending on the location and they are different from that
of the others. Fig. 7 indicates the numerical result that depicts
the accuracy (in percentage) and standard deviation of error
(in meter) respectively derived from the methods with and
without applying the virtual Ô¨Ångerprint construction scheme.
For fair comparisons, the numbers of real RPs considered in
the method without the virtual Ô¨Ångerprint construction scheme
are 36 (denoted as 36 RRP ) and 24 (denoted as 24 RRP ),
and the numbers of real RPs and the number of virtual
RPs considered in the method with the virtual Ô¨Ångerprint
construction scheme is 24 and 12 (denoted as 24 RRP + 12
VRP ). It is not difÔ¨Åcult to Ô¨Ånd that using more RPs in location
estimation will result in a higher accuracy and lower standard
deviation of error in Fig. 7. That is, the method using only
24 real RPs gets the lowest performance in terms of accuracy
and standard deviation of error. Moreover, the performance of
the method using 24 real RPs and 12 virtual RPs is very close
to the method using 36 real RPs. It implies that the proposed
virtual Ô¨Ångerprint construction scheme can perform as good
as conventional method but consuming less overhead during
ofÔ¨Çine phase.
Fig. 8 illustrates the positioning accuracy derived from the
method with the virtual Ô¨Ångerprint construction scheme (24
RRP + 12 VRP ) as a function of the number of logical APs
in candidate set. The more bright areas represent more precise
indoor positioning. From Fig. 8(d), we can Ô¨Ånd that, when
sixteen logical APs of the SAS are included in the candidate
set, the proposed scheme can obtain the best positioning
accuracy level. It implies that the antenna diversity effect of
developed SAS is very obvious, which is very useful for indoor
location estimation.

V. CONCLUSIONS
To realize the Ô¨Ångerprint-based indoor location estimation,
the ofÔ¨Çine radio map construction is deÔ¨Ånitely essential for
the performance. Generally, this process requires a lot of
time to gather training data from a considerable amount
of reference points. In this paper, we proposed a virtual
Ô¨Ångerprint construction scheme to shorten the ofÔ¨Çine process
by means of reducing the number of real reference points in
radio map. More precisely, the vanished reference points are
automatically recovered by applying the signal propagation
model. Experimental results show that, the smart antenna
system with the proposed scheme can easily generate the
valid virtual RPs which have very similar characteristic of
radio signals as the measured ones. Experimental results also
reveal that the proposed scheme is workable in realistic indoor
environment and the virtual Ô¨Ångerprint construction scheme
can reduce 33% (12/36) real RPs during the ofÔ¨Çine phase.
The concept behind the virtual Ô¨Ångerprint construction
scheme is the interpolation method. Our future work is to use
the extrapolation method on the virtual Ô¨Ångerprint construction
scheme to build unlimited indoor radio map with very small
amount of real reference points.
