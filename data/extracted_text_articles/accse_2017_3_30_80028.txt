Abstract—Distributed Denial of Service attacks are getting
more sophisticated and frequent whereas the required technical
knowledge to perform these attacks decreases. The reason is that
Distributed Denial of Service attacks are offered as a service,
namely Booters, for less than 10 US dollars. As Booters offer
a Distributed Denial of Service service that is paid, Booters
often make use of Transport Layer Security certiﬁcates to
appear trusted and hide themselves inside of encrypted trafﬁc
in order to evade detection and bypass critical security controls.
In addition, Booters use Transport Layer Security certiﬁcates
to ensure secure credit card transactions, data transfer and
logins for their customers. In this article, we review Booters
websites and their use of Secure Socket Layer certiﬁcates. In
particular, we analyze the certiﬁcate chain, the used cryptography
and cipher suites, protocol use within Transport Layer Security
for purpose of security parameters negotiation, the issuer, the
validity of the certiﬁcate and the hosting companies. Our main
ﬁnding is that Booters prefer elliptic curve cryptography and
are using Advanced Encryption Standard with a 128 bit key
in Galois/Counter Mode. Further, we found a typical certiﬁcate
chain used by most of the Booters.

I. INTRODUCTION
Over the last years, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attacks remain the top threat responsible for infrastructure
and service outages [1]. The reason is that DDoS attacks
are getting more sophisticated and more frequent whereas
the required technical knowledge to perform these attacks
decreases. One possibility to launch DDoS attacks is offered to
non-technical users by websites referred to as Booters [2][3].
A user accesses a Booter website and chooses an attack plan
that deﬁnes a number of attacks with a maximum attack
duration each within a maximum period of time (expiration
time) [4]. After the selection of an attack plan, the customer
request is forwarded to a payment system (e.g., PayPal,
BitCoin and credit card), which notiﬁes the Booter when
the amount of money is paid. This notiﬁcation unblocks the
customer and allows the customer to perform as many attacks
as he/she wants in accordance to the attack plan. Besides the
simplicity to buy and launch DDoS attacks against anyone
on the Internet, Booters also use Transport Layer Security
(TLS) to hide their attacks, evade detection, and bypass critical
security controls [5][6]. In addition, Booters also secure their
credit card transactions, data transfer and logins using TLS
certiﬁcates in order to protect their customers.
The main intention of the TLS protocol and the Public
Key Infractructure (PKI) is to give customers the conﬁdence
to complete their transactions using several trust indicators.
However, the TLS protocol did not originally include the
provision of a validated business identity within the TLS
certiﬁcate and, as a result, the role of the Certiﬁcation Au-
thority (CA) is to pass trust. Moreover, CAs should have a
responsibility to ensure they only ever issue TLS certiﬁcates
to legitimate companies. As opposed to this, Booters that
use a TLS certiﬁcate to secure their Internet transactions are
intended to generate harmful trafﬁc against a target system.
In this paper, we review the use of TLS certiﬁcates of
current Booters. Further, we analyze the characteristics of
the used of TLS certiﬁcates (e.g., certiﬁcate chain, used
cryptography and cipher suites, negotiation protocol, issuer
and the validity of the certiﬁcate). To summarize, our con-
tributions are as follows: i) We identify and classify the used
TLS certiﬁcates of Booters and generalize potential malicious
certiﬁcate chains; ii) We study in detail the characteristics of
the used TLS certiﬁcates (e.g., used cryptography and cipher
suites, negotiation protocol, issuer and the validity of the
certiﬁcate) and uncover same Booter infrastructures; iii) We
discuss strategies to mitigate Booters using TLS certiﬁcates.
II. BOOTERS AND SSL CERTIFICATES
In this section, we provide a general overview of Booters
using TLS certiﬁcates. First, we deﬁne the terminology that
is used throughout this paper and describe the methodology
to retrieve the TLS certiﬁcate. Second, we provide informa-
tion regarding the certiﬁcate chain, the used cryptography
and cipher suites, protocol use within TLS for purpose of
security parameters negotiation, the issuer and the validity
of the certiﬁcate. We aim to shed light onto the typical TLS
conﬁguration parameters of Booter websites and discuss our
ﬁndings in terms of mitigation and response to DDoS attacks.
A. Terminology
The analysis of Booter websites has revealed that there
are various terms used to describe websites that offer DDoS-
as-a-Service. Namely, Booters websites are also known as

Stressers, DDoS-for-hire, DDoS-as-a-Service, and DDoSers
[4]. In this paper, we adhere to the term Booter and refer
to the infrastructure of a Booter presented in [4].
Further, we adhere to the deﬁnition of a CA by [7]: ”A
certiﬁcation authority is a general designation for any entity
that controls the authentication services and the management
of certiﬁcates. A CA can be public commercial, private or
personal. CAs are independent and deﬁne an Certiﬁcation
Practice Statement (CPS).”
B. Methodology
First, we monitor the landscape of Booter websites that lis-
ten to HyperText Transport Protocol Secure (HTTPS) requests
and reply with a TLS certiﬁcate to secure their Internet transac-
tions based on the Booterblacklist [8]. To connect to a Booter
website, we ﬁrst used the TLS client program s_client
of OpenSSL. However, we found that the OpenSSL pro-
gram s_client is not always able to extract and store
the certiﬁcate chain of an existing connection. To overcome
missing certiﬁcate chains, we developed two different TLS
client programs and performed a TLS handshake [9] as shown
in Figure 1. The reason to develop two different TLS client
programs is that the Booters website presents different TLS
certiﬁcates during the SSL handshake based on the use of
the Server Name Indication (SNI) Extension of SSL [10].
Therefore, one TLS client program makes use of the SNI
Extension and the other program works without. We stored the
cipher suits, TLS version, the Booters public key certiﬁcate
and its certiﬁcate chain, and the Subject Alternative Name
(SAN) ﬁeld [11]. In addition to the TLS data, we used whois
to query all domain name entries within the SAN ﬁeld of the
certiﬁcates to gather information about the hoster of the Booter
websites.
Figure 2. Certiﬁcate chain and linkages between certiﬁcates [13].
C. The use of TLS certiﬁcates by Booter websites
Out of 434 Booters, 152 replied with a TLS certiﬁcate. Even
though this amount is signiﬁcantly less than the usage of TLS
certiﬁcate authorities for the top 10 million websites presented
in [12] (e.g., W3Techs [12] reported that 67.4% of the websites
currently use TLS certiﬁcates), Gartner believes that by 2017
more than 50% of the network attacks will use SSL encryption
[5]. As a result, the number of Booters that use TLS might
also increase [6] .
1) Depth of TLS certiﬁcate chain: As described in [11],
TLS certiﬁcates are built in a top down process. First, the self-
signed Root CA certiﬁcate is established [13]. Next, the Root
CA signs an intermediate CA certiﬁcate. This intermediate
CA either create an additional intermediate CA or issues a
certiﬁcate to people or hosts. To establish a valid certiﬁcate
chain at least one CA is required. [13] reported that there is
no theoretical maximum of certiﬁcate chains, but the average
certiﬁcate chains have between two and three CAs in the
hierarchy. The depth count is ”level 0:peer certiﬁcate”, ”level
1: CA certiﬁcate”, ”level 2: higher level CA certiﬁcate”, and
so on. The last certiﬁcate is called Root certiﬁcate. In contrast
to the process of building TLS certiﬁcates, the validation of
TLS certiﬁcates is a bottom up approach. Both the building
and veriﬁcation process are shown in Figure 2. On average,
Booter websites have a depth count of 4.
2) Geographic Distribution of TLS certiﬁcates: We ex-
amined the geographic distribution of the host, intermediate
and root TLS certiﬁcates by using the subject and issuer
two-letter International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
country code and compared our ﬁndings with [2]. Our ﬁndings
revealed a similar distribution of the top 10 two-letter ISO
country code of the certiﬁcate’s subject and issuer as reported
by [2]. The top ranked country that issues TLS certiﬁcates to
Booter websites is Sweden, followed by Great Britain. The
geographical distribution of the TLS certiﬁcate by subject and
issuer country is listed in Table I and shown in Figure 3.
Surprisingly, the majority (74.59%) of the Booter websites that
use TLS certiﬁcates provide the country code of the certiﬁcate
subject and issuer. In addition to Table I, 10 certiﬁcates did
not provide information about the subject and issuer country.
Even though the country code is missing, the TLS certiﬁcate
is still valid as the country name attribute is optional [11].
3) Types of TLS certiﬁcates: Besides self-signed certiﬁ-
cates, currently three types of commercial TLS certiﬁcates

are available: Domain Validated (DV), Organization Validated
(OV) and Extended Validation (EV).
The DV SSL certiﬁcate is the most common type of
TLS certiﬁcate. The CA veriﬁes only the domain name and
typically exchanges conﬁrmation email with an address listed
in the domain’s WHOIS record. DV certiﬁcates are typically
veriﬁed and issued through automated processes. Human inter-
vention is minimized and organization checks are eliminated
in order to support issuing certiﬁcates in a quick and cheap
manner. While the browser displays a padlock, examination
of the certiﬁcate will not show the company name as this was
not validated. All Booters listed on the Booter blacklist that
respond to an HTTPs request make use of DV TLS certiﬁcates.
In contrast to DV certiﬁcates, CAs must validate the com-
pany name, domain name and other information through the
use of public databases when issuing an OV certiﬁcate. The
issued certiﬁcate will contain the company name and the
domain name, for which the certiﬁcate was issued for. None
of our Booter websites that use TLS certiﬁcates to secure their
Internet transactions make use of a OV certiﬁcate.
The purpose of an EV certiﬁcate is to identify the legal
entity that controls a website and to assist in addressing prob-
lems related to phishing, malware, and other forms of online
identity fraud. An EV certiﬁcate is only issued once an entity
passes a strict authentication procedure. The Guidelines for the
Issuance and Management of Extended Validation Certiﬁcates
[14] present criteria established by the CA/Browser Forum for
use by certiﬁcation authorities when issuing, maintaining, and
revoking certain digital certiﬁcates for use in Internet website
commerce. As in the OV, the EV lists the company name in
the certiﬁcate itself. However, a fully validated EV certiﬁcate
will also show the name of the company or organization
in the address bar itself, and the address bar is displayed

provided (e.g., address of Place of Business, Jurisdiction of
Incorporation or Registration and Registration Number).
4) Certiﬁcate chain: In this section, we analyze the cer-
tiﬁcate chain of the TLS certiﬁcates used by the Booter
websites. We found 585 TLS certiﬁcates used by 152 Booter
websites as host, intermediate or root certiﬁcate issued by
17 different organizations. We recognized the occurrence of
similar certiﬁcate chains and built an overview of relationships
between CAs and their TLS certiﬁcates.
In a ﬁrst step, we analyzed the root certiﬁcates and trusted
CAs. At least for the European context, an EU Trusted Lists
of Certiﬁcation Service Providers is available. We compared
the root certiﬁcates used by the Booter websites with the CAs
listed on the EU Trusted List [15]. We assumed to ﬁnd the
majority of the root certiﬁcates used by Booter websites on
the EU Trusted List as the geolocation revealed Great Britain
and Sweden the top issuer countries as shown in Figure 3.
However, the organization names of the root certiﬁcates of
the Booter websites are not listed on the EU Trusted List of
Certiﬁcation Service Providers.
To answer the question of who is issuing the TLS certiﬁcates
used by Booter websites, we built an overview of relationships
between CAs and their TLS certiﬁcates as shown in Figure 4.
The majority of the Booters intermediate and root certiﬁcates
are issued by Comodo CA Limited and AddTrust AB.
However, AddTrust AB no longer exists as a company [16].
After ScandTrust, a private Swedish CA, acquired AddTrust
AB, Comodo CA Limited purchased the AddTrust root cer-
tiﬁcates from ScandTrust [16]. Further, Comodo CA Limited
also purchased the CA UserTrust [17], which had four roots
[16]. As reported by [16], the key material was removed from
its original sites of operation and transferred into Comodo’s
data and backup centers.
The next higher amount of TLS certiﬁcates are issued by
organizations belonging to the Symantec Group. In 2000,
Thawte was acquired by Symantec [18]. In the year 2006,
VeriSign acquired GeoTrust [19] and bought the certiﬁcates
from them. In 2010, Symantec acquired VeriSign’s identity
and authentication business for 1.28 billion US dollar [20] and
thus owns the TLS and code signing certiﬁcate services, the
managed public key infrastructure services, the VeriSign trust
seal, the VeriSign identity protection authentication service and
the VIP fraud detection service.
As a response to occurring security incidents in the past,
some CAs are sold. Even though CAs are sold and their key
material is transferred to other CAs, each of the hundreds of
39

ACCSE 2017 : The Second International Conference on Advances in Computation, Communications and Services

different root CAs are equally trusted by the browsers [21].
5) Costs of SSL certiﬁcates: The costs of a TLS certiﬁcate
depend on the type of the certiﬁcate, the value of the used
intermediate and root CAs within the certiﬁcate chain and the
reputation of the issuing CA.
As described in Section II-C3, the three types of commercial
TLS certiﬁcates DV, OV and EV are available. The cheapest
certiﬁcate is a DV certiﬁcate (e.g., starting from $8.95 for a
single domain and $98 for multiple domains), followed by the
OV certiﬁcate (e.g., starting from $38 for a single domain
and $180 for multiple domains). The most expensive TLS
certiﬁcate is EV (e.g., starting from $99 for a single domain
and $269 for multiple domains), because an applying entity
has to pass strict authentication procedures.
In recent years, incidents with CAs that issued bogus TLS
certiﬁcate have been published and discussed. In 2008, Eddy
Nigg ordered an SSL certiﬁcate for Mozilla.com on CertStar’s
site without having to go through any validation or verify
that he was authorized to order the certiﬁcate [22][23]. In the
year 2011, a Comodo afﬁliate RA was compromised resulting
in the fraudulent issue of 9 SSL certiﬁcates to sites in 7
domains [24][25]. Later in 2011, the DigiNotar CA detected
an intrusion into its CA infrastructure, which resulted in the
fraudulent issuance of 531 public key certiﬁcate requests for
a number of domains, including Google.com [26][27]. In
2015, Microsoft revoked an improperly issued SSL certiﬁcate
for the domain live.fi that could be used in attempts to
spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform man-in-
the-middle attacks [28][29].
In most of the aforementioned cases, the involved CA that
issued bogus TLS certiﬁcates have been sold or dissolved and
their key material has been transferred to different parties. The
acquiring organization recognized the lower value of such a
CA, offer these TLS certiﬁcates to third party vendors that sell
these at a cheaper cost as the in-house generated ones [16].
As the Booter websites main intention is to earn money, most
of the Booter websites make use of low-cost TLS certiﬁcates,
as they are equally trusted by the browsers.
6) Serial numbers, wildcards and SAN of TLS certiﬁcates:
Each TLS certiﬁcate must have a serial number, which
uniquely distinguishes it from all other certiﬁcates issued by
the same CA. The serial number is unique only to the issuing
CA and a non-negative integer [11]. We analyzed 152 Booter
Uniﬁed Resource Locators (URLs) and their certiﬁcate serial
number. Out of 152 Booters URLs, 18 TLS certiﬁcates provide
the same serial number to different Booter URLs as listed in
Table II.
To ensure that these Booter URL are related to each other,
we reviewed the common name and the alternative domain
name attributes as the TLS certiﬁcate could be a wildcard or
a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certiﬁcate. Wildcard TLS
certiﬁcates protect unlimited subdomains with a single certiﬁ-
cate. In contrast to wildcard TLS certiﬁcates, SAN certiﬁcates
protect multiple domain names with a single certiﬁcate. For
example, a SAN certiﬁcate could be issued for abc.de. In
addition, the domain gef.hi is added to the SAN values

and thus the same certiﬁcate protects multiple domains. We
identiﬁed the use of one wildcard certiﬁcate by the Booter
infrastructure listed in Table II row 2. Further, we assume that
the remainder of Booters in Table II use SAN certiﬁcates,
but do not explicitly add the different Booter URLs to the
alternative domain name attributes to secure their own Booter
infrastructure. As reported by [2], Booters protect themselves
using DDoS Protection Services. In case, the operator of
a Booter infrastructure would enter all possible alternative
domain names in the SAN attributes of a TLS certiﬁcate,
the Booter infrastructure itself would be more vulnerable to
attacks.
7) Certiﬁcate validity and revocation: When a TLS certiﬁ-
cate is issued, it is expected to be in use for its entire validation
period. However, various circumstances may cause a certiﬁcate
to become invalid prior to the expiration of the validity
period (e.g., change of name, change of association between
subject and CA, a compromise or suspected compromise of
the corresponding private key). In any of the aforementioned
circumstances, the CA needs to revoke the certiﬁcate [11].
Common name: The Common Name (CN) of a TLS
certiﬁcate is typically composed of a String containing the
host and domain name [30]. The CN must be the same as the
Web address that will be accessed when connecting to a secure
site. As a consequence, the TLS certiﬁcate is valid only if the
request host name matches either the common name or at least
one of the certiﬁcate subject alternative names. We found that
the 8 Booter URLs do not match to the CN written in the
TLS certiﬁcate. As a result, the connections to this Booter
websites appear to be invalid within the Browser. In a second
step, we analyzed what kind of third party is used as CN of
the certiﬁcate and found that the entries 1 and 4 in Table II
use a CN or SAN of a domain parking company instead of
the Booters URL.
Domain parking is often an advertising practice that resolve
to a Web page containing advertising listings and links and
are not limited to benign applications. However, the revenue

generated is split between the parking service and the domain
owner. As reported in [31] such domain parking monetization
is a million-dollar business. In accordance with [32], we
assume that domain parking is used by the owner of the Booter
websites once malicious actions of these domains have been
discovered and the domain has been blocked. Even though the
malicious domains have been blocked, trafﬁc from backlinks
is still used to make money [32].
SAN: The Subject Alternative Name (SAN) ﬁeld [11]
within the TLS certiﬁcate speciﬁes additional subject identi-
ﬁes. In case a SAN is deﬁned, the SAN must always be used
and the CN is only evaluated in case the SAN is not present.
We found that Booter websites entered 21 additional subject
identiﬁes on average. Surprisingly, we also found Booter
websites using more than 90 SANs in a single certiﬁcate. One
possible explanation for this huge amount of SANs within a
certiﬁcate is that these URLs reside in a Content Delivery
Network (CDN) network. However, CDNs serve content on
behalf of other companies. The servers of a CDN usually
handle results of hundreds or thousands of different domains
and are distributed all over the world. For reason of usability,
these servers often share a single TLS certiﬁcate. Another
explanation is that domains also might get compromised by
Booter owners and are abused for malicious activities.
Validity period: Each TLS certiﬁcate contains a validity
period. A validity period is described as the time interval dur-
ing, which the CA warrants that it will maintain information
about the status of the certiﬁcate [11]. A maximum validity
period is described within the Baseline Requirements for the
Issuance and Management of Publicly-Trusted Certiﬁcates by
the CA/ Browser Forum [33] and is set to 39 months maximum
validity of OV and DV TLS certiﬁcates in order to increase
TLS security. However, the TLS certiﬁcates used by Booter
websites use a maximum validity of half a year to one year
on average.
Revocation: In Section II-C5, we presented some incidents
with CAs that issued bogus TLS certiﬁcate. In most of those
cases, the CA creates and disseminates revocations of the
bogus TLS certiﬁcates. To revoke certiﬁcates nearly every
certiﬁcate contains a reference to a Certiﬁcate Revocation List
(CRL). A CRL is a list of certiﬁcates that the CA has revoked
for whatever reason. However, [34] reported that browsers
often do not bother to check whether certiﬁcates are revoked
(including mobile browsers, which uniformly never check).
Out of 152 Booter websites, only one Booter used a certiﬁcate
that had been revoked. Browsing this Booter website raises an
error message within the Web browser.
8) TLS protocol and cipher suites: During the TLS hand-
shake the used cipher suite is negotiated. Our TLS client
program uses a version-ﬂexible SSL/TLS method and thus the
protocol version used will be negotiated to the highest version
mutually supported by the client and server. In total, our TLS
client offered 42 cipher suites [35], from which a Booter
website selects the one most appropriate. Out of 152 Booter
websites that use TLS, 148 make use of TLS using a cipher

suite in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) [36][37]. In particular,
146 Booter websites secure their websites using the elliptic
curve cipher suite ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256.
According to the NIST recommendations on key length [38],
a 256-bit elliptic curve key provides as much protection as a
3 072-bit asymmetric key.
9) Hoster of Booter websites: In order to identify the
hosting provider of the Booter websites, we used the Booter
URLs presented in the Booter blacklist and performed a
whois query. We found that the majority of Booter websites
that are using TLS reside in the CDN of Cloudﬂare. Figure 5
shows the distribution of Booter URLs within the hosting
provider network categorized by Host or Alternative Domain
Names (ADNs). For example, the majority of Booter websites
make use of the Top Level Domains (TLDs) .com and .net
and reside in the network of Cloudﬂare. Further, Figure 5
shows, in which network the SANs are hosted. We found that
the majority of SANs presented within the TLS certiﬁcate of
a Booter website also reside in the network of Cloudﬂare.
To validate our results, we compared the preferred used
TLS protocol and cipher suite of the hosting network. In
Section II-C8, we showed that the majority of Booter websites
are using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and GCM. This
ﬁnding is in accordance with [39], who reported Cloudﬂare
enables their customers to use ECDSA certiﬁcates on their
CloudFlare-enabled sites. As a result, the majority of Booter
websites using ECC and GCM reside in the network of the
content delivery network Cloudﬂare.
10) TLD of Booters: Each Booter website is accessible
via an URL that is registered though a registrar at ICANN.
According to [40], 1930 Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs)
are coordinated by ICANN. We reviewed the top level domains
that are used by Booters websites. Reviewing the TLDs of the
Booter URLs at depth 0, the majority of Booters use .com and
.net TLDs. Taking also into account the SANs within the
TLS certiﬁcate of a Booter website, the majority of TLDs are
registered within the .com, .xyz, .org, .net and .cf.
However, the number of registered domains within a TLD
also vary and thus we reviewed the share of Booter URLs
that use TLS compared to the overall amount of registered
domains. Under consideration of the overall amount of reg-
istered domains, the majority of Booter URLs that use TLS
registered a .cf domain followed by .xyz, whereas .cf is a
country-code domain sponsored by the Soci´et´e Centrafricaine
de T´el´ecommunications (SOCATEL) and the .xyz is a generic
domain sponsored by XYZ.COM LLC.
III. DISCUSSION
In this section, we provide an aggregated overview of the
key ﬁndings. Further, we discuss our results with regard
to possible mitigation strategies. We have summarized the
information presented in Section II-C in Table III.
Even though the main intention of the TLS protocol and
the PKI is to give customers the conﬁdence to complete
their transactions using several trust indicators, there are no
technical restrictions in place that prohibit a CA from issuing

a certiﬁcate to a malicious third party [21]. Thus, both the
integrity of the CA based public key infrastructure and the
security users’ communications depend upon hundreds of
CAs around the world choosing to do the right thing. As a
consequence, anyone of those CAs can become the weakest
link in the chain.
In case of occurring security incidents at a CA, the affected
certiﬁcates should be revoked instead of selling the issuing
CAs and their key materials to third parties. As a consequence,
these TLS certiﬁcates are less valuable and are sold by the
acquiring companies for a lower price. However, acquiring a
CA and the transfer of key materials should be transparent to
the users of the PKI and well documented for later lookups.
Further, the TLS certiﬁcates and PKI should provide non-
technical users the possibility to differentiate low-value TLS
certiﬁcates from high-value TLS certiﬁcates in order to decide,
which URL to trust. At least for the European context, a
list of trusted CAs is available. In order to decide whom to
trust, a global list of trusted CAs would be beneﬁcial. Besides
the differentiation of low and high-value TLS certiﬁcates, the
addition of a reputation level of CAs within the trusted list
should be established.
Next, we found that the majority of TLS certiﬁcates used
by Booter URLs are issued by the Comodo Group Company.
According to [41], Comodo indeed is leading the overall
market (33.6%), however Symantec is still stronger among
top ranked websites. One possible mitigation strategies might
be the removal of certain certiﬁcation chains, but removing
intermediate and root certiﬁcates from the trust store of the
browser might cause a negative impact for non-technical users.
As a consequence, there is clearly a need to provide the
possibility to differentiate between different levels of trust
for non-technical users and to improve usability of TLS
certiﬁcates.

We found that in some cases Booter URLs do not match
their SANs or CN within the TLS certiﬁcate. Current Web
browsers raise a warning, but non-technical users might accept
the exception shown in the Web browser and can access the
website as expected. One approach to block the use of Booter
websites and thus mitigate the effects caused by Booter attacks
is to implement an automatic check and comparison of the CN
and SANs with the Booters URL.
Besides the not matching SANs or CN with the Booter
URL, we found that the Booter websites that use a TLS
certiﬁcate speciﬁed 21 SANs on average. In total, we found
3 156 SANs speciﬁed within the TLS certiﬁcate of the Booter
URLs listed on the Booter blacklist. Within these SANs, we
identiﬁed further suspicious domain names that contain various
terms to describe a Booter (e.g., www.beststresser.com uses
also the SAN of *.bestipstressers.com). We suggest to use
the SANs provided in each TLS certiﬁcate to extend the
Booter blacklist. We also identiﬁed several TLS certiﬁcates
that provide more than 90 SANs. One explanation might be
that this Booter URL resides in a CDN network. For reasons
of usability, CDN often share a single TLS certiﬁcate.
We identiﬁed numerous Booter URLs that reside in CDN
networks. Even though these Booter websites carry out DDoS
attacks and thus cause network trafﬁc within the CDN net-
work, in accordance with [42][43], we assume the amount of
network trafﬁc caused by these attacks is such that the CDN
network operators might not be able to detect these DDoS
attacks as their effects might be to small.
IV. RELATED WORK
Over recent years, DDoS-as-a-Service gained an increasing
research interest. [2] analyzed attacks generated by 14 distinct
Booter websites. Therefore, Santanna et al. [2] analyzed the
attack types, the attack volume and the geographic distribution
of the Booters. They found that DDoS-as-a-Service offers
non-technical skilled users the possibility to perform DDoS
attacks. In total, the authors were able to achieve up to 1.6
Gbps Domain Name System (DNS)-based and up to 7.0
Gbps CharGen attack trafﬁc. In [3], the authors provide an
overview of 15 operational MySQL databases (including users,
attacks and infrastructures) of Booters. Besides the operational
databases, Steinberger et al. [4] presented the Booter’s scenario
elements and their relationships. A Booters’ scenario consists
of the six elements: A Booter customer, a payment system, a
database, a Booter website including DDoS Protection Service,
a Booter infrastructure and a target system.
To mitigate DDoS attacks performed by Booter websites, a
list of Booter characteristics to detect and classify them was
created in the work of [44]. An initiative to share the (most
extensive) list of websites that offer DDoS attacks as a paid
service is provided on http://booterblacklist.com. However,
none of the aforementioned works focused on the use of TLS
certiﬁcates used by Booter URLs as one possible mitigation
strategy.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we conducted a structured analysis of the
use of TLS certiﬁcates of 434 active Booter websites, which
allowed us to gain insight into the certiﬁcate chain, used
cryptography and cipher suites, negotiation protocol, issuer
and the validity of the certiﬁcate. Our analysis revealed that
an increasing number of Booter owners make use of TLS
to hide their malicious activities inside encrypted trafﬁc and
thus remain undetected by current security tools. Further, we
found that Booter websites predominantly use elliptic curve
cryptography combined with Galois/Counter mode. We recog-
nized that the TLS certiﬁcates of Booter websites often specify
numerous SANs. Therefore, we suggest to include the SANs
into the Booter blacklist in case they contain certain terms
used to describe Booters (e.g., *stresser*, *ddoser*)
as they are most likely also Booter websites.
