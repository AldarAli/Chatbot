Abstract— Establishing trust between a patient and a doctor 
depends as much on their relationship as on the doctor’s 
medical abilities. An important factor in building and 
maintaining a relationship is whether the doctor produces 
facial expressions appropriate to the patient’s condition. The 
purpose of this study is to identify facial expressions 
appropriate to various patient conditions. We focused on the 
greetings given by young doctors at the beginning of medical 
interviews of adult patients in the general ward of a hospital. 
Images of a role-playing patient portraying one of three 
physical conditions were shown to seven student doctors, who 
were then videotaped as they greeted the “patient”. We 
identified appropriate facial expressions for each condition by 
comparison between human evaluation and analysis of the 
computer emotion analysis system.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Patient satisfaction is an important component of medical 
care [1]. Improving patient satisfaction enhances trust and 
the relationship between patient and doctor, which leads to 
stronger adherence to the prescribed protocol, such as taking 
medicine, and to enhanced therapeutic effect [2][3]. Many 
studies and reviews have shown that the main determinant of 
patient satisfaction is patient-doctor relationship [4]-[8] and 
that patient satisfaction is higher when the patient 
communicates with a doctor having strong nonverbal 
communication ability [9][10]. However, inexperienced 
young doctors and medical students often have trouble 
producing appropriate facial expressions when greeting a 
patient. The first author of this paper, a lecturer on medical 
communication, often hears young doctors complaining that, 
though they intend to smile, patients say that they seem to be 
angry. 
In this study, we identified appropriate facial expressions 
for a doctor by using quantitative analysis. We videotaped 
medical students' facial expressions when they greeted a 
patient and analyzed the recorded videos using the computer 
emotion analysis system. We then asked potential patients to 
evaluate the appropriateness of the facial expressions on a 
five-point scale. We clarify a facial expression found 
according to the scene by a doctor by comparing both.  
 The facial expression required for a doctor may be 
influenced by the patient's condition, treatment scene, culture, 
medical department, gender. As the first step, we focused on 
appropriate facial expressions of young medical doctors for 
greeting patients in the general ward of a hospital.  
After reviewing related works in Section II, our facial 
expression analysis system is explained in Section III. We 
describe the evaluation experiment in Section IV, and 
analyze facial expression for recorded videos in Section V. 
We conclude with a summary of the key points and a 
mention of future work in Section VI. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
A. Medical Interviews 
Medical interviews have traditionally focused on 
gathering relevant information from patients [11]. Nowadays, 
the focus has expanded to building a trusting relationship, 
sharing decision-making, responding to the patient’s 
emotional state, supporting actions related to the patient’s 
condition and treatment, so the doctor must have a wider 
range of communication skills [12]. These skills include 
"looking at a patient not as a case but as a human being" [13] 
and "building and maintaining a good relationship between 
doctor and patient" [14]. It has been shown that such skills 
have a greater effect on patient satisfaction than the doctor’s 
medical skills, the medicine prescribed, the information 
provided, the questions asked, the advice given, and the 
instructions given. In particular, a patient's satisfaction is 
positively related to the doctor being warm [13][15], 
empathic [13][15]-[17], and friendly [15] and giving the 
impression of being human [16]. 
"Nonverbal 
communication" 
is 
a 
means 
of 
communicating these emotional aspects. Patient satisfaction 
is higher when the doctor has a strong ability to express his 
or her emotions and to read the emotions of others by 
nonverbal communication such as through facial expressions, 
gaze, posture, and tone of voice [9][18][19]. In short, a 
doctor's nonverbal communication is an important aspect of 
patient care. 
B. Nonverbal Communication 
Facial expression plays a large role in nonverbal 
communication. For emotional messages such as "likes" and 
"dislikes," Mehrabian [20] estimated that 7% of the message 
is carried by the language content, 38% is carried by the 
voice and sound quality, and 55% is carried by the facial 
expression and gestures. Birdwhistell [21] argued that 35% 
of the message is carried by the language content while the 
remaining 65% is carried by the expression, the way of

talking, the gestures, etc. Therefore, it is useful to clarify the 
appropriate facial expressions for doctors to have when 
communicating with patients, especially patients who are 
sensitive to a doctor's nonverbal behavior due to anxiety [22] 
[23]. 
III. 
FACIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS SYSTEM 
To identify appropriate facial expressions, we developed 
a system that quantitatively analyzes changes in facial 
expression. It is based on the Cognitive Services Emotion 
API [24] provided by Microsoft's Azure cloud service. The 
concept of the system is illustrated in Figure 1. The doctor’s 
facial image during a patient interview is recorded in a video 
file. The file is sent to the Cognitive Services Emotion API, 
which provides feedback on the position coordinates of the 
doctor’s face and the ratio by emotion. To realize the above 
functions, 
the 
developed 
system 
comprises 
Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Emotion.dll which corresponds to 
the Emotion API on Azure, Newtonsoft.Json.dll which 
handles the file in JSON format, Parakeet.dll which 
processes the movie file, and Parakeet.Logging.dll which 
passes the facial expression analysis received from the 
Emotion API as a log file to for real time display. We 
developed 
Parakeet.dll, 
Parakeet.Logging.dll 
and 
LogViewerWPF.exe.  
Our facial expression emotion analysis system calculates 
the ratio for seven emotions ("happiness," "anger," 
"contempt," "disgust," "fear," "sadness," and "surprise") 
reflected in the input video image, and "neutral." The total 
for all emotions is 1, and the value for "neutral" is obtained 
by subtracting the total value for the seven emotions from 1. 
The detection result window is shown in Figure 2. Each 
row shows the results for the emotion corresponding to one 
facial expression. The rows are in time series order, with the 
latest set of results in the bottom row. Clicking the display 
command on the menu highlights the detection results for the 
specified face. Selecting a line by using the mouse or 
keyboard causes the corresponding video to play. 
The cells corresponding to each emotional value are 
highlighted in "pink." If the value = 1, the cells are the 
darkest pink, and if the value = 0, the cells have no color. For 
example, if the emotional value is 0.8, the color density is 
80%.

EVALUATION EXPERIMENT 
One way to analyze the facial expressions of veteran 
doctors would be to clarify facial expressions appropriate for 
doctors. However, their facial expression would not be 
always right. And, since many young physicians have 
trouble presenting appropriate facial expressions when 
greeting a patient, we chose to find facial expressions that 
would be acceptable for most patients including potential 
patients from facial expressions which medical students 
think suitable. This time, we targeted the situation when they 
greet patients in the general ward of a hospital. We 
videotaped their greeting for model patients to evaluate and 
identified 
appropriate 
facial 
expressions. 
Although 
evaluation by actual patients is best, it would have been 
difficult to request their participation. Hence, we asked 
general healthy adults who had hospitalization in the past or 
would have ones in the future. At the same time, we used 
computerized facial expression analysis to identify suitable 
facial expressions, as introduced in section Ⅲ. 
A. Experimental Conditions 
1) Doctor participants: Seven medical students (4 
females, 3 males; average age 22.5 years) 
2) Patient conditions: Although the actual condition of 
hospitalized patients varies widely among patients, we had a 
role-playing patient portray only three conditions, as shown 
in Figure 3: a patient who feels physically healthy (a "bright 
patient"), one whose physical condition is unknown (an 
"expressionless patient"), and one who feels badly and is 
suffering pain (a "patient in pain"). 
3) Video recording: The three photographs in Figure 3 
were presented to the doctor participants along with the 
following explanation. "The pictures you will see show a 
patient you visit during regular morning rounds in a hospital. 
They are of the same patient, but his condition is different in 
each picture. In the first one, he feels physically healthy, in 
the second one, his physical condition is unknown, and in 
the third one, he feels badly and is suffering pain. After 
looking at each picture, please greet the patient as a doctor 
for about 5 seconds or so." This process was repeated days 
later using three of the students and the same photographs. 
On the first day, all students greeted the patient as they 
thought best. Before the process on the second day, the three 
selected students received coaching based on the authors'

previous findings. On the second day, foregoing three 
students greeted the patient again. We recorded their 
greetings (30 recordings in total) and used them for our 
evaluation of facial expressions. 
The purpose of this research is not to find most 
appropriate facial expressions, but acceptable ones for most 
patients. Therefore, we think not many doctors are needed 
as participants. In this paper, we consider the meaning of 
appropriate to be the same as acceptable. 
B. Subjective Evaluation 
To make the subjective evaluation more effective, we 
first had 16 people view and evaluate each video recording 
and removed the ones in which the student’s facial 
expression was judged to be unacceptable. We then had 31 
other people view and evaluate the remaining recordings. 
 
1) First subjective evaluation: We showed the video 
recordings to 5 men and 11 women (average age 46) 
without sound. We asked them to judge whether the 
doctor’s facial expression was appropriate for the situation 
on a 5-point scale ("1 completely appropriate," "2 somewhat 
appropriate," "3 neutral," "4 not so appropriate," "5 not at all 
appropriate "). We asked them to also comment on anything 
they felt or noticed. We showed the recordings without 
sound because we wanted them to focus on appropriate 
facial expressions in medical communication situations, and 
emotion is easier to read from speech than from facial 
expressions. The results are shown in Table I.  
 
2) Second subjective evaluation: For the second 
subjective evaluation, we eliminated the recordings with 
score of 4 or 5, these would be unacceptable values for 
patients, in the first evaluation, except for one score-4 
recording. The score-4 recording was kept because 
otherwise there would have been only three recordings for 
the "patient in pain." The videos used were B-1 to B-6 for 
the "bright patient" (shown in blue in Table I), E-1, E-2, E-3, 
E-4, and E-8 for the "expressionless patient" (shown in 
gray), and P-1 to P-4 and P-8 for the "patient in pain" 
(shown in yellow). 
We showed these videos to 17 men and 14 women 
(average age 35.9) without sound. We asked them to judge 
whether the doctor’s facial expression was appropriate for 
the patient’s condition on the same 5-point scale. We again 
asked them to also comment on anything they felt or noticed. 
The results are shown in Table Ⅱ. As in the first evaluation, 
we showed the videos without sound so that they would 
focus their attention on the facial expressions.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS  
In addition to the two subjective evaluations, the 
emotions represented by the facial expressions in the 16 
highest ranked videos were identified using the emotion 
analysis system.  
A. Facial expressions appropriate for "bright patient" 
1) The three top-ranked videos for "bright patient" as 
subjectively evaluated were analyzed from the point of view 
of what emotions appear in the facial expressions, as 
identified by computer. Tables III, IV, and V show the  
results. Table VI shows the results for video B-10, which 
was evaluated as low. The cells in the tables corresponding 
to 0 or more and less than 0.2 are shown in blue, 0.2 or  
more and less than 0.4 in green, 0.4 or more and less than 
0.6 in yellow, 0.6 or more and less than 0.8 in orange, and 
0.8 or more in red. A representative facial expression is 
shown in Figure 4. Images of the students corresponding to 
videos B-2 and B-4 are not shown because we could not get 
permission.

The facial expression for "bright patient" was "constant 
happiness" (expressed more as a laugh rather than simply a 
smile) for the three top-ranked videos. The lower evaluated 
video, B-10, was mostly "neutral," and it was judged as 
showing "nervousness," "no expression," "scary eye,", etc. 
which explains why it received a low evaluation. 
 
B. Facial expressions appropriate for "expressionless 
patient" 
The three top-ranked videos for "expressionless patient" 
as subjectively evaluated were analyzed from the point of 
view of what emotions appear in the facial expressions as 
identified by computer. Tables VII, VIII, and IX show the 
results. Table X shows the results for video E-8, which was 
evaluated as low. 
As shown in Figure 5, the image representing the first 
half of video E-1 is largely "happiness" (expressed as a 
smile) 
and 
"neutral" 
in 
the 
second 
half 
(mainly 
expressionless). The 2nd- and 3rd-ranked were mostly 
"neutral." The lower evaluated video, E-8, was mostly 
"happiness," which was judged not to be serious enough. It is 
thought that this is because medical students cannot judge 
whether an "expressionless patient" is in a good or bad 
physical condition due to the lack of expression. Since the 
patient’s condition could be bad, an expression showing 
"happiness" was judged by some as inappropriate. The 
"neutral" expressions shown in the 2nd- and 3rd-ranked 
videos were apparently judged as having little effect on the 
patient. The top-ranked video showed a natural greeting 
starting with a smile and then transitioning to "neutral" as the 
"doctor" learned about the patient’s condition, which is 
considered to be the reason for the high evaluation.

C. Facial expressions appropriate for "patient in pain" 
 The three top-ranked videos for "patient in pain" as 
subjectively evaluated were analyzed from the point of view 
of what emotions appear in the facial expressions as 
identified by computer. Tables XI, XII, and XIII show the 
results. The expression in the top-ranked video is shown in 
Figure 6. Table XIV shows the results for video P-10, which 
was evaluated low. 
The expressions in the higher ranked videos are mainly 
"neutral," with "surprise," "sadness," or "fear" gradually 
appearing in some. There was virtually no expression of 
"happiness," "anger," or "disgust" except for the third frame 
of video P-1. In contrast, expression in the lower ranked 
video, P-10, was mostly "happiness," resulting in comments 
such as "the grinning made me feel uncomfortable " and 
"the doctor seemed to be smiling faintly." These comments 
explain the low evaluation.

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Our quantitative analysis of medical student’s facial 
expressions when greeting an adult patient to be medically 
evaluated in the general ward of a hospital revealed which 
facial expressions are most acceptable. For patients who feel 
physically healthy, the most acceptable facial expression is 
"continuous happiness" (expressed more as a laugh rather 
than simply a smile). For patients without a facial expression, 
the most acceptable facial expression is initially "happiness" 
(expressed as a smile) and then "neutral" (without 
expression). For patients in bad physical condition suffering 
pain, the most acceptable facial expression is "neutral" with a 
little "sadness" or "surprise." 
We think appropriate facial expressions required for a 
medical doctor would be different for the treatment 
department, generation, gender and culture. We plan to 
clarify their influence in future work. In addition, we are 
developing a training system based on our findings to learn 
acceptable expressions.
