INTRODUCTION
Globally, energy consumption in buildings makes up
about 35% of the total energy consumption. Furthermore, the
cost of building energy accounts for almost 30% of all
building management costs [1]-[2]. For this reason, reducing
the amount of building energy is an important issue in terms
of global warming and the exhaustion of energy resources, as
well as cost reduction. Energy saving in buildings can lead to
both enormous cost savings and great greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission reductions. Korea has planned to save GHG
emission by 37% from business-as-usual (BAU) level by
2030 across all economic sectors. To cope with the twenty-
first session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 21), the
Korean government has announced a plan to new public
buildings to be a zero energy building by 2020 and also
expand the plan toward new private buildings by 2025. The
number of public buildings in Korea is about 190,000. Thus,
it is important to draw up a retrofit budget every year for a
number of public buildings to meet the target of GHG
emission reduction.
In existing buildings, on the other hand, much of energy
consumptions can be safely reduced by the adoption of the
adequate energy conservation measures (ECMs). ECMs are
to
reduce
building
energy
consumptions
by
reducing
operating time, improving energy efficiency and adopting
new and renewable energy, which results in both energy cost
saving and GHG emission reduction. However, the number
of combinations of selectable ECMs is excessively large.
Thus, it is difficult for building owners and project managers
to select an optimal ECM combination in which the initial
implementation cost is minimized while the target of GHG
emission reduction is satisfied for a building retrofit.
Energy saving caused by implementing ECMs can be
estimated by the measurement and verification (M&V)
methodology [6]. The M&V methodology is to monitor and
quantify the changes in the performance and operational
parameters which are measured or calculated. The values of
the parameters are needed to calculate energy savings
associated with each ECM implementation. Thus, GHG
reduction can be obtained from the energy savings. Recent
researches in building retrofit include simulation tools based
on various databases and standards [7]-[10].
This paper presents a method to decide the minimal
initial
implementation
cost
of
a
building
retrofit
for
satisfying the target of GHG emission reduction. In this
paper, we present how to analyze energy savings and GHG
emission reduction in Section II. Afterwards, we describe
how to decide the optimal ECMs whose implementation cost
is minimized for satisfying the target of GHG emission
reduction in Section III. Section IV describes the simulation
environment and presents simulation results including an
optimal ECM list, estimated GHG emission reduction and
initial implementation cost, and finally, we conclude this
paper in Section V.

GHG EMISSION REDUCTION ANALYSIS
A. Energy Saving
The amount of energy saving can be estimated by
comparing the difference of energy consumptions between
before and after ECM adoption. In order to determine the
energy saving, baseline energy Ebase and post-installation
energy Epost are firstly defined as the amount of energy that
would be consumed without ECM implementation and the
estimated or measured energy consumptions after the
implementation, respectively [4]-[5]. Thus, the energy saving
Esave is obtained as follows:

(

where, Eadj represents adjustment energy to compensate
for the changes in occupant behavior and weather condition,
and for the difference of other factors between the baseline
period and performance evaluation period.

Figure 1.
A typical ECM classification and cadidate ECMs of a building to be retrofitted
On the other hand, the energy saving Esave of an ECM
also can be estimated depending on the ECM factor. A
typical classification of ECMs and detailed measures (a) and
candidate ECMs (b) are shown Figure 1. ECMs for building
retrofit may include various types, such as construction,
facility, lighting, and new and renewable energy. In figure
1(a), the ECM for outer wall improvement has five detailed
measures with different U-values, thermal transmittance and
costs
per
square
meters.
When
the
current
thermal
transmittance is 1.10, the detailed measures for improving
thermal transmittance may be three detailed measures, d1,3,
d1,4 and d1,5. The others, d1,1 and d1,2, can be neglected.
Candidate ECMs are composed of the ECMs that are capable
of improving energy efficiency in figure 1(b). Candidate
ECMs have energy savings and implementation costs of the
corresponding building, which are calculated based on the
ECM factors, weather condition and building information
including location, size and occupant behavior.
A
building retrofit includes one or more ECMs. If N
ECMs are included in a building retrofit project, the energy
savings of the project will be calculated as follows:

where, Esave and Esave,i denote the overall energy saving
by ECMs and the estimated energy saving of ECM i,
respectively, in a building retrofit project.
B. GHG Emission Reduction
Greenhouse gas, like CO2, results from the burning of
fossil fuel sources including coal, petroleum and natural gas.
Each fuel source has a different GHG emission factor, as
shown in Table I [12].

OPTIMAL ECM DECISION BASED ON GHG EMISSION
REDUCTION TARGET
A problem of zero energy building is expensive.
Likewise, a lot of money is required for existing building
retrofit to meet the target of GHG emission reduction. Thus,
the proposed optimal ECM decision method minimizes the
implementation cost of ECMs for satisfying the target of
GHG emission reduction, T_GHG_R. The implementation
cost is obtained by

From (3), the proposed algorithm tries to find an optimal
combination of ECMs to minimize the implementation cost
of the building retrofit, so the algorithm chooses the best
possible outcome.
We modified the Knapsack algorithm
[11] to minimize the amount of implementation cost for the
retrofit while still keeping the overall GHG emission
reduction larger than or equal to its target. The pseudocode is
shown in Figure 2.

if (R[i, c] ≥ R[i-1, c])
L[i, c] = L[i-1, c] ∪ {i};
if (R[i, c] ≥ T)
Cost = c; List = L[i, c]; Reduction = R[i, c];
break GHG_optimalECM;
}
Figure 2.
Psudocode for optimal ECM decision algorithm
The algorithm is to determine whether each ECM will be
included in an ECM list for the building retrofit. Therefore,
the total GHG emission reduction is larger than or equal to a
given limitation while maintaining the total implementation
cost is as low as possible.
IV.
SIMULATION
To examine the proposed method, we set up an optimal
ECM decision tool, as shown in Figure 3, which consists of
building information, data base, GHG based optimal ECM
decision engine and output unit. The building information
includes
building
attributes,
consumptions
and
energy
diagnosis results. The current value of the attribute of each
ECM can be obtained from the energy diagnosis results of
the corresponding build. The database includes ECM,
climate and energy price information.
The tool analyzes energy savings associated with each
ECM for a building retrofit and organizes the candidate
ECM table with energy saving and implementation cost. An
example of a candidate ECM table is shown in Table III.
Table IV represents the estimated optimal ECM list, initial
implementation cost and GHG emission reduction. If the
target of GHG emission reduction is 800 kilograms per year,
the optimal ECM combination is {5, 6, 7}, the lowest
implementation cost is 4800, and estimated GHG reduction
is 820 kilograms per year, respectively.
From the results, we can see the budget required for a
building retrofit to meet the target of GHG emission
reduction and prioritize which buildings to be firstly
retrofitted within an allowable budget.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, an optimal ECM decision method has been
presented, which determines an optimal ECM combination
for building retrofit. The optimal ECM combination is a
subset of ECMs to minimize the initial implementation cost
for satisfying the target of GHG emission reduction. ECMs
can reduce building energy so building owners and project
managers can decide an optimal ECM combination both to
reduce GHG emission and to save energy cost. The proposed
method modified the knapsack algorithm to decide an
optimal ECM combination among numerous combinations
of ECMs. The presented method provides building owners
and project managers with the optimal ECM list, estimated
implementation cost and estimated GHG emission reduction.
Much of building energy can be reduced with a suitable
ECM adoption, which leads to enormous GHG reduction.
However, the number of ECM combinations increases
exponentially with the number of ECMs and each ECM
requests an initial implementation cost. For this reason, it is
difficult for building owners and project managers to select a
suitable ECM combination for their building retrofits to
reduce GHG emission within a limited budget. To estimate
the initial implementation cost for satisfying the target of
GHG emission reduction, this paper set up an optimal ECM
decision environment and performed simulations on GHG
emission reduction. The analysis results provide the optimal
ECM combination to meet the target of GHG emission
reduction while the implementation cost is minimal.
Further studies are necessary to get more data on detailed
measures for ECMs and verify simulation results of the
optimal ECM decision method for various buildings.
