I.   INTRODUCTION 
 
      Nowadays, liquid chemicals are widely used in different 
industrial and clinical applications. Therefore, rapid detection 
and categorization of chemical samples have gained 
tremendous attention in clinical settings, drug discovery, 
security, safety and industrial applications.  
      Microwave sensors are usually preferred for many of 
biomedical, electronic and industrial applications [1]. These 
sensors provide different advantages such as robustness, high 
sensitivity, low fabrication costs and easy measurement 
procedure [2]. Due to these advantages, the microwave 
sensors become superior choices for biosensing and 
microfluidic applications. In [3], the microwave resonator 
method has been used for the measurement of complex 
permittivity of the biological liquids. To determine the 
complex permittivity of the samples, the transmission 
characteristics at resonance and the resonance frequency 
changes have been used. Also, the concentration measurement 
of liquid solutions with the help of microwave resonator has 
been presented and validated in [4]. However, for integrated 
system design, the sensors reported in [3] [4] are not suitable 
due to their large size. In [5], a compact microwave and 
microfluidic sensor has been demonstrated with complicated 
mathematical post-processing, dedicated to bioengineering 
application.  
      Recently, the design of metamaterial (MTM) based sensor 
has gained a tremendous attention in the field of microwave 
sensor design [6]. The metamaterials are artificially 
engineered metallic structures designed to obtain unusual 
material properties not available in nature. The resonance 
frequency of the MTM structures greatly depends upon the 
inductive and capacitive property of the resonator structure 
[7]. This property suggests that the MTM based structures are 
suitable for sensing applications. Also, these structures 
provide improved compactness and a high Quality-factor 
which is highly sensitive to change in environment [8]. 
Different types of sensors have been presented in the literature 
based on metamaterial for various sensing applications, such 
as thin-film sensing [9], rotation [10] and strain sensing [11]. 
Most recently, the metamaterial based microfluidic sensors 
have also been reported in [12] [13]. A microstrip coupled 
complementary split-ring resonator has been used for 
microfluidic dielectric characterization [12]. Also in [13], a 
dual gap meta-atom split-ring resonator has been used to 
determine the dielectric properties of the liquid.  The 
microfluidic channels have been designed to provide the fluid 
sample to the resonators producing a significant variation of 
the resonance frequency elaborated in [12] [13]. However, 
these configurations need a large volume of liquid sample for 
characterization. 
      This paper presents a simple, compact and highly sensitive 
chemical sensor design by using MTM unit cell. The sensor is 
designed by incorporating metamaterial SRR within a small 
square loop. Here, the loop is used for the excitation of SRR. 
The overall size of the metamaterial based sensor is 0.14λ0
0.14λ0 0.02λ0, where λ0 is the free space wavelength. A high 
Q-factor of 419 is obtained for the proposed sensor. The 
proposed configuration is designed and measurements are 
performed. The experimental result shows a shift in resonance 
frequency and return loss during the measurement of distilled 
water, alcohol and acetone.  
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next 
section describes the characterization of metamaterial unit 
cell. In Section III, the configuration of the proposed liquid 
sensor using metamaterial unit cell is presented. The 
measurement setup and measured results for different liquid 
samples are discussed in Section IV. Finally, the conclusion is 
furnished in Section V.

pattern which introduces self-inductances is represented by Ls 
and due to the cut in SRR results in capacitances denoted by 
Cs. The dimensions of the configuration are given in Table 1.

equivalent circuit model as an LC tank. 
Here, the dimensions are optimized by the numerical 
simulation. The FR4 dielectric substrate is used to design the 
MTM unit cell has a dielectric constant of 4.4, the substrate 
thickness of 1.6 mm, and loss tangent of 0.02 with the copper 
pattern thickness of 0.017 mm. A parallel incident plane wave 
having a polarized electric field in the direction of x  is 
considered for the calculation of the scattering parameters of 
the MTM structure. By using periodic boundary conditions,     
the reflection and transmission coefficients are obtained from 
a single metamaterial unit cell structure.

incorporated within a small square loop. The combined 
structure acts as a sensor. The different dimensions of the

      A 
simulation 
has 
been 
performed 
using 
50Ω 
characteristics impedance line coupled to the square loop as 
shown in Figure 4. The gap (r) between SRR and loop is 
optimized by numerical simulation to obtain a better matching 
in resonance frequency. As a consequence, a high Q-factor is 
obtained which is essential for sensing applications. 
IV.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
      To verify the design concept, a prototype of the proposed 
sensor was fabricated and measurements have been performed 
for different chemical samples. The simulated electric field 
distribution of the proposed sensor at the resonant frequency is 
shown in Figure 5. From the figure, it is observed that the field 
density near the cut gap of SRR is much higher compared to 
other metallic parts. Hence, the disturbance of electric field by 
the liquid sample is highly sensed by these particular part. For 
this reason, during measurement of chemical response, only 
the SRR part is inserted into the sample to obtain the change 
in resonance frequency.

configuration. 
 
 
Figure 6. Simulated and measured return loss characteristics of the proposed 
sensor and different liquids.  
      The simulated and measured return loss characteristics of 
the SRR based sensor are shown in Figure 6. It can be pointed 
out from the figure that the measured resonant frequency of 
the sensor in the air is 4.19 GHz, whereas the simulated 
frequency is 4.32 GHz. The high Q-factor is obtained for the 
proposed sensor which is 432 for the simulated result, and 419 
for measured result. The Q factor is defined as
rf / 
f , where 
rf  is the resonance frequency and f is the bandwidth at +3 
dB with respect to the minimal reflection. The discrepancy 
occurred in between the measured and simulated results are 
due to measurement and fabrication tolerances.  
 
 
 
Figure 7. Measurement setup for the liquid sensor using vector network 
analyzer (VNA), in inset the fabricated prototype is shown. 
 
      The measured response of different liquids such as 
distilled water, alcohol and acetone is also shown in Figure 6. 
It can be observed from the figure that during the 
measurement of different liquid samples a huge shift in 
resonance frequency is observed. In case of 100% water, 
alcohol and acetone, the resonance frequencies are obtained at 
3.4 GHz, 2.4 GHz, and 3.84 GHz, respectively with the return 
loss of -14.9 dB, -16.3 dB and -20.2 dB. Also, a measurement 
is performed with the mixture of water, alcohol, and acetone. 
It can be seen from Figure 6 that the resonance frequency of 
the liquid mixture is 2.94 GHz with the return loss of -18.64 
dB. The measurement setup is shown in Figure 7.  
 
V.   CONCLUSION  
 
      In this paper, a metamaterial based high sensitive chemical 
sensor is proposed and designed. The sensor is designed by 
incorporating magnetic metamaterial SRR within a small 
square loop. The overall size of the metamaterial based sensor 
is 0.14λ0 0.14λ0 0.02λ0. A high Quality-factor of 419 is 
obtained for the proposed sensor configuration. The 
experimental results for the shifts in resonance frequency and 
return loss of distilled water, alcohol and acetone are studied. 
The sensor proposed here is simple in design and easily 
fabricated on the commercially available FR4 dielectric 
substrate by using metal etching procedure. The proposed 
metamaterial based sensor is small in size and compact in its 
shape.
