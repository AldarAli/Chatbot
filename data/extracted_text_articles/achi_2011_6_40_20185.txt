Abstract—This work introduces a hand exoskeleton that allows 
full range of motion and can exert bi-directional forces on the 
finger phalanges. The link lengths and structure of the 
proposed mechanism have been emerged as a result of 
kinematics-based optimization criteria. It is an under-actuated 
mechanism allowing 4 DOF/finger with one active degree. The 
selection of the actuator has been based on human hand 
capabilities to accomplish common daily life activities. An 
initial un-actuated finger prototype has been developed to 
analyze the mechanism functionality and to confirm the 
optimization results. Results have demonstrated that the device 
covers the complete operational range of motion of a human 
hand.

 INTRODUCTION 
Thanks to revolutionary trends in multidisciplinary areas 
of mechatronics and computing, realistic exoskeleton 
devices do exist. They are devices aiming to transmit 
kinaesthetic feedback at the level of the finger in order to 
emulate the constrains imposed by grasping of virtually or 
remotely manipulated objects. Exoskeleton based systems 
combine machine power and human intelligence to enhance 
human operator’s capabilities as well as machine 
intelligence. Therefore, such systems have greatly improved 
to acquire the performance level which has not been 
possible otherwise. They are always designed as an external 
mechanical link structure and find potential applications in 
various areas including haptics, Virtual Reality (VR) and 
rehabilitation. 
As the field of haptics evolved, the application of force 
feedback techniques in VR has become more demanding. 
Haptic interfaces have proven to be extremely useful during 
the interaction of users within virtual environment. 
Exoskeleton robotic devices make use of the haptic sense to 
enhance the presence impression by reproducing the contact 
forces on the wearer hand. Thus the use of such system 
improves the interaction with the virtual environment and 
increases the dexterity of the operator with the virtual 
objects. Such interfaces can be classified into grounded and 
portable devices. Grounded devices can only simulate fixed 
objects because they limit the range of the operators’ 
freedom of motion. For pseudo-natural interactions, portable 
haptic devices are used because they provide more 
flexibility in terms of operator’s freedom. However they can 
simulate fixed forces only when employed with a grounded 
device.  
Considering the domain of rehabilitation, theraphy 
procedures are usually required to regain the normal hand 
strength and capabilities. In past, such procedures were 
executed manually by physiotherapists. Occasionally simple 
passive assistive devices have been employed to aid in 
rehabilitation. 
However 
technological 
revolution 
has 
evolved robotic hand exoskeletons that may be used in 
rehabilitation to improve the medical outcome. 
This paper is structured as follows: Section II explains the 
related work while Section III highlights brief design details 
including goals and device mechanism. Section IV deals 
with the design optimization of the proposed device while 
Section V introduces design requirements, Section VI 
presents the details of preliminary and final prototype, and 
finally, Section VII comments on the conclusion.

RELATED WORK  
The development of a hand exoskeleton device is a very 
challenging endeavor, which has been targeted by many 
research professionals. A multi-phalanx hand exoskeleton 
consisting of four fingers that was able to exert forces on 
each phalanx of each finger was developed at PERCRO lab 
[1]. Few years later, researchers at Keio University realized 
a three fingers non-isomorphic device actuated by passive 
clutches [2]. Springer and Nicola at the University of 
Wisconsin have presented a 1-finger prototype utilizing a 
planar four-bar linkage. They analyzed the haptic effect 
perceived by the user [3]. A 2-finger hand exoskeleton 
intended for VR grasping simulation, having 3 Degree Of 
Freedom(DOF)/finger and 4 for the thumb has been 
developed by Stergiopoulos [4]. Lelieveld et al. proposed a 
4 DOF portable wearable haptic interface with active and 
passive multi-point feedback for the index finger in master-
slave 
configuration 
[5]. 
Another 
hand 
exoskeleton 
developed at PERCRO intended for haptic interaction in 
virtual environment has 3 DOF/finger and can exert 
controlled forces on the finger tips [6]. A under-actuated 2-

finger hand exoskeleton has been conceived by researchers 
at IIT. It consists of an optimized Revolute-Revolute-
Revolute (RRR) mechanism and can provide force levels 
(45N) beyond any existing system.  The main optimization 
criteria are Global Isotropy Index (GII) and Perpendicular 
Impact Force (PIF) factors. The proposed system can be 
used for tele-operation, VR, Human-Robot-Interaction 
(HRI) [7].  
 The present Hand EXOskeleton SYStem (HEXOSYS) is 
an effort to combine good salient features present 
individually in the existing hand exoskeleton designs: 
Portability, Human hand compatibility, Optimization, 
Direct-driven, Back-drivability, Full range of motion, Light 
mass, Low complexity, Provision of bi-directional force and 
so on. At the time of writing this paper, there is not any 
existing hand exoskeleton system reported in the literature 
that encompasses all of these mentioned features in a single 
device. This fact essentially puts the novelty in the proposed 
system. It has been designed as a general purpose system. 
That is why instead of concentrating on the requirements of 
a particular application, the device specifications have been 
derived from a series of experiments with the human hand, 
thus keeping the system beneficial for wide range of 
applications. Potential applications of this system include 
tele/virtual 
presence, 
tele/virtual 
manipulation 
and 
rehabilitation. Trying to match the human hand force 
capabilities as well as natural workspace resulted in a 
human hand compatible device.  
 
III. 
DESIGN GOALS & DEVICE MECHANISM 
The human hand can be counted as one of the most 
difficult systems to emulate with a mechatronic device. This 
difficulty is mainly due to two reasons. First, is the 
unavailability of ample space for components placement and 
second is high number of DOF (4 or even more in case of 
thumb). These pose a great challenge in terms of design 
requirements. Some obvious desired characteristics of such a 
system are summarized below. Detailed desired requirements 
of such a system are reported in [7]. 
(i) 
Low mass/inertia. 
(ii) 
Unconstrained range of motion. 
(iii) 
Minimum complexity. 
(iv) 
Comfort. 
 
It is clear that the above requirements cannot be satisfied 
by solutions employing large number of actuation units 
trying to power most of the finger phalanges. Our approach 
to design the HEXOSYS is to use a less complicated finger 
exoskeleton 
mechanism. 
The 
conceptual 
mechanism 
proposed in this work is shown in Figure 1. The finger 
exoskeleton system is a two links planar under-actuated 
mechanism which is attached to the user finger at a single 
point. A single actuation unit residing at the proximal joint 
of the exoskeleton is used to power the device.

DEVISE OPTIMIZATION 
The kinematic performance of the proposed device is 
essentially a strong function of proper choice of link lengths 
and the link shape. This motivated us to carry out an 
optimization procedure during design of the HEXOSYS to 
find out the optimum values of exoskeleton link lengths The 
primary 
optimization 
criteria 
is 
kinematics, 
finger-
exoskeleton WorkSpaces (WS) matching and worst case 
collision avoidance.  Since the HEXOSYS is attached to the 
finger at the mid of the middle phalange, this point is 
considered for matching WS.   
To 
increase 
the 
collision-free 
reachable 
WS 
of 
HEXOSYS, the first link (L1) shown in Figure 1 has been 
sub-divided into three segments (L1-1, L1-2 and L1-3) as 
illustrated in Figure 2.   
 
Fig. 2.  First link structure of HEXOSYS ensuring collision-free workspace 
 
These segment lengths are adjustable depending upon 
finger and hand size. Similarly the angle between first two 
sub-segments (θfixed) is also variable but is fixed for a 
certain finger and hand size. The objective of optimization 
algorithm is to find the optimum lengths of these three 
segments and angle (θfixed). The optimization algorithm 
takes the hand size and finger as inputs and gives these 
optimized values as an output. 
HEXOSYS link lengths have been iterated through 
reasonable range.  Each set of link lengths is then subjected 
to traverse through the complete finger WS for analysis. 
Using inverse kinematics, the set of link length is then 
analyzed to see how many points inside the finger WS, the 
exoskeleton can reach without collision. For collision 
detection, equidistant points (0.5cm apart) on the 
HEXOSYS links and the rectangular envelopes surrounding 
the finger centre of mass have been determined. An 
HEXOSYS link length set is considered as collision-free if 
all the points on the links reside outside the rectangular 
envelopes. Finally the collision-free WS is stored for 
comparison with the next iterated link lengths set. Figure 3 
shows the overall optimization strategy of HEXOSYS.  
 
IFig. 3.  Optimization strategy of HEXOSYS 
 
For a medium hand size, in case of index finger, the 
optimized segments have been found to be L1-1=8cm, L1-
2=2cm, L1-3=2cm and θfixed=55.4°. The corresponding WS is 
illustrated in Figure 4.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS 
  To collect necessary data for selecting the actuator, an 
analysis of the most common daily life activities of the hand 
has been carried. Included in this analysis are the 
experiments to measure average or maximum exerted force 
levels and the required range of motion. The data collected 
from these experiments can then be mapped to lower level 
actuator requirements. Commercially available data glove, a 
load cell and fingertip force sensors have been used to collect 
data from small, medium and big hand sizes in various 
activities. Detailed design requirements have been mentioned 
in [8]. Figures 5-6 show results of force profiles 
corresponding to interacting with a small and comparatively 
big object. The results of activities requiring average force 
levels demonstrate that we usually need 10-15N to 
accomplish many of our daily life activities. Another 
experiment intended to measure the maximum force levels 
exerted by human finger revealed that the maximum levels 
can go up to 45N.

DEVICE PROTOTYPE
Initially, an un-actuated finger prototype made up of 
ABS-plastic has been fabricated using a high
3D printer. The purpose was to verify the 
results and analyze the behavior of the selected mechanism 
(RR). Both revolute joints can be moved passively without 
imposing any unrealistic constraints. The prototype can be 
easily fastened and removed from the hand using a single 
velcro clip. The CAD design and snapshot of this initial 
prototype has been illustrated in Figure 7
