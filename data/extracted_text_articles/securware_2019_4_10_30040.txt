Abstract—This paper proposes a new multiple-image
encryption algorithm based on spectral fusion of images
and new chaotic generators. Logistic-May (LM), May-
Gaussian (MG) and Gaussian-Gompertz (GG) were used
as chaotic generators for their good properties in order
to correct the flaws of 1D chaotic maps (Logistic, May,
Gaussian, Gompertz) when used individually. Firstly,
the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) and the low-
passed filter of appropriate size are used to combine the
target images in the spectral domain in two different
multiplex images. Secondly, each of the two images is
concatenated into blocks of small size, which are mixed
by changing their position following the order generated
by a chaotic sequence from Logistic-May system (LM).
Finally, the fusion of both scrambled images is achieved
by
a
nonlinear
mathematical
expression
based
on
Cramer’s rule to obtain two hybrid encrypted images.
The security analysis and experimental simulations
confirmed that the proposed algorithm has a good
encryption performance; it can encrypt a large number
of images of different types while maintaining a reduced
Mean Square Error (MSE) after decryption.
Keywords—Spectral fusion; chaotic generators; image
encryption.

INTRODUCTION
Several
image
encryption
algorithms
are
being
developed today to meet privacy needs in multimedia
communications. With the rapid expansion of the Internet,
innovative technologies and cryptanalysis, it has become
necessary to build new and appropriate cryptosystems for
secured
data
transfer,
especially
for
digital
images.
Especially today, a large quantity of images is produced in
various fields and exchanged through different channels,
favouring the development of Multiple Images Encryption
(MIE) instead of Single Image Encryption (SIE).
In literature, many encryption algorithms, such as
International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard
(DES) have been proposed [1]. However, these standard
algorithms do not seem to be appropriate for image
encryption, because of the intrinsic features of images, such
as huge data capacity, high redundancy, strong correlation
among adjacent pixels and low entropy [2]. Some basic
properties of chaotic systems such as the sensitivity to the
initial condition and control parameters, sensitivity to plain
text,
ergodicity
and
randomness
behaviour,
meet
the
requirements
for
a
good
cryptosystem.
Consequently,
several cryptosystems were developed by researchers, based
on chaotic systems because the latter provided a good
combination of speed, high security, complexity, reasonable
computational overheads and computational power [3].
With these features, chaotic-based cryptosystems have
excellent properties of confusion and diffusion, which are
desirable in cryptography. Therefore, many techniques
involving different chaotic systems have been published [2]-
[12][23], and can be divided into one-dimensional (1D)
chaotic maps and high-dimensional (HD) chaotic maps.
Among the chaotic encryption algorithms developed,
the ones using a one-dimensional (1D) chaotic system like
Logistic, Tent, and Sine map have proven to have the
advantages of high-level efficiency, simplicity and high-
speed encryption. 1D chaotic structures have been widely
used [4] due to their simple structures, as opposed to the
complex ones of higher dimensional chaotic system (which
causes a relative slowness in computation). However, some
schemes using the 1D map have been broken due to their
weakness like non-uniform data output, small key space,
periodic data output, and poor ergodicity properties for
some ranges of control parameters [5][6]. To overcome this
drawback, some researchers state that the 1D chaotic map
should not be used alone [7][8]. Others proposed new 1D
chaotic systems with better properties like Spatiotemporal
chaos in [9], coupled with the 1D chaotic map [6], the

Nonlinear Chaotic map Algorithm (NCA) [10], and more
recently, nonlinear combinations of two different 1D chaotic
maps [3][11][12]. For example, Y. Abanda and A. Tiedeu
[3] combined outputs of Duffing and Colpitts chaotic
systems to encrypt grey and colour images. Y. P. Kamdeu
and A. Tiedeu [11] proposed a fast and secured encryption
scheme using new 1D chaotic systems obtained from
Logistic, May, Gaussian and Gompertz maps. In [12], M. A.
Chenaghlu et al. proposed a polynomial combination of 1D
chaotic maps for image encryption using dynamic functions
generation.
Recently, in order to increase the efficiency of
cryptosystems for multiple images, some authors proposed
algorithms integrating the concept of fusion or mixing
images as a step in the encryption process. Image fusion has
been proven to have potential for encryption in the spatial or
frequency domain. In the last 8 years, much effort has been
devoted to compressing and encrypting images at the same
time [13], which is considered as a new way of decreasing
the quantity of data to be transmitted and guarding the use
of data against unauthorized access. In particular, the
Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) is employed as a
useful tool for spectral fusion in most of these methods. The
widely used application DCT for image compression is
mainly based on its energy compaction property, which
means that the low-frequency coefficients are located
around the top-left corner of its spectral plane. In 2018, M.
Jridi and A. Alfalou [14] proposed an algorithm to enhance
an existing optical Simultaneous Fusion, Compression and
Encryption (SFCE) scheme [15] in terms of real-time
requirements,
bandwidth
occupation
and
encryption
robustness. In [16], S. Dongfeng et al. proposed a novel
technique for simultaneous fusion, imaging and encryption
of multiple objects using a single-pixel detector. This
algorithm achieves good performance in terms of robustness
as the number of images to multiplex increases, but suffered
from reduced key space and good quality of images
recovered. I. Mehra and N. K. Nishchal [17] proposed an
image fusion encryption based on wavelets for securing
multiple images through asymmetric keys. It offers a large
key space, which enhances the security of the system. In
2016, Y. Qin et al. [18] proposed an Optical Multiple-Image
Encryption scheme in diffractive imaging using spectral
fusion and nonlinear operations.
More recently, X. Zhang and X. Wang [19][20]
proposed
two
schemes
of
Multiple-Image
Encryption
(MIE): the first algorithm based on mixed image element
and permutation, and the second MIE algorithm based on
mixed image element and chaos. The cryptosystem shows
good performances, but can be improved in terms of
compression to reduce the size of the multiplex big image
when the number of target images increases. In [21], G. L.
Zhu and X. Q. Zhang proposed an encryption algorithm of
mixed
image
element
based
on
an
elliptic
curve
cryptosystem. Experimental results and theoretical analysis
show that the algorithm possesses a large key space and can
accomplish a high level of security concerning information
interaction on the network platform, but the encryption and
decryption computational time is long. In 2013, A. M.
Abdalla and A. A. Tamimi [22] proposed a new algorithm,
which mixes two or more images of different types and
sizes by using a shuffling procedure combined with S-box
substitution to perform a lossless image encryption. Here,
the process of mixing image combines stream cipher with
block cipher, on the byte level.
After analysing most MIE algorithms operating in the
spectral
domain,
the
robustness
of
the
cryptosystem
increases with the number of input images. Consequently,
the quality of decrypted images is degraded. Therefore, it is
important to design cryptosystems which can keep a good
compromise between a large number of images to encrypt, a
small MSE after decryption and a good performance in
terms of robustness and efficiency.
As a result, this paper suggests a new MIE algorithm
based on the spectral fusion of different types of images of
same size using Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT)
associated with a low-passed filter and chaotic maps. The
proposed scheme has several strengths: it is robust, uses
chaotic maps with good properties, encrypts a large number
of images into two hybrid ciphered images, and the quality
of the reconstructed images is good (reduced MSE). The
encryption process comprises three main steps: in the first
step, target images are fused into two images through DCT
and low-passed filter. In the second step, the small blocks
with the size of (4 X 4) images are permuted in a certain
order. In the last step, which is the diffusion phase, the two
scrambled images are fused by a nonlinear mathematical
expression based on Cramer’s rule to obtain two hybrid
encrypted images. The key generation of the cryptosystem is
made dependent on the plain images.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
presents an overview of chaotic generators used in the
cryptosystem while in Section 3, spectral fusion of plain
images is detailed. The proposed encryption/decryption
scheme is given in Section 4. In Section 5, experimental
results and algorithm analyses are presented, then compared
with others in the literature. We end with a conclusion in
Section 6.

Combination of new 1D chaotic maps
The chaotic properties of 1D Logistic, May, Gaussian
and Gompertz maps are not suitable to build a secure
cryptosystem when they are used alone. To solve this
problem, Y. Zhou et al. [23] proposed to combine the
different seed maps. Figure 1 shows the new map obtained
from a nonlinear combination of two different 1D chaotic
maps.

III.
SPECTRAL FUSION OF TARGET IMAGES
We consider N target images of size (
,
)
M M , which
are combined with two images, each containing 
/ 2
N
target images. As described in [24], Discrete Cosine
Transformation (DCT) is first applied separately to each of
the target images. Secondly, every spectrum is multiplied by
a low-passed filter, of size (M’, M’) pixels, positioned in its
upper left corner. In this way, a block containing the
relevant information for reconstructing every target image is
obtained. At this step, the compression rate Cr is:
Cr = 1 – (size of multiplexed DCT spectral plane) /size of N
inputs images
Cr = 1 – (M2 / NM2) = 1 – (1 / N)
(8)
Then, after all of these target images are grouped together
by a way of simple addition, the inverse Discrete Cosine
Transform (IDCT) of the multiplex image is performed. To
avoid information overlap, these blocks are shifted by a
rotation before spectral multiplexing. Figure 3 illustrates the
description of the process. It should be noted that the
capability of multiplexing can be increased by appropriately
selecting the filter size. The smaller the filter size is, the
more images can be multiplexed, but the quality of
recovered images may be worse. To keep a good quality of
reconstructed images while maintaining a large number of
target images to encrypt, we chose to group these images in
two multiplex images of the same size.
IV.
PROPOSED ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION SCHEME
This section presents the proposed cryptosystem, which
comprises blocks-permutation and diffusion steps using
Chaotic generators. Figure 4 illustrates the entire process.
A.
Blocks-Permutation
The plain image is each of the two multiplex images
obtained in Section 3. The plain image is decomposed into
small blocks of the same size; let us choose blocks size of
( 4
 4
) pixels. In fact, increasing the number of blocks by
using smaller block size resulted in a lower correlation and
higher entropy; then, the intelligible information contained
in the image will be reduced.
The permutation of blocks is realised as follows:
1.
Divide the plain image I of size M
 M
into k
blocks size of ( 4
 4
), with
4
4
M
M
k 

2.
Use initial condition and control parameters x01, r01
of Logistic-May system to generate a chaotic
sequence by iterating k times (5). The values of
the sequence X obtained are ranged in a row vector
P of size (1, )
k .
3.
Repeat step 2 to generate a new sequence, using
new initial condition and control parameters x02
and r02. This second sequence is to permute the
small blocks of the second multiplex image.
4.
Sort the chaotic sequence P in ascending order, and

The values x01, r01, x02, r02 are calculated through (9) and

(i=1,2) in two parts P1 and P2 of same size.

where, S1 is the sum of pixels’ intensities of the first part P1
of the multiplex image Ii, and S2 for P2.
x0 ϵ [0, 0.9], r ϵ [0, 4.9]. 
B.
Diffusion of the scrambled images
1)
Description of the fusion process
At this level, the two scrambled images are combined in
order to create the ﬁnal hybrid encrypted images that would 
be difficult to crack. The May-Gaussian and Gaussian-
Gompertz systems (6) and (7) are used as pseudo random
generators
to
generate
two
chaotic
sequences
after
2M*2M iterations. These values are arranged in two arrays
W and T of sizes 2M*2M, respectively, where M represents
the number of rows and columns of each scrambled image.
W and T are converted into real values in unit 8 format;
(W=uint8(W  255);
T=uint8(T  255)).
The
initial
conditions
and control parameters of the two pseudo
random numbers generators are xp1, rp1 and xp2, rp2, α,
respectively, for May-Gaussian and Gaussian-Gompertz
systems. These parameters are determined with (11) and
(12).
xpi = (x0 + 0.1mean (Ii)/256)
(11)
rpi = r + 0.1 [(min(Ii +1)/max(Ii +2)]
(12)
where mean (Ii) represents the average of the pixels’
intensities values of multiplex image Ii, (i=1,2); max (Ii) and
min (Ii) are, respectively, maximum and minimum pixel’s
intensities values of Ii. x0 ϵ [0, 0.9], r ϵ [0, 4.9]. 
The arrays W and T are divided into four sub-blocks of same
size M M.
The two scrambled images I1 and I2 are linearly combined
with the sub-blocks of W and T using the following
equations:
C1[i, j] = [(w11I1[i, j] +w12I2[i, j]) mod256
 floor(t11t21) 1015)]
(14)
C2[i, j] = [(w21I1[i, j] +w22I2[i, j]) mod256
 floor(t12t22) 1015)]
(15)
where C1[i, j] and C2[i, j] are the two encrypted hybrid
images of the cryptosystem, and  is the bit wise XOR
operator. The mixed product tij  tji in the above relations
enhances the quality of the merged images.
2)
Decryption process
At the receiver end, the encrypted images are first
decomposed using Cramer’s rule in order to recover the
scrambled images. Knowing the fusion keys (xp1, rp1, xp2,
rp2, α), the receiver can get the images I1 and I2 by solving
the system of equations below:

AND
ALGORITHM
ANALYSIS
Numerical simulation experiments have been carried
out to verify the proposed encryption method using
MATLAB 2016 b platform on a PC with Core (TM) i7-
353U processor of 2.5GHz. We first take 8 images with
512×512 pixels and 256 grey levels as the target images
to be encrypted, which are combined in two multiplex
images as shown in Figure 6 (a-h), respectively. The
compression ratio Cr is 0.75 for each multiplex image.
The size of low-passed filter is (M’, M’) = (256,256)
pixels. Results are analysed more in terms of statistical
attack, differential attack, quality of decrypted images and
speed. We chose the different values as keys of the
proposed cryptosystem:
x01 = 0.351482953177765;
x02 = 0.972970074275508;
r01 =4.988242173292221; r02 = 4.909240772131021; xp1
= 0.363606938668312; xp2 =
0.890363879273465; rp1 = 4.841585120587438; rp2 =
4.738149127386060;  = 6.187.
The size of the filter (M’, M’) and the number of
target images N constitute additional parameters of the
key.

2) Correlation analysis
In the encrypted image, there must be a very poor
correlation between neighbouring pixels in every direction,
for this one to resist statistical attack. The common method
is to calculate the correlation coefficient Cr of randomly
chosen 5000 pairs of pixels in horizontal (HC), vertical
(VC) and diagonal (DC) direction using (17).

where X and Y are grey scale values of two adjacent pixels

value of correlation belonging to the range [-1, 1]. Cr tends
to be 1 or -1 for strong correlation and tends to be 0 for
every poor correlation.

For a 256-grayscale image, the pixel data has 28 possible
values and the ideal entropy of a true random image must be
8. Table 2 shows entropy values of some images of the
proposed encryption algorithm very close to 8, as expected.

Key analysis
             Key space size is the total number of diﬀerent keys 
that can be used in an encryption algorithm. A good
encryption algorithm needs to contain suﬃciently large 
key space to make the brute-force attack infeasible. The
high sensitive to initial conditions inherent to any
chaotic system, i.e., exponential divergence of chaotic
trajectories, ensure high security.

According to [19], a key size of 1030 is sufficient. The
proposed encryption algorithm actually does have some
of the following secret keys: the initial values x01, x02, xp1,
xp2 and control parameters r01, r02, rp1, rp2 and  of the
chaotic systems used; the number N of target images and
the size
'
'
M
 M
of the filter. We suppose that the
computer precision is 10-15, so the key space is greater
than 1015  9 = 10135. Therefore, this key space is large
enough to resist the brute-force attack. Moreover, key
sensitivity analysis has been carried out, but the results
are not presented here for reasons of space. These results
confirm that by changing only one bit in any parameter of
the key, it is not possible to recover the plain images.

Sensitivity analysis
1)
Differential attack analysis
An excellent encryption algorithm should have the
desirable property of spreading the inﬂuence of slight 
change to the plain text over as much of the cipher text as
possible. The sensitivity of a cryptosystem is evaluated
through Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR) (19) and
Unified Average Change Intensity (UACI) (20) criteria,
which consist in testing the influence of one-pixel change
of a plain image in the resulting cipher image.

Table 3 gives the measurement of NCPR and UACI
between two cipher images of cameraman, Lena and
peppers, when a Least Significant Bit (LSB) changed on
grey value in the last pixel’s position. We can notice that
the values obtained are around the mean of 99.61 for
NCPR and 33.49 for UACI. This result shows that a slight
change to the original images will result in a great change
in all the encrypted images. The results also imply that the
proposed algorithm has an excellent ability to resist the
differential attack.

Quality of reconstructed images
As the number of target images to encrypt increases,
the quality of recovered images decreases. In order to
reduce the NMSE between plain and decrypted images
and enlarge the number of target images, we grouped
them into two multiplexed images before encryption. To
evaluate quantitatively the quality of decrypted image, we
used the normalized mean square error (NMSE) between
the original image and the decrypted image. The NMSE is
defined as:

where M×N are the size of the image, ID(i, j) and IE(i, j)
are the values of the decrypted image and the original
image at the pixel (i, j), respectively. Table 4 presents the
values of NMSE of a 512

Lena image for different
total number of target images. From this table, we can
observe that for N=16 target images combined in one
multiplex image, i.e., 32 images to encrypt by the
proposed cryptosystem, the NMSE is still reduced, which
attests the good quality of reconstructed images and good
performances of the proposed cryptosystem.

Encryption/decryption time
Table 5 reports a comparison of encryption time by

literature for different images. The algorithm written
under Matlab platform was not optimized. The computer
time consumption is 0.27389 s, which is smaller than
those of [19][24].

CONCLUSION
In this paper, an image encryption algorithm based
on spectral fusion of multiple images and new chaotic
generators is proposed. Logistic-May (LM), Gaussian-
Gompertz (GG) and May-Gaussian (MG) systems were
used as chaotic generators in the processes of confusion
and diffusion. The target images were firstly combined in
two multiplex images of same size through DCT and a
Low-passed filter. Secondly, the previous images are
scrambled by permuting the blocks size of ( 4
 4
) of each
multiplex image. Finally, the later scrambled images are
fused by a nonlinear mathematical expression based on
Cramer’s rule to obtain two hybrid encrypted images. The
evaluation metrics of the proposed cryptosystem NCPR,
UACI, correlation coefficient, entropy, key space and
NMSE are amongst the best values in literature. More
interestingly, the proposed cryptosystem can encrypt 32
target
images
simultaneously
with
a
small
NMSE
 3.710-3, and encrypted images are sensitive to the key.
The proposed encryption algorithm can surely guarantee
security and speed of all types of digital data transfer in a
digital network.
