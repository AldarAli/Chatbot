Abstract—Most of human body regulation is controlled by the 
autonomic nervous system (ANS). The activities of ANS 
influence the human health, therefore, how to observe the 
proper activity of ANS in time is important. Heart rate 
variability (HRV) is generally a common and widely non-
invasive used method for indicating the activities of ANS. 
However, electrocardiography (ECG) used for HRV analysis is 
not suitable for homecare. Pulse rate variability (PRV) of 
photoplethysmography (PPG) is a surrogate method for HRV 
of ECG. Furthermore, PPG is easier and more convenient to 
use at home. Whether using HRV or PRV, there still remains 
some limitations because of the timescale which causes the 
frequency domain analysis restricted to only 0.5 Hz. For 
breaking the limitations, a novel method instantaneous pulse 
rate variability (iPRV) was proposed. The previous study had 
shown the difference between fever patients and normal people 
by using iPRV analysis. Nevertheless, it did not compare the 
result of iPRV to the conventional method. The aim of this 
study is to examine that iPRV can not only indicate the 
activities of ANS as PRV but provide more information. The 
result of this study shows the conventional indexes have no 
significant difference between PRV and iPRV. But the 
modified indexes including the very high frequency band (VHF) 
computed by PRV are different to the one computed by iPRV. 
The power of VHF is much greater in iPRV than PRV. This 
band as an indicator may contain more information about the 
body regulation. In this study, using iPRV as a method in 
homecare has more efficiency.

decomposition (EMD); Instantaneous PRV (iPRV). 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
There are various mechanisms for regulating the human 
body. Many of them are dominated by the autonomic 
nervous system (ANS). The ANS contains sympathetic (SNS) 
and parasympathetic (PNS). The balance between SNS and 
PNS is important to maintain health of human. It influences 
the health when the activities of ANS are not stable [1].   
Heart rate variability (HRV) is generally a common and 
widely non-invasive used method for indicating the activities 
of ANS [2]. Electrocardiography (ECG) signal is acquired to 
calculate the beat-to-beat interval (RRI) for HRV analysis 
(Fig 1(a)). But, ECG measurement is too inconvenient to use 
in the home. It is not suitable for homecare.  
Compared to ECG, photoplethysmography (PPG) is 
easier and more convenient to use in the home [3]. It is 
called pulse rate variability (PRV) if applying the PPG signal 
instead of ECG to calculate the peak-to-peak interval (PPI) 
for HRV analysis (Fig 1(b)). Though the ECG signal and 
PPG signal have the difference because of the pulse 
transition time (PTT) between RRI and PPI, many studies 
have determined that PRV can act as a surrogate of HRV 
during some conditions [4].  
Nevertheless, the timescale of RRI and PPI have a 
limitation. It causes the frequency band of HRV or PRV 
spectrum analysis to be restricted to about only 0.5 Hz [5].  
For breaking the limitation, instantaneous pulse rate 
variability (iPRV) was proposed [6]. iPRV adopted PRV 
technique and applied the frequency range extension method 
based on Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [7]. HHT can deal 
with the non-stationary and nonlinear data by the pre-process, 
called empirical mode decomposition (EMD). However, the 
intermittency phenomenon, which called mode mixing

problem is involved in EMD. The noise-assisted method 
called ensemble EMD (EEMD) was proposed to solve this 
problem [8]. 
The previous study had compared the difference between 
the fever patients and normal people by iPRV spectrum 
analysis [9]. The aim of this study is to compare the iPRV 
spectrum result of the previous study [9] to PRV result to 
examine iPRV is useful and reliable for observing the 
activities of ANS. Besides this, the iPRV has more 
information in embedded in higher frequency band than PRV. 
II. 
MATERIA AND METHOD 
A. Subjects and data collection 
The experiment was carried out in Yo-Yo Clinic, 
Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The body temperature was measured by 
ear thermometer (Radiant TH889, Radiant Innovation Inc.) 
and the signal was acquired by PPG (Nonin 8500, Nonin 
Medical Inc.) with 200 Hz sampling rate. 
30 subjects were recruited in this study. 15 subjects 
whose body temperature are higher than 37.9 °C serve as 
fever group, others serve as normal group. All subjects were 
measured the body temperature before acquiring the PPG 
signal. The subjects were required to rest quietly in supine 
position when the PPG signal acquiring for 10 minutes. This 
experiment was approved by the institutional review board 
of the National Chiao Tung University. Informed consent 
was obtained from all subjects before the experiment. 
B. PRV procedure 
The procedure PRV is shown in Fig 2. First, finding out 
the peaks in each pulse cycle. Second, calculating the PPI 
series by the interval between each peak and interpolating to 
200 samples per second. Last, transforming the PPI series to 
power spectrum by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and 
calculating the power of each band.  
C. iPRV procedure 
There are many steps of the iPRV procedure [6]. First, it 
uses EMD to decompose the PPG signal to many intrinsic 
mode functions (IMFs) [7]. The algorithm of EMD is shown 
in Fig 3. However, because of the mode mixing problem 
involve in the EMD, the EEMD was used in this study. The 
procedure of EEMD is shown in Fig 4. [8]. After 
decomposition, one of the IMFs which was sinusoid-like is 
considered as the heartbeats component. This IMF is used 
for calculating the instantaneous frequency (IF) by 
normalized direct quadrature (NDQ) [10]. The procedure of 
NDQ is shown in Fig 5. The iPRV uses the inversion of IF 
called iPeriod to calculate the power spectrum by FFT. The 
whole procedure of iPRV is shown in Fig 6. The spectral

were developed by using a commercial software platform 
(LabVIEW version 2013, National Instruments Corp., Austin, 
USA). 
 
D. Iindex calculating 
The standard of bandwidth of low frequency band (LF) is 
between 0.04 Hz and 0.15 Hz and high frequency band (HF) 
is between 0.15 Hz and 0.4 Hz [11]. The conventional 
indexes of normalized power (nLF and nHF) and LF-HF 
ratio are calculated as follows. 

nLF = 100% * (LF / (LF + HF)),           

 
nHF = 100% * (HF / (LF + HF)), and 
(2) 
 
LF-HF ratio = 100% * (LF / HF). 
(3) 
  For calculating including very high frequency band 
(VHF), we assume the bandwidth of VHF is from 0.4 Hz to 
0.5 Hz in PRV and 0.4 Hz to 0.9 Hz in iPRV. The modified 
indexes are calculated as follows. 
 
nLFa = 100% * (LF / (LF + HF + VHF)), 
(4) 
 
nHFa = 100% * (HF / (LF + HF + VHF)), and 
(5) 
 
nVHF = 100% * (VHF / (LF + HF + VHF)). 
(6) 
Each abbreviation, LF, HF and VHF in equations 
presents the power of each frequency band.  
E. Statistic analysis 
Homogeneity test was used to test the distribution of each 
index calculated by PRV and iPRV is homogeneity or not 
before independent t-test.  Independent t-test was used to 
compare the significant difference between each index 
calculated by PRV and iPRV. P value of <0.05 was 
considered significant. All statistical analysis was performed 
by using commercial statistics software (IBM SPSS statistics, 
version 22.0.0.0, IBM corp., New York, USA).

There is no significant difference in nLF and nHF 
between PRV and iPRV. If calculating including VHF, each 
index in PRV is significantly different to the one in iPRV 
whether in normal group or fever group. However, each 
index whether computed including VHF or not, they have 
the same trend in PRV and iPRV. For example, comparing to 
normal group, nLF increased in fever group whether 
calculated by PRV or iPRV. Nevertheless, the value of 
nVHF is much larger in iPRV than PRV, we discuss it in the 
next section. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
The conventional indexes, nLF, nHF and LF-HF ratio, 
calculating by HRV usually present the activities of ANS 
[2][11]. The PRV can be used as an alternative measurement 
of the HRV [4]. So, nLF, nHF and LF-HF ratio are useful for 
indicating the activities of ANS by PRV. Besides this, the 
result of this study also shows the value of nLF, nHF and 
LF-HF ratio calculated by iPRV are no significant difference 
to PRV. Therefore,  nLF, nHF and LF-HF ratio calculated by 
iPRV can also indicate the activities of ANS. For modified 
indexes in this study, because of the narrow bandwidth of 
VHF in PRV, nLFa and nHFa are similar to the conventional 
indexes. Otherwise, the power of VHF is much larger in 
iPRV. VHF band may contain more information about not 
only activity of ANS but more body regulation.  
Some studies have assumed that VHF has the possible 
meaning of cardiac output or peripheral circulation 
[6][12][13]. Another study also shows the VHF band has 
potential to evaluate fluid responsiveness [14]. In addition, 
the previous study had compared the difference between 
normal people and fever patient and discussed the 
relationship between some thermoregulation and each index 
[9]. However, it still needs more experiments to examine the 
meaning of VHF.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
This study has shown the reliability of the conventional 
indexes in iPRV. Moreover, the ultra-band, VHF, computed 
by iPRV contains more information about the body 
regulation for monitor. iPRV uses the convenient and easy 
measurement for signal acquiring, but provide more 
information than PRV. iPRV has a potential to be a better 
monitor of health status for homecare.
