Abstract—A directional sensor network is composed of many 
directional sensor nodes. Unlike conventional omni-directional 
sensors that always have an omni-angle of sensing range; 
directional sensors may have a limited angle of sensing range 
due to technical constraints or cost considerations. Area 
coverage is still an essential issue in a directional sensor 
network. In this paper, we study the area coverage problem in 
directional sensor networks with mobile sensors, which can 
move to the correct places to get high coverage. We present 
distributed self-deployment schemes of mobile sensors. After 
sensors are randomly deployed, each sensor calculates its next 
new location to move in order to obtain a better coverage than 
previous one. The locations of sensors are adjusted round by 
round so that the coverage is gradually improved. Based on the 
virtual force of the directional sensors, we design a scheme, 
namely Virtual force scheme. Simulation results show the 
effectiveness of our scheme in term of the coverage 
improvement.

 INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, wireless sensor networks have received a 
lot of attention due to their wide applications in military and 
civilian operations, such as fire detection [1], vehicle traffic 
monitoring [2], ocean monitoring [3], and battlefield 
surveillance [4]. In wireless sensor networks, target coverage 
is a fundamental problem and has been studied by many 
researchers. Most of the past work is always based on the 
assumption of omni-directional sensors that has an omni-
angle of sensing range. However, there are many kinds of 
directional sensors, such as video sensors [5], ultrasonic 
sensors [6] and infrared sensors [7]. The omni-directional 
sensor node has a circular disk of sensing range. The 
directional sensor node has smaller sensing area (sector-like 
area) and sensing angle than the omni-directional one. 
Compared to isotropic sensors, the coverage region of a 
directional sensor is determined by its location and 
orientation. This can be illustrated by the example shown in 
Figure 1. 
Area coverage is a fundamental problem in wireless 
sensor networks. Therefore, sensor nodes must be deployed 
appropriately to reach an adequate coverage level for the 
successful completion of the issued sensing tasks [8][9]. 
However, in many potential working environments, such as 
remote harsh fields, disaster areas, and toxic urban regions, 
sensor 
deployment 
cannot 
be 
performed 
manually. 
Deploying sensors by aircraft may result in the situation that 
the 
actual 
landing 
positions 
cannot 
be 
controlled. 
Consequently, the coverage may be inferior to the 
application requirements no matter how many sensors are 
dropped. In such a situation, it may need to make the mobile 
sensors to move to the correct positions for the required 
coverage.

region 
Most previous research efforts on deploying mobile 
sensors are based on the omni-directional sensor networks. 
For example, Howard et al. [10] present a distributed, 
potential-field-based approach to solve the coverage problem. 
In their approach, sensor nodes are treated as virtual particles 
that are subject to force, these forces repel the neighboring 
sensor nodes from each other and from obstacles. Finally, 
sensor nodes will spread from dense to sparse area. The 
concept of potential-field was first proposed in the research 
of mobile robotic route plan and obstacle avoidance by 
Khatib [11]. In [12], Wang et al. present a set of Voronoi 
diagram-based schemes to maximize sensing coverage. After 
discovering a coverage hole locally, the schemes calculate 
new position for each sensor to move at next round. They 
use the Voronoi diagram to discover the coverage holes and 
design three movement-assisted sensor deployment schemes: 
VECtor-based (VEC), VORonoi-based (VOR), and Minimax. 
In [13], Lee et al. designs two movement-assisted schemes: 
Centroid-based and Dual-Centroid-based. Based on the 
Voronoi diagram and centroid (geometric center), the 
proposed schemes can be used to improve the sensing 
coverage.

In this paper, we study the problem of coverage by 
directional mobile sensor under the random deployment 
strategy. We develop a solution that maximizes the sensing 
coverage while minimizing the computation time in term of 
rounds. Based on the virtual force of directional sensors, we 
design a moving algorithm: the Virtual Force scheme. 
Simulation results show that our distributed algorithm is 
effective in terms of coverage, deployment time, and 
movement. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 
2, we introduce some preliminaries. In Section 3, we state 
the problem formally and make some assumptions regarding 
the problem. We present our scheme in Section 4. Section 5 
shows some simulation results. Finally, we conclude this 
paper in Section 6.

PRELIMINARIES 
A. Directional Sensing Model 
Compared to an omni-directional sensor which has a 
circular disk of sensing range, a directional sensor has 
smaller sensing area (sector-like area) and sensing angle. 
This can be best illustrated in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, 
the sensing region of a directional sensor is a sector denoted 
by a 3-tuple (α, β, R), and the sensing region is called sensing 
sector. Here R is the sensing radius, α is the sensing angle, 
and β is the offset angle.

β
R

B. Virtual Force Point 
We assume that there are many virtual force points 
around the boundary of sensing sector, as shown in Figure 3. 
Without loss of generality, we assume that there are 3m + 1 
virtual force points of each sensor, in which there are m 
points on the arc, m points on each of the both straight 
boundary lines of sensing sector, and sensor point itself. We 
denoted the virtual force points of si, as pik, where 1  k  3m 
+ 1. As shown in Figure 3, there are total 35 + 1 virtual 
force points, in which there are 5 points on the arc and on 
both straight boundary lines respectively. Each virtual force 
point on sensors can receive a repulsive force from other 
sensors.  
It should be noticed that, as shown in Figure 4, the more 
virtual force points a directional sensor has, the more 
repulsive force that exerted on the directional sensor by its 
neighboring directional sensors. By applying all of the 
repulsive forces from its neighbors, the directional sensor 
can be repelled from dense to sparse area.

(b) Ten virtual force points of a

Illustration of two different number of virtual force points 
It also should be noticed that, the more virtual force 
points a sensor has, the more accurate repulsive force can be 
applied. In Figure 4(a), the directional sensor sj has the 
overlapped region with directional sensor si, which implies 
that sensor si should be repelled by the sensor sj. However, 
sensor sj will not exert a repulsive force on si because that 
sensor sj does not cover any virtual force point of sensor si. 
On the contrary, in Figure 4(b), we can see that sensor sj has 
covered one virtual force point of si. Therefore, sensor sj 
would exert a repulsive force on si. 
III. 
PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Problem: Randomly deploying N mobile directional 
sensors with sensing range Rs and sensing angle α in a given 
target sensing region, we are asked to maximize the sensor 
coverage with less time. 
To address the above problem, we need to make the 
following assumptions: 
 
All directional sensors have the same sensing range 
(Rs) and sensing angle α, where        
 . 
Directional sensors within 2Rs of a sensor are called 
the sensor’s neighboring nodes. 
 
Directional sensors can move to arbitrary orientation, 
but its sensing direction is not rotatable. 
 
Each sensor knows its location information and 
determines the locations of its neighboring sensors. 
 
The target region is on a two-dimensional plane with 
no obstacle. The boundary of target region can be 
regarded as a wall-like obstacle.

IV. 
THE PROPOSED MOVING SCHEME 
In order to maximize the sensor coverage, we present a 
moving scheme for directional mobile sensors, namely the 
Virtual Force scheme. 
A. Virtual Force Scheme 
The Virtual Force scheme employs the repulsive force 
between a directional sensor and each of its neighboring 
sensors as a basis of movement. The virtual force occurred 
on a directional sensor is basically generated by the repulsive 
force between each of its virtual force point and each of its 
neighboring sensor. The main idea of virtual force scheme 
aims to repelling a sensor node by its neighboring sensors 
from dense area to sparse area. We assume that Cij is the set 
of virtual force points of si that are covered by its 
neighboring sensor sj. When sensors si and sj are overlapped, 
they will repel each other by the overlapped region. We 
denote repulsive force occurred on sensor si, which is caused 
by sensor sj as    
     . Then,    
      can be obtained as follows. If 
sensor sj is located inside the sensing sector of si, sj will act 
as a repulsive force from the virtual force point pik to the 
sensor sj, in which pik is the virtual force point of si that has 
the maximal distance to sj, according to the following 
equation: 
 
   
           
                                                  
 
If sensor sj is outside the sensing sector of si, sj will act as a 
repulsive force from sensor sj to the virtual force point pik, in 
which pik has the minimal distance to sj, according to the 
following equation: 
   
      
  
      
                    
                  
           where pik  Cij and d(pik, sj) 
is minimal. 
Figure 5 illustrates an example of the repulsion model. 
From Figure 5(a), we can observe that sj is outside the 
sensing sector of si, and pi2 has the minimal distance to sj and 
         . So, the repulsive force exerts on si is    
      
  
      
              
      
                 
         . In Figure 5(b), sj is inside the sensing sector 
of si and pi2 has the maximal distance to sj and          . So, 
the repulsive force exert on Si is    
           
         .

B. Virtual Force Moving algorithm 
According to the repulsion model, we can compute the 
repulsive forces of each sensor. Then the resultant repulsive 
force of each sensor is the direction of the new position that 
sensor should move toward. Figure 6 shows an example that 
the sensor move toward the direction of the new position 
with its resultant repulsive force. After repelling by its 
repulsive force, it really can decrease the overlapped region.

Illustration of moving direction from resultant repulsive forces 
In order to save energy, we observe that each sensor does 
not need to move too far to have better coverage. Thus, in 
our proposed moving strategy, we take the resultant 
repulsive force as the moving direction and the moving 
distance is fixed to radius/5 or radius/4. Figure 7 shows the 
effect of our moving strategy. As shown in Figure 7(a), the 
coverage of moving longer distance (i.e. repulsive force) is 
better than that of moving shorter distance (i.e. radius/5). 
However, the total moving distance of using radius/5 is 
significantly better than that of using repulsive force, as 
shown in Figure 7(b).

The movement procedure can be stated as follows: First, 
the directional sensor determines the direction of movement 
by the repulsion model. Then the directional sensor checks if 
the overlapped region with neighboring sensors is decreased 
by moving to the new destination. If the overlapped region is 
decreased, the directional sensor will start to move; 
otherwise, it will stay. The above procedure is called the 
New-movement-adjustment scheme. Figure 8 illustrates an 
example of New-movement-adjustment scheme. Then we 
add an oscillation control on the movement. The purpose of 
oscillation control is to prevent the sensor from moving back 
and forth, as shown in Figure 9.

Illustration of the oscillation control 
Furthermore, we proposed a move-back scheme to 
prevent sensors move out of the target region. If the virtual 
force point of a sensor is out of the target region, sensor 
should move to the new position until its virtual force point 
is located on the boundary of the target region as shown in 
Figure 10. From Figure 10(a), we can see that the virtual 
points A and B are outside the target region. So, we should 
move these two virtual points into the target region. This can 
be done by moving down the sensor with the distance 
between the virtual point A and the boundary b1. After the 
movement, the virtual point A will be just located on the 
boundary of the target region as shown in Figure 10(b). 
Furthermore, the virtual point B is also outside the target 
region. Thus, the directional sensor will move right with the 
distance from B to the boundary b2. After that, the virtual 
point B will be also located on the boundary of the target 
region as shown in Figure 10(c). In Figure 10(d), the sensing 
sector of the directional sensor will be all inside the target 
region after moving to the new position. After determining 
the new position to move, the directional sensor will execute 
the New-movement-adjustment until new position is reached. 
Finally, the proposed moving scheme will stop when it 
achieves the maximum number of rounds. The complete 
procedure of Virtual Force Moving algorithm is shown in 
Figure 11.

We utilize a case to illustrate the Virtual Force scheme. 
As shown in Figure 12, we have 100 directional sensors 
which are randomly deployed in a region of 500×500 m2. For 
each directional sensor, the sensing radius is 60 m and the 
sensing angle is 90o. In Figure 12(a), the initial coverage rate 
is 61.5712 %. After Round 1 (Figure 12(b)) and Round 2 
(Figure 12(c)), it can be seen that the coverage ratios are 
increased to 71.3436% and 76.2856%, respectively.

SIMULATION RESULTS 
In this section, we simulate and analyze the performance 
of Virtual Force scheme from two aspects: coverage and 
moving distance. Each simulation is executed 10 times then 
gets the average value. The simulation program is written by 
C# programming language on .NET platform. We deployed 
100 directional sensor of a region of 500×500 m2 in our 
simulation. The sensing radius is 60 m, the, the sensing angle 
is 90o and the number of virtual force point around the 
boundary of sensing sector is 31. Experimental environment 
is shown in Table 1.

The first experiment examines the effect that the number 
of rounds makes to the performance of coverage rate of our 
proposed approach on different number of virtual force 
points. Figure 13 shows the results. In Figure 13, we can see 
that the more virtual force point a directional sensor has, the 
more target region can be covered. Thus, we set the number 
of virtual force points to be 31 in the following experiments. 
 
 
Figure 13. Coverage rate vs. number of rounds 
The second experiment evaluates the effect that the 
number of rounds makes to the performance of accumulated 
coverage rate of our moving algorithm with 31 virtual force 
points. Figure 14 shows the results. We can see that our 
proposed virtual force scheme can increase the coverage rate 
effectively as rounds increase. This is due to that the 
directional sensors repel each others from dense to sparse 
area. Therefore, as rounds increase, the mobile sensors will 
move to the sparse area. As a result, the coverage holes in the 
sparse area will be reduced and coverage rate will be 
increased.

Figure 14. Coverage rate vs. number of rounds – 31 virtual force points 
The final experiment examines the effect that the number 
of rounds makes to the performance of accumulated moving 
distance of our moving algorithm with 31 virtual force points. 
Figure 15 shows the results.  
 
 
Figure 15. Moving distance vs. number of rounds – 31 virtual force points 
We can see that our proposed virtual force scheme will 
increase the moving distance as rounds increase. This is due 
to that our approach will move mobile sensors to the sparse 
area in order to cover the hole area. Therefore, as rounds 
increase, the moving distance will be increased as well.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we define a new problem regarding how to 
maximize the area coverage with less moving distance by 
mobile directional sensors. We propose a scheme, namely 
the Virtual Force scheme, to improve the coverage. We 
adopt the virtual force points as the basis of repulsion. Then 
directional sensor can move toward new position to get 
better coverage by this repulsion. Simulation results show 
that virtual force scheme will increase the area coverage 
round by round, and the moving distance will be increased 
when the coverage increases. Specifically, the improvement 
can be obtained by our proposed Virtual Force scheme up to 
30% coverage rate more than initial random deployment.
