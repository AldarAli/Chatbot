Abstract — 60 GHz has attracted a lot of commercial interest due 
to its abundance of unlicensed frequency spectrum and the recent 
advances in building inexpensive transceivers. IEEE 802.11 has 
started a new Task Group, 802.11ad, to develop a 60 GHz PHY 
and MAC that can deliver at least 1Gbps MAC throughput. The 
802.11ad amendment is also required to enable seamless session 
switch between the existing 2.4/5 GHz and the new 60 GHz radio. 
This paper proposes the system concept of multi-band gigabit 
mesh networks that can potentially satisfy the requirements set 
out in 802.11ad. The benefits of multi-band gigabit mesh 
networks are presented, including the diversity gain, range 
extension and spatial reuse gain. In particular, a 2-hop 60 GHz 
mesh is simulated for an office WLAN example to demonstrate 
that the spatial reuse gain can be very significant in 60 GHz mesh 
networks thanks to the nature of the highly directional 
beamformed links. Such high degree of spatial reuse can 
significantly improve the end to end network throughput of a 
multi-hop mesh network while providing reasonable range. The 
key challenges for the multi-band gigabit mesh are also discussed 
along with some open research questions for future work.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The abundance of bandwidth in the unlicensed 60 GHz 
band (57-66 GHz band, also known as the millimeter-wave 
band) has attracted more and more interest from both the 
research community and the industry [1-11] in recent years for 
short range indoor wireless communications including both 
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) and Wireless Local 
Area Networks (WLAN). Recent advances [12] of using SiGe 
and CMOS to build inexpensive 60 GHz transceiver 
components has created commercial interest to productize and 
standardize 60 GHz radio technology for mass market 
applications.  
This higher frequency band comes with a larger free space 
propagation loss which must be compensated for by high gain 
directional antennas. Fortunately, high gain directional 
antennas are feasible to implement even for small form factor 
devices due to the shorter wavelengths (5 mm).  
60GHz channel generally exhibits quasi-optical properties, 
meaning the strongest components tend to be Line of Sight 
(LOS). Non Line of Sight (NLOS) components do exist, mostly 
in the form of reflection. However, the short wavelengths in 
this band impose some serious challenges such as greater signal 
diffusion and difficulty diffracting around obstacles. 60 GHz 
band measurements [13] show that in general, the strongest 
reflected components are at least 10 dB below the line of sight 
(LOS) component. Even more challenging are the problems 
caused by obstructions. A human body walking into the path 
between the transmitter and the receiver can attenuate the 
signal by 15 dB or more and easily break the link. Common 
objects such as furniture, walls, doors and floors found in 
indoor environments can also be problematic. As a result, the 
practical indoor operation range at 60 GHz is likely to be 
limited by penetration loss instead of free space propagation 
loss and therefore mostly confined to a single room. In 
comparison, the link characteristics are very different in the 
lower frequency bands such as 2.4/5 GHz, where penetration 
loss is less, rich multi-path exists to provide diversity, and the 
range can reach up to hundreds of meters. Millions of users 
have come to enjoy the convenience of broadband wireless 
access thanks to 802.11-based WLAN technology (aka Wi-Fi) 
in the home, office and hotspots. It is commonplace for Wi-Fi 
users to experience link quality fluctuations and even link 
outage, but typically not just because someone walks by. As 
most wireless users don’t really care about or even know the 
difference between RF bands, it will be natural for the users to 
compare their usage experience of 60 GHz products with that 
of Wi-Fi. While higher throughput will enhance the user 
experience, other factors such as ease-of-use, robustness and 
range will also significantly affect the experience. We believe 
delivering satisfactory range and robustness along with gigabit 
level performance is one of the most important challenges for 
MAC and system design at 60 GHz, and that is the motivation 
behind the concept of multi-band gigabit mesh networks 
proposed in this paper.  
This paper proposes the system design concept of multi-
band gigabit mesh networks and articulates why this may 
significantly improve the user experience with 60 GHz 
technology. The focus of the paper is on quantifying the benefit 
of such concept instead of the protocol design and 
implementation details.  
Section II briefly surveys the multiple standardization 
efforts taking place today, including the newly formed IEEE 
802.11ad Task Group. Section III compares the data rate and 
range tradeoff at 5 and 60 GHz and show the complementary 
nature of these bands. Such complementary nature of 2.4/5 and 
60 GHz bands motivates the design concept of multi-band 
gigabit mesh networks. Section IV introduces the concept of 
multi-band gigabit mesh, presents the target usages for this 
concept and the benefits. Spatial reuse in 60 GHz mesh is 
especially significant due to the nature of highly directional 
beamformed links, and detailed simulation results are presented 
for an office scenario as an example in Section V. Section VI 
contrasts our proposal with some of the prior work. Section VII 
highlights new design and research challenges in the

framework of multi-band Gigabit mesh and Section VIII 
concludes the paper. 
II. 
60GHZ STANDARD EFFORTS 
Several international standard bodies have ongoing 
standard development efforts for 60 GHz specifications. 
ECMA TC48 [6, 14] has completed a 60 GHz PHY and MAC 
standard specification to provide high rate WPAN transport. 
The usage cases are high definition (uncompressed or lightly 
compressed) AV streaming, wireless docking station and short 
range sync-n-go. The IEEE 802.15.3c Task Group [7] is also in 
the process of developing a millimeter-wave-based alternative 
PHY for the existing 802.15.3 WPAN Standard 802.15.3-2003. 
This mmWave WPAN will support at least 1 Gbps and 
optionally 2 Gbps for applications such as high speed internet 
access, streaming content download, multiple real time HDTV 
video streams and wireless data bus for cable replacement.  
The IEEE 802.11 working group began a new “Very High 
Throughput” study group (VHT SG) [10] in 2007 to investigate 
technologies beyond 802.11n capabilities for WLAN. The Wi-
Fi Alliance (WFA) was consulted to develop the usages for 
VHT SG and the six categories of usages envisioned [17] 
include wireless display, in home distribution of video, rapid 
upload and download to and from a remote server, mesh or 
point-to-point 
backhaul 
traffic, 
campus 
or 
auditorium 
deployments, and manufacturing floor automation. Two 802.11 
Task Groups have been formed toward the end of 2008 as a 
result of the work done by VHT SG. One of the two Task 
Groups, 802.11ad, is chartered to define standardized 
modifications to both the 802.11 physical layers (PHY) and 
Medium Access Control Layer (MAC) to enable operation in 
the 60 GHz frequency band capable of at least 1 Gbps, as 
measured at the MAC data service access point (SAP). The 
802.11ad amendment will also enable fast session transfer 
between 60 GHz and 2.4/5 GHz PHYs. The fast session 
transfer between 60 GHz and 2.4/5 GHz PHYs will distinguish 
802.11ad solution from the others including ECMA TC48 and 
IEEE 802.15.3c. 
The system concept of multi-band gigabit mesh network 
proposed in this paper is largely motivated by the objectives of 
802.11ad to leverage both the existing 802.11 (a.k.a. Wi-Fi) 
solutions in 2.4/5 GHz and the new solution in 60 GHz band to 
reach gigabit level performance for WLAN and WPAN 
applications. 
III. 
RANGE AND PEROFRMANCE TRADEOFF IN 5 AND 60 
GHZ BANDS 
In order to understand the motivation and benefits of multi-
band gigabit mesh networks, let us first examine the 
propagation characteristics and channel properties of 60 GHz 
band in comparison with that of 5 GHz.  
Using the log-distance path loss model [20], the average 
path loss 
PL(d)
 between a transmitter and a receiver separated 
by d (m) can be calculated as follows

where d0 is the close-in reference distance, λ is the wavelength, 
and n is the path-loss exponent. The penetration loss of a non-
LOS (NLOS) environment is abstracted as a larger path loss 
exponent. In [19], the 60GHz channel measurements show that 
n is approximately 3.5 for NLOS and 2 for LOS at 60 GHz; the 
path loss exponent is only 2.6 for NLOS at 5 GHz.  
Although 60 GHz experiences much higher path loss than 
the 5 GHz band, the very short wavelength makes it possible to 
integrate a very large number of antennas (e.g. 36 antenna 
elements) in a very small area and use the array antenna for 
beamforming to compensate for the additional 20 dB of path 
loss due to operation at a much higher frequency. Assuming the 
transmitter and receiver both have Na antennas, the transmit 
and receive beamforming gain can be expressed as Gt[dB]= 
Gr[dB]=10logNa. Assuming 36 antenna elements on each side 
of the link, the beamforming gain is approximately 30 dB, 
which not only compensates for the additional path loss but 
also increases the link budget of the 60 GHz link by 10dB.  
Assuming the transmit power of each antenna is Pt[dBm], 
the link budget of a 60 GHz link PLB[dB] can be expressed as 
follows

TABLE I shows some of the parameters of 5 GHz and 60 
GHz. TABLE II and TABLE III show the MCS and PHY data 
rates used for numerical analysis. Using the parameters shown 
in Table I, II, and III, and (1) and (2), the transmission ranges 
of various MCS modes of 5 GHz and 60 GHz can be calculated 
and compared. Fig.1 shows the numerical results comparing 
the transmission ranges and the data rates of 5 GHz and 60 
GHz in both LOS and NLOS environments based on the 
measurement results of [19] with the maximum transmit power 
per antenna (Pt = 24 dBm for 5 GHz band assuming a WiFi 
device and Pt = 4 dBm for 60 GHz band). It is interesting to 
note that in a LOS environment, 60 GHz is comparable to 5 
GHz in terms of the transmission range and also has a much 
higher data rate. The reasons are as follows:  
• 
the additional 20 dB path loss at 60 GHz is already 
compensated for by the transmit and receive 
beamforming gains (~30 dB)  
• 
60 GHz has higher EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated 
Power) than 5 GHz  
• 
60 GHz can use a very simple modulation scheme such 
as BPSK or QPSK to achieve a very high data rate (>1 
Gbps) by utilizing a very wide bandwidth (~1.7 GHz), 
which requires very low Eb/N0 (~10 dB) for reliable 
communications.  
 
For a NLOS environment, however, the transmission range 
of 60 GHz quickly decreases and becomes much shorter than 5 
GHz due to much higher penetration loss of obstacles between 
the transmitter and receiver. Considering the typical transmit 
power of 5 GHz and 60 GHz devices, the transmission range 
further decreases. Fig. 2 compares the transmission ranges and 
the data rates of 5 GHz and 60 GHz with a typical transmit 
power. For an 802.11 device, a typical transmit power per 
antenna is approximately 17 dBm. For a 60 GHz device, the 
total transmit power of a 60 GHz device is limited to 10 dBm 
due to the regulations in Korea, Japan, and Australia [39], 
which limits the transmit power per antenna to Pt=-5.6dBm for 
the 36 antenna case. Fig. 2 show that the transmission range of 
60 GHz over a NLOS channel is less than 10 meters.  
Fig.1 and Fig. 2 clearly show that the tradeoff of range and 
performance for 5 GHz and 60 GHz is different and 
complementary in nature. While 5 GHz excels in achieving 
larger range and robust performance in the NLOS channel, the 
performance of 60 GHz link is much higher with very short 
range but it drops off rather quickly as the range increases, 
especially with NLOS channel. The complementary nature of 
these two bands suggests a compelling reason to combine the 
two so to keep the best of both worlds. This is exactly the 
motivation behind the concept of multi-band gigabit mesh 
networks.  
IV. 
BENEFITS OF MULTI-BAND GIGABIT MESH 
A. Multi-band Gigabit Mesh: The Concept 
The concept of multi-band gigabit mesh is to allow the 
flexibility of two devices communicating with each other in 
either the low frequency band such as 2.4 or 5 GHz, or in the 
60 GHz frequency band. Moreover, there is also the flexibility 
to choose a multi-hop 60 GHz path, if it is advantageous for the 
network performance and user experience. There are three 
distinct characteristics that define a multi-band gigabit mesh: 1) 
Some, if not all, of the devices in the mesh are capable of 
operating in multiple radio bands, more specifically, in a low 
frequency band such as 2.4 or 5 GHz (using Wi-Fi technology), 
and in the 60 GHz band. The network should exploit the multi-
band capabilities of these devices to improve the user 
experience with these devices and the network in general. 2) 
There exists at least one multi-hop 60 GHz path among the 60 
GHz devices. 3) The end to end performance between any two 
devices in the mesh should be above 1 Gbps measured at the 
MAC level.  
B. The Target Usages for Multi-band Gigabit Mesh 
Looking across the various standard efforts for 60 GHz, it is 
clear that the superset of the usages addressed by these efforts 
really span across WPAN and WLAN. Let’s consider the 
requirements of these usages in terms of range, channel 
condition and link robustness, and see which usages can benefit 
from the concept of the multi-band gigabit mesh networks. 
• 
Very short range (<1 meter)  with LOS guarantee  
The first set of usages operate at a very short range (<1 m) 
with a LOS condition almost always guaranteed. One such 
usage example is sync-n-go. Sync-n-go refers to the usage of

rapidly transferring data from one device to another. It may be 
downloading a multimedia file like HD (High Definition) 
movie from a Kiosk to a handheld device; it may also be 
exchanging photos between two peer to peer devices such as 
cell phones. The speed is the key to make this usage 
compelling, especially when the amount of data is huge. Sync-
n-go typically does not involve a range beyond 1 meter, and so 
the user has greater control to help position the devices so that 
they are in range with LOS toward each other. This set of 
usages is generally considered the least challenging from range, 
link budget and channel condition’s point of view. This 
category of usages does not need multi-band gigabit mesh to 
achieve satisfactory user experience and so such usages are not 
the target applications of multi-band gigabit mesh networks. 
• 
Medium range (1-10 meters), without LOS guarantee  
The second set of the usages operate at medium range (1-10 
meters, within one room) with reasonable probability of LOS 
but no guarantee. Even if there is a clear LOS path, movement 
of people or objects may easily disrupt the LOS path and so it 
is expected that NLOS links would be heavily used for these 
usages. Some examples include: i) Wireless HDMI (High-
Definition Multimedia Interface) [11] to replace the HDMI 
cable between a TV and other video devices with a high rate 
60 GHz link. This may be used in the home, a conference 
room or an auditorium. ii) Wireless docking in the office: The 
wireless docking station may be embedded into a display or 
monitor or may be a fixed standalone device. Mobile devices 
such as laptops or MID (Mobile Internet Devices) are 
connected wirelessly to the docking station when in the office. 
Other fixed devices such as keyboard, mouse, printer, and 
storage device (e.g., a hard drive) may be plugged into the 
docking station either via a wired interface (e.g., USB) or 
wirelessly. iii) Densely deployed 60 GHz WLAN: 60GHz APs 
mounted on the ceiling to deliver Gbps connectivity to many 
stations on an office floor.  
Fig. 2 shows that it is feasible to deliver 1.2 Gbps PHY rate 
at the range of 10 meters under NLOS condition in 60 GHz. 
This may translate into 1 Gbps MAC rate if the MAC 
efficiency is 84% or more. But the actual range would greatly 
depend on the reflection surface materials and obstacles in the 
path. Lower MAC efficiency would also lower the achievable 
MAC performance below the targeted 1 Gbps. So it could still 
be challenging to deliver 1 Gbps MAC rate at 10 meter range 
in some indoor environment. A multi-hop path in 60 GHz may 
allow shorter distance for each single hop link and hence may 
increase the possibility of LOS for each single hop link. As the 
distance between the transmitter and the receiver increases, the 
likelihood of blockage with people moving about in the room 
also dramatically increases. While it is generally expected that 
60 GHz radio will build in antenna tracking and re-training 
capability upon link breakage, concept such as multi-band 
mesh networks can help to provide additional diversity and 
robustness, and minimize the impact of 60 GHz link outage on 
the user experience. 
• 
Long range (>10 meters), NLOS 
As Fig. 2 shows that it may be very challenging to achieve 
transmission range beyond 10 meters for NLOS 60 GHz 
channel. Even more challenging than the distance is the 
obstruction caused by walls, doors, windows, furniture and 
other clutters commonly found in indoor environments. Such 
severe obstructions make it extremely difficult to cover a larger 
room or multiple rooms with a single hop 60 GHz link. For 
example, to provide full house coverage with multiple rooms, 
doors and floors, a multi-band mesh network is a must-have in 
order to meet the basic expectations of coverage. With multi-
band mesh, it becomes possible to provide coverage 
comparable to lower bands and higher peak throughput in part 
of the house. The user may experience different levels of 
performance when moving about the house, but that is nothing 
new since the user would have experienced similar effect even 
with 802.11n products, albeit at a less profound level. 
So in summary, the target usages for the multi-hop gigabit 
mesh networks are any usage that requires a distance of more 
than 1 meter without LOS guarantee.  
C. The Benefits of Multi-band Gigabit Mesh 
We’ve already touched on some of the benefits of multi-
band gigabit mesh networks in the previous discussion; here we 
examine them more closely. The first benefit is the diversity 
gain, which may be due to the flexibility to switch between 
different bands, or the flexibility to choose different path within 
the 60 GHz mesh. Another major benefit is range and spatial 
reuse performance gain provided by the 60GHz mesh. While 
there may exist spatial reuse gain in any mesh network in any 
band, the spatial reuse gain in 60 GHz mesh networks is much 
more significant due to the nature of highly directional 
beamformed links in 60 GHz. Detailed simulation results are 
provided in the next section for an office mesh deployment 
scenario to illustrate the extend of spatial reuse gain. 
• 
Multi-band diversity gain by switching between bands 
1) Data plane: The multi-band aspect refers to the fact that 
the wireless system consists of multi-band wireless devices 
which are capable of operating in both the lower frequency 
bands (e.g., 2.4 and/or 5 GHz) and a higher frequency band (60 
GHz). This combines the coverage and link robustness benefit 
offered by the lower frequency bands with the high rate benefit 
offered by the 60 GHz band as illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. 
In other words, a data link would be carried over 60 GHz 
whenever possible (e.g., when the receiver is within reach at 60 
GHz), and would fall back to 2.4/5 GHz when the 60 GHz link 
breaks. 
91
International Journal On Advances in Networks and Services, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/

2) Control plane: Diversity gain can also be achieved in the 
control plane as well as the data plane. Most of the 60 GHz 
WPAN specifications employ TDMA (time division multiple 
access) to access the shared medium efficiently between 
different devices [6][7][11]. Although TDMA has higher 
efficiency in utilizing the medium compared to a random 
access scheme, it needs a scheduler that schedules the traffic in 
the network and the scheduling control messages need to be 
exchanged between the scheduler and the devices before the 
actual data transmissions to their target devices. When the 
scheduling messages are lost due to the link breakage between 
the devices and the scheduler in the 60 GHz band, the devices 
can fall back to the lower bands and maintain the control plane 
with the scheduler and continue to exchange data with their 
target devices in the 60 GHz band with minimal interruption. 
Another example to leverage multi-band integration in the 
control plane is to facilitate faster link establishment in one 
band when a link is already established in another band. For 
example, device discovery in 60 GHz can be time-consuming 
due to the directivity of 60 GHz link. One 60 GHz device 
looking for other 60 GHz devices needs to employ some kind 
of omni-communication because there is no prior knowledge of 
the existence and the direction of the other devices. Having a 
link already established in 2.4 or 5 GHz enables some 
information about the other multi-band devices to be 
communicated more quickly in 2.4 or 5 GHz band to speed up 
the discovery process in the 60 GHz band. 
• 
Multipath diversity gain by switching path within 60GHz 
There may exist different paths between a pair of 60GHz 
devices that intend to communicate. For example, there may be 
a single hop path and a 2-hop path between a transmitter and a 
receiver. If the single hop path is broken due to obstacles such 
as a person walking by, another path such as the 2-hop path 
may be taken to get around the obstructions. It is also possible 
that the 2-hop path is a concatenation of two direct LOS links 
and such a path is better than a single hop NLOS path. So 
having an option of taking the multi-hop path can also be 
considered as another aspect of the diversity gain  
• 
Range extension by the 60 GHz mesh 
Let’s first consider the range extension benefit alone 
without considering spatial reuse gain achievable within the 
mesh. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), for a linear topology of mesh 
without considering any spatial reuse possibility, if the number 
of hops between the source and the destination is N, the 
coverage range d(N) increases by N; but the effective end to 
end data rate R(N) decreases by N [27], without taking into 
account the overhead associated with creating and maintaining 
the mesh network. Fig 4 shows a very simplistic comparison of 
multi-hop (2~4 hops) 60 GHz mesh links with a single hop 5 
GHz link for NLOS environments in a linear topology network 
such as shown in Fig 3(a). Similar comparisons can be done for 
LOS (not shown here). The important finding from Fig. 4 is 
that a 4-hop 60 GHz link still significantly outperforms a 1-hop 
5 GHz link while the range remains comparable. While a single 
hop link in 60 GHz can achieve 1.2 Gbps or above for a range 
of 18 meters, a multi-hop link can achieve 1.2 Gbps or above

for a range of 36 meters, effectively doubling the range while 
still maintaining Gbps level performance. Note that two factors 
that would affect the mesh performance are not yet accounted 
for in Fig 4, namely, the MAC overhead in the mesh, and the 
spatial reuse due to highly directional beam formed links. 
While the MAC overhead may reduce the actual performance, 
on the other hand, the spatial reuse may significantly increase 
the performance, as discussed below. 
• 
Spatial reuse performance gain within the 60 GHz mesh 
With the spatial reuse benefit, the effective throughput of 
the 60 GHz multi-hop mesh can be improved significantly. 
Since a large number of antenna elements are used in the 60 
GHz devices, a very narrow beam can be formed in a particular 
direction with very high gain and thus the mesh can have a 
good chance of having multiple active links simultaneously 
without interfering with each other. Assuming full spatial reuse 
and perfect scheduling in the mesh, for example, for the linear 
topology mesh as shown in Fig. 3(b), half of the segments of 
the multi-hop link can be active simultaneously regardless of 
the number of hops. Therefore, the effective end to end data 
rate R(N) can be expressed as R(N)=R(1)/2 for the linear 
topology. Fig.5 compares the PHY data rate and the 
transmission range of the multi-hop (2~4 hops) 60 GHz mesh 
links with and without exploiting the spatial reuse benefit for 
NLOS environments using the typical total transmit power (10 
dBm). Considering a partial spatial reuse gain, imperfect 
scheduling in a real network, and the actual deployment 
scenario, the effective end-to-end PHY rate of the linear 
topology mesh will fall somewhere in between the solid and 
dashed lines shown in Fig.5. More realistic bound of the spatial 
reuse is shown in the next section by simulation of an office 
WLAN deployment example. 
V. 
SIMULATION STUDY ON SPATIAL REUSE OF A 60 GHZ 
OFFICE MESH  
A. Simulation Scenario and Assumptions 
To further quantify the spatial reuse performance in a mesh 
for a realistic deployment scenario, let’s consider the example 
of a multi-band WLAN mesh for office environments as shown 
in Fig. 6. The office area WLAN is comprised of devices in 
nine cubicles. There are two kinds of APs in this network: 60 
GHz-only-APs, each covering a small area such as one cubicle; 
and a combo-AP that operates in both 5 and 60 GHz and hence 
can cover the larger area of all nine cubicles. The combo-AP 
also serves as the 60 GHz AP for the center cubicle. This 
combo-AP has a wired connection such as Gigabit Ethernet, 
acting as the connectivity gateway to the external network for 
all the devices in this office WLAN. The other eight 60 GHz-
only APs do not require wired Ethernet connections on the 
ceiling as they can communicate with the combo-AP using 60 
GHz links. Through these eight 60 GHz-only APs and one 
combo-AP, all the stations in the office area can form a 2-hop 
mesh network in 60 GHz.  
The focus of our simulation study is on the spatial reuse 
aspect of the 60 GHz mesh. We implemented a 60 GHz 
MATLAB simulator that can quantify the spatial reuse gain in 
this 60 GHz office mesh network. 
1) Simulation scenario: The network is comprised of nine 
cubicles each with dimensions of 5×5×3 (width × length × 
height in meters). All the APs are placed on the ceiling with the 
height of 3 meters. Each cubicle has one station that is placed 
randomly within its boundary and 1 meter above the floor level 
(assuming the stations are on a desk). For 2-hop data 
transmission in 60 GHz, a station in a cubicle first transmits 
data to its 60 GHz AP in the first hop, and in the second hop 
the 60 GHz AP communicates with the combo-AP. In order to 
make the system design simpler for 2-hop data transmission in 
the 60 GHz band, a station in one cube routes its data only 
through the 60 GHz AP above the station’s cubicle. 
2) Channel model: The channel model for the first hop 
between a station and its 60 GHz AP is modeled as NLOS 
(path loss exponent n=3.5 [19]) to capture the obstacles in the 
office environment, and the channel model for the second hop 
between the 60 GHz AP and the multi-band 5/60 GHz AP is 
modeled as LOS (n=2 [19]) since APs are installed on the 
ceiling and hence unlikely to encounter obstacles. 
3) Reflector model: Very strong specular reflectors (such as 
metallic bookshelves or cabinets commonly found in the 
office) are modeled by randomly placing them in each cubicle 
between the height of 1~2 meters. It is assumed that a signal 
ray is reflected by the reflector only once without any signal

attenuation to capture only the first order reflections. By 
varying the number of reflectors (Nf = 0, 5, and 10) in a cubicle 
the effect of a multi-path environment can be simulated. 
4) Antenna model: All the APs are equipped with a 6x6 
square array antenna (36 antenna elements) and the stations are 
equipped with a 6x6 or a 4x4 square array antenna considering 
the fact that there are more limitations such as form factors and 
cost for the stations than the APs. The adjacent antenna 
elements are separated by a half wavelength. The total transmit 
power of each array antenna is fixed to 10 dBm. Each antenna 
element is assumed to be an ideal isotropic radiator. The 
orientation of the array antenna is randomly rotated in the x, y, 
and z-axis.  
5) PHY Data rates: Depending on the SINR of each link, 
the data rate can be chosen from three different MCS modes 
shown in Table IV. For the simulations, the SINR thresholds 
are set to 5.5 dB, 13 dB, and 18 dB for MCS1=0.952 Gbps, 
MCS2=1.904 Gbps, and MCS3=3.807 Gbps, respectively to 
have BER lower than 10e-5.  
B. Metrics to Measure Spatial Reuse 
Several metrics are used to measure spatial reuse in the 60 
GHz mesh. The first metric is the number of simultaneous 
active links in the network.  
The notation Lij
(2) is used to denote the link in this 2-hop 
office mesh network, the superscript (2) denoting the 2-hop path 
between the stations and the combo-AP, with the cubicle index 
i = 0,1,…,8 denoting the location of the station where the data 
communication is initiated or destined, and the hop index j=1,2  
distinguishing if it is the first or the second hop. This is shown 
in Fig. 6(b). Note that for the center cubicle there is only a 
single hop from the station to the combo-AP, while for the 
other cubicles there will be a 2-hop path. Just for the 
convenience of notation, the center cubicle is assigned with 
index i=0; and so effectively L01
(2) = L02
(2). Therefore, there are 
totally 17 distinct links in this office network, denoted as { Lij
(2) 
: i = 0,1,…,8 ; j=1,2  }. For the rest of this subsection, the set of 
links between the stations and the 60 GHz-APs, {Li1
(2) : i = 
0,1,…,8}, is referred to 1st hop links, and the set of links 
between the 60 GHz APs and the combo-AP, {Li2
(2) : i = 
0,1,…,8}, referred to 2nd hop links. 
Note that only one of the 2nd hop links can be active at any 
given time. So theoretically there cannot be more than 9 
simultaneously active links in this mesh network, and the only 
possible set of 9 simultaneously active links is {Li1
(2): i = 
0,1,…,8} . If the number of active links is no more than 1, there 
is effectively no spatial reuse in the network. So the number of 
simultaneous active links is a very intuitive metric to indicate 
the degree of spatial reuse. But it is not the most accurate one 
as it does not reflect the quality of these active links. Therefore 
another metric, the aggregated end to end PHY throughput in 
the mesh, is introduced as a more accurate measurement of the 
mesh performance at the PHY level. 
Both metrics are presented in the form of CCDF 
(Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function) curves, 
generated from Monte Carlo simulation of 1000 runs. For each 
run, the stations and the reflectors are placed randomly within

the cubicles and the antenna array is oriented randomly. It is 
assumed that a link can be active only if the SINR of the link is 
above the lowest SINR threshold (i.e. 5.5 dB) and if the link 
does not lower the SINR of the preexisting active links below 
the lowest SINR threshold.  
C. Simulation Results with 6x6 Antenna Array 
 Fig. 7 shows the distribution of the number of 
simultaneous active links in the network with all the APs and 
the stations using the 6x6 square antenna array. The way to 
determine the number of simultaneous active links in each run 
of simulation is to first randomly pick a 60 GHz AP to form a 
2nd hop link with the combo-AP; then determine which and 
how many of the 1st hop links can be activated successfully 
with the chosen 2nd hop link. The order of activation among the 
1st hop links is random in each run. The simulation results show 
that eight links are almost always active and the number of 
reflectors (Nf = 0, 5, and 10) does not cause much change on 
that. Remember that there can be only one 2nd hop link active at 
any given time, say L12
(2). This means all the rest of 7 cubicles 
(index i = 2 to 8) can still be actively transmitting or receiving 
from their 60 GHz-only AP at the same time. Fig. 7 shows that 
extremely high degree of spatial reuse is obtained in this 
scenario. This is possible because all the APs and stations are 
using an antenna array with a large number of antenna 
elements (i.e. 36) which provides very high transmit and 
receive beamforming gain (~30 dB) and very narrow beam 
width, the distance between a station and the AP in its cell is 
very close, and the beams pointing to or from the APs on the 
ceiling do not interfere with each other. 
While the number of reflectors does not impact the number 
of active links, it does affect the quality of these links. Fig. 8 
shows the SINR distribution of the 2nd hop links {Li2
(2) : i = 
0,1,…,8} (that is, links between one of the 60 GHz APs and the 
combo-AP on the ceiling). As the number of reflectors 
increases, interference from the other active first hop links in 
the network increases and thus the SINR of the 2nd hop link 
between the APs decreases. The SINR distribution in Fig. 8 is 
converted into the distribution of the PHY rate of the 2nd hop 
links in Fig. 9. The results show that for the moderate number 
of reflectors (Nf =5), the 2nd hop links can maintain the highest 
MCS (i.e. 3.8 Gbps) for more than 90% of the time. Since there 
can be only one active 2nd hop link at any given time, Fig. 9 
effectively shows the aggregated throughput of the 2nd hop link 
at the combo-AP in the network.  
Let’s now consider the aggregated PHY rate of 1st hop links 
in Fig. 10. The aggregated PHY rate is defined as the sum of all 
the active links’ PHY rate. Similar to the situation with the 2nd 
hop, as the number of reflectors increases the aggregated PHY 
rate of the 1st hop links decreases due to increased interference 
between each other. However, the aggregated PHY rate for the 
1st links is still extremely high, over 20 Gbps most of the time. 
This is because of the extremely high degree of spatial reuse 
among the 1st hop links.  
Now consider the end to end aggregated PHY rate in the 2-
hop mesh. Fig. 7 and Fig 9 shows that the 2nd hop link can

maintain the highest data rate (3.8Gbps) more than 90% of the 
time while seven other 1st hop links are active simultaneously. 
This is illustrated in Fig. 11. In Fig. 11(a), at one time instance 
(T0 < t ≤ T1), the seven 1st hop links {Li1
(2) : i = 2,3,4,5,6,7,8} 
may be active simultaneously with the 2nd hop link L12
(2). Fig. 
11(b) shows the next time instance (T1 < t ≤ T2) when {Li1
(2) : i 
= 1,3,4,5,6,7,8} and L22
(2) 2nd-hop are the simultaneously active 
links. Fig. 11(c) shows another time instance (T7 < t ≤ T8) when 
{Li1
(2) : i = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and L82
(2) are the simultaneously 
active links. Since the aggregated throughput of the 1st hop 
links (shown in Fig. 10) is much higher than the 2nd hop 
(shown in Fig. 9), and one of the 2nd hop links can be almost 
always active simultaneously with seven other 1st hop links 
(shown in Fig. 7), the end to end throughput is basically 
determined by the 2nd hop link throughput. So the end to end 
throughput distribution should look like the throughput 
distribution of the 2nd hop shown in Fig. 9 as well. That is, 90% 
of the time the end to end throughput can reach 3.8 Gbps. 
It is remarkable that a two-hop mesh network reaches the 
highest data rate (3.8 Gbps) that is ever achievable by a single 
link, thanks to the high degree of spatial reuse. It can be shown 
that such 2-hop network actually outperforms a one hop 
network where there is only one 60 GHz AP serving all the 
stations in the 9 cubicles. Fig. 12 shows the distribution of the 
PHY data rate of such single hop links for Nf=5. The results 
show that such one hop link can achieve 3.8 Gbps only 19% of 
the time, which is much worse than the two-hop mesh.  This is 
because the path loss exponent is higher between the station 
and the AP due to more obstacles compared to the 2nd hop link 
between the 60 GHz AP and the combo-AP in the two-hop case 
and the distance between the station and the AP is longer. 
Another remarkable insight one may gain from this 
example is that even though the aggregated PHY rate for the 1st 
hop links can be over 20 Gbps most of the time, it does not  
translate directly into the end to end throughput for the mesh, 
because the 2nd hop is the bottleneck of the network. This is 
typical of a network with star or tree like topology, and 
congestion and flow control is a well known and well studied

problem in mesh network literatures [31-34]. However, this 
problem becomes even more severe in our example because of 
the spatial reuse with highly directional links in 60 GHz. 
Without proper congestion control, much of the huge spatial 
reuse potential is wasted. So this example demonstrates the 
need to further study effective congestion and flow control that 
can maximize the return of spatial reuse.  
D. Simulation Results with 4x4 Antenna Array at the Stations 
Now suppose the stations in the two-hop network have only 
16 antenna elements (a 4x4 square array antenna), which might 
be more realistic considering the small form factor of the 
stations and the cost constraint. As the number of antenna 
elements decreases, not only the link quality degrades due to 
the decreased beamforming gain but also interference to and 
from the other active links increases due to the wider beam 
width.  
Fig. 13 shows the effect of the decreased number of antenna 
elements at the stations on the spatial reuse gain. The spatial 
reuse gain decreased significantly comparing to Fig. 7 where 
the stations are equipped with 36 antenna elements. However, 
more than five links can still be active simultaneously more 
than 90% of the time, which is still very high spatial reuse gain. 
Fig. 14 and Fig. 15 show the effect of the decreased number 
of antenna elements on the SINR and the PHY rate of the 2nd 
hop links. Comparing to Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, although more 
interference from the stations degrades the quality of the link, 
the link can still support the highest data rate for more than 
70% of the time with a moderate number of reflectors (Nf =5).  
Fig. 16 shows the aggregated PHY rate of the 1st hop links. 
Comparing to Fig. 10, the PHY rate is significantly lower with 
4x4 antenna array at the stations. However, the results show 
that the aggregated PHY rate is still sufficiently higher than the 
2nd hop PHY rate in Fig. 15. This is because 100% of the time 
at least 3 links (i.e., one 2nd hop link and two 1st hop links) can 
be active simultaneously as shown in Fig. 13, and so the end to 
end PHY throughput is still determined by the 2nd hop. So the 
end of end PHY throughput with 4x4 antenna array at the 
stations has similar distribution as shown in Fig. 15.  
The above results are compared to the one-hop scenario in 
Fig. 17 and it shows that the one-hop case also suffers from the 
decreased beamforming gain and now the link can support the 
highest data rate for only 14% of the time (vs. 73% of the time 
with two-hop mesh in Fig. 15). So even with the 4x4 antenna 
array, a 2-hop mesh still outperforms the one hop network in 
this office WLAN example and maintains the end to end PHY 
throughput close to the highest PHY rate of the 2nd hop for 
majority of the time. This shows that the stations can have less 
number of antenna elements than the APs but still enjoy the 
end to end throughput performance benefit by employing mesh. 
VI. 
PREVIOUS WORK 
Multiple research projects in Europe [8, 9] have been 
focusing on the design of a holistic wireless system that 
provides higher performance for WLAN. One such example is 
the European Information Society Technologies (IST) 
Broadway project [8, 16] which targeted specifically for a 
WLAN with the hybrid dual frequency system design concept 
based on HIPERLAN/2 at 5 GHz and a fully ad-hoc extension 
at 60 GHz. The usage scenarios envisioned include hotspot 
coverage, public Internet access, high density dwellings and 
flats deployment, corporate and campus environments. 
However, IST limited its bandwidth in the 60 GHz band to no 
more than 240 MHz and hence the maximum data rate 
achievable was only 720 Mb/s, substantially below 1 Gbps.  
Conceptually what it is proposed in this paper is similar to 
the approach taken by the IST Broadway project but there are 
three important distinctions that lead to a substantially different 
solution: i) Broadway is based on HIPERLAN/2 and there is 
very tight integration of 5 GHz and 60 GHz at the RF front end. 
Our work is based on the 802.11 MAC to maximize reuse and 
integration with existing 802.11 solutions at 2.4/5 GHz. ii) 
Broadway limited its channel width at 60 GHz band to no more 
than 240 MHz and hence the max link data rate was only 720 
Mb/s. The latest PHY proposals in both ECMA TC 48 [7] and 
IEEE 802.15.3c [8] use a much wider channel (close to 2 GHz) 
for obtaining multi-Gbps PHY rates. Similar assumptions are 
taken here at the PHY to ensure multi-Gbps data rate 
capabilities. The MAC efficiency can be deeply affected by the 
operating PHY rate [1, 18] and so MAC throughput does not 
always scale linearly with the PHY rate. It is important to re-
examine and sometimes re-design the MAC protocol when the 
PHY rate is substantially increased. iii) It was assumed in 
Broadway that only infrastructure devices such as APs used 
directional antenna at 60 GHz and all stations used an omni-
directional antenna. Our work assumes that it is feasible to 
employ directional antennas for stations such as laptops, or 
MIDs. This allows a significant spatial reuse benefit and can 
affect the design substantially in both the PHY and MAC 
layers.  
VII. DESIGN CHALLENGES OF MULTI-BAND GIGABIT MESH 
This section presents high level considerations of the 
system design concept of multi-band Gigabit mesh networks 
and the new research challenges within that framework. 
A. Integration Architecture to Support Seamless Session 
Switch 
The concept of multi-band integration is straightforward but 
the design and implementation are non-trivial. One of the 
important design questions is where in the protocol stack such

integration should happen - at the RF front end, baseband, 
MAC, or above the MAC?  
The answer partly depends on how similar or different the 
radio stack (antenna, PHY, MAC, etc.) would look like across 
the bands. Given the very different channel properties of the 60 
GHz band, the antenna, RFIC and baseband design for the 60 
GHz would be quite different from that of 2.4 or 5 GHz band 
[38]. We also have strong reasons to believe that the media 
access mechanism for 60 GHz would be quite different from 
the CSMA/CA based media access mechanism for Wi-Fi in the 
2.4 and 5 GHz bands, as explained below. 
First and foremost, the current design of CSMA/CA 
assumes that devices in the same physical proximity can carrier 
sense and overhear each other because of the omni-directional 
antenna typically used in 2.4 and 5 GHz bands and so all 
communications can be assumed to be broadcast at the physical 
level. This is no longer the case in 60 GHz, because high gain 
directional antenna would be employed in order to reach decent 
range. This directivity fundamentally violates the assumption 
of CSMA/CA and so direct reuse does not make sense. 
Another reason that we may consider to modify the 802.11 
MAC is that current 802.11 MAC does not provide strong QoS 
guarantee, which may be acceptable for Internet connectivity 
type of applications but not acceptable for high performance 
media applications such as wireless display. Media access such 
as TDMA (Time Division Multiplex Access) that can provide 
better QoS assurance is probably needed. While TDMA 
typically is used successfully for licensed band applications 
such as cellular networks, it is relatively unproven for 
unlicensed band applications such as 60 GHz. The main 
difficulty with TDMA in unlicensed band is to cope with the 
interference from independent overlapping networks without 
causing instability in the networks. The fact that 60 GHz links 
typically employ directional communication between devices 
can somewhat mitigate such a problem as directional 
communication helps lesson the probability of interference and 
hence improves space reuse as evidenced from our simulation 
results shown in this paper. 
For these reasons, we believe media access mechanism for 
60 GHz would be quite different from that of existing Wi-Fi at 
2.4 and 5 GHz. This begs the question of how these different 
media access mechanisms be reconciled or integrated in the 
multi-band framework. Such reconciliation needs to be 
investigated carefully in order to design a reasonable 
integration architecture that can support seamless session 
switch between different bands. 
B. Radio concurrency 
Depending on how tightly the 60 GHz radio and 2.4/5 GHz 
radio are integrated, a multi-band device may or may not be 
able to operate in different bands concurrently. Therefore it is 
important 
to 
have 
the 
flexibility 
of 
allowing 
both 
configurations to function in the network. If two radios can be 
used concurrently, it opens up the possibility of using both 
bands to further optimize the performance for the device and 
the network beyond what a single radio can provide. On the 
other hand, full concurrent operations may increase hardware 
cost and may consume too much power for the mobile devices. 
If two radios are not to operate simultaneously for a long 
period of time, then how and when to switch from one band to 
another is also an interesting question to consider.  
C. Multi-hop Multi-band Mesh Challenges 
Some of the issues with directional ad hoc networks such as 
medium access control, neighbor discovery and routing have 
been well studied [22-30], albeit for lower frequency bands. It 
is necessary to reevaluate the ideas and applicability for higher 
frequency bands, with realistic antenna patterns and higher 
PHY rates. Some concepts might be more readily applicable 
than others. For example, congestion control [31-34] is a well 
recognized problem in multi-hop ad hoc networks. As 
demonstrated in our office WLAN example in Section V, the 
congestion problem could be even more pronounced for some 
topology like star- or tree- like networks, and the un-even 
spatial reuse gain in different part of the network may actually 
worsen the congestion at certain point of the network. How to 
address congestion and flow control in such highly directional 
networks is a new research topic. The concept of network 
coding [35] has shown promise to combat performance issues 
such as congestion. But such a concept may be challenging to 
apply in a directional mesh because network coding leverages 
omni-directional broadcast which is a very expensive operation 
at 60 GHz; so further study might be needed in that area as 
well.  
The topic of multi-channel ad hoc networks has been 
studied somewhat in the past [36-37], however, most of the 
work assumes homogeneous channels within the same band. 
Multi-band mesh works across characteristically very different 
bands, and so imposes a new set of problems to solve but we 
have seen very little work done on this yet. 
Power consumption is another aspect that needs to be 
carefully studied in the context of multiband mesh. For 
example, as pointed out earlier, radio concurrency may have 
negative impact on power while boosting the performance. 
Another important factor to consider is how much power the 
radio consumes when operating in different band.  
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The industry is positioning 60 GHz radio as a high 
performance radio that is capable of delivering gigabit 
performance in a wide range of usage scenarios. 60GHz 
represents a technological opportunity This means that 60 
GHz radio has to live up to expectations similar to Wi-Fi since 
most users are familiar with that experience. In this paper we 
point out that one of the key challenges in meeting those 
expectations is to improve range and robustness at 60 GHz. 
This paper proposes the system design concept of multi-band 
gigabit mesh networks to meet that challenge and quantify its 
potential benefits in range extension and spatial reuse with 
analysis and simulation results. The integration of 60GHz 
radio with the existing 2.4/5GHz band WiFi radio presents an 
opportunity to provide a unified technology for both gigabit 
WPAN and WLAN, thus further reinforcing the technology 
convergence that is already underway with the widespread 
adoption of Wi-Fi technology [40]. Much more work need to 
be done in order to prove the feasibility of this concept with a 
detailed protocol design. Our current analysis and simulation 
do not take into account the MAC overhead associated with 
the mesh creation and maintenance, and we would like to take 
that into account in our further study to tighten the 
performance bound. We also want to continue to investigate

the topics discussed in the last section to provide a complete 
solution for multi-band gigabit mesh networks.
