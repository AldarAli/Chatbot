INTRODUCTION
There is a demand for smarter, effective, efficient and
more sustainable cities, pushing the collective intelligence of
cities onward, which can improve the ability to forecast and
manage urban flows, and integrate the dimensions of the
physical, digital and institutional spaces of a regional
agglomeration. The expression "smart city" has been used
for several years by a number of technology companies and
serves as a description for the application of compound
systems to integrate the operation of urban infrastructure and
services, such as buildings, transportation, electrical and
water distribution, and public safety [1]. A smart city can be
described as a city that:
• Allows real-world urban data to be collected and
analysed by the use of software systems, server substructure,
network infrastructure, and client devices [2].
•
Implements
solutions,
with
the
support
of
instrumentation and interconnection of sensors, actuators,
and mobile devices [3].
• Can combine service production and an intelligent
environment, exploits accessible information in its activities
and decision making and adopts information flows between
the municipality and the urban or business community [4].
The theory of smart cities understood from the perception
of technologies and components has some exact properties
within the wider cyber, digital, smart, intelligent cities texts
[5]. The novelty of this article is summarized in Figure 6
which proposes a connection between multiple cities. The
rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II and III
will highlight smart city systems, applications and services,
and then in Section IV is presented the role of technology.
Section V presents the communication platform that we have
proposed. Section VI provides some final conclusions.

SMART CITY SYSTEMS AND CITY DATA
As information systems have become prevalent in urban
environments they have formed opportunities to capture
information that was never previously accessible. Figure 1
provides an overview of the city systems and relevant
aspects.
Figure 1.
Data and city systems.
This overview is necessary for an understanding of the
existing links. Vast amounts of data that describe what
happens in the city are available and could be used to create
and change intelligent solutions within related areas of e-
services
application.
Knowing
what
data
and
what
information
systems
the
city
has
would
help
with
understanding the city systems. But the reality is that

"nobody has a comprehensive overall picture of the data and
information systems of their city [2].“ Viljanen et al
recapitulated that "even the City itself does not have a
complete overview on all the information systems it has in its
dozens
of
different
departments
and
public
service
corporations. [2]" The expansion of both computing power
and new algorithms allow this information to be analyzed in
near “real-time” in order to provide a base for all developed
applications.
The same infrastructure is used 24 hours a day, seven
days a week by various stakeholders - citizens, workers,
students,
researchers,
investors
or
entrepreneurs.
Characteristic players in the smart city include municipal
leadership, IT and telecommunications companies, utilities,
municipality
technical
services,
and
grid-infrastructure
service providers. Partnerships and strong collaboration
strategies and tactics among key stakeholders are required in
order to share research and innovation assets, such as
emerging Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT) tools, methodologies and know-how, experimental
technology
platforms,
and
user
communities
for
experimentation on e-service applications and future internet
technologies [5].
A.
Smart cities applications and services
Citizens and other stakeholders expect high quality
public services that transform and enhance their daily quality
of life. A brief overview of various areas of smart city
applications is recapitulated in Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Areas of smart city applications.
It is clear that the spectrum of application areas is very
wide. For example, real-time travel information is essential
for applications which let people plan trips on public
transportation. The user could have real time information
about when the next bus or train is coming. Another example
is an application, which collects and distributes real time
information about where parking is accessible so drivers can
promptly find free spaces. Access to suitable data represents
an opportunity for developers to create applications. In this
way, stakeholders can access wide online services, with
portals for basic information, citizen services, business, and
tourism, all based on a common infrastructure.

OVERVIEW OF SMART CITY SERVICES
There is a wide range of services and applications (See
Table 1). These services cover fields, such as transportation
(intelligent road
networks,
connected
cars
and
public
transport), public utilities (smart electricity, water and gas
distribution), education, health and social care, public safety.
Emerging applications and services are extended into diverse
fields,
such
as
everyday
life
of
citizens,
disaster
management,
smart
buildings,
logistics
and
intelligent
procurement.
The
applications
for
this
portfolio
include
implementation for the connected city such as: smart grid,
smart home, security, building automation, remote health
and wellness monitoring, location aware applications, mobile
payments
and
other
machine-to-machine
(M2M)
applications.
The acronym XaaS (X as a service) refers to any of an
increasing number of services provided on-line: everything
as a service or anything as a service. The examples of XaaS
are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service
(PaaS), Monitoring as a Service (Maas), Security as a service
(SECaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and others.
Developed applications are able to supply real-time
information and expand the ability to forecast and manage
urban flows, and fulfil other functions of the city. Also, they
can help to reveal how demands for transportation, water and
energy peak in a city and how to take appropriate action and
respond. It is important to the city stakeholders that they can
collaborate to smooth these peaks and to achieve robustness.

IV.
THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY
Advances in new technology are employed to improve
city applications and services. There are communications,
analytical and control technologies that permit transforming
the way of doing things while influencing better policy and
urban management. It is changing the entire way the service
can be solved, combining the ICTs with city infrastructure
and shifting the city systems solutions. Thanks to these
technologies, there is the capability in the provision of
services via digital communication, e.g., interactive services
or automating the solution of services. Figure 3 presents city
services and the technological solution of services. Data are
stored and forwarded by using the network backbone in
order for use by service providers and in related applications.
Cimmino et al [11] highlighted the role of small cell
technology in smart cities – there is the prospect of
“increased broadband capabilities, improved flexibility and
easy
deployment
of
scalable
multi-service
network
architectures.” The article concludes that the integration of
broadband personal communications with device-to-device
communications and M2M will constitute a significant
challenge. The creation of information stuff is not restricted
to a particular location, and the resulting products are
typically delivered through the network. Smart city services
are also available through wireless mobile devices and are
enabled by services oriented enterprise architecture including
web services, the extensible markup language (XML), and
mobilized software applications [15]. Big data to analyze,
capture, clean, search, share, store, transfer, and visualize
should also be mentioned here.
Smart cities are deploying online services in diverse
sectors of cities. An online service, also called Software as a
Service (SaaS), is a service delivered by a software
application
running
online
and
making
its
facilities
accessible to users over the Internet via an interface. The
interface could be Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)
obtainable via a standard client, such as web-browser or a
web-API (application programming Interface) or by any
additional means. It can represent real service that runs on
the host (POP, SMTP, HTTP, etc.) or some other kind of
metric associated with the host - response to a ping, free disk
space, number of logged in users, etc. Eventually, services
could be delivered to users through home-based access or
mobile access, citywide digital interactive displays, or
kiosks. Cloud computing has radically transformed in what
way business applications are built and run. Platform as a
Service (PaaS) is a way to lease operating systems, storage
and network capacity or hardware over the Internet. It is a
kind of cloud computing services that deliver a solution stack
and a computing platform as a service. Here, online-service
users no longer need to own or license the software to run it.
Where users need to pay, they are paying for use of the
service rather than for owning or licensing the application
itself. These innovations have allowed offer more services to
more
people,
to
give better
access
to
services
with
accompanied improvements and innovations.
A.
Wireless sensor networks and related technological
advances
The aim is to deploy monitoring infrastructure and
produce a distributed network of intelligent sensor nodes
which can measure many parameters for a more efficient
management of the city. Recent advances in wireless sensor
networks have been determined by a range of underlying
54

ICONS 2015 : The Tenth International Conference on Systems

technological
advances,
primarily
progress
in
MEMS
(micro-electro-mechanical system) sensor technology, and
innovative ways to manage power consumption. These
networks responsible for sensing as well as for the first
stages of processing are capable of flexible, low-cost
monitoring of a range of environmental parameters and
phenomena at very fine levels of spatial and temporal detail.
Smart city solutions proposed for event detection based
on Wireless Sensor Networks will be generating important
growth in this arena. The wireless sensor network (WSN)
consists of a group of heterogeneous and spatially dispersed
autonomous sensors deployed in large numbers either inside
the phenomenon or very close to it. The WSN is constructed
from a large number of "nodes" organized into a cooperative
network, where each node is connected to one or several
sensors.

Figure 4.
Hardware architecture of a sensor node.
Figure 4 provides a schematic overview of the typical
architecture of the sensor node. These sensor nodes have the
capability to collect and process data, each node is able to
autonomously sense, process, and communicate data about
its immediate environment to other nearby nodes and
computers. Zheng at al noticed that there are the unique
characteristics and constraints for sensor networks: dense
node deploymend, battery powered sensor nodes, severe
energy,
computation,
and
storage
constraints,
self-
configuration,
application
specific
design
requirements,
unreliable sensor nodes, frequent topology change, many-to-
many traffic pattern, data redundancy, and nonexistence of
global addressing scheme [26].
Figure 5.
WSNs Routing Protocols [25].
Just as the Internet allows access to digital information
anywhere, sensor networks will provide vast arrays of real-
time, remote interaction with the physical world (Pinto,
2003). Distributed intelligence from the sensor to the
network will become as essential as the Internet - wireless
sensor networks give the opportunities for the collation of
data which is fit for the purpose supporting the creation of
smart cities. Each from a few to several hundreds or even
thousands of nodes in the network consists of processing
capability
given
by
one
or
more
programmable
microcontrollers
for
controlling
node
behaviour
and
processing data.
A lot of research has previously been accompanied into
sensor networks, and a comprehensive set of specifications
have been completed for the physical layer, link layer, and
network layer. The same is true for routing protocols
necessary for setting up path or paths from sensor nodes to
the data sink. Routing is an important issue and since sensor
nodes have limited resources, routing protocols must have a
small overhead. As it can be seen in Figure 5 many routing
protocols have been developed over the last few years and
many innovative routing mechanisms have been proposed
[25].
Representative sensor network related communication
technologies includes Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), ZigBee,
IQRF, Ultra-Wide Band (UWB), and Wireless Hart. Even
though it have not been used extensively on a large scale yet,
wireless
sensor
networks
(WSNs)
offer
a
substantial
technology that helps to cover city conditions monitoring
needs. This technology gives the ability to efficiently and
quickly detect various spatial events, such as the problems of
a region of high pollutant concentration by processing real
time data. Air pollution or monitoring of urban environments
could be supported by dense WSN of nodes with monitoring
capabilities. These advanced real-time systems are wireless,
highly distributed, also used in addition to sensors actuators
as interfaces deployed across a wide geographic area.
B.
Sensing of the city and cloud computing
The intelligence of a sensor network is predominantly
reflected in provision of real time information and in the fact
that the real-time sensor data might be integrated with
environmental modelling and control. The primary concept
essential for capability of real-time information distribution
and use them in city services lies in establishing the digital
infrastructure for processing of both WSN and video
surveillance
data
resulting
in
a
more
efficient
event
detection. The growing penetrations of fixed and wireless
networks permit that such sensors and systems to be
connected to distributed processing centres. The smart city
connects the sensors to sense the city systems, and process
the sensing information by cloud computing and so on to
integrate cyber space and things of internet [15].
Contemporary wireless sensor networks are principally
treated as simply a new data source for integration with other
conventional spatial and open data information systems.
Examples
include
sensors
connecting
buildings,
infrastructure, transport, networks and utilities, offers a
physical space for experimentation and validation of the
Internet of Things (IoT) functions. The data is delivered in
real-time through the cloud to the service providers, users,
and other stakeholders.

V.
THE PROPOSED COMMUNICATION PLATFORM
The diagram of proposed communication platform for
the development of city services and for the integration and
use of rendering and actuating technologies is shown in
Figure 6. The help of instrumentation and interconnection of
mobile devices and sensors, which collect and analyse real-
world data, creates a dynamic environment with numerous
groups of users concerned in different city events. We may
use smart travel as an example. The provision of real-time
information about urban environments could give real-time
travel information for passengers, such as current running
times of buses or trains. Traffic monitoring can be supported
by monitoring of means of transport, weather and traffic
condition.
Figure 6.
Communication platform for the development of city services and for remote control.
The widespread use of digital sensors and digital control
systems for the control and operation of urban infrastructure
includes traffic sensors and actuators, building management
systems in the smart house solution, digital utility meters in
the smart utility area, and so forth. There are plenty of
opportunities for new services by interconnecting physical
and virtual worlds with a huge amount of wireless nodes
distributed in houses, vehicles, streets, buildings and many
other public environments. It may be components that will
be applied in the fields of vehicle-mounted terminals,
wireless
meter
reading,
streetlight
(smart
lighting),
transportation (smart parking), household appliances (smart
energy), and industrial cameras (smart house). Ambient
spatial
intelligence
for
sustainable
cities
contains
the
potential for augmenting such networks with the capabilities
to not only capture, but also process, query, and even use
spatial data in the network itself.
Thanks to a distributed network of intelligent sensor
nodes, a wide collection of parameters can be measured for
better management of the city, and data are delivered
wirelessly and in real-time to the citizens or the appropriate
authorities [1]. By using networks and sensors to measure
and control processes, and the cloud for the information
sharing, stakeholders can make immediate diagnoses and
correct the problem by appropriate action in the event of an
accident or another incident. The principle of Smart Earth is
that, sensors are embedded everywhere: in the railways,
bridges, tunnels, roads, buildings, water systems, dams,
commercial equipment and medical
equipment, and then
physical
facilities
can
be
perceived,
so
information
technology extends into the physical world, constructing a
"Internet of Things" [15]. A mashup is important to make
existing data more useful as a combination of two or more
sources to create new services. This can include a wide range
of uses from identity and access management to application,
web, and portal servers that power stakeholder services and
web sites to ensure a view of the citizen and real-time
updates of information across city systems. A real time
dashboard for monitoring city systems offers solutions to
help
city
authorities
manage
smart
city
policies
and
guarantee the necessary controls and procedures are in place
for better governance. The application layer could include
interactive modules that notify the users of events or alerts
and allow them to trigger further actions.

a smart city necessary for the full utilization of the
opportunities offered by information and communication
technologies. Figure 6 included in the previous section gives

and services. Directions for our future work include applying
