Abstract— Information technologies have changed the way to 
plan our travel and to look at the tourism industry. This field 
has changed in last few years from every point of view: by the 
consumers, by the promotional marketing, by the commerce 
and the way to live the geography. Travel 2.0 is growing up in 
Web 2.0, which means that travel brands and users of this 
sector are using Internet in a much defined way. The users are 
not simple consumers; they become the interactive center of 
the tourism industry. In this paper, we will show the main 
effects of the growth of Information Technologies and the 
consequent change in tourism industry with the purpose to 
understand why they are so connected. First, we will consider 
how new technologies influence the hotel industry and the 
relation between users and accommodations. Then, we will 
analyze the position of tourism industry in the European e-
commerce. Finally, we will show how social media have 
changed travel brands.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays the development of new technologies has 
marked the world of tourism. Interactive multimedia 
platforms and the use of Internet in a new different way have 
changed the way of life of the entire world from the 
economic and socio-cultural point of views [1]. Tourism can 
be defined as an intensive information field and it is strictly 
connected to new technologies because of it. In fact the 
nature of tourism includes creation/transformation and 
transmission of information which builds a particular kind of 
relation between consumers and business.  
Business-to-Consumer (B2C) relation became connected 
with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in 
two levels, the operative one (when the process located in the 
chain became digital) and the strategic one (referred on the 
relation between enterprises and competitive context) [2]. 
The strictly relation between travels and the ICT in based 
upon a reason that is important to consider: tourism is a set 
of services and at the same time an electronic product 
because destinations and reservations are intangibles 
businesses. So the ICT has reached, during the year, the need 
to facilitate processes and way of trading and communicating 
[3]. In few years the relation between ICT and tourism is 
changed in a very fast and differential way [1]. Now we are 
able to talk about “community” and we can use the term 
“Travel 2.0”. Search information, share photos and spread 
your opinion about the destination is going to be more and 
more immediate: it is a change from a static system to a 
dynamic and interactive one [4]. Several new technologies as 
e-commerce and e-ticketing changed the way of travel. 
Enterprises start to optimize the policy functions, to beat 
down the costs and to amplify the costumers’ services. The 
World Wide Web (WWW) starts to become the field of the 
Destination Marketing Organizations which looks at the 
internet like an ideal medium for trading and promoting [3]. 
These changes allowed creating an interactive way to 
communicate where the knowledge is shared and the 
costumers are beginning to cover an important place and 
being more than a simple consumer. In last few years web 
marketing is compulsory, especially in the field of tourism 
where the promotion of a touristic destination in the 
cyberspace has become the real image of the place itself. 
Over recent years, the mobile phones are becoming more and 
more important for the places reviews, due to the 
geolocalisation [1] and for reaching information. 
The new way to live the travel has become like a circular 
way: 
Inspiration-Research-Planning-Decision-Reservation-
Travelling-Sharing. The traveler now is considered with his 
own marks of references (Know the single person is 
important) like a single consumers with their own marks of 
references, who uses internet in order to travel, because the 
world of tourism is a mix of different platforms of 
communications and trades [5]. 
In this paper, we perform an analysis on the impact of 
web services and the ICT on the tourism industry in some 
southern European counties. We also make a comparison 
among southern European countries and analyze the 
evolution of the number of users that have occurred in recent 
years and the main information sources that people use to 
plan their vacation. This work can help us to improve the 
way to provide information to potential visitors. 
The rest of this paper is structured to follows. In Section 
2, we can see some papers which analyzed the impact of the 
IT in the tourism industry sector. Section 3 shows the study 
of the main activities within the tourism industry, which is 
affected by the incorporation of IT. In addition, we analyze 
the activity of IT in the southern European countries, such as 
Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. The results of this 
analysis are shown in Section 4. Finally, we perform a 
comparison and discussion of these results in Section 5. 
Conclusions are shown in Section 6.

RELATED WORKS 
This section shows several works about how tourism 
businesses are introducing the use of IT to promote and 
capture the attention of their visitors. 
S. Reino and B. Hay [6] investigate the use of YouTube 
as a tourism-marketing tool from tourism organizations point 
of view and the tourist perspectives. The tourism 
organizations regard Youtube as a useful marketing tool for 
the accommodation sector since it allows them to create 
promotional videos, which could then be visualized by 
people searching for them on YouTube. However, despite 
the large number of visitors that this platform can receive 
daily, approximately 30% of the analyzed videos contained 
tourism-related information. This value varies depending on 
the type of institution (public or private) and the country 
where the query is made. Moreover, authors comment that 
YouTube can offer to tourists the opportunity of searching 
for very specific activities, watch reviews, and seek help or 
advice about their destination. They predict that YouTube 
will keep growing in popularity, and will become an 
important tool to consider in this field. 
The repercussion of IT on the tourism industry should be 
taken with care, as the result of surveys can vary depending 
on the type of company that is consulted. Following this 
philosophy, C. Berné et al. [7], discuss a possible structural 
change in the distribution of tourism in Spain, affected by the 
intensive use of IT, from the views of the intermediaries 
involved. The analysis reveals a predominant use of 
electronic media in tourism distribution channels, from the 
structure of tourism distribution system where IT, 
particularly the Internet, are a meeting point between 
operators which make up another as transactions central axis. 
Authors conclude that the use of IT does not seem to exert a 
significant influence on improving the quality of the tourism 
product and the ultimate development of best practices in the 
sector. The reservation centrals (CRS) have a more positive 
opinion about it, probably in order to justify their own 
presence in the value-added chain. 
Víctor V. Fernández et al. [8] show us, with their study 
results, that there are seven major specific features of the 
new tourist customer profiles that appear to be associated 
with new technologies: shorter stays and novelty seeking, 
changes in levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, 
influence of tourist designing new products, price as 
important factor in the final decision time, direct experience 
i-Tourism, importance of the emotional elements and 
Tourism prominence mail (e-Tourism). Authors say that the 
main purpose of the marketing website is to persuade visitors 
to change their attitudes about their tourism products. The 
marketing and promotion of tourism are in a continuous 
adaptation and learning process. It requires that its members 
are familiar with new technologies, understanding needs and 
expectations of the consumers. 
III. 
ICT IN SEVERAL FIELDS OF TOURISM 
In this section we will consider some research and 
literature that can show the new way to live the tourism and 
the new face of effective/current travel business. 
A.  Hotel industry 
First of all, we can talk about the new way to look at the 
accommodation reservation. An example of Spanish analysis 
of the new kind of competition in this industry is the work, 
published by F. Calero et al. [9]. This work gives importance 
to the strategic marketing plan by surveys on touristic 
technologic profile and customer demand has got the aim to 
identify connection between technological development and 
accommodations. According to them new enterprises 
activities are strongly influenced by a bind between ICT, 
web services and tourism, connected with the offer and the 
demand. An offer that does not have a technology 
infrastructure is left out from the business. 
The ICT, in the last years, has been changing from an 
information aim into a quality control. The hotel reviews 
published by the costumers in different websites have 
become more and more important. The historical one-way 
relation between business and consumer now is an 
interactive communication: the client can give information 
and opinions about services and act an immediate control in 
everything he is using. The accommodation reviews and the 
judges on hotels and other touristic activities are provided by 
many website. Tourism 2.0 seems to be in a continuous 
evolution and tourist enterprises must always be prepared to 
communicate with more expert and exigent consumer. The 
new phenomenon of the comparisons websites (like 
Tripadvisor and Booking) is accompanied to the new 
requirements of reliability and security which consumers 
seem to look for during online operations. 
In this context operators try to invest stronger effort on 
their own websites with e-booking and e-commerce systems. 
In fact, the new purpose is to reduce the distance between 
travelers by giving important to self organization of holidays. 
Geolocalisation, 
online 
promotion, 
good 
reviews, 
advertisements, free accessibility for getting information and 
transport organization are key-words to look at the online-
costumers who wants to reduce costs and organize in every 
detail in their travel. 
Security of economic transactions and researching of 
information are also essential in this context. The so 
visibility and promotion have to be accompanied to a strong 
operations control and a very qualified online expert [2].  
From 2001 to 2011 the number of reviews on the 
websites like TripAdvisor, Booking.com and Expedia (the 
three most used) [4] has risen from 2 million to 238 million, 
and the forecast for 2013 is about 465 million of reviews. 
Fig. 1 shows the average number of reviews for the hotels 
between the years 2001 and 2011, taking into account the 
estimates for the years 2012 and 2013. Fig. 2 shows the main 
websites consulted by users and visitors between the years 
2001 and 2011 where it is easy to see that the website most 
visited is “TripAdvisor”. As we can see, the evolution of 
reviews has a rising trend that can be modeled using a 3rd 
degree polynomial with a correlation coefficient of 
50

R2=0.9886. The impact of this kind of services is showed by 
the research: 81% finds these reviews important, 46% of 
people who travels looking at post hotel reviews and 49% 
does not book without having read reviews before [4]. These 
data show how ICT plays an essential role in the travel 
planning and in the decision before the travel. It is 
compulsory for the travel brand to give importance to the IT 
for auto-promotion. 
For a hotel is compulsory conform to the globalized 
world in order to mark a difference of the services and offer 
a value-added and create new connections with users. ICT 
brings a total communication and permits to understand the 
demand, controlling every action and every destination [5]. 
An interesting research about hotels and web services is 
presented by J.G. Sabater in [10]. The document is referred 
to the cession of technologies in the hotel industry in Spain. 
The author says that the ICT innovation is the key issue in 
Spanish hotels industry. The paper brings two hypotheses: 
the ICTs offer, from one side, innovation to all the aspects of 
the industry. From the other side ICTs permit to control the 
activities and bring development investment to the hotel 
industry. The paper underlines several conceptual points: 
 
Technologies used to improve the organization 
development. 
 
The access strategies of these technologies. 
 
The collaboration and relation with the technologies 
furnishers and the relevance of the organizations 
strategies. 
 
The kinds of technologies included in the IT 
commercialization demand in Spanish hotels are: 
- Administrative software for the commercialization. 
- Central systems for the hotel reservations. 
- Products: promotional multimedia of the services 
(CD-ROMs, DVDs) [9]. 
B. Social media and travel brands 
The social media are needed in the enterprises’ life which 
is going to be more connected with every kind of new 
Internet profiles. In 2011, the 100% of the travel brand has a 
Facebook profile and the 75% were in Twitter. Thanks to 
this kind of social media in 2011, the 33% of travel brands 
use their marketing budget for promote their enterprise on 
social media channels and the result is that they have reduced 
the public relation services and costs (PR Costs) by 24%. In 
fact every travel brand is enjoy the web because the 71% of 
them say that social medias have improved engagement and 
the 20% of the respondents of the survey talk about these 
products like the most successful marketing format. 
In 2011, social network were the second most influential 
source of online traffic for travel suppliers. A new 
technology that is becoming essential is the geolocalisation. 
Every enterprises and every person starts to live the 
geography in a different way thanks to products like Google 
Local or Foursquare. These are ways to integrate the offline 
reality to the virtual one and improve the information, which 
a person need. For tourism it is a new way to contemplate the 
transports, the localization and the promoting. 
The mobile phone is related to this topic because is an 
instrument which makes the travel more personal and it’s 
used as a commercial vehicle operation. 
In 2011, 20% of travel brands used this medium for 
direct sale and 25% for building awareness. The direct 
bookings via mobile are growth up to 30%. This sector, in a 
short period of time, is going to become a main way of 
commerce and a compulsory choice for the enterprises: 
mobile social network application has surged 126%, that is, 
38.5 million in 2011 [11]. 
The web 2.0 is changing the existence of enterprises the 
ICT and they are so important for the enterprises 
development because: 
 
The nature of the products/services are commented 
by users and it’s a way to meet them 
 
The digital communication is referred in a defined 
way to young people, which is an important sector of 
trades. 
 
IT permit to create relations between users and to 
place the products/services in the market 
 
IT is a way to create, apply and control a marketing 
and communication strategy [12].

C. Tourism in the European e-commerce 
E-commerce on tourism is connected principally with 3 
areas [2]:  
 
e-ticketing, manly for flights  
 
Hotel reservations 
 
OLTA (OnLine Travel Agencies) world, which includes 
touristic packaging 
The use of the resources available on the Internet and the 
introduction of ICT in a country depend on many factors. 
Countries such as Iceland, Norway and Sweden, present the 
highest penetration rates of Internet (near to 90%), 
compared to the United States that presents rates of 77.3% 
[13]. The bottom of this list is occupied by countries with 
warmer climates, such as Spain and Hungary, with rates 
above 65%. If we analyze the global behavior in Europe, 
compared with the rest of world (see Fig. 3), we can see that 
Europe presents average rates of 61.3%, compared to 28.9% 
of the average rate for the rest of the world. Fig. 3 shows the 
10 European countries with the highest number of Internet 
users. These data are taken until December 31, 2011 [14].  
The best way to get information about the holidays 
destinations is to take recommendations from friends, 
colleagues or relatives. “Sharing” is a key word of new way 
intending tourism; in fact reviews and social networks are 
connected with principal sources chosen by travelers for get 
information on travels. At the second place we can see 
Internet websites, at the third the personal experience. Other 
sources for reaching information are: travel/tourist agencies 
and free catalogues and brochures are important. Less 
important than the other are: newspapers, radio and TV, 
paid-for guidebooks and magazines and social media sites 
(see Fig.4). [13]. Fig. 5 shows the most important methods 
used for arranging the holidays. These are the results of 
several inquests, with multiple responses, of the document 
"Attitudes of European Towards Tourism", published by the 
European Commission, where analyzes the behavior of 
European tourists in 2012 [13]. As we can see, the main 
method used is Internet with a 53%, almost the double of the 
second method most used. These data can bring us to reflect 
about the importance of Internet and the experience (ours 
experience or people who we know) in comparison with 
other sources. From these results, it is easy to see the 
importance of the ICTs and web services in the tourist sector. 
Tourism is looking at the web because the travel sector is 
the principal voice of the e-commerce: in Europe it is valued 
on 71,3 billions of euro (29% of the total). The e-commerce 
permitted also to increase the interactive ways of 
communication between tourism and people who decide to 
planning travels online. In fact the World Wide Web is 
globally widespread: the penetration in Europe is about 
48,5% and in the north of the continent we can find also 
country with 90% of people which use internet. This is 
connected with percentages of people who chose Internet as 
principle way for reaching information and organize travels. 
The e-commerce represent the world of people who buy 
tickets online, reserve accommodations and buy holidays 
services (renting cars, reserve activities...)  
D. Web services and ICT in some Southern European 
Countries 
So far we have analyzed and shown global values of 
Europe. European population presents several preferences in 
the election of resources for arranging the holiday. In this 
section we discuss the statistic values for southern European 
countries. Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Greece are 
analyzed and compared. We have selected these countries 
because they share a tradition of direct intervention in the 
cultural field, contrary to anglo-saxon or scandinavian 
countries [15]. In addition, there are some studies which link 
climate issues with the choosing of tourist destinations [16]. 
Analyzed countries are located within the 20 most visited 
countries in the world [17]. But we can find other factors. 
South Europe is observed like a real brand from the tourist 
point of view of offer and demand. In one hand, Statistics 
show that Europe is divided in two parts taking into account 
how population uses Internet. Northern Europe people are 
keen on using the web and it is related to their way to 
organize their travel. Southern European countries (which 
concentrate the most 
important tourist destinations) 
populations use Internet less than Northern people. These 
differences between north and south show, from cultural and 
social point of view, that people have different requirements 
which influence the choice of using Internet as a source for 
organizing travels.

On the other hand, countries with a higher Public Interest 
Litigation (PIL) are closer to the ICT utilization for getting 
information and organize tourism. In the south of Europe the 
use of Internet is getting more and more spread while the 
tourist activity is becoming important. Tourist field is strictly 
affected by this period of economic uncertainty. In this paper 
we are going to analyze some countries between the most 
affected by the crisis. However, the unequal use of internet in 
different countries makes it hard to get useful information 
and unified, in order to be able to process it. For example, in 
Italy the touristic sector does not permit a general view of the 
touristic organization because it is divided into the 21 
regions existing in the country, which obstacles to unify the 
offer. In Portugal and Spain the touristic inbound is increased 
considerately thanks to northern European countries. Their 
tourist force is based on the climate situation and prizes 
change situation in Europe because of the crisis. In 2011, 
Portugal and Spain has a B2C increase of the inbound and in 
Greece, a negative decrease. In these countries situation is 
worst from the outbound point of view: flows of tourism in 
crisis affected countries are decreased while the demand is 
stabilized in the North-center Europe countries. These data 
shows the complexity between relations in tourism field in 
different Europeans areas [18]. From 2008, France and Spain 
start to change their tourist planning offer in order to 
adequate themselves to the crisis emergency needs. In Spain 
the Spanish government and “Tourespaña- Insituto del 
Turismo de España”[19] develop a new marketing strategic 
plan in collaboration with tour operators and autonomy 
Regions, which included the positioning of the Spain Brand 
via online marketing and policy adaptation on new 
technologies. France modified the structural attitude via 
creating a new organism, Atout France [20], which give 
importance to the online promotion by increasing their own 
website and the on line communication with customers [21]. 
1) Spain 
In 2012 we can see in which products the Spanish people 
decide to use internet as a commerce vehicle use by 27% of 
people [22]. We can identify the 10 activities with the 
biggest online turnover in Spain. In the list we find travel 
agencies and tour operators (12,7%), air transports (12,0%), 
Direct Marketing (7,2%), earth transport of people (5,4%), 
Hazard games (4,5), artistic and sportive shows (4,1%), 
clothes (3,1%), advertisement (2,9%) and household 
appliances (2,5%) and hotels (2,1%) [23]. Fig. 6 shows the 
most important activities. It’s easy to see how internet is 
important for Spanish people with reference to organized 
travel, looking at the direct commerce online.  
2) Italy 
In Italy only the 15% of people buys online but actually 
has got a very fast development. In the online turnover main 
sectors are the spare time market, (56.9%), tourism (24.8%) 
assurances (5,9%), electronic products (5,3%), editorial 
(2,3%), online shopping center (1,8%), feeding (1,2%), 
fashion (1,1%), house and furniture (0,3%), health care and 
beauty (0,2%) (See Fig. 7) [24]. 
In 2008 the Italian e-commerce increased for billions of 
euro: 75% of this is due to the tourism. Despite this we can 
see a slowdown in growth about 40-50% related with the 
sector which represent more than the 90% of online 
transactions: the e-ticketing and hotel reservations. The 
package business is increased instead of the 41% [25]. 
E-commerce is giving surge to the tourism industry. In 
2001 Italy travel trades with credit cards online is about 6,4 
billions of euro in the months of July and august, which 
represent 13,9% of the total. The touristic e-commerce 
abroad is the 51,3% of the 890 millions of euro spent by 
Italians for travelling in the summer months [26]. Principal 
destinations planned by e-commerce for Italians are France 
(15%), UK (11,2%) and Spain (9,3). Tourist which came 
from Portugal, Spain and Greece acted like a 3,4%, with an 
annual decrease of 16,7. Countries which generate online 
transactions for the “Italian product” are: USA (38,7%), 
France (10,7%), Belgium (10,5%), UK (9,8%), Italy (7,9%) 
[16].

3) Greece 
Now we will see how internet is located in touristic 
behavior of Greece. 31,2 % of Greece people think that the 
friends and relatives suggestion is the most important source 
for reaching information about travels, for 23,1% is internet, 
18,5personal experience, 7,2% travel agencies and 6,7% 
commercial guides and journals. In Greece people who have 
internet access in 2010 represent from the 48,4% and the 
44,4%. In general internet is use mainly by young people 
from 25 to 34 years old with a middle-high education level. 
The mobile internet access is mainly used by men (68,8%). 
The new kind of connection which is used is mainly the 
broadband (88,8%), followed by modem or ISDN, used by 
10,2% of users and 5,3% connection with mobile. The ages 
of those traveling in Greece, is distributed as follows (see 
Table 1) [26]. As we can see, the people with ages between 
44 and 64 years are those most travelers. They are followed 
by the young aged between 25 and 34 years. 
4) Portugal 
In 2010, the 48,8% of houses had an Internet access. 
Young people in Portugal are much related with new 
technologies; in fact smart phones and new mobile phone 
are going to be very used. According to Google Portugal 
travels are the products most bought, which represent 48% 
of the total of e-commerce [26]. 
5) France 
The e-tourism in France is increasing and French people 
used very frequently to look at the Internet before 
organizing their travels in a travel agency. In 2010 81% of 
French people (mainly from 25 to 34 years old, in a middle-
high education level) use Internet to plan their travels. In 
2010 10 millions of French people bought their holidays on 
web. 4% reserved their travel via smart phone or tablet. In 
this sector the users are very young: the average age 
decrease and the mobile phone reservation increase:   
 
18-24 years old users: 9%. 
 
25-34 years old users: 6%. 
 
35-49 years old users: 3%.  
This sector is used mainly by men (5,7%) instead 
women (2,7%) [26]. In 2012, the 56% of internet users (in 
France) used internet in order to travel. In other countries as 
Germany or U.K, this value is higher than the 64%, with a 
value of 71%, for U.K.

6) Comparison between the five countries 
In order to understand the evolution of ICT in the tourism 
industry, we have analyzed the number of Internet users for 
each country that has been discussed. Figs. 8 and 9 show the 
evolution of the number of internet users in the five countries 
during the years 2004-2010. As Fig. 8 shows, in 2010, Spain 
and France register an increase of nearly 200%, with respect 
to the number of recorded users’ in 2004. In the other side, 
Portugal registers a decrease of 28% of users in only 6 years 
(from almost 10 million to less than 5 million). Greece and 
Italy maintain the same number of Internet users during these 
years. During these years (with crisis), Internet is being used 
as a tool or vehicle to improve the countries' economy from 
the tourism sector, especially in Italy, Spain and France. We 
could not obtain data from Greece, for the years 2004 and 
2008, and data for Italy for 2006.  
Regarding to the information sources used in the five 
countries to make a decision about the travel plans [25], we 
can distinguish the following: 
 
Recommendations of friends, colleagues or similar. 
 
Internet Websites. 
 
Personal experience. 
 
Travel / tourist agencies. 
 
Free catalogues, brochures. 
 
Paid-for guidebooks and magazines. 
 
Newspaper, Radio, TV. 
 
Social media sites. 
Fig.10 shows the main information sources that citizens 
of these 5 countries usually use. As we can see, that the most 
used resource in the majority of countries remains the 
recommendations of friends and family. The second 
information source is the Internet resources. The case of Italy 
shows that the first information source is the Internet 
resources, followed by recommendations from friends and 
family. Social media sites such as Internet forums, weblogs, 
social blogs, microblogging, wikis, social networks, 
podcasts, etc., are placed in the last position. 
For our purpose is interesting to look at the e-commerce 
tendencies in Europe. In fact the e-commerce and the use of 
web services are strongly related with tourism, which is 
always connected with online trading. In Europe, the e-
commerce has a good situation for the increasing in the last 
years: this sector represent the new trading way for the 
enterprises of tourism [24]. The ICT and web services are 
going to be widespread at the same level in every country 
and tourism is actually a field which is referred to online 
transitions [25]. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION 
After this research and these statistics we can talk about 
the relation between tourism and internet. The possibility to 
buy online travel products is directly proportional to the 
accessibility of the country to the web world. In fact in the 
Northen Countries, where using internet is more widespread 
than in the south, we have higher numbers of users and 
people who use intert as vehicle of travel organizing. We can 
say that in Southern Countries the internet is mainly used by 
you people from 25 to 34 years old, whit a middle-high 
education and a good access to the web. 
France is the first country by number of people who use 
internet for reaching information about the travel. Portugal is 
the last one: this can be compared with the possibility by the 
population to use internet. Generally reaching information by 
suggestion of people we know is the most used vehicle. This 
reason underlines the importance to get information by other 
people and look, for example, at social networks. Interne is 
going to be the most used way to organizing a holiday. 
Portugal is the country which needs an effort to arrive the 
average European level of using internet for reaching 
information about travels. 
For Italy and Spain the e-commerce is very important 
and, despite the crisis, they are increasing the internet 
accessibility. Internet in these countries is a strong changing 
in the field of tourism. Despite the crisis it brings 
promotional and marketing good consequences. It is due to 
the strictly relation between internet users and consumers. 
Relations who decrease costs and let meet the demand and 
the offer.  
The mobile phone is going to be very important and it is 
use bay a very young set of population (even less than18 
years old) and this is the new generation of people who will 
reserve everything in the travels by using mobile 
applications. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
We have demonstrated that Internet provides many 
benefits to the field of tourism. Web navigation can bring the 
consumers to a high availability (24x7x365 service, 24 
hours, 365 days a year), providing the possibility of reaching 
a heterogeneous and big quantity of information. Web is a 
cheaper way to plan holidays and look at different and 
competitive information for a more personal decision, 
without intermediary costs and time wasting. 
The conclusions drawn from this study may serve to 
mitigate/harmonize the regional tourist requirements. It can 
also be used to adapt and improve existing portals and web 
services to new demands and customer needs, considering 
their comments. We really believe that this document can 
help creators and researchers of tourism websites. 
The dawn of internet era enabled to go from a “funnel” 
situation into a “platform” one, from an oligopoly situation 
into a free-market one: the tourist is no more a simple actor 
but has become the center of the industry. Many 
technologies have changed the tourism industry by create a 
new B2C: the web marketing and websites of reviews are 
essential for the hotel industries, the social medias are a new 
vehicle of communication and trading and the tourism is 
located in a very central position in the e-commerce 
turnover. Have a look on his phenomenon helped us to 
achieve a better understanding of new touristic trends and 
new ways of marketing and promoting. 
Moreover, unify the offer is a correct way to promote a 
specific destination areas: the aim of this work is identify 
specific needs of some countries in a more general optical 
view.

The future of the IT in B2C tourism field has some 
perspectives which can be referred to the present evolution. 
Firstly, we will assist to a total digitalization of the 
costumers, so the entire organization of travels will be based 
on the dynamic packaging phenomenon. Challenge between 
products and destination will grow up very strongly and 
tourist will change totally their way to travel and organize 
holydays. It is important how this natural change of these 
perspectives will affect the touristic jobs. Travel agencies 
will lose their role as intermediaries. Moreover, e-marketing 
and destination marketing will adapt their role for new 
requirements. Furthermore, enterprises will focus the 
personal choose on computer-knowledge and its experience.
