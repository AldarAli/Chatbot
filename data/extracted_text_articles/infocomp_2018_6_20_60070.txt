Abstract—Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been used 
on construction job sites for a variety of purposes for more 
than a decade. But the risks and hazards of flying UAVs on 
construction job sites has never been quantitatively or 
qualitatively evaluated. While the general aviation industry 
has 
been 
using 
sophisticated 
analysis 
techniques 
to 
quantitatively assess the risks of general aviation industry 
flights over the general population for decades, the risks of 
UAV flights over this group has never been quantitatively 
assessed. UAVs are being used in construction activities on a 
regularly without proper risk assessment. There is no action 
plan in place, by either construction managers or safety 
officers, to design UAV flights based on safety measures. This 
paper presents the first known quantitative and qualitative 
analyses of UAV flight risks for construction job sites. A 
quantitative model for UAV flight risk assessment is presented 
and tested, using the Monte Carlo simulation technique, for an 
actual construction job site. A qualitative risk assessment of 
UAV flights is also presented by combining the Federal 
Aviation 
Administration 
(FAA) 
rules, 
regulations 
and 
guidelines concerning UAV flights, with the safety needs and 
specifications of UAV flights on a construction job site. The 
techniques introduced in this paper can be used by 
construction managers and safety officers to take safety into 
account when planning UAV flights over construction job sites. 
This paper further argues that using techniques and methods 
introduced in this research paper could potentially make UAV 
flights in any environment safer and more reliable.

 INTRODUCTION 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred 
to as drones, have been used in the construction industry for 
over ten years [1]–[3]. The versatility of UAVs enables users 
to capture different types of data (typically visual) easily 
from angles which might not be possible without such a 
device. The relatively low cost of new generations of UAVs 
along with the possibility of having different sensors 
attached to them, such as high resolution and thermal 
cameras, RFID readers, and laser scanners, have played a 
crucial role in their proliferation in construction research and 
practice. The applications explored for using UAVs in 
construction includes construction progress monitoring [4], 
[5], overall site monitoring [6], structural health inspection 
[7]–[11], surveying job sites and building 3D models [12], 
infrastructure asset management [13]–[16], urban monitoring 
[17], material tracking [18], sustainable energy production 
management [19], and construction safety [20]. The 
applications and use of UAVs have increased exponentially 
while the safety risks associated with UAV flights have not 
been studied thoroughly.  
As a general approach, the risks associated with flying 
UAVs over a job site can be divided into two categories:  
1. direct hazards, such as the falling of the UAV and 
falling debris from a collision of a UAV with other 
objects [21][22]; and  
2. indirect hazards, such as the invasion of personal space 
[23][24], diverting the attention of workers due to the 
UAVs’ sound and motion (thereby increasing their 
cognitive load while performing their tasks [25]–[27]), 
and invasion of a workers’ personal space [28]. 
The construction industry is often critiqued for its high 
rate of fatalities and poor safety record. The total number of 
work-related fatalities in the United States in 2015 was 
4,836, 20% of which occurred within construction (more 
than any other industry). From construction, falls, slips and 
trips are the highest cause of fatal incidents, with 364 cases. 
Transportation incidents were the second highest cause (with 
226 cases) and contact with objects came third (with 159 
cases) [29]. These statistics show the importance of the role 
of equipment in construction safety and establish the need 
for better monitoring and regulation of their use. Safe use of 
construction equipment, such as excavators, loaders, and 
cranes has been thoroughly regulated due to prolong use in 
construction. In contrast, new equipment introduced to the 
job sites, such as UAVs, do not have specific regulations in 
place for managing their safety in use. Flying UAVs can be 
challenging in any environment. Construction job sites are 
dynamic systems that are constantly changing. These 
constant changes could make flying UAVs even more 
challenging, potentially introducing more hazards to 
construction activity. The lack of a comprehensive 
qualitative and quantitative methodology for risk assessment 
of UAVs on construction sites coupled with a rapid increase 
in their use poses a new safety threat that requires attention. 
This paper proposes and evaluates quantitative and 
qualitative approaches for modeling the safety risks related 
to UAV flights over construction job sites. The method is 
applied to a case study from a building project at the 
University of Florida to demonstrate the methods application 
and significance.

II. 
RULES AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING UAV FLIGHTS 
IN THE UNITED STATES 
In the US, the Federal Aviation Industry (FAA) is the 
main agency for managing civil aviation. The FAA regulates 
the Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) (a broader category 
for UAVs) flights by dividing the UAV uses into the 
following two main categories: (1) fly for hobby purposes 
and (2) fly for commercial use. UAS Flight rules issued by 
FAA are as follow [30][31]:  
 
A. Fly under the Special Rule for Model Aircraft 
(Section 336) 
• 
Only used for entertainment or hobby purposes. 
• 
The model aircraft need to be registered. 
• 
Follow community-based safety guidelines and 
fly within the programming of a national 
community-based organization. 
• 
The weight limit of the aircraft is 55 lbs., unless 
certified by a community-based organization. 
• 
Flying range cannot exceed visual line-of-sight. 
• 
Never fly near other aircraft. 
• 
The airport and air traffic control tower must be 
notified in advance if a model aircraft is flying 
within 5 miles of an airport. 
• 
Never fly near emergency response efforts. 
 
B. Fly under the FAA’s small UAS Rule (Part 107) 
• 
Fly for recreational or business use. 
• 
The drone must be registered. 
• 
Require a remote pilot certificate issued by the 
FAA. 
• 
Weight of drone under 55 lbs. 
• 
Flight speed at or under 100 mph. 
• 
Flying range cannot exceed visual line-of-sight. 
• 
Never fly near other aircraft or over people. 
• 
Do not fly in controlled airspace near airports 
until you get the permission from FAA. 
• 
Fly only during daylight or civil twilight.  
• 
Flying height limit is 400 feet. 
• 
Never fly from a moving vehicle, unless in a 
sparsely populated area. 
 
Generally, to simplify the most critical aspects of these 
rules, this paper makes the following assumptions: (1) the 
construction site used as the case study is not close to the 5-
mile radius of any airport; (2) all UAV flying regulations are 
being followed; (3) UAV flights are taking place within the 
line-of-sight of the pilot; (4) UAV specifications comply 
with FAA regulations, and more importantly (5) UAVs are 
not flying through the space over people’s heads for safety 
consideration. These assumptions are specifically highlighted 
in the qualitative risk analysis that is provided in the 
discussion and conclusion sections. 
III. 
RISKS OF UAV FLIGHTS 
A. Quantifying Risks of UAV Flights  
Quantifying risks associated with UAV flights over 
construction job sites is a crucial factor in determining the 
safety of UAVs flights over construction project zones. By 
having a quantifiable analysis of UAV flight risks, 
construction managers and superintendents and in general 
decision makers in this industry, based on reliable metrics, 
are able to assess the extent of risks related to UAV flights. 
Also, a quantifiable risks analysis of UAV flights will give 
insurance companies a better insight into the value, extent 
and severity of risks associated with UAV flights on 
construction job sites. In this paper, based on the Clothier 
and Walker [22] approach, the authors define a model to 
measure and describe ground fatality expectation. The model 
only measures and enumerates the risk of expected ground 
fatalities based on falling UAVs or falling debris.  
 
While this model quantifies the direct risks of falling 
UAVs, or debris, it does not consider the indirect risks 
associated with UAV flights. Some of the indirect risks that 
are not considered in this model but could have a significant 
impact on the general risks of UAV flights are: (1) 
threatening workers’ personal space, (2) threatening privacy 
of workers and (3) potential distraction of workers due to 
noise and motion. 
Clothier and Walker [22] formalized the ground fatality 
expectation model as below: 
 
                          SO = MR * φ * AL                             (1)                        
 
where: SO is the safety objective in terms of the number 
of fatalities per flight hours; φ is the population density of 
the area under the flight path of the UAV; AL is the lethal 
area, which is determined by the circular area of the 
maximum length of UAV diameter plus a (safety) buffer; 
and MR is the mishap rate, calculated according to (2). 
 
                   MR = SFR + MCDebris + Other                (2)         
 
where: SFR is the system failure rate per flight hour; 
MCDebris is the quantity of debris from a possible midair 
collision per flight hour, and Other is the other hazards that 
might result in fatality risks. 
Based on [1], the fatality rate, which is expected in the 
industry of common air travels, is generally bounded to 
1*10-06 or in other words one casualty for every million 
flight hours. However, due to a lack of data about the 
causalities, fatalities and injuries caused by UAVs around the 
world, it is not possible for the authors to establish a fatality 
81

INFOCOMP 2018 : The Eighth International Conference on Advanced Communications and Computation

rate for UAV flights. For this reason, the same safe rate of 
fatality as the general aviation industry (one in a million 
flight hours) was adopted.  
B. Qualitative Risks of UAV Flights  
As discussed in Section 2, FAA established a series of 
general rules and regulations for UAV flights within the 
national air space. Two of these rules and regulations are 
specifically important for the construction industry: (1) never 
fly a UAV out of the pilot’s line of sight and (2) never fly a 
UAV over a populated area, which means that it is illegal to 
fly a UAV over people’s heads. Based on these specific 
regulations, the authors developed a qualitative safety map 
for UAV flights over the job site that has been used as a case 
study in this research and is presented in the analysis section. 
IV. 
USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATION AS A RISK 
ASSESSMENT METHOD  
Risk and uncertainty are prevalent throughout every 
construction project [32]. It is necessary to conduct 
quantitative risk analysis to evaluate failure and safety risks 
to provide a platform as a means of decision making. A 
dichotomy of risk assessment techniques is into deterministic 
and probabilistic methods [33]. Deterministic methods 
ignore uncertainty, while probabilistic methods are able to 
take into account unexplained variances in factors as diverse 
as time, weather, spatial demands, and labor performance 
[34]. Due to the fact that in this study, several uncertainty 
elements including behavior of the UAVs and the work area 
conditions are part of the assumptions, a probabilistic 
method was adopted.  The Monte-Carlo method is a 
commonly 
adopted 
probabilistic 
technique 
in 
the 
construction industry due to the high levels of uncertainty 
and the large financial investments in this type of work [35]. 
Mooney [36] defines Monte-Carlo simulation as a 
computerized 
mathematical 
approach 
that 
enables 
researchers to perform quantitative risk analysis through a 
decision making process. The approach replaces point 
estimates with random variables drawn from representative 
probability density functions [37], refining the results 
through a large sampling of possible outcomes [38]. 
Occupational safety and health risks and associated hazards 
can be modeled using Monte-Carlo by considering the 
stochastic nature of the problems[39]. Baudry [40] suggested 
using a range-based Multi-Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis as a 
scenario that addresses the group decision making under 
high uncertainty, to consider different viewpoints of the 
stakeholders. Later, the binocular optical axis parallel 
detection method was used by Ying [41] to analyze the error 
factors and establish a model based on Monte-Carlo 
simulation. Applying this method, and given different values 
for corresponding coordinates, the analysis is conducted 
[41]. Podgorny [42], using a Monte-Carlo based model, 
examined 
three-dimensional 
radiative 
transfer 
over 
inhomogeneous surface albedo including open water, sea ice, 
and melt ponds by flying UAVs over these areas The goal of 
this study was to investigate the influence of surface feature 
erraticism on the energy budget of the lower troposphere 
ice–ocean system. Also, Monte-Carlo simulation has been 
used to determine and examine the active relationship 
between the factors leading to an accident and the 
recompense paid for it [42]-[44]. In a real-time location-
based Monte Carlo simulation, Li et al. [45] used historical 
data to forecast the safety hazard level on a separate level 
based on time and position. On construction job sites, small 
UAVs require safety consideration due to uncertain 
operational conditions, such as their weak structural shape 
that may cause instability and failure in windy weather, their 
potential for operational errors, as well as their high 
maneuverability and potential for mechanical failures. 
Recently, Plioutsias et al. [46] concluded in a research paper 
that current commercial UAVs are far from being able to 
meet safety requirements. To simulate collision and other 
hazards between one or multiple UAVs operating on 
construction sites and their bordering area, the Monte-Carlo 
simulation method offers both flexibility and potential 
accuracy in modeling. This method is playing an important 
role in modeling uncertainties, such as the movement of 
different kinds of object on a construction site and 
environmental factors, such as wind [47]-[50]. 
 
V. 
ANALYSIS OF THE CASE STUDY 
A. Analysis of Quantifying Risks of UAV Flights 
In this section, a Monte Carlo Simulation is used to 
assess the risk of flying UAVs over construction job sites, 
which is referred to as the Safety Objective (SO) as 
described by (1) above. Mishap Rate (MR), the Lethal Area 
(AL) and the density of population (φ) are needed to find the 
SO in each area. MR is the variable with the least empirical 
data as there is not much information recorded on the MR of 
UAVs. In this analysis, it is assumed that the UAV lifetime, 
or the duration over which the possibility of a crash exists, is 
normally distributed, with a range between 100 hours and 
10,000 hours, a mean of 5,050 hours, and standard deviation 
of 1,650 hours. MR is referred to as the rate of failed UAV 
flights in a given flight hour lifetime for a UAV. In this case, 
the normal productive life of a UAV is estimated to be in this 
range. As a result, MR is calculated as one crash in a UAV’s 
lifetime: 1 / (lifetime of UAV in flight hours). 
AL is the area that has the potential for lethal impact from 
the UAV or debris if the UAV crashes. Typically, it is 
calculated by using the longest dimension of a UAV. In this 
case, considering the fact that most of the UAVs flying over 
construction job sites are commercially available, it is 
presumed that AL can assume a value between 0.3 m and 1.8 
m. Thus, an even distribution across a diameter with a 
minimum of 0.3 m and maximum of 1.8 m is used in the 
simulation. The density (φ) represents the number of 
personnel on the site divided by the area of the location that a 
UAV flies over. In this study, it is assumed that only 
construction workers are present at the job site. Due to a lack 
of empirical data it is estimated that the number of 
construction personnel on the job site varies between 2 and 
14 with a normal distribution (a mean of 8, a standard 
deviation of 2). The density is calculated for Area 1 to Area 
4 by dividing the sampled number of construction workers 
82

for each zone by its area. The area of each location that a 
UAV can fly over is calculated and shown in Figures 1 and 
2. The area surrounding the job site is divided into Area 1 
through Area 4 using the logic of FAA regulations regarding 
safe UAV flights, which prohibits UAV flights over head of 
people, in this case construction personnel.  
 
 
 
Figure 1. General layout of the construction site 
Thus, considering the pathways that construction personnel 
routinely commute between work stations and the job site, 
four separate areas are drawn as separate areas that UAVs 
can fly over. Due to these regulations, UAVs cannot fly from 
one of these areas to another because they need to fly over a 
construction personnel pathway, which is prohibited by FAA 
regulations. A Monte Carlo simulation was run using the 
Palisade @Risk 7.5. The number of simulation iterations was 
controlled for convergence of the mean and standard 
deviation of the SO (safety objective) results for each area. 
The simulation was run until it reached convergence with 
95% confidence and 5% tolerance. The convergence was 
checked every 600 iterations. The simulation reached 
convergence at 174,000 iterations. The results of the Monte 
Carlo simulation are summarized as follows:

B. Analysis of Qualititative Risks of UAV Flights 
The FAA regulations prohibit flying over head of 
peoples’ heads. Thus, in Figure 1, we need to restrict the 
areas that are safe for UAV flights. This logic leads to Figure 
2, where each area is restricted by the workers’ pathways 
that act as borders between each area. Taking FAA 
regulations into account, the following issues need to be 
considered in developing a qualitative risk assessment color-
coded map for UAV flights:  
• 
UAV no-fly zone areas are shown in red. These are 
the areas that are absolutely forbidden for UAVs to 
fly over/on due to federal rules. 
• 
The area immediately adjacent to the red areas are 
shown in orange as it is risky to fly close to a no-fly 
zone.

• 
Any existing construction equipment is shown with 
orange as it is risky to fly over, on or adjacent to 
moving objects. 
• 
In this example, there are two tower cranes which, by 
nature, are constantly moving in three dimensions.  
Considering these facts, a color-coded safety map using 
green for safe to fly areas, orange for risky to fly areas, and 
red for no-fly zones, is constructed and shown in Figure 11. 
Authors believe that this is the first UAV safety heat map for 
construction that qualitatively categorizes the relative risks 
of UAV flights over job sites.

VI. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
This paper presents qualitative and quantitative risk 
analyses of UAVs flights over construction job site 
environments. It is the first known study discussing risks of 
UAVs flights over construction job sites using a Monte-
Carlo simulation as a well-known qualitative analysis and 
also a quantitative analysis based on FAA rules and 
regulations.  
By using Monte-Carlo simulation, it is shown that the 
risks of flying a UAV (with a given probability of UAV size, 
over an active construction job site, with a given probability 
of construction crew presence) the mean risk of a fatality 
incident varies from 5.670E-006.  In other words, this 
predicts more than five fatalities in a million flight hours, to 
1.042E-006 (almost one fatality in a million flight hours). 
Based on Clothier and Walker [22], the general aviation 
industry fatality rate is restricted to one fatal incident in one 
million flight hours. While it is not truly accurate to 
propagate the fatality rate of the general aviation industry to 
the UAV industry, authors use the general aviation industry 
as a reference to compare the risks due to the lack of data on 
qualitative risks of UAV flights. By comparing the 
simulation results to the general aviation industry restricted 
fatality rate, which is one fatality in a million flight hours, it 
is seen in the case study that most areas have higher than 
normal fatality risks of flights. Thus, it is up to construction 
managers or safety officer to decide on the appropriateness 
of UAV flights on this construction site. 
So far, a quantitative method has been presented that 
provides a specific number for expected fatalities per million 
UAV flight hours. Using this quantitative method, it is 
straightforward for anyone (whether or not they have 
knowledge of risk assessment and/or expertise in UAV 
flights) to determine whether it is safe to fly a UAV within 
specific zone. This provides safety managers, project 
managers, owners and insurance companies with valuable 
insight on the safety of proposed UAV flights.  
The FAA rules and regulations prohibit UAVs to fly over 
peoples’ heads, over or close to airports and set a series of 
specific guidelines regarding UAVs operations. Combing 
these FAA guidelines with safety specification of UAVs 
flights in construction job site environments, such as higher 
risk of UAV collision in proximity of tower cranes, a 
qualitative color-coded safety map is generated that shows 
the relatively safer areas for UAV flights, using green, 
compare to medium UAV flight risks areas, with orange 
color, and no-fly zones, or the highest risks of UAV flights 
zones with red. Figure 11 presents this qualitative safety 
map. Areas above sidewalks, pathways and construction 
personnel work stations are shaded as red, as it is not safe to 
fly a UAV over these areas. The work radius of tower cranes 
85

is marked with two distinct circles. Areas in proximity of 
tower cranes are shaded in orange, as it is risky to fly UAVs 
in close proximity to tower cranes. The areas that are shaded 
green are the ones without any known safety hazards. This 
simple map can be used when no data is available regarding 
the number of workers present on site and/or when general 
assessment of safe-fly-zones and no-fly-zones are being 
performed.    
These two analyses, qualitative and quantitative, enable 
construction managers, safety officers and insurance 
companies to detect, explore and address the risks of UAV 
flights in construction job site environments, which will help 
the construction industry to better manage the safety 
concerns of UAV flights.
