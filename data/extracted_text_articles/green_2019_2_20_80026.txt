Abstract—Currently,
there
is
a
global
acceptance
of
transforming the transport industry by replacing conventional
vehicles by Electric Vehicles (EVs) as a means of reducing
greenhouse gas and mitigating carbon emissions problems
associated with conventional vehicles. The year 2017 was a
milestone for sustainable automobile production, with electric
vehicles deployments going above 100 million units globally.
Much of the deployment occurred in China. China has the
highest number of electric vehicles per capita in the world. The
deployment approach has been very aggressive causing serious
strain in its electricity grid and the environment as a result of a
large amount of electricity demanded by this fleet of Chinese
electric vehicles, and also as deploying electric vehicles in
China is highly associated with the carbon emissions from
electricity generated from coal. The South Africa automobile
industry is preparing for a similar deployment model, in which
50% of all vehicles will be electric by 2050. Noting that South
Africa currently suffers from endemic electricity supply
inconsistency and as over 90% of its electricity is generated
from coal, it is important to have an informed policy on the
cost and benefits of the deployment model from lessons learned
from China.

INTRODUCTION
The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals
(UNSDG) in general have an ambitious and transformational
vision for the globe- striving for a world where the
environment of humans and other species is safe, resilient
and sustainable [1]. The Fourth Industrial Revolution builds
on the digital and technological revolution and leads to
unprecedented paradigm shifts in the grid warranting a
transformation of entire systems. The automobile and
transport industry is a significant influence of this shift
through the introduction of EVs [2]. Most economies have
generally supported that conventional vehicles should be
replaced with EVs as EVs have the potentials to significantly
reduce gas emissions from the transport sector. Viewing EVs
deployment as an effective measure to reduce the climate
impact of the transport sector, governments around the world
have initiated strategies and frameworks to encourage
producers and consumers to drive electric vehicles [3]. This
study will be assessing China’s policy implications as a road
map for the South African deployment policy. China
deployment strategy caused strain on its electric grid and
increased its carbon footprint. Bearing in mind South
Africa’s weak electricity grid with typical periodic shortfalls
and its significant electricity generation capacity from fossil
fuel resources, more knowledge about the challenges ahead
will be beneficial.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, we go over related literature review. Section III presents
the methodology and Section IV is the results and analysis.
The conclusion and future work are listed in Section V.
II.
LITERATURE REVIEW
This section presents an overview of the developments
to China’s EV market and compares trends related to South
Africa.
The Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) is a multi-
government policy designed
under the
Clean Energy
Ministerial (CEM) in 2009 [4]. The primary goal is
“dedicated
to
conducting
collaborative
activities
that
support the design and implementation of EV policies and
programs” [4]. The EVI currently has 16 member states as
partners. The United States, Canada, and China are currently
co-leading the EVI.

According to [3], China is currently the largest electric
car market in the world, accounting for more than 40% of
all-electric car sales in the world as of 2016. “In 2016,

China became the country with the largest electric car stock,
with about a third of the global total with more than 200
million electric two-wheelers, 3 to 4 million Low-Speed
Electric Vehicles (LSEVs) and more than 300 thousand
electric buses” [3]. An increase in EV demand has also led
to an increase in public and private charging infrastructure.
“In 2016, the annual growth rate of publicly available
charging (72%) was higher, but of a similar magnitude, than
the electric car stock growth rate in the same year (60%)”
[3]. Through the New Energy Vehicle (NEV) program,
China aimed at an EV market stock of about 80 million by
2030.
The
aggressive
deployment
strategy
has
some
associated implications on the grid and the carbon footprint
of the country. South Africa Green Transport Strategy
(GTS), with a goal aimed at transforming the transport
sector to 50% EV by 2050, seems to be on this same path.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) [6] conducted
an extensive research investigating different scenarios for
EV deployment in China and the associated implications
thereof with regard to energy portfolio, economics, and the
environment. It identified that the impact of EVs in terms of
CO2 emissions and on-grid capacity at the national level
largely depends on the charging strategy and EV design. As
a result, the analysis conducted in this paper utilized this
important outcome as a basis for assessing the EV impact,
by evaluating the effect of two commonly deployed EV
designs (PHEV and BEV) in the Chinese market on
independent variables.

METHODOLOGY
The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) was used to show
evidence of a relationship between the independent and
dependent variables. The following tests were performed:

Unit root test

OLS estimation test

Serial correlation

Normality

Heteroscedasticity
A.
Data Sourcing and Limitations
The dependent variables (total grid capacity, electricity
generated from coal and emission from coal) were sourced
from the World Bank. The independent variable (EV
demand) was sourced from EV Volumes [8]. The analysis
only considered 10 years of yearly data (2009 to 2019) due
to a lack of data. The lack of accurate and reliable data has
been identified as a significant problem hindering the
development of useful EV-grid models and strategies [7].

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Traditionally, the OLS requires that a cointegration and
error term be determined between the independent and the
dependent variables through the Engle-Granger analytical
technique. However, the technique was not utilized due to
limited observations and also because the aim of the paper
was mainly to show evidence of a relationship between the
independent and dependent variables.

All conducted unit root tests (Table I) produced a
stationary outcome at 1st difference. The p values from all
series were below 0.05.
The OLS estimation (Table II) detects if a relationship
exists between the independent variables (PHEV & BEV)
and dependent variables (GC, EGC & EC). Outcomes from
estimation tests produced a p-value of results <0.05. The
regression
analysis
further
confirmed
reliability
by
obtaining an R-squared of 94% for PHEV and 60% for
BEV.
Table III presents the results of the diagnostic tests.
Here, the errors were normally distributed. Serial correlation
was not detected. The White’s test and the Arch test reflect
that the series are homoscedastic.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Replacing conventional vehicles with EV's deployment
is a delicate transformation that requires extensive research
that would guide policy towards reliable and applicable
strategies.
Instead
of the
current
ongoing
excitement
concerning deploying EVs in South Africa as soon as
possible,
an
effective
cost-benefit
analysis
should
be
conducted on the currently planned deployment goals.
Important topics gathered from this study as lessons for
South Africa are as follows:

It is important to re-evaluate the deployment model to
determine the percentage and grid network tolerance. It
will be very aggressive to radically transform the
transport industry such as 50% of all vehicles should be
electric by 2050. South Africa does not have the
potential for such a fast pace transformation, but rather
a slower transformation with realistic periodic targets.

End-user efficiency and consumption policing will be
fundamental for ensuring consistency between the grid
capacity and end-users demand. EVs penetration level
of 50 % can cause serious low-voltage levels and grid
supply shortfalls in the long-run to end-users.

Other things to consider include: will the EVs market
boom? Is complete automation an option, such as EVs
with solar panels? Will the supply from renewable
energy sustain the predicted demand?
The
reflected
evidence
from
China’s
case
gives
information on the importance of developing sustainable
automated systems that can precisely monitor the demand of
EVs to grid capacity periodically and also assess charging
strategies and EV models to grid capacity. This study also
aimed at achieving this objective.
In
future
work,
the
study
will
further
asses
the
environmental and economic benefits of EVs technology in
China to established evidence on the role of EV deployment
to environmental wellness in the case of China.
