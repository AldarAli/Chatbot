Abstract—A hemodynamically unstable patient has the risk of
going into general shock. As fluid therapy is the primary
treatment for shock, the fluid responsiveness (FR) of the
patient
should
be
evaluated
before
volume
expansion.
However, conventional methods predict FR by analyzing the
variation of blood pressure signal in time domain which is a
nonstationary problem and makes it difficult to provide a
stable index for FR. Instantaneous pulse rate variability
(iPRV) is a cardiovascular assessment in frequency domain.
Furthermore,
iPRV
uses
ensemble
empirical
mode
decomposition (EEMD), which could solve the nonstationary
problem and overcome the frequency limitation in power
spectrum of heart rate variability (HRV). iPRV provides a new
indication in very high frequency (VHF) range (0.4-0.8Hz) of
spectrum for peripheral responses. The aim of this study was
to verify the ability of iPRV to indicate VHF for cardiac output
assessment. Twenty-six healthy participants participated in
this study and the acquired signal was recorded in supine
baseline, during head-up tilt (HUT), and passive leg raising
(PLR), which induces variation of venous return and helps the
quantitative assessment of cardiac output individually. The
result showed that the normalized power of VHF in HRV was
small and there was no corresponding variation in different
postures. In contrast, the normalized power of VHF in iPRV
presented relative trend with different venous return changes.
Overall, iPRV provides a novel and short-term cardiac output
assessment in frequency domain and it has potential to
evaluate FR.

INTRODUCTION
To
study
blood
flow
and
circulation
in
humans,
hemodynamics
is
an
important
part
of
Physiology.
Hemodynamic monitoring plays a key role in hospitals for
hemodynamically unstable patients. When they recover after
surgery or after a suffered injury, they usually need intensive
care and continuous observation of hemodynamic parameters
is
needed.
Furthermore,
a
patient
with
unstable
hemodynamics is at risk of general shock.
Fluid therapy is the primary treatment for shock.
Moreover, the stroke volume of a patient increases by 12%
after fluid loading which means a patient responds to fluid
administration. However, only half the patients respond to
fluid loading in intensive care unit (ICU). Volume expansion
for non-responder patients may only exert adverse effects
without having any hemodynamic benefit [1][2]. Thus, the
fluid responsiveness (FR) of a patient should be evaluated
before
volume
expansion.
After
fluid
loading,
the
expectation
is
that
it
will
increase
cardiac
output
significantly. Nevertheless, stroke volume is intrinsically
controlled by cardiac preload, so conventional methods
evaluate FR by assessing cardiac preload or output. Several
ways to evaluate FR are based on static indices and dynamic
indices [3][4]. Previous studies demonstrated that static
index of cardiac preload can predict FR by pressure and
volume markers, but it is affected by respiratory or systolic
function [5]. For this reason, dynamic indices have been
developed to assess cardiac output by calculating the short-
time variation of arterial pulse pressure waveform in
mechanical ventilation patient. But dynamic indices are also
affected by spontaneous respiration [6], and both indices are
based on time domain which present the nonstationary

problem in signal and make it difficult to provide a stable
index for FR.
In frequency domain, one of the important cardiovascular
assessment is heart rate variability (HRV). However, HRV
studies are restricted by the feasibility and the reproducibility
with an inconvenient measurement [7]. In addition, the
maximum frequency of power spectrum is restricted at 0.5
Hz by tachogram [8]. Pulse rate variability (PRV) was
proposed as a substitute measurement of HRV. PRV uses
pulse wave, which collected from photoplethysmography
(PPG), to replace ECG recording in HRV and has been
examined as a surrogate of HRV during nonstationary
conditions in a previous study [9]. Besides, the arterial pulse
wave is regulated by complex physiological controls which
make PRV provide much more peripheral information than
HRV [9]. However, the frequency band indication in power
spectrum of PRV is still a limitation that needs to be
overcome. Instantaneous pulse rate variability (iPRV) is a
novel method to extend frequency limitation [10]. It adopted
the frequency range extension method and IF projecting
technique help for PRV spectral analysis. Furthermore, iPRV
used ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD),
which could solve the nonstationary problem. Also, iPRV
provides a new indication, named very high frequency
(VHF) band (0.4-0.8 Hz), in the power spectrum for more
information. The literature has proposed that VHF of HRV is
a novel index of left ventricular function evaluation [11].
VHF has the ability to indicate cardiac function, venous
return, and FR. However, the variation and interpretation of
VHF in iPRV have to be further explored and examined. The
aim of this study was to verify the ability of iPRV to indicate
VHF for cardiac output assessment. It thought of an
experiment of change in venous return such as passive leg
raising (PLR) and head-up tilt (HUT). PLR as a volume
challenge induces a translocation of venous blood, and HUT
induces blood pooling in the legs which can decrease venous
return and cardiac output. These two positions can offer
variation
of
venous
return
to
verify
cardiac
output
assessment as iPRV. The remainder of the paper is structured
as follows. The next section presents the experiment design,
data
collection,
introduction
of
iPRV
analysis
and
comparison methods. Section III illustrates the similarity
between iPRV and RRI and also explains the results of
power spectrum in iPRV and HRV during different postures.
Section IV provides the discussion about mechanism of
different frequency band indication in iPRV. Moreover, it
presents iPRV is a potential short-term FR evaluation.
Conclusion and future work are given in the last section.

MATERIAL AND METHOD
A. Experiment design and subjects
The procedure of this study contained five steps. First,
participants were resting in supine position with 10-minute
recording as a baseline. Second, participants were tilting up
passively (HUT) on the automatic tilting table and kept in
tilt-up position for 10 minutes. Then, participants were back
to the supine position with 5 minutes for recovering to
baseline. Finally, participants were raising leg passively
(PLR) for 10 minutes. After PLR, participants were resting
with 5 minutes for recovering to steady state.
The signal acquisition was as follows: (i) electrical
activity of ECG signal was recorded by BEST-C-04056
(BioSenseTek Corp., Taiwan); (ii) peripheral information of
PPG signal was recorded by Nonin 8500 (Nonin Medical
Inc., Plymouth, MN). The signal acquisition with sampling
frequency is 200Hz.
Thirty healthy participants (male: 15; age: 24±1.8 years
old) participated in this study. Twenty-six participants had
no history of cardiovascular disease and no uncontrollable
distortion in acquired data. Four exclusive participants
contained distortion in certain data, such as motion artifacts
from PPG signal and ECG abnormality. All measurements
were performed in a quiet temperature-controlled room and
the experiment was approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) of Tungs’ Taichung Metro Harbor Hospital.
B. Instantaneous pulse rate variability
The process of iPRV includes two parts (Figure 1). The
first part is decomposition, the pulse wave component was
searched from PPG by sifting process in EEMD. Sifting
process is an iteratively detrending operation which is used
to compute finite set of components, named intrinsic mode
functions (IMFs), from source nonstationary data. Moreover,
before the sifting process, EEMD provides noise-assisted
method
into
original
data
for
eliminating
multiple
characteristic problem in IMFs. After mixtures of added
noise and source data, the detrending operation contains
several steps. First, local extrema of dataݔ(ݐ) are identified
by peak-valley detection. The upper envelope ܷ(ݐ) and
lower
envelopeܮ(ݐ) are
generated
by
cubic
spline
interpolation according to the local maxima and local
minima. The trend in current timescale is computed by
calculating the mean of ܷ(ݐ) andܮ(ݐ), asܯ(ݐ).

The second part is feature extraction. The continuous-
time heartbeat rhythm can be extracted by EEMD. To resent
the frequency of oscillation in IMF at a specific time instant,
iPRV proposed normalized direct quadrature (NDQ) to
calculate IF of relative IMF. The algorithm of NDQ is shown
in Figure 2. First, the amplitude modulation of the main
componentܫܯܨ௠௔௜௡
was
eliminated
by
iteratively
normalization for conquering Bedrosian’s theorem [12].
Then, the empirical frequency modulation signalܨ(ݐ) of
ܫܯܨ௠௔௜௡ is assumed to be cosine function, and its quadrature
ݏ݅݊∅(ݐ) can be computed directly.
ݏ݅݊∅(ݐ)= ඥ1 −ܨଶ(ݐ)(4)
The instantaneous phase ∅(ݐ) is calculated by taking
arctangent ofܨ(ݐ) and its quadrature, then the IF is obtained
from divided derivative of ∅(ݐ) by 2π.

The instantaneous period (iPeriod) was estimated by the
inversion of IF ofܫܯܨ௠௔௜௡ in order to indicate time series of
heartbeat rhythm as RR intervals (RRI) in HRV.

C. Comparison method
iPeriod was calculated by feature extraction, and the
analysis of iPeriod included frequency domain analysis and
time domain analysis. Frequency domain analysis adopted
power spectrum to compare power variation in different
frequency band with RRI. The procedure of frequency
domain analysis includes two steps. Firstly, fast Fourier
transform (FFT) was performed as the spectrum analysis in
each frequency band of iPeriod and RRI. The partition of
power spectrum in HRV and iPRV is shown in Figure 3. The
frequency band of HRV is divided into low frequency (LF)
band (0.04-0.15 Hz), high frequency (HF) band (0.15-0.4
Hz) and very high frequency (VHF) band (0.4-0.5 Hz).
Frequency band of iPRV is divided into LF (0.04-0.15 Hz)
and HF (0.15-0.4 Hz), and VHF (0.4-0.8 Hz). Then, the
power of each frequency band is calculated by integration for
comparison of variation during different positions.
The purpose of time domain analysis is to examine the
reliability of iPeriod. Before time domain analysis, there is a
preprocessing for filtering high frequency band of iPeriod by
EEMD in order to be compared with RRI. The procedure of
preprocessing is shown in Figure 4. At first, iPeriod was
filtered by EEMD into IMFs with high frequency and
residue. Then, residue was extracted as low pass of iPeriod
(iPeriodLP,
݂(ݐ)).Time domain analysis adopted cross
correlation coefficient to ensure similarity between iPRV and
HRV. Cross correlation coefficient also offered time lag
information to discuss changes in different position. RRI
series ݃(ݐ) is an interpolation of RRI by using cubic spline.
The calculation of cross correlation coefficient shows in (6).

D. Normalized power in frequency band
For summarizing spectral analysis with whole database
during
different
condition,
this
study
adopted
two
normalized power calculations as follows: (i) for comparing
with HRV, the following normalization formula was used:
ܲ݋ݓ݁ݎ௧௢௧௔௟ (TP) = ܲ݋ݓ݁ݎ௅ி + ܲ݋ݓ݁ݎுி

୘୔
= nLF + nHF = 1
(7)
Where nLF is normalized power of LF and nHF is
normalized power of HF; (ii) for exploring power of VHF
information, the following normalization formula was used:
ܲ݋ݓ݁ݎ௧௢௧௔௟ (TP) = ܲ݋ݓ݁ݎ௅ி + ܲ݋ݓ݁ݎுி + ܲ݋ݓ݁ݎ௏ுி

TP = ܲ݋ݓ݁ݎ௅ி
TP

= nLF + nHF + nVHF = 1
(8)
Where nLF is normalized power of LF, nHF is normalized
power of HF and nVHF is normalized power of VHF.

RESULT
A. Comparison result in frequency domain
Table I shows the comparison result with HRV. The
normalized power of HRV and iPRV had the same trend
between
supine

other
postures.
The
sympathetic
activities increased (nLF increasing) when the venous return
decreased (HUT). The parasympathetic activities increased
(nHF increasing) when the venous return increased (PLR).
Different venous return activated the autonomic nervous
system (ANS), normalized power of iPRV responded
relatively as HRV.

(0.667±0.109

significant difference with value of iPeriod and RRI series
(p<0.01 at all postures). Time lag at all postures was not
significant difference (p = 0.14 in baseline; p = 0.23 in HUT;

influenced by high frequency band.

DISCUSSION
nVHF in iPRV showed the ability of evaluating cardiac
output from PPG signal. This study adopted NDQ, which
eliminated amplitude modulation, as an IF estimation to
calculate periodic changes of pulse waveform for presenting
cardiac output information. However, NDQ as a suitable IF
estimation for pulse waveform has to be further explored.
Previous studies proposed that component for NDQ needs to
be a single-term expansion which absorb some of the
properties [13]. The composition of PPG signal includes
pulse
waveform
and
reflected
waveform,
and
pulse
waveform is a sinusoid-like function which satisfy condition
of single-term expansion. Furthermore, the pulse waveform
extracted by EEMD with frequency band around 1 Hz.

Overall, pulse waveform is suitable component to NDQ for
calculating IF.
After obtained iPeriod by using NDQ, FFT transformed
iPeriod into power spectrum for comparing with HRV in
frequency domain. Nevertheless, the normalized power of
iPRV showed different trend with HRV in HF. Previous
study claimed that fluctuations in the PPG signal in a normal
person,
which
synchronous
with
ventilation,
with
a
frequency in the 0.2-0.45 Hz [14]. Therefore, HF in iPRV is
a
complex
frequency
band
with
respiration
and
parasympathetic activities. In addition, VHF contains much
more information than HRV, and it also affects the nHF in
iPRV to present parasympathetic activities. To find out more
detail, VHF was separated into near high frequency (NHF)
band (0.4-0.5 Hz) and far high frequency (FHF) band (0.5-
0.8 Hz). Table IV revealed that iPRV and HRV had the same
trend in each frequency band when calculation in normalized
power without FHF. However, there is different result if we
calculate normalized power with FHF. The nHF expressed
different trend with HRV, as seen in the result in Table II. As
a result, cardiac output information could be narrowed down
into FHF. Moreover, the power of FHF had higher
proportion in total power which affected normalized power
calculation.
This study showed that the iPRV spectrum can be
assessed by simple PPG measurement. Moreover, it has
potential to be a short-term evaluation. Conventionally, HRV
needs long-term (greater than 5 min) data to evaluate
autonomic nervous

Furthermore, conventional evaluations also adopt 5 min data
to assess cardiac output. Then, iPRV has the potential to be
a short term evaluation by using IF estimation method. On
the other hand, iPeriod has the ability to indicate enough
information with short data length in PPG signal. This study
used fragment data of PPG signal in supine and PLR. Table
V showed that PPG signal with 130 seconds was no
significant difference (p = 0.28 in supine; p = 0.19 in PLR)
with whole data length, and it also had relative trend between
supine and PLR. This result demonstrated that iPRV has
potential as a short-term cardiac output evaluation.

CONCLUSION
nVHF in iPRV had relative variation to venous return
change in different postures, and it showed that iPRV is a
potential
evaluation
for
assessing
cardiac
output.
Furthermore, result in time domain comparison illustrated
that iPeriod contained high frequency information, and
iPeriodLP had positive correlation with RRI series. In
conclusion, iPRV is not only able to present ANS activity
but also reliable to evaluate cardiac output. iPRV has
potential to predict FR as short-term assessment and to be a
reliable system for ICU in order to avoid delaying definitive
therapy or produce additional damage patients. In the future,
iPRV in FR assessment has to be further explored and
examined with clinical patient.
