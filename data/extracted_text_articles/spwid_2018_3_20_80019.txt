Abstract—Stress leaves a harmful impact on the health of people
and puts their health at serious risk. To assess stress, this study
presents an approach to measure the stress levels of graduate and
undergraduate students by analyzing the activity behavior of their
daily routine. Our approach monitors the activity behavior non-
invasively using the smartphone sensors. The activity behavior
is classiﬁed into three classes with an accuracy of 98.0% using
a support vector machine. We build linear relationship between
those recognized classes of activity (explanatory variables) and
stress level experienced by the students. This approach is based
on multiple linear regression that computes a stress score, and
categorizes stress in three levels: low, mild, and acute. Such results
illustrate that the graduate students experience high stress as
compared to the undergraduate students.

INTRODUCTION
A natural defense of the human body, also known as
stress, protects individual against any danger. Stress for a short
time can be helpful, but long-term stress can negatively affect
health. People suffer from stress when they are overloaded and
feeling an inability to cope with the demands. Stress is a state
in which individuals are expected to perform too much under
sheer pressure and in which they can only marginally meet
the demands. These demands can be related to psychology,
ﬁnance, work, and relationships that pose a real challenge or
threat to health, and well-being of individuals. If stress is
not timely cured and the person is going through constant
stress, it can affect human body with headache, depression
[1], heart attack [2]-[4], stomachache, high blood pressure,
insomnia, and weakened immune system. Clinically, subjective
methods such as questionnaires and interviews are conducted
to evaluate stress, whereas for objective assessment of stress,
many researchers presented their works to detect stress [5]-
[11]. However, they tried to measure stress using like inva-
sive sensors EEG [5][9][10], ECG [11], and Galvanic Skin
Response (GSR) [6]. EEG or ECG sensors provide state-
of-the-art accuracy for stress detection. However, the usage
of EEG or ECG to analyze stress is impractical in real-life
settings, because people do not feel comfortable to go outside
in public places wearing EEG or ECG in their daily-life.
People suffering from stress may not choose to openly wear
the device because stressed persons are already shy to express
themselves and therefore, such wearables may not be socially
acceptable to them. Moreover, the efﬁciency of these devices
degrades as users perform any motion-related task. To the best
of our knowledge, no one has designed a system for non-
invasive detection of stress yet. Therefore, we are motivated
to design non-invasive stress detection system.

In this paper, we present a novel system to measure the
stress of the university students by analyzing their activity be-
havior in daily routine. We choose undergraduate and graduate
students to evaluate their stress level, because they are more
vulnerable to stress due to a variety of challenges such as poor
academic performance [12], ﬁnances [13], poor sleep [14], and
inability to cope with research demands of supervisor. Besides,
high rates of suicide in American and Asian countries are
associated with academic related stress [15]. It is imperative
to take preventive measures for protecting the students from
deleterious outcome associated with stress by monitoring their
daily activity behavior.
We have broadly categorized the daily-life routine of the
students into three clusters: stationary, moving, and sleeping.
We think that poor sleep and sedentary behavior (i.e., sta-
tionary) are two main indicators of stress, whereas movement
behavior of person signiﬁes less stressed or happy man. Our
system consists of motion and audio sensors that records
input data with the assistance of an application (App) running
on a smartphone. We exploit the motion sensors namely
accelerometer and gyroscope-sensors and a microphone sensor
of the smartphone as the primary sources of data input to
our system. The motion sensors record the activity behavior
and the audio sensor records voice signal of the participants

at the rate of 10 samples/second and 44100 samples/second,
respectively, as shown in Figure 1. The activity recognition
algorithm is applied to the acquired signals, and recognized
activity behavior is transmitted to the cloud server for data
analysis to detect stress.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we
describe the experimental setup to collect raw data using the
smartphone sensors and the proposed approach. In section III,
we discuss and evaluate the system performance for stress
detection based on the daily activity behavior.
II.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our approach employs tri-axial accelerometer, tri-axial
gyroscope, and microphone of a smartphone. An accelerometer
and gyroscope are dedicated to measuring acceleration and
angular velocity of the subjects during stationary, moving, and
sleeping states, whereas the microphone records surrounding
noise level when subjects are in stationary and sleeping states.
Figure 2 depicts the three of the activities performed by the
subject while the smartphone is in the proximity to him.
Smartphone app developed by MATLAB is responsible for
collecting the experimental data and transmitting the data to
the cloud server for further analysis.
A. Experiment Design
We recruited 32 students (16 graduate and 16 under-
graduate) of Sungkyunkwan University, average age of 29.7
years with standard deviation of 10.6 years, to analyze our
envisioned system. Subjects signed consent form prior to the
experiment and whose rights have been protected following
declaration of Helsinki. Selected Subjects had no head injury
and were not using any medication. We employed same man-
ufacturer and same model smartphone, iPhone 6, for recording
the daily activity experimental data, because the majority of
participants in the trial had an iPhone 6, and since the idea
was to let the participants use the same type of smartphone
so as to avoid the normalization problem of the activity data.
Each participant recorded their 24 hour activity of daily routine
which constituted experimental data of 768 hours. If a person
is sleeping, the amplitude generated by a microphone is either
near to zero or very small due to snoring, whereas when subject
wakes up, he/she has to say “good morning” or “hello”, and
as to signal the microphone that the subject has woken up,
and similarly, subject has to utter “good night” to indicate
beginning of sleep. The words spoken at the time of before
and after the sleep helps in determining sleep duration of the
subject automatically. All participants also participated in a
stress-related survey. The data of 25 hours were discarded
because some participants could not carry mobile in some
unavoidable situations. The students were grouped into two
clusters based on educational degree they are currently pursu-
ing in the university: graduate and undergraduate. The daily
routine information of both groups forms experimental data
for activity recognition. Acquired signals of the sensors are
segmented into non-overlapping segments of 20 seconds. The
segment length of 20 seconds was selected based on the best
performance of activity recognition classiﬁer after exploring
a range of 3 to 30 seconds. The activity information was
annotated into three classes: stationary, moving, and sleeping.
B. Proposed Approach
Our system for stress detection has three stages. Subjective
assessment is performed about stress through a survey in
stage one. In stage two, subject’s activity of the whole day is
recognized, and stress level is detected based on the recognized
activity information in stage three. The activity information
is comprised of three broad classes: stationary, moving, and
sleeping. Our system tries to recognize these activities using
an activity recognition classiﬁer. We think that these three
classes of activities are essential to determine stress of the
university student. We have exploited participants’ interaction
with a smartphone to indirectly determine their stress level. If
participant is stressed, he/she suffers from insomnia and often
remains in stationary activity. Therefore, we exploited subjec-
tive assessment and daily activity information of participants
to calculate their stress levels. The proposed approach tries
to exploit relation of sleep, stationary, and moving activities
with stress using linear regression. We think that the pressure
of supervisor and fear of failure causes the student to sleep
less and study for long hours, whereas a person who sleeps
less and stays stationary longer than usual becomes victim of
stress. Therefore, it is very important to address the problem
of stress faced by the university students using a novel non-
invasive approach.
C. Activity Recognition
The distinct patterns as shown in (Figures 3(a) to 3(f)) were
generated by the motion sensors of smartphone according to
the activity subjects performed in their daily schedule. Three
segments of 40 seconds in Figure 3 demonstrate a difference
in acceleration and angular velocity of each activity. The
patterns of moving activity are clearly distinguishable from
the rest of the two activities. To some extent, patterns of
sleeping and stationary activity are obscure due to being same
in nature. For solving this problem, the microphone is used
to differentiate sleeping from stationary activity as shown in
Figure 4. We have modiﬁed the signal of audio input in order
to keep the privacy of subjects. Amplitude signal of audio input
during sleep stays approximate to zero, whereas the amplitude
during stationary (awake) state is higher as shown at extreme
ends of audio signal in Figure 4. Since, features play an
essential role in the recognition of activities, so features must
characterize the patterns effectively without carrying irrelevant
and redundant information so that activity recognition classiﬁer
perform efﬁciently. The amplitude based features are extracted
from segments of experimental data for training the activity
model. Those features are arithmetic mean, standard deviation,
interquartile range, kurtosis, geometric mean, median, maxi-
mum, range, skewness, energy of a signal, waveform length,
entropy, RMS and ratio of RMS to maximum.
Forward Features Selection (FFS) procedure is employed
on the computed features to reduce redundancy and avoid
overﬁtting. The top 6 features are selected using FFS and
those selected features are fed into Support Vector Machine
(SVM) to develop the activity recognition model. The activity
recognition model is trained and evaluated using a 32 fold
cross-validation technique with leave-one-out. This technique
allowed the training of the quadratic SVM on the features
from 31 out of 32 subjects and validated the model with
the remaining subject. The activity recognition algorithm has
classiﬁed the acquired signals of the sensors with an accuracy

of 98.0% into three activity classes of stationary, moving, and
sleeping as shown in Figure 5. The moving class is comprised
of walking, running, and any other exercise involving the body
motion. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm. We
implemented SVM for activity recognition using classiﬁcation
learner tool in MATLAB 2016b. One-vs-all strategy and linear
kernel function k( ⃗Xt, ⃗Xi) = ⃗Xt, ⃗Xi is used whose penalty C
parameter is 1 by default.
D. Stress Detection
The activity information recognized by SVM is transmitted
to the cloud server for data analytics to detect stress (S) in
the students. We tried to search relationship between stress
and three activity classes: moving, stationary, sleeping. We
exploited different linear regression models to build a robust
model to estimate stress. Stationary and sleeping activities data
are included to develop the stress estimation model because
those two variables showed a signiﬁcant relationship with
stress, whereas moving activity data was discarded after it
showed no any signiﬁcant improvement in the model. We have
computed stress score using (1). We think that sleep duration
and stationary activity are essential explanatory variables to

We employed curve-ﬁtting tool of MATLAB 2016b to

the parametric values of the proposed approach are calculated
as 0.176, -0.386, and 3.01 for a, b, and θ, respectively. The
pvalues of stationary and sleeping variables are lower than
0.05 which proved the statistical signiﬁcance of the earlier
mentioned variables in estimating the stress score. The adjusted
R-Squared value is 0.909 which means 90.9% variance in
stress is successfully explained by the proposed model based

on two explanatory variables (i.e., stationary and sleeping).
Stationary has the effect of a on the stress score, whereas
sleeping affects the stress score by factor of b. All the pa-
rameters have a partial effect on stress. The parametric values
of (1) shown in Table I suggest that sleeping has a higher
effect on stress score than stationary, because parameter b is
higher in weight than parameter a. If both the variables are
0 in values, then parameter θ affects estimated stress highly.
Stress reduces when sleep time increases and vice versa. On
the contrary, stationary activity is directly proportional to the
stress.

Three levels of stress are calculated based on lower and
upper thresholds. Those three levels of stress are low, mild,
and acute. If S < δ1, the subject is less stressed or normal,
he has a mild stress if δ1 ≤ S ≤ δ2, and he has an acute
stress if S > δ2. The δ1 and δ2 represents lower and upper
thresholds. Stress level scores for all the students is computed.
The result of stress computation shown in Figures (5(a) to
5(b)) has demonstrated that 2 graduate student have acute or
high stress and 2 others out of 16 graduate students have mild
stress, whereas only 3 out of 16 undergraduate students have
mild stress. This statistics of stress experienced by students has
validated our claim that graduate students have higher average
stress as compared to the undergraduate students due to poor
sleep and higher sedentary or stationary behavior.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The focus of our research was to present an approach to
detect stress levels experienced by the students. Our approach
uses non-invasive strategy to monitor the three levels of stress
in the subjects using a commonly available electronic device
(smartphone). We employed the motion sensors and audio
sensor of the smartphone to record the overall activity of
the individuals. Prior studies have considered stress detec-
tion with EEG, ECG and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)
[3][6][9][10][11] which provide a direct method to measure
stress and are preferred choice of users in indoor settings, but
these devices are socially unacceptable to people going out
in public places (i.e., school, ofﬁce, shopping market, etc.,)
while wearing these measurement devices. Our non-invasive
method based on the smartphone is user friendly and socially
acceptable to users, because the smartphone sensors do not
interfere with their daily work and they can use the smartphone
to measure their stress levels in public places without letting
anybody know.
We have analyzed our approach using two groups of the
students. The smartphone recorded the activity of students
when they performed routine tasks without interfering in their
daily-life tasks. An experiment was performed in order to
obtain activity data on the basis of which, stress scores or levels

can be detected. The activity recognition classiﬁer grouped
the daily-routine behavior of the subjects into three classes:
moving, stationary, and sleeping. We experimentally evaluated
three of the activity classes to build statistical models for
stress computation, but the model is built on only stationary
and sleeping classes. Moving activity did not contribute any
signiﬁcant information about stress in the model, therefore, it
is discarded. Stationary and sleeping are two broad classes
of activity which are essential to assess someone’s stress
level. The estimation of stress levels by proposed approach
is demonstrated in Figures (6(a) to 6(b)). The curve ﬁt of
the stress estimation model is shown in Figure 6(c) which
depicts the inverse relationship of sleeping with stress and
direct effect of stationary on the stress. The conclusion drawn
from proposed model also agrees with the previous studies
that stress causes poor sleep [16][17] and high stationary or
sedentary behavior [17] is related to stress.
We experimentally found that graduate students suffer
higher stress than the undergraduate students studying in the
university. Our proposed strategy determined the stress of the
students and 2 out of 16 graduate students is suffering from
acute or high stress, 2 out of 16 graduate students have mild
stress, whereas only 3 out of 16 undergraduate students have
mild stress. It is not possible that people carry the smartphone
all the time, so it is a limitation of our approach. We will
try to integrate motion and biological sensors in arm band
or embed to T-shirt for monitoring the activity of individuals
and notifying them about their stress levels in real-time as our
future work.
We have presented a novel approach based on smart-
phone sensors to measure the stress level of graduate and
undergraduate students studying in the university. Our system
has determined three stress levels by analyzing the activity
behavior and experimentally found that graduate students are
