Abstract—This work extends for translucent optical networks 
the solution to the problem of finding the best choice among M 
combinations of the shortest paths. The proposed Best Shortest 
Translucent Lightpath (BSTL) is a novel optical routing 
strategy, adaptive and aware of the optical physical layer 
impairments. The performance of BSTL is evaluated at 
different 
scenarios 
(topologies, 
regenerator 
placements, 
impairment thresholds, etc.) using metrics like network 
utilization, blocking probability, and fairness. In all these 
scenarios, BSTL achieved a better performance that related 
algorithms, such as PIARA.

Layer Impairment-aware Routing; Performance Evaluation. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Optical networks are currently based on the Wavelength 
Division Multiplexing (WDM) [1] technology. WDM allows 
the establishment of various optical circuits (lightpaths) 
simultaneously in a single optical fiber using different 
wavelengths. 
The architecture of an optical network can be classified 
as opaque, transparent or translucent [1]. In opaque optical 
networks, all nodes are opaque, i.e., each node requires 
Optic-Electrical-Optical (OEO) conversions of optical 
signals from input ports to electrical signals before 
processing and forwarding to output ports where electrical 
signals are reconverted to optical signals in order to be 
transmitted. Opaque nodes allow the regeneration of optical 
signals but the use of OEO converters insert unnecessary 
delays and are quite expensive. On the contrary, in 
transparent optical networks there are no OEO conversions 
at intermediate nodes of a route. In this case, optical signals 
are processed exclusively in the optical domain through all-
optical switches. Therefore, transparent optical networks 
eliminate signal conversion delays at intermediate nodes of a 
route. In translucent optical networks, which use a hybrid 
approach, there are some nodes with OEO conversion 
capability and all others are transparent. This allows the 
regeneration of the optical signal along specific routes.  
In practice, an optical signal is impaired when 
propagating through optical fiber links, optical cross-
connects, optical amplifiers and other optical network 
elements. The accumulation of these impairments along a 
route, tends to increase the Bit Error Rate (BER) at the 
receiver, reaching prohibitive levels [2,3]. Currently, optical 
technologies impose the need of OEO conversions in long 
distance routes in order to mitigate impairments at some 
intermediate nodes [2]. Therefore, a new optical network 
architecture that uses OEO conversions at some intermediate 
nodes and all-optical switching in all other nodes has to be 
considered. Gathering features like fast switching from 
transparent optical networking and signal regeneration from 
opaque optical networking, translucent optical networking 
became a reality [2,3]. In this work, translucent optical 
networks, where opaque nodes are sparsely distributed in the 
network topology, is considered. Also, it is assumed the 
circuit-switched optical networking paradigm which means 
that an optical circuit (transparent or translucent lightpath) is 
dynamically 
established 
using 
network 
resources 
(wavelengths) along a route (links and nodes) between a pair 
of source and destination nodes.  
The lightpath routing problem in circuit-switched optical 
networks is also known as Routing and Wavelength 
Assignment (RWA) [4]. RWA routing algorithms can be 
separated in three classes: fixed routing, alternate routing, 
and exhaustive routing [4].  
In the fixed routing strategy, each pair of nodes (source, 
destination) has only one route that is previously computed. 
Therefore, even before a lightpath request arrival, the routing 
control plane already knows which route must be used for a 
specific source-destination pair. Normally, fixed routes are 
previously computed using a classical shortest path 
algorithm, like Dijkstra's algorithm [5] or other routing 
algorithms specially proposed for optical networks [6, 7, 8].  
In the alternate routing strategy, a set with more than one 
route is previously defined for each source-destination pair. 
Alternate routing can be classified as fixed-alternate or 
adaptive alternate routing. Their differences lie in the way of 
selecting one route from the pre-computed set of routes. In 
fixed-alternate routing [4,8], the sequence of routes is

previously defined. Routes are tried one by one in a 
predetermined order to establish a lightpath for a specific 
request. In case of failure, the lightpath request is said to be 
blocked. In adaptive alternate routing or adaptive routing for 
short [4], route selection from the pre-computed set of routes 
is based on the network current state. For example, one may 
select the least loaded route. 
The exhaustive routing class algorithms have the 
advantage of being able to select any possible route in the 
topology for establishing a lightpath [4]. Therefore, in this 
case, a lightpath request will be blocked only if there are no 
routes between source and destination with at least one 
available 
continuous 
wavelength. 
However, 
the 
implementation of exhaustive routing algorithms is more 
complex than the implementations of the other routing 
classes.  
This work presents a new adaptive routing algorithm for 
translucent 
optical 
networks, 
named 
Best 
Shortest 
Translucent Lightpath (BSTL). BSTL is inspired on the Best 
among Shortest Routes (BSR) proposal which optimizes the 
fixed routing problem in transparent optical networks [6]. 
But, differently from BSR, BSTL is adaptive and aware of 
optical physical layer impairments. 
The optical physical layer impairment-aware dynamic 
routing problem in translucent optical networks is considered 
more difficult than the corresponding problem for 
transparent optical networks [9]. Optical physical layer 
impairments can be classified in two categories: linear and 
nonlinear. Linear impairments are independent of the optical 
signal power and affect each of the wavelengths individually, 
while the nonlinear impairments scale with optical power, 
affecting all wavelengths. The main linear impairments such 
as fiber attenuation, insertion loss, amplifier spontaneous 
emission, dispersion and crosstalk, are already well 
characterized [10]. On the other side, nonlinear impairments 
are more complex and difficult to characterize, needing a 
detailed knowledge of the optical network infrastructure. 
However, it is possible to adopt a simplified model where 
nonlinear effects are mitigated by minimizing the number of 
links along the lightpath [11]. 
Most optical signal impairments occur in function of the 
distance and/or the number of intermediate switches 
involved in the path from the source to the destination node. 
In this work, it is considered a hop number limit for a route 
without optical signal regeneration. Therefore, a lightpath 
must have optical signal regeneration (translucent lightpath) 
when it reaches a specific hop number, known as Impairment 
Threshold (IT) [8]. Several works in the literature adopt the 
hop number limitation as the main optical signal quality 
measure for performance evaluation of translucent optical 
networks [2,3,8,10,12]. 
In order to illustrate the Impairment Threshold concept in 
translucent optical networks, consider the topology example 
shown in Figure 1 with IT=2, which means that a route in 
this network will be considered feasible only if after 2 hops 
there is a node to regenerate the optical signal quality 
(regenerator node). For instance, consider the two routes 
(Figure 1) between a generic source-destination pair: route A 
and route B. Observe that while route A shows to be 
unfeasible because it has four hops without regeneration, on 
the other hand, route B appears to be feasible because after 2 
hops the optical signals are regenerated (in R), reaching 
destination with two more hops.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 
II, previous related works are discussed. Section III 
introduces the shortest path selection problem for translucent 
optical networks. Section IV presents the new routing 
heuristic proposed, which performance is evaluated in 
Section V. Final remarks are made in Section VI.  
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
The optical signal impairment-aware routing and the 
wavelength assignment problems have been recently studied 
by many researchers [2,8,10,11,12].  
In [10], one can find a survey about optical-physical-
layer-aware RWA algorithms where different strategies are 
classified as single path or multi-path. Multi-path or multiple 
routes strategies search any feasible route out of n routes to 
satisfy a lightpath request. All those strategies use the 
shortest path algorithm for route calculation. 
Rai et al. [12] proposed an information search-based 
algorithm for translucent optical networks that chooses 
feasible routes with minimal hops. 
The Polynomial time Impairment Aware Routing 
Algorithm (PIARA) for translucent optical networks with 
sparse placement of regenerators is proposed in [8]. PIARA 
computes link costs based on optical physical impairments, 
and searches for feasible shortest routes passing, if 
necessary, through regenerator nodes. Feasible routes are 
obtained by means of a module based on a classical shortest 
path algorithm that does not use pre-computed routes. 
Therefore, PIARA can be considered as an exhaustive 
routing class algorithm. 
All routing strategies used in those previous related 
works are based on shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra`s 
algorithm [5]). Because they are based on or have a module 
implementing classical shortest path algorithms in their 
solutions, these routing strategies do not properly consider 
the case where there is more than one feasible shortest path 
to choose from.  
In this work, we try to put in evidence this unique-best-
shortest-path problem of the existing shortest path algorithms 
for translucent optical networks which are characterized by a 
reach limit for the optical signal propagation. Besides, we 
propose a new routing strategy for translucent optical 
networks, named BSTL, which main routing features are: 
adaptive, optical-physical-layer-impairment-aware, multiple-
best-shortest-path-aware, and resource utilization efficiency.

III. THE PROBLEM OF CHOOSING THE BEST AMONG M 
COMBINATIONS OF FEASIBLE SHORTEST PATHS IN 
TRANSLUCENT OPTICAL NETOWRKS 
Durães et al. [6], introduced the problem of choosing the 
best combination among M Combinations of Shortest Paths 
(MCSP) where multiple options of shortest paths for routing 
in 
transparent 
optical 
networks 
result 
in 
different 
performance issues. In this section, the MCSP problem is 
extended to the case of translucent optical networks. 
In translucent optical networks some paths are considered 
unfeasible routes due to optical physical layer impairments. 
Therefore, only shortest paths which are feasible routes will 
be taken into account hereafter. 
Considering an optical network topology with N nodes, 
the total number of source-destination pairs is 
(
N × N − )1
. 
We will use the notation pair(s,d) to represent an ordered 
pair of nodes, with its origin at node s and its destination at 
node d. For adaptive routing, it is necessary to set a dynamic 
route for each path request. If we assume that the pair(s,d) 
uses the same route as the pair(d,s) (bidirectional path), then 
it is sufficient to find forward routes only. Therefore, at least 
(
)

R
 routes have to be computed for a determined 
topology with N nodes, in order to satisfy any path request 
(s,d). 
Most of the related works (Section II) use classical 
shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's and Bellman–Ford's) 
to compute routes or to compose a routing solution, fixed, 
alternate or exhaustive. These classical algorithms, which 
usually are implemented as “modules” in others algorithms, 
aim at finding one shortest path for each pair(s,d). However, 
between any two nodes (source and destination) it may be 
found more than one shortest paths. To illustrate this, 
consider a simple example of a translucent optical network 
based on the topology shown in Figure 2, here named as 
Ring with 6 Nodes and one Transversal Link (R6NTL), 
where node 2 is a regenerator node. For instance, we observe 
that there are two shortest feasible paths between nodes 1 
and 4 in R6NTL, either with three hops: 1–2–3–4 and 1–2–
5–4. Therefore, without any other additional criterion, a 
classical shortest path algorithm applied to R6NTL may 
choose any of these three-hop paths for routing between 
nodes 1 and 4. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.  R6NTL Topology. 
Now, generalizing to any translucent optical network 
topology, as for each pair(s,d) there may be more than one 
shortest path feasible route (called in this work Feasible 
Candidate Routes – FCR), there are M different solutions for 
selecting the feasible routes in a given network topology. 
The number M of possible solutions is given by

where FCRpair(i,j) represents the number of shortest path 
feasible candidate routes for the pair(i, j), with i≠j. Note that 
all candidate feasible routes have the least number of hops. 
For the R6NTL topology, we have 
 
because this topology has nine pairs of source–destination 
nodes with only one feasible candidate route and six pairs 
with two shortest path feasible candidates. So, considering 
all shortest path feasible candidate routes for each pair(s,d) 
in the R6NTL topology, there are M = 64 different 
combinations of feasible shortest paths.

We can then define the problem of choosing the best 
combination among M Combinations of Feasible Shortest 
Paths (MCFSP) as how to identify a solution of feasible 
shortest paths routes Sk with 1 ≤ k ≤ M, such that Sk provides 
the best network blocking probability performance. This new 
definition generalizes for translucent optical networks the 
previous definition of the MCSP problem [6]. 
To illustrate the MCFSP problem we can consider, 
besides R6NTL, the Germany and the European Optical 
Network (EON) topologies shown in Figure 3, two 
interesting topologies for translucent optical network studies 
[8,12], all having regenerator nodes placed randomly in 
such a way that there are no two adjacent nodes with 
regeneration capability. Table 2 presents the number of 
routes R of a solution Sk, the sum of the number of feasible 
candidate routes (ΣFCR) for all pairs(s,d) and the number M 
of solutions of the MCFSP problem considering different 
scenarios in terms of topology, regenerator placement and 
optical reach (i.e., Impairment Threshold).

In Table 2, we observe that the value of M increases very 
fast with the number of node pairs (R) and the number of 
feasible 
candidate 
routes 
for 
a 
specific 
pair(s,d). 
Furthermore, we observe that the decrease of the optical 
reach (IT) reduces the number of feasible candidate routes 
too. However, even under low IT values (e.g., 2), the number 
of feasible shortest path combinations remains very high. 
This appears to be a good opportunity to apply new criteria 
to select feasible shortest paths in an adaptive routing 
scenario. 
Algorithms using modules based on classical shortest 
path algorithm can find any solution Sk from the M solution 
set of the MCFSP problem. This happens because they do 
not consider any additional criterion in order to identify the 
best among the M possible solution combinations.  
OEO NODE 
In order to show the variability of the network 
performance in terms of blocking probability when choosing 
from M combinations of shortest paths, we simulated all the 
M = 64 possible combinations of feasible shortest paths for 
R6NTL. In this case, it was found the best combination of 
feasible shortest path routes because of the simplicity of this 
topology, characterized by a few nodes and links. However, 
simulating all feasible shortest path combinations becomes 
impracticable with larger topologies (Figure 3 and Table 2). 
Figure 4 shows a graph with 64 blocking probability 
curves for a hypothetical translucent optical network with the 
topology R6NTL (IT=2) as shown in Figure 2. The 
characteristics of this simulation study (number of lightpath 
requests generated, traffic type, wavelength assignment 
algorithm, etc.) are the same described later in Section V.

Figure 4.  Blocking probability of all feasible shortest route combinations 
(M=64) of the R6NTL/IT=2 scenario. 
Each curve in Figure 4 represents the performance in 
terms of blocking probability of one routing solution among 
the M = 64 possible solutions of the MCFSP problem as a 
function of the traffic load. The routing solution found by the 
PIARA algorithm [8] (Table 1) is highlighted for comparison 
purposes. Notice that PIARA, even being an exhaustive 
routing algorithm, will always find the same routes, as long 
as the optical reach (i.e., IT) remains the same. On the other 
side, these results (Figure 4) clearly show the large 
variability of performance among the several possible 
routing solutions, justifying a judicious planning strategy for 
choosing the set of feasible shortest routes in a translucent 
optical network. 
Note that the number of combinations M in Table 2 is 
computed using Equation 1. A modified Dijkstra’s algorithm 
is used only to compute the shortest path feasible routes 
(FCR) for each pair. The performance evaluation using all 
feasible route combinations in a small network (R6NTL) 
intends to exemplify the diversity of solutions of the MCSP 
problem, not to solve it. Actually, in larger networks, the 
routing strategy must avoid the need of scanning all feasible 
route combinations.    
IV. PROPOSED HEURISTIC 
This section presents a new algorithm for translucent 
optical networks named Best Shortest Translucent Lightpath 
(BSTL), which is an optical physical layer impairment-aware 
and adaptive routing algorithm. BSTL uses the link 
utilization measure (number of used wavelengths) to find the 
best solution for the MCFSP problem. The goal of BSTL is 
to balance the load among all links while reducing the 
blocking probability of lightpath requests, without breaking 
the optical physical layer constraints. 
The execution of BSTL, as for any adaptive routing 
algorithm, is divided into two steps: alternate route 
computation and operation. The alternate route computation 
step occurs in the network planning phase. At the first step, 
all shortest routes for each pair(s,d) are previously computed 
by a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm and stored for later 
checking and selection. For instance, for the R6NTL, the pre-
computed BSTL routes are shown in Table 1. The second 
step of BSTL execution coincides with the operational phase 
where BSTL chooses, among the pre-computed set of 
feasible shortest paths, the feasible route with more 
availability of free continuous wavelengths to satisfy a 
specific source-destination lightpath request. This dynamic 
routing characteristic of BSTL is inspired in the Least 
Loaded Routing (LLR) algorithm [13]. LLR tries to satisfy a 
lightpath request using always the first of an ordered set of 
pre-computed alternative routes. Only if the first pre-
computed route has no available resources, LLR will 
sequentially search a route among the other pre-computed 
alternative routes. However, as opposed to LLR, BSTL has a 
compromise with load balancing (frequency of use of 
wavelengths) among all pre-computed alternative routes. 
A summary of the BSTL steps is as follows: 
 
1) [Planning Phase] – Compute all shortest routes for 
each pair(s,d) by a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm; 
2) [Operational Phase] – Returns the feasible route, 
among the pre-computed ones, which has more 
available free continuous wavelengths. 
 
The main idea of the BSTL is, at first, to compute off-
line all feasible routes for each pair(s,d), which is different 
from computing and simulating all M combinations of route 
solutions for a given topology and, secondly, to use the 
continuous wavelength availability criterion to dynamically 
select routes among the feasible routes pre-computed in a 
pair(s,d) basis. The load balancing strategy adopted by 
BSTL acts in order to prevent link bottlenecks which trends 
to compromise the network overall performance. 
V. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
The performance of BSTL was evaluated at different 
scenarios and compared to PIARA [8]. The different 
topologies 
and 
regenerator 
placements 
(randomly 
distributed, avoiding neighbor nodes) studied were those 
shown in Figures 2 and 3. The main metrics considered were 
network utilization and blocking probability. An additional 
metric corresponding to the fairness in satisfying the 
lightpath requests was also evaluated. The simulation tool 
TONetS [14] was extended to support the new characteristics 
of the translucent network routing algorithms here studied.  
This simulation study, as well as the simulation results 
previously presented (Section III), has the following basic 
characteristics, usually assumed in similar studies about 
circuit-switched optical networks. Traffic demand is 
characterized by optical circuit (i.e., lightpath) requests in a 
pair(s,d) basis, uniformly distributed among all 
(
N × N − )1
 
pairs. Requests are generated based on a Poisson process 
with average rate λ and the lightpaths’ hold times are 
exponentially distributed with mean 1/µ. The network’s 
traffic intensity in Erlangs is given by ρ=λ/µ. All network’s 
links are bidirectional, having 40 wavelengths for each 
direction. First-Fit [4], by simplicity and good performance 
reasons, is used as the wavelength assignment algorithm. For 
each simulation, five replications are performed and five 
millions requests are generated for each replication. All 
graphical results express confidence intervals evaluated at 
the 95% confidence level.

A preliminary comparison between BSTL and PIARA, 
considering the R6NTL topology (Figure 2), is presented in 
Figure 5. The average utilization per link using BSTL or 
PIARA (under 161 Erlangs) is shown in Figure 5a. With 
PIARA, links ‘‘a” and ‘‘b” appear to be overloaded with an 
average utilization of 77%, approximately, while links ‘‘d” 
and ‘‘e” may be considered underloaded with an average 
utilization equal to 26%, approximately. On the other side, 
with BSTL, the average utilization of every link remains 
between 38% and 56% (Figure 5a), showing its effectiveness 
in terms of load balancing among the network’s links. Figure 
5b shows the performance of BSTL and PIARA in terms of 
blocking probabilities. Observe that with BSTL, the route 
chosen for a specific lightpath request for the pair(s,d) 
cannot be the same route that satisfied the last request for the 
same pair. For instance, the BSTL solutions as shown in 
Figure 5b achieved a blocking probability performance of 
0.0005, approximately, at the last load point (161 Erlangs), 
while PIARA achieved 0.024 under the same load.

study, considering the R6NTL/IT=2 scenario, was 1.1 
millisecond, while BSTL took 0.04 millisecond for the same 
scenario. Notice that PIARA does not compute any route 
previously. On the contrary, PIARA computes routes 
dynamically under requests and considering the present state 
of the network.  Therefore, as PIARA can select among any 
possible route, it would be expected its superior performance 
when compared to an alternate algorithm like BSTL which 
select routes from a pre-computed list. However, PIARA has 
a more complex implementation than BSTL, justifying its 
inferior run time behavior. With PIARA, it is necessary to 
gather link state information from all network links to 
compute partial routes and to generate the auxiliary graph 
that will conduct the selection of the final route. The BSTL 
strategy has an implementation less complex in the 
operational phase, because only links that compose the set of 
feasible candidate routes (pre-computed) are analyzed in the 
route selection procedure. 
BSTL is also compared to PIARA considering the 
different topologies and OEO node placements shown in 
Figure 3.  Firstly, the comparison is carried out in terms of 
blocking probabilities and network utilizations (Subsection 
A). Afterwards, fairness for each pair(s,d) is evaluated 
(Subsection B).  
A. Blocking probabilities and network utilizations 
The performance evaluation results with BSTL and 
PIARA in terms of blocking probabilities and network 
utilizations (i.e., average of the utilization of each network 
link) are presented in Figures 6.a to 6.d, considering the 
topologies of Figures 3a to 3d, respectively. The results 
achieved show a superior performance of BSTL for all 
evaluated scenarios. The better performance of BSTL can be 
explained because the routes chosen for each pair(s,d) are 
one of a M shortest path combination, and additionally, they 
are chosen aiming at link load balancing. On the other side, 
PIARA does not employ any additional criterion to choose a 
route besides the shortest path one. 
From the network utilization point of view (Figure 6), 
BSTL's performance also appears to be superior because its 
lower blocking of lightpath requests; it also makes clear the 
advantages of its load balancing strategy. PIARA, which 
does not have a load balancing issue, becomes vulnerable to 
some “bottleneck links”, resulting in higher blocking 
probabilities and lower network utilizations than with BSTL.

B. Fairness 
The metric of (average) blocking probability shows a 
general view of the success probability of satisfying a 
lightpath request in a specific topology scenario. Despite its 
usefulness, an average blocking probability metric tends to 
conceal 
the 
variability 
of 
blocking 
probabilities 
experimented by each pair(s,d). In order to evaluate the 
impact of blocking probabilities in a pair(s,d) basis we 
define the fairness in satisfying a lightpath request as follows

where Bp(s,d) is the blocking probability for the pair(s,d).  
 
This formula computes the ratio between the average 
blocking probability of the pair(s,d) with the worst 
performance and the blocking probability of the pair(s,d) 
with the best performance. The graphs presented in Figure 7 
show BSTL's and PIARA's performances in terms of fairness 
for the topologies in Figure 3. It can be observed from these 
graphs that BSTL achieves better performances than PIARA 
for all evaluated scenarios. These superior performance 
results can also be explained by BSTL's load balancing 
strategy.

FINAL REMARKS 
This work presented a reformulation of the problem of 
the best choice of the shortest paths for translucent optical 
networks and proposed a new adaptive routing algorithm, 
named Best Shortest Translucent Lightpath (BSTL), that 
simultaneously considers optical physical layer constraints, 
shortest paths, and dynamic load balancing objectives. This 
new routing strategy had its performance evaluated and 
compared to another algorithm previously proposed in the 
literature, showing its superior performance in terms of 
network utilization, blocking probability and fairness when 
applied to translucent optical networks.
