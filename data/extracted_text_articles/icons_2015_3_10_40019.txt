Abstract—Proposed face recognition in this paper is a block 
based approach. Gabor magnitude-phase centrally symmetric 
local binary pattern (GMP-CS-LBP) has been used to extract 
directional texture characteristics of face at different spatial 
frequencies. CS-LBP is applied on the sub-blocks of magnitude 
and phase responses of Gabor images. Sparse classifier is 
employed as local classifier to find the sub-blocks class labels. 
We have evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm 
on AR and ORL databases. In real world scenarios, partial face 
images are available to recognize the identity of an unknown 
individual. By comparing the recognition accuracy on the 
recognition results of image sub-blocks, we find the location and 
size of the most effective face sub-region for identification. 
Moreover, fusion of image sub-blocks at decision level leads to 
significantly improved recognition accuracy.  
Keywords-face recognition; block based; effective subregion;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Face recognition is widely used as a biological 
identification technique which is applied to recognize an 
unknown individual by analyzing and comparing their facial 
image to the available database of known identities. It has a 
wide range of applications such as social networking, border 
monitoring, access control and law enforcement. The 
accuracy of face recognition is affected by variation in the 
appearance of face due to poor illumination, head pose, facial 
expression, partial occlusion or degradation. In recent years, 
many identification techniques were proposed in order to 
increase the accuracy of recognition versus appearance 
changes. In holistic based approaches, the whole face area is 
employed to extract features and deciding on the identity 
label. A robust image representation against occlusion and 
illumination variation was proposed in [1] using the 
combination of subspace learning and cosine-based 
correlation approach which was applied on the orientation of 
gradient. However, local based techniques by dividing image 
into sub-regions and fusion of the extracted features or 
classification results, leads to robustness against variations in 
the appearance. Local Gabor binary pattern histogram 
(LGBPH) technique was proposed in [2] where, the local 
binary pattern (LBP) histograms of sub-blocks of Gabor 
magnitude images are combined. Different sub-blocks were 
differentiated in concatenation of features, by assigning a 
Kullback–Leibler 
divergence 
(KLD) 
weight 
to 
the 
corresponding sub-blocks. In [3], a block-based face 
recognition technique was proposed by extracting uniform 
LBP histograms. The results of local nearest neighbour 
classifiers are combined using an entropy weighted decision 
fusion to reduce the effect of sub-blocks with less information 
content. Local phase quantization (LPQ) and multi-scale LBP 
were applied on the proposed gradient based illumination 
insensitive representation of image sub-blocks in [4]. 
Weighted fusion at score and decision level finds the identity 
of unknown individuals. In [5] the gray values of pixels in 
image sub-regions were concatenated and class specific multi 
sub-region based correlation filter bank technique (MS-CFB) 
was calculated for the training samples and test images. Local 
polynomial approximation (LPA) filter and directional scale 
optimization was proposed in [6]. LBP directional images 
were divided into sub-blocks at four levels. Finally, linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) was applied on the concatenation 
of local histograms at four levels. Nevertheless, some facial 
areas which contain non-discriminative information can be 
excluded in the recognition process and computational 
complexity is reduced by analyzing fewer image sub-blocks 
instead of the whole face area. This technique is very effective 
when some parts of the face are occluded by an external 
object. In some application such as images acquired by 
surveillance cameras, only a small amount of discriminative 
information in a partial image of the face is available. We need 
to find the most effective sub-image to identify an unknown 
individual whose face is partially covered. The proposed 
approach in [7] addresses partial face recognition using an 
alignment-free combination of multi-keypoint descriptors 
(MKD) and sparse representation-based classification (SRC). 
A set of MKDs were applied on images in the gallery set and 
a partial probe image was represented as a sparse linear 
combination of gallery dictionary.  
In this paper, the image is divided into sub-blocks and the 
proposed face recognition technique which is shown in Fig 1, 
is applied on local areas. The size and location of the most 
effective area of the face in identification process has been 
investigated through the experimental results. We proposed 
Gabor magnitude-phase centrally symmetric local binary 
pattern (GMP-CS-LBP) technique as feature extractor based 
on the symmetry in a local area around image pixels [8]. In 
order to include the magnitude and phase information of local 
characteristics of face which are insensitive against 
appearance changes, we have applied texture descriptor on the 
magnitude and phase responses of Gabor images. The 
extracted features are concatenated for each image sub-block.

II. 
FEATURE EXTRACTION 
The proposed GMP-CS-LBP feature extraction in this 
paper is the fusion of magnitude and phase information of 
Gabor coefficients. Configuration of the proposed feature 
extraction technique is shown in Fig 1.  
A. Gabor Filter 
Gabor filter extracts the characteristics of signal at 
different scales and orientations which resembles the 
mammalia response of vision cells. In order to acquire 
directionally selective local properties of a face image at 
various spatial frequencies which are invariant against 
appearance changes due to expression and illumination 
variations, 2-D Gabor filters at 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 scales and 𝑂𝑚𝑎𝑥 
orientaions are convolved by image. Gabor filters are obtained 
as follows by ranging the spatial scale 𝑠 from 1 to 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 
orientation 𝑜 from 1 to 𝑂𝑚𝑎𝑥 [9, 10],   
         𝜓𝑠,𝑜(𝑥, 𝑦) =

where, 
𝑞𝑠,𝑜 = 𝑞𝑠exp (𝑗𝜃𝑜) = [𝜋 2(√2)𝑠]
⁄
exp (𝑗𝜋 𝑜 8
⁄ ) 
(in this paper we defined 5 scales and 8 orientations). 𝑧 =
(𝑥, 𝑦), and 𝜎 = 2𝜋 [9, 10]. The magnitude and phase 
responses of Gabor filtered image are shown in Fig. 1. 
B. Centrally Symmetric Local Binary Pattern (CS-LBP) 
One of the most powerful local descriptors where the 
texture information are analysed by comparing the intensity 
value of local texture in a small neighbourhood and supress 
the monotonic offset of neighbour pixels is local binary 
pattern (LBP) analysis. LBP is very fast technique and easy to 
execute [8, 10]. In a circular neighbourhood with radius R and 
P neighbours around each image pixel, we compare the 
neighbours with the centre pixel and depending on the sign of 
their difference a 1 or 0 value (for positive difference or 
negative difference, respectively) is assigned to the 
corresponding neighbours. Therefore, a P-bit binary pattern is 
associated with the centre pixel. Thus, for image pixels we 
have decimal values ranging from 0 to 2P which are used to 
construct a histogram of 2P-bin as the texture features. We can 
reduce the number of histogram bins which decreases the size 
of extracted features by employing the symmetry in the local 
area around each pixel. In centrally symmetric LBP (CS-LBP) 
technique [8], the centre symmetric pairs of neighbours are 
compared instead of comparing each of them with the centre, 
as shown in Fig 2. Therefore, the range of decimal values is 
reduced to 0 − 2(P 2
⁄ ) and the stability of the extracted features 
against flat texture is increased. The calculation of decimal 
value associated with the binary patterns is as follows [8],

(𝑢, 𝑣) is the position of centre pixel and 𝐼𝑙 is the intensity 
value of l𝑡ℎ neighbor of the centre. R and P are 1 and 8 in this 
paper. In order to increase the stability against flat areas, the 
intensity differences between centre symmetric pairs are 
compared to a threshold value (𝑇ℎ) greater than 0, which is 
used as threshold in LBP technique [8]. The value which is 
assigned as threshold is defined in the following section.  
C. Local GMP-CS-LBP Histograms 
In order to employ magnitude and phase information 
simultaneously, CS-LBP technique is applied on the 
magnitude and phase responses of Gabor images at different 
scales and orientations. However, the threshold value in (2) is 
different for comparing magnitude or phase information.  
Through the exhaustive search, in this paper we employ 0.1 
as the magnitude threshold and 90° as phase threshold. 
Following by calculation of the binary patterns and the 
corresponding decimal values of image pixels and 
constructing histograms, the 2(P 2
⁄ )-bin magnitude and phase 
histograms are concatenated.  
Furthermore, to find the most effective sub region of face 
image on the identification accuracy, we divide Gabor images 
into rectangular non overlapping sub blocks of 𝑚 × 𝑛 pixels. 
By concatenating the histograms of magnitude and phase 
responses of all scales and orientations of Gabor responses, 
we obtain a histogram of 2(P 2)
⁄
+1 × 𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥 × 𝑂𝑚𝑎𝑥 bins for 
each image sub region.    
III. 
SPARSE CLASSIFICATION 
Local classifiers are based on the sparsest representation 
of the probe sample using the combination of corresponding 
gallery samples of the same class label [11]. Image samples 
which are belonging to the same individual lie on a linear 
subspace.  
                            𝑔 = [𝑔1, 𝑔2, 𝑔3, … , 𝑔𝑀].                           (3) 
                          𝑔𝑖 = [𝑓1
𝑔, 𝑓2
𝑔, 𝑓3
𝑔, … , 𝑓𝑁
𝑔].                          (4) 
 Where, g is gallery dictionary which is including all 
gallery samples in the database. 𝑔𝑘 is the matrix of 𝑘𝑡ℎ class 
of subject which consists of gallery feature vectors as its 
columns (𝑓𝑘
𝑔 is the feature vector of the 𝑘𝑡ℎ sample in 𝑔𝑘), 
where 𝑀 and 𝑁 are the number of classes and gallery samples 
per class, respectively. Therefore, using the matrix of gallery 
dictionary and a coefficient vector we can define the feature 
vector of a probe sample as a linear combination as follows 
[11],   
                                      𝑓𝑖
𝑝 = 𝑔. 𝐵.                                     (5) 
Where, 𝐵 = [0,0, … ,0, 𝛽1
𝑘, 𝛽2
𝑘, … , 𝛽𝑁
𝑘, 0,0, … ,0] and 𝛽𝑗
𝑘is 
the 𝑗𝑡ℎ coefficient corresponding to the 𝑘𝑡ℎ class. The sparsest 
representation of probe sample can be achieved, if only the 
coefficients associated with class label of the probe sample are 
non-zero.  Those coefficients are calculated using the 𝑙1-norm 
solution of equation (5) and the identity label of the probe

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In order to evaluate the performance of proposed face 
recognition technique and effectiveness of face image sub 
blocks on the recognition accuracy, we employ two popular 
databases and apply the identification algorithm on the 128 ×
128 pixel images in the databases.   
A. AR Database 
AR face database includes 2600 images of 100 individuals 
(50 men and 50 women) [12]. Each subject has 26 images 
taken at two different sessions in two weeks (13 images per 
session). The images in the database are affected by 
illumination variation, facial expression and partial occlusion. 
We have employed non-occluded images in session 1 as 
gallery set and non-occluded images in session 2 with 
appearance changes in different time as probe set. Sample 
images of one subject in AR database are shown in Fig. 3.  
B. ORL Database 
Olivetti research lab (ORL) database consists of 40 
individuals with 10 images per subject and appearance 
variation due to illumination changes, different time of 
acquiring image, facial expressions (open/close eyes and 
smiling/not smiling), up to 20 degree tilting and scales [13]. 
We randomly used 5 samples per individual in the gallery set 
and the remaining 5 images per subject in the probe set. Thus, 
we have 200 images per set. Fig. 4 shows of gallery and probe 
image samples of one individual in ORL database.  
C. Partial Recognition Based on the Image Subblocks 
In this experiment, we employ the proposed face 
recognition algorithm using an image sub-block at different 
locations and sizes. In order to find the effective size of 
selected sub-block, we find the accuracy of face recognition 
versus block size which is shown in Fig. 5. It is shown that for 
both databases, block size 32 × 16 pixels leads the highest 
recognition accuracy. The location of the sub-block is near the 
eye area. Fig. 6 shows the selected subregion for AR and ORL 
databases.

D. Decision Fusion for Selected Size of Subblock  
Based on the results of previous section, the highest 
recognition accuracy is obtained at the block size of 32x16 
pixels for both face databases. In this experiment, we employ 
the most effective block size and apply majority voting 
scheme by adding up the votes of local classification results 
of image sub-blocks and finding the class label with maximum 
vote as the final decision. The result of sub-blocks fusion is 
shown in Table 1 and compared to the accuracy of the state of 
the art techniques which shows the effectiveness of the 
proposed face recognition technique.   
However, by employing the recognition process using 
only one sub-block of  32 × 16 pixels rather than the whole 
image or fusion of local recognition results, the computational 
complexity is reduced up to 
1
40.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
A block based face recognition technology has been 
proposed in this paper by dividing the magnitude and phase 
responses of Gabor filtered images. CS-LBP is applied on 
image sub-blocks and concatenation of local histograms at 
different scales and orientations gives the features of image 
sub-regions. Fusion of local decisions made by applying 
sparse classifiers, leads to the final decision on the 
identification of unknown individuals which outperforms the 
state of the art algorithms. However, evaluating the 
recognition accuracy of different sub-regions of the face 
images in AR and ORL databases, gives the size and location 
of the most effective local area which reduces computational 
complexity up to 2.5%.
