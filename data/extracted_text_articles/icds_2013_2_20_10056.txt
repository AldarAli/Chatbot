Abstract—A frequency offset caused by the Doppler shift or the 
mismatch of the oscillators destroys orthogonality between the 
subcarriers in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing 
(OFDM) signals. This paper proposes a frequency offset 
estimation scheme with low complexity for OFDM systems. 
Specifically, we use the coherence phase bandwidth to 
overcome the effect of timing offset and employ a threshold to 
estimate the frequency offset with low complexity. In addition, 
we also propose a timing offset estimation scheme as a next 
stage of the frequency offset estimation. Numerical results 
demonstrate that the proposed scheme can estimate frequency 
offset with lower computational complexity and does not 
require additional memory while maintaining the same level of 
estimation performance in terms of error variance.

 INTRODUCTION 
In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) 
modulation, the data is transmitted on the multiple 
orthogonal subcarriers. Due to its high spectral efficiency 
and immunity to multipath fading, OFDM has attracted 
much attention in the field of wireless communications [1], 
[2]. For example, OFDM has been adopted as the 
transmission method of many standards in wireless 
communications, 
including 
European 
digital 
video 
broadcasting (DVB) [3], IEEE 802.11a [4], IEEE 802.16 [5], 
and Long Term Evolution (LTE) [6]. However, the OFDM is 
very sensitive to the frequency offset caused by Doppler shift 
or the mismatch of the oscillators. To alleviate these 
problems, various techniques have been proposed [7]-[9]. 
Recently, estimation schemes for integer frequency offset 
have been proposed in [10] and [11]. However, the schemes 
in [10] and [11] are either sensitive to timing offset or 
complex to implement. † 
In this paper, a novel frequency offset estimation scheme 
based on the coherence phase bandwidth (CPB) and a 
threshold is proposed for OFDM systems. The proposed 
scheme is robust to a symbol timing offset and has lower 
computational complexity when compared with Nogami’s 
[10] and Bang’s [11] schemes. We also propose a timing 
offset estimation scheme as the next stage of the frequency 
offset estimation. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II introduces the related works on the frequency

offset estimation. In Section III, an OFDM signal model is 
influenced by the frequency and timing offsets is described. 
The effect of timing offset on conventional schemes is 
shown in Section IV. In Section V, a low complexity 
frequency offset estimation scheme is proposed, and then, a 
timing offset estimator is proposed as the next step of the 
frequency offset estimation. Section VI presents numerical 
results, and finally, Section VII concludes this paper.

RELATED WORKS 
To estimate the frequency offset, several schemes have 
been proposed in [7]-[11]. The frequency offset estimation 
schemes can be classified into two categories: fractional 
frequency offset estimation schemes [7]-[9] and integer 
frequency offset estimation schemes [10], [11]. In [7], the 
fractional frequency offset was estimated by using the cyclic 
prefix of an OFDM symbol. The scheme in [8] provides an 
improved estimation performance over the scheme in [7] by 
using a training symbol with identical halves, yet, the 
estimation range was as large as the sub-carrier spacing only. 
In [9], a training symbol with several repeated parts is 
employed to provide the extended estimation range. On the 
other hand, for integer frequency offset estimation, an 
estimation scheme was proposed in [10] using the 
crosscorrelation between the received and locally generated 
training symbols. However, the scheme in [10] is very 
sensitive to the timing offset, thus, in [11], an estimation 
scheme robust to the timing offset was proposed considering 
CPB in its estimation process. However, the scheme in [11] 
has the problem that the complexity rapidly increases, as the 
frequency offset estimation range increases.

THE EFFECT OF TIMING OFFSET ON FREQUENCY 
OFFSET ESTIMATION 
A. Nogami’s Scheme 
To estimates the integer frequency offset, Nogami’s scheme 
calculates the correlation between the known training 
symbol and the cyclically shifted version of the received 
training symbol, and then, obtain the integer frequency 
offset estimate

where 
k
Z  is the transmitted training symbol, 
k
R  is the 
received training symbol, d  is the amount of cyclic shift, 
and ( )N
⋅
 is the modulo-N operator. The scheme was 
proposed assuming perfect timing synchronization, thus, its 
estimation performance degrades in the presence of timing 
offset.  
Fig. 1 shows the correlation values of Nogami’s scheme 
when d
= ε
 and 
N =1024
 in the absence and presence of 
timing offset 
(i.e.,
0 and
0.5, 1, and 2).

 In the 
absence of timing offset, the correlation value increases as 
the integration range increases, on the other hand, in the 
presence of timing offset, the correlation value oscillates.  
Fig. 2 shows Nogami’s correlation function as a function 
of timing offset. From the figure, we can see that the 
correlation value becomes smaller as the absolute value of 
timing offset increases. Especially, when the timing offset is 
an integer, the correlation becomes extremely small. 
Therefore, Nogami’s scheme could be very sensitive to the 
timing offset since the estimate is determined by the 
maximum value of the correlation function. 
B. Bang’s scheme 
The correlation functions of Bang’s scheme are calculated 
individually within each CPB block, and then, summated.

 As shown in Fig. 3, the correlation value 
of Bang’s scheme increases monotonically as the value of 
integration range increases. Fig. 4 shows Bang’s correlation 
function as a function of timing offset. From the figure, we 
can observe that the correlation function has no zero-
crossing point unlike Nogami’s correlation function. Thus, 
Bang’s 
scheme 
would 
have 
the 
better 
estimation 
performance than Nogami’s scheme in the presence of 
timing 
offset. However, Bang’s scheme has 
high 
computational complexity since the correlation values are 
calculated for all possible values of .

The proposed scheme calculates the η  and CPB as in (6) 
and (12). Then, the correlation value is acquired using the 
CPB as in (7). If the correlation value exceeds ,
η  the d  is 
decided to be the correct estimate of

received signal is cyclically shifted by

 and the 
above procedure is repeated. The operation of the proposed 
scheme is described in Fig. 5. When the frequency offset 
range is sufficiently large, the proposed scheme will 
generally have about a half computational complexity 
compared with Bang’s scheme. It also should be noted that 
the proposed scheme does not require additional memory 
for correlation values unlike Nogami’s and Bang’s schemes.

NUMERICAL RESULTS 
A. Frequency offset estimation 
In this section, we first compare the computational 
complexity of the proposed and conventional schemes as 
shown in Table 1. We can see from Table 1, for 
1
L  , 
where L  is the frequency offset range, the proposed scheme 
has approximately a half computational complexity 
compared with the Nogami’s and Bang’s schemes 
(computational complexity of proposed scheme is an 
averaged value).  
In this paper, we use two channel models for performance 
comparisons: AWGN and multipath channel models. The 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of AWGN channel model is 5 
dB. The multipath channel model has four paths with 5, 10, 
and 15 sample delays from the first path, respectively, each 
path has 4, 8, and 12 dB attenuation in the amplitude and 
random phase jitter, and the SNR is 10 dB.

Tables 2 and 3 compare the accuracy of the proposed and 
conventional schemes over AWGN and multipath channels, 
respectively. The frequency offset used in this simulation is 
an integer value in [0, 500], 
N =1024,
 and CPB
= N 32.

As we can see from tables, the proposed scheme exhibits 
significantly 
improved 
frequency 
offset 
estimation 
performance over Nogami’s scheme in the presence of the 
timing offset. Specifically, Nogami’s scheme can correctly 
estimate the integer frequency offset only when the value of 
the timing offset equals to zero, otherwise, the accuracy of 
the scheme severely decreases. On the other hand, Bang’s 
scheme shows the same estimation performance as that of 
the 
proposed 
scheme, 
however, 
the 
computational 
complexity of Bang’s scheme is almost twice the proposed 
scheme as shown in Table 1. 
B. Timing offset estimation 
Fig. 7 shows the error variance of the proposed scheme as 
a function of SNR over AWGN channel. The simulation 
performed 10,000 iterations at each SNR level. We can see 
that the error variance decreases as the value of SNR 
increases.  
Fig. 8 shows the error variance as a function of SNR over 
multipath channel model. Since we assume that the channel 
is time-invariant during one symbol time, the error variance 
of proposed scheme on multipath channel is similar to that 
in Fig. 7.  
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
In this paper, we have proposed a low complexity 
frequency offset estimation scheme using the CPB and 
employing a threshold. Moreover, we have proposed a 
timing offset estimation scheme as the next stage of the 
frequency offset estimation. From numerical results, we 
have shown that the proposed scheme exhibits much lower 
complexity 
than 
the 
conventional 
schemes 
while 
maintaining the same level of estimation performance.  
The proposed scheme is designed to utilize a training 
symbol without assumption on its structure. However, we 
can further improve the performance of the scheme by 
considering the training symbol structure used in industrial 
applications, which is our future research topic. Moreover, 
since the scheme is derived in the absence of noise, we will 
evaluate the estimation performance of the scheme 
analytically in AWGN channel and numerically in practical 
channel environments.
