Abstract— Fertilizers are widely used in agriculture to ensure 
the availability of nutrients for crops. Sensors are being used to 
determine fertilizers concentration in precision agriculture 
systems. In this paper, we present a low-cost sensor for 
determining fertilizer concentration based on optical and 
electromagnetic sensors. The combination of sensors prevents 
the overestimation of fertilizers. Four Two-Coil Systems 
(TCSs) were compared to determine which offered the most 
suitable data for determining the fertilizer in the water. The 
number of spires of powered and induced coils of TCSs ranged 
from 20 to 80 spires. A single configuration using a light source 
and light receptor is proposed for the optical sensor. Six 
calibration samples were prepared to calibrate both the TCSs 
and the optical-based sensor. The calibration samples vary 
from 0 to 10 mL/L of fertilizer. Results indicate that TCS 2 b is 
the one that offers the most accurate results among the tested 
TCSs. The single regression model obtained with data from 
TCS 2 b was characterized by a correlation coefficient of 0.988. 
Finally, the data for both sensors are used in an ANN model to 
predict the fertilizer concentration of samples. The correctly 
classified cases were 100 %.

 INTRODUCTION  
Soil fertility refers to the ability of soil to support and 
sustain plant growth. This ability is influenced by many 
factors, such as nutrient ad minerals presence, soil texture, 
soil organic matter, pH amount of water and biomass [1] 
[2]. Soil minerals usually cover up half of the soil volume, 
and their composition varies among different types of soils, 
changing 
their 
chemical 
composition 
and 
physical 
properties. At the same time, the mineral composition is 
affected by life forms present in the environment, modifying 
them. Moreover, the organic matter, complementary to soil 
minerals and fused together, makes up the solid phase of 
soil. Linked to these phases, another one occupies the rest of 
the soil space. The combination of water and air constitutes 
it. Together, all these phases allow plant growth, limiting or 
favouring organisms’ growth and the living matter on the 
soil [3]. There are several types of fertiliser. They are 
classified according to the number of nutrients they are 
made with, being so, fertilisers with a single nutrient or 
fertilisers with several types of nutrients. Fertilisers with 
several types of nutrients are classified into double nutrient 
fertilisers, combining two necessary elements between 
Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), or Potassium (K) [15]. 
Therefore, to perform the analysis of their phases, 
methods are traditionally used mainly based on chemical 
procedures, with extraction, digestion and processing 
samples, like colourimetry, for example [4]. Not so long 
ago, the use of sensors was an implemented idea with 
successful acceptance. They have the ability to transform 
physical or chemical readings from the environment into 
data signals, capable of being easily read by a system. Being 
said that, it is possible to place a large number of sensors 
around the study area so that they are capable of collecting 
data and sending it to a database. These sensors have two 
main purposes, monitoring the environment and tracking 
objects, animals, humans, etc. [5][6]. 
Typically, chemical methods are necessary for soil 
analysis. 
Nonetheless, 
they 
entail 
many 
associated 
disadvantages such as (i) high cost, (ii) long delay in order 
to obtain the results, (iii) use of reagents, and (iv) sample 
destruction [7]. Nowadays, sensors are able to determine 
soil fertility by taking measures of different parameters, 
such as soil pH, moisture, temperature, electrical 
conductivity, and nutrient levels. By giving these measures, 
it is possible to indicate whether applying any modification 
in the soil environment is necessary. Usually, sensors are 
able to provide relevant values regarding fertility, even in 
the presence of fertiliser [8]. The use of fertilisers allows an 
improvement in the physical soil properties and the 
numerous processes that the soil undergoes [9][10][11]. It is 
described, that a prolonged application and exposition to 
fertilisers, influence the quantity of solid matter [12], soil 
density, structure and ability to retain water [11][13][14]. 
When presicion agriculture is applied to fertilizer 
application in drip irrigation yield increases by 22% [15]. 
The aim of the paper is to verify two sensors, one based 
on EM fields and the other based on optical effects, are 
better to determine the minimum fertiliser concentration 
necessary to optimise its use. For the EM-based sensor, we 
utilised a Two-Coil System (TCS) that used mutual 
inductance. A magnetic field was generated by the first coil 
that was powered with an alternate current (AC) source, 
thereby inducing a magnetic flux in the second non-powered 
coil or induced coil (IC). In order to determine which coil 
was best suited for this test, 4 different coils were tested, 
changing the spires numbers. A light source and a light

detector were used for the optical-based sensor. The 
fertiliser used was a liquid type with double nutrient 
composition, being that N and K. The main novelty of the 
proposed system is the combination of electromagnetic 
(EM) and optic sensors in a classification system so that it is 
possible to avoid overestimation of fertiliser. The system 
will save fertiliser, leading to economic savings for farmers.  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows; Section 2 
outlines the related work. The proposed system is fully 
described in Section 3. Following, Section 4 details the test 
bench. The results are discussed in Section 5. Finally, 
Section 6 summarises the conclusion and future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Currently, different types of sensors are being employed 
for the detection of fertilisers. For instance, visible/near-
infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy was reported to be effective 
in determining fertiliser content and reducing fertiliser waste 
by enabling more precise application of fertilisers by Lin et 
al. [16]. Similarly, a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) 
based sensor was developed by Lavanya et al. [17] for soil 
fertility monitoring. The proposed sensor worked on the 
colourimetric principle consisting of Light Dependent 
Resistor (LDR) and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). 
In 2019 [18], the evaluation of the effects of irrigation 
and the application of mineral and organic fertiliser was 
proposed by mapping the variability of the apparent 
electrical 
conductivity 
using 
multiconfiguration 
electromagnetic induction. Deductions obtained by using this 
procedure showed that long-term fertiliser application 
influenced the electromagnetic induction measures and that 
multi-coil can be used to determine the homogeneity of 
agricultural treatments. According to Basterrechea, et al. [19] 
proposed measuring the quantity of organic fertiliser by 
using inductive coils. The results were rather conclusive, 
showing that one of their prototypes was valid. 
Silva et al. [20] developed a novel procedure for 
detecting contaminants in water and organic fertilisers using 
portable and disposable commercial electrodes. They 
reported the use of electrochemical sensors efficient in 
detecting low concentrations of the substances in both water 
and organic fertilisers and postulated it an appropriate tool 
for environmental monitoring and quality control in 
agriculture.  
Based on different approaches, Qiu and Qu [21] reported 
a novel non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor for the 
detection of nitrite derived from nitrogen fertilisers. This 
sensor was of polyaniline and manganese dioxide, a binary 
nanocomposite material. Further, it was demonstrated that 
electrochemical detection of nitrite is non-enzymatic and 
does not require the use of costly equipment. Recently, 
Meenakshi and Naresh [22] used crop image identification to 
analyse soil health and fertiliser requirement. The study 
utilised deep learning algorithms and random forest 
regression, and the results suggested that this image 
identification approach could be useful for precision 
agriculture and reducing fertiliser waste. Similar outcomes 
were found by Wang et al. [23] when they employed 
machine vision technology to monitor the fertiliser use for 
corn fertiliser planters.  
Nevertheless, all these currently employed fertiliser 
monitoring and estimation methods involve complex 
procedures in their employment, or data processing, or rely 
on a single parameter. Finally, some of the proposed 
solutions may require significant upfront investment or may 
not be financially viable for small-scale farmers, highlighting 
the need for cost-effective solutions. The system proposed in 
this paper is based on the combination of two parameters 
which can be measured using low-cost sensors. The use of 
two parameters reduces the possibility of overestimation due 
to irrigation water with elevated values of turbidity or 
salinity. The reasons to employ these sensors include their 
low cost, high accuracy, and easy deployment. In addition, 
promising results have been reported when similar sensors 
models were utilized in previous studies [18][24][25]. 
III. 
PROPOSAL  
In this section, we detail the proposed system for 
fertiliser monitoring in irrigation systems. First, the EM and 
optical sensors are described. Then, the used node is 
characterised. Finally, the ANN model proposed for data 
classification is presented. 
A. 
Sensor based on EM effects 
Two pairs of inductive coils are tested to evaluate which 
TCS that offers the best results. Each pair of inductive coils 
can be used in two configurations by changing the powered 
and induced coil; more details are provided in the subsequent 
section. Since an alternating current is required to power the 
coil, a specific electronic circuit is included to power the coil 
using the microprocessor. The used circuit is fully described 
in [24]. 
The operational principle of EM-based sensors is that the 
presence of salts in the fertiliser modifies the induction of the 
induced coil, as demonstrated in [18]. Thus, it is expected 
that the Vout of the induced coil changes when the 
concentration of fertiliser is modified. 
B. 
Sensor based on optical effects 
The second included sensor in our proposed system is 
based on light absorption. Thus, a LED and a Light 
Dependent Resistor (LDR) are included. A microprocessor 
module, including an LDR, KY-018 [26], is used. As a light 
source, a white LED has been selected, which is powered by 
the microprocessor. 
The optical-based sensors' operational principle is that 
the fertiliser's presence modifies the water's colour and 
transparency. It has a direct effect on light absortion. 
Therefore, it is expected a reduction in the light transmitted 
to the LDR, which modifies the received Vout in the 
microprocessor. 
C. 
Node 
A microprocessor is used to power the LED, the powered 
coil and the LDR and to receive the signal from the LDR and 
the induced coil. The selected microprocessor must 
accomplish the required analogue input for the coil and the 
35

LDR module. In addition, it must be able to run an ANN 
model. Thus, a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B [27] is selected. 
D. 
ANN model 
The fact of using two sensors is to avoid false detection 
of fertiliser. If the induced coil is the single sensor, when 
fertiliser is added to water with moderate salinity values, as 
happened in some coastal areas, salinity might be considered 
as fertiliser. It will provoke an overestimation of fertiliser 
concentration. Thus, the optical sensor is used. The Artificial 
Neural Network (ANN) is selected to combine the data of 
both sensors. We have selected it since it can be easly 
implemented in the microprocessor. The proposed ANN can 
be seen in Figure 1. 
IV. 
TEST BENCH  
In this section, the complete test bench is detailed. First 
of all, sample preparation is described. Then, used sensors 
and their assemblage are detailed. The equipment used to 
feed the TCS is explained. Finally, the measurement 
procedure for data gathering and data analysis is presented. 
A. 
Sample preparation 
Six fertiliser calibration samples were prepared to create 
a calibration curve to identify the appropriate sensor model. 
A commercial organic fertiliser [28], containing nitrogen, 
phosphorous 
and 
other 
nutrients 
was 
used. 
The 
recommended dose is 10 mL of fertiliser mixed with 1 L of 
water. Therefore, in order to identify the lowest possible 
amount of fertiliser, six dilutions were prepared, see Table I. 
Each calibration sample has a volume of 500 mL. The 
volumes used for the calibration include 100 mL. 
B. 
TCS description 
Two TCSs, TCS 1 and TCS 2, which can be connected in 
four configurations, were employed in these tests. TCSs can 
be seen in Figure 2a and Figure 2b. 
The TCSs can be connected in two different 
configurations (a and b) since they have different spires. The 
number of spires in the IC and the PC of each configuration 
of the used TCSs are summarised in Table II. The wire used 
to craft the coils was enamelled copper coil of 0.4 mm 
diameter. These coils were wrapped on a 25 mm diameter 
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube with an empty core.

Optical sensor assemblage 
The measures were taken by connecting the LDR module 
to the microprocessor. The LED and the LDR were separated 
3 cm by a methacrylate transparent tube. The tube was filled 
with the calibration samples. The Vout from the LDR 
module was obtained from the microprocessor using the 
analogue input.  
D. 
Equipment 
A wave generator, model AFG1022 [29], has been used 
to power the PC. Resistance of 330 Ω was connected in 
series to PC. A sine wave having an amplitude of 3.3 V 
peak-to-peak and 0.045 A have been used to power the coils. 
The used signal generator allows a range of frequencies from 
25 MHz to 1 uHz. 
The IC is connected to an oscilloscope, model TBS1104 
[30]. A capacitor of 10 nF was added in parallel to the IC. 
The complete scheme of the used devices and the electronic 
circuit can be seen in Figure 3.

E. 
Measurement protocol and data analysis 
The measurement protocol followed for the calibration 
process consists of measuring the Vout values of the TCS or 
the LDR module. Measurements started from the most 
diluted samples, sample 1, to the most concentrated one, 
sample 6. Each measurement was repeated three times.  
In the TCS measurement procedure, the oscilloscope is 
used to gather the data as a previous step before adapting the 
required electronic circuit to measure it with the 
microprocessor. The first step is to identify the working 
frequency for each used PC. Once the working frequency is 
determined, calibration starts. For the calibration, the TCS 
was entirely submerged in the calibration samples. Induced 
voltage, Vout, was gathered individually for all used sensors. 
For 
the 
optical-based 
sensors, 
the 
measurement 
procedure 
consists 
of 
adding 
fertiliser 
inside 
the 
methacrylate tube. Then, the white LED is powered by the 
microprocessor. At the same time, the microprocessor reads 
the value from the analogue input of the LDR module. 
Obtained data is statistically analysed. The performed 
analyses include descriptive statistics, simple regression 
models and Discriminant analyses (DA). All these analyses, 
in addition to the ANN, have been performed with the 
Statgraphics Centurion XVIII.  
V. 
RESULTS 
In this section, we present the results from the obtained 
Vout from both sensors. First, the results of the descriptive 
statistics are shown for the Vout of the induced coil to decide 
which coil and configuration are selected. Then, the results 
of the mathematical models are compared. Finally, the 
results of the ANN are analysed. 
A. 
Descriptive statistics of Vout from induced coils 
First of all, the working frequencies are presented. The 
working frequency for the used TCSs was: 147 kHz for TCS 
1 a, 267 kHz for the TCS 1 b, 433 kHz for TCS 2 a, and 665 
kHz for the TCS 2b.  
The summation of descriptive analyses of data from IC 
can be seen in Table III. The Table shows that the coil that 
maximises the average Vout is TCS 1 a. TCS 1 b is 
characterised by a mean Vout of 2.52 V, which is similar to 
the mean Vout of TCS 2 b, 2.21 V. TCS 1 b is the one with 
lowers mean Vout, 1.88 V. The standard deviation (σ) is the 
minimum for TCS 2 a and TCS 2 b. Finally, values of 
Kurtosis and Skewness are between ± 2 for TCS 1 b, 2a, and 
2b. Nonetheless, for TCS 1 a, the values are beyond the 
established thresholds to be considered a variable with 
normal distribution.  
Finally, Figure 4 portrays the distribution of each 
variable as violin plots. For these plots, cosine has been used 
as a smoothing method. The interval width has been set at 
35. The means and outliers are represented in the graphic. 
B. 
Simple Regression Models 
In this section, the single correlation models for each one 
of the EM-based sensors are presented. The regression 
models were selected among the available options, 
maximising the correlation coefficient's value. The summary 
of regression models can be seen in Table IV. In the table, 
the selected model type, the correlation coefficient and the 
R-squared (R2). According to the R2 and correlation 
coefficients, we selected TCS 1 a and TCS 2 b as two 
alternatives for EM-based sensors for the proposed system.  
The correlation models for TCS 1 a and TCS 2 b can be 
seen in Figure 5 and Figure 6, respectively. The 
mathematical model represents confidence and prediction 
intervals in both figures. We selected the second model for 
the obtained models due to their more accurate intervals. 
Moreover, the first option, inducer 1 a, has maximum values 
which are too high for the analogue inputs for the 
microprocessor.  
C. 
Classification Methodologies 
Finally, we combine the data for the Vout from the TCS 
2 b and the LDR module for the classification methods. On 
the one hand, the classification diagram for the DA based on 
generated functions can be seen in Figure 7. On the other 
hand, the classification diagram for the ANN can be seen in 
Figure 8. For the ANN, the dataset was split into a training 
dataset (first and second replicas of tests) and a validation 
dataset (third replica). Regarding the classified cases, both 
tested classification methods, DA and ANN, allow the 
classification of 100% of cases.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
The use of fertiliser has increased considerably in recent 
years. The need to produce food in the shortest possible time 
and protect the fruit against biological agents has become a 
current area of research. 
In this paper, we presented a system for optimising liquid 
fertilisers for irrigation water. The system is based on TCSs 
that generate electromagnetic fields that allow the 
establishment of the concentrations of fertilisers. Thus, Vout 
measurements are established for each solution prepared. A 
function generator has been used and visualised in an 
oscilloscope to generate the electromagnetic field. In 
addition, an LDR and a photoresistor have been implemented 
to obtain data to avoid overestimating the fertiliser 
concentration. After applying the statistical analysis, the 
results show that the system can classify 100% fertiliser 
solutions with different concentrations. 
In future work, we want to maximise the sensitivity of 
the coil at smaller concentrations and check in a real 
environment how the decrease in fertiliser does not affect 
plant growth. This fact would allow economic savings for 
the farmer, as well as a decrease in the use of products in 
agriculture.
