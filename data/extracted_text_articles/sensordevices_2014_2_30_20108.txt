Abstract—We propose a system for generating and controlling 
an ultrasonic acoustic field using multiple acoustic waveguides 
and piezoelectric transducers. This system can be used as a 
high-power ultrasonic source for nonlinear calibration of 
hydrophones. In the system, ultrasonic waves are emitted from 
multiple transducers with controlled transmission delays, and 
the acoustic power is increased through acoustic waveguides 
before being output, this allows synthesis and control of 
ultrasonic acoustic fields. We simulate the proposed system as 
a two-dimensional acoustic field in which the computed output 
sound pressure determines the basic shape of the acoustic 
waveguide. The proposed system of five transmitting 
transducers and five acoustic waveguides was compared with a 
single transmitting transducer, and the results showed a peak 
sound pressure of 1.5-fold increase value at the same beam 
width.

 INTRODUCTION 
 In recent years in medicine, high-intensity focused 
ultrasonic fields have been used in many ways: for cancer 
treatment, including acoustic chemotherapy (sonodynamic 
therapy), for sonoporation to facilitate gene transfer, in 
ultrasonic elastography to image the hardness of soft tissues 
and organs by measuring acoustic radiation pressure, and in 
harmonic imaging methods that utilize harmonics for 
diagnosis. In industry, too, the use of high-intensity 
ultrasonic fields is increasing in applications such as 
ultrasonic cleaners and ultrasonic dispersers. In response to 
this growing use, the Consultative Committee for Acoustics, 
Ultrasonic, and Vibrations, was established in 1998 as part of 
the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. In 
addition to this, between 1999 and 2002 a pilot program of 
the Germany Engineering Physics Institute studied ultrasonic 
power, and hydrophone reception sensitivity was studied 
between 1999 and 2003 under a pilot program of the UK 
National Physical Laboratory [1]. Japan joined this effort in 
2002, when the National Metrology Institute of Japan began 
development of measurement standards for ultrasonic. 
Measurement standards for ultrasonic power of up to 15 
W have been established using the acoustic balance method 
and standards for powers up to 100 W that use calorimetry 
are under development. Measurement standards for 
hydrophone reception sensitivity in the range 0.5–20 MHz 
are complete, and standards are under development for 
sensitivities outside of this range [1]. For ultrasonic power 
in particular, a source that can generate ultrasonic waves in 
the megahertz band at 100 W or more is needed. As 
ultrasonic of increasingly higher intensity is demanded in 
medicine, the desired acoustic fields exceed the region of 
linear increase, becoming nonlinear. For this reason, it is 
expected that nonlinear calibration and evaluation will be 
needed more often. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a 
robust hydrophone that can accommodate the spatial 
distribution of a powerful ultrasonic field [2], at the same 
time, it is necessary to develop a method to transmit high-
intensity ultrasonic power. 
Many previous studies have examined properties of 
acoustic waveguides: dispersion [3] and sound pressure 
profiles [4] in cylindrical waveguides, sharp bending of 
surface sound waves through photonic crystal waveguides 
[5][6], representations of acoustic waveguides with 
distributed transmission lines by scattering matrices [7], and 
ways to increase the sound pressure in a solid waveguide [8]. 
Additionally, one study details a patent for an ultrasonic 
source that can transmit ultrasonic waves along a fiber or 
rod [9]. Also recently, applications using acoustic 
waveguide are as follows: ultrasonic cleaning machine using 
the ultrasonic waveguide tube for reduce damage of the LSI 
pattern [10], structural health monitoring and nondestructive 
evaluation of inaccessible adhesively bonded joints using 
ultrasonic guided waves propagation across waveguide [11], 
the coiled stator ultrasound motor (CS-USM) using a 
closed-loop-type acoustic waveguide made from SUS304 
[12], and microscopic images of tissue using a thin acoustic 
waveguide made from a fused quartz fiber [13]. 
Here, we propose a system for controlling an ultrasonic 
acoustic field by using multiple acoustic waveguides and 
piezoelectric transducers. We investigate the suitability of

the system for use as a high power ultrasonic source by 
numerical simulation of a two-dimensional acoustic field. 
The paper is structured in 5 sections. In Section II, we 
describe an overview of our proposed system. In Section III, 
we describe the basic conditions of 2D acoustic field 
simulation. In Section IV, we describe the two-dimensional 
model, and the simulated spatial distribution, peak acoustic 
pressure for our proposed system using multiple acoustic 
waveguides.  Section V presents the conclusions and future 
works. 
II. 
 OVERVIEW OF THE SYSTEM 
To generate high-intensity ultrasonic waves with a single 
transducer, it is typical to increase the power of the 
ultrasonic wave by applying a higher voltage to the 
electrodes of the piezoelectric element, but this increases the 
risk of deterioration or destruction of the piezoelectric 
element by increased temperature, such as that due to high 
voltage. Also, although focusing the beam of the transducer 
may yield the desired ultrasonic power at the focus, 
quantitative evaluation becomes difficult because the 
produced wave is no longer a plane wave. Figure 1 shows 
the model of the system proposed for generating high-power 
ultrasonic by using acoustic waveguides. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Ultrasonic source system using multiple acoustic waveguides 
and piezoelectric transducers. 
After ultrasonic waves are generated by some of the 
transducers and the sound pressure of each ultrasonic wave 
is increased by the acoustic waveguides, the outputs of the 
ultrasonic point sources on the transmit aperture surface are 
formed into a beam by Huygens’ principle. In this way, a 
high-power sound source can be constructed without 
increasing the output from any single transducer. However, 
because the beam is formed from the point sources, it is 
important to control the amplitude, frequency, and phase of 
the ultrasonic waves that are generated by each of the 
transducers. 
 
 
 
 
III. 
2D ACOUSTIC FIELD SIMULATION 
The Wave2000 (Cyberlogic Inc.) package was used for 
simulation. Wave2000 is a two-dimensional simulator that 
uses the finite difference method [14], a two-dimensional 
displacement distribution is produced in which the relative 
brightness represents the magnitude of the positive and 
negative displacements. Because of this, the data about 
displacement are all magnitudes. As the basic conditions of 
the simulation, a transmitting ultrasonic wave is assumed at a 
longitudinal wave continuous frequency of 1 MHz and 
amplitude of 1 [a.u.]. The acoustic medium is water 
(temperature: 25 °C, speed of sound: 1497 m/s, acoustic 
characteristic impedance: 1.497 MRayl), and the wavelength 
of ultrasonic wave to be transmitted is 1.5 mm. Acoustic 
waveguides are constructed from a boundary of air 
(temperature: 20 °C, speed of sound: 344.0 m/s, acoustic 
characteristic impedance: 0.427 kRayl) that is 0.2 mm thick. 
To investigate the sound pressure distribution of the acoustic 
field, a 0.3-mm wide receiving transducer was aligned along 
the central axis direction or the lateral direction, and the 
peak–peak amplitude of the sound pressure waveform was 
plotted as a relative sound pressure. 
A. Sound pressure characteristics according to length of 
the acoustic waveguide 
In this system, it is necessary to have transmitting 
aperture width of 1.5 ~ 3.0 mm for beam forming. After this, 
following the model of Figure 2, we simulate the sound 
pressure at x mm away point on the center axis from the 
transmitting aperture plane for both transmitter and 
waveguide widths of d = 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, and 3.0 mm and 
waveguide length L mm of the acoustic waveguide.

The results at 30 mm away point are shown in Figure 3. 
At a transmitter width of 1.5 mm, the sound pressure 
becomes a constant that is independent of the length. At 
larger widths, it was found that the sound pressure is 
changed by the length. 
B. Sound pressure characteristics due to bending of 
acoustic waveguide 
To construct a system of transmitting transducers, it is 
necessary to bend the acoustic waveguide. As shown in 
Figure 4, two acoustic waveguides, each 6 mm in length, 
and the transmitting transducers moved from the center axis 
by offsets y0 = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mm, simulate 
the sound pressure at x mm away point from the 
transmitting aperture plane for both transmitter and 
waveguide widths of d = 1.5, 2.0, and 2.4 mm.

waveguide (x = 30 mm). 
The results at 30 mm away point are shown in Figure 5. 
When the acoustic waveguide is focused on a 1.5 mm 
wavelength, it is seen that bending of the acoustic 
waveguide is possible. 
 
 
 
 
C. Sound pressure characteristics due to focusing of 
acoustic waveguide 
Next, waves are focused by an acoustic waveguide, as 
shown in Figure 6, where the acoustic waveguide runs 
straight from the transmitting transducer (12 mm in width). 
The end of waveguide is connected to an acoustic 
waveguide 1.5 mm in width and 6 mm in length. For lengths 
L of the focusing acoustic waveguide in the range 30–51 
mm, the sound pressures at points along the center axis from 
the transmitting aperture plane of the acoustic waveguide 
are calculated.

ULTRASONIC ACOUSTIC FIELDS USING MULTIPLE 
ACOUSTIC WAVEGUIDES 
Figure 8 shows a two-dimensional simulation model of 
the proposed system by multiple acoustic waveguides and 
piezoelectric transducers. This system is composed of five 
transmitting transducers and five acoustic waveguides. The 
apertures of the acoustic waveguides vary from 12 mm to 
1.5 mm along 42 mm of length to provide focus. For 
comparison, a single transducer must be 12 mm in width 
with a 2.4-mm aperture to obtain the equivalent of a 12-mm 
aperture arranged among the five acoustic waveguides. 
Because the inner and outer path lengths of each acoustic

waveguide are different, the beam is formed by delaying 
transmission from the transducers by 0.83, 0.27, 0.00, 0.23, 
and 0.90 μs, this delay happens in order from the top of the 
system. Distances to the transmitting aperture through each 
acoustic waveguide from each transducer are different. 
Therefore, for arrival of ultrasonic waves transmitted from 
each transducer at the transmitting aperture of the 
waveguide simultaneously, each transmission delay time 
was adjusted. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8.  Two-dimensional simulation model of the proposed system. 
Figure 9 shows the two-dimensional distribution of 
displacement by a single transducer. Figure 10 shows the 
same structure with the proposed system. These data show 
that the distribution of displacement by the single-transducer 
system and the proposed system are similar to each other at 
60 mm away.

To quantitatively evaluate the results with the aim of 
determining the center pressure distributions, data from the 
proposed system at beyond 60 mm are overlaid with data 
from the single-transducer system. The results are shown in 
Figure 11.

The results at 60 and 80 mm from the transmitting 
surface are analyzed for a –6 dB beam width, and the rate of 
increase in peak–peak sound pressure is calculated. The 
results are shown in Table I. An 1.5-fold (resp., 1.4-fold) 
increase of peak sound pressure is seen at 60 mm (resp., 80 
mm), and the –6 dB beam width is almost equal between 
systems. But it was found from the graph of the normalized 
acoustic pressure level in Figures 12 and 13, that the 
increase factors of peak side lobe pressure are about 1.3 to 
1.4.

In our proposed system, when changing the number of 
adjacent active transmitting transducer, we simulated the 
maximum sound pressure at the receiving position 40 mm 
and 60 mm from transmitting aperture. Results are shown in 
Figure 14.

CONCLUSIONS 
We used a two-dimensional acoustic field simulation to 
find the basic characteristics of a high-power ultrasonic 
system using acoustic waveguides. The proposed system 
uses five acoustic waveguides instead of a single transducer, 
and achieved a 1.4- to 1.5-fold increase in sound pressure at 
the same beam width. 
In the future, we will consider the shape of the acoustic 
waveguides further and extend the model to a three-
dimensional acoustic field simulation using finite element 
modeling. In addition, we hope to build the probe, acoustic 
waveguide, and pulse generator and test the system 
experimentally.
