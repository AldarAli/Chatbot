Abstract - Condensation associated with the risk of 
electrochemical and chemical migration plays an increasing 
significance in the field of reliability of electronic components. 
The 
trends 
towards 
challenging 
electronic 
assembly 
technologies such as minimization of conductive track widths 
and spacing, and higher density in electric elements are 
increasingly faced with the negative influences of micro-
condensation. The condensation occurs as a result of the 
thermodynamic conditions in the environment of the electronic 
board. The condensed water is in equilibrium of condensation 
and evaporation, not in a static state.  Due to this fact, there is 
a demand for sensors to record the real state permanently. Due 
to its miniaturized packaging, a new generation of micro-
condensation sensors allows placement on different parts of 
electronic devices. Results of field tests in different automobiles 
and in climate chambers are presented. 
Keywords – condensation, humidity, migration, corrosion. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, humidity sensors have found an extended 
range of application. Increasing demand for improvements of 
quality, reliability and energy control of technical and non-
technical processes lead to new relative and absolute 
measurement humidity sensors [1]. The common type of 
sensors, the polymer sensors, is fabricated from a 
hygroscopic material. The electrical properties change as it 
absorbs water molecules. For measurement of absolute 
humidity dew point hygrometers are offered. The gas is 
cooling down until condensation appears on a small mirror. 
The temperature at which this happens is measured and is 
defined as the dew point temperature. The onset of 
condensation is sensed optically [2]. 
Failures of electronic components due to corrosion as a 
result of condensate ion can be studied only to a limited 
extent with the above mentioned instruments [3]. For 
monitoring by measurements of condensation processes in 
field tests or laboratory conditions, new measuring systems 
are required.  
The presented microcondensation sensors measure the 
condensation directly. The basic principle consists of a stray 
field capacitor where the electric flux lines intersect the 
condensed water drops [4]. 
The miniaturization of the stray field interdigital 
capacitor in combination with a signal preprocessing close to 
this transducer, allows the measurement of water mass in the 
range up to 30 µg/mm2. Depending on the comb pattern of 
specifically designed stray field capacity in combination with 
a water drops sensitive detection system, a change of the 
capacity with increasing water mass is fact. By varying the 
comb pattern, the sensitivity to the measured water mass can 
be adjusted (water drops in the range of 5 - 15 or 5 - 30 
µg/mm²).  
II. 
INFLUENCE OF CONDENSATION ON CORROSION 
In the last years, an increasing number of papers were 
published dealing with any kind of corrosion of printed 
circuit electronic boards [5, 6]. Most of these are related to 
failures concerning the electronic reliability. Some authors 
reduce the failure to electrochemical or chemical corrosion 
[7, 8, 9]. Adding the growth of dendrites, the problem is 
becoming worse. Figure 1 presents a selection of typical 
failures.

What do all these examples of corrosion have in 
common? An essential role for the initiation of corrosion 
plays the presence of moisture. The presence of moisture 
causes electrolysis processes. These cause uncontrolled 
currents (leakage). The corrosion occurs by dissolution of the 
metal due to anodic oxidation. Electrolysis processes are 
already initiated significantly at relative humidities below 
dewing. Very thin films of water are formed already at 40 % 
relative humidity. At relative humidity of 60 %, water films 
are formed with a thickness up to 4 molecular layers. This 
water film can already interact with hygroscopic impurities 
on the board. At relative humidity of 80 %, water films are 
formed with a thickness up to 10 molecular layers [10]. 
These act similar to "normal water". Solution processes of 
salts on the surface can start and ionic processes run 
subsequently. In combination with higher temperatures these 
corrosion and migration processes are accelerated. 
Electronic boards are more exposed to changing climatic 
conditions. This is a growing risk of condensation of water

vapor on the materials and components of electronic devices 
and consequently the risk of corrosion.  
The processes could not only be described by the real 
climatic conditions. Rather, knowledge of the processes near 
the surface is required. Quantitative data of surface 
temperature, of humidity in the boundary layer, and, in 
particular, of the real condensation are necessary. Using 
microcondensation sensors, these data can be obtained.  
III. 
MICROSYSTEM 
Based on the increasing interest in direct condensation 
testing, different principles exist (e.g. optical [11], 
optoelectronical [12], and capacity [13] transducers).  
We introduce an impedimetric principle and prefer such a 
solution for reasons of better miniaturization, better 
integration of condensation and temperature sensor, and to 
create smart systems with lower power consumption. 
Because the customer is mainly interested in a calibrated 
sensor signal, the complete micro sensor system must be 
integrated. Starting with the detection system, transducer and 
signal pre-processing, the system has to be completed by the 
signal 
processing 
(linearization, 
error 
compensation, 
calibration, programming) and interface.  
 
A. Detection system 
The detection system consists of a PE CVD Si3N4 layer, 
typically approximately 500 nm in thickness. This system 
has to guarantee a high and long term stability and 
reproducibility (see Figure 2) of condensation. A second task 
of this layer is the protection of the metal layer underneath 
against corrosion.

B. Transducer  
Two transducers are necessary, one for the measurement 
of temperature of the condensate and one for water mass 
measurement. The temperature transducer has been realized 
with a typical monolithic pn - junction. The water mass 
transducer has been designed as stray field capacity with 
interdigital structures (Figure 3). With a gap/line ratio of 
25/33 (Figure 4), water mass measurements are possible 
between 5 and 25 µg/mm2.

C. Signal pre-processing  
With the demand regarding III, the signal pre-processing 
has been reduced to a capacity-frequency converter. This 
converter allows a distance from the sensor element to the 
signal processing of about 1 - 2 meter. The temperature 
sensor does not need signal pre-processing. The change of 
temperature related flow voltage (2 mV/K) can be prepared 
for the electronic via the same signal line. 
The detection system, transducer, and signal pre-
processing are hybrid integrated components (figure 5).

transducer, signal pre-processing) 
 
D. Signal processing/Interface 
To obtain calibrated output signals for temperature and 
water mass, the primary signals from the sensor element 
have to be reworked. Therefore, the electronic part contains 
the appropriate parameters for linearization, temperature 
compensation, and programming. Tests for radio interference 
emission and immunity to electromagnetic fields were 
carried out and the results confirm that the sensor system 
(figure 6) meets the requirements of  the automobile 
industry.

RESULTS 
A. Calibrated output signal 
The sensor system provides calibrated analog or digital 
output signals for temperature and water mass. 
The calibration of the water mass is realized by taking 
pictures of the sensor surface at different stages of dewing 
and simultaneous measurement of the output signal of the 
sensor. By means of image processing, knowing the contact 
angle of water at the sensor surface, and mathematical 
models, a correlation between the determined water mass 
and the output signal was fixed. An external processor 
processes the signals to an analog (0-1V) or digital (I2C) 
output signal (Figure 7).

B. Test results in automobiles 
Different automobile suppliers have measured the 
condensation on different printed circuit boards at several 
places in an automobile and under different climatic 
conditions by means of the condensation sensor.

Group München) 
 
One of the last tests was carried out at BMW, for 
example.  Mounting places chosen were the battery in the 
right-side tray, the transmission tunnel on the airbag sensor, 
the fuse box on the passenger side, the vehicle battery, the 
data acquisition, and the HIFI control unit in the rear trunk. 
Sensor modules are used to measure condensation and 
temperature as well as relative humidity and temperature. 
Figure 8 shows the sensor modules placed on the HIFI 
control unit. 
C. Tests in climate chambers 
Based on the results in the automobile, comparable 
conditions were simulated in climate test chambers. With the 
standard ISO/DIS 16750-4 a temperature and humidity 
profile was defined to generate a dewing effect such as in an 
automobile environment (Figure 9) [14].

With the condensation sensor mounted on the surface to 
be detected, statements can be taken about the real micro 
climate at the boundary layer during the test cycle (Figure 
10).

chamber (t_climate, rH_ climate) 
 
The measured values in Figure 10 confirm that during the 
cycle time of 3 h the surface temperature has increased from 
25 °C up to 80 °C and a condensate of 15 µg/mm2 has 
formed on the board.
