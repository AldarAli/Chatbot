Abstract-Among various storage devices, EDLCs offer high
energy density and long life span, so a lot of applications may
be anticipated in the realm of energy storage devices, such as
those used in electric vehicles or electric power stabilization in
power systems, etc. However, since the voltage limit of the
devices is low, it is necessary to connect them in series in or
parallel. In addition, it is required that they be used in the
region of their critical voltage limit or capacity limit. In order
to apply them efficiently, the devices should be used with
balanced voltage. In this paper, a novel voltage equalizer and
modified
versions
are
presented,
employing
a
CW
(Cockcroft-Walton) circuit. Characteristics of the proposed
circuit are analyzed and improved, especially about charging
response and charging capability.

I. INTRODUCTION
Various
energy
storage
devices,
including
general
secondary batteries, have been reported and examined.
Among them, EDLCs (Electric Double Layer Capacitors),
which are usually called super capacitors, can offer high
energy storage performance in terms of surge power,
efficiency, cold temperature operation and large number of
energy cycles [1].
For these reasons, in power compensating equipments for
voltage fluctuations or instantaneous voltage drop in the
power systems, EDLCs are expected to be applied as
energy
storage
equipments.
Additionally,
in
various
vehicles, such as electric cars and trains, these applications
have just been introduced. In such EDLCs, however, as
voltage limit of devices is low, it is necessary to connect
them in series or parallel configurations, and to use them in
the vicinity of their voltage limit. Consequently, in order to
be used efficiently, these devices must be used in a
well-balanced manner. Amongst various voltage equalizing
techniques, an equalizing method using resistors can be
applied as the most fundamental, simple and effective
solution [2]. When considering the power losses, however,
such methods have restricted application in practice.
Another method, using Zener diodes, has been discussed
and evaluated [1, 3]. In considering the energy consumption
of such Zener diodes, the power capacity of the system may
be limited. Methods employing chopper circuits have also
been proposed [3, 4], but the number of switching devices
and their accompanied control circuitry is increased,
leading to the high cost of such systems. Other original
strategies have been presented and discussed, which use
inverter circuits and transformers. By utilizing the charge
and discharge of EDLCs, their voltages can be held
effectively in equilibrium between device components [5].
Though the inverter circuit is complicated and charging
operations are needed, such methods are suited to the
required increased capacities. The most orthodox method is
thought
to
be
the
forward
converter
method,
using
transformers, which accompany each EDLC, and charge
and
discharge
through
their
primary
and
secondary
windings [6-10]. In a similar to solution [3], their controls
may be complicated by many devices like transformers.
Although such devices are necessary, however, their size is
very small. Thus, this technique is expected to be widely
used in extensive applications like the electric vehicles [14].
Considering the various types of EDLC voltage equalizers,
perfect or even adequate solutions have not been obtained.
Although, in the future, various other methods will be
studied and proposed. In the light of the above research into
voltage equalizers for EDLCs, we had initially studied
reference [6-9], and derived novel methods which was
examined and discussed in [10]. An alternative approach to
voltage balancing was presented, employing a Cockcroft-
Walton circuit (CW circuit), which was invented long ago
[13] for high voltage generation and employs numbers of
capacitors and diodes. By means of this CW circuit, EDLCs
having
different
capacitances
were
made
to
provide
identical voltage. Voltage equalizing is achieved with an ac
power supply or buck-boost chopper. [14] Their analyzed
results and the mechanism are presented and discussed. In
this paper, these results are applied to equalize the small
voltages of EDLC cells. Another splendid equalizer was
also proposed [11, 12], in which the cells are controlled by
means of a string of reference capacitors and double groups
of switches. The equalizing operation is a little analogous to
the CW circuit, so its principle is interesting. The circuit
and its operation, however, is a little complicated, and yet
the operational principle is entirely different. Under such
background, analytical and experimental results will be
presented and discussed.

II. CIRCUIT CONFIGURATION AND
OPERATION
Figure 1 shows the proposed fundamental circuit for
the
equalized
charging
of
EDLCs,
using
CW
(Cockcroft-Walton) circuit. C1
* to C5
*, on the left-hand side,
indicate, for example, electrolytic capacitors, which have
relatively uniform values and can be obtained at low cost. e
is ac power supply, which often uses commercial frequency.
The purpose is not to supply the output power to these, but
to supply relatively reduced power in order to compensate
the EDLC of voltage unbalanced.
Figure 1.
Basic novel voltage equalizer
Let us discuss about charging the C1 on the first stage.
First, C1
* is charged in the first half cycle to Vc1
* = E, where
E is average value over half cycle. After that, in the second
half cycle, C1 is charged by the sum of power supply e and
C1
* voltage. As a result, C1 is charged toward VC1 = 2E. The
mechanism of the proposed circuit using CW circuit is
analogous to SC (switched capacitor) method [7]. By means
of switching between two groups of capacitors, each
different value of voltage can be averaged between each
device. In SC method, the voltage can be transferred
towards the both direction, upper and lower sides, however,
in the proposed CW circuit the voltage is transferred only in
one direction. However, alternative circuits are attached to
the lower terminal of the power supply e, the corresponding
voltage can be transferred towards such lower side, In
conclusions of this chapter, in the proposed circuit, as
shown below the number of switches can be reduced to
single
from
many
ones
in
the
conventional
voltage
equalizer systems. The ac supply voltage shown as e,
sometimes called as ac voltage exciter, might have not strict
value. Even if the supply voltage is given by rough value,
the corresponding capacitor voltages can become a desired
value. The reason can be explained as follows; if the
voltage is large than we thought, the total piled up terminal
voltage is increased. As a result, the discharged current or
ac supply current is also increased, so the voltage drop
across inductor L is increased, leading to the reduced ac
voltage exciter.
III. BUCK-BOOST CHOPPER METHOD
For another example of circuit configuration, we have
proposed a modified circuit, which is constructed using
buck-boost chopper. Their chopping frequency is high, and
by turning-on and turning-off with suitable duty cycle, a
certain ac voltage is generated across the inductance L1,
which plays the role of ac voltage power supply, as above
mentioned ac power supply. In an analogous manner, each
voltage on the EDLCs can be controlled uniformly. At the
bottom side of the circuit, chopper exciter is constructed by
familiar Zeta converter. As such converter, the circuit can
play a role of buck-boost chopper, which is employed as
chopper exciter without switching surge.

IV. IMPROVEMENTS OF FUNDAMENTAL CW CIRCUIT
A. Improvement of Dynamic Response
In the fundamental CW circuit as voltage equalizer in
Figure 1, the boost circuit on the left-hand side is
constructed by electrolytic capacitors shown by C1
* to C5
*.
Even though by increased such capacitance, however, the
long
charging
time
is
required,
leading
to
long
equalization compensating time. In terms of dynamic
response, it is disadvantageous as practical applications.
From such reasons, such dynamic response characteristic
is examined and resolved as follows; The EDLCs, Cn on
the right-hand side are kept constant, while electrolytic
capacitors, Cn
* on the left-hand side are made gradually
increased, by which convergent characteristics can be
obtained as shown in Figure 3(a), For reduced value of
Cn
* , as the charging and discharging current are much
smaller, so convergent time is limited by such reduced
capacitance, leading to deteriorated dynamic response. For
such case of significantly reduced Cn
* compared to Cn, the
dynamic response is poor. An adequate selection for Cn
*
could be much important. In the figure, when Cn
* is
gradually increasing and Cn
* /Cn reaches beyond 1/100,
then the convergent characteristics are much improved as
shown.
After
keeping
straight
line
curves
with
nearly
constant, the characteristics is becoming deteriorated
again from about Cn
* /Cn= 1. The reason can be explained
that the charging current is gradually saturated about from
that Cn
* /Cn =1 due to rush current suppression inductor L
in Figure 1. From such saturated point, the increasing rate
of current is suppressed. Figure 3(b) shows the variation
of current due to Cn
* / Cn. From about Cn
* /Cn =1, the
current is saturated by suppresion inductor L. By means of
such reasons, we can obtain a conclusion that the optimum
convergent characteristic can be obtained between Cn
* /Cn
= 1/100 and 1.0. The convergence deterioration by further
increasing Cn
* is due to above mentioned additional
inductor to suppress the excessive rush current. In such
way, as Cn
* is increasing, the required electric charge is
also increased. It can be seen that the optimum region of
Cn
* /Cn exists.

Modified equalizer in the CW circuit
In this section, to improve the dynamic response, the
CW circuit is a little modified, where another circuit is
added at the lower side as well as the upper one in the
fundamental circuit. That circuit is shown in Figure 4. In
this figure, the voltage of C2 and C3 are charged in half
compared to the other capacitor one. Though the circuit
operation has two equalizing directions, the principle of
the voltage equalization is the same as the fundamental

one in Figure 1. The convergent characteristic for the
conventional one is shown as case A and the proposed
modified one is shown as case B in Figure 5. With
compared between both cases, the convergence time is
improved at twice over the whole region, where the
horizontal axis shows the ac supply voltage. As it can be
seen, as the voltage is increasing, the convergent time is
becoming gradually improved. For modified one as case B,
dynamic response can be much reduced to half as
mentioned.

Convergent characteristics for driving voltage
V. IMPROVEMENT OF DEVICE UTILIZATION FACTOR
In previous publications, the authors have discussed a
novel voltage equalizer under various view points. Using
the CW circuit, the circuit is constructed by a chopper or
an ac power supply, and the boost circuit of electrolytic
capacitors on the left-hand side. If the boost circuit on the
left-hand side is replaced by EDLCs, such capacitors
could be sufficiently utilized by energy storage devices
that device utilization factor for energy storage capability
could be much increased.
A. Ac Power Supply Method
Figure 6(a) is a fundamental voltage equalizer using ac
power supply, e as an exciter. Both C1 to C3 on the
left-hand side and C4 to C6 on the right-hand side are
entirely EDLCs to charge and discharge with voltage
equalization function. L1 to L3 are for rush current
suppression, where L2 is for charging and L3 is for
discharging C1 to C3 with respect to external power supply.
After C1 is charged by ac power supply e, the following
discharge current due to reversed voltage of e is prevented
by diode D1. At this time, the electric charge of C1 is
transmitted to C4 through L3-C1-C4 , and can be obtained
an equality, VC1= VC4
At the second stage, as each capacitor can be operated
like the first stage operation. In such way, subsequent
operation at the upper side, an analog operation can be
repeated like one of fundamental circuit in Figure 1. Thus,
C1 to C6 can be charged in equalization. This circuit merit
is that as the whole capacitors are employed as storage
devices, the device
utilization factor can be
much
improved. As the whole capacitors can play the role of
storage devices having identical voltage, there is no need
to make a particular specification as compared to the basic
CW equalizer having different value of electrolytic
capacitors and voltage.
B. Chopper Circuit Method
Figure 6(b) shows another proposed method using
chopper circuit instead of ac power supply in Figure 6(a).
By means of switching operation of S1 , the voltage is
applied across the L1, by which the similar operation is
performed compared to that of Figure 6(a). Thus, C1 to C6
can be made equal voltages.
Figure 6.
Novel equalizers. ac voltage exciter (a) and
chopper exciter (b)
The operation mechanism can be described as follows.
By means of S1 turning-on, magnetic energy is stored in L1,
whose energy is discharged by the subsequent turning-off
and stored in C1. As far as L1 energy is concerned, there is
no surge generation through closed loop during turning-off.
In the ac voltage exciter method in Figure 6(a), there is
unnecessary current loop like L1 - e - L3, during positive
polarity ac voltage, where L1, energy is lost towards L3. For
a case of chopper excitation in Figure 6(b), however, such
unsatisfactory current could be much reduced, leading to
make circuit specification simpler.

VI. OPERATION CHARACTERISTICS
A. Ac Power Supply Method
Figure 7 shows the voltage equalizing characteristics
for ac voltage excitation in Figure 6(a), where as voltage
is 35 V, frequency is 1 kHz, external dc voltage is 45 V,
capacitance of C1 to C6 is 0.2F, where C2 and C4 is 0.1F,
which are assumed to be deteriorated by aging. The initial
voltage is given by C1 = C3 = C5 = C6 =11.25V, C2 = C4 =
22.5V, respectively. It can be seen that after the excitation
starts, each EDLC, C1 to C6 is converging towards desired
voltage 15 V in about 9 sec. Even though different value
of capacitance, each voltage is converging toward such
desired voltage.
Figure 7.
Voltage converging characteristics by ac supply
exciter
B. Chopper Circuit Method
Figure 8 shows the convergent characteristic for Figure
6(b). The duty cycle of chopper, d = 0.02, dc power supply
E = 45V, C1 to C6 = 0.2F, where C2 and C4 are assumed to
be deteriorated by aging. That is, 0.1F. The initial voltages
are C1 = C3 = C4 =C6 = 11.25 and C2 = C4=22.5V. EDLCs of
C1 to C6 can be converged to the desired value of 15V in
about t = 47s. As it can be seen, it is required to take a long
converging time. The reasons could be described as
follows; because of unstable specification due to reduced
duty cycle and of the significant influence of the external dc
power supply having constant voltage source, it would
require to take a long time to reach in a stable state.
Figure 8.
Voltage balance characteristics by chopper exciter
Figure 9 shows various operational waveforms when
the convergent characteristics can be obtained by chopper
excitation method in Figure 6(b). Because of stable state
after reaching to convergent, each current is fairly reduced.
By means of switch S1 turning-on, the current iS1 is
increased linearly. As a result, the direct connected next
inductor L1 is also increasing in a similar as iL1.

Current waveforms for chopper exciter
VII. CONCLUSION
A novel voltage equalization using a CW circuit with ac
supply or chopper has been proposed and discussed.
Various modified version have been also considered. It is
easy
to
apply,
because
of
its
simple
and
concise
construction. The purpose of this system is not to obtain
boosted power, but to correct unbalanced voltage. Since
such compensating power is not large, the ac power supply
or chopper is small in size.
On the first stage in this paper, Zeta converter as
buck-boost chopper is presented as a novel version, where
the circuit operation is analyzed
and
specified. The
proposed
method
needs
a
corresponding
number
of
electrolytic capacitors. However, it may be possible that
such capacitors can be replaced by EDLCs, in which case,

the system capability in capacity could be somewhat
increased. In such purpose, a novel voltage equalizer is
newly proposed. Since every device is constructed by
EDLCs, the circuit specification could be simple and the
dynamic response could be expected to be much improved
because of transmittal current can be more increased.
The proposed method has a slight disadvantage, in terms
of circuit response, because the command is gradually
delivered from the bottom to the top side. As far as the
circuit construction is concerned, however, the proposed
configuration piles up multiple devices in succession, so the
extension of a circuit is very easy.
In this paper, voltage equalizer for EDLC is discussed.
For various secondary batteries like lithium-ion battery,
however, the proposed system could be applied in a similar
manner. Especially, in an electric vehicle, such batteries are
much expected to be practically employed at low cost. If the
proposed system could be applied to such ones, simple
voltage equalizer might be realized in the near future.
