Abstract—With recent progress in Internet services and high-
speed network environments, cloud computing has rapidly 
developed. Furthermore, the hybrid cloud configuration is now 
attracting attention, because it offers the advantages of both 
public and private clouds. However, public clouds have the 
problem of uncertain security, while private clouds have the 
problem of high cost. Thus, risk assessment in a hybrid cloud 
configuration is an important issue. Our previous study 
analyzed qualitatively risk assessment of the hybrid cloud 
configuration. Accordingly, through analysis of risk in a 
hybrid cloud configuration, 21 risk factors were extracted and 
evaluated, and countermeasures were proposed. However, we 
recognized that it was only a qualitative study and that a 
quantitative evaluation would be needed to make its 
countermeasures more practical. Hence, in this paper, the risk 
factors identified in the previous study are analyzed and 
quantitatively evaluated. Specifically, the values of the risk 
factors were approximately calculated by using a risk formula 
used in the field of information security management systems 
(ISMS). On the basis of these values, the effect of the 
countermeasures proposed in the previous study was evaluated 
quantitatively. It was found that the countermeasures in the 
previous study could reduce their corresponding risk factors 
by about 18% - 36%. The results herein can be used to 
promote hybrid cloud computing services in the future.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recent years have seen great progress in Internet services 
and high-speed network environments. As a result, cloud 
computing has rapidly developed, with two main forms. First, 
public clouds are operated by service providers, such as 
Google and Amazon. Second, private clouds are built and 
operated by individual enterprises for their own use. 
Generally, a public cloud eliminates the cost of unnecessary 
facilities and offers rapid flexibility and scale. However, 
since a public cloud effectively has invisible features in a 
virtual configuration, enterprise users are uncertain about the 
cloud's security and aspects of practical use. On the other 
hand, a private cloud offers visualization of management, 
since the enterprise operates its own facilities, and 
guarantees security in accordance with the company's own 
policies. The drawbacks to a private cloud, however, include 
greater cost for maintenance and management of facilities, 
and so forth [1]. 
As one example, an incident of missing data and leakage 
by a cloud operating company, called the "big ripple," 
occurred in June, 2012, in Japan [2]. When a cloud provider's 
management handles security poorly, serious risks occur 
only in the public clouds that it manages, so such incidents 
may become apparent to users. On the other hand, a hybrid 
cloud form, combining aspects of both public and private 
clouds, is now attracting attention. Generally in a hybrid 
cloud, data requiring high security is handled within a private 
cloud, while data requiring easy operation at low cost is 
handled in a public cloud [3].  
Thus, although the hybrid cloud form requires two 
different cloud forms be maintained and managed, its 
operation also depends on the kind of data. Furthermore, 
various risk factors are involved, such as accidentally saving 
to a different cloud during data storage [4]. For these reasons, 
it is important to investigate risk management in a hybrid 
cloud configuration. We also applied a risk assessment 
method for analysis and evaluation from a comprehensive 
viewpoint. As a result, 21 risk factors in a hybrid cloud were 
extracted, and countermeasures were proposed. However, it 
was only a qualitative study, meaning that a more practical 
quantitative evaluation still needed to be undertaken.  
In this paper, we describe a quantitative evaluation of the 
risk factors of a hybrid cloud obtained in our previous study 
and the proposed countermeasures. Specifically, a risk value 
based on the formula is approximately calculated for each 
risk factor [5]-[7]. Then, on the basis of this value, the effect 
of the countermeasures on the risks can be quantitatively 
evaluated. It is shown that the countermeasures in the 
previous study can reduce their corresponding risk factors by 
about 18% - 36%. We believe that the results of this study 
will help to promote hybrid cloud computing services.

Section 2 reviews the hybrid cloud computing that has 
been studied so far. In Section 3, we describe our previous 
study and the present problem. Section 4 describes the 
quantitative evaluation of hybrid cloud computing's risks. 
Section 5 is a conclusion and describes future work. 
II. 
HYBRID CLOUD CONFIGURATION 
Cloud computing has now shifted to the practical use 
stage, and many cloud-related services increased sales in 
2011. Moreover, many user companies are verifying the 
possibility and practicality of cloud computing in introducing 
information and communications technology (ICT). Cloud 
computing analysis is thus recognized as a key stage in 
systems configuration [8]. 
A. Reference Model of Cloud Computings 
As shown in Figure 1, software as a service (SaaS), 
platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure or hardware 
as a service (IaaS or HaaS) are classified as the main 
components of the present cloud computing model. 
Moreover, in terms of deployment models, cloud computing 
is classified into public, private, and hybrid or managed 
clouds. Finally, cloud computing includes the roles of cloud 
provider and cloud user [9]. 
B. Hybrid Cloud 
Although the hybrid cloud appears in the reference model 
of Figure 1, its concrete configuration combines a public 
cloud and private cloud, as shown in Figure 2. Usually, a 
company creates a hybrid cloud, and the company and a 
public cloud provider share executive responsibility. The 
hybrid cloud uses both public and private cloud services. 
Thus, when a company requires both public and private 
cloud services, a hybrid cloud is optimal. In this case, the 
company can summarize its service targets and service 
requirements and then use public or private cloud services 
accordingly. Thus, service correspondence can be attained in 
constituting a hybrid cloud, not only for a secure, mission-
critical processes like employee salary processing but also 
for business information such as payment receipts from 
customers. 
However, the main problem with a hybrid cloud is the 
difficulty of actually creating and managing such a solution. 
The public and private clouds must be provisioned as if they 
were one cloud, and implementation can become even more 
complicated. Therefore, since the hybrid cloud concept is a

comparatively new architecture in cloud computing and best 
practices and tools have not yet been defined, companies 
hesitate to adopt hybrid clouds in many cases [10]. 
Hence, this paper examines the subject of hybrid cloud 
configuration in terms of these risks that adoption entails. 
That is, from the viewpoints of both a cloud user and a cloud 
provider, we consider what kinds of risks are assumed and 
develop a concrete risk management strategy. 
C. Related work 
Many security-related papers about hybrid cloud 
computing have been published [11]-[18]. In particular, as 
for the references [11] and [12], comprehensive analysis is 
conducted in detail about the security of cloud computing. 
However, the analysis of the security in a hybrid cloud 
configuration of these references is not sufficient. For 
example, these papers didn't focus on various threats in 
hybrid cloud computing. Also in hybrid cloud, there are 
threats, such as an operation mistake etc. of the cloud 
administrator who mentioned in Section 1. Furthermore, a 
user's operation mistake is also assumed as a threat peculiar 
to hybrid cloud. For example, when a user saves data, it is a 
case saved at different cloud by mistake.  
On the other hand, we have already considered the risk 
assessment of hybrid cloud computing from the viewpoint 
of a user [19]. However, this evaluation is qualitative and is 
not sufficient. Therefore, this paper describes the risk 
assessment of hybrid cloud computing and adds a 
quantitative evaluation.

PREVIOUS STUDY: RISK ASSESSMENT IN 
HYBRID CLOUD CONFIGURATION 
A. Extraction of Risk Factors 
To extract the risk factors in a hybrid cloud configuration, 
we applied the risk breakdown structure (RBS) method, 
which is a typical method of risk management in project 
management [20]. Table 1 lists the extracted risk factors. As 
shown in the table, the hybrid cloud configuration was 
classified at the highest level into system, operation, facility, 
and miscellaneous categories from a comprehensive 
viewpoint. A total of 21 risk factors were extracted [19].

B. Risk Analysis in Hybrid Cloud Configuration 
Next, we devised potential countermeasures against the 
identified risks; these are shown in Table 2. The risk matrix 
method was used to deduce these countermeasures [21]. As 
shown in Figure 3, this method classifies countermeasures 
into four kinds in accordance with their risk probability and 
risk impact, i.e., Risk Transference, Risk Mitigation, Risk 
Acceptance, and Risk Avoidance. Furthermore, it gives 
guidelines to draw up countermeasures. Table 2 lists the 
classification of the risk matrix methods in correspondence 
with its proposed countermeasures. 
Risks are classified in accordance with the risk 
impact and risk probability. Countermeasures 
corresponding to each are as follows.

C. Problem of the previous study 
The previous study was qualitative; a more practical 
quantitative evaluation is needed in order to implement the 
countermeasures it identifies. The current study thus is a 
quantitative risk assessment of the risk factors obtained in 
our previous study and its proposed countermeasures.  
IV. 
QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF HYBRID CLOUD 
COMPUTING'S RISKS AND PROPOSED COUNTERMEASURES 
Here, the validity of a countermeasure is evaluated 
through a quantification of the risk factors shown in Table 2. 
First, a risk formula used in the field of information security 
management systems (ISMS) is shown [5]-[7]. Next, an 
approximation is described for calculating a risk value on the 
basis of our previous qualitative results [22]-[23]. Finally, a 
risk value for hybrid cloud computing services is deduced by 
using the formula and approximation. 
A. Risk formula  
Each risk value is quantified by using (1), which is used 
in the field of ISMS [5]-[7]. 
 
Risk value = value of asset * value of threat 
                               * value of vulnerability                     (1) 
 
Generally, all elements of the right-hand side of (1) are 
very difficult to calculate. In this paper, the following 
approximation is used to simplify these elements [22]-[23]. 
1) Approximation of the Asset Value 
Here, the asset value of (1) is approximated in terms of 
the risk impact in the risk matrix, as shown in Figure 4. This 
approximation is based on the following reasons. The 
amount of damage was regarded for assets. As the further 
approximation, it was considered that the amount of damage 
was risk impact. Additionally, references [5]-[7] define the 
risk impact as 1 (low) to 5 (high). As a further approximation, 
these values are mapped in risk impact to a risk matrix [22]-
[23]. As shown in Figure 4, the risk impact of the risk matrix 
is divided in two. For the sake of simplicity, the higher of the 
two divisions approximated to the maximum risk impact 
(risk value ≒ 5). Similarly, the lower of the two divisions 
approximated to the minimum risk impact (risk value ≒ 1).

Figure 4.  Risk Value Approximation of Risk Matrix [15] 
2) Approximation of the Threat Value  
The threat value of (1) is approximated in terms of the 
risk probability in the risk matrix, as shown in Figure 4. This 
approximation is based on the following reasons. It was 
supposed that threat was strongly dependent on risk 
probability. From references [5]-[7], the risk probability is 
defined to range from 1 (low) to 3 (high). These values are 
mapped to the generation frequencies of the risk matrix in 
Figure 4, as well as the above-mentioned risk impact 
approximation. That is, the higher of the two divisions 
approximated to the maximum risk probability (risk value ≒ 
3), and the lower of the two divisions approximated to the 
minimum risk probability (risk value ≒ 1). 
3) Approximation of the Value of Vulnerability 
The vulnerability evaluation is defined in references [5]-
[7] as well. It is defined on a three-level scale: 3 (High), 2 
(Medium), and 1 (Low). These levels were approximated in 
accordance with the classification of the risk matrix in Figure 
4. Here, the four domains of the figure are classified into 
three categories in accordance with the risk probability and 
risk impact, as follows. 
 Risk Avoidance: both the risk probability and risk impact 
are high. It approximately corresponds to the highest 
risk classification. 
 Risk Transference and Risk Mitigation: either the risk 
probability or the risk impact is high. They 
approximately correspond to the second highest risk 
classification. 
 Risk Acceptance: both the risk probability and risk 
impact are low. It approximately corresponds to the 
lowest risk classification. 
 
In the above-mentioned classification, Risk Avoidance 
cases are approximated to 3 (High), Risk Transference and 
Risk Mitigation cases to 2 (Medium), and Risk Acceptance 
cases to 1 (Low). 
As mentioned above, (1) is approximated as (2). In 
addition, the approximate value of each parameter of (2) 
becomes as shown in Table 3 and Table 4. 
 
Risk value ≒ value of risk impact * value of risk 
probability * value of vulnerability          (2)

B. Calculation of risk value 
The risk values before applying countermeasures against 
risks were calculated using (2) (see Table 5 (Before 
Countermeasure)). 
Next, the risk values after applying countermeasures 
were calculated. The following countermeasure was chosen 
from the viewpoint of practicality: "design reinforcement of 
the Cloud construction". This countermeasure can be easily 
implemented, although its costs may be problematic. Table 5 
(After Countermeasure) shows the resulting risk values when 
performing the countermeasures.  
Here, supposing an ideal case, vulnerability was assumed 
to be 0 as a result of using the proposed countermeasure. 
Moreover, supposing an actual case, this countermeasure is 
not always perfect. Thus, the vulnerability of an actual case 
is approximated to 1 (the minimum level). 
 
C. Results of evaluation 
Table 6 summarizes the results shown in Table 5. 
Although only the "design reinforcement of the Cloud 
construction" countermeasure was evaluated in this study, 
this table shows that the risk can be reduced between about 
18% and 36%. These results also show that a detailed 
numerical expression can treat a risk more specifically by 
quantifying it and the prospective countermeasure. 
D. Discussion 
As mentioned above, it is not realistic to perform all of 
the proposed countermeasures on the risks in Table 2. Thus, 
this study dealt with only one ("design reinforcement of the 
Cloud construction") chosen on the basis of its practicality.  
However, as mentioned above, the problem of cost might 
also affect this countermeasure. Generally speaking, this 
countermeasure can become expensive because it needs a 
specialist's knowledge. In the future, we will have to devise a 
verification considering such cost.

V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We are interested in promoting hybrid cloud computing 
services as a next-generation digitized infrastructure by 
assessing their risks and proposing countermeasures. In our 
previous study, although countermeasures were developed 
from a qualitative risk assessment, their effectiveness could 
not be quantified. Hence, in this study, we performed a 
quantitative evaluation that used a risk value. It was shown 
that countermeasures labeled "design reinforcement of the 
Cloud construction" in the previous study could reduce their 
corresponding risk factors by about 18% - 36%. These 
results mean that the countermeasures developed in our 
previous qualitative evaluation can be more specifically 
evaluated as to their effect by introducing a risk value. 
In the future, we will further improve countermeasures 
and verify their cost effectiveness.
