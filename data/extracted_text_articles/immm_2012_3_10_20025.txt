Abstract—A novel network-monitoring system for detecting 
abnormal network conditions (such as hidden network 
congestion) is proposed. The proposed monitoring system is 
based on self-learning and multi-dimensional analysis. It 
analyzes multiple parameters such as consumed bandwidth, 
packet size, and arrival interval of network packets 
simultaneously. By executing high-quality network monitoring 
it thereby achieves multi-dimensional analysis by use of 
Mahalanobis distance. A prototype monitoring system was 
constructed and evaluated. The evaluation results indicate that 
the monitoring system can accurately detect a hidden change 
of network-traffic conditions and reduce the number of 
unnecessary alerts for monitoring excess bandwidth according 
to a set threshold.

INTRODUCTION 
To reduce environment load from the viewpoint of 
energy efficiency, lowering the power consumption of cloud-
service systems is attracting much interest. In a current 
cloud-service system, to reduce power consumption of the 
system, a management server triggers migration of a virtual 
machine (VM), aggregates virtual servers from one server to 
another, and switches off unused physical servers. A power-
saving information and communication technology (ICT) 
platform is previously proposed. [1]  
The ICT platform has to guarantee network bandwidth 
for cloud-service systems. If a system-management server 
executes VM migration without considering network-link 
capacity, volume of network traffic may surpass network-
link capacity (because network flows connected to the VM 
are also moved from one network to another). As a result, 
unexpected network congestion may occur. Moreover, 
quality of service (QoS) such as bandwidth guarantee may 
not be maintained. It is therefore important to rapidly and 
accurately monitor the network and to execute VM migration 
according to the monitored network conditions.  
On the contrary, if the management server switches off a 
preliminary server used for redundancy in order to lower the 
power consumption of the cloud-service system, a ―cloud-
service fault‖ may occur because the redundant server is 
switched off. Accordingly, to run a cloud-service system 24 
hours a day all year and maintain QoS, network faults must 
be rapidly detected. 
To address the above-mentioned issues, so-called 
―feedback control‖ [2] by monitoring a system is expected to 
provide stable and high-quality cloud services. For finding 
network faults, it is especially critical that network 
monitoring rapidly detects abnormal increases or decreases 
of network traffic. In the present work, to meet that need, a 
novel network-monitoring method for rapidly detecting 
abnormal changes of network-traffic conditions was devised.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
summarizes issues about network operation and management. 
Section III outlines a proposed method. Sections IV describe 
a prototype network-monitoring system. Section V evaluates 
the prototype network-monitoring system. Section VI 
concludes this paper. 
II. 
ISSUES CONCERNING NETWORK OPERATIONS AND 
MANAGEMENT  
Network-traffic conditions are typically monitored by a 
method for network operations and management such as 
simple network management protocol (SNMP). In addition, 
the monitored data is analyzed according to a one-
dimensional 
threshold 
(such 
as 
consumed 
network 
bandwidth) without distinguishing different network flows. 
If network traffic fluctuates around a predefined alarm 
threshold such as network bandwidth, however, an alarm 
may occur frequently. In that case, the administrator of the 
network will receive many alarms even if no fault or 
problem has occurred in the network. In other words, 
applying a one-dimensional judgment such as bandwidth 
threshold for detecting abnormal network conditions may 
raise too many alarms. As a result, it is difficult to accurately 
monitor network conditions. Consequently, it is necessary to 
establish a monitoring system that detects network 
congestion or faults without generating too many alarms.  
III. 
PROPOSED METHOD FOR  MONITORING AND 
ANALYZING NETWORK TRAFFIC 
To address the issue described in the previous section, a 
novel network monitoring system—based on self-learning 
and multi-dimensional analysis (SLMDA) [3]—is proposed 
here. The system monitors all network flows in real time 
from dimensions such as bandwidth, packet size, and packet 
interval. It is composed of an analyzing part and a 
monitoring part equipped with a node called ―aggregated 
flow mining‖ (AFM) [4] implemented in each node. With 
regard to the analyzing part, a new evaluation scheme based 
on the multi-dimensional Mahalanobis distance [5] is applied.

A. Aggregated flow mining (AFM) 
When an administrator of a network monitors network-
traffic conditions, it is necessary to distinguish many 
network flows and analyze them in detail. For that purpose, 
AFM (which distinguishes many kinds of network flows and 
provides statistical information about those flows) is used. 
The network administrator finds anomalous flows or 
conditions (or both) by analyzing of statistical information 
provided by AFM. A flow is conventionally defined as a 
collection of packets with five tuples (source IP address, 
destination IP address, source port, destination port, and 
protocol). In regard to AFM, the concept of the flow is 
extended, and an ―aggregated flow‖ is defined by an 
arbitrary combination of each tuple. For example, one 
aggregated flow is defined by only the destination IP address 
irrespective the other tuples. Statistical information (such as 
number of packets and bytes) about flows that have the same 
destination IP address is therefore produced as statistics 
about one aggregated flow. As described above, if the 
concept of aggregated flow is introduced, flows that travel 
between one host and multiple servers are regarded as one 
aggregated flow. It is therefore possible to analyze network 
traffic or flows. 
B. Algorithm for self-learning multi-dimensional analysis 
Hereafter, the node at which ―integrated mining of flow‖ 
is performed is simply referred to as ―the IMF‖.  The 
proposed system for monitoring network-traffic flow is 
shown in Figure. 1 , where several users are connected to a 
data center. The IMF collects statistical information from 
multiple AFMs for analyzing network traffic and send 
alarms to a network-management server when it detects 
abnormal network conditions.

Figure. 1 Proposed monitoring system 
 
In this system, network traffic is analyzed by using 
statistical information gathered from all AFMs in the 
network. Specifically, SLMDA using the Mahalanobis 
distance is used to analyze network conditions in detail. 
Although the system uses the same analysis parameters 
originally implemented in the AFM, the proposed SLMDA 
method is applicable to various analysis parameters. This 
method follows the procedure described below: 
1. The standard distribution for each analysis parameter 
is defined. 
2. A Statistical distribution for each analysis parameter 
is measured by an AFM in real time. 
3. The 
Mahalanobis 
distance 
is 
calculated 
by 
comparing the distance between the defined standard 
distribution and the measured statistical distribution 
of each analysis parameter in real time, and the 
occurrence of abnormal network traffic conditions is 
judged. 
4. The standard distribution for each analysis parameter 
is updated by using the measured statistical 
distribution (step 2) in real time.   
5. If a rapid change of network traffic condition is 
detected, its cause is identified by analyzing the 
conditions in detail. 
6. Return to step 2. 
C. One-dimensional judgment based on Mahalanobis 
distance 
To detect an abnormal network condition, it is necessary 
to analyze the changes of network traffic (such as 
bandwidth) in detail. Accordingly, a method for determining 
whether the network condition changes is proposed here. 
This one-dimensional judgment method based on the 
Mahalanobis distance is explained in Figure. 2 .

Figure. 2 One-dimensional judgment based on Mahalanobis distance 
 
To analyse a rapid change of network-traffic distribution, 
it is necessary to define the standard distribution as a normal 
condition and compare that standard distribution and a 
statistical distribution measured by AFM. The comparison 
procedure is explained as follows. An initial value is set to 
define the standard distribution as a target for comparison 
with a measured distribution. As the parameters for 
comparison, average and standard deviation of the standard 
distribution are used. These parameters are set according to 
the administrator's experience or knowledge. To analyse a 
rapid change of network-traffic conditions, statistical 
information (such as data throughput) from the AFM of each 
router is measured in real time. Mahalanobis distance of the 
standard distribution is then calculated by using the 
48

throughput distribution measured by the AFM in real time. 
The Mahalanobis distance is defined as  
D=(x-average)/standard deviation   [a.u.: arbitrary unit] (1) 
If the Mahalanobis distance is very large, it is considered 
that an abnormal traffic condition exists. For example, if the 
calculated Mahalanobis distance is larger than 2 and the 
measured distribution follows a normal distribution, it is 
judged that the throughput distribution (namely, data 
rate/bandwidth of a traffic flow) is not significant according 
to a 5% significance level. As a result, it can be regarded as 
an unusual distribution that occurs at a probability of 5%.

If a one-dimensional judgement method is used to judge 
whether the measured network condition is normal or 
abnormal, an erroneous decision might occur frequently 
owing to the limited amount of information available for 
analyzing traffic flow. In the case that erroneous decisions 
occur, a management server may receive too many alerts, 
which might cause control errors. Accordingly, to improve 
the accuracy of the judgment, a multi-dimensional judgment 
method (as shown in Figure 3) is proposed here. This method 
involves several steps.  First, each analysis parameter is 
assigned to each axis in the figure as a dimension for 
analyzing 3D Mahalanobis distance. On each axis, 
Mahalanobis distance is calculated. Multi-dimensional 
Mahalanobis distances are then calculated on the basis of 
multiple one-dimensional distances as follows.  
Mahalanobis distance with three dimensions= 
sqrt(α*x2+β*y2+γ*z2)                                                  (2a) 
α+β+γ=3                                                                      (2b) 
α,β,γ is not unique because reasons of network fault are 
not always same. So It is necessary to investigate α,β,γ from 
past data and system condition. In this report each of α,β,γ 
values is 1. 
E. Updating standard distribution on the basis of feedback.  
To analyze a measured network-traffic condition, a 
standard distribution as a target for comparison should be 
defined correctly. However, it is not easy to define a normal 
network traffic condition that changes day by day. A new 
self-learning method, by which a normal standard 
distribution is dynamically updated by using feedback data, 
is therefore proposed here. Basically, the network-traffic 
condition is monitored, and its changes are analyzed in real 
time. The standard distribution is then updated according to 
the change of the average data value of a measured 
distribution.  
The example of a standard distribution updating method 
is shown in Figure 4. With the proposed method, average 
and standard deviation of the standard distribution are 
updated dynamically by calculating a moving average 
according to the following formula: 
Moving average of average on standard distribution= 
(average on standard distribution + average on measured 
distribution)/2                                                            (3a) 
Moving average of deviation= 
(deviation on standard distribution + deviation on measured 
distribution)/2                                                            (3b)

F. Detection of factors  for changing network condition 
Detection of factors that change a network condition is 
explained in Figure 6. The criterion for detecting an abnormal 
condition is as follows: 
average of standard distribution + two standard deviations <  
measured throughput of network flow                               (4)                                                                  
When a rapid change of a network-traffic condition is 
detected, a flow that is further than two sigmas from the 
average value of the standard distribution is considered as a 
peculiar flow. Although two standard deviations is set as the 
threshold for detecting a peculiar flow, the threshold is set by 
the administrator of a network. If the threshold is two 
standard deviations and the measured data distribution 
follows a normal distribution, this condition is equivalent to 
a significance level of 5%, and it only occurs at a probability 
of 5%. In addition, flows that cause such a condition are 
judged as peculiar flows.

IMPLEMENTATION OF PROTOTYPE TRAFFIC-
MONITORING   SYSTEM

Figure 8. Example of IMF GUI 
 
A block diagram of the IMF is shown in Figure 7. The IMF 
provides two functions (IMF core-engine service and AFM 
collector-engine service) for analyzing monitored data. The 
AFM collector engine service collects statistical information 
through a interface ( such as Ethernet ) and stores it in a 
database. The IMF core engine service then reads the 
statistical information from the database and analyzes it. If 
necessary, it sends an alert message to a network 
management server. 
The GUI of the IMF is shown in Figure 8. The IMF 
analyzes statistical data from the AFM and shows real-time 
conditions on the GUI. The network administrator can check 
the flow that is presumed to be the factor causing an 
abnormal condition and the time of occurrence, when the 
change of condition is detected on GUI.

To evaluate whether detect a rapid change of network 
traffic by an SLMDA-based function, network congestion 
(as a change of network condition) is focused on, and the 
SLMDA-based function for detecting it is verified. 
Specifically, to produce network congestion, user datagram 
protocol (UDP) traffic is intentionally generated under the 
condition that only transmission control protocol (TCP) 
traffic is present. A rapid change of the network-traffic 
condition is then generated since transmission rate of TCP is 
rapidly decreased when TCP detects network congestion. 
The Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) [6] (which 
enables network emulation) was used to produce the above-
described condition. The GUI screen of CORE, representing 
both conditions (before and after inserting UDP traffic), is 
shown in Figure 9. 
 An experiment to investigate traffic condition was 
performed by means of AFM. In the experiment, a rapid 
change of network condition is intentionally produced by 
inserting UDP traffic under the condition that only TCP 
traffic is flowing. As shown in Figure 9, multiple users 
connect to a data center by TCP communications. Network 
traffic via the router connected to data center A is monitored 
by the AFM. A user (IP:10.0.1.20) connects to data center A 
for a certain period by UDP communication. TCP controls 
the window size for data transmission when it detects 
congestion. On the other hand, UDP does not control 
transmission rate. Therefore, when UDP traffic is inserted 
into the TCP traffic, UDP traffic occupies most of the 
network link. As shown on the right of Figure 9, when UDP 
traffic is generated, the traffic (IP:10.0.1.20) occupies most 
of the network link. The throughput measured by AFM is 
shown in Figure 10. As shown in area A in the figure, a rapid 
change of network condition occurred at 15:55:20. Average 
throughput is not high until 15:55:20, since only multiple 
TCP communications share the network link. However, the 
average throughput increases rapidly, since a UDP 
communication occupies the network link from 15:55:20. As 
shown in Figure 11, a significant change of network-traffic 
condition is detected at 15:55:20, since the Mahalanobis 
distance is over 2 at 15:55:20. It is thus possible to detect 
abnormal traffic conditions that the network administrator 
cannot recognize by a conventional method. Moreover, the 
IMF could detect the UDP flow (IP:10.0.1.20) as a potential 
factor for causing a significant change of network condition.  
The network administrator can therefore easily find the 
factors causing significant changes in network condition and 
take appropriate measures for handling them by using the 
following information produced by IMF.

B. Experiment on intranet 
The purpose of this experiment (see concept shown in 
Figure 12) is to verify whether the proposed method can detect 
a significant change of network-traffic condition on a real 
intranet. In the experiment, real intranet traffic was measured 
for one day by AFM. The bandwidth of the link used for the 
experiment was 100 Mbit/s. Four parameters (throughput, 
average packet size, link throughput, and data volume) were 
used as parameters in this evaluation. The results of the 
evaluation from AM0:00 to AM9:00 are shown in Figure 13 
to Figure 21.

As shown in Figure 13, many flows have high throughput. 
It is therefore difficult to pinpoint in the figure whether a 
significant change of 
network-traffic 
condition 
was 
generated or not. On the contrary, in Figure 14, with the 
proposed method, significant changes of network-traffic 
condition are judged to occur two or more times. In the time 
zone when the Mahalanobis distance is over 2, namely, from 
area A to area C in the figure, traffic rapidly decreases and 
stays low for a short time. After that time, the traffic rapidly 
increases again. It is concluded that the proposed scheme 
could detect such significant changes of network-traffic 
condition. 
The average packet size is shown in Figure 15, and 
calculated Mahalanobis distance that corresponds to average 
packet size is shown in Figure 16. As shown in Figure 15, 
average packet size does significantly not deviate from an 
average of 500 bytes. However, in Figure 16, two points 
(shown in area D and area E in the figure) are detected as 
significant changes of average packet size. The significant 
change of network-traffic condition is therefore detected 
according to average packet size. The times at which packet-
size changes are detected are equivalent to the times at which 
throughput are detected in Figure 14. (Area-A,Area-B)

Figure 21. Mahalanobis distance with three dimensions 
The measured link throughput is shown in Figure 17, and 
the calculated Mahalanobis distance with the link throughput 
is shown in Figure 18. It is difficult to pinpoint from Figure 
17 the points at which a significant change of network-traffic 
condition was generated. On the other hand, significant 
changes are detected two or more times in Figure 18. 
However, there is no commonality between the detected 
changes in Figure 17 and the previously detected changes in 
Figures 14 and 16.  
The measured data volume is shown in Figure 19. As 
shown from area F to area I in the figure, data volume rises 
rapidly in a certain time zone. Moreover, significant changes 
of network-traffic condition (i.e., data volume) were detected 
two or more times. The times of the change in data volume 
shown in Figure 19 is almost equivalent to those of the 
change in Mahalanobis distance shown in Figure 20. It is 
concluded that server data on the intranet should be backed-
up at these times.  
The calculated Mahalanobis distance converted into three 
dimensions is shown in Figure 21. In the calculation, three-
dimensional data are selected from four types of monitored 
data (Throughput per flow, Packet size, Link throughput, 
data volume). This result bases on formula (2a) and (2b). 
Each of α,β,γ value used in this experiment is 1. α,β,γ can’t 
be decided from theory because reasons of network fault are 
not always same and abnormal condition depends on system 
condition. So α,β,γ must be decided from past data and 
system condition, administrator experience. Currently how to 
decide α,β,γ is an issue in the future. Self-learning method 
could be used to decide those parameters.  
The following focuses on from AM2:24 to AM4:48. As a 
result of setting the threshold to 80 Mbit/s and analyzing 
intranet traffic, the number of alarms exceeding the threshold 
value was detected 54 times in Figure 13. On the other hand, 
as shown in Figure 14, by proposed method, the number of 
alarms detected the significant changes of network- traffic 
condition is four times. Consequently, it is possible to reduce 
the number of alerts by 92%. Moreover, the one-dimensional 
judgment method was used to the four types of monitored 
data and the number of alarms exceeding the threshold value 
with Mahalanobis distance greater than the threshold of two 
is 14 times as sum of alarms with the four types of monitored 
data. When my proposed method was judged by the three-
dimensional Mahalanobis distance, it was seven times, and 
the alarm decreases by half compared to one-dimensional 
judgment method. As a whole, the proposed method can 
reduce the number of alarms by 96% compared to one-
dimensional judgment method.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 
A new network-monitoring system based on self-learning 
and multi-dimensional analysis (SLMDA) using the 
Mahalanobis distance was proposed. This system detects a 
significant change of network traffic. It uses Mahalanobis 
distance converted to multiple dimensions between standard 
distribution and measured distribution in real time. If the 
distance is larger than two standard deviations of standard 
distribution, the system judges that the monitored condition 
is abnormal.  The system can therefore detect a rapid change 
of network traffic condition. A prototype network-
monitoring system was developed and evaluated, When user 
datagram protocol (UDP) traffic is intentionally generated 
under the condition that only transmission control protocol 
(TCP) traffic is present even if the whole consumed 
bandwidth is not changed. As a result, the system could 
detect a significant change of network traffic. In addition to 
using real traffic, the system can reduce the number of 
unnecessary alerts by about 96% when throughput is 
fluctuating at normal rate of bandwidth consumption near a 
predefined threshold.  As for future work, the proposed 
monitoring system will be extended to large-scale networks, 
and its performance will be evaluated.
