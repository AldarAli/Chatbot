Abstract - Wireless Sensor Networks are composed of resource-
constrained devices and are used in critical monitoring and 
tracking applications. Therefore, routing protocols for such 
networks should take into consideration the trustworthiness of 
and the energy available on sensor nodes. We developed TER - 
Trust and Energy-aware Routing protocol, a location-based, 
trust and energy-aware, routing protocol for Wireless Sensor 
Networks.  The protocol uses distance, trust and energy as 
metrics when choosing the best path towards the destination. 
The protocol can be easily extended to support other metrics. 
We implemented our protocol in TinyOS and tested it in 
several test configurations. We determined experimentally that 
TER provides traffic load and energy balancing while building 
trustworthy paths.

 INTRODUCTION 
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) represent an 
innovative 
technology 
used 
for 
monitoring 
specific 
environments. A WSN is composed of tens to thousands of 
sensor nodes, which are low-power, low-cost, small, 
resource-constrained devices. The sensor nodes collaborate 
in order to detect events that take place in the monitored 
environment and send relevant data to one or more base 
stations [1].  
WSNs are used in critical applications like military 
surveillance, homeland security and medical monitoring, 
and, in these cases, protecting the network against malicious 
attacks 
is 
crucial. 
However, 
WSNs 
have 
unique 
characteristics: wireless transmission medium, limited 
resources available on sensor nodes, hostile environment, ad-
hoc deployment, unreliable communication, and unattended 
operation. Therefore, protocols for critical sensor networks 
should be designed with security in mind, while taking into 
consideration their specific constraints and challenges.   
For large sensor networks, multi-hop communication is 
more energy-efficient than single-hop communication. A 
routing protocol is used for assuring packet delivery and 
most network traffic has a many-to-one pattern because all 
nodes send data packets towards the base station.  
Most routing protocols for sensor networks use a single 
metric to determine the best path to destination. Some use 
two metrics such as location and energy [2], [3], location and 
trust [4], or trust and link quality [5]. We identify a need for 
a routing framework that can be easily extended to support 
any metric.    
In this paper, we propose a trust and energy-aware, 
location-based routing protocol called Trust and Energy-
aware Routing (TER) protocol. TER uses trust values, 
energy levels and location information in order to determine 
the best paths towards a destination. The protocol achieves 
balancing of traffic load and energy, and generates 
trustworthy paths when taking into consideration all 
proposed metrics. Other metrics can be easily integrated in 
the protocol.   
The protocol relies on the trust values provided by the 
Adaptive Trust Management Protocol (ATMP), which 
computes trust based on intrusion detection techniques [6]. 
However, TER can also use trust and reputation data 
provided by other trust management mechanisms.  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section II 
presents related work, Section III describes the protocol 
design, Section IV includes implementation details, Section 
V presents the experimental evaluation, and Section VI 
discusses conclusions and future work.

RELATED WORK 
Based on the network structure, routing in Wireless 
Sensor Networks can be classified in flat-based, hierarchical-
based and location-based routing [7]. Based on protocol 
operation, routing protocols can be classified in multi-path 
based, query-based, negotiation-based, QoS-based and 
coherent-based routing protocols. 
Location-based routing protocols compute routing paths 
based on the location of nodes. Well known location-based 
protocols are: Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) [2] and 
Geographic and Energy Aware Routing (GEAR) [3]. 
Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) is an energy-aware, 
location-based routing algorithm [2]. Location information is 
used by each node to associate itself to a virtual grid. Nodes 
in the same grid square are equivalent in regard to packet 
forwarding and take turns in sleeping and being awake in 
order to load balance energy consumption. GAF relies on an 
underlying ad hoc routing protocol.  
Geographic and Energy Aware Routing (GEAR) is an 
energy-aware and location based routing protocol [3]. The 
protocol selects the neighbor using an energy-aware and 
geographically informed algorithm to forward the packet 
towards the target region. Then, it uses a recursive 
geographical forwarding technique for disseminating the 
packet in the target region.  
Two relevant routing protocols, which take into 
consideration trust values when determining the path to the

destination are elaborated in TRAP [4] and Zahariadis et al. 
[5]. 
TRAP is a trust-aware routing protocol, which represents 
a component of µRACER routing solution for Wireless 
Sensor 
Networks 
[4]. 
Each 
node 
considers 
the 
communication context when choosing the next hop. The 
communication context includes the past behavior of 
neighbor nodes and the quality of the links between the local 
node and the neighbors.  
Zahariadis et al. propose the integration of a trust model 
with a location-based routing protocol [5]. A metric is 
computed using the distance of the neighbor node to the 
destination and the trust in the neighbor node. Therefore, the 
metric is maximized for trustworthy neighbors closer to the 
destination.  
Our protocol is a location-based routing protocol, 
because it uses the location of neighbor nodes for 
determining the best path towards the destination. However, 
TER also considers trust and energy when determining the 
best next hop. In addition, the protocol uses trust values to 
determine whether to forward packets from specific nodes. 
III. 
 PROTOCOL DESIGN 
In Wireless Sensor Networks, most network traffic is 
upstream traffic, with a many-to-one communication pattern 
because all packets must reach the base station. In this paper, 
we develop a method for performing trustworthy routing of 
upstream traffic.  
Trust and Energy-aware Routing (TER) is a trust and 
energy-aware, location-based routing protocol for Wireless 
Sensor Networks.  The trust values are obtained from 
Adaptive Trust Management Protocol (ATMP), which 
computes them based on intrusion detection techniques [6]. 
We use an extended version of ATMP, which delivers 
energy and location data along with the trust associations.  
TER includes two phases: setup and forwarding. In the 
first phase, the best next hop towards the base station is 
selected by taking into consideration several factors, such as 
trust, energy and location. In the second phase, the packets 
generated by trustworthy nodes are forwarded using the 
selected next hop. 
A.  
Assumptions and Notations 
A WSN can be represented as a graph, like in Formulas 
1, 2 and 3, where Ni are vertices which represent nodes in the 
sensor network and {Ni, Nj} are edges which represent that 
two sensor nodes can communicate with each other directly.

The sensor network may be placed in a harsh 
environment and operate unattended. An attacker may have 
physical access to the nodes and can compromise them. 
We assume that each node knows its location and how 
much energy it has consumed at any moment. The 
localization algorithm or technology used for obtaining the 
location is out of scope for this paper.  
We also assume that the Base Station (BS) has a fixed 
location. Each node knows the location of the BS. This 
information is distributed to all sensor nodes, during network 
initialization, along with the shared keys.  
The TER assumes that ATMP is extended to send energy 
and location information along with the trust associations. 
Therefore, ATMP periodically sends update packets 
containing the trust associations, the consumed energy and 
location of the local node (the node sending the updates).  
The trust associations (TA) are represented in Formula 5. 
It includes associations between the neighbors of the local 
node (ni) and direct trust values (Ti) [6].

ATMP takes the trust associations received from multiple 
neighbors and computes a final trust value. This value has a 
historical component (Told), a direct (Td) and an indirect 
component (Ti), as in Formula  7. The weights are allocated 
in regard to Formula 8. The final trust (Tnew) is used in TER 
when computing the cost.

The update packets are authenticated using a broadcast 
authentication mechanism such as µTESLA [8] in order to 
prevent malicious updates.  
We assume that the parameters of TER and ATMP 
(weights, limits) can be modified during run-time through 
generic reconfiguration mechanisms.  
The Setup Phase if performed periodically in order to 
update the costs. The period depends on the number of 
nodes, 
topology, 
mobility, 
application 
and 
security 
requirements. A large, dense network with mobile nodes, or 
a network exposed to threats should execute the Setup phase 
more often.

B. Setup Phase 
In the Setup Phase, each node computes a cost for each 
of its neighbors. The neighbor with the lowest cost is 
subsequently chosen as the next hop on the route to the BS. 
The cost takes into consideration the trust value provided 
by ATMP, the energy level available on the neighbor node, 
the distance from the local node to the neighbor node, and 
the distance from the neighbor node to the base station. 
The cost for a neighbor node N is computed using 
Formula 10, where DT is the degree of distrust in the 
neighbor node N normalized by the largest distrust among all 
neighbors, E is the consumed energy of node N normalized 
by the largest consumed energy among all neighbors, DN 
represents the distance from the local node to node N 
normalized by the largest distance, DB represents the 
distance between N and the BS, normalized by the largest 
distance, and weights are allocated in regard to Formula 11.

The distrust (dt) is computed from the trust value 
generated by the ATMP (Formula 7) in regard to a specific 
neighbor, using Formula 12. In this formula, T signifies the 
trust value and MaxTrust is the maximum value for the trust 
parameter. The normalized value of distrust (DT) is 
computed and used in Formula 10.

The distance to a neighbor (dn) is computed using the 
coordinates of the local node and the ones of the neighbor

of the local node, xN and yN are the coordinates of the 
neighbor node N. The distance is normalized (DN) and used 
when computing the cost.

In the same manner, the distance from the neighbor node

In the Setup Phase, the node computes the cost for each

hop, where Nj is the neighbor node with the minimum cost, 
and nb is the number of neighbors.

Forwarding Phase 
In the Forwarding Phase, the node receives packets and 
forwards them towards the base station only if they are 
trustworthy. The trustworthiness of a packet is determined 
using Formula 16, where T is the trust in source node SN, 
TL is the minimum allowable trust limit and MAC is the 
Message Authentication Node.

If the packet cannot be authenticated (MAC) or if the 
source node has a trust value lower than the trust limit (TL), 
the packet is considered untrustworthy.  
D. Design considerations 
Most applications that use WSNs do not require reliable 
delivery. The use of acknowledgement considerably 
increases energy consumption. Therefore, we do not include 
an acknowledgement mechanism in TER. However, if the 
application does not tolerate packet loss, acknowledgements 
are easy to integrate with our protocol. 
Duplicate detection is necessary in the case of routing 
loops. However, in order to detect duplicates, information 
about each packet has to be stored on the nodes. This has a 
considerable impact on memory usage. If the application 
requires duplicate detection, TER can be easily extended to 
support such feature. 
IV. 
IMPLEMENTATION 
The protocol has been developed in TinyOS [9], within a 
layer in the communication stack, between the Active 
Message and the Application layers. A nesC [10] component 
has been used for implementing the two phases of TER. 
Because TinyOS is an event-based operating system, 
code is executed only when an event takes place. We have 
three types of events in TER: receive trust, location and 
energy data from ATMP, trigger timer, and receive packet. 
The flow of operations for the three types of events is 
represented in Figure 1.

The TER component communicates with the ATMP 
component through an interface, in order to receive trust, 
energy and location information regarding the neighbor 
nodes.  The ATMP component sends the data through a nesC 
event when it has obtained trust, energy and location 
information. The information is stored by the TER 
component. 
A timer is used for periodically computing the cost using 
the information received from the ATMP component, 
according to Formula 10. The component determines the 
neighbor with the lowest cost and stores the identifier of the 
neighbor as next hop. 
When a packet is received, the first step is to validate the 
MAC. If the MAC is invalid, the packet is considered 
untrustworthy and discarded. If the MAC is valid, the trust 
value for the source node is verified. If the trust value is 
below a certain accepted limit, the packet is considered 
untrustworthy and dropped. If the MAC is valid and the trust 
is above the accepted limit, the packet is forwarded trough 
the next hop.  
V. 
EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION 
The protocol has been evaluated experimentally using 
TOSSIM, a simulator for TinyOS [11]. TOSSIM captures 
the behavior of a large number of nodes at network bit 
granularity. Therefore, it is a reliable tool for evaluating the 
behavior of TER enabled nodes in different test cases. 
We want to test our protocol in a realistic environment, in 
order to make sure it operates properly even in harsh 
conditions. We have therefore used TOSSIM to model an 
environment with interferences and signal attenuation, which 
causes a considerable amount of packet loss (30%) specific 
to harsh environments. The probability of packet loss is 
increased with the number of hops between source and 
destination. Therefore, longer paths cause a lower delivery 
rate. 
The test scenario involves a network topology of 10 
nodes and the Base Station (Node 0), as in Figure 2. For the 
analysis, we isolate the flow of packets generated by Node 7 
destined to the Base Station.   
 
Figure 2.   Scenario Topology 
We analyze the behavior of TER in different test 
configurations - with different values for weights α, β, γ and 
δ. Table 1 includes the analyzed configurations and the 
values for the considered weights.

We vary the weights from Formula 10 in order to 
determine the best routing behavior for the proposed 
scenario. This behavior is evaluated in regard to the number 
of packets routed through suspicious nodes and to energy 
consumption.  
In Configuration 1, only the distance from the neighbor 
to the destination is considered, therefore the neighbor which 
is closer to the destination has the lowest cost.  In 
Configuration 2, only trust is considered: the most 
trustworthy neighbor has the lowest cost. The first 2 
configurations serve as benchmarks in order to determine the 
influence of a single metric on the packet flow.  
The next 3 configurations take in consideration all the 
proposed metrics and they can be used to determine the most 
appropriate routing behavior for a specific situation. In 
Configuration 3, trust, energy and distance to BS have equal 
weights while the distance to neighbor has a lower weight. In 
Configuration 4, trust has highest weight, then energy and 
distance to BS, while the distance to neighbor has the lowest 
weight. Configuration 5 is similar to Configuration 4 but the 
energy has the highest weight. 
We evaluate the routing behavior of sensor nodes by 
considering a particular scenario with two suspicious nodes: 
the trust in Node 4 is 60%, the trust in Node 10 is 40%, the 
Trust Limit is 50%, and the Suspicious Limit is 80%. This 
implies that Node 10 sends untrustworthy packets, which 
will not be forwarded by other nodes. 
For each configuration specified in Table 1, we evaluate 
the routing behavior when delivering a large number of 
packets generated by Node 7 and destined to the BS. We ran 
each test 20 times and computed the average values for 
routed packets and energy consumption, for each considered 
configuration. 
A. Routed Packets 
A way of evaluating routing behavior is through the 
number of packets routed by each node. From the results, we 
can determine which are the most used paths for each 
configuration, and whether the suspicious nodes are 
effectively avoided.  
The number of routed packets per node, in each 
configuration, is represented in Figure 3. An average number 
of 370 packets are sent by the source node 7, as it can be 
observed in the figure. 
For Configuration 1, all packets take the route [7, 4, 1, 0]. 
This is the best path when taking in consideration the 
distance between the neighbor and the destination. An 
391

ICWMC 2012 : The Eighth International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Communications

average number of 334.6 packets are delivered through 
suspicious node 4 (all packets which are not lost on the link 
between Node 7 and Node 4), but no packet is delivered 
through suspicious node 10. For this specific topology, the 
algorithm chooses an efficient path but routes through an 
untrustworthy node.  
In Configuration 2, all packets follow the route [7, 6, 3, 1, 
0], the first best path when taking into consideration the trust 
values. No packet is delivered through the suspicious nodes. 
For this specific topology, all packets, which are not lost 
during transmission, reach the base station. This is because 
the algorithm chooses the first trustworthy next-hop which 
happens to be placed in the direction of the base station. In 
other topologies, it is possible that the algorithm does not 
pick a neighbor in the right direction; in such a case, the 
paths would be longer and more packets would be lost 
during transmission.  
Because of the greedy algorithm implemented by TER, 
trust or energy cannot be used as single metric when 
computing the cost.  Therefore, it is better to use these 
metrics in combination with location.  
In Configuration 3, the traffic load is more balanced. The 
paths that are used for packet delivery are: [7, 8, 5, 2, 0], [7, 
6, 4, 1, 0], [7, 6, 3, 1, 0], [7, 8, 9, 5, 2, 0]. The average 
number of packets delivered through node 4 is 0.65, which is 
very low. No packets are sent through suspicious node 10. 
The configuration provides a very good load balancing, as it 
uses 4 paths to the destination and a very small number of 
packets are delivered through suspicious nodes.

Figure 3.  Routed Packets per Node 
In Configuration 4, packets are delivered through paths: 
[7, 8, 5, 2, 0], [7, 6, 3, 1, 0], [7, 8, 9, 5, 2, 0]. No packet is 
delivered through suspicious nodes 4 and 10. A good load 
balancing is assured in this configuration and suspicious 
nodes are avoided. 
In Configuration 5, several paths are used for packet 
delivery: [7, 8, 5, 2, 0], [7, 6, 3, 1, 0], [7, 8, 9, 5, 2, 0]. Some 
routing loops are generated: [7, 10, 8], [7, 4, 5, 9, 8]. The 
average number of routed packets through node 4 is 1.65 and 
through node 10 is 3. The configuration has a good load 
balancing but it may produce routing loops and a small 
number of packets are delivered through suspicious nodes. 
When analyzing the packets’ paths, we determine that 
Configurations 3 and 4 are the best for this scenario because 
they have good load balancing, do not create routing loops, 
and avoid suspicious nodes.  
B. Energy consumption 
Another way of evaluating routing behavior is the energy 
consumed while routing data packets. We wish to determine 
whether energy consumption is well balanced between the 
nodes. The energy metric has an important role in balancing 
consumption. Without the energy metric, the packets would 
take the same path and deplete the energy of the nodes on 
that path. 
We evaluate the energy consumption necessary for 
routing 300 packets generated by Node 7 and destined to the 
BS. The energy consumed with routing data packets towards 
the destination, on every node, in each configuration, is 
represented in Figure 4. The values are represented in Joules. 
A sensor node has two alkaline AA batteries, each with 9360 
J energy. Most energy is consumed with sending and 
receiving packets. Amiri determined experimentally that a 
byte sent or received by CC2420 radio consumes 0.12mJ 
[12].   
From Figure 4, we can determine whether energy 
consumption is balanced between the nodes and if suspicious 
nodes have been avoided.

to packet delivery. Node 7 and node 0 have lower energy 
consumption than nodes 4 and 1 because they either only 
transmit or only receive data packets. The energy 
consumption on nodes 4 and 1 doubles because they transmit 
and receive packets. Overall, the configuration does not have 
a balanced energy consumption and routes through 
suspicious nodes.   
In Configuration 2, the suspicious node is avoided, but 
energy consumption is still not so well balanced, because 
nodes 2, 5, 8 and 9 are not delivering any packets. The 
energy consumption drops from 1.74 J on node 4, to 1.55 J 
on node 3 and to 1.39 J on node 1 because of packet loss.  
Packets are lost during transmission, so less packets are 
routed by the subsequent nodes. 
In Configurations 3 and 4, energy consumption is well 
balanced in the network and there is no energy consumption 
on the suspicious nodes. Configuration 5 is also well 
balanced and has low energy consumption on the suspicious 
nodes. These 3 configurations are the best from the point of 
view of balancing energy consumption due to data packet 
delivery. 
The total energy, consumed on all nodes while delivering 
300 data packets generated by Node 7, is represented in 
Figure 5. The least energy is consumed in Configuration 1 
because the protocol determines the shortest path to the 
destination. Similar energy consumptions have been 
determined for configurations 3, 4, and 5, which try to 
determine the shortest path while avoiding suspicious nodes 
and balancing energy consumption. Configuration 2 has 
lower energy consumption but it is not well balanced 
throughout the network.

Figure 5.  Total Energy Consumption  
The energy metric imposes an energy cost but at the 
same time it allows for a good balancing of energy 
consumption (see Figure 4), which is an important aspect for 
Wireless Sensor Networks. The energy metric is particularly 
important if there is no redundancy among nodes concerning 
the transmitted information, and therefore we aim to avoid 
the energy depletion of the nodes which may be preferred by 
the routing protocol due to their position. 
C. Discussion 
Configuration 1 does not take into consideration neither 
energy nor trust, including only the distance from the 
neighbor to the base station. Therefore, it may route packets 
through nodes which are untrustworthy or have low energy. 
It only guarantees that it chooses the shortest path towards 
the destination, as it was observed experimentally. The 
shortest path consumes the least total energy on sensor nodes 
but it does not avoid nodes with low power. If the nodes are 
not mobile, the path is used until some of the nodes die and 
another path has to be chosen. On the long term, this strategy 
may 
determine 
the 
partitioning 
the 
network. 
This 
configuration does not provide load balancing of traffic, is 
not trustworthy and does not have a balanced energy 
consumption.   
Although Configuration 2 generates trustworthy paths, 
these paths can be long and inefficient in some cases because 
the algorithm does not take location into consideration. The 
only guarantee is that it chooses trustworthy paths. If nodes 
are not mobile and if the trust values do not change, the 
algorithm chooses the same path and it consumes all nodes’ 
energy on the path. It does not provide load balancing, it 
does not guarantee that an efficient path is chosen, and it 
does not balance energy consumption. 
Configuration 3 has a very good load balancing of 
network traffic, delivers a small number of packets through 
suspicious nodes and balances energy consumption.  
Configuration 4 performs load balancing of network 
traffic, selects trustworthy and short paths, and balances 
energy consumption on sensor nodes. Trust has a greater 
weight and this explains the minimum amount of packets 
routed through suspicious nodes.   
Configuration 5 performs load balancing for network 
traffic, balances energy consumption, but routes through 
suspicious nodes, and generates routing loops. 
The last three configurations have similar total energy 
consumption, provide load balancing of traffic, balancing of 
energy consumption, and they avoid suspicious nodes. From 
these configurations, Configuration 3 is preferable insofar it 
has the best load balancing of network traffic and 
Configuration 4 is preferable insofar it has the minimum 
number of packets delivered through suspicious nodes. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Wireless Sensor Networks that are used for deploying 
critical applications such as military surveillance or medical 
monitoring should provide a high level of security and 
trustworthiness. Therefore, routing protocols for WSNs 
should to be designed with security in mind, taking into 
account multiple metrics that support network availability.  
We developed Trust and Energy-aware Routing protocol, 
which is a location-based, trust and energy-aware routing 
protocol for sensor networks. The protocol is based on the

Adaptive Trust Management Protocol, which computes trust 
values based on node behavior.  
The protocol uses several metrics:  trust values, energy 
levels, the distance between the local and the neighbor node 
and the distance between the neighbor node and the 
destination. These metrics may have different weights when 
computing the cost of routing a packet through a specific 
neighbor. The cost is computed based on the metrics and 
their weights. The neighbor with the lowest cost is chosen as 
next hop towards the base station.  
Trust and Energy-aware Routing protocol has two 
phases: the Setup and the Forwarding phase. In the Setup 
phase, the next hop is determined, and in the Forwarding 
phase, the packets generated by a trustworthy source are 
forwarded and the others are dropped.  
We have implemented the protocol in TinyOS and we 
have evaluated it experimentally using TOSSIM, comparing 
5 protocol configurations for the same scenario. Each 
configuration has different weights for the trust, energy and 
distance metrics.  For each configuration, the routing 
behavior has been examined in regard to the paths and 
packets routed through each node, the consumed energy, and 
the effectiveness of packet delivery.   
 Traffic load and energy balancing are very important in 
Wireless Sensor Networks. In relation to other routing 
protocols, TER achieves a good balancing of load and 
energy and generates trustworthy paths, when taking into 
consideration all proposed metrics: trust, energy and 
distance. 
As future work, we plan to extend the protocol to include 
other metrics, such as link quality, and to support adaptive 
weights, allowing, for example, the weight for energy to 
increase over time. Other extensions we want to implement 
are duplicate detection and acknowledgements.  
We also want to integrate our protocol with another trust 
mechanism. In addition, we wish to evaluate the protocol in a 
larger, real-world network.
