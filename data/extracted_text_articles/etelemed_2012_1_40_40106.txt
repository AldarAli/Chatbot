Abstract— Though the application of telecommunication 
technology for rehabilitation of aphasic patients has been 
proposed as an appropriate mode for the delivery of speech 
and language services in general and for aphasic patients in 
particular, systematic research into the delivery of therapy via 
telerehabilitation (TR) is limited. The present study attempts 
to fill this gap by comparing the effects of TR to the effects of a 
conventional face-to-face (FtF) therapy. Eight patients with 
aphasia participated in a within-subject case study design 
(ABAC/ACAB). Patients received a 14-session block of TR at 
their homes via a custom-made Internet server, as well as a 14-
session block of conventional FtF treatment in the clinic. Each 
patient was evaluated four times, before and after each of the 
two series of therapy. Patients also completed self-reported 
satisfaction questionnaires regarding the two treatment modes. 
All participants benefited from therapy, regardless of therapy 
mode. There was no significant difference in the effect of 
therapy on most measures in the formal assessment, as well as 
on the satisfaction measures. When a significant difference was 
found between the two treatment modes, TR was found to be 
more beneficial. Our results provide evidence that TR is not 
only feasible and suitable for the treatment of aphasic patients 
but that it may also be as effective as FtF therapy. Despite the 
promising results of the present study, future research is 
required in order to investigate the effect of TR in populations 
with more diverse speech and language disorders.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Telerehabilitation (TR) is a branch of telemedicine, in 
which health services are delivered to patients from a 
distance 
through 
information 
technology 
and 
telecommunication systems. The main motivation for 
developing telemedicine in general and TR in particular was 
to offer accessible treatment to individuals who live 
relatively far from health centers, in geographically remote 
regions, as well as to individuals with physical disability for 
whom travel is difficult [9][13]. The earliest reports on 
treatment of speech and language disorders from a distance 
appeared in the 1980s. Since then, service delivery has been 
examined with the use of technologies such as telephone, 
television, computers, and satellite [1]. In the last decade, 
technological developments have enabled the use of 
videoconferences 
and 
internet-based 
features 
[1][2]. 
According to a recent review by Mashima and Doarn [9], 
these developments led to the implementation of tele-
services in various areas within the speech language and 
hearing therapy. For instance, TR was examined as part of 
treatment 
of 
swallowing 
disorders, 
voice 
disorders, 
stuttering, and speech disorders in individuals with 
Parkinson's disease, cleft palate, autism, and hearing 
impairment. 
Technologically-based rehabilitation of individuals with 
brain damage has great potential. Yet, this potential has to be 
established through careful research. It is important to study

the feasibility and effectiveness of both assessment and 
treatment from a distance. One of the main questions with 
which researchers have been concerned is whether 
assessment of language and speech disorders following brain 
damage could be as reliable as face-to-face assessment. 
Brennan et al. [3] and Gerogeadis et al. [4] reported that 
when using a picture description task, no difference was 
found between assessment from a distance through 
computer-based videoconference and conventional FtF 
assessment.   
 Further analysis that looked at the effects of background 
variables of age, gender, education level, and experience 
with technology on TR and FtF treatments revealed no 
significant differences between linguistic performances in 
either environment for TBI patients [3]. In addition, Palsbo 
[10] administered a more comprehensive assessment of 
functional communication, using three subtests from the 
Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination [5]. In this study, 
very high levels of agreement were recorded between stand-
alone videoconference and FtF assessment.  
 
Though these results were encouraging, the study did not 
control for impairment severity and type of communication 
disorder. In a later study, Hill et al. [6] showed that aphasia 
severity had little effect on assessment accuracy for the 
majority of tests.  
  
The feasibility and reliability of technologically 
governed assessment from a distance are very important for 
planning and monitoring speech and language therapy 
programs. However, it is not enough to examine assessment 
if treatment is to be evaluated. There is some evidence 
regarding TR for people who suffer from voice disorders [8] 
as well as for people suffering from speech disorders in 
Parkinson's disease [12]. These studies used both objective 
measures and self-report to examine the efficacy of 
treatment. They documented no difference in outcome 
measures between patients treated via TR technology and 
those treated through conventional therapy. 
Nonetheless, it is unclear whether the results of treatment 
to one population can be generalized to treatment of another 
population, especially when aphasia patients are concerned. 
If the goal is to develop and implement a TR protocol to 
aphasia patients, it is important to show that the mode of 
therapy delivery is not only feasible but that it is as effective 
as the traditional FtF therapy. Such research might promote 
the use of TR as the treatment of choice, and might help in 
allocating insurance funding to this line of treatment. 
 
Thus, the present study aims at establishing the 
feasibility and effectiveness of TR to patients with aphasia. 
The study compares the outcome of speech and language 
therapy provided through both TR and FtF modes. The two 
treatment modes will be compared through both objective 
measures, mainly the change in scores in formal tests, and 
subjective measures that included self reported satisfaction. 
Our main question was whether TR via the Internet could be 
as efficient as is conventional FtF therapy.  
 
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: 
Section II describes the research method. Section III 
introduces the results of the comparisons between the two 
modes of therapy. First, we present scores on the objective 
assessment battery and then we present scores on the 
satisfaction questionnaires. Finally, Section IV presents the 
main conclusions of the study.

METHOD 
Participants: Eight native Hebrew speaking individuals 
with aphasia participated in the study. Table 1 presents 
background characteristics of these patients. All participants 
were right handed with at least 11 years of education, 
between age 46 and age 72. They all suffered a single left 
cerebrovascular accident (CVA), most of them in the 
distribution of the middle cerebral artery. Lesions were 
confirmed by CT or MRI scans. Participants were 4-50 
months post CVA. They all passed an audiometric hearing 
screening test that demonstrated normal hearing levels         
(< 35db HL 500-4000Hz). 
 The diagnosis of aphasia was determined on the basis of 
the Hebrew version of the Western Aphasia Battery [7][11]. 
Five participants were diagnosed with Anomic Aphasia, two 
participants were diagnosed with Conduction Aphasia and 
one was diagnosed with Broca's Aphasia. The WAB Aphasia 
Quotient at study entry ranged between 12.6 and 91, with a 
mean of 68.5 (SD = 24.14).  
Study design: The study used a within-subject case 
study design (ABAC/ACAB). All eight participants received 
two types of treatment (TR and FtF). Each type of treatment 
included 14 therapy sessions that took place twice to three

times a week. There was a six-week recess in between the 
two types of treatments to minimize the effect that the first 
treatment could have on the results of the next treatment. 
Four participants received TR first and then FtF (hereafter 
Group 1) and the other four participants received FtF first 
and then TR (hereafter Group 2). Each patient was evaluated 
four times, before and after each of the two series of therapy 
sessions (that is, before and after TR, before and after FtF). 
Assessment: An independent clinician who did not 
provide therapy to a given patient evaluated him or her. The 
assessment was conducted in two sessions and included the 
Hebrew version of the Western Aphasia Battery [7][11], 
commonly used to diagnose aphasic syndrome and severity. 
For each patient a measure of Aphasia Quotient (AQ) was 
calculated as a summary of scores of the oral language 
subtests of the WAB: spontaneous speech (content and 
fluency), auditory comprehension, repetition, and naming. 
AQ scores can range from 0 up to 100, with 100 representing 
intact abilities.   
In addition, an assessment of the participant's satisfaction 
with the therapy process was conducted at the end of each 
session series, using structured questionnaires designed for 
each type of treatment. Both questionnaires consisted of 13 
identical questions. Following the TR session series, the 
questionnaire contained the same 13 questions plus five 
additional questions that focused on technical aspects. The 
questionnaires 
included 
both 
positive 
and 
negative 
statements about the treatment. Each patient was asked to 
specify his/her level of agreement with each statement, on a 
1-4 scale. For example, the patients were asked to state their 
level of agreement with statements such as: "Using a 
computer for treatment is easy”, “The treatment was 
stressful", "I was happy with the interaction I had with the 
clinician during the treatment”. 
In addition, six weeks following the completion of the 
second treatment series, each patient was requested to fill a 
questionnaire that contained 17 statements. The patient was 
asked to indicate for each statement which mode of treatment 
s/he would prefer. Responses could be TR, FtF, both or 
neither. The patient was encouraged to explain his/her 
decision. For example, the patient heard statements such as 
"I understood the clinician better", "I made greater progress". 
After each statement the patient was asked to choose TR or 
FtF, or to say "both" if s/he thought that both treatments were 
equally good or "neither" if no treatment could be selected.    
Treatment: At the beginning of the treatment session 
series each person was presented with a set of pictures and 
was requested to name them. A different set of pictures was 
used in each treatment program. Following this initial 
naming test, a set of 20 pictures that the patient failed to 
name was defined separately for every person. This set was 
then divided into two subsets of ten pictures – one set was 
used for training and the other set was used to assess 
generalization following all therapy sessions. Each treatment 
session lasted 45 minutes. The session began with a short 
spontaneous conversation, followed by a diagnostic naming 
test of the ten words. The next twenty minutes were 
dedicated to improving naming of these 10 pictures. In the 
remaining time, several other language tasks were chosen 
and tailored by the SLP to fit the patient's individual needs 
and personal goals. The same structure applied in both the 
TR and the FtF protocols. During the period of the study 
none of the participants received any other treatment for 
aphasia.  
System: A custom-made web application that provides 
videoconference along with a shared whiteboard was used 
for the TR. This system contains more than 50 various 
language-related tasks, such as naming, semantic relations, 
hearing comprehension, reading and so on. 
III. 
RESULTS 
This section first presents scores on the aphasia 
assessment and then scores on the satisfaction questionnaire 
A. Aphasia assessment 
For each patient, we calculated the difference between 
score before and after each treatment in AQ as well as in 
each of the four subsets scores of the WAB. Differences 
were then averaged across participants, separately for the TR 
mode and FtF mode. Figure 1 presents the percent of 
improvement following treatment in both AQ and in the four 
WAB sub-scores. 
As can be seen in Figure 1, there was improvement in all 
skills in both modes of treatment. A paired t-test that 
examined improvement in both modes of treatment showed 
no significant differences on any of the assessment subsets 
(speech, auditory comprehension, repetition, naming). The 
difference between improvement in AQ following TR and 
following FtF was significant (t (DF=7) = 2.606, p = 0.035) (see 
also Table 2). It should be noted that the AQ score is 
combined of the other four sub-scores, and thus, the 
difference in AQ was stronger than the differences in each 
subtest.  
In order to further estimate the effect of treatment mode 
(TR vs. FtF) and treatment order (1st vs. 2nd), we used linear 
regression model for panel data, with person as a subject 
(panel) and period and treatment mode as factors 
(covariates).

Table 2 presents the regression analyses (effect and SD 
of mode and period and the p-value). As can be seen in Table 
2 there was no effect of treatment order for most of the sub-
scores, except for the Speech subtest which had significant 
order effect (that is, there was greater improvement after the 
first treatment than after the second one). The regression 
showed significant effect of treatment mode for the AQ score 
only, as did the t-test analysis.  
In sum, TR led to a greater improvement in AQ than did 
FtF therapy. Improvement in scores on the Speech subtest 
were higher following the first treatment session series than 
following the second session series, regardless of treatment 
mode. 
Next, we examined whether the order of treatment 
affected the carry over between the two treatments. A paired 
t-test analysis compared the total change in AQ scores 
between the two groups. That is, we computed the difference 
(delta) in AQ scores between the 4th and the 1st assessments 
for each group separately (Group 1: TR then FtF; Group 2: 
FtF and then TR) and then compared those deltas. This test is 
based on an assumption of no interaction between period and 
treatment mode. Any possible interactions were examined 
through an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with period and 
mode as factors, which resulted in these p-values for the AQ 
score: period p=0.25, mode p=0.034 and interaction 
period*mode p=0.97. The t-test analysis showed no 
significant difference in deltas between groups: Group 1 
mean delta=10.2 (SD 3.51) and Group 2mean 
delta=7.35 (SD. 6.09), t (6) =0.81, p=0.45. Therefore, 
there was no significant difference between the two 
groups in the carry over effect. That is, in both groups, 
improvement between testing times was similar and the 
order of treatment mode had no effect on scores on the 
aphasia test battery. 
B.  Satisfaction questionnaires 
In this section, we present participants' answers on 
the satisfaction questionnaires, as provided at the end of 
each 14-session treatment series (at the end of either the 
TR tor the FtF treatment). We also present the answers 
that were provided at the end of both treatments 
regarding the comparison between the two modes, as 
collected a month and a half after the end of the second 
treatment. 
1) Satisfaction 
from 
each 
treatment 
mode 
separately 
Overall, the participants showed similarly high 
satisfaction from both treatment modes. They felt that 
each treatment was as simple to understand, as comfortable, 
as available, as interesting, and as helpful as the other. 
a) Satisfaction regarding common questions for TR 
and FtF 
For each of the 13 common questions, we estimated 
agreement between answers for TR and FtF using Kappa 
statistics (that is, testing the relation between the observed 
agreement and the expected agreement according to the 
given distribution of answers). We analyzed cases of 
disagreement between satisfaction ratings using exact 
generalized McNemar statistic. This test analyzes each pair 
of symmetrical cells and compares the observed distribution 
with a uniform (50%-50%) distribution. No result was 
significant (as might be expected because of the small 
sample size). Table 3 presents the distribution of answers to 
the satisfaction questionnaire in each treatment mode, as well 
as the agreement between treatment modes (in percent), 
Kappa score, and p-value. 
As can be seen in Table 3, there was high agreement 
between ratings of the two treatments, with 5 out of 13 
questions receiving the same ratings by all participants 
(Agreement=100%), and the remaining questions receiving 
highly similar ratings.

b) Satisfaction regarding TR treatment 
Table 4 presents the distribution of answers that 
participants gave on the five questions that addressed the TR 
alone. 
As can be seen in Table 4, most responses indicated high 
satisfaction from TR. Participants reported no difficulty in 
learning how to use the TR system, they felt that the TR 
system was easy to use, and they were satisfied with the 
quality of the materials. 
2) Comparing satisfaction between treatment modes 
Next, we analyzed responses on the satisfaction 
questionnaire filled a month and a half after the end of 
second treatment. Figure 2 presents participants' preferences 
of either on of the treatments or answers that indicated no 
preference. 
The overall agreement and asymmetry tests between the 
two modes showed 68.4% agreement with Kappa=0.193 
(p=0.0095) and asymmetry of 29 vs. 14 (p=0.03). 
As can be seen in Figure 2, for most statements (93/136) 
participants had no preference for either treatment (chose 
"both" or "neither"). For example, for statements such as 
"There was more frustration in the treatment" all participants 
chose "neither" or "both", and for statements such as "I will 
recommend to people in my condition to participate in this 
kind of treatment", most participants chose "both". 
When showing a preference for one treatment over 
another, FtF was more favorable (29/136) than TR (14/136).

For example, when asked to rate statements such as "I 
was satisfied from the interaction with the clinician", and "I 
advanced more through treatment", more participants chose 
FtF than TR. When asked to rate a statement such as "I was 
satisfied with the treatment availability", more participants 
chose TR than FtF. When examining the content of the 
statements on which no agreement was found, we saw that 
most of these statements revolved around the interaction with 
the clinician. In those statements participants preferred FtF 
over TR. 
In sum, when examining satisfaction levels, participants 
had no preference of one mode over another, except when 
asked about the interaction with the clinician, which they 
rated as more favorable in the FtF mode.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The current study sought to explore whether speech and 
language therapy delivered via telerehabilitation had similar 
effects as did conventional face-to-face therapy. The effect 
of therapy was examined by using objective scores obtained 
from a formal assessment of aphasia, as well as by collecting 
subjective satisfaction data.  
Overall, the results show that the delivery of speech and 
language therapy via telerehabilitation at home yields at least 
the same results as similar therapy delivered in the clinic. 
The results of the present study add to former reports about 
the reliability of the assessment of speech and language 
difficulties [4][6][10]. In addition, the results suggest that the 
technology is not only suitable for assessment but that it is 
also effective when used for therapy. Theses results are 
similar to several earlier reports that found that TR was 
effective in treating people with voice disorders [8][12]. The 
novel contribution of the current study is that it shows for the 
first time the beneficial effects of TR in the treatment of 
aphasia.  
It is important to note that TR resulted in higher general 
aphasia scores relative to FtF treatment. It could be the case 
that the technological novelty of the TR added both to the 
participant's motivation and to the therapist's motivation. As 
for the subjective report, we found that participants were 
satisfied from both modes of treatment. However, when 
asked to choose between the two modes, participants showed 
a preference toward the FtF mode, mainly in reference to 
questions that addressed personal contact with the clinician. 
As in an earlier report [3], participants were generally 
satisfied with TR with regards to audiovisual quality, and 
ease of use, yet some individuals may still require help in 
solving technical problems during TR sessions at home. 
Despite of the small sample in the present study, we 
believe that our results are promising. They add evidence 
regarding the efficiency of TR and thus make it possible to 
offer such treatment either alone or in combination with FtF 
therapy to people suffering from aphasia. TR expands the 
accessibility of speech and language therapy to this 
population, overcoming obstacles such as lack of rural 
services, geographical distance, transportation difficulties, or 
lack of mobility. 
Although the results of the present study are encouraging, 
future research is still needed to investigate the effect of TR 
in diverse populations in terms of the nature and severity of 
the speech and language disorders.
