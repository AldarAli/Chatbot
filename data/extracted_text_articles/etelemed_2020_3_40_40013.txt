INTRODUCTION
There are extensive ambitions of reusing data from
EHRs, both for clinical use and for secondary purposes, like
registries, research, and management. However, one of the
main problems when it comes to exchange and reuse of
health data is that most of the content in EHRs is recorded as
free-text information.
A promising strategy of exploiting health data across
different contexts is to structure the clinical information
recorded in EHRs through openEHR-based clinical variables
(archetypes) [1][2].
This way, the clinical information is
recorded as standardized data, in relation to the context it is
registered. Hence, such standards can be extracted and
reused for both primary and secondary purposes contributing
to the goal of creating a digital society across multiple social
arenas. The Norwegian vendor DIPS AS is currently
developing an openEHR-based EHR system called “DIPS
Arena” [3], to comply with the expectations of exchange and
reuse of health data in the Norwegian healthcare sector. A
core principle of the openEHR specification is that clinical
users are in charge of structuring the content of the EHR, i.e.,
the archetype standards. Furthermore, expert users should be
in charge of designing user interfaces, e.g. (forms, templates
for
notes
and
documents)
where
the
archetypes
are
embedded
[1]. To
be
defined
as
an
expert
user, a
combination of clinical background, technical understanding
and knowledge about openEHR is required.
However, previous attempts of healthcare organizations
structuring openEHR-based archetypes and forms revealed
that this work was more demanding than expected [4]. The
main challenges were related to: how to structure clinical
variables in terms of high quality archetypes as basis for the
structured form, how to make these forms more user friendly
than the original paper based ones, and the importance of
including a number of clinicians from specific medical
specialties’ in the standardization work [4].
There exist development methodologies for creating
terminologies
and
ontologies
[5]-[7].
In
addition,
an
archetype modelling methodology has recently been released
[8]. Some papers describe experiences with using structured
data, standardized through the openEHR approach [2][9]-
[10]. Still, a comprehensive and formal methodology for
modelling structured openEHR-based user interfaces does
not exist. It is of great importance to establish a methodology
for developing and designing structured user interfaces, since
the openEHR ambition gives the expert users a specific role
as designers in the process.
However, a methodology is in progress, based on an
empirical project in the North Norwegian Health Region.
This project is part of the regional program The Future
Systems in the Clinic (in Norwegian: Fremtidens Systemer i
Klinikken, FRESK) [11]. The program is responsible for
implementing a portfolio of new clinical Information and

Communications Technology (ICT) systems in the health
region, in which a new openEHR-based EHR system, DIPS
Arena, is one of the core systems.
In this paper, we have focused on the development of a
structured openEHR-based form, conducted by expert users.
The form is supposed to collect and transfer clinical patient
data from the EHR to the Norwegian Registry for Spine
Surgery (NORspine). During the process of developing the
openEHR-based
form
and
the
initial
framing
of
the
methodology, socio-technical challenges emerged related to
the expert users’ role in the design process.
This study has followed the empirical project through an
action research approach [12][13]. To analyze and discuss
the empirical findings in order to answer the research
question, we lean on the design principles of Information
Infrastructure (II) and Infrastructuring theory [14]-[18].
The aim of the paper is to describe and discuss the socio-
technical challenges related
to
expert
users designing
openEHR-based forms, in terms of designing clinical
variables as archetypes, programming the queries and
designing the lay out of the form. Hence, we ask the
following
research
question:
Which
socio-technical
challenges
are
addressed
when
expert
users
design
openEHR-based forms?
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2
presents the action research approach, and data collection.
Section 3 describes the design tools, the design process of
the registry form, and summarizes the methodology for
designing openEHR-based user interfaces. In section 4 we
address key socio-technical challenges when dealing with
infrastructural complexity in design, this includes working
with advanced openEHR design tools, the role of the expert
users, and the technical complexity of designing structured
forms. Section 5 presents a brief concluding summary of the
paper.
II.
BACKGROUND
The empirical project started in January 2019, when
NORspine
approached
the
FRESK
program
for
collaboration. NORspine set a proposal of transforming
their paper-based registry form into an openEHR-based data
entry form, and implement it into DIPS Arena. NORspine
aims at improving the quality of surgical treatment for
degenerative disorders in the cervical and lumbar spine [22].
The purpose of implementing the registry form into the
EHR was to raise the registration rate from today’s 64% to
the national goal of above 80%, and which will raise the
quality of the registry’s recommendation for the spine
surgery service [22].
Today, clinical information within the EHR is mainly
recorded as free-text descriptions. Hence, the clinicians have
to make double registrations on most of the data reported to
registries [23]. This generates a risk that parts of the patient
information end up in the registry only, since there is no
connection between the registry form and the EHR system.
Today surgeons fill out a paper-based form, and then a
secretary or a nurse upload the recorded data into an
electronic
form
in
the
registry’s
web-portal.
Double
registration of patient data is a time consuming process
taking up an extensive amount of the healthcare personnel’s
time.
Therefore, it is anticipated
that automatically
extracting and exporting clinical data recorded as part of the
EHR documentation process to the registry form, will be a
key means to improve the coverage rate, increase the quality
of the registry, and reduce the time spent on documentation
[22].
The FRESK program accepted the proposal from the
spinal surgeons, and the structured EHR team of expert
users got the assignment. The request from NORspine
implied automatically extracting and exporting clinical data
recorded as part of the EHR documentation process to the
registry. Accordingly, the clinical information had to be
structured as archetypes in accordance to DIPS Arena as an
openEHR–based system. The development of the openEHR-
based form was done in close collaboration with the vendor
DIPS AS, and the National Administration of Archetypes
(In Norwegian: Nasjonalt Redaksjons Utvalg for Arketyper
NRUA). NRUA is responsible for the library of nationally
approved archetypes, in terms of developing new archetypes
on request from clinical communities, translating archetypes
from international archetype libraries, and running public
review rounds with numerous clinicians involved to approve
new or translated archetypes [4].
An openEHR-based EHR system is not an ‘off-the-
shelf’
product.
In
accordance
with
the
openEHR
specification, the healthcare organizations and clinicians are
expected to take part in the customization process of
designing
archetypes,
templates
and
forms
for
their
organizations, as well as tailoring clinical process- and
decisions support functionalities to their needs [1][8]. The
North Norwegian Health Region is committed to the
openEHR
framework
and
do
their
fair
share
of
customization of the EHR system. Several stakeholders are
involved: expert users, clinicians, system vendors, ICT
consultants, and archetype experts. The expert users have
both clinical and technical competence in addition to
extensive knowledge on openEHR, which is necessary for
using the design tools and understand the capabilities,
benefits, and consequences when changes are made in the
archetypes, templates and forms.

METHOD
We have used a qualitative action research approach to
follow the emerging process of developing a methodology
for
expert
users
in
healthcare
organization
designing
structured user interfaces [12][13][19][20]. Action research
requires
close
collaboration
between
researchers
and
clinicians, and it is an iterative research process within a
given context [12].
Creswell [21] has defined three elements of action
research design. First, the science-theoretical perspective, in
where we used II as a theoretical lens, to discuss, understand
52

and give recommendations to the empirical process. Second,
the research strategy, in where we describe action research
as the main method of studying practice and organizational
development, contributing to a ‘co-constructive’ learning
process for health personnel, developers, and researchers
[21]. In this research project, the first and second author
participated
in
the
practical
work
of developing
the
openEHR-based
form,
and
the
outlining
of
the
methodology. In this regard, they had an ‘insider’ role as
expert users and experienced researchers. Working in close
collaboration with the empirical program, the preliminary
findings were discussed and presented to the project
managers,
vendors
and
users
involved.
In
addition,
preliminary findings have been used as recommendations
for the ongoing process [14]. Third, for data collection and
analysis, we used II theory to identify the socio-technical
challenges. The last two authors have many years of
experience from research on ICT in healthcare in general,
and on openEHR research in particular. In this study, these
authors had an ‘outsider’ role, in terms of balancing the
insider
perspectives
and
contributing
in
framing
the
research.

CASE – THE DESIGN PROCESS
The findings presented in this section is detected by
following
the
evolving
methodology
for
developing
openEHR-based user interfaces.
A. The Design Tools
Two expert users (the first two authors) in FRESK
transformed the existing paper-based spinal surgery registry
form into an archetype-based registry form for DIPS Arena.
To design the archetype-based form, it was necessary to use
four
different
(ICT)
programs:
Electronic
mind
map
(XMind), Ocean Informatics Archetype Editor, Ocean
Informatics Template Designer [24] and a specific Form
Designer provided by DIPS AS. The mind map was used to
get an overview of the variables in the paper-based form.
The Archetype Editor and the Template Designer were used
to design archetypes and align and constrain them into a
template for this specific use case. Then, the Form Designer
was used for further configuration of the template into the
registry
form
as
representing
the
user
interface
for
clinicians. It took long time, extensive training and in-depth
knowledge about the openEHR design principles to learn
how to use the design tools and how the different design
steps related to each other. These steps are described in
detail in the following sections.
B. Mapping Variables and Archetypes
The first step was to insert the variables from the
existing paper-based registry form into the electronic mind
map (XMind). This provided an overview of all the
variables in use in relation to e.g. if there was an overlap of
variables, and the coherence between them (see Figure 1).
Figure 1.
Mapping the variables in XMind
Given the request for automatically extracting and
exporting clinical data recorded as part of the EHR
documentation process, it was necessary to categorize the
variables in relation to where they first emerged in the
clinical documentation process (pre, per, or postoperative),
and to assess the potential for reuse. In the present
documentation process, information was stored in different
documents, e.g., outpatient clinic notes, evaluation notes,
surgery notes, and discharge notes. In addition, the registry
form was not part of the documentation process.
The expert users collaborated closely with clinicians to
understand their current use of the clinical documents. For
example, when and where did they record the clinical
information, what was the coherence between different
variables in the registry form, and the relation between
clinical needs of specific and unambiguous information.
Then,
the
expert
users
made
suggestions
for
which
archetype to replace with each of the variable, and discussed
the proposal with NRUA and DIPS AS in several meetings.
One important finding from this process was that the
variables used
in the registry form were aggregated
compared to clinical information used for documenting
treatment and care. For example, the variable ‘other
endocrine diseases’ used in the register form, covers all kind
of endocrine diseases, except from diabetes. However, in
clinical practice, ‘other endocrine diseases’ is too generic to
use when documenting assessments, treatments and care.
53

eTELEMED 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine

The different granulation levels will complicate the potential
for automatically reusing information about endocrine
diseases into the registry form. Hence, differences in the
granulation
level
of
registry
variables
and
clinical
information
was
important
to
consider
during
the
replacement. One suggested way of complying with this
problem was to link together the diagnose codes for all
endocrine diseases recorded in the EHR and map the linked
codes to the specific category in the registry form.
C. Use National Archetypes or Develop Local Ones
After mapping the variables to archetypes, the next step
was to decide whether to use archetypes from the national
openEHR-library,
or
design
local
archetypes
for
this
specific use case. It is preferable to use national approved
archetypes to ensure semantic interoperability of clinical
information. However, the first version of DIPS Arena did
not offer functionality for advanced reuse of clinical
information between different documents in the clinical
process. In addition, the healthcare organization has not yet
started to structure clinical documents as archetype-based
notes, e.g., the admission notes, the physicians’ daily notes
and discharge letters. Accordingly, at this point of the
design process, it was not possible to reuse clinical
information from different documents to the registry form.
Another factor for using local archetypes was that
national
approved
archetypes
are
complex
standards
designed as maximum dataset. This demand for extensive
adjustments of the archetypes when using them in the
templates - or forms, to comply with specific contextual
requirements, e.g., the registry form. For example, the
openEHR
‘problem
diagnosis
archetype’
is
used
for
recording details about an identified health problem or
diagnosis. The registry form asks for the name of the
diagnosis only, comparing with the problem/diagnosis
archetype that has 13 data elements, e.g., anatomical
location, date/time for debut and clinical description to
make a comprehensive description of the medical problem
and diagnosis. Accordingly, it would be time consuming for
the clinicians to fill in information requested in all the 13
data elements when only one data element is required in the
form.
In relation to the current limited reuse of archetypes
from the clinical process, and the complexity of constraining
national archetypes to the registry form, the decision of
designing local archetypes to the first version of the registry
form was made. This decision was made in agreement with
advisors from the vendor and NRUA. In addition, using
local archetypes was expected to speed up the design
process since they are less complex than the national ones.
After a short development process, the first version of the
form was presented to the clinicians. They provided
feedback about the first version of the electronic form to the
expert users, and approved the layout.
A disadvantage of using local archetypes was that some
of the archetypes, e.g., (radiological examination) contained
several clinical elements with the potential of being reused
as autonomous archetypes.
However, since the elements
were part of a larger archetype, it was possible to reuse the
whole archetype only.
D. Coherence between the Design Tools
To design local archetypes, the Ocean Informatics’
Archetype Editor was used. The Archetype Editor has a
given set of data types used to design clinical variables as
data elements in an archetype (Figure 2). There is a
coherence between the data type chosen to represent the
variables/data elements in an archetype, the possibilities for
configuration of the variables/data elements in the DIPS’
Form Designer and finally the options of how to display the
variables in the form. For example, some data types could
generate variables as radio buttons in the Form Designer,
while other data types could not.
Figure 2. The different data elements for designing variables in an
archetype using the Archetype designer.
In addition, if the goal was to create a drop-down menu
where users could select one variable from the list only, then
the data type ‘Text’ had to be used. Moreover, the drop-
down menu for clinical variables had to be added as a list of
‘internal codes’ when designing the archetype, or as a ‘value
set’ in the archetype when using the Template Designer. If it
was uncertain how the variable would be used in the form, it
was possible to design different data elements e.g., both
‘Boolean’ and ‘Text’ elements representing the same
variable.
E. Assembling the Archetypes to a Template
When
every
variable
in
the
registry
form
were
represented as archetypes, they were assembled in a
template by using Ocean Informatics' Template Designer. In
the Template Designer, it was possible to constrain the
archetypes in terms of making data elements/variables
inaccessible.
For
instance,
the
national
archetype
for
American Society of Anesthesiologists risk (ASA) score,
54
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2020.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-763-4
eTELEMED 2020 : The Twelfth International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine

containing 11 stages, was used in the form. However, in the
registry form, the variable ASA score was defined by five
different ASA stages only. Therefore, six stages had to be
defined as inaccessible in the template. If archetypes were
constrained in the template (Template Designer), and it
became necessary to make some of the inaccessible data
elements available later, it required creating a new template.
After
conducting
all
necessary
configurations
in
the
Template Designer, the template was exported to the Form
Designer.
The final steps of configuring the form was done in the
DIPS’ Form Designer, this included adding dependencies
between variables to define the relations amongst them,
adding calculations, etc. In example, a field in the form
addressed medication, and asked if the patient is using
anticoagulation regularly. If the answer was ‘no’, then the
option to answer ‘yes’ disappeared. If this was wrong, you
just clicked ‘no’, and the option ‘yes’ appeared again. If you
answered ‘yes’, you got more options, e.g., a drop-down list
of different kind of anticoagulation medications (made as
‘internal codes’ in the archetype) to specify the answer.
Another example was, if you filled in weight and height,
then BMI was automatically calculated. During the process
of adding dependencies, it became important to create a
system
for
storing
and
managing
the
dependencies,
annotations and calculations, to be able to update or check
them if something did not work as anticipated, or if changes
were made in the template/form. Making change to an
archetype required the need for making changes in the
calculations,
annotations
and
dependencies
where
the
archetype was used.
When configuring the form in the Form Designer, it was
very important to work in close collaboration with the spinal
surgeons. The archetype-based form was designed similar to
the web-based form, in terms of dependencies amongst
variables and options in drop-down menus etc. However,
based on feedback from the surgeons, it was necessary to
change some of the dependencies and displays in the form.
For example, in the paper-based form, the surgeons
explained that the list of options related to ‘other diseases’
was used as a reminder to help them remember to ask for all
the different diseases when filling in the form. Therefore,
they wanted to see all the options in the electronic form.
Dependencies hiding the list of options made it more
cumbersome for the surgeons to fill in the form, as ‘the
reminders’ then were hidden.
The vendor had made a technical user manual for the
Form Designer. However, the design process addressed a
need for expanding the user manual with instructions aimed
for the expert user role.

DISCUSSION
In the design process, we described the evolving
empirical process of designing an openEHR-based EHR
form. As mentioned earlier, structuring the spinal surgery
form was very useful for uncovering challenges associated
with structuring openEHR-based user interfaces in a ‘real-
life’ setting. The design process addressed several socio-
technical challenges. We will now discuss four of them; 1)
the complex design tools, 2) the tension between instant
benefit
and
long-time
requirements,
3)
the
need
for
extensive governance for user designed software and 4) the
importance of contextualization.
A.
The Complex Design Tools
The four design tools available for the expert users are
quite complex to use. Everyone can download the mind map
tool and the tools from Ocean Informatics. However, behind
the scenes, using the tools requires extensive training of the
expert users.
In an infrastructuring perspective, it is not
enough that the expert users have knowledge about using
the design tools only. They also need extensive knowledge
on
the
different
possibilities
and
limitations
in
both
designing archetypes and templates, and how designing
them affects the design possibilities in the user interfaces.
Each step conducted in each of the different tools are
interdependent to make the overall infrastructure evolve
[19].
In addition, even if the design of archetypes, template
and form is of high quality, the final step of the design
process needs to end with a user-friendly display of the
form. Accordingly, it is necessary to include clinical
expertise and technical competence as well. This demand
for expert users taking the role as translators between ICT
and clinical practice to establish an II were knowledge from
these two installed bases are merged.

B.
Tension
between
Instant
Benefit
and
Long-term
Requirements
There is an inherent tension between ‘quick-and-dirty’
design, and designing for long-term use. The case describes
why local archetypes were used extensively, despite the
recommendation of using national approved archetypes.
There is a constant negotiation between the importance of
an efficient design process, were the clinicians can see early
results of a structured form, and the need for robust
archetypes as basis for future use. Design for instant
usefulness is in accordance with the II design principle of
bootstrapping, where users get access to working software
as early as possible in the design process, to motivate them
to continue in contributing to the work [17]. However, the
consequence of ‘quick-and-dirty’ design can be that long-
time usefulness is compromised by for instance extensively
constraining the archetypes in the template. Another use-
case may demand for briefly constraining an archetype thus,
designing a new template is necessary. This demands for
extensive work with the form to redesign annotations,
calculations and dependencies related to the archetype.
Hence, extensively constraining of archetypes in a template
decreases the possibility for long-time usefulness.
However, designing for long time use to ensure future
needs related to the design principle of adaptability [17]and
can generate a risk of designing local archetypes too flexible
like in the empirical case where different data elements
represented the same clinical variable. To this end, if these
archetypes are reused in several EHR systems and one
organization decides to use the data element ‘Text’ and
another organization uses use ‘Boolean’ for the same
variable, the consequence is that the clinical variable is not
interpreted as the same archetype. Accordingly, the reuse
potential is severely compromised.
C.
The Requirement for Extensive Governance for User
Designed Software
User-designed
software
like
variables,
forms,
and
dependencies requires extensive governance. The complex
infrastructuring process [18][19] of form design expresses
the need for interaction between different actors with
dissimilar competences [4]. Structuring user interfaces is a
complex infrastructuring process in relation to, e.g., making
changes to archetypes, and how that effects the templates
and forms were they are used. The infrastructuring process
also demands for setting up a shared repository for storing
and retrieving both local and national archetypes to be used
for structuring the EHR. In addition, governing a structured
EHR addresses the need for training the actors involved, to
get
an
overall
understanding
and
knowledge
about
archetypes,
templates
and
forms,
in
terms
of
where
archetypes
are
used
and
reused,
as
well
as
what
consequences changes or constraints generates.
Scaling the structured form to a structured EHR will
increase the need for control over archetypes, templates and
forms implemented in the EHR, and the accompanying
dependencies, annotations and calculations. This requires an
extensive ICT governance organization unit within the
healthcare
organization.
Establishing
an
extensive
governance organization relates to the design principle of
building on the installed base in where existing systems,
actors and governance need to be part of the process [17].
D.
Contextualization
is
a
Complex,
but
Necessary
Dealing.
Nationally approved archetypes are developed through a
thorough design process managed by high-qualified expert
users
in
NRUA.
These archetypes are developed
as
maximum datasets to be useful in any clinical context and
for
different
clinical
specialties.
National
approved
archetypes constitute the basis for semantic interoperability
in openEHR-based systems. This adheres to the II design
principle
of
standardization,
and
the
importance
of
communicating through defined clinical standards [17].
However, as maximum datasets, these archetypes need to be
contextualized, i.e., constrained and tailored to specific use
contexts. In line with the openEHR specification, the
configurations
must
be
done
by
local
health
care
organizations. As the case describes, configuration of
archetypes, templates and forms is complicated and requires
a combination of different skills, such as clinical insight,
archetype competence and expertise in ICT/programming. A
related
contextualization
is
also
found
between
local
archetypes in the EHR form and NORspine. Here some
apparently similar data, for instance ‘other endocrine
diseases’ have different granularity. This illustrates that data
traveling across settings needs to be contextualized to make
the infrastructure grow [17].
VI.
CONCLUSION
To summarize, this paper has described and discussed
socio-technical requirements, detected when following the
design of a registry form and the emerging methodology for
designing structured user interfaces by expert users.
From this study, we found:
1)
The expert user role demands a thorough understanding
of the complex design tools. It also requires extensive
training over a longer period of time, in order to create
high quality archetypes, templates and forms.
2)
It is important to find a balance between an efficient
design process and the need for robust archetypes as a
basis for the infrastructuring process.
3)
Structured user interfaces demand for establishing
extensive governance at different organizational levels.
4)
It is essential to contextualize national high quality
complex archetypes to different local contexts, in order
to make them useful for clinical practice. This must be
done
in
collaboration
with
clinicians
and
local
governance organizations.
The
infrastructuring
process
of
designing
regional
openEHR-based user interfaces is a complex process, which

demands
for
several
socio-technical
requirements
to
succeed. Hence, it is important to establish a ‘scaffolding’
organization, in terms of governance and extensive training
programs to make it possible for expert users to be in charge
of
the
infrastructuring
processes
of
designing
user
interfaces. This is an ongoing process in the health region
and, accordingly, it is necessary to do more research in this
field.
