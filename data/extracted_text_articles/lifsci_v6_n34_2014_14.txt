Abstract— Patient-centered care is an emerging healthcare 
model that is changing how people think about health and 
about the patients themselves. It emphasizes the coordination 
and integration of care, and the use of appropriate 
information, communication, and education technologies in 
connecting patients, caregivers, physicians, nurses, and others 
into a healthcare team where the health system supports and 
encourages cooperation among team members. However, in 
spite of the widespread adoption of telemedicine, existing 
telemedicine applications neither support patient centered-care 
nor the interoperation of relevant e-health tools. In this paper 
we present a cloud-based telemedicine consultation server, 
which manages telemedicine consultation request and their 
allocation to consulting physicians. It also aids physicians to 
access patients’ health documentation either through a 
Personal 
Health 
Record 
(PHR) 
or 
Personal 
Health 
Information System (PHIS). Although both ways are suitable 
for supporting patient centered telemedicine the PHIS is 
superior in that it integrates the functionalities of a variety of 
e-health tools, and thus provides a holistic approach for 
personal healthcare.  However, the integration of e-health tools 
requires the introduction of a shared ontology and the 
transformation of patients’ health records in the format that is 
compliant with the shared ontology.

 INTRODUCTION  
Telemedicine is the use of telecommunication and 
information technologies in order to provide clinical health 
care at a distance [1]. It aims to eliminate distance barriers 
and can improve access to medical services that would often 
not be consistently available in distant rural communities [2] 
[3]. In particular, telemedicine is viewed as a cost-effective 
alternative to the more traditional face-to-face way of 
providing medical care [4].  
At the same time, the introduction of new emerging 
healthcare trends, such as patient-centered care [5], 
pharmaceutical care [6], chronic care model, and personal 
health records (PHRs) [7], are changing how people think 
about health and about the patients themselves.  In addition, 
many studies have demonstrated that the provision of these 
healthcare models can increase compliance with treatment 
regimens, satisfaction with the health care provider and 
medical facility, and improve the ultimate health outcome for 
the individual [8].  
It is also true that patients who do not understand their 
treatment instructions, disease management, or prescription 
requirements are more likely to mishandle their health, be 
hospitalized more frequently, and have much higher medical 
costs than their more involved counterparts [9]. 
Unfortunately, none of the categories of telemedicine 
support these emerging healthcare trends: Store-and-forward 
telemedicine involves acquiring medical data and then 
transmitting this data to the system that is accessible to 
patient’s physician. Interactive services provide real-time 
interactions between patient and physician. It includes phone 
conversations, online communication and home visits. 
Remote monitoring enables medical professionals to monitor 
a patient remotely using various technological devices. 
In this paper, we describe our work on developing a data 
infrastructure that supports patient-centered telemedicine. In 
particular, we describe our work on developing a cloud-
based telemedicine system that manages consultation 
requests by a software module called Consultation Server. It 
also assists physicians in accessing patients’ health 
information that is stored either in Personal Health Records 
(PHR) [10] or Personal Health Information System (PHIS) 
[11, 12]. 
In our vision PHRs, and especially PHISs, can 
significantly contribute to the introduction of patient-
centered care. Further, they do not only improve the quality 
of care but also significantly increase the efficiency of 
consulting physicians as they can be authorized to access 
patient’s health documentation. 
Our approach changes the traditional telemedicine 
paradigm: its main goal is not only to provide a cost-
effective alternative to the more traditional face-to-face way 
of providing medical care but rather to provide a data 
infrastructure for information sharing among patient’s 
healthcare team.  
In the design of the Consultation Server, as well in the 
design of the PHIS, we have followed the idea of knowledge 
oriented organizations [13]. Its key idea is to revolve all 
applications around a shared ontology.  The main gain of 
such architecture is that the applications can interoperate by 
accessing the shared ontology. 
In our introduced ecosystem the participants that agree to 
work together for practicing telemedicine is called as a 
telemedicine 
affinity 
domain. 
Examples 
of 
possible 
telemedicine affinity domains include nationwide and 
regional affinity domains, regional federations made up of 
several local hospitals, healthcare providers, and insurance 
provider supported communities.

A useful feature of a telemedicine affinity domain is that 
it is global: its components can locate anywhere in the 
Internet, and it can be exploited by patients and consulting 
physicians as far as they have an Internet connection.  
The notion of telemedicine affinity domain has 
similarities with the clinical affinity domain of the IHE XDS 
[14], which studies the problem of patient’s scattered clinical 
documentation. Its key idea is that patient’s clinical 
documents are dynamically retrieved from a clinical affinity 
domain by exploiting relevant registries. This model assumes 
that patients’ clinical documentation follow them as they 
move from one clinical affinity domain to another. Another 
difference between IHE XDS and PHRs is that in the former 
patient’s clinical documentation is managed by healthcare 
authorities while in the latter they are managed by a patient.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, in 
Section II, we give a motivating scenario of our ideas of 
patient-centered telemedicine in practice. Then, in Section 
III, we give an overview of the emerging healthcare models 
that have inspired our work.  Further, in Section IV, we give 
an overview of various approaches for storing patients’ 
healthcare documentation. However, as in our case PHRs 
and PHISs have a key role in storing patients’ health 
documentation, they are considered more detailed in 
Sections V and VI, respectively. With respect to PHRs we 
focus on considering the expression power of the HL7 CCD 
standard while with PHISs we introduce our designed 
system, 
which 
extends 
traditional 
PHRs 
by 
the 
functionalities of various e-health tools. The key point here is 
that these tools interoperate by sharing an ontology, which is 
an integration of the data sources of these e-health tools.  
In Section VII, we consider operational aspects of 
telemedicine. In particular, we present the Consultation 
Server that manages telemedicine consultation request and 
their allocation to consulting physicians. It also aids 
physicians to access patients’ health documentation either 
through a CCD standard-based PHR or through our designed 
PHIS. In Section VIII, we consider the Consultation Server 
as an ecosystem having many interconnected parts. Finally, 
Section IX concludes the paper by analyzing the potential 
risks that may jeopardize the deployment of our designed 
telemedicine system. We also shortly consider our future 
work on integrating the Consultation Server with other e-
health tools used by the consulting physicians.  
II. 
MOTIVATING SCENARIO 
Assume that a patient, named Nancy Taylor, has an 
online Web-based free PHR, where her health data and 
information related to the care given to her is stored. She can 
access her PHR from any place having an Internet 
connection.   
One day Nancy discovered a rash on her waist, and so 
she decided to visit the nearest general practitioner having a 
contract with a telemedicine affinity domain.  The 
practitioner examines Nancy’s rush but the practitioner does 
not know what kind of treatment or medication should be 
prescribed for Nancy, and so the practitioner decides to 
request medical consultation by his Web browser.  
To carry out the consultation the practitioner first takes a 
photo from Nancy’s waist. Then the practitioner fills the 
request document by describing the symptoms of the rash 
and attaches the photo to the document. The document also 
provides a hierarchical classification (i.e., a taxonomy) of 
diseases.  The practitioner marks the node “skin disease”. In 
addition, authorized by Nancy the practitioner adds a link to 
Nancy’s PHR and authorization for its use (including 
required access rights).    Finally, the practitioner clicks the 
submit button, and so the document is delivered to the 
Consultation Server, which maintains a queue of the pending 
requests.   
Each request includes a set of metadata items such as 
disease(s), source of request, language and possible priority 
of the request. The function of the metadata items is to 
enable automatic matching of the requests and the consulting 
physicians. So the Consultation Server shows for a 
consulting physician only the requests that match with his or 
her profile. Therefore, each consulting physician of the 
affinity domain also has a profile, which has values for the 
metadata items and is stored in the Consultation Server.   
Assume that a physician, named John Smith, is a 
specialist in a hospital of a telemedicine affinity domain. In 
addition his profile matches with the request concerning 
Nancy, and so the request is in the consultation request 
queue shown for him.  
After a few minutes John Smith picks up the consultation 
request document and examines the symptoms described in 
the document as well as the attached photo. Immediately he 
recognizes Nancy’s rash as shingles (herpes zoster), which 
can be treated by a medicinal product named Aciclovir. Then 
he checks from Nancy’s PHR whether Nancy has some 
allergies that would prevent the use of the drug or whether 
she has some ongoing medical treatment that could cause 
mutual negative effects. As there are no such findings the 
physician updates Nancy’s PHR by the prescribed 
medication and by the diagnosis he made. Finally John 
constructs and signs the prescription electronically, which is 
then electronically delivered to the general practitioner 
visited by Nancy.  
Further, assuming that instead of PHR Nancy is using a 
PHIS that integrates the functionalities of various e-health 
tools including information therapy server, then the PHIS 
would automatically send by e-mail relevant medical 
information (or their links) dealing with the prescribed 
medication (i.e., Aciclovir) and the diagnosis (i.e., herpes 
zoster).  
III.  
EMERGING HEALTHCARE MODELS  
Patient-centered care emphasizes the coordination and 
integration of care, and the use of appropriate information, 
communication, and education technologies in connecting 
patients, caregivers, physicians, nurses, and other into a 
healthcare team where health the system supports and 
encourages cooperation among team members [15]. It is 
based on the assumption that physicians, patients and their 
families have the ability to obtain and understand health 
information and services, and make appropriate health 
decisions.

Pharmaceutical care emphasizes the movement of 
pharmacy practice away from its original role on drug supply 
towards a more inclusive focus on patient care [16]. It 
emphasizes the responsible provision of drug therapy for the 
purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve 
patient’s quality of life [17]. 
Chronic care model [18, 19] emphasizes patients’ long-
term healthcare needs as a counterweight to the attention 
typically paid to acute short-term, and emergency care. In 
this sense, the traditional care models are not appropriate as 
the patients with chronic illness do not receive enough 
information about their condition, and they are not supported 
in caring themselves after they leave the doctor’s office or 
hospital. 
Information therapy is a type of healthcare information 
service that has emerged in the past decade. The goal behind 
information therapy is to prescribe the right information to 
right people at right time [20]. Information therapy is also 
described as “the prescription of specific evidence based 
medical information to specific patients at just the right time 
to help them make specific health decisions or behavior 
changes” [21]. 
Information therapy applies to a wide range of situations 
and context. For example, information therapy may be a 
physician-written prescription telling a patient what to read, 
or it may use to help a patient to make treatment decision 
such as whether to continue medication.  
Information therapy can be compared to similar concepts 
in medicine such as drug therapy, physiotherapy or 
bibliotherapy [22]. However, information therapy differs 
from these in the sense that by exploiting information 
technology 
information 
therapy 
aims 
at 
providing 
personalization, targeting and documentation.   
Personalization means that the content of the delivered 
information depends on the familiarity of the user. Targeting 
means that the information prescriptions are targeted 
according to patient’s moment in care, i.e., information is 
delivered at right time. Documentation means that 
information prescriptions are documented as part of the 
provided treatment.  
There is a variety of paper-based mediums for delivering 
information therapy such as handing out information 
pamphlets or sending them through the post. There are also 
many electronic infrastructures (such as electronic medical 
record systems, personal digital assistants, order entry 
systems and personal health records) that have been 
proposed for delivering information therapy.  
IV.  
MANAGING PATIENTS’ HEALTH DOCUMENTATION 
A. PHRs vs. EHRs 
A PHR is a record of a consumer that includes data 
gathered from different sources such as from health care 
providers, pharmacies, insures and the consumer [23]. It 
includes 
information 
about 
medications, 
allergies, 
vaccinations, illnesses, laboratory and other test results, and 
surgeries and other procedures [24]. PHRs are owned by the 
patients. They also allow individuals to access and 
coordinate their lifelong health information and make 
appropriate parts of it available to those that are authorized 
by the individual. 
In medical consultation, as well as in any medical 
treatment, a complete and accurate summary of the health 
and medical history of the patient is of prime importance.  A 
problem here is that as a patient may have lived in various 
places and a patient may have many healthcare providers, 
including primary care physician, specialist, therapists and 
other medical practitioners, patient’s health documentation 
may be distributed over several healthcare providers.  
PHRs provide a simple way for solving the problem of 
patients’ scattered clinical documentation [25]. They differ 
from EHRs (Electronic Health Record) [26, 27] in that they 
are owned by the patients and they can only be accessed by 
the patient and those that are authorized by the patient while 
EHRs assume that the health records are designed only for 
use by health care providers and are owned by medical 
authorities.  
Managing fragmented healthcare documentation by 
EHRs has been successful only in a very few industrialized 
countries, such as in Singapore and Denmark [28]. Instead 
successful results from the use of PHRs are reported from 
many countries and communities. Therefore we have also 
concluded that the use of PHRs instead of national EHR’s in 
managing patients’ health documentation is a more 
appropriate solution in the context of telemedicine.   
B. Web-Based  PHRs 
PHRs can be classified according to the platform by 
which they are delivered. In web-based PHRs health 
information is stored at a remote server, and so the 
information can be shared with health care providers. They 
also have the capacity to import data from other information 
sources such as a hospital laboratory and physician office. 
However, importing data to PHRs from other sources 
requires the standardization of PHR-formats.  
Various standardization efforts on PHRs have been done. 
In particular, the use of the Continuity of Care Record (CCR 
standard) of ASTM [24] and HL7’s [29] Continuity of Care 
Document (CCD standard) [30] has been proposed.  From 
technology point of view CCR and CCD-standards represent 
two different XML schemas designed to store patient clinical 
summaries [31]. However, both schemas are identical in 
their scope in the sense that they contain the same data 
elements. 
Web-based PHRs are core components in our proposed 
ecosystem. However, it does not assume that all patients 
have a PHR, but it encourages patient to acquire a PHR.  
Using a PHR does not require patients to own any personal 
devices for internet connection nor any efforts for managing 
it. Rather it requires patient to authorize healthcare personnel 
to maintain and access their PHR.   
Acquiring a PHR is a tempting opportunity as there are 
many freely available web-based PHRs available, and 
moving personal data between standard-based PHR is 
supported by the vendors. For example, as the support of the 
Google Health was retired on January 2012 Microsoft has 
developed a transfer process for the user of the Google 
Health for moving their health records into Health Vault.

Similar to Dossia and World Medical Card, it is a web-based 
system to store, maintain and share health and fitness 
information. They support a number of exchange formats 
including industry standards such as the CCR and CCD 
standards. 
V.  
CCD STANDARD AND PHRS 
A. 
CCD Standard  
CCD standard (an XML schema) is nowadays 
increasingly used for specifying the structure of exchanged 
clinical documents as well as specifying the structure of the 
PHR. This feature simplifies the update of the PHR as well 
as the generation of the clinical documents that will be stored 
in the PHR. 
The CCD standard is a constraint on the HL7 CDA 
standard. The CCD standard has been endorsed by HIMMS 
(Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society 
Though) 
[32] 
and 
HITSP 
(Healthcare 
Information 
Technology Standards Panel) [33] as the recommend 
standard for exchange of electronic exchange of components 
of health information. 
Although the original purpose of the CCD documents 
was to deliver clinical summaries between healthcare 
organizations, nowadays the XML schema of the CDD 
documents is increasingly used for specifying the structure of 
the PHRs.   The same schema can be used in message as all 
its parts are optional, and it is practical to mix and match the 
sections that are needed.  
 
B.  HL7 RIM and RMIM 
We have given preference to CCD standard (an XML 
schema), which is based on HL7 RIM (Reference 
Information Model).  The RIM is the cornerstone of the HL7 
message 
development 
process 
and 
development 
methodology [34]. It expresses the data content needed in a 
specific clinical or administrative context and provides an 
explicit representation of the semantic and syntactical 
connections that exist between the information carried in the 
fields of HL7 messages [35]. 
The RIM is based on two key ideas [28]. The first idea is 
based 
on 
the 
consideration 
that 
most 
healthcare 
documentation is concerned with “happenings” and things 
(human or other) that participate in these happenings in 
various ways.  
The second idea is the observation that the same people 
or things can perform different roles when participating in 
different types of happening, e.g., a person may be a care 
provider such a physician or the subject of care such as 
patient.  
As a result of these ideas the RIM is based on a simple 
backbone structure, involving three main classes, Act, Role, 
and Entity, linked together using three association classes 
Act-Relationship, Participation, and Role-Relationship (Fig. 
1). Note that HL7 uses its own representation of UML to 
reflect the use of these six backbone classes. Each class has 
its own color and shape to represent the stereotypes of these 
classes, and they only connect in certain ways. 
 
Figure 1. RIM backbone structure. 
 
Each happening is an Act and it may have any number of 
Participations, which are Roles, played by Entities. An ACT 
may also be related to other Acts via Act Relationships. Act, 
Role and Entity classes have a number of specializations 
(subclasses), e.g., Entity has a specialization LivingSubject, 
which itself has a specialization Person.   
The classes in the RIM have structured attributes which 
specify what each RIM class means when used in a message 
(exchanged document). For example, Act has structured 
attributes classCode and moodCode. The former states what 
sort of Act this is (e.g., observation, encounter, or 
administration of a drug). moodCode indicates whether an 
Act has happened, is request for something to happen, a goal 
or a criterion. The idea behind structured attributes is to 
reduce the original RIM from over 100 classes to a simple 
backbone of six main classes [28]. 
Note that the RIM is not a model of healthcare, nor is it a 
model of any message, although it is used in exchanged 
messages. The structures of exchanged documents are 
defined by constrained information models [28]. The most 
commonly used constrained information model is the RMIM 
(Refined Message Information Model). Each RMIM is a 
diagram that specifies the structure of an exchanged 
document.  
A RMIM diagram is specified for a specific use case 
[35]. The diagram is derived from the RIM by limiting its 
optionality. Such specifications are called CDA Profiles [36]. 
In developing a RMIM diagram the RIM is constrained 
by omission and cloning. Omission means that the RIM 
classes or attributes can be left out. Note that all classes and 
attributed that are not structural attributes in the RIM are 
optional, and so the designer can take only the needed 
classes and attributes. Cloning means that the same RIM 
class can be used many times in different ways in various 
RMIMs. The classes selected for a RMIM are called clones.  
The multiplicities of associations and attributes in a 
RMIM are constrained in terms of repeatability and 
optionality.  Further, code binding is used for specifying the 
allowable values of the used attributes.  
Although the semantics of all CDA documents is 
tractable through a RMIM back to the RIM, we neither can 
use the RMIM nor the RIM in formulating queries on 
patient’s health documentation as each RMIM only models 
one type of documents. Another reason is that there are no 
query languages specified for the information model used in 
the RMIM and RIM schemas.

C. HL7 CDA Levels 
Each CDA document has one primary purpose (which is 
the reason for the generation of the document), such as 
patient admission, transfer, or inpatient discharge. Each 
Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) document is made 
up of the header and the body [28].  
Depending whether the header and body of the CDA 
documents are based on the RIM they are classified into 
three levels: 
 
 
CDA Level 1: Only the header is based on the RIM 
while the body is human readable text or image.  
 
 
CDA Level 2: Only the header of the document is 
based on the RIM while the body is comprised of 
XML coded sections.  
 
 
CDA Level 3: Both the header and the body are 
based on the RIM. 
 
The CDA header is common to all the three levels of 
CDA. The header contains basic metadata. These include 
information about what the documents is, who created it, 
when, where, and for what purposes. Its primary purpose is 
to provide unambiguous, structured metadata about the 
document itself, which can be used in document registers to 
classify, find and retrieve documents.  
In HL7 CDA terminology the header is an instance of an 
Act called Clinical Document. This means that there is a 
Refined Message Information Model (RMIM) that models 
the headers of all HL7 CDA documents. To illustrate this, a 
simplified RMIM of the Header of CDA documents is 
presented in Fig. 2. The diagram presents classes of the 
RMIM but not all their attributes.

Note that HL7 uses its own representation of UML in 
RMIM diagrams: each class has its own color and shape to 
represent the stereotypes of these classes, and they only 
connect in certain ways. 
The entry point of this diagram (CDA Header) is 
ClinicalDocument, which is specialization of the RIM class 
Act. Classes Patient and Employee are specializations 
(subclasses) of the RIM class Role. Person and Organization 
are specializations of the RIM class Entity. Subject and 
Performer are specializations of the association class 
Participation. Each specialization inherits all of the 
properties (attributes) of the generalization. For example, the 
class Patient is a specialization of Role with the addition of 
the optional attribute veryImportantPersonCode. 
D. The Structure of a CCD document 
Each CCD document have one primary purpose (which is 
the reason for the generation of the document), such as 
patient admission, transfer, or inpatient discharge. Further, 
each CCD document, as well all HL7 CDA documents, is 
comprised of the Header and the Body.   
The sections that can appear in the Head and in the Body 
in a CCD document are presented in Fig. 3.

Figure 3. The parts of the CCD document. 
 
A CCD document that includes a header and the 
Medications section from the Body is presented in Fig. 4.  
The content of the document is derived from the scenario 
presented in Section II, i.e., the document would be inserted 
in Nancy Taylor’s PHR, which is based on the CCD-
standard.  
In a PHR the CCD documents are usually organized into 
hierarchical structures that simplify the search of documents, 
e.g., grouping together the documents by episode, clinical 
specialty or time period. Yet each clinical document is stored 
as a stand-alone artifact, meaning that each document is 
complete and whole in itself.

VI. 
DESIGNING A PHIS  
A. Personal Health Information System PHIS  
Traditional PHRs fail in supporting information therapy, 
which is a key component in patient-centered care. Further, 
our studies have indicated that user-friendly health system 
should support the functionalities of many traditional e-
health tools such as PHRs, remote patient monitors, health-
oriented blogs, and health-oriented information servers. 
Further, by gathering these functionalities into one system 
we can achieve synergy, i.e., achieve functionalities that 
would not be obtainable by any of the e-health tools 
independently. 
In gathering functionalities into a PHIS we have adapted 
the ideas of knowledge centric organizations to i.e., we have 
revolved the e-health tools around a health oriented 
knowledge base. So, all the e-heath tools share patient’s 
health data. Further, by exploiting the characteristics 
provided by cloud computing [37] we can easily ensure the 
interoperation of patient’s healthcare team: accessing the 
advanced PHR requires only internet connection.  
A. PHIS Ontology  
The architecture of the PHIS and its connections in the 
cloud are presented in Fig. 5. As the figure illustrates patient 
and the members of his or her healthcare team access the 
PHIS-server through the personalized health portal. It is a 
site on WWW that provides personalized capabilities for its 
users and links to other relevant servers.

In designing the PHIS we have followed the idea of 
knowledge oriented organizations [13], where the key idea is 
to revolve all applications around a shared ontology (stored 
in a knowledge base), which we call PHIS-ontology. It is 
developed by integrating the ontologies of the e-health tools 
supported by the PHIS. For now we have integrated the 
ontologies of the Blog manager, Information therapy (Ix) 
manager, Remote manager, and PHR manager. Such an 
internal architecture of the PHIS is presented in Fig. 6.

In order to illustrate shared classes, A could be class 
Disease, B class Patient, and C class Informal_entity. Further 
assume that object property A-B is suffer_from, object 
property A-E is deals, data property b1 is patient_name, and 
data property e1 is a url.    In such as setting we could 
specify by RDF (Resource Description Framework) that 
John Smith suffers from diabetes and the educational 
material dealing diabetes is stored in a specific url.

Figure 9. A portion of the PHIS-ontology in OWL.  
 
In order to understand the relationship of XML, OWL 
and RDF note that XML (Extensible Mark-up Language) is 
just a meta language for defining markup languages. By a 
meta language we refer to a language used to make 
statements about statements in another language, which is 
called the object language. Accordingly RDF [38] and OWL 
[39] are object languages. Instead, XML says nothing about 
the semantics of the used tags. It just provides a means for 
structuring documents. Due to the lack of semantics we do 
not use XML for representing PHIS-ontology but instead we 
use ontology languages RDF and OWL. 
B. Transforming HL7 CDA into OWL  
Although the semantics of all CDA documents is traceable 
through a RMIM back to the RIM, we neither can use a 
RMIM nor the RIM in formulating queries as there are no 
query languages specified for the information model used in 
the RMIM and RIM schemas. For this reason we transform 
the RMIM of the CDA header into OWL.  
Transforming 
a 
RMIM 
diagram 
into 
OWL 
is 
straightforward in the sense that both models are object-
oriented although the notation used in RMIM diagrams 
slightly differs from the traditional UML notation. Yet their 
basic modeling primitives are the same, namely classes, 
235

subclasses, properties and values. The classes are also 
connected in a similar way through properties.  
In order to illustrate the transformation of RMIM diagram 
into OWL we have presented the RMIM diagram of Figure 4 
in OWL in Fig. 10.  
Classes, subclasses, data properties and object properties 
are modeling primitives in OWL [40]. Object properties 
relate objects to other objects while datatype properties relate 
objects to datatype values [13]. For example, Performer is an 
object property. Its domain is clinicalDocument and range is 
employee.  Note that, in Fig. 10 we have omitted most 
datatype properties. The only datatype property presented in 
the figure is “code”. Its domain is clinicalDocumernt and its 
range is xsd:string, i.e., string in “XML-terminology”.

VII. CONSULTATION SERVER 
A. The Architecture of the Consultation Server 
In designing the internal architecture of the Consultation 
Server we have followed the idea of knowledge oriented 
organizations, where the key idea is to revolve all 
applications around a shared ontology. As illustrated in Fig. 
11, in our solution all the applications of the Consultation 
Server are revolved around the Consultation Ontology.  
The users access the Consultation Ontology through the 
Consultation Portal, which provides connections to the 
relevant cloud applications. The applications are based on 
the use cases of the various user groups. For example, 
Submit Consultation Request and Pick-up a Consultation 
Request are two typical applications developed for 
physicians.  These applications interoperate through 
accessing the same data items included in the Consultation 
Ontology.  
Note that although the Consultation ontology is specified 
in QWL and queried by SPARQL [41] (i.e., by a RDF-based 
query language), it is stored for the efficiency reasons in a 
relational database [42].

B. The Structure of the Consultation Ontology 
A portion of the Consultation ontology is graphically 
presented in Fig. 12. In this graphical representation ellipses 
represent classes and rectangles represent data type and 
object properties. Object properties relate objects to other 
objects while data type properties relate objects to datatype 
values. Classes, data type properties and object properties are 
modelling primitives in OWL. 
Note that in Fig. 12 we have presented only a few of 
objects’ datatype properties. For example, in the figure we 
have omitted most of the datatype properties from the classes 
Physician and Organization. Instead all the datatype 
properties of the class Consultation request are presented in 
the figure. The class Speciality and its datatype property 
Class represent a taxonomy. That is, except for the root node 
there is a link from each class instance to its parent.  
236

The idea behind this taxonomy is that the symptoms and 
the specialities of the physicians are specified by the same 
vocabulary. This feature simplifies the matching of 
consultation requests and physicians’ specialities.

Figure 12.  Graphical presentation of a portion of the Consultation 
Ontology. 
 
The Consultation Ontology enables a variety of useful 
queries for physicians such as the followings:  
 
 
Is there any pending consultation request having 
classification “Skin diseases”? 
 
Is there (in the affinity domain) any physicians 
having speciality in diabetes?  
 
Is there any consultation request matching with my 
speciality? 
 
Is there any pending consultation request that is 
submitted by a physician of the University 
Hospital?   
 
Is there any consultation request that has been 
pending over ten minutes? 
 
Give me the names and specialties of the consulting 
physicians that work in a specific affinity domain. 
 
Note that the Consultation Server can support more than one 
telemedicine affinity domain. Further, as most OWL 
ontologies, such as the Consultation Ontology, are usually 
stored in relational database systems, it is also possible to use 
the triggering mechanism of the SQL [43] in automating the 
management of the consultation requests. For example, a 
request can be automatically allocated to a physician having 
required speciality and having no ongoing consultation.   
C. Cloud Computing and SaaS 
Cloud 
computing 
is 
an 
appropriate 
choice 
for 
telemedicine 
consultation 
management 
as 
it 
allows 
organizations to use applications without installation. 
Moreover, in most cases cloud-based solutions reduces the 
cost of acquiring, delivering, and maintaining computing 
power [37]. However, in our vision the main goal behind 
cloud computing is to achieve synergy through controlled 
sharing of data.   
In particular the Saas (Software as a Service) [44] model 
of cloud computing is appropriate for the Consultation 
Server. It is a software delivery model in which applications 
are hosted by service provider and made available to 
customers over the Internet. It provides access to software 
and its functions remotely as a Web-based service.  
Further, there are various architectural ways for 
implementing the SaaS model. For example, in the case 
where the Consultation Server serves more than one 
telemedicine affinity domain we could use the following 
software architectures:    
 
1. Each telemedicine affinity domain has a customized 
version of the Competence Server that runs as its 
own instance.  
2. Many telemedicine affinity domains use separate 
instances of the same application code. 
3. A single program instance serves all telemedicine 
affinity domains. 
 
In our designed version the Consultation Server supports 
only one clinical affinity domain and so only one version and 
one instance is required.  
VIII. TELEMEDICINE ECOSYSTEM  
To succeed e-health systems should not be considered 
just as a technical infrastructure but rather as ecosystems 
having many interconnected parts [45].  
So far we have considered the technical infrastructure 
and the services of our designed telemedicine oriented cloud-
based ecosystem. The other key parts of the ecosystem are 
ethical aspects, governance regulations, financing and 
stakeholders. For now, we shortly consider what kind of new 
alternatives the introduction of cloud-based solutions gives 
for these parts of the ecosystem. 
A. Ethical Aspects in Telemedicine Resource Alloation  
Resource management is the efficient and effective 
deployment of an organization's resources when they are 
needed. Such resources may include financial resources, 
inventory, human skills, as well consultation resources in 
telemedicine.  
Resource allocation is a part of resource management.  It 
is used to assign the available resources in an economic way. 
In process management, resource allocation is the scheduling 
of activities and the resources required by those activities 
while taking into consideration both the resource availability 
and the process time. 
Although the resource allocation issues in healthcare 
sector are economic by nature, they inherently raise issues 
relating to ethics. According to the principles of medical 
ethics physicians should merit the confidence of the patients 
entrusted to their care, rendering to each a full measure of 
service and devotion. However, often scarcity of resources 
makes it difficult or impossible to provide the full measure of 
service and devotion.  
When the conditions of scarcity occur, we have to decide 
what considerations should guide decisions for tradeoffs in a 
fair and compassionate manner. Further, to carry out the 
237
International Journal on Advances in Life Sciences, vol 6 no 3 & 4, year 2014, http://www.iariajournals.org/life_sciences/
2014, © Copyright by authors, Published under agreement with IARIA - www.iaria.org

decisions the resource needs or requests must be prioritized, 
and finally the competitive request must be treated according 
to their priorities. 
B. Governance Regulations  
E-health application that maintains patients’ health 
documentation must adhere to national legislated policies 
and regulations, which concerns privacy and security issues. 
One problem is that in many countries that are just beginning 
to investigate on e-health application do not yet have enough 
mature legislation with respect to e-health. Thereby national 
governments have an important role in promoting the 
development of appropriate legislation concerning e-health.   
In our developed telemedicine ecosystem patient’s health 
documentation is not stored in the national archives but 
rather on PHR system, where the patient’s health 
documentation is owned by the patient and only used by the 
physicians, patient’s family members and healthcare 
personnel authored by the patient. As a result, patients’ 
health documentation is not under the control of national 
healthcare authorities, and thus is not so tightly dependent on 
whether there is advanced legislation for e-health.  
C. Financing Cloud-Based E-Health Ecosystems  
In designing an e-health ecosystem it is important to 
ensure that appropriate funding is in place for its 
implementation and operation. Financing can come from a 
variety of sources, such as government or public-private 
partnerships.   
 Financing PHRs is not an actual problem as there are 
many freely available web-based PHRs available. Further 
there are many freely available PHRs for specific 
communities, e.g., for employees of specific organization, 
customers of a specific insurance company or for the 
customers of a specific healthcare provider.  
D. Stakeholders of Global  Ecosystem 
In designing the implementation of an e-health 
ecosystem, it is of prime importance to involve in 
preparation all the key stakeholders, such as governments, 
public and private healthcare providers, patients, as well as 
patient advocacy groups [45].  
As our proposed ecosystem is not nationwide but rather 
“internet-wide”, the system itself as well as its stakeholders 
may span over many countries. For example, governments 
and healthcare providers from a variety of countries may be 
involved in the ecosystem, and each stakeholder has different 
objectives and motivations for participating in the ecosystem.  
IX. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The goal of our work has been to show that cloud-based 
global telemedicine ecosystems that support patient centered 
care can be implemented from technology point of view. Yet 
there are many problems that may jeopardize the success of 
such ecosystems.  In particular, the introduction of new 
technology requires training: the incorrect usage of a new 
telemedicine technology, due to lack of proper training, may 
ruin the whole ecosystem. In addition, a consequence of 
introducing a new telemedicine practice is that it 
significantly changes the daily duties of healthcare 
personnel, and the role of patient and patient’s family 
members. Therefore one challenging aspect is the changing 
the mind-set of the involved healthcare personnel.   
The introduction of a new technology in telemedicine is 
also an investment. It includes a variety of costs including 
software, hardware and training costs. Introducing and 
training the staff on new technology is a notable investment, 
and hence many organizations like to cut on this cost as 
much as possible.  
In order to minimize the changes that the introduction of 
the system will cause on healthcare personnel, in our future 
work we will investigate how telemedicine consultation can 
be linked into physicians’ day-to-day work patterns. In 
particular, we will consider how the functionalities of the 
Consultation Portal can be integrated with other e-health 
tools used by the physicians.
