 
Abstract—Given
a
linear
continuous-time
infinite-
dimensional
plant
on
a
Hilbert
space
and
persistent
disturbances of known waveform but unknown amplitude and
phase, we show that there exists a stabilizing direct model
reference adaptive control law with disturbance rejection and
robustness properties. The plant is described by a closed,
densely defined linear operator that generates a continuous
semigroup of bounded operators on the Hilbert space of states.
There is no state or disturbance estimation used in this
adaptive approach. Our results are illustrated by adaptive
control
of
general
linear
diffusion
systems.
Keywords- Hilbert space; persistent disturbances; general
linear diffusion systems; adaptive control
I. INTRODUCTION
Many control systems are inherently infinite dimensional
when they are described by partial differential equations.
Currently there is renewed interest in the control of these
kinds of systems especially in flexible aerospace structures
and the quantum control field [1][2]. In this paper, we want
to consider how to make a linear infinite-dimensional system
regulate its output to zero in the presence of persistent
disturbances.
In our previous work [3]-[6] we have accomplished direct
model reference adaptive control and disturbance rejection
with very low order adaptive gain laws for MIMO finite
dimensional systems. When systems are subjected to an
unknown internal delay, these systems are also infinite
dimensional in nature. Direct adaptive control theory can be
modified to handle this time delay situation for infinite
dimensional spaces [7]. However, this approach does not
handle the situation when partial differential equations
(PDEs) describe the open loop system.
This paper addresses the effect of infinite dimensionality
on the adaptive control approach of [4]-[6]. We will show
that
the
adaptively
controlled
system
is
globally
asymptotically stable using a new Barbalat-Lyapunov result.
We apply this controller to linear PDEs with analytic
semigroup generators and
compact resolvent which model
general linear diffusion systems.

with

uD
is a disturbance with known
basis functions
φD
. The persistent disturbances
uD
will
enter the plant through the state channels Γ and the output
channels E .
In order to accomplish disturbance rejection in a direct
adaptive scheme, we will make use of a definition, given in
[4][7], for persistent disturbances:
Definition 2: A disturbance vector

persistent if it it satisfies the disturbance generator

where F is a marginally stable matrix and
φD (t)
is a vector
of known functions forming a basis for all the possible
disturbances. This is known as “a disturbance with known
waveform but unknown amplitudes”. We can easily show
that an operator L exists to relate the persistent disturbances

will not need to know the actual L .

If such ideal trajectories exist, they will be linear
combinations of disturbance state, and they will produce
exact output tracking in a disturbance-free plant (8).
By substitution of (5) into (6), we obtain the Model

Now we consider the definition of Strict Dissipativity for
infinite-dimensional systems and the general form of the
“adaptive error system” to prove stability. The main theorem
of this section will later be utilized to assess the convergence
and stability of the adaptive controller with disturbance
rejection for linear diffusion systems.
Noting that there can be some ambiguity in the literature
with the definition of strictly dissipative systems, we modify
the suggestion of Wen in [8] for finite dimensional systems
and expand it to include infinite dimensional systems.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
In Theorem 1, we showed conditions under which ideal
trajectories exist for a linear infinit-dimensional system to be
capable of rejecting a persistent disturbance in the the output
of the plant. In Theorem 3 we used an extension of Barbalat-
Lyapunov result for linear dynamic systems on infinite-
dimensional Hilbert spaces under the hypothesis of almost
strict dissipativity for infinite dimensional systems, to show
that direct adaptive control can regulate the state and the
output of a linear infinite-dimensional system in the
presence of persistent disturbances without using any kind of
state or parameter estimation.. We applied these results to a
general linear diffusion problem with sinusoidal
disturbances using a single actuator and sensor and direct
adaptive output feedback.
These results do not require deep knowledge of specific
properties or parameters of the system to accomplish model
tracking. And they do not require that the disturbance enter
through the same channels as the control.
