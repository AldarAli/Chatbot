Abstract— The aim of this paper is to present the analysis 
result of research that focuses on the enablers of business 
process transformation in Japan. It has been said for some 
decades that the overall quality and efficiency of production 
lines in Japan are superior to many other countries. However, 
the overall business processes, including work of back offices 
throughout all industries, are not always efficient.  According 
to 
the 
Organisation 
for 
Economic 
Co-operation 
and 
Development (OECD), labor productivity in Japan ranks 22nd 
out of 34 countries. Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry 
(METI) mentions that the scope of information system 
integration is rather narrow in Japan, compare to many other 
countries. In addition, about 70% of firms have aimed at 
drastic process change but only 30% have attained it. Dealing 
with these issues, the authors conducted a survey and 
identified the enablers of Business Process Transformation 
(BPT) focusing on “super-ordinate” firms. 
Keywords-business process transformation; success factor;

I.
INTRODUCTION
It has been said for some decades that the overall quality 
and efficiency of production lines in Japan are superior to 
other 
countries. 
The 
word 
“KAIZEN 
(continuous 
improvement)” has become a word that is used not only in 
Japan. However, the overall business processes including the 
work of back offices throughout all industries are not always 
efficient [1][2], and labor productivity in Japan ranks 22nd 
out of 34 countries according to the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [3]. 
Long working hours are a serious issue in Japan.  Firms in 
Japan are trying to make their business processes more 
efficient by using Information Technology (IT). The 
objective of IT investment may differ in each firm; however, 
there are various tendencies according to region, industry 
and so on. As for the regions, Higano mentioned that 
Japanese firms tend to spend much more, in percentage 
terms, on improving the operational efficiency of their 
business compared to firms in Western countries, but the 
results do not seem to be satisfactory because the 
contribution of IT capital services to value added growth in 
Japan is lower than in Western countries [4]. There are many 
methodologies for business process orientation including 
business process re-engineering (BPR) or business process 
integration (BPI) [5]. However, it is difficult to achieve 
effectiveness by conforming to an ideal or to picture-perfect 
models. Data from the survey conducted by the authors show 
that 72.9% of the respondents (managers of information 
systems, business planning, or internal audit divisions) stated 
that the policy of their BPR was “drastic BPR,” but only 
28.4% had attained it [6].  
In this paper, we present the analysis result of research 
that focused on the enablers of business process 
transformation (BPT), focusing on what the “super-ordinate” 
firms do to achieve effectiveness considering the unique 
situation in Japan. In the subsequent section, we review 
related studies with the category of business process 
orientation and the unique situation of firms in Japan 
considered for BPT success. Section 3 describes our research 
model of BPT success and the analysis results of the survey. 
The differences seen between “super-ordinate” firms and 
other firms are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 
concludes this work and mentions about our future work. 
II. RELATED STUDIES 
In this section, we will look through the related studies 
about business process orientation, and the unique situation 
of firms in Japan should be considered for BPT success. 
A.
Studies about business process orientation  
Studies related to business process orientation can be 
roughly classified into several groups: methodologies [7][8], 
tools [9][10], the effectiveness of business process 
integration including critical success factors (CSF) [11] 
[12][13], etc. As for CSF, some researchers mention that 
culture is also one of them [14][15]. Takei et al. mentioned 
that some CSF of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) vary 
in different regions or countries, while some CSF are 
common to many countries [16].  For instance, BPR is not so 
important in developing countries because they are making 
new business processes and do not need re-engineering. The 
CSF of business process orientation including BPT can be 
considered to vary in different countries. 
B.
The unique situation of firms in Japan should be 
considered for BPT success  
・Scope of the information system. One of the reasons why 
business process transformation is not efficient in Japan may 
be the scope of information system integration [17]. Figure 1 
shows the result of a survey about the IT implementation

stage conducted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and 
Industry (METI) in Japan. The “IT utilization stage” is 
defined as follows [17]: 
•Stage 1: The information system is implemented. 
•Stage 2: The information system is optimally utilized 
within a department or section within a firm. 
•Stage 3: The information system is optimally utilized 
within an enterprise (expanded beyond departments or 
sections).  
•Stage 4: The information system is optimally utilized 
among enterprises (including suppliers or customers). 
The fact that about 70% of the firms in Japan (that is 
much lower compare to many of Western countries) are in 
stage 1 or stage 2 can be considered one of the reasons for 
the difficulty in implementing ERP systems in Japan, and for 
the low effectiveness of IT investment in Japan. Behind this, 
there is the culture of “TATEWARI”, which is a kind of 
vertically-segmented administrative system organization 
which takes a “silo approach” in Japan. In the TATEWARI 
type of organization, each section does not interfere with 
other departments, and everyone works hard only within the 
organization that they belong to. 
Figure 1. IT utilization four stages (Source: METI 2010) 
・Improvement but not drastic. Data from the survey 
conducted by we show that 72.9% of the respondents 
(managers of information systems, business planning, or 
internal audit divisions) stated that the policy of their 
business 
process 
transformation 
was 
“drastic 
transformation,” but only 28.4% had attained it [6]

・Outsource. Figure 3 shows the ratio of IT investment by 
software type [18]. Japanese firms rely far more on system 
engineers of outsourcing services, compared to the United 
States. Some of the reasons for this situation are related to 
employment conditions in Japan (Figure 3).

As we mentioned above, it seems to be important to seek 
ways to achieve effectiveness though BPT considering the 
unique situation in Japan. In the following sections, we 
describe the analysis result of the survey that we conducted. 
III. ANALYSIS OF BPT SUCCESS 
To address the issues mentioned in the previous section, 
we conducted a new survey. In this section, we describe the 
analysis result concerning enablers of BPT success. 
A.
Conceptual research framework and hypotheses 
Enabler items are considered to consist of BPT 
management, executing drastic transformation, and wide-
scope transformation. Figure 4 is a conceptual model for 
analysis.

Hypothesis 1 (H1): BPT management level has a positive 
impact on BPT effectiveness.  
It is hardly surprising that BPT management is important 
for achieving BPT effectiveness. We defined research items 
for BPT management considering the unique situation of 
firms in Japan: “business executives’ involvement in IT 
strategy”, “communication between business and IT 
section”, “motivation for improvement”, “business - IT 
alignment function”, “clear rules for cross-department 
decisions”, “evaluation criteria for external resources” 
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Planning and executing drastic 
transformation has a positive impact on the BPT 
effectiveness. 
As mentioned in the previous section, many firms in 
Japan failed to realize drastic BPT (realized only As-is 
based improvement finally), and that is considered one of 
the reasons why such firms have Japan is hardly achieved 
effectiveness by BPT which focuses on business efficiency. 
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Wide- scope transformation has a 
positive impact on BPT effectiveness. 
As mentioned in the previous section, many firms in 
Japan are at a lower stage of IT utilization, and that is 
considered as one of the reason why firms in Japan is hardly 
achieve their effectiveness by BPT that focuses on business 
efficiency.

Overall Research Results 
For the survey, 413 samples were gathered from the 
internet in March 2015. Table 1 shows the profile of the

Business – IT management level and BPT effectiveness. 
The multi regression result of IT management level of 
super-ordinate firms (target variable: BPT effect) are shown 
in Table 2. Predictor variables “business executive’s 
involvement in IT strategy”, “communication between 
business and IT section”, “motivation for improvement”, 
“evaluation criteria for external resources” had positive and 
significant impacts on BPT effect. The item “business - IT 
alignment function” was not significant, and “clear rules for 
cross-department decisions” had a negative impact. Clear 
rules for cross-department decisions may reinforce the 
“TATEWARI” culture which is considered one of the 
obstructive factors to wide-ranging BPT.

Drastic BPT level and effectiveness. The multi regression 
result of drastic BPT level and BPT effectiveness is shown 
in Table 3. The drastic BPT level is as follows: 

Level 4: Planned and able to execute drastic BPT. 

Level 3: Planned drastic BPT but could not execute 
it (could execute As-is based improvement). 

Level 2:  Planned as-is based improvement and 
executed drastic transformation.

Figure 6. IT Utilization stage and BPT effectiveness 
The p-value was 0.112 and this was not smaller than 
0.05. In that sense, we can say we cannot find a significant 
relationship between “IT utilization stage” and BPT effect. 
However the p-value is 0.112, it is nearly at the 10% level of 
significance. (It is sometimes considered that <10% is 
significant, rather than <5% is significant). The coefficient 
value of this item is negative. That means wide-ranging BPT 
projects seldom achieve their goal. Figure 7 shows the IT 
utilization stage ratio. There are about 50% of stage 4 and 3 
firms, but this is still far less than in Western countries. 
The reason why the item “IT utilization stage” shows a 
negative impact on BPT effect may be that many firms in 
Japan achieve only a small effect by targeting small scope 
of the organization.

Summary of overall analysis. Figure 8 is the summary of 
overall analysis. Most of the BPT items have a positive 
impact on BPT effectiveness. Executing drastic BPT has a 
positive impact on BPT effectiveness, but only 18 % of the 
firms have been able to execute the drastic BPT that they 
had planned. Wide – scope BPT has a positive impact on 
BPT effectiveness, but many of the firms that have wide–
scope transformation have not achieved effectiveness. 
Figure 8. Summary of overall analysis 
In addition to the result mentioned in 3.2.3, there some 
issues are founded from the survey as follows: 

The firms where the IT utilization stage is high do not 
tend to achieve BPT effectiveness. 
 METI mentioned that most firms in Japan are at a 
lower stage, and that is one of the reasons EISs in 
Japan are not efficient. However, even firms at 
higher stages do not always achieve BPT 
effectiveness. 

The firms whose IT utilization stage is at a high level 
do not always achieve a BPT effect which is IT 
contribution on business efficiency. 

Although about 50% of the firms have planned drastic 
transformation, only 37% of the firms above have been 
able to implement such transformation (2015). 
 It has progressed from the survey conducted in 
2008 (30% of the firms could implement drastic 
transformation), but the percentage (37%) is still 
behind other countries. 
C.
How do “super-ordinate firms” achieve their 
effectiveness? 
Addressing the issues that relationship between drastic 
BPT and wide-scope BPT is negative but this negative 
relationship can be thought the one of the reason of low 
efficiency of business processes in Japan, we tried to

analyze that how do “super-ordinate firms” achieve their 
BPT effectiveness. 
Definition of “super-ordinate firms”. We defined “super-
ordinate firms” as follows: 

Drastic BPT Level: Level 4 (Planned drastic BPT and 
could execute it) 

IT utilization Stage: Stage 4 (IS is optimally utilized 
among firms)
 or 3 (IS is optimally utilized within a 
firm.)  
The reason why we defined “super-ordinate firms” as 
above is that “super-ordinate firms” are overcoming their 
drawbacks and achieving the BPT effectiveness. 
IT management level of “super-ordinate firms”. The 
multi regression result of IT management level of super-
ordinate firms (target variable: BPT effect) are shown in

There is a significant, positive relationship between the 
following items and BPT effect; “Managements' will to 
change 
business 
process 
according 
to 
business 
environmental change” and “Evaluation criteria for external 
resources”.  There is a positive relationship between 
“Business - IT alignment function” and BPT effect, its p-
value is about 0.13, which can be said to be rather 
significant (because sometimes up to around 0.1 is 
considered as significant).  This multi regression result of 
“super-ordinate firms” is quite different from that of other 
countries. For the group of other firms, the items which 
have a positive significant relationship with BPT effect are 
“Involvement of business management in the IT strategy 
decision process”, “Communication between Business and 
IT section” and “Motivation for Improvement”. 
Meeting style of “super-ordinate firms”. The multi 
regression result of IT management level of super-ordinate 
firms (target variable: BPT effect) are shown in Table 6. 
The following items have a positive impact on BPT effect: 
“System users’ division leads the meeting” and “Meeting is 
held at IT division’s office”. For the meeting style, we could 
not find any difference between super-ordinate firms and 
other firms by item, but the coefficient values were 
different.

What is difficult about BPT?  The multi regression results 
as regards what is difficult about BPT of super-ordinate 
firms and other firms (target variable: BPT effect) are 
shown in Table 7. As for the super-ordinate firms, the 
answer of the question “It is difficult to estimate the BPT 
effectiveness of each division” has a positive impact on BPT 
effectiveness. That means the “super-ordinate” firms are 
good at estimating the BPT effectiveness of each division 
(5: No (=Do not feel difficulty), 4: Rather no, 3: Neutral, 2: 
Rather no, 1: No) . It seems this makes sense, because the 
adjustment of each division’s requirements can be 
considered as one of the critical issues of wide-scope 
transformation.

On the other hand, as for the other firms, the answer of 
the question “It is difficult to adjust system users’ 
requirements and IT feasibility” has negative impact on 
BPT effectiveness (5:No (=Do not feel difficulty), 4:Rather 
no, 3: Neutral, 2:Rather no, 1:No) . That means, for the 
other 
firms, 
difficulty

is 
lowering

IV. DISCUSSION 
Some differences were seen between “super-ordinate” 
firms and other firms in some categories.  
The items that show positive or negative impact on the 
BPT effect are listed below. 

Super-ordinate firms 
 (+)Managements' will to change business process 
according to business environmental change. 
 (+)Business - IT alignment function. 
 (+)Evaluation criteria for external resources. 
 (-)Provision for IT risk. 
 (+)System users’ division has a key role at the 
meeting. 
 (+)Meeting is held at IT division’s office. 
 (+)It is not difficult to estimate the BPT 
effectiveness of each division. 

Other firms 
 (+)Involvement of business management in the IT 
strategy decision process 
 (+)System users’ division has a key role at the 
meeting. 
     “Managements’ will to change business process 
according to business environmental change” and “Business 
- IT alignment function” are the items discussed at CSF of 
business process orientation (BPR, BPI, BPT). They can be 
considered the common enablers of BPT success.  On the 
other hand, “Evaluation criteria for external resources”, “It 
is not difficult to estimate BPT effectiveness of each 
division” and negative impact of “Provision for IT Risk” 
can be considered as items fitting the unique situation of 
firms in Japan. 
  Having “evaluation criteria for external resources” as an 
enabler, firms can manage outsourcing resources, which 
have more weight in Japan. Having “It is not difficult to 
estimate BPT effectiveness of each division” as an enabler, 
a firm can adjust the requirement of the divisions and avoid 
conflict. Not having “provision for IT risk” means taking IT 
risks (preparing for IT risk) must be an enabler to achieve 
the effectiveness of new technology. 
Figure 9 shows operating income on sales by “super-
ordinate” firms and other firms. “Super-ordinate” firms look 
a little superior to other firms. They will be considered to 
achieve much greater effectiveness by continuing their 
transformation using their enablers.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The aim of this paper was to present the analysis result 
of research that focuses on the enablers of business process 
transformation in Japan.  At the time we constructed the 
conceptual research framework and hypotheses, enabler 
items were considered to consist of BPT management, 
executing 
drastic 
transformation, 
and 
wide-scope 
transformation which helps to achieve BPT effectiveness. 
However, from the research results, executing drastic 
transformation and wide-scope transformation seemed to be

conflicting items. Then, we focused on the group that we 
had defined as “super-ordinate firms”, and a difference was 
seen between “super-ordinate” firms and other firms in 
some categories.(e.g., managements' will to change business 
process according to business environmental change, 
business - IT alignment function, evaluation criteria for 
external resources, system users’ role.) These items can be 
considered as the enablers of BPT for Japanese firms. The 
item “evaluation criteria for the external resources” must be 
important for many firms, not limited to Japanese firms. 
However, Japanese firms rely far more on system engineers 
of outsourcing services, compared to the United States. That 
means, evaluation criteria for the external resources must be 
one of the crucially important items for the Japanese firms. 
The enablers we had mentioned in this paper would help the 
firms in Japan who are struggling to realize drastic 
transformations. For the future research, we plan to delve 
more deeply into these enabler items, by interviews. Trust 
can be considered one of the key factors of business 
transformation effect [19]. So, we are planning to focus on 
the process of developing trust in business process 
transformation, and will analyze the differences between the 
super-ordinate firms and other firms.
