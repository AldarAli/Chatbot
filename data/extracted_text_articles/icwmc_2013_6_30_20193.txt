Abstract— Video quality perceived by the human eye is an 
area of research that is gaining space in today’s scientific 
circles.  Nowadays, a lot of media content is made available in 
the form of videos.  The relationship between network quality 
metrics and quality perceived for these videos assumes great 
importance, showing that if the requirements of network 
quality are not achieved the outcome will be impaired. This 
work presents a proposal to evaluate what the quality of a 
video would be based only on the quality of the network 
metrics (jitter, loss and delay), thus attempting to predict what 
the end-user would perceive using a widely used metric of 
objective quality (the PSNR) to evaluate the quality of 
multimedia content.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Many researches [2][3][5] have been completed in the 
area of video quality analysis, due to the enlarging 
bandwidth offered through the latest mobile network 
technologies. Among those networks, we cite the standards: 
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) [1], 3G [1] and 
WiMax [3]. 
With more bandwidth availability, new frontiers may be 
opened, increasing user satisfaction with the services that are 
available. When we talk about evaluating user satisfaction, 
we refer to the experience that is provided by the use of 
services offered, from which emerges a term that is 
becoming popular: Quality of Experience (QoE) [4]. 
This work intends to analyze the possibility of predicting 
an objective metric’s value for verification of video quality, 
using QoS information from the network. To do this, we 
need to evaluate objectively the quality of the video 
broadcasts, and the impact that the variables of Quality of 
Service (QoS) have on this value. The metric that has been 
chosen for video quality analysis was the Peak Signal-to-
Noise Ratio (PSNR) [3], due to being commonly used in 
studies of this nature and for being proven valid for the 
proposed scenario. 
In Section 2, we comment on some works related to 
Quality of Video (QoV) analysis and QoE in IP networks. In 
Section 3, we present the scenario and the resources used, as 
well as the methodology applied on the experiments of this 
research. In Section 4, the tests accomplished will be 
described with a summary of the results. In section 5, the 
results will be analyzed and discussed. Section 6 completes  
the report with the conclusion and presentation of possible 
future works.

RELATED WORKS 
The growth of network capacity, the standardization of 
transport protocols, the rising demand for multimedia 
content, and the standardization of video codecs are among 
the factors that propel the scientific community to continue 
research about how to improve the quality of this content, as 
well as a rational use of modern operating networks. The 
studies presented below are a few examples of research that 
contribute to improving the experience of the users when 
they access multimedia content. 
Gomathi et al. [5] proposed the implementation of a 
transport layer protocol to make available an improvement of 
the QoS metrics for multimedia content in wireless ad-hoc 
networks. Furthermore, he proposes the optimization of 
parameters from the Media Access Control (MAC) layer  to 
meet the objectives of the study, and as a result of the 
proposal presented, the author got a network delay reduction 
as well as an increase in the PSNR value. 
In [3] the evaluation of the protocol H.264/SVC with 
multimedia content through WiMax networks is performed, 
the evaluation using the objective metric (PSNR) and the 
subjective metric Mean Opinion Score (MOS), making use 
of a formula that relates the PSNR metric with the MOS 
metric, and identifying possible factors that influence the 
quality perceived by the user. 
Monteiro [1] worked with mobility management, aiming 
for the best user experience possible.  He also presents a 
metric that was called Network Quality Metric (NQN) and 
this metric will be used to analyze network quality in this 
study. 
Forchhammer et al. [6] presented an analysis and 
processing proposal without references, evaluating video 
quality without the need of accessing the original video, and 
as a result managing to obtain the value of PSNR with an 
error of about 0.3db. For this the coefficients of measured 
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) were used. 
In order to compare video quality metrics, D. Z. 
Rodriguez and G. Bressan [7] compare the quality of 
information of the metrics PSRN, Structural SIMilarity 
(SSIM), and Video Quality Metric (VQM) in an environment 
of stream over IP and digital TV according to the ISDB-T.

As a result, it may be that the quality measured is related to 
the content and characteristics of the video. 
C. C. Monteiro and P. R. L. Gondim [8] presented a 
proposal for the selection of the network based on 
characteristics of QoS and QoE for mobile environments, 
thus defining what would be the best moment for the 
execution of soft handover between 3G and Wireless Local 
Area Network (WLAN) networks to improve user 
experience.  
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
Aiming to achieve the objective of this study, a scenario 
was created containing all the requirements to meet the 
project’s demands.  A series of procedures were necessary 
for the execution process and this section deals with the 
presentation of this scenario, the resources and methodology 
used. 
The scenario devised for the tests was composed of a 
multimedia content server that made videos available for the 
client, and a client that processed the multimedia content 
provided by the server. All material available on the server 
could only be visualized on demand, thus giving more 
flexibility to a client that might use the services at more 
convenient times. 
One of the premises for the development of this study 
was that all the tools used should be based on free software. 
Following this concept, the server and the client were 
computers with Ubuntu 11.04 operating system installed. For 
content availability and its subsequent acquisition through 
network transmissions, VLC software [9] was used. VLC is a 
multimedia content player capable of publishing content for 
other users in the network. 
A great way of simulating congestion on the network is 
to use bandwidth limiting. This process allows you not to 
have to generate unnecessary background traffic and 
guarantees the velocity that will be available for the user. To 
accomplish this task the Class-based queuing (CBQ) shaper 
was used. Besides the already mentioned software, a little 
script written in python was necessary for sampling the state 
of the network, the program ffmpeg, necessary for the 
conversion of the videos, and lastly the file psnr.exe together 
with the program wine for the calculation of the PSNR. 
For research development the first step was the creation 
of a pilot test, having as its objective to make statistical 
calculations from the data to define the size of the ideal 
sample for the study. Thus the data used for the definition of 
the sample size were the jitter data that presented the greatest 
variation in pattern bypass during the pilot test, becoming the 
worst case. Below we have the values used for the 
calculations. 
 
          
      
     ms 
where, 
  – Average bypass pattern. 
  – Level of trust. 
  – Maximum error allowed. 
 
 
The level of trust for 95% of confidence level in normal 
distribution is 1,96. 
With these values at hand, it was possible to determine 
the size of the sample using the following formula:  
 
  
   
√                                       (1) 
 
Changing the values we found

                                   (2) 
                                       (3) 
 
We then arrived at the value of 65 repetitions for each 
evaluated video for a confidence level of 95%. 
Fifteen sequences of video were selected for the 
execution of the tests, all with spatial resolutions of 352 x 
288 pixels. All videos acquired in the format .yuv were 
converted to .mp4 to make possible their transmission 
through the network. The sequences are presented in Table I.

After reception, the videos must be recodified in the 
format .yuv  to make calculations of the PSNR possible.  The 
data should be then compared with the PSNR data previously 
obtained, aiming to identify the real losses caused in this 
metric during the transmission process. 
The simulation of congestion in the network was 
accomplished via cbq shaper. The videos were codified in 
the format H264/MPEG4 with a bitrate of 300k. Three 
distinct speeds were selected for the making of the tests: 
200k forcing the lost of packages due to network limitations, 
300k allowing the video to be played inside the limits of 
bandwidth requested, and 400k allowing the transmissions to 
happen without limitation. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
After identifying the quantity of repetitions needed, the 
quantity of sequences to be evaluated, and the velocities that 
should be tested, we see what needs to be done: two 
thousand nine hundred and five tests.  In each test we should

verify the information of QoS at the moment of transmission, 
complete the calculations of the QoV values, and, in the end, 
record all data in an organized way. 
Considering that this process would take a long time to 
be performed manually, and that little mistakes during its 
execution could harm the test results, we realized that the 
creation of a mechanism to automate these proceedings 
would be of great value, and in this way a testbed was 
developed. 
The testbed developed has the functions of performing 
the acquisition of the multimedia content of the server, 
storing the content in a client directory, acquiring and 
keeping the collected information about the network state 
during the transmissions, completing the process of 
modification of the video received from the .mp4 format to  
.yuv format, performing the PSNR calculations, comparing 
the original video previously saved in the client’s machine 
with the newly converted video, and finally consolidating the 
received data to facilitate the process of tabulation and 
analysis for the researcher. 
 As this work does not deal with the presentation of the 
developed testbed, as it is just a tool used to facilitate the 
activities performed during the research, the codes and 
algorithms used for the development of the testbed will not 
be shown. We will only present its components as well as the 
functions of each. 
 According to what is presented in the Table II, the 
testbed shows only four components. All components were 
developed in a way that their reuse may be possible in other 
environments with few modifications. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TABLE II. TESTBED COMPONENTS

cliente.sh 
Main component of the framework

are 
implemented. This component has a 
series of dependences which if not 
attended 
do 
not

its 
execution, making the process more 
secure and ensuring the functioning 
of all algorithms in a correct form. 
Qos.py 
Script in python developed for the 
collection of information about the 
network. Using the information 
contained in ping it can return data 
of QoS from the network like delay, 
jitter and loss. 
Psnr.exe 
Program 
responsible 
for 
the 
realization of comparison of the 
videos and calculation of PSNR, 
used in Linux with the help of the 
program wine. 
 
With the help of the framework the data collection 
process has become simpler, only one call being needed 
from the system to perform all the 3ollection and calculation 
tasks the command line are “cliente.sh 65 300K”. 
During the system call, we show that we need to make 65 
tests at a speed of 300K. As the quantity of videos has 
already been defined as 15, 975 tests will be executed, and 
when finishing all the tests we will have 60 files containing 
the data to be analyzed, that being four files for each video, 
one for delay, one for jitter, one for loss and finally one for 
PSNR. In Tables III, IV and V, we present the averages and 
standard deviation of data for every transmission rate.

After all the transmissions have been completed and all 
the files generated for each velocity, we will have a great 
quantity of data to be analyzed. As this work has as an 
objective to find any relation, if it exists, among the variables 
of QoS with the video quality calculated by PSNR, it is 
necessary to do multiple linear regression. This way we can 
verify how each variable influences PSNR, and if any 
variable can. 
V. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
Now, possessing all data in an organized form, tabulated 
in a spreadsheet, we can perform the next step to try to 
identify some relation among the variables involved. To do 
this we use the process of normal linear regression, aiming to 
establish a relation between the variable PSNR and the 
network metrics collected, jitter, delay and loss, that were 
evaluated as independent variables as can be seen below. 
 
                                (4) 
 
where, 
  – Estimated PSNR 
   – Coefficient of linear adjust. 
   – Coefficient of jitter. 
   – Average value of jitter 
   – Coefficient of Delay. 
   – Average Delay value

these values we use the interactive regression method of 
Gauss-Seidel using K=8 interactions for each broadcasted 
video at each velocity. At the end of each group of 
interactions we obtained 8 values of PSNR that were then 
compared to the values obtained during the tests in order to

The functions listed in the Tables VI-XX show that it is 
possible to find a relation between the metrics of the network 
and the quality of videos transmitted, taking into 
consideration the values of the Coefficient   . 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
This article proposed a model for the prediction of video 
quality based on an objective metric (PSNR), through the use 
of the QoS parameters of the network. 
With the data analysis collected during the experiments 
and the use of linear regression on the data, we could detect a 
relation between the metrics of objective quality evaluated 
(PSNR) and the metrics of QoS of the network. The 
functions found demonstrate this relation, as the PSNR 
suffers changes depending on the characteristics of the 
videos. Because of this, we have great differences in the 
generated formulas. 
The 
study 
demonstrated 
the 
possibility 
of 
the 
development of applications that use the parameters of a 
network’s QoS to predict the values of PSNR of a 
predetermined content in a way that the user will always 
have the best experience possible accessing multimedia 
content. For example, we may cite an application that uses 
this model to define what would be the best moment to make 
a change in the access network, or what video resolution 
should be made available in a predetermined environment. 
For future studies, we intend to use other objective 
metrics to verify if these aspects are confirmed.  We intend 
to compare subjective metrics, objectives and the parameters 
of the network in order to consolidate the results of this 
research.
