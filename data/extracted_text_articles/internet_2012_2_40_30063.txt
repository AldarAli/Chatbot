Abstract—Some users in a question and answer (Q&A)
site use multiple user accounts and attempt to manipulate
communications in the site. In order to detect these inadequate
multiple account users precisely, it is important to investigate
them from various points of view. In this paper, we investigate
suspicious users from the viewpoint of deviations of answer
submission order and discuss the reasons why and how the
deviations occurred. The results of this study will give us a
chance to investigate purposes and behaviors of inadequate
multiple account users in a Q&A site.
Keywords- multiple account; Q&A site; deviation; submission
order; credibility.
I. INTRODUCTION
In these days, many people use question and answer
(Q&A) sites, where users share their information and knowl-
edge. Q&A sites offer greater opportunities to users than
search engines in the following points:
1) Users can submit questions in natural and expressive
sentences, not keywords.
2) Users can submit ambiguous questions because other
users give some supports to them.
3) Communications in Q&A sites are interactive. Users
have chances to not only submit questions but give
answers and, especially, join discussions.
As a result, Q&A sites are promising media. One of the
essential factors in Q&A sites is anonymous submission.
In most Q&A sites, user registrations are required for
those who want to join the Q&A sites. However, registered
users generally need not reveal their real names to submit
messages (questions, problems, answers, comments, etc.).
It is important to submit messages anonymously to a Q&A
site. This is because anonymity gives users chances to submit
messages without regard to shame and reputation. However,
some users abuse the anonymity and attempt to manipulate
communications in a Q&A site. For example, some users use
multiple user accounts and submit messages to a Q&A site
inadequately. Manipulated communications discourage other
submitters, keep users from retrieving good communication
records, and decrease the credibility of the Q&A site. As
a result, it is important to detect users suspected of using
multiple user accounts and manipulating communications in
a Q&A site. In this case, identity tracing based on user ac-
counts is not effective because inadequate users are likely to
hide their true identity to avoid detection. A possible solution
is authorship identiﬁcation based on analyzing stylistic fea-
tures of messages. In recent years, a large number of studies
have been made on authorship identiﬁcation [1] [2] [3] [4]
[5], however, few researchers addressed the identiﬁcation
issues of authors suspected of using multiple user accounts
and manipulating communications in a Q&A site. To solve
this problem, we proposed methods of detecting two kinds
of inadequate multiple account users:
• Multiple account users suspected of submitting ques-
tions and their answers repeatedly [6].
• Multiple account users suspected of submitting many
answers to the same question repeatedly [7].
However, little is known about the purposes and methods
of inadequate multiple account users. As a result, it is
important to investigate these inadequate multiple account
users from various points of view. One example is whether
these inadequate users use multiple user accounts in different
ways. Suppose that one user intends to advocate or justify
his/her submitted answer and uses multiple user accounts as
follows:
• A main account.
• Secondary accounts for advocating or justifying his/her
answer submitted by the main account.
In this case, the deviation of answer submission order is
likely to occur. As a result, we investigate user pairs who
had large deviations of answer submission order and discuss
the reasons why and how the deviations occurred.
By the way, we should notice that it is difﬁcult to verify
the credibility of our investigation. This is because there is
no reliable information about users who used multiple user
accounts and manipulated communications in Q&A sites.
In order to discuss the credibility of our investigation, we
show the results of our investigation in detail. The results
of this study will give us a chance to investigate purposes
and behaviors of users who use multiple user accounts and
intend to manipulate communications in a Q&A site.

this study.
II. RELATED WORKS
One of the essential factors in the Internet is anonymity.
Joinson discussed the anonymity in the Internet from various
points of view [8]. In these days, many users abuse the
anonymity: they use multiple user accounts inadequately
and submit inadequate messages, such as, deceptive opinion
spams. In recent years, a large number of studies have
been made on authorship identiﬁcation [1] [2] [3] [4] [5],
however, few researchers addressed the identiﬁcation issues
of authors suspected of using multiple user accounts and
manipulating communications in the Internet. One of the
difﬁculties of this problem is that we did not have sufﬁcient
number of examples of inadequate multiple account users.
To solve this problem, some researchers tried to extract
inadequate submissions by using heuristic methods based on
text similarities and ranking results [9] [10]. On the other
hand, Ott et al. pointed that these heuristic methods were
insufﬁcient to detect inadequate submissions precisely, and
showed they could detect inadequate submissions precisely
when they used large number of examples of inadequate
submissions [11]. However, Ott et al. obtained examples of
inadequate submissions by using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The examples of inadequate submissions created by workers
in Amazon Mechanical Turk have the following problems.
• Little is known about the purposes and methods of
inadequate submissions. As a result, it is possible that
their instructions to workers in Amazon Mechanical
Turk were insufﬁcient.
• There are unreliable workers in Amazon Mechanical
Turk [12].
As a result, it is important to obtain inadequate submissions
from the Internet. To solve this problem, we proposed meth-
ods of detecting inadequate multiple account users and their
submissions [6] [7]. However, as mentioned, little is known
about the purposes and methods of inadequate multiple
account users. As a result, it is important to investigate
these inadequate multiple account users and their inadequate
submissions from various points of view.
III. YAHOO! CHIEBUKURO
In this study, we used the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro
for observation, data training, and examination. The data
of Yahoo! chiebukuro was published by Yahoo! JAPAN
via National Institute of Informatics in 2007 [13]. This
data consists of about 3.11 million questions and 13.47
million answers which were posted on Yahoo! chiebukuro
from April/2004 to October/2005. In the data, each question
has at least one answer because questions with no answers
were removed. In order to avoid identifying individuals, user
accounts were replaced with unique ID numbers. By using
these ID numbers, we can trace any user’s questions and
answers in the data. Table I shows the numbers of users
and their submitted messages (questions and answers) to PC
category, social issues category, and all 286 categories in the
data. Many users have other users who submitted answers
to one or more of the same questions with them. We will
use the term most frequently encountered user of a certain
user to refer to a user who submitted answers to the same
questions most frequently with the user.
[most frequently encountered user]
Suppose U is a
set of users who submitted answers to the same questions
with user i. The most frequently encountered user of user i,
that is, mfe(i) is deﬁned as follows:
mfe(i) = arg max
j∈U
Nans together(i, j)
where Nans together(i, j) is the number of questions to
which user i and j submitted answers together.
Nmfe in Table I is the total number of each user’s answers
which were submitted with his/her most frequently encoun-
tered user. As a result, it is expected that, when a user

and his/her most frequently encountered user submitted
Nmfe
Nans
× 100 = 74781
403306 × 100 = 18.5
answers together to the same questions.
Furthermore, the following kinds of information are de-
scribed in the data.
• Submission time of question.
• Submission time of answer.
• Problem resolution time.
Figure 1 shows an example of a series of events that
occur after a questioner submits his/her question to Yahoo!
chiebukuro. In Figure 1, the submission time of question
q is tq. Also, the submission time of answer a1 and a2
are ta1 and ta2, respectively. Finally, the problem resolution
time of question q is tpr. At the problem resolution time,
questioner Q stopped accepting answers and determined
which answer was the best answer. By using these kinds
of time information, we measured two kinds of submission
time lags:
• Submission time lags between questions and their an-
swers (e.g., ta1 − tq and ta2 − tq in Figure 1).
• Submission time lags between answers submitted to the
same question (e.g., ta2 − ta1 in Figure 1).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative relative frequency of the
submission time lags between questions and their answers
in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro. Also, Figure 3 shows
the cumulative relative frequency of the submission time
lags between answers submitted to the same question. As
shown in Figure 3, the median of the submission time lags
between answers submitted to the same question in social
issues category was greater than those of PC category and
all 286 categories. In social issues category, there were
many answers criticizing or against previous answers. As a
result, many answerers in this category made and submitted
answers after they read other answers to the same question.
We think this is one of the reasons why the median of the
submission time lags between answers submitted to the same
question in social issues category was greater than those of
PC category and all 286 categories.
IV. SUBMISSIONS BY USING MULTIPLE USER ACCOUNTS
There are many reasons why users in a Q&A site use
multiple user accounts. First, we discuss a proper reason.
In Yahoo! chiebukuro, users need not reveal their real
names to submit their questions and answers. However, their
submissions are traceable because their user accounts are
attached to them. Because of this traceability, we can collect
any user’s submissions and some of them include clues
of identifying individuals. As a result, to avoid identifying
individuals, it is reasonable and proper that users change
their user accounts or use multiple user accounts. However,
Questioner Q submitted question q at tq. Also, answerer A1 and
A2 submitted their answers at ta1 and ta2, respectively. Finally,
questioner Q stopped accepting answers and determined which
answer was the best answer at tpr.

Figure 4.
An example of TYPE QA submissions.
Figure 5.
An example of TYPE AA submissions.
the following types of submissions by using multiple user
accounts are neither reasonable nor proper.
TYPE QA One user submits a question and its
answer by using multiple user accounts, as shown
in Figure 4. In Figure 4, user A submits a question
and its answer by using two user accounts.
We think that the user intended to manipulate
the submission evaluation. For example, in Yahoo!
chiebukuro, each questioner is requested to deter-
mine which answer is best and give a best answer
label to it. These evaluations encourage answerers
to submit new answers and increase the credibility
of the Q&A site. We think, the user repeated this
type of submissions because he/she wanted to get
many best answer labels and be seen as a good
answerer.
TYPE AA One user submits two or more answers
to the same question by using multiple user ac-
counts, as shown in Figure 5. In Figure 5, user C
submits two answers by using two user accounts.
We think that the user intended to dominate or
disrupt communications in the Q&A site. To be
more precise, the user intended to control com-
munications by advocating or justifying his/her
opinions, or disrupt communications by submitting
two or more inappropriate messages.
These two types are not all types of inadequate submis-
sions. However, these kinds of submissions seriously disrupt
communications in a Q&A site, discourage other submitters,
keep users from retrieving good communication records, and
decrease the credibility of the Q&A site. As a result, it is
important to detect these kinds of inadequate submissions.
To solve this problem, we proposed methods of detecting
multiple account users suspected of repeating TYPE QA
and TYPE AA submissions [6] [7]. However, little is known
about the purposes and methods of inadequate multiple
account users. As a result, it is important to investigate these
inadequate multiple account users from various points of
view. In this study, we investigate the purposes and methods
of inadequate multiple account users who use multiple user
accounts in different ways.
Inadequate users repeating TYPE QA submissions are
likely to use multiple user accounts as follows:
• Main accounts.
• Secondary accounts for submitting questions and ma-
nipulating evaluations of main accounts.
However, little is known whether inadequate users repeating
TYPE AA submissions use multiple user accounts somehow.
To solve this problem, it is important to detect inadequate
multiple account users who used multiple user accounts in
different ways and repeated TYPE AA submissions, and
investigate the purposes and methods of them.
If one user uses multiple user accounts in different ways,
some deviations are likely to occur. Suppose that one user
intends to advocate or justify his/her submitted answer and
uses multiple user accounts as follows:
• A main account.
• Secondary accounts for advocating or justifying his/her
answer submitted by the main account.
In this case, the user is likely to submit ﬁrst answers from
his/her main account and other answers from their secondary
accounts. In order to detect this kind of inadequate users, we
introduce deviation of answer submission order.
[deviation of answer submission order] Suppose user i
and user j submitted their answers to the same N questions,
and, user i submitted Ni answers earlier than user j and user
j submitted Nj answers earlier than user i. The deviations
of answer submission order of this user pair is Ni − Nj.
As a result, in this study, we investigate user pairs who
had large deviations of answer submission order and discuss
the reasons why and how the deviations occurred.
In Yahoo! chiebukuro, there were many questions the
purpose of which was to collect opinions. For example,

INTERNET 2012 : The Fourth International Conference on Evolving Internet

(Q)
What do you think about Prime Minister Koizumi?
He has maintained high approval ratings and does
well in his work.
This kind of question often had many answers. Some of
them were criticizing or against previous answers. Because
of such criticizing submissions, some users were likely to
use multiple user accounts and submit new answers for
advocating or justifying their previous answers. We think
some users used multiple user accounts as follows:
• Main accounts.
• Secondary accounts for advocating or justifying their
answer submitted by the main accounts.
This is because it is easy to manage multiple user accounts.
When multiple user accounts were used as above, it is easy
to avoid submitting new answers which were inconsistent
with the previous answers. Inconsistent answers often gave
suspicious impressions to others. However, if multiple user
accounts were used in this way, the deviation of answer
submission order is likely to occur. As a result, in this study,
we investigate user pairs who had large deviations of answer
submission order and discuss the reasons why and how the
deviations occurred.
V. DETECTION OF TOO LARGE DEVIATIONS OF ANSWER
SUBMISSION ORDER
In order to detect users who were suspected of repeating
TYPE AA submissions by using multiple user accounts in
different ways, we introduce two ideas. If one user repeated
TYPE AA submissions too many times by using two user
accounts, user i and user j, it is expected that
(idea 1) user i and user j submit too many answers
to the same questions together.
Furthermore, if the user used these two user accounts in
different ways, it is expected that
(idea 2) there are too large deviations of answer
submission order between user i and user j.
Based on these two ideas, we determine whether users
repeated TYPE AA submissions by using multiple user
accounts in different ways.
A. Detection of user pairs who submitted too many answers
to the same questions
As mentioned, if one person used two user accounts, user
i and user j, and repeated TYPE AA submissions in a Q&A
site too many times, it is expected that we observe abnormal
submissions:
user i submitted abnormally too many answers to
the same questions responded by j.
To detect these abnormal submissions, we test one hypoth-
esis: Hypothesis AA.
[Hypothesis AA]
If user i did not submit abnormally
too many answers to the same questions with user j, we
would expect that user i submitted at most NAA(i) answers
to the same questions with user j.
NAA(i) = Nmfe
Nans
× ans(i)
where ans(i) is the total number of answers submitted by
user i. As shown in Table I, Nans is the total number of
answers submitted to the category, and Nmfe is the total
number of each user’s answers which were submitted with
his/her most frequently encountered user.
If this hypothesis is rejected by an one-sided binomial test,
we determine that user i submitted abnormally too many
answers to the same questions with user j.
B. Detection of user pairs who had too large deviations of
answer submission order
If one user repeated TYPE AA submissions by using two
user accounts, user i and user j, in different ways, it is
expected that we observe
too large deviations of answer submission order
between user i and user j.
To detect too large deviations of answer submission order
between user i and user j, we test one hypothesis: Hypoth-
esis AASO.
[Hypothesis AASO]
Suppose that there are NAA(i, j)
cases where user i and user j submitted their answers to
the same question. If one of these users did not submit
answers too many times before the other did, we would
expect that there are at most NAASO(i, j) cases where one
user submitted his/her answer before the other did.
NAASO(i, j) = PAASO(i, j) × NAA(i, j)
where PAASO(i, j) is the probability that one user submitted
an answer before the other did. In this study, PAASO(i, j)
was set to 0.5. In other words, user i and user j have equal
probability that one user submitted an answer before the
other did.
If this hypothesis is rejected by a two-sided binomial test, we
determine that one of these users, user i or user j, submitted
answers abnormally too many times before the other did.
VI. RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION
In order to detect too large deviations of answer submis-
sion order, we test Hypothesis AA and AASO. In this study,
the target user pairs are 828812 user pairs each of whom
submitted answers to at least one same question in social
issues category of Yahoo! chiebukuro. This is because there
were many discussions between answerers in this category.
As a result, it seems more likely that some multiple account
users intended to advocate or justify their answers and
repeated TYPE AA submissions in this category.
In this experiment, the signiﬁcance level for Hypothesis
AA was extremely low: 0.000005. This is because we intend

time lags between questions and the earlier of their answers of A1 or A2. TAA(A1, A2) is the median of submission time lags between answers of

to detect extreme abnormal submissions. On the other hand,
the signiﬁcance level for Hypothesis AASO was 0.01.
In this experiment, we ﬁrst applied Hypothesis AA on
828812 user pairs in social issues category, and detected
20 user pairs who repeated submitting answers to the same
question too many times. Then, we applied Hypothesis
AASO on these 20 user pairs and detected 7 user pairs
who had too large deviations of answer submission order.
Table II shows the result of the investigation on these 7
user pairs. In Table II, user A1 mainly submitted answers
before user A2 did. NAA(A1, A2) is the number of questions
to which both user A1 and user A2 submitted answers.
NEAA(A1, A2) is the number of questions to which user
A1 submitted answers before user A2 did. TQA(A1, A2)
is the median of submission time lags between questions
and the earlier of their answers of A1 or A2. TAA(A1, A2)
is the median of submission time lags between answers
of A1 and A2 submitted to the same question. Figure 2
showed the cumulative relative frequency of submission time
lags between questions and their answers. Also, Figure 3
showed the cumulative relative frequency of submission time
lags between answers submitted to the same question. By
considering the similarity of writing styles and opinions,
we determined whether each user pair is one and the same
user or not. Decision shows our judgements. We discuss the
following points in detail below.
• Whether each of these seven user pairs is one and the
same user or not.
• The purposes of inadequate multiple account users.
• The reasons why and how the deviations of answer
submission order occurred.
User pair (267614, 76731) submitted many answers to the
questions about foreign residents in Japan. We determined
that user 267614 and 76731 were one and the same user.
This is because their writing styles and opinions were quite
similar and their answers often included special words, for
example, personal HP and comic artists, which other users
did not cover in this category. These accounts were likely
to be used for repeating the same words. For example,
[Q: 654871] I found this exhibitor in the auction [URL].
I think it is against the rule.
[A: 76731] It is scratchbuild. Let it go. You are a snitch.
[A: 267614] You are like a snitch in North Korea. Or a
hound.
We thought there were this kind of inadequate users in
Yahoo! chiebukuro. However, we did not think we found
them by detecting too large deviations of answer submission
order. This is because we did not think of any reasons
why this kind of users used their multiple user accounts
in this way. We are searching more examples of this kind
of inadequate users and intend to ﬁnd the reasons.
Also, in case of user pair (691911, 802184), we de-
termined these users were one and the same user. This
is because the median of submission time lags between
their answers was only 83 seconds although user 691911
submitted answers at different times of a day. Furthermore,
when user 691911 submitted questions, user 691911 selected
user 802184’s answers as best answers in too many times
in various categories. Like the case of user pair (267614,
76731), these accounts were likely to be used for repeating
the same words.
In contrast, in cases of user pair (458523, 518681) and
(414445, 733881), we determined that the users of each
pair were different users. This is because we found many
opinion conﬂict between the users of each pair. Each pair
used Yahoo! chiebukuro almost at the same time of each day.
For example, user 458523 and 518681 mainly used Yahoo!
chiebukuro from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. Also, user 414445
and 733881 mainly used Yahoo! chiebukuro from 8:00 pm
to 1:00 am. As a result, the users of each pair read questions
almost at the same time. On the other hand, the median
of submission time lags from questions to user 458523’s
answers and user 518681’s answers were 9.9 minutes and
28 minutes, respectively. Also, the median of submission
time lags from questions to user 414445’s answers and
user 733881’s answers were 7.4 minutes and 66 minutes,
56

INTERNET 2012 : The Fourth International Conference on Evolving Internet

respectively. We think, these time lags gave the deviations
of answer submission order between the users of each user
pair.
Both user pair (649164, 622996) and (471690, 471692)
submitted answers repeatedly to questions about a certain
religious group. We determined that the users of each pair
were one and the same users. This is because they had
similar writing styles and opinions respectively. Especially,
there was only one opinion conﬂict between user 649164
and 622996 just after they were pointed out that they were
one and the same user. These accounts were likely to be
used for criticizing other users’ answers, or advocating or
justifying their previous answers. In these cases, user 622996
and 471692 mainly criticized other user’s answers, and
advocated or justiﬁed their previous answers. As shown in
Table II, user 622996 and 471692 mainly submitted their
answers after user 649164 and 471690 did, respectively. In
both cases, two user accounts were used in different ways
as follows:
• Main accounts (user 649164 and 471690).
• Secondary accounts (user 622996 and 471692) for crit-
icizing other users’ answers, or advocating or justifying
answers submitted by the main accounts.
Especially, user 471692 often criticized user 622996’s an-
swers. As a result, user pair (622996, 471692) was detected
although the users of this pair were different users and had
different opinions.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this study, we investigated the user pairs who had large
deviations of answer submission order and discussed the rea-
sons why and how the deviations occurred. In social issues
category of Yahoo! chiebukuro, we found four user pairs
suspected of being one and the same users and submitting
many answers to the same questions repeatedly by using
multiple user accounts in different ways. The purposes of
these users seemed to be
• To repeat the same words.
• To criticize other users’ answers which were against
their answers.
• To advocate or justify their previous answers.
We intend to use the results of this study for further inves-
tigation of purposes and behaviors of inadequate multiple
account users in Q&A sites. Especially, we think, opinion
similarity is a promising clue to the detection of inadequate
users and the investigation of their purposes and behaviors.
