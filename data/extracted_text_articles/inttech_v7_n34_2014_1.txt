Abstract—In this study, we compare answers in a Q&A site
with messages in a micro blog and discuss how we use unsounded
code strings at the end of online messages. We ﬁrst show that
unsounded code strings at the end of answers in a Q&A site
are used for not only smooth communication but an other
purpose, minimum length limit avoidance. Next, we show that
the length of unsounded code strings at the end of answers in
a Q&A site, which are used for smooth communication, have a
similar distribution pattern to those at the end of messages in
a micro blog. On the other hand, the length of unsounded code
strings used for minimum length limit avoidance have a different
distribution pattern. Furthermore, we compare frequently used
unsounded code strings at the end of answers in a Q&A site
with those at the end of messages in a micro blog. Finally,
we show our results are useful to analyze users’ messages in
online communities. In this study, we used the data of Yahoo!
chiebukuro, a widely-used Japanese Q&A site, and Twitter for
observation and examination.
Keywords—unsounded code string, micro blog, Twitter, Q&A site,

INTRODUCTION
We often ﬁnd consecutive unsounded marks and characters
are used at the end of online messages, such as mails, chattings,
and questions and answers in Q&A sites. As a result, it is
important to investigate how these expressions were used.
(exp 1)
sound recorder demo aru teido ha dekiru kedo,
yappari Sound Engine ga osusume kana... (You
may be able to do a lot by using sound recorders,
however, the one I would like to recommend is
Sound Engine...)
(exp 1) is an answer submitted to a Japanese Q&A site, Yahoo!
chiebukuro. In this case, periods are used consecutively at the
end of it. It is probable that the answerer of (exp 1) used the
three consecutive periods for expressing his/her opinion gently,
in other words, for smooth communication. In this study, we
deﬁne unsounded marks and characters as unsounded codes.
Furthermore, we deﬁne three or more consecutive unsounded
codes as unsounded code strings. For example, in Yahoo!
chiebukuro, 25 % of answers have unsounded code strings,
in other words, three or more consecutive unsounded codes at
the end of them. Although unsounded code strings are popular,
there are few studies on them. As a result, we investigated how
we use unsounded code strings at the end of online messages
[1]. In the report, we compared answers in a Q&A site with
messages in a micro blog and discussed how we use unsounded
code strings at the end of online messages. We used the data
of Yahoo! chiebukuro [2], a widely-used Japanese Q&A site,
and Twitter [3] for observation and examination. In this study,
we review our previous report and show the new results of
our study. Especially, we compare frequently used unsounded
code strings at the end of answers in a Q&A site with those
at the end of messages in a micro blog. The results of this
study will give us a chance to understand not only the usage
of unsounded code strings in online messages but the purposes
and behaviors of users in online communities. Especially, the
results can be useful to analyze the impacts of communication
constraints on users’ messages and communications. In this
paper, we show our results are useful to analyze the impacts
of the minimum length limit in Yahoo! chiebukuro on users’
messages and communications.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II,
we surveys the related works. In Section III, we describe how
unsounded code strings are used at the end of answers in a
Q&A site. On the other hand, in Section IV, we describe how
unsounded code strings are used at the end of messages in a
micro blog. Furthermore, we compare unsounded code strings
at the end of answers in a Q&A site with those at the end of
messages in a micro blog. In Section V, we show our results
are useful to analyze users’ messages in online communities.
Finally, in Section VI, we present our conclusions.

RELATED WORKS
Yamamoto pointed out that the number of users in commu-
nication media for exchanging short text messages has been
increasing rapidly [4]. One good example is Twitter. Twitter
has succeeded in winning the hearts and minds of many users.
The reason is to limiting the message length to 140 characters.
By limiting the message length to 140 characters, Twitter
has succeeded in encouraging users to submit many messages
quickly and enhancing their communications. As a result, in
order to develop new communication media technology, we

should investigate short text messages. For example, online
messages in Twitter consist of
•
strings for reference (URL, username, hashtag, etc.),
•
utterable words, and
•
unsounded code strings.
Unsouded code strings are used frequently in short text mes-
sages. However, there are few studies on unsounded code
strings, except emoticons. As a result, in order to develop new
communication media technology, it is important to investigate
unsounded code strings.
Emoticons, sometimes called face marks, are a kind of
unsounded code strings. First emoticon, smiley face “;-)”, was
proposed by Scott Fahlman in September 1982 [5]. After his
proposal, many emoticons have been used widely in online
messages, such as email, chat, and newsgroup posts [6]. As a
result, a large number of studies have been made on emoticons.
Many researchers in computational linguistics proposed
methods of extracting and classifying emoticons in online
messages. Inoue et al. analyzed 1,000 sentences in email
messages and developed a system which extracted emotional
expressions, especially emoticons, embedded in email mes-
sages [7]. Nakamura et al. proposed a method of learning
emoticons for a natural language dialogue system from chat
dialogue data in the Internet [8]. Tanaka et al. proposed
methods for extracting emoticons in text and classifying them
into some emotional categories [9]. Bedrick et al. proposed
robust emoticon detection method based on weighted context-
free grammars [10]. Hogenboom et al. showed that sentiment
classiﬁcation accuracy was improved by using manually cre-
ated emoticon sentiment lexicon [11].
On the other hand, many researchers in social science
analyzed how we use emoticons in online messages. Wit-
mer and Katzman reported that women use more graphic
accents (emoticons) than men do in their computer-mediated
communication (CMC) [12]. Walther and D’Addario showed
that emoticons’ contributions were outweighed by verbal
content [13]. Derks et al. reported emoticons are useful in
strengthening the intensity of a verbal message [14]. Byron
and Baldridge reported readers were likely to rate sender’s
emails more likeable if they used emoticons [15]. Harada
discussed how Japanese speakers use emoticons for promoting
communication smoothly from the viewpoint of politeness
[16]. Kato et al. analyzed positive and negative emoticons
and reported that negative emoticons are misinterpreted more
frequently than positive ones [17]. Furthermore, Kato et al.
reported that emoticons are used more frequently between
close friends than ordinary acquaintances [18].
We think emoticons are a kind of unsounded code strings,
however, there are few studies on other kinds of unsounded
code strings. As a result, we should investigate not only
emoticons but other kinds of unsounded code strings. The

III.
UNSOUNDED CODE STRINGS AT THE END OF
ANSWERS IN A Q&A SITE
In this section, we discuss unsounded code strings at the
end of answers submitted to a Q&A site.
Before we deﬁne a unsounded code string, we explain the
data of Yahoo! chiebukuro, which we used for investigating
unsounded code strings in a Q&A site. Yahoo! chiebukuro is
a Japanese version of Yahoo! answers and one of the most
popular Q&A sites in Japan. In Yahoo! chiebukuro, each user
can submit his/her answer only one time to one question. Each
questioner is requested to determine which answer to his/her
question is best. The selected answer is called best answer.
The data of Yahoo! chiebukuro was published by Yahoo!
JAPAN via National Institute of Informatics in 2007 [19].
This data consists of about 3.11 million questions and 13.47
million answers which were posted on Yahoo! chiebukuro
from April/2004 to October/2005. In the data, each question
has at least one answer because questions with no answers
were removed. In order to avoid identifying individuals, user
accounts were replaced with unique ID numbers. By using
these ID numbers, we can trace any user’s questions and
answers in the data. Table I shows the numbers of questioners
and answerers in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro. Table II shows
the numbers of their questions and answers in the data of
Yahoo! chiebukuro.
Next, we deﬁne an unsounded code and unsounded code
strings. In this study, we deﬁne that an unsounded code
string is three or more consecutive unsounded codes. In this
study, unsounded codes are limited to the following marks and
characters:
•
punctuation marks,
•
Greek characters,
•
Cyrillic characters, and
•
ruled lines.
These marks and characters are generally unsounded when
they are used at the end of Japanese sentences. We observed
unsounded code strings at the end of answers submitted to
Yahoo! chiebukuro, and found they were used for

The minimum length limit was introduced into Yahoo!
chiebukuro in May/2004. Due to this limit, users in Yahoo!
chiebukuro are prohibited from submitting answers less than
25 multibyte characters long. Makoto Okamoto [20], a former
producer of Yahoo! chiebukuro, said that this rule was intro-
duced for avoiding less informative answer submissions. In
this rule, one single byte character is counted as 0.5 multibyte
character. In order to avoid this limit, the answerer of (exp 3)
used 13 “!” at the end of his/her answer. We may note that,
in case of Japanese texts, the length of words and sentences
are generally counted by multibyte characters. In this study,
single byte characters are counted as 0.5 multibyte characters.
We count characters in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro by using
programming language Perl (version 5.14.2) [21] on Ubuntu
linux (version 12.04) [22].
As shown in Table I, there are 183,242 users each of whom
submitted at least one answer to Yahoo! chiebukuro. Figure 1
shows the proportion and number of users who used unsounded
code strings at the end of their answers. As shown in Table
II, 13,477,785 answers were submitted to Yahoo! chiebukuro,
and 3,116,009 of them were selected as best answers. Figure
2 shows the proportion and number of answers that have
unsounded code strings at the end of them. On the other hand,
Figure 3 shows the proportion and number of best answers
that have unsounded code strings at the end of them.

tion of

the length of unsounded code strings.
As shown in Figure 4, the median of the length of unsounded
code strings at the end of answers is 10 multibyte characters.
This value is more than twice the length of unsounded code
strings at the end of (exp 1) and (exp 2). We think that it is too
long for smooth communication. As a result, we investigate the
association between the length of

unsounded code string at the end of answers and
•
the other part of them.
The result is shown in Figure 5. In Figure 5, the heatmap
shows the association between the length of unsounded code

in other words, the length of the answers are frequently 25–

long, unsounded code strings at the end of the answers are
mainly 3–5 multibyte characters long, and the answers come in
a variety of lengths. It may be said that the usage of unsounded
code strings at the end of answers differs greatly depending on
whether the other part of the answers are less than 25 multibyte
characters long. As a result, we divided answers that have

Figure 7, the length of these answers (excluding unsounded
code strings at the end of them) have a distribution similar to
those of all the answers submitted to Yahoo! chiebukuro. As
a result, it may be said that, when the length of answers are
25 multibyte characters or longer (excluding unsounded code
strings at the end of them), the length of these answers are
less affected by whether unsounded code strings are used at
the end of them. We compare these unsounded code strings
with those used at the end of online messages in Twitter.
Finally, we discuss frequently used unsounded code strings
at the end of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro. Table IV shows
the top 40 most frequently used unsounded code strings at
the end of answers the length of which are less than 25
multibyte characters (excluding unsounded code strings at

most frequently used unsounded code strings are classiﬁed
into two types of consecutive multibyte characters, consecutive
Japanese periods, such as “

of emoticons or parts of emoticons are ranked in the top 40
most frequently used unsounded code strings at the end of
normal tweets. These emoticons occupy 36.5 % of all the
unsounded code strings ranked in the top 40 most frequently
used unsounded code strings at the end of normal tweets. On
the other hand, as shown in Table VIII, 29 kinds of emoticons
or parts of emoticons are ranked in the top 40 most frequently
used unsounded code strings at the end of replies. These
emoticons occupy 67.3 % of all the unsounded code strings
ranked in the top 40 most frequently used unsounded code
strings at the end of replies. As a result, emoticons are used
more frequently at the end of replies than at the end of normal
tweets. In other words, emoticons are used more frequently at
the end of tweets to particular persons than at the end of tweets
to general public.

DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we show our results are useful to analyze the
impacts of communication constraints on users’ messages and
communications. We take the minimum length limit in Yahoo!
chiebukuro for example.
After the minimum length limit was introduced, users in Ya-
hoo! chiebukuro have been prohibited from submitting answers
less than 25 multibyte characters long. However, our study
showed 1,745,797 answers, that is, 13.0 % of all the answers
in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro, were less than 25 multibyte
characters (excluding unsounded code strings at the end of
them). These answers were submitted by 52,998 users, that is,
28.9 % of all the answerers in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro. It
shows that many users in Yahoo! chiebukuro wanted to submit
short answers. Furthermore, our study showed unsounded code
strings used for smooth communication are mainly 3–5 multi-
byte characters long. We therefore classify these 1,745,797
answers into two types:
•
1,642,866 answers the unsounded code strings at the end
of which were more than 5 characters long, and
•
102,931 answers the unsounded code strings at the end
of which were 3-5 characters long.
In the former case, most of the unsounded code strings were
thought to be used for minimum length limit avoidance. These
unsounded code strings were often unﬁt for the contents of
answers and gave poor impressions to questioners. As a result,
the best answer ratio of these 1,642,866 answers was 10.8 %
while that of all the answers in the data of Yahoo! chiebukuro
was 23.1 %. On the other hand, in the latter case, some
of the unsounded code strings were thought to be used for
smooth communication. However, the best answer ration of
these 102,931 answers was 12.4 %. As a result, in both cases,
the best answer ratios were lower than that of all the answers.
This result shows short answers are often less informative
than long answers, in other words, the minimum length limit
is reasonable. However, we should not overlook the positive
factor of short answers. Ohsawa et al. reported that short and
less informative submissions sometimes promote constructive
discussions in web-based bulletin boards [24]. As a result,
it is probable that some short and less informative answers
stimulate other answerers to submit their good answers and
enhance communications in Yahoo! chiebukuro.
VI.
CONCLUSION
In this study, we investigated unsounded code strings at the
end of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro and tweets in Twitter.
Although unsounded code strings are popular, there were few
studies on them.
In Twitter, unsounded code strings at the end of tweets are
used for smooth communication. On the other hand, in Yahoo!
chiebukuro, unsounded code strings at the end of answers
are used for not only smooth communication but minimum
length limit avoidance. The minimum length limit is a special
problem in Yahoo! chiebukuro, not introduced into Twitter. We
showed that the usage of unsounded code strings at the end
of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro differs greatly depending on
whether answers are longer than the minimum length limit.
When answers are longer than the minimum length limit,
unsounded code strings at the end of them are used for smooth
communication. In this case, the length of the unsounded code
strings at the end of answers have a similar distribution pattern
to the length of unsounded code strings at the end of tweets.
Unsounded code strings at the end of the tweets in Twitter
and answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro, which are longer than the
minimum length limit, are mainly 3–5 multibyte characters
long. In addition, we showed the length of replies in Twitter
and answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro, which are larger than the
minimum length limit, are less affected by whether unsounded
code strings are used at the end of them. Furthermore, we
showed frequently used unsounded code strings at the end
of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro and tweets in Twitter. We
showed that emoticons were not used frequently at the end
of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro. On the other hand, they
were used frequently at the end of tweets in Twitter, especially,
replies. The difference is whether messages are submitted to
familiar persons or not. In other words, emoticons are used
more frequently at the end of messages which are sent to
familiar persons than to strangers and general public. Finally,
we took the minimum length limit in Yahoo! chiebukuro for
example and showed our results could be useful to analyze the
impacts of communication constraints on users’ messages and
communications.
In this study, we analyzed and compared unsounded code
strings at the end of answers in Yahoo! chiebukuro and
Japanese tweets in Twitter. However, it is not enough to obtain
general knowledge about unsounded code strings. It is because
we have found many unsounded code strings not only in
Japanese tweets but also in other language tweets, for example,
English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and so on. We intend to
study the usages of unsounded code strings in these languages
and compare them with the usage of Japanese unsounded code
strings. We think the results of our future work are useful to
provide new multilingual communication services.
