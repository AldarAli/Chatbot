Abstract—Analyzing the social roles inside on-line communi-
ties became a big challenge nowadays. The on-line communities
formed around exchange platforms (e.g., forums) create an
increasing source of data for analyzing user’s behavior. This
paper proposes an exploratory analysis of communities in news
website based on its sub-communities. Actually, we assume that
people who participate in forum debate in news websites focus
their participation in one or a very few topics (also called
context), i.e., they formed the sub-communities. These sub-
communities, will help us to ﬁnd the contextual celebrity: the
pertinent users in the sub-communities. We based our analysis
on a dataset composed by 11,143 users writing more than
35,000 posts on 57 different forums grouped in 3 topics, and
on social networks enriched with relations extracted from the
content of the users’ posts.
Keywords-Social role; Social network; On-line community.
I. INTRODUCTION
During the Roman era, the forum was the public place of
the city, i.e., the social, political and economic center. The
forum allowed people to communicate, exchange, debate and
socialize. Forums still exist nowadays in a different way:
thanks to the forums on the Web 2.0, users communicate
interactively on a common interest.
People who participate in these forums (also called users)
form an on-line community. Schoberth et al. [1] use this term
“to describe the communication and social interaction that
is seen in the Internet and web-based list servers, bulletin
boards, Usenet newsgroups and chats”. We can complete
the deﬁnition with the one given by Hymnes [2] about the
speech community which represents “a group of people who
share rules for the conduct and the interpretation of speech,
and rules for the interpretation of at least one linguistic
variety”. So, people who participate in forums form an
on-line speech community. People in this on-line speech
community, as in the real life [3], play a social role, as deﬁne
in [4] “beside having personalities, by being part of the
social group, people occupy positions in the social structures
of groups that allow them to do and say certain things, as
well as constrain them from saying or doing other thing”.
Golder and Donath follow the Goffman’s theory [3] through
which a role represents the “rights and duties attached to a
given status”. Still, in a Goffman’s position, Gleave et al.
[5] specify that a social role can only be apprehended in the
interaction, i.e., people play a role depending on others.
In this paper, we focus on the understanding of sub-
communities (from a whole community) in order to ﬁnd
good clues to comprehend the contextual celebrity social
role. We deﬁne a sub-community as a sub-part of a whole
community depending on a topic (also called context). In
other words, a sub-community represents all the users who
participate in a speciﬁc topic in a news website (e.g., politic,
media, etc.). We assume that users participate in one a
very few topics in their interest. So, the contextual celebrity
represents a user particularly interested in a speciﬁc kind of
topic compared to the whole on-line speech community. This
user is recognized as a pertinent one by the other members
of his sub-community.
So, the contributions of this paper are to explore an on-line
community based on the analysis of the sub-communities
which belong to it. The general idea is to conﬁrm that
users participate depending on a context and ﬁnd some
clues to detect the contextual celebrity for each kind of sub-
communities. Note that, in this paper, we use the term topic
or context independently.
This paper is organized as follow: ﬁrst, we explain some
related work and we position our work according to the
existent one. Then, we describe the dataset we use to make
the analysis of the social role inside sub-communities. We
continue by brieﬂy presenting the construction of our en-
riched social network using the structure and the content of
the data. Finally, we explore the on-line speech community
with its sub-communities and the concept of contextual
celebrity social role.
A. Related Work
The social role analysis was highlighted by Goffman in
[3]. According to his theory, human being adopts a “pre-
established pattern of action, which is unfolded during a
performance and which may be presented or played through
on other occasions”. According to him, individuals play
a role during the interaction. This notion had a great
17

repercussion through the apparition of Web 2.0 and the
emergence of new media of exchange. Some researchers
used database of email exchange and probabilistic model
as blockmodel to deﬁne some social roles in ﬁrms [6][7][8].
Other researchers looked at predeﬁned roles as the expert [9]
(who is the most expert?) or the inﬂuencers in social network
[10][11] (who gets the power to convince people in the social
network). In an other perspective, computer scientists and
sociologists found a great interest to analyze the social roles
in forum debates. Their works aim to extract social roles
as a predeﬁned behavior in the on-line speech community
using a social network analysis and the user participation
behavior. This double analysis allows to capture the place
of the user inside the community based on his implication
and his reputation. Golder and Donath made an ethnological
study and found out six kinds of social roles: the celebrity,
the newbie, the lurker, the ﬂamer, the troll and the ranter
(refers to [4] for the deﬁnitions). These social roles can
be positive (e.g., the celebrity) or negative (e.g., the ﬂamer
or the troll). This ethnological approach considers that a
content analysis of the posts brings a lot of informations. In
our work, we use a content approach to extract our social
network with the aim to deﬁne the social roles. We will
see in Section I-C how we enrich our social network with
new relations extracted from the content of the discussion.
Others social roles have been discovered in this on-line
speech community as the answer people and the discussion
people [12]. In a political discussion context, Himelboim
et al. [13] looked for the discussion catalyst. This kind of
users inﬂuences the information that enters in a newsgroup
and affect the discussion evolution within it. Kelly et al.
[14] found three social roles in this kind of discussion: the
friends, the foes and the fringes. The authors highlighted
that people prefer to speak to users who are in another
political afﬁliation than themselves. The great majority of
the users in political discussion looks for virulent debate
on society and way of life. Furthermore, the authors found
the fringe social role which refers to a marginal group of
people that raises interesting questions for qualitative study.
Fisher et al. [15] took more largely into account the context
of participation to analyze social roles. According to them,
the user’s participation is different if he participates in help
forums opposed to a ﬂame forums. Their idea makes us
think that in Usenet, there are some specialized forums for
ﬂame, for help etc. But in a news website the conﬁguration
of participation is quite different, there is no specialized
forum as in Usenet, but there are some topics where users
are more interested to debate in. Very close to our work,
Angeletou et al. [16] and Chan et al. [17] explain some on-
line sub-communities by their composition of users roles, but
each sub-community represents one community: there is no
overlapping, no confrontation between the sub-communities.
In this paper, the context of participation is represented by
the topic which the forum belongs to, e.g., politic, media,
living, etc. So, we propose a new way to understand social
role depending on the context in on-line sub-communities.
Finally, we refer the reader to Gleave et al. [5] and Forestier
et al. [18] in order to have a larger state of the art and
analysis about social roles.
B. Dataset introspection
In this section, we present the data we used to ana-
lyze the sub-communities and the contextual celebrity. We
based our analysis on the forums of the HufﬁngtonPost
(www.hufﬁngtonpost.com) news website. We extracted 57
forums dealing with three topics, i.e., context: politic, living
and media. The dataset is composed of 19 forums of each
topic. The whole dataset contains 11,443 users and 35,175
posts. Table I presents the basic statistics on each topic.
The overlapping of the sub-communities implies that the
sum of the users from the three sub-communities is upper
than 11,443 users. Note that the on-line speech community
represents all the users and we are looking to the contextual
celebrity in sub-communities (communities depending on a
context).

Table I shows that it exists in all sub-communities a hard
core of speciﬁc users, i.e., users who participate only in
one topic. Furthermore, the ratio between the number of
posts and the number of users is quite the same in the three
sub-communities. Users in living topic (respectively media
topic) post an average of 2.3 messages (respectively 2.4).
In politic forum, the ratio is a little bigger, i.e. 2.8, posts
per user. Most of the users concentrates their participation
on one topic and for each sub-community, at least half of
the users post just one post in one topic. This comportment
seems really interesting and, even if this is not the object of
this paper, and in a perspective way, the study the behavior of
these users through the sub-communities and in a temporal
way, can be really interesting.

The three sub-communities follow the same rule of par-
ticipation: most of the users posts less than six messages.
There is a real gap between people who write less than
six messages and those who write more. For each sub-
community, an average of 6% of the user post between ﬁve
and ten messages. Finally, a very few users posts more than
ten messages in a topic. The contextual celebrity is being
more likely among them.
Figure 1.
Overlapping of the tree topics
Figure 1 shows the overlapping of the sub-communities.
The bold numbers represent the attributes of the politic sub-
community, the underlined numbers represents the attributes
of the living sub-communities and the ones in italic represent
the attributes of the media sub-community. So, the numbers
underlined, in bold and in italic represent the percentages for
the whole community. The living (underlined on Figure 1)
sub-community represents 30% of the community. Inside the
living sub-community, 68% of the users participates only in
this topic (it corresponds to 22% of the whole community).
The statistics are quite the same in the two others sub-
communities. A very few users participates in living topic
and an other topic (9% of the users in living sub-community
participates also in the politic topic (in bold), and 13%
in both living and media topics (in italic). This minority
represents only 3% and 4% of the whole community. Note
that less than 30% of the media sub-community wrote at
least one post in politic. These two sub-communities seem
to be closer than the politic and living sub-communities.
Finally, only 3% of the population participates in the three
topics (it represents 9% of the users of living, 8% of politic
and 6% of media sub-community). In conclusion, only 21%
of the users participate in more than one topic.
C. Enriched social network
Web forums have the particularity that they structure the
debate. Users who participate can, using this structure, reply
to the post they want to reply to. This structure is used
to extract social networks in existent works treating social
roles [9][12][13][15]. But, reading the forums shows that
people not only interact using the structure (reply to) but also
through quotations. We ﬁnd two kinds of quotations: the text
quotation and the name quotation [19]. These two quotations
allow an user to reply to several ones through one post;
and people who read the forum automatically understand
when an author is quoted (by the name, or by the quotation
of a previous post). The idea is when a person quotes the
name of another one, he adopts certain community codes and
he considers himself to be entitled to refer to the person
by his pseudonym, e.g., a newbie (i.e., new user) never
feels the right to call other users by their pseudonym. So
quoting the name implies the user’s integration in the on-
line speech community. The text quotation relation brings
some important information during the analysis. Actually,
more a user quotes another, more these two users are linked.
Furthermore, the text quotation frequently implies a precise
conversation between the two users, i.e., if I quote a part of
your post, I really reply to you, and in most of case I argue
your discourse with an opinion. To make a ﬁner interaction
analysis, we wanted that the analyze taking into account
these quotations in a an automatically way. So, we created
an enriched social network where users can be linked by
three relations:
• The structural: a user replies to another one using the
structure of the forum;
• The name quotation: when a user quotes the name of
an other user in his post;
• The text quotation: when a user quotes a part of a
previous post in his post.
Finally, we have three separates but complementary social
networks, i.e., one social network for one kind of relation.
Each of this social networks give some clues to understand
the user behavior. The social network constructed with the
name quotation relation gives some informations about the
user’s reputation: is he known by his sub-community? Is
he often quoted? Is he often quotes? The social network
constructed with the text quotation relation give some others
clues: does the user like to debate? Does he bring some
interesting informations to debate?
Our model reaches a quite good score in term of pre-
cision (ratio between number of quotations found by both
evaluators and system compared to the number of quotations
found by the system). We refer the reader to [19] for more
information about the social network extraction.
Figure 2 shows the three separate social networks. We
used the Jung Java toolkit for SNA to build the graphs. The
social networks on Figure 2 are built only with users having
written more than 15 posts in all the dataset. The gray scale
of nodes represents the kind of forum a user participates in.
Black nodes make the connection between subgraph of gray

users (users who participate only in one kind of forum).
We can also see that name quotation (b) is used more
than the text quotation relation (c) by user who participate
in the whole website. Referring to Table II, the name
quotation represents the double of the text quotation (994
name quotations against 476 text quotations). The media
sub-community uses more the name quotations compared
to the two others sub-communities, we can interpret this
result as a closer sub-community, i.e., the users of the media
sub-community know better the others who participate in it.
Surprisingly, it is not the users who post the most in a topic
who quote or are quoted the most. This result is important
concerning the detection of the contextual celebrity: users
who are quoted by the name and the text and who post a lot
of messages have more chance to be recognized by the others
and to have a good reputation [20] in their sub-communities.
II. A NEW SYSTEM TO ANALYZE SUB-COMMUNITIES
AND SOCIAL ROLES
As we saw in Section I-A, social role analysis became
an important research study. Nowadays, it seems really
important to understand who is who in the on-line speech
communities. But, as we saw before in these works, most
of the researchers use Usenet to extract social roles. The
fact is that forums on news websites become increasingly
generic while Usenet is quite speciﬁc. Furthermore, news
websites allow users to treat several kinds of forums, e.g.,
politic, societal, etc. and the social role is dependent of
the context[3][5]. The goal, here, is to retrieve social roles
depending on the context, i.e., the kind of forum treated.
Finally, the three relations between users (see Section I-C)
allow a ﬁner perception of the interaction. These relations
will help us to a better extraction of the social roles.
Figure 3.
Presentation of the system
Figure 3 shows the process of our system from the website
to the analysis. First of all, we collect the forums from the
website using a parser. Note that the parser is speciﬁc for
each website. The parser retrieves the forum topic, the users
pseudonyms, the posts and the structural relation, i.e., which
post replies to which one? Who replies to whom? Then,
the system analyzes the content of the posts in order to
extract the name and the text quotation relations. All the data
is scored in a database. Finally, using the enriched social
network (with the relations extracted from the content of
posts) and the user’s participation behavior, we analyze the
social role based on the context, i.e., the topic of the forum.
We will present in the next section the way we choose to
analyze the social roles taking into account the context and

the kind of relations between users.
III. SUB-COMMUNITIES AND SOCIAL ROLE ANALYSIS
To analyze the sub-communities and to ﬁnd the contextual
celebrity(ies), we decided to perform a principal component
analysis (PCA)[21]. This unsupervised method aims to cre-
ate a new description space of the data. We use Tanagra [22]
to compute the PCA.
A. Criteria of analysis
We created several criteria to analyze the on-line com-
munity in a contextual perspective. These criteria are based
on the individual’s behavior and the analysis of the social
network. We calculate for each individual who participate in
the forums:
• Number of politic / living / media forums the user
participates in;
• Number of posts in politic / living / media forums;
• In-degree with the structural relation function of the
topic;
• Out-degree with the structural relation function of the
topic.
So, each user is deﬁned by 12 criteria measuring the
user’s interest in the topics and his place inside the sub-
communities. Actually, the participation is comprehended by
the user’s participation behavior metrics; and his place inside
the sub-community by his place in the social network using
the in-degree and out-degree with the structural relation.
These criteria allow us to create an unsupervised method
to explore the on-line speech community.
B. Principal Component Analysis
The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) consists in
transforming the criteria of analysis (see Section III-A) in
new variables, each independent of each other. The aim of
this method is to create a new space where the dimensions
are not correlated one to the other. It also allows to reduce
the information description to a limited number of compo-
nents, less than the initial number of criteria of analysis.
PCA is really interesting for several reasons. First of all,
we want to explore the sub-communities in a unsupervised
way. The social role of the users depends on the interest
of the user for one topic and his place inside the sub-
community. We expect that PCA ﬁnds three groups (one
group for each topic) that are not correlated one to the others.
Furthermore, this is an unsupervised method of analysis
because our dataset does not allow the usage of supervised
methods: we do not have labels to learn rather we have to
discover and interpret the knowledge from the data. Finally,
this old method (more than one century) made proof of its
performance and it is still used today.
The ﬁrst three axes found by the PCA resume 75% of the
knowledge contained in the data. The fourth axis only adds
5% of supplementary information, so we keep the ﬁrst three
axes. Note that a resume of 75% of information is a quite
good score for real data.
The ﬁrst axis is described on the positive part by the
politic topic: number of posts, in- and out-degree with the
structural relation. On the negative side, the axis is described
by the living topic. The second axis is constructed on
the positive part with the politic forum. The third axis is
constructed with all the criteria concerning the media topic.
This construction proves that the on-line speech community
is divided into sub-communities function of the topic. Nev-
ertheless, the sub-communities are not completely separate
(otherwise the PCA gives some correlations about one) and
some users being part of several sub-communities.
Figure 4 represents the correlation scatter plot created
with the two ﬁrst axis of the PCA. The three forums are
visibly separated. We have on the top left of the graphic the
forums about living, on the bottom right the forums dealing
with media and on the top right the forums dealing with
the politic. This graphic proves that individuals have certain
behavior depending on the kind of forum they participate in.
Figure 4 shows that the angle between the living topic and
the media topic is about 180◦ function of the gravity center
(see the right line on ﬁgure 4 between the two groups). It
means that it exists a negative correlation between the two
groups. In other words, the more the users participate in
forums dealing with media topic, the less they participate
in living topic and vice versa. In another way, the politic
topic is almost on a right angle compared to both media and
living forums. There is a statistical independence between
the politic topic compared to the media and the living topic.
The PCA does not ﬁnd a correlation between them. It seems
that the participation in the politic topic does not inﬂuence
the participation in media and/or living topic.
Finally, the PCA conﬁrms that users mostly participate
in one kind of topic (i.e., in a context). To ﬁnd who are
the contextual celebrities we propose to ﬁnd users who
maximize all the criteria on one topic and who have no
or very few participation in the others. So, in a perspective
way, we are thinking to use multicriteria aggregation so that
we ﬁnd not just one contextual celebrity per topic but a list

of contextual celebrities for each sub-community.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
This paper presents a new exploratory approach to under-
stand on-lines communities based on its sub-communities
and give good clues to comprehend the contextual celebrity
in these sub-communities. A lot of people interact on news
websites, this media became increasingly widespread, the
dimensionality of data makes it difﬁcult to comprehend. We
use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to understand
how people interact starting from the hypothesis that people
focus their participation in one or a very few topics (i.e.,
context) and not in the website as a whole. The PCA
conﬁrmed this hypothesis. This exploratory method ﬁnds
three kinds of groups deﬁned by the kind of context the
users participates in.
The contextual celebrity, i.e., a user who participates in
one kind of topic and be recognized by his sub-community
as a pertinent user, needs to maximize the criteria in one
topic. Furthermore, using an enriched social network allows
a ﬁner perception of the real interaction between users
and brings interesting informations to characterize the com-
munity, the sub-communities and the contextual celebrity
himself.
In perspective, we want to extract the contextual celebrity
and evaluate the model using a temporal evaluation. We are
also interested in the analysis of the users who participate a
few (one post) in one topic Who are these people? Why do
they participate so little?
