Abstract—The problem of user selection and resource allo-
cation for the downlink of wireless systems operating over a
frequency-selective channel is investigated. It is assumed that the
Base Station (BS) uses many antennas, whereas a single antenna
is available to each user (Multiple Input Single Output - MISO
case). To relieve heavy computational burden, a suboptimal, but
efﬁcient algorithm is devised that is based on Zero Forcing
(ZF) beamforming. The algorithm maximizes the sum of the
users’ data rates subject to constraints on total available power
and individual data rate requirements for each user. Simulation
results are provided to indicate that the algorithm can satisfy the
fairness criterion. Thus, the algorithm can be applied to latest-
generation wireless systems that provide Quality-of-Service (QoS)
guarantees.
Index Terms—MISO, OFDMA, resource allocation, Zero-
Forcing, minimum data rate constraints.
I. INTRODUCTION
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
[1] is a multi-user version of the popular Orthogonal Fre-
quency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) digital modulation
scheme. In OFDMA, multiple access is achieved by ﬁrst
dividing the spectrum of interest into a number of subcarriers
and then assigning subsets of the subcarriers to individual
users. OFDMA helps exploit multiuser diversity in frequency-
selective channels, since it is very likely that some subcarriers
that are “bad” for a user are “good” for at least one of the
other users. Because of its superior performance in frequency-
selective fading wireless channels, OFDMA is the modulation
and multiple access scheme used in latest wireless systems
such as IEEE 802.16e (Mobile WiMAX) [1].
In recent years, many dynamic resource allocation algo-
rithms have been developed for the Single Input Single Output
(SISO)-OFDMA systems. In [2] [3], the system throughput is
maximized with a total power constraint and in [4]-[6], the
total power consumption is minimized with constraints on the
users’ data rates. In [7], minimum data rate is maximized while
in [8]-[10], proportional data rate constraints are introduced. In
[11] [12], the fulﬁllment of every user’s data rate constraints
are guaranteed in order to maximize the sum of the users’
data rates and in [13], the sum throughput is maximized with
long term access proportional fairness. In addition, in [14]
weighted sum data rate is maximized with “self-noise” and
phase noise. Finally, in [15], system throughput is maximized
but the resource allocation unit is not the subcarrier, as in
previous algorithms [2]-[14], but a time/frequency unit (slot),
in accordance with WiMAX systems [1].
An additional major advance in recent wireless systems is
the use of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) transmis-
sion to improve communication performance [1]. In fading
environments MIMO technology offers signiﬁcant increase
in the data throughput and the link range without additional
bandwidth or transmit power requirements by opening up mul-
tiple data pipes in the same frequency band of operation [16].
Because of these properties, MIMO systems have received in-
creasing attention in the past decade. MIMO related algorithms
can be implemented in each subcarrier and by combining
OFDMA with MIMO transmission, wireless systems can offer
larger system capacities and improved reliability.
In general, in order to transmit on the boundary of the
capacity region, the BS needs to transmit to multiple users
simultaneously in each subchannel employing Dirty Paper
Coding (DPC) [16]. However, DPC has large implementation
complexity. In [17] [18], user selection and beamforming
algorithms, that are based on ZF [19], are proposed in order to
maximize the system capacity without guaranteeing any kind
of fairness among the users’ data rates. In [20], proportional
data rate constraints are applied and in [21] a kind of fairness
is supported.
In this paper, a user selection and resource allocation
algorithm for multiuser downlink MISO-OFDMA is developed
that is less complex than exhaustive search algorithm and in-
corporates fairness by imposing minimum data rate constraints
among users. As in [20], the beamforming scheme of [17] is
applied in each subcarrier, where each user experiences ﬂat
fading [1], but the user selection procedure takes minimum
data rate constraints into account. A complexity analysis is
also presented in order to further support our statements and
simulation results indicate that the algorithm can satisfy the
fairness criterion.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. A de-
scription of the MISO-OFDMA system model is introduced in
Section II, whereas the problem of sum data rate maximization
using minimum data rate constraints is formulated in Section
III. The proposed algorithm is introduced in Section IV and
Section V contains the complexity analysis of the proposed
algorithm and a complexity comparison with exhaustive search
algorithm. Simulation results, analysis and a comparison be-
tween the proposed algorithm and previous resource allocation
schemes are provided in Section VI. Finally, Section VII

contains concluding remarks.
In the following, (·)T denotes transpose, whereas (·)∗
denotes conjugate transpose. x denotes a column vector, A
denotes a matrix, ∥ · ∥ represents the Euclidean norm, and E
is the mean value. Finally, [x]+ = max{0, x}.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider an OFDMA downlink transmission with N sub-
carriers, T transmit antennas at the BS and K active users,
each equipped with a single receive antenna. Also, let B be
the overall available bandwidth, and hk,n = [h1
k,n . . . hT
k,n]T
be the T × 1 baseband equivalent gain vector of the channel
between the BS and user k in subcarrier n. Thus, for each
subcarrier n, the baseband equivalent model for the system
can be written as
yn = Hnxn + zn,
(1)
where Hn = [h1,n h2,n . . . hK,n]T is a K × T matrix with
complex entries, xn = [x1,n . . . xT,n]T is the T ×1 transmitted
signal vector in subcarrier n, yn = [y1,n . . . yK,n]T is a K ×1
vector containing the received signal of each user, and zn =
[z1,n . . . zK,n]T is a K × 1 vector denoting the noise that is
assumed to be independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-
mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian with covariance
matrix σ2IK.
It is also assumed that the channel vectors are statistically
independent and that their distribution is continuous. Hence,
rank(Hn) = min(T, K). Moreover, the practically important
case where K ≥ T is considered. Hence, rank(Hn) = T.
The total transmitted power, in the entire OFDM symbol, is
Ptot and equal power is allocated to each subcarrier. Hence,
trace[Cn] ≤ Ptot
N , where Cn = E[xn (xn)∗] is the covariance
matrix of the transmitted signal xn.
Using only transmit beamforming, which is a subopti-
mal strategy, the following model is obtained. Let wk,n =
[w1
k,n w2
k,n . . . wT
k,n]T be the T × 1 beamforming weight
vector for user k in subcarrier n. Then, the baseband model
(1) can be written as
yn = HnWnDnsn + zn,
(2)
where Wn = [w1,n w2,n . . . wK,n] is the T × K beam-
forming weight matrix, sn = [s1,n . . . sK,n]T is a K × 1
vector containing the signals destined to each user, and Dn =
diag(√p1,n, √p2,n, . . . , √pK,n) accounts for the distribution
of the power allocated to subcarrier n among the K users.
According to (2), the resulting received signal vector for user
k in subcarrier n, is given by
yk,n =

to other users in subcarrier n. Concerning (3), a graphic
representation of the MISO downlink beamforming block
diagram is shown in Fig. 1.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
ZF beamforming is a spatial signal processing by which the
multiple antenna transmitter can null multiuser interference
signals in wireless communications. It inverts the channel
matrix at the transmitter in order to create orthogonal channels
between the transmitter and the receiver. The beamforming
vectors are selected such that hi,n · wj,n = 0, for i ̸= j,
and (3) becomes yk,n = hk,nwk,n√pk,nsk,n + zk,n. It is
then possible to encode users individually, and with smaller
complexity compared to DPC. ZF at the transmitter incurs an
excess transmission power penalty relative to ZF-DPC and the
(optimal) MMSE-DPC transmission scheme. If K ≤ T and
rank(Hn) = K, the ZF beamforming matrix is the pseudo-
inverse of Hn, namely Wn = H∗
n(HnH∗
n)−1.
However, if K > T, it is not possible to use it because
HnH∗
n is singular and low complexity SDMA approaches are
required. In that case, it is necessary to select t ≤ T out of
K users in each subcarrier. Hence, there are I possible com-
binations of users transmitting in the same subcarrier, denoted
as Ai, where Ai ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , K}, 0 < |Ai| ≤ T, where |Ai|
denotes the cardinality of set Ai, and I = PT

.
Let a set of users Ai = {s1, . . . , st}, that produce the row-
reduced channel matrix Hn(Ai) = [hs1,n hs2,n . . . hst,n]T
in each subcarrier. When ZF is used, the data rate of user
k ∈ Ai, in subcarrier n, is given by [16] [20]
rk,i,n = log2(µnck,n(Ai)),
(4)
where ck,n(Ai) = {[(Hn(Ai)Hn(Ai)∗)−1]k,k}−1 and µn

The problem above (5) is an NP-hard combinatorial op-
timization problem with non-linear constraints. The optimal
solution can be obtained by exhaustive search of all possible
user assignment sets in all subcarriers but the complexity
is given by IN, which is extremely complicated even for
moderate K, N.
IV. THE PROPOSED RESOURCE ALLOCATION ALGORITHM
In the following, a suboptimal, two-step, low-complexity
user selection and resource allocation algorithm is proposed,
that selects users independently in each subcarrier, it is based
on ZF beamforming and guarantees individual minimum data
rates.
1) Step 1: Algorithm without minimum data rate constraints:
It is a modiﬁcation of [17] implemented in each subcarrier.
• Set Rk = 0, ∀k, ρk,i,n = 0, ∀k, i, and ∀n ∈ S.
• For n = 1, 2, . . . , N:
– Set U = {1, 2, . . . , K}, |Ai,n| = ∅.
– Find user k = argmaxj∈U ∥ hj,n ∥.
– Set t = 1, ρk,i,n = 1, Ai,n(t) = {k}, U = U − {k},
and compute Rk, according to (4), (6). Ai,n(t) means
the allocation result of the t step in subcarrier n.
– For t = 2, 3, . . . , T:
∗ Find a user, st ∈ U, such that
X
k∈Ai(t−1)∪{st}
rk,i,n >
X
k∈Ai(t−1)
rk,i,n
∗ If user st is found, set ρst,i,n = 1, Ai,n(t) =
Ai,n(t − 1) ∪ st, and U = U − {st}.
∗ Compute Rk, ∀k ∈ Ai,n(t), according to (4), (6).
After the initialization, the algorithm ﬁnds user k with the
best channel condition in subcarrier n. Subcarrier n is then
assigned to additional users if the sum data rate in subcarrier
n increases [17]. If there are more than one candidate users st
in each step, pick the one with the maximum sum data rate.
Procedure continues for all subcarriers.
2) Step 2: Subcarrier reallocation: In Step 1, a subcarrier
allocation solution is obtained which does not guarantee the
fulﬁllment of every user’s data rate constraints. So, some
subcarriers need to be allocated to the users whose minimum
data rate constraints have not been satisﬁed yet, a procedure
that causes an inevitable decrease in the overall data rate
since these subcarriers were ﬁrst allocated to users with
the best channel condition on them. During the reallocation
procedure each subcarrier reallocation should cause the least
reduction in the sum of the users’ data rates and the number
of reallocation operations should be kept as low as possible.
Thus,
ek,t,n = max
 
rt,i,n − rk,i,n
rk,i,n
,
rk∗,i,n − rk∗,i′,n
rk∗,i′,n
!
,
∀k∗ ∈ Ai,n ∩ Ai′,n, ∀n ∈ S,
(7)
is deﬁned as the cost function of reallocating subcarrier n to
user k, forming Ai′,n, instead of the originally assigned user t.
If user k occupies subcarrier n, instead of user t, then the data
rates of the other users (each k∗ ∈ Ai,n ∩ Ai′,n) occupying
subcarrier n will be affected too. Hence, the cost function (7)
takes into account the change of the data rate of all users
in each subcarrier. In addition, max function, in (7), consists
of at most T elements, rk∗,i,n means the data rate of user
k∗ ∈ Ai,n and rk∗,i′,n means the data rate of user k∗ ∈ Ai′,n,
both in subcarrier n. The subcarrier reallocation algorithm is
as follows.
• For k = 1, 2, . . . , K:
– Set S = {1, 2, . . . , N}.
– While Rk < mrk:
∗ Calculate the cost function according to (7).
∗ Find [t∗, n∗] =
argmin
t∈Ai,n,n∈S
ek,t,n.
∗ If Rt∗ − rt∗,i,n ≥ mrt∗ and Rm ≥ mrm, ∀m ∈
Ai,n ∩Ai′,n: Set ρt∗,i,n = 0, ρk,i,n = 1, S = S −
{n}, Ai,n = Ai′,n and compute Rm, ∀m ∈ Ai,n,
according to (4), (6).
∗ Else: S = S − {n}.
∗ If S = ∅: break.
In Step 2, Rk, Ai,n and ρk,i,n, ∀k, i, n are known from Step
1. Subcarrier reallocation is carried out on a user-by-user basis
for all users whose minimum data rate requirements have not
been satisﬁed in Step 1. Consider user k for example. In each
stage, user t∗ and subcarrier n∗ with the lowest cost function
are selected which cause the least reduction in the sum of the
users’ data rates. Subcarrier n∗ will be allocated to user k
instead of the originally assigned user t∗, if this reallocation
does not cause Rt∗ − rt∗,i,n < mrt∗ and Rm < mrm, ∀m ∈
Ai,n ∩ Ai′,n. Otherwise, the reallocation will not be done and
9

new t∗, n∗ will be identiﬁed from the rest of the subcarriers.
This subcarrier reallocation process repeats for user k until
its data rate requirement is satisﬁed, otherwise an outage is
occured.
V. COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
In order to analyze the computational complexity of the
proposed algorithm, recall that K refers to the total number
of users in the system and T refers to the number of transmit
antennas at the BS. N on the other hand refers to the number
of subcarriers, which is much larger than both K and T.
In Step 1 of the proposed algorithm, the best user k among
K users is found for subcarrier n = 1, 2, . . . , N, which
requires O(KN) operations. Then, at most T − 1 other users
are found for subcarrier n which requires the evaluation of at
most T data rates rk,i,n. In order to evaluate rk,i,n, inversion
of Hn(Ai(t − 1) ∪ st)Hn(Ai(t − 1) ∪ st)∗ is required which
can be done in time O(T 2), for the worst case, when T users
occupy each subcarrier, using the matrix inversion lemma as
described in [17]. Repeating this over at most K − 1 users
(st /∈ Ai(t−1)) in each one of the t = 2 to T steps, and over
all subcarriers of set S, the overall complexity of Step 1 is
obtained to be O(KNT 3).
In Step 2, while loop runs for at most N times for each user.
In the while loop, cost function is calculated which requires
T comparisons for the max function, O(NT 2) time for the
data rates (rk,i,n, rk∗,i,n, rk∗,i′,n) for all subcarriers and TN
multiplications. Therefore, cost function requires O(T 4N 2).
Finding t∗, n∗, requires O(TN). Thus, complexity of Step
2 is O(KN 2T 4) which is also the complexity of the whole
proposed algorithm.
As was mentioned the complexity of exhaustive search for
the optimal solution of the original problem is given by IN,
where I = PT
l=1
 K


. Alternatively, the complexity is
O(KNT ) and is prohibitive even for moderate values of K, N,
and T. Thus, it is easily observed that the proposed algorithm
has a very dramatic reduction in complexity compared to
O(KNT ) required by the exhaustive search.
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
The proposed algorithm is compared with the algorithms
proposed in [17]-[21], Round Robin (RR) algorithm, and
Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) transmission, only to the
user with the strongest channel. mrk = 1.5 bits/s/Hz, ∀k, and
in [20], proportional data rate constraints are γk =

∀k and system parameters are D = 0.1, L = T. In RR algo-
rithm, each user is given a fair share of the channel resource
regardless of the channel state and T users are selected in
each subcarrier. Both equal power (EQ) allocation and water-
ﬁlling (WF) power allocation over the parallel subchannels are
considered.
In all simulations presented in this section, the frequency-
selective channel consists of six independent Rayleigh multi-
path components. As in [20], an exponentially decaying power
delay proﬁle is assumed, the ratio of the energy of the lth

spread of 5µs and maximum doppler of 30Hz is assumed.
The channel information is sampled every 0.5ms to update
the proposed algorithm, T = 4, N = 128 and the number of
channel realizations is equal to 105.
In Figs. 2, 3, K varies from 4 − 16 in increment of 2 and
SNR = 20, while in Figs. 4, 5, K = 16. Also, Figs. 2, 4
depict the sum of the users’ data rates vs number of users
and average channel SNR, respectively, and Figs. 3, 5 depict
the outage probabily for different values of number of users
and average channel SNR, respectively. Outage probability is
deﬁned as the ratio of the users that have not reached their
target data rate over K.
In Figs. 2, 4, it can be seen the reasonable price being
paid in order to guarantee minimum data rate requirements
by using the proposed algorithm. In Fig. 2, as the number
of users increases, the difference in sum data rates increases
because additional multiuser diversity is available to [17] [18]
that only target sum data rate maximization. On the other hand,
more users put more constraints to the proposed algorithm,
because new users need to share the same resources. Algorithm

in [17] is only the ﬁrst Step of the proposed algorithm
where minimum data rate requirements are not yet considered
while MRC algorithm is the lower bound of the proposed
algorithm as in MRC each subcarrier is allocated to only
one user. In [20], although γk =
mrk
PK
k=1 mrk , ∀k, it does not
mean that minimum data rate requirements are satisﬁed, as
seen in Figs. 3, 5. Moreover, sum data rate of the proposed
algorithm is signiﬁcantly enhanced over both RR-WF and
RR-EQ algorithm, wherein the channel gain information is
not exploited. Furthermore, algorithm in [21] imposes a kind
of fairness between users’ data rates. In addition, in Fig. 3,
the outage probability achieved by the proposed algorithm
is smaller than that achieved from the reference algorithms.
Finally, in Fig. 5, it is also shown that the outage probability
achieved by the proposed algorithm decreases quickly over the
average channel SNR and is lower than that of the reference
algorithms.
VII. CONCLUSION
A fairness-aware user selection and resource allocation
algorithm, which is based on ZF beamforming, for the MISO
downlink over frequency-selective channels was introduced.
The main goal was to satisfy the minimum data rate re-
quirements of users despite the loss with respect to the
unconstrained case where the only target is the maximization
of the sum data rate. Simulation results provide proofs about
these statements and complexity analysis shows the dramatic
reduction in complexity compared with exhaustive search.
