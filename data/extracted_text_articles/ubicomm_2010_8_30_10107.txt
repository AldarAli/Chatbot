Abstract— This paper synthesizes prior research to develop a 
novel model for the study of the adoption of mobile business 
services and applications incorporating a demand and supply 
perspective. The model complements and extends existing models 
while also leveraging data from industry reports; in particular, it 
focuses on the interrelationships between participants in the 
mobile services value chain and the impact of these 
interrelationships on the adoption of new services in a 
competitive and technology-saturated service market. There has 
been to date limited research reported that has considered the 
dynamics of the interrelationships between customers and (layers 
of) multiple service providers as a factor in the adoption and 
acceptance process; the proposed model addresses this gap and 
advocates the use of a combination of design science and service 
science methodologies. It is concluded that not mobility per se but 
the way mobility is used to create value plays a significant role as 
an adoption driver, and that the quality of the service and its 
relevance to personal or business lifestyle are the most important 
decision making factors. It is also asserted that while innovative 
mobile services (i.e., services that are not already offered using a 
different technology) may be compelling if they meet lifestyle 
needs, mobile services replacing or complementing existing ones 
will be favored by customers only if their quality is exceptional 
and motivates ‘switching’ to the mobile service.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Business transactions between participants (e.g., customers, 
businesses) enabled by mobile data networks are commonly 
referred to as mobile commerce (mCommerce) via a range of 
related mobile services and applications [1-2]. A specific 
characteristic of mCommerce is its potential to support 
customer mobility by offering services that dynamically adjust 
to be available at the location in which the mobile customer 
operates [3]. In addition, mCommerce transactions may be 
facilitated by a specific form of payment known as mobile 
payment (mPayment) [4]. The definition of mCommerce 
adopted in this study is derived from [5]: ‘A value-added 
service that enables mobile customers to conduct reliable and 
secure transactions through specifically-designed mobile 
applications’. Further, mobile business (mBusiness) services 
expand mCommerce to include not only transactions between 
participants but activities such as servicing customers, and 
collaborating and conducting mobile transactions with business 
partners based on an appropriate business model (adapted from 
[6], p. 685). Finally, with respect to the type of interaction 
between participants, most mCommerce transactions can be 
classified applying the categories used to classify electronic 
commerce (eCommerce) transactions; however at present B2C 
(business-to-customer) mobile transactions prevail [1].  
A number of general frameworks and models for the study 
of mobile services and their adoption have been proposed in 
prior work drawing on eCommerce adoption studies and often 
including variables such as usefulness, ease of use, and 
usability [7-11]. Additional specific constructs such as 
customer mobility [2]; location awareness [12-13], trust [14], 
service cost [15], and perceived value proposition [16-17] have 
also been considered. A range of country-specific adoption 
barriers have been identified from customer, technology, 
company and business perspectives [18-20]. A global view of 
the effect of the legislative environment (government 
intervention) on location-aware services has also been provided 
in [21].  
While empirical studies have been able to identify some of 
the factors affecting customer decisions, the dynamics of the 
processes of meeting customer needs and preferences (i.e., 
mobile business service demand) by the gamut of industry 
players (i.e., mobile business service supply) has not been 
studied in depth. With customers becoming both better 
informed and more experienced as technology users, it can be 
expected that additional factors may emerge from a study of 
the adoption processes from multiple perspectives and in a 
contemporary context including customer perceptions about 
mobile business service value [22-23].  
It has previously been suggested that in order to explain 
mCommerce adoption processes both the supply and the 
demand side may need to be included in a comprehensive 
adoption framework [23], and that the relationship between 
customer and service supplier is one of the four main aspects of 
a mobile service [24]. The objective of the study presented here 
is to derive and extend an explanatory model capturing the 
relationships between supply and demand factors that can be 
used further to investigate how customer lifestyle requirements 
and expectations about the quality of a mobile business service 
affect market demand for these services and contribute to 
actual mobile service use.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next 
section reviews the relevant literature and provides background 
information. The section following describes the proposed 
model including its variables and the relationships between 
them. The last section discusses the model from the perspective 
of further research and provides a conclusion.   
II. 
MOBILE BUSINESS SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS  
General mobile business-to-customer services (mobile 
business services) and enabling mobile services (e.g., 
mPayment) are delivered to customers as a result of the 
business interactions within the mobile business value chain 
[16][25]. Stakeholder interactions occur across multiple 
networks: the public Internet, the wireless networks provided 
by mobile operators, and the private networks, which may be 
operated by intermediaries such as enabling service providers. 
The adoption of a mobile business service therefore may be 
dependent on factors related to the role and contribution of 
each stakeholder group, on the relationships across the value 
chains in which the stakeholders participate, and on the 
regulatory and socio-economic environment within a single 
country or region, or across regions.  
The relevant mobile business service supply stakeholder 
groups can be classified as: 1. Mobile network operators 
(MNOs); 2. Mobile device developers/vendors (MDDVs); 3. 
Mobile network services providers (MNSPs); 4. Mobile 
application developers (MADs); 5. Mobile service content 
developers (MSCDs); 6. Mobile business services providers 
(MBSPs); 7. Enabling mobile service providers (EMSPs); 8. 
Mobile business service aggregators (MBSAs); and 9. 
Legislators/regulators (LRs) [26]. All stakeholders contribute 
to the creation of customer service value and may affect 
customer demand. Service provision and value may also be 
affected by relevant regulatory and legislative context (Fig. 1).  
 
 
Figure 1. Mobile business service supply and demand framework (adapted 
from [27]).  
At present SMS (Short Messaging Service) and MI (mobile 
Internet) are the mobile data technologies providing 
mCommerce platforms. A service may require an application 
developed for mobile devices e.g., downloadable mobile game 
software. Finally, services may be developed for multiple 
platforms: SMS banking provides some of the functionality of 
a banking online site designed for MI access, however different 
authentication mechanisms may be used.  
While some mobile business services may extend or 
enhance existing services (e.g., SMS banking) others may also 
incorporate innovative features such as mPayment and 
personalization based on location awareness (location-based 
services – LBS). mPayment and LBS can be viewed both as 
independent business services, and as enablers of other mobile 
business services [26]. As the providers of these enabling 
services participate in the mCommerce value chain, factors 
related to location and payment can be expected to play a role 
in user adoption [26][28-32].  
A number of classifications of mobile services and 
applications have been proposed in the literature including a 
seven-dimensional taxonomy [1]. The results indicate first that 
most contemporary mobile business services use a B2C model 
and involve significant personalization as the customer is 
normally ‘known’ to the service. Second, approximately half of 
the services include transaction options and similarly half of 
them are location-based. While at present the number of 
synchronous and asynchronous services is approximately the 
same, the trend in the temporal dimension is to develop 
synchronous services able to switch to an asynchronous mode 
when the network is overloaded.  
SMS mobile learning (SMS learning), mobile banking 
(mBanking) and mobile gaming (mGaming) are three typical 
examples of interactive, transactional B2C mobile business 
services, which allow (or require) personalization, may run in 
real time or asynchronously, and may be location-based. All 
three have been studied empirically in both global and national 
contexts with respect to their adoption, acceptance and usage. 
Results indicate that customer requirements and expectations 
about the functionality of the service, about its design, and 
about the support of enabling services may play a critical role 
in the adoption and use of mobile business services.  
It is envisaged, for example, that the mass adoption of 
mBanking would depend on the provision of secure, reliable 
and easy-to-customize user interfaces that can be implemented 
on a multi-standard, multi-functional mobile device designed 
for a long life and a ‘rugged’ service; customer requirements 
and the specific socio-cultural context may play a significant 
and critical role [33-38].  
With respect to SMS mLearning, results indicate that it may 
be difficult to use due to the screen size and text message 
limitations for SMS learning, may be too costly to be afforded 
by a student on a limited budget, and may also be perceived as 
intrusive if large message traffic is generated by the service. It 
can be argued therefore that to overcome these adoption 
barriers, a successful mLearning service needs to be affordable, 
and to provide additional value by being accessible while the 
learner is travelling (i.e., compatible with the learner’s daily

routine), flexible and allowing customization, and available on 
demand [39-41]. 
In the case of mGaming, findings from the literature 
highlight the critical role of both customer perceptions/attitudes 
and supply chain factors as determinants of adoption and use 
[42-44]. Customer perceptions about the value of playing a 
mobile game in the context of their lifestyle may be significant 
motivators, 
for 
example, 
‘expressiveness’ 
[45] 
and 
‘socialization’ [46]. On the other hand, enabling services such 
as payment, and game and device design, may play an 
important role as contributors to the quality of the mobile 
gaming experience [47-49].  
We draw on these collective findings to suggest that first it 
is not customer mobility per se, but the way service support for 
customer mobility is used to create customer value, that plays a 
role as an adoption driver. Second, the quality of the service 
and its relevance to personal or business lifestyle are the most 
important decision making factors in the adoption process. 
There is also evidence to indicate that while innovative mobile 
services (i.e., services that are not already offered using a 
different technology) may be compelling if they meet lifestyle 
needs, mobile services replacing or complementing existing 
ones will be favored by customers only if their quality is 
exceptional and motivates ‘switching’ to the mobile service; 
here, appropriately designed enabling mobile services may 
have a significant motivational impact.  
The above analysis has enabled us to derive a 
comprehensive model representing the factors that influence 
the adoption of mobile services. In particular, we have 
determined the critical customer benefit-related success factors 
for the adoption of a mobile business service, and the role of 
enabling services in the adoption process. The explanatory 
model that sets out these factors and their inter-relationships is 
presented in the next section.  
III. 
AN EXPLANATORY ADOPTION MODEL  
The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of 
Planned Behavior (TPB) and the diffusion of innovation theory 
are among the models used to inform the research design of 
empirical studies investigating the factors influencing intention 
to use a mobile business service, and actual use. However these 
models have some limitations; for example it was recently 
reported that while the two TAM variables perceived 
usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) may be 
predictors of the intention to use a technology, these variables 
have not been found to be good predictors of actual usage [50]; 
however intention to use was found to be a good predictor of 
actual usage [50] and continuous usage [11].  
It has been suggested in prior work to include in adoption 
models variables measuring the benefits of the technology to 
the customer, as adoption models measuring technology do not 
measure the customer value of the technology [51], and to 
investigate perceived service value as an adoption factor [11]; 
[23]. Building on prior work and from the perspective of how a 
service may provide value and benefit the customer, the factors 
influencing the adoption of mobile business services can be 
grouped as shown below [26-27][38][41][52]. 
 
Customer quality of service expectations: Technology 
factors that relate primarily to the infrastructure and the 
service architecture (e.g., interoperability of devices 
and protocols, bandwidth availability, device features 
and functions, connectivity). The customer may benefit 
from the advancement of technology, which makes it 
possible to deliver a mobile business service.  
 
Customer lifestyle requirements: Consumer factors that 
relate to how useful and value–adding a mobile 
business service is perceived to be. For example, in an 
investigation of how mobile services could help the 
elderly it was found both PEU and an actual need of 
the service were important as acceptance criteria [53]. 
Other factors may include content personalization and 
localization, service ubiquity, timeliness, convenience, 
cost, privacy, trust.  
Customer quality of service expectations and customer 
lifestyle requirements are included in the synthesized model as 
mobile business service adoption antecedents. The model (Fig. 
2) is described in more detail next.  
A. Variables and Relationships 
Variable 1 (customer quality of service expectations) refers 
to the customer in the capacity of a mobile technology user, to 
follow the terminology in [23]. The variable represents 
customer expectations about service quality. Possible measures 
include mobile data service interface PEU (and perceived ease 
of learning how to use it), and expectations about mobile 
network performance parameters such as network delay (e.g., 
synchronicity, a service working in real-time), 24/7 access to 
the network, seamless handover when the customer is mobile, 
service 
availability 
across 
different 
subscriber 
mobile 
networks, and affordability (data service cost).  
Variable 2 (customer lifestyle requirements) refers to the 
customer as a consumer of the mobile business service [23]. 
The variable represents customer requirements with respect to 
the value of the service and the benefits it may bring. Possible 
measures include PU and PEU of the mobile business service, 
perceived service functionality, perceived compatibility with 
the customer’s daily routine, perceived benefits of access to the 
service ‘on the go’ compared to other similar services, 
awareness of the service, perceived added value through 
customer mobility support, perceived service ‘persistence’ 
(sustainability), and affordability (service cost).  
Variables 3 and 4 represent constructs used extensively in 
adoption studies, for example, empirical investigations based 
on TAM, or on TPB. Variable 3 (intention to use) signifies 
customer attitude towards using a mobile business service in 
the future. Variable 4 (actual use) can be measured both 
through customer self-evaluation (subjective, or perception-
based), and through data obtained from service providers 
(objective, or fact-based) [11][50].  
Variable 5 (perceived customer demand) is a new variable, 
reflecting [multiple] service provider perceptions about 
customer behavior with respect to the adoption of a mobile 
business service.

Figure 2. An explanatory model for mobile busines service adoption  
 
Some findings suggest that there may be differences between 
the intended value proposition and customer acceptance of 
the proposition [17] due in part to the difficulties involved in 
communicating it [54]. Possible variable measures include 
service provider intentions to invest in developing and 
maintaining a service based on projections about market 
demand. 
Multiple relationships exist between and among the 
variables. The model depicts a set of twelve relationships 
that explain the adoption process on both the demand and the 
supply sides of the value chain, based on the concept of 
creating value [11][23][25].  
Relationships R1-R8 are internal; they capture the 
interrelationships among the five model variables and relate 
to the demand side of the value chain - customer perceptions, 
attitudes and behaviors (Table 1), or perceptions regarding 
these demand factors. The external relationships R9-R12 
refer to the perceptions, attitudes and beliefs of the industry 
stakeholders. They link the context variables to the rest of the 
model and make explicit the role of the application design of 
the mobile business service and the design of the related 
mobile application(s) as factors influencing adoption and 
affecting actual use. 
The mobile business service supply chain players 
identified earlier (Fig. 1) can be viewed as the co-creators of 
mobile business service value [55] and are represented in the 
explanatory model (Fig. 2) through the two context variables: 
‘service context’ representing the business view of the 
service and ‘design context’ representing the technology and 
services supporting or leveraging customer mobility. 
The viability of the business model depends on the 
perceived service value. For example, SMS based ‘test 
revision’ scenarios designed to be used by commuting 
learners offer a study aid available wherever the learner goes. 
The convenience of such a learning service may contribute to 
forming a positive perception as it fits in with the lifestyle of 
a learner frequently changing locations and spending time in 
traffic. However additional service value may be added by 
appropriate service design meeting the learner’s quality of 
service expectations: for example, options such as micro-
payment (for just one question/answer pair), a discount for a 
bundle of questions/answers, and supporting service 
availability across different subscriber networks, may all 
provide motivation for actual use [41].  
B. The Design Context and the Service Context 
The role of the design context may be especially 
significant where an application needs to be developed in 
order to deliver or support a service. For example, the 
perceived value of customer mobility support may also 
depend on the application design: an application, which 
requires high mental concentration while being used may be 
unlikely to be convenient to customers on the move [53].  
The service context focuses on service design and on the 
business model used to deliver new and flexible mobile 
services [56]. The two contexts complement each other. An 
example of a partnership model for application design and 
development aligned with service design and provision, 
which includes all stakeholders, involved in creating value 
and bringing benefit to the customer, is provided by the 
SmartTouch project. SmartTouch is a service based on NFC 
(near field communication) technology and includes an 
mPayment and mobile ticketing application. The project 
development and the commercialization phase are supported 
by the partners in the international SmartTouch consortium, 
which includes developers, hardware manufacturers, and 
data service and business service providers [57].  
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUDING REMARKS  
The synthesized model presented here in Figure 2 
provides a framework for the investigation of the process of 
adoption of mobile business services, including a multiple 
stakeholder perspective, which provides a balanced view of 
both the supply and demand side of mobile business service 
provision.

The model may be used to investigate how the service adds 
value through mobility support (possibly competing with 
other similar services, which do not support user mobility) 
and the perceived benefits of the service.  
While empirical results obtained in adoption studies have 
been used to define the constructs of the model, two other 
theories have been utilized to contextualize it: design science 
provides a perspective on the relationship between customer 
requirements and expectations and the design of the mobile 
application, while service science provides a perspective on 
how the respective mobile service may generate demand and 
become viable.  
The model is based on the assumption that understanding 
the motivators of customer decision making about using a 
mobile business service may provide useful feedback both to 
developers of mobile applications and to mobile business 
service providers. Thus it should contribute to the 
development of viable and valuable mobile service scenarios 
in an environment characterized by the emergence of new 
services and technologies, with a significantly increased 
spectrum of customer choices and business investment 
opportunities.  
In the next stage of this research we will gather and 
analyze qualitative data in order to operationalize the 
variable perceived customer demand and the two context 
variables. It is proposed to investigate the role of the service 
context as a mediator in the relationship between customer 
quality of service expectations and intention to use/actual 
use, applying a service science perspective [58] assuming 
that: i) the value provided through a mobile service, which is 
able to support customer mobility (‘mobility value’) has a 
dual customer/provider nature and needs to be investigated 
from both customer and service provider perspectives [59], 
and ii) mobile services are innovative and therefore it is 
important for their uptake to identify the critical features, 
which may positively influence use and demand [60].  
It is proposed to study the mediating role of the design of 
the application underlying the service in the relationships 
between customer lifestyle requirements and perceived 
customer demand and between perceived customer demand 
and actual use from a design science perspective. The design 
science cycle starts with identifying the problem, and 
continues through the suggestion, development and 
evaluation steps to the conclusion step, with feedback loops 
at every step [61]. The study approach is based on the 
assumption that in the design of mobile applications the 
problem space is ‘fuzzy’ (i.e., the problem to be solved is not 
well defined) and therefore the application evaluation and 
conclusion steps cannot be completed without understanding 
how the new mobile artifact or mobile application may fit in 
a number of possible service use scenarios [23][62].  
Methodologically, the research can be viewed as a 
sequence of two distinct but related investigative phases. The 
first phase is concerned with the investigation of selected 
mobile services and the adoption process associated with 
these. The predominant research thinking underpinning this 
phase of the work is objectivist although research methods 
more aligned to an interpretivist approach are deployed. For 
example the hypotheses formulated and tested statistically in 
the quantitative studies on mobile banking and mobile 
gaming adoption highlighted the role of perceived usefulness 
and of compatibility with customer lifestyle requirements 
and expectations as adoption antecedents [38][45]. The 
exploratory analysis of the quantitative survey data gathered 
for the study of mPayment adoption indicated that the more 
customers were aware of the service the more likely they 
were to become regular users and create demand for it, and 
also leading to improving the design of the service (e.g., user 
interface), and the design application supporting it used (e.g., 
security concerns) [63]. The qualitative study of mLearning 
adoption identified support for mobile lifestyle and providing 
rich but relevant information as the key contributors to the 
perceived service value and therefore likely demand drivers 
[41]. Finally, the research review of LBS mapping LBS 
development 
stages 
to 
customer 
expectations 
and 
requirements showed that while customer expectations about 
the quality of the service were high customers were are likely

to adopt even a ‘low tech’ service if their requirements were 
met [64].  
While empirical results from prior work have informed 
the development of the model proposed earlier an 
interpretivist approach will be adopted for the second phase 
of the investigation where rich subjective qualitative data 
will be gathered and analyzed with respect to the new model 
variables [65, pp. 121-134; p. 172][66, pp. 87-116]. Thus 
with respect to the overall methodology the study can be 
classified as exploratory in design [67] and following a 
mixed methods approach [68, p. 642]. It is believed that 
using a research strategy combining qualitative and 
quantitative research methods will facilitate a better 
understanding and interpretation of the relationships between 
the model variables [68, p. 653].  
The contribution of this work to the body of knowledge is 
a comprehensive explanatory theory of mobile services and 
applications adoption; in addition, the model may be used to 
complement the design science evaluation of a mobile 
application by developing and validating frameworks for 
evaluating the service value potential of the application from 
a service perspective [69].
