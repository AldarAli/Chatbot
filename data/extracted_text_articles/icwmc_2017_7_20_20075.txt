Abstract—This work addresses the problem of accurate indoor lo-
calization with an augmented ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio-
frequency-identiﬁcation (RFID) system. In augmented UHF RFID
system, a semi-passive component, called ST (from sense-a-tag),
can communicate with the RFID reader as a passive tags, and can
also capture the backscattering communication between RFID
reader and passive tags within its proximity. The system requires
that a grid of passive RFID tags is deployed and ST is attached
to object of interest. As such it allows for ﬁne-grained proximity-
based localization. ST is localized based on the aggregated
binary measurements according to localization algorithms, such
as weighted centroid localization (WCL). The aforementioned
algorithm assumes that the aggregated binary measurements
simply depends on the distance between landmark tags and
ST. However, it is not the case for ST-to-tag backscattering
communication. To improve the localization accuracy, this paper
proposes to use a Monte Carlo-based estimation with the detection
probability model of ST-to-tag. The performance of the proposed
algorithm is demonstrated by extensive computer simulation.

INTRODUCTION
The concept of Internet-of-Things (IoT) is simple but pow-
erful, which envisages the infrastructure of ubiquitous wireless
sensing and identiﬁcation of IoT nodes to connect anything
from anywhere at anytime [1]. The IoT nodes, such as radio
tags, can be embedded into objects, monitoring their status
and surrounding environment, as well as acquiring geograph-
ical information. Since the popular satellite-based positioning
system are restricted to outdoor environment, academic and
industrial communities have carried out intense research work
to build indoor localization system to realize the vision of IoT
[2]. Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio-frequency-identiﬁcation
(RFID) has been widely recognized as enabling technology for
IoT indoor localization application due to its miniature size,
easy deployment, low-cost and ultra-low power consumption
[3].
The majority of state-of-art UHF RFID localization ap-
proaches is based on the fusion of multiple pieces of rel-
evant information of RF signals, which are either angle-of-
arrival (AoA), time-of-arrival (ToA), time-difference-of-arrival
(TDoA) or received-signal-strength (RSS) returned to RFID
readers from tags [3]. The major problem with the aforemen-
tioned methods is that they are easily affected by the non-line-
of-sight (NLoS) conditions, severe multi-path distortions and
fast temporal change of indoor environment [4]. One direction
to resolve this problem is to apply proximity-based method,
which is to deploy passive tags at ﬁxed positions as landmarks
and attach RFID reader to target of interest [10]–[12], and vice
versa [6]. However, these approaches are not realistic solutions
for IoT indoor localization application considering size, cost
and energy.
The objective of this paper is to analyze and improve a
novel augmented UHF RFID system, which includes a semi-
passive UHF RFID component, called ST (from sense-a-tag)
[5] and off-the-shelf UHF RFID components, reader and tag.
The augmented UHF RFID system can be used for ﬁne-grained
proximity-based localization for IoT application by keeping
both landmark and target tags simple and inexpensive. In the
same way as passive tags, ST applies envelope detection to
extract the baseband signal in the receiving path, and applies
backscattering modulation to talk back in the transmitting
path. The difference is that in the receiving path ST does
not only capture the RFID reader’s command signal, but also
passive tag’s backscattering signal. ST is fully compatible with
EPCGlobal Class 1 Gen 2 RFID protocol. The augmented UHF
RFID system requires that RFID reader is installed and a grid
of passive tags is deployed as landmarks in the environment.
In [7], we showed how to use weighted centroid localization
(WCL) to localize ST in augmented UHF RFID system. Strict-
ly speaking, WCL is not fully range-free localization method,
since it depends on aggregated binary measurements aside the
simple communication link connectivity of ST and landmark
tags. However, the aggregated binary measurements of ST-
to-tag depends on numerous factors other than the distance
between ST and tag, such as the distance from RFID reader
antenna, the orientation of antennas and phase cancellation [8].
In this paper, we propose a method where we apply a Monte
Carlo estimation based on the probability detection model of
ST-to-tag. In Monte Carlo framework, the proposal distribution
of ST locations is assumed to be uniformly distributed over a
circle area around WCL estimation.
We have calibrated our newly developed UHF RFID simu-
lator PASS based on the real experiment data [8][9]. In PASS,
we could simulate various scenarios with all components of the
augmented UHF RFID system. The localization algorithms are
evaluated in the simulator. The paper is organized as follows:
in Section 2, we introduce the background and related work.
The localization algorithms are presented in Section 3. In
Section 4, we provide the simulation results which show the

BACKGROUND AND PRIOR WORK
In this section, we will discuss the state-of-the-art in
proximity-based localization approaches, augmented UHF R-
FID system, and UHF RFID simulation framework speciﬁed
for indoor localization research.
A. Proximity-based localization
Proximity-based localization techniques exploit symbolic
relative location information related to the presence or ab-
sence of the target within a small range of reference points
[4]. Conventional approaches of proximity-based UHF RFID
localization solutions are based on deploying passive tags at
ﬁxed locations as landmarks and attaching RFID reader to
target and vice versa. Usually, the former approach is referred
to as reader-based method while the latter as tag-based method.
In [10], researchers deployed a grid of UHF RFID tags
on the ceiling of the building. The read region of each tag
is well deﬁned, thus the ﬂoor environment is subdivided
into a set of cells. When the target equipped with reader
enters into the read region of UHF RFID tag, the tag ID
or the equivalent tag coordinates are retrieved. Based on the
similar fashion, multiple indoor localization systems have been
proposed [11][12]. In [6], the area is covered by a mesh grid
of a large set of RFID readers and associated antennas, whose
locations are known. The objects with attached UHF RFID tags
are localized and tracked using particle ﬁlter based inference
algorithm.
However, these approaches are strictly constrained by en-
ergy, cost and size. For example, the former approaches is
limited to relatively large and expensive objects that justify
carrying the RFID reader, such as human or robot. In the
latter approach, it is not cost-efﬁcient to densely deploy RFID
readers merely for connectivity information.
B. Augmented UHF RFID system
In order to keep both targets and landmarks simple and
inexpensive, a novel UHF RFID component, referred to as
ST, is developed to augmented the off-the-shelf UHF RFID
system [7]. Figure 1 depicts the block diagram of ST hardware.
The antenna is followed by a backscatter modulator, a corre-
sponding matching network and a conventional diode envelope
detector circuit. The output of envelope detector is fed into the
analog section, which can process both reader’s pulse-interval-
encoding (PIE) command signal and the tag’s backscattering
signal. The analog section for processing reader’s PIE signal
is the same as the standard passive tag, which employs a
hysteresis comparator to generate digital signal. The processing
circuit of tag’s backscattering signal is more complex, which

consists of a band-pass ﬁlter for removing the DC offset,
followed by a comparator serving as one-bit A/D converter.
The output of analog section is the input of digital section,
which runs ﬁnite state machine (FSM) for Gen2-based ST
locator protocol. As for rapid prototyping, the latest version of
digital section is implemented on FPGA Xilinx Spartan 3AN
chip.
Figure 2 shows a typical deployment of augmented UHF
RFID system for ﬁne-grained proximity-based localization.
The system consists of a grid of passive tags as landmarks, ST
attached to the target of interest, a standard RFID reader and
a computer hosting localization algorithm. The host computer
can control RFID reader to send out two distinct query signals,
QS and QT . A query QT drives ST to Listening state. In this
state, ST does not respond but listens to the backscattering
communication between RFID reader and passive tags. Upon
receiving the tags’ ID, ST stores a hash value corresponding
to the IDs temporarily. A query QS drives ST to Responding
state. In this state, ST works as a standard passive tag, and
backscatters the information of the detected tags’ IDs to the
RFID reader. Based on such aggregated binary measurements
of ST-to-tag, the host determines the location of ST according
to the embedded localization algorithm, such as WCL.
C. PASS simulator
Proximity-based Augmented UHF RFID System Simulator
(PASS) is a system-level time-domain UHF RFID simulator.
PASS simulator inherits the hierarchical software structure, the
behavioral model of NXP UCODE G2XM tag and wireless
propagation channel from PARIS simulation framework [14].
While PARIS mainly focuses on indoor wireless channel
modelling, PASS completes the functionality of RFID reader
and tag according to EPCglobal Class1 Gen2 protocol. The
behavior model of ST is developed to emulate the speciﬁc ST
hardware. The channel model consists of large-scale model and
statistical model. Besides that, the channel model also includes
the virtual transmitter model for the surface reﬂection. Various
characteristics of implemented models can be conﬁgured, such
as scenario deployment, parameters of wireless channel, tag,
reader and ST, etc. With the simulator-provided functions
and basic functions, behaviors of implemented components
in simulator can be measured, such as wireless signal delay
and attenuation. The simulator and user guide are available on
GitHub [15].

LOCALIZATION USING AUGMENTED
UHF RFID SYSTEM
In this section, we will describe our proposed detection
probability model of ST-to-tag, as well as the localization
algorithm based on Monte Carlo estimation.
A. The detection probability model of ST-to-tag
The detection probability of ST-to-tag depends on nu-
merous factors, which include the distance between ST and
tag, the distance from RFID reader, antenna orientation and
phase cancellation, etc [8]. The existing localization algorithms
assume that the detection probability of ST-to-tag simply
depends on the distance between ST to tag [7][13]. In order
to improve localization accuracy, a more realistic detection
probability model of ST-to-tag is developed based on the
research on the ST-to-tag backscattering communication link.
First, the detection probability model of ST-to-tag is modelled
as a function of distance between ST and tag, as well as
the distance and orientation from reader to tag. Secondly,
while ﬁtting the detection probability model of ST-to-tag, the
phase cancellation effect is considered by augmenting phase
cancellation-reducing technique to ST.
The proposed probability detection model of ST-to-tag is
formulated as a logistic regression model as shown in (1).
Figure 3 depicts the model features. D is the distance from
RFID reader to passive tag. θ represents the azimuth (the
relative orientation between (X, Z) plane with antenna to tag
vector), while φ represents elevation (the relative orientation
between (X, Y) plane with antenna to tag vector). d is the
distance between ST with tag. {ai, i = 1, . . . , 4} are the model
parameters.

We ﬁt the detection probability model of ST-to-tag with
data obtained from the PASS simulator. In the simulation,
the host controls a standard UHF RFID reader to sends out
the queries QT and QS. We use circularly polarized panel
antenna RFMAX S9028PCRJ as the reader antenna, whose
radiation pattern is shown in Figure 4. The power level of
reader antenna is 30 dBm. The channel model is conﬁgured
as “room”. For the scenario setup, the RFID reader antenna
is placed at the origin (0, 0, 0). The locations of passive tag
are uniformly sampled from the cuboid space of x ∈ [1, 8],
y ∈ [−4, 4] and z ∈ [−4, 4]. We obtained 3000 samples of
tag locations in the space. The locations of ST is uniformly
sampled within a sphere space, whose globe is at tag location

with the radius as 2m. Figure 5 shows the simulation setup,
in which the green dots represent tag locations, brown dots
represent ST locations.
The logistic regression model is trained with the obtained
data set, in which the cost function used is cross-entropy and
the optimization method is gradient descent. The parameter
estimations are a0 = −1.462, a1 = 0.4941, a2 = 2.506, a3 =
0.0126 and a4 = 0.0523. For comparison, the conventional
model, in which the detection probability simply depends on
the distance between ST and tag, is presented in (2). With the
obtained data set, the parameter estimations are a0 = 0.8970
and a1 = 2.4443. Figure 6 depicts the normalized histogram
of the obtained data set, as well as the curves of (1) and (2).
Furthermore, we use 1000 newly obtained data set as test data
set. The cross entropy cost of (1) 0.1278 is lower than (2)
0.1502. Therefore, (1) possesses higher model accuracy than
(2).

B. Monte Carlo estimation
Let us assume that there are K landmark tags with
known location in 2D cartesian coordinate system, {LTk, k =
1, . . . , K}. ST is attached to target of interest with an unknown
location x. Here ST is static. RFID reader sends out the number
of N rounds of QT . A landmark tag k can be detected by ST
with probability pk. In this work, we use (1) to approximate
such probability. Let the number of detection of landmark tag
k by ST denote by nk. Then, the probability of nk is modelled

Then, a measure χ = {x(m), m = 1, . . . , M} is generated
from uniform distribution over the region centering at x∗ with
radius r. The prior distribution p(x) in (6) is assumed as a
uniform distribution over the whole target region. p(y) is a

the proposed algorithm, the size of particles M is set as 200.
The number of query QT is set as 10. The radius r of circle
region for proposal distribution is set to 0.8 m. The localization
performance is measured by average root mean square error
(RMSE). The RMSE for one realization is calculated as ||x −
ˆx||2.
In the ﬁrst set of simulations, we place the ST at a ﬁxed
location in the region. The location is randomly selected. We
conduct 100 independent realizations of simulation with WCL
and Monte Carlo estimation. We repeat the aforementioned
procedure two times with different ST locations, which are
picked randomly. The objective of the simulation is to present
the localization performance of WCL and Monte Carlo estima-
tion. Figure 8 shows the localization error distribution of these
two scenarios with box-and-whisker plot. In Figure 8a, the ST
is placed at (3.8804, −0.1470), the RMSE for Monte Carlo
estimation is 0.1641 m, while for WCL the RMSE is 0.2834 m,
which is improved by 42.10%. In Figure 8b, the ST is placed

at (1.5443, 0.6334), the RMSE for Monte Carlo estimation is
0.1488 m, while for WCL is RMSE is 0.2561 m, which is
improved by 41.90%. From the distribution and RMSE, we
could conclude that Monte Carlo estimation achieves higher
localization accuracy than WCL for these two scenarios.
In the second set of simulations, we randomly sample 3000
locations for ST in the region. We collect the data of the true
ST location and the location estimation error for Monte Carlo
estimation and WCL. The RMSE of ST location estimation is
0.2673 m for WCL and 0.1330 m for Monte Carlo estimation,
which is improved by 50.24%. Figure 9 shows the heatmap
of location estimation error associated with ST true locations.
Each block of the heatmap is 0.2 m × 0.2 m, whose value
is determined by the RMSE of location estimation while ST
resides within the block. The overall localization accuracy of
Monte Carlo estimation is higher than WCL. in particular, for
the region close to the edge. The reason for such effect is
that as ST approaches the edge, the landmark tags within ST’s
proximity are unequally distributed. Monte Carlo estimation
utilizes detection probability model of ST-to-tag, which could
alleviate the effect of unequally distributed landmarks. From
the ﬁgure, we could conclude that Monte Carlo estimation
achieves higher localization accuracy than WCL.
V.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have investigated the problem of locating
static object attached with ST, which can detect the presence of
UHF RFID landmark tags with its proximity. Based on a more
realistic detection probability model of ST-to-tag, we propose
a Monte Carlo-based method for achieving higher localization
accuracy. We conduct several sets of simulation in our newly
developed PASS simulator, and the simulation results show
that Monte Carlo-based method achieves higher localization
accuracy than the conventional WCL method.
There are several interesting direction to explore in the
future work. First, the detection probability model does not
consider shadowing effect, which is important while attaching
ST to human or metallic vehicle. Second, this work only
considers locating one ST. It would be convenient to localize
multiple STs using Monte Carlo estimation method indepen-
dently. However, we could anticipate that the accuracy and
robustness of localization method would be improved with
extra ST-to-ST detection information. Third, the landmark
deployment does not receive much attention in this work.
We simply deploy the landmark tags in square pattern, and
distance among neighboring landmarks is constant. However, it
is beneﬁcial to investigate the relationship between localization
accuracy and the deployment density and pattern of landmark
tags.
