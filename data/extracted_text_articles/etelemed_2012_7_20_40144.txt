Abstract - The objective of the study was the numeric investigation 
of the existing literature containing the factor trust in automation 
as well as assistance systems for overall requirements for older 
people. Therefore, a systematic literature review with a total of 
150 dissimilar keyword-combinations based on three different 
descriptors in three bibliographic online databases was per-
formed. The study revealed that 18 articles deal with trust in 
healthcare or assistance systems but several of them only superfi-
cially. None of the identified studies focused explicitly on trust in 
Ambient Assisted Living despite of the increasing market rele-
vance in the last decade. Older people as target group for qualita-
tive and quantitative research in this field are detected and par-
tially examined. Obtaining access to older persons’ trust in auto-
mation in general and Ambient Assisted Living work systems need 
further research. 
Keywords-Ambient Assisted Living; Assistive Technology; Auto-
mation; Elderly People; Trust. 
 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
 
As a result of demographic change, the number of peo-
ple in advanced age, who want to spend a self-determined, 
independent life at home, is growing. Unfortunately, not all 
elderly people are able to reach this goal without assistance. 
This often leads to conflicting goals. An age-related decline 
in physical fitness as well as physical limitations in conse-
quence of diseases or accidents mean that elderly need sup-
port in realizing their desire for living in their familiar sur-
roundings. This results in a tension between traditional per-
sonal care, new technical support and also affordability of 
individual support.  
 
On the one hand, personal care can be provided by the 
family or human caregivers. Human assistance in activities 
of daily living (ADL) like taking a bath, preparing meal or 
going for a walk is a great relief for people with health re-
strictions. On the other hand, science deals for several dec-
ades with the research of new technologies to support peo-
ple in their own home [56]. Meanwhile, innovations in the 
home environment offer numerous opportunities for tech-
nology-supported systems. Researchers have developed a 
plurality of services combined with technical support for 
elderly people. Terms as ‘Smart House’ [35], ‘Smart 
Home’ [69], ‘Assistive Technology (AT)’ [57] or ‘Ambient 
Assisted Living (AAL)’ [16] are just a few of the frequently 
used terms in this context.  
 
In this article, the importance of trust in assistance 
technology for elderly people is in the center of interest. For 
using AAL, technology which assists an impaired person in 
everyday life [4], the user needs trust in this assistance sys-
tem. Since in case of emergency the assistance can save 
lives, it can be quickly realized that trust has fundamental 
meaning in the consideration of development, purchase and 
use of AAL. The fact that older people, who are typically 
not grown up with technologies like personal computer, 
smart phone or Internet, which are often integrated in AAL 
[15], implies special demands towards the design of these 
devices. 
 
The present study is structured as follows: The back-
ground section contains the development of AAL as effect 
to the demographic change and the importance of trust as 
influence factor in this research context. In the third section 
the literature review as research framework is described in 
detail. Following, the acquired data are analysed in its en-
tirety and moreover, studies regarding trust in healthcare 
and assistance systems are considered separately. Finally, a 
discussion of the received results and an overview about 
further research activities is demonstrated.

BACKGROUND 
This section contains the background information 
about the development of AAL as reaction to the demo-
graphic change as well as trust as influence factor for AAL. 
A. 
Development of AAL as Reaction to the Demo-
graphic Change 
 
According to the United Nations Department of Eco-
nomic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) in the total population 
the proportion of people over the age of 60 years is con-
stantly increasing [75]. Compared to more than 700 million 
in 2009 the number of people over the age of 60 is pre-
dicted to grow to 2 billion in the year 2050. Worldwide this 
would correspond to a tripling in a period of 40 years. The 
annual growth rate of the ‘generation 60plus’ amounts 2.6 
per cent. This enlargement surpasses the overall popula-
tion’s growth rate of 1.2 per cent per annum. At the present 
time, over a fifth of the population in the more developed 
regions is 60 years of age or over. Prediction for the year 
2050 show that nearly one third of the total population will 
belong to that age group [75]. These facts underline the 
economic significance of this age group.  
 
Moreover, technological progress and a high degree of 
information technology are factors that gain more and more 
relevance in everyday life. The beginning of research in the 
field of Assistive Technology (AT) can be followed to the 
early 1970’s. The so called phone chains used the standard

telephone system and were organized by a network of eld-
erly and professionals [56]. Mutual telephone calls were 
used for regular control and once a member of the group 
did not respond, the doctor or relatives were notified. This 
can be regarded as the first working electronically emer-
gency system for elderly persons.  
 
The next step was the development of home emergency 
call systems. One of the most famous was the HTS831, 
which had two different buttons: A red one and a green one. 
Moreover, the system implied a wireless transmitter, which 
the user can wear around the neck. In case of emergency 
the user can either push the button at the transmitter or the 
red button at the station to contact the emergency center. As 
a security and monitoring function, the user had to press the 
green button once a day [56]. In the middle of the 1990’s, 
the first video conference system for private homes was 
offered. Installed TV-top boxes or a separate video tele-
phone functioned as a user interface. Additionally, this sys-
tem contains functions for personal discussions and organi-
zation of, e.g., nursing, medical or entertainment services 
[20]. To sum up, the effort to develop useful and coherent 
life assistance services which aid older persons to live long-
er in their home existed for several decades.  
 
In the last few years, due to the knowledge about the 
growing distribution of older people and the technological 
progress, the construction of AAL has significantly in-
creased in their importance. A lot of national and interna-
tional Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and re-
search projects were focusing on this topic. As a result, 
different concepts have entered the market [7, 15, 19, 68]. 
For instance, by sensory floor mats which register move-
ments in the living ambiance and react by automatically 
turning the lights on the risk of falling can be reduced [64]. 
Another example of AAL can be found in the combination 
of personal and technological support offered by the Fraun-
hofer Institute. By means of summarizing and demand-
oriented analyzing of sensor data, an individualization of 
care as well as nursing services is possible [15]. These two 
examples belong to the concept of AAL (Ambient Assisted 
Living). Reference [16] as first defined AAL “as the use of 
AmI [Ambient Intelligence] in everyday live. Assisted 
means assistance, by technical devices as well as by techni-
cal or human services” [16]. In 2007, a more elaborate 
definition of AAL traces back to [4]. Hereafter, AAL de-
lineates “living in a smart technology supported environ-
ment that reacts sensitive and adaptive to the presence of 
people and objects and thus provides various services to the 
human. The aim is to preserve, enlarge and extend the per-
sonal freedom and autonomy, by promoting and supporting 
the personal independence” [4; translated by the authors]. 
 
In contrast to home automation [40], AAL limited not 
only to life in relation to housing, but extends to all areas of 
life. AAL focuses on the assistance functions of an adaptive 
overall system while home automation deals mainly with 
automation and networking of devices. AAL has set itself 
the objective of maintaining, increasing and extending the 
user’s personal freedom and autonomy. Summarizing, AAL 
systems are intended for people with health impairments 
which have need for security and furthermore communica-
tion requirements to prevent loneliness. The present Euro-
pean research focuses on these overall requirements of eld-
erly persons. Since the concept of AAL regards on these 
holistic requirements, the importance of trust in AAL needs 
a more profound understanding.  
B.  
Trust as Influence Factor for AAL 
 
As seen in [47], trust in medical technology is empiri-
cally different from trust in other technology. Moreover, 
trust plays an important role in multiple user groups as pa-
tients and physicians [46]. These research findings imply 
that the factor trust has to be considered in the development 
of medical and healthcare products and has effects in the 
usage of AAL systems by older people. To emphasize the 
diversity of the construct trust there are added numerous 
‘trust relationships’. Inter-personal trust, social trust and 
trust in automation can be mentioned. Inter-personal trust 
comprises a human’s trust with another human whereas 
social trust characterizes trust with a system or an institu-
tion [6]. The so called trust in automation designates a hu-
man’s trust with a technology or a device [46]. 
 
It can be found that trust is an attitude toward technol-
ogy that affects reliance and which can be gauged. More-
over, people have the tendency to rely on technology they 
have trust in and to reject technology they do not trust [33]. 
When people trust automation, the usage is often influenced 
positively [31, 32]. But also negative examples exist due to 
inappropriate calibration of user trust [53]. It can be men-
tioned that, if trust is not calibrated to the true capacity of 
the system, users may over rely (misuse) or under rely/ re-
ject (disuse) on the automation [54]. Based on [46] which 
deal with patients and healthcare providers in obstetric 
work systems, important implications for trust in healthcare 
systems and AAL-Technology emerge. The study demon-
strates that trust building in medical technology transpires - 
not only in a relationship between doctor and patient or 
patient and technology. There is a complex network of rela-
tionships, which ultimately forms a ‘network of trust’ in 
technology use.  
 
Already [50] observed a network of trust in supervisory 
control systems. In addition to the system she included sys-
tem designer, operators, management and society as other 
actors. Trust as factor given to AAL systems, is also af-
fected by a large proportion of implicit trust in the network 
around the use of the actual technology. Following the ‘Ac-
tor Network Theory’ [8, 30], the reliance on the network 
located around the AAL system, is equally important for 
the usage of assistive technology. As an example, for [73] 
the use of a defibrillator implies not only trust in the prod-
uct and its functions but also in the network around this 
product. This network includes product designer, the or-
ganization which implements the product and the coaches, 
explaining the technology to the inexperienced users [73]. 
As it were, distrust in health care provider can also lead to 
patients’ distrust in medical technology or the hospital per 
156

se [45]. Therefore, consideration of the social system or 
work system [18], which wrapped technology, is necessary 
for an understanding of trust. Reference [46] clarified that 
in case of complex medical or assistance technology, build-
ing trust in automation is more precisely building trust in a 
work system. Furthermore, during the use of the same sys-
tem the perspectives of multiple user groups (end user, rela-
tives, and health care provider) are various [46]. Summariz-
ing, it can be seen that there are a lot of factors which differ 
in the formation of trust and which have to be considered in 
the development and application of AAL. 
 
The objective of the present study was the numeric investi-
gation of trust in automation and home assistance systems 
in the existing literature.   
 
III.  
RESEARCH FRAMEWORK 
A literature review was executed to reveal the relevant 
scientific approaches in the context of trust in AAL, health-
care assistance systems and other automation. By means of 
this research method, information about how extensively 
the issue is previously addressed in the research can be 
demonstrated. To increase the precision of the literature 
review in this innovative and fast-moving research field, 
relevant articles were identified by means of computerized 
search in the online bibliographic databases ‘Web of Sci-
ence’ [72] ‘PubMed’ [59] and ‘PsycINFO’ [58] starting in 
November 2010 up to a publication date of January 2011. 
The three database searches are carried out with filter. In 
‘Web of Science’ key search terms are filtered by topic, in 
‘PubMed’ by MeSH Terms and in ‘PsycINFO’ by key-
words. These three different terminologies represent the 
generic terms for the search algorithm in the respective 
database.

*Search included stated terms and derivates (e.g., age, aging, aged). 
 
For investigation in the three databases, 150 dissimilar 
search term combinations are performed in each setting. 
The used key search terms are presented in Table I. The 
first search requests always contain a term of the categories 
'Attributes' and 'Auxiliaries'. At first, the term trust has been 
set and was queried alternately with the keywords of the 
descriptor 'Auxiliaries'. After carrying out these searches, 
the term reliance was set and also requested with those 
from the second category. Then, the already carried out 30 
search combinations have been linked sequentially to the 
concepts of the third descriptor 'Population'. By extending 
the research with these four search terms and consideration 
of the abbreviations AAL and ATS, ultimately 150 searches 
per database were performed.  
 
Due to the large number of search combinations and 
potentially relevant studies, the search results are already 
reviewed to further availability during the database search. 
For this, both title and abstract are considered. Afterwards, 
to identify the relevant full text articles a set of exclusion 
criteria are selected. For inclusion in the literature review 
articles had to fulfil the following criteria:  
(1) The study described explicitly the connection be-
tween trust and automation or assistive technology, where-
by trust is seen as an influence factor for the interaction 
with the system  
 
(2) The article was published in a journal or presented 
on an international conference 
 
(3) Studies which were first presented on a conference 
and afterwards published with identical findings as a jour-
nal article were only taken into consideration with the jour-
nal release  
 
(4) The publication was written in English  
 
(5) Due to the database research date, studies are in-
cluded until January 2011. 
A data form was used to remove the important infor-
mation for each relevant article. After structuring the arti-
cles and integrating the data in the fact sheet, a detailed data 
analysis was undertaken. 
IV. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
 
The previously described 150 search term combina-
tions in each database identified in a first step 8.498 poten-
tially relevant articles for the literature review. By means of 
the structural query, the database 'Web of Science’ has of-
fered 4.401 publications. The database 'PubMed' yielded 
3.855 results and the search requests in 'PsycINFO' could 
emerge 242 studies. Owing to the consideration of the 
above described five exclusion criteria, after analyzing ti-
tles and abstracts of the 8.498 studies, 164 publications are 
factored in the next part of the review. In this step, the full-
text of these 164 articles was reviewed. After analysis of 
the full text versions, 92 articles were included for the fur-
ther literature analysis. With regard to the exclusion crite-
ria, totally 72 of the revealed studies were excluded.  Thus, 
56 per cent remains of the original 164 articles. Fig. 1 gives 
a numerical overview about the structural sequence of the 
literature research.  
 
Because of the five exclusion criteria shown above, 72 
articles (44 per cent) were excluded after the full-text re-
view. Most of the studies (48 articles) are not relevant due 
to the wrong topic focus. These 48 articles, among 15 stud-
ies which had focused on trust in websites or online plat-
forms as well as trust in e-commerce applications are not 
followed up owing that exclusion criterion. Further 17 stud-
ies are eliminated since they were not published on a con-
ference or in a journal. The last seven excluded articles are

published once in a journal and additionally published on a 
conference with almost identical results. These studies are 
only considered one time with the more actual journal arti-
cle in our results. Thus, in the end, 92 articles were ana-
lyzed in detail in the literature review.

These articles comprise the topics trust in automotive 
[1, 10, 28, 34, 60, 70], aviation [2, 5, 23, 29, 37, 38, 53, 63, 
78], combat identification [13, 61, 62, 77, 80], general 
design advancement [25, 33, 36, 49, 55], supervisory 
control systems [3, 31, 32, 39, 48, 79], healthcare and 
assistance systems [21, 22, 42, 43, 44, 66] and others [14, 
41]. 
A. 
Data analyses of overall results 
 
In the next step, the data sheet with the overall studies 
has been analyzed (A) and compared with the results from 
the topic trust in healthcare and assistance systems (B). 
 
(1) Publication date  
Between 1987 and 1991 only two studies are published in 
this context [49, 67] The first experiment of trust in a hu-
man-machine supervisory control system was realized by 
[31]. Whereas, until 1999, 15 studies are published in total, 
from 2000 to 2010, 77 articles with regard to trust in tech-
nology and assistance systems can be found. Since 2003, 
every year six studies or more are indicated. In 2008, a 
maximum of 11 relevant articles can be revealed. 
 
(2) Type of study 
 
In a next step, the distinction between conceptual and 
empirical/experimental articles can be examined. From the 
overall 92 reviewed studies, 22 consider conceptual and 70 
empirical methods for their research. These conceptual arti-
cles comprise former summaries and literature reviews (12 
articles) as well as articles with the focus on framework, 
model or questionnaire development (10 articles). The 70 
empirical articles can be differentiated into quantitative and 
qualitative research methods. Since 1987, viewed overall 62 
quantitative studies (including experiments, online, postal 
or paper standardized questionings or a combination of ex-
periment and questioning) were identified. It can be ob-
served, that solely five studies include questionings only. In 
contrast, 57 studies used experiments or a combination of 
experiments and questionnaires for measuring trust. By 
comparison, eight articles with qualitative methods as 
qualitative interviews, workshops and focus group inter-
views were considered.  
 
(3) Participants characteristics 
 
In a next step, the participants’ age distribution should 
be considered. In order to receive a better understanding of 
the participants in experiments or surveys, a clustering in 
five age groups was conducted. These groups were subdi-
vided into ‘participants younger than 30 years’ ‘participants 
from 30 to 60 years’, as well as ‘participants older than 60 
years’. Moreover, one age group comprised a combination 
of younger (< 30 years) as well as older (> 60 years) par-
ticipants. Further studies performed experiments or inter-
views without age differentiation.  
 
Regarding the 70 empirical studies, in 22 of the studies 
and hence 31 per cent, there was no age differentiation de-
clared. In 35 surveys participants were younger than 30 
years and in five surveys between the age of 30 and 60 
years. Only in eight surveys (16 per cent of overall) partici-
pants were older than 60 years. In five articles the partici-
pants exclusively belong to the age group over 60 years. In 
three further studies both, younger participants (< 30 years) 
and people over the age of 60 were examined. 
 
Participation rates range from an experiment with six 
[26] or a qualitative interview with nine participants [76] to 
a postal survey with 1187 participants [9]. In total, in 43 of 
the articles (61 per cent) less than 50 participants have tak-
en part in the surveys to trust in automation or assistance 
systems. In eight studies between 51 and 100 and in 16 
studies between 101 and 500 participants were involved. 
Reference [9] was the only study with more than 500 par-
ticipants. In two articles there was no participant number 
specified. Moreover, only three out of the surveys con-
tained a limitation with regard to the gender. One study by 
[43] questioned 24 women, or rather 24 mothers who have 
recently given birth. In two other articles, only male par-
ticipants, once pilots [71] and one time male students [51] 
were regarded. In 38 surveys both gender were examined 
and 29 surveys had not make an explicit distinction. 
 
(4) Publication type 
 
Another study detail can be carried out by the differen-
tiation between ‘conference vs. journal publication’. 
Among the 92 examined articles, 18 articles (20 per cent) 
were presented at a corresponding conference and 74 arti-
cles published in a journal. The journal with the most publi-
cations and major interest in the research of trust and auto-
mation was ‘Human Factors’ with a total of 21 articles (23 
per cent). By far, the journal ‘Ergonomic’ with eight rele-
vant articles, the ‘International Journal of Industrial Ergo-
nomics’ with four and several journals with three studies 
are following.

B. 
Data analysis of studies regarding trust in health-
care and assistance systems’ 
 
This rising relevance of the concept trust which can be 
found in the different research topics can also be supported 
through the numbers of relevant articles in trust and 
‘healthcare and assistance systems’. In this field of research 
the interest is growing in the last decade.  
 
(1) Publication date  
The first published paper related to trust in healthcare 
automation was presented in 2002. The conference paper by 
[42] was the first article that emphasizes the factor trust. 
From this point on until January 2011, 18 articles can be 
found. These articles deal with reliance on healthcare, 
medical or household assistance systems. In the years 2003, 
2004 and 2006 no publications within this context can be 
found, whereas since 2007, every year articles are consid-
ered. In 2010, the largest number with five studies in this 
context can be found. Fig. 2 gives a detailed overview 
about the annual distribution of the found studies in the 
cluster ‘healthcare and assistance systems‘ in comparison to 
the other topics. As can be seen, the importance of a con-
scious handling and perception of the concept trust in com-
bination with automation and particularly healthcare and 
assistance systems is increasing in the last years. The first 
study with regard to trust in automation and human-
machine interaction was published in 1987 [49]. In contrast, 
the first publication regarding trust as variable for develop-
ing healthcare systems for older persons was presented in 
2002 [42].

(2) Type of study 
 
Four of the 18 articles in this cluster used conceptual 
methodologies. Three articles focused on framework or 
model development [21, 42, 44] and one study summarized 
the relevance of training in technology used by tele-home 
care nurses [66]. Moreover, 14 articles included empirical 
research– seven used quantitative and seven qualitative 
methods. The publications with quantitative methodologies 
are divided into three studies with a combination of ques-
tionnaire and experimental design, two studies with exclu-
sive questionnaire surveys and two experiments. The quali-
tative research exclusively consists of articles with qualita-
tive interviews. 
 
In comparison, within the other topics quantitative 
studies with a number of 55 studies predominate. In par-
ticular, in new research areas qualitative surveys are util-
ized to get a detailed understanding of the topic. For this 
comprehension, the focus is set on qualitative interviews as 
occurred in the research area of trust in healthcare and as-
sistance systems. Seven of the overall 18 studies (39 per 
cent) included qualitative interviews with individuals or 
workshop and focus group discussions. In 2010, four stud-
ies used qualitative interviews which show that researchers 
are still in the process of developing a detailed understand-
ing. Given, that general research on trust in human-machine 
interaction has started in 1987 [49] and to this day ambigui-
ties in this context exist [23, 29, 52] it is understandable 
that qualitative interviews are still used in the present re-
search area. 
 
(3) Participants characteristics 
 
For the 14 empirical articles an age group differentia-
tion was performed. In three of the studies, participants are 
younger than 30 years and in one study they are between 30 
and 60 years. Moreover, five of the articles consider par-
ticipants over the age of 60 years. Further two studies con-
sider a combination of younger and older participants and 
three surveys give no information about age differentiation. 
In case of the work system in healthcare and assistance sys-
tems as AAL, the end user most time is over the age of 60. 
Therefore, it is of immense relevance that this target group 
will be considered in the research. Fig. 3 displays the previ-
ous study numbers in which participants over 60 years were 
involved.

As can be seen, in the other clusters the target group of 
people over the age of 60 plays only a subordinate role. 
Only one author has considered elderly persons’ trust in a 
human-decision aid system and compared the results to 
people younger than 30 years [14].  
 
In contrast, in the healthcare sector researchers have 
focused more on the age group over 60 years. Of the total

of eight studies that have dealt with participants over 60 
years, seven studies (88 per cent) are located in this cluster. 
Two studies have taken a differentiation of younger and 
elderly persons into account [22, 65]. Moreover, five arti-
cles have exclusively focused on people over 60 years [11, 
17, 24, 27, 76]. With a percentage rate of 50 per cent of the 
overall studies which are analyzing the factor trust in 
healthcare and assistance systems by experiments or sur-
veys, the age group over 60 years is strongly represented.  
 
Concerning the number of participants in the topic 
‘healthcare and assistance systems‘, in nine of the studies 
the participant rate has amounted less than 50 participants. 
In two studies the participant rate ranged from 51 to 100 
persons and three articles take more than 100 participants 
into account. These articles also include the reference [9] 
with a postal questionnaire of 1187 people. With reference 
to the participant rate it can be highlighted that the study 
with the most participants [9] as well as one of the studies 
with the less participants (n=9) [76] belong to the topic trust 
in healthcare and assistance systems. 
 
Regarding the gender distinction within the different 
methodological designs, 12 articles have regarded both sex-
es; one article made no differentiation and one study [43] 
viewed only female participants. This study with solely 
female participants interviewed 24 women who recently 
have given birth. They were questioned in a qualitative in-
terview to analyze trust in medical technology and obstet-
rics work system [43]. For the observation of this complex 
work system additionally interviews with care providers 
were conducted [46]. Furthermore, it can be said that 
healthcare and technical support for elderly persons are 
themes which concern men and women equally. Therefore, 
it seems logical that most of the studies deal with both gen-
ders.  
 
(4) Publication type  
 
Moreover, among the 18 studies, six articles (33 per 
cent) are presented as conference papers and 12 articles (67 
per cent) were published in journals. The journal ‘Ergo-
nomics’ with two publications was the only one which was 
represented several times. The author Enid Montague with 
four research studies since 2009 has taken a pioneering role 
in context of trust and healthcare technology [43, 44, 46, 
47]. Additionally, Coughlin et al. [11, 12] and Ho et al. [21, 
22] are listed with two articles.  
 
Due to the actuality of the research field, the distribu-
tion of articles presented on conferences and published in 
journals can be explained. From the overall 18 studies in 
the healthcare cluster, 12 were published in journals and six 
studies were presented on conferences. By comparison, 
from 74 articles within the other topics, 62 were published 
in journals and 12 studies, thus 16 per cent, were presented 
on conferences.  
 
V. 
DISCUSSION 
 
The significant increase of elderly persons due to the 
demographic change and the resulting rise in purchasing 
power affects the development of reliable AAL systems 
[74]. Since 2005 the European and national sponsoring pro-
grams for AAL steadily increase and the relevance of sup-
ported living in home environment which enlarges and 
promotes the personal independence growth up. Moreover, 
it is difficult to understand that AAL has absolutely no con-
sideration in connection with measuring trust so far. The 
search combinations ‘reliance or trust’ and ‘Ambient As-
sisted Living/ AAL’ yielded none results in the current lit-
erature study. Until January 2011, there was no study ex-
plicitly examining trust in AAL systems. Moreover, the 
relevance of measuring trust in healthcare technology and 
assistance systems is not prominent within the research 
results. It can be seen that the consideration of trust in con-
nection with healthcare, medical technology or assistance 
systems is still in an initial stage. A few studies considered 
trust in intelligent home systems [12], smart home [11], 
telemedicine systems [24], as well as automation [65] or 
technology [76] at home. Furthermore, it must be noticed, 
that there is no consistent terminology for assistance sys-
tems for elderly persons. None systematic approach and 
documentation as well as a uniform technology and under-
standing exist in research, which complicated measuring 
trust.  
 
One the one hand, these results could imply that the 
topic is not relevant for the scholarship. On the other hand, 
due to the increasing number of studies in the last decade 
this statement can be disproved. Analyzing the publication 
date shows that all relevant articles are composed in this 
period. It can be seen that the research focus has gained in 
importance in the last decade.  
 
Another interesting fact can be found in the different 
frequency distribution of quantitative and qualitative stud-
ies. In the analysis of the type of study it can be highlighted 
that researchers who are regarding trust in healthcare and 
assistance systems use qualitative as well as quantitative 
methodologies. The fact that trust in 'healthcare and assis-
tance systems depends not only on the single technology 
but furthermore on a complex work system [46, 73], under-
lines the relevance of more research in this topic. 
 
Moreover, researchers have recognized that partici-
pants’ characteristics of elderly have been taken into ac-
count. An analysis of trust in this sector can only be real-
ized with the integration of people over the age of 60. 
Seven articles in the last decade consider older participants’ 
trust in healthcare and home assistance systems. The in-
creasing demand and importance of AAL due to the higher 
life expectancy and demographic shift clarify a consider-
able backlog demand in measuring elderly persons’ trust in 
AAL. Moreover, it requires more research in this age group 
to close the gap of the few studies and less quantitative re-
sults. 
Finally, it can be summarized that by reason of the 
novelty of the research of measuring trust as influence fac-
tor for using healthcare and assistance systems the exact 
influence of trust cannot be quantified. Only 18 articles 
which cover that topic were found owing to the literature 
160

review. Initial developments reveal that trust in healthcare 
and medical technology differs from reliance on other tech-
nologies [47] Reference [44] examined a tool to measure 
patients’ trust in medical technology, which may be useful 
for further quantitative research. Actually, a small number 
of studies had examined the complex network of trust in the 
equally complex subject AAL for elderly persons. Both, 
qualitative and quantitative research is required to meet the 
high demand of the next years. Furthermore, elderly per-
sons as participants must take more into account for meas-
uring and understanding trust in an AAL work system. For 
obtaining access to elderly persons’ trust in an AAL work 
system a deeper understanding of their needs as well as 
fears and worries is essential. Additionally, trust of refer-
ence persons may have influence in using AAL. For re-
searchers and designers of AAL recognizing the influence 
factor trust will support the development of marketable 
solutions.  
The knowledge gained by the literature review pro-
vides potential for further research. In the following, a mul-
tidimensional model of trust in AAL will underline the sig-
nificance of this research area. Based on different types of 
trust interacting in an AAL service network, a generally 
accepted model due to the existing literature and a require-
ment analysis with older people and service provider will 
be developed. Furthermore, a questionnaire distributed with 
the support of a healthcare service provider will be per-
formed to validate the theoretical trust model. Experiments 
in different surroundings and various AAL test designs will 
be implemented afterwards to evaluate the influence factor 
trust in AAL. 
LIMITATIONS 
The systematic review had to fight some limitations in 
the research process. First, the selection of online databases 
should be considered. Literature for trust in automation and 
healthcare can be seen as an interdisciplinary field. There-
fore three bibliographic databases were used. ‘Web of Sci-
ence’ comprised interdisciplinary content across 256 disci-
plines the database ‘PubMed’, focuses on healthcare con-
tent and ‘PsycINFO’, psychological literature. Due to this 
selection, articles which are not integrated in these data-
bases are excluded for the review. Second, the information 
provided in the articles is very heterogenic. Some include a 
specific description about the experimental design, while 
other studies fail to provide detailed information. Third, due 
to the fact, that only English language articles were in-
cluded into the review, a distorted picture is drawn, because 
the studies found and included focus on English-speaking 
authors. Fourth and finally, the studies included in the lit-
erature review were screened until January 2011. Thus, 
articles which were published afterwards are not considered 
for this systematic review.
