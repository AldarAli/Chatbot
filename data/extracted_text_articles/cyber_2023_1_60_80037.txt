SPECIFICATION OF A NEXT GENERATION ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE-BASED LEARNING PLATFORM 
Next-generation 
AI-based 
learning 
platforms 
are 
educational 
systems 
that 
use 
artificial 
intelligence 
technologies to enhance the learning experience for students. 
These platforms have several characteristics that set them 
apart from traditional learning environments. Here are some 
key features of next-generation AI-based learning platforms: 
1. 
Personalization of learning content: AI enables 
these platforms to tailor learning content to each individual 
student's needs, abilities, and learning style. By analyzing 
data, about the student's past performance, preferences, and 
behavior, 
the 
platform 
can 
provide 
personalized 
recommendations, adaptive exercises, and targeted feedback. 
This personalized approach helps students learn at their own 
pace and focus on areas where they need improvement.

learning platforms often include AI-powered intelligent 
tutoring systems. These systems can provide personalized 
guidance, answer student questions, and offer explanations 
tailored to individual needs. They can simulate one-on-one 
tutoring by understanding the student's strengths and 
weaknesses, diagnosing misconceptions, and providing 
targeted interventions to improve understanding. 
4. 
Data-driven insights: AI-based learning platforms 
collect and analyze vast amounts of data about student 
performance, interactions, and learning patterns. This data can 
be used to gain insights into student progress, identify areas 
for improvement, and inform instructional decisions. 
Educators can use these insights to provide targeted support 
and interventions, track student progress over time, and make 
data-driven decisions to improve the learning experience. 
III. 
SUCCESS FACTORS AND REQUIREMENTS OF AN AI-

IV. 
ADAPTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS AND 
PERSONALIZATION 
In the context of adaptive learning environments and 
personalization of learning content, Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) can use various methods and techniques to customize the 
learning process for each individual learner. Below are some 
possible AI methods: 
    Adaptive Learning Paths: AI can be used to determine 
the optimal learning path for each learner based on their 
individual needs, prior knowledge, and learning styles. By 
analyzing data, such as learning history, test scores, and 
feedback, AI can provide personalized recommendations for 
the order and difficulty of learning content. This ensures that 
each learner learns at their own level and pace. 
    Adaptive content delivery: AI can help select and 
deliver the most relevant learning content for each learner. 
Based on the learner's interests, proficiency level, and 
preferred learning style, AI can apply algorithms to select 
appropriate content from a wide range of learning materials. 
This can increase learner motivation and engagement by 
providing them with content that is most relevant and 
interesting to them. 
    Automated assessment and feedback: AI techniques, 
such as machine learning and Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) can be used to automatically assess learning tasks, 
tests, or hands-on exercises. AI can analyze learners' 
responses and generate real-time feedback to identify errors, 
suggest improvements, and detect comprehension issues. This 
allows learners to receive immediate feedback and improve 
their performance. 
    Sentiment analysis and emotion detection: By 
analyzing user behavior, interactions, and communications on 
the platform, AI can use techniques, such as sentiment 
analysis and emotion recognition to understand the emotional 
state of learners. This information can be used to provide 
personalized support, such as targeted resources or activities 
to reduce frustration or maintain interest. 
    Chatbots and virtual assistants: AI-powered chatbots 
or virtual assistants can help learners with questions, 
problems, or for additional explanation. These systems can 
use natural language processing to provide human-like 
interactions and be available to learners 24/7 as needed. 
It is important to note that these AI methods are not used 
in isolation but can be connected and integrated to create a 
33

comprehensive adaptive learning environment that meets 
learners' individual needs. 
V. 
ARCHITECTURE AND SYTSEM DESIGN OF A NEXT 
GENERATION AI-BASED LEARNING PLATFORM 
The architecture of a next-generation AI-based learning 
platform can vary depending on specific requirements and 
design choices. However, here is a high-level overview of the 
components typically found in such platforms: 
Frontend: The frontend is responsible for the user 
interface and user experience. It provides the interface through 
which learners, instructors, and administrators interact with 
the platform. Common technologies used for frontend 
development include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, and frameworks, 
such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. These frameworks provide 
flexibility, responsiveness, and rich interactive features.

VI. 
GAMIFICATION AND 6 PLAYER TYPES 
With the advent of gamification - the use of game elements 
in non-game contexts - the HEXAD model was developed by 
Marczewski [4]. The HEXAD model distinguishes six 
different types of gamers [4]: 
Intrinsically Motivated Types: 4 
Relatedness (Socialisers): Socialisers are motivated by 
relationships. They want to interact with others and create 
social connections. 
Autonomy (Free Spirits): Free Spirits are motivated by 
autonomy and self-expression. They want to create and 
explore. 
Mastery (Achievers): Achievers are motivated by excellence. 
They are out to learn new things and improve themselves. 
They seek challenges that they can overcome. 
Purpose (Philanthropists): Philanthropists are motivated by 
purpose and meaning. This group is altruistic and wants to 
give to others and enrich the lives of others in some way 
without expecting a reward. 
Extrinsically Motivated Types: 1 
Players: Players are motivated by rewards. They do what is 
what they are asked to do, in order to collect rewards from a 
system. system. They are only in it for themselves.  
Change-Oriented Types: 1 
Disruptors: Disruptors are motivated by change. In general, 
they want to disrupt systems, either directly or with the other 
users to force positive or negative change. or negative 
changes.  
The determination of HEXAD Gamification User Types is 
based on the use of a specially developed questionnaire, the 
HEXAD Gamification User Types Questionnaire [4]. This 
questionnaire was developed by Marczewski and his 
colleagues and is an important part of the HEXAD 
framework. 
The HEXAD User Types Survey consists of a series of 
questions that address the specific characteristics and 
motivations of the six HEXAD player types. The questions 
are designed to be answered on a five-point Likert scale 
ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree." 
The responses to these questions are then analyzed 
quantitatively to determine which HEXAD gamification user 
type a user is likely to be. 
The work "The Gamification User Types HEXAD Scale" 
by Tondello et al. is an important addition to HEXAD theory 
and has contributed to the development and validation of the 
HEXAD User Types Survey [5]. The study strengthens the 
theoretical basis of the HEXAD model and provides 
empirical evidence of its validity. To validate the HEXAD 
User Types Scale, Tondello and his team conducted several 
studies [5]. The scale serves as a measurement tool to identify 
and quantify the six user types. The authors were able to show 
that their research results confirmed the existence of the six 
player types and demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
questionnaire in measuring them. The size of the 
questionnaire could be reduced from 30 to 24 questions, with 
comparable accuracy of the results. 
In addition, the work provides valuable insight into the 
relationships between the different player types. For 
example, the results show that Philanthropists and Achievers 
often exhibit positive correlations, suggesting that users who 
are identified as one of these gamer types are also likely to 
exhibit characteristics of the other. 
This is consistent with Marczewski's observations that 
people cannot be reduced to simple individual player types 
and exhibit these characteristics to varying degrees [4].

CYBER 2023 : The Eighth International Conference on Cyber-Technologies and Cyber-Systems

In April 2023, HEXAD-12, a shortened version of the 
original HEXAD-Scale questionnaire, was released [7]. 
HEXAD-12 addresses the challenges posed by the 
extensive 24-question questionnaire of the original scale, 
such as high dropout rates and participant fatigue. By 
reducing it to 12 questions, HEXAD-12 provides a more 
efficient and compact tool for assessing user types in 
gamification, particularly suited for limited interaction 
modalities, such as on mobile devices. Despite its brevity, 
HEXAD-12 retains a reliability and validity comparable to or 
better than the original HEXAD scale. 
Importantly, a user's player type is not static. Marczewski 
emphasizes that users change between different player types 
depending on context, environment, and over time [4]. 
Therefore, determining user type should be viewed as a 
continuous process that requires regular iterations of the 
HEXAD User Types Survey requires. 
An important finding is the practical applicability of the 
HEXAD Player types for the design of gamification 
applications. Through the player types of a user, designers 
can better understand what motivates their better understand 
what motivates their users, and create appropriate, 
individually tailored experiences. By knowing the dominant 
player type player type of a user, gamified features can be 
better tailored to individual needs and preferences better, 
leading to increased user engagement [6]. 
VII. 
CYBERSECURITY AND IT AWARENESS TRAINING 
Cybersecurity and IT awareness [Definition]: IT and 
cybersecurity awareness mean problem awareness and secure 
behavior. In everyday dealings with IT systems, awareness is 
an elementary security measure. First, this means creating an 
awareness of the problem of cyber security attacks and threats. 
Building on this, it is possible to achieve a change in behavior 
toward secure digital use. Security awareness measures are 
successful if they empower the target groups and motivate 
individuals to improve their cyber security. It is important to 
develop awareness at eye level and in a practical manner [1]. 
As a first step towards a next-generation learning platform, 
we have implemented an IT Awareness Learning Platform 
with an AI chatbot as a demonstrator and prototype: 
An AI-based learning chatbot is an intelligent, speech- or 
text-based dialog system that allows chatting with an artificial 
intelligence. Such an AI-based learning chatbot is to be used 
and tested for the first time as part of an IT awareness training 
for the basic sensitization of employees.  
The AI chatbot delivers the most relevant IT awareness 
content to the learner in a simple and sometimes even playful 
dialog. The AI chatbot breaks down the knowledge into small 
"bites" and delivers them to the user one at a time. 
The IT awareness learning platform with AI chatbots 
delivers expert knowledge on IT awareness and cybersecurity 
to specific target groups: Low-threshold, "in small bites", "for 
in between".  
The user controls the AI learning chatbot through his 
questions, choices and selections. 
 
The following topics are already included in the current IT 
Awareness Learning Platform with AI Chatbots and 
optimized for recognition rates above 75%:

AI-based IT awareness training begins with a user self-
assessment, placement and player type test based on the 
knowledge level of the individual participant. This takes into 
account the user's strengths and weaknesses, as well as their 
individual player type, and ensures that the training is tailored 
to the individual. 
According to the player's type, the user is then offered 
suitable gamification elements so that the user receives a 
personalized offer. Thus, a first version of a customizable 
learning environment was prototypically realized for a 
cybersecurity and IT awareness training. 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
  Individualized learning paths: In IT awareness and 
cybersecurity 
training, 
learners 
come 
from 
diverse 
backgrounds and have varying levels of technical knowledge.  
Our next-generation learning platform can personalize 
learning content based on each learner's existing skills and 
knowledge. This ensures that beginners receive basic 
concepts while advanced learners are exposed to more 
sophisticated cybersecurity topics, resulting in optimized 
learning outcomes. 
 Adaptive learning environment: Cybersecurity threats are 
constantly evolving, making adaptability a critical skill. Our 
learning platform uses adaptive learning environments that 
dynamically adjust the difficulty and complexity of content as 
learners progress. This approach ensures that cybersecurity 
professionals stay up-to-date on the latest threats and defense 
strategies, reducing the risk of cyber incidents. 
Data-driven learning insights: The next generation 
learning platform generates rich data analytics and insights 
into learner progress and performance. In IT awareness and 
cybersecurity training, these analytics provide valuable 
information about learners' strengths and weaknesses, 
enabling trainers to effectively personalize their support and 
interventions, resulting in better skills development. 
Gamified Learning Experience: Cybersecurity training 
can be complex and technical, which can disengage some 
learners. By incorporating gamification elements, such as 
points, badges, and leaderboards, our platform makes the 
learning process engaging and fun. Gamification encourages 
36

learners to stay motivated, track their progress, and strive for 
continuous improvement. 
Flexibility and distance learning: In the fast-paced world 
of IT and cybersecurity, professionals may have limited time 
for training. Our platform offers flexible learning options that 
allow learners to access training materials anytime, anywhere, 
and at their own pace. This flexibility accommodates busy 
schedules and remote work arrangements, making it 
convenient for cybersecurity professionals to continually 
improve their skills. 
In summary, a next-generation learning platform is 
uniquely suited for IT awareness and cybersecurity training 
due to its personalized content delivery, adaptive learning 
environment, and data-driven insights. 
IX. 
OUTLOOK 
In the future, other valuable additions to the Next 
Generation Learning Platform should include the following 
features: 
The learning platform should include realistic threat 
simulations that allow students to engage in simulated 
cyberattacks in a safe environment. This hands-on experience 
strengthens their ability to effectively identify and respond to 
security threats, preparing them for real-world situations. 
Certification and Recognition: In the IT and cybersecurity 
industry, certifications carry significant value and can enhance 
career opportunities. Our learning platform prepares learners 
for industry-standard certifications, giving them the 
knowledge and skills, they need to gain professional 
recognition and excel in their cybersecurity careers.
