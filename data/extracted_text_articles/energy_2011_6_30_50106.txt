Abstract—In order to meet the electric energy needs at the 
beginning of this new millennium, utilities need to provide high 
quality power over a reliable grid, to satisfy customer’s 
growing service quality expectations and to support, as well, a 
wide array of additional new services. One of the solutions is a 
successful power grid management activity such as “Smart 
Distribution” (SD) or Distribution Automation (DA), which 
hinges on the information collected from the grid itself using 
an integrated monitoring system that enables real-time 
monitoring of grid conditions for distribution system 
operators. It allows automatic reconfiguration of the grid to 
optimize the power delivery efficiency and/or reduce the 
impact and duration of outages. The foundation of the 
monitoring system infrastructure is based on transducers, 
sensors and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) collecting 
information throughout the distribution system. Hydro-
Québec (HQ) is showing leadership in this field, conducting 
several projects related to Smart Distribution such as 
Volt&VAR Control (VVC), Fault Location (FL), Power 
Quality Monitoring (PQM) and evaluation of the metering 
potential of major distribution equipment controls, which 
collect raw data from the grid, treat it locally and transfer it to 
system control centers or elsewhere. There, the information is 
used for real time treatment or non real time post treatment. 
This paper discusses the structure and the accuracy of an 
integrated monitoring system based on sensors and IEDs and 
reports on some of the results and conclusions of Hydro-
Québec’s projects related to Smart Grid applications and 
technologies.

 INTRODUCTION 
Electric utilities needs are becoming increasingly difficult 
to meet in the face of an emerging “digital society”, with its 
highly automated and complex industry, computerized 
commercial 
business 
processes, 
changing 
nature 
of 
residential loads and a regulatory environment. All of that 
requires more reliable communication facilities and is 
becoming increasingly sensitive to reliability and quality of 
electrical supply. Momentary supply interruptions or severe 
voltage sags of prolonged duration can cause disruptions 
with significant economic consequences. 
These requirements and constraints have caused the 
utilities to rethink their distribution system in terms of 
distribution automation, sensors, intelligent equipment and 
smart power system functions, in order to achieve its goals. 
With the introduction of new IEDs/controls, classical 
disciplines in distribution like protection, control, metering, 
power quality evaluation and additional automation 
functionalities will come under one responsibility [1]. 
Some intelligent elements already exist in most 
distribution grids and this is the reason that the actual 
distribution 
system 
infrastructure 
(especially 
sensors, 
transducers and IEDs/controls) should be used to gather as 
much information as possible related to network, equipment 
and product (i.e., power quality) to improve the distribution 
system overall performance. 
Nowadays, several manufacturers offer performing 
sensors and IEDs or intelligent controls to improve network 
performance. 
II. 
SMART GRID AND SMART DISTRIBUTION 
Growing service quality expectations make SD processes 
increasingly imperative for the power utilities and trigger the 
next major step in the evolution of distribution systems 
towards a Smart Grid. 
At the beginning, the foundation of the Smart Grid 
concept was based only on applications with smart meters 
affecting the customer side. Then gradually, several DA 
applications, involving new technologies, have been 
implemented through the years and now Smart Grid is what 
its name really means. 
In the past DA consisted mainly in automatic operations, 
conducted by autonomous IEDs/controls, such as fault 
location, isolation and service restoration and voltage 
regulation. Today, advances and falling prices of the 
communication and control technologies, which can be 
embedded in the distribution grid and used for monitoring 
and remote control of various major distribution equipment, 
such as switches, capacitors banks, reclosers and voltage 
regulators, bring along a list of new automated SD 
applications. 
According to the IEEE PES Smart Distribution Working 
Group (SDWG) the following applications can generally be 
identified to SD [2]: 
 
Remote controlling of feeder reclosers and switches,

 
Automatic feeder reconfiguration based on remote 
control of reclosers and switches (includes fault 
detection), 
 
Fault detection (distribution feeder devices), 
 
Fault location (accurate) based on waveform 
analysis, 
 
Capacitor bank control, 
 
Volt & VAR control using sensors on the feeder, 
 
Power Quality measurements (harmonic content), 
 
Distribution overhead grid monitoring (power 
measurements), 
 
Distribution underground grid monitoring and 
control. 
The existing DA deployments and the AMI penetration 
are complimentary technologies, and they will ensure the 
achievement of Smart Grid initiatives taken by utilities 
showing leadership. 
The Figure 1 illustrates the flow of information in a fully 
integrated distribution system. 
A better knowledge of what is happening in the power 
system is needed for an improved management of 
distribution grid. New technologies (sensors, IEDs, software, 
telecommunication) can provide data required by smart 
applications to improve the system efficiency through 
utility’s business needs. It is a necessary feedback loop to 
improve the distribution system performance. The choice of 
applications and technologies could differ from a utility to 
another, depending on each one’s priorities (power 
reliability, PQ, customer satisfaction, environment, etc.) and 
business drivers should decide what applications, what type 
of data and finally what technologies are needed. 
Regardless the path each utility may take to reach the 
intelligent or smart level of distribution system, reducing the 
overall cost is an important utility target and achieving it 
depends a lot on distribution equipment features like 
interoperability or interchangeability.

Figure 1. Distribution Automation: Flow of information 
 
A successful implementation of SD applications requires 
three sets of standards, one for substations, a second one for 
feeders and the third one for customers. Then, is a need for 
coordination between these different standards.  
The new way of thinking and operating the Smart Grid 
created the premises for an integrated distribution 
monitoring system, based on sensors and IEDs capable of 
providing the data required by latest smart distribution 
applications formely known as Advanced Distribution 
Automation (ADA) applications. Some of these devices are 
already in place in substations and along the feeders. 
III. 
SENSORS AND IEDS 
In the early microprocessor based IEDs, metering 
features such as voltage and current rms-values, power 
values, were just simple additional features. Today’s IEDs 
have features, which go far beyond these basic functions 
including frequency, voltage and current harmonic content, 
symmetrical sequences, waveform capture, etc. 
For Smart Grid and SD medium voltage applications, 
manufacturers propose new “Smart Sensors”, which can 
work either autonomously, when equipped with a 
communication interface, or in combination with IEDs. 
Optical current and voltage sensors offer a number of major 
advantages, but because of a price yet high, it will take a 
while before a large number will be integrated to the grid. 
Until then, sensors present at this time on the grid, can be 
used successfully for monitoring purposes in combination 
with major distribution equipment controls (see Figure 2) 
[3].

HYDRO-QUÉBEC AND SMART DISTRIBUTION 
APPLICATIONS 
Hydro-Québec is showing leadership in this field with its 
proposed road map towards a smart grid, which should 
include (see Figure 3):  
 
Grid monitoring (to improve reliability). 
 
Equipment monitoring (to improve maintenance).  
 
Product monitoring (to improve PQ). 
To achieve its ambitious programs on energy efficiency 
and outage duration reduction, Hydro-Québec has focused 
on three targets: 
 
Capacitor banks installation. 
 
Volt control. 
 
Accurate fault location. 
Pilot projects have proven the efficiency and economic 
feasibility of two SD systems, VVC and FL.

Figure 3. Hydro-Québec roadmap to achieve a truly Smart Grid 
 
Another research program targeted the non-revenue 
metering potential of distribution medium voltage sensors 
and IEDs/controls and data integration from these devices. 
Features such as voltage and current measurement accuracy, 
linearity, remote control, communication, data transfer, etc., 
have been evaluated using IREQ’s test facilities. Some 
results and conclusions from previous tests were presented in 
[4]. Results from latest tests are presented further down. 
V. 
IREQ’S TEST FACILITIES 
Besides a large number of laboratories, IREQ has an 
overhead distribution test line allowing research and 
development activities for distribution system, namely 
validation 
and 
certification 
of 
different 
distribution 
equipments (see Figure 4). It includes two feeders and 
different models of sensors, instrument transformers and 
pole-mounted major distribution equipments, which can be 
remotely controlled using available phone, Internet and 
WiMax communication links. The main switchboard for 
network and telecommunications is located in the control 
room. 
The line is mainly used to facilitate tests related to SD 
applications, namely to verify new equipment functionality, 
metering and communications capabilities, remote control 
and command.

TEST RESULTS 
The research project conducted in 2010 included voltage 
and current measurement accuracy tests on medium voltage 
sensors/transducers along with different controls (recloser, 
switch, voltage regulator) present on Hydro-Québec’s 
distribution grid to evaluate the error deadband. The 
evaluation tests were performed on the chain composed by 
two devices, the sensor and the control, and not separately on 
each of them. 
Some tests were performed in laboratory using a system 
composed of one FLUKE 6100A master unit and two 6101A 
slave units. The calibrator provided 60 Hz current sine wave 
to feed standalone sensors (CVMI Lindsey 9660) and 
recloser external current transducers belonging to reclosers 
from 
different 
manufacturers 
(Cooper-VWVE, 
Cooper-Nova, Joslyn-TryMod 300). 
Two setups were constructed; one to measure the 
accuracy of the chain ABB-OVR integral current transducers 
and PCD2000 control and a second one for voltage 
measurement accuracy with power distribution transformers 
(ABB 3 kVA and 10 kVA) and different IEDs/controls. 
The last test evaluated the potential of a voltage regulator 
control (Cooper CL-6A) to measure voltage and current 
using reversible voltage regulator’s integrated PTs and CT. 
A. Current Measurement 
The sensor-IED/control chains submitted to current 
measurement tests are illustrated in Table I. 
The evaluation process was based on average rms-values 
over 5 or 15 minutes, depending on the type of control. 
SEL-651R and PCD2000 measured average rms-values over 
5 minutes and S&C M series did it over 15 minutes.

Recloser with integral current transducers 
For this category, the test was performed on the chain 
composed by integral current transducers of an ABB-OVR 
recloser and its control PCD2000.  
The three-phase recloser poles were connected in series 
and the current transducers were supposed to read the same 
current magnitude. 
The level of current reading error of this chain, for a load 
range from 75 A to 400 A, was inferior to 1 %, which 
corresponds to the current measurement error value provided 
by the manufacturer. The error-load chart for three-phase 
recloser transducers and for currents from 10 A to 400 A is 
illustrated in Figure 6.

external current transducer connected to a SEL-651R control 
and the test results are presented in Figure 7. 
The error chart shows an error level decreasing 
constantly from 1 % to 0.20 % and then becoming steady for

Figure 8. Current measurement error with CVMI Lindsey current sensors

The current measurement error is significantly higher 
comparing to the case 0 because of a pre-set fixed current 
calibration factor (adjustable factor unavailable) and an rms 
value calculation algorithm, based on integers instead of 
float values. Fortunately, most recent controls are provided 
with an adjustable calibration factor and unfortunately, it is 
the same for all three phases instead of one for each phase. 
The sensors are not identical and separate phase calibration 
factors would allow readings that are more accurate, either 
for current or for voltage. 
B. Voltage Measurement

C. Voltage and current 
The last test, performed on a reversible voltage regulator 
PTs and CT and its control, is not yet totally concluded. So 
far, only the metering and communicating potential of the 
control (CL-6A) was evaluated. The IED/control was 
configured to save average current and voltage rms-values 
over one minute period, which are usually required by a 
VVC application. The remote data transfer from three 
CL-6A controls through a SMP4 gateway and over a FO 
(Fiber Optic) link was successful but the reliability, when 
using the same gateway and a phone line, was questionable. 
D. Measurement error with the chain sensor-IED 
The voltage and current measurement accuracy of the 
chain sensor-IED is generally acceptable for statistical grid 
evaluation, despite the fact that this hardware combination 
introduces a reading error higher than 0.1 %, value defined 
by IEC 61000-4-30 for class A devices. However, the 
continuous evolution of sensor and IED technologies and a 
better sensor calibration are potential factors contributing to 
the improvement of the chain accuracy in the next future. 
VII. THE IED OF THE FUTURE 
Smart distribution applications, based on information 
from IEDs and smart sensors, improve the efficiency of 
distribution grid management. Power engineers learnt from 
experience that operating at the same time an increasing 
number of different IED models, integrated to the 
distribution grid, causes stress on network operating 
personnel for several reasons: 
 
Different 
control 
hardware, 
firmware 
and 
communication 
software 
when 
different 
manufacturers. 
 
Data format not always compatible with standard 
formats. 
 
IEDs with lack of interoperability or low degree of 
interoperability. 
 
Not “plug and play” design yet. 
To reduce cost and reach the “plug and play” design (see 
Figure 10), the development of distribution system 
technologies, including both aspects hardware and software, 
must be coordinated trough appropriate standards. 
To be proactive, IREQ and its Strategic Platform initiated 
the project DACCORD, which proposes a new strategy for 
conception, integration, deployment and utilization of a 
generic modular IED/control for smart distribution systems, 
complying with future standards, in three stages: 
1) 
New concept of IED/control. 
2) 
Strategy for device integration, deployment and 
operation compatible with the Smart Grid architecture (new 
feature: plug and play (P&P) (interoperability included)). 
3) 
New strategy of how to use IEDs/controls 
advanced complementary functions developed for SD 
applications. 
The first stage is focused on developing a generic 
specification for a modular distribution equipment control, 
which will cover three aspects: 
1) 
Hardware (modular): 
a) Main board with CPU, 
b) Front panel (including touch screen), 
c) Communication interface, 
d) Signal (voltage and current) interface, 
e) Electronic interface (required for voltage and 
current sensors), 
f) N/O and N/C contact blocs. 
2) 
Software: 
d) Firmware multi platform (CIM) including advanced 
functionalities such as: 
 
Main function (protection, voltage regulation, 
VAR control, feeder reconfiguration,…). 
 
Remote metering. 
 
Remote-predictive maintenance or JIT (Just In 
Time) for distribution equipment. 
 
PQ. 
 
Security. 
e) Communication software and protocols: 
 
IEC 61850 version for distribution feeders. 
 
IEC 61870…… 
 
DNP 3.0. 
3) 
Backup power supply. 
The data provided by such IEDs will fall into both real-
time and non real-time categories. In the real-time category, 
distributed sensing provides increased power grid monitoring

for grid state estimators, device status and health, fault 
detection and location, PQ, safety and security. Advanced 
functioning will include demand distribution for load 
balancing; transformer, circuit breaker and tap changer 
monitoring; detection of energized downed lines, high 
impedance faults and faults in underground cables. 
The bulk data download (waveforms) will be a feasible 
characteristic of the evolving telecommunication structure. 
The lifespan of the backup power supply battery will be 
increased to 7 to 10 years by using new long life battery 
technology, remote maintenance and reducing IED energy 
consumption with efficient IED management. 
 
 
Figure 10, HQ’s vision of distribution grid 2015 and beyond with 
integrated data architecture complaying with international standards 
 
By this project IREQ (Hydro-Québec) tries to: 
 
Initiate a debate, within Smart Distribution related 
national and international Working Groups (CEATI, 
IEEE, CIGRE/CIRED, ...). 
 
Influence those WGs to start working on definitions 
for modular hardware and software of standardized 
IEDs in order to make possible the edition of future 
related standards. 
 
Kick 
off 
collaborations 
with 
other 
utilities, 
manufacturers and organizations. 
 
Influence distribution equipment manufacturers to 
develop and build standardized models. 
VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
The IEDs with very high functionality will lead to 
significant cost savings and offer new problem solving 
capabilities. With these changes, utility personnel will need 
extensive training on the new practices, and a close 
partnership between vendors and utility customers will be 
necessary. 
Sensors and communication technology fields are 
evolving quickly. IED manufacturers are taking advantage of 
performance of new technologies, upgrading their devices to 
be compatible with smart sensors. The best example is the 
new generation of reclosers, with integral voltage and current 
sensors. 
Smart grid integrated monitoring devices rise the 
potential for implementing DA applications like VVC, FL, 
PQM and open the gate for new ones. Old and new 
applications will share the same resources. 
Due to extensive implementation of SCADA and AMI 
systems, the infrastructure required by DA applications 
mentioned above is often already in place. 
HQ’s projects resulted in the acquisition of knowledge 
about present distribution equipment performance and 
improvements needed in the future (technologies, sensors, 
IEDs, standards…) in order to integrate data acquisition. 
The accuracy of data acquisition process is an important 
factor, critically affecting the efficiency and reliability of DA 
systems and furthermore the efficiency and reliability of the 
power distribution system. 
The accuracy of the chain sensor-IED is generally 
acceptable. However, the controls under testing do not 
qualify for class A devices, as defined by IEC 61000-4-30.  
The frequency response of smart sensors doesn’t reach 
yet the level of accuracy that PQ experts would like. This 
feature should be improved in the next future to allow the 
implementation 
of 
smart 
applications 
based 
on 
discrimination of grid polluters. 
Using IEDs/controls for grid monitoring is an inspired 
decision based on following advantages [5]: 
 
Presence of AMI in Smart Grids. 
 
Connection of IEDs to the MV side of the grid. 
 
Continuous evolution of IEDs and sensors. 
There is a trend in controls evolution to follow up the 
path taken by intelligent meters a decade or more ago, and 
that is very encouraging.
