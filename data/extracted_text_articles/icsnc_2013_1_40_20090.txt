Abstract—The Sky Net project proposes a mobile base 
transceiver station (BTS) for mobile communication service 
from airborne. In the preliminary study, a Microwave Air-
Bridging (MAB) system is established on an Ultra-Light 
Aircraft (ULA) to offer relay mobile communication. In order 
to maintain sufficient Quality of Service (QoS) data-link, 
microwave system needs to establish critical Line-of-Sight (LoS) 
antenna alignment between airborne to ground to assure 
polarization matching. The proposed GPS-to-GPS tracking 
algorithm uses GPS and barometric data by considering earth 
curvature to estimate azimuth and elevation angles for the 
ground dual-axis tracking mechanism. With high accuracy 
demand in tracking, all sensor data are pre-calibrated by 
determining their covariance. An additional Data Variance 
Filter (DVF) is applied to eliminate the sudden data error and 
white noise from sensors to avoid mechanism vibration and 
maintain accurate tracking response to match with ULA flight 
path. The goal tries to reduce the Bit Error Rate (BER) of 
MAB 
to 
accomplish 
accurate 
antenna 
alignment 
for 
microwave transmission in Sky-Net application.

 INTRODUCTION 
Microwave Air Bridging (MAB) has been widely used in 
telecommunication relaying recently. Without hardware 
limitations, MAB can easily be implemented to establish 
communication links from remote areas. Antenna alignment 
in MAB is the fundamental issue to solve before minimum 
Quality-of-Service (QoS) can be made for communication 
link. Most remote Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) apply 
MAB 
application 
to 
connect 
wide 
spread 
mobile 
communication service network. 
In disaster situation, some mobile BTSs might be flooded 
or destroyed to disable from communication services. A draft 
idea of Sky Net was proposed to create a BTS carrying on a 
high altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for mobile 
communication services. After some preliminary surveys, 
the first proposal using repeater is abandoned. Since both 
donor and service antennas use the same frequency, it is not 
able to eliminate antenna isolation problem on a UAV. A 
second proposal arose to use microwave link from airborne 
to ground. 
The High Altitude Platform (HAP) or Remote Airborne 
Platform (RAP) for communication relay have been 
introduced and widely studied in the past few years. The 
concept of relaying the communication signal, basically, has 
two kinds of system architectures, such as Direct Relay (P2P) 
and Multi-Node Relay. In the Line-of-Sight (LOS) field, 
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can carry airborne 
transceiver or repeater to establish the P2P communication 
link between UAV and ground base [1] [2]. However, in 
general condition, the area needs telecommunication service, 
usually, has obstacle between the region and ground base. 
Using multi-UAV flying around the specific area to establish 
the communication link network is one of the ways to 
overcome this problem. Also, even the signal transmission 
range and the UAV collision problem can be well avoided [3] 
[4], the multi-UAV relay system still has some problem to 
overcome such as signal transmission latency after the multi-
node network and the uncertainty of wireless link quality due 
to each UAV’s actual flight path and real-time altitude.  
The airborne BTS concept was introduced and 
accomplished by Wypych et al. [5]; however, the service 
was limited by MS-to-MS communication in service area, 
which means the user cannot get contact with people far 
away still. In this paper, the goal is establishing a 
microwave link system between airborne BTS and ground 
BTS, which connect to the backbone network of the telecom 
company. 
With proper antenna alignment tracking, the exchange of 
telecommunication signal between terminals should meet 
the minimal acceptable BER in mobile BTS. In this phase of 
study, the airborne terminal is mounted on a ULA carrying 
the microwave bridge working at 5.8 GHz frequency band 
in Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) system with 
adaptive 
modulation. 
The 
proposed 
MAB 
system 
configuration is shown in Figure 1, as the preliminary idea. 
 
Figure 1. Microwave Air-Bridging system configuration for Sky-Net. 
 
In general, in wireless applications, like UAV 
surveillance with real-time image or video [6], the 
transceiver, usually, works simply in one way transmission.

However, the microwave bridge needs both terminals to 
maintain a good signal strength and steady data-link quality 
in order to achieve high bandwidth data transmission. Once 
the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) drops below 
the threshold of transceiver specification, the link is 
disconnected. Antenna tracking control may be deterministic 
if the main lobe on both side terminal antennas is aligned or 
not. In general, -3dB is set from the pick of antenna pattern 
to define the Vertical Beamwidth Angle (VBA) and 
Horizontal Beamwidth Angle (HBA). This shows critical 
constraint of the antenna’s directional characteristic. Usually, 
the threshold is carefully monitored such that the antenna can 
work normally. 
Antenna misalignment will cause high bit error rate and 
make microwave bridge crash. The keys to maintain well 
antenna alignment are twofold: antenna polarization keeps 
perfect matching and both VBA and HBA of two side 
terminal antennas maintain overlapping. The theoretical 
foundation of antenna characteristic is used to describe 
further automatic tracking system design for antennas. To 
accomplish the antenna alignment, the microcontroller 
tracking mechanism and control algorithm are designed 
using 
the 
Cortex-M3 
32-bit 
microcontroller 
and 
implemented on a dual axis mechanism for precision control.  
In this paper, the concept of the antenna tracking system 
is introduced in Section II, part A. The GPS-to-GPS tracking 
method and the whole hardware architecture are well 
describe and also the data filter that is designed according to 
data variance is explained in part B. Section III shows how 
the stepper motor control strategy works to eliminate the 
platform vibration which could lead to antenna misalignment. 
Dynamic tests of tracking algorithm for antenna alignment 
are presented for microwave air bridging verification by 
open field flight experiments in Section IV. 
II. 
TRACKING ALGORITHM 
A. GPS-to-GPS Tracking Method 
The existing microwave automatic antenna tracking 
device generally uses signal strength gradient to aiming at 
the target. The device will rotate azimuth angle to get the 
Received Signal Level (RSL) as high as possible and make 
signal gradient close to zero when it is aiming at the target. 
The elevation angle tracking works correspondingly. When 
the airborne terminal is relatively far away from the ground 
terminal, the signal will be diluted because of space 
propagation 
and 
signal 
multi-path 
effect 
to 
RSL 
simultaneously. The tracking performance worsens to result 
in lost alignment between the MAB terminals. Based on the 
Global Positioning System (GPS), a simple but effective 
method termed as GPS-to-GPS (G2G) tracking algorithm is 
proposed. The proposed G2G method receives GPS position 
information from two sites, i.e., airborne and ground, and 
transforms them into a specific coordinate system for 
alignment. For GPS information, both airborne and ground 
terminals will receive their latitude, longitude and altitude in 
Mean Sea Level (MSL), continually. The algorithm in the 
control core will compare their differences on each side and 
calculate the appropriate geometric azimuth and elevation 
angels between the airborne terminal and the ground 
terminal.  
 
Figure 2. Backbone antenna tracking control system. 
 
The backbone of antenna tracking control is shown in 
Figure 2. A dual-core mother board is fabricated to control 
the 2-axis rotation platform. The vehicle information of the 
airborne terminal is transmitted via microwave data link and 
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) into MCU. 
A 900MHz wireless module is used as redundant link to 
ensure the integrity and reliability of the tracking control. All 
the data and command are transmitted by Direct Memory 
Access (DMA) to reduce CPU burden. 
Coordinate transform plays a key part in the tracking 
control. The first step calculates and transforms the 
Longitude-Latitude-Altitude (LLA) information into an 
appropriate coordinate system to offer user with distance of 
East-to-West and North-to-South direction. The coordinate 
transform of LLA in WGS84 [7] into TM2 in TWD97 [8] 
can be rewritten by latitude and longitude in degree into 
East-North direction distance in meters. For the azimuth 
angle, as long as North and East direction can be obtained, 
the arctangent calculation can be applied to get a correct 
value. But for elevation angle, the situation is quite different. 
On the microwave transmission, the most concern on the 
VBA of both sides lies on their well overlap or not. 
Therefore, the elevation angle accuracy of mechanism unit 
becomes much important and sensitive than the azimuth 
angle. Figure 3 shows the difference between the 
calculations of two methods. The first method simply 
assumes the Cartesian coordinate system to ground terminal 
as the origin. The second method considers the Earth 
curvature error into calculation. 
 
Figure 3. Calculation of elevation angle considering Earth curvature. 
 
In Figure 3, if the airborne terminal and ground terminal 
are close enough, then the calculation can be simplified into 
a 3-axis Cartesian coordinate plane. As the coordinate being 
transformed into TM2 in TWD97 system, the distance S1 
between ground and airborne terminal can be obtained.

Meanwhile, using MSL for altitudes on both terminals as h1 
and h2, the elevation angle α from the ground terminal can be 
expressed as:

However, as S1 is far from both terminals, the curvature 
of earth will evidently affect the accuracy of elevation angle 
α. Figure 3 also shows how the curvature makes the error 
bigger as S1 increasing. In TWD97 datum, the Earth model 
is an ellipsoid and the Earth radius scale is relatively huge 
comparing to ULA flight path. Within a small region, the 
Earth is reasonably assumed as a sphere not an ellipsoid. 
Therefore in figure 3, between the ground and the airborne 
terminals, the Earth radius is R and the incline angle 
between them toward Earth center is  . The elevation angle 
α of the ground terminal can be recalculated as:

B. Data Variance Filter 
All the data from sensors should be filtered to eliminate 
noise or interference to cause unpredictable data error. 
Generally, 
software 
for 
Low-Pass 
Filter 
(LPF) 
or 
Complementary Filter [9, 10, 11, 12] can easily be adopted 
to compensate the unreasonable error or eliminate the sensor 
white noise. However, the time constant value or weight of 
the applied filter considerably affects the system response. In 
this paper, the Data Variance Filter (DVF) is adopted to add 
the variance of each sensor into the filter to generate the 
variable weight for LPF and avoid the internal data 
disturbance effect on the control output. The covariance 
values of GPS and barometric altitudes are also included to 
determine the time constant in complementary filter to get 
better altitude resolution. 
DVF uses a simple equation to get the processed data at 
time yt with data from t-1 and the data x acquired at time t. 
The weight is calculated by function Varf (α, β) and variance 
gain kv.

The pre-calibrated step of DVF is getting the individual 
variance σ of sensors. Assuming that data have a Gaussian 
distribution, the sensor is implemented steady. The three

Equations (6) and (7) are determining data probability of 
each time data update. For Gaussian distribution, 99.73% of 
data will fall into the region of 3σ. Since the data sampling 
rate is 50 Hz in the proposed system, it is assumed that 
barometric and GPS data between two sampling times will 
not changing drastically. In order to reduce the calculation 
load on microcontroller, the 3σ data difference is set as the 
threshold to generate appropriate Varf(α, β) value from the 
following equation.

The important part of using DVF falls into how to get the 
correct variance for each sensor. As the sampling frequency 
is relatively higher than system characteristic, the static data 
can be used to get the variance to fit for the real condition. 
Figure 4 shows how the variance affects the result of DVF.  
`
 
Figure 4. DVF for altimeter with different variance versus time. 
 
For the blue line data, the variance is relatively small and 
therefore the DVF cannot eliminate the small noise and 
easily cause data overshoot. For bigger variance, such as red 
line data, the response will be too slow to reach the actual 
condition. 
III. 
STEPPER MOTOR TRACKING CONTROL 
The ground tracking system is a two-axis rotating 
mechanism, where the 23 dBi directional antenna is mounted 
with good alignment to mechanism axis, as shown in Figure 
5. Limited by the GPS data update rate, the tracking 
algorithm has to be capable for estimating the position at the 
airborne terminal using the moving rate to achieve adjustable 
control frequency. The microcontroller outputs a digital 
signal, which is rapid enough to drive rotors to rotate to the 
desired angle displacement.

However, as the rotor might be in rest state, the starting 
inertia of each axis will make the mechanism in sudden 
shock and cause damage to the mechanism. Besides, as the 
gear backlash increases, the tracking effect will make 
observable error in the perfect alignment. G. Hilton et al. [13] 
did the comparison about the terminal’s Receiving Sgnal 
Strength (RSS) change due to different tilt and rotation angle 
of antenna. The result indicate that as the terminal’s antenna 
polirization is match to transmitter side, terminal can get the 
maximum RSS. Therefore, the control strategy of two-axis 
platform become the main issue to avoid the antenna 
misaligment, which cause high BER in microwave link 
[14,15]. In order to control the platform smoothly, an 
appropriate signal output frequency has to be carefully 
designed. In this paper, a control loop to allow adjustable 
signal output interval and the unit rotation step for rotors are 
designed into the tracking control system for MAB. 
 
Figure 6. Control sequence. 
 
Figure 6 represents the control sequence, where Tc is the 
control loop interval and Ts is the control signal output 
period. For each time after calculation, 2-axis mechanism has 
the target rotation displacement θd, so the adjusted unit step 
θc can be represented as: 
 
S
C
d
c
T )T
  (
 
 
        (11) 
With appropriate calculation for each time control core to 
drive the platform, the adjustable unit step can make each 
control loop well engaged with less mechanical shaking by 
decreasing the times of acceleration and deceleration. 
However, the adjustable unit step control can smooth the 
mechanism rotation only. When the airborne terminal has the 
fast movement in azimuth angle, the rate controller inside 
control core should be added to avoid the large phase delay 
of tracking result. The control function can be accomplished 
by changing the control interval Tc. It should be the function 
of moving rate, distance and the heading of the airborne 
terminal. The proposed concept of adaptive control interval 
is based on that the airborne terminal is moving on ULA or 
UAV. Its heading information can be used to determine the 
direction, like North or East, to change faster in the next 
instants. For example, in azimuth angle tracking, if the 
heading in T0 is ψ1, then, the velocity of the airborne terminal 
is V1, the mechanism tracking angle is θT. By trigonometric 
function, the velocity vector of the radial and tangent 
direction of the airborne terminal with respect to the ground 
terminal can be estimated as:

Therefore, from (12) and (13), the tracking unit rotation 
speed in azimuth angle has positive relation with the tangent 
speed of the airborne terminal. Meanwhile, as its speed 
increases, the control interval should be decrease to avoid 
tracking delay. The relation of Tc and tuning gain Ka can be 
represented as below:

Tc0 is the default control interval and the optimized motor 
controller will be the combination of adjustable unit step and 
rate controller. 
In the motor controller tests, the angle displacements are 
setting at 50.72˚, 15.84˚, and 0.86˚, separately. The figures 
show the difference of using motor controller or not. The 
MCU sends 1000Hz control signal to drive the motor 
directly at unit step equal to 0.02˚. Without motor controller, 
the vibration is large as Figure 7(a). While with motor 
controller, the vibration appears much reduced in Figure 7(b). 
In Figure 7(b), when the controller changes the motor’s 
speed, the response drops abruptly, and returns to 
convergence shortly. Their scales refer to per unit of 
response. Likewise, Figuress 8 and 9 shows the control 
results by different angle displacements with changing speed.

Comparing these three results, as the tracking system 
without motor controller, the mechanism shaking occurs 
continuously while the motor is rotating. The time constant 
of the whole rotation is longer than that with motor controller, 
especially when the rotation displacement is large.

reduce the redundant loading of stepper motor.

altitude to track the ground terminal. To verify that the 
tracking system is capable to maintain constant microwave 
link, the fight paths and distances are predetermined to check

It can be noticed that for longer distance between the 
airborne terminal and the ground terminal, the overall 
tracking performance appears better than the closer tests. As 
the controller core has optimized control algorithm, not only 
the data rate becomes relatively steady but also the signal 
strength ratio gets much improved. It is evident that the 
tracking result is more accurate. The signal strength ratios 
from both terminals present that the vertical and horizontal 
polarization antennas are aiming correctly to each other.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a precision antenna alignment tracking 
system was designed and implemented to Sky Net Project. 
By considering Earth curvature, a corrective target tracking 
algorithm is formulated for the vertical and horizontal 
polarization antennas. Flight tests are carried with a 
prescheduled flight path to establish microwave link from 
the airborne terminal to the ground terminal. With optimized 
dual-axis motor controller, the tracking antenna alignment is 
proven with feasible results. The alignment problem for 
microwave transmission can be overcome by the proposed 
two-axis tracking unit with DVF to filter out the sensor’s 
white noise and unpredicted data error. The test result shows 
that the tracking unit and antenna implementation can be 
used to provide the microwave application. It is found of 
high possibility to establish microwave air-bridging from 
airborne for mobile communication relaying.
