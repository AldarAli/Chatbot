Abstract— In this paper, we address the problem of Direction of 
Departure (DOD) and Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for 
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radar. The presented work 
studies the effect of Radar Cross Section (RCS), Signal to Noise Ratio 
(SNR) and speed of targets on the performance of the MIMO radar 
with widely and closely separated antennas.  Since the information 
on the targets is obtained from the echoes of the transmitted signals, 
it is straightforward that RCS and speed of targets play an important 
role in system accuracy.  Analysis can be used to find the direction 
of multiple types of targets such as Capon, Multiple Signal 
Classification (MUSIC) and parallel factor (PARAFAC). To 
differentiate the meaning of targets, varying targets of different 
types, such as bicycle, bird, man, ship and jet have been considered. 
After defining suitable values for each type of target in 2D space, the 
performance of each type is discussed by using the MATLAB 
program. Finally, we present an experimental platform of MIMO 
radar with Bistatic antennas which has been developed in order to 
evaluate the performance of the above techniques under more 
realistic conditions.    
 
Keywords- MIMO Radar; Target Localization; Parallel   Factor 
(PARAFC); Direction of Arrival; Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).

INTRODUCTION 
     Radar is an electronic device for detection and localization of 
the target. It works by transmitting a special type of waveform, 
and detects the echo signal. Radar can be designed to see through 
conditions impervious to normal human vision, such as darkness, 
haze, fog, rain, snow. In addition, radar has the advantage of being 
able to measure target parameters like range and velocity.     
     Radar is used for a large range of civilian, military and 
scientiﬁc applications like air surveillance, surface search, 
tracking and guidance, weather radar, Earth observation. 
     In [1], the author selected a number of different moving 
targets: simple and complex targets with different RCS and 
speeds. From the existing work on the application of Capon, 
MUSIC and PARAFAC to the localization of different targets, he 
noticed the importance of the types of targets and the effect of 
changing the speed of targets.  
      This paper focuses on comparing the performance criterion 
for different types of targets as well as the impact of the number 
of antennas on the performance of three different techniques 
mentioned above. 
     The radar system can be classified into monostatic and bistatic. 
The transmitter and receiver of the monostatic radar are located 
in the same location, while the transmitter and receiver of the 
biostatic radar are far apart relative to the wavelength used in the 
radar. According to the characteristics of the transmitted signals 
the radar system can be further classified into continuous wave 
for radar and pulse radar. The continuous waveform radar 
transmits a single continuous waveform while the pulse radar 
transmits multiple short pulses.  Most of the modern radars are 
monostatic pulse radars [2]. Recently, a new field of radar 
research called Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radar has 
been developed, which can be thought as a generalization of the 
multi-static radar concept. MIMO radar has multiple transmit and 
multiple receive antennas as its name indicates [3]. 
     In  [4], the transmit and receive antennas may be in the form 
of an array and the transmit and receive arrays can be co-located 
or widely separated like phased array systems. Although some 
types of MIMO radar systems look likes phased array systems, 
there is a fundamental difference between MIMO radar and 
phased array radar. The difference is that MIMO radar always 
transmits multiple probing signals, via its transmit antennas, that 
may be correlated or uncorrelated with each other, whereas 
phased array radars transmit scaled versions of a single waveform 
which are fully correlated. The multiple transmit and receive 
antennas of a MIMO radar system may also be widely separated 
as radar networks. The fundamental difference between a multi-
static radar network and MIMO radar is that independent radars 
that form the network perform a significant amount of local 
processing and there exists a central processing unit that fuses the 
outcomes of central processing in a reasonable way. For example, 
every radar makes detection decisions locally then the central 
processing unit fuses the local detection decisions. Whereas 
MIMO radar uses all of the available data and jointly processes 
signals received at multiple receivers to make a single decision 
about the existence of the target. The key ideas of MIMO radar 
concept has been picked up from MIMO communications. MIMO 
is a technique used in communications to increase data throughput 
and link range without additional bandwidth or transmit power. 
This is achieved by higher spectral efficiency and link reliability 
or diversity. Using MIMO systems in communications made 
significant improvements when there is serious fading in the 
communication channel. Radar systems also suffer from fading 
when there are complex and extended targets. Researchers took 
the idea of using multiple transmit and receive antennas to reduce 
the effects of fading from communications and applied it in the 
field of radar to achieve performance enhancements. Some of the 
most important radar applications are the detection performance

and high resolution of the moving target localization. Radar Cross 
Section (RCS), range, location and velocity are utility parameters 
of the moving target [5][6]. In [7] and [8], to improve the accuracy 
of target detection and estimation, antenna arrays have been used. 
MIMO radar uses multiple transmitter and multiple receiver 
elements. Generally, unlike the phased-array systems, MIMO 
radar has several advantages compared to the conventional 
phased array systems: higher resolution, more degrees of 
freedom, improved parameter specification, better spatial 
coverage and detection diversity gain. MIMO radars can be 
classified into two categories: (1) MIMO radar with widely 
separated antennas scheme and (2) MIMO radar using collocated 
antennas, which is similar to phase array radar. In the literature, 
there are many configurations of MIMO radar according to the 
location of the transmitting and receiving elements. Widely 
separated antennas represent one of these configurations. In this 
scheme, the separation between transmitter and receiver should 
be large enough to receive the uncorrelated echoes from the 
different targets. The main advantage of this scheme is that the 
spatial diversity of the targets RCS enhances the radar 
performance. 
      In [9], a bistatic MIMO radar technique with transmission 
spatial diversity is proposed, and the estimation performance is 
analyzed. Moreover, the angles with respect to receiver can be 
determined using the proposed technique. In addition, the 
maximum number of targets that can be identified with this 
technique is discussed in this paper. In [10], MIMO radar can deal 
with multiple targets. Linearly independent waveforms are 
transmitted at the same time via multiple antennas. These 
independent waveforms are linearly combined at the targets with 
different phases, after which the signal waveforms reflected from 
different targets are linearly independent of each other, which 
allow for the application of Capon, MUSIC and PARAFAC 
algorithms. 
      In this work, we focus on the application of MIMO radar to 
the estimation of DOA and the DOD of multiple targets exist in 
the same range bin for bistatic MIMO radar system. We are 
particularly interested to optimize the average angular error for 
different types of targets. 
     The paper is organized as follows: in Section II, the previous 
work on the subject is summarized. The MIMO radar signal 
model is presented in Sections III and IV. The performance of 
MIMO radar is evaluated through simulations via MATLAB in 
Section V. Some concluding remarks are given in Section IV. 
 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
    In [11], the author reviews some recent work on MIMO radar 
with widely separated antennas, widely separated transmit/ 
receive antennas capture the spatial diversity of the target's radar 
cross section (RCS). Unique features of MIMO radar are 
explained and illustrated by examples. It is shown that with no 
coherent processing, a target's RCS spatial variations can be 
exploited to obtain a diversity gain for target detection and for 
estimation of various parameters, such as angle of arrival and 
Doppler. For target location, it is shown that coherent processing 
can provide a resolution for exceeding that supported by the 
radar's waveform. 
      In [12], the authors discussed the velocity estimation 
performance for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar 
with widely spaced antennas. He derived the Cramer-Rao bound 
(CRB) for velocity estimation and he discussed the optimized 
configuration design based on CRB. General results were 
presented for an extended target with reflectively varying with 
look angle. Also, the analysis was provided for a simplified case, 
assuming an isotopic scattered. For given transmitted signals, 
optimal antenna placement was analyzed in the sense of 
minimizing the CRB of the velocity estimation error.  The authors 
shown that when all antennas are located at approximately the 
same distance from the target, symmetrical placement is optimal 
and relative position of transmitters and receivers can be arbitrary 
under the orthogonal received signal assumption.  
     In [13], the authors presented compressive sensing in the 
spatial domain to achieve target localization, specifically 
direction of arrival (DOA), using multiple input multiple- output 
(MIMO) radar. A sparse localization framework was proposed for 
MIMO array in which transmit and receive elements are placed at 
random. This allows for dramatic reduction in the number of 
elements needed, while still attaining performance comparable to 
that of a filled (Nyquist) array. The authors developed a bound on 
the coherence of the resulting measurement matrix, and obtained 
conditions under which the measurement matrix satisfies the so- 
called isotropy property. The coherence and isotropy concepts are 
used to establish uniform and non-uniform recovery guarantees 
within the proposed spatial compressive sensing framework. In 
the proposed framework, 
compressive sensing recovery 
algorithms are capable of better performance than classical 
methods, such as beamforming and MUSIC. 
     There are many existing methods to localize the moving target. 
The Angle of Arrival (AOA), the Angle of Departure (AOD), the 
speed of the target, and the RCS are the most used parameters to 
localize a moving target.  In [10], the author proposed a Capon 
technique. In [14], the author proposed a MUSIC (Multiple Signal 
Classification) technique.  In [15], the author proposed parallel 
factor analysis (PARFAC). 
      In this paper, we compare between three well-known 
techniques (Capon, MUSIC and PARFAC) by selecting a number 
of different moving targets: simple and complex targets with 
different RCS and speeds. Moreover, two cases of localizations 
are taken: widely and closely separated MIMO radar antennas. 
The performance of the three different techniques were noticed 
and the impact of the number of antennas are discussed.

Moreover, let L be the number of static interferers located at the

     This subsection analyzes the impact of the number of targets 
on the performance detection. The performance criterion is the 
absolute value of the difference between the true angle and 
estimated angle, averaged over transmit and receive angles and 
over all targets.  
     In a first experiment (Fig. 4), we consider seven types of 
targets. The variance and speed of each target was given in Table 
I. We simulate the presence of two to six targets,  starting from K 
= 2 with  DODs = [10°, 20°] and   DOAs = [0°, 30°]  until K = 6, 
DODs 
= 
[10°, 20°, 30°, 40° , 50°, 60°] 
and 
DOAs 
= 
[0°, 30°, 5° , 15°, 25°, 30°]. The number of pulses is Q = 100, 
number of samples for each transmitted pulses is L = 512, SNR 
=10 dB, and Swerlling II model is chosen. We plotted the 
performance of the Capon method, and we compared the 
performance of the different types of targets via Monte Carlo 
simulation. 
      From Fig. 4, it is clear that a better angular resolution is 
achieved when the target is "Man" and the worst angular 
resolution is achieved when the target is "Car". From Fig. 4, we 
observe that the global performance of all types of targets 
seriously degrade when the number of targets is increased. 
 
       In Fig. 5, we simulate the presence of two to six targets. The 
other parameters are the same as in Fig. 4, but, in this case we 
have plotted the performance of the MUSIC technique. We 
compare the performance of the different types of targets via 
Monte Carlo simulation. From Fig. 5, it is clear that a better 
angular resolution is achieved when the target is "Boat" and the 
worst angular resolution is achieved when the target is "Fighter".  
From Fig. 5, we observe that the global performance of all types 
of targets seriously degrades when the number of targets is 
increased. In Fig. 6, we simulate the presence of two to six targets. 
The other parameters are the same as in Fig.  4, but, in this case, 
we have plotted the performance of the parallel factor (PARAFC) 
technique, and we compared the performance of the different 
types of targets via Monte Carlo simulation.  
     From Fig. 6, it is clear that the best angular resolution is 
achieved when the target is "Car" and the worst angular resolution 
is achieved when the target is "Jet". From Fig. 6, we observe that 
the global performance of all types of targets seriously degrades 
when the number of targets is increased.

resolution is achieved when the target is "Bicycle". As expected, 
from Fig. 7, we observe that the performance of all types of targets 
improves when the signal to noise ratio increases.  In Fig. 8, we 
simulate the presence of three targets. The other parameters are 
the same as in Fig. 4, but, in this case, we have plotted the 
performance of the MUSIC technique, and we compared the 
performance of the different types of targets via Monte Carlo 
simulation. From Fig.  8, it is clear that a better angular resolution 
is achieved when the target is "Bird" and the worst angular 
resolution is achieved when the target is "Bicycle".

     In Fig. 9, we simulate the presence of three targets. The other 
parameters are the same as in Fig. 7, but, in this case, we have 
plotted the performance of the parallel factor (PARAFAC) 
technique and we compared the performance of the different types 
of targets via Monte Carlo simulation. From Fig. 9, it is clear that 
the best angular resolution is achieved when the target    
is "Bird" and the worst angular resolution is achieved when the 
target is "Jet".

(−75, 65 ), man = (−40, 50), fighter = (−35, 45), boat = 
(0, −10),  jumbo jet = (5, −15),  bird = (15, −5).  The other 
parameters are: the speeds and RCS for each target as shown in 
Table I, the number of pulses Q = 100, the number of samples for 
each transmitted pulse L = 512, the number of transmit and 
receive sub arrays is fixed to 8, SNR = 0 dB, and the Swerlling II 
model is chosen. In Figs. 11-13, we compare the performance of 
different localization techniques via Monte Carlo simulations.

Figure 10. True angles for the targets 
 
    In Figs. 11- 13, we have plotted the 2-way Capon, 2-way music 
and PARFAC.  For the comparison between all methods to be fair, 
the angular resolution of the two latter techniques is fixed to 
0.0001 degree. 
    Case 2.  performance of the seven target for closed spaced, 
SNR = 30 dB 
     In Fig. 11, we can see from seven targets, 2-way Capon 
technique can detect 3 targets which are: car, boat and bird 
respectively, the average angular error is 57.1 degree.  
From Fig. 12, we can also see that the 2-way music technique can 
detect 3 targets from seven which are: car, man and bird 
respectively, the average angular error is 57.2 degree.

using 2-way Capon technique (SNR = 0 dB). 
 
     In Fig. 12, we can see that the PARAFC technique can detect 
6 targets from seven which are all the targets except car target, the 
average angular error is 5. 6 degrees.  From these results we can 
conclude that none of the above techniques can be detected all the 
targets, because   we need to change some parameters, i.e., the 
angles of arrival and departure (widely spaced or closely spaced), 
the other parameter is signal to noise ratio. The other conclusion 
is the superiority of PARFAC among the other techniques.   
 
     We plot the true angles for the seven targets for closely spaced   
(𝜃, 𝜑) Car = (−80, 70), bicycle = (−75, 65 ), man = (−40, 50), 
fighter = (−35, 45), boat = (0, −10), jumbo jet = (5, −15), bird 
= (15, −5).  The other parameters are: the speeds and RCS for 
each target as shown in table 1. The number of pulses Q = 100, 
the number of samples for each transmitted pulse L = 512, the 
number of transmit and receive sub arrays is fixed to 8, SNR = 30 
dB, and the Swerlling II model is chosen. 
From the comparison between Figs. 14 and 16, it is clear that a 
better detection and angular resolution (regardless of the 
technique used) is achieved when the signal to noise ratio 
increases from 0 to 30 dB. For instance, six targets were detected 
in 2-way Capon technique (car, man, jumbo jet, bird, fighter and 
boat), five targets were detected in 2-way music technique (car, 
man, boat, bird and jumbo jet), and all targets were detected in 
PARAFAC technique.

comparison between Figs. 17 and 18, it is clear that a better 
angular resolution is achieved when the targets are widely spaced.

well localized.

improves when the number of transmit and receive antennas 
increases from 4 to 10, the three closely spaced targets now 
become distinguishable.

VI.   CONCLUSION  
     In this paper, we have considered the detection and 
localization of moving target in bistatic MIMO radar with widely 
separated antennas, where multiple antennas transmit linearly 
independent waveforms and multiple antenna receive the 
reflected signal. We can significantly improve the estimation 
accuracy of the bistatic MIMO radar techniques as well as 
enhance their performance. The main problems encountered in 
MIMO radar detection are radar cross section and speed of the 
target. To illustrate the impact of these two parameters on the 
performance of MIMO radar, several types of targets and three 
popular techniques (Capon, MUSIC and PARAFC) were

considered for comparison. From the simulation results, we have 
shown that irrespective of the radar cross section and speed of 
target a high performance (low angular error) can be obtained 
when the signal to noise ratio increases. On the contrary, low 
performance can be obtained when the number of targets 
increases.
