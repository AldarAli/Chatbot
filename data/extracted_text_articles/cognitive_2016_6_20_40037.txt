Abstract—This study shows how intelligence of an individual 
can be determined in different intelligence domains using brain 
and bio-signals. Results of pupil dilation, eye-blink and EEG 
(Electroencephalogram) signals were analyzed. It was found 
that high intelligent individuals (HI) could easily modulate 
their resource allocation and information processing strategy 
than low intelligent individuals (LI) depending on task demand.  
Keywords-multiple intelligence; pupil dilation; eye blink; 
EEG; coherence analysis.

 INTRODUCTION  
Intelligence is one of the characteristics that define 
human beings. However, in practice, the level of intelligence 
varies from individual to individual. At one level it varies in 
degree and at another it varies in kind. In contrast to the 
traditional view that intelligence of an individual can be 
measured with a single score, researchers have argued that 
individuals are intelligent in their own different ways. For 
instance, some are good in logic while some are good in 
language. This idea is strongly supported by the theory of 
Multiple Intelligence (MI) proposed by Howard Gardner [1]. 
Gardner chose eight following domains of intelligence - 
musical-rhythmic, visual-spatial, verbal-linguistic, logical-
mathematical, bodily kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal 
and naturalistic.  
While the nature of intelligence is debated, the method to 
measure them individually or together has also turned out to 
be a big area of research in educational psychology. Several 
methods such as questionnaires and personal interviews have 
been proposed. Questionnaires are cheap but do not give an 
estimate of subjective potential of an individual. Personal 
interviews do provide a subjective insight into the potential 
of an individual but they are time consuming and expensive. 
Therefore, there is a great need to explore alternative 
methods to assess the potential of an individual in different 
intelligences that are cheap, readily available and subjective. 
We conducted our experimental studies to asses the 
intelligence of an individual based on their brain and bio-
signals such as pupil dilation, eye blink, Galvanic Skin 
Response (GSR), heart-beat and body temperature. In this 
paper, we focus on brain and eye-movement analysis.  
        Previous 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
bio-signals, 
particularly, pupil dilation and eye blinks provide 
complimentary indices of information processing [2]. In 
general, pupil dilates when the processing demand is higher. 
Pupil 
dilation 
also 
indicates 
sustained 
information 
processing [3][4]. Similarly, eye blinks also indicate 
cognitive processing [5]. Some independent studies on eye 
blink have shown that eye-blink bursts follow high 
cognitive load or information processing [6][7]. This 
suggests that eye blinks reflect the release of resources used 
in stimulus related cognition [8]. While bio-signals reflect 
the cognitive processing and resource allocation, brain 
signal analysis using EEG such as power analysis and 
coherence also indicate mental activity [9][10].  
      The present paper is structured as follows: In Section II 
we focus on the experiment design and in Section III we 
discuss the results. In Section IV we present the conclusions. 
II. 
PRESENT STUDY 
We report our experiment to determine the intelligence of 
an individual in fundamentally two different domains namely 
language and visuo-spatial. In the experiment, 40 high school 
students (divided into high and low intelligent individuals 
based on a pre-test) solved 20 questions that were divided 
into tough and easy (10 from each domain).  While 
participants solved the questions, their pupil dilation was 
measured using tobii eye tracker and eye blink was measured 
using a web-camera. Their brain signals were acquired using 
bio-semi EEG device with 32 channels. To better understand 
the processing mechanism of participants, the trials were 
divided into three conditions: pre-stimulus, during-stimulus 
and post-stimulus. Change in pupil dilation, eye movement 
and brain signals during problem solving were contrasted 
with rest state. 
III. 
RESULTS  
        Results of pupil dilation (Table 1) show that high 
intelligent individuals have greater change in pupil dilation 
for tougher questions and in tasks that require creativity and 
imagination (i.e., visuo-spatial tasks), and lesser change in 
pupil dilation for easier questions and in tasks that require 
algorithmic approach (i.e., language). Low intelligent 
individuals have significant increase in all conditions, which 
indicates 
higher 
processing 
load. 
High 
intelligent 
individuals showed higher eye-blink rate for tough and 
creative tasks than low intelligence individuals.  
        Similarly, results of EEG coherence (Figure 1) showed 
higher coherence between pairs of electrodes in frontal lobe 
in theta and alpha band (but not in other bands) for higher 
intelligent individuals for language tasks. For visuo- spatial 
tasks, high intelligent individuals showed wide spread 
coherence indicating a networking of various brain regions.

IV. 
CONCLUSION  
     Overall, our results present following important findings: 
First, high intelligent individuals modulate their brain 
resource allocation patterns according to demand of the task. 
In contrast, low intelligent individuals allocate more 
resources for all kinds of tasks. Second, high intelligent 
individuals allocate restricted brain areas for tasks that 
require fewer resources but different brain regions for tasks 
that require additional resources. Overall, these findings 
showed that individuals with different potentials have 
different ways of processing information. Moreover, bio and 
 
 
brain signals can be reliably used to assess the intelligence. 
In future we will explore other domains of intelligence.
