IV. SIMULATIONS
In this section, the performance improvement by coopera-
tive communication is veriﬁed through computer simulations
using algorithms in the previous section. The default sim-
ulation conditions are summed up in Table I. In [6], UT
position is restricted to the cell edge, but it is removed here
since the CoMP under disaster recovery is required to work
for the user anywhere in the cell. To avoid the complexity
of resource allocation, here we assume that BSs have the
enough power to allow

has less steep gradient than that of others, which means the
variance of the capacity becomes larger. This fact means
that the quality is less stable, but the average capacity of
Method 3 is more than 2.5 times of others, and it is much
advantageous also in the point of outage capacity. Likewise,
distribution functions of capacity in case of pattern B are
given in Figure 2 (e) and (f). In subplot (e), characteristics
of Cell 2 with working BS has a different behavior from (a)
and (c) (curves of Cell 0 are similar to (a) and (c)): Cell 2 is
located in the edge of the seven cells, and the inﬂuence of
interferences is small, hence improvement by Method 2 is
not anticipated. In Cell 1 with broken BS, the overall trend is
not so much different from (c) and (d) except that the curve
of Method 3 in (f) shifts to the right. This upgrade happens
because in Pattern B, Cell 1 is surrounded by working cells
which become the origin of source signal (in Pattern A,
this is not consists), hence the cooperative transmission can
invoke its advantage more effectively.
