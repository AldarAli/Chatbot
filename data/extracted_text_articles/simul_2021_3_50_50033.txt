Abstract— Recycling is one of the most significant issues in the 
waste management system. As the use and demand for plastics 
increase every year, finding efficient and environment-friendly 
solutions to handle the plastics in the plastic waste management 
system 
gets 
more 
challenging. 
There 
are 
economic, 
environmental, and educational factors affecting plastic waste 
management. This paper investigates the effects of educational 
campaigns and system-wide improvement. For this, we used an 
Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation approach in the NetLogo 
environment. We provided various scenarios in the current 
plastics waste life cycle using a real dataset to validate our 
model, which was from the American Chemistry Council and 
the National Association for PET Container Resources from 
2018. We found that education, technology, and infrastructure 
changes should be considered holistically to overcome this 
problem at a system level.

 INTRODUCTION  
The demand for plastics increases every year, and over 
300 million tons of plastics were produced in 2018. All of 
these plastics meet one of three fates within the plastic waste 
system: (1) recycling and reproduction, (2) thermal 
destruction (combustion with energy recovery), and (3) 
landfill deposition. Recent estimates of the fates of all plastics 
ever made indicate that only 9% was recycled, 12% was 
incinerated, and 79% was deposited in landfills or discarded 
in natural environments, such as the oceans [1][2].  
The plastics recycling process faces three significant 
challenges. First, dealing with plastic waste is hugely 
expensive. Simply removing plastic litter from the United 
States’ west coast costs taxpayers $520 million each year [3]. 
Effective regeneration techniques are still lacking in current 
plastic management systems. While the plastics generation 
increases every year, it leads to an imbalance between input 
and output. Secondly, combustion and discarding have severe 
negative impacts on the environment. The degrading process 
is slow, and toxic greenhouse gases are produced. Plastics 
waste breaking into smaller pieces, known as microplastics, 
can adhere to waterborne organic pollutants and infiltrate food 
webs [4]. Thirdly, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the 
consumption and demand for plastics have increased sharply 
[5]. One hundred twenty-nine billion face masks and 65 
billion gloves are used with a monthly estimate [6]. The 
increasing demand and use of plastics cause significant 
problems in the plastic waste management system [2]. Many 
recycling facilities’ safety-related suspensions further 
exacerbate this trend. Without proper public waste 
management, there is a risk of widespread environmental 
contamination [6].  
The current plastic waste management system needs better 
approaches to deal with these large numbers of post-consumer 
plastics. However, it remains unclear what interventions will 
best support plastic waste management. This paper presents 
an agent-based model that simulates the plastics waste 
management lifecycle at multiple scales. Agent-based 
modeling is a simulation technique that can be used to analyze 
complex social systems. It is a computational approach that 
agents with specific variables, behaviors, and characteristics 
interact with each other [7]. This modeling and simulation 
provide a direct and visual approach to modeling different 
scenarios in the current plastics waste lifecycle. Our research 
question for this study is the following:  
 
R.Q.: How do strategies, such as an education campaign 
and a system-wide improvement, influence the behavior of 
plastics waste management? 
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews 
related background in plastics waste management. Section 3 
outlines the research methodology. The research results and 
recommendations are shown in section 4, followed by a 
conclusion in Section 5.

BACKGROUND 
In this section, we will review tthe plastics waste 
management framework, the classification of recyclable 
plastics and non-recyclable plastics, and the introduction of 
Agent-Based Modeling.  
A. Plastics Waste Management Framework 
Plastics’ low cost, lightweight, and versatility have a vast 
area of use in industries. Furthermore, plastic materials 
usually have ecological and economic advantages over 
conventional materials throughout their life cycle, with or 
without considering the End-of-Life stage [8]. Unfortunately, 
more than half of all plastics end up in landfills, and only 9% 
of used plastic can be recycled [9]. Additionally, a given 
plastic piece can only be recycled 2 to 3 times on average [10]. 
Despite its limitations, recycling remains the best solution for 
processing plastic waste due to its beneficial economic and 
environmental impacts. The requirements for successful 
plastic recycling include proper infrastructure to collect the 
waste, available technology to reprocess the waste into 
secondary products economically, and develop markets for 
the cost-effective use of recycled products [11]. 
B. Recyclable Plastics and non-recyclable plastics 
Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into 
new materials. However, research shows that impurities take 
up to 28% of plastic waste and that around 75% of plastics 
waste is considered as Low-Quality applications [12]. The 
study indicates that although varying between polymer types, 
the recyclability of “Low-Quality” plastic waste is 12% to 
35% lower than those categorized as “high-quality” plastics 
waste. Therefore, plastics have different recyclability 
depending on polymer types, legislative requirements, 
product lifetime, and other variables. Recyclable plastics are 
clean bottles and containers, bags, etc. As contamination in 
recycling has many negative effects, such as recycling 
becomes more expensive as money and time are required to 
separate contaminants [13][14]. In addition, the quality of 
recyclable by-products decreases if contaminated, reducing 
the market value [15]. In other words, if the plastic wastes are 
contaminated, they will not be considered ‘recyclable’ 
anymore. Therefore, the recycling systems are in need of 
cleaner recycling. 
C. Agent-Based Modeling and its Applications in Recycling 
Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) is the 
approach used for the development of the model. ABMS is a 
computational modeling approach centered around the 
concept of to the term “agent” to describe complex processes, 
behavior, and phenomena [23]. Unlike other conventional 
modeling tools, agent-based modeling responds to the 
environment actively [24]. Certain properties and attributes 
are 
autonomous and 
self-directed, 
modular, 
social 
and interactable, living in an environment capable of learning 
and adapting, and having explicit goals and resource variables 
[25].  
A popular ABMS technology extensively used in 
education and research on human behavior is NetLogo 
[26][27]. NetLogo, a multi-agent and modeling environment, 
can simulate natural and social phenomena. It allows users to 
alter the agents and environment to observe the differences 
directly. It is also well suited for modeling a system that needs 
a few years to evolve and change [28]. Four types of agents 
existed in NetLogo are turtles, patches, links, and observer 
[26]. Turtles are active agents that can move inside the 
environment. It can perform the programmed functions during 
the ‘turtles’ movement and reflect correlative interactions 
between other turtles and agents. The patch is the square 
ground where turtles can move on, the links connect two 
turtles, and the observer is the agent who observes the 
simulated world and acts as the interface between it and the 
researcher [29].  
ABMS has also been used to study recycling behaviors. 
For instance, a study conducted in 2018 discovered behavior 
changes in post-consumer recycling through an agent-based 
modeling approach [30]. The simulation was applied to 
analyze the impact of critical factors in recycling behavior 
changes in Beijing’s residential community. The experiment 
showed that the provision of recycling facilities could cause 
little change in ‘residents’ behavior. However, face-to-face 
interactions between the experiment team and participating 
households increased awareness of plastic recycling.  
III. 
RESEARCH METHOD 
As the plastic waste lifecycle’s detailed investigation can 
be time-consuming and expensive, NetLogo may be an 
efficient tool to estimate one action’s outcomes. Once an 
ABMS has been built, the user can change multiple 
parameters manually to simulate a given environment’s 
plastics recycling process through an open user interface. The 
proposed system zooms in the life cycle of the general plastics 
waste. Three kinds of turtles were created: Plastics (plastics 
wastes), Center (recycling centers), and Houses (the number 
of households in a community).  
A. Definition of the Variables 
Variables shown in Table 1 were created in order to record 
the interaction of different turtles and the value changes, some 
variables were created to keep track of the progress and trigger 
different behaviors. Table I demonstrates the simulation 
variables with corresponding explanations and justifications 
for use.

B. The Simulation Workflow 
The process starts when the houses use plastics based on 
their weekly demand (variable demand). Then, the system 
checks the household’s recycling participation percentage 
(variable RecyclingParticipation) to see if the house will 
decide to recycle the plastic waste. If the household does not 
plan to do the recycling action, all plastic waste generated 
from the house will go into landfills. In contrast, the 
households that choose to perform the recycling action send 
the plastics to the recycling center. When the plastic wastes 
arrive at the recycling center, the center will check for the 
contamination rate (variable contamination_rate) of the 
collected plastics (variable collect). Only the plastics that are 
considered as uncontaminated can continue the process and 
check for their plastics recyclability (variable recyclability), 
while the “dirty” plastics will be sent to landfills. If the plastic 
waste is non-recyclable plastic, it will go into a landfill. The 
recycling center checks its recycling approach (variable 
recycle-approach) for the rest of the plastics. If the center 
applies a chemical recycling approach, the plastic waste will 
be converted to secondary products (variable new). In the case 
the center uses the mechanical recycling process, the plastic 
waste will be recycled with an increment in the number of 
times the plastics have been recycled in the system (variable 
ptime). Plastic waste that exceeds the recycled time will be 
downcycled and will disappear in the system. Eventually, the 
recycled plastics that are shipped back to the community will 
satisfy households’ needs and reduce their next cycle 
consumption. The user interface is shown in Figure 1.

SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
To test the feasibility of the simulator, we applies real-
world paramenters to the simulation. A baseline scenario is 
constructed to demonstrate the effect of the education

campaign and system-wide improvement. All the results are 
collected from 10 repetition run simulating the activities in 
25 weeks.  
A. Feasibility Testing  
According to the American Chemistry Council and the 
National Association for PET Container Resources, in 2018, 
(1) 35,680 thousand tons of plastics waste were generated, (2) 
5,620 thousand tons of plastics waste were combusted with 
energy recovery, (3) 3,090 thousand tons of plastics waste 
were recycled, and (4) the rest of 26,970 thousand tons of 
plastics waste ended up in landfills. Then, the recycling rate 
of 2018 plastics waste was 8.66%. On average, 25% of 
collected wastes are contaminated to be recycled [22]. If we 
assumed that all non-recyclable plastics would be 
incinerated, and 25% of the collected plastics went to landfill. 
Also, the sum of collected plastics in 2018 would be 11613 
thousand tons, with a 32.55% recycling participation rate 
(collected plastics/total generated plastics) and 35.48% of 
recyclable plastics rate (recycled plastics/non-recyclable 
plastics). Based on The Guardian, the U.S. produces about 
106.2 kg of plastics waste per person per year [32]. The 
weekly consumption per person would be 2.04 kg (106.2 
kg/52 weeks). Applying these parameters in the simulation, 
the average recycling rate is 8.97% for ten weeks run, and 
this result has less than 0.5% difference with the PET 
Container Resources data in 2018. 
B. Baseline Scenario 
Based on the nationwide parameters and literature review, 
we constructed a baseline situation in our model. The 
baseline Scenario simulates 500 households, with the 
recycling participation of 25%, plastics recyclability of 25%, 
and uses a mechanical approach. The maximum time that 
plastic waste could be reused was set to 2, and the average 
plastics consumption per household was 6 kg/week. 
Therefore, a fixed 25 percent contamination rate is applied in 
the baseline scenario and the rest of the experiments. Because 
the number of turtles needs to be positive integers, the 
parameters used to generate turtles were rounded up to whole 
numbers. This simulation scenario was acted as a ‘baseline’ 
to evaluate the effect of customer behavior changes or 
system-level improvements. The results of the baseline 
scenario are included in Figure 3.  
 
 
Figure 3.  Baseline testing of plastics waste management over 25 weeks. 
C. Effect of an Education Campaign  
Plastics Recyclability is the percentage of plastics 
considered “recyclable” when they arrive at the recycling 
center. Recycling participation refers to the tendency of each 
household to recycle weekly. Two possible reasons that cause 
the plastics waste unrecyclable are: there are no facilities 
supporting recycling for the specific type of plastics, and the 
plastics are contaminated during transportation or without 
improper recycling procedures. In this paper, we have a fixed 
contamination rate of 25% applied to all collected plastics, so 
the recyclability of the plastic here will only examine the 
plastic types.   
Education can make more people decide to recycle, or it 
can make them recycle more effectively and adequately. In 
this experiment, we tested the effect of an education 
campaign that produces individual improvement in recycling 
participation or plastics recyclability. We looked at the effect 
of 5%, 10%, 25%, and 50% improvements on plastics 
recyclability and recycling participation from our baseline, 
reflecting the increased sorting and recycling behaviors. The 
results, which are compared to the baseline testing, are shown 
in Figure 4. 
D. Experiment 2: Effect of System-wide Improvement 
This experiment examined potential system-wide 
improvement based on technological changes, infrastructure 
investments, or policy implementation that may boost 
recycling participation and plastics recyclability. Unlike 
education 
campaigns, 
system-wide 
improvements 
significantly 
improve 
waste 
management, 
such 
as 
California’s single-use plastic bags ban [35]. Improved 
recycling infrastructure can handle a broader set of plastics. 
We tested the plastics recyclability and recycling 
participation scenarios when they were 50%, 75%, and 100% 
(Hypothetical maximum), and the results are shown in Figure 
5.

Similar to the education campaign, higher plastics 
recyclability and higher recycling participation can lead to 
larger recycled plastics amounts, lower landfill deposits, and 
lower total plastics. Compared to plastics recyclability, 
recycling participation creates a slightly stable percentage 
increase in recycled plastics and percentage deduction in 
landfill deposits and total plastics. Especially in boosting the 
recycling participation, recycled plastics follow a similar 
increase proportion every week as the percentage increases. 
Therefore, we could predict that if the government considers 
investing in the system-wide development in its plastics 
waste to raise its recycling rate, increasing recycling 
participation may lead to a stable boosting in the recycling 
rate over weeks while increasing the recyclable plastics have 
more variations each week. Moreover, in this experiment, 
100% improvement is a test of hypothetical boundary 
conditions. The result shows that there remains a significant 
landfill problem even in a hypothetical scenario with 
recycling participation. 
 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION  
The results of the feasibility testing of nationwide data 
support that the simulator developed in this paper can be a way 
to predict the plastic waste trend. This study’s main 
conclusion was that approaching this system-level problem in 
a one-dimensional way is insufficient. Simply altering 
individual behaviors through education has limited effects on 
the system. Similarly, solely examining the technology 
development in both system-wide improvements has limited 
effects. Education, technology, and infrastructure changes 
should all be carried out to ameliorate the plastics waste 
management problem. Nevertheless, promulgating a policy or 
developing an advanced technology is not easy; before a 
system-wide improvement takes place, individual behavior 
change still affects the recycling rate to a certain degree.     
There are still some limitations and shortcomings in the 
present study. First, the plastics recycling approach was 
mainly based on plastic types. The simulation assumes all 
plastics categorized as recyclable can undergo both 
mechanical and chemical processes. Second, recycle 
participation can be a subjective factor and hard to record. 
Third, household amount limitation restricted the simulation’s 
scope, which can only simulate a community’s small region. 
Fourth, the incineration process was not considered in the 
simulator. Despite its limitations, the study combined the 
plastics waste management life cycle and computer 
technology to test various scenarios and predict possible 
outcomes. Further research is needed to consider the plastic 
types and test out the effect of the combination of education, 
technology, and infrastructure improvements in the system.
