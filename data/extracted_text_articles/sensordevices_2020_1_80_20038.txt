Abstract—This abstract presents a comparison between three 
types of surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors for measurement 
of particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 and surface cleaning of 
sensors after saturation. The first SAW sensor is a Love wave 
device based on SiO2/AT-quartz cut substrate, the second one is 
a Rayleigh wave sensor based Lithium Niobate (LiNbO3) 128° 
YX LiNbO3 and the last one is a Pseudo wave sensor on SiO2/41° 
YX LiNbO3. The SAW sensors are used in combination with a 3 
Lpm cascade impactor to classify particulates by size before 
being measured. The sensitivity was investigated using two type 
of aerosols PM2.5 and PM10 in the [0-200] µg/m3 concentration 
range. The sensors based on AT-Quartz show higher sensitivity 
for particulates matter measurements.  
Keywords-PM2.5; PM10; SAW sensors; Lithium Niobate; 
Quartz. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
      Particulate matter (PM) causes over 7 million premature 
deaths per year worldwide according to World Health 
organization [1]. PM can cause health effects like dangerous 
pneumonia diseases [2] and environmental damage. Over the 
last years, PM measurement has become a very important 
axis of research. Since the existing monitoring systems are of 
a considerable size and too expensive, miniaturization of 
monitoring systems has become one of the hot spot in actual 
research. The equipment of measurements has to be instantly 
reactive by performing measurements in real time. In our 
team, we have developed a system that combines a 
miniaturized cascade impactor features elastic surface 
acoustic wave sensor SAW [3]. This system takes advantage 
of a 3 Lpm cascade impactor as filtration system to separate 
PM10 and PM2.5 and integrated SAW sensors for real time 
measurement. The purpose of this study is to compare the 
sensitivity of three types of SAW sensor based on different 
piezoelectric substrates. The first sensor exploits Love waves 
on an AT-cut Quartz substrate, these having already been 
studied in previous works [3] but whose k² value is not 
sufficient to allow a potential cleaning of the surface. The 
second one is based on Rayleigh waves on a 128° YX LiNbO3 
substrates and the third one is a Pseudo Surface Acoustic 
Wave (PSAW) on 41°YX LiNbO3. A layer of silica with a 
thickness of 1.5 µm is deposited on the top of the PSAW and 
Love SAW sensors as a guiding layer with shear velocity 
lower than the substrates (3764 m/s). Lately, PSAW devices 
have become attractive in  several sensing applications such 
as liquid sensing [4] and biosensing [5]. PSAW can be 
generated on 36°YX LiTaO3 and 41°YX LiNbO3. The PSAW 
SAW crystals have a high electromechanical coupling factor 
and better temperature stability. The SAW sensors 
characteristics beside test conditions will be discussed in the 
section 2. The sensitivity results obtained will be presented in 
the last section. 
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL  
     SAW sensors consisting of delay lines are fabricated using 
a conventional photolithography process. The input and 
output interdigital transducers (IDT) consist of double finger 
pairs with a periodicity p of 10 µm and wavelength λ of 40 
µm. The region lying between the two IDTs constitutes the 
sensing area. Prior to conducting the measurements of the 
sensor’s responses, the electrical characterization was 
performed to measure the insertion loss and the phase 
response vs frequency. This step allows the validation of 
sensors before testing. The working frequency of delay lines 
are described in Table 1 for the three types of sensors.

the particle’s generator AGK 2000 (Palas® Model AGK 
2000) and the optical reference system FIDAS® 100. For the 
generation of PM, sodium chloride (NaCl) was used, while 
PM10 is derived from silicon carbide (SiC). The 
concentration of these two types of particles evolving 
between 0 and 200 μg/m3. When the particles fall on the 
sensor surface, the propagation of the acoustic waves is 
perturbed. Accordingly, the particle’s concentration can be 
determined by measuring the phase velocity shift of the wave 
from the phase signal with a dedicated electronic open loop 
interrogation [4].

sensors based AT-Quartz (in red), 128° YX LiNbO3 (in

According to these results, Love wave sensors based on AT 
quartz cut shows the best sensitivity for both PM2.5 and 
PM10. In the second range, Rayleigh wave based 128° YX 
LiNbO3 shows higher sensitivity than PSAW wave sensors 
for both type of particles PM10 and PM 2.5. The sensors 
sensitivity is estimated by applying a linear fit of the plotted 
data. The sensitivity of sensor based on Quartz is 3.10-4 °s-
1μg-1m3 for PM 2.5 and 5.10-5 °s-1μg-1m3 for PM 10. The 
sensitivity is approximately 3 times lower for the 128° YX 
LiNbO3 based sensors (1.10-4s-1μg-1m3 for PM 2.5 and 1.10-
5 ° s-1μg-1m3 for PM 10) and 5 times for the 41° YX LiNbO3 
(6.10- 5 s-1μg-1m3 for PM2.5 and 1.10-4 ° s-1μg-1m3 ). The 
dispersion of response points observed in the case of PM10 
measurement can be explained by the fact that most adhesion 
forces depend linearly on the diameter of the particles [5]. As 
a result, smaller particles settle more on the sensor surface, 
unlike larger particles, which are rebounded. Work is 
underway to develop a layer to overcome this phenomenon. 
Although the sensitivities of the sensors made from these last 
two substrates are less good than for quartz, they nevertheless 
seem interesting and sufficient to allow both a measurement 
of the particles targeted in environment while allowing the 
cleaning of the sensors to be tested once they will be used and 
fouled.
