Abstract— In this work, we present a complete wireless sensory 
system based on a chipless strategy in the sensor part. Instead 
of characterizing individually the sensor element, we show the 
response seen by the reader antenna through inductive 
coupling with respect to the detection parameter, in our case, 
moisture content. The wireless chipless sensor consists of an 
LC circuit fabricated by printed techniques on a flexible 
substrate. This substrate is actually the element sensitive to 
humidity by changes in its electrical permittivity. We show the 
differences in the frequency response depending on the 
measurement point: the variation in frequency is reduced more 
than 3 times when measuring at the reader antenna with 10 
mm distance between elements.  
Keywords-cantennas coupling; flexible substrate; printed 
electronics; reader; resonance frequency. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
A recent trend in sensor design is to remotely access the 
desired information via a wireless link, facilitating the 
monitoring of hazardous environments or under harsh 
conditions. This trend is known as wireless sensors. Typical 
wireless sensors can be differentiated into optical sensors, 
surface acoustic wave sensors, intermodulation sensors and 
radiofrequency (RF) sensors. Among RF sensors, we can 
distinguish electromagnetically coupled sensors and devices 
working on the far or near field regions, depending on the 
operating frequency. In the latter case, the coupling 
mechanism is inductive using typically LC resonant circuits 
[1]-[5]. This paper focuses on the LC-type passive sensors, 
which offer several advantages such as simple structure, easy 
to 
integrate 
and 
inexpensive 
to 
manufacture 
[6]. 
Furthermore, the sensor is acting highly energy-efficient due 
to the low operating frequency and the smaller coupling 
distance [7]-[9]. Based on the positive characteristics, recent 
researchers have investigated passive LC sensors in various 
environmental applications: temperature [7][9],  humidity [5] 
and pressure in the human body [10]. The core sensing 
system consists of an LC circuit, which is powered and 
interrogated remotely by a reader coil antenna. Variations in 
the physical or chemical conditions lead to changes in 
electrical properties, such as conductance or inductance, 
leading to a variation in the near field coupling properties. In 
order to obtain the resonant frequency wirelessly, an 
additional coil at the readout circuit is inductively coupled to 
the inductor of the LC circuit. The resulting frequency shift 
is measured by the change in the impedance of the reader 
coil [11]-[13]. As a consequence, parameters of interest are 
monitored remotely and the sensing system in the harsh 
environment is passively powered. Some authors have 
already studied the sensing capabilities of this kind of 
systems [13][14], demonstrating that minimal losses of the 
sensor is crucial to develop a wireless sensor system based 
on a coupled LC resonator. Moreover, the fabrication 
techniques employed are a critical factor because they define 
the performance and the cost of the sensor. In this sense, one 
of added value to this kind of sensors is to be manufactured 
by printed electronics (PE). This emerging technology can 
produce thin, flexible, wearable, lightweight, ultra-cost-
effective, and environmentally friendly structures [15]. The 
combination of PE technology with wireless chipless sensors 
is a promising alternative to develop sensors with low-cost 
process and provide to this circuitry all the mentioned 
characteristics. In a previous work, we presented printed 
resonant structures on a flexible substrate for humidity 
detection [16]. The devices consist of a screen-printed spiral 
inductor working as radio frequency identification (RFID) 
antenna and two different inkjet-printed planar capacitive 
structures forming LC resonators, being the substrate the 
sensitive layer [16]. In the same direction, Wang et al. [17] 
reported a wireless humidity sensor label manufactured by 
screen-printing and dry-phase patterning. The sensor label 
includes a planar antenna, a tuning capacitor and a printed 
sensor-capacitor head, where changes in humidity are 
detected as a shift of the resonant frequency. The printed 
sensor head is working as a resistive-type sensor between 
150 kHz and 250 kHz with a frequency shift of about 80 kHz 
between dry condition (10%RH) and high humidity (90% 
RH). 
In this work, we have looked into the real operation of 
LC printed structures acting as humidity sensors, considering 
all the elements of a full wireless sensor system. In Section II 
the fabrication and characterization of the wireless sensor 
system is described. In section III, the response of the 
wireless sensor is studied from the reader side because this 
element will be in charge of collecting all the sensor

information in any real scenario. We conclude the paper in 
Section IV. 
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Working Principle 
The global idea of this work is to develop wireless and 
chipless sensors capable of being read out by smart devices, 
making use of the common frequencies and technologies 
already in use (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth). To better understand 
our global approach, let us look at the high frequency (HF) 
band and implemented by Near Field Communication (NFC) 
and some RFID protocols. At this frequency, the working 
principle is based on the coupling between two coil antennas, 
one of them acting as reader (i.e. coil inductor included in 
the smartphones to implement NFC) and the other one acting 
as tag (element that provides the reader with some desired 
information). Nopper et al. demonstrated that only two 
independent parameters of the sensor circuit, i.e. quality 
factor and resonance frequency, can be extracted from a 
wireless measurement [13]. Normally, RFID tags include a 
silicon chip to establish the communication and send the 
requested information. The input impedance of these chips is 
capacitive (several hundreds of pF). Therefore, in the 
resonant circuit, this impedance represents the C-component, 
while the fabricated antenna corresponds to the inductive 
part (L). But, in the strategy that we are going to follow, no 
chip is going to be included, making our sensor tag chipless. 
So, the capacitive part of the circuit will be defined by the 
designed capacitive sensor. This sensing material will change 
the frequency response of the tag, providing the information 
in an analog way. We have already proved the feasibility of 
this approach for humidity sensing [16]. The elements of the 
system (reader and wireless LC sensor) were designed to 
resonate at HF band with ADS software (Keysight EEsof 
EDA, USA) [18]. The antenna design has been focused on 
the optimization of the antenna quality factor because it 
offers a longer read range and a better reading of the sensor 
information [19][20]. 
B. Fabrication process 
The selected materials were DGP-40LT-15C ink (ANP, 
Korea) with a solid content of 35% of silver nanoparticles 
dispersed in TGME (triethylene glycol monoethyl ether) for 
inkjetted patterns and silver conductive paste (Sigma 
Aldrich, USA) with a solid content higher than 75% for the 
screen printed ones. All the patterns were printed on a 
polyimide substrate with 75 µm thickness (Kapton® HN, 
DupontTM, Wilmington, DE, USA) taking advantage of the 
fact that its electrical permittivity varies with the relative 
humidity, as already shown in [16][21]. In order to obtain a 
compromise in the tag performance, the capacitive array was 
defined by inkjet printing to reduce the distance between 
consecutive fingers and, therefore, to increase the sensitivity 
without occupying more area whereas the coil inductor was 
screen printed because of its better performance with respect 
to the inkjetted antenna [18]. Then, the capacitive structures 
were defined with a DMP-2831™ Dimatix printer (Fujifilm 
Dimatix Inc, Santa Clara, USA) by only one printing layer. 
The substrate temperature was fixed at 60 °C during printing. 
A drop space of 40 μm was settled in the printer for 80 μm 
landed diameter drops followed by a drying step at 120 °C 
for 1 h. The inner and outer ends of the coil have been 
connected through a small “bridge” manufactured by ink-jet 
printing and attached using the adhesive epoxy EPO-TEK 
H20E (Epoxy Technology, Inc., Billerica, USA). A 100 
Nylon threads per centimeter (T/cm) mesh were used to 
manufacture the screen printed patterns. The tags consisted 
of one printed layer with a manual screen printing machine 
(FLAT-DX 100 from Siebdruck-Versand, Germany). Finally 
the curing process took place at 120 °C for 5 min. As reader, 
we fabricated a coil inductor milled in Flame-Retarded class 
4 (FR-4) copper clad laminate rigid substrate from Cirqoid 
(Latvia) with a metallization layer of 35 µm copper using a 
prototyping machine from Cirqoid (Latvia). A surface mount 
device (SMD) capacitor was soldered to resonate at 13.56 
MHz. In particular, the inductance is 5.9 µH and the 
capacitance 31 pF. 
C. Characterization 
The AC electrical characterization for the different 
fabricated tags was performed by measuring their 
impedance, both magnitude and phase, using the four-wire 
measurement technique with a precision Impedance 
Analyser E4294A and an impedance probe kit (4294A1) 
(Agilent Tech., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The stationary 
humidity and temperature responses of the tags were 
measured in a climatic chamber VCL4006 (Vötsch 
Industrietechnik GmbH, Germany). The excitation voltage 
applied in all measurements was VDC = 0 and VAC = 500 mV 
from 5 MHz to 30 MHz. We considered this frequency range 
because it contains the work frequency of the RFID chip 
(13.56 MHz) and enough frequencies around it to perceive 
shifts on the resonance frequency due to variations in the 
relative humidity. The distance between the reader and the 
sensors was defined with a spacer manufactured with a 3D 
printer (EntresD UP Plus2, Germany). The height of this 
custom frame was checked with a digital calliper (DIN 862) 
with a resolution of 0.01 mm. Coils of sensor and reader 
were aligned during measurements in order to maximize the 
coupling factor (M≈ 1). 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Reader characterization 
Figure 1 depicts the prototypes used as reader and as 
wireless sensors. As can be observed, both elements present 
a coil inductor and a capacitor. In the case of the reader, 
there is only one SMD capacitor to tune the resonance 
frequency to the band of interest, whereas we defined an 
array of capacitive IDEs in the case of the wireless sensor. 
This array forces the sensor not only to work in the HF band 
but also to be the sensitive element to RH variations. The 
electrical permittivity of the sensing element changes with 
moisture content, leading to a change in the total capacitance 
of this array, and therefore, the resonance frequency of this 
wireless sensor is directly shifted.

Figure 1.   (a) Reader and (b) wireless sensor. 
The first study carried out was the frequency response of 
the reader. Figure 1 shows the impedance seen by the reader 
when there is no tag in its vicinity and when a tag is placed at 
10 mm of it. In the former case (no sensor tag in the 
surroundings), the reader resonates at almost 14.5 MHz, 
whereas when the tag is approximated, the resonance of the 
reader decreases 0.5 MHz. This can be explained by the fact 
that real and imaginary parts of reader impedance are equal 
at resonance condition. Thus, when a tag is in the vicinity of 
the reader antenna, the measured input impedance changes 
[13], giving as a result the shift on frequency observed in 
Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2.  Module the reader and coupling between reader and wireless 
sensor. 
It should be noticed that this relationship depends on the 
coupling factor, and consequently, on the distance between 
the two elements. Therefore, all the characterization must be 
done at a fixed distance. Next, we present the results for 3 
different distances. It is important to clarify that in a real 
environment not only the reader antenna is important to 
define the whole systems, but also the full electronic design 
of the reader. One solution is to use a reader capable of 
detecting the resonance frequency [22][23]. 
B. Wireless humidity measurements 
In our previous work, we already showed that the 
impedance of the coil inductor presents almost no variation 
with respect to humidity (less than 0.02% in the studied RH 
range), proving that the element responsible of the variation 
of the LC structure response is the capacitive element of the 
circuit, in our case an array of interdigitated capacitors 
placed in parallel in order to increase the global capacitance 
of the system and its sensitivity [16]. We tested the response 
of the sensor at 3 different distances between reader and 
wireless device. In particular, we placed the wireless sensor 
at 10, 15 and 20 mm from the reader and measured the 
impedance in the reader side. Due to the fact that the 
capacitance increases when the moisture content is higher, 
the resonance frequency decreases at higher RH values. This 
trend can be observed in the three scenarios, although the 
effect of the distance is clearly appreciated: At the lowest 
distance, the effect of the humidity level in the resonance 
frequency is much more noticeable than at the other two 
tested distances. A shift of about 150 kHz is achieved at 10 
mm, whilst this shift is ten times lower when the distance is 
doubled.  
Looking at the change in the resonance frequency at the 
different RH levels (see figure 34), we have also noticed that 
the linearity of the response degrades when the distance 
between the two elements is too big, reducing the detection 
range of the system. Table 1 summarizes the variation in the 
resonance frequency at the RH range studied together with 
the calculated sensitivity for the different distances. The 
sensitivity is defined as follows: 
𝑆𝑅𝐻(𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡. ) ≡ 𝜕𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑇=𝑐𝑡𝑒 (𝑅𝐻)
𝜕 𝑅𝐻
 
(1) 
Comparing these resonance values with the one presented 
in [16], a reduction in the frequency shift of about 70% 
(~500 kHz) is observed when, instead of measuring directly 
the response of the wireless sensor, the measurement point is 
fixed at the reader side. This reduction highlights the 
importance of performing the characterization at the reader 
side when a wireless sensory system is described. This loss 
of sensitivity can be associated to the coupling factor (M) 
that is inversely related to the distance between the elements 
[13]. Therefore, the larger the distance between reader and 
sensor tags, the poorer their coupling factor and, thus, the 
lower the sensitivity of the wireless sensor.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In this work, we present the characterization of a wireless 
chipless system focusing our interest on the reader side. 
Normally, this kind of systems is described by showing only 
the frequency response of the sensor to the magnitude of 
interest but it is forgotten what happens in a real environment 
where a reader element needs to extract the sensor 
information. For this reason, we have shown the coupling 
characteristics of the chipless sensory system at the reader 
side, varying the distance between the two antennas: reader 
and sensor one. To do that, a wireless chipless device 
sensitive to moisture content have been fabricated by printed 
techniques on a flexible substrate and placed in the vicinity 
of a reader in FR-4 technology, showing how important is 
the influence of the distance between the devices is critical 
for the proper and ubiquitous use of the system. In particular, 
a sensitivity of -2.6 kHz/%RH is observed at 10 mm distance 
while this value decreases more than 10 times when the 
separation between the reader and the wireless sensor is 
doubled.
