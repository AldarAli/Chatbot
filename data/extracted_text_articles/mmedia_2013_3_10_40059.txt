Abstract— This paper aims at illustrating a collaborative and 
modular web platform in the domain of digital and 
computational philology. The proposed work deals with 
parallel multilingual and multimedia resources. Two case 
studies are discussed in order to show the flexibility of the 
designed platform. The reusability of the components in 
different projects is achieved by abstract modeling and 
through the application of effective design patterns. The 
platform deals 
with 
textual resources and 
associated 
multimedia content, which can be retrieved by the metadata 
and shown in parallel (e.g., the page image of a manuscripts 
and the related transcription). The library of components will

 INTRODUCTION 
A general introduction provides an overview on 
initiatives and projects related to the specific domain of 
digital philology. The proposed methodology, illustrated in 
the second section, is based on the application of design 
patterns. Two pilot projects constitute the results shown in 
the third section: the former is an application for digital 
epigraphy and the latter is an application to manage 
manuscripts. Finally, conclusions are discussed, in order to 
point out the flexibility and reusability of the system. 
Current trends in digital and computational philology are 
focused 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
collaborative 
environments, in order to provide the international scholarly 
community with a suitable infrastructure to share and reuse 
scientific products, such as digital critical editions, 
commentaries, linguistic and stylistic analyses, annotations 
on manuscript page images, descriptions of archaeological 
and epigraphical artifacts, etc.[13-17][19][23] 
The main efforts to achieve this aim are (1) the 
standardization of data formats for literary and philological 
studies[2][16][19][23], (2) the modelling of domain 
ontologies[4-6], (3) the interconnection with disciplines 
focused 
on 
text-bearing 
objects, 
such 
as 
Digital 
Epigraphy[13][23] or artifacts mentioned in literary works, 
such as Digital Archaeology and, eventually, (4) the 
management of data by web-services through common 
protocols, such as OAI-PMH [1]. 
The standardization of data formats for literary and 
philological studies is the mission of the Text Encoding 
Initiative (TEI [2]). The TEI provides XML schemes and 
guidelines for text, extra-text, and para-text encoding with 
bibliographical, linguistic and philological meta-information. 
Domain ontologies are provided by various institutions. 
Europeana [3], a platform for information and knowledge 
exchange in the domain of Digital Humanities, has 
formalized a data model that is becoming a de-facto standard 
(EDM: Europeana Data Model [4]).  
The CIDOC-CRM [5], on the other hand,  provides the 
conceptual reference model in the domain of Digital 
Archaeology and a joint effort between CIDOC-CRM and 
the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records has 
created FRBRoo [6]: an ontology intended to link 
bibliographical and museographic information. 
Web-services allow the data exchange among working 
groups distributed world-wide. In the field of classical 
literature and philology, Bamboo [7] and Interedition [8] aim 
at providing web-services to make critical editions in 
collaborative environments. 
The Perseus Project [9] (Tufts University) is the leading 
initiative 
that 
provides 
scholars 
with 
the 
suitable 
cyberinfrastructure: Philologist, powered by Son of Suda 
(SoSol [10]), and Alpheios [11] are the web applications that 
allow the version-controlled editing of texts and linguistic 
analyses associated to them. The identification of textual 
units is formalized by the Canonical Text Service (CTS 
[12]), which associate a URN (Uniform Resource Name) to 
every word of any specific edition. 
 
As shown above, standard data formats on one hand and 
web-services on the other hand, highly promote the 
interoperability. But in the field computational philology it is 
necessary to improve also the software reusability. Whereas 
libraries and API for information retrieval, such as Lucene or 
linguistic analysis, such as LingPipe exist and are 
46

maintained, libraries devoted to the specific field of 
computational 
philology 
are 
wanted: 
computational 
linguistics analyzes a single text flow associated to single 
linguistic analyses (e.g., syntactic and semantic analyses), 
whereas computational philology must deal with multiple 
versions of the same text (due to variants in the manuscripts 
or conjectural emendations provided by the scholars) and 
multiple interpretations at each level of analysis (due to the 
disagreement of authoritative scholars recorded in several 
commentaries along the centuries). 
The main purpose of our work is the constitution of a 
library of components (the CoPhi Beans library) focused on 
philological activities, such as the alignment of complex 
textual objects (e.g., the alignment of variants according to 
their semantic similarity, not only according to the edit 
distance of the inflected forms), the extension of levels of 
analysis (e.g., metrical and colometrical analysis) or editing 
and 
retrieval 
of 
multiple, 
concurrent 
annotations. 
Furthermore, the linkage of textual resources to multimedia 
sources, such as the manuscript page images, must be taken 
into account in the new paradigm of philology in the digital 
age, which pays increasing attention to the disintermediation 
between the philologist and the (digital representation of) the 
primary sources. 
Due to the abstract modeling and the modular design, our 
library and the platform based on, even if it is still in alpha 
version, is already used in a number of national and 
international projects devoted to manage parallel multimedia 
resources, such as text, image and music combined together. 
 
Three main areas are involved for developing a platform 
based on the CoPhi Beans library able to deal with such 
spread needs: 
 
Acquisition of resources by Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR) or information extraction and 
document 
transformation 
from 
semi-structured 
resources 
to 
structured 
ones (ETL: 
Extract, 
Transform and Load); 
 
Text processing and indexing; 
 
Collaborative Enterprise Application designing and 
developing. 
 
Eventually, 
we 
are 
designing 
and 
developing 
components, modules and plug-ins for a collaborative 
enterprise web-based system in order to build a suitable 
environment to analyze, on one hand, manuscripts and 
printed documents and, on the other hand, to produce new 
critical editions. 
II. 
METHODOLOGY 
Flexibility and reuse is achieved by a modular and 
abstract design of the components.  
The core of the platform is: (1) the view resources 
component, (2) the search and index component, (3) the 
analysis component, (4) the comment and collaborative 
component (5) the editorial component. 
The architecture of our platform is based on the MVC 
(Model View Controller) pattern, which separates the 
business model from the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and 
from the objects devoted to the behavioral aspects. Fig. 1 
shows the class model design involved in commenting 
results and the design model involved in the analysis process. 
Comments written by the users in natural language and 
micro-annotations automatically produced by morpho-
syntactic parsers must be editable versioned and searchable. 
Furthermore Textual components can be composite with 
linguistic analyses and multimedia resources (images, audio, 
etc.) in a flexible way, at different levels of granularity 
(single words, sentences, paragraphs, documents, etc.). In 
order to achieve this goal, compound patterns have been 
used: (1) Composite (2) Typed Relationship (3) Factory 
Method. 
 
The whole system has been developed according to the 
Java Server Faces 2 specification (JSR-314) and according to 
the general JSR-316 specification (Java Enterprise Edition 
6). Persistence is obtained using a native XML-DB, eXist, 
which stores and retrieves documents encoded in TEI or 
other XML compliant documents. 
The system, currently in alpha release, is producing 
promising results and several deployments in real projects, 
such as the Res Gestae Divi Augusti Web App and the 
Saussure Web App, which will be illustrated below. 
III. 
RESULTS 
A. Res Gestae Divi Augusti Web Application 
The Res Gestae Divi Augusti Web Application handles 
the Mommsen’s edition of the well known bilingual epigraph 
(Fig. 2). The aligned texts are shown in parallel and the 
granularity of the information is flexible: the units can be 
paragraphs for a coarse alignment, words for the 
morphological analysis and characters for the annotation of 
the status on the stone, such as readable or unreadable.  
The comment component allows scholars to record 
exegetical annotations, commenting fragments on a selected 
chunk of text, which can be labeled. Index and Search 
component is suitable for advanced text retrieval based on 
metadata produced both by automatic processes and by 
scholar studies. For example in this project it is possible to 
perform queries for chunks in both languages (Greek and 
Latin) and word status on the available support (e.g., attested 
or conjectured).  
B. A digital edition of F. de Saussure’s Manuscripts 
A prototype of the digital edition of Saussure’s texts, 
based on a representative selection of his manuscript images 
and transcriptions, has been the focus of a Research 
Programs of Relevant National Interest (PRIN2008). This 
project has been a test for evaluating the platform with text 
and image resources. The text has been extracted from semi-
structured electronic documents and transformed in a TEI-
compliant format. Fig. 3 shows the component that manages 
parallel resources, in order to browse and search both texts 
and images. The links are referred to annotations that author 
of the manuscripts has done and to which editor refers in the 
critical apparatus. As shown in Fig. 1, the platform is based 
47

on component aggregation (e.g., comments), or on the 
extension of components (e.g., indexes). Many indexes (one 
per language used in Saussure’s quotations) are required in 
this project. Consequently, the component is able to handle 
indexes and concordances for each language.  
The comment component is useful to enhance 
collaborative annotations and arrange canonical linkage 
between selected text, such as named entity and authoritative 
resources on the web infrastructure. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
The new paradigm of computational philology in the 
current web generation is the collaborative philology, based 
on crowdsourcing both for software development and for the 
acquisition and generation of data. Even if many libraries of 
components have been implemented for computational 
linguistics, which can be reused in the domain of philology, 
computational philologists must afford specific issues due to 
multiple readings 
of the 
same text and multiple 
interpretations 
of 
the 
same 
reading. 
Furthermore, 
collaborative philology is open to other disciplines, such as 
palaeography, codicology, musicology, which heavily 
involve multimedia. For this reason we have illustrated how 
we are developing a library of java components that 
constitutes the core of a web platform, focused on the 
domain of collaborative philology to deal with texts and 
related multimedia sources. As seen above, the modularity of 
the system promotes the reuse of philological components in 
many applications. This aim is achieved both by aggregation 
and by extension.  
 
Future work gives priority to the multimedia aspects of 
the philological studies. The same framework used to create 
a new textual edition from many corrupted witnesses can be 
applied to restore a sound track from many low quality, 
noisy or incomplete recordings of the same concert. APIs 
developed by third parties devoted to specific tasks, such as 
sound track alignment, will be studied and interfaced to our 
platform.  
 
In conclusion, collaborative philology is experiencing a 
double transition: on one hand it is moving from single, 
desktop applications towards web applications, web services 
and distributed programming, on the other hand it is 
widening its attention from text to multimedia.
