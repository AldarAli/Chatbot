dispersion of the ultra wide band pulse and correlation 
between signals received at different locations.

 INTRODUCTION 
There is now an increased interest for ensuring high bit 
rate communication and localization in tunnels. As an 
example, for automatic underground subways, a train to 
track link allows increasing the performances of maintenance 
and 
control-command 
techniques. 
Similarly, 
video 
surveillance, voice communication and wireless sensor 
monitoring are of great importance in underground mines.  A 
large number of papers have thus already been published in 
the literature for studying the narrow band and wide band 
channel characteristics.  
For mine tunnels, the variation of path loss as a function 
of frequency from 2 GHz to 5 GHz was studied in [1] and a 
frequency-domain autoregressive model was developed. 
Various communication links were also considered including 
both Line-of-Sight (LOS) and non-LOS scenarios [2].  
In case of road or railway tunnels, path loss and 
probability distribution with respect to fading widths 
deduced from measurements at 2 GHz were detailed in [3], 
while the effects of pedestrians and vehicles in different road 
tunnels are studied in [4]. A wideband directional 
measurement campaign conducted inside an arched highway 
tunnel is described in [5]. Using a channel sounder centered 
at 5.2 GHz with a bandwidth of 100 MHz, the spatio-
temporal characteristics of the received propagation paths are 
estimated by means of a super-resolution estimation 
algorithm. Lastly, for a road tunnel, many papers deal with 
channel characterization for predicting the performance of a 
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) link, without or 
with polarization diversity [6]. 
The objective of this contribution is to extend these 
previous experimental works for studying the time domain 
channel response for ultra wide band (UWB) applications. 
Frequency domain measurements have thus been carried out 
in a straight road tunnel, and in a band extending from 
2.8 GHz to 5 GHz. Time domain analysis was then 
performed through Fourier Transform.  
This paper is organized as follows: Section II briefly 
recalls the methodology of the measurement campaigns 
while Section III presents results on the mean path loss, 
small scale fading and delay spread. An analysis of the 
waveform of the received signal as a function of the distance 
between the transmitter and the receiver is detailed in 
Section IV and the correlation between signals received at 
different positions is also studied. 
II. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASUREMENT CAMPAIGN 
Measurements took place in a straight arched tunnel, 
3 km long. Its transverse section was semicircular and the 
diameter of the cylindrical part was 8.6 m. The maximum 
height was 6.1 m at the center of the tunnel. The tunnel was 
nearly free of obstacles like road signs, lamps, cables, etc. 
Furthermore the roughness of the walls was rather small, on 
the order of few cm. The tunnel was closed to traffic and 
consequently, the channel can be considered as stationary 
during the experiments. The transmitting (Tx) and receiving 
(Rx) antennas were wideband conical antennas, their gain 
being nearly flat in the bandwidth of interest.  
Both Tx and Rx antennas were mounted on a rail, put at 
1 m above ground and allowing their displacement, 
controlled by a step by step motor, on a maximum distance 
of 33 cm. During this measurement campaign, these rails 
were put perpendicular to the tunnel axis. The spatial step in 
this transverse plane was 3 cm, corresponding to half a 
wavelength at 5 GHz. This leads, for each axial distance D 
between Tx and Rx and for each frequency, to a set of 144 
values of the channel transfer function H. The axial step was 
chosen to be equal to 4 m when 50 m < D < 202 m and to 
6 m when 202 m < D < 500 m. Tx and Rx were not moving 
during measurements and thus the Doppler effect was 
avoided.  
The channel sounder was based on a vector network 
analyzer (VNA). The Rx antenna was directly connected to 
one port of the VNA using a low attenuation coaxial cable 
and a 30 dB low-noise amplifier. To be able to make 
measurements up to 500 m, the signal of the Tx port of the 
VNA was converted into an optical signal, which was sent 
through fibre optics. The frequency step is 1.37 MHz from 
2.8 to 5 GHz, leading to 1601 frequency points.  
More details concerning the utilized system and 
experimental aspects of this study can be found in [7]. One 
can also mention that for this type of channel, the main 
contribution at large distance comes from multiple 
reflections of rays impinging the tunnel walls under a

grazing angle of incidence. Furthermore path loss strongly 
decreases for frequencies such that the transverse dimensions 
of the tunnel are much larger than the wavelength λ. 
However, when the roughness of the walls becomes on the 
order of λ, diffusion effect may counterbalance this decrease 
of path loss. 
III. 
MEAN PATH LOSS, SMALL SCALE FADING AND 
DELAY SPREAD 
In narrow band communication systems, path loss is 
frequency and distance dependent, while small scale fading 
is due to constructive and destructive interference of all 
possible paths between Tx and Rx. For UWB signals the 
most important characteristics are related to the variation of 
the energy of the pulse and not of its individual spectral 
components. Table 1 gives the value of the path loss defined 
as the value of the received power averaged over the whole 
frequency band, and normalized to the transmitted power.

We clearly see the guiding effect of the tunnel, the 
additional attenuation between 100 m and 500 m being only 
4 dB.  
To determine the characteristics of the small-scale 
fading, we consider a rectangular grid containing successive 
Rx positions. The width of the grid, i.e., its dimension along 
the transverse axis is equal to 33 cm and corresponds to the 
maximum displacement of the antenna in the transverse 
plane. Along the tunnel axis, we consider 3 successive 
distances as shown in Figure 1. Thus the length of the grid is 
either 8 m or 12 m depending if the distance D between Tx 
and Rx is smaller or larger than 200 m, as explained in 
Section I.  
 
 
Figure 1.  Successive positions of the Tx and Rx antennas. The transverse 
dimension of the tunnel is 8.6 m. The antennas are situated in the middle of 
one lane of this 2-lane tunnel. 
The standard deviation (“std”) of the path loss in the 
rectangular grid, normalized to its average value in this grid, 
was calculated for successive values of D varying between 
50 m and 480 m and by also considering the 12 possible 
positions of the Tx antenna in the transverse plane of the 
tunnel. Curve in Figure 2 shows that std does not vary 
appreciably with the distance and remains on the order of 
15%. This means that there is almost no fading as a result of 
interference and this is the same conclusion as in the case of 
propagation in typical in-building environment [8], [9], [10]. 
The time domain analysis of the propagation channel is 
based on measurement results in the frequency domain by 
applying a Fourier transform. For each axial distance D, the 
average delay spread is deduced from the channel impulse 
response (CIR) calculated for each of the 12x12, i.e., 144 
channels associated to the possible positions of the antennas 
in the transverse plane. As shown in Table II, the delay 
spread remains nearly constant, whatever the distance.

 This result is strongly related with the direction of the 
rays joining the transmitter and the receiver. In the horizontal 
plane, and for each value of D, the Angle of Arrival (AoA) 
and the angle of Departure (AoD) of the various rays can be 
deduced from measurements of the channel transfer function 
at various points in the transverse plane, by using high 
resolution estimation techniques, as the Space-alternating 
Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm 
[11].  
The variation of the angular spread As of the AoA and 
AoD is plotted in Figure 3. At 50 m from Tx, the angular 
spread is equal to about 12° and then continuously decreases 
with distance. The fact that the delay spread remains constant 
can thus be explained by this decrease of As with distance, 
which leads to rather constant time intervals between the 
successive rays. Consequently, the slope of the power delay 
profile becomes independent on the distance. It must be 
emphasized that measurements were done in static 
conditions and in an empty tunnel. In more realistic

situations, i.e., in presence of vehicles or obstacles, one can 
expect to get additional reflected signals but mainly if these 
obstacles are situated in the vicinity of the Rx antenna. This 
will lead to a slight increase of the delay spread but the 
previous conclusions may remain valid. One can mention 
that the results of narrowband and wideband propagation 
measurements conducted at 900 and 1800 MHz in five 
tunnels and described in [4] include the effects of 
pedestrians, vehicles, and curvature on propagation. A 
narrowband analysis showing the effects of vehicles is also 
presented in [12].

IV. 
TIME DISPERSION AND CORRELATION 
In this section, the change of the waveform of the pulse 
propagating in the tunnel is studied. Furthermore, the 
correlations between the transmitted pulse and the received 
pulse, on one hand, and between pulses received at different 
distances on the other hand, are emphasized.  
A. Time dispersion 
As previously outlined in Section II, the complex channel 
transfer function is measured in the frequency domain 
between 2.8 and 5 GHz. To get a real-value transmitted 
pulse, this transfer function is combined with its complex 
conjugate in the negative frequency domain before applying 
a Fourier transform. To avoid numerous oscillations, a 
Hamming window is used and the equivalent transmitted 
pulse is thus represented in Figure 4. Its peak amplitude is 
normalized to unity. The pseudo frequency corresponds to 
the center of the frequency band under analysis (3.9 GHz). 
The pulses, which would be received at a distance of 50 
m and 54 m start at 165 ns and 180 ns, respectively. 
However, to make an easiest comparison between these two 
pulses, they have been shifted in the time domain as in 
Figure 5 (a) and (b) to start at the same time. The origin of 
the time axis is quite arbitrary.  
We observe a first cluster, which includes the direct path 
and a succession of other clusters corresponding to multipath 
propagation. Within this kind of clusters, the waveform may 
strongly vary with distance.  
This means that at a distance D1, the signal may be 
positive at a given time but may become negative at the same 
time at another distance D2. By adding the signals measured 
at successive distances but shifted to start at the same time, 
one can thus expect to visualize the coherence between the 
signals received along the tunnel axis. This qualitative 
approach leads to curve (c) in Figure 5, this signal being 
obtained by averaging the waveforms at 50, 54 and 58 m. 
We observe, as expected, a decrease in amplitude of clusters 
associated with multipath propagation.

One can do the same approach to visualize the coherence 
in the transverse plane. Let us consider, for example, a 
distance of 50 m between Tx and Rx.  
To plot the curve in Figure 6, the 144 signals obtained by 
combining the 12 possible positions of both Rx and Tx in the 
transverse plane, have been summed. We see that all clusters, 
except the one, which includes the direct path, have 
negligible amplitude. 
The received power and the channel impulse response 
can be easily deduced from the amplitude of the received 
signal and from the correlation between the transmitted 
signal and the received signal. 
A quantitative approach of the correlation is presented in 
the next paragraphs.

B. Transverse correlation 
For a given axial distance D, one can compute the 
correlation, in the transverse plane, between the signal 
received by one Rx antenna and the signal received by the 11 
others, the spatial step being 3 cm. This correlation is 
calculated for each of the 12 positions of the transmitter. 
This allows getting the average value of the correlation 
between the received signals in the transverse plane; the 
maximum distance between the receiving points being 
33 cm. Results are presented in Figure 7 for three values of 
the axial distance D. 
 If we first consider a distance of 102 m, we see that the 
correlation coefficient rapidly decreases and reaches 0.5 for a 
distance between receiving points of 9 cm. For larger axial 
distance D, 314 and 498 m in this example, the slope of the 
decrease is less important.  
This result can be explained in frequency domain by the 
modal approach of the propagation of electromagnetic waves 
in the tunnel, which acts as an oversize waveguide. At large 
distances, the number of modes significantly contributing to 
the received power decreases. This gives rise to a more 
coherent transverse field [7]. 
C. Axial correlation 
Due to experimental constraints, the successive points of 
measurements along the tunnel axis were 4 m or 6 m apart, 
depending on the distance D.  This distance is not small 
enough to clearly point out the decrease of the correlation 
ρax between signals. Indeed, for the first step, i.e., at 4 m, the 
correlation coefficient between Rx points situated at             
D = 50 m and at D = 54 m is already equal to 0.4.  
The only point, which could be studied is the variation of 
ρax between points situated at D = z and at D = z + 4 or at    
D = z + 6, when z varies from 50 m up to 500 m.  
The calculation shows that ρax increases from 0.4 for             
z = 50 m to 0.7 for z = 500 m. This can be explained, as in 
the case of the correlation in the transverse plane, by the 
decrease of the number of propagating modes at large 
distance from the transmitter.

CONCLUSION 
In 
this 
contribution, 
the 
time 
domain 
channel 
characteristics for a tunnel environment have been studied. 
The guiding effect of the tunnel clearly appears on the mean 
path loss, the small scale fading related to the energy of the 
UWB pulse being very small as it is the case for in-building 
environment. 
The signals received at different locations in the 
transverse plane of the tunnel are rapidly uncorrelated, the 
correlation coefficient being equal to 0.5 if the receiving 
points are 9 cm apart.  
However the correlation increases at large distance of the 
transmitter due to the attenuation of high order propagating 
modes, which leads to a decrease of the number of modes 
playing a non negligible role in the received signal.  
Further work will be to develop a time domain statistical 
model, based on measurement results. This model will then 
be used to extend the physical layer approach described in 
this paper to simulate a communication link, taking the 
modulation scheme into account, in order to predict flow 
throughput and bit error rate.
