 INTRODUCTION 
This article describes a new concept called the Wireless 
Polling Sensor Network (WPSN) to be used in the Future 
Warrior gear. It comprises sensor nodes that are not 
networked with each other but communicate with a mobile 
ad hoc network of a small number of Unmanned Air 
Vehicles (UAVs), also called drones. The article presents the 
motivation and some applications of the concept. The article 
is an extended version of a paper [1] presented in the ICDT 
conference in 2010 and in addition to material from [1], it 
includes an evaluation of the basic concept of the proposed 
UAV-sensor network solution, and presents a new crypto-
protocol based on exchanging One-Time Pads, used between 
base stations and other nodes of the proposed system. The 
crypto-protocol has appeared earlier in the departmental 
preprint series [2] but has not been published.  
The main setting of the WPSN is the Future Warrior 
system. A warrior’s electronic skeleton, shown in Fig. 1, is a 
backbone and a platform for implementing required 
electronic solutions to be used in modern warfare. The 
Wireless Polling Sensor Network is a part of a larger system 
of communication, navigation and positioning systems.

Militaries search advantage in the future battlefield 
through novel solutions utilizing existing technologies and 
communication network systems and thereby enhancing the 
warrior efficiency. The main objective of these networks and 
technical solutions is to improve Situational Awareness (SA) 
[3] at all of the warrior levels in the decision-making 
process. Blue Force Tracking-systems (BFT) are an essential 
part of SA. They provide vital information for commanders 
in helping them to make better decisions and to avoid 
fratricide. Troops need to be constantly precisely located. It 
is crucial to improve the efficiency of dismounted operations 
with smaller and more capable units. The units require a 
great degree of flexibility and reliability in order to obtain 
their goals. 
Future Warrior systems apply several levels of warriors 
from the least trained to the experienced commanders or the 
professionals of the Special Forces. Table 1 shows examples 
of different technical solutions that are needed at different 
warrior levels. Demands for the solutions are derived from 
the needs of the warriors at different levels according to their 
performance and tasks. The WPSN-system applications must 
be implemented into Future Warrior systems taking into 
account the different warrior levels. 
One of the most important constraints imposed by the 
Future Warrior system is the maximum weight of any 
equipment in the warrior gear. For instance if a ground-based 
fixed sensor node has a mass can reach up to 10 kg the nodes

can be transported to the site by the Special Forces. The 
UGVs present a better payload platform, but they are 
significantly slower, and their control and communication 
systems need to be improved.

DIFFERENT WARRIOR LEVELS. 
 
 
In order to motivate the WPSN concept, let us recall the 
typical structure of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). A 
WSN usually contains an ad hoc network of sensor nodes, a 
gateway node, and a control station. This results in problems 
with energy, security and in military applications of 
survivability. This type of a WSN loses connectivity when a 
sufficient number of nodes is removed or destroyed. It may 
also be too easily detected, and its life-time may be short and 
unpredictable. There are only few civilian applications 
available for ad hoc WSNs, such as applications for 
monitoring seismic and environmental changes. A more 
traditionally structured WSN comprises a base station and 
sensor nodes connected by wireless links. 
Another motivation for WPSN we get from the present 
UAV systems for dismounted soldiers. UAVs bring a 
significant edge in the C4I2 environment as a new sensor and 
a relay platform but the present solutions are far from 
perfect. These systems have a base controller, a line-of-sight 
data link to the UAV and a relatively small UAV, typically 
equipped with a camera (Infra-Red or visual). Because of the 
line-of-sight requirement, they have a limited range and 
cannot be easily used in urban areas. Additionally, the 
camera does not see anything else than what is happening at 
the moment the UAV’s camera surveys the area. A single 
small UAV has also a very small payload on the range of 
pounds [4]. 
The Wireless Polling Sensor Network (WPSN) is 
proposed as a solution to the problems of both the WSN and 
the small UAV systems. WPSN comprises a mobile ad hoc 
network of UAVs or UGVs with 1-n nodes, n being a small 
number, and a set of fixed ground-based sensors. The 
network of UAV can operate as a multi-hop ad-hoc network 
in case it is motivated, for instance, by multi-sensor co-
operation, or by a lack of a line-of-sight connection. A 
control station has a data link to a selected node of this 
mobile network. More than one node improves survivability 
in applications where nodes can be destroyed. The sensor 
nodes do not form a network but they are polled by a 
selected node of the mobile network. A possibility for this is 
created by adding a random-access event channel.  
The WPSN solution has many advantages over the 
traditional WSNs: Polling can use sensor specific codes and 
security issues become easy. The fixed sensor nodes do not 
lose connectivity even if a high number of nodes are 
removed. The WPSN is a part of mobile mesh network 
systems operating in an environment of harsh propagation of 
channels and interference, frequent and rapid changes of 
network topology [5]. 
The need for a special gateway node, typical to a WSN, 
is removed: the fixed sensor nodes use directional antennas 
that only emit in the upward direction and an UAV polls 
them. The signal strength remains sufficient for a UAV on 
reasonable altitudes and the fixed sensor nodes are difficult 
to locate by ground-based measurements. The transmit 
antenna selection is a practical technique for achieving 
significant power gain, even with commodity hardware and 
without changes to the 802.11 protocols [6]. For example, 
field experiments have been conducted in which the network 
was based on the frequencies of 2,4 and 5,8 GHz,  and also 
the 900 MHz frequency was used for the point to point mode 
[7]. The detection methods are based on motion, either 
seismic, or acoustic etc. The WPSN concept can use also in 
Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) instead of UAVs. In a 
UGV application, the fixed sensor nodes can, for example, 
be GPS pseudolites that an UGV installs [8]. The 
composition of this paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews the 
background work. Section 3 presents applications of UAV-
based sensor networks and the overall evaluation of the 
concept. 
Section 
4 
concentrates 
on 
a 
provably 
computationally secure protocol between base stations and 
other nodes. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK 
Several Future Soldier Programs are currently underway 
in various militaries, including the Finnish Army definition 
work contributing to its Future Warrior (Future Force 
Warrior, FFW) and its demands. The result involves defining 
the gear for each level of a Future Warrior. The critical 
solutions involve communicating, Situational Awareness 
(SA) and Command and Control (C2) information among 
highly dispersed battlefield units in a dynamic environment 
[3][9]. In fact, the US Army is fielding its new SA system 
known as Force XXI Battle Command and Brigade and 
Below (FBCB2) [9]. An extension of this is the Deep Green. 
The need for UV-based sensor systems is clear. There are 
strict constraints on the weight and dimensions of equipment 
carried by a soldier and therefore it is essential for the Future 
Force Warrior (FFW) to be networked and to use external 
systems based on new innovations. One way of networking a 
soldier installing a high-bandwidth conformal antenna into 
the soldier’s helmet with the coverage of over 750 MHz 
through a 2,7 GHz frequency band [10].

Systems that are very similar to the proposed WPSN, 
comprising a network of UVs and a fixed set of sensors, do 
not seem to exist yet. Presently UAVs are directly connected 
to a base station [11]. There are some experimental UAV 
networks [11][12]. UGV networks seem to be non-existing, 
while single UGVs are widely used e.g. by police forces. 
However, all technical elements of the WPSN solution are 
available. The novelty of the WPSN solution is not in 
technical elements but in the realization that the solution can 
fill certain currently critical military needs.  
The WPSN system uses a mobile network of UVs. It can 
be considered as a Mobile Backbone Network (MBN) of a 
sensor network. A typical layout of a MBN is based on the 
Backbone network (Bnet), access nets (Anets) and regular 
(flat) ad hoc network(s) [13]. A Mobile Backbone Network 
Routing with the Flow Control (MBNR-FC) method is a 
known method to improve network throughput as well as the 
packet delay, the delay jitter and the loss ratio performance 
[14].  
Possible solutions for tracking and location service have 
been searched from satellite positioning systems, like the 
Global Positioning System (GPS). With Differential Global 
Positioning Systems (DGPS) the errors of GPS can be 
corrected to the acceptable level of few meters [14] [7] [22]. 
However, GPS cannot always be relied on and especially 
militaries that do not own positioning satellites are constantly 
in search of alternative methods.  
There are many existing MAC protocols and some of 
them can provide sufficient Quality of Service in a MANET. 
The mobile ad hoc network between the UAVs in the WPSN 
uses a MAC protocol called ISMA/RA (Inhibit Sense 
Multiple Access/with Reservation for Ad hoc networks) 
presented in [26]. It was developed in 2004 by the first 
author and Marko Ahvenainen [27] for military ad hoc 
networks, and has been implemented as a simulation model. 
ISMA/RA can be considered as a modification of ISMA/P 
[15]. The idea in ISMA/RA, as well as in ISMA/P and 
PRMA [16], is to guarantee bandwidth in multiple hops by a 
combination of random access and polling protocols, and by 
dividing the time axis into slots. The behavior of ISMA/P is 
analyzed in [17] and well understood. The TDMA approach 
for ad hoc WLAN networks is also used in HiperLAN/2, but 
the solution and performance issues (like in [18]) in 
HiperLAN are quite different from those of ISMA/RA. This 
paper offers a provably computationally secure protocol 
between base stations and other nodes combined with the 
introduced use cases of the WPSN. The introduced secure 
protocol combined with use cases of the WPSN enables the 
maximum performance at all warrior levels. 
III. 
APPLICATIONS OF UAV-BASED SENSOR NETWORKS 
The article describes three scenarios in which the WPSN 
can be utilized to maintain the initiative; namely, on the road, 
in built-up areas, including inside buildings, and, finally, 
how the Special Forces can utilize these systems [19]. 
A. Road side bomb detection 
Increased Overseas Operations present road side bombs 
as a serious concern for the friendly troops due to the road 
side bombs’ efficiency related to their unpredicted location. 
By using a solution based on the Wireless Polling Sensor 
Network, road side bombs can be detected using this new 
technology based on novel sensor data collection techniques. 
The detection procedure involves the following phases. 
Firstly, the new concept of Wireless Polling Sensor 
Network comprises fixed sensor nodes, which do not 
communicate with each other. These nodes answer to mobile 
polling if they have something to report. The mobile polling 
nodes are a swarm of pre-programmed UAVs equipped with 
homing devices. 
Secondly, the fixed nodes detect activity at the road-side, 
such as humans or large objects moving. The detection is 
based on a significant change in the electromagnetic 
spectrum, such as thermal, magnetic, or seismic change of 
the monitored area. The UAV patrols the area regularly, for 
instance, once an hour. Finally, as bombs are typically placed 
on the sites hours or days in advance, the WPSN application 
does not require real-time reporting to match the needs. 
The fixed sensor nodes do not emit electromagnetic 
radiation except when the UAV sends a polling request with 
a specific code. The static nodes use directional antennas and 
communicate directly above (in a certain angle). A Wireless 
Polling Sensor Network has an edge over a traditional 
Wireless Sensor Network, for the system will remain 
functional even if some sensor nodes have been destroyed. A 
swarm of UAVs as polling devices gives an edge to the 
system resulting in reliable data gathering as seen in Fig. 2, 
and the arrows indicate the data transmission between the 
entities, the UAVs and the sensor nodes. 
 
 
Figure 2.  The structure of the WPSN with the swarm of UAVs. 
Energy consumption in a multi-hop sensor network is 
higher than in the proposed solution since messages from 
other nodes must be relayed, and this depends on the 
placement of the nodes relative to the control point. The 
detection of the sensor nodes by the opponent is also much 
easier in a fixed multi-hop network. The WPSN has lower 
energy consumption together with better protection against 
detection, resulting in increased survivability of the network. 
The polling procedure begins with mutual authentication 
of the UAV and the sensor. After authentication stage 
information is sent in encrypted from the sensor to the UAV. 
Since the transmitting power of a sensor is low, directional 
antennas are used for securing the transmission towards the 
60

UAV. This enures the safety and QoS of transmission. The 
jamming of the system is made difficult by directional 
antennas. The system is battle-proof and answers only the 
UAV after a defined and pre-programmed identification 
protocol. 
As the signal propagation time and the message 
forwarding delay are 10 ms and 15 ms, respectively, the 
communication delay can be understood to be on an accepted 
level when a swarm of UAVs is used to collect the accrued 
sensor data [29]. Since currently neither a test-laboratory nor 
UAVs can be utilized for testing purposes, the information 
referred to in this particular section of the paper is based on a 
relevant study [29]. As explained in Section III on page 3, 
the UAVs are used in swarms of three or four in order to 
ensure maximized data gathering and the validity of the 
sensor data. Moreover, as described in Section III, reliable 
communication between a single UAV and sensors takes 
only fragments of seconds after the identification procedures. 
In this case, the altitude of the swarm of UAVs is 400 
meters. This altitude indicates that, once the angle of the 
transmitting sensor is from 5 to 7 degrees, the 
communication area at the altitude of 400 meters is at least 
33,3 meters in diameter and in maximum 46,7 meters in 
diameter. In this example the speed of a single UAV is 80 
km/h and 22 m/s allowing a UAV to receive a signal from a 
sensor for longer than a second. And again, as explained in 
[29], the signal propagation time and the message forwarding 
delay are 10 ms and 15 ms, which gives enough time for a 
single UAV to communicate with each sensor in a swarm of 
UAVs. And in case a single UAV fails to communicate with 
a sensor, another member of a swarm of UAVs can replace 
this function. When all the collected data are verified, these 
accrued data can be merged.  
The topology of network systems has to be correctly 
coordinated (i.e., managing spectrum usage with group 
mobility patterns). The hierarchy of a network has to support 
this. This can be achieved by hierarchical design where 
devices are only to interact with their peers from the same 
group [19]. This means the swarm of UAVs communicates 
in the same intra-group while the UAVs and multi-sensors 
are in an inter-group with the UAVs. This ensures the QoS 
and proper maintenance of networks. Improved network 
performance can be obtained by using more channels, 
aggregation of more packets per frame and appropriate 
channel assignment [20]. A UAV can be used as a platform 
to provide the needed services, for example, Digital Video 
Broadcast – Terrestrial [DVB-T) and Digital Video 
Broadcast –Handheld (DVB-H) [21]. 
B. Location services in urban areas 
Another interesting application of the WPSN is related to 
positioning and location services, especially in urban 
warfare. This solution is based on the Ground Positioning 
System (GPS) and the GPS-Pseudolite, better known as the 
Self-Calibrating Pseudolite Array (SCPA) [22] [8]. Studies 
indicate that the SCPA provides an effective means of 
acquiring a satellite-based Carrier-phase Differential GPS-
type (CDGPS) centimeter-level positioning in locations 
without access to the GPS satellite constellation [8]. 
An Army tactical warfighter needs network services both 
On-The-Move (OTM) and At-The-Halt (ATH) [23]. One of 
the lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan was the need 
for 
a 
more 
robust 
Beyond-Line-Of-Sight 
(BLOS) 
communication capacity between the lower Army echelon 
Land 
Warriors, 
from 
Squad 
Leaders 
to 
Battalion 
Commanders [23]. 
The SCPA technique is used in Mars Rover Navigation 
[8]. The application can be as follows: The warrior polls the 
SCPA stationed on the urban battlefield (roof-tops, 
perimeters of buildings). The warrior acts as a polling UAV 
as described in Fig. 3, and the arrows indicate the data 
transmission between the entities and the triangle-shaped 
objects represent the SCPA. 
 
 
Figure 3.  The WPSN presented in the urban infrastructure. 
The proposed and described solutions have to be based 
on novel, generic and robust battlefield-proven solutions in 
order to meet the given needs, and this in turn involves 
addressing the topology of the network system carefully. 
The novel sensor data collection techniques include: 1) 
the Development of a new networking concept: Wireless 
Polling Sensor Network, 2) A mobile ad hoc sensor network 
that can support near real-time streams, and 3) Generic SOA-
interfaces for sensors and sensor platform control. One of 
these is the medium access control (MAC) algorithm and 
protocol for ad-hoc wireless networks that employs power 
control spatial-reuse scheduling techniques [24]. The 
Networks inside the WPSN solutions have to be functional 
and communicate as seen in Fig. 4, and the arrows indicate 
the data transmission between the entities, the UAVs and the 
sensor nodes.

Figure 4.  The principle of the network topology. 
Since the power production and power consumption will 
remain as a challenge, certain actions need to be addressed. 
Thus when defining the network design, it has to be 
emphasized that network coding enables a more efficient, 
scalable and reliable wireless network [25].  
The multi-sensor system comprises (Fig. 5): 1) a control 
unit (CU) that is placed on the operational centre, 2) a 
number of sensor control units (SCUs) that form a mobile ad 
hoc sensor network capable of near real-time data transfer, 3) 
sensor platforms, such as unmanned air or land vehicles, 4) 
different types of sensors, and 5) new algorithms for multi-
sensor collaboration. 
 
 
Figure 5.  The network system of the WPSN. 
Another application in an urban environment is a multi-
hop mobile sensor network consisting of UGVs for 
investigation of buildings or placing SCPAs on a site. A 
network of a small number of such UGVs does not present 
technical problems as a small mobile ad hoc network, but it 
removes the need for a line-of-sight connection. The main 
new advantage is the addition of location mechanisms and 
pre-planned routes that are manually assisted when needed. 
C. Solution for the special forces 
The Special Forces need a precise location of a target to 
have it destroyed. Let us assume that in this example the 
selected target is heavily fortified, guarded and built of 
concrete, or buried deep in soil. The power of conventional 
weapons used by the Special Forces is not enough to destroy 
the target. Therefore, the target has to be marked for the 
bombs or guided missiles. This idea utilizes the possibilities 
of the Wireless Polling Sensor Network (WPSN), and the 
solution is based on the use of the SCPA. The idea is to set 
the SCPAs close to the selected target and measure the 
distance and direction from this specific spot at the target. 
This way the place of each SCPA is very precisely measured 
in relation to other SCPAs and the target. Once this has been 
done to each SCPA, a swarm of UAVs can be sent on their 
way to poll the SCPAs and collect the data to be transmitted 
to the destruction device for preparation purposes, if needed. 
The SCPAs do not form a network between each other, thus 
not transmitting, and they do not have a specific ground 
station. Pseudolites only answer the UAVs according to the 
communication protocol described earlier in Section III, B. 
In Fig. 6 below the arrows indicate the data transmission 
between the entities, and the question mark indicates the 
target to be destroyed. 
 
 
Figure 6.  An example of the SCPA in the use of the Special Forces. 
Once the pseudolites are set on their positions, the 
selected destruction device (in this case a fighter with an 
intelligent bomb) approaches the target at the selected 
moment and drops the bomb and dismisses the area. The 
destruction device polls the SCPAs while heading towards 
the target and, based on the collected data, the destruction 
device is being guided at its target. This protocol deletes the 
need to depend on GPS-satellites and thus gives an edge to 
gain the goals in rough and mountainous terrain, where GPS-
satellites cannot be seen all the time. Jamming the SCPAs is 
not easy, for they transmit the encrypted data only once in a 
very narrow angle (5 – 7 degrees) straight upwards and after 
the bomb has the data, it is locked to its target.  
In this paper the altitude for a swarm of UAVs has been 
defined to be 400 meters because a UAV is hard to detect or 
destroy from that altitude. Furthermore, the distance between 
the UAVs and ground-based sensors ensure reliable means 
of communication. Besides, small UAVs are relatively 
inexpensive and easy to replace which makes them an 
invaluable asset in military operations. 
D. Evaluation of the concept 
As the UAV sensor network is still on the design stage 
and no implementations can be tested, evaluation of the 
whole solution can only be based on looking at the basic 
ideas of the concept and finding its strengths and 
weaknesses. We go through some typical issues that should 
be considered for any sensor network solution.  
Offered service: The proposed WPSN solution provides 
location and targeting service, and in the road side bomb 
application continuous sensor data collection from the area. 
In the last application the solution does not give reliable 
alarms of intrusion, unlike e.g. burglar alarm systems. 
Therefore the information is likely to include many false 
positives and a rapid reaction to each sensor data item that 
might indicate an effort to plant a bomb would be 
superfluous. It is sufficient to poll the sensor nodes after a 
relatively long period of time immediately before a patrol 
tour. The solution does not assist in fast response but can 
mitigate 
the 
effects 
and 
provide 
sensor 
data 
for

demonstrating that an incidence was planned, and possibly 
an identification of the attacker if voice sensors are used.  
Coverage issues: The proposed system is suitable for 
areas so large that they cannot be easily covered by a fixed 
wireless base station, or by a WSN, and the set of sensors 
can be formed of disconnected parts, unlike in WSN. The 
use of a network of several UAVs is a clear improvement to 
the present applications where one UAV is controlled by a 
ground station and a line-of-sight connection is required. 
This limits the operational range of UAVs to roughly ten 
kilometers in open areas and prevents the use of UAVs in 
urban areas. A networked set of UAVs can increase the 
range by multi-hop routing. If one UAV has a line-of-sight 
connection to a ground station, it can forward messages to 
and from other UAVs. This requires that the MAC protocol 
supports real-time traffic. Controlling a UAV (and especially 
a number of them) through multi-hop connections is difficult 
but in the presented solution it is made possible by the sensor 
nodes: the UAVs have a pre-planned route and feedback 
information from the sensor nodes allows the UAVs to make 
corrections to their positions and to stay at the planned route. 
It is also expected that a ground based pilot can control the 
swarm of networked UAVs by steering only one of them and 
relying on suitable control protocols that keep the UAVs of 
the swarm in a fixed formation. Connectivity issues for an n-
node UAV/UGV network can appear but they are typical to 
any mobile ad hoc network (MANET). In the case of WPSN, 
connectivity problems of the MANET are minor since the 
UAV/UGV nodes follow pre-assigned paths and the number 
n of nodes is small. Connectivity issues between the 
UAV/UGV and sensor nodes determine how strictly the 
UAV/UGV must follow the pre-assigned path but this 
restriction can be avoided by increasing the altitude of the 
UAV. From a sufficient altitude the UAV can receive data 
from all ground sensors.   
Operational limitations: The most important restriction 
to the system is caused by weather conditions, which do not 
always allow the use of UAVs but this limitation is not seen 
as a major argument against the solution. The polling device 
could of course also be a ground-based vehicle avoiding the 
weather dependence. There is an advantage in using an UAV 
since camera picture from an UAV can often give a probable 
reason e.g. why a sensor node is not communicating. The 
solution requires usage of planned routes. There can 
naturally be many alternative planned routes. The concept 
does not in any way require that all sensor nodes must be 
polled in any specific order.  
Performance issues: Performance evaluation of the 
whole system is not presented in this article since there are 
no real-life experiments so far. We can describe the main 
performance issues. Traffic congestion problems cannot 
appear in the system: the UAV/UGV makes the round e.g. 
every hour and collects sensor data from a relatively small 
number of sensors.      
Dependability issues: The WSPN network cannot be 
easily disabled by removal or blocking of some nodes, as is 
the case for a WSN in essentially one-dimensional areas, 
such as a road where one parked truck may disconnect the 
WSN. A problem of a malicious network node unwilling to 
transfer data of other nodes does not occur since the sensor 
nodes communicate only with the polling network, which 
can be assumed secure. Unauthorized removal of sensor 
nodes is interpreted as a signal of undesired activity. There 
are ways to protect the sensor nodes against efforts to break 
the security algorithms protecting their communication with 
the polling nodes, e.g. by self-destruction, even if there is 
physical access to the sensor nodes. The sensor nodes should 
be difficult to find, otherwise they may be stolen. The 
communication mode of replying only to the polling node 
request makes the nodes difficult to find by electro-magnetic 
sensors.  
Energy issues: Polling is in general considered a less 
efficient communication method than generating events from 
incidences, since many nodes have nothing to report. In the 
road-side bomb application there are some factors that 
change this conclusion. It is desirable to get a stay-alive 
announcement from each sensor in any case; therefore it is 
not sufficient to generate events only if something suspicious 
happens. The time to poll the sensor nodes is negligible 
compared to the time the polling UAV needs for the round 
trip for physical reasons, so polling is not slower in this case. 
The energy constraints in the UAV are not a limiting factor. 
It is of course possible to create a hierarchical sensor node 
structure where only some nodes communicate with the 
polling nodes while the other nodes report events to the 
communicating node. However, some robustness is lost in 
the hierarchical model. The polling network concept has a 
clear advantage in networks that are essentially one-
dimensional, like a road side: a WSN node must pass 
messages created by other nodes; consequently its energy 
usage cannot be well predicted. In the WSPN solution 
energy usage can be well estimated and it is more important 
to have a good estimate of the battery life-time than a 
maximal prolongation of sensor operational time between 
battery recharge. The same patrol routes are not used for 
years, nor do the sensor nodes need to last for years without 
recharging. The energy needed to communicate with the 
polling node is not negligible, but especially as the 
communication is in free space, it is not assumed to be a 
limiting factor for the sensor node batteries. Sufficiency of 
energy in ground-based sensors and in UAV/UGV nodes is a 
limitation but the sensor nodes do not need to be especially 
small in this application.  
Technology development: A proposed technological 
solution should have characteristics that make it more future-
proof. The WSPN solution is open to development of sensor 
techniques. It may be possible in the near future to detect 
threats better from sensor data, e.g., to distinguish between a 
deer and a walking human. Applications of unmanned 
vehicles to military and crisis management situations are also 
a fast developing area. Ad hoc sensor networks have on the 
other hand met with certain scalability problems. A simple 
polling network concept seems to give future promises.  A 
military system should be flexible enough to have a range of 
usages. While the WSPN concept has been created for the 
current need in road-side bomb detection, the system has 
other applications e.g. in location finding and in targeting.

Possible applications: The road side bomb detection is 
the main application. There is a current need for it and the 
existing methods, i.e., disabling communication to an IED by 
jamming, and surveillance by UAVs, are inadequate. The use 
of WPSN for targeting instead of GPS has some advantages 
and disadvantages. It is vulnerable to ground-based jamming 
but on the other hand, the frequency can be selected from a 
wider range. Location service in urban area is a much studied 
but difficult issue. The proposed system may be a partial 
solution. 
IV. 
A PROVABLY COMPUTATIONALLY SECURE  
PROTOCOL BETWEEN BASE STATIONS AND OTHER NODES 
In the case of UAVs and other easily captured nodes 
there is a special disadvantage in using ordinary crypto 
algorithms requiring stored key.  There is also no time and 
no computing power for asymmetric algorithms.  We will 
give a solution to this problem by novel idea of exchanging 
One-Time Pads and encrypting data with one of the OTPs. 
The other OTP must be discarded for security reasons. 
A. Basic idea of the crypto-algorithm 
One-time pad (OTP), or Vernam’s cipher, is a crypto 
algorithm where the key is as long as the plain text. The 
modern version of the algorithm simply takes a bitwise 
exclusive or of the key and the plain text. Denoting exclusive 
or by ⊗ , the key K  by a sequence of symbols 
Ki i
K
)
= (
, and plaintext by 
iA i
A
)
= (
, the cryptotext in 
OTP is 
i i
i
K
A
K
A
X
)
(
⊗
=
⊗
=
. OTP has perfect 
security because even if all keys are tried, it is not possible to 
break OTP: for any plain text there always exists a key that 
encrypts the plain text to the observed crypto text. OTP has 
only one problem, as the keys are very long, there is no 
convenient way to transfer keys to the sides in 
communication.  
In this article we describe a simple method of exchanging 
OTP keys in such a way that we obtain a method with 
provable computational security. We will briefly explain the 
method. If A and B are two users and A wants to send data 
A  to B, let us first assume that A and B have exchanged 
their OTP keys 
K A
 and 
KB
 in such a way that an attacker 
can see 
B
A
K
K
⊗
. If A sends 
K A ⊗ A
, the attacker can 
only get  
A

and cannot open the plain text A . This method would 
have perfect security, but we cannot exchange the OTP keys 
quite as well as here. The proposed method shows to the 
attacker 
B i i
A i
K
K
)
(
,
, ⊗
  and 
k i
B i
A i
K
K
)
(
,
,
+
⊗
 
for some fixed k . Using this relation the attacker can 
guess one symbol 
A i
K , and calculate the symbol 
K A i k
, +
. 
Thus, we have only computational complexity. However, if 
the attacker can only guess half of the bits in one symbol, he 
does not gain any information of the next symbol. Indeed, let 
A i
K ,  be divided into two disjoint sets of bits C  and D  
and C  is guessed, D  is unknown. We can try to guess a set 
E  of bits from
K A i k
, +
. The remaining set of bits in 
K A i k
, +
 is denoted by F . The set C  has at most half of 
the bits in a symbol and we cannot obtain more bits to E  
than there are in C . It turns out that the bits of E  can be 
assigned any values and there always exist D  and F  such 
that E  has the assigned values. Thus, guessing E  in this 
way is not possible. There is another way to proceed: when 
C  is guessed we can open a part of plain text
iA . If the 
plain text has internal correlations between bits, then we can 
try to guess the bits D . The proposed solution is that A  is 
cryptotext of a conventional symmetric cipher which hides 
statistical correlation. This cipher cannot be broken because 
the cryptotext of the cipher is not seen. The attacker only 
sees the cryptotext xored by the OTP. The attacker can go 
through all keys of the symmetric cipher and guess the plain 
text, but this can be made harder than directly guessing the 
OTP symbol. This leaves guessing at least half of the OTP 
symbol as the only effective approach. The actual method is 
a bit more complicated than this simple idea and will be 
described later.      
The proposed method requires sending three times as 
much data as a conventional symmetric cipher: exchanging 
the OTPs is necessary. Computation time is not necessarily 
increased and xoring is a fast operation.  While there today 
exist good ciphers for which there are no effective attacks, 
there are reasons for searching for algorithms based on OTP 
exchange. One reason is that currently there are very few 
good crypto-algorithms, second is that algorithms based on 
hard mathematical problems invite mathematicians to try to 
break them and we do not know how long the algorithms 
stand. The third reason is that symmetric ciphers require 
storing the keys, so if a node holding a key is lost, security 
can be broken. 
B. Related work 
Exchanging 
OTPs 
as 
a 
method 
of 
provable 
computational security has not been proposed earlier to the 
author’s best knowledge. There is no direct related work but 
the idea has been taken from Simon Singh’s popular science 
book [28], on page 282 Singh mentions an algorithm, which 
we have drawn in Figure 1. Singh attributes it to an 
unknown inventor. To the authors’ knowledge it has not 
been discussed in scientific literature, which is odd since the 
algorithm is quite interesting: only B  needs to know the 
one-time pad. Let us look at it and later fix the problem it 
has. 
Let r  be a prime and we will use integers modulo r , 
i.e., not bits, as symbols in the following crypto algorithms.

The task is to get the key to both sides. Let us first consider 
an algorithm where A  sends data 
D(t)
 to B  over a two-
way additive channel. A  sends the data in plain text and B  
sends a one-time pad 
K(t)
 to A . Let us assume that the 
end-to-end delay is T  symbols, see Figure 7.

The real number 
β j > 0
 gives the difference in signal 
strength of the signal from  A  and from B  at the place j  
of the eaves-dropper. The fault of the protocol is that if the 
eaves-dropper listens in two places, j  and i , and in two 
times 1t , 2t
, he can subtract the signals and get the data. 
Let the times be chosen such that

Thus, the algorithm in Figure 1 has a serious flaw. 
However, to some extent the problem can be removed: in 
order to get a secure algorithm A  must send both the data 
and the key. As a way to get the key to A  let us first think of 
sending it in plain text in a channel consisting of separate up-
link and down-link channels as in Figure 8. 
 
 
Figure 8.  Better, but the key goes in plain text. 
A  echoes the OTP from B  back to B . Now A  learns 
the one-time pad of B . On the down-link we have the OTP, 
so it is secure. Let us secure the up-link by another one-time 
pad, this pad is created by A . For clarity, let us denote the 
OTP created by B  by

He cannot gain anything from listening in two places as 
signal strengths attenuate in the same way for the two 
parameters of the function g , it suffices to look at different 
times he reads data. Here we also do not need to assume that 
the channel is additive. The channel adds noise and 
distortion, but these issues are not of concern to us now. We 
focus on the cryptographic algorithm and assume that the 
channel has not errors or distortion. The eaves-dropper can 
read the up-link and the down-link in different times and try 
to solve the keys recursively. Let

By guessing

the first (up) equation because A  can also do it.  Having 
obtained

Thus, if there are unique solutions

dropper can obtain the whole one-time pads.  
Let us firstly notice that values k
x , 
k
y  that agree with 
what the eaves-dropper is listening can be computed for 
every guess 1
y . As the algorithm treats all  
k
x , 
k
y  in the 
same way, the eaves-dropper might just as well start from 
guessing any 
k
x  or 
k
y . The important thing is that he does 
not get any more information from this OTP exchange 
protocol. If he wants to know if his guess is correct, he must 
compute some values

Perfect security of OTP does not any more hold. The first 
symbol may decode to anything depending on the guess of 
)1(

 but already at the second symbol the eaves-dropper 
may notice that data does not decode to some sensible data. 
The important question is if the eaves-dropper has any better 
way than guessing one key symbol or a large part of it. We 
can naturally select the symbol length in bits in such a way 
that guessing one symbol or a large part of it by brute force 
is sufficiently difficult.  
If any faster way for the eaves-dropper exists depends 
largely on the function g . Let us select the function as

x  and b
x . The eaves-dropper can check if the bits in 
a
x  are decoded into sensible data in the data sent by B . As 
B  encrypts with OTP, there exists key bits a
x  that decode 
the encrypted data into any selected data. The eaves-dropper 
must try to compute y by solving  
 
( , )
e = g y x
.  
 
 
 
    (20) 
 
After obtaining the key symbol y  the eaves-dropper can 
decrypt data encoded by A . If also some bits of data 
encrypted by A  are sensible the eaves-dropper may try to 
conclude that he has made the correct guess of the bits a
x . 
If he can obtain all bits of x  in this way, he has a method of 
effective crypto-analysis, but if he must guess a large part of 
x  before he can conclude that the guess is correct, he needs 
a good guess before (15)-(16) can be used. Let us show that 
the latter case is true. The following theorem says that more 
than half of bits in a symbol x  must be guessed before it is 
possible to test if the guess is correct.

determined by

can be satisfied for almost any selection of

From Theorem l we notice that unless the eaves-dropper 
can guess more than half of the bits in a symbol he cannot 
conclude anything by checking decrypted data. Even if the 
bits decrypted by 
a
x  and 
a
y  make sense, it does not mean 
anything at all. Just as in OTP, any sensible data for these 
bits can be obtained from some selection of  
a
x  and 
a
y  . 
Only if the eaves-dropper can guess more than half of the 
bits of a symbol, then b
x  and 
b
y  have only a limited range 
and z  in the proof of Theorem 1 cannot be found. Then the 
equation 
( , )
e = g y x
 is usually not satisfied for any 
selected 
a
x  and such 
a
y , that the data sent by A  makes 
sense. We conclude that the algorithm has in a certain sense 
provable computational complexity of 
2n / 2
 trials.  
A provable lower bound of 
2n / 2
 trials by brute force 
would be much better than the situation with conventional 
stream ciphers. While there has been recent progress in 
stream cipher design, new crypto-analytic methods can still 
be developed. The reason why the OTP exchange protocol 
could be better than modern stream ciphers is partly due to 
the fact that an algorithm encrypting real data must remove 
the structure of the data. The OTP exchange protocol is

International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 4 no 1 & 2, year 2011, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/

encrypting random keys that do not have a structure.  Partly 
the reason is that real data is encrypted with one-time pads 
that do not try to remove the structure from the data: they 
simply make every possible decoding of the data equally 
probable.  
However, Theorem 1 does not quite say that there is a 
lower bound of 
2 n / 2
 trials by brute force. There are two 
possible ways of attack. In the first way the attacker may try 
to guess the correct 
xa
 and check it by decrypting data 
encrypted by OTP. As every key symbol is randomly 
selected, the correct 
a
x  is random and by Theorem 1 there 
is practically no chance that the attacker can gain anything 
unless a
x  has more than half of the bits in a symbol. The 
only choice in this attack is to guess 
a
x  by brute force.  
The second way is that the attacker guesses data 
encrypted by OTP and computes the key symbols from the 
guessed data and the encrypted data. Then he checks if (15)-
(16) is satisfied. This attack works well if plain text is 
encrypted. For instance, if any part of a text that has been 
encrypted by OTP is revealed and the encrypted data of the 
corresponding key exchange is obtained, it is a simple matter 
to open all text that has been encrypted with the OTP. 
Possible attacks include searching for published documents 
that have been encrypted by OTP. This is similar to the way 
the Japanese diplomat cipher was broken in the Second 
World War. The attack does not break the OTP system, but 
all other texts that are encrypted by the same OTP are 
broken. Another attack is searching for common long 
phrases. If the symbol length is 256 bits, the phrase must be 
longer than 128 bits, i.e., 16 bytes. Such are relatively long 
phrases, but not impossible to find in text. Then the attacker 
must search for the correct starting place, which is relatively 
easy. Such old style attacks work against OTP since OTP 
does not use diffusion and confusion: if plain text and 
encrypted text pairs are obtained, the key is immediately 
revealed. It is of no concern in OTP as keys are not reused 
but the dependences (15)-(16) of the OTP exchange make 
the property extremely dangerous. 
The correction seems to be to encrypt plain text first with 
some good symmetric cipher and then use OTP. The 
symmetric cipher must be so good that guessing what crypto 
text some plain text produces is very difficult. The OTP 
hides all information of the crypto text produced by the 
symmetric cipher, thus the attacker does not have crypto text. 
The relations (15)-(16) do not mean that there are relations 
between the parts of the OTP. The OTP is a completely valid 
OTP where no symbols have any correlations with each 
other or with the text that they encrypt. Without any 
information of crypto text he does not have any information 
that has a relation to the key of the symmetric cipher, thus he 
cannot recover the key. We conclude that the attack of 
guessing the plain text is not possible for information 
theoretical reasons. The only remaining attack is to guess 
xa
 by brute force. This is naturally much less than the 
original perfect security but it is quite good for a more 
practical system than plain OTP.

Let us look briefly at another possibility. We may allow 
non-unique values for 
k
x , 
k
y . It does not make decoding 
data especially harder, the decoder must at each stage select 
from two values. As an example of such a possibility let us

The quadratic equation can be rather fast solved by the 
Shank-Tonelli Algorithm. (A rather fast free C-language 
implementation of the Shank-Tonelli Algorithm is in the 
msieve factorization software by J. Papadopoulos.)  
The eaves-dropper must solve the values 
xk
, 
k
y  
recursively and he may have to keep trace of all paths for a 
small number of steps before he can decide if data can be 
decoded. This method may be suitable for an application 
where the symbol is small and the eaves-dropper cannot 
decide from a small umber of symbols if he has found the 
solution. We will not study this possibility further. There are 
several complications, such as quadratic non-residues, but it 
may be worth the mention the possibility of non-unique 
keys.        
OTP exchange provides provably secure communications 
with some cost, i.e., bandwidth demands are increased. A 
conventional way to provide secure communication is e.g. by 
using the Diffie-Hellmann key exchange protocol for 
establishing a shared encryption key, and then encrypting 
data with a conventional symmetric algorithm. The gain of 
using OTP exchange is that it cannot be eavesdropped as it is 
provably computationally secure, and we can better estimate 
when and if it can be broken. Experiences from real wars, for 
instance with Enigma in the WWII, has shown that militaries 
should not trust conventional wisdom of how difficult 
encryption algorithms are to break.

D. Initializing OTP exchange 
The protocol in Figure 3 must be started in some way so 
that key symbols are not revealed to an eaves-dropper at the 
start. A simple solution is that before A  has obtained any 
part of the B ’s OTP, it encrypts data with A ’s credentials 
that must be known to B . The credentials must be long 
enough for encrypting T first symbols from A ’s OTP, a 
time stamp and a sequence number. The latter fields are 
needed to prevent replay of the start of communication. In a 
similar way, B  also needs credentials known to A . Notice 
that (15)-(16) can be used backwards. If OTP encrypts plain 
text that can be guessed, user credentials are revealed. 
Therefore, plain text encrypted with OTP must be first 
encrypted with a conventional cipher. 
E. Comments on error coding 
OTP has good error propagation characteristics: one 
erroneous bit in crypto text only causes one erroneous bit in 
the plain text. Error coding data before encrypting is a 
possible solution because of small error propagation. OTP 
exchange has more worries from errors. If any error occurs 
in transmission from A  to B , B  gets a wrong key symbol 
K A(t)
 and consequently encrypts its own key symbols 
with wrong 
K A(t)
. Consequently, A  obtains wrong 
KB (t)
 and uses it to encrypt key symbols. Neither side 
notices anything wrong while A  and B obtain quite 
different versions of  
K A(t)
 and  
KB (t)
. As a result, 
data cannot be decrypted. Adding error codes to key symbols 
leads to dependences between key symbols and should be 
avoided. Therefore 
Eup (t)
 and 
Edown (t)
 must be 
extended by error coding. It is not necessarily best to use 
forward error coding since there is the return channel. 
F. The issue of synchronization 
The OTP exchange protocol needs the time T . Time 
synchronization in the protocol does not need any external 
protocol for synchronizing clocks. Both sides receive the 
OTP that they have sent and can synchronize to it with the 
ordinary HUNT mode, i.e., looking for the known bit 
sequence. This ability of the protocol can be used by other 
mechanisms. It directly gives the roundtrip delay from A  
to B . The round-trip delay can give location information e.g. 
if one of the sides is in a known place and the 
communication is through a communication satellite that 
does not add a time stamp. 
G. Generation of key sequences 
It might appear that one-time pads do not have any great 
advantage over ordinary stream ciphers since OTPs are 
usually generated by pseudo-random number generators. 
This is a wrong view. A typical stream cipher is essentially a 
pseudo random number generator but it has finite data as 
keys and possible other agreed parameters. Because this data 
is finite, the pseudo random sequence is finite. If an attacker 
collects enough data and keys are not changed often enough, 
he can take advantage of this periodicity. In the proposed 
method the OTP is not periodic. The OTPs of A  and B  are 
independent and created by A  and B  respectively. The 
other side learns the OTP through the OTP exchange. Even 
though the key symbols in the OTPs are probably created by 
pseudo random number generators, their parameters can be 
modified over time without the need of agreeing on them. 
Thus, the data is not finite as it must be in conventional 
stream ciphers. 
V. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This article suggests that viable methods exist, which 
improve the C4I2 of a warrior at all the levels. The examples 
covered are based on use cases of WPSN-solutions. They 
indicate that a warrior can obtain more critical information 
on the battlefield by using the presented WPSN solutions. 
This improves the general efficiency of a warrior at all 
levels. The platforms used today on the battlefield are not 
efficient. This is because they are based on a single sensor 
and they do not collect data in a way that would allow 
collaboration of multiple sensors. The proposed solution 
makes use of multi-sensor collaboration for improved 
location information and better situation awareness.  
A warrior has to be functional and his gear needs to be 
planned according to the task. A key factor is the efficiency 
of a warrior, which can be gained via an improved 
Situational Awareness (SA), Blue Force Tracking (BFT) and 
Command and Control systems (C4I2). A warrior has to 
maintain his or her agility and stay active on the battlefield; 
all the gear cannot be attached. 
Thus the warrior skeleton and its communication systems 
need to be carefully defined and built at each level due to the 
task requirements. Currently, the present solutions seen in 
active use are cumbersome and lack integration. The WPSN-
solutions are unseen in these platforms. The maximum 
potential remains unreachable without sensor and data 
fusion. Militaries are moving towards smaller units while the 
demands keep increasing. At the same time troops are 
created for dismounted operations where a greater degree of 
flexibility and reliability of battle-proof and robust systems 
are needed. 
The article discusses typical scenarios in which the 
WPSN can be invaluable. The effect of roadside bombs can 
be avoided once their precise location is known early and 
precisely enough. The increased knowledge at the basic 
warrior level in the form of location information gained from 
the SCPA on the battlefield improves the warrior’s ability to 
carry out the task. Roadside bombs can be detected early 
enough and dismantled or destroyed before own or allied 
forces arrive at the spot. The Special Forces utilize the same 
output of the SCPA while conducting their ultimate tasks. 
Since the nodes of the WPSN do not communicate with each 
other, the system remains concealed, yet active. The WPSN 
node communicates with the UAV through encrypted 
messages. Thus the WPSN responds only after the UAV has

submitted a polling request with a specific code. Utilizing 
swarms of UAVs and UGVs has to be emphasized. The 
routes of Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) can be fed into the 
systems early enough to gain the needed information from 
the designated areas. 
The WPSN-solution features many advantages over those 
of the traditional WSNs. This is, polling can use sensor 
specific codes and thereby security issues become easier to 
tackle. Moreover, energy consumption of the nodes in the 
fixed network is more equal since multi-hop data 
transmission is removed. The fixed sensor nodes do not lose 
connectivity even if a large number of nodes are removed.  
As demonstrated via the presented use cases, WPSN 
solutions together with SCPAs and UVs can be utilized to 
reach the maximum performance at all warrior levels. 
Planning the warrior’s gear requires a deep understanding of 
the environment and the demands set on a warrior. The 
warrior’s niche and the nature of his or her missions have to 
be thoroughly understood. The keys to success can be found 
in precise planning based on the needs of warrior systems 
and subsystems from bottom to top.
