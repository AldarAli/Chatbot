Abstract—Currently, the technological evolution has led to the
birth of the image processing discipline which processes and
analyzes images in different fields including marine image
processing. Identifying a dolphin from a picture which has sea
feature is difficult because the background of the picture is
complex and has some similarities with the target. For this
reason,
we
make
a
thorough
research
on
the
target
segmentation and the existing identification algorithms used to
solve this problem. In this paper, we will present a new
segmentation algorithm based on clustering threshold in the
RGB color space to process dolphin images. We will combine it
with the SIFT algorithm for image post-processing feature
extraction. Then we will present how to build a dolphin growth
model to identify a dolphin.

INTRODUCTION
In digital image processing, it is desired that the machine
recognition is capable of recognizing the object effectively
from the complicated image and make a judgment, same as
the human eye
discriminates. Therefore, research and
application of image segmentation technology and image
recognition technology are very significant. Now, image
recognition technology has been applied in more and more
fields, such as face recognition, medical image processing
and ocean image processing. We are interested in the
application
of
the
image
recognition
technology
in
recognizing dolphins.
Dolphins are some of the world's animals that are at risk
of extinction. When wild dolphins’ conservation experts
study the wild dolphin colonies, they often estimate the age
of dolphins by the artificial method. The method is that they
need to compare the photographs one by one to estimate the
age and distinguish individual dolphins according to the
characteristics of the surface of dolphins. For experienced
maritime workers, the correct rate of recognition of dolphin
is relatively high. However, in order to distinguish the
dolphins accurately, young marine workers need to take a lot
of time to learn. The artificial recognition method has a big
workload and high error rate. Therefore, we need to explore
a new method of image recognition to solve these problems.
Ma Yan et al. [1] proposed a new algorithm for automatic
object segmentation in different color space. Gondra et al. [3]
proposed a target segmentation algorithm based on machine
learning. The gray image segmentation is highly efficient.
The color image segmentation splits the image from different
color spaces. Lowe [5][6] proposes a SIFT feature extraction
algorithm with scale invariance. This algorithm is relatively
stable in feature extraction and it can effectively deal with
affine transformation and perspective transformation.
Each dolphin has its own characteristics, which can be
used to distinguish different dolphins. In this paper, we
improved the commonly used target segmentation algorithm
and the identification algorithm and apply it to the field of
dolphin image identification. We will present how to
distinguish the identity of the dolphins through image
recognition technology. We will present how to establish the
identification model and the growth model of dolphins based
on the surface characteristics of dolphins. We will also
present an automatic management process of dolphins’
image.
In Section 2, we will analyze dolphins target image
segmentation.
In
Section
3,
we
will
present
image
preprocessing and SIFT feature-matching algorithm. In
Section 4, we will present our growth model. In Section 5,
we will illustrate our experiments.

DOLPHINS TARGET IMAGE SEGMENTATION
In this paper, we need to segment the dolphins’ targets
from the background of sea image. However, there are a lot
of waves on the ocean surface, which can lead to incorrect
segmentation results. The color image segmentation divides
the image from different color spaces, as in [3][4]. The
image may be an image composed of multiple complex
images, and the gray image segmentation may not divide the
image, as in [1][2]. In this paper, we will propose two
methods of using the color image segmentation:

1)
Color image target segmentation;
2)
Manual target segmentation.
The color image target segmentation technology uses an
average clustering method. The dolphin image background is
seen as a category and the dolphin target as another category.
We used fuzzy C-means clustering methods to separate the
dolphin image from the original color image. Then we
obtained the dolphins’ image target.
The implementation of the specific steps is as follows:
3)
Determine the clustering center;
4)
Adaptively
determine
the
clustering
center
and
classify the dolphins image according to the clustering
strategy: sea background as class Ⅰ and dolphins target as
class Ⅱ;
5)
Separate class Ⅰ from the dolphin in the image to
obtain the dolphins of target class Ⅱ.
We use the distribution of RGB color components as the
scope of clustering in Figure 1. The integer value range of
RGB three components is from 0 to 255. These points are
contained within a quarter of the ball whose radius is 255; in
Figure 1, the ordinate represents G component, the abscissa
represents R component. Dolphin image pixel range is in the
black line and blue line around the area. The scope of pixels
of the water is in the red line and green line around the area.

distances of each sampling matrix and the result is as follows:

After calculating the Euclidean distance of all the pixels
in the image, and comparing it with the clustering range, we
regard the area within the scope as the sea background and
the pixel is set to 0; the area that is beyond the scope is to
keep the original pixel distribution. The results are shown in
Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Image using color segmentation algorithm
Manual segmentation is done by manipulating the mouse
on the image, as shown in Figure 3. The blue line in Figure
3a is the route of the mouse in manual segmentation. Figure
3b is the goal and Figure 3c is the result after the image
segmentation. The steps of manual target segmentation are:
Firstly, mark the needed segmented regions, and set the
pixels of the image in the area to 1, the pixels of other areas
of the image to 0. Then the template image of Figure 3b is
obtained. Secondly, the result of the template image and
original image multiplication is the target image after
segmentation.
Figure 3.
Manual target segmentation
Automatic target segmentation is more effective and has
fewer human errors. But if the image quality is low and it

needs higher segmentation precision, it is better to use
manual target segmentation.

IMAGE PREPROCESSING AND SIFT FEATURE
MATCHING ALGORITHM
In this section, we obtain the distribution of the spots on
the surface of dolphins by image preprocessing, and then we
can calculate these spots and establish the growth model of
dolphins.
A. Image pre-processing phase
The spots on the surface of the dolphin are the feature
points of the dolphin identification. The spots on the surface
of the dolphin are dense and vary in size, which will increase
computation of spots extraction, and produce errors easily.
So we have taken three steps to preprocess: remove the edge;
spot inflation; spot polymerization.
In this paper, we used Prewitt edge detection algorithm to
process the dolphin image that has been segmented, and
accurately detected the dolphins’ surface spots edge. At the
same time, manual segmentation region contour edge was
detected.
These
contours
can
produce
unnecessary
interference to identify the effect, so it needs to be removed.
We used 5*5 square matrix corrosion structure elements.
The target shape of the corrosion has not been changed, and
the image edge was removed.
Now, the dolphins’ surface spots are accurately marked
out. However, the spots very in size and are unevenly
distributed, which makes the statistics and identification
prone to error. We carry out the result by expansion
processing these spots, and make some small spots together,
as a new feature point. The structural elements of expansion
which we use is:

. We carried out on the spots three
times in the expansion operation.
We can see from the picture that small spots formed
together big spots, and features are more obvious.
B. SIFT feature matching algorithm
SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) features keep
the invariance to image scaling, rotation, scale brightness
unchanged, which is a very stable local l feature, as in [7],
thus has very extensive application value.
SIFT feature matching algorithm is used to identify the
matching function that can be divided into three phases. The
first stage is the feature point detection. Extract all of the
images for matching feature points. The second stage is the
feature descriptor. Add a detailed description for the local
feature of the extracted feature points. The third stage is to
generate the feature vector and feature vector match. Find
out the mutual matching feature points by comparing the
original image and the target image feature points, thus we
could establish the corresponding relationship between
objects.
We have found the key points and have given them
position, scale and direction information. However, we need
a special set of key vector to describe the key points of the
image and the key points that include not only the key, but
also include the pixels around the key points for its
contributions. Descriptor will be used as the basis of target
matching.
We took the 8 * 8 window centered on key points. The
squares of window are divided into groups with size of 4 * 4,
using statistical methods to obtain the gradient direction and
gradient magnitude in each group. In the end, the gradient
and direction of these different groups form a set of vectors.
This group can be used to describe the key point and the
descriptor. Being generated according to pixel of the key
points in the field, the descriptors have strong inhibition to
noise.

GROWTH MODEL
Jefferson et al. [8] had proposed to divide the Chinese
white dolphin into six age groups, but the boundary was not
clear. It was also not clear how to represent the ages. The
recognition criteria are shown in table I according to the
different age paragraphs.
TABLE I.

childhood and early youth
childhood skin color is dark gray, no spots,
body length smaller, body length is about 1/3
to 1/2 of adult; early youth individuals is
grey or light grey, and occasionally has dark
spots, and is significantly greater than
childhood, body length is about two-thirds of
the adult.

The change of Chinese white dolphins’ spots and the
change rule of age are shown in Figure 4. The horizontal axis
is the dolphins’ age, unit is the month. The vertical axis is the
number of feature points of the dolphins’ image detected.
Figure 4.
Dolphins spots variation
We can see that from born to 20 months old, the number
of the dolphins’ surface spots are sparse, and with the
passage of time, the number of spots gradually increased.
However, when dolphins are teenagers, there will be a
substantial increase in growth of the number of spots. When
the number of dolphins’ surface spots reached a peak, the
number of spots will decline rapidly. In the end, the spots of
38

dolphins disappear or there are only a few spots, which is the
sign of the maturation of the dolphin. So we can complete
statistics of dolphins’ age through statistics of the number of
their surface spots. But among the spots on the surface of the
dolphins, some are big and some are small. Therefore, we
expand the small spots in the image. The spots shape
characteristics are not changed when the small spots get
together. The size and number of the spots on the surface of
a dolphin are both the mark of a dolphin's age and identity.
For the experimental part, we used 190 dolphin images
provided by the Pearl River estuary Dolphin Conservation
base. 100 images are randomly selected from these images.
Then the selected images are processed automatically by
object segmentation, image preprocessing, and feature point
extraction.
Thus
their
feature
points
distributions
are
obtained, and then we obtain the images corresponding to
their age. The results are shown in Figure 5 which is the age
distribution of dolphins.
Figure 5.
The age distribution of dolphins
There are three conclusions in Figure 5.
1)
When the age of the dolphin is between 0 to 12
months old, the number of the key points detected on the
dolphin's surface is between 200 and 760.
2)
When the age of the dolphin is between 15 to 38
months old, the number of the key points detected on the
dolphin's surface is between 800 and 1200.
3)
When the dolphin's age is greater than 40 months,
the number of the key points detected on the dolphin's
surface is between 0 and 200.
V.
EXPERIMENTS
In this paper, we used 190 images of the White Dolphin
after artificial classification. Each image is attached with the
age information. We use 90 images as the experimental
object to verify the accuracy of the dolphins’ growth model.
90 images were processed in order to extract the feature
points, and to determine the age of dolphins according to the
number of feature points. The results were compared with
the results of the dolphin protection workers. Through the
experiment, the correct rate using dolphins’ growth model to
estimate the age of the dolphins was 85%, the remaining
15% of the error rate is because there are some waves in the
dolphins’ image covering the key points. However, due to
the high transparency of the waves, the human eye can see
the spots on the surface of the dolphins through the spray,
and identify the dolphin's age.
The matching strategy judges the dolphin's identity
through
key
points.
The
dolphin’s
image
matching
experiment can be divided into three groups: normal image
matching experiment, partial occlusion experiment, and
rotating image experiment. Supposing the number of key
points detected in the input image is M, the key points
number of template is N, the number of the key to
successfully match is K, and the matching rate is  .

The matching rate of the experimental result was 80%.
After more than three sets of experiments, it can be
shown when the rotation, occlusion and other factors
influence the image; the recognition rate is still higher than
60%. SIFT feature extraction algorithm is very effective in
the use of dolphin identification.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied the dolphin image
segmentation, the image preprocessing, and key point
detection. Then, we summed up the relationship between the
key quantity and dolphin age, and the dolphin growth model.
Through the experiment, we used a dolphin growth model to
estimate the age of the dolphins and the correct rate was 85%.
Finally, the key points can be used to accurately describe the
characteristics of the image. The accuracy of the dolphin
matching is measured, and the accuracy rate is above 60%.
In this paper, the growth model of dolphins established by
key points can estimate the age of dolphins by the number of
key points. But when the part of the key points of dolphins’
surface are covered, the result is not accurate. In the future,
we will study how to use probability estimation to estimate
the dolphin's age when the key points of the dolphin are
covered.
