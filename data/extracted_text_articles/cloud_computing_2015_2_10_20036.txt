Abstract— Optical network virtualization has recently been 
studied extensively as a promising solution to share physical 
infrastructure 
resources 
among 
different 
users 
and 
applications. Virtual network embedding over elastic optical 
networks has recently attracted massive attentions as a 
promising solution to realize fine-grained flexibility in resource 
provisioning. Variation of bandwidth requirements associated 
with virtual network requests accompanied by nondeterministic 
nature in arrival and holding times of them result in 
fragmentation of spectral blocks along both frequency and 
spatial directions. Spectral fragmentation refrains commitment 
to spectrum contiguity and spectrum continuity constraints in 
lightpath establishment thereby severely exacerbate blocking 
probability, as well as spectrum utilization. Fragmentation-
aware routing and spectrum assignment problem has been 
extensively studied in the context of elastic optical network 
provisioning. These schemes, however, cannot be applied to 
virtual network embedding since we cannot refer to routing and 
spectrum assignment problem to implement virtual link 
mapping without regard to virtual node mapping. Therefore, in 
this paper, an integer linear programming formulation for 
fragmentation-aware 
virtual 
network 
embedding 
was 
developed for the first time to our knowledge. Numerical 
simulations for three different scenarios were carried on and 
demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms the 
previous work over a wide range of offered traffic loads under 
the same conditions.

load-balancing; VONE 
I. INTRODUCTION  
    Optical networks are evolving from a fixed International 
Telegraph 
Union-Telecommunication 
(ITU-T) 
Dense 
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) wavelength 
grid to a flexible grid in which the optical spectrum is divided 
into smaller Frequency Slots (FSs) with 6.25 or 12.5 GHz 
width each. In such a flexible grid or Elastic Optical Network 
(EON), resources are assigned by matching resource 
requirements of connection requests and the necessary 
number of FSs. The flexible use of the spectrum grid enabled 
by EONs promotes a more efficient and adaptable use of 
networks resources. However, the setup and release of 
connections in a dynamic network scenario can create gaps 
in the optical spectrum, which sizes in terms of the number 
of FSs may not be sufficient to accommodate an incoming 
connection request, causing what is known as the 
fragmentation problem. The spectrum fragmentation problem 
may lead to inefficient resource utilization and a high 
blocking probability [1]. A Virtual Optical Network 
Embedding (VONE), generally, consists of two stages, node 
mapping and link mapping, because of the complexity 
originated from correlation between these two stages, we 
brought it up in Integer Linear Programming (ILP) 
formulation. A Virtual Optical Network (VON) is composed 
of several Virtual Nodes (VNs) interconnected by Virtual 
Optical Links (VOLs). Typically, a network operator 
constructs VONs using optical network embedding, which 
allocates necessary resources in the physical infrastructure to 
each VON through node and link mapping stages. Due to the 
complex inter-dependence between these stages, VONE has 
become a major challenge for optical network virtualization 
[2]. Even though VONE over fixed-grid Wavelength-
Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, assuming that all 
the Substrate Nodes (SNs) were equipped with sufficient 
wavelength converters has been studied extensively [3]-[5], 
VONE over flexible-grid EONs has just started to attract 
research interests [2][6]-[8], which can potentially provide 
efficient support to emerging cloud services, especially for 
the highly distributed and data-intensive applications such as 
petabits-scale grid computing. In this paper, we develop and 
investigate an ILP model for Fragmentation-Aware Load-
Balancing-VONE (FALB-VONE) over flexible-grid EONs 
for the first time to the best of our knowledge. The simulation 
results from three different scenarios demonstrate that our 
proposed ILP model outperforms previous work on 
minimization of resource utilization. 
     The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
surveys related work on VONE. The network models and 
problem descriptions of FALB-VONE over EONs are 
presented in Section III. Section IV discusses the ILP model 
and the performance evaluations of FALB-VONE. Finally, 
Section V concludes the paper.

 RELATED WORKS 
Most of the previous studies on VONE were targeted for 
fixed-grid WDM networks, but recent studies have suggested 
that optical network virtualization over flexible-grid EONs 
can potentially provide efficient support to emerging cloud 
services, especially for the highly distributed and data-
intensive applications such as petabits-scale grid computing 
[2]. Chen et al. [9] investigated a spectrum allocation

approach through utilizing the relationship between 
accommodation capability of spectrum blocks and traffic 
bandwidth distribution. Based on this, a Fragmentation-
Aware Spectrum Allocation (FSA) algorithm was presented. 
Zhang, Lu, Zhu, Yin, and Yoo [10] discussed two Routing and 
Spectrum Assignment (RSA) algorithms that can control the 
increase of fragmentation ratio and reduce necessary 
defragmentation operations in networks, the first one is the 
Minimum Network Fragmentation Ratio RSA (MNFR-RSA) 
algorithm, which makes resource allocation based on the 
Network Fragmentation Ratio (NFR) and the second one is 
the Maximum Local Utilization RSA (MLU-RSA) algorithm, 
which alleviated bandwidth fragmentation by utilizing the 
slots that have already been used the most in the network. In  
[11] Talebi, et al. examined and categorized solution 
approaches 
to 
Fragmentation-Aware 
RSA 
(FA-RSA) 
including Proactive FA-RSA, which attempts to prevent or 
minimize spectrum fragmentation at the time a new request is 
admitted and Reactive FA-RSA that employs defragmentation 
techniques to accommodate high-rate and long- path 
connections. The objective of defragmentation is to rearrange 
the spectrum allocation of existing traffic demands so as to 
consolidate available slots into large contiguous and 
continuous blocks. Yin, Zhu, and Yoo in [12] analyzed the 
fragmentation problem in detail for service provisioning in 
dynamic EONs, and proposed three fragmentation-aware 
algorithms 
for 
Routing, 
Modulation 
and 
Spectrum 
Assignment (RMSA) in EONs. Moura, Fonseca, and 
Scaraficci [13] introduced a multi-graph Shortest Path 
algorithm, which represented the spectrum occupancy by a 
multi-graph, where allocation decisions were based on cost 
functions, which tried to capture the potentiality of spectrum 
fragments to allocate incoming requests. In [14], Yin  et al. 
have investigated the spectrum fragmentation problem in 
EON in both the spectral and the spatial dimensions and have 
proposed two fragmentation aware RSA algorithms to 
proactively prevent fragmentation during RSA to the 
incoming lightpath request. 
Among the published papers on VONE, [2][8][15] have 
taken care of minimizing spectral utilization of substrate fiber 
links for mapping the requested virtual link bandwidth, 
possibly with the cost of imposing spectral fragmentation and 
intensifying load unbalancing. In the following section, we 
will develop an ILP formulation that encompass appropriate 
fragmentation-awareness and load-balancing expressions 
within the objective function. 
III. 
MATHEMATICAL MODEL 
We model the substrate EON as an undirected graph, 
denoted as 𝐺𝑠(𝑉𝑠, 𝐸𝑠), where 𝑉𝑠   is the set of SNs, and 
𝐸𝑠represents the set of Substrate Fiber Links (SFLs). We 
assume that each SN 𝑣𝑠 ∈ 𝑉𝑠  has a computing capacity of 
𝑐𝑣𝑠
𝑠  and each SFL 𝑒𝑠 ∈ 𝐸𝑠 can accommodate 𝐵𝑠 Frequency 
Slots (FS’). 
Similar to the substrate topology, a VON request can also 
modeled as an undirected graph 𝐺𝑟(𝑉𝑟, 𝐸𝑟), where 𝑉𝑟 is the 
set of virtual nodes (VNs), and 𝐸𝑟represents the set of VOLs. 
Each VN 𝑣𝑟 ∈ 𝑉𝑟  is associated with a computing resource 
requirement 𝑐𝑣𝑟
𝑟  , while the Band Width (BW) requirement of 
each VOL 𝑒𝑟 ∈ 𝐸𝑟 is 𝑏𝑤𝑒𝑟
𝑟   (in terms of Gb/s). This work 
considers both node mapping and link mapping in the VONE 
process. In the course of node mapping, each VN from the 
VON request is mapped onto a unique SN that has sufficient 
computing capacity. The link mapping course is essentially a 
special RSA operation. Specifically, the RSA sets up a 
lightpath in the physical infrastructure for each VOL to 
satisfy its BW requirement, under the spectrum non-
overlapping, continuity and contiguity constraints [2]. 
The next subsection introduces a path-based ILP 
formulation for the FALB-VONE over EONs following the 
recent work presented in [2]. In-line with modulation-level 
adaptability provided by Optical Orthogonal Frequency 
Division Multiplexing (OOFDM) scheme, we assume that 
substrate lightpath can select one of Binary Phase-Shift 
Keying (BPSK), Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK), 8 
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (8QAM), and 16QAM 
modulation-levels adaptively according to the transmission 
distance. If we take the BW of one FS to be 12.5 GHz, it can 
carry 12.5 Gb/s signal when the modulation-level is BPSK. 
Based on the experimental results in [16], we set the 
transmission reach of BPSK, QPSK, 8QAM, and 16QAM 
signals as 3000, 1500, 750, and 375 km, respectively. For all 
pre-calculated substrate shortest paths, the highest possible 
modulation-levels are predetermined and stored. BW 
requirement of VOL is normalized as multiples of one 
subcarrier BPSK signal operating at 12.5 Gbs.

     where, the first term is introduced to keep the assigned 
CSBs as close as possible to the starting index of first MCSB. 
It comprises sum of ratios of highest starting slot index 
among CSBs allocated to 𝑒𝑟𝑠 that uses 𝑒𝑠to the starting FS 
index of the first MCSB of that 𝑒𝑠 divided by M to get the 
normalized value. 𝛼 is the weighting coefficient to adjust the 
relative contribution of this term. The second term is included 
to minimize extra spectral fragmentation induced by VOL 
mapping and consists of normalized sum of total number of 
free slot blocks in 𝑒𝑠 after allocating CSBs to 𝑒𝑟𝑠 divided by 
number of MCSBs of that 𝑒𝑠. 𝛽 is the weighting coefficient 
to tune its impact. The third term accounts for minimizing 
BW utilization, likewise presented in [2], but here, it is 
divided by a lower band of BW utilization for normalization 
purpose and 𝛾  is the corresponding weight coefficient. 
Finally, the last two terms are responsible to maintain link 
and node load balancing in substrate EON. 𝜂𝐿 and 𝜂𝑁 are 
their weighting coefficients, respectively, which are 
computed from the given parameters 𝜂𝐿
𝑚𝑖𝑛/𝜂𝐿

Under excessive load unbalancing conditions, some links 
are highly loaded (𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐶𝐿
𝑠 ≈ 0) while some others are lightly 
loaded (𝛥𝐶𝐿
𝑠 ≫ 0) so the ratio inside exponent becomes nearly 
zero to make 𝜂𝐿 become close to 𝜂𝐿
𝑚𝑎𝑥. However, when all 
links are lightly loaded ( 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝐶𝐿
𝑠 ≫ 0 ) and/or slightly 
unbalanced (𝛥𝐶𝐿
𝑠 ≈ 0), the exponent goes to zero to make 𝜂𝐿 
become close to 𝜂𝐿
𝑚𝑖𝑛. The same pattern applies to 𝜂𝑁. 
D. Constraints  
     Equations (3)(18) formulates general requirements for 
node and link mapping, as articulated in [2], and the 
remaining equations are properly defined to characterize 
additional variables and expressions.

IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
We implemented the proposed ILP model by ILP solver 
IBM Cplex [17] to evaluate the blocking performance of a 
simple six-node topology as substrate network, shown in 
Figure 1. We assumed that all SFLs have the same length of 
100 km, the number of VNs in each VON request is 
uniformly distributed in a preset range, and the probability 
that a VN-pair is directly connected equals 0.5, which means 
that there would be 𝑛(𝑛 − 1)/4 VOLs on average for a VON 
request with 𝑛  VNs. VONE requests arrive randomly 
according to Poisson traffic distribution and their holding 
time follow negative exponential distribution with an average 
value of 10 min. We also assume that each incoming request 
should be served instantly or will be rejected forever due to 
insufficiency of available resources.

The blocking performance of the proposed model under 
different request loads were then investigated and compared 
with those of the reference work [2] for three different 
scenarios through extensive numerical simulations. Table I 
depicts common parameter settings and Table II illustrates 
details of scenario-specific parameters. In scenarios 1 and 3, 
the range of variations of VOL’s BW requirement and VN’s 
computing requirement, respectively, were deliberately 
increased to present the effectiveness of load-balancing and 
fragmentation-awareness contributions more clearly. To find 
the optimal values of weighting coefficients, they were 
initially set to 1 and then each of them was precisely tuned 
against the others.

Figure 2 shows the variation of blocking probability 
versus VON request load for the first scenario under four 
different situations. The "reference" graph exhibits results 
obtained by preserving the third term of the objective 
function and eliminating all other terms, as well as their 
associated constraints. This served us to benchmark the 
performance of the proposed model against the previous 
work. The graph labeled "FA" illustrates results obtained by 
considering only the impact of Fragmentation-Awareness in 
VONE (α = β = γ= 1, 𝜂𝐿 = 𝜂𝐿 = 0). Conversely, the graph 
labeled "LB" shows results gained by including only the 
impact of Load-Balancing VONE (α = β = 0, 𝛾 = 𝜂𝐿 = 𝜂𝐿 =
1). Finally, the graph labeled "FA+LB" represents that the 
combined impact of all terms having their optimal weighting 
coefficients achieves the best performance. This verifies the 
presumption that all FA and LB terms synergistically 
contribute to lower the blocking probability.

Variation in the range of VOL's BW requirement or VN's 
computing requirement, was studied in scenarios 2 and 3, 
respectively. Figures 3 and 4 show that the proposed scheme 
could still successfully control spectral fragmentation and 
simultaneously maintain load-balanced condition. It is worth 
noting that, under light request load, the proposed scheme 
fulfilled an order-of-magnitude reduction in the blocking 
probability in all scenarios compared with the reference work 
without imposing any additional cost.

V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The recent work on virtual network embedding presented 
ILP formulation to optimize resource utilization. In this paper, 
we extended the model so that fragmentation-awareness, as 
well as load-balancing features were taken in to account in the 
optimization process. Simulation results verified that our 
proposed model outperforms the recent work under three 
different scenarios. Parameter settings in scenario 2 were 
exactly replicated the reference work. Scenarios 1 and 3 were 
arranged to demonstrate more clearly the effectiveness of 
load-balancing and fragmentation-awareness contributions, 
respectively. Moreover, our model could achieve remarkable 
reduction in blocking probability under wide range of request 
traffic loads, particularly in light request traffic loads. 
Our future plan is to develop efficient heuristic algorithm 
based on the notions embodied in ILP formulation.
