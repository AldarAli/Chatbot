Abstract—The paper discusses an application of multi-agent 
based on theory of argumentation-based on negotiation, and 
provides adaptive concession strategy model for beginning a 
negotiation. Firstly, this paper defines hypotheses of model and 
a frame of negotiation based on argumentation. Secondly, for 
comparing purpose, two generating models of concession 
strategy are also studied as:model based on time constraint 
and model based on opposite’s preferences,  the process of 
demonstration and result of experiment has been shown that 
the latter designed by PSO-RBFNN (RBF Neural Network 
optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm has 
better abilities of learning and reasoning, which is dominant 
strategy in bilateral negotiations,and has a certain feasibility 
and application value.

INTRODUCTION 
In the process of e-commerce industrialization, 
Multi-Agent technology is crucial to the big change of 
e-commerce, and negotiation as a process of dynamic 
interaction is considered to be an important factor in 
multi-agent system. At present, some researches in the 
technology of automated negotiation based on multi-agent 
have been pursued and some achievements have also been 
developed. These researches often have been made in many 
different aspects, which are the design and implementation 
of automated negotiation system, the model of negotiation 
support system and the key technologies in automated 
negotiation based on multi-agent, etc. In accordance with 
difference of research methods, three types of negotiation 
have been presented, which are the negotiation based game 
theory, the negotiation based on heuristic algorithm and the 
negotiation based on argumentation, respectively. In recent 
years, argumentation-based negotiation has been accepted as 
a promising alternative to game-theoretic or heuristic-based 
negotiation [1]. In a argumentation-based negotiation, the 
problem of conflict must been brought up because of the 
different beliefs between buyer and seller, so that one of the 
main goals of negotiation is to make one negotiator agent 
has the ability to infer opposite negotiator ’s thinking, and 
revise own belief through learning opposite’s preferences 
during the process of interaction to avoid negative dialogue 
between both parties, which make agent be able to adjust 
negotiation strategies to changing environment. Up to this 
point, the problem of adaptive strategy has become a new 
topic in the field of argumentation-based negotiation. 
While 
many 
researchers 
had 
developed 
some 
achievements in the field of adaptive negotiation strategies,  
there are two main problems with current researches, which 
are largely based on on-line learning. Usually, the large 
numbers of negotiated transaction records in history are not 
used effectively. At the same time, the mechanism of 
argumentation are not fully introduced into current most 
adaptive negotiation strategies. Consequently, if a negotiator 
can offer a proposal with argumentation based on concession 
strategies according to opposite’s preferences reasoned from 
negotiating records in history, then persuasiveness of the 
proposal will be improved and process of negotiation will be 
advanced effectively. In this paper, the generating model of 
concessional 
strategies 
in 
the 
argumentation-based 
negotiation is discussed. Firstly, the paper defines 
hypotheses of model and a frame of argumentation-based 
negotiation. Secondly, the model based on time constraint 
and model based on opposite’s preferences are presented 
respectively, and the latter designed by PSO-RBFNN 
algorithm can be demonstrated to be dominant strategy in a 
negotiation. Finally, the model based on opposite’s 
preferences which can be proved to have a certain feasibility 
and application value via experiment. 
II. 
MODEL HYPOTHESES AND FRAMEWORK 
The paper will conduct the research on adaptive 
concession strategies in argumentation-based negotiation 
based on the following hypotheses and framework. 
A. Model Hypotheses 
Hypothesis 1.Agent is completely selfish, i.e., agent 
will pursue individual maximum utility. 
Hypothesis 2.Agent has limited rationality, i.e., agent 
can change the mental state of the other party through 
offering proposal with argumentation. 
Hypothesis 3.Agent with incomplete information don’t 
know the other Agent's preference information, i.e., one 
agent will can not directly control other agent unless 
through negotiating between both parties.  
Hypothesis 4.Time is precious to both parties.

Hypothesis 5.The both negotiating parties are sincere to 
reach agreement through negotiations, that is to say there 
isn’t deceit during negotiation process. 
Hypothesis 6.The failure of the negotiation is the worst 
result of negotiations between both parties. 
B. Framework 
In the accordance with hypotheses above, a framework 
of bilateral multi-issue negotiation based on argumentation is 
constructed (see Figure 1), which make agents have ability of 
self-learning. For example, in a negotiation, if there is a 
obvious 
differences 
between 
information 
of 
buyer 
agent(
ia )’s order and expectation of seller agent(
ja ) after 
the seller agent offers a proposal, then 
ia  asks 
ja  to 
accept the proposal, but 
ja  will can not accept it in order to 
keep 
individual 
utility 
at 
maximum. 
Meanwhile, 
intermediary agent can acquire 
ia ’ s satisfaction degree of 
issue in the proposal through neural network module, and 
then the satisfaction degree will be transformed into the 
information that understood by
ja through the model of 
output processing. Further, 
ja can acquire the preference 
condition of the buyer according to the received information, 
generate concessional strategy, and determine the content of 
argumentation to improve the persuasiveness of new 
proposal and advance the process of negotiation.  
 
Figure 1. Framework of argumentation-based Negotiation 
where dotted line show the training process of network, and 
solid line show the reasoning process of network. 
Negotiator Agent (Seller/Buyer Agent): During the 
process of negotiation, Negotiator Agent make seller and 
buyer acquire data information that reflect interaction event 
in negotiation, and carry out some action that affect the 
negotiation process. 
Intermediary Agent: Intermediary Agent is introduced 
into this research in order to ensure authenticity of the 
interaction event and avoid fraud in negotiating environment, 
which make Negotiator Agent acquire more effective and 
operational information from Intermediary Agent compared 
with information obtained directly from the opposite 
negotiator. 
Negotiation Case Base: This base is used for storing 
finished negotiating records in history, and Intermediary 
Agent can take advantage of these records to learn 
negotiators’ private information (e.g., preference) . 
Knowledge Base: This base is used for storing 
negotiators’ private information for different negotiating 
mission, in which one negotiating mission is stored for each 
record, and each record includes the important parameters 
needed by Neural Network Module. 
Training and Learning Module: Finished negotiating 
records stored in Negotiation Case Base can be processed in 
this module. This processing is also the process of learing 
negotiators’ private information to adjust the important 
parameters needed by Neural Network Module, and results 
will be put into Knowledge Base. 
Neural Network Module: During the process of 
negotiation, Neural Network Module can obtain important 
parameters of neural network from Knowledge Base, and 
then reason negotiators’ private informtion through 
processing input data information (have been pretreated 
through Pretreatment Module) from Negotiator Agent. 
Pretreatment Module: The input data from Negotiation 
Case Base or Negotiator Agent can be normalized in this 
module so that input data fit the constraints of format 
required by Neural Network Module and Training and 
Learning Module. 
Output Processing Module: Through this module, 
negotiators’ private information reasoned by Neural 
Network Module will be tranferred into the information 
easily unstandable for Negotiator Agent.

B. Description of Definition 
Definition 1(Satisfaction Degree). A contrast of buyer’s 
feelings generated by purchasing a goods and their own 
expectation(preference), which is a relative concept. It can be 
used to assist the seller to investigate the match condition 
between seller’s goods and buyer’s expection, and can also 
be quantized through reasoning in accordance with initial 
information of goods’issues. The range of satisfaction degree 
is [0,1], and the greater value, the better degree of 
satisfaction. 
Definition 2(Preference Coefficient). Representing a 
negotiator’ s favorable attitude toward negotiating goods. A 
negotiator can sort the important degree of negotiating issues 
in accordance with own expectation. The sorting order can 
reflect the needs, interests and hobbies of negotiators. The 
range of preferences coefficient is [0,1], the greater value, 
the more important for negotiators. 
The formal description of satisfaction degree and 
preferences coefficient is as follows.

C. Concession Strategies 
In a argumentation-based negotiation, no matter which 
form of argumentation (Reward, Threat, Defense) is 
presented [6], negotiator agent should consider to make 
concession on proposal at first. During the process of 
practical negotiation, a concession strategy based on time 
constraints may make negotiator loss opportunities for 
reaching an agreement because both sides are in a hurry to 
complete negotiation within the time constraint, while 
concession strategy based on opposite’s preferences can help 
negotiator agent to have a definite object in view generate 
new proposal in accordance with the least action principle of 
belief revision, which will improve the efficiency of 
negotiation. This strategy is dominant strategy in a bilateral 
negotiation. By compared with concession strategy based on 
time constraint, the concession strategy based on opposite’s 
preference has the high feasibility and application value. 
This conclusion will be formalized through the following 
propositions. 
Under Hypothesis 1, agent will pursue individual 
maximum utility. The individual utility of a negotiator agent 
ia  in the r th round of negotiation is as follow,

But if take the inherent correlation between two issues 
into consideration (e.g., price and quality: the higher price, 
the better quality), then ⑴  can be corrected through 
introducing a correlative coefficient as show below,

Proposition 1. At the beginning of a negotiation, the

the description about limited rationality of agent in 
Hypothesis 2. Besides, the individual utility value reduction 
through concession should be as small as possible after each 
round of negotiation in order to make the individual utility 
of negotiator keep on a high level. 
In accordance with Lemma 1, the individual utility value 
reduction of agent relates to the utility value reduction of 
single issue. So the individual utility value reduction can be 
determined by the utility function of single issue, see Figure 
2, where the solid lines denote the utility function of single 
issue, the utility value reduction of single issue (

Further, ⑺ and ⑻ are proved to be reasonable through 
combining with typical time strategies in the process of a

In particular, three typical time strategy function can be 
used in a negotiation based on single time constraint, as 
follows,

make uniform concession with advance of negotiating

Proposition 3. In the model of concession strategy 
based on opposite’s preferences, when the negotiation come 
to a deadlock, one negotiator agent can deduce the 
opposite’s preferences from negotiated transaction records 
in history, and then determine issue and floting value of 
concession in the next round of negotiation according to the 
opposite’s preferences.

Proof. The both parties are sincere to reach agreement 
through negotiations, and there is not deceit during 
negotiation process from Hypothesis 5. Besides, in 
accordance with Hypothesis 3, the negotiator agent with 
incomplete 
information 
don’t 
know 
the 
opposite’s 
preferences information, and the preferences information 
can be acquired only through learning and reasoning based 
on negotiated transaction records in history. In the 
negotiation, if one negotiator agent can determine own 
behaviors according to the opposite’s preferences, determine 
issue of concessionand step size of concession, and further 
generate a new proposal with argumention, then deceit in 
the negotiation can be avoided. In particular, after 
determining the issue of concession,

Besides, when a negotiation come to a deadlock, one 
negotiator agent can sort the preference coefficient of all 
issues after determining opposite’s preferences of all issues, 
make concession in the certain issue with minimal priority 
among

 according to principle of utility 
maximization, and then offer a new proposal in the next 
round of negotiation. If the new proposal is rejected, then 
the agent can adjust the proposal according to following 
steps, 
1) Determining whether the preference coefficient (
αqxu
) 
of certain issue (
qxu
) has minimum priority or not, if so, the 
issue with the second-smallest priority will be used as new 
issue of concession. 
2) The belief of issue with the second-smallest priority 
should be revised according to function of concession;the 
negotiator agent should make concession the issue with the 
second-smallest priority. 
Facts show that agent can acquire much more individual 
utility if the agent comply strictly with the process of 
revising belief[5]. Up to this point, ⑼and⑽is proved to be 
reasonable. 
Besides, the value of every element in the preference 
coefficient set is determined by satisfaction degree in 
historical negotiated transaction records, so this paper will 
fit the mapping relation from satisfaction degree to 
preferences coefficient through PSO-RBFNN with the 
ability of  approximation to random nonlinear functions in 
order to adapt to environmental changes. 
IV. 
EVALUATION OF MODEL 
The main task of this concessional strategy model is to 
determine the opposite’s preferences to help agent to 
generate proposal with argumentation and further advance 
the process of negotiation. The preferences information can 
be acquired through PSO-RBFNN, so the neural network 
module in Figure 1 is the core module in the framework of 
argumentation-based negotiation. And this paper will select 
the following simulation experiment to demonstrate the 
feasibility of this module design. 
A. Traning  
Firstly, using a group of historical negotiated transaction 
records(including 21 records) that have been normalized as 
training samples of the RBF neural network. And only 4 
typical issues (i.e., price, warranty, delivery date and method 
of payment) will be involved in the following experiment 
In the training samples, the values of the 4 issues are 
used as input(

i.e., there are 4 input neurons, the satisfaction degree of each

), i.e., there are 5output neurons. So the 
structure of the neural network is “ 4

l
− −
”, and l  is the 
number of hidden nodes which can be adjusted during the 
process of learning. Optimum parameters of this neural 
network are searched by using PSO algorithm to improve 
speed and accuracy of training. The convergence situation of 
key parameters is as shown in Figure 3 (via Matlab2010). 
The MMSE (Minimum Mean-Square Error) decreases with 
the increase of iteration times, finally the error converge to 
10-3 in the 40462th generation. Then the RBF neural network 
that is used to fit negotiators’ preferences can be constructed 
by using these optimum key parameters.

B. Testing 
A group of testing samples including 11 records (see 
Table 1) are inputted into the neural network. The 
comparation between predictive output and ideal output of 
the testing samples is shown in Figure 4.

In accordance with the output result of testing samples 
above, when the ideal(actual) output value of whole 
satisfaction degree is beyond 0.7, the predictive output value

of whole satisfaction degree is also beyond 0.7, thus the 
predictive effect is good. Besides, the preferences’ 
characteristics shown in the testing samples are similar to 
the preferences’characteristics shown in the training 
samples, e.g., the whole satisfaction degree decreases with 
the increase of price, the buyer negotiator set a high value 
on other issues when the price has begun to level off. So the 
effect of simulation for preferences is good, this model has a 
certain feasibility and application value. Then negotiator 
agent can sort the preferences coefficient of all issues after 
determining opposite negotiator’s preferences information, 
result as follows,

. Next, agent can 
determinate concessional issue (

) through adhering to  
principle of individual utility maximization, and make 
concession on the issue in accordance with the model of 
concession strategy based on opposite’s preferences 
mentioned above, further generate a new proposal with 
argumentaion and advance the process of negotiation.

RELATED WORK 
In recent years, there is an increasing amount of works 
on adaptive strategy in negotiation. Richter, Klusch and 
Kowalczyk suggested an adaptive strategy that bases on 
multistage fuzzy decision making. The bilateral negotiation 
strategies can allow agent to adapt its negotiation strategies 
and improve its individual payoffs by constructing a 
modelling of individual preferences as fuzzy goal and fuzzy 
constraints [4]. Wong and Wang proposed an ontology- 
mediated approach to organize the agent-based supply chain 
negotiation. Through equiping the agents with sophisticated 
negotiation knowledge that is structured by the usage of 
ontology, agents’ negotiation behaviors will be more 
adaptive to various negotiation environments [5]. A number 
of researchers had attempted to use machine learning 
methods to optimal adaptive interaction strategies and their 
researches have several similarities to our own (e.g., each 
negotiator agent is given ability to reason opposite 
negotiator’s private information). Oliverira and Rocha 
designed a virtual market and generate negotiation proposal 
by using a continuous reinforcement learning algorithm to 
enable agents to adjust themselves to the changing 
environment, including the opponent agents [6]. Sim and 
Guo presented a method that use the synergy of Bayesian 
learning (BL) and genetic algorithm (GA) to determine an 
agent's optimal strategy in negotiation (N) with incomplete 
information, called BLGAN. One agent can learn 
opponent’s researve price (RP) and deadline through BL, 
reduce the size of search space for GA, then search and 
generate a optimum strategy at each negotiation round [7]. 
Although there are several similarities, our research differs 
in that we construct a concessional strategy model designed 
by PSO-RBFNN to allow negotiator agent to reason 
opposite negotiator’s preferences information, determinte 
concessional issues and adapt negotiation strategies. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper proposes some hypotheses that support 
argumentation-based negotiation at first, then presents the 
generating model of concessional strategy based on single 
time constraint and the model based on opposite’s 
preferences, respectively, the process of demonstration and 
result of experiment show that the latter designed by 
PSO-RBFNN has better abilities of learning and reasoning, 
which is dominant strategy in bilateral negotiations, and has 
a certain feasibility and application value. But the research 
in this paper is only a preliminary result, there are a lot of 
works to do in the future, and the emphasis is on appliance 
of the model to the environment of pratical business 
negotiation. In addition, how to introduce the factor of credit 
and trust into the model mentioned above to evaluate 
argumentation based on negotiation transaction records in 
history is also an important research direction in the future.
