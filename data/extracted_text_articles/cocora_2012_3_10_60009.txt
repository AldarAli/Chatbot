Abstract—This paper analyzes the noise–linearity breakdown 
in direct conversion multi-standard radio receivers embedding 
analog signal conditioning. The paper’s main goal is to develop 
a systematic noise–linearity partitioning methodology to be 
used in splitting the multi-standard receiver noise and linearity 
budget between its high frequency (HF) part and its low 
frequency (LF) baseband part. To this aim, a new and efficient 
design methodology tailored towards multi-standard receivers, 
and based on manual analysis, is developed. By using the 
developed methodology, power saving is enabled in the HF 
part through changing the multi-standard receiver HF part 
noise and linearity performance with its RF front-end gain. 
While for the LF part, the analysis revealed the performance 
can be kept the same to allow power optimization through 
dedicated circuit design.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The latest trends in wireless communications reveal 
standards tend to use multiple frequency plans, RF and IF 
bandwidths 
and 
different 
modulation 
schemes 
and 
techniques (e. g., IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e). On top of it, 
the wireless medium is packed with different standards. 
Thus, there is a strong need for reconfigurable hardware that 
can handle a diverse range of wireless signals, [1]. 
For a multi-standard receiver front-end the homodyne 
quadrature down-converter is the optimum choice, [2]. This 
has been validated through several circuit implementations in 
CMOS processes, [1, 3-5]. The multi-standard receiver front-
end principle block schematic is shown in Fig. 1, redrawn 
from [1]. 
To mitigate the different frequency plans specific to a 
multi-standard implementation, the receiver is assumed to 
have multiple RF inputs and hence, multiple Low Noise 
Amplifiers (LNAs), [6]. Through the multiplexer, the wanted 
RF path is fed to the complex down-conversion mixer driven 
by a quadrature LO signal having the same frequency with 
the RF carrier. These blocks represent the receiver’s High 
Frequency (HF) part. Following the mixer, the receiver Low 
Frequency (LF) part is comprised by the analog signal

conditioning blocks: the Low Pass Filter (LPF) and the 
Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA). 
This paper analyzes the noise–linearity breakdown in 
direct conversion multi-standard radio receivers embedding 
analog signal calibration. The paper introduces a new design 
methodology, stemming from a first order system level 
analysis based on manual analysis that enables a systematic 
approach of the noise–linearity partitioning that splits the 
multi-standard receiver noise and linearity budget between 
its HF and LF parts. 
To this aim, firstly, Section II presents the need for smart 
gain partitioning in multi-standard wireless receivers. 
Secondly, Section III presents the smart noise partitioning 
strategy for multi-standard homodyne receivers based on the 
key tradeoff between the receiver HF part power 
consumption and its LF part area. In Section IV, the smart 
linearity partitioning strategy is revealed to complete the 
receiver 
electrical 
specifications 
breakdown. 
Finally, 
Section V wraps up the paper by presenting the conclusions. 
II. 
THE NEED FOR SMART GAIN PARTITIONING 
The wireless environment is an extreme one with respect 
to the signal reception. Generally, three generic receive 
scenarios are possible, as derived from the analysis in [7]. 
First of all, the received signal is very weak. In this case, 
the receiver noise performance is critical. 
Secondly, the received signal is weak and surrounded by 
blockers and interferers, as specified by the receiver blockers 
diagram.

In [8], a generic receiver blockers diagram has been 
introduced to allow mapping of all blockers and interferers 
of the envisaged standards. Under these conditions, the 
proper signal demodulation is constraint by both the 
receiver’s noise and linearity performance. 
Thirdly, the received signal is strong, and, thus, a high 
linearity is required from the receiver. 
Hence, in order to mitigate all the received scenarios, the 
authors introduce in [7] the smart gain partitioning strategy 
tailored towards multi-standard radio receivers. Basically, 
the smart gain partitioning foresees (i) the receiver gain is 
programmable depending on the input signal level and is 
split in between its HF and LF part (i. e., between the LNA 
and the VGA) and (ii) the receiver noise and linearity 
performance (i. e., NFRX and IIP3RX) adjust with its HF part 
gain, AHF. 
In [7], four gain settings are foreseen for AHF to increase 
the receiver robustness to blockers and interferers. The 
maximum receiver gain, AHF max, is limited to 40 dB due to 
linearity reasons. The chosen gain step is 12 dB. Thus, the 
receiver will have four different NFRX and IIP3RX, depending 
on the AHF gain settings (i. e., 4, 16, 28 and 40 dB). 
Given the derivation of the key electrical specifications 
for a multi-standard radio receiver from [6], it resulted (i) the 
minimum receiver NFRX is 3 dB (i. e., at maximum receiver 
gain, when the signal is at the receiver sensitivity level), 
while (ii) the maximum IIP3RX is +12 dBm (i. e., at 
minimum receiver gain, when the received signal is at its 
maximum level). 
Further on in this paper, we are accounting a degradation 
of 1 dB / dB with AHF gain change of both NFRX and IIP3RX. 
III. 
NOISE PARTITIONING STRATEGY 
The overall receiver noise budget, represented by the 
receiver NF, NFRX, is partitioned between the receiver LF 
and HF parts. 
According to Friis equation the receiver global NF, 
NFRX, can be calculated from the individual contributions of 
HF and LF parts:

where FHF, respectively FLF, represent the noise factors of the 
HF part, respectively LF part, and AHF = ALNA·AMIX is the 
receiver’s HF front-end gain and it is equal to the product 
between the LNA gain, ALNA, and the mixer gain, AMIX. 
Equation (1) shows that the LF part noise contribution is 
reduced by the RF front-end gain. Thus, knowing 
NFHF = 10 lg(FHF), the LF part noise figure, NFLF, results as:

where Rn HF is the receiver RF front-end equivalent noise 
resistance, Rn LF is the receiver baseband chain equivalent 
noise resistance and RS is the antenna’s resistance. 
The noise partitioning is most critical when the receiver 
input signal is at its lowest value. Hence, AHF is at its highest 
value AHF max = 40 dB to keep NFRX = 3 dB. For this case, 
Fig. 2 plots the NFLF, Rn HF and Rn LF versus NFHF.

Figure 3.  a. NFHF and NFLF vs. AHF and b. Rn HF and Rn LF vs. AHF 
The Rn HF, respectively Rn LF, calculated by (3) and shown 
in Fig. 2, represent the link between the receiver HF part 
power consumption, respectively LF part area, and its noise 
performance. Because of the large AHF max, Rn LF is much 
larger than Rn HF (i. e., a few orders in magnitude), as shown 
in Fig. 2.b. Hence, the receiver HF part consumes more 
power than its LF part to achieve the same noise when 
referred at the receiver input. 
Therefore, in order to reduce the receiver power 
consumption, the smart noise partitioning allows the receiver 
HF part to contribute more to the overall NFRX. This 
translates to choosing a larger Rn HF, while allowing a bit 
smaller Rn LF. But, a smaller Rn LF translates to a larger 
receiver area, as larger capacitances must be chosen to keep 
the same IF bandwidth, [1, 9]. 
Therefore the plot from is Fig. 2.b shows the key trade-
off that shapes the noise partitioning: the trade-off between 
the receiver power consumption, represented by Rn HF, and its 
area, set by Rn LF. 
Hence, in the case where the minimum receiver NF is 
required, NFHF is accounting 2 dB, while the baseband chain 
and the ADC, share the remaining 1 dB from the 3 dB global 
NFRX. This translates to a NFLF of about 33 dB. 
As mentioned, for the other receiver gain settings, the 
gain partitioning foresees the NFRX reduction at a rate of 
1 dB/dB with the AHF decrease. The smart noise partitioning 
of the noise budget between NFHF and NFLF, accounts the 
degradation of only NFHF, while keeping the same NFLF. 
This potentially allows power saving in the front-end RF 
part, since its noise requirements are relaxed with the AHF 
decrease. While for the baseband part the same NFLF is 
foreseen regardless of the RF front-end gain setting, since 
power reduction would affect the LF part building blocks 
linearity. 
Thus, the baseband blocks design is simplified and their 
power optimization is enabled though dedicated designs (e. 
g., by using low power optimized fully differential amplifiers 
as the building brick of all baseband blocks, [10]). 
Fig. 3.a plots the NFHF and NFLF for versus the AHF gain 
settings. Equivalently, by reverting (2), and knowing NFHF 
and NFLF, both Rn HF and Rn LF can be calculated. Fig. 3.b 
reveals Rn HF and Rn LF for the four AHF settings. 
IV. 
LINEARITY PARITITIONING STRATEGY 
The linearity partitioning strategy tackles the receiver 
overall IIP3, IIP3RX, budget split between its HF and LF 
parts. Hence, it calculates IIP3RX as a function of the RF 
front-end IIP3, IIP3HF, and of the baseband chain IIP3, 
IIP3LF:

Linearity constraints are important at high signal levels, 
when AHF is small. For this case (i. e., AHF = 4 dB), by using 
eq. (4), Fig. 4.a plots IIP3LF vs. IIP3HF for IIP3RX = 12 dBm. 
As expected, the plot reveals that for a more linear RF 
front-end we can tolerate more non-linearity from the LF 
chain. But, given the high operation frequency, a more linear 
RF front-end burns more power to achieve the same linearity 
when compared with the LF part blocks. Moreover given the 
low baseband signal bandwidth (i. e., maximum 20 MHz for 
W-LAN 802.11n amongst envisaged standards), the LF part 
circuits can very efficiently make use of negative feedback 
based on low power feedback amplifiers to achieve a high 
linearity (e. g., [9, 11, 12]). 
Hence, the smart linearity partitioning accounts equal 
contributions from the receiver HF part and from its LF part 
when referred to the input (i. e., IIP3LF / AHF). Thus, it results:

The smart gain partitioning foresees the IIP3RX reduction 
at a rate of 1 dB/dB with the AHF increase. Similarly to the 
noise partitioning, the smart linearity partitioning allows the 
degradation of only the RF front-end linearity performance 
(i. e., IIP3HF). Hence, given the smart linearity partitioning 
from eq. (5), Fig. 4.b reveals IIP3HF and IIP3LF for the four 
AHF settings. And again the same conclusion arises: since the 
LF part linearity performance is the same regardless of AHF 
(i. e., IIP3LF = +19 dBm), the LF part blocks design is 
simplified and it can optimized by designing dedicated 
building blocks.

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper analyzed the noise–linearity breakdown 
between the HF part and LF part of a direct conversion 
multi-standard radio receivers embedding analog signal 
conditioning. In order to enable a systematic approach of the 
noise–linearity partitioning, the paper introduces a new 
design 
methodology 
tailored 
towards 
multi-standard 
receivers, stemming from a first order system level analysis 
based on manual analysis. 
By using the developed methodology, power saving is 
enabled in the HF part through changing the multi-standard 
receiver HF part noise and linearity performance with its RF 
front-end gain. While for the LF part, the analysis revealed 
the performance can be kept the same to allow power 
optimization through dedicated circuit design. 
The paper emphasizes the general characteristic of the 
proposed smart noise–linearity partitioning methodology, as 
it fits best a true re-configurable multi-standard receiver 
implementation.
