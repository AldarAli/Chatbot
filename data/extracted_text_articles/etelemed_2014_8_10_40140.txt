Abstract— We discuss two computational techniques in the 
current paper. In the first part, we aim at employing FCM 
(fuzzy c-means) clustering to compute membership degrees of 
two clusters providing decisions to perform surgery or not for 
a testing set of 25 gastric cancer patients. The second part 
handles mathematical modelling of a common function 
approximating the information obtained from the c-means 
procedure. After constructing the equation of the function, we 
can make the decision about the surgery in the form of the 
surgery degree for an arbitrary gastric cancer patient. A 
centre, dealing with mathematical techniques concerning 
surgery prognoses, can quickly decide about surgery for the 
patient who lives in a remote place. A transmission of 
information among the centre and some hospitals, interested 
in adopting the centre services, can facilitate surgery decision-
making. This trial can be treated as a contribution in the 
telemedicine domain. 
Keywords–c-means clustering; surgery degrees; clinical 
characteristic value; weights of importance; truncated π-
functions. 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Multidisciplinary cancer conferences play a very 
important role in decision-making process in modern 
treatment of gastric cancer patients. The aim of the 
conference is to establish assessments and treatment 
decisions for particular patients. The most discussed method 
of gastric cancer treatment is the partial or the total resection 
of the stomach, which makes the surgery decision so 
important.  
To support the surgery decision-making, we develop 
different mathematical models, in which the entry data 
consist of the values of clinical markers, sampled during the 
examinations of the patients. 
We have been provided with the clinical data of 25 
gastric cancer patients, randomly selected and treated as a 
testing set. When designing the mathematical apparatus, we 
first intend to adapt the c-means method, separating patients 
in two sets named “degree of surgery” and “degree of no 
surgery”. A multidimensional data point-vector, consisted of 
values of the decisive biological markers, is assigned to each 
patient. The patient’s age, the crp-value (the C reactive 
proteins value) [1] and the body weight play a significant 
role in the surgery diagnosis. 
 
The differentiation of patients-vectors in two classes is 
well done by putting forward the fuzzified version of cluster 
analysis [2]. Among clustering approaches, the fuzzy c-
means clustering is regarded as the most efficient [2][3][4]. 
The earlier trials, involving fuzzy c-means clustering in 
surgery decision-making, were discussed by us in [5][6]. 
 
For each tested patient, the cluster matrix will deliver 
degrees of surgery and degrees of no surgery belonging to 
interval [0, 1]. 
 
After 
running 
the 
c-means 
algorithm, 
some 
characteristic values will be assigned to all patients tested. 
The characteristic values will combine measurements of 
biological markers with importance weights of these 
markers. Further, we will determine a set of points 
containing pairs (patient characteristics, degree of surgery). 
After inserting the points into the two-dimensional 
coordinate system, in accordance with ascending order of 
patient characteristic values, we will make a trial of 
approximating this set of points by the truncated version of 
the π-function [7][8]. The equation of the truncated π 
function makes possible to evaluate the surgery degree for 
an arbitrary patient. The approximation of the point set and 
prognoses, made for casual gastric cancer patients, 
constitute the paper’s second part, where our earlier and 
new theoretical contributions are sampled. 
 
We cannot compare our results with other mathematical 
trials testing the operation decisions, since we have not 
found any traces of such trials in literature. A confrontation 
of our results with the physicians’ decisions is the only way 
to validate a proposed mathematical system. 
 
Our further intention is to implement centralized 
computer programs. By spreading the effects of the program 
actions, we count on awaking some interest in other centres. 
These are expected to communicate with the main 
transmission station in order to obtain the support in surgery 
decision making. This trial of starting the communication by 
computers in the matter of surgery decision can be regarded 
as a contribution in the telemedicine domain. 
 
In Section II we list the steps of fuzzy c-means 
clustering. The technique of generating entries in the initial 
matrix is discussed in Section III. Section IV provides us 
with surgery prognoses made for 25 patients tested. 
Characteristic values of patients are introduced in Section V.

The values will be later involved in the procedure of 
approximation of points (characteristics of patient, degree of 
surgery) by a continuous function in Section VI. We 
conclude in Section VII. 
II. 
FUZZY C-MEANS CLUSTERING ALGORITHM 
 
Let us recall the definition of a fuzzy set. The fuzzy set 
A is a collection ܣ ൌ ሼሺݔ,ݕ ൌߤ஺ሺݔሻሻሽ,ݔאܣ,ߤ஺ሺݔሻא
ሾ0,1ሿ. Each element x gets a membership degree ߤ஺ሺݔሻ, 
determined by the membership function ߤ஺. 
Suppose that ܺ ൌ ሼݔଵ, … ,ݔ௡ሽ is a finite data set. Each 
data point ݔ௞ ൌ ቀݔ௞భ, … ,ݔ௞೛ቁ , ݇ ൌ 1, … , ݊, is a pattern 
vector in R௣. Fuzzy c-means algorithm partitions X in a 
collection of ܵ௜ subsets, 2 ൑ ݅ ൑ ܿ, called fuzzy clusters. By 
running the algorithm repeatedly, a list of v௜ cluster centres 
and a partition matrix U are returned. 
The description of the c-means algorithm is performed 
in the following steps [2]: 
1) Select c=2, initialize m=3 and the termination 
tolerance ߳ ൌ 10ି଼. 
2) Set l = 0. 
3) Determine the initial values of degrees in partition 
matrix ܷ௟.

6) If ԡܷ௟ାଵ െ ܷ௟ԡ ൒ ߳, then set l = l + 1, and go to step 4. 
If ԡܷ௟ାଵ െ ܷ௟ԡ ൑ ߳, then stop the procedure. Matrix 
ܷ௟ାଵ is the optimal distribution of membership degrees 
of ݔ௞ in clusters ܵ௜. The symbol ԡ ԡ denotes a matrix 
norm. 
 
The steps of the c-means algorithm [2] contain 
expressions, which are explained in turn as: n is a number of 
data points, c is a number of clusters, the value of ߤௌ೔ሺݔ௞ሻ  
stands for the membership degree of ݔ௞ in cluster ܵ௜, 
݀ሺv௜,ݔ௞ሻ indicates the Euclidean distance between the 
cluster centre v௜ and ݔ௞, and constant ݉ ൐ 1 is a weighting 
exponent. 
The Euclidean distance is proved to guarantee a fast 
convergence of the algorithm to final results. We state m = 3 
as the curves, approximating clusters, are smoothest. 
 
The prior determination of the membership degrees in 
U0 plays a crucial role in the c-means algorithm, as their 
choice not only can affect the convergence speed, but also 
may have a direct impact on the results of the classification 
[2][9]. To avoid inaccuracy in final results, we will discuss 
our own technique of calculation of degrees in U0 to avoid 
guessing at their values intuitively. 
III. 
DEGREES IN THE INITIAL PARTITION MATRIX 
To make appropriate evaluations of the membership of 
ݔ௞ in ܵ௜, we adopt the s-class function [10]

in further calculations. 
Surgery prognoses usually can be expressed by “degree 
of surgery” contra “degree of no surgery”, when basing on 
the age, the crp-values and the weight. The linguistic 
degrees of surgery, like, e.g., “little” or “large”, can be 
proposed by a physician as terms of a list L. 
Generally, let us suppose that ܮ ൌ ሼܮଵ, … ,ܮఠሽ is a 
linguistic list consisting of ߱ words, where ߱ is an odd 
integer. Each word is associated with a fuzzy set, also 
named Ls, s = 1,...,߱. Furthermore, let E be the length of a 
common reference set R, containing all fuzzy sets Ls. Let 
ݖאܴ. For instance, R can be recognized as a density set 
between 0 and 100, in which densities about z = 20 belong 
to “little”. We divide the linguistic terms into three groups 
named: a left group, a middle group and a right group. 
The membership functions, assigned to the leftmost 
terms, are parametric functions, which are yielded by (4) as

IV. 
THE SURGERY DECISION FOR 25 PATIENTS 
 
To make a decision about surgery, concerning an 
individual patient in accordance with his/her biological 
markers’ values, we must involve the medical experience in 
the decisive process. In order to facilitate a conversation 
with a physician, we have prepared a list named “The 
primary medical linguistic judgment of surgery grade”= L = 
ሼܮଵ ൌ "none",  ܮଶ ൌ "little",  ܮଷ ൌ "medium",  ܮସ ൌ
"large",  ܮହ ൌ "total"ሽ. The evaluation of no surgery will be 
an inverted surgery term with respect to L. 
The excerpt of the data set, shown in TABLE I, consists 
of the patients’ clinical records and primary linguistic 
estimations of surgery grades. The judgments are made by 
the medical expert. The total medical report contains 25 
gastric cancer patients, randomly selected.

Each verbal expression, being the term of L, is 
associated with a fuzzy set. ܮଵ and ܮଶ represent two left 
fuzzy sets. ܮଷ is the fuzzy set in the middle, whereas ܮସ and 
ܮହ constitute two rightmost fuzzy sets. Unfortunately, these 
linguistic items do not provide us with any information 
about degrees, expected in matrix ܷ଴. To estimate degrees 
of surgery in cluster S1 and degrees of no surgery in cluster 
S2, we have initiated the following enumeration technique. 
By employing (4), (5) and (6) for E = 100 (a typical 
reference set in medical investigations of densities) and ߱ = 
5, we derive the membership functions of Ls, s = 1,…,5. 
Functions Ls are sketched in Figure 1.  
After setting ߙ ൌ 0,ߚ ൌ 50 and γ ൌ 100 in a new s-
function, impacted over set R, we determine 
 
ߤோሺݖሻ ൌݏሺݖ,0,50,100ሻ,

Figure 1. The collection of membership functions generated by (4), (5), (6) 
and (7) 
 
 
Figure 1 helps us to evaluate the degrees taking place in 
the first partition matrix ܷ଴. The second coordinates of the 
intersection points between ߤோሺݖሻ and ߤ௅ೞሺݖሻ, s = 1,…,5, 
will substitute the linguistic structures, filling L. Therefore, 
0.056 is assigned to “none”, 0.22 to “little”, 0.5 to 
“medium”, 0.78 to “large” and 0.944 to “total”. The list L 
can be extended by adding other verbal expressions to it. 
 
After the arrangements of numerical compensations of 
the terms from L, the words in TABLE I are replaced by 
values put in TABLE II.

The relations referring to magnitudes of the final degrees 
for 25 patients, classified for surgery in ܵଵ and for no 
surgery in ܵଶ, have confirmed the primary hypotheses. The 
final verdicts are softer, e.g., “total” is reduced to “large” for 
surgery prognosis, whereas “none” gets a status of “little” 
for no surgery.  
V. 
PATIENT CHARACTERISTIC VALUES 
 
We now generate a set of points (xk, ߤௌభሺݔ௞ሻሻ, ݇ ൌ
1, … , ݊. Let us note that the first coordinates xk do not 
belong to any real-valued xk-axis, since xk have not been 
characterized by any quantity. We thus want to assign a 
characteristic value to each patient xk [12] to be able to place 
xk’s characteristic values in an ascending order.  
 
The patients’ crp-values, the ages and the body weights 
play a significant role in the surgery diagnosis. Let us 
denote the space of the crp-values by CRP = [0, 85], the 
space of ages by A = [0, 100] and express the body weight 
space by BW = [40, 120].  
 
For xk, a characteristic value ݂௫ೖሺ ܿݎ݌௖ ܽ௖ ܾݓ௖ሻ ൌ
ݓ௖௥௣ܿݎ݌௖൅ݓ௔ܽ௖൅ݓ௕௪ܾݓ௖, ܽ௖∈ܣ, ܿݎ݌௖∈ܥܴܲ 
and 
ܾݓ௖∈ܤܹ, k = 1,...,n, [12]. The multipliers ݓ௖௥௣,  ݓ௔ and 
ݓ௕௪ are the importance weights, emphasizing the decisive 
power of each biological parameter for the surgery decision.  
 
To find values of importance weights ݓ௖௥௣,ݓ௔ and ݓ௕௪, 
we present our own procedure, sketched below.  
 
Generally, we compare p parameters to assign 
importance weights to them. A sequence p1>p2>...>pp will 
be thus arranged due to the expert’s opinion, provided that 
“>” is interpreted as “more important than”. We wish the 
sum of all weights wq, q = 1,...,p, to be 1 in accordance with 
 
݌ ·ݎ൅ ሺ݌ െ 1ሻ ·ݎ൅ڮ൅2·ݎ൅1·ݎ ൌ 1 
(8) 
 
where r is a quotient depending on p. Hence, ݓ௤ ൌ
ሺ݌ െݍ൅1ሻ ·ݎ, for q = 1,...,p. 
In the gastric cancer example, the physician determines 
the sequence crp>age>weight, which lets us evaluate 
ݓ௖௥௣ ൌ 0.498,  ݓ௔ ൌ 0.333 and ݓ௕௪ ൌ0.166. 
 
Example 1 
The eighty-one year old man xk, weighing 90 kg and 
revealing crp=16, is given by   ݂௫ೖሺܿݎ݌௖ ܽ௖  ܾݓ௖ሻ ൌ 49.88. 
VI. THE CURVE FITTING FOR  THE POINT SETS  
 
We wish to find a curve, which approximates the set of 
pairs (݂௫ೖሺܿݎ݌௖ ܽ௖  ܾݓ௖ሻ,ߤௌభ
௎యభሺݔ௞ሻሻ , symbolically denoted 
by ቀ݂௫ೖ,ߤሺݔ௞ሻቁ. In the set, the pairs are arranged in 
ascending order of characteristic values ݂௫ೖ. 
In accordance with [7][8] (our earlier procedures), we 
utilize the equation of the truncated ߨ function in the 
process of approximation of point sets, which build the 
pattern of a bell. The classical ߨ-function is limited by 
s(z,α1,β1,γ1=α2) in the left part and 1–s(z,α2=γ1,β2,γ2) in the 
right part, respectively [10]. Its truncated version has no 
intersection points with the z-axis. Without discussing the 
details, which are available in [7][8], we only mention that 
we need three characteristic points to start with the 
approximation. When remembering that ݂௫ೖ, ݇ ൌ 1, … , ݊, are 
ordered in the ascending sequence, we select: 
(f1=min௞ୀଵ,…,௡ሺ݂௫ೖሻ, μ1),  (f2, μ2ൌ max௞ୀଵ,…,௡ሺߤሺݔ௞ሻሻ) and 
(f3=max௞ୀଵ,…,௡ሺ݂௫ೖሻ, μ3). 
 
The coordinates of the points are included into four 
general equations of the truncated π:

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 
We have applied fuzzy 2-means clustering analysis to 
partition a patient data set, containing clinical records of 25

gastric cancer patients, in two fuzzy clusters. These reveal 
the numerical decision of states: “surgery” and “no 
surgery”.  
 
We notice that the patients’ original clinical marker 
values lead to higher membership degrees in the initial 
partition matrix, when comparing them to the lower values 
in the final matrix. This phenomenon can be explained by 
the fact that the decision for an individual patient has been 
made by the assistance of all data filling the data set. This 
means that the medical knowledge provided in the form of 
the collective information, reset numerically, could decide 
“softer” decisions. The obtained results converge to the 
surgery judgments made by physicians from Blekinge 
County Hospital, Karlskrona, Sweden.  
In the second part of the study, we have started with 
the constructions of characteristic values. The values are 
mixtures of clinical measurements and importance weights 
of markers examined. Then the points, characterized by 
coordinates equal to the patient characteristics and degrees 
of surgery, have been surrounded by the curve. The equation 
of this curve may be used to prognosticate a degree of 
surgery for any gastric cancer patient. The approximation by 
the truncated ߨ cumulates a little error for point shapes, 
similar to parts of a bell. The placement of minimal and 
maximal degrees in the graph of the curve, connected to 
“degree of surgery”, agrees with the medical knowledge on 
recommendations of surgery in the cases of gastric cancer 
patients. 
The idea of applying fuzzy set theory to the surgery 
decision is a pioneer in the field of medical applications of 
mathematics. Therefore, we cannot compare our effects to 
similar contributions, made in this domain. In spite of that, 
the physicians, cooperating with us, have confirmed the 
reliability of mathematical models.  
Apart from applications of ready-made algorithms, like 
the c-means method, we have introduced our own earlier 
and newer mathematical models to this medical example. 
The membership function families, exploiting to determine 
the initial membership degrees in the partition matrix, have 
been an efficient tool in the algorithm. The functions, 
furnished with parameters, allow constructing arbitrary 
linguistic lists containing many verbal judgments. The 
weights of importance have been computed by the action of 
a simple algorithm, specially constructed for this purpose. 
Lastly, the procedure of approximation of point sets, 
resembling the shape of a bell, remains our own substantial 
contribution. Without the equation of the approximating 
curve, we could not make any surgery prognoses for casual 
patients, who do not exist in the testing set of patients. 
Future challenges are also planned. We want to test 
larger samples of patients to open a database of truncated π 
equations, covering the most cases of patient clinical data. 
This may give us a chance to establish the information 
computer centre, making surgery prognoses.
