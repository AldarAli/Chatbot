Abstract— Interactions of soil moisture with plant’s root
system are very important for plant growth. For non-invasive
determination of volumetric soil moisture in a Rhizobox a
microwave system based on transmittance of electromagnetic
waves in the microwave frequency range was developed using
microstrip patch antennas. A Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)
was used to measure the S-parameters at frequency range close
to 5 GHz. A transmission system with microstrip patch
antennas was developed. The result of this attenuation is in the
frequency domain. The antennae were designed resonant
microstrip antennae. The antennas were placed on both sides
of a rhizobox, which allows measuring non-invasively soil
moisture in the box. The attenuation (S12(dB)) was used to
measure the effect of temperature in different kinds of soils.
Sensitivity, reproducibility and repeatability were evaluated as
well. This works presents quantitative results of soil moisture
in rhizobox. The microwave technique, using microstrip patch
antennas, is a reliable and accurate system, and showed very
promising
potential
applications
for
rhizobox-based
investigations of root performance.

INTRODUCTION
New tools or approaches are considered important to
investigate and evaluate soil-water-plant interactions in the
plant phenotyping investigations [1]. A central parameter
determining root system response to water availability is
that water is usually not homogeneously distributed in the
soil and the heterogeneity significantly increases when
drought stress occurs. Thus, the development of non-
invasive instruments and sensors to measure soil moisture
distribution would open up new approaches to investigate
plant strategies to deal with low water content or, in
particular, heterogeneities in water availability of soils
during periods of drought cycles.
Electromagnetic soil water content sensors are now
widely accepted
for soil
water
content determination
because these sensors allow continuous, fast, stable, and
nondestructive sensing of the spatial-temporal dynamics of
soil water content at the lab and field scale [2].
From the electromagnetic point of view, the soil-plant-
water set is considered a mixture of four dielectric
compositions consisting of air, soil volume, bound water,
and free water and roots. A water molecule attached to the
soil
interacts
with
an
incident
electromagnetic
wave
different from the free water molecule, thereby exhibiting a
dielectric dispersion spectrum which is very different from
free water. The dielectric constants in the complex form of
free and bound water are functions of the electromagnetic
frequency (f), the physical temperature (T) and the salinity
(S).
The dielectric properties of the wet soil are characterized
by frequency dependence as a function of dielectric constant
response.
In a soil-plant-water system, the εr values for the soil are
typically between 3 and 5. In water, the values are around
80 and, for the roots of a plant, they oscillate between 42
and 56. The volumetric water contents of the root samples
vary linearly with the volume. The εr of the air is equal to 1.
In this way, relatively small amounts of free water in the
soil will greatly affect its electromagnetic properties [3][ 4].
For
non-invasive
determination
of
volumetric
soil
moisture (θV) a microwave system based on transmittance of
electromagnetic waves in the frequency range close to 5.0
GHz was developed using microstrip patch antennas. The
antennas were placed on both sides of a rhizobox. The
evaluation is made using scattering parameters (known as S-
parameters) describing dispersion and dielectric properties of
a soil-water. In the figure 1(a) is showing the basic principle
of the electromagnetic wave (EM) interactions with the
matter. A block diagram of the system that was developed to
conduct this experiment can be seen in the Figure 1(b).

Calibration curves for four porous media are presented for
two soils, the Nullerde - Einheitserde Typ 0 - Einheitserde-
und Humuswerke, and a peat-sand-pumice substrate -
Dachstaudensubstrat SoMi 513 (Kaktus soil), and Cerrado
soil (tropical soil); and one for glass beads. The results
presented in this work show a potential of using microwave
transmittance technique and microstrip patch antenna for
development
of a
new non-invasive

of
volumetric soil moisture (θV) which will be possible to be
applied for better understanding of roots growth.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A.
Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)
The antennas are connected to Vector Network Analyzer
(VNA) (ZNB 8, Rohde & Schwarz) which is generally used
to generate and measure radio frequency/microwave signal.
Some features about the equipment used: Frequency range
from 9 kHz up to 40 GHz; Wide dynamic range of up to 140
dB and High temperature stability 0.01 dB/°C. Using VNA,
we measured scattering parameters (S-parameters (S21 (dB))
in a frequency range from 4.6 GHz to 5.0 GHz to
characterize transmission of microwaves through a soil with
a resolution of 6 x 10-3 dB.
B.
Design of Microstrip Patch Antenna
The antennas were designed as λ/2-resonant microstrip 
antennas [6] and executed on a circuit board with a 1.5 mm
thickness and a dielectric constant (εr,sub of 4.4). Each
antenna was 15.7 mm wide and 15.4 mm long. The total size
is 25.0 x 25.0 x 1.5 mm3. Such a design allows working at
frequencies close to 4.8 GHz. Figure 2 is presents the picture
of the microstrip antenna design to microwave range.

C.
Rhizobox
The rhizobox were made out of PVC and Plexiglas (εr ~ 
2.6) and PVC (εr ~ 2.9) with walls of about 5.0 mm in 
thickness, a length of 315.0 mm and a width of 200.0 mm.
The internal space for the porous media samples is 20.0 mm.
D.
Measurement of reproducibility and repeatability
(Dielectric Constant vs Attenuation)
The two chemical solutions used were 1,4-Dioxane
(C4H8O2)
and
2-Isopropoxyethanol
((CH3)2CHOCH2CH2OH), abbreviated as i-C3E1. The
objective was to make an “ideal solution” by combining
water (εw= 79 (1.2 GHz)) and another liquid fully miscible in
water. Dioxane is a strong solvent with a low flash point and
a high volatility.
The mixtures, values and relative complex dielectric
permittivity parameters are derived from [7]. The real and
imaginary part of the complex dielectric permittivity of the
reference liquids were described by the Cole-Cole model [8].
The model can be seen in the equation (1):
The ε represents the complex dielectric permittivity, 
while εs [-] and ε∞ [-] are the permittivity at frequencies f
much lower and much higher than the relaxation frequency
frel [Hz], respectively, α [-] is the dispersion factor for the 
relaxation time (0<α<1), σ [S m-1]
is
the
electrical
conductivity and ε0 is the free space permittivity.

Calibration Curve
Each sample was prepared to have the same bulk density
(ρb) of a dry soil and its different volumetric soil moisture, 
θV(%). We used three different porous media (PM): 
Nullerde
(Einheitserde
Typ
0,
Einheitserde-
und
Humuswerke Gebr. Patzer GmbH & Co. KG), peat-sand-
pumice substrate (Dachstaudensubstrat SoMi 513, Hawita
GmbH, Vechta, Germany) and glass beads (particles size ～
0.5 mm). The soil used in these experiments was the
dystrophic Red Latosol/Oxisol (Cerrado - Brazil (ρb = 1.19
g/cm3)). The ρb, during the experiments were about 0.28 
g/cm3, 0.59 g/cm3 and 1.40 g/cm3, respectively. The
experiments were made under laboratory conditions at
temperature of about 25.0 ± 0.5 °C and relative humidity of
~30.0%.
Additionally,
we
measured
influences
of
temperature for Nullerde soil under climate controlled
environment at temperature range from 13.0 ± 0.5 °C to 39.0
± 0.5 °C.
The equation 2 can be used to calculated the volumetric
soil moisture (θV(%)):

where: VH2O is the volume of the water (cm3); Mds is the
weight of the dry soil (g); ρss is the dry soil density (g*cm-3)

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A.
Evaluation of reproducibility and repeatability of the
system developed
The aim of this experiment was to correlate attenuation
values received from the rhizobox with the concentration of
chemical
organic
solution
placed
for
analysis.
This
experiment aimed to correlated the dielectric permittivity
constant of certain concentrations of organic chemical
solutions (in this case mainly 2-isopropoxyalcohol) with the
microwave attenuation values. The results clearly show a
relation between the two variables – mainly which as the
dielectric permittivity increases, so does the attenuation. The
graph
demonstrating
the
percentage
of
reliability
of
reproducibility and repeatability shows that this same
experiment should theoretically be possible to perform in any
circumstance, resulting in the same values.
Figure 3. The repeatability and reproducibility of the system
developed were calculated. The measurement was carrying out
three times to each dot (n=3). The red dots represent the
reproducibility (98.9%) averages and the black dots represent the
repeatability (93.0%) averages.
B.
The influence of temperature during the measurement
of volumetric soil moisture (θV(%)). 
The influence of temperature (°C) is an important
parameter in the measurement of soil moisture. In the figure
4 has been shown the influence of temperature during the
measurement of volumetric soil moisture of the Null Erde
sample. The situation is dramatically changed when PM has
high amount of water. The ΔT (°C) was equal 26.0 ± 0.5 °C 
and the maximum variation of S21(dB) was 35.3% to θV 
(%) = 45.0%.
Figure 4.The influence of temperature in the measurement of θV 
(%) using the attenuation (S21 (dB)). The porous media used was
Null Erde and the temperature set up to this experiment was
between 13.0 ± 0.5 °C to 39.0 ± 0.5 °C.

C
Influence of salty water in the measurement.
Dissolving of salts leads to increasing of conductivity
which has a major effect to the attenuation of the transmitted
signal. To take into account and separate influence of water
and salts/nutrients in a soil it is necessary to measure the
resonance frequency shift of the antennas together with
attenuation.
D
The calibration curve and modeling of volumetric
soil moisture (θV(%)) in function of S21(dB). 
Therefore, different calibration curves are needed for
different PM. Calibration curves were obtained by measuring
S21-parameter (dB), which reflects transmission of EM
waves. Measuring the attenuation of transmitted signal we
obtained clear dependence of θV (%) on S21 (dB). The 
dependence tends to be comparable for different PM when it
is relatively dry, below 20.0 % of θV(%), and has a small 
dependence of bulk density, as well the soil physical and
chemical properties of each PM, mainly the typical tropical
soil (Cerrado soil).
The curve obtained to four (04) samples (Cerrado Soil,
Null Erde, Kaktus Soil and Glass Beads) is shown in the
figure 6 and the equation the table (2):
Figure 7 is shows the preliminary results of the
measurement of S21(dB) attenuation of volumetric soil
moisture in the rhizobox, during the time (16 days:21hr:17
min). The sample is a Katus soil with maize. The experiment
was organized to obseve the attenuation of soil moisture
during the time of the roots growth. The measurement was
taken in the lab conditions (T=24,3 ± 1,1 C and RU=62,8 ±
5,0 %) during the morning, the afternoon and the night to
measure the behaviour of the water.

CONCLUSION
From the measured results, it is possible to conclude that
the
developed
non-invasive
microwave
method,
using
microstrip antennas, is an innovative sensing method to
measure the water status in rhizobox filled with soil. This
can be used to investigate the growth of plant roots together
with soil physics properties. This kind of approach gives an
opportunity to apply it to study and monitor non-invasive
volumetric soil moisture θV (%) distribution, using rhizobox.
