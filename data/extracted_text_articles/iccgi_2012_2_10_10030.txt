Abstract—In this paper, an impulsive control approach is
developed for controlling Chua’s circuits that are generalized
into rule-wise linear computational verb systems, which are
used to approximately segment the dynamics of Chua’s circuits
into four qualitatively different patterns. Based on the new
systems, several theorems are then presented to ﬁnd conditions
under which the chaotic Chua’s circuits can be asymptotically
controlled to the origin by impulsive control. One example is
provided illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
Keywords-Computational verb system; Chua’s circuit; rule-
wise linear system.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since Yang presented computational verb concept in 1997
[1], [2]. computational verb theory has been successfully
applied to many industrial products, such as visual card
counters [3], visual ﬂame detecting system [4], and so on.
The building blocks of computational theory are computa-
tional verbs [5], [6], which are applicable to different kinds
of control problems [7], [8].
A rule-wise linear computational verb system consists of
a set of computational verbs of which the antecedents are
conditions speciﬁed by using computational verbs and the
consequences are linear dynamic systems [6]. In [9], the
author presented the structure of verb proportional-integral-
derivative (PID) controllers. Robust stability and stabiliza-
tion of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems that were presented
in [10], were analyzed in [6]. Yang designed an asymptot-
ically stable rule-wise computational verb controller for a
class of high-order systems based on inverse solutions of
Lyapunov equations in [11]. In [8], Tonelli and Yang used a
computational verb controller to control the chaotic Chua’s
circuits based on rule-wise linearization and designed the
controller through linear matrix inequalities. However, in
their work, the closed-loop control system is constructed by
a continuous input control method which is not available for
the development of digital control devices.
This paper is devoted to providing an alternative and
novel approach that combines computational verb control
methodology with impulsive control for controlling a class
of chaotic systems. The computational verb rule-wise linear
models of Chua’s circuits will be used to approximately
segment the dynamics of Chua’s circuits into those dynamics
in the inner region, in the outer region and at boundaries of
both regions. Instead of state feedback controllers for each
subsystem, impulsive controllers are introduced and may
offer a simple and efﬁcient method to deal with systems
based on the development of digital control devices which
generate control impulses at discrete moments [12]. One
numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of
the approach.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II gives some deﬁnitions of computational verb and verb
similarity. Section III develops the rule-wise model for the
Chua’s circuit. Section IV presents the main results for
controlled Chua’s circuit under computational verb rules. In
Section V, an example is provided to show the effectiveness
of the main results. Conclusions appear in Section VI.
Throughout this paper, we use the following notations. ℝ𝑛
denotes the 𝑛-dimensional real space. ℤ represents the set of
positive integer numbers. 𝐴T and 𝐴-1 denote the transpose
and inverse of matrix 𝐴, respectively. 𝜆max(𝐴) denotes the
maximum eigenvalue of the real symmetric matrix 𝐴.
II. THE DEFINITION OF COMPUTATIONAL VERB AND
VERB SIMILARITY
A. Computational Verb
As stated [9], the deﬁnition of computational verb in
[7] is too complex to be operational in the context of
engineering applications. Here, a light working deﬁnition
of computational verb from [6] is giving as follows.
Computational Verb: A computational verb V is deﬁned
by the following evolving function
EV : 𝕋 × Ω → Ω,
(1)
where 𝕋 ⊆ ℝ and Ω ⊆ ℝ𝑛 are the time and the universe of
discourse, respectively.
B. Verb Similarity
The similarity between verbs (verb similarity, for short) is
of the essential importance to the inference of verb rules [7].

Since there is no crisp deﬁnition of similarity between two
dynamic systems, the verb similarity can be deﬁned based
on many different concerns as addressed in [7].
Verb Similarity: Given two computational verbs V1 and
V2, the verb similarity 𝒮(V1, V2) should satisfy the fol-
lowings.
1) 𝒮(V1, V2) ∈ [0, 1];
2) 𝒮(V1, V2) = 𝒮(V2, V1);
3) 𝒮(V1, V2) = 1 if V1 = V2 almost everywhere, where
V1 = V2 means both computational verbs have the same
evolving function.
III. THE RULE-WISE LINEAR SYSTEMS
In this section, we shall control chaotic dynamics of the
well-known Chua’s circuit [13] whose dynamical behavior
is described by
⎧
⎨
⎩
d𝑣1
d𝑡 =
1
𝐶1 [𝐺(𝑣2 − 𝑣1) − 𝑓(𝑣1)],
d𝑣2
d𝑡 =

𝐶2 [(𝑣1 − 𝑣2) + 𝑖𝐿],
d𝑖𝐿
d𝑡 = − 1
𝐿[𝑣2 + 𝑅0𝑖𝐿],
(2)
where 𝑣1, 𝑣2 and 𝑖𝐿 are the state variables, and 𝐺 = 1
𝑅. The
characteristic of the nonlinear resistor 𝑓(𝑣1) is taken as the
well known piecewise-linear characteristic
𝑓(𝑣1) = 𝐺𝑏𝑣1 + 1
2(𝐺𝑎 − 𝐺𝑏)(∣𝑣1 − 𝐸∣ − ∣𝑣1 + 𝐸∣),
where 𝐺𝑎, 𝐺𝑏 < 0, 𝐸 > 0 is the breakpoint voltage.
Assuming 𝑣1 ∈ [−𝑑, 𝑑], 𝑑 ≫ 𝐸 > 0, we obtain the
following sector to bound 𝑓(𝑣1) :
𝑓1(𝑣1) = 𝐺𝑎𝑣1,
𝑓2(𝑣1) =
(
𝐺𝑏 + (𝐺𝑎 − 𝐺𝑏)𝐸
𝑑
)
𝑣1 ≜ 𝐺1𝑣1.
Based on impulsive control, the state equations of the
control Chua’s circuit is given by

(3)
where Δ𝑣(𝑡)∣𝑡=𝑡𝑘 = 𝑣(𝑡+
𝑘 ) − 𝑣(𝑡−
𝑘 ), 𝑘 ∈ ℤ. Here, 𝑥(𝑡+
𝑘 ) =
lim
ℎ→0+ 𝑥(𝑡𝑘 +ℎ), 𝑥(𝑡−
𝑘 ) = lim
ℎ→0+ 𝑥(𝑡𝑘 −ℎ) with discontinuity
instants 𝑡1 < 𝑡2 < ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ < 𝑡𝑘 < ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , lim
𝑘→∞ 𝑡𝑘 = ∞, where
𝑡1 > 𝑡0. For convenience, let 𝑡0 = 0 and ℎ > 0 be
sufﬁciently small. Without loss of generality, it is assumed
that 𝑥(𝑡𝑘) = 𝑥(𝑡−
𝑘 ) = lim
ℎ→0+ 𝑥(𝑡𝑘 − ℎ). 𝑏1𝑘, 𝑏2𝑘 and 𝑏3𝑘 are
the impulsive control coefﬁcients.
Choose two membership functions:
{
𝜇in(𝑡)
=
max(0, 1 − ∣𝑣1/2∣),
𝜇out(𝑡)
=
min(1, ∣𝑣1/2∣),
(4)
where 𝜇in(𝑡) and 𝜇out(𝑡) are for ’inner’ region and ’outer’
region, respectively. Then the state space of Chua’s circuit
is segmented into an ’inner’ region, where ∣𝑣1∣ is not bigger
than 𝐸, and an ’outer’ region, where ∣𝑣1∣ is bigger than
𝐸. Denoting 𝑥T(𝑡) = [𝑣1, 𝑣2, 𝑖𝐿]T as the state vector
and following the similar design procedure presented in
[8], the closed-loop control system based on computational
verb rules can be transformed into the following region-wise
systems.
Rule 1: If ∣𝑣1(𝑡)∣ stays at the inner region, then
{ ˙𝑥(𝑡)
=
𝐴1𝑥(𝑡), 𝑡 ∕= 𝑡𝑘,
Δ𝑥(𝑡)
=
𝐵1𝑘𝑥(𝑡𝑘), 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑘,
(5)
Rule 2: If ∣𝑣1(𝑡)∣ increases from the inner region, then
{ ˙𝑥(𝑡)
=
𝐴2𝑥(𝑡), 𝑡 ∕= 𝑡𝑘,
Δ𝑥(𝑡)
=
𝐵2𝑘𝑥(𝑡𝑘), 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑘,
(6)
Rule 3: If ∣𝑣1(𝑡)∣ decreases from the outer region, then
{ ˙𝑥(𝑡)
=
𝐴3𝑥(𝑡), 𝑡 ∕= 𝑡𝑘,
Δ𝑥(𝑡)
=
𝐵3𝑘𝑥(𝑡𝑘), 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑘,
(7)
Rule 4: If ∣𝑣1(𝑡)∣ stays at the outer region, then
{
˙𝑥(𝑡)
=
𝐴4𝑥(𝑡), 𝑡 ∕= 𝑡𝑘,
Δ𝑥(𝑡)
=
𝐵4𝑘𝑥(𝑡𝑘), 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑘,

where

Therefore, the overall expression of the rule-wise linear
computational verb systems (5)-(8) is given by

𝒮𝑖(𝑡), 𝑡 = 𝑡𝑘,
(11)
where 𝒮𝑖(𝑡) is the computational verb similarity between
waveform 𝑣1(𝑡) and the computational verb in the antecedent
of the 𝑖th computational verb rule.
To calculate the computational verb similarities 𝒮𝑖(𝑡)
(𝑖 = 1, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 4), it follows from the methods presented
in [9] that the canonical forms of verb become’s for
verb rules in (5)-(8) are given by become𝑖, 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4,

Let 𝑇𝑤 be the length of the window and at mo-
ment 𝑡 let us consider the history of dynamics during
the period of [𝑡 − 𝑇𝑤, 𝑡], then the evolving function of
become𝑖(state 1, state 2) is given by:
If state 1 ∕= state 2, then
Ebecome𝑖(state 1, state 2)(𝜏) =

2 , 𝑡
]
;
(13)
otherwise,
Ebecome𝑖(state 1, state 2)(𝜏) ≡ 1, 𝜏 ∈ [𝑡 − 𝑇𝑤, 𝑡].
(14)
Now, denote Ebecome(𝑡) ≜ E(state 1,state 2)(𝑡), and the
implementations for verb rules (5)-(8) are given by the
following steps.
1) The ﬁrst half window
𝑎1 ≜
∫ 𝑡−𝑇𝑤/2
𝜏=𝑡−𝑇𝑤
Ebecome(𝜏) ∧ 𝜇state 1(𝑣1(𝜏))d𝜏,
𝑏1 ≜
∫ 𝑡−𝑇𝑤/2
𝜏=𝑡−𝑇𝑤
Ebecome(𝜏) ∨ 𝜇state 1(𝑣1(𝜏))d𝜏.
(15)
2) The second half window
𝑎2 ≜
∫ 𝑡
𝜏=𝑡−𝑇𝑤/2
Ebecome(𝜏) ∧ 𝜇state 2(𝑣1(𝜏))d𝜏,
𝑏2 ≜
∫ 𝑡

Ebecome(𝜏) ∨ 𝜇state 2(𝑣1(𝜏))d𝜏.

.
(17)
4) The entire window
𝒮(become, 𝑣1(𝑡)) = 𝑎1 + 𝑎2
𝑏1 + 𝑏2
𝜛.
(18)
Consequently, 𝒮𝑖(𝑡), 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4, are calculated by
𝒮𝑖(𝑡) = 𝒮(become𝑖, 𝑣1(𝑡))𝛿𝑖(𝑣1(𝑡)), 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4,
(19)
where
𝛿1(𝑣1(𝑡)) = 𝛿2(𝑣1(𝑡)) =
{
1,
if ∣v1(t)∣ ≤ E,
0,
otherwise.
𝛿3(𝑣1(𝑡)) = 𝛿4(𝑣1(𝑡)) =
{
1,
if ∣v1(t)∣ > E,
0,
otherwise.
(20)
Note that 𝒮𝑖(𝑡), 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4, are also computational verb
similarities.
IV. MAIN RESULTS
Now we are arriving at presenting our main theorems
for guaranteeing the stability of the impulsively controlled
Chua’s circuit under computational verb rules. Based on
the Lyapunov function 𝑉 (𝑡) = 𝑥T(𝑡)𝑃𝑥(𝑡) and impulsive
control theory, we obtain the following criteria.
Theorem 1: Let 𝑛 × 𝑛 matrix 𝑃 be symmetric and
positive deﬁnite, and 𝑄 = 𝑃𝐴𝑖 + 𝐴T
𝑖 𝑃, 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 𝜆1 is the largest eigenvalue of 𝑃 −1𝑄, 𝜆2 is the largest
eigenvalue of the matrix 𝑃 −1(𝐼 + 𝐵𝑖𝑘)T𝑃(𝐼 + 𝐵𝑖𝑘), where
𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 𝑘 ∈ ℤ, then the origin of impulsive control
system (11) is asymptotically stable if there exists a 𝜉 > 1
and a differentiable at 𝑡 ∕= 𝑡𝑘 and nonincreasing function
𝐾(𝑡) ≥ 𝑚 > 0 which satisﬁes

where 𝛿1 = sup
𝑘
{𝑡2𝑘+1 − 𝑡2𝑘} < ∞, 𝛿2 = sup
𝑘
{𝑡2𝑘 −
𝑡2𝑘−1} < ∞, and for a given constant 𝜀 > 0, 𝑡2𝑘+1 − 𝑡2𝑘 ≤
𝜀(𝑡2𝑘 − 𝑡2𝑘−1), ∀𝑘 ∈ ℤ.
Theorem 2: If there exist a symmetric positive deﬁnite
matrix 𝑃, and positive scalars 𝛼𝑘, 𝛽𝑘, such that the following
conditions are satisﬁed.

(

)
< 0,
𝛼𝑘 + 𝛽𝑘 ≤ 0, 𝛽𝑘 ≥ −1,
where 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 𝛿𝑘 = 𝑡𝑘−𝑡𝑘−1, 𝑘 ∈ ℤ, then the origin
of impulsive control system (11) is asymptotically stable.
V. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS
In this section, we shall provide simulation results to
illustrate the proposed method. For simplicity, here we only
illustrate the effectiveness of the criterion in Theorem 1. As
in [8], the parameters for Chua’s circuit (2) are chosen as
𝑅 = 10
7 , 𝑅0 = 0, 𝐶1 = 0.1, 𝐶1 = 2, 𝐿 = 1
7, 𝐺𝑎 = −4,
𝐺𝑏 = −0.1, and 𝐸 = 1. With these parameters, Chua’s
circuit exhibits chaotic dynamics under initial condition
[𝑣1(0), 𝑣2(0), 𝑖𝐿(0)] = [−2.6, −3.2, 1.1] and state 𝑣1(𝑡) will
be bounded in the interval [−15, 15]; therefore, let us take
𝑑 = 15. To control the Chua’s circuit, according to Theorem
1, we set 𝑃 = 𝐼, 𝐾(𝑡) ≡ 1, 𝐵1𝑘 = −0.53𝐼, 𝐵2𝑘 = −0.61𝐼,
𝐵3𝑘 = −0.55𝐼, 𝐵4𝑘 = −0.62𝐼, and 𝜉 = 1.1, which imply
that 𝜆1 = 66.8078, and 𝜆2 = 0.2209, In the simulation, let

thus from (21) we have 0 ≤ 𝛿1 = 𝛿2 ≤ 0.0219. Figure 1
shows the state trajectories of chaotic system (2) under the
designed impulsive control and the computational verb con-
trollers for 𝑡𝑘 − 𝑡𝑘−1 = 0.02. Clearly, the time series of all
the variables of the system converge to zero. Figure 2 shows
the waveforms of computational verb similarity 𝒮𝑖(𝑡) of the
𝑖th computational verb control rule for 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4. Note
that the similarity 𝒮1(𝑡) approaches 0.8571 asymptotically
while the similarity 𝒮2(𝑡) approaches zero at the meantime.
The third and fourth similarities only had non-zero values
at the very beginning and dropped to zero rapidly.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, an impulsive framework for controlling
chaotic Chua system has been proposed through combining
impulsive control technique with intelligent rule-wise com-
putational verb methodology. Based on rule-wise lineariza-
tion, the dynamics of Chua’s circuits are approximately seg-
mented into four regions. Two criteria have been proposed
to guarantee the global asymptotic stability of the compu-
tational verb rule-wise linear systems. The applicability and
validity of the proposed control scheme have been illustrated
through numerical simulations.
