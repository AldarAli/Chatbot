Abstract—Wideband 
filters 
employing 
Operational 
Amplifiers (OP Amps) are required in sensing devices such as 
video cameras for environment sensing. A high-speed low-
voltage Folded-Cascode (FC) OP Amp with a Dynamic 
Switching Bias (DSB) circuit capable of processing video signals, 
which enables low power consumption, high gain with wide 
bandwidths, and a wide dynamic range, was proposed. Through 
simulations, it was shown that the OP Amp with the reduced 3-
V power supply is able to operate at a 14.3 MHz dynamic 
switching rate, allowing processing video signals, and a 
dissipated power of 57 % compared to that in the conventional 
5-V power DSBFC OP Amp while keeping a 0.6 V wide output 
dynamic range. The 2nd-order switched capacitor Low-Pass 
Filter (LPF) and the 4th-order switched capacitor LPF were 
tested as its applications. The response of the former was near 
the theoretical frequency response within frequencies below 5 
MHz. The sample-hold circuit in the latter was optimized 
considering the feed-through phenomenon. The latter showed 
practical level gains in frequencies over 5 MHz within a stop-
band while showing a sharp roll-off near the theoretical 
frequency response within frequencies below 4 MHz. The 
power dissipation of either of these switched capacitor LPFs 
was also reduced to nearly 57 % of that in each switched 
capacitor LPF with the conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP 
Amp.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
This work is an extension of work originally presented in 
SENSORDEVICES 2018 [1]. Wideband filters are essential 
for signal processing in video electronic appliances. 
Specifically, a wideband Low-Pass Filter (LPF) is needed in 
sensing devices such as a CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) 
camera with a monitor handling a wide bandwidth video 
signal of over 2 MHz. The CMOS (Complementary MOS) 
Switched Capacitor (SC) techniques suitable for realizing 
analog signal processing ICs (Integrated Circuits), have 
promising use in video signal bandwidth circuits. It has been 
demonstrated that SC techniques using CMOS Operational 
Amplifiers (OP Amps) are useful for implementing analog 
functions such as filters [2]-[5]. Although CMOS OP Amps 
are suitable for such filter ICs, the use of several OP Amps 
results in large power consumption. Especially, the power 
consumption of OP Amps in high speed operation becomes 
large because they have wideband properties. There is a 
possibility that this causes unstable operation.  
Until now, several approaches have been considered to 
decrease the power consumption of OP Amps, including the 
development of ICs that work at low power supply voltages 
[6][7]. In the two-stage Folded-Cascode (FC) OP Amp 
operating at the low power of 1 V [7], resistive biasing and 
capacitive level shifter are required to increase the output 
voltage swing. The requirement of four resistors for the 
resistive biasing makes it difficult to realize as an IC. A 
clocked current bias scheme for FC OP Amps suitable for 
achieving a wide dynamic range has typically been proposed 
to decrease the power consumption of the OP Amp [8][9]. 
Since the circuit requires complicated four-phase bias-
current control pulses and biasing circuits, it is not suitable 
for the high speed operation and results in a large layout area. 
Recently, the author proposed an FC CMOS OP Amp 
with a Dynamic Switching Bias circuit (DSBFC OP Amp), 
of simple configuration, to provide low power consumption 
while maintaining high speed switching operation suitable 
for processing video signals [10]. This OP Amp operating at 
the 5-V power supply voltage is not necessarily enough for 
use in low-voltage signal processing applications under the 
progress of miniaturization of equipment. That is, the 
development of OP Amps with a still lower power supply 
voltage is expected to decrease their power dissipation. 
 In this paper, a Low-Voltage (LV) DSBFC OP Amp 
with the 3-V power supply voltage [1] is proposed, which 
enables low power consumption and is suitable for achieving 
wide bandwidths and realizing as an IC. The point of view in 
design for architecture and operation of the LV DSBFC OP 
Amp is discussed in Section Ⅱ. Simulation results for 
performance of the LV DSBFC OP Amp are shown in 
Section Ⅲ. As application examples of this OP Amp, its 
practicability for a 2nd-order SC Butterworth LPF and a 4th-
order SC Butterworth LPF is also evaluated in Section Ⅳ.  
Finally, conclusions of this work are summarized in Section 
Ⅴ.

LOW-VOLTAGE DSB OP AMP CONFIGURATION 
Figure 1 shows a configuration of an LV DSBFC OP 
Amp, in which the power supply voltages (±1.5 V) were 
reduced to 60 % of the previous ones (±2.5 V). The DSB 
method is also used for implementing low power

consumption. When the power supply voltage is simply 
reduced, the gain of OP Amps is restrained and their 
bandwidths become low. So, in the newly developed circuit, 
each FET (Field Effect Transistor) size of the LV DSBFC 
OP Amp was optimized to achieve high-speed switching 
operation of 14.3 MHz. This OP Amp has a DSB circuit 
suitable for low power dissipation and an FC OP Amp to 
achieve a wide dynamic range even in low power supply 
voltages. The DSB circuit consists of a bias circuit of M1-M4. 
The FC OP Amp consists of a current mirror of M10-M13 and 
current sources of M8, M9, M14, and M15. The current 
sources M5, M8, and M15 of the FC OP Amp are controlled 
by switching a bias voltage VB of the DSB circuit 
dynamically from VB* to -1.5 V to reduce the power 
consumption still more. Table Ⅰ shows its designed values. 
A minimum channel length of p-MOS FETs and n-MOS FETs 
is 2.5 μm. In order to achieve almost the same 
transconductance gm as that in the conventional 5-V power 
DSBFC OP Amp, a channel width W of M11 and M12 and 
that of M10 and M13, in p-MOS current mirror circuits, were 
increased by nearly fourfold and twofold, respectively. Each 
W of n-MOS current sources M9, M14, M8, and M15 was 
increased by nearly one and a half. The bias voltage of VB* at 
the on state of the FC OP Amp was adjusted to nearly 0 V 
(larger than the conventional one) to decrease W of the current 
source M5 maintaining a high switching speed of the DSB 
circuit. W of M1-M3 was increased by over twofold. W of 
M4 was adjusted to an optimum value. The bias voltage Vb 
of the current source consisting of M9 and M14 was set at 
0.15 V. 
In the DSB circuit, when an external control pulse φB 
driving an inverting switching circuit of M1-M4 is -1.5 V, the 
OP Amp turns on by setting VB at an appropriate level of 
nearly 0 V by enabling M3 and M4 to operate in the 
saturation region, and operates normally as an operational 
amplifier. Conversely, whenφB becomes 1.5 V, the OP Amp 
turns off by setting VB at nearly -1.5 V, enabling M1 to 
operate in a low impedance and M3 in a high impedance. 
This high impedance status of M3 occurs because the gate of 
M3 is set at a potential determined by the capacitive 
coupling between gate and source of M2 and between gate 
and drain of M3 at the transition of φB to 1.5 V. Therefore, 
the OP Amp does not dissipate power at all during this off 
period, which brings about low power consumption. 
III. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
The LV DSBFC OP Amp performance was tested 
through SPICE simulations. The power supply voltages VDD 
and Vss are 1.5 V. Typical performances compared with 
those of the conventional DSBFC OP Amp with a power 
supply of 5 V are shown in Table Ⅱ. The values of 
parameters of open loop gain, phase margin, unity gain 
frequency, slew rate, and settling time are almost the same as 
those in the conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp. As 
the inherent static nonlinearity of the LV DSBFC OP Amp, 
the total harmonic distortion THD for the 10 kHz input 
signal, enabling 0.6 Vp-p to output, was 0.73 %, which is a 
little large compared to the conventional one. However, this 
is less than 1 %.  
The LV DSBFC OP Amp operated in a dynamic switching  
mode with a Duty Ratio (DR) of 50 % and a switching 
frequency, fs, of 14.3 MHz as shown in Figure 2. The output 
sine wave voltage for the input signal of 1 mV was nearly 
equal to that in the static operation mode of this OP Amp. 
Like this, the distortion by the dynamic operation seems to 
be hardly seen. In the dynamic switching operation mode of 
50 % duty ratio, the power dissipation was 9.3 mW, which is 
66 % of that (14.0 mW) observed in the static operation 
mode as shown in Figure 3. This is also 57 % of that (16.3 
mW) of the conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp. This 
shows this OP Amp’s extremely low power consumption 
characteristics due to the reduced effect of power supply 
voltages (60 % of that in the conventional 5-V power

DSBFC OP Amp) and dynamic switching operation.  
The LV DSBFC OP Amp switches dynamically to the 
off state. At this time, though p-MOSFETs M11 and M12 
remain the on-state, MOSFETs M6, M7, M9, M10, M13, and 
M14 change to the on-state weakly. The output terminal of Vo 
of the OP Amp is set at a voltage depending on the load 
capacitance through the capacitive coupling between the 
drain and the gate of the MOSFET M13. So, a large output 
swing in Vo occurs at the off-state transition. A dynamic 
offset voltage Voff (defined as the difference of the on-state 
and the off-state output voltages) at the off-state transition of 
the OP Amp vs. load capacitance CL was tested (Figure 4). In 
small load capacitances less than 1.5 pF, top and bottom 
signal levels of the dynamic off swing do not match. This 
causes distortion at an output signal of the OP Amp. 
Therefore, we can see that the load capacitance CL over 2 pF 
is desirable for its operation. 
IV. 
APPLICATION TO SC LPFS 
To demonstrate the practicability of the above LV 
DSBFC OP Amp, the feasibility of its application to two 
kinds of SC LPFs was investigated.  
A. 2nd-Order SC LPF 
At first, a 2nd-order SC IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) 
LPF with the Butterworth frequency characteristic was tested. 
When a sampling frequency fs=14.3 MHz (equal to four 
times of NTSC (National Television System Committee) 
color sub-carrier frequency 3.58 MHz) and a cutoff 
frequency fc=2 MHz, respectively, were chosen for this LPF, 
the discrete-time transfer function using the z-transform is 
given by (1) [11]. 
 
H1(z) = −
0.11735(1+z−1)2
1−0.82524z−1+0.29464z−2                   (1) 
 
The circuit configuration and operation waveforms 
realizing this transfer function are shown in Figures 5 and 6, 
respectively [11]. This SC LPF was designed referencing an 
SC biquadratic circuit with integrators in the reference [12]. 
It consists of a sample-hold circuit with a holding capacitor 
Cs1 and a CMOS sampling switch controlled by φSH, 
CMOS switches φ1, φ2 for charge transfer, capacitors A-E, 
G, and I, and two LV DSBFC OP Amps (OP Amps 1 and 2). 
In this SC LPF, in order to enable easily to determine the 
capacitance value of each capacitor, the coefficient of A is 
set to be equal to that of B. Capacitors in this SC LPF can be 
basically divided into two groups. In one group (C, D, E, and

G), charges are supplied to OP Amp 1. In another group (A, 
B, and I), charges are supplied to OP Amp 2. Even if a 
capacitance of each capacitor group is multiplied by constant 
times, the transfer function of the SC LPF does not change 
because the multiplication of two capacitor coefficients is 
performed in the numerator and the denominator of its 
transfer function, respectively. Therefore, capacitances of 
integral capacitors B and D are here chosen as a reference 
capacitance in each group and each coefficient of B and D is 
normalized to 1. At this time, 1 for every normalized 
coefficient of A, B, and D is obtained because A and B were 
set to the same coefficient as described above. In Figure 5, 
when the coefficients of A, B, and D are normalized to 1, 
other coefficients are determined in the following. 
 
I=K=0.11735 
 
G=2K+2I=0.4694 
 
C=1+b1+b2=0.4694 
 
E=1-b2=0.70536 
 
Here, b1=-0.82524 and b2=0.29464. When the smallest 
coefficient of I (=0.11735) is replaced as a reference 
capacitance of 0.5 pF, each capacitance in the SC LPF IC is 
set in proportion to the above coefficient as shown in Figure 
5.  
Because an SC LPF’s input signal is desirable to be 
maintained by a sample-hold circuit for stabilizing, this 
sample-hold circuit is applied to the SC LPF. In this case, the 
transfer function is multiplied by the following zero-order 
hold function due to a sample-hold effect. 
 
Hs(jω)=
sin (ωTs/2)
ωTs/2
                                     (2) 
 
Here, Ts represents the one cycle period of sampling pulses. 
Therefore, when the transfer function (1) is replaced using 
z=e𝑗ωTs, the magnitude of the transfer function of the 2nd-
order SC LPF considering the sample-hold effect is given by 
(3). 
 
|H(jω)|=
sin (ωTs/2)
ωTs/2
･|H1(𝑗ω)|                               (3) 
 
Here, |H1(jω)| in (3) is the following function. 
 
|H1(jω)|=
0.2347(1+cos(ωTs))
ඥ1.76783−2.13678 cos(ωTs)+1.65128cos (2ωTs)    (4) 
 
The sampling switch was designed to a channel width / 
channel length W/L=105/2.5 (μm/μm) for each of p-
MOSFET and n-MOSFET. Other CMOS switches were 
designed to 75/2.5 (μm/μm). CMOS switches are turned on 
and off by non-overlapping two-phase clock pulsesφ1, φ2, 
swinging from -1.5 V to 1.5 V. These sampling and CMOS 
switches were designed to have a balanced structure with 
each equal L and W of p-MOS and n-MOS FETs to suppress 
a feed-through phenomenon as much as possible. This 
phenomenon is easy to be caused by a capacitive coupling 
between gate and output terminals. 
Major CMOS process parameters are given as a gate 
insulating film thickness tox=50 nm, a p-MOSFET threshold 
voltage VTP=-0.6 V, and an n-MOSFET threshold voltage 
VTn=0.6 V. 
The operation principle of this SC LPF is as follows. The 
output signal Vo1 of OP Amp 1 is obtained as an additional 
output of an integrated signal of Vin using a negative 
integrator (capacitor D, G SC circuit, and OP Amp 1), an 
integrated signal of Vout using a negative integrator 
(capacitor D, C SC circuit, and OP Amp1), and a signal 
multiplied Vout by E/D. The output signal Vout is an 
additional output of an integrated signal of Vo1 using a 
positive integrator (A SC circuit, capacitor B, and OP Amp 
2), and a signal multiplied Vin by I/B. Vout is basically fed 
back to an input of OP Amp 1 like this. Vin is also integrated 
twice and added after being decreased by an appropriate 
capacitance ratio. Due to these integration using positive and 
negative integrators, addition and feedback operations, the 
function of LPF is achieved. 
The actual operation of the SC LPF is described in the 
following. In this SC LPF, charge transfer operations through 
clock pulses φ1, φ2, are performed during the on-state period 
To of the LV DSBFC OP Amps (when the control pulse φB 
is set at -1.5 V). The off-state period TB (the remaining 
period of the one cycle period Ts) is separately provided to 
realize low power consumption for this SC LPF. An input 
signal Vin is sampled during the sampling phase of φSH (10 
ns) in the on-state period To. After sampling operation, its 
corresponding charge is stored on the holding capacitor Cs1. 
The voltage at the off-state transition of φSH is transferred to 
an output terminal Vout, charging all capacitors, during the 
clock phase of φ1. During the subsequent clock phase of φ2, 
each charge of two capacitors C and G is discharged and 
each charge of remaining capacitors is redistributed. During 
such on-state period of To, the LV DSBFC OP Amps turn on 
by setting a bias voltage of VB at an appropriate level of 
nearly 0 V and operate normally as operational amplifiers.  
Subsequently, φB becomes 1.5 V at the off-state 
transition of the OP Amps, while φ2 is switched off. During 
this off period TB, the OP Amps turn off and so these do not 
dissipate power at all. Therefore, when TB is set relatively 
long as compared to the one-cycle period Ts, the power

consumption of the SC LPF is expected to become lower 
than that observed in ordinary static operation for an SC LPF 
using conventional OP Amps. 
Operation waveforms for an input signal of 1 MHz with 
an amplitude of 0.3 V and an output load of 4 pF are shown 
in Figure 7. In the dynamic switching operation, an output 
load of the LV DSBFC OP Amp increases to nearly 5 pF 
including internal capacitances of the SC LPF. For the pass-
band frequency signal (≦2 MHz), almost the same signal as 
the input one was obtained. The frequency response of the 
SC LPF in the dynamic switching operation of the LV 
DSBFC OP Amp is shown in Figure 8. Figure 9 shows the 
frequency response of the SC LPF in the static operation 
mode of OP Amps. Both frequency responses are almost the 
same. This means that there is almost no gain deterioration 
by employing the DSB operation of the LV DSBFC OP 
Amps. The frequency response was near the theoretical one 
from 100 kHz to near 5 MHz. In the high frequency range 
over 6 MHz, it deteriorated due to a sampling phase effect. 
The gain below -26 dB was obtained at over 6 MHz within 
the stop-band. Though this stop-band gain is not low enough, 
it is expected to be improved by making the roll-off steeper 
through the increase of filter order.

The power dissipation vs. the OP Amp switching duty 
ratio in the 2nd-order SC LPF is shown in Figure 10. The 
power dissipation of the SC LPF itself decreased in 
proportion to the off period TB of the OP Amp. In the 
dynamic switching operation mode of TB=35 ns (DR=50 %), 
the power dissipation of the SC LPF (18.7 mW) was reduced 
to 66.8 % as compared to that in the static operation of the 
OP Amps (28.0 mW). Thus, the dynamic switching 
operation of the LV DSBFC OP Amp is useful for reducing 
the power dissipation of the SC LPF. This power dissipation 
was 56.8 % compared to that in the SC LPF using the 
conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp (32.9 mW). This 
low power characteristic was realized by the low power 
supply voltages and dynamic switching operation.

B. 4th-Order  SC LPF 
As another application example of the above LV DSBFC 
OP Amp, a 4th-order SC IIR LPF with the Butterworth 
frequency characteristic was tested. The high filter order of 
the fourth was selected because it is expected to achieve a 
sharp roll-off gain characteristic. The 4th-order SC LPF was 
designed to achieve a roll-off characteristic with a gain of 
below -30 dB at over 4 MHz within the stop-band. The other 
design condition was set as follows. That is, the sampling 
frequency fs=14.3 MHz and the cutoff frequency fc=2 MHz 
were chosen as the same values as those in the 2nd-order SC 
LPF, that enables it to process video signals. Under this 
condition, the discrete-time transfer function is given using 
the z-transform by (5). That is, (5) can be rewritten like (6) 
considering the independence of two transfer functions. 
 
H2(z) =

H2 (z) = H21(z)･H22(z)                          (6) 
 
The circuit configuration realizing this transfer function 
is shown in Figure 11 [13]. Its operation waveforms are the 
same as those in the 2nd-order SC LPF shown in Figure 6. 
The 4th-order SC LPF was designed referencing a SC 
biquadratic circuit with integrators [12] in the same way as 
the 2nd-order SC LPF. This SC LPF consists of two-stage 
biquadratic circuits cascading two 2nd-order SC LPFs of 
LPF1 and LPF2, provided with a sample-hold circuit with a 
holding capacitor Cs1 and a sampling switch controlled by 
φSH, CMOS switches φ1 and φ2, capacitors A1, B1, C1, D1, 
E1, G1, I1, A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, G2, and I2, and four LV DSBFC 
OP Amps. The transfer function of this SC LPF circuit is 
shown in (7). 
 
H2(z) = (−)

                                                                                          (7) 
 
     The same way of thinking as that in the 2nd-order SC LPF 
is applicable in determining each capacitance of LPF1 (A1, 
B1, C1, D1, E1, G1, and I1) and LPF2 (A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, G2, 
and I2) as well. As shown in (5) and (6), each transfer 
function for the LPF1 and LPF2 is independent of each other. 
Therefore, the normalization of the coefficients in the LPF1 
and LPF2 can be made independently. In Figure 11, when 
the coefficients of A1, B1, D1, A2, B2, and D2 are normalized 
to 1, the transfer function (7) is changed to (8). 
 
H2(z) = (−)

Figure 11. Configuration of the 4th-order SC LPF. 
 
Because the coefficients in (8) are equal to those in (5), other 
coefficients are determined as follows. 
 
I1=K1=0.10573 
 
G1=4K1=0.42292 
 
C1=1+b11+b12=0.42291 
 
E1=1-b12=0.83131 
 
I2=K2=0.13976 
 
G2=4K2=0.55904 
 
C2=1+b21+b22=0.55902 
 
E2=1-b22=0.45516 
 
Here, b11=-0.74578, b12=0.16869, b21=-0.98582, and 
b22=0.54484. When the smallest coefficients of I1=0.10573 in 
the LPF1 and I2=0.13976 in the LPF2 are replaced as a 
reference capacitance of 0.5 pF, each capacitance in the 4th-
order SC LPF IC is set in proportion to the above 
coefficients as shown in Figure 11. A sample-hold circuit is 
also applied in this SC LPF to maintain its input signal for 
stabilizing. At this time, the transfer function (5) is 
multiplied by the zero-order hold function (2) in the same 
way as that in the previous 2nd-order SC LPF. Therefore, 
when the transfer function (5) or (6) is replaced using 
z=e𝑗ωTs, the magnitude of the transfer function of the 4th-
order SC LPF considering the sample-hold effect is given by

as follows considering the feed-through phenomenon.  
Figure 12 shows the gain of the 4th-order SC LPF in the 
DSB mode of the LV DSBFC OP Amp vs. the channel width 
Wsh of each of p-MOSFET and n-MOSFET in the sampling 
switch. The gain of the 4th-order SC LPF became minimum 
at a Wsh of nearly 140 μm when the input signal frequency 
fin is equal to 5 MHz within the stop-band, while its gain 
remains almost unchanged for input signals of 1 and 2 MHz 
within the passband. This is thought to be due to the 
following phenomenon. When Wsh is larger than 140 μm, 
the feed-through via the difference of capacitive coupling 
between gate and output terminals of the above MOSFETs 
does not become negligible at the off-state transition of the 
sampling switch and so the gain corresponding to fin=5 MHz 
increases. When Wsh is smaller than this value, a driving 
ability of the sampling switch becomes insufficient, which 
brings about an increase of the gain. Like this, Wsh of the 
sampling switch is optimized to 140 μm. The feed-through in 
the sample-hold circuit is also dependent on a holding 
capacitance. Figure 13 shows the gain of the 4th-order SC 
LPF in the DSB mode of the LV DSBFC OP Amp vs. the 
holding capacitance. As the holding capacitance Cs1 
increases, the gain corresponding to fin=5 MHz in the stop-
band deteriorates little by little. That is, we can see that a 
smaller capacitance is desirable as Cs1. So, the Cs1 of 1 pF in 
this 4th-order SC LPF was also chosen.  
Other CMOS switches were designed to 75/2.5 (μm/μm), 
which is the same one as that in the 2nd-order SC LPF. In this 
4th-order SC LPF consisting of a cascade connection of two 
different 2nd-order SC LPFs of LPF1 and LPF2 and a 
sample-hold circuit for common use, the operation principle 
is similar to the previous 2nd-order SC LPF  
Operation waveforms for an input signal of 1 MHz with 
an amplitude of 0.3 V and an output load of 2 pF are shown 
in Figure 14. In the 4th-order SC LPF, the output signal 
amplitude nearly close to the input signal was also obtained 
for passband frequency signals. The frequency response of 
the 4th-order SC LPF in the dynamic switching operation of 
the LV DSBFC OP Amps is shown in Figure 15. The roll-off 
characteristic in near 3-4 MHz was greatly improved 
compared to that in the 2nd-order SC LPF. The response was 
near the theoretical one from 100 kHz up to near 4 MHz. At 
4 MHz within the stop-band, the gain below -28 dB was 
obtained. In the high frequency range over 5 MHz within the 
stop-band, although it deteriorated due to a sampling phase

effect, the gain below -31.5 dB (a practical level) was 
achieved. In this way, a wide stop-band with a high 
attenuation (a sharp roll-off characteristic) in the high 
frequency response became possible due to the two-stage 
biquadratic SC LPF configuration with the increased filter 
order of the fourth. Like this, it is clear that the LV DSBFC 
OP Amp is also applicable to the high-order SC LPF. 
The power dissipation vs. the OP-Amp switching duty 
ratio in the 4th-order SC LPF with the 3-V power LV DSBFC 
OP Amps compared to that in the 4th-order one with 
conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amps is shown in 
Figure 16. The power dissipation of the 4th-order SC LPF 
with the LV DSBFC OP Amps itself decreased in proportion 
to the off-state period TB of the OP Amps. In the dynamic 
switching operation mode of TB=35 ns (=50 % switching 
duty ratio) and φ1 =φ2 =15 ns, the power consumption of 
this 4th-order SC LPF (37.4mW) decreased to 66.8 % as

compared to that in the static operation of the LV DSBFC 
OP Amps (56 mW). This value is twice as large as that in the 
2nd-order SC LPF with the LV DSBFC OP Amps (18.7 mW) 
because the 4th-order SC LPF consists of a cascade-
connection of two 2nd-order SC LPFs. However, the power 
consumption of this 4th-order SC LPF with the LV DSBFC 
OP Amps at 50 % switching duty ratio was reduced to 
56.9 % compared to that in the 4th-order SC LPF with 
conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amps (65.7 mW). Thus, 
even when the DSBFC OP Amps are applied to the two-
stage biquadratic circuits of SC LPF, the dynamic operation 
of these LV DSBFC OP Amps enabling low power 
consumption as compared to their static operation is also 
useful for reducing the power consumption of SC LPF. 
Typical characteristics of the  4th-order SC LPF compared 
with those of the 2nd-order SC LPF employing the LV 
DSBFC OP Amps are listed in Table Ⅲ.

CONCLUSIONS  
A high-speed Low-Voltage (LV) Folded-Cascode (FC) 
Operational Amplifier (OP Amp) with a Dynamic Switching 
Bias (DSB) circuit capable of processing video signals, 
which enables low power consumption, high gain with wide 
bandwidths, and a wide dynamic range, was proposed. 
Through simulations, it was shown that the OP Amp with the 
reduced 3-V power supply is able to operate at a 14.3 MHz 
dynamic switching rate, allowing processing video signals, 
and a dissipated power of 57 % compared to that in the 
conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amp while keeping a 
0.6 V wide output dynamic range. The response of the 2nd-
order Switched Capacitor Low-Pass Filter (SC LPF) tested as 
its application was near the theoretical frequency response 
within frequencies below 5 MHz. The power dissipation of 
this LPF was also reduced to 56.8 % of that in the 2nd-order 
SC LPF with conventional 5-V power DSBFC OP Amps. As 
another application of the LV DSBFC OP Amps, the 4th-
order SC LPF was tested to achieve a practical sharp roll-off 
gain characteristic. The roll-off response of this 4th-order SC 
LPF was greatly improved compared to that in the 2nd-order 
SC LPF. At over 5 MHz within the stop-band, a practical 
level gain below -31.5 dB was achieved. The power 
consumption of this 4th-order SC LPF decreased to 56.9 % of 
that in the 4th-order SC LPF with conventional 5-V power 
DSBFC OP Amps. 
Thus, it was confirmed that the 3-V power DSBFC OP

Amp is useful for high speed operation, low power 
consumption, and greatly reducing the power dissipation of 
the SC LPFs. This circuit should be useful for the realization 
of low-power wide-band signal processing ICs. For example, 
it has a possibility of changing current A/D (Analog-to-
Digital) converters, D/A (Digital-to-Analog) converters, and 
active-RC LPFs in CCD cameras into low-power SC circuits 
employing this LV DSBFC OP Amp, and of realizing low-
power SC versions instead of current SC Amps for 
prevention of the deterioration of CCD camera’s output 
signal. It has also applicability to Amps and/or LPFs required 
in various kinds of sensing devices and video equipment. 
Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the performance is 
expected to be improved still more by employing MOSFETs 
with a minimum shorter channel length than 2.5 μm used in 
this work.  
As shown above, although the frequency response was 
improved to a practical level by increasing the filter order, 
there might be a limitation in the filter order, because one OP 
Amp per one order LPF must be used and so power 
dissipation will increase in proportion to the filter order.
