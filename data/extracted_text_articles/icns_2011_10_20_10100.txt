INTRODUCTION
Photonic switching architectures based on 2 x 2 optical
switching elements (SEs) are attractive, since they can be
constructed
from
directional
couplers.
The
directional
coupler switch is a device with two inputs and two outputs,
both of which are optical signals [1]. The state of the device,
as shown in Fig. 1, is controlled electrically by applying
different levels of voltage on the electrodes.
Although other materials can be used as a substrate,
lithium niobate is the most mature technology for directional
coupler-based optical switch fabrication. A feature of these
switches
is
their
ability
to
route
optical
information
regardless of its bit rate or coding format [1]. Several
directional coupler-based architectures had been proposed in
the literature [2][4][6][8]. This hybrid device will be the SE
of the 2x3 network proposed in this paper.
For
a
good
switching
architecture
from
system
considerations, the number of SEs for a given switch size, N,
should be as small as possible [2]. When the number is large,
implementation is expensive and the optical path is subject to
large power loss and crosstalk. When designed to reduce the
SE number in total and in each path, a switch can have a
large internal blocking probability. The internal blocking
should be avoided or reduced. It can be reduced to zero by
using a good switching control or by rearranging the current
switching configuration. These cases are called wide-sense
nonblocking and rearrangeably nonblocking, respectively [3].
If a blocking condition never arises in a switch, it is said to
be strictly nonblocking [3][4].
In this paper, a control algorithm for a 2x3 nonblocking
photonic switch which is derived based on 2x2 SEs is
proposed. The idea behind the proposed algorithm is
presented. The wide-sense nonblocking property of the
switch under this control algorithm is tested and discussed.
The paper is organized as follows; Section II provides an
overview of the 2x3 architecture. We explain how to design
it using planar switches. In Section III, the development of
the
control
algorithm
is
explained.
The
wide-sense
nonblocking property of the switch under this control
algorithm is tested and discussed in Section IV. Section V
concludes the discussion.
II.
THE 2x3 SWITCH
The N-stage planar switch has N/2 odd stages and N/2
even stages. The odd stages are of N/2 SEs each, while the
even stages are of N/2 – 1 SEs each [5]. In general an N x N
network requires N stages, where N may be even or odd. The
total number of SEs is:
SES = N/2(N/2 + N/2 – 1) = N/2(N – 1)
(1)
The maximum number of SEs in a connection path is
obtained when the optical signal crosses a SE in every stage
of the switching system, that is, when it crosses N SEs. Fig.
2 illustrates a 3x3 N-stage planar switch.
An algorithm for deciding whether a given network is
nonblocking or not is described in [7]. Using this algorithm
the 3x3 switch of Fig. 2 was proved to be blocking unless
rearranged [5][7].

shown in Fig. 3. Again, the same algorithm described in [7]
can be used to decide if this switch network is nonblocking.
Because the switch network is simple and small, all its
possible states can be manually studied on paper. However,
both methods lead to the same outcome. That is, the network
is nonblocking in the wide sense if all the states in which SE
A is cross (x) and SE B is bar (=) are avoided. In other
words, if SE A is in the cross state, SE B should not be
allowed to get into a bar state, and vice versa. Such a state,
which can cause blocking for a network, is said to be a
forbidden state. The set of states of a network, that allow any
required switching without bringing the network into a
forbidden state, was called preservable by Benes [3].
If the 2x3 switch is flipped horizontally, as shown in Fig. 4,
the network will be a 3x2 switch with the same nonblocking
rule still applicable.
The preservable state of the 2x3 network is given in Fig.
5a. The state of the last SE does not affect the state of the
network and this is the reason why it is left blank. The
preservable state of the 3x2 switch is shown in Fig. 5b from
which it is clear that neither input 1 nor input 2 should be
connected to output 1 through SE B. The elements of Fig. 3
and Fig. 4 will be called 2W3 and 3W2, respectively. If these
elements follow the algorithms given in Fig. 5, any future
connection
can
always
be
made
without
blocking
or
additional rearrangement of the existing paths.
The 2W3 and 3W2 elements can be used to build a 4x4
wide-sense nonblocking network. The 4x4 network will
consist of two 2W3 switches, three 2x2 switches, and two
3W2 switches as shown in Fig. 6.

The 2W3 and 3W2 elements can also be used, recursively,
to build larger wide-sense nonblocking networks with the
basic 2x2 SE, always, representing the smallest possible
subnetwork.
III. THE CONTROL ALGORITHM DESIGN
The
2W3
switch,
and
all
the
switches
designed,
recursively, based on it, will need a control algorithm to
maintain their wide-sense nonblocking property explained in
the previous section. In this section, a control algorithm is
developed to control the 2W3 switch keeping in mind that
algorithms for controlling larger sizes of switches based on
the 2W3 and 3W2 elements should be addressed separately,
and that the recursive approach is not applicable here.
The number of possible configurations of a switch, of
size N, is given by N!. Thus, the 2x3 switch has 3! = 6
different configurations as shown in Fig. 7 denoted by S1, S2,
S3, S4, S5, and S6. The state of each SE for obtaining these six
configurations is shown in table 1 with “0” used to represent
the bar state and “1” used to represent the cross state.
Figure 7.
Possible configurations of the 3x2 switch
Observing Table 1, it can be noted that the highlighted
states, i.e., state number 5 and state number 6, are the
forbidden ones. These states can be compensated for by state
number 2 and state number 1, respectively, since they give
the same switch configuration for each case.

An algorithm code was written using Visual Basic tool to
control the switch and maintain its nonblocking property.
This tool is event-driven and is governed by an event
processor. When an event is detected, the event procedure
will then be executed [9]. The flow chart of the algorithm
code is shown in Fig. 8. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
was also developed using Visual Basic.
Figure 8.
The flow chart of the algorithm code
As illustrated in the flowchart, one of the routing functions
1, 2, or 3 is called depending on the destination targeted by
each input. Function 1, function 2, and function 3 are
algorithm codes designed to control the state of SE A, SE B,
and
SE
C,
respectively.
Each
function
contains
tow
subfunctions, one for the bar state, and the other for the cross
state, of the corresponding switch. In each subfunction, all
possible relations between the inputs and outputs of the SE
are examined and, then, the route established if, and only if,
it maintains the preservable states of the 2x3 switch as shown
in Fig. 5a.
IV. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, some results obtained after running the
code will be presented and discussed. The following simulate
window which appears when the start button of the start
window is pressed is shown in Fig. 9. Here, the switches A,
B, and C, are shown as Switch1, Switch2, and Switch3,
respectively. These switches are shown without their current
state which will change accordingly when the simulate
button is pressed after a user inputs the destination output
followed by the data as illustrated in Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12,
Fig. 13, Fig. 14, and Fig. 15 for different switching
configurations.
In Fig. 10, the data at input data_1 is routed to output
out_3 through switch 1 and switch 2 which both must be in
the cross state to establish the configuration. If the data from
the same input is to be routed to output out_1 or output
out_2, the switch configuration will look as illustrated in Fig.
11 and Fig. 12, respectively. Note how the forbidden state, in
which switch 2 should be brought into a bar state, was
avoided in the configuration set to establish the new
connection.
Figure 9.
The simulate window of the designed GUI
Figures 13, 14, and 15 present simulation results obtained
when the algorithm was tested for two inputs applied at
parallel to the 2x3 switch. From these figures, of special
consideration is the transition of the switch configuration
from Fig. 14 to Fig. 15. From a control point of view, it was
easier just to change switch 2 into a bar state to reconfigure
Fig. 14 to establish the configuration shown in Fig. 15. If
switch 2 was changed into a bar state, input data_2, would

have been blocked from reaching output out_1, as long as
input data_1 is connected to output out_2 through switch 2.
That is the reason why the control algorithm instead changed
the states of all the switches to avoid the easy, but yet,
forbidden reconfiguration.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
A control algorithm for a 2x3 wide-sense nonblocking
photonic switching network has been proposed, designed,
and simulated. Some simulation results of the proposed
control algorithm are presented and discussed.
The results indicate that the designed algorithm is capable
to maintain the wide-sense nonblocking property for all
possible switch configurations. Algorithms for controlling
larger sizes of switches based on the 2W3 and 3W2 elements
should be addressed separately since the recursive approach
can not be applied. Authors are now working on designing a
control algorithm for the 4x4 optical switch mentioned in
section II.
