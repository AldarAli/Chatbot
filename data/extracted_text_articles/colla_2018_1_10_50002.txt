Abstract—This paper describes the development and the 
evaluation of a collaborative communication system called 
InCircle. One notable trend in the pedagogical field is a shift 
from a teacher-centered learning to a student-centered one. 
Recent advancement of Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) has accelerated the shift. The spread of 
various mobile applications for educational use has enabled us 
to share information and knowledge in real time. In order to 
promote student-centered learning, it is necessary to facilitate 
interaction among learners. For these purposes, InCircle was 
introduced in a university level language and culture class in 
Japan. The objectives of our research study were to examine 
whether InCircle contributes to the facilitation of interaction 
among learners and the enhancement of mutual cross-cultural 
understanding. 
The 
evaluation 
was 
conducted 
in 
an 
international exchange subject where international students 
and Japanese students learn about the language and culture at 
university in Japan. The result of the questionnaire showed the 
learners' preference to InCircle as opposed to the blog comment 
function. It also endorsed its usability and effectiveness as a 
communication tool. 
Keywords- collaborative learning; InCircle; international 
students; international exchange subject; student-centered 
learning. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
In recent years, one notable trend in the pedagogical field 
is that more teachers have moved towards a student-centered 
learning environment. In the course of this shift, student-
centered collaborative learning has drawn much attention 
from researchers in the pedagogical field [1]. Collaborative 
learning has a "social constructivist" philosophical base, 
where learning is regarded as construction of knowledge 
within a social context [2]. It is reported that student-centered 
and small-scale course programs resulted in more academic 
success than lecture-based course program [3]. It is also 
reported that a student-centered collaborative learning is one 
of the most effective ways of learning in language classes [4]. 
In fact, most studies investigating the link between the extent 
to which course programmes are student-centered on the one 
hand and promote academic success on the other hand, find 
positive relationships between the two [2]. 
Recent prevalence of high-performance mobile devices 
has enhanced the potential of learners' active interaction via 
mobile-based communication tools. We have seen a good deal 
of researches on communications applications, such as 
educational application of social network service (SNS) [5]-
[8]. Our communications application project, InCircle, is 
among them. In this study, InCircle was introduced for the 
purpose of facilitating interaction among learners and 
enhancing learning opportunities. 
The rest of the paper consists of the following sections: 
Section 2 explains our developed system, Section 3 explains 
the experiment setup and Section 4 explains the conclusions 
and future works.

INCIRCLE 
InCircle [9] is a product developed by AOS Mobile Inc., 
Tokyo, Japan [10]  with the second author joining this project 
as a chief software architect. It is a client-server application. 
The server side runs on Linux OS and Windows Server. The 
client side is working on iOS, Android, and PC Web browser. 
Chat messages are transmitted and received through the 
network (Figure 1).

The system allows users to create groups. Group members 
are able to send and receive messages and multimedia files in 
their chat room with an easy operation. Chat messages are 
synchronized in real-time to realize smooth communication. 
Figure 2 shows a chat room interface when the instructor 
posted an interrogative sentence: "Do you have textbook 
authorization system in your country?" since interrogative 
sentences trigger active interaction among learners which  
leads to mutual cross-cultural understanding. 
 
In our system, we have mainly four major advantages: 
 
a) 
Teachers can be administrators of the system. 
 
Teachers can be administrators of the system so that they 
can watch the users/their students' behaviors. Therefore, they 
can avoid their students' malicious behaviors via InCircle. In 
case of inappropriate behavior from the part of a student, 
teachers can delete or close the student's account. 
 
b) 
Teachers can pre-register user accounts. 
 
Unlike other SNS or chat tools, such as Facebook and 
LINE, user accounts are pre-registered. Teachers create 
accounts for their students and make a group for the class in 
advance. There are always some students who do not want to 
use the existing SNS systems. In fact, in one of the authors' 
classes, some students rejected to create a Facebook account 
and some students did not want to use LINE. Unless all the 
students agree to use it, it is not appropriate to use it as a 
communication tool in class. Besides, the existing SNS users 
usually post their private information on their profiles. 
However, some students may not wish to share private 
information with some of their classmates. In our system, on 
the contrary, there is no page in the first place to fill in their 
private information, such as school career, birth place/date.

c) 
Security is ensured 
 
Every effort was made in order to ensure the security, such 
as encryption of the cache data in the client terminal, channel 
coding, encryption of database, the use of different 
cryptography keys for each company or school in the server 
side. Therefore, it is highly protected against divulging of 
information or account hacking. 
 
d) 
Users can delete the sent messages. 
 
In our system, we can delete messages after they are sent 
not only on the sender's side but on the recipient's side. It is 
likely to happen that we send messages by mistake. Our 
system can handle such human errors.  
 
Our research questions are: 
(1) Can InCircle contribute to the enhancement of the 
students' mutual cross-cultural understanding? 
(2) Can InCircle contribute to the enhancement of 
interaction among the students? 
 
III. 
EVALUATION 
A. Target class 
The target class was one of "international exchange 
subjects" which was targeted mainly for international 
exchange students. Japanese students who are interested in 
class held in English can also join it.  The class was held 12 
times on a once-a-week-basis in a CALL (computer assisted 
language learning) room during the fall/winter semester, 2017. 
The class language was mainly in English. The objectives of 
the target class were (1) to enhance cross-cultural 
understanding and (2) to improve the skills of their target 
languages, which were Japanese or English. The class 
consisted of 21 students (6 Japanese, 4 Germans, 2 Chinese, 2 
Finnish, 1 British, 1 French, 1 Korean, 1 Macao, 1 Russian, 1 
Taiwanese, 1 Vietnamese). All the participants were owners 
of mobile phones. At the beginning of the semester, they were 
asked to answer the learning style questionnaire created by 
Academic Skills Advice service [11] to identify their preferred 
learning styles.  
B.  Procedures 
InCircle was introduced in class from November 14, 2017 
to January 23, 2018. It was introduced mainly because not all 
the students had the identical SNS accounts, such as Facebook, 
WhatsApp,  LINE, Twitter and so on. 
A class blog was created by the teacher as a 
communication tool. Google Blogger service was used for 
creating the class blog. It was used throughout the semester 
from October 3, 2017 to January 23, 2018. The teacher posted 
contents which were useful for classroom learning as well as 
each class schedule. The mailing list was also created by the 
teacher for the facilitation of class communication. However, 
even though the teacher instructed the students to use a class 
mailing list as a communication tool among classmates, it 
turned out that it did not play any role as a communication tool.

COLLA 2018 : The Eighth International Conference on Advanced Collaborative Networks, Systems and Applications

Therefore, the mailing list was used only by the teacher when 
she needed to share necessary information with the students. 
Towards the end of the semester, when students used to 
both communication tools, i.e., InCircle and Blogger, close 
examination was made on how the students used them as 
communication tools during the class held on January 9th, 
2018. For the enhancement of the mutual cultural 
understanding, the teacher posted theme topics on both sites. 
Since it was a class held right after the new year holidays and 
for most of the students, it was their first new year holidays in 
Japan, the topic was new year holidays: "Did you find 
something special for お正月(New Year)?" on Blogger site 
and "How do you celebrate new year holidays in your 
country?" on InCircle. The students were instructed to post 
comments on both media. They were informed that their 
posting would affect their grades. 
 
C. The Results 
Table 1 shows the number of posts in InCircle talk room 
and the blog comment columns. The number of posts on 
InCircle was 26, while that of Blogger was 14. The number of 
the participants on January 9th' class was 20. The number of 
the students who posted comments on InCircle was 18, while 
those on Blogger was 8. As the number of the post shows, the 
students were more active in posting messages on InCircle.

Tables II and III show the participants' comments reacting 
to the teacher's questions via both media.  Figure 3 shows the 
interfaces of both media. As for Blogger comment function, 
its users cannot post multimedia files so that the information 
they could get was only text-based. 
One notable phenomenon for InCircle was an interaction 
among students, which did not happen in Blogger's comment 
column. One comment (No.15) posted by Student #13 
triggered Student #4's question (No.18), which was answered 
by Student #13 (No.21), which triggered Student #17's photo 
post (No.22). This interaction ended with Student #4's post 
showing her gratitude (No.24) as shown in Table III. 
Apparently, InCircle promoted the interaction among students. 
On the contrary, when the teacher posted a question in 
Blogger site, Did you find something special for お正月 
(oshogatsu: New Year), 8 students posted comments in the 
comment column. This topic was expected to stimulate the 
students’ interactions since for the most students, the new year 
2018 was their first new experience in Japan, and in fact, new 
year holidays are the most special holidays in Japan. There 
must have been many things new to them. But unlike the 
teacher’s expectation, one student’s post did not lead to 
another students’ reaction. They just answered to the teacher's 
question (Table II).

  At the end of the phase, they were asked to answer the 
five-point-scale-questionnaire as shown in Table IV. Q1 and 
Q3 were created based on the technology acceptance model 
proposed by [12]. Q2 was created to examine the fun factor of 
our system. Q4 and Q5 were created to examine its 
contribution to the class objectives. Q6 and Q7 were created 
for examining the user acceptance of its interface and the

Figure 4.  Which was easier to handle? 
The highest score, 4.4 was given when they were asked 
about the usability of the system (Q.1). As some students felt 
it was like other existing apps (as in comments #2, 9 and 13 in 
Table 5), most students had already used other similar apps, 
which lead to the high score of the usability of InCircle. The 
lowest score, 3.2 was given when they were asked if it was 
helpful for their target language learning (Q.5). Since it was a 
basic rule in 'International Exchange Subjects' to run the class 
in English, the language in InCircle was mostly English. 
Therefore, it was helpful for English language learners (6 
students), but it was not so helpful for Japanese language 
learners (15 students). Since the improvement of their target 
language skills is one of the class objectives, it is our next 
work to consider how our system can be utilized for the 
language learning including its contents. The average scores 
of its fun factor (Q2), its interface (Q6) and the whole system 
(Q7) were 3.9, 3.8 and 3.7. which we consider them passable 
enough so that no urgent refinement is necessary.  
Figure 4 shows the result of the question: which one was 
the easier to handle, InCircle or Blogger site? two thirds (14 
out of 21) of the students felt InCircle was easier to handle. 
This implies that the majority felt that the Blogger site was 
more complicated to write comments in than InCircle. It was 
in line with the high score of Table 4 Q1.  
 
D. Discussion 
Our research questions were (1) Can InCircle contribute to 
the enhancement of the students’ mutual cross-cultural 
understanding? (2) 
Can InCircle contribute to the 
enhancement of interaction among the students? As for (1), it 
can be said safely that our system contributed to enhancement 
of mutual cross-cultural understanding because of the fact that 
the average point of Q.4 (Was it helpful for understanding 
Japanese culture and other cultures?) was as high as 4.3. In 
traditional teacher-centered lecture style class, it is difficult for 
the students to learn from other students. For instance, they 
could learn how to celebrate New Year in other countries by 
using InCircle. As for (ii), even though the average point of 
Q.3 (Was it helpful as a means of communication with your 
classmates and teacher?) was 3.7, not as high as expected,  
more students used InCircle than Blogger comment column 
and the number of postings via InCircle outnumbered Blogger 
comments (Table I). Therefore, it can safely be said that our 
system contributed to enhancement of interaction among the 
students. Since other SNS tools, such as Facebook, LINE, 
twitter have some weaknesses as a communication tool for 
classroom use as mentioned earlier, InCircle is expected to be 
an effective communication tool in student-centered 
collaborative learning class.

It could get a little disorganized with so many people in

#12 
Good Experience 
#13 
I think it is like the application, "LINE" or "Skype". 
#14 
It was refreshing and fun! New style! 
#15 
I'm not sure how exactly I would benefit from using the 
site. It is nice and all, but we did not use it that much in 
class so that I would have gotten a clear understanding in 
what kind of situations it would be helpful. Connecting 
with teacher is for me done by email or in person, and 
classmates you would use whatever social media app is 
popular atm, email or in person. 
#16 
There is, in my opinion, no need to use it. It provides you 
with an easy opportunity to communicate with class 
members and the teacher but there is no need for 
communication. This class is about computers in 
language learning, and in my opinion sharing with others 
is not the primary way of achieving that. Therefore, I am 
just not interested in using these kind of programs. 
#17 
Very useful! 
 
There are two clearly negative comments: #15 and #16 
which seem non-negligible. The result of the learning style 
questionnaire which was conducted at the beginning of the 
semester, showed their preference of "learning alone" to 
"learning in a group". There might be a possibility that their 
negative attitude toward group learning reflected their 
negative comments on InCircle. This is not directly connected 
with the effectiveness of the system itself, but how to deal with 
those students who prefer "learning alone"  is an important 
issue to cope with for an implementation of a successful

aspects as described in Discussion section. The questionnaire 
results showed that the students were satisfied with its 
usability. Our hypotheses (research questions (1) and (2)) 
were proved to be correct. However, it was found out that our 
system was not supportive for their target language learning. 
Since it is one of the two objectives of the target class, it is 
necessary to consider how to introduce InCircle from the 
pedagogical viewpoint in order to support their language 
learning. It is among our future works to find out some 
solutions to improve the skills of their target languages via 
InCircle. In addition, even though it does not concern our 
system itself, there are some students who are not keen on 
collaborative learning. How to get those students involved in 
collaborative learning is another issue to tackle in the future.
