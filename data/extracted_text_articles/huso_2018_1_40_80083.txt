Abstract — The use of Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) in education is a relevant research topic. 
With the improvement of technology, the use of mobile phones 
by students is more and more common in the classroom, 
enabling an appropriate environment for mobile learning (M-
learning) through the 'bring your own device' method 
(BYOD). Mobility is needed when trying to develop digital 
media tools. This paper analyzes how art and music students in 
the context of Brazilian high school technical education can be 
motivated towards supplementary research through these 
support technologies in order to build and optimize their own 
Musical Arts knowledge and skills. The primary objective is to 
guide teachers in using applications as a tool in the teaching 
and learning process. 
Keywords - Mobile learning; Technology; Music Education; Art; 
Education.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recent changes in Brazilian educational rules introduced 
through Law 11.769/2008 [1] require all Brazilian schools 
to offer music classes. To overcome the challenges of 
enhancing Musical Arts and music education, Brazilian 
Federal Institutions, which are a network of federal 
technical and technological schools distributed throughout 
the country, are striving to provide their staff and teachers 
with specific training in music. 
Additional challenges within this context include: a need 
for innovation in educational resources and methods, better 
communication with the local art and media production 
sectors and support for students in their needs as a young 
generation. 
Examples 
include 
M-Learning, 
Distance 
Learning (DL), the use of recent technologies, especially in 
ICT and their application in M-learning and the promotion 
of autonomous research, as well as the development of 
didactic tools and resources. 
In 
consideration 
of 
contemporary 
educational 
opportunities and challenges, the goal of this paper is to 
provide guidance and motivation to the Federal Institute of 
Education, Science and Technology of Tocantins - Palmas 
Campus, so that teachers and students of Musical Arts may 
expand the application of technological and didactic tools to 
improve their skills in information and communication 
resources for a more effective teaching and learning process. 
This paper lays out the process of producing a mobile 
application 
using 
current 
and 
publicly 
available 
technologies to support the teaching and learning process in 
Musical Arts, including suggestions for integrating student 
training within technical education, at the Federal Institute 
of Tocantins. 
An important objective is to make the contents of the 
subject more attractive to the students and to prompt the 
students to deepen their Musical Arts knowledge. This 
involves audio and video examples, exploring technological 
aspects as supportive and motivational tools for learning the 
content presented in the classroom, including an engaging 
theoretical basis, creative exercises to help assimilate 
contents, and complementary research. 
To achieve educational results in the exploratory field of 
new teaching techniques, the challenges of mobility must be 
solved, since, without mobility, all the efforts employed in 
the elaboration of digital media will have been in vain.      
Considering that the method of access to the didactic 
contents defined was through BYOD, this required 
compatibility of a great diversity of devices in order to 
choose the final tool that was made available to students. 
In order to address this subject and report on the 
experience, this paper is divided into the following parts: in 
Section II, relevant related work on the topics of mobility 
and education is presented; in Section III, we discuss the 
research paper proposal, with specifications of materials and  
methods; in Section IV, the results of the research are 
presented, through the analysis of the data collected; in 
Section V, the results and the possibilities of future work are 
indicated, highlighting the acute use of technologies relative 
to youth behavior, as well as the application of the App to 
other subject areas.

RELATED WORK 
Magalhães [2] addresses the challenges of Internet use in 
the present educational context, since the current generation 
was born in a technological era. 
Chen [3] points out that even in Asia, where technology 
is quite advanced, music teachers have three particular 
concerns about the use of technology in music classes: 
equipment setup, technical support, and financial burdens. 
After analyzing the use of technology in music 
education, Silva [4] determined that this subject needs to 
incorporate an entire set of knowledge to achieve better 
musical practice, involving various applications for proper 
relevance to Musical Arts as an area of knowledge. 
Ali et al. [5] understand that the benefits of mobile 
devices include ease of access, storage of information, and 
mobility for academic and social media.

Franchi and Blanco [6] caution that some Brazilian state 
laws forbid the use of smartphones. The authors suggest, 
therefore, that teachers and schools must pay attention to the 
nearly unlimited possibilities for other uses of technology in 
musical learning processes. A large variety of technologies 
can be explored for increasing student skills in working with 
rhythm patterns, timbre, and other sound properties, since 
technologies are part of the lives of young people and of 
how they spend much of their time. 
Farley et al. [7] indicate that the use of Apps can provide 
support and increased knowledge to students both in and out 
of the classroom.  The Apps also allow the teachers access 
to some excellent complementary educational materials 
through mobile tools. 
Camacho [8] reiterates the importance of motivation as 
fundamental to the teaching and learning process, 
emphasizing that students need to develop a positive attitude 
towards the process. The use of technology in the classroom 
is essential for motivating development, and aids in student 
assimilation of musical skills. 
Wilmer, Sherman and Shein [9] call researchers’ 
attention to the need for studies that also address how the 
overuse of mobile devices can affect human behavior. 
Regarding the contemporaneity and importance of M-
learning within the field of Education, Ally and Prieto-
Blázquez [10] posit that this is probably the most important 
current area of educational research and Sung, Chang and 
Liu [11] argue that the increase of computing portability and 
the 
expanded 
use 
of 
mobile 
networks 
(wireless 
communication) have become powerful sources that merit 
application within traditional classrooms and beyond, 
particularly as tools of innovation in education. 
III. 
PROPOSAL 
The purpose of this work is to encourage the 
supplementing of Musical Arts disciplines in high schools, 
and 
technical 
schools 
with 
ICT 
and 
educational 
technologies. The intent is to provide students and teachers 
with technological tools in a way that makes those more 
attractive platforms to support learning and complementary 
research processes, and to motivate them in applying those 
support tools for the efficient and effective learning of the 
contents presented in the classroom. 
This proposal seeks a solution to the challenges of 
innovation and the incorporation of technology within 
music education. The specific areas of attention include: 
encompassed improvement in creative interaction between 
teacher and students; the awakening of students to a more 
effective participation in and out of class; the expansion of 
research in applying technology to the practice of Music; 
enhancement of the quality of contents given in the 
classroom; increased engagement of students in the teaching 
and learning process in Music, and corresponding 
improvement 
in 
interest 
and 
attitude; 
improved 
interdisciplinarity between Music and other areas of 
knowledge, starting with IT, providing the impetus for 
technical education for the productive sector of the local 
culture and beyond. 
This implies a paradigm shift that involves an open 
environment of collaborative education, since the teacher of 
the music disciplines will no longer restrict his or her 
approach to classroom teaching merely to traditional 
contents, such as paper and pen, magnetic board, computer 
to multimedia projector, group dynamics, classroom 
socialization and other teaching methodologies. While those 
approaches may still be relevant, the teacher and students 
will also use mobile devices and networks; favoring this 
kind of environment in the educative context, enables 
greater interactivity with students, which can motivate them 
to deepen their musical knowledge, through research, 
assimilation exercises and artistic creativity. This will help, 
since “in this fast-changing world, different stakeholders 
will have to work together to develop new educational 
models to cater for new generations of learners who will be 
using mobile technologies that do not exist as yet.” [10] 
(p.145). 
This paper results from the need to confront learning 
problems presented by the current generation of adolescents, 
herein referred to as the “youth generation”, who from the 
first decade of life have had contact with contemporary 
technologies and media, as well as the future generation, 
which is already considered the “virtual generation”. It is 
clear that educational institutions and professionals have the 
challenge of producing more collaborative content, as well 
as learning to apply it through virtual environments, which 
incorporate technology in the classroom and innovate in 
pedagogical practices. 
A. Materials 
This research was developed in the graduate course in 
Telematics. The research group work consisted of joint 
meetings at the computer science laboratory of the Federal 
Institute of Tocantins, alternating with virtual meetings each 
week. 
Since the course uses the Problem Based Learning 
(PBL) methodology, the first part of each meeting was 
dedicated to solving problems that were presented to the 
research group by a tutor. This involved rational 
deliberation, particularly focused on how the various 
portions of the project would be carried out.  The second 
part of the meetings was devoted to searching for solutions 
to proposed issues. Virtual meetings made use of cloud- 
available tools such as BigBlueButton [12], Youtube [13], 
WhatsApp [14], Gmail [15], Google Family - Classroom 
[16], Drive [17], Hangouts [18], Docs [19], Sheets [20], 
Slides [21], Forms [22] - and Overleaf [23]. 
In order to provide students and teachers with 
technological tools to support the teaching and learning 
process, much of the research was devoted to creating an 
App capable of applying content related to Musical Arts 
subjects in digital formats available in the cloud and 
accessible through mobile devices, such as smartphones,

tablets, computers (desktops and notebooks) and other kinds 
of media with an Internet browser. It was necessary to 
develop an application compatible with various smartphone 
platform 
operational 
systems, 
currently 
used 
for 
centralization of the content and ordering in a didactic form 
defined by the teacher of the discipline. 
A variety of functionalities were created in the 
application to enable its use in or out of the class [6], such 
as quiz resolution. The digital contents formed by texts, 
images and videos were presented by the teacher in the 
classroom and accompanied by students through their own 
smartphones. On occasion, when students did not have 
access to their smartphones in class, they were allowed to 
work with a partner (see Figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1.  Students working in pairs to appreciate musical examples. 
 
Quizzes, texts and complimentary videos were attached 
so that students could use them by themselves outside of 
class (see Figure 2). 
 
 
Figure 2.  Student using Ritornello App in Art/Music class. 
 
To develop the application, the following items were 
used: computers (Itautec desktop and Dell and Samsung 
notebooks) with Linux and Windows operating systems, 
with 
broadband 
Internet access, 
a 
Publisher type 
subscription of the AppSheet [24] tool to provide the 
system, Google Drive [17] for digital content storage (PDF, 
Images, etc.), YouTube [13] for video sharing, Google 
Sheets [20] to manipulate the content offered in the 
application, and the following smartphone devices for 
testing: Asus Zenfone 3, Iphone 5, Iphone 7 and Samsung 
Galaxy J5 Prime. 
To carry out the experiment in the classroom, a 
raspberry (a hardware computer of the size of a credit card) 
was available via the G-Redes Group; a Wi-Fi network 
board and a patch cord ("short" network cable) were used to 
provide Internet access broadband to students for their own 
devices to interact with the content applied by the teacher 
[6]. This router (see Figure 3), called “Tadeu”, had software 
that was appropriately constructed and integrated to its 
functioning by another research group linked to Federal 
Institute, called Network Applied Research Group (NARG). 
The software gains are: (1) Wi-Fi signal flashing, (2) 
optimized management of user connections, (3) continuity 
of roving user connections and (4) stability. 
The device and its operating program were created to 
promote better network signal capture and reception. It is a 
Wi-Fi router, equipment with two standard 802.11 Wi-Fi 
interfaces and a 100Mb Ethernet interface, with a system 
developed by the research group applied to computer 
networks on the Palmas Campus, which allows seamless 
and autonomous access to the Internet, using a wireless 
connection. 
 
 
Figure 3.  “Tadeu” – Wi-Fi router used in the experiment. 
 
This Wi-Fi mobility is the fundamental basis for 
everyone to have Internet access through their own device. 
During the experiment, Internet access was offered through 
the institute's own data network, as detailed in the previous 
paragraph; however, access through other means of 
communication such as LTE, 3G, 4G among others, were 
enabled. In the version of the application used in the 
experiment, the content that most required data bandwidth 
were the videos, which require, as specified by YouTube, a 
stable connection of at least 1 Mbps so the students could 
watch the contents without interruptions. 
The experiment was repeated 9 times with different 
classes (see Figure 4) of approximately 25 students. At the 
end of each class, the students were asked to submit an 
evaluation questionnaire with questions regarding the 
teaching tool and how well it met the students’ satisfaction 
for use with the new technology applications.

To achieve a satisfactory result, it was established that 
the reliability coefficient for the research would be at least

95%. To reach this level of reliability, it was necessary to 
define the minimum sample size. Considering that the size 
of the selected population (students of the Musical Arts 
discipline) was 160 persons, a total of 115 individuals were 
asked to answer the questions. The equation to arrive at this 
result is described in (1), which is called sample:

Where: 
a = sample 
 = standard deviation 
1, 96 = trust level 
= estimated error 
 
 
The collection of the research was done through a 
Google Forms electronic form at the end of each class 
through the application itself - Ritornello App - which was 
developed during the research. 
After data collection, the results were tabulated for each 
question, indicating the percentage marked for each 
alternative and the calculations of standard deviation and the 
sample error, reaching the variance as in (2): 
 
                                  
 
(2) 
 
Where: 
S² = variance 
Σ = sum 
Xi = value of element 
X = average of elements 
n = number of elements 
 
 
At the end, the standard deviation of each item was 
calculated to obtain the standard deviation as described in 
(3):

Where: 
S = standard deviation 
S² = variance 
 
With the tabulated results, a joint study was carried out 
for debugging the values and understanding the final result, 
which will be explained in more detail in the subsequent 
section. 
B. Methodology 
This research is action research “characterized as a type 
of research based on empirical research, designed and in 
close association with the resolution of a collective problem, 
in which researchers and participants are involved in a 
cooperative manner.” [25] (p. 163 - translated by the 
authors). 
IV. 
RESULTS 
In order to optimize Musical Arts learning through the 
efficient 
and 
effective 
use 
of 
information 
and 
communication resources, the conclusion is that it is 
essential for the education area to keep up with innovations 
in technology and communication in order to reach students 
in the contemporary world with its challenges and the new 
culture that presents itself. 
To do this, research is needed for the development and 
use of new technology applications and implementation of 
tools that accompany this process of contextualizing 
education to the new times. Expositive classes, magnetic 
frames with brushes and group dynamics, for example, can 
and should be used, but other resources need to be added to 
the educational dynamics, since educators working in 
elementary through high school education are dealing with a 
generation born within the digital age and exposed to it as 
early as the first decade of life. 
The results of this research were obtained through the 
interpretation 
of 
data 
collected 
by 
an 
evaluation 
questionnaire developed in Google Forms and applied at the 
end of each class, when all the students could answer 
through the App Ritornello itself, after the presentation of 
the contents scheduled for that class. A total of 115 
questionnaires were filled out, with 10 multiple choice 
questions in each questionnaire (see Table 1), each one with 
5 options, with the student selecting only one option for 
each question. 
The questions involved topics such as the coherence 
between the contents of the Ritornello platform and the 
teaching plan of the Music Arts discipline, their facilitative 
and complementary nature, the effectiveness of the 
evaluations of the contents given in class, through the 
quizzes in the App, frequency of the App use by the 
students outside of class and about the user experience, 
encouragement of academic motivation and degree of 
educator-student interaction, navigability and the influence 
of the App on student’s artistic creativity.

A. 
Data Analysis 
Question 1 (see Figure 5) dealt with the organization of 
contents on the App Ritornello platform, observing its 
coherence in relation to the teaching plan of the Music Arts 
subject. 
The results were that 43.5% (50 students) of respondents 
perceived great coherence between the contents and the 
platform, 31.3% (36 students) perceived enormous 
coherence and 25.2% (29 students) saw coherence between 
the two. The standard deviation of this question is 17.36%, 
with a sampling error of 3.17%. Thus, 100% of those who 
answered understand that there is a very positive 
relationship between the content taught in the course and the 
application 
platform, 
which 
certainly 
favored 
and 
strengthened the learning of the presented contents. 
 
 
Figure 5.  Question 1 results. 
Question 2 (see Figure 6) evaluated the effectiveness 
of Ritornello. For this item, 35.7% (41 students) of 
respondents answered that App Ritornello was a good help 
for learning the content better, 33% (38 students) answered 
that it helped a lot, 28.7% (33 students) answered that it 
helped. It was observed that 97.4% (112 students) of the 
responses were positive, pointing to the application as a tool 
that facilitates the educational process. Only 2.6% (3 
students) evaluated the contribution as being of "little help". 
The standard deviation of question 2 is 15.45%, with a 
sampling error of 2.82%. 
 
Figure 6.  Question 2 results. 
In Question 3, the purpose was to test the App's 
complementary character in relation to the course contents. 
More than half of the students, 57.4% (66 students), said 
that the App greatly complements the contents of the music 
subject (“a lot”), 21.7% (25 students) answered that the App 
complements extremely the music contents and 20% (23 
students) 
said 
that 
it 
complements 
moderately 
(“Reasonably”). In resume, 99.1% (114 students) believed 
that the App fulfills well the role of complementing the 
educational process in the classroom. Only 0.9% (1 student) 
considered the complementary character of the App invalid 
(“Nothing”) (see Figure 7). The standard deviation of this 
question is 20.82%, with a sampling error of 3.80%. 
 
Figure 7.  Question 3 results. 
Question 4 relates to the quizzes in the App and their 
effectiveness in evaluating contents. In the answers (see 
Figure 8), 39.1% (45 students) believe that the quizzes 
evaluated very well, 31.3% (36 students) said that they 
evaluated well and 25.2% (29 students) evaluated them as 
an excellent tool for evaluation. Thus, 95.6% (110 students) 
acknowledged that the quizzes fulfilled their role of 
efficiently evaluating the learning of contents per unit, 
favoring the pedagogical process. In this question, only 
4.3% (5 students) concluded that this evaluation was fair. 
No one considered the quizzes to be inadequate. The 
standard deviation of this question is 15.27%, with a 
sampling error of 2.79%.

Figure 8.  Question 4 results. 
In Question 5, the focus was on how often the students 
would use the App outside the classroom. The answers (see 
Figure 9) showed that 48.7% (56 students) reported that 
they were able to use the App only once a week, 23.5% (27 
students) were able to use it twice a week, 13% (15 
students) once a day, 9.6% (11 students) never used the App 
outside of the classroom and 5.2% (6 students) were able to 
use it 2 or more times a day. With this, 72.2% (83 students) 
agree that Ritornello is a complementary technology tool to 
be used in or out of class to deepen the contents of the 
discipline. Despite this, 27.8% (32 students) of those who 
answered the questionnaire evidenced using the App at 
other times and places, which may greatly extend the 
application function in the future. The standard deviation of 
Question 5 is 15.56%, with a sampling error of 2.84%. 
 
Figure 9.  Question 5 results. 
Question 6 evaluated the degree of acceptability of users 
with the use of the App in relation to traditional classes (see 
Figure 10), 49.6% (57 students) of the evaluators stated that 
they are pleased with the App, 35.7% (41 students) said they 
were greatly pleased, 12.2% (14 students) felt that their use 
was indifferent in relation to traditional classes, 7% (2 
students) reported being slightly pleased and 0.9% (1 
student) expressed displeased. In total, 85.3% (98 students) 
of the students showed acceptance of the use of the App in 
its relation with traditional classes, evidencing that it 
presents a positive differential, and is able to potentialize the 
educational process. The standard deviation of this question 
is 19.39%, with a sampling error of 3.54%. 
 
Figure 10.  Question 6 results. 
Question 7 inquired whether the use of the Ritornello 
App increased the student's interest in the Music Arts 
discipline (see Figure 11). 46.1% (53 students) of the 
respondents said yes, they were a little more interested, 
32.2% (37 students) answered yes, they were much more 
interest, 13% (15 students) said that it was indifferent, 7.8% 
(9 students) pointed that they continued having the same 
interest and 0.9% (1 student) that their interest has 
decreased. Only 0.9% (1 student) affirmed that interest in 
the subject decreased due to its use and 20.8% (24 students) 
evidenced that they were not affected by the interest in the 
discipline by using the App. The standard deviation of 
Question 7 is 16.68%, with a sampling error of 3.04%. 
 
Figure 11.  Question 7 results. 
Question 8 measured the student-educator interaction. 
More than half of the respondents, 51.3% (59 students), said 
that the interaction improved, 34.8% (40 students) that the 
interaction improved a lot, 13.9% (16 students) answered it 
was indifferent and 86.1% (99 students) believed that there 
was an increase of interaction between teacher and students 
through the use of Ritornello. No one said that using the 
App made it difficult to interact or said that its use 
eliminated the interaction. The standard deviation for 
question 8 is 20.18%, with a sampling error of 3.68%. 
Contrary to what might be commonly thought, the research 
results point to a positive relationship between actors in the 
educational process by the use of new technologies in the 
classroom (see Figure 12).

Figure 12.  Question 8 results. 
Question 9 evaluated the degree of usability of the App. 
34.8% (40 students) of respondents said that the use is very 
easy, 30.4% (36 students) said that is relatively easy and 
31.3% (35 students) found it easy. From the respondents 
96.5% (111 students) believe that Ritornello App is user-
friendly. Only 3.5% (4 students) stated that it was difficult 
to use the application. The standard deviation of this 
question is 15.02%, with a sampling error of 2.74%. With 
this response, it is possible to say that Ritornello can be 
widely used in high school and even adapted for use in 
lower education, to younger people and people who are not 
accustomed to the use of technologies (see Figure 13). 
 
Figure 13.  Question 9 results. 
Question 10 evaluated the relation between the use of 
Ritornello and the increase of students’ creativity ability and 
its application in students’ artistic expression.  More than 
half, 57.4% (66 students), said that the App helped a lot in 
such development and 20% (23 students) answered that it 
helped very much, making a total of 77.4% (89 students) 
holding a positive opinion. Additionally, 18.3% (21 
students) were indifferent, 2.6% (3 students) believed that 
the App did not help with creative subjects and 1.7% (2 
students) said that it was of little help in such development. 
The standard deviation of question 10 is 20.18%, with a 
sampling error of 3.68% (see Figure 14).

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
 Technology has much to contribute to education, as has 
been demonstrated by the use of television, multimedia 
devices and computers for some decades in the classroom. 
However, 
the 
most 
recent 
technologies, 
such 
as 
smartphones, 
also 
merit 
application 
to 
education, 
particularly in the context of a hyper-modern world where a 
large proportion of the population already has access to a 
portable high-tech device. 
Music education, as with other areas of knowledge, needs 
incentives and adjustments, with properly trained teachers, 
appropriate methodologies and didactic materials, and 
updated pedagogical tools that stimulate learning at all levels 
of the educational system. 
The Ritornello App was able to supply some of these 
needs through increased student engagement, which resulted 
in higher interest in Musical Arts studies, as well as an 
enhanced teaching and learning process that provided 
greater satisfaction to the actors involved in it. 
Nevertheless, some challenges persist: the lack of broad 
or consistent access to technology in Brazilian schools; the 
need for better continuing education training for teachers in 
the use of technologies; more complete and adequate access 
to personal computers by students; and of course, the 
development of more technological educational tools. 
Further research will be needed concerning the 
implementation and monitoring of these tools in the 
classroom so that they can provide the results appropriate to 
the environment for which they were created. 
Beyond that, it is possible to research how Ritornello 
could be applied with a broader spectrum of subject and 
content areas. Based upon the data collection performed in 
the user experience (UX), the application can undergo 
further adaptations and improvements. Its relevance could 
be expanded to various disciplines and contexts of 
education, capitalizing on its powerful pedagogical potential 
for dramatic expansion of formal education. 
Additional tools could be developed to provide the 
teacher with further classroom App support; for example, it 
would be useful to develop a tool which might provide the 
teacher with graphs to accompany each student’s access 
number, indicating their progress toward learning goals, 
completion of exercises, and levels of achievement. 
As for the development of tools to aid in teaching (M-
Learning), it is possible to conclude that the mobility factor 
should be considered as a premise, given the need to meet 
the requirements of availability in multiple platforms and 
the great diversity of devices and means of communications 
existing at present. The use of specific features of mobile 
devices such as smartphones and tablets, with devices such 
as: Camera, Microphone, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, 
Magnetometer, GPS and others, can be explored in future 
work to obtain new user experiences. 
Another aspect that merits further study is the impact 
that acute and extensive use of technology may have on 
student cognition and behavior, especially regarding effects

on relationships, social interactions, and long-term physical 
and mental health care and relational aspects, since there is a 
dynamic correlation between Education, Technology and 
Communication. Given the virtually unlimited potential of 
these tools, innovative investment and expansion is highly 
promising, but should be carried out with due caution and 
appropriate diligence.
