Abstract—In recent years, learning analytics has been attracting
attention. Learning analytics is the measurement, collection,
analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts
for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the
environments. Generally, its information are stored in Learning
Management System (LMS) and Course Management System
(CMS). However, LMS and CMS did not have the method to
measure the achievement of learning using lecture contents. This
paper proposes the methods to measure the achievement of
learning using lecture contents.
Keywords–Lecture Contents; Learning Analytics; Measurement
of Learning Achievement.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, many educational institutions offer various mech-
anism for the educational advance using information com-
munication technology (ICT). A massive open online course
(MOOC) [1][2][3] is a model for delivering learning content
online to any person who wants to take a course, without any
limitation on attendance. MOOC delivers not only text media
(syllabus, handout, etc.), but also sound contents and movie
contents. Coursera [4] is also the service provider to deliver
a lecture of a university as MOOC. Coursera is delivering
courses of more than 1000 by 120 universities and has more
than 13,000,000 participants. It’s learned using lecture contents
by open online course. Hori [5] shows the user is viewing
only one or two lecture contents by open online course. Hori
also shows 80 percent of user view and stopped half of
lecture contents and the average viewing hour is 30 minutes.
Generally, lecture contents is 90 minutes in Japan. Because
lecture contents are generated by recording real lecture. This
result shows it is difﬁcult to secure time to view all of lecture
contents.
We developed the lecture contents viewing system us-
ing lecture contents metadata [6][7]. The system which we
developed has three functions, index function, unit/content
viewing function and playlist function. The index function can
view lecture contents from utterance time of indexing term
by using index metadata. The unit/content viewing function
can be played back selected unit and learning content of
lecture content by using syllabus metadata generated from
the syllabus. The playlist function can view plural units and
learning contents continuously. This system provides various
mechanism of viewing lecture contents on learning. This
system provides the mechanism which the learner views the
lecture contents little by little and complete viewing with
several days. In recent years, learning analytics [8] has been
attracting attention. Learning analytics is the measurement,
collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and
their contexts for purposes of understanding and optimizing
learning and the environments. Its information stored Learning
Management System (LMS) [9] and Course Management
System (CMS) [10]. However, LMS and CMS did not have
the method to measure the achievement of learning using
lecture contents. And the system which we developed has
the mechanism to acquire viewing history of learners [11].
However, this system can not measure the achievement of
learning using lecture contents. This research proposes the
methods to measure the achievement of learning using lecture
contents.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes lec-
ture contents viewing system using lecture contents metadata.
Section III describes method to measure the achievement of
learning using lecture contents. Section IV describes conclu-
sion.

LECTURE CONTENTS VIEWING SYSTEM USING
LECTURE CONTENTS METADATA
This section describes lecture contents metadata and lecture
contents viewing system using lecture contents metadata.
A. Lecture Contents Metadata
The lecture contents and lecture contents metadata are
stored in the database. Its database is called lecture con-
tents archives.
Lecture contents metadata consist of general
information, index metadata and syllabus metadata. General
information are name of lecture contents, creation date of
lecture contents, etc. The index metadata is generated from
text data which is converted by teacher’s utterance in lecture

contents using a voice recognition technology. Figure. 1 shows
index metadata. In index metadata, the information of lecture
contents describes contents tags, indexing term describes term
tags and utterance time of indexing term describes time
tags. According to Figure. 1, indexing term “Codeword” is
uttered 00:08:03, 00:12:11 and 00:46:08 in the lecture content
(JAD02).Using index metadata, the contents created by this
system don’t need the play back from the beginning but from
the midstream.The syllabus metadata is generated from the
syllabus. Figure. 2 shows the syllabus metadata. Figure. 2
shows the lecture contents (JAD02) consists of various units
and learning contents. This unit consists of “ Encoding of
Information ” and “ Information Content ”. This learning
content (Encoding of Information) consists of “ Information
Transmission”and“Symbol and Code”. The lecture contents

B. Lecture Contents Viewing System Using Lecture Contents
Metadata
The lecture contents viewing system has three functions,
indexing function, unit/content viewing function and playlist
function.
1) Indexing Function: The indexing function has three
retrieval methods, (a) Input indexing term to input form,
(b) Select indexing term from initial letter of indexing term,
(c) Select indexing term from indexing list for each lecture.
Figure. 3 shows the result window. In indexing function, the
lecture contents can be played back the midstream uttered
indexing term. This function uses Synchronized Multimedia
Integration Language (SMIL) [12]. Using SMIL, the lecture
contents created by this system can play back from the
scene of indexing term. Figure. 4 shows SMIL ﬁle generated
by indexing function. The lecture contents (JAD01) uttered
indexing term“ Entropy ”is played back from 3008 seconds.

information content from 1905 seconds to 3008 seconds.
These information are based on syllabus metadata, which
the authors deﬁned in this research. Figure. 6 shows lecture
content using SMIL ﬁle.
3) Playlist Function: The playlist function can view plural
units and learning contents continuously. Using SMIL, the

7, the lecture contents (JAD02) is played back from 3008
seconds (00:50:08) to 4267 seconds (01:11:07) and from 401
seconds (00:06:41) to 597 seconds (00:09:57) continuously.
The playlist function can play not only the same lecture
contents but also different lecture contents continuously.

THE METHODS TO MEASURE THE ACHIEVEMENT OF
LEARNING USING LECTURE CONTENTS
We developed the function to acquire viewing history of
learners [11]. This sectoin proposes the two kinds of method to
measure the achievement of learning using lecture contents. It’s
the method to measure the achievement of each student and the

method to measure the achievement of all students. These are
measured based on data which the function to acquire viewing
history of learners creates.
A. The Method to Measure the Achievement of each Student
A function which acquires viewing history consists of
indexing history acquisition function and viewing time ac-
quisition function. The indexing history acquisition function
acquires a total number of views using indexing function.
TABLE.I shows viewing history obtained by the viewing
time acquisition function. This is a viewing history of lecture
content (JAD02) by a certain learner. No.1 of Table.1 means
that the learner views lecture content (JAD02) from January 16,
2015 10:28:00 to January 16, 2015 10:31:16. Also, it means
that lecture content (JAD02) is playback from 00:06:41 to
00:09:57. Therefore, the learner views lecture content (JAD02)
for 196 minutes from 00:06:41 to 00:09:57. As shown in
the syllabus metadata of Figure. 2, lecture content (JAD02)
is played back about “ Symbol and Code ” from 00:06:41
to 00:09:57. Therefore, it means the learner views “ Symbol
and Code ” of lecture content (JAD02). Figure. 8 presents
the measurement obtained by this method. This is measured
based on data which the function to acquire viewing history of
learners creates. Figure. 8 shows that Student X is viewing all
contents of No.1, 80% of contents of No.2. However, student
X is viewing only 30% of contents of No.5.
B. The Method to Measure the Achievement of all Students
Section III.A describes the method to measure the achieve-
ment of each student. It is important that a teacher sees the
measurement on each all students, and a teacher correspond
appropriately to it. And it is also important to grasp the

data which the function to acquire viewing history of learners
creates. Figure. 9 is indicated the measurement obtained by
this method. Figure. 9 shows student A is viewing 75% of
contents of No1, student B is viewing all contents of No.1. And
student C is viewing only 15% of contents of No.1. Figure. 10
shows proportion of each viewing rating. Figure. 10 shows the
students who view 100% of contents of No.1 are 45 students,
the students who view more than 60% of contents are 112
students.
IV.
CONCLUSION
This paper proposed the two kinds of method to measure
the achievement of learning using lecture contents, The method
to measure the achievement of each student and the method
to measure the achievement of all students. We are conducting
an experiment to conﬁrm the effectiveness of this method in
Kagawa university.
