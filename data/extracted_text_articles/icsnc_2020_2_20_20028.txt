Abstract—
This
paper
presents
a
miniaturized
Radio-
Frequency (RF) and microwave energy harvesting system
adapted to GSM-900 Network (Global System for Mobile
Communication).
Most
researchers
have worked in this
domain by trying to harvest an enough DC output voltage to
feed
different
electronic
devices
to
ensure
their
energy
autonomy. The matter with these systems lies in the antenna
size. The proposed system is realized on Teflon hybrid
technology. The size of the proposed multiband antenna is of
20x30x0.67 mm3, and that of the rectifier matched to the
antenna is of 10x15x0.67 mm3. The measurement shows that
the antenna is able to cover GSM900 (935 – 960) MHz, (1470 –
1550) MHz, GSM1900 (1935 – 1989) MHz and (3 – 3.2) GHz,
bands. The output Direct Current (DC) harvested voltage
measured is of 0.3 V for 2 kΩ resistance load. This result is 
sufficient for feeding low power consumption Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs). In this paper, the selected temperature
sensor operates for 0.2 V and 23 nW power supply. The
equivalent resistor of this sensor is 2 kΩ. The DC output 
voltage can reach 0.8 V for open load.

INTRODUCTION
The RF and micro-wave energy harvesting devices
consist of 3 primary blocks, antenna, impedance matching
and rectifier (see Figure 1). The antenna is a primordial
device on these systems, which is a responsible of all
electromagnetic waves catching from the environment with
adapting frequencies and power levels. Antennas which
allow to capture many waves at many frequency bandwidths
improve widely the RF and microwave energy harvesting
system performances. The proposed antenna is smallest
(20x30x0.67 mm3) compared to the GSM antennas (GSM-
900, GSM-1800/1900) commonly used with keeping a high
efficiency
levels
[7].
This
answers
to
recommended
miniaturization required for the harvesting systems [4][5].
The rectifier is matched to the antenna by using an
impedance matching network, which is realized
with
Surface
Mounted
Devices
(SMD)
electronic
elements
(inductors and
capacitors). The rectifier
is based
on
Schottky diode (MBRS360T3G) and capacitor voltage
doubler [5][8]. The dimension of the proposed RF and
microwave energy harvesting circuit is of 10x15x0.67 mm3.
This miniaturized system could be used to power many
applications (sensors, smart watches, etc.).

The reported antenna in [10] is modified to cover
multiband frequency by adding many meanders, which mean
many bands. Each meander can be modeled electrically by
inductors [3]. Table I presents the antenna dimensions in
mm.

B. Antenna Response And Radiation Diagram
Figures 3 and 4 present respectively the return loss of
this antenna and the radiation diagram getting by exploring
the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) software.
Figure 3. Simulated S11 antenna response.
we clearly see that this antenna is operational within the
frequency bandwidths, (945 – 960) MHz with S11≤ -25
dB, (1780 – 1850) MHz with S11≤ -30dB, (1930 –
1980) MHz with S11≤ -25dB, (2450 – 2500) MHz with
S11≤ -25dB and (2610 – 2680) MHz with S11≤ -20dB,
Figure 4. Radiation diagram at 948 MHz, 1.8 GHz, 1.96 GHz.
the radiation diagram of this antenna is omnidirectional, that
is
flawlessly
tailored
to
the
mobile
communication
GSM900, GSM1800 and GSM1900 (PCS network), the
gain is around 1.43dB, 1.38 in linear scale.
C. Antenna Stability
The stability of this antenna is handled very cautiously by
adjusting with precision its dimensions [9]-[11]. Figure 5
shows the smith-chart, in which the stability of this antenna
appears when the graph stays inside the principal smith
chart circle, as we can see, this antenna is within the
stability restriction, because the S11 curve contacts the unit
circle but it doesn’t exceed it, in invers case we talk about
the antenna instability. This analysis is imperative for such
an antenna. Otherwise, the measured response might be
definitely different from the simulations. The performance
could then decrease drastically.

D. Cosimulation Results
By using Advanced Design Systems (ADS) software (see
Figure 6), the co-simulation response is depicted in the
Figure 7.
Figure 6. presented antenna model on ADS.
Figure 7. Proposed antenna co-simulation response.
In Figure 7, it is clear that the co-simulation response is
in
good
agreement
with
that
of
the
electromagnetic
simulation obtained using CST software (see Figure 3).
E. Antenna Electrical Equivalent Circuit
As we noted in Section II-A, this antenna is formed
from many LC resonators, theoretically [3], the meandered
antennas
models
can
be
translated
electrically
to
a
superposition of many LC resonators as presented in the
Figure 8. These resonator successions allow to have a multi-
bands
antenna,
in
level
of
sum
resonators.
The
electromagnetic coupling phenomena are possible, due to
the same resonance frequency of sum resonators.
Figure 8. Equivalent electrical element.
We simulate the response of this antenna equivalent
circuit on ADS. The proposed model is depicted in Figure 9,
and its response in Figure 10.

We can clearly see in Figure 10, the electrical equivalent
circuit response is too adapted to the simulation and co-
simulation one, such as, for GSM900 band (950-960) MHz
the S11 ≤ -15 dB, GSM1900 (PSC) the S11 ≤ -15 dB,
UMTS2100 S11≤-15 dB, Wi-Fi 2.45 GHz S11≤-20 dB,
LTE 2.6 GHz S11≤-15 dB.

REALIZED ANTENNA AND MEASUREMENT
A. Realized Antenna Model
The proposed antenna structure represented in Figure 11,
is printed on Teflon substrate (ϵr=2.1) with a dimension of 
20 x 30 x 0.67
.
Figure 11. Realized antenna model.
B. Measured Response
Figure 12 shows the S11 parameter measured on vector
network analyzer.
Figure 12. Measured antenna response.
In Figure 12, we see that this antenna is perfectly matched
to GSM-900 and GSM-1900 bands. At the frequency 948
MHz the S11 is less than -20 dB and equal to -19 dB for 1.96
GHz frequency, there are two other resonance frequencies,
at 1.5 GHz and 3 GHz with an S11 less than -18 dB.
IV.
RECTIFIER AND IMPEDANCE MATCHING CIRCUITS
C. Proposed Rectifier
The rectification circuit has the function of transforming
an alternating signal into another continuous. The proposed
circuit
is
designed
based
on
Schottky
diodes
(MBRS360T3G), and two capacitors connected in parallel
which allows to double the output DC voltage. Figure 13
shows the proposed rectification circuit.
Figure 13. The proposed rectifier.
An impedance matching circuit is required to match this
circuit to the antenna. The first step is to calculate the
equivalent impedance of the rectifier, by using ADS software
and streaming Smith chart. Figure 14 depicts the value of
this impedance. At this level, we know both impedance va-

lues, 50 Ohm for the antenna and 5+j5 Ohm for the rectifier.
Now, we can design the impedance matching circuit between
both sides (antenna and rectifier).
D. Proposed Impedance Matching
Figure 15 shows the proposed model designed on ADS
software.
Figure 15. Proposed impedance matching circuit.
For adapting this circuit to GSM-900, we use Smith chart
on ADS software, which is presented in Figure 16.
Figure 16. Impedance matching circuit S11.
We can clearly see that the proposed circuit is too
adapted to GSM-900 at 945 MHz, the value of each elements
is tuned by ADS, we can also calculate them by using the
resonance formula.
E. Simulated Output DC Voltage
Figure 17 presents simulated output voltage for -40 dBm
input power.
Figure 17. DC output voltage for -40 dBm input power
From this result, the harvested DC voltage is 0.8 V,
simulated on ADS without termination load. This system is
designed to feed low power consumption Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs). The temperature sensor of [2] is
operational for 0.2V and its equivalent resistance is 2 kΩ. 
Figures 18 and 19 show the proposed system with sensor
load termination and its simulated DC output voltage,
respectively.

The output DC voltage is 0.3V, which is enough for feeding
the selected temperature sensor of [2].

circuit (impedance matching + rectifier circuits).

matching + Rectifier circuits).
B. S11 circuit Measurement
Figure 21 depicts the measured return loss.
Figure 21. RF energy harvesting circuit return loss measurement.
As shown in Figure 21, the return loss is centered at 958
MHz, therefore, this circuit is adapted to GSM-900 downlink
band.
C. Measured DC output voltage
Figure 22 shows the realized system (Antenna + RF
energy circuit).
Figure 22. Realized proposed system.
The DC output voltage measurement has been achieved
by using a Multimeter and an Oscilloscope. Figures 23 and
24 show the obtained results.

500 mV per Division.
We can see that the measured output DC voltage is too
near from that of the simulation one with 0.8 V, which

confirms that the simulation and measurement are in good
agreement. This proposed system can perfectly feed the low
power
consumption
temperature
sensor
in
[2],
which
requires 0.2 V for working.
VI.
CONCLUSION
In this work, we proved that is possible to feed low power
consumption electronic devices (sensors, Radio-cognitive
devices, smart watches, etc.) using RF and microwave
energy
harvesting
systems,
by
exploring
all
mobile
communication and wireless networks. A circuit adapted to
GSM 900 network is proposed for feeding a low power
consumption temperature sensor reported in [2], and by
exploring more mobile communication networks more we
increase the DC output voltage. The realized antenna and
RF and microwave energy harvesting circuit (impedance
matching + rectifier) are miniature with a dimension of
20x30x0.67 mm3 and 10x15x0.67 mm3, respectively. The
harvested DC voltage from GSM-900 is 0.8 V for open load
termination and 0.3 V for 2 kΩ resistance load, which is the 
sensor equivalent resistance.
