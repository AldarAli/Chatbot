Abstract— This paper contributes to modeling links and route 
stabilities in three diverse wireless routing protocols. For this 
purpose, we select three extensively utilized proactive 
protocols; Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV), 
Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and Fish-eye State 
Routing (FSR). We also enhance the performance of these 
protocols by modifying default parameters. Optimization of 
these routing protocols are done via performance metrics, i.e., 
average Throughput, End to End Delay (E2ED) and 
Normalized Routing Load (NRL) achieved by them. Default 
routing protocols DSDV, OLSR and FSR are compared and 
evaluated with modified versions named as M-DSDV, M-
OLSR and M-FSR using Network Simulator (NS2). Numerical 
Computations for Route Stabilities of these routing protocols 
through a mathematical modeled equation is determined and 
compared with simulation results. Moreover, all-inclusive 
evaluation and scrutiny of these proactive routing protocols 
are done under the MAC layer standards 802.11 DCF and 
802.11e EDCF. In this way both Network and MAC layer 
exploration has been done under the performance metrics 
which gives overall performance and tradeoff with respect to 
full utilization of the available resources of Ad-hoc network 
high scalability scenario. Routing latency effects with respect 
to route stabilities and MAC layer standards 802.11 and 
802.11e are compared and scrutinized with the tradeoff 
observed in throughput and in overhead (NRL) generated.

 INTRODUCTION  
IEEE standard 802.11, at present, is a significant and 
trendy access methodology used in wireless communication. 
It enables speedy and straightforward design of network 
communication as a de facto MAC standard for LANs, 
WANs in Small Office Home Office (SOHO) or open-places 
and to the highest degree facilitated wireless access to the 
internet. Growing esteem of 802.11 standard, numerous 
services also improved and requirement for Quality of 
Service (QoS) become obvious. Hence, therapy to QoS 
setback in 802.11, enhanced version, i.e., 802.11e was 
anticipated [1]. IEEE standard 802.11e, i.e., EDCF 
(Enhanced Distributed Channel Function) defines numerous 
QOS parameters to IEEE standard 802.11 Distributed 
Coordination Function (DCF).  
 
Conferring to 802.11 DCF, every station with a fresh data 
packet equipped to access transmission observers channel 
activity while waiting for an unused period comparable to a 
Distributed Inter- Frame Space (DIFS) is sensed and at that 
point the station transmits. Else, when channel is intuited 
busy, station initializes its back off timer and delays the 
transmission access for arbitrarily chosen back off interval so 
to lessen aggregate of collisions.

The

standard 
announces 
service 
differentiation compared to the DCF standard 802.11 DCF 
by launching four access categories or classes (ACs) for data 
priorities [2,3]. Presuming QoS Stations (QSTAs) work 
under saturated or congested traffic, i.e., each QSTA has a 
data unit called as MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) to 
correspond later while closing all succeeded transmissions 
[4]. Standard 802.11e methodology is formulated on four 
Access Categories (ACs); 1. Voice, 2. Video, 3. Best Effort, 
4. Background. 
 
Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
contains brief description of proactive protocols in ad-hoc 
networks. Related work and shortcomings from previous 
work can be found in Section III. Section IV determines the 
route scalabilities with the proposed mathematical equation. 
Simulation result analysis has been done in Section V and 
finally conclusion with some insight of future work is 
discussed in Section VI.

PROACTIVE PROTOCOLS IN AD-HOC NETWORK 
DSDV [5], FSR [6] and OLSR [9] which are 
proactive in nature are table driven protocols. They update 
their routing table periodically without demand, so issue of 
extra band width utilization occurs. Several methods are 
designed to compensate this problem. In the Low Scalability 
region, all three protocols perform well, but when we take a 
look at Medium Scalability region OLSR has better 
performance. This makes this standard efficient by checking 
the medium state more rapidly than 802.11. In this way, 
time consumed for accessing the medium is decreased and 
more enhanced Throughput is achieved in shorter time than

that in 802.11 DCF. The enhanced version 802.11e EDCF 
provides small Contention Window (CW) size which helps 
to access the medium more immediately than in 802.11e 
EDCF. 
 
A. Proactive Protocols in Brief 
 
The three extensively utilized protocols in Ad-hoc 
Networks that we considered Destination Sequenced 
Distance Vector (DSDV) [5], Fish-eye State Routing (FSR) 
[6], [7] and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) [8], [9], 
are proactive in nature. Altogether, these three proactive 
protocols practice hop-by-hop routing scheme designed for 
packet forwarding. In DSDV, packets are disseminated and 
then path is calculated by Distributed Bellman Ford (DBF) 
algorithm. In FSR, DBF algorithm is utilized for path 
calculation. The nodes keep up a table carrying link state 
information constructed on fresh statistics acknowledged via 
adjacent nodes. In addition, nodes occasionally interchange 
it with confined neighbors. Path calculation mechanism in 
OLSR is carried out through Dijikstra’s algorithm [9]. 
Proactive routing protocols in brief with their features are 
given below in Table I.

MODELING ROUTE STABILITIES 
Modeling Route Stabilities of these three proactive routing 
protocols are determined depending upon their broadcast 
time interval Tbi. Numerical computation is carried out for 
each proactive routing protocols. Route stabilities are 
determined using the following equation (1). Suppose, we 
have two nodes na and nb. Node na transmits a packet at 
time tj which is received by nb at time tk. Link stability at 
node nb, for link l, at time tk, for a particular broadcast 
interval TBi with respect to certain routing protocol 
parameters,            
      can be defined as follows:  
           
                      
   
                     
The above equation is accompanied by the 
following constraints: 
(i) 
∀ k > 0 
(ii) 
     ≠ 0 
(iii) 
0 <     < 1 (Ideal Situation) 
(iv) 
           
         , where     is a 
threshold value defined through specific 
parameter which varies from protocol to 
protocol.  
A. DSDV Route Stabilities 
In case of Trigger Updates between active links, 
   
     varies according to state of the link. When link 
breaks, trigger messages are sent by the respective node by 
increasing NRL.

SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS 
 
Figure 2. Throughput 802.11 DCF 
In high scalabilities, (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) MPR 
techniques achieve more optimization and efficiency, 
therefore both OLSR and M-OLSR overall produce high 
throughput among selected proactive protocols. After 
modification in all of three chosen protocols, OLSR 
produces the highest throughput both in DCF and EDCF. It 
is because of the frequent updating of routing messages that 
results in stabilized MPRs. DSDV achieves the second 
highest average throughput in DCF and EDCF as compared 
to the rest of two selected routing protocols. The reason for 
high efficiency of DSDV is due to incremental updates 
which are generated in case of any change in links of active 
routes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
But in high scalabilities it fails to converge because 
the exchange of routing messages through flooding cause 
more overhead, and in high densities the rate of change is 
increased, thus causes more drop rates. On the other hand, 
OLSR’s throughput is more in high scalabilities of 80 
nodes, 90 nodes and 100 nodes because MPRs provide more 
optimizations in high densities.  
 
However, FSR use only periodic updates for link 
status monitoring and route updating. It is more suitable for 
hundreds and thousands of nodes, because fish-eye scopes 
with graded frequency mechanisms are best suited in very 
high densities. Frequent routing updating in FSR by 
reducing inner-scope and outer-scope intervals augments 
more throughputs in FSR-M as compared to FSR, but FSR-
M fails to converge in EDCF comparative to that of FSR. 
Whereas, increasing the interval of triggered update 
generation in DSDV-M increase throughput in EDCF while 
inDCF.

Figure 4. End2End Delay 802.11 DCF 
In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, E2ED of selected routing 
protocols is less in EDCF as compared to DCF due to 
efficient stability checking of link in EDCF comparative to 
DCF. FSR attains the lowest routing latency in DCF as 
compared to DSDV and OLSR. Pure proactive approach 
route updating keeps overall routing latency low in FSR. 
Although in DSDV data remains for the time required for 
route settling to maintain correct information of routes 
before sending it to the destination, but this route settling 
time augments the delay. Whereas, DSDV produces the 
highest delay, moreover, it does not optimize network wise 
broadcasting (in DSDV exchange of routing messages is 
only performed through flooding, as compared to MPRs of 
OLSR which reduce number of retransmissions and scope 
updates of FSR by using graded frequency mechanism).  
 
DSDV-M has less routing latency as compared to 
DSDV in case of DCF. While DSDV-M and DSDV possess 
equal routing delay in EDCF, because efficient mechanism 
of 802.11e EDCF helps to reduce E2ED. Same is the case of 
OLSR, where OLSR-M achieves lowest delay as compared 
to OLSR in EDCF, while this delay is more in EDCF. As 
FSR-M’s periodic intervals for scope routing are reduced, 
therefore it attains low E2ED in both DCF and EDCF. 
Moreover it does not update routing information instantly 
after detection of any change in the network unlike DSDV 
and OLSR; therefore, EDCF mechanism does not effect too 
much to improve its performance. 
 
Figure 5. End2End Delay 802.11 EDCF 
All selected routing protocols have attained high 
NRL referring to Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 after modifications. The 
rate for successive routing messages exchange is highest in 
OLSR as compared to the rest of the protocols (clearly 
mentioned in the table), therefore it generates high routing 
load. As FSR does not trigger any routing messages in case 
of link breakage and relies only on periodic updating, thus it 
produces lowest NRL in DCF. Furthermore, DSDV 
produces lowest routing messages in case of EDCF as 
compared to OLSR and FSR as shown in Fig. 6, because the 
efficient 
information 
of 
link 
connectivity 
reduces 
incremental updates. TTL value in ring search algorithm 
increases while increase in network density is observed, this 
leads to increase in broadcast routing packets during route 
discovery as increasing NRL behavior in FSR.

Performance Trade-offs of three proactive routing 
protocols; DSDV, OLSR and FSR as shown in Fig. 7 
according to three performance metrics carried out on the 
basis of simulation results analysis. DSDV achieves 
enhanced and high throughput with trade-off between E2ED 
but reduction in routing overhead is observed using 
incrementals. OLSR outperforms as concerned to its lowest 
E2ED observed with the increase in throughput and 
normalized routing load. FSR produces more normalized 
routing load with a minimum trade-off between other two 
performance metrics, i.e., throughput and E2ED.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have estimated and matched the 
performance of three extensively utilized proactive 
protocols; DSDV, OLSR and FSR. Total normalized routing 
load achieved by a protocol which is centered upon two 
changing aspects; control traffic produced by control 
packets and data traffic accelerated over and done with 
routes of non-optimal path lengths. Consequently, for 
evaluating the route stabilities of these protocols in dense 
networks and with different broadcast intervals of each 
routing protocol; we have varied different scalability 
scenarios. In lieu of analysis, three performance parameters; 
E2ED, NRL and throughput are worked out by using NS-2. 
In conclusion, we perceived that OLSR is additionally 
scalable for the reason of bargain in routing overhead due to 
MPRs and lowest E2ED, as OLSR permits retransmission 
via MPRs. On the other influence, FSR is supplementary 
appropriate for extraordinary network loads owed to scope 
routing over GF (no flooding), that decreases broadcasting 
storm, as a result it saves additional bandwidth and 
accomplishes high throughput when data traffic upturns in 
high scalabilities. 
In the future, we are concerned to evaluate reactive 
routing protocols under same scalability scenarios, but with 
varying mobilities and under route stabilities computed 
using the equation proposed in (1).
