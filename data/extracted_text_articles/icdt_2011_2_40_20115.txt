Abstract—This paper presents an evaluation of different types 
and families of multiwavelets in stereo correspondence 
matching.  Different multiwavelet families with different filter 
types such as balanced versus unbalanced, symmetric-
symmetric 
versus 
symmetric-antisymmetric 
are 
used. 
Normalized cross correlation is employed to find the best 
correspondence points and generate  a disparity map. In the 
case of balanced multiwavelets, due to similar spectral content 
of the four generated low frequency subbands, they are 
shuffled to form a single baseband and then this baseband is 
used to generate a disparity map. However, in the case of 
unbalanced multiwavelets, the resulting basebands are used to 
form four disparity maps and then these maps are combined 
using a Fuzzy algorithm to generate a single disparity map. 
Middlebury stereo test images are used to generate 
experimental results. Results show that the unbalanced 
multiwavelets  produce a smoother disparity map with less 
mismatch errors compared to balanced multiwavelets.

 INTRODUCTION 
Stereo correspondence is an issue of great importance in 
the field of computer vision and 3D reconstruction. It 
concerns the matching of points between a pair of stereo 
images of the same scene. The disparity is calculated as the 
distance of the correspondence points when one of the two 
stereo image pairs is projected onto the other. The disparity 
map along with the stereo camera parameters are then used 
to calculate the depth map and produce a 3D view of the 
scene. Nevertheless, a number of problems such as 
occlusion, ambiguity, illumination variation and radial 
distortion limit the accuracy of the disparity map, which is 
crucial in generating a precise 3D view of the scene [1]. 
Over the past years much research has been done to 
improve the performance of correspondence matching 
techniques. 
Multiresolution-based 
stereo 
matching 
algorithms have received much attention due to the 
hierarchical and scale-space localization properties of the 
wavelets [2][3]. This allows for correspondence matching to 
be performed on a coarse-to-fine basis, resulting in decreased 
computational costs.  Sarkar and Bansal [3] presented a 
multiresolution-based correspondence technique using a 
mutual information algorithm. They showed that the 
multiresolution technique produces significantly more 
accurate matching results compared to non-multiresolution 
based  algorithms, at much lower computational cost.  
Research has shown that multiwavelets (unlike scalar 
wavelets) can possess orthogonality (preserving length), 
symmetry (good performance at the boundaries via linear-
phase), and a high approximation order simultaneously [4], 
which 
could 
potentially 
increase 
the 
accuracy 
of 
correspondence matching techniques. Bhatti and Nahavandi 
[5] introduced a multiwavelet based stereo correspondence 
matching algorithm. They use the wavelet transform 
modulus maxima to generate a disparity map at the coarsest 
level. This is then followed by the coarse-to-fine strategy to 
refine the disparity map up to the finest level. Bagheri Zadeh 
and Serdean [6] proposed another multiwavelet based stereo 
correspondence matching technique. They used a global 
error energy minimization technique to find the best 
correspondence points between the same multiwavelet's 
lowest frequency subbands of the stereo pair, followed by a 
fuzzy algorithm to form a dense disparity map.  
In spite of their highly desirable advantages compared to 
scalar wavelets, the application of different types and 
families of multiwavelets in stereo correspondence matching 
has been little investigated in the literature so far. 
This paper studies the application of different types and 
families of multiwavelets in stereo correspondence matching. 
A multiwavelet is first applied to the input stereo images  to  
decompose  them   into  a  number  of  subbands. Normalized 
cross correlation is used to generate a disparity map   at   the   
coarsest   level.   In   the   case   of   balanced multiwavelets, 
as the four low frequency subbands have similar spectral 
content, they are shuffled to generate one baseband, while in 
the case of unbalanced multiwavelets, the resulting 
basebands are used to form four disparity maps and then a 
Fuzzy algorithm is used to combine the four maps and 
generate one disparity map.  
The rest of the paper is organized as it follows. Section II 
introduces a brief review of the multiwavelet transform. The 
proposed  stereo  matching  technique  for  both balanced and

MULTIWAVELET TRANSFORM 
In many respects multiwavelet transforms are very 
similar to scalar wavelet transforms. In contrast to the 
wavelet transform, which   supports   one   wavelet  and   one  
scaling   function, multiwavelets have two or more scaling 
and wavelet functions. A multiwavelet with two scaling and 
wavelet functions can be defined as [7]:

 are the multi-scaling function and 
multiwavelet function and 
Hk
 and 
Gk
are 
r × r
matrix 
filters ( r is the number of scaling- and wavelet functions). 
To date, most multiwavelets have 
r = 2
[4,7].  
One level of decomposition for a 2D multiwavelet with 
multiplicity 2 produces sixteen subbands as shown in Figure 
1, where 
LxLy
represent the approximation subbands and 
LxH y
, 
HxLy
and 
H xH y
 are the detail subbands, with 
x = ,1 2
. 
The major advantage of multiwavelets over scalar 
wavelets is their ability to possess symmetry, orthogonality 
and higher order of approximation simultaneously, which is 
impossible 
for 
scalar 
wavelets. 
Furthermore, 
the 
multichannel structure of the multiwavelet transform is a 
closer approximation of the human visual system than what 
wavelets offer. In the case of unbalanced multiwavelets, the  
resulting  approximation subbands  carry different spectral 
content of the original image (both high- and low-
frequencies), 
while 
for 
balanced 
multiwavelets, 
the 
approximation subbands contain similar spectral content of 
the original image [8]. This feature of unbalanced 
multiwavelets has the  potential to  increase  the  accuracy  of 
the calculated disparity  maps  and to  reduce  the number  of

erroneous     matches     compared    to    that    of    balanced 
multiwavelets.  
Figures 2(a) to 2(c) give a visual  comparison of the 
resulting subbands for the Antonini 9/7 scalar wavelet, as 
well as for the balanced bat01 and unbalanced GHM 
multiwavelets applied to the Lena test image. As it can be 
seen from Figure 2, multiwavelets generate four subbands 
instead of each subband that wavelets create. The resulting 
unbalanced multiwavelet subbands carry different spectral 
content of the original Lena test image, while the balanced 
multiwavelet subbands produce similar spectral content of 
the original image. More information about the generation of 
multiwavelets, their properties and their applications can be 
found in [4-7]. 
 
III. 
EVALUATION OF MULTIWAVELETS' FAMILY IN 
STEREO CORRESPONDENCE MATCHING 
The proposed stereo correspondence matching system is 
based on multiwavelets and normalized cross correlation. 
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show block diagrams of the proposed 
system 
for 
balanced 
and 
unbalanced 
multiwavelets 
respectively. A pair of stereo images is input to the stereo 
matching system. The images are first rectified to suppress 
the vertical displacement. A multiwavelet transform is then 
applied to each input stereo image. A number of different 
types and families of multiwavelets are evaluated. Since, the 
information in the approximation subbands is less sensitive 
to the shift variability of the multiwavelets, these subbands 
are used for correspondence matching purposes. In the case 
of balanced multiwavelets (Figure 3(a)), since their 
basebands contain similar spectral information, it is possible 
to use the shuffling technique proposed in [9] to rearrange 
the multiwavelet coefficients and generate a single low 
frequency subband. Figure 4 shows how four multiwavelet 
basebands are shuffled  and a single baseband is formed. 
Figure 4(a) shows the four multiwavelet basebands with 
eight pixels (two from each baseband) highlighted and given 
a unique numeric label. Figure 4(b) shows the same set of 
pixels after shuffling, where coefficients corresponding to 
the same spatial locations in different basebands are placed 
together and one baseband is generated. Normalized cross 
correlation is then employed to find the best correspondence 
points between the two basebands of the stereo images and a 
disparity map is generated.  
Figure 3(b) shows a block diagram of the unbalanced 
multiwavelet based stereo matching system. The shuffling 
technique works very well for balanced multiwavelets but it 
is not suitable for unbalanced multiwavelets due to their 
different spatio-frequency subband content. The  unbalanced 
multiwavelets basebands contain both high and low 
frequency information with  L1L1  (top left baseband)  
containing  most  of  the  image energy. For correspondence 
matching purposes, the same basebands from the two views 
are input to the normalized cross correlation block, 
generating four disparity maps as a result. As most of the 
image energy is concentrated in L1L1, its output disparity 
map  is  more reliable  than  the  other  three  disparity   maps

maps.   This algorithm   gives  a  higher   weight  to  the   
disparity  values of the L1L1 disparity map, while the 
disparity values of the  other  three  disparity  maps   are    
used   to   refine  the  final  disparity map. A median filter is 
then applied to further smooth the resulting disparity map. 
 
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS 
The performance of different types and families of 
multiwavelets in stereo correspondence has been evaluated 
using, 'Teddy' and 'Cones' stereo  test  images from the 
Middlebury stereo database [10]. Figure 5 shows the left 
image and the ground truth of these test images. The 
experimental results were generated using a number of 
multiwavelets, 
i.e. 
balanced 
versus 
unbalanced 
and 
symmetric-symmetric 
(SYM-SYM) 
versus 
symmetric-
antisymmetric (SYM-ASYM) multiwavelets (listed in   
Table I).  Table I  shows  the percentage of "bad pixels" at 
which the disparity error is larger than 1, for all regions (all). 
To give a visual comparison, the resulting disparity  maps for 
balanced GHM and unbalanced BIGHM multiwavelets, 
applied to 'Cones' and 'Teddy' test images are shown in 
Figures 6(a) and 6(b), respectively. In these figures areas 
with intensity zero represent unreliable disparities. As can be 
seen from the results presented in Table I, generally 
unbalanced multiwavelets give better results compared to the 
balanced 
multiwavelets. 
The 
symmetric-symmetric 
multiwavelets seem to produce slightly better results 
compared to symmetric-antisymmetric multiwavelets (SA4). 
However, 
the 
symmetric-symmetric 
and 
symmetric-
antisymmetric property of multiwavelets doesn't seem to 
have much effect on the resulting disparity map. From 
Figure 6, it is clear that the unbalanced multiwavelet based 
algorithm produces more accurate and smoother disparity 
maps compared to the balanced multiwavelet case. This can 
be explained by the fact that the approximation subbands of 
the unbalanced multiwavelet carry different spectral content 
of  the  input  images,  which  enables  the  matching  
algorithm to generate more reliable matches.

CONCLUSIONS 
This paper has investigated the application of different types 
and families of multiwavelets in stereo correspondence 
matching. For this purpose, two correspondence matching 
algorithms were designed to deal with both balanced and 
unbalanced multiwavelets. In the case of balanced 
multiwavelets, due to the similar frequency content of the 
four multiwavelet low frequency subbands, they were 
shuffled to generate a single baseband and then normalized 
cross correlation was used to generate a disparity map. In the 
case of unbalanced multiwavelets, the four generated 
basebands and normalized cross correlation was used to 
generate four disparity maps. These maps were then 
combined using a Fuzzy algorithm to form a single disparity 
map. The results generated using Middlebury stereo test 
images show that unbalanced multiwavelets work better than 
balanced ones in stereo correspondence matching, while the

reducing erroneous matches.
