Abstract—In the design of a contention-based bandwidth 
request scheme, decrease in data transmission delay is 
the most important factor. This paper proposes a new 
CDMA-based bandwidth request method in which the 
bandwidth request code contains the channel quality 
information and amount of bandwidth required by a 
mobile station. A mobile station composes the bandwidth 
code according to the needed bandwidth and current 
channel situation. The base station allocates uplink 
bandwidth depending on the received code. Also, the 
proposed method adopts a negative acknowledgement 
method that determines whether a transmitted code has 
been successfully detected by the base station. The 
results of the performance analysis show that the 
proposed method can reduce delay in data transmissions.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
In IEEE 802.16[1], a Base Station (BS) performs an 
uplink Bandwidth Request (BR) and grants scheduling 
with the intent of providing each Mobile Station (MS) with 
bandwidth for uplink transmissions or opportunities to 
request bandwidth. The MS should reserve the required 
bandwidth before transmitting data to the BS according to 
its scheduling type [2] [3]. The request is used to indicate 
to the BS that the MS needs an uplink bandwidth 
allocation. By specifying the scheduling type and its 
associated QoS parameters, a BS can anticipate the 
throughput and latency needs of the uplink traffic and 
provide polls or grants at the appropriate times. IEEE 
802.16 supports five scheduling types: Unsolicited Grant 
Service (UGS), real-time Polling Service (rtPS), extended 
rtPS, non-real-time Polling Service (nrtPS), and best effort 
(BE) service. UGS, rtPS, and extended rtPS are designed 
to support real-time uplink services that transport fixed-
sized or variable-sized data [4]. The BS provides periodic 
uplink allocations or transmission opportunity for them. 
For nrtPS and BE, MSs competitively request uplink 
bandwidth allocations by using a contention-based method 
[5]-[7]. The BS allocates an uplink bandwidth to 
successful requests. 
In the design of a contention-based BR, three factors 
must be considered. First, it must have a short signaling 
procedure. If the signaling procedure for a BR is lengthy, 
the delay in data transmission is increased. Second, it has 
to accept many requests with fewer contention resources. 
Third, it has to provide an acknowledgment method for an 
MS to decide whether its request was successfully 
transmitted to the BS. 
In this paper, we propose a new CDMA-based BR method 
to meet these factors. The rest of the paper is organized as 
follows. In Section II, we describe the contention-based BR 
methods in IEEE 802.16 Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiple Access (OFDMA). We propose a new CDMA-based 
BR method and an acknowledgement method in Section III. 
A mathematical performance evaluation is presented in 
Section IV. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V. 
II. 
BR METHOD IN IEEE 802.16 OFDMA 
The IEEE 802.16 OFDMA system supports two 
contention-based BR methods: a BR message-based 
contention method and CDMA-based contention method [1].  
In the BR message-based method shown in Fig. 1, when 
MSs need to ask for an uplink bandwidth allocation, they 
send BR messages on randomly selected contention 
channels. The BR message includes the number of bytes of 
bandwidth requested by the MS. The contention channels 
are composed of two slots and are dynamically allocated by 
the BS. Upon receipt of the BR message, the BS broadcasts 
an UL_MAP containing the information regarding the 
bandwidth allocation. The MS transmits data by using the 
allocated bandwidth. This BR method has a short signaling 
procedure, and can reduce the delay for the BR. However, to 
avoid performance degradation due to collisions, the BS has 
to allocate many contention channels. 
In the CDMA-based method, a BS allocates ranging 
channels and a set of BR codes for the BRs. Upon needing 
to request a bandwidth, as shown in Fig. 2, the MS selects a 
BR code from the code set with equal probability and 
generates a CDMA code corresponding to the BR code. The 
CDMA code is modulated and transmitted on a randomly 
selected ranging channel composed of six slots. After

detection of the code, the BS provides an uplink bandwidth 
with 
CDMA_Allocation_IE, 
which 
specifies 
the 
identification parameters, namely, the BR code, frame 
number, symbol number, and subchannel number used by 
the MS for transmission of the CDMA code. This allows an 
MS to determine whether it has been given an allocation by 
matching these parameters with the parameters it used. The 
MS uses the allocation to transmit a BR message. The BS 
allocates an uplink bandwidth requested with the BR 
message. In this method, the BR code is used only to 
request a bandwidth allocation for a BR message, and thus 
the delay in the signaling procedure is increased. 
In the contention-based BR method, The BS transmits 
CDMA_Allocaton_IE or uplink_allocation_IE as a positive 
acknowledgment 
of 
successfully 
received 
requests. 
However, IEEE 802.16 OFDMA does not provide a method 
enabling the MS to determine whether its request is 
unsuccessfully transmitted to the BS. In the CDMA-based 
BR method, the MS sets a predefined timer T3 upon 
transmitting 
a 
BR 
code, 
and 
waits 
for 
CDMA_Allocation_IE. The default value of T3 in the IEEE 
802.16 OFDMA is 60ms, which is 12 frames in a unit frame 
of 5ms. After the expiration of T3, the MS regards the 
transmitted code as failed and retransmits a new ranging 
code. It increases the processing time of the BR signaling 
procedure, and the system performance is deteriorated by 
increasing the delay for data transmission.  
III. 
THE PROPOSED BR METHOD AND NEGATIVE 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT METHOD 
We propose a new CDMA-based BR method to improve 
the BR method of the IEEE 802.16 OFDMA. The proposed 
method is designed for Time Division Duplex (TDD) 
systems of IEEE 802.16 OFDMA. We also propose a 
method to enable an MS to determine whether its BR code 
was successfully transmitted to the BS. 
A. The Proposed BR method 
In the proposed BR method, the BR code indicates 
the amount of uplink bandwidth, and Modulation and 
Coding Scheme (MCS), required by the MS. Fig. 3 
shows the procedure of the proposed BR method. When 
uplink data is generated, the MS composes a BR code 
that depends on the MCS level and number of slots 
required for the data transmission. The CDMA code 
corresponding to the BR code is transmitted to the BS. 
Upon detecting the BR code, the BS calculates and 
allocates the amount of bandwidth requested by the code. 
In IEEE 802.16 OFDMA, the uplink allocation that is 
provided using CDMA_Allocation_IE can be used to 
transmit a BR message or data [1]. The MS transmits 
data with the allocated bandwidth. In this signaling 
procedure, the transmission of a BR message is omitted 
because the BR code presents the information regarding 
the necessary amount of bandwidth and Channel Quality 
Information (CQI). 
The composition method of the BR code is as follows. 
The length of a BR code is 8 bits in IEEE 802.16 OFDMA. 
The proposed BR method classifies the 8-bit BR code into a 
3-bit MCS code region and a 5-bit slot code. The MCS code 
region is used to indicate a MCS code value corresponding 
to an Uplink Interval Usage Code (UIUC). The slot code 
region is used to calculate the number of requested slots. 
In IEEE 802.16 OFDMA, UIUC 1-10 is used to present 
the MCS level of an allocated bandwidth for data and the 
configuration is broadcast via an Uplink Channel Descriptor

(UCD) message. The 3-bit MCS code corresponds to an 
UIUC, an example of which is shown in Table 1. Generally, 
in TDD systems, the uplink CQI can be estimated by the 
downlink CQI because of channel reciprocity [8]. The MS 
determines the UIUC number based on the measured 
downlink CQI and chooses an MCS code corresponding to 
the UIUC number. If the UIUC number is larger than 8, the 
MCS code is set as 7. This may limit the efficient use of 
bandwidth. 
After choosing the MCS code, the MS calculates the 
number of slots

 required to transmit the uplink data,

is presented with the slot code number and the ranging

using the 5-bit slot code and the total number of ranging 
channels, R , the MS can request uplink slots up to the

If

 is greater than

, the MS requests additional 
bandwidth by piggybacking a BR message with data when 
the CDMA_Allocation_IE has been received. In this case, 
the data transmission delay is equal to that of the legacy 
IEEE 802.16. 
The MS composes a BR code with the calculated MCS 
code and slot code. In this paper, we assume that all of the 
codes are used for the BR scheme. The MS produces a 
CDMA code corresponding to the BR code and chooses a 
ranging channel number to transmit it.

The BS chooses the BR code from the successfully

by the BR code is calculated with the slot code and the

The BS allocates uplink bandwidth up to

For collision resolution, the proposed method uses the 
same truncated binary exponential algorithm as IEEE 
802.16, in which the initial window, 
0
W , is R l , where l  
is a natural number. 
B. The Proposed Acknowledgment Method 
This paper proposes an acknowledgment method that 
enables an MS to determine whether its BR code is 
successfully transmitted. The proposed method uses the 
Ranging Channel (RC) indicator and frame number for the 
negative acknowledgment.  
We propose adding an RC indicator field to DL_MAP. As 
shown in Fig. 5, the RC indicator reveals that an RC in the 
previous frames has the successfully received BR codes. 
After detecting the BR codes transmitted on each RC, the 
BS stores them in an RC buffer in the order in which they 
are received. Each RC buffer corresponds to one RC and 
one bit of the RC indicator. The length of the RC indicator 
is equal to the number of RCs. If there is a BR code stored 
in an RC buffer, the BS sets the corresponding bit of an RC 
indicator as 1. Otherwise, this value is set as 0.  
The 
frame 
number 
is 
used 
for 
the 
negative 
acknowledgement in the conjunction with an RC indicator. 
In the IEEE 802.16, BR codes have no service priority. In 
this paper, the BS serves the BR codes stored in the RC 
buffer 
on 
a 
first-in-first-out 
basis. 
The 
CDMA_Allocation_IE contains the frame number for when 
the BR code was received. Thus, the BS transmits the 
CDMA_Allocation_IEs in an ascending sequence of frame 
numbers

Fig. 6 shows the process in which an MS determines 
whether its BR code is successfully transmitted. First, the 
MS checks the bit of the RC indicator that corresponds to 
the RC number used to send its BR code. The MS considers 
a zero value as a negative acknowledgment of the 
transmitted code, and uses a truncated binary exponential 
binary 
backoff 
algorithm 
to 
perform 
the 
same 
retransmission procedure as that of IEEE 802.16. Otherwise, 
the MS receives CDMA_Allocation_IEs and compares their 
frame numbers with the frame number for when the BR 
code 
was 
sent. 
If 
the 
frame 
number 
of 
a 
CDMA_Allocation_IE is larger, the MS regards it as a 
negative acknowledgment and starts the retransmission 
procedure. If the frame number, BR code, symbol number, 
and subchannel number of the MS are the same as those of a 
CDMA_Allocation_IE, 
the 
MS 
processes 
the 
CDMA_Allocation_IE as a positive acknowledgment.  
Examples of a CDMA-based BR with the proposed 
negative acknowledgement method are shown in Fig. 7. 
In these examples, we assume that only one RC is 
allocated for the BR method. As shown in Fig. 7(a), MS1 
and MS2 transmit BR code 1 and code 2, respectively, in 
the (i+1)th frame. Code 2 is successfully detected at the 
BS, but Code 1 is not. The BS sets an RC indicator as 1 
because the RC buffer has the received code 2 and sends 
the RC indicator and CDMA_Allocation_IE. Because the 
RC indicator is 1, MS1 and MS2 receive and check 
CDMA_Allocation_IE. 
MS2 
acknowledges 
the 
successful code transmission by CDMA_Allocation_IE. 
MS1 does not receive any acknowledgment and 
continues the receiving process in the subsequent frames. 
The BS sets the RC indicator as 0 in the (i+4)th frame 
because the RC buffer is empty. MS1 perceives the 
failure of the code transmission by checking the RC 
indicator and retransmits a new BR code. In the same 
situation as in Fig. 7(a), Fig. 7(b) shows the case where 
MS3 transmits BR code 3 in the (i+2)th frame. The BS 
sends 
the 
RC 
indicator 
set 
as 
1 
and 
CDMA_Allocation_IE to the BR code 3 in the (i+4)th 
frame. 
MS1 
compares 
the 
frame 
number 
of 
CDMA_Allocation_IE with the frame number used to 
transmit its BR code. Because the frame number of 
CDMA_Allocation_IE is larger, MS1 regards it as a 
negative 
acknowledgment 
and 
performs 
the 
retransmission process. 
IV. 
NUMERICAL ANALISIS AND RESULTS 
We assume a perfect channel and equal receiver power and 
consider that the data size is generated with exponential 
distribution. The CDMA code corresponding to the BR code 
is modulated using binary phase-shift keying and 
transmitted on 144 subcarriers [8]. When

The detection of a CDMA code is performed by exploiting 
its cross-correlation property [9]. If the scalar product of the 
received code sequence and CDMA code exceeds a certain 
threshold, T , the BR code that corresponds to the CDMA 
code is detected as transmitted [10].

We analyze the performance of the proposed method 
using Table 2. Fig. 8 shows the probability that an MS 
successfully transmits a BR message or BR code to the 
BS in the contention-based BR method. The CDMA-
based method has higher probability than that of the BR 
message-based method when the same number of slots is 
used. This is because a ranging channel in the CDMA-
based method is able to transmit different multiple BR 
codes using the property of a CDMA code. 
Fig. 9 shows the mean delay of the legacy CDMA-
based BR method and the proposed CDMA-based BR 
method 
without 
adopting 
the 
proposed 
negative 
acknowledgement. The proposed BR method can omit 
the BR message transmission procedure because the BR 
code contains the information about a MCS level and 
amount of slots required by the MS. Thus, the proposed 
BR method can shorten the signaling procedure and 
reduce the mean delay for data transmission. 
In the proposed BR method, when the size of 
Nreq
 is 
less than 
Nmax
, the MS can request all the bandwidth for 
data transmission by the BR code procedure. Thus, if the 
mean size of data is smaller or the ranging channels are 
further allocated, the data transmission delay can be 
reduced as shown in Fig. 10.  
Fig. 11 shows the mean delay of the proposed BR method 
with or without the negative acknowledgement method. If 
adopting the negative acknowledgement method, the MS can 
quickly determine whether the BR code was successfully 
transmitted and start the retransmission procedure faster. 
Thus, the mean delay is decreased.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we propose a new CDMA-based BR 
method and negative acknowledgment method for nrtPS 
and BE. The proposed BR method matches the BR code 
to the channel quality and the necessary number of slots. 
After the receipt of a BR code, the BS allocates the

uplink bandwidth requested by the BR code. Also, the 
proposed negative acknowledgment method uses an RC 
indicator field in DL_MAP and the frame number of a 
ranging response message. The RC indicator indicates 
whether there are any successfully received codes in an 
RC. The BS sends the response messages to the received 
codes on a first-in-first-out basis. The MS checks the RC 
indicator and frame number of the response messages to 
determine whether the ranging code is unsuccessfully 
transmitted to the BS. Therefore, the proposed method 
will be able to support a faster data transmission.
