Abstract — Satellite communications provides an effective 
solution to the ever increasing demand for mobile and 
ubiquitous 
communications 
especially 
in 
areas 
where 
terrestrial communication infrastructure is not present. IP 
multicasting is a bandwidth saving technology, which could 
become an indispensable means of group communication over 
satellites since it can utilise the scarce and expensive satellite 
resources in an efficient way. In Source-Specific Multicast 
(SSM) the data is sent through a multicast tree from the source 
to all the receivers. However, if a source is a mobile node 
moving from one network to another, then special mechanisms 
are required to make sure this multicast tree does not break. 
Until now, while many research efforts have been made to 
provide IP multicast for the mobile nodes, they are mainly 
focused on terrestrial networks. Unfortunately, the terrestrial 
mobile multicast schemes are not directly applicable in a 
satellite environment. This paper proposes a new mechanism 
to support multicast source mobility in SSM based applications 
for a mesh multi-beam satellite network with receivers both 
within the satellite network and in the Internet. In the 
proposed mechanism, the SSM receivers continue to receive 
multicast traffic from the mobile source despite the fact that 
the IP address of the source keeps on changing as it changes its 
point of attachment from one satellite gateway (GW) to 
another. The proposed scheme is evaluated and the results 
compared with the mobile IP home subscription (MIP HS)-
based approach. The results show that the proposed scheme 
outperforms the MIP HS-based approach in terms of signaling 
cost and packet delivery cost.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Traditionally, satellites have been usually treated as a 
transparent pipe that carries data between a GW and the 
receivers. Nowadays, the new generation of satellite systems 
are characterised by support for on-board processing 
(switching/routing) and multiple spot beams. Regenerative 
satellites with on-board packet processing can provide full-
mesh, single-hop connectivity between two or more satellite 
terminals/gateways. Multiple spot beams in regenerative 
satellites further enhance the overall satellite capacity with 
the help of frequency reuse within different narrow spot 
beams. These new features enable the satellite to make 
efficient use of its allocated resources and provide cost 
effective network services. This paper is an extension of [1] 
presented at IARIA conference, MOBILITY 2013. 
IP multicasting is a technology in which a single copy of 
IP data is sent to a group of interested recipients. It 
minimises overheads at the sender and bandwidth use within 
the network. This explains why IP multicast is considered as 
an important mechanism for satellite networks, which can 
have the potential to reach many customers over large 
geographical areas.  
In IP multicasting, there may be many sources sending 
data to a single multicast group for example: group voice 
chat. In SSM, a group member of such a multicast group, G 
may request to receive traffic only from one specific source, 
S. Unlike in any source multicast (*, G) [2], where a group 
member might receive unwanted traffic from some sources, 
in SSM, a group member subscribes to specific multicast 
channels (S, G) [2] of interest. This implies SSM saves 
more bandwidth resources than any source multicast. In 
satellite networks, where bandwidth resources are scarce 
and expensive, this could be a very significant and 
compelling factor for SSM. IP mobile multicast over 
satellites can be used to communicate important service 
information like the weather conditions, on-going disaster 
zones and information, route updates, etc., in long haul 
flights, global maritime vessels and continental trains. 
Multicasting this information to all the interested parties 
rather than individually informing them (i.e., unicast) would 
save a lot of satellite bandwidth resources. 
In SSM, a multicast distribution tree is setup with the 
source at the root and receivers as the end leaf node and the 
routers forming the intermediate nodes in the tree. The data 
is then sent from the root with the routers in the network 
replicating the data only when necessary for delivery until a 
copy reaches all intended downstream group members. 
Various issues arise if the receivers or source of the 
multicast group are mobile and move from one network to 
another as this may affect this multicast distribution tree. 
Handover of a mobile multicast receiver from one point of 
attachment to another has a local and single impact on that 
particular receiver only. However, the handover of a mobile 
source may affect the entire multicast group, thereby 
making it a critical issue.  
A mobile multicast source faces two main problems; 
transparency and reverse path forwarding (RPF). In SSM, a 
receiver subscribes to a multicast channel (S, G) [2]. During 
a handover, as the source moves from one network to 
another, its IP address will change. When the source uses 
this new IP address, i.e., care-of address (CoA) [3] as source

address to send traffic, the multicast router in the foreign 
network cannot forward the multicast packets until a 
receiver explicitly subscribes to this new channel (CoA, G). 
This is known as the transparency problem.  
A multicast source-specific tree is associated to source 
location, i.e., the source is always at the root of the source-
specific tree. The RPF check compares the packet’s source 
address against the interface upon which the packet is 
received. During handover, the location of the source will 
change (and consequently its IP address), thus invalidating 
the source-specific tree due to the RPF check test. Hence, 
the RPF problem relates to the fact that the mobile source 
cannot use its home address in the foreign network as the 
source address to send packets as this will result in a failure 
of the RPF mechanism and the ingress filtering [4].  
This paper is based on the Digital Video Broadcasting 
Return Channel Satellite (DVB-RCS/RCS2) system, which 
is an open standard that defines the complete air interface 
specification for two-way satellite broadband scheme. DVB-
RCS/RCS2 is today the only multi-vendor VSAT standard 
[5]. The return link in DVB-RCS/RCS2 is based on a 
multiple-frequency time-division multiple-access (MF-
TDMA) scheme, where the return channel satellite terminals 
(RCSTs) are allocated capacity in slots within a certain time 
and frequency frame. Due to the vendor independence and 
popularity of the DVB-RCS/RCS2 standard, customers with 
DVB-RCS/RCS2 compliant equipment have a wide variety 
of satellite operators and service providers to choose from. 
This flexibility lowers the equipment and operational costs 
[6].  
The organisation of this paper is as follows. In Section 
II, the literature review on existing SSM techniques and 
their applicability to satellite networks are given. Section III 
presents the new network architecture and the further 
extended Multicast Mobility Management Unit (M3U) 
proposed in [1] for source mobility support. Detailed 
description of the operation and processing proposed 
mechanism has been provided. New analytical models have 
been proposed in Section IV, for calculating the signaling 
cost and packet delivery cost in order to evaluate the 
performance of the proposed scheme. Section V presents the 
analysis of the obtained results. Finally, the conclusions are 
presented in Section VI.  
II. 
 PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SSM 
A few mobile multicast source support techniques for 
SSM have been proposed for terrestrial Internet. These are 
far from being applicable in a satellite scenario. Due to the 
problems of transparency and RPF, remote subscription [3] 
–based approaches cannot be applied to mobile multicast 
sources for SSM. On the other hand, MIP HS-based 
approach [3] (which relies on mobile IP in terrestrial 
networks) can support both mobile receivers and sources 
(including SSM senders) by the use of bi-directional 
tunnelling through home agent (HA) without facing the 
problems of transparency and RPF.  
Following the MIP HS mechanism, bi-directional 
tunnelling between the mobile source under target GW and 
its home GW (serving as HA) [7] could be used to tunnel 
multicast traffic for delivery onto the source-specific tree. 
This is used to maintain the mobile source identity.  If this 
MIP HS-based approach is used in mesh satellite networks, 
the mesh communication concept, i.e., a single hop over the 
satellite will be lost and there would be some RPF issues 
when the home GW tries to deliver the traffic onto the 
source-specific tree over the satellite. Mesh SSM 
communication, where the receivers and mobile source are 
all RCSTs of the same interactive satellite network, will no 
longer be possible since the mobile source has to tunnel 
traffic from its foreign location to its home GW to be 
delivered on to the source-specific tree. 
The authors in [8] used the shared tree approach 
proposed Mobility-aware Rendezvous Points (MRPs), 
which replace the home agents in their role as mobility 
anchors. It is proposed in this approach that the MRP builds 
a Multicast Registration Cache (MRC) for mobile multicast 
sources. This cache is used to map the permanent home 
address (HoA) of the mobile source with its temporary CoA. 
Based on the MRC information, a new Multicast 
Forwarding Table (MFT) format is also proposed, in which 
each multicast source will be referenced by the two 
addresses (HoA and CoA) instead of a unique IP address. 
This solution introduces a new registration method for IP 
mobile multicast source. The mobile source registers only 
once with the MRP by sending a Source Registration (SR) 
message. To send multicast data, the mobile multicast 
source encapsulates its data packets, and then sends them to 
the MRP. Before forwarding the encapsulated packets, the 
MRP checks first whether the multicast packets are coming 
from a registered and trusted mobile multicast source or not. 
If so, it decapsulates these packets, and then sends them 
using the (HoA, G) header to the multicast receivers. When 
the mobile source moves to a new IP subnet within the MRP 
service area, the source's MRP is implicitly notified about 
the CoA change. In case of inter-domain multicasting, if the 
source moves to a new domain, it has to register again with 
the local MRP in that domain. The new MRP notifies 
remote MRPs about the source address change. There is at 
least one MRP per domain. The MRPs rely on triangular 
routing and tunnelling to fulfil their role as mobility anchors 
during intra-domain and inter-domain trees setup. This 
approach also re-introduces rendezvous points, which are 
not native to SSM routing. The introduction of new 
entities/messages for example, the MRP, new registration 
message (of mobile sources to MRPs whenever they move 
into a new domain), MRP Peer-to-peer Source Active (SA) 
[8] and keep-alive messages (required to track the source's 
MRP attachment point changes) during inter-domain 
multicasting, coupled with the modification of the standard 
Multicast Forwarding Table (referenced by the two 
addresses, HoA and CoA instead of a unique IP address) 
make this approach very complicated and not suitable for

satellite networks. Also, large number of signaling messages 
proposed in this mechanism is not good for satellite 
networks as they consume the scarce and expensive satellite 
bandwidth. 
Authors in [9] and [10] introduced Tree Morphing and 
Enhanced Tree Morphing (ETM), respectively, which are 
routing protocol adaptive to SSM source mobility. The 
concept of the source tree extension or elongation as the 
source moves from the previous designated multicast router 
(pDR) to new designated router (nDR) is not applicable in 
satellite scenario because the delivery tree rooted at the 
source in one GW cannot be extended to that same source 
when it moves to a different GW. This makes the 
fundamental design concept of these extensions not 
consistent with the nature of satellite networks. 
SSM source handover notification approach proposed by 
authors in [11] suggested adding a new sub-option in the 
standard IPv6 destination binding option known as SSM 
source handover notification. During handover, the source 
after acquiring new IP address will notify receivers to 
subscribe to the new channel. The problems here are the 
large amount of signaling traffic over satellite air interface 
and the fact that some receivers may be unsynchronized to 
source handovers, leading to severe packet loss. 
In [12], the authors proposed multicast source mobility 
support in proxy mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domains for 
terrestrial networks. Based on the specifications in [13], 
multicast data arriving from a downstream interface of an 
Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [12] proxy will be 
forwarded to the upstream interface and to all but the 
incoming downstream interfaces that have appropriate 
forwarding states for this group. Thus, multicast streams 
originating from an mobile node (MN) will arrive at the 
corresponding Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) [14] and 
directly at all mobile receivers co-located at the same 
Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and MLD Proxy instance. 
Serving as the designated multicast router or an additional 
MLD proxy, the LMA forwards the multicast data to the 
Internet, whenever forwarding states are maintained by 
multicast routing. If the LMA is acting as another MLD 
proxy, it will forward the multicast data to its upstream 
interface, and to downstream interfaces with matching 
subscriptions, accordingly. One of the drawbacks here is 
that there are no mechanisms to supress upstream 
forwarding to LMA even when there are no receivers. This 
waste of network resources could pose a serious problem in 
a satellite environment. Triangular routing is also an issue 
here when a mobile receiver and a source, all having 
different LMAs are attached to the same MAG. In such a 
situation, the MAG has to forward traffic upstream to the 
corresponding LMA of the mobile source, which will tunnel 
the traffic to the corresponding LMA of the mobile receiver 
which then tunnels the traffic back to the same MAG for 
delivery to mobile receiver, causing waste of network 
resources in the whole domain. The fact that in proxy 
mobile IPv6 domain, the LMA is the topological anchor 
point for the addresses assigned to mobile nodes within the 
domain (i.e., packets with those addresses as destination are 
routed to the LMA), the role of the LMA and MAG does 
not fit well into a global interactive multi-beam satellite 
network with many Transparent/Regenerative Satellite 
Gateways [15], each having different IP addressing space. 
The authors in [1] proposed a solution consistent with 
the DVB-RCS/RCS2 satellite network specifications that 
supports SSM source mobility within the satellite network. 
The idea of reserving IP addresses for the mobile Return 
Channel Satellite Terminals (mRCSTs) in all foreign 
networks (i.e., under all potential target gateways) is not 
efficient in utilisation of the allocated IP address space. This 
will lead to scalability issues especially with increasing 
number of satellite terminals requiring IP addresses, as the 
IP address space is limited. This paper is an extension of our 
previous proposal in [1] with the following  modifications: 
• 
No IP addresses are reserved for mobile sources 
(mRCSTs) in foreign networks. 
• 
The satellite is a regenerative one with on-board 
processing (OBP) at layer 2 of the protocol stack, 
capable of replicating multicast traffic on-board the 
satellite. This further saves the satellite bandwidth 
resources as only one  copy of the multicast traffic will 
be sent to the satellite air interface for all beams with 
interested receivers instead of one for each beam as was 
proposed in [1]. 
• 
The functioning, location and the type of messages 
issued by the Multicast Mobility Management Unit 
(M3U) proposed here are quite different from those 
proposed in [1]. These changes further help in 
providing an effective support for source mobility.   
III. 
PROPOSED MULTICAST SOURCE MOBILITY 
MECHANISM FOR SSM IN REGENERATIVE SATELLITE 
NETWORK 
The satellite terminals like the regenerative satellite 
gateways (RSGW), RCSTs and mobile RCSTs are assumed 
to be IP nodes with layer 3 capability. In this satellite 
network, 
the 
routing 
function 
is 
organised 
as 
a 
‘decentralized 
router’. 
In 
a 
client/server [16] like 
architecture, part of the routing functions are located in the 
RCSTs/RSGWs/mRCSTs (clients) and the other part of 
them within the Network Control Centre (NCC), i.e., 
routing server. Each time a client needs to route an IP 
packet, it asks the server for the information required to 
route this packet. The routing information sent by the server 
(NCC) is then saved in the client. 
Each time an IP packet comes into the satellite system, 
the ingress RCST/RSGW determines where to send the 
packet, the final target being to get the destination RCST’s 
MAC address. The ingress RCST/RSGW look within its 
routing table to find if the route on the satellite path exist. If 
it does not exist, it issues an ARP towards the NCC, through 
the connection control protocol (C2P) [15] connection 
request message [16]. Since the connection and switching

on-board the satellite is defined here at layer 2 of the 
protocol stack, the knowledge of MAC addresses of the 
RCSTs is mandatory to establish a connection. This means 
that the NCC provides the mechanisms required to associate 
the IP address and MAC address of a RCST/RSGW [16]. 
In the control plane, Internet Group Management 
Protocol (IGMP) messages are exchanged between the NCC 
and the IGMP Proxy contained in the RCSTs. Also, the 
IGMP messages are exchanged between User Terminals and 
IGMP Querier included in the RCSTs as shown in Figure 1. 
IGMPv2 general Query, Specific Group Query, Report and 
Leave messages are exchanged over the satellite air 
interface 
between 
the 
NCC 
and 
the 
RCSTs/RSGWs/mRCSTs.  
As illustrated in Figure 1, all satellite entities transmit 
using DVB-RCS and receive using DVB by Satellite (DVB-
S). The two existing satellite transmission standards, DVB-
RCS and DVB-S are combined by the OBP into a single 
regenerative multi-spot satellite system allowing a full 
cross-connectivity between the different up link and down 
link beams. 
A. Network Architecture 
Figure 2 shows the network architecture, where a mobile 
multicast source is located at its home network in beam 1 
and the receivers are in beams 1, 2, 3 and 6. GW_A1, 
GW_A2, GW_A3, GW_A4, GW_A5 and GW_A6 serves 
beams 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The multicast 
receivers in the terrestrial network as shown in Figure 2 are 
served through GW_A1. The mobile source sends out just 
one copy of multicast traffic and the OBP replicates the 
traffic, one for each of the four beams that has interested 
receivers. GW handover (GWH), which involves higher 
layers (i.e., network layer), will take place at the 
overlapping areas between beams. IP multicast source 
mobility support is therefore implemented at GWH. 
B. Source Mobility Support with Multicast Mobility 
Management Unit (M3U) at Gateway Handover. 
In order to develop an effective solution to support 
source mobility, the following general assumptions have 
been made:  
• 
The regenerative satellite has OBP – switching at layer 
2 to provide on-board connectivity between different 
beams. 
• 
The NCC will act as the IGMP querier for the satellite 
network in addition to its normal functionalities. 
• 
The NCC enables the establishment of point-to-
multipoint connection between mobile source (mRCST) 
and all listening RCSTs/RSGWs. 
• 
All RCSTs function as IGMP Proxy, i.e., IGMP Router 
and Querier on its user interface (interface towards the 
internal LAN) and an IGMP Host on the satellite 
interface. 
• 
All RCSTs, mRCSTs and RSGWs are mobility-aware 
nodes and can process mobility instructions.

TABLE I. PROPOSED NEW MESSAGES  
 
A new Multicast Mobility Management Unit (M3U) 
responsible for control plane signaling to provide mobility 
support for multicast sources is proposed. This new M3U 
entity located at the NCC is equipped with the following:  
• 
A database of all mRCSTs, each identified by its 
physical (MAC)  and IP addresses 
• 
A ‘Message Chamber’ which can issue the new 
proposed signaling messages.  
Three new types of messages shown on Table I have been 
proposed in this paper. It is proposed that any mRCST 
should be able to issue Channel Update Message (CUM) 
after receiving Service Interface Update Message (SIUM) 
from the NCC during GWH. Details of these messages are 
given in Table I.  
When the NCC receives the synchronization (SYNC) 
burst from the mobile source (mRCST) containing the 
handover request, it will retrieve the target beam identity 
from its database and determine whether the beam belongs 
to a different GW. Once the NCC establishes that the target 
beam belongs to a different GW, a  GWH is initiated. The 
NCC will then update its service information (SI) tables 
which include Terminal Burst Time Plan (TBTP), Super-
frame Composition Table (SCT), Frame Composition Table 
(FCT) and Time-slot Composition Table (TCT). The NCC 
will send an SNMP Set-Request message that includes the 
updated SI tables and the routing update information (RUI) 
of the mRCST to the target GW to ensure that the target 
GW gets ready for connection with the mRCST. Upon 
reception of the SNMP Set-Request message, the target GW 
will allocate bandwidth resources and IP address to the 
mRCST according to the new burst time plan sent by the 
NCC. The SNMP Get-Response message is then sent by 
target GW to the NCC. 
Once the NCC receives the SNMP Get-Response 
message from target GW,  the M3U immediately issues the 
Source Handover Message (SHM) to the NCC unit (NCCu), 
requesting the point-to-multipoint link between the source 
and all the listening RCSTs/GWs (from previous tree). 
SHM is internal signaling within the NCC (i.e., between 
M3U and NCCu). Upon reception of SHM, the NCCu will 
make the resources available and then instructs the OBP to 
establish the required connections. This is immediately 
followed by the M3U issuing the SIUM to all RCSTs/GWS 
involved in this particular channel, including the mobile 
source.  The SIUM contains both the mobile source old and 
new IP addresses in the old and new GWs, respectively. The 
SIUM 
also 
contains 
instructions 
for 
all 
listening 
RCSTs/GWs to update source list (add mobile source new 
IP address) in the service interface for requesting IP 
multicast reception [17]. This will create a new channel that 
contains the mobile source new IP address (CoA) under the 
target GW. This action ensures that subsequently, when the 
RCSTs/GWs receive IGMP join Report from downstream 
receivers for this new channel, no IGMP report will be sent 
to the satellite air interface since the channel already exist in 
the RCST/GW multicast routing table. The creation of this 
new channel by the SIUM is possible in satellite networks 
because the NCC knows:  
• 
The mac and IP address of all active RCSTs/GWs,  
• 
The newly acquired IP address of the mobile source, 
• 
All RCSTs/GWs that are members of the channel 
involving the mobile source.  
Therefore, the NCC can enable the establishment of a 
point-to-multipoint connection between the mobile source 
and all the listening RCSTs/GWs directly. This reduces the 
amount of traffic on the satellite air interface, thus saving 
scarce and expensive satellite bandwidth resources. The PID 
of the channel may remain the same. Upon reception of 
SIUM, the mobile source immediately issues CUM, i.e., 
CUM is triggered by reception of SIUM. The CUM is sent 
just like any multicast user traffic by the mobile source 
through source-specific tree to all SSM receivers. 
After 1 round trip delay of issuing SIUM (for mobile 
source to receive SIUM and issue CUM), the NCC issues 
SNMP Set-Request message, which includes the mRCST 
(mobile source) identity and the SI tables to the source GW.  
The source GW then acknowledges the NCC by sending a 
SNMP Get-Response message. Once the SNMP Get- 
Response message is received from source GW, a GWH 
command is issued to the mRCST from NCC in a Mobility

Control Descriptor carried in a Terminal Information 
Message Unicast (TIMu) using the old beam. The source 
GW now updates its route mapping table and released 
resources used by the mRCST. Once the mRCST receives 
the handover command, it synchronizes with the NCC and 
the target GW, retunes itself to the target beam.  
Figure 3 shows the proposed signaling sequence to 
support multicast source mobility for SSM at GWH. This 
signaling sequence contains the proposed new messages 
integrated into the standard GWH signaling sequence as 
described in the DVB-RCS specification in [7]. The NCC 
acting as satellite IGMP querier keeps control of the 
multicast groups and also builds the SSM tree based on the 
on-board 
connectivity 
between 
different 
beams. 
Periodically, the NCC sends out the Multicast Map Table 
(MMT) [16] to all multicast receivers. The MMT which 
contains the list of IP multicast addresses each associated 
with a specific Program Identifier (PID) enables listening 
RCSTs/GWs to receive multicast traffic from groups which 
they are members of. When the NCC receives an IGMP join 
report for SSM, the M3U checks the source-list to see if 
some sources are mRCSTs. If some sources are identified as 
mRCSTs, the M3U will a keep record of them in its 
database.  
Upon reception of CUM by SSM receivers in the 
Internet, a new SSM delivery tree construction to the target 
GW is triggered as shown in Figure 4 (compared to that in 
Figure 2). Figure 4 shows the mobile source now in beam 2 
after a successful GWH. If the Target GW was not a 
member of the old multicast channel, it will issue an IGMP 
join report to NCC as soon as it gets the updated channel 
subscription request (PIM-SSM Join) from receivers in the 
Internet. The target GW now becomes part of the mesh 
receivers within the satellite network as it assumes the 
responsibility of serving receivers in the Internet. But if the 
target GW was already a member, a multicast reception 
state will simply be created against the interface upon which 
the PIM-SSM join was received.  It should be noted here 
that CUM is delivered through serving GW to the SSM 
receivers in the Internet before the resources used by the 
mobile source in the serving GW are released and also 
before retuning and switching by the mobile source to the 
target GW begins. This is so, because it is only through the 
serving GW (old SSM delivery tree) that CUM can reach all 
the SSM receivers in the Internet. 
When the SSM receivers in the LAN behind the 
listening RCSTs receive the CUM, they will update their 
channel subscription by issuing unsolicited IGMP join 
report towards the RCST. Upon reception of the IGMP join 
report, the RCST (IGMP Proxy) will check its multicast 
routing table to see whether that channel already exist. On 
checking, the RCST will discover the existence of the 
channel in its multicast routing table thanks to the action of 
SIUM as described above. Therefore, this will prevent the 
RCST from issuing IGMP join Report onto the satellite air 
interface, thus saving satellite bandwidth resources.

C. M3U operation and processing 
Figure 5 shows the processing flowchart of the control    
plane information (signaling traffic) through the M3U. For 
correct signaling to take place, M3U must be able to identify 
the following: 
• An IGMP packet (i.e., an unsolicited IGMP join report) 
in order to add the requesting RCST/GW on the delivery 
tree. 
• Mobile multicast source or receiver (mRCST) and 
differentiate between the two. 
• GWH request and target GW. 
• Target GW signaling (SNMP) to get the mRCST newly 
allocated IP address. 
 
1) IGMP Packet Identification 
When the NCC receives any signaling traffic, the M3U 
checks the IP destination address and the protocol number 
on the IP packet to determine whether it is an IGMP packet. 
If the IP destination address is equal to 224.0.0.1 (for 
IGMPv1&2) or 224.0.0.22 (for IGMPv3) and the protocol 
number is equal to 2, then the IP packet is an IGMP packet 
and is then it is sent to Stage 2 in Figure 5, otherwise, it is 
sent to Stage 4.

2) mRCST Identification 
In Stage 2 of Figure 5, the task is to determine whether 
the source-list in the received IGMP packet contains any 
mobile source (mRCST). The M3U  checks the IP addresses 
contained in the source-list against the list of mRCSTs in 
the database to find out whether the requesting RCST/GW 
is requesting to receive multicast traffic from a mobile 
source (mRCST) or not. If source-list contains any 
mRCSTs, then those mRCSTs are mobile multicast sources. 
The mRCSTs contained in source-list of received IGMPv3 
join report are then recorded in Stage 3 as mobile sources 
based on the analysis in Stage 2 given above. Finally, the 
IGMP packet is then forwarded to the NCC (querier). 
 
3) mRCST Signaling Detection 
At Stage 4, the main task is to separate signaling traffic 
coming from any mRCST from those of fixed RCST. To do 
this, the M3U has to check the source mac/IP address of the 
signaling traffic received against the database to establish 
whether it is coming from a mRCST or not. All signaling 
traffic coming from any mRCST is sent to Stage 5 for close 
examination to find out whether they are synchronisation 
(SYNC) burst containing handover recommendation while 
the rest is sent to Stage 6. Once it is confirmed that it is a 
SYNC burst in Stage 5, with handover recommendation, 
then the target GW identity is known and its MAC/IP 
address recorded. Following this process, a table of mRCST 
versus target GW (identified by their MAC/IP addresses) 
can be established for all mRCSTs in the whole interactive 
satellite network. This now prepares the M3U to expect 
GWH signaling response from the target GW. 
 
4) Target GW Response Detection and the mRCST 
allocated IP address recording  
Now, knowing the identity of the target GW (from the 
handover recommendation), signaling traffic from the target 
GW can be tracked within the NCC to find out whether it is 
the response to the  GWH request initiated by the NCC. 
This is very important because earlier knowledge of the 
allocated IP address to the mRCST by the target GW 
contained in this GWH response is very crucial here for 
further signaling.  
Therefore, Stage 6 examines the source MAC/IP address 
of all signaling traffic to see whether it is that of the target 
GW. If it does, then the packet is sent to Stage 7, if not, then 
to NCCu. In Stage 7, the destination port number of the 
packet is checked to find out whether it is equal to that of 
SNMP (i.e., 161), the signaling protocol used in GWH as 
specified in [7]. If this is so, then, the packet is sent to Stage 
8, where the allocated IP address to the mRCST in the target 
beam is extracted and recorded. Once the M3U is aware of 
the mRCST’s IP address in the target beam, it immediately 
issues the SHM to the NCCu, requesting for a point-to-
multipoint connection establishment as explained above. It 
is therefore imperative that the M3U gets the mRCST’s IP 
address in the target beam as soon as possible in order to 
minimise the multicast handover latency during GWH. If 
the destination port is not equal to 161, then, the packet is 
simply sent to the NCCu for normal signaling. The issuing 
of SHM is immediately followed by that of SIUM to all 
mesh SSM receivers including the mobile source as 
explained above. 
The uniqueness about this proposal are: the new re-
subscription mechanism of the satellite receivers and 
gateways to the new multicast channel (CoA, G) after every 
GW handover without the issuing of IGMP join report over 
the satellite air interface, the absence of encapsulation 
(tunnelling) and triangular routing paths throughout the 
system 
and 
its 
compliance 
with 
DVB-RCS/S2 
specifications. If all the listening RCSTs/GWs were to 
individually issue IGMP join reports to the satellite air 
interface for re-subscription after GWH, the total number 
would be enormous and will put a lot of strain on the 
satellite bandwidth resources. The proposed solution will 
significantly save satellite bandwidth resources. 
IV. 
ANALYTICAL MODEL 
Under this section, analytical models for GWH signaling 
cost and packet delivery cost (when mobile source is away 
from home) are developed to evaluate the proposed mobile 
multicast source GWH procedure for SSM. These are then 
compared with MIP HS–based approach (see Section II), 
which appears to require only minimal changes to support 
multicast source mobility for SSM in a satellite 
environment. The other schemes for multicast source 
mobility SSM which are mainly defined for terrestrial 
networks will require major changes to be applicable in 
satellite networks. This explains why the performance 
evaluation of the proposed M3U scheme is compared only 
with that of the MIP HS-based approach.

In this analysis, signaling cost (Csign) and the packet 
delivery cost (CPD) before and after GWH are evaluated. 
Signaling cost is defined as the accumulative signaling 
overhead for supporting mobile multicast source GWH in a 
multi-beam satellite network and is calculated as the product 
of the size of mobility (handover) signaling messages and 
their hop distances [18]. Packet delivery cost (CPD) on the 
other hand is the accumulative traffic overhead incurred in 
delivering a packet along a routing path. CPD is calculated 
by multiplying the data packet size by the hop distance. 
Here, only the packet delivery cost within the satellite 
network (satellite receivers) will be considered before and 
after the GWH for both our scheme and the MIP HS–based 
approach. Table II shows the messages sizes and number of 
hops used for the analysis. These parameters are referenced 
from [1][19][20]. The hop distance between any two 
satellite terminals under different GWs is assumed to be 1. 
This is because each GW has a different IP address space, 
hence a different IP network.  
 
A. Modelling the Proposed M3U scheme 
Figure 6 shows the signaling messages (extracted from 
Figure 3) involved in the proposed M3U scheme for 
multicast source mobility support. It is assumed here that 
the target GW was not yet a member of the multicast 
channel served by the mobile source, so an IGMP join 
report is issued by the target GW to NCC after receiving an 
updated channel subscription request (PIM-SSM Join) from 
receivers in the Internet (see Figures 2 and 4).  It is also 
assumed in Figure 6 that SNMP–Request and SNMP-
Response messages carrying the SI tables, RUI and 
allocated bandwidth resources + IP address have the same 
packet length or size. From Figure 6, the signaling cost per 
GWH for the proposed M3U scheme C

B. Modelling of MIP HS-based approach 
The MIP HS or bi-directional tunnelling approach relies 
on mobile IP architectural entities, i.e., HA and mobile node 
(mRCST). When the mobile source moves away from its 
home network at GW_A1 to a foreign network at GWA_2, 
it has to register its care-of address [23] to its HA at home 
network.

A. Signaling Cost 
Figure 8 shows the signaling cost at GWH for the 
proposed M3U scheme as compared with the MIP HS-based 
approach. These results are obtained by substituting the 
numerical values of the parameters in (2) and (6), 
respectively. From Figure 8, it can be seen that signaling 
cost of the MIP HS-based approach is much higher than that 
in the proposed M3U scheme. The extra signaling cost for 
location update at the HA is one of the major reasons for the 
higher GWH signaling cost in MIP HS-based approach. By 
making use of (11) and (12), the total signaling cost during 
GWHs for the proposed M3U and MIP HS-based schemes, 
respectively, are investigated in Figures 9 and 10. In Figure 
9, the radius of the satellite beam is set at 5000 Km and the 
total signaling cost is measured as the velocity of the 
mRCST (mobile source) is varied from 0 to 1000Km/h. 
Figure 9 reveals that the total signaling cost increases as the 
velocity of the mobile source increases. This is expected, 
since the higher the velocity, the more the frequency of 
GWH (border crossing) and hence, the higher total signaling 
cost.  It can also be deduced from Figure 9 that the total 
signaling cost for MIP HS-based approach is generally 
higher than that for the proposed M3U scheme. These 
results show that in a similar multi-beam satellite network 
providing mobility support, satellite terminals on slow 
moving platforms like the maritime vessels will incur less 
signaling cost (overhead) than those on fast moving 
platforms like long haul flights (aircrafts). 
On the other hand, Figure 10 shows how the total 
signaling cost changes with varying satellite beam radius at 
a fixed mobile source velocity of 750Km/h. As shown in 
Figure 10, the total signaling cost reduces as the radius of 
the satellite beam increases. This is true because the larger 
the satellite beams (radius), the fewer the number of GWHs 
required by the mobile source travelling at a constant 
velocity. But the smaller the satellite beam, the more the 
number of GWHs required for any satellite terminal 
travelling at a constant speed.

More GWHs implies more signaling cost and vice versa. 
Although the recent trend in satellite beam size is moving 
towards narrow beams instead of big beams, the main 
reasons are the power requirements of the RCST and the 
frequency reuse (to increase capacity). Figure 10 also shows 
that the proposed M3U scheme outperforms the MIP HS-
based approach in total signaling cost against radius of 
satellite beam.  
The results in Figure 10 could be particularly important 
to designers of global multi-beam satellite networks that 
support mobility, as the sizes of the GW beams will have an 
effect on the overall handover overhead. 
B. Packet Delivery  Cost 
The packet delivery cost for both schemes after GWH 
obtained by making use of (4) and (9), are investigated in 
Figure 11. The display in Figure 11 shows that packet 
delivery cost increases as the session transmission rate 
increases. Also, Figure 11 shows that for any particular 
session transmission rate, the packet delivery cost for MIP 
HS-based approach is much higher than that for the 
proposed M3U scheme. This is consistent with the fact that 
in the proposed M3U scheme, there is mesh communication 
with a single hop over the satellite even when the mobile 
source is away from home and also, there is no 
encapsulation (tunnelling) of multicast packet at all in any 
stage. But in MIP HS-based approach, packet delivery has 
to undergo a double hop transmission over satellite (i.e., 
through HA), thus incurring higher packet delivery cost. 
Also, the higher multicast packet delivery cost in MIP HS-
based approach when the mobile source is away from home 
is due to the fact that tunnelling is employed to route 
packets between the mobile source and the HA. The extra IP 
packet header here increases the packet delivery cost. 
From all the results presented in Figures 8, 9, 10 and 11, 
the proposed M3U scheme outperforms the MIP HS-based 
approach.

VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Support for IP mobile multicast over bandwidth 
constrained environments like satellites is very important, as 
it efficiently makes use of the available bandwidth resources 
and thus provide cost effective network services. Due to 
transparency and reverse path forwarding problems, the 
handover of a mobile multicast source in SSM from one IP 
network to another will result to the breakage of the 
multicast delivery tree. While some solutions to support 
multicast source mobility in SSM have been proposed for 
the internet, it was seen that these are not very suitable in a 
satellite network.  
This paper proposes a suitable solution for multicast 
source mobility for SSM in a multi-beam satellite network. 
It presents the network architecture and proposes a new 
Multicast Mobility Management Unit (M3U) located at the 
NCC. Also, three new control messages have been proposed 
to provide IP mobility support to the mobile multicast 
source during GWH. The functioning of the M3U and the 
new control messages provide an elegant and effective 
solution for the mobile multicast source transparency and 
RPF problems in SSM.  
Performance evaluation for the proposed M3U scheme 
and the MIP HS-based approach was carried out using 
signaling cost during GWH handover and packet delivery 
cost after GWH. Provided other factors remain constant, the 
results obtained show the following:  
• The total GWH signaling cost is directly proportional to 
the speed of the mobile source, i.e., the higher the speed, 
the higher the total GWH signaling cost and vice versa. 
• The total GWH signaling cost is inversely proportional 
to the radius of the satellite (gateway) beam, i.e., the 
total GWH signaling cost reduces as the radius of the 
satellite beam increases and vice versa. 
• The packet delivery cost is directly proportional to the 
session transmission rate. This means that the packet 
delivery cost increases as the session transmission rate 
increases and reduces as the session transmission rate 
reduces. 
In all scenarios investigated, the results obtained show that 
the proposed M3U scheme outperformed the MIP HS-based 
approach in terms of total GWH signaling cost and packet 
delivery cost when the mobile source is away from home 
network. 
For future work, ways of integrating the proposed M3U 
scheme into PMIPv6-based IP mobility over satellite will be 
examined. This could potentially lead to faster and better 
handover performance compared to the individual M3U or 
PMIPv6 scheme.
