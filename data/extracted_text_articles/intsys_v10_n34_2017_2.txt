I. INTRODUCTION 
     The 
highly 
competitive 
nature 
of 
the 
wireless 
communications 
market 
and 
constantly 
evolving 
communication standards have resulted in short design 
cycles and product lifetimes. The talking point is to provide 
area and power efficient integrated design for Digital Down 
Converter (DDC) for 3G Applications [1]. In the recent past, 
telecommunications techniques have achieved a wide 
popularity, mainly due to the huge diffusion of cellular 
phones and wireless devices. The request for more complex 
and complete services, such as high speed data transmission 
and multimedia content streaming, has moved many 
research groups in the electronic field towards the study of 
new and efficient algorithms, codes and modulations. In 
Software Defined Radios (SDR), most radio receiver 
processing functions to be run on a general purpose (GP) 
programmable processor rather than being implemented 
strictly on non programmable hardware. The functionality 
of SDR receiver processor can be changed via “software 
reprogramming.” The concept of SDR is now an IEEE 
Standard, i.e., IEEE P1900 [2]. These radios are 
reconfigurable through software updates. For high end 
digital signal processing where the highest possible 
performance is needed at low power consumption, ASICs 
are still the processors of choice. However, ASICs are very 
expensive and require long time in design and development. 
ASICs are inherently rigid and unsuitable to the applications 
that 
are 
constantly 
evolving. 
For 
these 
reasons, 
Programmable Logic Devices like Field Programmable Gate 
Arrays (FPGAs) have been emerged as an alternative to 
ASICs in wireless communication systems. FPGAs are 
mainly used for the flexibility they provide. The FPGAs 
suffer from the drawbacks of inefficient resource utilization, 
high cost and power consumption [3]. The cost factor can be 
improved by using less expensive FPGAs for system design 
and by efficient utilization of FPGA resources. The power 
factor can be improved by optimal usage of SRAM which 
can be taken care during FPGA manufacturing by using 
various techniques [4].  
 
     ASIC is an integrated circuit that is used for a particular 
application. It is composed of series of circuits that are taken 
from the technology dependent library to generate gate –
level net list to implement the required functionality [5]. 
ASICs provide an advantage of high speed as compared to 
other programmable devices like PLDs, PALs and FPGAs  
since they are designed to perform a specific task. ASICs 
can be made compact by incorporating significant amounts 
of circuitry onto a single chip, which results in minimum 
power 
utilization 
[6]. 
By 
reducing 
inter-package 
interconnections, ASICs help in reduction of noise. ASICs 
provide increased performance at relatively low power 
consumption and comparatively less area-delay product 
(ADP). Besides, it consumes less energy per sample (EPS) 
and gives cost effective and reliable solutions [7]. Hence, 
ASICs are mainly used to increase the performance and 
power efficiency of the circuits but inability to reconfigure 
is the major drawback associated with these devices. The 
FPGA based DDC design [1] is extended to DDC ASIC to 
improve the performance in terms of area and power. 
FPGA’s though providing the advantage of flexibility still 
leads to improper utilization of resources. So, having an 
integrated solution, i.e., a dedicated ASIC design for the 
proposed DDC will lead to further reduction of resources in 
terms of area and power. This results in cost effective

Figure 1. Flow Diagram of ASIC in Cadence 
     Figure 1 depicts the flow of ASIC in Cadence 
environment. In the present paper, the proposed design is 
implemented in technology dependent 90 nm foundry at 1.2 
V. Firstly, the design is coded in Verilog hardware 
description language and then the gate level netlist is 
synthesized and the results are verified using pre-synthesis 
waveforms. Then the physical design implementation is 
done to find the total number of cells, area and power 
consumption and the results are verified using post-
synthesis waveforms.  
II. DIGITAL DOWN CONVERTER 
     The Software Defined Radio system can change its radio 
functions by swapping software instead of replacing 
hardware, seems to be the best solution given that mobile 
standards are springing up like mushrooms [8]. SDR 
thereby makes it possible to reprogram cell phones to 
operate on different radio interface standards. But that’s not 
all. Putting much of a radio’s functionality in software 
opens up other benefits. A mobile SDR device can cope 
with the unpredictable dynamic characteristics of highly 
variable wireless links [9]. SDRs use a single hardware front 
end but can change their frequency of operation, occupied 
bandwidth, and adherence to various wireless standards by 
calling various software algorithms. Such a solution allows 
inexpensive, efficient interoperability between the available 
standards and frequency bands [10]. Figure 2 illustrates 
SDR BS receiver that consists of two sections – a front-end 
high-data rate processing section and a back-end symbol 
rate or chip-rate processing section.

     Reconfigurable 
architectures 
provide 
flexible 
and 
integrated system-on-chip solutions that accommodate 
smooth migration from archaic to innovative designs, 
allowing recycling of hardware resources across multiple 
generations of the standards [11]. Software defined radio 
(SDR) technology enables such functionality in wireless 
devices by using a reconfigurable hardware platform across 
multiple standards. Sampling rate converters play important 
role in SDR systems [12]. Digital up-converters (DUCs) and 
digital down-converters (DDCs) are important components 
of every modern wireless base station design. DUCs are 
typically used in digital transmitters to filter up-sample and 
modulate signals from baseband to the carrier frequency 
[13]-[15]. DDCs, on the other hand, reside in the digital 
receivers to demodulate, filter, and down-sample the signal 
to baseband so that further processing on the received signal 
can be done at lower sampling frequencies. They are more 
popular than their analogue counterparts because of small 
size, low power consumption and accurate performance 
[16]-[22]. 
 
  DDC performs decimation and matched filtering to remove 
adjacent channels and maximize the received signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) [23]. For the reference WCDMA DDC design, 
the carrier bandwidth is = 5.0 MHz, Number of carriers is = 
1, IF sample rate is = 61.44 MSPS, DDC output rate 7.68 
MSPS, Input precision is = 14 bits, Output precision is = 16 
bits and Mixer resolution 0.25 Hz approximately and SFDR 
up to 115 dB is required. The DDC input is assumed to be 
real, directly coming from the ADC. The mixer translates 
the real band pass input signal from intermediate frequency 
to a complex baseband signal centred at 0 Hz. 
Mathematically, the real input signal is multiplied by a 
complex exponential as shown in Eq. (1) to produce a 
complex output signal with real and imaginary components  
Eq. (2) and Eq. (3) respectively. The sinusoidal waveforms 
required to perform the mixing process is obtained by using 
the Direct Digital Synthesizer (DDS). The decimators in the 
DDC need to down sample the IF data from 61.44 MHz 
back to 2x chip rate. The factor of 61.44/7.68 = 8 can be 
partitioned using different possible configurations. The 
down sampling by eight at once will result in an extremely 
long filter length and result in an inefficient hardware 
implementation. The use of shaping filter with decimation 
factor of 2 allows the remaining stages to be implemented as 
either one half band filter with decimation factor of 4 or two 
half band filters with decimation factor of 2 each. The 
second configuration is more suitable for hardware 
implementation because of less hardware consumption [24]-
[26].

misalignment. The response of the filter is shown in Figure

IV. HARDWARE SYNTHESIS AND SIMULATION 
     In the proposed DDC designs CORDIC algorithm based 
optimized DDS design is used in place of DDS compiler 
block to generate sinusoidal waveform needed for frequency 
translation [27]. The FIR Compiler blocks of existing 
designs are replaced by equiripple techniques based 
decimators for optimal filter length to reduce the hardware 
requirement. It is further supported by the half band filter 
concept to improve the computational complexity for 
enhanced 
speed. 
Finally, 
Poly-phase 
decomposition 
technique is utilized in hardware implementation of 
proposed design to optimize both speed and area together by 
introducing the partially serial pipelined MAC architecture. 
The third stage of decimation has been developed using 
efficient RRC filter [28] design. All the decimators are 
implemented using MAC Algorithm with optimal number 
of embedded multipliers of target FPGA along with 
pipelined registers to enhance the speed performance and 
resource utilization. The Virtex-II Pro FPGA device is used 
for implementation that contains 136 embedded multipliers 
[29].  
 
     Two designs have been developed using different input 
output precisions. DDC is implemented using input 
precision of 14 bits and output precision of 16 bit and DDC 
2 is implemented using input and output precision of 12 
bits. The developed DDCs are simulated using Modelsim 
Simulator. The output response of DDC1 is shown in Figure 
11 and output response of DDC 2 is shown in Figure 12. It 
can be observed from the simulated waveforms that the 
output response of both the designs is similar but speed 
performance of DDC2 is better as compared to DDC1.

19% in speed and DDC 1 provide almost same speed as that 
of existing DDC design. The developed DDC designs have 
shown better resource utilization as compared to DDC 
design of [24] which is shown in Table II. Bar graph of the

V.  ASIC DESIGN ANALYSIS 
     An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), is an 
integrated circuit (IC) customized for a particular use, rather 
than intended for general-purpose use. A chip designed to 
run in a specific environment is an ASIC. ASICs use a 
hardware description language (HDL) to describe the 
functionality of ASICs such as Verilog or VHDL. The 
design is coded in Verilog hardware description language 
(HDL) [30, 31]. Here, ASIC implementation is done to 
calculate the power, delay, total no. of cells and area. The 
proposed filter is designed and simulated using 90nm 
technology 
cadence 
environment. 
Initially, 
RTL 
is 
developed from Verilog file as shown in Figure 14 which is 
verified using Pre synthesis simulation as shown in Figure 
15. Physical design implementation is performed using 
optimized placement and routing as shown in Figure 16. 
Finally placed and routed DDC is validated using Post 
synthesis waveforms as shown in Figure 17. The 
performance of developed DDC was evaluated for different 
parameters as shown in Table III. It can be observed from  
result analysis that proposed DDC require 601mm2 area and 
consume 3169.61 nW  power.

VI. CONCLUSION 
     This paper presents an efficient and cost effective DDC 
design for software defined radios. The proposed DDC 
designs are developed and implemented on multiplier based 
Virtex II Pro target FPGA using optimized MAC algorithm. 
Three decimator stages are optimized separately and then 
cascaded together. The optimized DDC has been developed 
using partially serial pipelined MAC algorithm for area and 
speed optimization. The ASIC realization of the proposed 
design is done to find the power consumption of the DDC 
circuit. From the results, it is concluded that the proposed 
design obtained has low power consumption, i.e., 3169.61 
nW and reduced area utilization, i.e., 601mm2. The DDC 
designs are efficiently floor planned and routed to achieve 
the desired timing constraints. The developed DDCs have 
shown improved resource utilization to provide cost effective 
solution for software radios in terms of low power 
consumption and reduced area.
