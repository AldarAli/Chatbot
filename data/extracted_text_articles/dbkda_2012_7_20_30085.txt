Abstract — This survey became possible due to coming request of 
one of Siemens Business Units to look for data anonymization 
solutions being presented in the market today. The customer 
plans to implement and deploy it within software development 
projects to provide offshore team with a fully functional 
environment without any critical data in it.  Critical data are, for 
instance, Personal Identifiable Information (PII), which is related 
to the nature of business application to be developed. In this 
survey paper, the introduction to data anonymization topic is 
given, the major challenges in data privacy an IT company may 
face during outsourcing of software development are considered, 
and the results of evaluation of data anonymization tools are 
provided.

 INTRODUCTION  
The outsourcing of software development is becoming a 
common practice in Siemens due to global structure of the 
company. Either the whole development process or its 
particular phases like design, implementation or testing can be 
outsourced. Transfer of the testing process only to a remote 
location is still a rare practice since it requires special 
consideration regarding intellectual property, security and 
privacy [1]. In this paper, we consider the problem of data 
privacy during outsourcing of the testing process for those 
business domains where data management in applications is 
especially important [2]. Usually, such applications deal with a 
lot of private information such as names, addresses, phone 
numbers, customer names, bank accounts, transactions, so, it is 
very important to hide this information from off-shore test team 
[3]. On the other hand, the environment for the test team has to 
be as identical to the production as possible. In this situation, 
data anonymization solution may help.  
In this work, we provide an introduction to data 
anonymization topic (Section II), review of major challenges 
related to data privacy that an IT company may face during 
outsourcing of software development (Section II), and 
evaluation results of data anonymization tools from vendors in 
SAP and non-SAP domains (Sections III and IV).  
II. 
DATA ANONYMIZATION 
A. Definitions 
Data Anonymization (also referred as data obfuscation, data 
masking, de-sensitization, de-identification or data scrubbing) 
is the process that helps to conceal private data. It protects 
sensitive information in production data base so it can be 
transferred to a test team. Data anonymization can be classified 
to pure anonymization [2] and pseudo-anonymization [4]. Pure 
anonymization does not provide any possibility to reconstruct 
the initial data, while pseudo-anonymization indeed provides 
such possibility through special algorithms. The former 
approach is the most reliable when the highest security is 
required, while  the latter one might be interesting in the 
situation when the issue found by the test team has to be 
reproduced with production data values. 
Let us consider the following example: a database with 
personal information (names, birth dates, bank accounts) need 
to be transferred to the offshore test team. The following 
typical data anonymization approaches can be applied to hide 
sensitive information:  
• 
Data generation. Completely new data are generated. 
Special cases for dates and bank accounts need to be 
properly handled. 
• 
Data encryption. The data is simply encrypted. Can be 
restored if the key is saved. 
• 
Shuffling. The data is shuffled in one column. In this 
case the combination (name, bank account) will not be 
real. 
Also pseudo anonymization approach can be implemented 
with almost any anonymization technique in the following 
way: there is a special database, which keeps track of the 
changes during application of the anonymization algorithms. If 
the reverse operation is required the lookup over this database 
returns the old value. 
In the real situation, the combination of the approaches 
applied for different data fields can be considered: data 
generation for card numbers, data encryption for some 
description field and shuffling for personal names and 
addresses. 
In 
our 
tools 
evaluation, 
we 
consider 
different 
anonymization algorithms as well as other criteria described in 
sub-section B. 
B. Criteria 
The following criteria have been used to evaluate data 
anonymization tools. We must note that the criteria described 
below belong to purely technical features of tools, while 
163

business-related requirements (like licensing, maintenance 
costs, etc.) of the tools overview are out of scope of this paper. 
SAP and non-SAP solution – this criterion points to a tool’s 
ability to cope with data management applications from SAP 
(SAP is a market leader in enterprise application software. SAP 
stands for Systems, Applications and Products in Data 
Processing) and non-SAP domains. Significant number of 
Siemens business divisions uses SAP products in their projects. 
According to [5], businesses that run SAP face a common 
challenge: how to get real SAP data into non-production 
systems for testing, training and Production support. The key 
issue is that, while new data reflecting the latest business 
activity is constantly being added to Production, business users 
cannot easily access this data.  Non-production updates are 
essential for testing newly-developed features, production-
support issues, and support packs. However, using live SAP 
data for testing is becoming increasingly difficult. Client or 
system copies disrupt the landscape, require large amounts of 
disk space, take a long time to prepare, and increase technical-
support overheads. These challenges have to be taken into 
account as far as the testing activities are planned to outsource 
where data privacy become critical. So it becomes obvious that 
data anonymization solution for SAP applications cannot be 
standalone and has to be integrated in overall data-copy 
solution. 
Out of the box SAP schemas support – a tool provides out-
of-the-box the solution for different SAP types of the system, 
i.e., SAP ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning System 
including such parts as HCM – Human Capital Management, 
FI – Financing. LO – Logistics) and SAP CRM & SRM 
(Custom Relationship Management System and Supplier 
Relationship Management System, accordingly). Important 
issue here is a specific set of data within each SAP scheme and 
a tool’s ability to mask such data. 
Such variety of types of application data makes us 
searching for vendors which provide support on data copy and 
data anonymization for the most of SAP system types. 
Especially it concerns the availability of pre-defined data 
transformation (conversion) rules in a solution. The examples 
of such conversions for HR data implemented in Data Sync 
Manager for HCM tool are shown in Fig. 1. 
 
Figure 1.  Conversions for HR data. 
Multi Database – underlying database used in a project puts 
certain constraints on a data anonymization solution. Ability to 
work with different databases or independence of underlying 
database widens the application scope of a tool. This criterion 
is not relevant and would not be considered for SAP-dedicated 
data anonymization solutions. 
Resulting security – since we want to protect our sensitive 
data the level of security needs to be assured. Usually test data 
generation tools have the highest security level since the data in 
non-production environment will be completely different from 
the source system. 
In general, data anonymization algorithms can be grouped 
in three categories: data generation algorithms, algorithms 
which are dealing with already existing data and the 
combination of the above.  
The first group includes all algorithms, which create 
completely new entries in the data base; they are used for 
anonymization of bank accounts, credit card numbers, social 
security numbers, generating random numbers, dates, etc. 
The second group of algorithms operates with already 
existing data in the data base. The typical examples in this 
group are: shuffling of the fields in one or several columns, 
encryption, scrambling the letters in the string or figures in 
numbers and so on. 
Also it is possible to make a combination of the algorithms 
from the above groups, e.g., shuffle the fields in one of the data 
base columns and add a random number as a string literal at the 
end of the field. 
Preserving application and data integrity – data 
anonymization technologies should satisfy a simple, yet strict 
rule: the application that runs against masked data performs as 
if masked data is real [6]. 
This is a MUST requirement for every data anonymization 
tool since without conforming to this criterion the resulting 
database will be useless. The main focus during evaluation has 
been done on the tool ability to preserve data relations 
automatically (without user assistance). 
Support of roles assignment – tool offers different roles to 
operate and use tool’s functions. There might be system 
administrator role, super user role, user role with different sets 
of access rights to project data. 
According to [6], there are four phases for data masking 
lifecycle identified: Data discovery and analysis, Data planning 
and modeling, Developing and Implementation. 
The goal of Data Analysis phase is to identify the data that 
needs to be masked in order to sufficiently protect the data 
without compromising data utility. At this phase, the highest 
level of access a tool’s user has to be provided assuming the 
work with data mining and analysis of customer data. 
The Planning and Modeling phase is designed to set in 
place the criteria that will be used within your environment to 
mask the data and create context around the info that was 
discovered in first phase. The work to be done at this phase is 
not supposed to deal with critical data itself, rather than is 
related to selection of data anonymization rules and data 
anonymization strategy at all.

DBKDA 2012 : The Fourth International Conference on Advances in Databases, Knowledge, and Data Applications

The Develop phase is designed to build data masking 
configuration suites based upon customer specific Functional 
Masking Needs. Again, the preparation of data anonymization 
scripts and the proper configuration of data masking rules 
within a tool do not assume the direct access to customer data. 
The Implementation and Execution phase is designed to put 
in place a plan for integrating data masking into the overall 
production-to-non-production business process. This work 
mostly should be done in place (creating test database(s), 
moving masking scripts to source code implementation 
libraries, etc.); thus, requiring assignment of special persons to 
perform it and granting temporal access to the production 
database. 
Batch operation support – due to possibly huge amount of 
sensitive data to be transferred to non-production environment, 
due to time-consuming tasks of creating non-production copies 
itself it would be useful to be able to plan and run such tasks 
from scripts. 
Algorithms for anonymization – here, the different 
alternatives have been considered: test data generation, 
encryption, data masking within several masking rules, pseudo- 
anonymization, dynamic data masking, etc. 
It has to be noted that most of the evaluated data 
anonymization tools provide possibility for customization of 
data masking algorithms.  Such possibility allows for 
implementing almost every imaginable algorithm, however it 
requires significant time to study programming techniques 
(from simple JavaTM subroutine in Camouflage Enterprise to 
ABAP routine in Data Sync Manager or even a pluggable C++ 
library in IBM Optim™.). That is why this particular criterion 
is focused on the algorithms which are provided by the tool 
out-of-the-box. The default list of data transformers available 
in the Camouflage Enterprise is presented on Fig. 2.

TOOLS ANALYSIS 
There was a wide range of solutions found for data 
anonymization task in SAP and non-SAP domains. Moreover, 
in the market, we faced with several vendors who usually 
provide products in non-SAP domain, nevertheless they did not 
refuse to elaborate a data anonymization solution for SAP 
business applications (e.g., Grid Tools Ltd, UK). Other 
vendors, like IBM (US), are able to keep a separate product 
line to cope with data privacy projects in SAP domain. The 
tools found for each domain are summarized below. 
There have been also found the test data generation 
solutions as well as non-commercial software. 
Let us shortly introduce the found tools structured in a three 
domains: SAP, non-SAP and universal. 
A. SAP tools 
SAP® Test Data Migration Server (TDMS) [7] software 
from the market leader allows for extracting data from the 
production system and creating test landscapes of lower 
volume of data. Despite of tight integration of this solution 
with SAP systems, such issues like unknown anonymization 
algorithm 
(sales 
department 
could 
not 
provide 
such 
information) and time-consuming installation and setup 
procedure to be performed only by SAP consultants 
compromised the perspectives of this tool. 
Accenture Clone and Test HCM (Accenture Software 
for SAP HCM) [8] enables the simple configuration of reliable 
and realistic test environments using actual data from the 
current SAP ERP HCM system. Within copying data and 
creating clone the tool provides rule-based data scrambling. 
The solution deserves the serious attention due to no specific 
customization during setup and relatively fast copying 
procedure. The clear disadvantage of such tool is its limit of 
support of SAP schemas. 
The product from GASPARIN Software Solutions, 
hr.dat.copy [9] is a pure transport of personnel data (HR data) 
across systems and/or clients. It allows for modification or 
anonymization of personnel numbers or other sensitive data; 
however the application scope of such solution is rather 
limited. 
BCV5™ solution from (Enterprise Systems Associates, 
Inc, IBM affiliate) [10] stands for fast, reliable copying and 
refresh / replication of DB2 data. It is rather fast solution 
customized for IBM mainframe. 
Data Sync Manager for HCM from EPI-USE [5] 
pretends to be the most complete data anonymization solution 
for SAP systems (support can be extended to other schemas of 
SAP ERP as well as to SAP SRM and CRM). The solution is 
realized as a transport to both SAP source and target systems, 
thus no additional hardware and middleware required. Along 
with seamless integration with SAP system the setup of the tool 
requires no specific customization, and graphical representation 
of workflow for creating clones along with data masking 
procedures proved to be very clear and comprehensible.   
B. non-SAP tools 
With Oracle Enterprise Manager Data Masking Pack 
[11] from Oracle sensitive information such as credit card or 
social security numbers can be replaced with realistic values, 
allowing production data to be safely used in development and 
165

testing or shared with out-source or off-shore partners for other 
non-production purposes. The clear advantage of this solution 
is a library of templates and format rules used, constantly 
transforming data in order to maintain referential integrity for 
applications. However, the possibility to use the tool with other 
DBs needs to be investigated. 
Camouflage Enterprise from Camouflage Software Inc., 
US [6] provides complete tool-chain for data management 
tasks from data sub setting and data masking to creating copies 
of production system. It also delivers the highest level of 
customizable masking with Masking Engine, Scripting Engine 
and database specific transformers. Extendable and scalable for 
large organizations, with highly user-friendly interface this 
solution proves to be a key player in the market of non-SAP 
data anonymization solutions. 
Jumble DB from Orbium Software [12] is a complete 
data scrambling solution for Oracle and SQL Server databases. 
Despite of moderate scalability and standard data masking 
features (scrambling), the vendor declares the tool’s capability 
to keep referential integrity intact. 
FieldShield 
product 
from 
Innovative 
Routines 
International (IRI), Inc. [13] masks private data at the field 
level with obfuscation and encryption functions which are 
applied according to your business rules. It works with data in 
the format of sequential flat files extracted from database 
(Oracle and DB2 are supported). Despite of multiplatform 
support and wide set of data anonymization technologies (from 
encryption till masking via custom functions) this solution 
offers non-trivial workflow which threatens to be very time-
consuming. 
DataVantage Global ® [14] solution from Direct 
Computer Resources, Inc., protects confidential health, 
financial, personnel and other data and uses data obfuscation 
and encryption methods for this. It declares multi-database 
support and provides only graphical user interface to perform 
data anonymization tasks. 
Data Masker [15] software from Net 2000 Ltd removes 
sensitive data from test databases and replaces it with realistic 
looking false information. Along with existing data scrambling 
rules a user is allowed to define her ones. Tools editions are 
defined on a per DB type base (Oracle, SQL, DB2). 
C. Tools providing universal solutions 
Datamaker™ [3] solution from Grid Tools Ltd creates 
data from scratch, creates subset databases, de-identifies (mask 
or obfuscate) existing data and bulks up data for performance 
testing. The vendor declares the support of all known databases 
across multiple platforms. It is worth to be mentioned that 
based on existing products the solution for data anonymization 
in SAP domain can be found and developed as well. 
Tricryption® [16] solution from Eruces, Inc. provides 
secure replacement of sensitive identifiable data with 
anonymous but unique alias/pseudonym labels. Pros and cons 
of pseudo anonymization were discussed in Section II. 
Nevertheless, the encryption technology used in this product 
might be rather powerful to gain the resulting security of data 
anonymization while preserving the possibility to recover data. 
Anyway it might be useful for so called “anonymization in 
place” and not relevant in the case of offshore development and 
testing. 
dgmasker™ [1] solution from dataguise Inc. masks data 
to help enterprises meet various compliance requirements such 
as PCI, HIPAA, GLBA, PII and SOX. The vendor declares the 
support of Oracle, DB2 and MS SQL Server databases, 
multiple advanced masking algorithms and tool’s capability to 
perform data anonymization of SAP applications. 
ActiveBase Security™ [17] product ActiveBase Ltd is 
another novel solution which offers a new approach to database 
security. It protects production environment by adding a 
security layer within and around business applications, masking 
or scrambling sensitive information in real time with no 
changes to applications or databases. Due to this independence 
of the solution from underlying data model in database SAP 
ERP, CRM applications are supported. 
Optim™ [18] from IBM presents the complete data 
management solution for all known databases and significant 
number of application types like SAP Apps, PeopleSoft, Jd 
Edwards EnterpriseOne, Siebel Apps etc. It delivers powerful 
data transformation capabilities to mask personal information 
within a structured workflow of extracting data from 
production and sending it to development, test and training 
systems on demand. 
IV. 
EVALUATION PROCEDURE 
The evaluation procedure for the above tools has been 
separated into three different phases: 
Market Evaluation – Comprised high level market analysis 
to choose most promising tools with regard to specified criteria 
for further technical evaluation. 
This study has been performed using available marketing 
materials 
and 
calls 
to 
vendor 
representatives. 
16 different tools described in Section III were found and 
screened according to the specified criteria. As the result of this 
phase 8 different tools proposed for further studies had been 
presented to the customer, who selected three of them for 
technical evaluation. 
Solution Design – Comprised the preparation for technical 
evaluation of 4 tools-candidates selected at the previous project 
phase. 
The technical evaluation of selected tools required the 
representative database, which has been defined and prepared 
during this phase. Two systems were used: Oracle database 
with MES data for evaluation of tools’ capabilities in non-SAP 
domain and system with SAP HR data for evaluation of tools in 
SAP domain. 
Technical Evaluation – Comprised evaluation of the tools-
candidates which was intended to perform on test system with 
real data. The study included application of selected solutions 
and clarification of its capabilities on sample datasets. 
This phase has been carried out by applying the tools in the 
real data anonymization scenarios. Special use cases have been 
designed to verify tools capabilities: 10 use cases for non-SAP 
166
Copyright (c) IARIA, 2012.     ISBN:  978-1-61208-185-4
DBKDA 2012 : The Fourth International Conference on Advances in Databases, Knowledge, and Data Applications

data and 12 use cases for SAP data. These use cases covered 
common difficulties in data anonymization process: foreign-
primary key relationships, triggers, dependency between 
different columns (e.g., dates dependency), user-defined 
objects and fields in SAP system, bank accounts, application of 
custom anonymization algorithms, etc. 
Quantitative assessment of capabilities of 4 tools-
candidates turned to be possible at this phase. Firstly, the 
customer provided the cross comparison of the evaluation 
criteria in order to define the “relative importance” of each 
criterion. The results of such cross comparison are presented in 
Table I. Secondly, there was performed the benefit value 
analysis of the tools-candidates which received as an input the 
list of weighted criteria and the criteria values from our 
technical evaluation. The results of the benefit value analysis 
are summarized in Table II.  
V. 
SUMMARY 
The results of data anonymization tools market evaluation 
have shown that there is a wide range of solutions available for 
data anonymization task in SAP and non-SAP domains. 
The solutions usually offer the longer list of functionality for 
creating non-production environment in addition to data 
anonymization, e.g., identification of sensitive data, data 
subsetting, 
application 
templates, 
and 
data 
copying. 
However in most cases practical applicability of the promising 
data anonymization solutions has to be confirmed in the course 
of more detailed study with involvement of trial versions of 
evaluated solutions. 
Camouflage DLM Suite (Camouflage Software Inc.) and 
DataVantage Global® tools in non-SAP domain and Data 
Sync Manager (EPI-USE) for SAP domain have been 
preliminary selected as the most promising data solutions due 
to the following distinctive characteristics: 
• 
User-friendly GUI and relatively short learning curve 
• 
Comprehensive workflow and intuitive interface 
• 
Available predefined conversions/masking rules for 
the most types of sensitive data 
• 
Sensitive data identification can be provided by the 
vendor. 
In this work data anonymization solutions only have been 
studied. Nevertheless, Camouflage DLM Suite aims at full 
functional support of creating non-production environment 
(sub setting, sensitive data identification, data masking) and 
provides the average learning curve for future users. 
Camouflage allows for masking the data in non SAP 
applications working with databases. 
DSM covers SAP application domain providing transparent 
workflow for creating non-production environment and large 
set of pre-defined conversions for SAP ERP business objects.
