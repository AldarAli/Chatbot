Abstract—Precise formation flying (PFF) missions require 
formation acquisition and maintenance through interactions 
among spacecraft by inter-satellite communication and relative 
navigation. That requires the network architecture to satisfy 
dedicated system constraints of time-criticality for updating 
navigation measurements and flexibility for implementation 
across various phases of mission operations. Potentially 
applicable architectures that combine different multiple access 
technologies, half-duplex/full duplex configurations, and 
network topologies are discussed and evaluated. Half-duplex 
CDMA with roles rotating among all spacecraft is shown more 
suitable and efficient for PFF missions. Its limitation in terms 
of multiple access interference is analyzed as well.

 INTRODUCTION 
Precise formation flying (PFF) missions involve the 
acquisition and maintenance of spacecraft in a desired 
relative geometric configuration, especially when trying to 
create a large virtual spaceborne instrument, such as 
telescope or interferometer. Coordinating the components of 
such instruments on separate spacecraft can require highly 
accurate relative orientation and positioning.  
The common way to perform such PFF missions is to use 
differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) by 
exchanging GNSS-based navigation measurements via inter-
satellite links [1]. Yet this method is limited to low earth 
orbit (LEO). Many missions such as PROBA-3, Darwin and 
TPF require the spacecraft flying in high earth orbit (HEO) 
or Lagrange points, where GNSS signals are very weak or 
not available at all [2]. As a result, a dedicated formation 
flying radio frequency (RF) technique using locally 
generated inter-satellite ranging signals is necessary. It is 
expected to integrate with inter-satellite communication for 
system efficiency. Thanks to the widespread use of spread 
spectrum techniques, RF signals modulated with a pseudo 
random noise (PRN or PN) code appears to be advantageous 
in such integrated system, since they allow both reliable 
communication and accurate ranging measurements [3].  
In considering the properties of communication and 
ranging driven PFF network, interactions among spacecraft 
should satisfy system constraints including time-criticality of 
updating measurements, and flexibility for implementation 
across various phases of mission operations. This paper will 
address these constraints, and propose potentially applicable 
architectures that use fixed assignment for all possible 
connections by multiple access (MA) technologies. The 
applicable combinations among different MA, half-
duplex/full duplex configurations, and network topologies 
are discussed and evaluated.  
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the inter-
satellite communication and relative navigation sensor is 
introduced in order to propose the dedicated constraints for 
PFF network in Section III. Candidate network architectures 
and their comparison are presented in Section IV. Network 
capability in terms of multiple access interference is 
analyzed in Section V. Section VI concludes the paper and 
discusses future directions. 
II. 
INTER-SATELLITE COMMUNICATION AND RELATIVE 
NAVIGATION SENSOR 
An inter-satellite sensor for PFF missions is under 
development that should integrate communication and 
relative navigation into one package. The method traces 
heritage to GPS-like technology and is expected to satisfy 
the following specific high-level requirements: 
 
Communication 
and 
relative 
navigation 
are 
integrated into one package, with mass less than 2 
kg, and power consumption less than 2 W; 
 
Operating range less than 30 km; 
 
Omni-directional (4π steradian) coverage; 
 
Flexible to implement across various phases of 
mission operations in two modes: coarse-mode 
during the deployment, reconfiguration and collision 
avoidance tasks; fine-mode during the formation 
maintenance process; 
 
Navigation accuracy is 1 m for coarse-mode using 
code measurement (pseudorange) only, and 1 cm for 
fine-mode using the combination of code and carrier 
phase measurements; 
 
Resolution of related integer ambiguity problem of 
carrier phase measurement; 
 
Measurement update rate ≥ 1 Hz. 
The inter-satellite sensor functional block diagram is in 
Fig. 1. Software-defined transceiver is used, in which way 
the signal generation and processing is accomplished via a 
programmable microprocessor e.g. FPGA or DSP. The 
current transceiver version implements the signal generation 
and processing on PC via Matlab/Simulink. 
As shown in Fig. 1, the software-defined transceiver 
comprises the transmitter and receiver front-end part and

signal simulator and processing part. The front-end is based 
on hardware design that comprises signal amplifier, band 
pass filter, down-conversion, sampling, and quantization. 
The signal simulator and processing are realized only based 
on software through the signal generation module to generate 
carrier and PRN code modulated signal, and acquisition, 
tracking and decoding modules for data recovery, code and 
carrier phase extraction, and pseudorange (-rate) derivation. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Inter-satellite sensor functional block diagram 
Fig. 2 depicts the signal generation and processing 
simulation results assuming that intermediate frequency (IF) 
is 9.55 MHz and a sampling rate is 38.19 MHz. In signal 
simulator, PRN code is generated with a chipping rate of 
10.23 Mcps and length of 1023 chips. Compared to GPS C/A 
code, such signal can increase the theoretical lower bound of 
code tracking accuracy of approximately 3 times better at the 
same noise level and same front-end bandwidth according to 
the Cramér-Rao lower bound theory [4]. Doppler shift is 
generated following a linear function.  
The process of acquisition is a global search in a two 
dimensional search space for approximate values of Doppler 
shift and code phase. This process is time and computation 
consuming. 
Therefore, 
parallel 
code/frequency 
one-
dimensional search using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is 
implemented. After acquisition, control is handed over to 
delay lock loop (DLL) and phase lock loop (PLL), which 
yield fine estimates of code and carrier phase continuously 
and track the variations due to dynamics between satellites. 
Communication bits can be extracted from the tracking 
loops. Pseudorange measurements are derived afterwards.

CONSTRAINS ON PFF NETWORK ARCHITECTURE 
A. Time-critical requirements 
Time-critical requirements are driven by the nature of 
dynamic relative navigation process that contains two steps: 
propagation in the filter and measurement update.

Relative navigation filter (e.g. extended Kalman filter) is 
used to account for the relative position errors resulting from 
all relevant non-modeled accelerations acting on the 
spacecraft. This process employs a numerical integration 
scheme in the filter that is updated at discrete intervals (ti) as 
illustrated in Fig. 3. The estimated relative state vector is 
obtained from an interpolation of the previous cycle. Based 
on all the measurements between ti and ti+1, a continuous 
polynomial representation of the trajectory is made available, 
which serves as starting point for the next filter update and 
relative orbit prediction [5].  Obviously the propagation 
period ti-ti-1 has to be small if better approximations of 
relative state vectors are required. On the other hand, ti-ti-1 is 
limited by the processing time Δtproc. Its typical value is 30 s 
for low earth orbits. While in deep space, this period can be 
extended to several minutes.  
 
Figure 3.  Timeline of relative navigation filter [5] 
The measurements used in the filter are provided by the 
inter-satellite sensor. They can be unambiguous coarse code 
measurements 
or 
ambiguous 
precise 
carrier 
phase 
measurements. Fig. 4 gives their measurement update 
timelines. The biggest difference between these two 
timelines is the extra time for integer ambiguities, which 
should be initialized before using carrier phase to provide 
precise measurements. The method used by PRISMA 
mission is to rotate a spacecraft for solving line-of-sight 
(LOS) ambiguity problem firstly and then distance ambiguity 
afterwards, taking 5 mins and 10 mins, respectively. The 
resolution is combined with tabulated multipath correlation 
through a filtering and smoothing process [6].

B. Flexible operations across all mission phases 
Another important consideration in PFF network is to 
recognize that the relative navigation requirements may 
change during the course of the mission’s operations. Inter-
satellite sensor is expected to operate across various phases 
of formation precision, requiring different levels of position 
sensing and control maneuvering as shown in Fig. 5. A 
connectivity index table (CIT) is proposed to be part of 
traffic exchanged among spacecraft to share the current 
network condition. The measured range can also be filled in 
CIT, in which way a spacecraft can know where the others 
are even though not all of them are directly connected.

Figure 5.  Evolutionary phases of a PFF mission  
In the initial deployment where spacecraft may be 
separated by substantial distances from one to another, the 
resolution of position and orientation data are based perhaps 
on coarse-mode sensors using code measurements only for 
collision avoidance and enabling further movement toward 
the desired configuration. Some spacecraft are possibly out 
of communication range of others as shown in the top of Fig. 
5. As the spacecraft continue to aggregate into the desired 
spatial arrangement, they will eventually discover other 
spacecraft. This condition is defined as formation acquisition 
and depicted in the center of Fig. 5. Finally, when all 
spacecraft are in a “complete connectivity” and settled into 
the desired pattern, formation maintenance is performed as 
shown in the bottom of Fig. 5. A much greater degree of 
positional knowledge is acquired by switching the inter-
satellite sensors into the fine-mode to facilitate science 
operations such as multi-point observation.  
IV. 
NETWORK ARCHITECTURE FOR PFF 
As a result of time-critical demands, networking 
solutions prefer the network nodes in a fixed assignment for 
all possible connections by multiple access (MA) 
technologies TDMA, CDMA, FDMA or their combinations, 
since they enable each spacecraft providing measurements 
from each of the others equally and timely [3]. Before 
discussing network architectures, choices of half-duplex/full-
duplex configurations and centralized/distributed topologies 
need to be considered.

Inevitably, if transmitting and receiving happen at the 
same time, some of the transmitted signal will leak into the 
receiver front ends and may easily saturate the receiver front 
ends or otherwise overwhelm the external signals. Half-
duplex transceiver enables the transmitter and receiver taking 
turns to work, in which way “self-signals” are avoided. Full-
duplex transceiver uses an appropriate filter to isolate the 
transmitter and receiver at their separated frequency bands to 
reject “self-signals”. If the navigation measurements are not 
required simultaneously and continuously, half-duplex 
configuration is adequate and power-saving.  
Network topology is expected to operate in a flexible 
arrangement, so as to account for the evolutionary phases of 
a PFF mission as shown in Fig. 5. Neither solely centralized 
nor distributed topology is efficiently applicable during the 
neighbor discovery and formation acquisition phases, 
because some spacecraft are possibly out of communication 
range of others and could not access to the network. As the 
spacecraft progress towards the desired formation, it is better 
for the topology to evolve to a centralized graph in order to 
enable at least one spacecraft as reference for precise relative 
navigation and formation control. The role of reference can 
rotate from one spacecraft to another to avoid the problem of 
single point of failure.  
Roles rotating at different time slots will give a robust 
and efficient connectivity. It can be implemented in a TDMA 
sequence with a strict timing boundary or a CDMA 
configuration with an adjustable period of time slot. 
Constraints of operating any of them come from the time-
critical navigation requirements. Details will be explained in 
the following parts taking four spacecraft for example.  
A. Half-duplex TDMA 
 
Figure 6.  Half-duplex TDMA 
A half-duplex TDMA architecture is illustrated in Fig. 6. 
It should be noted that the onboard relative navigation filters 
for a certain spacecraft are expected to propagate using 
complete measurements from all of the other spacecraft. In 
TDMA mode, these measurements are given in different 
time slots. Therefore, the time slot is limited by the filter 
propagation period. That is, if a complete duty cycle of one 
TDMA sequence is as long as propagation period ti-ti-1, time 
slot will be one-quarter (1/number of spacecraft) of ti-ti-1, or 
even smaller to compensate for clock drift by reserving a 
time gap between two time slots. During each time slot, the 
roles of spacecraft rotate, thus the signals should be re-
acquired. Signal re-acquisition takes long time and has the 
possibility of exceeding the filter propagation period, 
especially when implementing carrier phase measurement 
and associated integer ambiguity re-initialization.  
Under such circumstances, choosing time slot is in a 
dilemma, unless the time-critical constraint is loosened by 
increasing the propagation period or limiting the re-
acquisition time. It is possible to extend the propagation 
period, or equivalently let the filter freely propagate without 
measurement updates, however, at the expense of an increase 
of the relative navigation error. Otherwise, it is promising to 
shorten initialization time through a rapid integer ambiguity 
resolution instead of maneuvering spacecraft in long time.  
Apart from the time-critical constraint, another limitation 
of TDMA scheme is the need of time synchronization.  
Inevitably, the clock drift makes time unsynchronized on 
different spacecraft. An easy way to reduce its influence on 
TDMA is to reserve a time gap between two time slots in 
order to compensate for clock drift. However, it involves the 
risk that the drift may exceed time gap.

ter capability than TDMA as show in Fig. 7. For a certain 
spacecraft, complete measurements from all of the other 
spacecraft are obtained in the same time slot simultaneously, 
which makes the duration of time slot much more flexible. It 
can be long enough to account for propagation period and re-
acquisition time. The time slot is also adjustable during the 
implementation 
to 
enable 
code 
or 
carrier 
phase 
measurements at different mission phases. In addition, the 
signals transmitted from other spacecraft are not necessary to 
start at the same time, because the duration of a time slot can 
be relatively long and tolerant if one spacecraft is joining in 
or dropping out of the formation. It is applicable if assigning 
different time slots for different spacecraft, which happens 
when a spacecraft needs following long time measurement 
updates to precisely estimate the relative trajectory change 
e.g. in a maneuver operation, while others do not. 
Some limitations of this concept also exist. T
MA structures results in the well-known near-far 
problems when different separation distances between 
spacecraft cause various signal power levels at the receiver. 
CDMA performance will be discussed in the next section. 
C. Full-duplex CDMA  in centralized topology 
As comparison, another candidate architecture
lex CDMA in centralized topology is introduced as 
shown in Fig. 8. Isolation between transmitter and receiver is 
realized by separated frequencies and appropriate filters. The 
measurements can be generated simultaneously and 
continuously, taking the advantage of permitting ranging 
signals passed between spacecraft without the necessity of 
re-acquisition each time at different time slots. Time-critical

requirement is satisfied in an extreme solution that is 
continuous connectivity. Besides, this method brings its 
unique benefit that both clock offset and relative distance can 
be yielded using dual one-way ranging [7].  
However, the flexibility is low because it

en in Table I from 1 to 5 based on the degree of 
importance to balance mission operations and design cost. 
Candidate architectures are scored from 1 to 3 to show their 
capability to satisfy each criterion. The scores for the former 
three criteria are self-explanatory according to the analysis 
indicated above. Regarding power consumption, as a rule of 
thumb, a half-duplex transceiver consumes less power than a 
full-duplex one; the transmitter consumes more power than 
the receiver. Therefore, for a half-duplex TDMA architecture 
which arranges one spacecraft in transmit-mode while the 
others are in receive-mode, power consumption is the lowest. 
Full-duplex CDMA is the most power consuming one. With 
respect to system complexity criterion, TDMA based on 
simple timing logic access strategy is easier to implement 
than 
multi-channel 
PRN-based 
CDMA; 
Half-duplex 
configuration simplifies the system by switching transmitter 
and receiver to reject self-signal instead of using complex 
filters at separated frequencies in full-duplex configuration.  
By calculating the score results for different architectures

suited architecture for PFF missions.

The aforementioned results are based on the assumptions 
that code spectrum has the form of sinc2 and Doppler 
frequency differences are ignored. However, the code is not

much worse than indicated above.  
The presence of cross-correlations is the essential reason 
for MAI. The normalized cross-correlations between pairs of 
Gold codes have three different spurious peaks taking on 
values as the following equations with probabilities of 0.75,

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, network architecture is presented to support 
inter-satellite communication and relative navigation for 
precise formation flying missions. Half-duplex CDMA with 
roles rotating is selected as a suitable architecture, 
enables system
ing with
e range of flex
such as enabling both code and carrier phase measur
wing to detect some spacecraft while tracking others, and 
being insensitive to a spacecraft joining in or dropping out of 
the formation. Its limitation in terms of multiple access 
interference is also highlighted by analyzing signal cross-
correlation performance. It is shown that equivalent energy 
per bit to noise density ratio is reduced due to the near-far 
problem, and the limited length of PRN code makes the 
situation worse at certain Doppler frequency offsets.  
The future work includes an improvement of network 
performance by the following implementations:  
Firstly, signal structure will be updated to reduce cross-
correlation levels and mitigate multiple access interference.  
Secondly, adaptive power control mechanism is useful to 
accommodate a wide range of inter-satellite distan
ll as minimize the impact of near-far problems.  
Thirdly, integer ambiguity problem should
idly, in order to reduce initialization time, and 
consequently reduce its impact on time-critical requirements 
 allow the network in a more flexible manner.
