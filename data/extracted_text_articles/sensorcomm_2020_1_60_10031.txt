IMPAQT Miniaturized Underwater Acoustic Telemetry Platform: 
Transmitter Node System Design 
 
Abstract—The marine environment and its natural resources 
are an essential part of the geographical ecosystem and a great 
food source for humans. In recent years, terrestrial wireless 
sensor networks and Internet of Things (IoT)  technologies have 
developed rapidly; however, due to the limitation of signal 
propagation in water, there is less development and 
advancement in the underwater sensors network domain. 
IMPAQT is a European research project aiming at the 
development of the technologies and methods to promote and 
support inland, coastal zone and offshore Integrated Multi-
Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) sites. As part of the IMPAQT 
project, a novel underwater acoustic telemetry platform has 
been proposed and is under development, to provide a method 
to collect and transmit sensors data underwater. The proposed 
platform architecture consists of several ultrasonic transmitter 
sensor nodes and a gateway buoy as a data aggregator interface. 
Transmitter nodes will collect and log underwater sensor data 
and transmit it at regular intervals to the gateway buoy and the 
gateway buoy will send the collected data to a data management 
system using a Long Range (LoRa) communication link. The 
IMPAQT Transmitter node has an integrated accelerometer 
sensor, a temperature sensor, and a pressure sensor onboard. 
There is also an Infrared Data Association protocol (IrDA) 
interface that can be used to attach any external auxiliary sensor 
module to the transmitter node and configure the transmitter 
node to collect the external module’s data. The current version 
of the transmitter node under development can be attached to 
seaweed, or it can be used as a floating sensor node in the water 
and due to its small size and weight design it almost has no 
impact on the working environment. In this paper, the 
background of the miniaturized underwater sensors is studied, 
and design method of the transmitter node is discussed. Future 
work will focus on the test and deployment of the transmitter 
and gateway in marine deployments.

 INTRODUCTION 
According to the latest United Nations world population 
estimation, by the year 2050, the population of the earth will 
reach approximately 10 billion people [1], and this increase 
will result in higher demand for food and consequently 
seafood as it is one of the main source of food and nutrition 
for many people. In the past, capture fisheries productions 
were the primary source of the seafood, but this has been 
changed in 2012, where aquaculture production volumes 
exceeded that of the capture fisheries, and it is seen to be 
increasing rapidly in recent years to meet demand [2]. To 
provide more sustainability, reduce environmental impacts, 
and promote economic gains, integrated multi-trophic 
aquaculture (IMTA) is gaining popularity among marine 
farmers. In IMTA, farmers combine fed species (e.g., fish, 
shrimp, oysters) with extractive species (e.g., seaweed, 
mussels), and extractive species will use the by-products of 
the fed species, reducing the environmental impact of the 
sites and also to provide commercial profit to the farmers.  
IMPAQT is a European project aimed at promoting and 
supporting the development of IMTA sites by providing a 
multi-purpose, multi-sensing, and multi-functional data 
management platform.  To provide accurate and relevant 
information about the underwater environment, a novel 
miniaturized low-power and low-cost underwater transmitter 
node and a gateway buoy receiver have been proposed and is 
being evaluated to collect information from sensors and 
transmit it to the inland data aggregators. The transmitter 
node has integrated onboard sensors, and it is capable of 
interfacing with external sensor modules using the optical 
IrDA protocol. 
The IMPAQT underwater telemetry platform is an 
ongoing project, and currently, various design parameters 
and solutions are under evaluation and development. 
In section II, the current state of the related research 
projects studied. Section III describes the development of the 
transmitter node circuit, design parameters and, also power 
analysis of the circuit. Section IV addresses the current state 
of the project and plans for improvements.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
With the rapidly increasing and evolving aquaculture 
market sector, it is essential to monitor and analyze the effects 
of the methods that have been used in aquaculture, to reduce 
the costs and improve stability and sustainability of the sites. 
There is experimental monitoring in the labs and tanks. 
However, due to the differences between the experimental 
environment and real aquaculture environments, it is hard to 
compare accurately, especially when it comes to the biasing

caused by the handling of marine animals [3]. In [4], authors 
proposed the concept of Precision Fish Farming intending to 
use scientific methods to manage the fish production by 
enabling farmers to monitor, control and document the 
biological process in fish farms. With the advancement of 
chemistry and electrical sensing technologies, it is now 
possible to develop miniaturized attached sensor devices to 
track and study the natural behaviour of marine animals and 
plants in their cultural environment. 
To achieve the goal mentioned earlier, in [5], authors 
describe the development of an ultra-low-power sensor 
device, AE-FishBIT, for monitoring physical activities and 
respiratory frequency of the farmed fish, using the onboard 
accelerometer sensor, attached to the fish, and logging the 
sensors’ information. AE-FishBIT is not able to transmit the 
data, and the fish is required to be captured to download the 
sensors data, however, due to its form factor and size, it is 
easy to attach and detach the device to the operculum of the 
fish. Almeida et al. [6] monitored the behaviour of Lusitanian 
toadfish using accelerometry data provided by the externally 
attached AccelTag, which was able to log, recognize and 
transmit behaviour type of the fish.  
There are also devices for tracking the movement of the 
fish in dams, fisheries, and cages, shown in Figure 1. In [7], 
authors have developed the Juvenile Salmon Acoustic 
Telemetry System (JSATS), to identify and track the 
movement of juvenile salmon in dams and rivers. JSATS tags 
are extremely compact, with a length of 15mm and a diameter 
of 3.38mm, which allows them to be injected using a needle 
into the body of the fish. They can transmit ultrasonic pings 
for a year with a 15-second ping interval. But JSATS tags are 
only capable of transmitting a pre-programmed unique 
identification code and temperature data, and they are not 
able to provide any other sensor data. 
Another method to monitor the marine environment is to 
use unmanned underwater vehicles. SeaSmart has introduced 
three patented wireless drones to collect environmental data, 
for instance, oxygen, salinity, biomass, and temperature, by 
travelling through the cage to collect data and returning to 
surface to transmit the collected information. [8]. 
There are also efforts on monitoring IMTA and 
aquaculture sites using remote sensing technologies, in [9], 
authors have used multi-sensor (satellite, unmanned aerial 
vehicle, and ground  spectroradiometer) remote sensing 
techniques to monitor seaweed aquaculture in the Yellow 
Sea.  
III. 
MATERIALS AND METHOD 
The focus of IMPAQT telemetry project is on IMTA 
sites, where all sensors will be deployed in a bounded area, 
and it is considered that the gateway buoy will be in a 
maximum distance of 100m from each sensor tag. 
In Figure 2, the IMPAQT telemetry system is shown, 
and in this paper, the design method of the transmitter node 
will be discussed. The goal of the transmitter is to transmit 
sensors data provided by its internal sensors or externally 
connected sensor to the gateway buoy using acoustic waves. 
The IMPAQT transmitter node needs to be miniaturized to 
minimize its impact on the deployment environment. 
Considering the size and power consumption of the tag, 
accordingly, the block diagram design in Figure 3, and 
associated system design is suggested. Regarding the receiver 
aspect of the transceiver system, the buoy mounted gateway 
board is an application specific system designed in 
conjunction with the transmitter board described in detail in 
this publication. It is anticipated that the full transceiver 
system (gateway and transmitter) and its deployment will be 
described in full in a follow on publication. 
A. Transducer material selection 
PZT materials are one of the most widely used 
piezoelectric materials, and they have been used in different 
applications, in particular as fish tags [6][7][10]. In [11], four 
types of PZT materials’ (Customized Type VI, Type VI, Type 
I and Type II) energy consumption, source-level, and 
frequency response has been compared. From the energy 
consumption aspect, PZT Type VI consume more energy 
comparing to other types, but they also provide better source 
level and frequency response compared to others. By 
comparing the results, type VI had a good balance between 
the source level and power consumption; consequently, for 
designing the JSATS tags, they have used PZT Type VI 
material.

For IMPAQT transmitter tags, a PZT type VI 
(SMC3H3F380) from STEMiNC Inc, with an outer diameter 
of 3mm and height of 3mm, with the resonance frequency of 
380 KHz ± 15KHz has been selected.  
B.  Transducer driver 
To estimate the required driving voltage for the piezo 
transducer to provide sufficient detection range, it is 
necessary to study underwater acoustic models and signal 
absorption loss. The sound emitted by the piezo transducers 
is attenuated by two main factors, viscous absorption factor, 
and chemical relaxation effect. The selected piezo material 
resonance frequency is at 380KHz, and at this frequency, 
viscous absorption and magnesium sulphate relaxation effect 
is significant, which can be estimated by the following 
simplified formula [12] :

environment, f=380KHz (Piezo resonance frequency), T =

working depth), and relevant relaxation frequencies are:

Using (1) by substituting the parameters, the absorption 
loss of 92.4 dB per kilometer has been estimated for an 
infinitely narrow acoustic beam, however, practical beams 
spread as they propagate through the water, in order to 
mitigate the spreading loss, (4) can be used for the 
transmission loss at the distance of R [14]: 
 
 
𝑇𝐿 = 𝑇𝐿1 +  𝛼𝑅,  
(4) 
 
 
𝑇𝐿1 = 20logR ,  
(5) 
In the IMPAQT project, a maximum distance of 100m 
is considered between the transmitter and receiver nodes, 
which leads to an overall transmission loss of 49.2 dB at 
100m.  
To provide an adequate sound level, a voltage booster 
circuit has been implemented using TPS61040 controller, 
which can boost the 2.5-3.7v (LiPo cell voltage) up to 28v. 
 The average current of the piezo transducer can be 
estimated by (6) [15] : 
 
𝐼𝐴𝑣𝑔 =
2𝑄
𝑇 = 2𝐶𝑉𝑓 
 (6) 
Where Q = Charge in the piezoelectric transducer, 
T=Period of the driving signal, C= 70pF (Static capacitance), 
V = 20v (Driving voltage), F = 380KHz (Resonance 
frequency). Using the parameters of the selected piezo 
material, the average current would be about 1mA. 
 The tag’s sound level can be programmed using the 
IrDA interface based on the use case.  ADG1438 analog 
switch IC has been used to drive the piezo terminals at the 
boosted voltage using PWM modulation provided by the 
microcontroller. 
C. Sensors and external interface 
 An accelerometer sensor (LIS3DH), and a pressure and 
temperature sensor (MS5837-30BA) are included in the 
IMPAQT transmitter tag to monitor the aquaculture 
environment and tag movement. TFBS4650 is also selected 
as the external sensors interface, where auxiliary sensor 
boards and modules can communicate with the transmitter 
tag to transmit their sensor value to the gateway buoy, at real-
time or at predefined intervals. External sensor modules can 
also trigger the tag’s microcontroller to wake up and read the 
external sensors data using the low-power infrared wake-up 
circuit. The evaluation boards and IrDA transceiver have 
been shown in Figure 4. 
D. Power consumption and battery management 
The transmitter tag runs on a 260mAh LiPo battery 
(Part number:LP551246). There is a compact battery charger 
and a battery supervisor circuit on the board, to charge and 
cut off the battery in the case of full discharge.   
Considering the 260mA battery, total sleep current of 
6.34uA (refer to Table I which is based on data available on 
individual product datasheets), the maximum current of about

5.3 mA when sampling all sensors, and about 1.6mA while 
transmitting the data, based on user configuration the battery 
life can last from two weeks to three months. 
To maximize the battery life, the tag can be 
programmed via IrDA interface to wake up and read the 
sensors data at regular intervals, while also an external sensor 
or module can force the tag to wake-up using the wake-up 
circuit.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The proposed telemetry method, using a transmitter and 
a gateway buoy can help farmers and researchers to monitor 
and analyze underwater water environment. The proposed 
transmitter tag incorporates an accelerometer, a temperature 
sensor and a pressure sensor. However, the main novelty of 
this work is its size and that it is designed to be attachable to 
other sensors and modules. This project is a work in progress, 
and it is considered to improve aquaculture sites monitoring 
as a part of IMPAQT project, which is ongoing. 
Currently, the transceiver system prototype boards, 
shown in Figure 4, have been developed and evaluated in air 
and 200 bit per second achieved using binary phase-shift 
keying and On-Off keying modulations at 40KHz frequency. 
It is expected that by using 380KHz piezo materials, the 
bitrate will increase significantly, which will reduce the 
overall battery consumption and lead to more frequent data 
capturing and transmitting. Based on the components that 
have been selected, it is estimated that the final dimension of 
the tag would be less than 5 cm x 2 cm x 2 cm. This system 
will be tested in an aquatic environment and reported on in a 
subsequent publication. 
In future, more studies can be done on the optimization 
of the battery consumption, bitrate improvement and more 
miniaturized design. Also, there would be an opportunity to 
connect the tag to the sensors developed by other colleagues 
in IMPAQT project to provide a better understanding of 
underwater environments.
