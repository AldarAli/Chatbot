Abstract—The positions of German parties on 36 policy
issues are compared with the results of public opinion polls,
and the parties’ indices of popularity (the average percentage
of the population represented) and universality (frequency in
representing a majority) are constructed. The 2013 federal
election winner, the CDU/CSU, is shown to be the least
representative among the 28 paries considered. The most
representative among the four parties in the Bundestag (with
>5% of the votes) is DIE LINKE, which received only 8.6%
of the votes. It is concluded that voters are inconsistent with
their own political proﬁles, disregard party manifestos, and
are likely driven by political traditions, even if outdated, or by
personal images of politicians.
Keywords-Mathematical theory of democracy; German par-
ties; Bundestag election 2013; indices of representativeness.
I. INTRODUCTION
Table I shows the four German paries which, having
received > 5% of the votes in the 2013 federal election, are
eligible for the Bundestag seats. The goal of the paper is
estimating the representativeness of these and other German
parties participating in the 2013 Bundestag election from
the viewpoint of direct democracy. For this purpose, we
compare the parties’ positions on topical policy issues with
the outcomes of public opinion polls and construct the
parties’ indices of popularity (the average percentage of the
population represented) and universality (frequency in rep-
resenting a majority), according the methodology described
in [5].
The party positions are taken from the Wahl-O-Mat —
an internet site of the Bundeszentrale f¨ur politische Bildung
(German Federal Agency for Civic Education) [2]. Recall
that the Wahl-O-Mat (an invented word composed from
the German Wahl = election and Automat) is the German
version of the Dutch Internet site StemWijzer (‘VoteMatch’)
[3], which was originally developed in the 1990s to involve
young people in political participation. Both websites help
the users locate themselves on the political landscape by
testing how well their opinions ﬁt with party positions. Be-
fore an election (local, regional, federal, and even European),
a special governmental supervising committee compiles a
list of questions on topical policy issues (‘Introduce mini-
mum wage?’—Yes/No, ‘Introduce a general speed limit on
motorways?’—Yes/No, etc.) and asks the parties participat-
ing in the election for their answers. A user of the site

Source: [1], [2]
answers the same questions, eventually attributing weights
to reﬂect their importance, and then the program compares
his or her political proﬁle with that of the parties and ﬁnds
the best-ﬁtting party, the next best-ﬁtting party, etc. No
statistical data are available form the Wahl-O-Mat, and if any
were available, they would be biased toward internet users.
Therefore, by any reason, the balance of public opinion is
better reﬂected by relevant public opinion polls.
For the given model, we consider the Wahl-O-Mat an-
swers of 28 German parties participating in the 2013 Bun-
destag election and the results of 36 public opinion polls
relevant to 36 out of 38 Wahl-O-Mat questions. The full
information on the party answers with their comments on
them as well as on the public opinion polls with all the
references is given in the report [4].

Public opinion and representation thereof by the 2013 Bundestag and the DGB
‘1’ is as in the ‘ofﬁcial’ Wahl-O-Mat questionnaire ﬁlled by
the parties shortly before the Bundestag elections 2013.
The small red rectangle above the blue bar shows the
Yes/No position of the DGB, which does not participate in
the election but nevertheless has a position on the issue.
The balance of public opinion 86% : 12% on the issue
is shown by the blue bar whose length is normalized to
100% (abstaining respondents are ignored). The size of the
bar to the left side and to the right side of the central axis
correspond to the percentage of antagonists and protagonists
in the society, respectively. The blue bar’s bias from the
center indicates at the prevailing public opinion.
A Bundestag faction is depicted by a rectangle with the
‘ofﬁcial’ party color. Its length is proportional to the number
of the party seats in the Bundestag. The ‘No/Yes’ party
opinion on the question is reﬂected by the location of the
rectangle to the left side or to the right side from the central
vertical axis, respectively. A Bundestag majority is attained
if the cumulative length of party rectangles surpasses the
50%-threshold (marked with dotted lines).
If the position of DGB, public, or party is unknown, the
corresponding rectangle is missing.

Let us show how these data are used to construct the party
indices of representativeness. For every question, a given
party represents a certain fraction of the population (iden-
tiﬁed with the fraction in the opinion polls). For instance,
the CDU/CSU with their ‘No’ answer to the ﬁrst question
‘1 Introduce nation wide minimum wage’ represents the
opinion of 12% of the population versus 86%. After removal
of abstaining respondents and normalization, we obtain the
CDU/CSU representativeness for Question 1:
rCDU/CSU,1 =
12
12 + 86 × 100% ≈ 12.2% .
Similarly, with the ‘Yes’ answer to the next question ‘2
The parents of children who do not attend day care should
receive a childcare subsidy’, the CDU/CSU expresses the
opinion of 20% of the population versus 77%. After removal
of abstaining respondents and normalization we obtain the
CDU/CSU representativeness for Question 2:
rCDU/CSU,2 =
20
20 + 77 × 100% ≈ 20.6% ,
and so on. Taking the average representativeness of the
CDU/CSU over the questions with known results of public
opinion polls and deﬁnitive party responses (there are 36
such questions), we obtain the party’s unweighted popularity
index
PCDU/CSU = 12.2 + 20.6 + · · ·
32
× 100% ≈ 40% .
A higher popularity means that, on average, a larger fraction
of the electorate is represented. Taking the average with the
weights, we obtain weighted versions of popularity. (For
every party, the questions with missing opinion polls or party
positions are removed from consideration, and the question
weights are proportionally adjusted to the total of 100%.)
The frequency in representing a majority (≥ 50%) is
deﬁned to be the unweighted universality of the party. The
CDU/CSU represents a (non-strict) majority on 11 out of 32
questions that are backed up by public opinion polls and the
CDU/CSU positions. Hence, the frequency in representing
a majority is
UCDU/CSU = 11
32 × 100% ≈ 34% .
A higher universality means that a majority is represented
more frequently. If the questions are counted with weights,
we obtain the weighted versions of the universality index.
Figure 2 displays the indices of popularity P and univer-
sality U for 28 German parties parties, DGB and Bundestag
in four versions each: unweighted questions (marked in the
subsequent charts by ‘u’), weighted by the logarithm with
base 2 of the number of Google hits for the questions’
keywords (marked by ‘g’), assuming that the number of
relevant documents in the Internet reﬂects the importance of
the question, and weighted by two experts — the director
of the Institute for Economic and Social Research in the
Hans-B¨ockler-Foundation, Professor Brigitte Unger, and the
editor-in-chef of the DGB info-service Einblick, Anne Graef
(marked by ‘b’ and ‘a’, respectively). The parties are sorted
in the decreasing order of the mean of all the eight indices.
The correlations between the party ranks with respect to the
indices (rank correlations) are shown in Table II.
III. CONCLUSIONS
Inconsistency of election results with public opinion:
As one can see, the winner of the 2013 Bundestag election,
the conservative party CDU/CSU with 41.6% of the votes,
has the lowest ranking among all the 28 parties considered.
Correspondingly, it also ranks lowest among the four eligible
parties. The most representative among the eligible parties
is DIE LINKE, which received only 8.6% of the votes. The
negative correlations between the party ranks with respect to
the votes received and the indices of representativeness show
that most electors vote inconsistently with their own political
proﬁles. A possible explanation of this inconsistency is
the signiﬁcant shift of the German (and world) political
spectrum to the right after the 1990 German reuniﬁcation
and collapse of communism, although voters still believe
that the parties represent the same values as a few decades
ago.
Weak dependence between public opinion and the Bun-
destag position: Note that the Bundestag’s representative
capacity is estimated at about 50%. It should be realized
that 50% of representativeness is expected when, for every
issue, a coin is tossed whose sides indicate the decisions in

Indices of German parties and the DGB: P—popularity, U—universality, u—for unweighted questions, g—for questions weighted by the number
of Google hits, b—for questions weighted by Brigitte Unger as the ﬁrst expert, and a—for questions weighted by Anne Graef as the second expert
favor of either the majority or the minority in the society.
Therefore, the index values of about 50% can be interpreted
as the lack of dependence between public opinion and the
Bundestag position.
Warning for policymakers: All of these constitute a
serious warning against the use of traditional voting methods
for selecting representatives of public opinion. Among other
things, ‘wrong voting’ gives faulty feedback to policymakers
about the policies they pursue. Already now, both extreme
right and extreme left parties rank much higher than the
moderate parties currently elected to the Bundestag. How-
ever, this cannot last forever, and if the discrepancy between
the population and the government becomes critical, an
extremist government can be elected.
Secondary role of weighting:
In Table II, all the
rank correlations between the indices of representativeness
are very close to one. Even the correlation between the
unweighted and the Google-weighted indices — with the
extremes in weight ranging from 42,900 (for Question 9
about separate school lessons for children with different
cultural background) to 31,600,000 (for Question 31 about
merging statutory and private health insurances) — is 0.99 or
0.98. This means that the party ranks are not very sensitive
to the question weighting.

(continued) Indices of German parties and the DGB: P—popularity, U—universality, u—for unweighted questions, g—for questions weighted
by the number of Google hits, b—for questions weighted by Brigitte Unger as the ﬁrst expert, and a—for questions weighted by Anne Graef as the second
expert
The similarity in index orders can be explained as follows.
The responses of a given party are backed up by the party
‘ideology’, which determines the high intra-question corre-
lations of party answers. Therefore, ‘erroneous’ weighting
and even omission of some questions play a rather negligible
role, because other questions carry superﬂuous information
on the party political proﬁle. Hence, we can evaluate the
parties by the mean of its eight indices as done in Figure 2,
or by the most ‘impartial’ unweighted indices.
Evaluation of representatives without election: The
known DGB position on the given policy issues allows
us to evaluate its popularity and universality, although the
DGB does not participate in elections. In the same way, the
representativeness of any political body can be evaluated
without elections, just by comparing its position with the
results of public opinion polls.
IV. DISCUSSION: HOW TO IMPROVE ELECTION
The approach developed in this paper prompts a way to
improve the election procedure. The aim is (a) to redirect
the voters’ attention from candidate (party) images to their
manifestos as political proﬁles, and (b) to base the election

of candidates on matching their proﬁles to the majority will.
Currently the Bundestag is elected with two votes, the ﬁrst
(Erststimme) for a person and the second (Zweitstimme) for a
party. The ﬁrst 299 Bundestag members are representatives
of local constituencies elected through the ﬁrst vote. The
next 299 Bundestag seats are distributed among the eligible
parties (who have at least 5% of the second votes) to form
their factions, including the party members. Thus, the second
vote is decisive because it determines the size of Bundestag
factions already elected by the ﬁrst vote, in proportion to the
second votes. Thereby, the partiality of the vote for a person
is reduced by rearranging the Bundestag factions according
to the more impersonal second vote for a party.
This logic of increasing impartiality of votes can be
continued by introducing the absolutely impartial third vote
(Drittstimme) asking for the elector’s political proﬁle. It is
imagined in the form of a survey on selected points of
the party manifestos (Introduce nationwide minimum wage?
Yes/No; etc.). As explained previously, the political proﬁles
of the candidates (parties) are backed up by certain ide-
ologies, making the answers to different questions strongly
interdependent. Therefore, a few questions sufﬁce to specify
the political proﬁles of both candidates and voters.
In other words, we propose to combine elections with
referenda revealing the public opinion on a sample of issues.
The suggested approach envisages processing the totality of
the ballots and evaluating candidates with respect to the ﬁt
of their manifestos to the public proﬁle. It should be noted
that in Switzerland, Canada and United States, referenda
are often coupled with elections, however, not as criteria
to distribute parliament seats or public ofﬁces but rather for
the convenience of the population.
Of course, a practical implementation should not exclude
traditional ways of expressing opinions. In addition to ques-
tionnaires in the ballots, direct votes for a candidate and for
a party should remain an option. Note that such a voting
duality is already inherent in the German parliamentary
election system with the ﬁrst vote for a speciﬁc person, and
the second vote for a party. In our consideration, the vote
for a party is complemented with a vote for an even more
impersonal party manifesto. Of course, one can also imagine
a mixed procedure where the allocation of the Bundestag
seats is derived from both the second votes and the party
indices obtained through the third votes.
