Abstract—Due to the fluctuation and complexity of the stock 
market, it is challenging to capture its non-stationary property 
and describe its moving tendency. Moreover, globalization 
increases the interdependence among countries. It is important 
for investors to understand the co-movement of international 
stock markets in order to make informed decisions which lead 
to profit. With the huge amount of data generated by the stock 
markets, researchers started to explore this problem using 
different approaches. In this paper, we apply one of the data 
mining techniques, namely, association rules, to illustrate 
knowledge patterns and rules of European stock markets. 
Especially, this paper investigates the co-movement of the 
European stock market indices with the leading global stock 
indices. This study shows a strong co-movement between stock 
market indices of Germany and Unitied Kingdom. Moreover, 
the European stock markets seem to have strong co-movement 
with the US stock market. Their co-movement with the Brazil 
seems to be also strong. However, Brazil stock index does not 
assume the dominant role, as the US stock index does.  This 
study also shows that there is a weak relationship between 
European and Japanese stock markets.

 INTRODUCTION  
 
International stock market linkages are of great 
importance for financial decisions of international investors. 
International diversification reduces total risk of a portfolio. 
Increase co-movement between asset returns can diminish 
the advantage of internationally diversified investment 
portfolios [18]. Changes in co-movement patterns call for an 
adjustment of portfolios [26]. 
Forecasting stock index is a challenging task due to its 
dynamic and complex nature. Forecasting stock index plays 
an important role in developing effective market trading 
strategies [14]. Stock markets can be influenced by various 
factors such as the international environment, government 
policies, political climate, economic growth, war, and natural 
disasters.  Among these factors, some of them have long-
term effect on the markets while others have only short–term 
effect [28]. Recently, globalization adds more complexity to 
the movement of stock markets. Globalization in finance and 
trade increases the interdependence among countries. Such 
relationships further cause the co-movement of the financial 
markets between countries. Studies have confirmed that most 
of the world’s stock markets are integrated and associated 
[22]. Loh [19] claims that understanding the dynamic co-
movement between global financial markets plays an 
important role in predicting stock market returns, allocating 
assets and diversifying portfolios.  
This paper extends the existing literature on stock market 
co-movement between the European stock markets with that 
of the US, Brazil, and the Japan. The major European 
markets include UK, Germany, and Turkey stock markets. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, 
we give the literature review. Section 3 presents data and 
research technique. Section 4 presents research findings and 
discussions. Section 5 concludes the paper. 
II. 
 LITERATURE REVIEW 
The dynamic interdependence and market integration 
among major stock exchanges have been investigated by 
various studies using vector autoregression (VAR) and 
autoregressive conditional heterosedastic (ARCH) models. 
Vuran [27] found that the ISE100 index is co-integrated 
with stock markets of the United Kingdom (FTSE), Brazil 
(BOVESPA), 
and 
Germany 
(DAX). 
Floros 
[9] 
demonstrated the linkages and co-integration among mature 
stock indices (such as S&P 500, Nikkei225 and FTSE-100) 
using a vector error correction model and the Granger-
causality approach. Ozdemir and Cakan [23] claimed that 
there 
is 
a 
strong 
bidirectional 
nonlinear 
causality 
relationship between the US stock index and the stock 
market indices of the Japan, France and the UK using non-
linear causality tests. Some studies have demonstrated that 
the U.S stock market has a dominant impact on emerging 
markets [20] and some developed stock markets such as 
Japan and France [23]. These studies demonstrated the 
dynamic causal linkages among international stock market 
indices. 
Contrary to these findings, Chan, Gup and Pan [6] 
concluded that stock markets are not co-integrated, by 
analyzing 18 stock market indices. Pascual [24] also found 
that there is no co-integration relationship between the 
French, German, and UK stock markets, by using quarterly 
data.  Zhu et al. [30] rejected co-integration relationships 
between market returns in Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong 
Kong.  Dimpfl [8] further proved that international financial

markets are not co-integrated in the Engle and Granger [31] 
sense. In response to such a dilemma, data mining 
techniques have been introduced to investigate the co-
movement between stock markets. Aghabozorgi and The [1] 
studied stock market co-movement using the three-phase 
clustering method.  Liao and Chou [15] investigated the co-
movement of the stock markets of Taiwan and Hong Kong 
using clustering methods and association rules. Association 
rules learning discovers interesting correlation patterns 
among data items in a large dataset by revealing attribute 
value conditions that co-occur frequently [29]. It aims at 
uncovering relationship between items that occur together in 
database. The association rules generated through mining 
represent an important class of regularities that exist in 
databases. Nowadays, stock markets across the world have 
some kinds of connection with each other. In addition, these 
markets generate huge amount of financial data each day. 
Thus, mining association rules becomes important since it 
can provide insights to investors and policy makers to make 
informed decision. 
Since the introduction of the Euro, the European stock 
markets have become more integrated with the German stock 
market taking the leadership role [21]. Investing in European 
stock markets has grown since the European stock markets 
are one of the most attractive destinations of international 
funds. The European markets have assumed the leadership 
role that the US and Japanese markets experienced in the 
past [3]. Many studies have investigated linkages between 
European and US markets or among European markets. The 
majority of the studies focus on the co-movement among 
developed stock markets [3][ 21][25]. There are few studies 
examining the co-movement between developed and 
emerging markets [20][27]. Berger et al. [5] claimed that 
emerging 
markets 
provide 
significant 
diversification 
potential to investors due to the low integration of these 
markets with the developed markets worldwide. Therefore, it 
is important to understand and estimate the co-movement of 
the emerging markets and the developed markets. Empirical 
evidence concerning the dynamics of the co-movement of 
the European markets (including European emerging 
markets) with the US, Latin America and Japanese stock 
market is limited.  This study intends to fill this gap by 
investigating the co-movement of the European stock 
markets within the region and its co-movement with the 
major global stock markets, such as the USA and Japanese 
markets.

 Among the indices, the MSCI Europe Index captures 
large and mid-cap representation across 15 developed market 
countries in Europe, while the MSCI Emerging Markets 
index captures large and mi-cap representation across 21 
emerging markets countries. The entire data set covers the 
period from January 5, 2009 to February 22, 2011.  Missing 
values were replaced by the previous day’s value. 
B. Data Mining Techniques 
With the development of information technology and 
software, large amounts of data on stocks traded by the hour 
and the minute can be easily collected.  Therefore, extracting 
useful information from the huge amount of stock market 
data becomes critical to investment in stock markets. Data 
mining techniques have attracted more attention from 
investors interested in discovering patterns and predicting 
changes of the stock markets. For instance, Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) [11][12][13] and Neural Networks [4][7] 
[12][17] have been used to improve the predictability of 
stock prices. Recently, mining association rules [1] from 
large data repositories have attracted considerable attention 
in various areas including financial domain.  Association rule 
mining was originally used in marketing to discover 
association rules about which groups of products are likely to 
be purchased together. The goal of association rule analysis 
is to discover interesting association and correlation 
relationships among large sets of data items. Although there 
are many applications of association rules in the field of data 
mining problems, it is not common to estimate the co-
movement of the stock markets using association rules. In 
the literature, only a few studies have utilized the association 
rules to study the behavior of stock markets. Liao, Ho, and 
Lin [16] implemented association rules learning on the 
Taiwan stock market to discover knowledge patterns and 
stock category association to aid portfolio investments. Na 
and Sohn [22] predicted the movement direction of the 
Korea Composite Stock Price Index using association rules. 
 The problem of mining association rules was first 
introduced by Agrawal et al. [2]. The association rule is 
defined as follows: Let I ={i1, i2, ….., id ) be the item set 
55

DATA ANALYTICS 2014 : The Third International Conference on Data Analytics

and  D={ t1, t2, …..t N) be the set of all transactions. A 
transaction tj is said to contain an item set X if X is a subset 
of tj.  An association rule is an implication expression of the 
form X->Y, where X and Y are disjoint item sets. The 
association rule means that the item set Y is likely to occur 
whenever the item set X occurs. The strength of an 
association rule can be measured in terms of support and 
confidence, which indicate the usefulness and certainty of a 
rule, respectively [10]. Support is denoted as Sup(X, D), 
which represents the percentage of transaction D that 
contains the item set X. The higher the support value, the 
more important the transaction set D is.  Accordingly, the 
support for the rule X->Y is denoted as Sup( XUY, D), 
which represents the percentage of transactions in D 
containing both X and Y item sets. The other measure of 
rule X->Y, called confidence and denoted as Conf(X->Y), 
which can be expressed in terms of support such that Conf 
(X->Y) = Sup (X∩Y)/Sup(X, D). It represents the 
percentage of transactions in D that contain X and also 
contain Y. In other words, confidence is an estimate of the 
conditional probability P (Y|X). For the rules with the same 
confidence level, the rule with the highest support is 
preferred. However, both measures may not be sufficient to 
assess the descriptive power of a rule. For example, rules 
with high confidence may happen by chance. Therefore, the 
measure lift is used to assess the reliability of support and 
confidence, it is defined as: Lift=Conf(X->Y)/Sup(Y) [15]. 
If the lift value is close to 1, it implies that X and Y are 
independent and the rule is not useful. If the lift value is 
higher than 1, it indicates that the occurrence of X provides 
information about Y. 
 
The goal of association rules discovery is to generate all 
transaction rules that have a certain level of minimum 
support and confidence. To obtain a small set of useful 
association rules from this dataset, we conducted association 
rule analysis using SAS enterprise miner 12.1[33]. The 
algorithm used to conduct association analysis is ASSOC 
procedure implemented in SAS data miner [33]. We also set 
the minimum support value at 10%, and the minimum 
confidence value at 70%, which were used in previous 
studies [16][22]. The maximum number of items in an 
association is set to 2 and 3.

RESULTS 
The extracted association rules ordered by confidence 
have been summarized in Table 2 and Table 3.

A. Association Rules 
According to Table 2, Rule 1 and Rule 4 indicate that the 
Brazil stock index has the highest confidence (100%) and 
high support with MSCI Europe Index. This reveals that 
BOVESPA is highly correlated with EU. That is, both 
indices will have the same trend of variation.  Rule 2 and 
Rule 3 also show strong association between EU and SP. 
That is, US stock market may still play a dominant role in 
affecting European stock markets especially when the 
downward trend is present. Within Europe, the major stock 
index DAX is the driving force to other stock indices within 
the region according to Rule 7 and Rule 8. However, there 
seems to be an inverse relationship between NIKKEI and 
BOVESPA based on Rule 10. In addition, the lift values for 
all the rules listed in Table 2 are above 1, which implies that 
these rules are useful. 
 
Table 3 shows association rules among three stock 
indices. Rule 1 and Rule 3 demonstrate that DAX and FTS 
are highly correlated with EU, since EU represents the 
developed markets in Europe.  According to Rule 5 and 
Rule 6, when ISE and DAX are up, EU is up. However, 
when ISE and DAX are down, EU is also down. As to the 
global markets, SP still has a strong influence over 
European stock markets, as shown in Rule 7 and Rule 9.

B. Link Maps 
In this study, we also conducted link analysis, which 
aims at highlighting the linkages between items of interest. 
The graph link shows the nodes of items within the dataset 
that are connected to each other. A link presents a 
connection between two items in a rule. The size of the node 
is determined by the transaction count, while the weight of 
the link is related to the confidence of the rule. The higher 
the confidence is, the thicker the link between nodes. The 
link graphs are given in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The link 
graphs are meaningful and interesting. More importantly, it 
is easy for investors and traders to identify the patterns of 
movement of these stock indices.  Figure 1 shows a strong 
co-movement among DAX, FTS, EU, SP, and BOVESPA. 
That is, when these stock indices are rising, they also drive 
other stock indices (such emerging stock indices) to go up. 
On the other hand, when these stock indices are down, other 
stock indices also go down. Therefore, these stocks may be 
considered as the driving force to the others to move up or 
move down. 
Figure 2 shows that when DAX, FTS and EU indices are 
down, all other markets tend to be down. The thick links 
originated from the nodes of these three indices represent 
that these indices have strong co-movements with other 
European stock indices and with the global stock indices, 
such as SP, NIKKEI, and BOVESPA.

CONCLUSION  AND FUTURE WORK 
In conclusion, we found several interesting associations 
between European and leading global stock markets. The 
findings show strong co-movements among European stock 
indices. The European stock markets seem to have strong 
co-movement with the US stock market as well. More 
interestingly, European stock indices also have strong 
associations with the Brazil index. However, The Brazil 
stock index does not assume the dominant role as the US 
stock index does. This study shows that association rules 
seem to be an appropriate technique for effective 
exploration of underlying patterns in huge amount of stock 
market data. We expect that association rules can be used to 
provide information that can facilitate decision making with 
regard to predicting stock market returns, allocating assets 
and diversifying portfolios. However, the results of 
association analysis need to be interpreted with caution 
since an association rule does not necessarily imply 
causality.
