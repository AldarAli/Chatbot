Abstract—Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
systems are quite prominent for use in industrial, utility, and
facility-based processes. While such technology continues to
evolve in the context of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and
new paradigms such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) arise, the
threat of such systems remains relatively obscure, especially
from the operational cyber security perspective. Various obstacles
hinder the cyber security analysis of such systems, including
the lack of (malicious) empirical data in addition to numerous
logistic, privacy and reputation concerns. In this paper, we draw
upon large-scale empirical data that was uniquely captured and
analyzed from a recently deployed, Internet-scale CPS-speciﬁc
honeynet. The aim is to shed light on misdemeanors and malicious
activities targeting such CPS honeypots for threat inference,
characterization and attribution. In addition, this aims at (1)
collecting rare empirical data targeting such systems for further
forensic investigations and sharing with the research community
and (2) contributing to generating CPS-tailored empirical attack
models to aid in effective CPS resiliency. The results identify and
attribute the top sources of such suspicious and unauthorized
SCADA activities and highlight a number of targeted threats.
Furthermore, we uncover undocumented abuse against CPS
services operating in building automation systems as well as
factory environments.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet today continues to experience constant attacks
targeting Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Such systems are
deﬁned by the National Institute of Standard and Technology
(NIST) [1] as a set of inter-connected and distributed physical
processes which control and monitor industrial control sectors
such as utilities (i.e., electric, water, oil, natural gas), trans-
portation, and building automation systems.
Several factors are affecting CPS security. First, in an ideal
situation, the isolation of a CPS network from the external
unsecured network (e.g., Internet) is a common practice.
However, this is not the case, as there is a necessity to access
such systems remotely using external devices. Second, support,
consultants and vendors who connect their devices to the CPS
network for various purposes create potential CPS security
risks [2]. Third, replacing original parts in the CPS network
with low-quality equipment to reduce the cost has recently
triggered critical security against CPS systems by generating
a plethora of 0-day vulnerabilities [3] [4]. Last but not least,
the modernization of smart cities, inter-connected devices and
IoT will obviously scale the threat vector against SCADA
systems. According to the Industrial Control System Computer
Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) [5], the assessment
teams have identiﬁed hundreds of vulnerabilities within CPS
architectural design. The rise of attacks on CPS compared to
2016 was attributed to the widespread adoption of the IoT
technology.
Given the scarcity of CPS-speciﬁc tailored cyber threat in-
telligence, the contributions of this paper could be summarized
as follows:
•
deploying distributed SCADA monitors (i.e., honey-
pots) in various countries,
•
analyzing and characterizing one month of unsolicited
and suspicious SCADA communications, and
•
measuring and validating the severity impact of such
SCADA activities.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II provides an overview of the related work. Section III
presents the approach used to proﬁle CPS cyber activities.
Section IV elaborates the derived results based on the analyzed
one-month period of SCADA data. Section V puts forward a
few limitation points and its limitation. Finally, Section VI
summaries and concludes this paper.

RELATED WORK
The literature review could be divided into mainly two
parts, namely, probing analysis and CPS analysis.
A. Probing Analysis
Since probing activities is an important topic in cyber
security and Internet measurements, it has been the focus of
attention in many contributions. In [6], the authors provided an
extensive survey in which they categorize the scanning topics
based on their nature, strategy, and approach. Leonard et al.
[7] performed stochastic derivation of a number of relations
in order to propose an optimal stealth distribution scanning
activity based on the probability of detection. The authors
undertook the attackers’ perspective (and not the measurement
point of view) in order to signiﬁcantly minimize the prob-
ability of detection. In [8] [9], the authors studied probing

activities towards a large campus network using netﬂow data.
They attempted to ﬁnd different probing strategies and study
their harmfulness. They analyzed the scanning behaviors by
introducing the notion of gray IP space and techniques to
detect potential scanners. Pryadkin et al. [10] performed an
empirical evaluation of cyber space to infer the occupancy of
IP addresses. In addition, J. Heidemann et al. [11] was one of
the ﬁrst works to survey the edge hosts in the public Internet.
Cui et al. [12] analyzed a wide-area scan and presented a quan-
titative lower bound on the number of vulnerable embedded
devices on a global scale. Further, in [13], the authors analyzed
data from a large darknet composed of 5.5 million addresses to
study Internet-wide probing activities. They detected probing
events as large spikes generated by unique sources.
Furthermore, in [14], we have proposed a hybrid approach
based on time-series analysis and context triggered piecewise
hashing as applied to passive darknet dataset to infer, character-
ize and cluster probing activities targeting CPS protocols. Our
work is complementary to the aforementioned contributions by
focusing only on probes targeting CPS honeypots.
B. CPS Trafﬁc Analysis
CPS network trafﬁc monitoring and analysis can be divided
in two main categories, namely, interactive monitoring and
passive monitoring. On one hand, honeypots are an example
of low- to high-interactive trap-based monitoring systems [2].
The ﬁrst CPS honeypot, known as the SCADA HoneyNet
Project, was designed and deployed in 2004 by Cisco Sys-
tems [15]. Digital Bond, a company that specializes in CPS
cyber-security, deployed two SCADA honeypots in 2006 [16].
The release of Conpot in 2013 has greatly facilitated the
deployment and management of CPS honeypots [17]. In order
to evaluate the strength of a given honeypot in deceiving
the attackers, Sysman et al. [18] introduced the notion of
“Indicators of Deception”, where some of the most popular
low and medium interaction honeypots were examined. An
indicator of deception is an action performed by the honeypot
that may alert the attackers to identify that they are interacting
with a honeypot. For example, Artillery [19] honeypot, by
default blocks any malicious activities trying to connect with
the services they emulate. Therefore, such honeypot is easy
to be identiﬁed only due to their default action. Therefore,
the deployed conpot was carefully conﬁgured to deceive the
intruders without being noticed.
On the other hand, in terms of passive analysis, such
methods include the study of network telescope trafﬁc to
generate statistics and trends related to various inferred CPS
misdemeanors. The ﬁrst limited reported network telescope
study which addressed the security of CPS protocols was
conducted in 2008 by Team Cymru [20]. Their report included
coarse statistics on scans targeting commonly used CPS pro-
tocols, such as Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) [21],
Modbus [22] and Rockwell-encap [23]. Vasilomanolakis et
al. [24] propsed a multi-stage attack detection system based
on the attack signature analysis with CPS honeypot. The
authors introduced a mobile device based CPS honeypot that
monitors incoming probing activities, in general. Unlike the
work presented in [24], our proposed methodology presents
the ﬁrst large-scale experimentation of the deployment and
operation of a CPS-speciﬁc attacks by leveraging existing
CPS honeypot that performs the essential analytics on attacks
targeting CPS services on a darknet.
In contrast to current practices, in this work, we intend
to establish a large-scale honeynet infrastructure to collect and
curate CPS data from a plethora of systems and conﬁgurations.
While the utilization of honeypots in cyber security tasks is
deﬁnitely not new, their use cases tended to be ad hoc, indepen-
dent and non-CPS focused. Thus, we propose a systematic and
collaborative approach to harvest Internet-scale CPS honeypot
data in a planned/staged manner.
III.
METHODOLOGY
The proposed methodology consists of three phases: (1)
data monitoring, which includes data collection; (2) data
analytics, which provides statistics and information on the
collected data; and (3) result’s validation, which proves and
afﬁrms the obtained results.
In a nutshell, the monitored Internet activities are amal-
gamated into a centralized database for analysis and insights
generation. Finally, the results are validated via trusted third
party data-sets. Figure 1 provides an overview of our method-
ology. The deployed infrastructure is composed of 32 hosts
distributed in 8 countries. In this setup, we were able to
monitor activities originating from more than 40 countries
targeting countries where the monitors are deployed.
First, in the data monitoring phase, every host is assigned
an Internet public IP address to attract any unauthorized
SCADA activity. Subsequently, we leverage three types of
sensors that run simultaneously on the incoming trafﬁc. We
describe each of the sensors below:
•
Generic sensors, which are conﬁgured to collect data
from various communication protocols, SCADA and
non-SCADA. Such sensors aim at (1) collecting all
activities for through network investigation; and 2)
helping in differentiating between random and fo-
cused SCADA activities. Please note that the deployed
infrastructure mimics the internal dynamics of CPS
systems, where the external vantage point has been
protected by basic conﬁguration of iptables.
•
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) sensors,
which are Network based Intrusion Detection System,
are used to identify threats that target the generic
sensors as well as SCADA sensors. Such sensors
provide more insights on the intention of the captured
network activity. In this work, we have leveraged
Snort [25] engine, an open-source NIDS, to detect and
classify intrusions.
•
SCADA sensors, which are typical SCADA honeypots
which have been setup in interactive mode. SCADA
sensors have been conﬁgured to monitor incoming
trafﬁc targeting SCADA protocols, namely, Modbus
and Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) as per their
default setup [2]. Typical CPS dynamics (i.e., control
and communications) provided by Modbus on port
TCP 502 and Siemens on port TCP 102 have been
emulated. Please note that the honeypots have been
conﬁgured with public IP addresses but have not
been advertised publically to prevent their immediate
exploitation.

Second, in the analysis phase, the collected data from the
monitors are pushed into an un-relational database for further
analysis. In this context, we leverage several open source
tools (e.g., whois [26]) to characterize the SCADA activities
and identify the countries, cities, and Autonomous System
(AS) names involved. Furthermore, the amalgamation in the
previous phase allows us to correlate between the generic
sensors and NIDS sensors data with the SCADA sensors data.
For instance, we were able to tell the percentage of SCADA
communication compared to generic ones and the types of
threats afﬁliated to SCADA activities.
Last but not least, in order to validate our ﬁndings, reduce
false positives and assess our methodology in identifying
unreported (potential 0-days) attempts, we leverage three other
trusted third-party datasets, namely, DShield [27], AbuseIPDB
[28] and Cymon [29]. Such datasets provide rich insights
on suspicious Internet activities such as types of threats and
reputations of IP addresses. In the next section, we list our
results based on this proposed multi-phase approach.
IV.
PRELIMINARY RESULTS
The aim of this section is to provide an overview of
our results based on our proposed approach. This section is
divided into three parts. On one hand, the ﬁrst part provides
a characterization based on the overall data collected from
our generic sensors. The latter collects generic network ﬂow
information which might include conventional Internet com-
munications including SCADA activities. In fact, even if we
setup a SCADA sensor, as long as it is publicly available,
adversaries’ activities can target SCADA services, in addition
to any other services (ports) available on this sensor. On the
other hand, the second part provides more detailed analysis
based on SCADA sensors only. These sensors are dedicated to
imitate SCADA hosts.
We have setup the SCADA sensor as per the open source
deployment in [2]. We run the sensor in default mode, which
emulates the basic SCADA host on the following services:
Siemens S7-200 [30] Central Processing Unit (CPU) with 2
slaves, Modbus on port 502 Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP), S7 Communication (S7Comm) [31] on port 102 TCP,
HTTP on port 80 TCP, and Simple Network Management
Protocol (SNMP) on port 161 User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
Finally, the last part provides an overview of the threats
associated to such SCADA activities. Such inference can help
us understand the impact of these activities and the intention
of the user, who is originating the cyber activity.
A. Data Overview
As mentioned earlier, this section provides an overview of
any Internet activities or network trafﬁc targeting the deployed
sensors.
Overall, Figure 2 provides an overview of: 1) the number
of identiﬁed ﬂows, where a ﬂow is deﬁned as a collection
of packets originating from one source IP address to one or
multiple destination IP addresses; 2) total unique IP counts; 3)
total number of scanning activities in all ﬂows; and 4) alerts
and intrusions associated to these ﬂows.
The number of alerts and intrusions identiﬁed via network-
based monitoring systems [25] is relatively high due to the
fact that one source IP address within a ﬂow might generate
multiple threats on multiple sensors. Further discussion will
be elaborated in Section IV-B. It is important to mention that
our data is based on one-month period, namely, March 2018.

provides the top 10 source countries. United States is leading
in terms of activities, followed by China then Brazil and
Russia. Note that the United States generated around 44,500
ﬂows, which is almost 38% of the global top countries. It
is noteworthy to mention the surprising appearance of small
countries in Asia, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, which have
generated a relatively large number (almost 30%) of activities.

Figure 3. Top 10 Source Countries - Generic Sensors
We further classify the network trafﬁc based on the initiat-
ing Autonomous Systems (AS). An AS number can uniquely
identify Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
In Figure 4, we list the top 10 AS numbers, as per the trafﬁc
targeting our generic sensors. It is worth mentioning that, given
that United States is identiﬁed as the highest country gen-
erating Internet trafﬁc, however, based on AS classiﬁcations,
Brazil is identiﬁed as the highest with 22.6% of the total trafﬁc.
This means that more network ﬂows are originated from one
single Brazilian AS number as compared to the United States,
where more distributed ﬂows are originated from various AS
numbers. It is noteworthy to mention that Chinese ASes, which
are ranked second and third, have generated together around
35% of the top ASes’ trafﬁc.

B. SCADA-Speciﬁc Cyber Activities
In this section, we aim at inferring probing events targeting
main SCADA communication and control protocols as per
the deployment of sensors in [2]. Using this deployment, we
identiﬁed 54,511 SCADA cyber activities, in which 1,173
unique IP address are involved. This number of activities
represents almost 21% of the total 260,741 generic cyber
events, which were identiﬁed in the previous section (IV-A).
As shown in Figure 5, almost half (48.4%) of the top
SCADA activities is generated from the United States. Fur-
thermore, as per the AS name representation in Figure 6, the
United States ASes are dominating with CariNet on top of the
list. In light of the ﬁndings in Figure 6, we can further cate-
gorize probing events based on ASes associated services. For
example, the purpose of probing can be to conduct scientiﬁc
research [32] such as University of Michigan (UMICH in US),
or the malicious probing activities got generated using a leased
host from external service providers such as Linode [33] and
Leasweb [34].

It is noteworthy to mention Seychelles among the top 5

ﬁnd countries with weak or absent cyber security policies. In
general, such islands can be easily set for botnet, Command
and Control C&C servers and repositories of stolen informa-
tion.

Figure 6. Top Source AS Names - SCADA Activities
In order to assess the severity of such SCADA activities,
we have classiﬁed the trafﬁc as per Table I. In a nutshell, our
classiﬁcation, which is motivated by [2], ﬂags the network
severity as medium, once a session is created, high if a
request or response is generated, and critical if messages are
transferred or communicated among the deployed monitors and
the source IP addresses. Since the monitoring sensors are set
on unused IP addresses, any trafﬁc targeting them is deemed to
be suspicious and/or unauthorized, or at least misconﬁgured.
As per the aforementioned approach, the investigation
revealed that 13% of SCADA cyber activities are of medium
severity, 64% of highly severity and 23% of critical severity.

In order to achieve a better accuracy and understanding
as per the abused services, next, we characterize the com-
munication per the targeted ports, which represent speciﬁc
operated services. Figure 8 visualizes the distribution of abused
services for those of critical severity only. This means that
such activities have not just probed requested connection or a
session to the deployed monitors, but also have shared data,
after the connection setup.

It is not very surprising to identify that Modbus is the most
(75%) critically abused SCADA service. Such result is not new
for security researchers [14], who have already found similar
results based on the analysis of passive monitoring sensors. It is
also important to mention that Modbus is the most widely used
SCADA service today. In addition to S7comm and BACnet,
which came second and third after Modbus respectively, the
Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) has been
also found but with very minimal numbers (total of 4%).
C. Validation
In an attempt to validate our ﬁndings, we adopt the ap-
proach used in [14], where publicly available online databases
namely DShield, AbuseIPDB, and Cymon are used. Undoubt-
edly, the integration and synergy of the ﬁndings from multiple
online databases will lead to better validation of the obtained
results.
DShield is a community-based ﬁrewall log correlation
system that holds records on reported suspicious IP addresses.
Furthermore, the online database returns the risk scale, targeted
attacks and a total number of the report counts. DShield reports
the speciousness of a reported IP address on a scale from 0%
(lowest) to 100% (highest)
As stated earlier, we validated the source IP addresses of
the SCADA network communication activities. Our ﬁndings
revealed that 100% of the worldwide source IP addresses were
found in DShield, with an average risk scale of 53%. Among
the highly risky malicious sources of SCADA communication,
where the risk scale was either 90% or 100%, the maximum
attack counts are 2,946 and 53,215 report counts. Overall, the
average attack counts of the detected source IP addresses is
1,199, while the average reported malicious IP addresses were
22,016. DShield ﬁndings summary are listed in Table II.

To measure the abuse conﬁdence rate of the detected
SCADA activities, we used the AbuseIPDB’s online repository
which indexes Internet-scale specious IP addresses as reported
by the service providers and backbone network operators. Our
investigation revealed that the average abuse conﬁdence rate of
the unsolicited interaction is 67.4%, with a maximum of 100%
abuse conﬁdence rate and the minimum of 15%. A summary
of the validation results are listed in Table II.
In an effort to map the results obtained from AbuseIPDB
to DShield, we observed that despite the high-risk scale of
the source of SCADA trafﬁc, the abuse conﬁdence rate varied
from 15% to 57%. This implies that there are abuse cases
reported for those IP addresses in DShield and that have not
been reported in AbuseIPDB.
Next, we will correlate threats generated from such activ-
ities. To identify the type of the network trafﬁc activities, we
levereged Cymon’s [29] online repository. Cymon is a largest

open source tracker of malware, botnets, spams, etc. Based
on our ﬁndings, 66.6% of malicious activities were e-mail
attacks, and 50% of the following types: WEB attacks, Internet
Message Access Protocol (IMAP) attacks, Secure Shell (SSH)
attacks, and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) attacks. In addition
to the attacks, 16.6% of scanning activities were detected, such
as Domain Name Service (DNS) attacks, password disclosure
attempts, telnet scans and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
scans.

DISCUSSION
In this section, we interpret and describe the signiﬁcance
of our ﬁndings in light of the proposed methodology.
Vantage Points: Our contribution is limited to the number
of deployed monitors. Although this study covers 32 moni-
tors across 8 countries, we cannot identify SCADA activities
targeting networks beyond such vantage points. However, we
believe that this work is a step forward for building a more
distributed network of monitors at large-scale.
Internal SCADA Dynamics: Our model covers the CPS
communication targeting SCADA hosts from an Internet
perspective. However, this contribution does not cover the
security or monitoring of communications within SCADA
systems (e.g., inside a power plant), neither hardware devices
(e.g., physical smart grid). Our approach complements on-
site SCADA security mechanisms such as network isolation
SCADA security systems.
VI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Conducting research on SCADA data is challenging due to
the restrictions on physically accessing critical infrastructure
sites. In this paper, we have analyzed SCADA data inde-
pendently of the infrastructure, via SCADA sensors deployed
on the Internet. Our contribution is unique in terms of the
following items: 1) our dataset which is collected from more
than 32 deployments in 8 countries and (2) our analysis
which correlates conventional data with SCADA data and
associated threats. Our analysis uncovers unsolicited trafﬁc
originating from various countries and AS names. Our future
work involves fully-automating the detection and analysis
models at a large scale and in real-time. Furthermore, we are
developing algorithms to provide insights on the intention of
the scans (i.e., benign vs malicious). The purpose is to produce
threat intelligence data and sharing in addition to generating
notiﬁcations for awareness and mitigation of threats against
SCADA systems.
