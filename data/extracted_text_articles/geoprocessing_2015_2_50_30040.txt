Abstract – The land use and land cover (LULC) changes have 
influenced the water quality. Thus, addressing LULC can lead 
to the understanding of the actual problems and how to avoid 
future water stress problems. This paper presents a model that 
integrates land use and land cover changes (LUCC), and their 
impacts on water quality. The model is tested for the main 
drinking water reserve for Continental Portugal, the Castelo 
de Bode Dam located in the Zêzere watershed. This work 
integrates the specifications of SmartOpenData Project 
(SmOD), and is strictly related to the work developed in the 
eEnvPlus, and TerAGUA projects. It considers INSPIRE 
Directive specifications, and those related to linked open data 
integration. The results obtained so far address the most 
relevant LULC changes in Portugal, but can easily be applied 
to study the problem in other countries, allowing the creation 
of guidelines for spatial planning integrating the concerns of 
the Water Framework Directive.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The land use and land cover (LULC) of the territory is 
constantly changing, mainly due the anthropogenic actions, 
but also due to natural causes. Many of these changes have a 
negative impact on water quality, a fact cited by some 
authors that show that there is a cause and effect relation 
between some land use/cover changes (LUCC) and the 
decrease in water quality [1]-[4]. The human related LUCC, 
namely deforestation, urbanization, urban sprawl or less 
adequate agricultural practices where large amounts of 
chemicals are applied (from industrial or domestic origin) is 
therefore a key factor to build well balanced land use 
planning initiates. Many land use practices result in an 
increase of contaminants that are easily transported to 
watercourses, contribute to the degradation of important 
water reserves namely those for public supply, and inducing 
relevant water stress [6]-[10].  
Being so it is important to have an integrated watershed 
land use planning and management system, integrating the 
water legal framework with the land use planning legal 
framework with updated knowledge on LUCC changes and 
ongoing management of natural resources: water, energy 
production, 
environmental 
protection 
integrated 
with 
socioeconomic development strategies.  
The interconnection between these areas is essential to 
understand the intensity of land use changes upstream of a 
drinking water reserve, in order to understand the impact of 
land use changes in water stress [11]. Therefore, it is 
essential to integrate LULC knowledge, e.g., intensive 
agriculture, industry location, urbanization and urban sprawl, 
with existing water treatment plants, the monitoring of 
human activities and their water management requirements. 
The gradual decrease in natural water quality, namely for 
drinking water reserves, leads to increasing pressures on 
water management efficiency in order to reduce migration or 
leaching of certain contaminants in surface and ground 
waters downstream. The increasing risk for public health is 
also relevant.

Water quality preservation is consequently a main 
concern for governments and for the communities as a 
whole. Assuring water quality for different purposes, and 
namely providing drinking water supply in the short and long 
terms, is essential to preserve the future of every Nation and 
is a basis for economic development [7].  
Less effective approaches to management imply the need 
for large investments, which lead to increasing operational 
and maintenance costs, usually charged, directly or 
indirectly, to the final consumers. Thus, it is necessary to 
establish measures linking economic development models to 
efficient local, regional, national and international water 
management, establishing priorities to the most relevant 
water reserves, in line with an efficient and sustainable 
management of resources and management of the territory.  
The provision of environmental 
and 
geographic 
information (linked data), in a semi-structured, shared web 
based platform, will be an asset for the efficiency and 
sustainability management models of these resources. This 
will allow the scientific community to monitor and further 
study the phenomena in order to build solutions that lead to 
avoid or reduce negative impacts on water quality and to 
assure that effective results will increase [5]-[12]-[13]. This 
information will be important for licensing small and 
medium-sized enterprises that require this natural resource, 
for citizens as for public institutions, so that everyone linked 
to the implementation of the development model can be 
involved [7]-[8]. 
The SmartOpenData Project has created a Linked Open 
Data Infrastructure and available data resources for 
biodiversity and environment protection, in relevant areas 
(Protected Areas and National Parks) for some European 
countries. This project is focused on how Linked Open Data 
can be applied to spatial data resource management, to public 
open data portals and to initiatives like GEOSS Data-CORE, 
Copernicus (formerly known as GMES), INSPIRE and 
voluntary data (OpenStreetMap, GEO Wiki, etc.), and how it 
can impact on the economic and sustainability progress in 
European Environment research and Biodiversity Protection. 
This will be achieved by making existing “INSPIRE based” 
relevant spatial data sets, services and appropriate metadata 
available through a new Linked Data structure. In addition, 
the infrastructure will provide automatic search engines that 
will search additional available geospatial resources (OGC 
and RDF structures) across the web. A RDF (Resource 
Description Framework) structure is used to describe the 
relation between two objects The point is that by re-using 
existing identifiers available in the Linked Open Data cloud, 
SmartOpenData immediately will have access to a lot of 
other data sources and these will be available through 
SPARQL queries [9]-[11]. 
Understanding and 
maintaining 
watershed related 
knowledge is a very high data consuming issue. Namely 
maintaining LULC updated along with many other 
socioeconomic relevant data repositories requires substantial 
financial support. 
This issue could be partially addressed by similar open 
data approaches like the one described above or in a more 
structured way like the one included in [7], involving 
communities, enterprises and governments in a shared effort 
for data maintenance with a clear purpose of monitoring 
drinking 
water 
quality 
and 
to 
achieve 
sustainable 
development.   
The areas with reservoirs considered strategic for the 
public water supply, should be integrated into the so-called 
"Smart Regions" crossing over protection areas like “Nature 
2000 network” and requiring specific management rules, 
integrated in a participative web based platform, business 
oriented, but built upon an extranet approach so that 
interested 
citizens 
and public 
authorities 
can 
help 
consolidating effective LUCC changes that lead to effective 
drinking water preservation and supply in a cost-benefit 
effective way. 
The proposed evaluation model for LUCC and their 
impacts on water quality should also contribute to the 
creation of sustainable measures, especially measures that 
lead to the smallest human pressure in forest soils, 
agriculture (reduction of agrochemical application), forest 
fires risk, and artificial unbalanced transformations, in the 
vicinity of the reservoirs namely near water catchments for 
public supply. 
The relevant framework implemented so far by the 
researchers in this field, is in line with the concerns of the 
Inspire Governance Group, and can be used in future 
territorial planning actions namely identifying combined 
areas and locations that increasingly contribute to water 
degradation. Establishing relations of water preservation, 
land use identification and land use intensity allowance, is 
therefore essential for drinking water preservation in line 
with land use planning, in a cost effective way to achieve 
effective economic growth.  
The shared information management, web based 
approach will furthermore increase the knowledge made 
available for good governance putting in line different 
development perspectives, from local and regional views to 
the national planning intents and investment; all this must be 
supported by an effective way of redistributing development 
benefits and preservation costs, taking here, as example, the 
well balanced watershed management, supports by a well-
balanced land use planning model integrating cadaster 
concerns. 
In Section II, we present the methodology to LUCC 
determinations and the relations with variations of water 
quality parameters. Section III presents the preliminary 
results and discussion of LUCC in Continental Portugal, and 
the relations between LUCC and water quality degradation 
in Castelo de Bode Dam. Section IV presents the final 
considerations.

METHODOLOGY 
In Portugal, substantial work is being developed in order 
to build solid co-operative Web-GIS based systems to 
address land use and water management in an effective and 
equitable way. The most relevant work relates to the 
TerAGUA co-operative approach and is being explored in 
the context of the SmartOpenData Project. It contemplates 
the development of a prototype model that includes the 
evaluation of land use and land cover changes and their

influenced the water quality of Zêzere watershed catchment 
(sub-basin of Tagus River). The datasets used in this project 
contemplate essentially open data (CORINE Land Cover - 
CLC, geomorphologic and environmental data), integrated 
and put in line with all relevant official data. The shared 
open analysis model will quantify the LUCC, its spatial 
distribution within the Portuguese continental area, and allow 
on the fly comparisons with environmental, namely water 
related, data. The results will be integrated in INSPIRE 
infrastructure, under clear descriptions and to be addressed 
through unique identifiers, including the INSPIRE themes, 
code 
lists, 
application 
schemas, 
discovery 
services, 
integrated with the RDF application (Fig. 1).

Project) and the possible aplications (WQP - Water Quality Parametrs; 
LULC – Land User and Land Cover; t – time). 
 
The expected results will be used as a complement in 
planning actions, in particular to identify uses and locations 
that contribute the most to the degradation of water quality 
(depending on the LULC and also of LUCC that cause high 
negative impacts). This identification of LUCC with greater 
impact on surface water will be crucial to water quality 
preservation within the study area (economic cost reduction 
in line with efficient management of water treatment), but 
also to estimate the impact of intensively artificialized 
territory near water catchments, and will be used as the basis 
for a sustainable water and land planning in the EU. 
III. 
PRELIMINARY RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. LUCC in Continental Portugal 
In Continental Portugal the larger areas of LULC are the 
heterogeneous agricultural areas and forests (Table 1). 
According to this data, in the last two decades, forest areas 
have declined due to the transition to scrub and/or 
herbaceous vegetation, hence an increase in the area of this 
last type of LULC. The reduction of this type of LULC has 
direct implications on water quality, namely in the increase 
of sediments dragged to the water courses due the erosion 
along with the increase of chemical elements dragged or 
leached from exposed soils without any type of protection to 
storm water [2]. 
The registered loss of arable land may be explained to 
some extent by the disinvestment in agriculture and to the 
lack of structural support to small and medium-sized 
farmers, owners of small fragmented land, the most common 
within the Portuguese context, inducing abandonment of 
these lands. These soils, due to the advance of natural 
vegetation, began to be occupied by scrub and/or herbaceous 
vegetation associations, land cover that is strictly related to 
increasing risk of forest fire. 
The area of artificial surfaces also increased, taking 
agricultural and forest soils. Land artificialized or built area 
can be highly correlated with the amount of sediment that 
goes into watercourses, with several aggravating factors as, 
for example, the amount of surface runoff waters due to soil 
sealing, but also the speed of runoff, causing sometimes 
flooding and increasing sediments transport. Increasing 
urban sprawl along the margins of water bodies, delivers 
wastewater (sewage) drainage without any domestic 
treatment directly to these reservoirs leading to water quality 
deterioration within these reservoirs.

B. LUCC and Water Quality Degradation in Castelo de 
Bode Dam  
Assessing main LUCC in Continental Portugal, lead us to 
better understand these LULC impact on water quality.  
Castelo de Bode Dam reservoir is the most relevant 
drinking water public supply within the Portuguese context. 
It is located in the Tagus River Watershed. For this work the 
drainage area considered is the area that includes the water 
catchment drainage upstream of the Zêzere river watershed 
(an area of 396434 ha). Within this area it has been a 
statistical based model, and established a correspondence 
between the LUCC and the variation of water quality 
parameters (WQP), considering the four years that covers the 
LUCC. The most important LULC of this drainage area in 
the 1990s were forests, however, this type of LULC 
decreased since then and the scrub and/or herbaceous 
vegetation associations became predominant in 2012 (Table 
2).

WQP were obtained through data recorded by automatic 
stations located in Castelo de Bode dam reservoir (Alb. de 
Castelo Bode - 16H/03; Cabeça Gorda - 16H/06; 
Constância - 17G/03; Colmeal - 16H/05) and thought 
laboratorial analysis, data provided by the National System 
of Hydrological Decade Resources of Portugal. 
The correlation coefficients obtained and presented in 
Table 4, show a high positive correlation between soil 
artificialization and the variation of BOD5 (Biochemical 
Oxygen Demand). These results indicate that the more soil 
artificialized the greater the biochemical oxygen demand in 
the waters of the Castelo de Bode Dam reservoir. 
On the other hand, variations of lead content, total 
coliforms, total nitrogen and total nitrites in water shows 
positive correlation with mine, dump and construction sites 
and open spaces with little or no vegetation, might be 
explained by the high use of leaded materials in the 
construction of infrastructures, entrainment of materials 
resulting from mining extraction and also by the presence of 
waste dumps. 
Water color changes is positively correlated with 
variation in areas of industrial, commercial and transport 
units, as with associations of scrub and/or herbaceous 
vegetation. These LULC types influence the amount of 
materials dragged by surface runoff leading to reduction of 
water quality downstream.  
Another relevant conclusion concerns the positive 
correlation between phenols variation and urban fabric 
industrial, commercial and transport units, or artificial, 
non-agricultural, vegetated areas. 
The positive correlation between arable land and total 
nitrites might be explained by previous application of 
chemical fertilizers in these soils and agrochemicals in these 
cultures. 
All this assumptions demonstrate that LUCC influence 
water quality and consequently water Framework Directive 
accomplishment could benefit from this data management 
insight approach. 
C. Interative Model and Results Dessimination 
These data models and presented results are being 
integrated into a WebGIS databases in order to take 
advantage of Information and Communication Tools (ICT) 
to assure government action integration and public 
participation

done in order to its dissemination using relevant WebGIS 
platforms (e.g., SmartOpenData, DGT WebSIG - SNIG and 
IGEO, eEnvPlus, TerAGUA).  
 These results show the relations between LUCC and 
water quality changes. The platform being developed can be 
used as a knowledge base for all decision makers researchers 
and interested agents involved in water management and 
territorial planning and survey. The interactivity between 
producers and users of these data (including the 
stakeholders) in Web platforms will enable the improvement 
of information production efficiency, and will lead to 
increased knowledge in an integrated and harmonized way. 
IV. 
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The results presented in this article show LULC is tightly 
related to water quality. In fact, LUCC within a watershed, 
namely those related to anthropogenic activities explain to a 
large extent the impacts on the quality. This can be verified 
in the Castelo de Bode Dam reservoir between 1990 and 
2012. 
In this sense, classifying LULC in terms of their impact 
in water quality degradation, integrating all assumptions in a 
WebGIS collaborative portal has high relevance to achieve 
efficiency in water and land use management domains. 
The developed work points to the relevance of sharing 
knowledge and integrating data in a structured way, that 
users can address and combine to evaluate land use planning 
alternatives and their impact on water quality. Data providers 
can also receive inputs from one another and from relevant 
users, namely governmental entities with clear attributions in 
these fields, allowing them to be effective in data collection 
and integration.  
The increase in area of certain types of LULC has an 
effect on water quality and contributes to the increase on the 
concentration of pollutants drained or dragged to the main 
water reservoirs. This study is a highly demanding task that 
needs a knowledge base complete and up to date. It is 
essential to extend this approach to other regions so that 
water management efficiency will increase and the 
effectiveness of public investments can lead to water stress 
decline supported in the long term by land use planning 
efficiency.  
All these concerns have to be in line with data collection 
policy, existing data integration, and well balanced 
management tools development.
