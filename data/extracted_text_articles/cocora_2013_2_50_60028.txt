Abstract—Cognitive radio (CR) is one of the most promising
next-generation communication systems due to its ability to
improve spectrum utilization by the detection and the use
of vacant channels of licensed users. Reliable detection of
the licensed user signal is a pre-requirement for avoiding
interference to the licensed user in a CR network. Cooperative
spectrum sensing (CSS) is able to offer AN improved sensing
performance compared to individual sensing. However, in CSS
transmission of raw data from cognitive user (CU) to the
fusion center (FC) requires large bandwidth of control channel,
long latency and high consumption power. A quantization
scheme, in which the raw data can be quantized with few
bits at the CU and then be reported to the FC, can solve
these problems of raw data transmission. In this paper, we
proposed a quantization scheme based on Kullback-Leibler
(KL) Divergence for reducing the number of quantization bits
while keeping the similar sensing performance to the case that
raw sensing data are used. Through simulation, it shown that
the proposed scheme can achieve better sensing performance
than that of uniform quantization scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, additional bandwidth and higher bitrates have
been required in order to meet the users demands in wireless
communication systems. As a result, available frequency
bands have become a scarce resource. However, according to
the Federal Communications Commissions spectrum policy
task force report [1], actual utilization of the licensed spec-
trum varies from 15% to 80%. Cognitive radio technology
[2] has been proposed to solve the problem of ineffective uti-
lization of spectrum bands. The scarcity of spectrum bands
can be relieved by allowing some CUs to opportunistically
access the spectrum assigned to the Primary user (PU)
whenever the channel is free. However, CUs must vacate
their frequency when the presence of a PU is detected.
Therefore, reliable detection of the PU signal is an essential
requirement of CR networks.
To ascertain the presence of a PU, CUs can use one
of several common detection methods, such as matched
ﬁlter, feature, and energy detection methods [2], [3].Energy
detection is the optimal method if the CR user has limited in-
formation about a PU signal (e.g., only the local noise power
is known) [3]. With energy detection, the frequency energy
in the sensing channel is received in a ﬁxed bandwidth, W,
over an observation time window, T, in order to compare
with the energy threshold and determine whether or not
the channel is being utilized. However, the received signal
energy may severely ﬂuctuate due to multipath fading and
shadowing effects; therefore, it is difﬁcult to obtain reliable
detection with only one CR user. Fortunately, improved
usage detection can be obtained by allowing some CR users
to perform Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) [4].
In CSS, a quantization scheme can help to reduce the over-
head in the control channels which is mainly due to trans-
mission of raw data from CUs and the FC. KL-divergence
theory often uses as a measure of the (dis)similarity between
two distributions [5]. Subsequently, KL-divergence can be
used to measure reliability of sensing information in CSS.
In this paper, therefore we proposed a quantization scheme
based on KL-divergence theory for CSS in CR network, in
which KL-divergence is used as a reliable level of sensing
data to decide boundary points for quantization scheme.
In particular, in Section II, we describe system model of
the proposed scheme. In Section III, we present detail of
the proposed quantization scheme based on KL-divergence.
In Section IV, simulation results are shown for evaluating
performance of the proposed scheme. Finally, we conclude
the paper in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a CR network composed of N CR users and
one PU. All of the CR users use energy detectors to detect
the presence of the PU signal. In order to perform CSS,
sensing information will be quantized at CUs and after that
they will be reported to the Fusion Center (FC) through a
control channel. At the FC, all quantization levels obtained
from the CUs will be combined to make a global decision
concerning about the presence or absence of the PU signal
by using equal gain combination (EGC) rule.

KL-divergences according to the presence or absence hypothesis
of PU signal.
The received signal of a CU under absence and presence
hypothesis of PU signal can be formulated as follows:
{ H0 : xj (k) = nj (k)
H1 : xj (k) = hjs (k) + nj (k)
(1)
where H0 and H1 correspond to the hypothesis of the
absence and presence, respectively, of the PU signal, xj(k)
represents the signal received by the jth CU, hj denotes the
amplitude gain of the channel, s(k) is the signal transmitted
from the PU, and nj(k) is the additive white Gaussian noise.
At the ith sensing interval for the jth CU, the received
signal energy, Ej(i), is given as
Ej (i) =
{ ∑ki+M−1
k=ki
|nj (k)|2,
H0
∑ki+M−1
k=ki
|hjx (k) + nj (k)|2,
H1
(2)
where M is the number of samples over one sensing interval,
and ki is the time slot at which the ith sensing interval
begins. When M is relatively large (e.g. M > 200), Ej
can be closely approximated as a Gaussian random variable
under both hypotheses such that
Ej ∼
{ N (M, 2M) ,
H0
N (M (γj + 1) , 2M (2γj + 1)) , H1
(3)
where γj is the SNR of the channel between the PU and the
jth CU.
III. THE PROPOSED QUANTIZATION SCHEME BASED ON
KULLBACK-LEIBLER DIVERGENCE FOR COOPERATIVE
SPECTRUM SENSING
A. Kullback-Leibler Divergence
The KL-divergence [5] is also known as the relative
entropy between two probability density functions, f(x) and
g(x), such that
D (f ∥g ) =
∫
f (x) log
[f (x)
g (x)
]
dx
(4)
It is obvious that the KL-divergence is always non-
negative. Also, it is zero if and only if the two distribu-
tions coincide. KL-divergence is often used as a measure
of the (dis)similarity between two distributions. The KL-
divergence between two normal distributions with means and
variance as f ∼
(
µf, σ2
f
)
and g ∼
(
µg, σ2
g
)
respectively,
can be obtained such that [6]

B. The Proposed Quantization Scheme based on Kullback-
Leibler Divergence
Since KL-divergence is a useful tool to measure the
(dis)similarity between two distributions, it can be a suitable
measurement for reliability of sensing information (e.g.
received signal energy) in spectrum sensing. Subsequently,
KL-divergence will be utilized to decide quantization bound-
ary for sensing information in CU.
Firstly, based on current received signal energy, the “tem-
porary mean” and “temporary variance” of received signal
energy under H0, µj,0 te(i) and σ2
j,0 te(i), or H1, µj,1 te(i)
and σ2
j,1 te(i), hypothesis of the PU signal will be calculated
as follows, respectively:



µj,0 te (i) = m−1
m µj,0 + 1
mEj (i)
σ2
j,0 te (i) = m−1
m σ2
j,0
+ m−1
m2 [Ej (i) − µj,0]2,
(6)



µj,1 te (i) = m−1
m µj,1 + 1
mEj (i)
σ2
j,1 te (i) = m−1
m σ2
j,1
+ m−1
m2 [Ej (i) − µj,1 te]2,
(7)
where µj,0, σ2
j,0 and µj,1, σ2
j,1 are the means and variances
of the received signal energy of the jth CR user under
H0 and H1 hypothesis of the PU signal respectively, and
m is the pre-deﬁned constant that represents the “effecting
level” of the current received signal energy to its mean and
variance. Based on numerical experiments, it is observed that
the value of m should be chosen from 20 to 50 for keeping
the accuracy of the sensing performance.
The KL-divergences will be calculated between the PDF
and temporary PDF (with temporary mean and variance)
of the received signal energy of each CR user under the
presence or absence hypothesis of the PU signal, denoted as
dj,1(i) and dj,0(i), respectively. Base on Eqn. (5), we are
able to deﬁne
dj,0(i) = D [µj,0 te (i) , µj,0, σ2
j,0 te (i) , σ2
j,0
]
dj,1(i) = D [µj,1 te (i) , µj,1, σ2
j,1 te (i) , σ2
j,1
]

Fig. 1 shows an example of KL-divergence calculations
of a CU.
Here, we deﬁne the “extended KL-divergence” as follows

It can be seen that dj(i) can obtain higher value when the
value of dj,1(i) is smaller and the value of dj,0(i) is higher.
It means that if the value of dj(i) is higher, the current
received signal energy Ej(i) will “near” H1 distribution
than H0 distribution. In contrary, if the value of dj(i) is
smaller, the current received signal energy Ej(i) will “near”
H0 distribution than H1 distribution. Subsequently, dj(i) can
represent for reliable level of the sensing information, e.g.
with higher absolute value of dj(i), we have more reliable
sensing information.
We propose a quantization scheme based on the “extended
KL-divergence” of which ﬂow-chart is shown in Fig. 2.
At the ﬁrst state, the values range of dj [dj.min, dj.max]
will be splited into 2Nb equal parts by (2Nb + 1) “KL-
boundary” poits, Bdj, as
Bdj (n) = dj. min + n − 1
Nb (dj. max − dj. min)
(10)
where n = 1, ..., 2Nb + 1, Nb is number of quantization
bits, dj. max = KL(max Ej) and dj. min = KL(min Ej).
At the ﬁrst sensing interval, the maximum value, max Ej,
and minimum value, min Ej, of received signal energy of
the jth CU can be set as (µj,1 + σj,1) and (µj,0 − σj,0)
respectively. After that, they are updated based on the real
received signal energy, that is, if the current received signal
energy is higher than max Ej, max Ej will be set to be equal
to the current received signal energy. On the other hand, if
the current received signal energy is smaller than min Ej,
min Ej will be set to be equal to the current received signal
energy.
For the next state, the “energy-boundary” will be calcu-
lated according to the values of “KL-boundary” as follows:
BEj (n) = KL−1 (Bdj (n))
(11)
Based on “energy-boundary”, each CU quantizes the
received signal energy and reports quantization level to the
FC. We deﬁne uj(i) as the quantization decision and Ej(i)
as the quantization input. The quantization process Q(.) can
be expressed as
uj (i)
=
Q (Ej (i))
=
m if Ej (i) ∈ ∆j(m), m = 1, 2, ..., 2Nb(12)
where ∆j (m) = [BEj (m) , BEj (m + 1)).
At the FC, all quantization levels received from CUs will
be combined to make a global decision concerning about the
presence or absence of the PU signal by using equal gain
combination rule (EGC) as
{ G (i) = 1, if ∑
j
uj (i) ≥ λ
G (i) = 0, if otherwise
(13)
where λ is the threshold for global decision.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
We consider a CR network with N = 20 CUs, in which all
CUs have the same SNR = −15dB. As references, sensing
performances of following CSS scheme are provided: EGC
with raw sensing information (denoted as EGC-raw data),
EGC with the proposed quantization scheme (denoted as
EGC-the proposed scheme) and EGC with the uniform quan-
tization scheme (denoted as EGC-uniform quantization).
Fig. 3 illustrates the ROC curves of the proposed scheme
and the considered comparison schemes. The ﬁgure shows
that EGC-the proposed scheme with 3bits can obtain the
similar sensing performance to EGC-raw data. On the other

hand, EGC-uniform quantization needs 4 bits to achieve the
similar performance.
Fig. 4 shows the minimum probability of error of the
proposed scheme and above reference schemes, where prob-
ability of error is deﬁned as:
Pe (λ) = Pf (λ) Pr (H0) + Pm (λ) Pr (H1)
(14)
where Pf(λ) and Pm(λ) are probability of false alarm
and probability of miss detection of the global decision,
respectively. Since Pf(λ) and Pm(λ) are function of λ,
Pe(λ) is also a function of λ. We deﬁne λopt as the optimal
threshold at the FC with which probability of error of global
decision is minimized. Subsequently, minimum probability
of error can be given as Pe. min = Pe (λopt). Fig. 4 shows the
effect of the quantization bits on the minimum probability
of error. From Fig. 4, we can observe that the EGC-the
proposed scheme can achieve same performance to that of
EGC-raw data with more than 3 quantization bits while the
EGC-uniform quantization requires more than 4 quantization
bits to achieve same performance.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a quantization scheme
based on KL-divergence for cooperative spectrum sensing in
CR network. The proposed scheme can reduce the necessary
quantization bits comparison with the uniform quantization
scheme while still keeping the same sensing performance
with the raw data.
