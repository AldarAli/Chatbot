Abstract
We propose a home context-aware system which has a
mechanism for personalization of service activation and
context estimation.
Personalization of service activation
is to realize service activation along user intention. The
proposed system can activate a variety of services along
user intention by combining a system-active approach and a
user-active approach. Because users choose activated ser-
vices ﬁnally, the system can activate services even along
user intention which cannot be inferred by computers. Per-
sonalization of context estimation is to realize setting values
appropriate for each user to parameters used for context es-
timation in a system-active approach. The proposed system
determines values appropriate for each user by utilizing sta-
tistical data of test users whose characteristics are similar
to each user. Determination of individual values enables
stabler context estimation than context estimation with val-
ues common to all users.

1. Introduction
People would make mistakes in daily activities in homes.
They sometimes leave their homes without closing windows
and turning off an air conditioner. They go to bed without
locking the front door. We are developing a home context-
aware system which provides services to prevent users from
facing dangers of making mistakes in homes and to make
their life more comfortable. Before the users leave their
homes, our system can warn them to lock windows and to
turn off the air conditioner. The system can also lock win-
dows and turn off the air conditioner instead of them. There
have been already technologies which lock doors of house
by remote control with a cell phone. However, these tech-
nologies cannot prevent dangers, because these technolo-
gies are user-active approaches and can be useful only in
a case the users get aware of their mistakes by themselves.
Moreover, it is difﬁcult for users unfamiliar with computers,
such as elderly people, to utilize their cell phones actively.
As an approach for solving these problems, there are
studies of context-aware systems which provide services ac-
cording to user context such as user behavior and user sit-
uation. Because the systems estimate user context, the sys-
tems can awaken users to something they are not aware of.
In addition, because services are provided with a system-
active approach, it can provide services to users unfamil-
iar with computers without any active operations of users
themselves. Meanwhile, it is impossible for the systems
to estimate every user context accurately. Therefore, this
approach is at risk for providing services inappropriate for
user situation because of misestimation by the systems. Ex-
isting studies of context-aware systems focus on improve-
ment of estimation accuracy of user context, but they do not
162

consider handling of inappropriate services provided based
on misestimation.
Not to make users feel dissatisﬁed, home context-aware
systems must have a mechanism for preventing inappropri-
ate service providing based on misestimation. Moreover,
the systems are expected to have a mechanism for activat-
ing a variety of services along user intention which cannot
be inferred by computers. For example, the systems can in-
fer a user leaves his home but cannot infer whether he goes
away for a long time or for a short time. If he goes away
for a long time, a service for turning off lights and air con-
ditioners is useful. If he goes away for a short time, he may
prefer a service for turning off lights but leaving air condi-
tioners as it is. In this way, there can be sometimes different
services according to detailed user intention, which cannot
be inferred, even in a scene of leaving home. Useful sys-
tems should be able to activate a variety of services, which
have different details even in a same scene, along detailed
user intention. In this paper, to realize such service activa-
tion along user intention is referred to as personalization of
service activation.
In addition, because home context-aware systems can be
introduced into a variety of users who have different charac-
teristics of behavior, context estimation methods of the sys-
tems must be stably effective for not some users but as many
users as possible. Appropriate values of parameters used as
criteria of judgment in the estimation methods vary among
users. If values common to all users are used, estimation
accuracies on some users become signiﬁcantly low. It is
preferable to determine the values of parameters individu-
ally. Values appropriate for each user can be determined by
collecting sensor data acquired according to his daily ac-
tivities for a long period and analyzing the data. However,
service providing should be early started after introducing
the systems into homes. Therefore, the values must be de-
termined with a small number of data of each user which
can be collected in a short period. In this paper, to realize
setting values appropriate for each user to parameters used
for context estimation is referred to as personalization of
context estimation.
The system we previously presented[18] considers a
mechanism for preventing inappropriate service providing,
but does not enough consider a mechanism for these person-
alization. In this paper, we propose a home context-aware
system with a mechanism for personalization of service ac-
tivation and personalization of context estimation, which
has been improved from the previous system.
In our system, short-range passive RFID tags are in-
stalled in a variety of objects such as a doorknob, a wallet,
a wristwatch, a refrigerator in homes. A unique ID is stored
in each tag. The user wears a ring-type RFID reader on
his hand. Using this RFID system, the histories of objects
touched by the user in his home are stored in a home server.
The proposed system personalizes service activation by
combining a system-active approach and a user-active ap-
proach. Services are provided in this system as follows.
First, speciﬁc user behavior is detected from kinds of
touched objects and the order of the objects. Next, with
the detection as a trigger, service candidates according to
the detected user behavior are narrowed down and they are
offered the user. At the same time, the service candidates
are respectively mapped to objects around the user. These
objects become switches for activating the offered services
temporarily. The user can choose the objects mapped with
service candidates from objects around him by himself. Fi-
nally, services are activated just by user’s touching to these
objects. In this way, the proposed system provides services
along user intention by choosing activated services with a
user-active approach from service candidates chosen with a
system-active approach.
In addition, the proposed system has a mechanism for
determining initial values of individual users for parame-
ters used in a behavior detection method as a mechanism
for personalization of context estimation in the system. The
system utilizes statistical data on test users, which are ac-
quired before introducing the system into the home of each
user. Suppose the system is introduced into a user υ. First,
a small number of data of υ is collected in a short period at
the initial stage after introducing the system. Next, the data
of υ is compared with the data of test users, based on the
concept of collaborative ﬁltering. Finally, values appropri-
ate for υ are determined from data of test users who have
characteristics similar to υ.
The proposed system which has a mechanism for person-
alization of service activation and context estimation has the
following advantages.
• By combining a system-active approach and a user-
active approach, the system can activate a variety of
services along user intention without losing an advan-
tage that the system can awaken users to something
they are not aware of.
• Determination of individual initial values for param-
eters in the detection method enables stable behavior
detection by improving detection accuracies of users
whose detection accuracies are low with values com-
mon to all users.
The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents problems on personalization of service
activation, and Section 3 presents problems on personaliza-
tion of context estimation in the proposed system. Section 4
shows the proposed system has a mechanism for personal-
ization of service activation, with the ﬂow of service pro-
viding in the system.
Section 5 describes a method for
determining individual values of parameters in the behav-
ior detection method as a mechanism for personalization

of context estimation in our system. Section 6 presents an
experimental life space where the proposed system is im-
plemented. In Section 7, we evaluate the usability of the
touch-to-object interface for service activation to consider
the possibility of a user-active approach which is a core
of personalization of service activation. In Section 8, we
evaluate accuracy of behavior detection and personalization
of context estimation with the proposed system. Section 9
presents challenges for improvement of our system. Finally,
we conclude this paper.
2. Problems on Service Activation
2.1. User’s Final Decision of Services
The system for supporting daily life is required not to
take actions which are against user intention because such
actions make discontent. Therefore, it is necessary to im-
prove the accuracy of context estimation for reducing inap-
propriate services caused by false estimation. However, it is
practically difﬁcult to achieve 100 percent accurate estima-
tion along user intention at any given time with computers.
Reducing inappropriate services is possible but it is impos-
sible to eliminate such services completely. For example,
suppose the system provides a service for turning off lights
which a user forgets to turn off before he leaves his home.
In a case he goes away for a long time, he wants to turn
off lights. But in the case he goes away for a short time or a
case a housemate is in his home, he may not want to turn off
lights. It is not easy to discriminate such cases whose de-
tails are different. To provide services which are along user
intention even in such cases, it is preferable that the user
ﬁnally decides whether or not services should be activated.
At the same time, the interface he uses to decide whether he
activates services or not must not be complicated. It must be
simple and costless so that users unfamiliar with computers
can use intuitively without being conscious of computers.
2.2. Service Activation on the Spot
The interface which users use to decide activated ser-
vices should be available regardless of user position. Sup-
pose the system warns a user that lights in the living room
are still on, after putting on his shoes on the front door when
leaving his home. It is annoying for the user to go back to
the living room, where a home server is located, to send a
command for activating a service which turns off the lights
to the system. He may rather turn off the lights directly
by himself in the living room than activate the service after
moving from the front door to the living room. The useful-
ness of the system which can be used only on a speciﬁed
place is low. Users should be able to activate services on
the spot according to their position.
2.3. Related Works on Service Activation
There are studies of easy-to-use interfaces to activate ser-
vices with operation of users themselves without automatic
activation of systems according to user context.
Nichols et al. have improved the interface of a cell phone
used for remote control of home appliances [10]. However,
it is difﬁcult for users unfamiliar with computers to oper-
ate a cell phone. Tsukada et al. propose remote operation
with ﬁnger gesture [16]. Although this interface does not
make users conscious of computers, users may waste a long
time to learn how to operate it because it is not intuitive.
Riekki et al. propose an interface for activating services
with RFID tags attached by symbol images, with which
users can intuitively know the content of activated services
[14]. However, users cannot activate services without mov-
ing to speciﬁed places to touch speciﬁed tags, because tags
are ﬁxed on speciﬁed places and services are ﬁxed on the
tags. In addition, although technologies of speech recog-
nition are studied as an interface to activate services with
speech of users [4], the technologies are not enough practi-
cal at present. More comfortable interfaces are necessary to
activate services by users themselves.
3. Problems on Behavior Detection
3.1. Complexity of User Behavior
We address behaviors which can be triggers to provide
services as user behavior in this paper. They are detected
by observing a sequence of habitual activities of individual
user. Suppose the user brushes his teeth, goes to the toilet,
picks up a wallet, wears a wristwatch and opens the front
door in order. By observing such a sequence of some ha-
bitual activities which are taken before leaving home, his
leaving home can be detected. Suppose he opens the front
door. It is difﬁcult to judge whether he leaves his home only
from one activity. He may go out for picking up a newspa-
per. Similarly in another example, his getting up can be
detected by observing a sequence of activities taken right
after getting up, such as he goes out of bed, stops an alarm
clock, turns on lights and drinks water from the faucet. Note
that kinds of habitual activities and habitual order of them
depend on individual user.
The user does not always take same activities in same
order every time. In the observed sequence of user activi-
ties, habitual order relation and non-habitual order relation
are mixed. For example, before leaving home, there can
be habitual order from “going to the toilet” to “picking up a
wallet” and from “picking up a wallet” to “opening the front
door” but there may be no habitual order relation between
“picking up a wallet” and “wearing a wristwatch”. In addi-
tion, sometimes rare activities such as “picking up an um-
164
International Journal On Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

brella” in a rainy day are inserted into the activity sequence.
By contraries, part of habitual activities may be also some-
times omitted. From such a complex sequence, it is nec-
essary to extract characteristic kinds and order which rep-
resent individual habits indicating user behavior to achieve
behavior detection.
Some existing studies propose methods for recognizing
user motion such as “walking” and “standing up”[2, 9].
Other studies propose methods for recognizing simple ac-
tivities such as “brushing teeth”, whose characteristics are
similar among users[12, 13, 17]. User behaviors as triggers
of service providing, such as “leaving home”, need to be
detected by observing a sequence of such activities. Logan
et al.[8] and Hu`ynh et al.[5] study methods for recogniz-
ing behaviors such as “leaving home” called as high-level
activities. Basically, these existing methods aim to achieve
classiﬁcation or labeling of activities to identify user activ-
ity on a certain period of time. Compared with these, behav-
iors in this paper are not recognized but should be detected
as triggers of service providing. Because the behavior han-
dling considered in this paper is handling which is reactive
to user behavior, it is a different target from existing meth-
ods.
3.2. Deadline for Providing Services
Some services have deﬁnite deadlines of providing them,
while others have no deﬁnite deadline of providing them.
Examples of the former are services provided when the
user leaves his home or he goes to bed.
Suppose he is
warned that he does not have wallet after he leaves his
home. He must go back to inside his house to pick up his
wallet. The value of the service provided after leaving home
is signiﬁcantly lower than that before his leaving. The dead-
line of providing services is the instant the user goes out of
his house through the front door. Similarly, suppose the user
is warned that the front door is not locked when he goes to
bed. The deadline of such services provided on going to bed
is the instant he goes sleep in his bed. To provide high value
services for the user, his behaviors such as leaving home and
going to bed must be detected before the deadline.
Examples of the latter are reminder services provided
when the user gets up or comes home. Suppose the service,
which reminds him one day schedule and what to do on the
day, is provided with detection of his getting up as a trigger.
Such service can prevent his mistakes. Such reminder ser-
vices triggered by detection of getting up or coming home
have no deﬁnite deadline of providing them, nonetheless it
is preferable to provide the services within the time the user
is doing a series of activities right after getting up or coming
home.
Behaviors which can be triggers of service providing
must be detected before the deadlines of services.
3.3. Template Matching
In home context-aware systems, data of user behavior
is acquired online from sensors. This paper refers to the
sensor data as behavior log. Generally, behavior of a user
is inferred by template matching with behavior logs. The
ﬂow of template matching is as follows.
1. A certain amount of behavior logs of the user are col-
lected.
2. A template which represents characteristics of user be-
havior is created by statistical analysis of the collected
behavior logs.
The behavior logs used for creating
the template are referred to as sample behavior logs.
The created template is referred to as a matching
template.
3. User behavior is inferred by checking the degree
of conformity when matching current behavior logs,
which are acquired online from sensors, with the
matching template.
Matching is repeated at some
kind of speciﬁed timing. The behavior logs which are
matched with the matching template is referred to as
match-target behavior logs.
In our system, user behavior is detected based on tem-
plate matching. The system cannot detect user behavior
until the matching template is created after introducing the
system into homes. That means users are not provided ser-
vices. If it takes a long time to create the matching template,
users are dissatisﬁed with waiting for a long time until the
start of service providing. Sample behavior logs of indi-
vidual user need to be collected in a short period to start
providing services early. That is, the system should create
an initial matching template with a small number of individ-
ual sample behavior logs which can be collected in a short
period to be accepted by users.
Behavior logs are classiﬁed into two types to a matching
template. There are true cases and false cases. Suppose
there is a matching template to detect a behavior of leaving
home. True cases are behavior logs in scenes where a user is
leaving home. False cases are behavior logs in other scenes.
3.4. Setting of Initial Threshold Values
Some parameters should be determined appropriately in
a method for behavior detection to achieve high detection
accuracy. In particular, the following two threshold values
have an impact on the detection accuracy. One is a threshold
value used for creating a matching template. The threshold
value is used to extract characteristics from the results of
statistical analysis on sample behavior logs. If an inappro-
priate value is set to the threshold, the system cannot extract
appropriate characteristics for accurate detection. The other
165
International Journal On Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

one is a threshold value used for matching match-target be-
havior logs with matching templates. The threshold value
deﬁnes threshold of the degree of conformity between them.
If the degree of conformity is more than the threshold value,
the logs are regarded as conformable logs to the matching
template. If an inappropriate value is set to the threshold,
the system cannot successfully detect user behavior to be
detected or mistakenly detect user behavior not to be de-
tected.
Because kinds of habitual activities and order of them
vary with users, appropriate values depend on user behav-
ior. Therefore, threshold values are preferable to be individ-
ually determined for each user. If the values are determined
after many individual behavior logs are collected, appropri-
ate values are found by simulating template matching with
the collected behavior logs. However, the system can use
only a small number of individual sample behavior logs to
determine initial threshold values because service provid-
ing should be early started after introducing the system into
homes. It is difﬁcult to determine threshold values appropri-
ate for individual user only with a small number of sample
behavior logs. In addition, it is preferable to utilize both
true cases and false cases to determine appropriate values.
False cases from which true cases are hardly distinguished
are particularly required. Even true cases are small when
initial threshold values should be determined. It is impossi-
ble to use enough false cases useful for determining appro-
priate threshold values.
In a basic determination method, developers of a system
or experts of the system determine the initial values com-
mon to all users before introducing the system into homes
without sample behavior logs of individual users, because it
is difﬁcult to determine initial threshold values only with a
small number of individual sample behavior logs. The de-
termination method uses data of test users to determine the
common values. Having a system used by some test users
on a trial basis, many sample behavior logs of individual test
users are collected. These logs include both true cases and
false cases. By simulating template matching with the logs
individually, the experts analyze relativity between change
of detection accuracy and changes in threshold values. Fi-
nally, common threshold values are determined so that de-
tection accuracy is averagely high for test users. The values
are used as initial threshold values common to all users af-
ter introduction of the system. However, because there are
some users whose appropriate threshold values are differ-
ent from the common threshold values, detection accuracy
varies with users. Common threshold values cannot achieve
high detection accuracy for some users.
It is necessary to improve detection accuracy of some
users whose detection accuracy is low with common thresh-
old values, by determining appropriate initial threshold val-
ues.
3.5. Related Works on Setting Threshold
There are several approaches to determine appropriate
threshold values in a variety of ﬁelds. In image processing,
a determination method of a threshold used for extracting
a speciﬁc area from a target image has been proposed [6].
This method can be used only if both parts to be extracted
and parts not to be extracted exist together in a recogni-
tion target. The issue of behavior detection does not meet
such a condition, because behavior detection in this paper
considers whether a match-target behavior log conforms to
a matching template or not. This approach in image pro-
cessing cannot be applied to the issue. In other approaches,
Support Vector Machines and boosting have been used for
text categorization [3, 15], and Hidden Markov Model is
used for speech and gesture recognition [1, 11]. These ap-
proaches can determine appropriate threshold values under
the assumption that the approaches can collect and analyze
many samples of a recognition target or many samples of
others which have similar characteristics to samples of the
recognition target instead. However, initial threshold values
must be determined under the constraint of a small number
of sample behavior logs for creating a matching template. In
addition, because characteristics of user behavior in homes
are different among individual users, behavior logs of other
people other than a user cannot be used as sample behavior
logs of the user. Although these approaches can be used for
learning appropriate threshold values after many personal
behavior logs have been collected, these approaches cannot
be used for determining initial threshold values appropriate
for individuals.
In a ﬁeld of behavior recognition, most existing studies
do not discuss how to determine initial threshold values.
They use given values or values which are determined by
analyzing many behavior logs.
4. Personalization of Service Activation
4.1. System Overview
Figure 1 shows an overview of the proposed system.
This system is composed of RFID-tagged objects, a wear-
able RFID reader and a home server. The RFID reader reads
tag-IDs of objects and sends tag-IDs to the server every time
the user touches each object. In the server, the histories of
touched objects are stored as behavior logs. After introduc-
ing the system into individual home, a certain time period
is used for collecting behavior logs of individual user. Ser-
vices are not provided while that period.
With the collected behavior logs as sample behavior
logs, the Matching Template Creator creates matching tem-
plates which represent characteristics of user behavior. A
matching template is created for every behavior such as
leaving home and going to bed. For example, in a case

of leaving home, the system shows only behavior logs in
which the user touched objects of great relevance to leav-
ing home such as doorknob of the front door and let him
select behavior logs of true leaving home. Therefore, the
system can exactly use behavior logs of leaving home to
create a matching template representing characteristics of
leaving home adequately.
After creating matching templates of each behavior, the
system starts providing services. First, the Behavior Detec-
tor detects behaviors of triggers by matching behavior logs
acquired online according to user activities with matching
templates every time the user touches something. The Be-
havior Detector informs the Situation Checker of detected
behaviors.
In this system, we refer to a set of conditions to provide
services as a situation. A situation σ is deﬁned as follows.
σ = {b, p, e1, e2, ..., ei, ..., q1, q2, ..., qi, ...}
Here, b is a user behavior to be detected, such as leaving
home. p is the user position. ei denotes the state of an
object i which exists in the home, such as “the front door
is locked.” The variety of the states depends on kinds of
sensors combinated to our system. qi denotes the position of
the object i, such as “a wallet is in the bedroom.” A variety
of situations are deﬁned in the situation configuration
table.
Referring to the situation conﬁguration table, the Situ-
ation Checker checks whether any situations are happen-
ing or not.
For example, this means even if the system
detects the behavior of going to bed when the front door
is already locked, a service for warning of unlocked front
door is not provided. The states of conditions except user
behavior b are always recognized by the Area Concierge
which manages and controls sensors and actuators in coop-
eration with a home-network. The Area Concierge informs
the Situation Checker of changes of the states.
If there
are situations which are happening, the Situation Checker
searches services appropriate for the situations by referring

To dynamically determine apprppriate threshold values
for individuals, it is preferrable to acquire knowledge from
personal behavior logs of the target user. However, it is
difﬁcult to determine appropriate values only with a small
number of personal behavior logs.
Considering the similarity between the target user and
each test user, our determination method determines thresh-
old values of the target user, based on the data of test users
whose characteristics are similar to characteristics of the
target user. To calculate the similarity between the target
user and each test user, the method focuses on the average
number of ordered pairs composing matching templates of
each user. Values of the extraction threshold and the detec-
tion threshold are determined by estimating a position of the
target user on a feature space, which is composed of behav-
ior detection accuracies and the average number of ordered
pairs on every test user, based on an idea of collaborative ﬁl-
tering. As shown in Figure 8, ﬁrst, our method takes statis-
tics on the average number of ordered pairs of each test user
and detection accuracy before introduction of the system.
A feature space of this statistical data corresponds to the
rule for determinating threshold values. After that, values
of two thresholds are determined at the same time by exe-
cuting collaborative ﬁltering with the statistical data and a
small number of personal behavior logs of the target user
when a matching template is created after introducing the
system into the home of the target user.
5.2. Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative ﬁltering is a process for automatically es-
timating unknown information of a target user with some
known information of him and known information of other
users. Here, the informations mean features such as ten-
dency and taste. They have to be able to be collected with
a form which can be expressed on the numeric axes. First,
the similarity between the target user and each other user is
calculated with known information on both the users. Next,
unknown information is estimated using known information
of other users who are similar to the target user. This esti-
mation is utilized for recommendation or personalization,
as used in Amazon.com [7].
Our determination method calculates the similarity be-
tween the target user and each test user on a feature of the
average number of ordered pairs composing matching tem-
plates and estimates behavior detection accuracy of the tar-
get user by utilizing statistical data on detection accuracy
of test users on every setting of thresholds. The estimation
enables to determine threshold values with which detection
accuracy is the high.
5.3. Estimation of Initial Threshold Values
With an example of a matching template of leaving home
of a target user υ, this section describes how to determine
threshold values with collaborative ﬁltering. At the devel-
opment phase, the following steps are executed to calculate
detection accuracy of each test user on every setting of two
thresholds. Here, w is a given value common to all users.
1. Collect behavior logs of leaving home as true cases
and also behavior logs other than leaving home as false
cases.
2. Select w true cases as sample behavior logs and create
w matching templates with each setting of the extrac-
tion threshold value e = 1/w, 2/w, ..., w/w, using
the w true cases. Here, the number of ordered pairs
composing each matching template is recorded.
3. With all settings of the detection threshold d from 0.01
to 1.00, match all true cases and all false cases with the
w matching templates.
4. Repeat k times from step 2 to step 3, using new match-
ing templates created with a new combination of w true
cases every time.
With these steps,
true-positive rate (TPR),
true-
negative rate (TNR), and half total true rate (HTTR)
are calculated on every setting of thresholds per combina-
tion of w true cases by taking statistics on all results of the
matchings. The number of threshold settings is w×100.
Here, we explain these three rates with an example of de-
tection of leaving home. TPR means the rate which our
detection method successfully detects each subject’s leav-
ing home by the deadline, when matching behavior logs of
leaving home with matching templates of leaving home. On
the other hand, TNR means the rate which the detection
method does not detect their leaving home, when matching
behavior logs except leaving home with matching templates
of leaving home. It is desirable that both TPR and TNR are
high. HTTR is an average of TPR and TNR.
After the above steps, the followings are calculated.
• the averate number of ordered pairs composing k
matching templates created on each setting of the ex-
traction threshold e
• the average HTTR value on each combination of the
setting of the extraction threshold e and the setting of
the detection threshold d
These are statistical data which show characteristics of each
test user. Next, threshold values of user υ are determined
when his matching template is created, by collaborative ﬁl-
tering with the statistical data. Figure 9 shows an example

have been selected because user’s mistakes are effectively
prevented by services triggered by detection of these 4 be-
haviors.
Prior to collect behavior logs as data for the experiment,
we have had a survey questionnaire for 2 weeks to conﬁrm
that users have habitual characteristics of 4 behaviors. In
the questionnaire, subjects have described complete details
of kind of objects they touched and the order of touched ob-
jects during 10 minutes before leaving home, after coming
home, after getting up and before going to bed. We have
conﬁrmed the following things from their description.
• Some activities are interleaved in a 10 minutes se-
quence of activities.
• Subjects do not ﬁnish a sequence of activities within
10 minutes after coming home and after getting up.
Although there are no deﬁnite deadlines of providing ser-
vices after coming home and after getting up, we must de-
cide the deadlines to clear up success or failure of behav-
ior detection in experiments. In view of the above conﬁr-
mation, we have set the deadline to “10 minutes after sub-
jects open the front door and enter the house” when coming
home. Similarly, we have set the deadline to “10 minutes
after subjects get out of bed” when getting up.
As experimental data, we have collected behavior logs
of 4 behaviors in a database of a server by sensing actual
objects which 8 subjects have touched in the experimental
life space shown in Figure 10 and Figure 11. We have had
subjects touch the objects with being aware of the position

ment such as “they can be satisﬁed with the simplicity of
operation”. The points of answer mean that 1:Strongly dis-
agree, 2:Disagree, 3:Neither agree nor disagree, 4:Agree
and 5:Strongly agree. Figure 12 shows the average points
of all subjects. On the simple operation and the costless op-
eration, the points of “with user-selected objects” are also
shown. The points mean evaluation only in a case subjects
decide the objects mapped with service candidates.
As a result, the average points are more than 4 in respect
of simple operation, costless operation and speed. Subjects
highly valued the touch-to-object interface because they can
choose services by simply touching objects without being
conscious of computers. Comparing a case where the sys-
tem decides objects which become switches with a case
where subject decides the objects, the average points are
lower in the latter case. As a cause of this difference, there
is an opinion that it is annoying to touch objects more than
once to decide switches and to choose desirable services.
However, on the other hand, there are the following opin-
ions from most of subjects.
• If the system automatically decides the objects mapped
with service candidates, users sometimes cannot intu-
itively image the relation between services and objects.
• It is more easy-to-understand to decide the objects by
users themselves than the objects are automatically de-
cided.
These opinions indicate that the touch-to-object interface
has both advantages and disadvantages. But advantages are
more signiﬁcant for most users, because users who feel an-
noyed with touching to objects several times can make our
system choose the objects automatically. In addition, most
subjects valued the following advantage.
• Users can activate services on the spot without moving,
because service candidates are dynamically mapped to
objects around them.
• Users can comfortably accept services from the sys-
tem, because they can choose activated services with
a simple interface without leaving service choice to
computers.
Many opinions from subjects prove the touch-to-object in-
terface has high operability to actualize service activation
by users.
Although the touch-to-object interface has received high
evaluation, the average points are less than 3 in respect
of listener-friendliness of announcement and length of an-
nouncement. There is a problem that if all of detailed con-
tents which should be reported to users are announced the
length of voice announcement tends to become long. It can
be stress for users. Also, there is an opinion that if users
do not listen to the voice announcement carefully they may
miss the relation between services and objects because the
voice announcement is invisible and intangible.
In the future, we will study visualization of relation be-
tween services and objects by combinating voice announce-
ment with displaying on an information terminal to resolve
annoyance on the dynamic mapping. Display of the relation
is expected to make users understand the relation clearly. In
addition, it may be effective to report short abstract contents
with voice announcement and to display concrete contents
for reduction of user stress.
8. Accuracy of Behavior Detection
8.1. How to Calculate Detection Rates
We have conducted experiments to evaluate our method
for behavior detection with the collected data described in
section 6. In the experiment, detection accuracies of 4 be-
haviors, which are leaving home, coming home, getting up,
and going to bed, are calculated with behavior logs. De-
tection accuracies are calculated both with threshold values
common to all users and with threshold values determined
for individuals. The latter results are compared with the for-
mer results.
To calculate the accuracies, matching templates are cre-
ated with part of collected behavior logs and each matching
template is repeatedly matched with behavior logs which
are not used for creating the template. In the experiments,
the ground truth is given by subjects themselves.
Compared with 4 behaviors of our target, subjects touch
entirely-different kinds of objects in scenes such as reading
books, cooking and having a meal. Our detection method
can easily distinguish between behaviors in these scenes
and the 4 behaviors. To calculate the accuracies in the ex-
periment, behavior logs which are prone to be faultily de-
tected are adequate as false cases. Therefore, we use behav-
ior logs of a behavior as true cases from target 4 behaviors
and those of other 3 behaviors as false cases.
To verify that our detection method detects user behavior
by the deadline, we set the time length tl of sample behavior
logs and match-target behavior logs to 10 minutes in exper-
iments. Behavior logs of leaving home are logs of past 10
minutes to the time subjects touch the doorknob of the front
door. Behavior logs of going to bed are logs of past 10 min-
utes to the time subjects lie down on the bed for sleeping.
Behavior logs of coming home are logs of 10 minutes from
the time subjects touch the doorknob of the front door. Be-
havior logs of getting up are logs of 10 minutes from the
time subjects get out of bed. That is, if the conformity c
which is calculated by matching true cases with matching
templates is more than the detection threshold d, it means
right behaviors are detected by the deadline.
175
International Journal On Advances in Intelligent Systems, vol 2 no 1, year 2009, http://www.iariajournals.org/intelligent_systems/

TPR and TNR are calculated as follows. First, statistical
data of 8 subjects for collaborative ﬁltering are calculated
with their behavior logs, based on the method described in
the previous section. Next, the following steps are executed
on each subject to calculate TPR and TNR with threshold
values determined for individuals. In experiments, each of
subjects is considered as a target user and other subjects are
considered as test users.
1. Select 5 true cases and create a matching template with
the cases, based on the extraction threshold e.
2. Select other 1 true case and match the case with the
matching template.
3. Match all of false cases with the matching template,
with the detection threshold d.
4. Repeat 100 times from step 1 to step 3, using a new
matching template created with a new combination of
5 true cases every time.
Here, TPR is calculated based on cross validation. TNR
is calculated by matching all false cases with all created
matching templates. The number of sample behavior logs
for creating a matching template is set to 5, which can be
collected within a week. This is because our study assumes
that our system must start providing services to users within
a week at the latest since the beginning of use of our system.
The values of e and d are determined when each matching
template is created in step 1 by collaborative ﬁltering us-
ing statistical data of 7 subjects other than the target user
whose TPR and TNR are calculated in the above steps. In
experiments, if the number of ordered pairs are more than
300, it is calculated as 300 because more than 300 ordered
pairs are empirically too many as the number of characteris-
tics of user behavior. Because values of statistical data used
for collaborative ﬁltering must be normalized, all values are
normalized so that the values are between 0 to 300. From
the result of all matchings, TPR, TNR, and HTTR of ev-
ery subject are calculated on the case with threshold values
determined for individuals.
After that, these rates with common threshold values are
calculated by similar steps. In this case, e is ﬁxed to 0.8.
d are 0.33 in leaving home, 0.31 in coming home, 0.47 in
getting up and 0.63 in going to bed. These values have been
determined in advance so that detection accuracies are the
highest.
8.2. Detection with Common Threshold
Values
First, this section shows detection accuracies with com-
mon threshold values.

periments on behavior detection with common threshold

values[18, 19]. Table 1 shows a result of comparing de-
tection accuracies of our detection method using ordered
pairs and detection accuracies of a detection method with
matching templates represented as Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) which is often used for behavior recognition ana-
lyzing time-series patterns by existing methods. TPR and
TNR on Equal Error Rate (EER) at which difference be-
tween TPR and TNR is the smallest are respectively shown
in the table. Each rate is an average rate of all subjects.
The accuracies with ordered pairs are higher than those with
HMM. There are differences more than 10% about leaving
home. Moreover, those are more than 30% about other be-
haviors. The output probability of HMM falls remarkably
in a case that rare activities are inserted into an observed
sequence of user activities. It falls also in a case that users
change the order of part of activities in the sequence. The
differences between accuracies with ordered pairs and accu-
racies with HMM are proof of that ordered pairs are robuster
to such complex user activities than HMM.
However, detection accuracies of some users are not
enough high. Differences between common threshold val-
ues and values appropriate for each user affect on the detec-
tion accuracies. 4 tables, which are from Table 2 to Table 5,
show differences between the common value of the detec-
tion threshold and the best value of the detection threshold
for each subject. The best values are calculated by ana-
lyzing the results. The common value for each behavior is
shown in the bottom row of the tables. In addition, TPR and
TNR with the common threshold values are shown together
in the tables. Differences between common values and the
best values of each subject are not relatively big on leaving
home and coming home. On the other hand, there are more
differences of those values on getting up and going to bed.
Accordingly, detection accuracies on getting up and going
to bed are overall less than detection accuracies on leaving
home and coming home. In addition, there are differences
among the best values of subjects. Comparing detection ac-
curacies with differences between common values and the
best values of each subject in each table, it is apparent that
the more differences bring lower detection accuracies. De-
tection accuracies of subjects A, G, H in Table 4 and sub-
jects E, H in Table 5 indicate such trend signiﬁcantly. The
detection threshold value directly affects detection accuracy
of user behavior. These results show that it is important to

8.3. Detection with Individual Threshold
Values
As results of experiments, detection accuracies with
threshold values determined for individuals are shown in 4
tables, which are from Table 6 to Table 9. The tables re-
spectively show the results of leaving home, coming home,
getting up, and going to bed.
Behavior detection method must achieve high accuracy
stably for behaviors of many users. It is preferable that ac-
curacies of all users are reasonably high rather than that ac-
curacy are very high only for some users and are low for
others. As results of experiments, there are some subjects
whose TPR or TNR are lower with individual threshold val-
ues than those of common threshold values. However, de-
tection accuracies are still high on most of them. They are
more than 80%. On the other hand, there are cases where
the individual threshold values achieve higher accuracies
on some subjects whose accuracies are originally high with
common threshold values. Here, these results are not fo-
cused on. The following characteristic differences between
accuracies with individual threshold values and accuracies
with common threshold values are focused on.
• Individual threshold values achieve higher accuracies
than low accuracies which are less than 80% with com-
mon threshold values.
• Individual threshold values bring lower accuracies,
which are less than 80%, than accuracies with com-
mon threshold values.
Based on the result of the t-test, the experimental results
are evaluated with the idea that difference of more than 5%
is a statistically-signiﬁcant difference between accuracies
with individual threshold values and accuracies with com-
mon threshold values.
In tables, the differences are shown in parenthesis of
each value of TPR and TNR, except the differences which
are less than a statistically-signiﬁcant difference. Positive
values mean that individual threshold values have increased
detection accuracies.
TPR and TNR with the common
threshold values are shown in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and

Table 5. Results are categorized into three groups, #1, #2
and #3. Individual threshold values have achieved higher
accuracies in 6 cases of #1. In particular, on TPRs of sub-
ject E and H in Table 9, the individual values have improved
them +20 and +12 respectively. While, accuracies are lower
than that with common threshold values only in 2 cases of
#2, which are subject G in Table 8 and subject B in Table
9. In 2 cases of #3, TPR is higher but TNR is lower with
individual threshold values. Our determination method is
not necessarily effective on these cases. These experimental
results show our method can improve detection accuracies
of users whose detection accuracies are low with common
threshold values, by setting appropriate values to thresholds
for individuals.
Because of a property of collaborative ﬁltering, if there
is no test user who has strong correlation with the target
user at all then the values of the target user are not accu-
rately estimated. It can be a cause of ineffectiveness of our
determination method in a few cases.
An additional experiment, which uses all of 8 subjects
including an estimated target subject as test users for col-
laborative ﬁltering, has been conducted. It means that test
users include a test user who has likely strong correlation
with the target user. The experimental results are shown
in Table 10, Table 11, Table 12, and Table 13. As a re-
sult, compared to the former experiment, improvement of
detection accuracy has been shown in 3 cases. First, TPR of
subject C in Table 10 has been improved without decreas-
ing TNR. The difference on TNR of subject G in Table 12
changes from -8.62 to +5.62. In addition, TPR of subject
H in Table 13 is improved from +12 to +23. These results
indicate that our determination method have a possibility to
improve detection accuracy of more users. With these re-
sults in mind, to solve above problems, it is important to
prepare test users who has strong correlation with the target
user by increasing the number of test users and the diversity
of test users. To make diverseness of test users, a method
for making additional test users artiﬁcially is necessary.
9. Challenges for Improvement
Our system can be improved more in the future as fol-
lows to personalize the system depending on each user.

mapping table and the concrete-to-abstract conversion rules
are predeﬁned in this system. General contents common to
all users are described in these. However, they are not al-
ways appropriate for all users. The rules can be redeﬁned,
but it is not easy for users unfamiliar with computers to cus-
tomize these by themselves at present. We must build a
method for customizing these easily without complex oper-
ation.
This system uses passive RFID system to develop with
as few types of sensors and low-cost sensors as possible at
present. Later, we will study the possibility of a variety of
applications by adding other sensors to this system. For ex-
ample, we need to add reasonable sensors which achieve ac-
quiring the position information of users and objects more
precisely. Checking usefulness and cost of a variety of sen-
sors, we will consider personalization of conﬁguration of
sensors combined with our system according to user’s bud-
get.
Currently, we have implemented a behavior detection
which is appropriate for an application to prevent mistakes
and dangers of users. If we implement other behavior detec-
tion for different applications in the future, we can extend
our system by adding new modules into Matching Template
Creator and Behavior Detector. The extentensibility enables
our system to personalize kinds of applications depending
on each user.
10. Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a home context-aware
system which has a mechanism for personalization of ser-
vice activation and personalization of context estimation.
The system provides services by combining a system-active
approach and a user-active approach. Because users them-
selves ﬁnally choose activated services with a touch-to-
object interface in a user-active approach, the system can
activate a variety of services also along user intention which
cannot be inferred with computers. In a system-active ap-
proach, user behavior is detected as a trigger of service pro-
viding. The system determine threshold values appropriate

for each user in the detection method by utilizing statistical
data of test users whose characteristics are similar to each
user. The determination enables stable behavior detection.
In experiments, we have demonstrated the high possibility
of the proposed system.
