Abstract—A new nonstandard method of comparison of de-
oxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences called by us 2D-dynamic
Representation of DNA Sequences is presented. This approach
is based on a method known in the literature as Nandy plots
but in the present method the degeneracy (non-uniqueness) of
the Nandy plots has been removed. 2D-dynamic Representation
is computationally not demanding and there are no limitations
on the lengths of the DNA sequences. Using this method, one can
compare DNA sequences both graphically and numerically.
Keywords–Bioinformatics; Alignment-free methods; Descrip-

INTRODUCTION
A variety of problems in bioinformatics is large and new
approaches are still constructed. Molecular biology is a young
area. Its beginning may be dated to 1953 when Watson and
Crick discovered the structure of DNA [1]. In 1995 the genome
of bacteria Haemophilus inﬂuenzae has been sequenced for the
ﬁrst time [2]. The project on human genome Human Genome
Project has been ﬁnished in 2003. According to the data in
2013, the database GenBank contains the nucleotide sequences
coming from 260 000 described species [3]. The increase of
the amount of information available in databases stimulated
the development of bioinformatical methods.
Graphical representations of DNA sequences constitute
both numerical and graphical tools for similarity/dissimilarity
analysis of DNA sequences. They belong to the class of
approaches known in the literature as alignment-free methods.
Examples of these kind of methods may be found in [4]–[24]
(for reviews see [25] [26]). These methods can be applied
for solving a large class of problems in biology and medical
sciences that require such an analysis. One of such approaches
has been introduced by us and we call it 2D-dynamic repre-
sentation of DNA sequences [27]–[31].

METHOD AND RESULTS
2D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences is based on
shifts in a two-dimensional space [27]. The DNA sequence
is represented by material points with different masses in a
two-dimensional space. This method is an improvement of
Nandy plots [6], in which particular bases are represented
by two orthogonal pairs of colinear basis vectors. Such a
choice of the vectors leads to the possibility of shifts back
and forth along the same trace. The so called repetitive walks

lead to degeneracy: different sequences may be represented
by the same graphs. In order to remove the degeneracy, points
with masses which are a multiplicity of the unit mass have
been introduced. After a unit shift, a point with unit mass is
localized. If the ends of the vectors during the shifts coincide,
then the mass of this point increases accordingly. In order to
compare the DNA sequences numerically, we have proposed
several numerical characteristics (called descriptors in the
theory of molecular similarity) of the 2D-dynamic graphs [28]–
[30]. We have shown that our numerical approach allows for
the classiﬁcation of the DNA sequences [31]. 2D-dynamic
representation of DNA sequences is also a good graphical tool
for sequence comparison. Examples of 2D-dynamic graphs of
the whole genomes of the Zika virus are shown in Fig. 1
(HQ234500 Nigeria 1968) and in Fig. 2 (KU312312 Suriname
2015). The shapes and the details of the 2D-dynamic graphs
give the information about the DNA sequences.

CONCLUSION
2D-dynamic representation of DNA sequences is both
graphical and numerical tool for similarity/dissimilarity analy-

sis of DNA sequences. It can be applied to all problems in
biology and medicine, which require such an analysis. An
example of an application of 2D-dynamic representation of
DNA sequences may be found in our recent work [32]. We
have shown that a mutation of the Zika virus genome can be
described both graphically, and numerically using for example
the so called centers of mass of the 2D-dynamic graphs:
µx =

where xi, yi are the coordinates of the mass mi in the 2D-
dynamic graph. Some other descriptors of the 2D-dynamic
graphs will be also applied for characterizing the Zika virus
genome in a subsequent article.
