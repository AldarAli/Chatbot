Abstract – The paper deals with a gas sensing device based 
on Vanadium oxide (V2O5)/ Porous Si (PS) /Si structure 
used to detect Ethanol gas at different concentration. The 
V2O5 thin films were deposited on   porous silicon by the 
sol-gel (Dip-coating) technique. The Vanadium oxide has 
been produced from vanadium alcoxide precursor. Current-
voltage and admittance characterizations show that the 
sensor characteristics are modified in the presence of gases. 
Conductance measurements at low frequencies indicate the 
presence of interface states.  
 
Keywords- vanadium oxide; porous silicon; gas sensor. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
During the two last decades, the interest in environment 
issues, particularly in pollution, has become a major key 
factor in the industrial development. Recently, immense 
efforts have been done in the development of sensing 
devices based on porous silicon (PS) [1, 2]. Because of its 
high reactivity and high specific surface (200-600 m2/cm3), 
porous silicon has been shown to be an interesting base 
material for gas sensing application [3, 4]. Porous silicon 
has been found highly sensitive against organic vapours 
such as methanol, ethane, propane or ethanol and acetone 
[3, 5-8]. However, PS-based sensors showed a relatively 
long response time, and a degradation of the structure due to 
porous silicon surface oxidation .Many recent efforts that 
are devoted to materials exploration for better sensor 
performance have appeared. 
Metal oxides have been widely exploited as 
sensing elements in semiconductor gas sensors, because 
they provide featured active sites to adsorb gas molecules 
and catalyze reactions. Their surface states and chemical 
reducibility favor gas sensor operation at low temperatures.   
Presently, only transition-metal oxides with d0 or d10 
electronic configurations (e.g., SnO2 and ZnO with d10; TiO2 
and V2O5 with d0) find their real gas sensor application 
[9].Vanadium oxides have attracted attention because of 
their potential applications as chemical sensors and as the 
active components of various electrical and optical devices 
[10]. Thin films of vanadium oxides for ethanol sensor 
applications with the best sensitivity and selectivity were 
been prepared by several authors [11, 12]; however, the 
mechanism sensing is not yet fully understood. 
In the present work, we will present current-voltage, 
capacitance and conductance results of a gas sensing device 
based on Vanadium oxide (V2O5)/Porous Si (PS) /Si 
structure subjected to ethanol vapor. 
 
II.  EXPERIMENTAL 
Porous silicon (PS) was obtained by electrochemical etching 
of p-type silicon wafer (450 µm thickness, 1 - 10 Ωcm 
resistivity). The etching solution was prepared by adding         
50 vol. % of ethanol to 50 vol.% of  HF aqueous solution 
(49 wt. %).Current density and etching time were varied to 
obtain porosity ranging from 40 to 75% and thickness of PS 
layer 2 - 15 µm, respectively. Nanostructured vanadium 
pentoxide films deposited on PS surface were prepared by 
mixing vanadium (V) oxytriisopropoxide (VO(OPri)3) 
(Sigma Aldrich) with isopropanol (PriOH))  in presence of 
acetylacetate. The obtained gel was deposited by dip coating 
technique and dried in air at room temperature.  
Current-voltage and impedance spectroscopy are 
employed for electrical characterizations of the sensor in a 
controlled gas environment.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
III.1 Current-voltage characteristics 
The current-voltage (I-V) characteristic of V2O5/PS/Si 
structure, shown in Figure 2, was measured in air 
environment and ethanol vapor environment. The current 
response of the devices shows generally that for bias 
potential values less than 1 V, an ideality factor of 1.72 is 
calculated. The value of the ideality factor n as obtained 
here could indicate that the current transport mechanism 
consists of both the trap-assisted tunneling and the 
thermionic emission [13, 14].

concentration of 160 ppm. 
 
 
A rectifying behavior is also observed when the ethanol 
vapor is in contact with the structure with no change in the 
shape of current-voltage curve, only a change in current 
magnitude at fixed potential in observed. 
 
 
III.2 Capacitance and conductance measurements 
The current-voltage characteristic does not provide 
sufficient information to model the device operation. 
Complementary information’s can be  obtained from the 
small signal impedance measurements . The measurements 
were made as a function of frequency in the range 1 Hz - 
100 kHz. 
Figure 3a which gives the variations of the capacitance 
versus bias (C-V) at constant frequency of 1 kHz shows that 
it 
behaves 
as 
Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor 
(MIS) 
structures as observed by several authors for Al/PS/Si 
structure [15]. The capacitance decreases monotically and 
stabilizes at potential values lower than -1 V. When the gas 
is in contact with the ethanol vapor a large variation of the 
capacitance is observed, as shown in Figure 3b. For 
structure biased negatively C decreases monotically with 
bias voltage.

Figure 4 shows the dependence of the conductance on

vapor onto sensitive V2O5/PS surface causes, here again, 
changes in the conductance measurement. The conductance 
variations were seen to increase monotically with negative

bias voltage when the gas is in contact with the device, the 
conductance value decreases with bias voltage. However a 
change in the variation shape of the conductance has been 
observed at low frequencies between 10 and 100 Hz, as 
shown in Figure 5, where it shows that in the potential range 
(0 - -1.5 V) the conductance presents a large “cavity” 
centered at about - 0.4  V.

This behavior could be related to the presence of interface 
states distributed in this bias potential range. This statement 
is confirmed by contacting the structure with the gas 
ethanol. In this case the interface states are filled with 
charges due to adsorption of ethanol vapor. In principle the 
evaluation of an interface density of states can be obtained 
from the dependence of the conductance G, divided by the 
frequency: G/ω as a function of w. From the G/ω curve it is 
easy to calculate the density of the interface state [15, 16]. 
The capacitance and conductance as a function of frequency 
at a bias potential of -1 V are shown in Figure 6. It is shown 
that the capacitance is higher for very low frequencies then 
decreases monotically to low values for higher frequencies 
(Figure 6a).

The conductance is seen to increase linearly in the 
range 1 Hz to 1 kHz then tend to stabilize for higher 
frequency values (Figure 6b).  It is clear that more results 
are needed in order to understand this behavior and 
elaborate an equivalent electrical circuit of the structure. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this work, we reported on the deposition of vanadium 
oxide on porous silicon and the application of V2O5/PS/Si as 
structure 
for 
ethanol 
vapor 
sensing. 
Capacitance, 
conductance and current-voltage measurements show that 
the device response is modified by the ethanol vapor on the 
V2O5/PS surface. The results of impedance measurements at 
low frequency clearly demonstrate the presence of interface 
states at -0.4V.
