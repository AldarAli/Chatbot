Abstract—This research aims to investigate the impact of 
specific factors on user's travel purchase intention and attitude 
in Social Media. Data collected from Social Media users to 
measure the relationship between the above factors of Social 
Media and user attitude on travel purchase intention with the 
Structural Equation Model. The primary purpose of the 
research is to explore whether the following Social Media 
factors are positively related to user attitude and travel 
purchase intention. The factors are source credibility, 
information reliability, user pleasure, and perceived value in 
travel services information. The findings of the research showed 
that there is a positive relationship between pleasure, attitude, 
and travel purchase intention, a positive relationship between 
reliability and customer attitude, and a positive relationship 
between perceived value and travel purchase intention. We also 
found that there is no relationship among credibility, user 
attitude, and travel purchase intention and an additional factor 
concerning atmospherics, positively affecting the perceived 
value and user pleasure. Finally, we found that customer 
attitude plays a vital role in mediating the relationship between 
credibility, pleasure, reliability, value, and travelers’ purchase 
intention.

 INTRODUCTION 
 The impact of social media on user's travel purchase 
intention through advertising from tour operators, social 
friends, and influencers, is more than ever timely [1][2]. 
Social Media (SM) users outran 2.70 billion in 2019, 
globally. Facebook was the most popular social network, 
with 2.38 billion active users per month in the first quarter of 
2019. In 2018, daily Internet users spent 136 minutes on 
Social Media. In 2019, 96 percent of the active Facebook 
users per month, accessed via mobile devices [3]. 
Currently, Information Technology has reinforced Social 
Media, and the words "connecting" and "exchanging" have 
been replaced by the words “searching” and “selling” [4]–[6]. 
Tourist industry and hospitality has also become an essential 
tool for accessing different sources of tourism [5][6]. Users 
trust the Internet to obtain information. Studies have shown 
that usefulness and loyalty play a decisive role in user 
behavior, as far as understanding the information is 
concerned. Also, the usability of travel services has a positive 
influence on the consumer's loyalty and integrity [9]. The 
Internet has conquered the travel industry. Younger 
generations, especially Gen Y, are much more active in 
planning trips; they send and receive information via a 
variety of sources, including mobile devices (e.g., videos, 
Social Media). They make online reservations and plan 
potential destinations to visit. Users seek to be part of a wide 
range of travel experiences, and they are more responsive to 
online advertising. Social Media and mobile devices support 
these new ways of expression. 
The purpose of the research is to study the interaction of 
the characteristics of source reliability, information 
reliability, perceived value, and user pleasure to purchase 
travel services. We are investigating the effect of source 
credibility features, information credibility, perceived value, 
and user pleasure, while browsing on social media to 
understand the attitude of the user when searching for travel 
destinations. 
The paper is structured as follows: Section II presents the 
research background. Section III presents the research 
methodology and hypotheses. Section IV contains the 
conclusion of our research study.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND 
Today SM networks, like Facebook and Instagram, allow 
people from different locations to interact and develop 
relationships or share travel experiences (e.g., posting photos 
and videos, sharing context) [10]. This information can be 
beneficial to potential travelers and can be personalized [11]. 
Most users install SM apps on their smart devices, and 
they use it as a tool for finding more travel information, with 
search engines providing direct access [12]. Researchers, 
[13] found that purchase intention is one dimension of 
customer behavior. Behavior is assessed through purchase 
intention, and consumers' behavioral patterns are examined 
[14]. Behavior is correlated to purchase intention [11][12], 
and this relationship has been empirically tested on the tourist 
industry [13][14], showing that customers’ information 
reliability and satisfaction constitute an essential factor of e-
behavioral intentions. Website design and information 
quality are essential for user satisfaction. There are many 
theories about value, such as consumption value, service 
value, consumer value, and perceived value [18]–[21]. When 
we talk about the perceived value [18][22], we refer to 
consumers’ perception, price, and quality of a product, 
evaluating cost and benefit factors. To proceed with the 
conceptual research model presented in Figure 1, via 
Structural Equation Model (SEM), we measured the 
following four variables: source credibility, pleasure,

information reliability, and perceived value, in interaction 
with users’ traveling attitude and purchase intention.  
In order to confirm our Research Model, we used SEM, 
which incorporates the confirmatory approach, needed to 
justify our hypotheses. SEM uses confirmatory analysis 
rather than exploratory analysis for data. Confirmatory Factor 
Analysis (CFA) assess the measurement model validity, 
which compares the theoretical measurement with an actual 
model. SEM provides precise estimates of the errors in our 
parameters. As a first step, we are going to find which 
elements of each factor play an important role in user attitude 
and travel intention by using exploratory factor analysis 
(EFA), reliability analysis, and linear regression. However, 
the linear regression ignores mistakes and could lead us to 
severe inaccuracies, especially if mistakes are significant. 
Such methods are avoided by using SEM. SEM can 
incorporate both measurable and obscure variables. SEM 
method is preferred because it estimates the multiple and 
interrelated dependency in a single analysis.  
The “state of the art” in this research is that investigates 
the role of credibility, pleasure, reliability, and value on 
customer attitude when browsing on social media searching 
for travel information, covering a gap in the field of tourism 
industry. This research wants to be a useful guide for tour 
operators, web developers, and advertising companies to 
design better platforms and creating more attractive travel 
products or services. 
III. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND HYPOTHESES  
Our study examines the factors that affect travelers’ 
purchase intention and attitude in SM networks, [23]–[25]. In 
mental accounting theory, travel information mainly 
examines the context of SM use, rather than users’ 
technology knowledge [15][16]. Based on the perceived 
value and the usage of SM in the tourism sector, we 
developed our research model, Figure 1. In this context, 
perceptual value is defined in terms of quality and price-
performance or cost-benefit. Variables are categorized as 
source credibility, information reliability, pleasure, and 
perceived value. Also, perceived value leads to the usage of 
SM to search for travel information as a consequence of value 
perception. 
Travelers' purchase intention defined in terms of 
credibility, pleasure, information reliability, and perceived 
value as a trade-off between costs and benefits [15][16][23]. 
The confirmation of our model, Figure 1, will be a useful 
guide for tour operators knowing the online factors, which 
are crucial to the user’s travel decision. In this way, we are 
expanding previous researches on the use of SM by travelers 
in order to enhance our understanding of how travelers 
choose travel destinations through SM and in which way 
these four essential variables affect traveler purchase 
intention and interact with customer attitude [27]. 
A. Source credibility 
Source credibility is defined as the factor upon which 
information is perceived as believable and trustworthy by 
users [28]. Source credibility constitutes an essential factor in 
decision-making procedures and involves high levels of risk 
[29]. Thus, source credibility is relevant to the context and 
the information acquired following computer and user 
interaction [28]. Researchers have found that users used SM 
before traveling [30]. Users are looking for information and 
ideas in SM for their travel, accommodation, and activities 
[30][31]. Therefore, SM provides travelers with all the 
information they need to make their travel dreams come true, 
thus reducing the risks it may pose [32]. Findings have shown 
that travelers use SM to obtain information from other users 
[33]. In word of mouth communication (WOM), reliability, 
and trust are essential factors for the consumer to accept the 
receiving message [34][35]. Recent researches have shown 
that the credibility of a source plays a vital role in making a 
piece of information reliable [36], [37]. The research of [38] 
showed a weak or insignificant relationship between source 
trust and intention to use user-generated travel content. Social 
Media requires users to create profiles and therefore provide 
personal information. Besides, most SM and especially those 
related to tourism (TripAdvisor), provide rating systems so 
that each user can submit his / her positive or negative 
reviews [39]. Moreover, TripAdvisor provides a distinct 
evaluation system for each service, thus enabling the user to 
get more detailed and specific information about the tourist 
service [40]. 
Researches have shown that source credibility has a 
significant impact on user attitude as an external factor 
because it affects human judgment [41]. Source credibility 
influences persuasion when evidence is fuzzy. In this case, 
hands-on processing can partially become cognitive 
processing [42]. For example, celebrities are one type of 
exogenous factor, which may enhance source credibility by 
influencing users’ judgment [41].  
H1a. Source credibility has a positive influence on 
customer attitude 
H1b. Source credibility has a positive influence on 
purchase intention 
B. Pleasure 
Pleasure has a significant effect on technology admittance 
that enforces the meaning of usefulness [43] and internal 
motivation that enhances the feeling of using a computer 
Figure 1.   Theoretical framework and hypotheses

because it is enjoyable. [43] referred to enjoyment as the 
“extent to which the activity of using the computer is 
perceived to be enjoyable in its own right." When people use 
technology and feel pleased or joyful, they perceive 
technology as a contributory value, and they are willing to 
use it again and again. [44][26] stated that the meaning of 
perceived value incorporates two different values (utilitarian 
and hedonic). The hedonic value explained the entertainment 
and emotional value of shopping. Researchers have shown 
that pleasure positively affects perceived value [15][17] and 
the intention of using hedonic information [45]. The pleasure 
as a feeling derives from emotions such as love, joy, and 
enjoyment [46]. Users receive satisfaction from experiences 
and feelings and seek pleasure from the process experienced 
during browsing [47][48]. 
Web atmospherics are playing a significant role in user 
satisfaction and pleasure. Elements like design, simplicity, 
layout, colors, video, are playing a substantial role in making 
the user feel pleasant and affect him in his purchase decision 
[49]. According to [49], designers must use beautiful and 
nice-looking pictures, and animations and colors, which are 
distinctive, visually appealing, and thus, design features 
should be separated from information contents [50]. 
Emotional is linked to web atmospherics but also is related to 
the decision process of the consumer on tour operators’ 
websites [51]. According to [49], graphic design contributes 
to pleasing and arousing customers when they are engaged in 
searching for information and purchasing products or 
services provided by online stores.  
The feelings of pleasure created by using SM apps 
encourage travelers not only to look up information on travel 
destinations but also to interact with other users. Travelers 
interact with each other by sharing photos or videos [8]. We, 
therefore, assume the following:  
H2a. Pleasure has a positive influence on customer 
attitude 
H2b. Pleasure has a positive influence on purchase 
intention 
C. Information reliability 
Studies on marketing have shown that consumer 
preferences are driven by value. Consumers are people of 
essence who seek to maximize usage [26]. The Internet 
provides travelers with various choices of many possible 
destinations to visit and make users pursue information 
reliability through a strenuous information search [52]. Direct 
access to alternative sources of information through SM 
builds trust between electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) 
users and expert travel agents. The combination of 
convenient search and information reliability helps travelers 
to search, and evaluate a destination, and study new 
experiences related to a trip. The reliability of information is 
considered to be a significant factor for the traveler to 
perceive value when using SM [8].  
Travelers prefer searching for reliable and credible 
information provided by the interaction between users of SM 
rather than obtaining the information through travel websites 
[8]. Travelers use SM networks like Facebook or Instagram, 
which are connected to User Created Contents (UCC) travel 
destinations, to share their experiences (e.g., photos, videos). 
By doing so, some travelers evaluate this reliable and credible 
information about a trip, thus reflecting their desire to engage 
online — users study reviews to decide on their travel 
destinations. We should not forget that the choice of a travel 
destination is complicated, as it involves factors such as 
accommodation, transport, restaurants, attractions, and many 
more. The diversity of each traveler and their different needs 
have not been included in these factors. Therefore, SM 
should be able to provide information relevant to the different 
needs of each user. When it comes to information reliability, 
we mean it is free of advertisements and hotel promotion as 
it is based on real user experience [39]. Therefore, if travelers 
find that the information is reliable and useful, they trust SM 
more because they are confident, they come from real 
customers rather than from biased sources of information. 
The structure of information reliability is akin to the 
source information concept of information quality [53], 
which constitutes the output characteristics of the accuracy, 
timeliness, and completeness offered by the source of 
information. Quality of information of a travel destination 
has become a driving force on user decision making [54] 
assuming that the reliability of information influences 
purchase intention, hypothesizing the following: 
H3a. Information reliability has a positive influence on 
customer attitude 
H3b. Information reliability has a positive influence on 
purchase intention 
D. Perceived value 
The perceived value theory has also been adopted in 
travel destinations and shows high levels of influence on the 
intention of travelers to discover new or similar destinations, 
[55][56] showing that, in cruise travel services, emotional 
factors are essential in the perceived value. Cruise 
vacationers’ behavior is influenced by the factors of hedonics 
or pleasure within the perceived value. The perceptual value 
in the tourism industry has been the subject of interest among 
many researchers. Some researchers have studied the 
perceived value of the received benefits and the sacrifices 
made by consumers [57][58]. Tourism and consumer 
decisions are associated with desires, fantasies, and emotions. 
The estimated value is subjective and varies among different 
tourists and cultures, also taking the emotional reactions of 
consumers into account [59]–[62]. Another finding on the 
perceptual value of [56] is about the pleasure and emotional 
reactions that cruise travelers get out of cruising. 
Travelers evaluate the travel information in SM based on 
their perceptions of what they are willing to achieve and what 
to sacrifice. Perceived value involves a balance between costs 
and benefits and interaction between customer and service 
[63][43]. 
Analyzing 
the 
cost-benefit 
theory, 
the 
discrimination of perceived ease of use and perceived 
usefulness is similar between product performance and the 
effort of using the product. In high levels of perceived value 
in Social Media, travelers are likely to use a travel 
88

information search whereas, in the low levels of the perceived 
value, travelers show higher resistance toward travel 
information searches in SM [54]. When travelers search for 
information, they are more likely to select or to reject it based 
on the perceived benefits and the associated sacrifices of use, 
according to [43].  
H4a. Perceived value in travel services information from 
Social Media has a positive influence on customer attitude 
H4b. Perceived value in travel services information from 
Social Media has a positive influence on purchase intention 
Ε. Customer Attitude 
Consumer behavior is an integral part of marketing a 
successful business [64][65]. It has shown a positive 
relationship between consumer behavior and purchase 
intention [66][67]. The positive attitude of the consumer 
towards a product or service can positively contribute to 
purchase intention, especially on social networks [68]. 
According to all the above, we have the following hypothesis: 
 H5. Customer attitude has a positive influence on 
purchase intention 
F. Data collection 
The data for this study has been collected through a 
convenient sample e-survey from SM users. The e-survey 
was sent via a Facebook link to over 500 user profiles. The 
number of responders was 404 users. The age range of the 
responders was between 18 and over 54. The sample was 
primarily composed of individuals aged 18-44 years (98.1% 
of the sample) from European countries, mainly from Greece. 
Research [69] showed that over 70% in Greece of this age 
group (18-44) navigate on social media; therefore, it cannot 
be considered as a limitation (Table I). 
The e-survey was divided into three sections. The first 
section outlines users’ habits on SM and aims to discover the 
most important criteria for purchasing products or services 
for them. The second section outlines the factors that 
influence user travel purchase decisions. In order to complete 
the survey, the third section collected data for classification 
and statistical processing. 
 
 
G.  Data analysis 
 This research study adopted Structural Equation 
Modeling (SEM) to test the hypotheses. By using SEM, we 
want to evaluate our proposed model, analyze and explain the 
collected data [70]. All variables can be directly observed and 
thus qualify as manifest variables, called path analysis. In 
SEM terms, y, as in (1), (2), (3), (customer attitude and 
purchase intention), encloses the endogenous variables and χ 
(credibility, pleasure, reliability, and value) encloses the 
exogenous variables [71]. Variables that are influenced by 
other variables in a model are called endogenous variables. 
Variables that are not influenced by other variables in a 
model are called exogenous variables. Covariances, such as 
the one between χ1, χ2, χ3, and χ4, as in (1), (2), are represented 
by two-way arrows, Figure 2. One-way arrows represent 
paths acting as a cause. Each effect of source credibility, 
pleasure, information reliability, and the perceived value can 
be separated and are said to be related to customer attitude 
and purchase intention (Table II). The structural equations for 
this model are: 
 
y1=γ11χ1+γ12χ2+γ13χ3+γ14χ4+e1  
(1) 
 
y2=γ21χ1+γ22χ2+γ23χ3+γ24χ4+e2 
 (2) 
 
y2=ψ21y1+e3  
(3) 
 In our proposed research, we can see a model with two y 
variables and four χ variables. The multiple dependent 
variables, covariances, and variances of the exogenous 
factors x's are given and estimated by the values of the 
sample. As a result, it is complicated for the model to be 
falsified. Freedom degrees of our model counts the elements 
in the Φ matrix containing four values of γ and one of ψ.   
Thus, there are precisely as many free parameters as there 
are data points. The parameters create transformations of the 
data. In our SEM analysis, we include all individual items 
that load their relationships, variances, disturbance, or errors 
onto the observation variables. 
In our research, the metrics were designed after taking 
into consideration studies for our four manifest variables, 
source credibility, information reliability, pleasure, and 
perceived value. For the manifest variable of credibility, we 
used ten measurement scales [72][73][74]. For the manifest 
variable of pleasure, we used sixteen (including items for the

web atmospherics of the Social Media platforms) 
measurement scales [75][76][77]. For the manifest variable 
of information reliability, we used twelve measurement 
scales [33][78], and finally, for the manifest variable of the 
perceived value, we used nine measurement scales [15][16]. 
For every single item, we use multi-measurement items to 
overcome the limitations.  
 Because every single item has a high rate of 
measurement errors, we usually aim to capture all the 
attributes of a structure. All of these 47 items were measured 
on 5-point Likert scales, ranging from strongly disagree (1) 
to strongly agree (5).  
 The factor analysis drives us to erase some of the 47 
items because either they load in many factors or their 
loading values are very low. Next, we noticed that the items 
of the factor pleasure split into two different factors. As a 
result of this, we named the new variable web atmospherics. 
The first important step in factor analysis is the normality of 
the data, which has been tested with the measurement of 
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, providing a value of 0.903, indicating a 
great fit of our model [79]. In factor analysis, the pattern 
matrix loads five factors, credibility, atmospherics, pleasure, 
reliability, and value. The variable credibility loads seven 
items, and the variable pleasure loads four items, the variable 
reliability loads four items, the variable value loads three 
items, and the variable web atmospherics loads eight items. 
Also, in the results, the variable pleasure was divided into two 
factors: pleasure and the new factor named web atmospherics 
(Table III). The first five factors together account for 72.66% 
of the total variance. 
 In linear regression, the model summary showed that R2 
is explained by 56.8% of the population when the role of 
dependent value played by purchase intention and the 
predictors are the items of credibility, pleasure, reliability, 
value, and atmospherics. For the dependent value customer 
attitude with the same predictors as the above, the R2 
explained by 49.3% of the population.  
In reliability analysis, we found that Cronbach's alpha, for 
each one of the five factors, is very high, supporting the 
importance of each factor for our model (Table IV). In 
correlation analysis, findings give us α potential rendition of

the impact of some social factors on user attitude while 
searching for travel experiences (Table V). 
 In this research, we test and estimate our model through 
SEM. Two different approaches used for testing our research 
hypotheses. The first approach is exploratory factor analysis 
(EFA), with linear regression and reliability analysis. After 
the validation of the factors, we use the SEM to test the 
validity of the proposed model and hypotheses (Table VI). 
For the validity of our model, we tested the goodness-of-fit, 
[80], assisted by the goodness-of-fit index (GFI) [81], 
adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) [80], comparative fit 
index (CFI) [82], and root mean square error of 
approximation RMSEA [83].  
 After running many different models and taking into 
account all those parameters, improving our model, and 
eliminating all the possible errors, we found the following 
results, Figure 3. The GFI, AGFI, and CFI have values 
between 0.893 and 0.951, indicating an absolute fitting 
model. Also, the RMSEA with a value 0.073 is supporting 
the excellent fit of our model (Table VII) [45][46].  
 The overall model fit was measured using the chi-square, 
yielding a value of x2/df=3.156 [93], the chi-squared value 
was 533.392, and all factor loadings were statistically 
significant (p=0.000).

 In the confirmed research model (Figure 3), we observe 
that the factor of credibility does not interact with the 
intention and attitude variables, the factor of pleasure 
interacts with the travel purchase intention and customer 
attitude variables, the factor of reliability interacts only with 
the variable attitude, and the factor of value does not interact 
with the travel purchase intention and customer attitude 
variables. We also find that the factor of web atmospherics 
plays a significant role in customer attitude, interacting with 
the pleasure and value variables. The credibility variable does 
not interact with the main variables. Travel purchase 
Intention and customer attitude play an essential role in the 
way the other variables behave.

 CONCLUSIONS 
 This article aimed to create a model by which we could 
interpret the effect that specific SM factors have on user 
purchase intention, as far as travel services are concerned. 
Studying the theoretical background, we noticed a research 
gap that led us to our hypotheses, which we elaborate on in 
the article. We analyzed the collected data from the e-survey, 
and we tested our research model validity by detecting the 
factors that influence the user purchase intention when 
traveling, after using Social Media. Linear regression, factor 
analysis, Correlation, and reliability analysis used to test the 
validity of our variables (Tables III, IV, V).  
 The results gave us a good fit for our Conceptual model, 
allowed us to go one step further and confirmed our model 
through SEM. SEM enabled us to check our assumptions and 
confirm our model. Using the SEM data analysis, we

determined the critical factors concerning the customers’ 
attitude towards travel purchase intention.  
 Furthermore, the SEM method showed us that the 
variable web atmospherics influences purchase intention in 
SM platforms, playing the role of a moderator. Also, findings 
confirmed that the following factors are related to the travel 
service purchase intention and customer attitude. Source 
credibility has no positive relationship with travel purchase 
intention and customer attitude (H1a, H1b, not confirmed). 
The factor of pleasure has a positive relationship with travel 
purchase intention and customer attitude (H2a, H2b 
confirmed). The reliability variable has a positive 
relationship only with customer attitude (H3a confirmed, 
H3b not confirmed), whereas the factor of value has a 
positive relationship with travel purchase intention (H4a not 
confirmed, H4b confirmed). Finally, the travel purchase 
intention variable, interacts with the customer attitude 
variable positively (H5 confirmed), Table VIII. 
Thus, we can state that the pleasure, value, and reliability 
variables, play a critical role in customer attitude and 
purchase intention, when choosing a travel destination. Also, 
the credibility factor plays a significant role in positively 
interacting with the factors pleasure, reliability, and value, 
means that all the steps in the booking procedure must be 
simple, clear, and make you feel confident when you want to 
book a trip. The new variable, that is web aesthetics, has 
emerged, as it plays an essential role in traveling users’ 
decision making, interacting with the pleasure and value 
variables, meaning that it plays the role of moderator in 
customer attitude.  
Correlation findings help us to understand the vital role 
of travel product or service information in advertising. Also, 
customer attitude is highly correlated with the provided travel 
information from social media platforms. Furthermore, social 
media information could change the first opinion or attitude 
of the user about a travel product or service. User attitude, on 
travel information, can be affected by the comments of their 
social media friends or a social influencer. The findings from 
correlation analysis is a useful guide for tour operators or 
marketers in order to focus on the travel information they 
provide, targeting the social friends or influencers of the 
potential 
customers. 
Accordingly, 
marketers 
are 
recommended to target users who like searching or booking 
trips through social media, interact with, and are influenced 
by their social friends. 
Also, the findings suggest that designers and tour 
operators should concentrate on adapting, factors such as 
pleasure, reliability, which are playing a significant role in 
customer attitude and purchase intention to their platforms. 
The factor pleasure in terms of making the user feel good, 
enjoyable, and pleasant when searching for travel 
information, must be adapted from web developers, 
advertising companies, and tour operators in order to increase 
the visibility, the interaction, and the possibility of a user’s 
purchasing a trip. That could be achieved it, targeted 
advertising on social media for travel service purchased 
and user intention to purchase such services. Furthermore, 
the factors, reliability, and value, make the user feel that the 
platform is trustworthy and improves the perception of the 
price and the quality of the product or service that the 
platform provides.  
As future research could be the investigation of more 
variables on SM (esp. Instagram), playing a significant role 
in user travel decisions. Furthermore, possible correlations 
between users who want to present themselves in an idealized 
way, designed to impress or their desire to impress social 
friends on travel service purchase decisions, could be 
investigated. Future studies similar to the current study 
should incorporate social media user behavior, such as 
purchase attitude as a dependent variable. Finally, future 
studies will benefit from investigating the present model in 
more diverse cultural contexts and lead us to deepen our 
understanding of user behavior in social media coming from 
different cultures and will lead the marketers and tour 
operators to the creation of more personalized products and 
services.
