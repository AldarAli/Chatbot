Abstract—The phonetic and phonological properties of the 
pharyngealized consonants are essential for understanding 
how they affect the phonological systems of the languages in 
which they occur. This study focuses on consonants with a 
primary or secondary pharyngeal articulation, which occur in 
Moroccan Arabic dialect. Pharyngeal or pharyngealized 
consonants are rare and they are understudied. The 
manifestation of pharyngealization is centered between the 
consonant and vowel as in distortion of the formant transitions 
in the adjacent vowel. This study used ariculatory and acoustic 
data to characterize the pharyngealized Moroccan Arabic 
dialect sound and highlight their effect on neighboring vowel. 
The 
acoustic 
results 
from 
very 
specific 
articulatory 
configuration show that the vowel formants are influenced by 
the pharyngealized contexts and the articulatoy gestures 
spread on the adjacent vowel. It was also found that the 
pharyngealized and the voiced pharyngeal consonants have 
similar effects on the neighboring vowel.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
During speech production, a series of articulatory 
gestures are realized by means of the phonatory organs 
movement in the vocal tract. The passage from the 
production of isolate phonemes to continuous speech 
involved an enormous articulatory and acoustic variability. 
Today, technological developments in medical imaging, 
progress in the observation of organs and muscles facilitated 
by new tools, have produced significant advances in the 
understanding of the mechanisms involved in speech 
production [1]. 
In this work, we indicate the methods and techniques 
used to observe the activity of organs in speech production 
and the possibilities offered by the vocal tract. The way of 
envisaging how this is done is to situate the process in a 
physiological theory of speech production and invoke an 
articulatory model. Close attention to the movement of the 
phonatory articulators involved in speech production can 
shed light on the consequences of certain actions on other 
organs. The great mobility of the phonatory organs offers a 
rapid modification of the vocal tract, leading to the 
modification of the size of the oral cavity and the 
pharyngeal cavity.  
The pharynx is a passageway linking the oral cavity with 
the esophagus and the nasal cavity with the larynx. It runs 
vertically from the base of the skull to the level of the sixth 
cervical vertebra [2]. It serves as the first resonator for 
laryngeal sound. Regarding the role of the pharynx in 
speech production, it is important to note that the alterations 
in the size and shape of the pharyngeal cavity play an 
important role in determining voice quality, this is why the 
researchers paid particular attention to the anatomical and 
muscular description of the pharynx. Thus the raising or 
lowering of the larynx alters the length of the pharyngeal 
cavity which leads to acoustic consequences due to the 
change in the vertical dimension of the pharynx; larynx 
lowering results in the lowering of formant values [3]. 
In this study, we deal with the Arabic sound which 
occurs in the pharyngeal zone of the vocal tract, the 
pharyngealized consonant /tʕ/ which shows the highest 
degree of emphaticness [2]. Laufert and Baer cited 
Panconcelli-Calzia (1924. pp. 48-49) who suggested 
processes for the emphatic consonants: contraction of the 
muscles of the hyoid bone, raising of the larynx, 
constriction of the pharynx due to the actions of the 
constrictor muscles [2]. According to Catford's definition, 
when there are two simultaneous articulations, an 
articulation in the pharynx is considered the secondary one 
[4] (the Pharyngeal constriction generally constitutes a 
secondary articulation). In Arabic and other Semitic 
languages, 
pharyngealization 
involves 
a 
secondary 
articulation, it is defined as an articulation performed 
separately in addition to the primary articulation associated 
with a sound. The secondary articulation according to 
definition is less constricted than the primary articulation. 
The studies of emphatics based on experimental data, 
mainly from x-ray as in Ghazeli’s study, he conclude that 
the pharyngeal sounds are articulated in the lower part of the 
pharynx, the uvular sounds have a constriction in the upper 
oropharynx and the emphatics have a secondary tongue 
retraction midway in the pharynx between the place of 
articulation of uvular and pharyngeal [5].

Giannini and Pettorino [6] examined one Arabic speaker 
of a Baghdadi dialect and presented acoustic and 
radiographic data. Their acoustic results are that for the 
emphatics the first and second formant Fl and F2 approach 
each other: Fl rises and F2 lowers. The third formant F3 is 
almost unchanged. They interpreted their radiographic 
results as showing a constriction in the pharynx for the 
emphatic sounds. 
In summary, our main aim in this paper is to study the 
production of the Moroccan Arabic pharyngealized sound 
/tʕ/, its effects on adjacent vowel /a/ and we compare them 
with the pharyngeal consonants /ʕ/. Using cineradiography 
films of the vocal tract, we examined the hypothesis that 
both the pharyngeal and pharyngealized consonants are 
consistently produced with a pharyngeal constriction, and 
with a raising larynx and that pharyngeal constriction and 
larynx height are thus an articulatory features associated 
with these sounds, we refer to the acoustic and radiographic 
data to examine this issue. We also explore the association 
of the two consonants effect on the adjacent vowel /a/ as in 
/ʕţa/. The methods and tools used for data processing and 
for measuring organ displacements are given in Section 2, 
the obtained results are given in Section 3 and the 
conclusion is given in Section 4. 
II. 
 METHODS AND TOOLS 
This study based on experimental data, mainly from x-
ray images of the vocal tract and acoustic data, these 
articulatory and acoustic data were taken from a database 
(DOnnées Cinéradiographiques VAlorisées et recherches 
sur la Coarticulation, Inversion et évaluation de Modéles 
physiques) (DOCVACIM) [7]. We have drawn the main 
articulator contours, particularly those of the tongue, lower 
and upper lips, the larynx, the glottis, the jaw, the hard 
palate and the hyoid bone.  
A. Delineating Articulator Contours 
We used software, called “X-articulators” [8], enabling 
several tracking tools to be used according to the nature of 
articulators. The “X-articulators” software has been 
designed to exploit automatic or semi-automatic tracking 
tools, it provide several tools to the exploitation of contours 
easier [8], and to construct articulatory models from the 
articulator contours via Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA). The main articulator are approximated by the 
following 
parameters: 
The 
lip 
deformations 
are 
approximated by two factors (roughly aperture and 
protrusion), and the lower part of the pharynx (including the 
larynx and the epiglottis) is represented by two factors 
(larynx height, glottis), the tongue by three factors (apex, 
tongue dorsum, tongue body) [9]. It provides also several 
tools to make the exploitation of contours easier, since it is 
important to relate contours to phonemes uttered, it is 
possible to import a file of phonetic annotations. Thus, 
before the delineation of the phonatory organs contours a 
phonetic annotations and Synchronization of the annotation 
is carried out. 
The radiographic film used in this study, consists of 
vocal tract x-ray images of a native Moroccan Arabic adult 
male speaker, and the acoustic data consists of sentences in 
Moroccan Arabic dialect. For this study, we processed the 
images that correspond to the production of Arabic vowel 
/a/ adjacent to pharyngealized consonant /tʕ/. These 
articulatory data allowed us to extract combinations of 
articulators for this phonetic type. 
B. Treatment of Acoustic Data 
The acoustic database consists of sentences uttering by 
an adult male speaker in Moroccan Arabic dialect, which is 
the L1 of the speaker. In this study we selected sequences 
that contain vowel /a/ in pharyngealized environment. We 
used the software Praat to segment the sentences into 
phonemes and also for the phonetic annotation, the length of 
each sentence is measured and also the duration of the entire 
sequence. After segmentation, we synchronized each phone 
with the corresponding x-ray images of the speaker vocal 
tract. Thus, for each phoneme we have the corresponding 
vocal tract x- ray images, and then we processed the vocal 
tract x-ray images corresponding to each phoneme. 
The contours are annotated and exploited for direct 
measurement of the articulators’ displacement. 
C. Measurment of the phonatory organs displacements 
The method of measurement of the displacement of the 
phonatory organs is based on an angular reference. Knowing 
that the vocal tract configurations are different for each 
speaker that is the reason why we make an adapted grid for 
our subject. An orthonormal basis is drawn beforehand on 
tracing paper and used with the adapted grid to measure the 
articulators’ displacements [10]. This method allows the 
observation of the displacements of the phonatory organs, 
therefore it is used in the analysis of numerous data 
collected on different subjects. a reference image which 
corresponds to a rest position is chosen to reproduce on the 
millimeter layer, where the orthonormal reference has been 
drawn before, the fixed elements of the vocal tract, 
particularly the upper incisor and the hard palate, thus, 
making the upper incisor particularly reliable as a reference 
point. The traced part will then be superimposed on each 
sketch as finely as possible. All the positions of the 
phonatory organs are therefore calculated relative to the 
upper incisor. In our study, we focused on the measurements 
of the larynx center position, the constriction opening, the 
constriction location and the hyoid bone position, knowing 
that these components are the effective gestures for 
producing the pharyngeal and pharyngealized consonants.  
III. 
RESULTS 
 Tables 1 summarizes the position of the hyoid bone and 
the larynx center, the constriction opening and location, 
during the production of the pharyngeal /ʕ/, the 
pharyngealized consonants /tʕ/ and during the production of 
the short vowel /a/ adjacent to these consonants.  
We focused on the vertical movement of the larynx and 
the hyoid bone given by the vertical coordinate (y) relative 
to the rest position, all measures are carried out relative to 
the reference point (upper incisor). The Average Values 
(AV) with Standard Deviation (SD) are calculated, the

For the pharyngealized /tʕ /, the larynx center position is 
at about 5.732cm, with SD =0.654, the larynx center rises 
by 0.8 cm relative to the rest position. The hyoid bone is at 
3.35cm, and SD=0.17, the hyoid bone rises by 0.87 cm. The 
constriction location is at 1.87cm and the constriction 
opening is about 0.09cm.  
In the context of the word /ʕtʕah/, the larynx center 
position is 4.65cm, it rises about 1.52 cm. The hyoid bone is 
at 3.05cm, it raises by 1.17 cm relative to the rest position. 
The constriction location is at 1.45cm and the constriction 
opening is 0.06cm.  
During the production of the pharyngeal consonant /ʕ/, 
the larynx center rise by about 0.87 cm relative to the rest 
position and the hyoid bone raise by 0.72 cm. The 
constriction location is at 13.76cm and the constriction 
opening is 1.16cm. 
What is noticed in our study is the remarkable influence 
of the pharyngealized consonant /tʕ/ on the articulation of /ʕ/ 
in the word /ʕtʕah/. If we compare the larynx center and the 
hyoid bone position during the production of /ʕ/ in the word 
/ʕtʕah/ and during the production of /ʕ/ in the word /ʕlaʃ/ 
[11], we noticed that the larynx center moved up to 4.699 
cm, so it rises by 1.47 cm relative to the rest position, 0.674 
cm more than in the case of /ʕlaʃ/ and 0.601 cm more than 
the average value of the larynx center position during the 
production of /ʕ/ in the plain coronal contexts. The hyoid 
bone reaches the value 2.81 cm, it rises by 1.41 cm relative 
to the rest position; 1.40 cm more compared to the 
production of /ʕ/ in the word /ʕlaʃ/ and 0.94 cm more than 
the average value of the hyoid bone position in the different 
studied contexts of /ʕ/ [11]. Likewise, the pharyngealized 
/tʕ/ is influenced by /ʕ/, where the larynx center rises by 
about 1cm more than in the plain coronal contexts. So, there 
is a mutual effect of the two consonants.  Regarding the 
constriction location and opening, the software x-articulator 
gives us these two parameters as follow: The constriction is 
given by the point of the tongue whose distance to the palate 
(measured by orthogonal projection) is minimal. This 
distance gives the opening of the constriction. To locate the 
position of the constriction, the outline of the palate is used 
and the length of the path between the upper incisor and the 
place of the constriction is calculated. When there is a 
contact between the tongue and the palate, it is the point of 
the most onward constriction in the vocal tract that is chosen 
[8][9]. We can conclude from the obtained results that the 
primary articulation for /tʕ/ is located at 1.45 to 1.87 cm 
relative to the upper incisor and the constriction opening is 
about 0.06 to 0.09 cm. the secondary constriction is located 
at 12.96 to 13.3 cm and the constriction opening is 0.98 to 
1.1 cm. we noticed that the primary constriction is more 
constricted than the secondary one and the location of  the 
secondary constriction for the pharyngealized /tʕ/ is close to 
that of the pharyngeal /ʕ, ћ/ which are at about 13.76 to 
14.63 cm. the difference is 0.8 cm to 2.16 cm. 
In the second part of this section, we explore the 
articulatory effects of these consonants on the adjacent 
vowel /a/. The larynx center position and the hyoid bone 
positions are measured during the production of the vowel 
/a/ in plain coronal contexts, the average value of the larynx 
center position is 5.81 cm, and the value of SD is 0.27, the 
larynx center rises by 0.36 cm and the hyoid bone is at 
3.935 cm, and SD =0.3, the hyoid bone rises by 0.29 cm. In 
the pharyngealized environment /tʕ/, the larynx center rises 
by 0.50 cm relative to the rest position, it rises 0.14 cm

more compared to that measured in plain coronal context. 
The hyoid bone rises by 0.61 cm (0.32 cm more). 
As mentioned earlier, the acoustic output varies 
according to the behavior of the active gestures and the 
obtained results from the articulatory study lead to 
additional questions about the acoustic consequences of 
change in the vertical position of the larynx on vowel 
adjacent to the pharyngealized /tʕ/. An acoustic study of the 
vowel quality was conducted in order to determine the 
extent to which vowels could be affected by that 
environment. The software Praat is used for the 
segmentation of the words into phonemes and for the 
measurement of the formants values. The table II 
summarizes the formants values of the vowel /a/ in 
pharyngealized neighboring, in plain coronal contexts and in 
the voiced pharyngeal neighboring. 
The formants  are explored for our subject: For the 
vowel /a/ in plain coronal environment, the average value of 
F1 is 519.60 Hz with standard deviation SD equal to 46.46, 
the value of F2 is 1573.437 Hz, and SD =94.37, F3 is equal 
to 2485.809 Hz, with SD =137.43, the value of F4 is 
3676.291, and SD =95.33.   
In /tς/ neighboring, F1 increases by 138.52 Hz, F2 
decreases by -314.15 Hz, F3 and F4 undergo a moderate 
increase of 52.33 Hz and 23.88 Hz respectively. In the case 
of /ʕtςa/, F1 increases by 198.98 Hz, F2 decreases by -
232.48 Hz, F3 remain stable, and F4 increases by 123.72 
Hz. 
In this study, we compare the effects of the 
pharyngealized consonant / tʕ/ on adjacent vowel /a/with 
that of the pharyngeal /ʕ/. The effects of the pharyngealized  
/tʕ / and the pharyngeal /ʕ/on the formants values of /a / are: 
F1 increases by about 134.79Hz in /ʕ/ environment, and by 
138.52 Hz in /tʕ/ environment, the effect of the pharyngeal 
/ʕ/ is similar to that of the pharyngealized/tʕ/and in the 
context of /ʕtʕah/, F1 increases by about 198.98 Hz.  F2 in 
the environment of /ʕ/ increases by about 132.78 Hz, in the 
environment of /tʕ /, it decreases by about -314.15 Hz. In the 
word /ʕtʕah/, it decreases by -232.48 Hz. This result agrees 
with the founding of Al-Ani [12], he found a considerable 
drop of F2 in vowels following pharyngealized consonants 
compared to plain consonants. Ghazeli also reported that all 
vowels have a lower F2 after pharyngealized consonants [5]. 
We noticed that /ʕ/ decreases the effect of /tʕ/ by about 
81.67 Hz. F3 is less influenced by both /tʕ/ and / ʕ/, so in the 
context of the word /ʕtʕah/, it remains stable. F4 increases 
by 91.89 Hz in the environment of/ʕ/, by 23.88 Hz in the 
environment of /tʕ/, and it increases by 123.72 Hz in the 
word/ʕtʕah/. F4 is less influenced by /tʕ/ and a little more by 
/ʕ/, so in /ʕtʕah/, the effects of /ʕ/ and /tʕ/ are superimposed.  
Comparing the articulatory and the acoustic results, we 
noticed a correlation between the degrees of the articulatory 
gestures spreading on the adjacent vowel /a/with the 
acoustic consequences. Thus, in the word /ʕtʕah/, the 
pharyngeal /ʕ/ adjacent to the pharyngealized /tʕ/ and both 
adjacent to the vowel /a/, the larynx center rises during the 
production of /a/ at 0.987 cm, it is increased by 45.08% 
relative to the context /ʕa/ (0.542 cm) and by 40.52% 
relative to the context /tʕa/ (0.587 cm) [11].

IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this study, the articulatory and acoustic aspects of 
the production of the pharyngealized consonant /tʕ/are 
explored. We compared these aspects with those of the 
pharyngeal consonant /ʕ/. The effects of the association of 
the pharyngeal consonant with the pharyngealized one as 
in the word /ʕtʕah/ on the adjacent vowel /a/are 
investigated.  
We noticed that the raising of the larynx center and 
the hyoid bone is in the same range during the production 
of both /ʕ/ and /tʕ/ (about 0.8 cm), and F1 increases by 
48.5% in /ʕ/ neighboring and by about 39.49% in /tʕ/ 
neighboring. The production of the two consonants 
successively /ʕtʕ/ in the word /ʕtʕah/ the larynx center and 
the hyoid bone rise doubly by about 1.5 cm. So, we 
observe that the gesture is superimposed and the acoustic 
effect on F1 also is raised, we noticed a correlation 
between the articulatory effect and the value of the first 
formant F1. 
In summary, /ʕ/ and /tʕ/have a similar effect on F1 in 
CV context and in CCV context F1 undergoes a moderate 
increase compared to CV context about 14% to 23%. F2 
increases by 132.78 Hz in /ʕ/ neighboring and drops by -
314.15 Hz in /tʕ/ neighboring, in /ʕtʕah/ it drops by -
232.48 Hz, so the association of the two types of 
consonants reduced their effects on F2 and the effect of 
/tʕ/ is dominant.  /ʕ/ decreases the effect of /tʕ/ on F2 by 
about 81.67 Hz in the word /ʕtʕ ah/.  
F3 is less influenced by both /tʕ/ and /ʕ/, F4 is not 
influenced by the pharyngealized /tʕ/.

been possible without the exceptional support of Dr. Yves 
Laprie, who welcomed us in the research laboratory 
“Laboratoire Lorrain de Recherche en Informatique et ses 
Applications LORIA”, in Henri-Poincaré University of 
Nancy, France. We thank him for his assistance and for 
providing the data with their processing tools. His 
knowledge and exacting attention to detail have been an 
inspiration and kept my work on track.
