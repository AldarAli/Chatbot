Abstract— The paper describes the architecture of a non-
invasive, wireless embedded system for gait analysis and 
preventing involuntary movements including falls. The system 
operates with synchronized and digitized data samples from 8 
EMG (limbs) and 8 EEG (motor-cortex) channels. An 
embedded Altera Cyclone V FPGA operates the real-time 
signal 
pre-processing 
and 
the 
computation 
(resource 
utilization: 85.95% ALMs, 43283 ALUTs, 73.0% registers, 
9.9% block memory; processing latency < 1ms). The system 
has been tested on patients affected by Parkinson disease (PD) 
under physician guide and compared with healthy subjects’ 
results.  Both PD and healthy subjects have been involved in 
the standard diagnostic protocol (normal gait and pull test). 
The developed cyber-physical system detects differences 
between the PD and the healthy subjects in terms of walking 
pattern, i.e., agonist-antagonist co-contractions (Typ time: 
PD’s 148ms vs Healthy 88ms; Max: PD’s 388ms vs Healthy 
314ms). The PD’s cerebral Movement Related Potentials (i.e., 
Bereitschaft) analysis during the pull-test showed an increasing 
from 59dBμ to 66dBμ after 3 settling steps while measurements 
on healthy subject return, respectively, 57dBμ, 62dBμ in 1 
settling step. The system is able to prevent fall enabling the 
actuator in 168ms, i.e., better than the normal human time 
reaction (300ms).

 INTRODUCTION  
Due to neurological diseases, muscular deformities, 
ageing and further numerous factors, the normal gait 
frequently tends to degenerate into gait disorders. They 
constitute a contributive intrinsic falling cause, heavily 
increasing the risk of falling. Nowadays, 28–35% of people 
aged 65 years and above fall and, as consequence, each year 
more than 424000 fall events are fatal [1][2]. The economic 
impact of this phenomenon is impressive: 43.8 billion dollars 
are estimated to be used in fall-related medical care 
expenditures by 2020 [3]. Despite the extensive research in 
this field, developed tools for fall risk have not been 
successful in predicting and preventing falls [3]. Indeed, 
although fall detection technology is now mature (detectors 
for domestic use can be implemented using artificial vision 
techniques, 
tri-axial 
gyroscopes 
and 
accelerometers, 
Microsoft Kinect’s infrared sensors, floor vibrations and 
sounds and numerous others) [4], fall prevention solutions 
are still far to be implemented. Fall prevention systems can 
be mainly divided into four categories: static fall-risk 
assessment, pre-fall intervention, fall-injury prevention and 
fall prevention [5][6]. The static fall-risk assessment 
category includes all the protocolled clinical tools which aim 
to identify people with high fall-risk due to neuro-muscular 
diseases (i.e., Barthel Index [7], the TGBA index [8], 
STRATIFY [9], TUG [10]). The static fall-risk assessment 
tools 
are 
indispensable 
for 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
drug/rehabilitation plan but do not perform any intervention 
for preventing falls. The pre-fall intervention category 
includes all the methods oriented to the improvement of 
balance, stability and muscular strength of the subject. In 
recent years, in order to create more appealing exercises, 
assistive technology has been successfully implemented to 
drive the patients into a kind of game-exercise (i.e., 
Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii, VR tools [11][12]). They 
can be part of a wider preventive plan but they cannot 
constitute a standalone solution since they do not limit the 
consequent damage of a fall. The fall-injury prevention 
category groups all the technologies implementing a shock 
absorber when a fall event is detected. Those systems are 
made up by the fall detection system and by the actuator, 
which timely manage the shock absorber. The shock 
absorption is conducted by an airbag that is promptly 
inflated. Toshiyo et al. [13] present a system protection 
against impact with the ground using accelerometers and 
gyroscopes for the fall detection and a jacket-worn airbag to 
be timely inflated before the impact. These systems, although 
reduce effectively the damage due to the fall, fail to cover all 
the scenarios and do not limit the brain damage associated 
with it (i.e., fair of falling). The fall prevention category aims 
to definitively avoid the fall event [14-17].  In [14], Zeilig et 
al., describe a fall prevention system named “ReWalk” 
consisting of a multi-sensing platform (blood pressure, ECG, 
etc.) for fall detection combined to an exoskeleton to assist 
the movement of the subject. Vuillerme et al. [15] propose to 
use a combination of pressure sensors and electro-tactile 
biofeedback to prevent the fall. Additionally, Munro et al. 
[16] describe a fall prevention tool based on an intelligent 
wearable knee flexion controller. These systems are the most 
suitable for fall prevention since if a fall event is detected, a 
feedback aiming to correct the movement is delivered to the 
subject and the fall is avoided.  In this frame, we propose a 
novel digital back-end architecture for fall prediction in the 
everyday life. The architecture, implemented on a field 
programmable 
gate 
array 
(FPGA), 
combines 
both 
electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography to take 
decision for processing and eventual corrective actions on 
the muscles. To the best of our knowledge, our architecture 
is the first fully implemented cyber-physical system, which 
allows fall prevention by real-time processing of coupled 
EMG and EEG.

II. 
MEDICAL BACKGROUND 
Literature studies demonstrate the possibility to predict a 
fall by a combined analysis of muscular movement (EMG) 
and its brain pre-processing (EEG) by monitoring EEG 
Movement Related Potentials (MRP) anticipating muscle 
activations [1-4, 17-18]. Currently none of the above 
remarked solutions enables such analysis:  indeed only 
partial solutions have been proposed in literature. In fact, 
some systems measure individually EEG or EMG; others 
measure both of them, but only on a few EEG/EMG 
electrodes without relative synchronization, using an 
external clock and delivering filtered data to be post-
processed and not handled in real time [19]. We mainly 
focus on Bereitschaftspotential (BP), μ and β rhythms that 
can be detected in the motor-cortex area even one second 
before the muscle activation in the band of 2–5Hz, 7–12Hz, 
and 13–30Hz respectively. In movement disorders, mobility 
impairment is indicated by an altered modulation of the 
MRPs as well as a mismatch between the MRPs and the 
movement.  EMG data are processed in parallel, aiming to 
evaluate the co-contraction time among agonist-antagonist 
muscles. The co-contraction time is the period during which 
an agonist and antagonist muscles (i.e., Gastrocnemius and 
Tibialis) are contracted at the same time. During normal gait 
where agonist and antagonist muscles are alternately 
activated, the co-contraction time is low (< 300ms) and 
depends on the particular subject. High EMG co-contraction 
time during gait (larger than 500/600ms depending on the 
subject) is a significant index of unbalance and instability. 
According to [20], a reaction time of 300ms or lower returns 
a probability p < 0.01 of falling. Therefore, if the system 
reacts within this time limit and delivers a corrective action, 
the fall can be avoided.   
III. 
THE CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM  
The high-level architecture of the cyber-physical system 
is outlined in Fig. 1. The wireless body area network 
(WBAN) allows synchronized collection of EEG and EMG. 
Eight EEG (according to the international 10-20 system T3, 
T4, C3, C4, CZ, P3, P4, O2, – 500Hz and 24bit resolution) 
and as many EMG channels (Gastrocnemius, Tibialis, 
Rectus and Biceps Femoralis of both the legs – 500Hz 
sampling rate and 16bit resolution [21]) are collected by a 
wireless and wearable recording systems, and sent to a 
gateway as shown in Fig. 2. The signal processing is 
performed on an FPGA. Signal processing outcomes are 
subsequently passed to a reasoner, which detect critical 
situation by analyzing EEG, EMG, inertial sensor data, 
environment and clinical condition information. When a 
potential fall is detected, a feedback is generated and 
delivered to the subject. The global vision of the project 
includes the electrical stimulation of the antagonist limb 
muscles in order to favor the postural correction, drastically 
reducing the probability of fall. The electrostimulation sub-
system is part of our future works. 
A. High-Level Algorithm Description  
EMG and EEG follow two different processing 
branches. A trigger signal is extracted from EMG raw data 
using a dynamic-threshold approach. The trigger signal is 
computed as follows. First, the EMG signal is rectified, 
squared and stored in an M samples shift-register (in our 
algorithm M = 512, that is 1s data). The mean value of all 
register samples (global average) is therefore directly the 
EMG power in the M samples window and it is used as 
threshold. A second mean value (local average) is computed 
on the last N samples (i.e., corresponding to just a part of 
the complete M samples shift register, being N<M, in our 
design N = 128) and compared with the threshold. As a new 
EMG sample arrives, both global and local average are 
refreshed, making the thresholding scheme dynamic. The 
EMG trigger rises and stays high only if the local power is 
larger than the dynamic global average threshold. This 
approach heavily compresses the EMG signals, providing 
and unambiguous muscle activation signal (only 1bit trigger 
signal per muscle). For the EEG part running in parallel 
with respect to the EMG one, the time-frequency analysis is 
run on seven motor-cortex channels only (T3, T4, C3, C4, 
CZ, P3, P4), while the occipital one (O2) is used for noise 
reduction. As soon as new EEG samples arrive, data are 
stored in a 256 samples register. When a coupled EMG 
rising edge is detected, a 256 points 24bit resolution Fast 
Fourier Transform (FFT) is computed on the previous 256 
EEG samples stored into the register. The cortical 
involvement is opposite with respect to the movement 
performed: if a right limb movement is detected (right

Gastrocnemius), the analysis is performed on left motor-
cortex channels (Cz, C3, T3, P3) and vice versa (left 
Gastrocnemius triggers Cz, C4, T4, P4, note that since Cz is 
a central channel is triggered by both). The FFT output data 
are processed to compute the square magnitude and the 
appropriate frequency components summed in order to 
calculate the spectral powers in the MRPs bands. When the 
EMG trigger arrives, the EEG power levels in the MRPs 
band are referred to approximately 500ms before the 
movement occurs. The obtained power levels for each EEG 
channel are then compared to fixed thresholds (which need 
to be trimmed on the subject) in order to evaluate the 
voluntariness of the EMG contraction. Thresholds are 
customized on the individual after a period of learning (the 
subjects were asked to rest for 1 minute). 
B. FPGA Architecture: Processor System-level Design 
In the aim of a future ASIC implementation, the 
architecture has been validated on a FPGA (Altera Cyclone 
V). 
A 
more 
detailed 
description 
of 
the 
FPGA 
implementation has been presented in [21][22]. The input-
output interface of our design is characterized by:16 bio-
signals inputs (eight 16bit EMG and eight 24bit EEG); 25 
outputs (BP, μ and β 1bit flags for the seven EEG motor-
cortex channels and 4 co-contraction 1bit signals). The 
System clock is set to 8.19209MHz (signal 8 MHz CLK), 
obtained with an on-chip Phase-Locked Loop (PLL, block 
named PLL) from the embedded 50MHz oscillator (50 
MHz CLK). The global signals of the whole implementation 
are: Reset, an asynchronous reset (derived from the 
Reset KEY input) ; Enable SW, an enable signal which 
freezes the processing; 500Hz CLK, an input data clock 
signal from the  EMG and EEG channels (500Hz 
frequency); 8 MHz CLK, a 8.19209MHz system clock 
obtained by the on-chip PLL. In the complete system, 8 
EMG and 7 EEG processing branches are replicated in 
parallel on the FPGA. In the following sub-section, we 
summarize the processing data path for a generic combined 
[21][22].  
EMG Processing Branch (see Fig. 3). Incoming squared 
EMG samples passed to two FSMs, Global Power FSM and 
Local Power FSM, to calculate in parallel, respectively, the 
dynamic threshold (global power) and the local power. 
Based on two block RAM (Global Threshold and Local 
Threshold Block RAM of M = 512 and N = 128, 32bit 
words), when a new EMG sample arrives (500Hz CLK = 
‘1’) the last inserted sample is pointed and “pop” (512th and 
128th for, respectively, Global Power and Local 
Power Block RAM). Then, the read sample is subtracted 
and the new sample is added to refresh the overall power 
Sum within the window. An asynchronous 64bit comparator 
(>) compares the powers calculated in parallel by the two 
blocks (THR and Local THR). Local THR is also 
compared to a fixed threshold (evaluated on the subject 
resting) that prevents unpredictable behavior due to noise 
when the subject stops walking. The output of the 
comparator is the 1bit EMG trigger (signal Trigger), used 
both in the EEG computation to enable the time-frequency 
analysis and in the co-contraction calculation. The co-
contraction signal is obtained by computing an AND logic 
operation on agonist-antagonist coupled muscles. The 
adopted approach allows the efficient calculation of the 
powers in the desired windows, without necessarily having 
to re-compute, at each 8MHz clock rising edge, the overall 
sum of the RAMs.  
EEG Processing Branch (see Fig. 4). The EEG branch 
comprises a 256 points 24bit resolution FFT processor 
based on a butterfly structure [24, 25]. The 256 EEG 
samples to be transformed are dynamically stored in a 256 
24bit words RAM(EEG Block RAM) addressed by a loop 
address counter in the FFT Controller. When EMG 
Trigger rises to ‘1’, the 256 samples stored into the RAM 
are passed the FFT block by properly temporizing the 
Sink_controls signals through a series of dedicated states. 
After data is sent and validated (Source_controls), the FSM 
waits for another Trigger rising edge to repeat the 
sequencing. The FFT output data is interpreted by the MRP 
Calculator where they are squared and opportunely summed 
(both real and imaginary parts) using a 64bit adder in order 
to extract the BP, µ and β powers, in natural units (BP, MU, 
BETA signals). Finally, when MRP Ready is asserted, BP, 
µ and β are compared to fixed thresholds related to the 
subject, preloaded on the FPGA. 
C. The Reasoner  
The decision algorithm is based on the annotation of 
EMG/EEG wireless wearable electrodes signals and on the 
application of logic-based inferences in order to classify fall 
patterns and calculate a response for feedback delivery.

EMG co-contractions, EEG MRPs and data acquired from 
an inertial sensor are used to distinguish when a fall is 
starting and to trigger the further processing steps. The 
environmental conditions and the medical history of the 
patient are taken into account. The reasoner has been 
already developed in previous works: a more detailed 
description of the semantic matchmaking algorithm is 
reported in [19]. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
Experimental results on healthy subjects have been 
already presented in [21-23, 25, 31-33]. In the present paper, 
we propose a dataset including EEG/EMG recordings of a 
subject affected by Parkinson disease (PD) and a healthy 
one, both performing natural gait (120s) and ‘pull tests’ 
[26]. Those tests are performed in a controlled environment 
(local hospital), under the supervision of specialized staff. 
The use of the proposed system in these analyses provides a 
systematic and objective quantification of diagnostic 
indexes. Overall, the worst case power consumption (when 
unrealistically all blocks are simultaneously operating) can 
be estimated as 150mW, which is a feasible upper bound for 
portable applications [21, 24, 28, 29]. The system is able to 
deliver the corrective action in 168ms well within the 300ms 
time limit (data collection: 14ms; data processing: 42ms; 
reasoning: 12ms; feedback: 100ms) [19]. 
A. Cyber-Physiscal System Performance 
The FPGA system implementation with 16 bio-signals 
inputs and 25 outputs requires 81.7% ALMs (arithmetic 
logic module), 44808 ALUTs, 73.4% registers, 10.3% block 
memory of the available resources.  FPGA results present a 
mean relative error of 0.01% if compared with Matlab 
outcomes on the same dataset. The most power hungry part 
of the system is the FFT. In a 180nm CMOS ASIC, a 16bit 
butterfly 256 points FFT at 4MHz would consume about 
13mW during continuous operation including block RAM, 
which at 4MHz would consume approximately 1mW [27]. 
B. Experimental Results: Gait Analysis 
For the gait analysis, the subjects are asked to perform a 
natural and fluid walk. The results are summarized in table  
I, which reports, from the top of the table, the failure rate of 
the EMG trigger generation, maximum, typical and 
number/second 
co-contractions, 
limb 
muscles 
activation/deactivation and their ratio (duty cycle) during a 
single step. Table I distinctly shows the parameters for PD 
and healthy subjects. The results quantify the differences 
between the PD and the healthy subjects in terms of walking 
patterns.   
i. The EMG trigger failure rate to detect EMG contraction is 
only 0.07% (worst-case).   
ii. The Haste rate (HR), defined as number of co-
contractions (ccs) per second, is 1.17 ccs/s for the PD 
subject against 0.44 ccs/s for a healthy subject: co-
contractions are more frequent in PD than the healthy.  
iii. Typical co-contraction times show an increase of 58ms 
(average value on all the four muscles couples) between PD 
subject and healthy one with greater incidence on the right 
leg (Δt=+120ms on R.Gast-R. Tib and Δt=+90ms on R. Bic 
– R. Rect): the co-contraction times are, on average, higher 
in PD than the healthy during gait.  
iv. The maximum co-contraction time for the PD subject is 
higher for all the muscles if compared with the healthy 
subject (e.g. PD Max= 756ms and Healthy Max=548ms on 
L. Rect-L. Bic). The maximum co-contraction time is higher 
in PD than the healthy during gait. 
v. On single muscle, PD subject shows contraction times 
that cover, on average, the 48.56% of the step time length. 
The healthy subject returns a value of 33.62%. The PD 
outlines muscular hyperactivity during gait. During normal 
gait, no significant differences on MRPs were found. 
Indeed, both subjects present a BP that ranges from 58-65 
dBµ, µ-rhythm ranges from 51-55 dBµ and β-rhythm 
sweeps between 41-44 dBµ. However, considering the BP, 
evident differences have been highlighted in both subjects 
between the state of resting and the time slot preceding the 
step. Considering the healthy subject, in the resting state the 
BP mean value was 49±4.6 dBμ while before a step the BP 
mean value reached 60.8±6.4 dBμ (see Fig. 5). The 
difference of the walking patterns is also evident from the 
diagram presented in Fig. 6, on which is reported a BP vs. 
co-contraction times plot for PD (in blue) and healthy (in 
red) subjects is shown. For clarity, the shown co-contraction 
times are computed on the left gastrocnemius/tibialis pair 
while the shown BP are referred to the right-motor

channels average. The analysis demonstrates that, while for 
the MRPs similar results are obtained for both subjects, the 
co-contractions for the PD subject are more frequent and 
reach values much higher in comparison with the healthy 
subject. In Fig. 7, a comparison between the EEG spectra 
computed before a voluntary movement (in blue) and before 
an involuntary movement (in red) are compared. The spectra 
are normalized. Considering the bands of interest (BP, µ and 
β), the power computed in the BP band during a voluntary 
movement is more than 100 times higher than the one 
calculated during an involuntary one. Similarly, the µ and β 
powers are about 10 times higher during a voluntary 
movement. 
C. Experimental Results: Pull Test    
The postural stability is tested in specialized centers by 
the “pull test” protocol [26].  During this test, the 
neurologist gives a moderately forceful backwards tug on 
the standing individual and observes how the person 
recovers his stability. The normal response is one or more 
quick backwards steps to prevent a fall. Usually during this 
test, the physician associates a numeric index basing on the 
subject response. Using the proposed cyber-physical system, 
we were able to quantify the instability of the subject and 
his intentionality in the stability recovery by MRPs. Pull test 
results for both PD and healthy subjects are summarized in 
Table II, which includes MRPs for both right ( R) and left 
(L) EEG channels and the maximum co-contraction value 
reached. The EMG triggers analysis highlights that, when 
the sudden unbalancing is externally induced from the 
operator, PD subject reacted with four step. Two of these 
are backward, while two forward, until complete settling. 
The healthy subject reacted to the unbalancing with a single 
settling step. PD subject co-contractions in pull test 
increase, on average, of 98.75ms in comparison with gait’s 
values. The healthy subject co-contraction values show no 
relevant change with an increase of 11.75ms. The PD 
subject co-contraction maximum value was 1.06s and was 
recorded on right biceps-rectus Femoralis. The MRPs have 
an interesting behavior when the sudden unbalancing 
happens. For the PD subject, MRPs increase their initial 
value (that sweep between 59.9-62.8dBµ) of 6.5dBµ on 
right EEG channels and 6dBµ on left ones. The increase is 
distributed over the steps showing the recovery of 
voluntariness during the movements. The healthy subject 
showed an initial range of 56.4-58.4dBµ and reached 64.2 
dBµ (increase of 7.8 dBµ) and 69.2dBµ (increase of 7.8 
dBµ) on left and right EEG channels respectively. The 
MRPs evolution during a single entire pull test for the PD 
subject is presented in Fig.  8. When the unbalance is 
externally induced, the recorded MRPs values are 
comparable to the resting values. However, in the 
subsequent recovery steps the MRPs increase both on right 
(ΔBP = +11.9% ; Δµ =5.5% ; Δβ = + 11.1%) and left (ΔBP 
= +14.3% ;  Δµ = +8.8% ; Δβ = +2.2%) EEG channels.

CONCLUSION  
In this work, a cyber-physical system for gait analysis 
and fall risk evaluation has been presented. EEG/EMG 
wireless nodes for real-time synchronous data collection 
make up the system.  The system is able to evaluate 
different indexes, in order to establish the coupling between 
brain activity and movement, leading to the assessment of 
the intentionality level of a muscle contraction. An FPGA

(Altera Cyclone V) implementation, including test and 
validation of the system has been presented. The FPGA 
results show low residual numerical error (0.012%) if 
compared to Matlab ones and the maximum power 
consumption is of about 150mW. A further stage of 
semantic 
matchmaking 
collects, 
interprets 
and 
contextualizes the processed data. In this article, the system 
has been tested on a subject affected by the Parkinson’s 
syndrome and on a healthy subject performing a natural gait 
and pull tests [28]. The system is able to detect critical 
conditions in 168ms (data collection: 14ms; data processing: 
42ms; reasoning: 12ms; feedback: 100ms), within the 
300ms, i.e., the standard time limit to avoid the fall [23].
