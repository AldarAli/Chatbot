Abstract—In this paper, we propose a new method of patent 
analysis for technology foresight by using patent co-citation 
clustering, technology life cycle theory, and Logistic model and 
apply it in the field of remote sensing. Firstly, the co-citation 
clustering method is used to analyze patents about remote 
sensing, which can visually show the distribution of patents 
and select the core patents groups with strong co-citation 
relationship that represents the technical groups in this field. 
Through the analysis of the clusters, 8 main technical 
directions are obtained. Then, we search patents again for the 
main technical directions, and use the technology life cycle 
theory and Logistic model to analyze and forecast the  future 
development trend of technology. According to the analysis, 
the remote sensing technologies are found that have passed 
through a long period of germination. Among them, "remote 
sensing image processing technology in later period" is in the 
growing stage, which is being developed rapidly. The 
technologies related to "remote sensing imaging equipment" 
and "remote sensing image initial processing" are becoming 
mature. Based on these analyses, some suggestions on the 
future development, application direction and industrial 
prospects of remote sensing technologies are advocated. 
Keywords—Remote sensing; Patent co-citation analysis;

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Remote sensing technology is a comprehensive detecting 
technology, 
which 
uses 
modern 
optics 
and 
electronics detection apparatus to detect and record the 
characteristics of the electromagnetic wave of the remote 
target without contacting. By analyzing and interpreting the 
characteristics, properties and changing pattern of the target 
are revealed. The basic principle is that the characteristics of 
electromagnetic wave of different objects are different, and 
by detecting the reflection of electromagnetic wave and the 
electromagnetic wave emitted by the object, the information 
of the object is extracted, which can help to identify the 
remote objects [1]. 
Remote sensing technology has the characteristics of 
large detection range, high speed of data acquisition, short 
cycle and is rarely subject to ground conditions, which can 
be widely used in military and civilian areas, such as military 
reconnaissance, military mapping, marine monitoring, 
meteorological observation, vegetation classification, land 
utilization planning, etc. The application of remote sensing 
technology to a certain field can improve the information 
decision support ability and the competitiveness to get more 
benefits [2]. At present, with the rapid development of 
aviation, space and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 
technology, remote sensing technology has entered the 
commercial application stage, and has great potentials for 
development and application. Therefore, it is very important 
to carry out the remote sensing technology foresight to make 
clear the technology development trend. It will be helpful to 
realize the new breakthrough of remote sensing technology, 
and gradually take the advantageous position in the 
development of industrial technology. It will have a 
profound impact on improving the level of social 
information, promoting sustainable economic development, 
improving people's living quality, and enhancing public 
safety and national defense [3].  
The importance of technology foresight is gradually 
realized, but it’s a very difficult work because that 
technological development is a complicated process, which 
is influenced by many factors, such as science, economy, 
society and so on. Technology foresight requires a 
comprehensive set of methods. At present, the activities of  
technology foresight around the world mainly adopts the 
methods based on experts’ opinions such as Delphi and  
workshops. Some other methods are Scenario analysis and 
Technology Roadmap. The objective and quantitative 
research methods for technology foresight are quite few. In 
some studies, the literature bibliometrics is introduced, 
which is a quantitative tool of technology foresight [4]. In 
this paper, we propose a method of patent analysis to make 
technology foresight of remote sensing. This method is based 
on the patent data and can use them for efficient clustering 
and intuitive display. It can be used as a new quantitative 
tool in the specific aspects of technology foresight. It can 
play the role of reference, support and verification in 
technology foresight, and improve the scientificalness and 
objectivity of the research. 
In this paper, a study on the patents of remote sensing 
field is carried out, in which the main technical directions 
and the patent life cycle in the remote sensing field are 
analyzed by the method of co-citation clustering and Logistic

study, including patent co-citation analysis, LinLog 
visualization clustering method, and S-curve Technology 
Life Cycle Forecasting method, and introduce the database 
we use. In the Section 3, we carry out an empirical study in 
the field of remote sensing, which prove the validity of the 
method. In the Section 4, we draw some conclusions and 
look forward to the future works. 
II. 
RESEARCH METHODS & DATA SOURCE 
A. Patent Co-citation Clustering Analysis 
Co-citation is that two or more patents are all cited by the 
same patent. Generally, patents with co-citation relationship 
have certain correlation in content. The more frequently 
patents are co-cited; the more similar they are [5]. However, 
it is not comprehensive to measure the related strength only 
with the total number of co-citations. When basic patents 
both have large number of citations, they are more likely to 
be co-cited, which can’t mean they’re more similar. In this 
paper, (1) is adopted[6] to express the related strength of 
patent I and patent J—Cij: 

Nj
Ni
Nij
Cij



In (1), Nij represents the number of co-citations of patent 
I and patent J; Ni and Nj respectively represent the number of 
citations of patent I and patent J. 
After the calculation of the relationship between patents, 
we cluster patents according to their related strength. Some 
scholars have taken some research on document co-citation 
clustering. Reference [7] introduced the citation contexts in 
document clustering, which can  increase the effectiveness of 
the bag-of-words representation. Reference [8] used co-
citation cluster analysis to propose a knowledge-transfer 
analysis model. Reference [9] used Girvan-Newman 
algorithm in the patent co-citation clustering to identify the 
main technologies of Apple Corp. 
This paper uses the LinLog visualization clustering 
method to cluster the patents, and explore the main technical 
directions of the remote sensing field. LinLog model, which 
is proposed by Noack Andreas in 2007, is a kind of force-
directed algorithm based on the energy function, which can 
show a good clustering effect to a large number of nodes 
[10]. This algorithm applies the idea of mechanics to the 
layout of the graph, which assumes that a repulsion force 
exists between any two nodes, and a pulling force exists 
between the nodes which are related. The starting positions 
of nodes are random, and then each node can adjust its 
position according to the repulsion force and pulling force 
from the other nodes, until the pulling force and the 
repulsion force reach equilibrium [11]. Obviously, any two 
nodes will not overlap due to the existing repulsion forces, 
and the related nodes will be close to each other under the 
pulling force. Each cluster represents a group of patents with 
strong 
co-citation 
relationships, 
which 
have 
strong 
correlation and represent a technical direction in this field. 
B. S-curve Technology Forecasting and Logistic Model 
Verhulst proposed the growth model in 1938[12]. 
According to this model(Figure1), the growth process of the 
technology is similar to that of human, and it can be 
experienced in the germination stage, growing stage, mature 
stage and decline stage. In the germination stage, the growth 
is slow; the growing stage is  a period of rapid growth; after 
growing stage, it enters the mature stage, in which the 
development is slow; finally reaches the limit and enters the 
decline stage. The fitting curve of the process is called the 
growth curve, and because of its S shape, it is called S-curve 
[13]. 
 
The equation of the S curve is the Logistic model [14], as 
the Eq. (2) shows: 
e T
l
y



 1

In the equation, y is the number of patent accumulation; α 
is the slope of the S curve, which is the growth rate of the S 
curve; β is the time point of the turning point (midpoint) in 
the growth curve; l is the saturation level of growth, that is, 
the saturation point (saturation); [l×10%, l×90%] is the time 
required for the growth and maturity. 
The meaning of three parameters are as follows: 
(1)saturation: the maximum utility value generated by using 
a technique, that is, the highest value of the number of patent 
accumulation; (2)growth time: the time needed for producing 
the 10%~90% of the maximum utility value of a technology, 
i.e., the time needed for the period of growth and maturity; 
(3)midpoint: anti curve point of S-curve, that is, the 0 value 
point for two differential. These three parameters can be 
automatically calculated by the system. It is necessary to 
point out that the S curve model is a theoretical model of 
technology development, which does not take into account 
the influence of external factors that may bring changes to 
technological development. If there are some new emerging 
disruptive technologies or other changing factors, using S-
curve to estimate the technology life cycle may cause some

errors. In this paper, we only roughly estimate the 
technology life cycle, and the results also need to be 
corrected by the experts in technical field. 
C. Data Source 
In this study, the number of patent accumulation in the 
field of remote sensing around the world represents the 
development level of technology. The patents about remote 
sensing are retrieved by the patent retrieval tool—TI 
(Thomson innovation), which has the world’s largest patent 
database, including patents from the United States, European 
countries, Japan, South Korea and so on, also containing the 
DOCdb (INPADOC) database and the Derwent World 
Patents Index (DWPI) database [15]. We use all the patents 
about remote sensing which were published before October 
15, 2015 as the data source to research the technology 
development status of remote sensing industry. 
III. 
TECHNOLOGY FORESIGHT OF  REMOTE SENSING 
Based on about 5027 patents related to remote sensing 
technology, we use the patent co-citation clustering method 
to cluster the patents, and get the current main technical 
directions of remote sensing. Then, we retrieve patents for 
the selected technical directions again, use the Logistic 
model to carry out the technology life cycle analysis and 
forecast the development trend of the remote sensing 
technology in the future. 
A. Main Technical Directions of remote sensing 
Get the first 30% of the highest cited patents in each year 
for co-citation clustering and visualization. Figure 2 is the 
patent co-citation clustering map. In this map, each cluster of 
nodes represents a patents group in which every patent is 
related to each other. It can represent a certain technical 
direction or a theme in the field. The number of nodes in a 
cluster represents the number of core patents contained in the 
technical direction. Also, it can represent people's attention 
to the technical direction in some way. Node's size represents 
patent’s cited frequency; the greater the node is the higher 
the cited frequency is. Some different clusters may have 
similar topics, so we need to understand each cluster by 
manual analysis and summarize the main technical directions. 
Through the analysis of patents in the all clusters, we can 
draw the technical direction of each patents group (marked in 
the picture). 
According to the patent co-citation clustering, in this 
paper 8 main technical directions in the remote sensing field 
from the perspective of patent application are summarized as 
follows: (1) "Fusion method of remote sensing image"; (2) 
"registration and correlation method of remote sensing

image"; (3) "object recognition and feature extraction 
method of remote sensing image"; (4) "changes detection 
method of remote sensing image"; (5) "remote sensing 
temperature measurement, inversion method"; (6) "imaging 
spectrometer & spectral imaging devices"; (7) "synthetic 
aperture radar/SAR"; (8) "Microwave remote sensor". 
 
 
Figure 3.  Logistic model of each technical direction. 
B. Results of Technical Life Cycle Analysis 
According to the Logistic model, we analyze the number 
of patent applications in the field of remote sensing. The 
growth curves of 8 technical directions are shown in Figure 3,  
which are fitted out by Loglet Lab2 [16]. The relevant 
parameters of Logistic Model are shown in Table I. 
Taking "Fusion method of remote sensing image" as an 
example, the S curve and its implication are analyzed. From 
the beginning of 2003, there have been patents applications 
about remote sensing image fusion method. The system 
estimates that the growing stage needs 12 years, and the 
turning point will occur in 2018. Patent applications 
continued to grow until 2012, this period is the germination 
stage; then the technology goes into the growing stage until 
2018, this period presents a trend of accelerated growth; 
from 2019 to 2025, patents about remote sensing image 
fusion show slow growth trend, but the total amount is still 
increasing, this period is mature stage; after this, patent 
growth will fall into recession, and the number of patents 
shows a decreasing trend.

According to the method above, the S-curves of the 8 
main technical directions are analyzed, and the distribution 
of their technical life cycle is obtained, as shown in TableⅡ. 
As can be seen in Table 1, from the perspective of patent, the 
8 main technical directions in remote sensing have been 
through the germination stage. Among them, the technical 
directions in the growing stage are: (1) "Fusion method of 
remote sensing image"; (3) "object recognition and feature 
extraction method of remote sensing image"; (4) "changes 
detection method of remote sensing image"; (5) "remote 
sensing temperature measurement, inversion method"; (8) 
"Microwave remote sensor"; the technical directions in the 
mature stage are: (2) "registration and correlation method of 
remote sensing image"; (6) "imaging spectrometer & spectral 
imaging devices"; (7) "synthetic aperture radar/SAR". 
It can be seen from the above data that remote sensing 
technologies have passed the stage of basic research, and 
most of the key technologies are in the stage of rapid growth. 
Technologies about "remote sensing imaging equipment" 
and "remote sensing image initial processing" are becoming 
mature.  At present and in the near future, the key point of 
remote sensing technology development is the object-
oriented, the demand-oriented, the high speed, efficient and 
automatic remote sensing image processing technology in 
later perid.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK. 
A. Conclusions 
In this paper, we cluster more than 5000 patents related 
to remote sensing with the patent co-citation clustering 
method, and summary 8 main technical directions in this 
field as follows: (1) "Fusion method of remote sensing 
image"; (2) "registration and correlation method of remote 
sensing image"; (3) "object recognition and feature 
extraction method of remote sensing image"; (4) "changes 
detection method of remote sensing image"; (5) "remote 
sensing temperature measurement, inversion method"; (6) 
"imaging spectrometer & spectral imaging devices"; (7) 
"synthetic aperture radar/SAR"; (8) "Microwave remote 
sensor". Then, we retrieve patents for the selected technical 
directions again and use the Logistic model to carry out the 
technology life cycle analysis. Based on the analysis result,  
the distribution of their technical life cycle is obtained. It is 
cleared that 3 technical directions related to "remote sensing 
imaging equipment" and "remote sensing image initial 
processing" are becoming mature and other 5 directions 
related to “remote sensing image processing technology in 
later period” are in the stage of rapid growth. 
With the results of technology life cycle analysis, we 
analyze the patents’ contents of each group deeply and make 
the following conclusions: 
(1) Remote sensing technologies have passed the stage of 
basic research. Technologies related to "remote sensing 
imaging equipment" and "remote sensing image initial 
processing" are becoming mature.  At present and in the near 
future, the key point of remote sensing technology 
development is the object-oriented, the demand-oriented, the 
high speed, efficient and automatic remote sensing image 
processing technology in later period. 
(2) In early times, remote sensing technology was applied 
to the static object recognition, such as forest vegetation 
cover, coastline, airports, roads, bridges and so on. With the 
remote sensing technology being developed to “high 
temporal resolution”, “high spatial resolution”, and “wide 
scale”, the application of remote sensing is going towards 
disaster monitoring, sea state monitoring, ship target 
detecting, digital city, and so on. 
(3) Patent applications related to remote sensing are in a 
rapid growth trend. The main technical directions of remote 
sensing are also in the growing stage, and nearly half of them 
are tending to be mature. Remote sensing patent applicants 
from the early military and scientific research institutions 
gradually extended to individuals and business organizations. 
The application range of remote sensing is from the early 
military, government to civilian, commercial. This shows 
that it is a good opportunity for the business development of 
remote sensing technology and the promotion of its 
industrialization. Remote sensing technology will have broad 
prospects for industrial development. 
B. Future Works 
(1) Extending data sources of technology foresight 
In this paper, patent database is used as the data source of 
the technology foresight, which can include most of the 
research results from practical technical inventions around 
the world. However, there may be some time lags because it 
usually needs 2-3 years for a patent from the application to 
the general public. And if the patent search strategy is not 
complete, it will cause the research results to be not 
comprehensive. In addition to patents, there are also other 
kinds of technical information that are valuable and 
significant to the study on the future development trend of 
science and technology, such as literatures, business news, 
reports from the authoritative research institutions. In the 
future, we can make technology foresight using the 
combination of multi-source data, such as combining patents 
and scientific literature. Then we can use data mining to find 
the similarities and differences in the path of development 
from different perspectives, and search for the future 
potential technology opportunities. 
(2) Combining the clustering analysis and text mining 
This paper uses LinLog algorithm to realize the patent 
co-citation clustering analysis and visualization, but the 
analysis of clusters’ contents is hand finished, resulting in a 
larger workload. In the future, the text mining method can be 
introduced in the analysis of the clustering results, which can 
automatically show the technical direction of each cluster. 
(3) Combining patent analysis and experts’ opinions 
In most of the current technology foresight activities, 
patent analysis and experts’ opinions can not effectively 
combine. In the future works, we can carry out some expert 
investigations before the patent analysis, so that we are able 
to conduct a patent analysis or other quantitative analysis on 
issues that the experts are more concerned about. On the 
other hand, due to the development of science and 
technology involves many other issues, such as issues about 
economy and society, it is very complicated. The 
conclusions from patent analysis also need to be submitted to 
the experts for further analysis and study, in order to play the 
better role for technology foresight.
