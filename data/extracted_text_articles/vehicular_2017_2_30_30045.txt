Abstract—Increasingly, vehicles will be equipped with information
and communication technologies, e.g., wireless communication
technologies like IEEE 802.11x (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, mobile com-
munication, etc. These communication technologies enable iden-
tiﬁcation based on identiﬁer used in communication protocols.
Today, the Vehicle Identiﬁcation Number, and the license plate
are regarded as vehicle identiﬁer. With new communication
technologies used in modern vehicles secondary vehicle identiﬁer
comes up. This paper analyzes identiﬁcation of vehicles based on
wireless communication interfaces and presents results of ﬁrst
real measurements of vehicular Bluetooth and Wi-Fi interfaces.
Keywords–Vehicle Identiﬁcation; Vehicle Identiﬁer; Wireless
Vehicle Interfaces; Privacy; Vehicle Tracking

INTRODUCTION
The IT architecture of vehicles has signiﬁcantly changed
during the last 10 years. This is shown by the increasingly
availability of components for driving assistance: lane keeping
support, trafﬁc jam assist, automatic parking assistant, remote
parking assistant and so on. This is a prestage of automatic
driving, which is one of the main challenges in automotive
engineering at the moment. Besides driving assistance, modern
vehicles are equipped with wireless interfaces, e.g., Bluetooth
to connect devices (smart phones, tablets, etc.) to the multi-
media component (head-unit) of the vehicle. In addition, head-
units are more and more able to establish a Wi-Fi hot spot to
support internet access for vehicle passengers. Furthermore,
the vehicle-2-vehicle communication technology (V2V) will
be deployed based on IEEE 802.11p technology in the near
future. V2V is one feature of Intelligent Transport Systems
(ITS).
Today, only the Vehicle Identiﬁcation Number (VIN), and
the license plate are regarded and used as ofﬁcial vehicle
identiﬁer. This paper analyses vehicle identiﬁcation capabilities
of wireless communication interfaces, ﬁrst, which can be used
for vehicle identiﬁcation and tracking. Next, ﬁrst results of
enforced measurements of vehicular Bluetooth interfaces and
vehicular Wi-Fi hotspots are presented. The communication
interfaces are built in the vehicle to support communication
services for occupants. But we show that these services are
available outside the vehicle and can be misused for unau-
thorized identiﬁcation and tracking. We only use cheap mea-
surement equipment (partially open source), which is publicly
available. Especially, the applied smart phone measurement
apps can be used by everyone with every modern Android
compatible device for identiﬁcation of vehicles based on
Bluetooth. The analysis of Secondary Vehicle Identiﬁer based
on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi features is quite new and published
here, ﬁrst.
The subsequent sections of this paper are organized as fol-
lows: Section II is a description of related work. Subsequently,
identiﬁers for ITS vehicle stations are presented in Section
III. Section IV describes implemented wireless technologies in
modern vehicles and analyzes identiﬁcation capabilities. Aim
of the performed tests, used test equipment and investigated
test vehicles are presented in Section V. Results of real
measurements of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi identiﬁer are given in
Section VI. Finally, we summarize our results, and mention
open research issues.

RELATED WORK
A classiﬁcation of vehicle identiﬁer is given in [1], which
is applied in this paper, too. Hwajeng et al. supposed a vehicle
identiﬁcation and tracking system based on optical vehicle
plate number recognition [2]. Tracking of devices based on
Bluetooth interfaces is already discussed for a lot of applica-
tions, e.g., indoor localization [3] or wireless indoor tracking
[4]. But only in [5], an analysis in Jacksonville, Florida,
to capture vehicle trafﬁc streams is described. Therefore, a
set of Bluetooth receivers was located at the roadside on
speciﬁc streets to capture the Bluetooth MAC ID of crossing
vehicles. Besides Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 compliant devices
were suggested for real-time location tracking in indoor and
outdoor environments [6].
Since the 1th of November 2014, vehicles and motorhomes
have to be equipped with a Tire Pressure Monitoring System
(TPMS) within Europe. They can be separated in direct and
indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS means that speciﬁc physical
sensors measure the air pressure of the tires. These sensors
communicate wireless with the vehicle and transmit an iden-
tiﬁer of 28 to 32 bit length. There are different wireless
technologies available for 125 kHz, 315 kHz, and 433 MHz.

A detection range of up to 40 m for direct TPMS is mentioned
in [7].
Besides the identiﬁcation of vehicles based on static iden-
tiﬁers used in communication protocols different feature based
identiﬁcation methods are suggested. One approach is the
identiﬁcation of vehicles based on noise features (individual
noise spectrum) [8].
Further identiﬁcation techniques allow wireless devices
to be identiﬁed by unique characteristics of their analog
(radio) circuitry; this type of identiﬁcation is also referred to
as physical-layer device identiﬁcation. It is possible due to
hardware imperfections in the analog circuitry of transmitter
introduced at the manufacturing process. A good overview
concerning the physical ﬁngerprinting of different wireless
communication technologies is given in [9].

ITS VEHICLE IDENTIFIER
Here, we categorize the available identiﬁers of vehicles
into two classes. Primary vehicle identiﬁer represent such
identiﬁers which will be typically regarded today, e.g., the
Vehicle Identiﬁcation Number (VIN). Secondary Vehicle Iden-
tiﬁer come up with new information technologies used in
modern vehicles.
A. Primary Vehicle Identiﬁer
To date, each vehicle is identiﬁable based on the distinct
VIN. In some areas, the VIN is integrated as human readable
information in the windscreen of vehicles.
Besides the VIN, vehicles are marked with a licence plate,
which is already used for identiﬁcation.
With the deployment of the V2V technology vehicles will
be equipped with a long term ECC key pair and an appropriate
certiﬁcate [10] [11]. This certiﬁcate will become an additional
primary vehicle identiﬁer.
B. Secondary Vehicle Identiﬁer
Modern vehicles are equipped with multi-media compo-
nents (head-unit), which are able to establish communications
with electronic devices of drivers or passengers. Typically,
wireless communication technologies, e.g., Bluetooth, are used
for that purpose.
A Bluetooth multi-media device emits a static 48 bit MAC
identiﬁer. The MAC ID is composed of two parts: the ﬁrst
half is assigned to the manufacturer of the device, and the
second half is assigned to the speciﬁc device. In addition,
each Bluetooth device emits a “User-friendly-name” which is
typically alterable. Bluetooth devices operate in the ISM band
(2.4 to 2.485 GHz).
Moreover, vehicle head-units allow any Wi-Fi equipped
laptop, tablet or mobile phone to access the internet within
the ITS vehicle station while travelling if the head-unit has
mobile communications capabilities. But head-units conﬁgured
as access point need a unique Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID) or
network name to connect devices. In addition, each head-unit
needs an unique MAC address.
If vehicles are equipped with mobile communication ca-
pabilities an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)
is required. That is an unique ID to identify a mobile device
within the network. In addition, a SIM card with an assigned
mobile phone number is needed for mobile communication.
In [9], physical ﬁngerprinting of wireless transmitter is
investigated. So, a complete feature set for physical ﬁnger-
printing of a transmitter is a secondary vehicle identiﬁer. So far
mentioned vehicle identiﬁers are sufﬁcient for identiﬁcation all
the time. Furthermore, vehicle identiﬁer with a limited validity
period, e.g., pseudonymous certiﬁcates (termed authorization
tickets by ETSI) exist. Pseudonymous certiﬁcates come up
with the V2V technology.
Initially, secondary vehicle identiﬁer have no formal char-
acter in contrast to a licence plate or VIN. But it is technically
very easy to capture Bluetooth and Wi-Fi identiﬁers of a
vehicle shown in Section VI. So, attackers can misuse them
for their purposes.
IV.
WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES
Here in this section wireless technologies, which are ap-
plied in vehicles are described, ﬁrst. In addition an anal-
ysis concerning identiﬁcation capabilities based on wireless
communication technologies is given. We only address local
wireless communication technologies, which are quite easy to
detect and omit mobile communications like GSM, LTE, or
5G.
A. Bluetooth
The concept behind Bluetooth is to provide a universal
short-range wireless communication capability using the 2.4
GHz band, available globally for unlicensed low-power uses.
Bluetooth is speciﬁed by the Bluetooth special interest group
[12].
1) Technology: Bluetooth provides support for three appli-
cation areas using short-range wireless connectivity:
•
Data and voice access points: Bluetooth facilitates
real-time voice and data transmissions by providing
effortless wireless connection of portable and station-
ary communications devices
•
Cable replacement: Bluetooth eliminates the need for
numerous, often proprietary cable attachments for
connection of practically any kind of communication
devices. The range of each radio depends on the output
power (up to 100 m)
•
Ad hoc networking: A device equipped with a Blue-
tooth radio can establish instant connection to another
Bluetooth radio as soon as it comes into range
In vehicles Bluetooth is used for connecting a smart phone
to the:
•
Hands-free phone system
•
Vehicular head-unit to use the loudspeaker of the head-
unit to output the music from the smart phone
The Bluetooth architecture is divided into different layers.
It starts with the Radio Frequency (RF) Layer, also termed
physical layer (PHY). To be resistant to disturbance a fre-
quency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is used. Bluetooth
devices operate in the ISM band (2.4 to 2.485 GHz). This
frequency range is divided into channels of a bandwidth of
1 MHz. There are 79 useable channels. Three classes of
transceivers are available with different output power: 1 mW,
2,5 mW and 100 mW.
At ﬁrst, Bluetooth devices have to establish a connection,
termed pairing, to exchange data. This procedure is initiated

by the master device based on the inquiry process. During this
process Bluetooth devices respond with inquiry reply messages
including BD ADDR and clock rate (CLK), etc. During the
pairing process the jump sequence for sharing the channels
is calculated by the master device and synchronized with the
slave devices.
There exist a range of Bluetooth versions from Bluetooth
1.0a (published 1999) to Bluetooth 5.0 (published 2016).
2) Identiﬁcation Capabilities: A Bluetooth multi-media
device emits a static 48 bit MAC identiﬁer (BD ADDR). The
MAC ID is composed of three parts: Lower Address Part
(LAP), Upper Address Part (UAP), and Nonsigniﬁcant Address
Part (NAP). LAP (24 bit) and UAP (8 bit) are assigned to the
manufacturer of the device, and NAP (16 bit) is assigned to
the speciﬁc device. In addition, each Bluetooth device emits a
“User-friendly-name” which is typically alterable. BD ADDR
and the “User-friendly-name” are the primary identiﬁer. In
addition, the data set of a Bluetooth device: CLK, Bluetooth
device proﬁle, and the Host Controller Interface (HCI) can be
used for identiﬁcation purposes, too (Table I).
B. Wireless Local Area Network (Wi-Fi)
Primary, Wi-Fi is based on the communication standards
which was made for cable based Local Area Networks (LAN),
IEEE 802.11 X.
1) Technology: Brieﬂy spoken, Wi-Fi devices support two
different modes:
•
Ad-Hoc mode, termed independent BSS (IBSS): Wi-
Fi devices communicate peer-to-peer. During the com-
munication data pakets are send to all devices of the
network but discarded by the devices if the destination
address does not ﬁt
•
Access point mode, termed Basic Service Set (BSS):
All Wi-Fi devices are connected with the access point
(hot spot)
Head-units of modern vehicles provide Wi-Fi hot spots. So
any Wi-Fi equipped laptop, tablet or mobile phone is able to
access the internet within the vehicle while travelling if the
head-unit has mobile communication facilities (GSM, LTE).
Different Wi-Fi Standards exist: IEEE 802.11b / g / a / n /
ac. They differ in the used frequency band (2,4 GHz and/or 5
GHz), and communication speed (1 Mbit/s ...6,96 Gbit/s). The
frequency band is splitted into channels (2,4 GHz: 13 channels
with a bandwidth of 5 MHz, whereby 5 channels are needed
to establish a network). In the 5 GHz frequency band a 455
MHz frequency bandwidth is reserved for Wi-Fi to establish
18 different Wi-Fi networks.
One of the management frames in IEEE 802.11 based
Wi-Fis are beacon frames. Beacon frames are transmitted
periodically to announce the presence of a wireless LAN
and contain information about the network. Beacon frames
are transmitted by the access point in an infrastructure basic
service set (BSS). In IBSS network beacon generation is
distributed among the stations.
2) Identiﬁcation Capabilities: Primary identiﬁer are:
•
Basic Service Set ID (BSSID) or MAC address of the
Wi-Fi device and

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS
In this section the test results of the performed tests are
desribed.
A. Bluetooth Measurements for the Octavia (and partly Pas-
sat)
1) Test Case 1: As test equipment a Lenovo ThinkPad
X201, with Ubertooth One, Ubertooth-Specan-Ui and standard
antenna is used. Measurements are performed at one position
inside and 8 positions outside the vehicle. The positions and
results are plotted in Figure 1. As we expected, the highest
signal strength of -30 dBm has been detected inside the
vehicle. But also outside the vehicle, a strong signal strengh
has been measured.
2) Test Case 2: As test equipment a Lenovo ThinkPad
X201, with Ubertooth One, Ubertooth-Specan-Ui and different
antennas is used: Standard antenna, LogPer antenna and direc-
tional antenna WIFI-LINK WAVEGUIDE. The test results are
presented in Table II. With all antennas the Bluetooth signal
can always be detected, within a distance of 21 m.
3) Test Case 3: The Bluetooth module of the head-unit
starts with scanning of Bluetooth devices which were already
paired in the past and are registered in the pairing list of the
head-unit after starting the ignition. Scanning is switched off
after the deactivation of the ignition and removal of the key.

4) Test Case 4: First, as test equipment a Samsung Galaxy
S6 with the Bluetooth scanner app is utilised. Figure 2 presents
the test setting. The following information about the Bluetooth
device of the head-unit can be captured with the mentioned test
equipment:

AUDIO VIDEO HANDSFREE
Scan
Cycle 199
( 2 0 . 1 1 . 1 6

SSID “Skoda TF”, BSSID “00:17:CA:D9:6B:77”, the service
“AUDIO VIDEO HANDSFREE” and the “Scan Cycle 199
(20.11.16 15:01)” with date were captured. These information
are readable up to a distance of 24 m (signal strength at this
distance: -83 dBm) (it has to be mentioned that the owner of
the Skoda Octavia has already altered its SSID. “Skoda TF”
is not the factory setting).
The following information are captured from the Bluetooth
device of the head-unit of the Passat up to a distance of 12 m
(signal strength at this distance: -84 dBm):
VW BT 2058

From a privacy perspective it is remarkable, that the name of
the automaker is part of the SSID and that the number part
“2058” of the SSID is chosen from the VIN of the Passat.
Next, as test equipment Lenovo ThinkPad X201, Ubertooth
One with Ubertooth-RX is used to perform the same test case.
Subsequent information can be captured if the test equipment
is switched on and a Samsung Galaxy S6 will be connected
to the Octavia head-unit:

B. Wi-Fi Measurements for the Opel Insignia (partly Opel
Astra)
1) Test Case 1: As test equipment a Lenovo ThinkPad
T400, TP-Link TL-WN722N with standard antenna, and
LinSSID is used. The signal strength of the Wi-Fi access point
(Wi-Fi-AP) has been measured at 8 ﬁx point outside and at 1
point inside the vehicle. The positions are equal to the Blue-
tooth test case. But in contrast to the Bluetooth measurement,
the distance between the vehicle and the measurement tool is
5 m. The results for the Opel Insignia are plotted in Figure 4.
As we expected, the highest signal strength of -22 dBm has
been detected inside the vehicle. But also outside the vehicle,
a strong signal strengh has been measured.
2) Test Case 2: As test equipment a Lenovo ThinkPad
T400, TP-Link TL-WN722N with standard antenna, and
LinSSID on the one side and Samsung S7, and Wiﬁ-Analyzer
on the other side are used. With the TP-Link TL-WN722 and
Figure 5. Radiation characteristic of the Opel Insignia Wi-Fi device
the Samsung S7 the signal strenght are measured in ascending
distances to the vehicle, in direction to the right front door.
The results are plotted in Figure 5. Only little differences in
signal strength can be detected between an active connection
and a non connection of a client to the Wi-Fi-AP of the Opel
Insignia. The measurement sensitivity of the smart phone is
about 10 dBm lower for distances greater 10 m in contrast to
the measurements with the TP-Link. With both measurement
devices the signal of the Wi-Fi-AP can always be detected,
within a distance of 60 m.
3) Test Case 3: As test equipment a Lenovo ThinkPad
T400, TP-Link TL-WN722N with standard antenna, and
LinSSID is used.
General Motor and Opel provide vehicle online connectiv-
ity based on the OnStar service. Only if the OnStar service is
enabled the Wi-Fi-AP of the Opel Insignia can be switched
on. The Wi-Fi transmitter is activated, when the ignition is
started and deactivated when the key is removed from the
ignition lock. An enabling or disabling of the Wi-Fi-AP is
not possible by the driver, with the usage of the conﬁguration
menu implemented in the vehicle (disabling possible with an
appropriate smartphone app).
4) Test Case 4: As test equipment a Lenovo ThinkPad
T400, TP-Link TL-WN722N with standard antenna, and
LinSSID on the one side and Samsung S7, and Wiﬁ-Analyzer
on the other side are used. Figure 2 presents the test setting.
In stand still mode the following Secondary Vehicle Identiﬁer
and additional information has been measured for the Wi-Fi
device of the Opel Insignia, for all distances up to 60m with
both test equipments.

Next, we determine the maximum detection distance for
the Secondary Vehicle Identiﬁer. As test equipment a HP
notebook, TP-Link TL-WN722N with standard antenna, and
a LinSSID on the one side and a Huawei P8 lite 2017 with
a Wiﬁ-Analyzer on the other side are used. The results are
presented in Table III for the Wi-Fi device of the Opel Astra.

If a signal has been detected, then the SSID and the BSSID
can always be extracted. The smart phone detected a signal up
to 216 m, the USB-Wi-Fi-device up to 424 m.
5) Test Case 5: As test equipment a HP notebook, TP-Link
TL-WN722N with standard antenna, and a LinSSID on the one
side and a Huawei P8 lite 2017 with Wiﬁ-Analyzer app on the
other side are used. Notebook with USB - Wi-Fi device and
smart phones operate 1 m above the ﬂoor beside the roadway.
Figure 3 shows the principle test case. The results for the Wi-
Fi device of the Opel Astra are presented in Table IV. The
maximum signal strenght has been detected by the USB-Wi-
Fi-device. The measured signal strengths with the TP-Link for
50 and 100 km/h are surprising. We assume that this issue
is caused by the moving vehicle and the sample rate of the
measurement devices of about 1 Hz (vehicle moves 13,9 m/s
by 50 km/h and 27,8 m/s by 100 km/h).
VII.
CONCLUSION
As shown in Section VI, it is technically very easy to cap-
ture Secondary Vehicle Identiﬁer based on wireless interfaces
of vehicles, especially Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (even with low
cost equipment shown in this paper). Although, this interfaces
are designed to connect devices of occupants, vehicle identiﬁer
can be detected far away from the vehicle (Wi-Fi 424 m with
a TP-Link device) and high vehicle speed of up to 100 km/h.
This enables the misuse of vehicle identiﬁer for the tracking
of vehicles.
In the context of the upcoming V2V communication our
results are worrying concerning privacy of vehicles and drivers.
The V2V communication is a short range communication
technology with a communication range of about 800 m in
open space. In future, each vehicle periodically broadcasts
Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) with a packet gener-
ation rate of 1 up to 10 Hz. A CAM contains a lot of data about
the sending vehicle: current geographic position, speed, driving
direction, etc., at a speciﬁc time. One privacy requirement is
that a receiver can not link a CAM to a speciﬁc vehicle. Now,
Secondary Vehicle Identiﬁer can be misused to link captured
CAM messages to a speciﬁc vehicle [14].
Besides the investigation of wireless Secondary Vehicle
Identiﬁers, we noticed, that the security conﬁguration of the
Wi-Fi-APs in the examined vehicles should be improved.
For example, neither MAC ﬁltering, invisibility of the SSID
identiﬁer nor adjustable signal strengh, etc., can be set based
on the Wi-Fi-AP conﬁguration menues. A ﬁrst improvement
is to implement the security features suggested for WiFi-APs
in generell. A comprehensive source for network security is
the BSI IT-Grundschutz Catalogue [15].
