Abstract-This paper introduces improved combination rules 
for the D-S Evidence Theory for dealing with the evidence 
conflicts which considers the coherence evidence and the 
conflicts evidences together and allocate the conflicts to various 
focal elements according to the credibility of the coherence 
evidence. Also after introduce the similarity degree to denote the 
similarity between two fuzzy focal elements, and extended the 
Bel and Pl functions for processing fuzzy data, the improved 
extension combination rules of the D-S evidence theory to fuzzy 
sets are described. The coal and gas outburst prediction 
experiments show that the fusion result with the improved 
combination rule of the D-S Evidence Theory is more reasonable 
and could give a more certain decision than each independent 
method.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
According to the information supplied by every sensor in a 
multi-sensor system, information fusion is a reasoning 
technology for object recognition and property judgment, but 
information from different sensors is usually abridged, 
imprecise and even inconsistent. As an uncertain reasoning 
method and as the generalization of the Bayesian reasoning 
method, the Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory (D-S 
Evidence Theory) is put forward by Dempster in 1967 and 
expanded by Shafer by systemizing and elaborating the theory. 
Due to the advantages of the uncertain denotation, 
measurement and combination, the D-S Evidence Theory was 
applied widely [1-4]. As it can be combined with other 
methods, the Evidence Theory is more widely usable and can 
be extended very well in the future[5-7]. 
The Evidence Theory has many advantages, but it is not 
perfect in practical application, and even produces the 
opposite result to what our intuition tells us. The main reason 
for these deficits is the variance or conflict between the 
evidence[8-10]. And the evidence conflict is a problem that 
cannot be neglected during practical information fusion. The 
D-S Evidence Theory based on classical sets sometimes 
seems restrained and helpless concerning the fuzzy concept, 
so an advanced generalization of extending the evidence 
theory to fuzzy sets is proposed to overcome the existing 
insufficiencies. 
Since the gas outburst under the coal mine is a very 
complicated phenomenon, and there are many factors 
associated with the outburst [11, 12]. Also the warning signs 
before it happens are also unexpected and changing. So the D-
S Evidence Theory which is an intelligent way of uncertain 
reasoning is the only potent approach to consider multiple 
associated factors and make a precise prediction. 
In this paper, an improved D-S evidence theory is presented, 
and it is validated in the coal and gas outburst prediction 
experiments. In Section II, an improved D-S evidence theory 
is described, which can resolve the evidence conflict problem 
effectively. In Section III, we propose the generalized 
combination rule on fuzzy sets by extending the belief 
function Bel and the plausibility function Pl in the D-S 
evidence theory to fuzzy sets. And the Section IV introduces 
the application on outburst prediction with our improved 
combination rules of the D-S evidence theory on fuzzy sets. 
In the end, the related experimental results and conclusion 
would be given in Section V. 
II. IMPROVED EVIDENCE COMBINATION RULES 
A. Introduction of Correlative Conceptions  
As proposed in [13] the concept of evidence distance, 
supposing Θ is the frame of discernment (FOD) including N 
different propositions and M evidence sources: S1,S2,…,SM, 
the corresponding BPAFs are: m1,m2,…,mM. We consider each 
evidence source Si as row vector Si in 2N dimension; every 
part of the vector is the distributed probability mi of every 
element in exponential sets 2Θ of Θ. So, the distance between 
two evidence sources Si, Sj  is defined as:

So, the evidence distance represents the difference between 
two kinds of evidence, which is another reflection of the 
evidence conflict. On the other hand, the coherence degree of 
two kinds of evidence is also reflected. Obviously, the 
distance and coherence between two kinds of evidence are 
inversely proportional. When the distance between two kinds 
of evidence is equal to be 1, the two kinds of evidence are 
absolutely incoherent and the degree of coherence is 0; and 
when the distance becomes 0, the evidence is absolutely 
coherent and the degree of coherence is 1. Based on the fusion 
effect, we choose a simple formula to define the degree of 
coherence between two kinds of evidence. For example, the 
degree of coherence between Si, Sj is described as:

As can be seen from the definition, the coherence degree 
reflects the degree of mutual sustainment, so the degree to 
which evidence Si is sustained by other instances of evidence 
is defined as:

Hence, the greater the degree to which the evidence is 
sustained by other evidence, the higher its reliability. 
Therefore we can define the credibility of a single evidence 
source using the sustainment degree between two kinds of 
evidence. The credibility of evidence source Si is defined as:

The more number of highly coherent evidence sources, the 
more highly credible single evidence sources, and then the 
higher total credibility of M evidence sources; whereas it is 
lower. Furthermore, when all the evidence sources conflict 
absolutely, the coherence degree between two random kinds 
of evidence is 0 and the total credibility of the evidence 
sources should intuitively be 0. On the other hand, when all 
the evidence is absolutely coherent, the mutual coherence 
degree is 1 and the total credibility of the evidence sources 
should intuitively be 1. Therefore, we define the total 
credibility hypersphere of the evidence sources and the total 
credibility hypersphere of absolute coherence (the perfect 
hypersphere), the dimensions of which are both C2
M, and the 
respective radiuses r and R are defined as:

We consider the total credibility of the evidence sources as 
the degree closest to the credibility of perfect evidence 
sources in terms of absolute coherence, that is, the degree of 
the total credibility hypersphere is closest to the perfect 
hypersphere of evidence sources. Considering that the credit 
of evidence sources is one-dimensional, we define the total 
credit 
of evidence sources as: 
C
 
                           
C = r R
                                               (8) 
B. Improved Combination Rules I 
In this paper, we consider the conflict and coherence of the 
evidence combination synchronously, the conflict evidence 
combined with the credibility of the evidence source, and the 
coherence evidence combined with the AND-algorithm, which 
can reflect the degree of intersection fusion. Therefore, our 
improved rules are respectively based on the two different 
ideas mentioned above. To this end, we suppose Ai, Bj, and Ck 
to be the focal elements of M different evidence sources in the 
following section. 
Based on the idea that conflict evidence can be used by 
parts, we think a part of the conflict information can be 
allocated to focal elements of the evidence, and the other parts 
to the unknown term m (Θ), moreover, the allocation depends 
on the credibility of the total evidence source and the single 
evidence. So the improved rule I is:

The formula above gives the total probability of coherence 
evidence after intercross fusion; the Q in the formula reflects 
the degree of intercross fusion of the evidence, including the 
AND-algorithm. Obviously, the more coherence there is 
between evidence sources, the higher the degree of intercross 
fusion; and (1-K)/P stands for the probability of unitary 
allocation of the coherence evidence after the intercross 
fusion. The second term in formula (10) and (11) stands for 
allocating the total conflict of the evidence source by weight 
logically,  respectively considering the credit of the evidence 
source in total and individually.  
Then we prove that function m from the rule above is a 
BPAF, that is, we only need to prove that:

    This detailed proof has been given in other paper which has

C.  Improved Combination Rules II 
Based on the idea that conflict evidence can be used 
completely (in the above rule) under the condition that the 
total credibility of the evidence sources C=1, and referring to 
the method in reference [15], we think the conflict 
information can be completely allocated to focal elements of 
evidence, and the allocation depends on the credibility of 
every single evidence source. Therefore, the improved rule II 
is as follows:

Every term in the above formula is the same as that in rule I. 
When the frame of discernment Θ is also the focal element, 
we can calculate the probability m (Θ) using formula (16). 
According to rule II, we also have the summary of the 
probability ∑m(A) is equal to be 1, and the reasoning is 
similar to that in rule I, except that the total credibility of the 
evidence source used is C=1. So the m is also a BPAF 
function in rule II. 
From the above proving process, we can conclude that rule 
II can be regarded as an example for rule I if we consider the 
total credit of the evidence source in rule I to be C=1, that 
means, the conflict information can be allocated to focal 
elements of evidence and unknown terms according to the 
total credibility of the evidence source in rule I. Therefore, 
rule I is more reliable and conservative than rule II, while rule 
II is a more changeable and less reliable decision-making 
method. However, in contrast to rule I, it is flexible and can 
adapt to special requirements. 
 
III. THE IMPROVED EXTENTION OF FUZZY D-S 
EVIDENCE THEORY 
As we know, the evidence theory can express the 
“uncertainty” distinctly and correctly, and it also features the 
D-S combination rule which is based on sound mathematic 
rules. As the evidence theory has a good effect of 
combination, many researchers continually improved the D-S 
formulas. However, by extending it from classic sets to fuzzy 
sets, the denotation and algorithm of fuzzy sets and their 
intrinsic meanings underwent great changes compared to 
classic sets. Therefore, when we extend the evidence theory to 
fuzzy sets, we should change the way evidence is denoted as 
well as the corresponding combination rule. 
Classical sets only need to consider the included elements 
which are certain, but fuzzy sets consider not only the 
included elements, but also the degree to which every element 
is subjected to the fuzzy sets. So taking the fuzzy sets into 
account, we cannot only heed the included elements like the 
classic sets, as there several degrees to which an element 
“belongs to” the set. These degrees are confirmed only by the 
subjection degree.

different nature. Therefore, when considering fuzzy sets, the 
subjection degree of every element to the fuzzy set is more 
important, and it is necessary to extend the combination rules 
of the evidence theory to fuzzy sets.

considered as a special fuzzy set with subjection degrees of 
equal to 1 for all included elements, therefore the empty set 
and the frame of discernmentΘ can be considered as absolute 
opposites, and the degree of their similarity should be 0. 
Furthermore, the similarity of any fuzzy set to itself should be 
equal to 1.

allocation model, not to change the form of Dempster’s 
combination rule which has well characters. Before 
combining the evidence, the Basic Probability of Assignment 
Function (BPAF) of the fuzzy focal elements needs to be 
amended. Based on the similarity between fuzzy sets, for

This above idea of the combination rule put forward by Lin 
Zhigui in [18] seems more reasonable, and using numeral 
experiments, he validated the advantage of the defined 
concept of similarity between fuzzy sets and the combination 
rule, which is more sensitive to the changing of fuzzy focal 
elements. However, this concept also has deficiencies. Firstly, 
he only defined the similarity between fuzzy focal elements, 
and according to the combination formula, the similarity 
degree is equal to 0 between an empty set and any nonempty

has a deficiency, that is, the function m after combination is 
no longer a basic probability assignment function, because

From the above chain of reasoning, we can define the

As this definition of real function ω  satisfies the four basic

probability assignment function, we define the combination 
rule of the evidence theory on fuzzy sets as definition 2.

IV. APPLICATION ON GAS OUT BURST PREDICTION 
        
             
                                                                                                       
In order to validate the improved combination rule of the 
D-S evidence theory on fuzzy sets, we did our experiments of 
gas outburst prediction with this method. The intelligent 
prediction way based on multi-sensor information presented 
in this paper is choosing the preliminary prediction results 
from different main methods as the evidences of the D-S 
evidence theory, and then making an extended reasoning 
fusion decision with the improved fuzzy combination rule.  
The data in Table I show the indexes from five different 
mines and the actual results are divided into two kinds, The 
“A” stands for occurrence of outburst, “B” is no occurrence.  
 
TABLE I  The Indexes from Different Areas 
 
 
In this experiment, we chose neural network, single index 
method--Preliminary Velocity, D-K composite index, and 
cutting desorption index
 way as four evidence source. 
The prediction results from these four ways are gotten 
respectively not only for comparison, but also for evidence 
source of extended decision of the D-S Evidence Theory.

To compare the fusion result with each of the single 
methods above, we achieved the following prediction results

From this fusion results, we can make a determinate 
decision, areas in 19, 20, 22 have the risk of outburst, and 
areas in 21, 23 have no risk of outburst, which accord with the 
factual results.  
From the table above, we can conclude that the result after 
fusion with D-S evidence theory is more reasonable than the 
result from each single present prediction method. Also it is 
much easier to make a determinate decision from the fusion 
result. The results proved that the evidence theory fusion 
could “compensate” the deficiencies in each single prediction, 
thus adding to other evidence sources. For example, according 
to the data from area in 21, if we only use cutting desorption 
index method, the prediction result is uncertain, the 
probability of no risk is only 64.29%, and we could not give 
an assured conclusion, but after “compensating” of other 
methods, the result is improved, the probability of no risk is 
up to 94.46%, and we can give the conclusion exactly. 
Another example, the prediction in area 23, the credibility of 
no risk after evidence fusion is up to 96.84%, which is higher 
than the credibility from each other method. 
 
 
V. CONCLUSION  
 This paper improves the combination rules of the D-S 
Evidence Theory to deal with coherent or incoherent evidence 
obtained from multiple sources. According to the credibility 
of coherence evidence, the improved rules allocate the 
conflicts to various focal elements, so the new rules can 
process both highly conflicting and coherent evidence 
effectively, and the rules can provide reasonable results with 
better convergence efficiency than other rules in the case of 
highly conflicting evidence sources. 
We introduced the similarity degree to denote the similarity 
between two fuzzy focal elements, and extended the Bel and 
Pl functions for processing fuzzy data. Then the improved 
extension combination rule of the D-S evidence theory to 
fuzzy sets is considered.  
The coal and gas outburst prediction experiments show that 
the fusion result with the improved combination rule of the D-
S Evidence Theory is more reasonable and could give a more 
certain decision than each independent method.  
In the future work, the experience of the experts could be 
added as a new evidence source, combing external 
measurement data with human subjective experience, the 
fusion result must be better and more reasonable.
