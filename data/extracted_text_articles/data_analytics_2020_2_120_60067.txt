I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
According to a European Commission’s report on digital 
skills in education in 2013, an average of 65% of students in 
EU countries never used digital textbooks, exercise software, 
broadcasts/podcasts, simulations or learning games [1]. 
Since then, higher education institutions have shown a 
persistent concern with enhancing students’ academic 
performance through the use of innovative technologies that 
offer new ways of delivering and producing university 
education [2]. From an economic point of view, the industry 
of e-learning has developed considerably in the last decade. 
The market of e-learning all over the world will be over 243 
billion dollars in 2022 [3]. 
The pandemic of COVID-19 led most of the 
governments around the world to impose lockdown, 
social/physical distancing, avoiding face-to-face teaching-
learning, and restrictions on travelling and immigration [4]. 
It caused the closing of classrooms all over the world and 
forced 1.5 billion students and 63 million educators to 
suddenly modify their face-to-face academic practices [3]. 
This closure led to an unprecedented impact on education. 
Higher education institutions were forced to shift rapidly to 
distance and online learning. On the one hand, this fact 
revealed the weaknesses of adoption and utilization of e-
learning strategies and technologies [4] [5]; but, on the other 
hand, it resulted in a digital revolution through online 
lectures, teleconferencing, digital open books, online 
examination, and interaction at virtual environments [6]. 
E-learning is the use of new multimedia technologies and 
the Internet to improve the quality of learning by facilitating 
access to resources and services, as well as remote exchange 
and collaboration [7] [8]. It has a great potential from the 
educational perspective and it has been one of the main 
research lines of educational technology in the last decades 
[3]. Particular attention has been given on understanding the 
adoption factors related to e-learning services satisfaction 
and acceptance by students and tutors [5] [7] [9].  
However, the wide use of e-learning due to COVID-19 
demonstrated inequalities as a result of previously 
underestimating the potential of e-learning and its exclusion 
from the digital education projects of educational institutions 
[3]. A considerable amount of literature has investigated 
inequalities between developed and developing countries [3] 
[10]. However, the wide adoption of e-learning strategies and 
technologies and the complete transformation of the physical 
learning process to a virtual one pose the challenge of 
personalization according to different learning profiles [11], 
a research area rather underexplored. E-learning provides 
people with a flexible way to learn allowing learning on 
demand and reducing the associated costs [7]. E-learning 
personalization is emerged as a major challenge [11] [12],

especially in today’s fast adoption of this alternative way of 
learning.  
Despite the large amount of research works dealing with 
learning profiles in physical classrooms, these models should 
be further investigated and validated in the virtual 
classrooms, during the e-learning process. To this end, the 
contribution of e-learning to several learning factors 
according to the learning profiles has the potential to reveal 
the acceptance of e-learning by different learning profiles 
and to result in e-learning process personalization in order to 
mitigate the respective inequalities. 
The objective of the current paper is to develop an 
intelligent 
recommender 
system 
for 
supporting 
the 
professors in higher education in understanding their 
students’ needs so that he/she adapts the e-learning process 
accordingly. In addition, the proposed recommender system 
is able to classify new records (i.e. students) to the 
appropriate learning profiles, e.g., in order to support the 
organization of the class groups. The proposed approach was 
applied to a maritime educational institution. The rest of the 
paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the related 
work on methods and approaches for evaluating students’ 
acceptance of the e-learning process as well as learning 
profile models for learning personalization. Section III 
describes the research methodology and the proposed 
approach for the development of an intelligent recommender 
system for e-learning process personalization. Section IV 
presents the results from the adoption of the proposed 
methodology on a dataset of 268 students in the maritime 
education. Section V concludes the paper and outlines our 
plans for future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Existing literature is quite rich on evaluating students’ 
experience, satisfaction and acceptance of the e-learning 
process. In general, earlier studies focused more on content, 
customization and technology, while more recent studies 
focused on students' attitude and interaction, expectations, 
acceptance and satisfaction [9] [13]. To this end, there is an 
emerging trend towards the identification of the key factors 
for the adoption of e-learning strategies and technologies. 
Several studies have used the original version of the 
classic model, the DeLone & McLean (D&M) IS Success 
Model [14] to measure and evaluate the success of e-learning 
systems [15]-[17]. The use of virtual learning environments 
in addition to classroom study (blended learning), were 
surveyed by [18]. They concluded that the students' 
performance of the virtual learning environment support had 
better results than those having only face to face learning. 
The identified key satisfaction factors are information 
quality, system quality, instructor attitude toward e-learning, 
diversity in assessment, and learner perceived interaction 
with others. 
The authors in [7] identified clear governance structure 
and the need of organized distribution of planning 
responsibilities and implementation as the main adoption 
factors. In [19], the authors concluded that perceived 
usefulness, ease of use, perceived enjoyment, network 
externality factor, system factor, individual factors, and 
social factors are the main e-learning acceptance predictors. 
Student interface, learning community, content, and 
customization as well as ease of use of web courses have 
also been identified to have a significant impact on e-
learning acceptance [20] [21]. 
In [22], the authors concluded that student e-learning 
adoption and attitudes in the university context are academic 
achievements mediated by digital readiness and academic 
engagement. In [23], the authors proposed an e-learning tools 
acceptance model in order to examine the level of acceptance 
and critical factors of virtual learning tools among university 
students in developing countries. Results confirm a strong 
relation between the perceived usefulness and the instructor 
preparation and autonomy in learning, as well as between the 
ease of use and the perceived self-efficacy perception. The 
reseach work of [24] developed a Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM) for e-learning. The results indicated that 
system quality, computer self-efficacy, and computer 
playfulness have a significant impact on perceived ease of 
use of e-learning system. Furthermore, information quality, 
perceived enjoyment, and accessibility were found to have a 
positive influence on perceived ease of use and perceived 
usefulness of e-learning system. 
The authors in [25] applied process mining methods in 
order to discover students’ self-regulated learning processes 
during e-learning. They identified a high presence of actions 
related to forum-supported collaborative learning among the 
students who finally passed the exams and an absence of 
those in their failing classmates. The research work of [5] 
concluded that the main factors affecting the usage of e-
learning are: technological factors, e-learning system quality 
factors, trust factors, self-efficacy factors and cultural 
aspects. Therefore, apart from the challenges related to the 
technological infrastructure, change management, course 
design, computer self-efficacy and financial support are also 
issues of outmost importance.  
Learning personalization is an important topic in 
educational sciences. Since different people learn in different 
ways, it is important to create and adapt the e-learning 
process in order to maximize and speed up the learning 
process [11]. The need to adapt teaching strategies to the 
student’s preferences is a reality in classrooms, be they 
physical or virtual [26] [27]. However, this does not mean 
that a method should be created for each student in a 
classroom, but that the best form of interaction for each of 
them be identified, building groups of learners with common 
characteristics [28]. Learning styles are cognitive, affective 
and psychological traits that determine how a student 
interacts and reacts in a learning environment [29]. The idea 
is to identify the marked characteristics of a given learner so 
that these traits influence his learning process. 
Several learning profile models have been developed in 
the literature, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – 
MBTI, Kolb’s Experiential Learning Model, the Hermann 
Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI), the Dunn and Dunn 
Model, the Felder-Silverman Model, and the Honey and 
Mumford Model [26] [27]. With the wide adoption of e-
learning strategies and technologies, there is the need for 
applying and validating learning profile models in the digital

and online learning era. For example, in [11], the authors 
investigated the e-learning personalization aiming at keeping 
students motivated and engaged. To that end, they proposed 
the use of k-means algorithm to cluster students based on 12 
engagement metrics divided into two categories: interaction-
related and effort-related. The research work of [27] 
presented the architecture of a system that realizes an 
evaluation of learning profiles based on categories of student 
preferences. The profile models were built according to 
categories of student preferences based on the proposal of 
learning styles put forward by [29]. 
III. 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
A. Data Collection and Learning Profile Model Selection 
The data was collected in the form of an online 
questionnaire of 80 questions addressed to students of higher 
educational institution. Each question was in the form of 
Likert scale (1: Strongly Disagree – 5: Strongly Agree) and it 
was related to one out of the four learning styles as defined 
by the Honey and Mumford Model [30]: activist, reflector, 
pragmatist, and theorist. For example, in an ideal scenario 
that a student has answered 5: Strongly Agree to all the 
questions matching to the “activist” learning profile and 1: 
Strongly Disagree to all the others, he/she is classified as 
“activist”. 
Activist refers to an individual’s preference for active 
involvement in the learning activity (through problem 
solving, discussion, creating their own models). Reflector 
learns best by watching and thinking about what is 
happening. The reflector responds more positively to 
learning activities where there is time to observe, reflect and 
think and work in a detailed manner. Pragmatist wants to 
know how to put what they are learning into practice in the 
real world. They experiment with theories, ideas, and 
techniques and take the time to think about how what 
they’ve done relates to reality. Theorist seeks to understand 
the theory behind the action. They enjoy following models 
and reading up on facts to better engage in the learning 
process. 
B. Classification for Structuring the Learning Profiles 
The classification of the student to the learning profiles is 
not straightforward (like in the aforementioned ideal 
scenario) since they may have characteristics of more than 
one profile. Therefore, according to the given answers, the k-
means clustering algorithm was applied in order to assign the 
respondents to 4 
clusters 
(k=4) matching to the 
aforementioned learning profiles.   
k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization 
that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which 
each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean 
(cluster centers or cluster centroid) [31]. k-means clustering 
minimizes the within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean 
distances). Given a set of observations (x1, x2, …, xn), where 
each observation is a d-dimensional real vector, k-means 
clustering aims to partition the n observations into k (≤ n) 
sets S={S1, S2, …, Sk} so as to minimize the within-cluster 
sum of squares (WCSS) (i.e. variance). Formally, the 
objective is to find:  
 
 
 
(1) 
 
where μi is the mean of points in Si. This is equivalent to 
minimizing the pairwise squared deviations of points in the 
same cluster: 
 
 
 
(2) 
 
The equivalence can be deduced from the identity: 
 
 
(3) 
 
Because the total variance is constant, this is equivalent to 
maximizing the sum of squared deviations between points in 
different clusters (Between-Cluster Sum of Squares, BCSS), 
which follows from the law of total variance.  
C. Modelling the Relationships between Learning Profiles 
and E-learning Preferences 
Subsequently, the proposed approach models the 
relationships between the learning profiles and e-learning 
contribution to learning factors as derived from the 
questionnaire. To do this, a Bayesian Network (BN) is 
applied aiming at identifying these causal and uncertain 
relationships. A BN, also known as belief network, is 
defined as a pair B = (G, Θ). G = (V, E) is a Directed 
Acyclic Graph (DAG) where V = {v1, …, vn} is a collection 
of n nodes, E ⸦ V × V a collection of edges and a set of 
parameters Θ containing all the Conditional Probabilities 
(CP) of the network [32]. Each node v ϵ V of the graph 
represents a random variable XV with a state space XV which 
can be either discrete or continuous. An edge (vi, vj) ϵ E 
represents the conditional dependence between two nodes vi, 
vj ϵ V where vi is the parent of child vj. If two nodes are not 
connected by an edge, they are conditional independent. 
Because a node can have more than one parent, let πv the set 
of parents for a node v ϵ V.  
      Therefore each random variable is independent of all 
nodes V \ πv. For each node, a Conditional Probability Table 
(CPT) contains the CP distribution with parameters θxi|πi 
:=P(xi|πi) ϵ Θ for each realization xi of Xi conditioned on πi. 
The joint probability distribution over V is visualized by the 
BN and can be defined as: 
 
 
 
(4) 
 
With BN, inference for what-if analysis can be 
supported, either top-down (predictive support) or bottom-up 
(diagnostic support). If a random variable which is 
represented by a node is observed, the node is called an 
evidence node; otherwise, it is a hidden node [33]. Based on 
86

the learning profiles derived from the questionnaire, a BN 
with two layers was developed: at the top layer (i.e. learning 
profiles), there are 4 parent nodes matching to the respective 
clusters of students.  
At the bottom layer (i.e. e-learning contribution to 
learning factors), there are 9 child nodes referring to 9 e-
learning factors grouping the questions. In this way, the 
model identifies the preferences of each learning profile by 
assessing the impact of e-learning on the learning process of 
each profile. Therefore, according to the learning profile, the 
user is able to select the appropriate learning strategies 
aiming at personalizing the e-learning process. 
D. Predicting the Class Attribute of E-learning Impact  
At any time, the user of the recommender system is able 
to make queries in order to investigate particular 
relationships along with their associated CPTs. Moreover, 
the model incorporates a Naïve Bayes classifier for 
predicting the class attribute of a learning profile as soon as 
new records of students’ responses are inserted into the 
database.  
Naïve Bayes classifier is highly scalable, requiring a 
number of parameters linear in the number of variables in a 
learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done 
by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear 
time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as 
used for many other types of classifiers [34]. Prediction of 
the class attribute can be performed even if the questionnaire 
is not completely answered. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
The proposed approach was applied on a dataset of 268 
students of a maritime higher educational institution in 
Greece. The transformation of maritime from highly labour- 
to capital-intensive industry contributed to the presence of 
tertiary education in maritime studies [35]. However, the 
learning process in maritime education faces additional 
challenges due to the structure of their programs, the 
tendency of undergraduate students to combine studies and 
work, 
the 
internationalization, 
specialization, 
and 
standardization [35]-[37]. These make maritime education an 
interesting case study for the validation of e-learning process 
personalization.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The implementation and execution of the experiments 
were performed using the sklearn.cluster library of Python 
[38] for the k-means clustering algorithm and the BN 
functionalities of the pgmpy (Probabilistic Graphical Models 
using Python) package [39]. After having structured the 
learning profiles of the respondents, the BN is created and 
the CPTs are calculated, as shown in Figure 1. Table I 
presents the highest and the lowest CPs of the e-learning 
contribution to learning factors given the learning profiles. 
Therefore, the highest CP is the one of a student being 
activist given the answers of the second row that is 38.6%. 
The lowest CP is the one of a student being activist given the 
answers of the last row that is 5.6%. According to the queries 
posed by the user, various calculations can be done.  As 
already mentioned, the model can also serve as a classifier 
for predicting the class attribute of learning factors as soon as 
new records of students are received and classified through 
the k-means clustering algorithm.

In order to evaluate its classification effectiveness, we 
inserted 
additional 
records, 
derived 
from 
more 
questionnaires addressed to students of the maritime 
educational institution, and we created the confusion matrix 
according to Table II in order to estimate the precision and 
the recall of the classifier using the (5) and (6) [40].

The Precision results are quite satisfactory, while the 
Recall results can be further improved. We should also take 
into account that modelling human behavior, such as the 
learning process, has a high degree of uncertainty [41]. 
Moreover, the BN model sticks to the initially identified 
relationships, i.e., the ones that have been mined during the 
model training. Therefore, when new relationships, not 
previously identified, are added, they are not classified 
correctly. These records include values that are not frequent, 
so they are not critical for decision making.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
During the last years, e-learning has been gaining an 
increasing attention in higher education. Especially during 
the last months, higher education institutions were forced to 
shift rapidly to distance and online learning. On the one 
hand, this fact revealed the weaknesses of adoption and 
utilization of e-learning strategies and technologies, but, on 
the other hand, it resulted in a digital revolution in education. 
A major challenge was to apply e-learning strategies and 
technologies for supporting e-learning personalization. In 
this paper, we proposed an intelligent recommender system 
for e-learning process personalization.  
The proposed approach is based on the Honey and 
Mumford Model of learning profiles and utilized k-means 
clustering and BNs in order to classify the students to 
learning profiles and to reveal relationships with the 
contribution of e-learning to several learning factors. The 
proposed approach was applied to a dataset of 268 students 
in maritime education and we presented indicative examples 
of queries. We also validated the model in terms of its 
precision and recall in predicting the learning profile when 
new records are inserted into the database. 
Regarding our future work, we plan to incorporate 
additional learning factors with respect to the e-learning 
impact. Moreover, we plan to apply more machine learning 
and data analytics methods, with an emphasis on fuzzy 
methods, in combination with different learning profile 
models. Finally, we will plan to expand our research to 
various universities in order to obtain more generalized 
results.
