Abstract— 
Telecommunication 
services 
are 
expected  
to be of good quality and offered for reasonable price. 
Operators, competing strongly for the customers, always 
present their products in the best light, and underline  
the highest service quality, which is often measured  
in incomparable circumstances, using different procedures  
and measurement methods. The paper presents the efforts  
of European standards institutions, regulators and operators 
in scope of improving telecommunication services provisioning 
and quality ensuring. Authors present the main parameters 
influencing the quality of Short Message Service which 
represents a wide range of text messaging services. The authors 
present methodology and the environment for measuring  
end-to-end 
delivery 
time. 
The 
measurement 
scenarios 
performed in both, the real network and in a laboratory 
environment are presented. The results of measurements, 
performed in real networks of four operators in Poland, show 
that the message delivery time fluctuates during the course  
of the day and also depends on the operator, but generally  
the short text service is of good quality and is highly assessed 
by the users. Authors present also the quality of experience 
model for text messaging. 
Keywords- text messaging; SMS; QoS; QoE; quality 
assessment.

 INTRODUCTION 
In just a few decades, mobile telephony has reached  
a deeper level of penetration worldwide than cars, radio  
or TV. From over 700 million registered users in 2000, 
mobile cellular industry has grown widely and exceeded  
7 billion subscriptions in 2015. With the increased number  
of mobile subscribers over the world, Short Message Service 
(SMS), has also gained a huge popularity [1], i.e., around  
8 trillion messages a year [2][3]. Moreover, after voice, 
messaging is the biggest revenue-generating mobile service 
on 
the 
telecommunication 
market 
[4]. 
Although,  
in some countries SMS has peaked, and the traffic volumes 
are in decline, there are more countries where overall SMS 
traffic 
and 
its 
use-per-subscriber 
is 
still 
growing.  
A significant growth in mobile subscribers is observed  
in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America, thus  
the 
dominance 
of 
SMS 
in 
the 
immediate 
future  
is unthreatened. According to [4] SMS will be one  
of the major communications tools worldwide for the next 
decade, despite progressive extension of user equipment 
utility. The increase in the processing power of mobile 
devices has made them significantly more multi-functional 
and allows Internet browsing, emailing, multimedia  
and instant messaging. Despite the rapid growth of so called 
Over-The-Top (OTT) messaging apps and Voice over IP 
(VoIP) services, SMS is still generating more than half  
of the total mobile messaging revenue (see Figure 1) [5].

Such large revenues mean that SMS will remain an 
important service for mobile operators for years. While 
Instant Messaging (IM) and SMS are both text messaging, 
there are differences that encourage different user behaviors. 
IM is rather two-way communication with many quick 
responses in contrast to SMS, where individual paid-for 
messages are used just to send information. While there are 
low to zero costs for the user when using IM, travelers stick 
to using SMS as it is cheaper than purchasing a mobile data 
package or subscribing for a data roaming plan in order to 
send a few messages. SMS is common to all phones  
and almost all users [5] while IM usually requires 
smartphones with dedicated apps and specific knowledge 
how to use it, which can be a barrier for some (older) part  
of society. Moreover, the market for IM is fragmented  
by different services which cannot communicate with each 
other. Besides, users also choose IM apps based on their 
geographical location. While WeChat is clearly the leader  
in China and Line for Japan, WhatsApp is also far bigger  
in East and South-East Asia than the USA. One of the major 
factors that allows service providers to keep their customers 
is the price, which is diminishing year by year, while  
the next ones are common availability, simplicity. and good 
quality. Service quality is becoming an increasingly more 
important factor to users at the moment when choosing  
the network operator or service provider [1][6][7].

Thus, 
many 
operators’ 
efforts 
are 
concentrated  
on the efficient mechanisms for handling the message traffic 
[8]. On the other hand, a service oriented management  
is focused on service quality rather than network 
performance [9]. An effective evaluation of service quality 
can help service provider to increase customer satisfaction. 
Quality of Experience (QoE) based research mechanism  
for control and management of resources is getting more 
attentions in literature [10][11][12]. The SMS quality 
evaluation is also important in case of professional 
deployment of the service [13]. It is especially of great 
importance to many local governments (eg., in Poland) 
implementing SMS to notify inhabitants and all the guests  
in the area of the emergency states [14]. On the other hand, 
growing competition among service providers and network 
operators forces these entities to provide high quality 
services. The question of how to describe this quality  
and what parameters should be used, is asked not only by 
operators but also by regulators of the telecommunications 
market in the European Union [15]. One of the factors 
motivating telecommunications industry operators to act  
in 
this 
direction 
are 
regulations 
undertaken 
both  
at the European level [16][17], as well as in individual 
Member States [18][19]. A particular example of this can be 
seen in case of Poland, where on the Electronic 
Communications Office’s initiative (2012), a Memorandum 
on Cooperation for Improving the Quality of Services  
in the Telecommunications Market has been signed.  
The first stage of works was finalized in the form  
of an official report [20], which was published by  
the Electronic Communications Office in February 2014. 
Despite long discussions, the current edition of this report 
does not define any QoS requirements for SMS, but there  
is a hope for a gradual expansion of the scope of this 
document. Although, SMS is not a real-time service,  
it is often perceived as such (a near-real-time) service [21]  
by a huge amount of users. Therefore, two factors seem to be 
important from the QoS point of view, these are: delivery 
rate and time of delivery. Nowadays, the delivery rate  
is mostly at a high level, reaching, in case of many operators, 
values 
around 
95% 
[14]. 
However, 
these 
factors  
are correlated with each other, because the delivery rate also 
depends, among other things, on the delivery threshold time 
after which the message is considered as lost. Therefore, 
delivery time seems to be a key performance indicator (KPI), 
which is much more crucial for the service quality perceived 
by the users. They want the information to be delivered  
in acceptable time. But what does it mean? In the era  
of information and communication technologies with more 
and more bandwidth and rich service offerings, user 
demands concerning the service are also growing. Today 
SMS is more often treated as an almost instantaneous 
communication medium for rapid exchange of information, 
and even a form of text dialogue between people [21].  
It seems that a relatively short time of message delivery  
is one of the main factors describing SMS quality affecting 
its popularity among users. 
In Section II, Authors present the basics of SMS 
functionality and the main parameters and statistics 
describing quality of the service, according to the ETSI 
standards [22]. Section III presents the methodology and 
tools used during measurements in the real network. The 
message delivery time distributions are also presented and 
discussed. In Section IV, the Authors propose, on the basis 
of measurements results, the Quality of Experience model 
for SMS. Section V presents conclusions and the plans for 
the future work. 
II. 
SHORT MESSAGE SERVICE QUALITY 
SMS, belonging to the so-called “non-real-time” class, is 
a “store-and-forward” type of service [23]. Communication 
between two users is done via at least one server, acting as 
an intermediary unit. A user’s equipment transmits a 
message to the server which optionally sends it to the next 
server and so forth. The end server, after receiving the 
message, informs a recipient’s equipment of receiving a 
message and, finally, the user can read the message. SMS 
was originally designed for transmission of text information, 
where the length of single data unit cannot exceed 140 bytes 
and, according to ETSI standards [24], remains constant 
regardless of the number of characters transmitted in a single 
message. Depending on the alphabet used, the maximum 
message length may vary between 70 and 160 characters. 
When the information is longer, then it is divided and 
encapsulated into several 140-byte data units, and sent as 
separate messages. The quality study presented in this paper 
takes into account only the information that does not exceed  
the size of a single data unit. ETSI standards give a very 
detailed information regarding SMS quality parameters  
and their computation. The most important parameters are: 
 
SMS Successful Ratio - the ratio of correctly sent 
messages, expressed by the probability of correct 
message sending and its delivery to a service center, 
 
Completion Rate for SMS - indicator of properly 
delivered messages, expressed by the percentage of 
messages 
successfully 
sent 
and 
delivered  
to a recipient, 
 
End-to-End Delivery Time for SMS - time  
to deliver a message from end to end, expressed  
as the time measured from the moment of sending  
a message by a sender to a service center until  
it is received by a recipient. 
Monitoring of the parameters, mentioned above,  
is crucial for the operator who has to watch over the process 
of service delivery at every stage of its implementation.  
It gives the knowledge of network performance, which  
in turn impacts the quality of service [25]. Message loss and 
message integrity are valid concerns, however, they are 
handled by lower layer network mechanisms and protocol, 
which are outside the scope of this paper. From the user’s 
point of view, it is very important that messages are 
delivered to the recipient as soon as possible and in an 
unchanged form. From this perspective, it can be seen that 
2

SERVICE COMPUTATION 2016 : The Eighth International Conferences on Advanced Service Computing

the parameter which probably has the strongest impact on the 
SMS quality, perceived by the user, is the End-to-End 
Delivery Time. According to the ETSI standard [22], the 
following statistics should be provided separately: 
 
the mean value in seconds for sending and receiving 
short messages, 
 
the time in seconds within which the fastest 95%  
of short messages are sent and received, 
 
the number of observations performed. 
It should be noted that, concerning the mobile 
environment, the values of QoS parameters mentioned above 
can be affected not only by congestion in the SMS system  
or signalling channels but also by network or service  
non-accessibility in the claimed area of coverage. In that 
case, operators may wish to distinguish the effects  
of coverage and access congestion, but from the user’s point 
of view there is no need to do it, because all these 
phenomena impact on the end-user perception. 
III. 
MEASUREMENTS IN THE REAL NETWORK 
This Section presents the methodology, measurement 
environment, results, and evaluation of SMS quality 
provided by leading mobile operators functioning in Poland, 
i.e., Orange, Play, Plus and T-Mobile. 
A. Methodology and the Measurement Environment 
Data 
were 
collected 
from 
more 
than  
120 000 tests (individual observations) performed during one 
week in Wroclaw - one of the biggest Polish cities  
(650 000 inhabitants). The test environment (see Figure 2) 
consists of measuring robots (one for the operator), each 
covering a Personal Computer with a 3G modem  
and 
specially 
designed 
application, 
managing  
the measurement and data collection process. Each robot 
plays both roles: sender and receiver. Initially, the first one 
sends a previously prepared text message to the Short 
Message Service Center (SMSC) located in the operator 
network, inserting in the destination address field its own 
number (i.e., both: sender and receiver belong to the same 
network). The measurements of SMS delivery time for  
the messages exchanged between users of different networks 
are not in the scope of this article. The time of message 
sending is written down into a special record of a log file  
on the robot’s hard disk. Then the SMSC sends the message 
further, i.e., to the receiver, which in this situation is the 
same robot that sent the message before. Next, the receiving 
part of the robot is informed of the incoming message and 
then it also records the current time in the log file. In this 
way, the file collects a number of records with the times  
of sending and receiving the particular messages. Each robot 
works independently of the others. However, the individual 
robot sends the messages sequentially, i.e., sending  
of the next message is possible only after receiving  
the previous one. The robot software allows the setting

of the time interval between the received and sent messages 
(see Figure 3) in order to control the frequency of message 
sending. It should be noted that such a solution causes  
the risk of substantially reducing the number of tests when 
the delivery time increases enormously. In order to eliminate 
such phenomenon, it is possible to limit the maximum 
acceptable delivery time and, if it is overrun, the expected 
message may be recognized as lost. Then the sending  
of 
the 
next 
message 
can 
start. 
In 
this 
phase  
of the measurements such a time limit was not used so that 
the robots were able to capture all delivery time cases.

B. Message Delivery Time Distributions 
The 
measurements 
performed 
in 
real 
networks, 
mentioned before, allowed the message delivery time 
distributions in each network to be determined (Figures 4-7). 
After analysis of the distributions it can be stated that 
although very long delivery times occur in case of some 
operators (e.g., Play), which may be irritating to somebody 
who experiences that. From statistical point of view, 
however, they are not of considerable importance  
(it concerns about 10-4 cases). Moreover, it is negligible 
especially in the case of discarding 5% of the highest values 
before further analysis. The majority of the captured message 
delivery times do not exceed 10 seconds which means that 
SMS users should be satisfied. Moreover, almost 99% of the 
messages were delivered, in case of three operators, in time 
not higher than 6 seconds. Only in the Play network  
message delivery time distribution was different. The 
question is: are the captured message delivery times 
satisfying in case of real time text messaging applications? 
More 
detailed 
analysis 
will 
be 
shown  
in the Section IV, where the scores of subjective 
measurements will be taken into account.

C. Message Delivery Time as a Function of the Time  
of Day 
Analysis of the results showed that message delivery 
time, as expected, is not stable and is diversified depending 
on the operator (see Table I). 
It can be noted that the lowest mean value of the message 
delivery time (3.6 s) occurred in case of operator No. 3.

A slightly worse score can be seen in networks 1 and 4. 
The longest delivery times, and standard deviation as well, 
was offered by operator No. 2. Such rough analysis can lead 
us to the conclusion that the SMS does not work properly 
and many of users may be dissatisfied with the service.  
On the other hand, when we take into account the median, 
which is by definition the value located in the middle  
of the population, it can be noted that it is comparable with 
the appropriate parameters of the other operators. Moreover, 
the median value seems to be a better parameter describing 
the service quality experienced by the users in the case  
of high standard deviation of QoS parameters. As mentioned 
before, ETSI proposes to describe the message delivery time 
by presenting the time within which the fastest 95% of short 
messages are sent and received [22]. According to the above, 
the distributions of message delivery times as a function  
of the time of day are presented in Figures 8-11. The black 
points represent median values, whereas the dashed boxes 
show the ranges of delivery time after discarding 5%  
of the lowest and highest values, respectively. In another 
words, they represent 90% percent of the captured samples 
population. Moreover, the top level of each dashed box

Figure 11.  Short message delivery time in T-Mobile network as a function 
of the time of day 
denotes the highest limit of delivery time for 95%  
of messages sent in the relevant hour [22]. As presented  
in Figure 4, fluctuations of the message delivery time 
experienced by almost all SMS users of the Orange network, 
do not exceed the value of 6 seconds. The highest deviation 
is observed around 3 and 5 o’clock in the morning.  
The results of the observations performed in Play network 
show the values of delivery time deviation which are almost 
at the same level, except one hour (7 a.m.), during the whole 
day. However, comparing to the Orange network, the range 
of deviations, observed in the individual time intervals,  
is much wider here. It means that users of the Play network 
still experience relatively high fluctuations of message 
delivery times previous network, but comparable with them 
and better than obtained in Play network. It should be noted 
that the median values and deviations of the message 
delivery times, presented in Figures 8-11, are valid for 90%  
of observations and may slightly differ from the values 
shown in Table I, which takes into account all the captured 
data. Although the median (or even the mean) values  
of the message delivery times and their deviations can be 
used 
to 
compare 
the 
different 
operator’s 
network 
performances or QoS parameters, they do not answer  
the question concerning the quality assessed by the users.  
For this reason, the relation between objectively measured 
QoS parameters and the quality of experience (QoE),  
which is subjective, should be determined. 
IV. 
QOE MODEL 
This paragraph presents the methodology and test-bed 
(Figure 12) for assessing the quality experienced by users 
(QoE) 
of 
text 
messaging 
services. 
The 
concept  
of the measurement environment is based on the server 
emulating service provider and several test positions 
representing users of the service. Each position consists  
of a Personal Computer (PC) with a special application 
emulating the mobile phone that sends and receives short 
messages. In the experiment all test messages have the same 
messages. In the experiment all test messages have the same

Figure 12.  The laboratory test environment for the evaluation of text 
messaging Quality of Experience 
format and content. Users send a number of messages which 
are passed through the server to the destination addresses 
after a period of time which may be controlled during  
the test. After receiving the message, users assess the service 
quality 
by 
evaluation 
of 
end-to-end 
delivery 
time  
and choosing the appropriate marks from the MOS 
evaluation panel, where MOS stands for Mean Opinion 
Score, expressed in a 5-level scale (0 – the worst case and 5 
– the best one, respectively). All the test parameters and user 
marks are stored on the server and saved for further analysis. 
Several dozen users took part in the experiment and more 
than 1.2 thousand tests were performed. The results  
of the tests allowed building a QoE model (see Formula 1) 
which indicates a relationship between end-to-end message 
delivery time and service quality perceived by the users. 
Statistical 
analysis 
shows 
significant 
correlation  
(almost 80%) between message delivery times and the users’ 
evaluation grades. Next, a regression analysis was performed 
and, using ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation,  
the approximate relation between message delivery time  
and users’ grades (in MOS scale) was determined: 

MOS= -0,1 T +4,97



where: T - message delivery time. 
 
Due to the distribution of the data was not normal 
(checked by Shapiro-Wilk test [26]), authors made  
a validation of the model, using Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon 
(MWW) test [27], which can be applied on even unknown 
distributions, contrary to t-test which has to be applied only 
on normal distributions [28]. This test showed a good 
estimation of the users’ quality perception, under assumption 
of 95% confidence interval (significance level p<0.05). 
As it was mentioned before, the mean value of the QoS 
parameter sometimes might not be the best indicator  
of the network performance or the quality perceived  
by users. Therefore, authors presented the SMS QoE model 
which shows the relation between the message delivery 
times and the median values of user ratings (Figure 13). Thus 
the authors proposed a new name for the scale, i.e., Median 
Opinion Score (MedOS). The black points represent the 
median value, whereas upper level of the dashed boxes 
determine the scores given by the 95% of users experiencing 
the specific message delivery times. Four levels of the 
quality, acceptable by users, were defined, i.e., excellent 
quality (EQ), good quality (GQ), fair quality (FQ) and poor 
quality (PQ), respectively.

Figure 13.  The quality experienced by the users majority (MedOS scale) 
of the message delivery times are assigned to the proper 
quality levels (EQ, GQ, FQ or PQ) on the basis of median 
values of user scores, given for those times (see the dashed 
ellipses in Figure 13). According to ETSI [22], the quality 
levels should take into account the best 95% of samples. 
Excellent Quality level, denoted by EQ(95), is reached when 
the median of the user scores is equal to 5, and 95%  
of the samples have ratings equal or higher than 4.

The same procedure is applied to the other quality levels, 
respectively. In this way, the relations between the message 
delivery times (QoS) and proper quality levels (QoE) were 
determined. Table II presents, according to the MedOS scale,  
the measurement results obtained from the four examined 
real networks.

Next, the Weighted Average Quality Factor (WAQF) can 
be calculated using (2). It can be used as a parameter that 
allows a comparison of the SMS quality provisioned  
by different operators.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Nowadays, the text messaging is one of the most popular 
means of communication. Therefore, the high quality of the 
service is crucial in today’s competitive market. Operators 
should 
continuously 
monitor 
network 
performance 
parameters in order to detect and isolate the problems and 
different kinds of threats which can impact on the quality 
experienced by the end-users. Thus, it is very important

to have not only the knowledge about the values of 
objectively measured performance parameters, but also about 
their influence on the service quality subjectively perceived 
by the users. The results presented in the article show that the 
SMS provisioned by the operators functioning on the 
examined area of the Polish telecommunication market is of 
very good quality and can be used, to some extent, as a 
medium which supports also other kinds of text 
communication, especially those that requires short end-to-
end delivery times and immediate user-to-user interactions. 
Obviously, the message delivery time fluctuates during the 
course of the day and also depends on the operator, but 
generally brings great satisfaction for the users. It should be 
also noted that such, a relatively small, amount of collected 
data does not allow to make a general statement about the 
whole Polish network. Such generalization would be made 
after collecting data from a bigger and representative number 
of selected areas, which is to be done in the next step of the 
investigations. Authors want to underline that although SMS 
cannot be treated as a real-time messaging service, in some 
cases it can be used as an alternative. The main strengths of 
SMS are world-wide availability and no special requirements 
for the user equipment or specific software applications. 
Further work will be devoted to developing the QoE model 
towards more comprehensive investigation of the quality 
issues 
regarding 
not 
only 
intra- 
but 
inter-operator 
communication, as well.
