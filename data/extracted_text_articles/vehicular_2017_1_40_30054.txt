Abstract— 
In 
vehicle-to-infrastructure 
(V2I) 
communications, the challenge regarding how to achieve the 
intended performance at the minimal resource cost has yet 
been well addressed in the recent development of vehicular 
technologies. In this paper, we investigate some data 
transmission schemes, such as cooperative communications, 
for improving quality of service (QoS) in vehicular networks. 
We propose a method that facilitates V2I through vehicle-to-
vehicle (V2V) communications and, for this approach, we 
derive the closed-form expressions of the outage probability, 
throughput, energy efficiency and packet loss rate for four 
different transmission schemes investigated. The QoS 
performances can be optimized by finding appropriate 
transmission schemes with a certain number of relays within 
a given transmission distance. The proposed approach is also 
aimed to achieve the best performance trade-off between 
system reliability and efficiency under various environmental 
conditions.  
Keywords— QoS; V2I; V2V; cooperative communications.

 INTRODUCTION  
In Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication 
networks, mobile users are able to access Internet services 
such as traffic condition broadcast, video streaming, digital 
map downloading, and information of road hazard and 
accident alarm, via fixed roadside units. The most recent 
research in this area has been focused on the vehicular ad-
hoc networks (VANET) [1] [2], including its connection to 
the Fourth-Generation or Long-Term Evolution (LTE and 
LTE-Advance) cellular networks and the provision of good 
solutions to V2I in order to ensure low latency and high 
reliability communication [3].   
IEEE 802.11.p is one of the commonly used standards 
for V2I to support vehicular communications in highly 
mobile, often densely populated, and frequently non-line-
of-sight environments [4] [5]. In addition, the IEEE 
802.15.4 standard, comprising a simple physical (PHY) 
layer and an energy efficient medium access control layer, 
is also designed to support both real-time and contention-
based services and has been considered as a promising 
candidate for Internet of vehicles (IoV) and vehicular sensor 
networks [6]. To tackle the problem of high packet loss rate 
the cooperative communications techniques can be applied 
to enhance transmission reliability by creating diversity [7]. 
In this case, mobile nodes (vehicles) can help each other 
through relaying other node’s data and sharing their limited 
resources, to improve loss performance and increase 
transmission 
coverage. 
However, 
the 
performance 
enhancement by using relays nodes is constrained by the 
power (energy) budget imposed and high mobility in the 
vehicular network [8]. This issue can potentially impede the 
delivery of quality of service (QoS) in the V2I approach.  
In this work, we investigate both cooperative and non-
cooperative transmission schemes, and intend to reveal how 
these schemes perform in the context of a vehicular network, 
in terms of energy consumption, throughput and packet loss 
rate under different conditions, such as transmission 
distance, relaying method and channel condition (path loss 
exponent). These findings are used to identify proper 
transmission schemes that can optimize the system 
performance for the whole network in a changing 
environment. The proposed approach is unique in the sense 
that it provides an efficient way to find the best transmission 
method for transmission between any V2I links. We propose 
a method that facilitates V2I, which is assisted by vehicle-
to-vehicle (V2V) communications when needed, and 
evaluate the performance of this approach based on the 
models we derive. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section II discusses the relevance of this research with other 
work. The system models for both cooperative and non-
cooperative transmission schemes for V2I communications 
are presented in Section III. Simulation results produced by 
Matlab and NS-2 and discussions are presented in Section 
IV. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section V.

RELATED WORK  
Cooperative 
communications 
have 
been 
studied 
extensively for VANETs and two of the most common 
protocols of this technology are Amplify-and-Forward (AF) 
and Decode-and-Forward (DF) [9]. Cooperative or 
polarization diversity is created in these protocols through 
exploiting the broadcast nature of wireless channels and 
using relays to improve link reliability and throughput in a 
vehicular network [10]. In addition, the use of graph theory 
to formulate the problem of cooperative communications 
scheduling in vehicular networks is proposed in [11], in 
order to improve the throughput and spectral efficiency of 
vehicular networks.

Enhancing system efficiency is a key issue in applying 
cooperative communications in V2I approaches, depending 
on the connectivity probabilities in V2I and V2V 
communication scenarios in one-way and two-way platoon 
based VANETs [12]. Smart Antenna technology can also 
contribute to the increment of the service coverage and 
system throughput of V2I [13]. The capacity of V2I 
communications can be maximized by an iterative resource-
allocation method [14] and the efficiency of V2I 
communications can be improved by applying a scheme 
called Distributed Sorting Mechanism (DSM) [15]. To 
improve 
power 
efficiency 
in 
vehicle-to-roadside 
infrastructure 
(V2I) 
communication 
networks, 
[16] 
proposed a joint power and sub-carrier assignment policy 
under delay-aware QoS requirements. In addition, the 
strong dependence on the environment due to multipath 
propagation is also presented for a distributed energy 
efficient routing method [17].   
Most of the works have demonstrated the possibility of 
improving the system performance of vehicular networks 
by using different methods. However, there is a lack of 
information 
regarding 
how 
to 
choose 
a 
specific 
transmission scheme under different conditions in terms of 
the number of relaying branches and the number of relays 
for a given distance between source and destination nodes, 
in order to find a solution for ensuring the best QoS. 
In this paper, our focus will be the identification of the 
conditions for establishing appropriate transmission 
strategies among different commonly used transmission 
schemes, including both cooperative and non-cooperative 
schemes for V2I communications. Our approach is based 
on the development of analytical models for these 
transmission schemes and the assessment of their 
performances in reliability, energy efficiency and 
throughput. It also reveals the trade-offs between 
cooperative and non-cooperative transmission schemes and 
shows how to utilize this property to achieve the optimized 
performance 
through 
adaptive 
cooperative 
communications. 
III. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
 
In this section, the analytical models of the required 
transmitting power, outage probability, energy efficiency, 
throughput and packet loss rate in the context of a V2I 
network are established for both cooperative and non-
cooperative transmission schemes. Based on these models, 
an adaptive transmission strategy can be developed to 
optimize the system performance. 
 Given a V2I network with N vehicles, for any vehicle-
to-infrastructure pair (V, I), where V ϵ {1, . . . , N}, the goal 
of optimizing the transmission QoS is achieved by 
minimizing the total energy consumed per bit (or energy 
efficiency) with a given outage probability target, 
maximizing the end-to-end throughput, and minimizing the 
packet loss rate based on the transmission distance between 
V2I pairs, i.e. 
 
  𝑀𝑖𝑛 ∑ 𝐸𝑏𝑖 
               s.t.{poutVI} and 
         𝑀𝑎𝑥 ∑ 𝑆𝑡ℎ𝑖 
s.t.{dVI}                  (1) 
where Ebi and  Sthi  are the energy consumed per bit and 
throughput, respectively, of the i-th path between a vehicle 
(V)  and infrastructure (I), poutVI  and dVI  are the fixed outage 
probability target and the total transmission distance 
between V and I. 
Four transmission schemes in the context of V2I are 
identified in Figure1, including single-hop direct V2I (1a), 
multi-hop V2I via V2V (1b), cooperative V2I with a single 
relay (1c), and cooperative V2I with multiple relays (1d). In 
this work, we intend to examine the performances of 
different transmission schemes in terms of energy 
efficiency, throughput and packet loss rate, and to optimize 
them under different environmental conditions.  
We consider a V2I network in which the transmission 
links are subject to narrowband Rayleigh fading with 
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and propagation 
path-loss. The channel fades for different links are assumed 
to be statistically mutually independent. For medium 
access, vehicle nodes are assumed to transmit over 
orthogonal channels through using the service channels 
specified in IEEE801.11p [2], thus no mutual interference 
is considered in this system model. These channels can be 
reused by other vehicle away from a certain distance.

A. Non-Cooperative Transmission Scheme  
Consider the transmission scheme for a direct link (V, I) 
as shown Figure 1a where no relaying paths are involved. 
We use PSDir to denote the source transmission power for this 
case. For the direct transmission in the V-I link, the received 
symbol rVI and the spectral efficiency R can be modeled as:

the system bandwidth in Hertz. 
An outage occurs when the SNR at the receiver falls 
below a threshold β which allows error free decoding. This 
threshold is defined as β=22Rs-1, where Rs is the required 
system spectral efficiency. The outage probability of the 
single-hop transmission is given by [19]:

Energy consumption is largely proportional to the 
requirement of maintaining a certain level of transmission 
reliability or the successful transmission rate. In order to 
maintain a required level of reliability, denoted by U, which 
is related to the reliability of a transmission link, the 
minimum outage probability is defined as:

The main objective for the performance optimization of a

The multi-hop non-cooperative transmission scheme 
with n (n  1) relays is shown in Figure 1b. Each relay is able 
to detect if the packet was received correctly or not and will 
forward the information to the destination only in the case of 
the packet being correctly received. Otherwise, the packet is 
considered lost.

We set the transmit power to be proportional to the distance

B. Cooperative transmission Scheme 
 
In cooperative transmission, the sender V broadcasts its 
symbol in to all potential receivers including the destination 
I and relays in the current time slot. Two types of 
cooperative transmission schemes are considered here: 1) 
using multiple cooperative relaying branches with one relay 
in each branch (Figure 1c), and 2) multiple relaying 
branches with multiple relays in each branch (Figure 1d). 
The selective decode-and-forward (SDF) relaying protocol 
is used in these two schemes and relays perform 
cooperation when the information from the source is 
correctly received by them. Based on the derivations 
methods used in Subsection III. A, the following close-form 
expressions can be readily obtained.

The transmit power at relays can be reduced and 
consequently the energy efficiency will be improved by 
implementing the cooperative communications schemes, 
which are particularly suitable for long-range transmission 
- the related results will be shown in Section IV.  
IV. 
NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 In this section, we examine the performances of 
different transmission schemes through Matlab and NS-2 
simulations in terms of energy efficiency (energy 
consumption per bit), throughput and packet loss rate. We 
then reveal the conditions for selecting the optimal 
transmission schemes through comparisons between them. 
The network settings used for simulation is listed in TABLE 
1. Assume the spectral efficiency Rs in this scenario to be 2 
bit/sec/Hz, and the required system reliability level to be 
0.999. To generate mobility, mobility-files are created in 
ns-2 simulation. In addition, we assume that all the vehicles 
are running at the same speed and keeping the same distance 
with each other.  
In Figure 2 the energy performances of both cooperative 
and non-cooperative schemes are illustrated and compared. 
As we can see, the non-cooperative direct transmission has 
the lowest energy cost than all others transmission schemes 
for 
short-range 
(dVI<33m); 
the 
non-cooperative 
transmission using multi-hop relays outperforms the direct 
transmission for the range 33m<dVI<43m and, in particular, 
transmission using two intermediate relays (n=2) nodes has 
the lowest energy consumption for this range.  
The cooperative transmission outperforms the non-
cooperative 
transmission 
schemes 
for 
the 
range 
43m<dVI<58m, and the transmission using one branch with 
two relays (K=1, n=2) has the lowest energy consumption 
for this range. As distance continuously increases, the 
lowest energy consumption is achieved by transmission 
using two branches with one relay (K=2, n=1) for 58<dVI< 
80m, and by transmission using two branches with two 
relays (K=2, n=2) for dVI>80m.

TABLE 1. SIMULATION PARAMETER 
 
 
As shown in Figure 3, the non-cooperative direct 
transmission has much higher energy consumption than the 
optimum transmission scheme which is chosen based on the 
transmission distance between vehicles and infrastructure.  
The overall system throughput is shown in Figure 4 for 
three 
different 
vehicle 
velocities. 
The 
optimum 
transmission schemes clearly outperform the direct 
transmission schemes in all cases due to the impact of 
diversity created by cooperative transmission. It is also 
noticed that the throughput of the optimum transmission 
scheme decreases when the number of transmitting vehicles 
increases. This is mainly due to congestion in medium 
access and increased operation overhead at the nodes that 
are the source, as well as the relay at the same time. 
Figure 5 depicts the overall system packet loss rate for 
direct transmission and optimum transmission schemes 
versus the number of transmitting vehicles for different 
vehicle velocities. As it is shown, the packet loss rate 
increases when the number of transmitted vehicles 
increases for all the transmission schemes, which is caused 
by 
network 
congestion 
and 
correlated 
with 
the 
corresponding performance in throughput as shown in 
Figure 4. It is worth mentioning that the optimum 
transmission schemes have much lower packet loss rates 
than the direct transmission schemes as when relays are 
used the transmission distances between adjacent nodes are 
reduced and, at the same time, the transmission reliability is 
improved due to the diversity generated in cooperative 
communications.

Due to the scenario settings in our work where most 
vehicles have a fairly large distance between them and the 
roadside base station, no major difference in performance is 
observed when increasing the velocity of vehicles, as shown 
in Figures 4 and 5. In contrast, as discussed above, the 
performance such as throughput is correlated with the 
number of vehicles which are connected to the same base 
station,  
There are a number of factors affecting energy 
consumption, throughput and packet loss rate in V2I 
networks. Cooperative transmissions utilize additional 
paths and intermediate nodes which may cost more energy, 
but the diversity it creates can save energy by reducing the 
probability of link failure and consequently reducing the 
number of retransmissions. Diversity increases with the 
number of relay branches used but this increase could be 
marginal when the number of branches is large as it is 
difficult to ensure that all the branches are uncorrelated.  
Clearly, to achieve the best energy performance as 
discussed in this paper, proper transmission schemes should 
be selected for the given transmission conditions such as the 
overall distance, dSd, and channel quality in terms of α. The 
findings of this work can assist deciding when and how the 
cooperative or non-cooperative transmission scheme should 
be employed. Based on our investigation, an energy-
efficient transmission strategy can be formed in a V2I 
network by adaptively choosing proper transmission 
schemes under different network and transmission 
conditions. This involves determining the number of 
relaying branches and the number of relays if the 
cooperative scheme is to be used. By doing so, energy 
saving could be significant even with the direct 
transmission scheme in certain conditions, as shown from 
our results. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
We have investigated different transmission schemes in 
terms of their energy and throughput performances for V2I 
communications. We have shown that both cooperative and 
non-cooperative transmission schemes can exhibit the best 
performance under certain environmental conditions. The 
optimal transmission scheme can be identified given the 
distance between the source and destination nodes in a V2I 
network. The results presented in this paper can be used to 
form an adaptive transmission strategy that is able to select 
an appropriate transmission scheme in a changing 
environment to maintain the best QoS performance in a 
dynamic way, in terms of achieving the highest throughput 
with a fixed energy budget or the lowest energy cost for the 
given throughput target.
