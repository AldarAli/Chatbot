Abstract— This exploratory research analyzes the effect of 
mobile listening on spatial presence during audio fiction 
consumption. Spatial presence is the feeling of being physically 
located in a virtual environment or experiencing physical 
objects as if they were real. A quasi-experimental research was 
conducted with 2x2 factorial design, the independent variables 
being listening condition (moving vs. stationary) and two 
narratives (s1 vs. s2). 327 participants were randomly assigned 
to each of the experimental situations. For moving listening, 
they listened to the story while walking around the building 
and back to the place they started. For stationary, they listened 
while seated in the same place where the moving condition 
started. They completed a questionnaire with the spatial 
presence scale after listening. The main results show that 
mobility affects attention, spatial situation and high cognitive 
involvement. Listeners pay less attention to the story, 
concentrate on it less and it captures fewer of their feelings. 
Also, the spatial situation (the capacity to imagine the layout, 
the precise the spatial environment, the calculation of time and 
the specific mental image of the spaces presented in the story) 
is lower when the user moves in an open space while listening. 
Likewise, due to movement, there is less imagination of things 
related with the story, relation between things in the story 
itself, activation of thought and perception of the usefulness of 
the story. These results contribute to the understanding of the 
psychological processes associated to the reception while on the 
move.

presence; psychological processes.

 INTRODUCTION  
This exploratory research observes the effect of mobile 
listening on spatial presence during audio fiction 
consumption. The general concept of presence refers to the 
feeling of “being there” or “being inside” the scene where 
the story is unfolding. The phenomenon is often described 
as the perception of non-mediation [1]. It can be understood 
as the psychological state in which the person’s subjective 
experiences are created by some form of media technology, 
with a scant notion of how the technology shapes this 
perception [2]. According to Lee, presence is 
a 
psychological state in which the experience of virtuality 
goes unnoticed [3]. Spatial presence is one of the 
dimensions of presence [4]. It is specifically defined as the 
feeling of being physically located in a virtual setting or 
experiencing physical objects as if they were real [5].  
There is no known research that explores the effect of the 
modality of consumption (mobile or stationary) to the 
reception of sound products, in spite of the proliferation of 
audio portable devices and audio offers since long ago. The 
consumption of radio while on the move is nothing new, 
indeed. Particularly, there is a lack of empirical information 
on how mobile reception affects the psychological relation 
between audiences and audio products. In spite of that, there 
are tentative explanations of the characteristics of mobile 
listening in urban environments, particularly of music, 
which have originated from researchers from disparate 
disciplines. For example, it has been said that the use of 
earphones fosters the creation of a private listening bubble 
within a public space The earphones provide the ears with 
the personally desired listening experience that seeks to 
eliminate the sounds of congested industrial cities [6].  It has 
been also stated that the use of earphones produces a spatial 
experience of individual listening that destroys the 
perception of external space or position, and reveals the 
boundaries between private and public listening spaces [7]. 
As a matter of fact, it has been argued that audiences seek to 
engage with the media not only to connect, but also to 
disconnect from the different spheres of reality [8]. Finally, 
it has been proposed that due to the fact that we experience 
acoustic saturation because of the constant exchange of 
sounds caused by different media, modern-day listening is 
characterized by an overall and disengaged listening in 
which media sounds form our everyday background [9].  
Truax defines listening as a system of holistic 
interconnection between sound, the listener and the 
ambience [10]. This suggests that mobile urban listening, 
produced in physical places that are not designed for 
projecting sound, or for detailed mediation and exploration 
by the user, could affect the reception. That idea also 
implies that the qualities of the social setting in which 
listening occurs affect the actual sound due to the spatial 
characteristics of the surrounding urban geography, and the 
complexity of sounds produced for the spatial and temporal 
simultaneity of experiences, agents or events occurring 
within said geography. That idea also suggests that audio 
content could alter behaviour (e.g. moving in rhythm to 
music) or the psychological treatment of content or of one’s 
environment (e.g. reduce attention and/or affect spatial or 
temporal position).

In spite of the lack of known empirical evidence, some 
other 
researchers 
have 
also 
speculated 
about 
the 
consequences and/or effects of mobile listening using 
portable devices. For example, it is believed that the sounds 
that accompany an everyday action are used as tool for the 
appropriation of experiences [11]. It is stated that everyday 
mobile listening embellishes one’s own environment, marks 
frontiers, and controls time and/or learning, too [12]. The 
general belief is that mobility inevitably changes the way we 
relate both with sound and space, which, in turn, could 
affect behaviour [13]. Nevertheless, new listening practices 
have led to consumer habits that should be observed 
specifically by content and situation (in terms of mobility) 
and the listening environment [14][15].  
II. 
METHOD 
A. Participants 
There were 327 university students who cooperated with 
the research without receiving any compensation. 58.7% 
were women and 41.3% men. The average age was 21.18 
years (Rg = 17-40, SD = 3.99). The students were invited to 
collaborate in the vicinity of the Faculty of Communication 
Science, at a large University from Spain, where the data 
was collected.  
B. Procedure 
Quasi-experimental research was conducted with 2x2 
factorial design, the independent variables being listening 
condition (moving vs. stationary) and narrative (s1 vs. s2). 
The participants were randomly assigned to each of the 
experimental situations. The narratives used were two 
horror stories, of high aesthetic quality. 
Both listening situations were in the open air. For mobile 
listening, the participants were asked to listen to the story 
while walking around the Faculty building and back to the 
place they started. Having studied the route beforehand, we 
calculated that this was the distance required to hear the 
complete story and get back in time to answer the 
questionnaire immediately after. For stationary listening, the 
participants were asked to listen while seated in the same 
place where the moving condition started. All participants, 
but particularly the moving ones, were asked not to interrupt 
the narrative and to abstain from communicating with 
anybody while doing the experiment, as this could spoil the 
results. 
 
C. Materials 
The participants answered a questionnaire containing a 
35 item spatial presence previously formulated scale [16]. It 
was performed a factorial analysis of it. After different tests, 
it was agreed that the results offered by the method of 
varimax rotation and extraction of main components showed 
the clearest structure. The results revealed the existence of 8 
factors that together explain 68.50% of variance. The 
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Test value was .881 and 
Bartlett’s Sphericity was 5691.145. The model was 
statistically significant (p <.001) [17].  
The results of said procedure were fairly aligned with the 
proposal of the original scale, with some exceptions. To 
begin with, a difference was found in the first of the factors, 
which here contained 8 items. It was found that the factor 
was the subset of the 4 items that, in the scale’s proposal, 
appeared in the sub-factor self-location of spatial presence, 
plus the other 4 items of the sub-factor possible action, of 
the same spatial Presence. We therefore decided to call the 
factor obtained by this study spatial presence. Afterwards, 
another difference was found in the suspension of disbelief 
factor in the original scale, which in this study was divided 
into two different factors. Because of the items forming part 
of each, they were called persistence of disbelief and 
suspension of disbelief. Table 1 shows the first four factors 
that appeared during the validation of the scale and Table 2 
shows the next second four.  
Eight subscales were formed, each corresponding to one 
of the factors, based on the sum of the partial scores of each 
item. We also obtained an overall index of spatial presence 
from the sum of all scores of all items in the scale. These 
were incorporated in the analysis.  
 
III. 
RESULTS 
Results show an effect of listening condition on some of 
the dimensions of the factors. There were found statistical 
differences for attention (F = .769, t = -1.93, p >.054), 
which was higher when stationary (M = 5.18, SD = 1.15, N 
= 168) than when moving (M = 4.93, SD = 1.15, N = 159). 
Attention to the story, thus, is greater when the receiver is 
stopped than when he/she is on the go. Listeners pay less 
attention to the story and concentrate less on it during 
movement. Moreover, the story captures less their feelings 
or they full dedication to it.  It could be explained by the 
conjunction of two facts. First, people need to pay attention 
to their own movements and to the characteristics of the 
road, for assuring successful displacements. Second, the 
sounds of the audio narrative could interact with those of the 
environment. It is expectable that in noisy spaces, like those 
of densely-populated urban cities, attention to the story 
could even decrease. The experiment was produced in the 
calm area that surrounds a within campus school.  
There were also found differences for spatial situation (F 
= .665, t = -2.58, p <.010), which was higher when 
stationary (M = 5.14, SD = 1.16, N = 168) than when 
moving (M = 4.80, SD = 1.21, N = 159). Likewise, there 
was found a tendency towards difference for high cognitive 
involvement (F = .220, t = -1.83, p >.067), which tended to 
be greater when stationary (M = 4.42, SD = 1.15, N = 168) 
than when moving (M = 4.18, SD = 1.19, N = 159). These 
two results are logical and coherent between them. The first 
one recognizes that the intellectual characterization of the 
spatial situation in which the narrative takes place is 
affected by the movement of the listener.

Considering all of the above, it means that the capacity of 
imagining the layout of the spaces presented in the story, the 
precision of the idea about the configuration of the spatial 
environment recreated by the narrative, the calculation of 
the size of the space in which the story develops, and the 
specific mental image of the space recreated are greater 
when the listener is stopped than when is moving. Besides, 
results show that the intellectual link with the narrative 
decreases on the move. In comparison when they are 
stationary, listeners who move think less about things 
related to the story, about the relation of the story with other 
people, about the personal usefulness of the narrative, and 
about the thoughts provoked by the story. All of this 
confirms that the intellectual involvement with the audio 
narrative, probably because of the effect of the lowering of 
attention, is affected by the mode of consumption.  
Regarding the effect of the story on the factors that 
define spatial presence, we found statistical differences for 
cognitive involvement (F = 2.159, t = -2.13, p =.034), which 
was higher for s2 (M = 4.44, SD = 1.22, N = 162) than s1 (M 
= 4.16, DS = 1.11, N = 165). We also found differences for 
persistence of disbelief (F = .305, t = -2.03, p >.043), which 
was higher for s2 (M = 4.44, DS = 1.50, N = 162) than for s1 
(M = 4.10, SD = 1.50, N = 165). Finally, we found a 
tendency towards difference for special interest (F = 1.67, t 
= -2.07, p >.039), which tended to be greater for s2 (M = 
3.92, SD = 1.52, N = 162) than for s1 (M = 3.56, SD = 1.64, 
N = 165). 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The reported results led us to conclude that mobility 
during audio narrative reception affects attention, spatial 
situation, and high cognitive involvement. Particularly, 
mobility causes attention to the audio product to be lower: 
listeners pay less attention to the story, concentrate on it less 
and the narrative captures fewer of receivers’ feelings.  
Also, when the user moves in an open space while 
listening, spatial situation (the capacity to imagine the 
layout, the precise the spatial environment, the calculation 
of time and the specific mental image of the spaces 
presented in the story) is lower.  
Likewise, due to movement, compared to stationary 
listening, there is less imagination of things related with the 
story, relation between things in the story itself, activation 
of thought and perception of the usefulness of the story.  
This result makes sense given the experimental 
conditions of our study: the participants listened in the open 
air with no restrictions on movement in space (although 
those in the stationary condition were asked to remain 
seated). But it suggests something else, in light of the 
contributions regarding acoustic aesthetics [19]: during non 
captive audio consumption, and in which movement is 
possible, in the definition of the psychological state of 
spatial presence there could be interaction between the 
localization and perception of actions possible in the real 
world, and those of the story’s imaginary world. The 
sensation of being situated in the mediated space [20], and 
in the real physical space in which the mediation occurs, 
may interact. So, although presence is a psychological state 
in which the qualities of the media are more influent than 
the inherent properties of the experience [21], this would 
also have an effect.  
All this data, of which we know of no previous 
equivalents, contribute to the study of the formation of 
mental images, especially those produced by audio or 
radiophonic products [18] and their relation with behaviour. 
In this sense, further studies could observe the effect of 
audio narrative engagement in movement itself and in the 
relation of listener to specific behaviours. In fact, it is 
somehow surprising that, in spite of the long history of radio 
contents, their consumption while moving through different 
means, and the proliferation of portable audio devices, this 
topic had not been investigated previously. In the light of 
the creative possibilities that new digital technologies offer 
to the production of all kind of contents, the results of this 
study could be useful for conceiving more effective 
contents, messages, products, and modes of consumption. 
Apart from being of the interest of digital contents 
producers and technological developers, the results of this 
study could be useful for audiovisual regulatory authorities. 
These studies can also be of interest to different scientific 
disciplines (e.g., psychology, neuropsychology, acoustics, 
aesthetics, audiovisual communication, engineering, or 
narrative studies). Given that this investigation only 
examined the effect of behaviour on psychological 
responses to narratives, a first reverse study could be made 
of the effect of psychological responses on specific aspects 
of behaviour.  
ACKNOWLEDGMENT 
This study is part of a bigger research that explored the 
effect of the consumption mode on narrative engagement. 
The complete results of the project are expected to be 
published during 2014 [22].
