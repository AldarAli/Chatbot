Abstract—This paper is based on two parts. In Part 1, we
shall present a new Ultra Low Voltage Static differential NOR
topology. This will show how Ultra Low Voltage circuits are
designed and what are the pros and cons of these circuits. In
Part 2, utilizing the design presented in Part 1, we shall present
a novel design of an Ultra Low voltage Carry Gate. This shall
emphasize the use of such design in an application such as carry
gate. The Ultra Low Voltage topologies presented in Part 1 are
well known for their high speed relative to conventional CMOS
topologies regarding subthreshold operation. The main objective
is to target the robustness of the presented ciruits. We shall
also imply as to what extent these circuits can be improved and
what their beneﬁts, compared to conventional topologies, are. The
design presented in Part 2, compared to a conventional CMOS
carry gate, is area efﬁcient and high speed. The relative delay of
a Ultra Low Voltage carry gate lies at less than 3% compared to
conventional CMOS carry gate. The circuits are simulated using
the TSMC 90nm process technology and all transistors are of
the Low Threshold Voltage type.
Index Terms—ULV; Carry Gate; NP domino.
I. INTRODUCTION PART 1
Technology, being an important factor of the modern civ-
ilization, has been facing challenges enormously in every
aspect. Demand for low power and faster logic pursue an
overwhelming position in modern electronic industry. As the
industrial demand grows for the CMOS transistor, from time to
time it needs to go through rehabilitation process accordingly.
However, as the Moores law suggests, advancement in CMOS
technology, in the means of dimension scaling has almost
hit a barrier for a number of reasons. The most important
one is power dissipation at the smaller dimensions of the
transistor. To overcome this problem, a number of approaches
have been proposed [1][2]. Scaling supply voltage (VDD),
being prominently the most effective, has been proposed and
adopted by many [3][4][5]. However, scaling supply voltage
has an adverse affect on the performance of the CMOS circuits
as it decreases the ON current ION and hence the speed.[6]
presents a solution to this problem by employing ﬂoating gate
Ultra Low Voltage (ULV) design, which raises the DC level
of the input ﬂoating node even more than the supply voltage
itself and thereby increasing the ION.
Floating-gate is achieved by connecting a capacitor at the
input of the transistor gate. This isolates the gate terminal
electrically, i.e., no DC path to a ﬁxed potential. Such a gate
is called non-Volatile Floating-gate. Given that the transistor
dimensions are smaller than 0.13 µm and gate oxide is less

than 70AA 1
2, there shall be a signiﬁcant gate leakage current.
To avoid this leakage, frequent initialization of the gate is
required. This can be achieved by connecting ﬂoating gates
of the NMOS input transistor and PMOS input transistor to,
a ﬁxed potential, i.e. through a PMOS to the Voffset+ and
through NMOS to the Voffset- respectively. This approach,
ﬁrst presented in [4], is called semi-ﬂoating gate (SFG) and
has been used in this paper. In Section I-A, a brief introduction
to ULV design is presented. Section II, presents, ﬁrst, a Non-
differential circuit proposed in [7] and thereby presents a new
solution to the problem encountered in non-differential ULV
circuit by designing a new NP domino static differential ULV
NOR. In Section III, we shall present the simulation results
of all the ULV circuits and Dual Rail domino NOR relative
to conventional NOR.
A. ULV Inverter
1) Evaluation and Precharge Phase: A simple ULV in-
verter model is presented in the Figure 1a. A ULV SFG
circuit design consists of two phases. An evaluation phase,
determined by the evaluation transistors En and Ep, and a
precharge phase determined by the precharge transistors Rn
and Rp. As seen in the Figure 1a inverted clock (φ) is applied
to Rn and clock (φ) is applied to Rp. In such a circuit,
the precharge phase occurs when φ=0 and the circuit enters
evaluation phase when φ=1. During the precharge phase, the
input ﬂoating nodes are charged to a desired level, i.e, logical
1 or VDD for the En ﬂoating gate and logical 0 or Ground

(GND) for the Ep ﬂoating gate. No input transition occurs
during the precharge phase. However, once the clock shifts
from logical 0 to 1 and has reached a stable value of 1, an input
transition may occur, which determines the logical state of the
circuit’s output. We can engage the circuit in an NP domino
chain by connecting the source terminal of En to φ (where
φ=1 during the precharge phase) and the source terminal of
the Ep to VDD. Such a conﬁguration gives us a precharge
level of logical 1 and is called an N-type circuit. On the other
hand, if we connect the source terminal of En to GND and
the source terminal of the Ep to φ we can obtain a precharge
level of 0. Such a conﬁguration is called a P-type circuit.
Considering the example of N-type inverter, we know that
the output of the N-type is precharged to 1. Once φ shifts
from 0 to 1, circuit enters the evaluation phase. During the
evaluation phase, there are two possible scenarios. If no input
transition occurs, the output shall remain unchanged and hold
its value to 1. Indicating that no work is to be done. However,
if an input transition occurs and input is brought to 1 the En2
shall be turned on and the output shall be brought to logical
0 or close to 0. This indicates that the only work to be done
during the evaluation phase is to bring the output from 0 to 1
when an input transition occurs.
We have seen that the only work that is to be done, during
the evaluation phase, is to bring the output to the logical 0
when an input transition occurs. This suggests that Ep2 does
not require an input transition at any stage. Therefore, we can
remove the input capacitor of Ep2. Such a conﬁguration can
be called pseudo SFG ULV inverter and is shown in Figure 1c.
An equivalent P-type Pseudo SFG ULV inverter is shown in
Figure 1b. This will lead to load reduction and hence higher
speed. However, we may encounter some robustness issues
with respect to noise margin due to leakage current.
II. METHODS
A. Non-differential ULV NOR circuit
A Non-differential Dynamic ULV NOR (DULVN) and
Static ULV NOR (SULVN) gate is shown in Figure 2. Recall
conﬁguration of ULV inverter. The only difference in conﬁgu-
ration of ULV NOR circuit is that, in order to obtain a P-type
DULVN, we have to apply an extra input at the evaluation
transistor Ep1 in a P-type inverter. In order to obtain N-type
DULVN employ an extra evaluation transistor En1 in parallell
with En2.
The SULVN is conﬁgured in the same manner as the
DULVN. However, we add keeper transistor in the described
conﬁguration. An NMOS keeper is connected to the ﬂoating
gate of En1 and a PMOS keeper is connected to the ﬂoating
gate of the Ep2 in P-type and N-type SULVN, respectively.
However, these circuits are prone to some noise margin (NM)
issues due to precharged input ﬂoating nodes that holds it’s
value under evaluation phase. Thereby resulting in short circuit
leakage current. In order to solve this problem, let us consider
an example of N-type DULVN. Discharging of the ﬂoating
gate of the En1/n2, when no input transition occurs, and
charging of the ﬂoating gate of the Ep2 with VDD, when
an input transition occur, will ensure a better noise margin.
This can be achieved by engaging keeper transistors at these
nodes and connecting the source and drain terminal of the
keeper transistors Kp and Kn, respectively, which may not
interupt in precharging of the ﬂoating gate and and still
manages to discharge these nodes under evaluation phase when
required. A problem with such a circuit is the potential false
output transient if the input transient is signiﬁcantly delayed
compared to the clock edge [7]. Synchronization of the signals
employed through the keeper transistors with the input may
solve the problem.
B. Static differential ULV NOR
A static differential ULV NOR (SDULVN) gate will always
have the same precharge level at the both outputs in the
preacharging phase and differential outputs in the evaluation
phase. A SDULVN gate is shown in Figure 3. We have
connected outputs of the opposite ends, Vout+ and Vout−, at
the drain terminals of the both keeper transistors. In order to
achieve maximum robustness, MTCMOS method is used, i.e,
transistors in the path with critical timing has lower threshold
voltage, to achieve the maximum speed, and transistor in the
path with critical leakage issues has higher threshold voltage,
to achieve the minimum leakage.
III. SIMULATION RESULT
We have simulated four different topologies, conventional
Dual Rail domino NOR, DULVN, SULVN and SDULVN
each with a load of FO1. Worst case scenario for three
ULV topologies, considering delay, is when both inputs has
opposite logical values and considering power and NM is
when the output holds the precharged value under evaluation
phase.
A. EDP and PDP of Dynamic, Static, Differential ULV topol-
ogy and dual rail domino NOR
It is suggested in [3] that in subthreshold regime the
transistor may operate as a current source, hence switching
the output. Author suggests that the transistor may work as
a current source for as little as 100 mV at room temprature.

So, before we start analyzing EDP and PDP for varied
supply voltages, we have to set some limits that constitutes
a functional circuit. Mentioned earlier, dynamic and static
topologies suffers from current leakage problem. So as we
increase the VDD current leakage increase resulting in a
non-functional circuit. However, this can be overcommed
by strengthening down the transistor. SDULVN manages to
integrate itself according to the input provided. So, even if the
output is delayed and a leakage occur, at the arrival of input
it will manage to change the output accordingly. However, if
the leakage in device is greater than VDD/2, we may not be
able to measure a propagation delay. Figure 4 highlights the
leakage problem, where a measurement of propagation delay
is avoided due to early switching of the output. Thus, in order
to achieve maximum robustness, we shall consider a circuit
non-functional if the output of the circuit exceeds VDD/2.

Figure 5 shows improved noise margin of differential
topology with respect to dynamic and static topology at
supply voltage of 300 mV. Keeper transistors manages to turn
off the evaluation transistors when required. Consequently,
SDULVN has 30% and 36% better noise margin in worst
case scenario compared to SULVN and DULVN, respectively.
Delay of ULV NOR topologies relative to conventional
NOR can be seen in Figure 6. Average relative delay of
SDULVN lies at 6%, i.e, to switch an output SDULVN
consumes 6% of time consumed by a conventional NOR
to switch an output. Figure 7 shows the PDP of three
ULV topologies. It shows that ratio between the relative
delay and relative power normalizes itself to unity at some
supply voltages yet SDULV wins at most of them. EDP
graph shown in Figure 8 again displays enhanced speed of
the ULV topologies overcomes exaggerated power dissipation.

B. Maximum and minimum Supply voltage and Minimum
energy point
Threshold voltage for these low voltage transistor lies
around 260 mV with normal strength. As we have strengthen
up the evaluation transistor, threshold point decreases. So,
we can see from Figure 9 that minimum energy point
of differential topolgy lies around 220 mV. Taking into
consideration our limits that constitutes a functional circuit
we got minimum and maximum VDD at 180mV and 380mV,
respectively.
C. Process and mismatch variation
Attributes of a transistor at 90nm process suffers from
variation under fabrication. Such variations can be of two
types, inter-die, where all the transistors are printed on one
die and may be shorter than normal because they were etched
excessively, and intra-die, where number of dopant atoms
implanted varies from neighboring transistor [8]. A change in
behavior of the circuit can occur due to variation in Vt and
channel length. Therefore, it is important to highlight this
variation in any circuit. In order to obtain an idea of how
robust a circuit tends to be toward process and mismatch
variation, Monte Carlo simulation environment is the best
solution to apply. A number of precautions can be taken to
avoid further variation. Such as sizing up transistors, carefull
layout design and so on. Law of Large number indicates
that the larger the number of trials the closer it would be
to expected value. Therefore, the number of simulations in
Monte Carlo should be high as possible. We have used 100
simulations to mark the mean value.
D. PDP, EDP and minimum energy point results in Monte
Carlo environment
Figure 10 shows that the minimum energy point shifts from
220 mV to 250 mV due to process and mismatch variation.
As stated earlier Vt varies due to random number of dopant
atom. This results in slight randomness in behavior of the

topologies relative to conventional NOR and compared to
Dual rail domino NOR. Figure 12 shows that EDP ﬂuctuates
from having relative mean value of 76% to 120% due to
process variation.
E. Yield and 3σ EDP variation
As described earlier, we have to set a limit to differ
between a functional and non-functional circuits. Considering
those limits we have taken out graph for yield of all these
circuits. Figure 13 shows that of ULV gates SDULVN has the
best yield at an average of 82% yield compared to SULVN
and DULVN, which have an average of 66% and 58% yield
respectively.

As we know that objective of employing semi ﬂoating
gate is to increase the current to increase the speed of
the circuit. PDP is independent of current as shown in
(1). Therefore, in order to obtain a variation that occurs
due to higher current we have to focus on variation of
EDP. Figure 13 shows 3σ variation of the EDP for four
different NOR topologies. We can see that below minimum
energy point of SDULVN the variation are alot higher than
conventional topology. However, above this point, the EDP
variation in SDULVN is better than Dual Rail domino NOR
and almost at same level as in DULVN and conventional NOR.

is still 17× faster. The output leakage problem encountered

V. INTRODUCTION PART 2
As stated earlier, the demand for Ultra Low Voltage (ULV)
circuits is increasing with the growth of the semiconductor
industry. These circuits are being implemented in VLSI, where
different kind of functions are combined on one chip. The
Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU)s are one of the many circuits
that are implemented in the VLSI chips. Since an adder is
an important part of the ALU, the speed of the adder used,
is important for the ALU’s performance. The speed of the
adder is determined by the propagation delay of the carry
chain. Although high speed conventional carry circuits like
Carry Look Ahead, Dual rail domino carry, CPL, etc., are
well established design topologies, their performance suffers
from degradation at ULV [9]. Several approaches are proposed
for the improvement in performance [10][11] but the design
presented in this paper is inﬂuenced by [12]. This paper shall
present a new high speed NP domino ULV carry design. To
highlight the improvement, the results shall be compared to
conventional domino design such as Dual Rail Domino carry.
In order to show as to what extent one is better than the other,
regarding their speed and power, both the carry circuits are
implemented in a 32-bit carry chain.
Section I-A presented a general introduction to the ULV
circuits presented in [4]. Section VI presents different conﬁg-
urations of ULV carry designs and gives an explanation on
how it works. Section VII presents the performance of the
proposed ULV carry gate compared to the conventional carry
gate.

The output of a carry circuit is generated using two inputs
and a carry bit from the previous stage, if available (carry
bit at the least signﬁcant bit is always zero so it has no
previous carry), as shown in Figure 15. Equation (3) shows
an arithmetic approach to carry generation, where A and B
is the input signal and Cin is the carry bit from the previous
stage. There are two parts of this equation, one is generated
internally, A · B, and can be called carry generation (CG),
the other one is dependent on the carry bit from the previous
stage, (Cin · (A ⊕ B)), and is known as carry propagation
(CP). The speed of any carry chain depends on the second
part of this equation, because it has to wait for the carry bit
from the previous stage to arrive. Inputs A and B both arives
simultaneously at any stage of an N bit carry chain. Most
conventional designs use two seperate parts for CG and CP but
the design presented in this paper differs from the most designs
as it is able to generate both CG and CP by applying all the
inputs to a single transistor. This technique is called Multiple
valued Logic (MVL), where classical truth value, logical 1
and 0, are replaced by ﬁnit or inﬁnite logical values. It has a
potential to decrease the chip area and total power dissipation
[13].
A. Non-Differential Carry Gate
The Static Ultra Low Voltage Carry (SULVC) is a modiﬁed
version of the ULV N-P domino inverter shown in Section
I-A. The carry circuit uses a keeper, as proposed in [4], and
3 capacitors in parallel at the input gate providing the input
logic for the circuit. The circuit is designed to make the input
signals, A and B signal, cancel each other out when A and
B have contrasting values to allow the carry input signal
to determine the carry output in this case. Because of the
cancellation requirement between the A and B signals they
need to arrive as equally sized rising or falling transitions,
this can be acheived by utilizing level-to-edge converters or a
logic style with a VDD/2 precharge level.
If both A and B are rising, the ﬂoating node will rise
causing a falling transition on the carry output of the N-

type circuit regardless of the carry input signal. If they are
both falling, the carry input signal can not elevate the ﬂoating
node voltage enough to cause a transition, leaving the carry
output at precharge level. If A and B are not equal, their two
transitions cancels each other out and the ﬂoating node remains
at precharge level until a possible rising edge occurs on Cin.
A P-type equivalent of the circuit is shown in Figure 16 (b),
where all signals and logic are the inverse of those in the
N-type circuit. For both circuits, a transition on the output
indicates carry propagation and they can both be characterized
as a carry generate circuit corresponding with the truth table
shown in Table I, the transition logic for the N-type circuit
can be seen in Table II.
During the precharge phase, the voltage level of the ﬂoating
node is set to ground for the P-type circuit and VDD for the
N-type and can only be changed by the inputs through the
capacitors in the evaluation phase. In these circuits, when used
in CPAs (Carry Propagate Adder), Cin can arrive later than A
and B when the carry bit has to propagate through the chain
of carry circuits. This introduces the challenge of keeping the

output precharge value during the evaluation phase in case no
carry signal arrives. As Figure 17 shows, the ﬂoating node
of the P-type circuit is precharged to 0V. This causes the
transistor Ep2 in Figure 17 (b) to conduct and the output will
drift and may eventually cause an incorrect output value as
shown in Figure 18 at 70ns. The drifting effect is countered
with the Kn2 and Kp2 keeper transistors but the effect limits
the length of the evaluation pase and therby the number of
carry circuits that can be put in a chain and the maximum
number of bits an adder based on the circuit can process in one
clock cycle. The maximum achieved number of bits acheived
varies with the supply voltage as shown in Figure 19 and at
300 mV a 32-bit carry chain can be implemented.
The transistor sizing is adjusted to accommodate the change

voltage. In these simulations, the NMOS evaluation transistor
size is kept minimum sized and the PMOS evaluation transistor
length is changed to match the NMOS drive strength.
B. Differential Carry Gate
In order to overcome the challenges with robustness and
drifting of the SULVC circuit, a differential approach is a
possible solution. A Static Differential Ultra Low Voltage
Carry (SDULVC) as shown in Figure 20 is designed in exactly
the same manner as the SULVC, however, with differential
inputs and outputs. The differential nature of the circuit makes
it less prone to drifting and eliminates the need for level-
to-edge converters it can be sized to allow a single edge
without causing an output transition. The outputs of the
proposed circuit are precharged to the same level during the
precharge phase, however, it yields a differential output during
the evaluation phase. So, instead of employing an inverter to
obtain the carry bit we can read it from the opposite end of
the circuit, i.e., in an N-type SDULVC if inputs A, B, and C
are applied to En2 output can be read from Vout−. Figure 20
demonstrates the design of an SDULVC circuit. The backgate
of the keeper transistors of these circuits are connected to the
ﬂoating gate to achieve maximum robustness.

The variable ’i’ in (4) denotes the index of the input and
the ’n’ denotes fan-in. Vinitial is the precharge voltage level of
the ﬂoating gate. CinHigh is a combination of input capacitors
with a high (rising) input.
Considering an example of an N-type SDULVNC, we can
calculate the voltage level of the ﬂoating gate using (4). We
assume that the diffusion capacitance is equal to the input
capacitance and that the supply voltage is equal to the input
voltage. The load capacitance introduced by the keeper’s back-
gate connection to the ﬂoating node should also be considered

and in this paper is assumed to be equal to the input capacitor
as well.
Our calculation in (4) gives us a theoretical idea of the
voltage level at Vfg (ﬂoating gate voltage). In the real world,
the capacitance size might not be exactly the same as our
assumption and depends on transistor size and many other
factors like process variation and mismatch. The simulation
results of the voltage levels for the ﬂoating gate in Figure 21
shows that the ﬂoating node is precharged to 270mV. Equation
(4) yields an analytical result for the ﬂoating gate input of 330
mV, 390mV and 450 mV for one, two and three high inputs,
respectivly. The simulation results in Figure 21a shows that
the voltage level of the ﬂoating node gets to 330mV for a
single rising input transition and to 420mV when all inputs are
high. These results are marginally different from the calculated
values. This is possibly due to the assumptions on capacitance
sizes. Figure 21a shows that if only one input gets high, the
keeper transistor turns on and discharges the ﬂoating node. The
reason for this is that the transition at the input, i.e., 60mV, is
not sufﬁcient to produce enough current at the output. Figure
21b shows the results for two high inputs and all low inputs.

VII. SIMULATION
A. 32 bit SDULVC chain
A 32 bit ULV carry chain is implemented using 32
SDULVC circuits connected in a chain or NP domino fashion
shown in Figure 22. Figure 24 shows the simulation response
of a 32 bit ULV carry chain. The propagtion delay of this carry
chain is 17ns. In order to compare the SDULVC to other carry
gate topologies, a dual rail domino carry gate designed in a
hybrid fashion, i.e., instead of utilizing conventional inverters
at the output, the Static Differential ULV inverter presented in
[14] and a conventional NP Domino Dual Rail carry is used.
Compared to the hybrid dual rail domino carry (HDRDC)
chain shown in the Figure 23 the SDULVC chain is almost
10× faster and compared to a Conventional Dual Rail Domino
Carry (CDRDC) this is closer to 35×. These numbers are
based on the propagation delay for the carry bit through the
chain, which is 166ns for the hybrid dual rail domino carry
and 636ns for the conventional dual rail domino carry, all at
300 mV.
The robustness of the SDULVC can be analyzed by looking
at the simulation response shown in Figure 24b. The plot for
the worst case delay scenario, i.e., A=1, B=0, C=0, exhibits
that due to a delayed carry bit and the early arrival of inputs,
A and B, a marginal transition at the output occurs. However,
once the carry bit has arrived, the output shifts to its ﬁnal
value. Average transition at the output for a P-type and N-type
SDULVC when waiting for the carry bit is between 70mV and
100mV. This can be seen as a problem for the noise margin
and power consumption. The output manages to return to the
right ﬁnal value due to synchronisation of keeper signals with
the input. Therefore, the issue of noise margin can be ignored
by concluding that the ﬁnal value can be read at the end of
the evaluation phase.
Figure 25 shows the delay of an SDULVC chain compared

to an HDRDC and a CDRDC chain. Table III shows that the
transistor size has to be increased in order to increase the ON
current of the device [3] and be able to decrease the supply
voltage for HDRDC. Table IV shows the minimum operat-
ing frequency required for the clock to simulate SDULVC,
HDRDC and CDRDC at different supply voltages.
B. PDP and EDP of SDULVC chain
PDP charachteristics of a circuit highlights its efﬁciency
with respect to power consumtion. A low PDP means a more
energy efﬁcient circuit. Although the ULV circuits presented
in this paper are power hungry, it still manages to maintain its
PDP at approximately the same level as conventional circuits
where the power consumption is lower. The average power
of the HDRDC and the SDULVC is 0.347µW and 1.28nW
respectively at a supply voltage of 300 mV. This indicates that
the power consumption of HDRDC is up to 3× better than
ULV circuits. However, at the same supply voltage the ULV
circuit is 10× faster than the HDRDC. Therefore, the ULV

circiuts are still more energy efﬁcient. Figure 26 shows PDP
of three different 32 bit carry chain topologies at varied supply
voltage. The minimum energy point of the 32 bit SDULVC
carry chain is found at 240 mV.
Another important charachteristic of any circuit is EDP. It
demonstrates enhanced speed of any circuit with respect to
its energy efﬁeciency. It is obvious that circuits with better
propagation delay shall stand out in this characteristic. Figure
27 shows the EDP of three carry chains and the evident
performance advantages of SDULVC circuits.
VIII. CONCLUSION PART 2
In this paper, a new ULV carry circuit has been presented
and performance enhancements have been demonstrated. The
ULV carry circuits are better than conventional topologies in
both speed and energy efﬁciency, shown by comparing the
SDULVC to the HDRDC and CDRDC circuit topologies. A
credible conclusion is that a static differential dynamic ULV
carry circuit is a favorable choice when speed and robustness
at low voltages are important.
