Abstract— Objective and quantitative data, which indicate 
when and how much moviegoers are engaged with movies is 
important for movie makers when creating a film. However, 
with the traditional method of a review questionnaire, it is 
difficult to determine precisely the degree to which moviegoers 
were engaged and when this occurred. To evaluate the 
Attentional 
Engagement 
(AE) 
precisely, 
we 
used 
electroencephalogram (EEG) on Japanese students who were 
watching the American movie Iron Man. We found a 
significant decrease in the EEG power in the low-alpha-
frequency band while the participants watched film content 
evoking subjective higher attention. To use our results as 
reference data for a neuromarketing service, we suggest a 
procedure with criteria evaluating the quality level of data. 
According to this procedure, the EEG power values of AE for 
the movie Iron Man can serve as standard reference data with 
quality level of validated.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Immersion, like flow, has been used to describe the 
degree of an experience of feeling deeply engaged with types 
of media such as novels, movies, computer games, and 
virtual reality. To enter engagement, the first stage of 
immersion, users (e.g., gamers, moviegoers, etc.) have to 
invest time, effort, and attention [1][2]. Objective and 
quantitative measurements are important for media makers to 
determine when and how much media users are engaged 
with media. Standard marketing techniques employed for 
movies thus far have involved the use of interviews and 
questionnaires after participants view a movie. While useful, 
it is difficult with these methods to determine precisely the 
degree to which they were engaged or when they became 
engaged. If technology, which can measure variations in 
media users’ levels of engagement is developed, it would 
help media makers when designing media content to induce 
the intended level of engagement. Currently, the focusing of 
attention can be monitored by measuring associated changes 
in brain electrical activity by means of electroencephalogram 
(EEG) [3][4]. Thus, in principle, EEG measures have the 
potential to provide a more direct and objective method for 
gauging the intensity and nature of moviegoer engagement 
[5][6].  
Recently, with neuromarketing technology, defined as 
the application of neuroscientific methods to analyze and 
understand human behavior in relation to markets and 
marketing exchanges, marketing-relevant human behaviour 
can be understood [7][8][9][10][11]. However, it is difficult 
to measure physiological signals compared to the ease with 
which subjective review questions can be given. Therefore, 
many researchers want to share physiological signal data. 
Hence, a neuromarketing service, which computes the 
Attentional Engagement (AE) of moviegoers by measuring 
physiological signals is necessary and important in film 
production.  In addition, to ensure the reliability of the 
service, it is also important to evaluate the quality of the data. 
The issues and practices with regard to a data evaluation 
include accessibility in data collection, reproducibility of 
basic evaluations, consistency in relational analyses, and 
predictability in modelling [12]. The purpose of a 
measurement is to determine the value of the measurand, that 
is, the value of the particular quantity to be measured. In 
general, the result of a measurement is only an 
approximation or estimate of the value of the measurand and 
thus is complete only when accompanied by a statement of 
the uncertainty of that estimate. The uncertainty in the result 
of a measurement generally consists of several components 
which may be grouped into two categories according to the 
way in which their numerical value is estimated. These are A) 
those which are evaluated by statistical methods, and B) 
those which are evaluated by other means [13].  
In the present study, to serve as a reference data for  
neuromarketing in film industry, we measured the AE of 
participants as they watched movies. To validate the 
reliability of the reference data, we suggested a procedure 
with criteria, which evaluates the quality level of reference 
data. Finally, we applied the procedure to the present 
reference data. The remainder of this paper is organized as 
following. Section II describes the experimental method 
including participants, movie and audio-video system as 
stimulus, experimental procedure, questionnaire, EEG 
recording, statistical analysis, and evaluating the data quality. 
Section III describes the results including self-report measure, 
the EEG response, evaluating the uncertainty, and 
accrediting the level of data quality. Conclusion and future 
work are discussed in Section IV.

METHOD 
A. Participants 
The participants recruited were 12 right-handed students 
from the University of Tsukuba (UT) in Japan. Potential 
participants were excluded if they reported any history of 
neurological problems, took within 6 hours caffeine or any 
drug related to arousal, and had already seen the movie Iron

Man. Due to the approximate time of two hours required for 
the long experiment, measurement device errors (n=1), 
drowsiness (n=1) and severe eye blink noise (n=2) caused 
the data for some of the participants and related measures to 
be unavailable for use here. Therefore, only eight 
participants (7 females; mean age: 22.3 years, range 20-28 
years) were analyzed to evaluate AE. 
B. Stimulus 
To avoid previous movie experience by the Japanese 
participants as much as possible, we played the American 
movie Iron Man (manufacturer: Marvel, year produced: 
2008, running time: 2 hours 50 seconds), which was 
considered to be a typical American ‘superhero’ movie. It 
was played using a PC-based beam projector system (Epson 
EB series) with a 5.1 surround-sound system (Cambridge 
DTT-3500). The main story and the time information for 
Film segment 1 and 9 are shown in Table I, and the typical 
scenes are in Fig. 1 (refer to “D. Self-report measures”).

C. Experimental Procedure 
Upon arrival, the participants were fully informed of the 
purpose of the experiment and its procedure, and all signed a 
consent form that was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) of UT. They were then led to a small sound-
attenuated room equipped with a 150-inch  wide screen. The 
procedure of the experiment consisted of three sessions. The 
first session (baseline session) was done to measure the 
physiological signals of the participants during a five-minute 
baseline state. The second session (movie session) sought to 
measure physiological signals from participants while they 
watched the movie, and this session took approximately two 
hours. The third session (questionnaire session), which took 
place after the movie, evaluated how the participants felt 
while watching the movie.  
D.  Self-report measures 
With the help of movie narrative and storytelling experts, 
11 film-content segments were selected as relatively 
meaningful parts of the story from the full movie. After 
watching Iron Man, the participants took part in a 
questionnaire session. For each of the 11 film-content 
segments, the participants were asked to rate the affection 
and AE that they felt while watching the movie on a Likert 
scale ranging from 1 to 9. The subjective questionnaire for 
affection was prepared by adapting a questionnaire from the 
model devised by Russel [14]. Finally, we selected two film-
content segments, one with the highest score and one with 
the lowest score, on subjective AE. 
E. EEG recording and data analysis 
Two-channel EEG signals (Fp1 and Fp2 according to the 
10-20 system) for each of the three participants were 
recorded during the movie session using an MP150 system 
and AcqKnowledge software version 4.2 (Biopac, USA). To 
synchronize the physiological signals with the corresponding 
scene, we measured the changes in the luminance in the 
scenes with a photometer. By measuring the rapid changes in 
the levels of luminance, 35 s from the beginning of Iron Man 
was determined as the reference time at which to 
synchronize with the starting point of the EEG. We collected 
the EEG activity with a personal computer at a sampling rate 
of 1,000 Hz. The EEG traces were analyzed in one-second 
intervals with a step of 0.5 s (50% overlapped). The fast 
Fourier transform was then computed on 50%-overlapped 
groups of 1,000-sample  Hanning windows for all artifact-
reduced data segments to obtain the Power Spectral Density 
(PSD) for each segment in the approximately two-hour film. 
Next, the EEG power in the low-beta-frequency band (13-20 
Hz) was calculated from the PSD for each one-second 
segment. EEG signals were analyzed for two film-content 
segments, i.e., those with the highest and lowest AE scores 
as determined from self-reports. To examine the changes in 
the EEG signals while the participants watched these two 
film-content segments, we selected two intervals in each 
film-content segment. The duration of each interval was set 
to 60 s. The mean values of each EEG signals were 
calculated over two 30-second overlapped 60-second-long 
intervals for the two film-content segments separately. To 
analyze the EEG signals, MATLAB S/W version 7 was used. 
F. Statistical Analysis 
For 
the 
two 
film-content 
segments 
selected 
corresponding to the highest and the lowest subjective AE 
scores, a paired-samples t-test was carried out for the self-
report ratings (AE and affection). The EEG data were 
subjected to a two-way analysis of variance, with Film 
Content (the content segments with the lowest AE and the 
highest AE) and Interval (Interval 1: 0–60 s and Interval 2: 
30–90 s from the beginning of each film-content segment) as 
repeated-measures factors. The eta-squared statistic (η2), 
indicating the proportion between the variance explained by 
one experimental factor and the total variance, is reported. 
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS ver. 21. 
G. Evaluating Data Quality 
To ensure the reliability of the physiological data, which 
will be serviced for neuromarketing in movie industry, we 
established a procedure evaluating the credibility of the data 
(Table II).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Self-report 
As Fig. 2 illustrates, the participants reported the highest 
AE for Film Content 9 (7.75±0.97) and the lowest AE for 
Film Content 1 (5.21±1.16). The self-report ratings for AE 
(t=-7.61, p<0.001), valence (t=-4.88, p<0.001), and arousal 
(t=-4.50, p<0.01) were significantly higher in Film Content 9 
compared to those in Film Content 1.

segments in the movie Iron Man. 
B. EEG Responses 
To investigate the changes of the EEG signals while the 
participants watched Film Contents 1 and 9, we defined 
Interval 1 as being from 50 to 110 s for Film Content 1 and 
from 3,598 to 3,658 s for Film Content 9 and Interval 2 as 
being from 80 to 140 s for Film Content 1 and from 3,628 to 
3,688 s for Film Content 9. We defined an attention index 
(EEG-attention) as the sum of the EEG powers in the low-
beta-frequency band at Fp1 and at Fp2 because the low-beta-
frequency band is known to be activated during attention. 
For EEG-attention, the main effect of the Interval was 
significant (F (1, 11)=5.23, p<.05, η2=0.37), indicating that 
EEG-attention is higher in the second interval as compared 
to the first in the reaction to both Film Content 1 and Film 
Content 9. However, neither the main effect of the Film 
Content nor the Film Content by Interval interaction was 
significant. EEG-attention increased from 32.67±23.45 to 
36.96±23.75 [ms2] (t=-2.06, p=0.069), which was nearly 
significantly in the reaction to Film Content 9, and from 
31.36±20.58 to 31.54±19.53 [ms2] (t=-1.44, p>0.05) in the 
reaction to Film Content 1 (Fig. 3).

C. EvaluatingUncertainty 
The Type A uncertainty of EEG power ()  for 
Interval 1 of Content segment 1 was calculated from (1). In 
the same way, the Type A uncertainty of EEG power () 
was calculated for each interval of Content segment 1 and 9, 
respectively, and summarized in Table III. The Type B 
uncertainty of EEG potential ()  is the sum of the 
uncertainty when amplifying the EEG potential using a 
voltage amplifier (2):  (), when digitalizing from the 
analog output of the EEG amplifier with a voltage range of 1 
mV and with the quantization resolution B being 16 (3): 
(), and when the fast Fourier transformation with a 
sampling frequency   of 1,000 (4): ()  [15]. The 
 () was calculated from the expanded uncertainty of 
voltage amplifier  (), 0.042 V, which was calibrated 
by Korean national standard. The Type B uncertainty of 
EEG potential () was calculated from (5). The Type B 
uncertainty of EEG power () for Interval 1 of Content 
segment 1 was calculated from (6). The combined standard 
uncertainty of EEG power () for Interval 1 of Content 
segment 1 was calculated from (7). In the same way, the 
Type B uncertainty of EEG power () and the combined 
standard uncertainty of EEG power () were calculated 
for each interval of Content segment 1 and 9, respectively, 
and summarized in Table IV. The expanded uncertainty 
() of EEG power with coverage factor k being 2 for 
Interval 1 of Content segment 1 was calculated from (8). In 
the same way, the expanded uncertainty () of EEG power 
was calculated for each interval of Content segment 1 and 9, 
respectively, and summarized in Table IV. Finally, the EEG 
power values with expanded uncertainty are summarized in 
Table V.

In this study, we suggested an evaluation method with 
procedure to assure the reliability of the neuromarketing 
service data. As validated in credibility according to the 
procedure evaluating data quality, the present data as 
reference standard can be serviced to neuromarketing in 
movie industry. The data include as follows:  information of 
stimulus and participants, raw signals of EEG, and EEG 
power in low-beta-frequency band for AE with traceable 
uncertainty.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The present study sought to suggest an evaluation 
method, which will be used to assure the reliability of a 
physiological data for neuromarketing service. In conclusion, 
the method evaluating the reliability of EEG data from 
participants while watching American movie Iron Man 
results in successful application. The EEG power values with 
the uncertainty, which is traceable to a Korean national 
standard can be used as validated SRD for a neuromarketing 
service. This  data can be serviced as reference standard to 
compute AE of moviegoers while watching the American 
movie Iron Man. 
In the future, to enhance the reliability level of present 
data for neuromarketing service, it will be necessary to 
construct a model, which predicts the AE of participants 
while watching movies.
