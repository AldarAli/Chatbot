Abstract— Establishing trust between a patient and a doctor 
depends as much on their relationship as on the doctor’s 
medical abilities. One of the important factors in building and 
maintaining a relationship is whether the doctor produces 
facial expressions appropriate for the patient’s condition. We 
developed a facial-expression training application for medical 
students and tested its effectiveness as a training tool. In this 
application, the Microsoft Cognitive Services Emotion API is 
used to analyze the patient’s facial expression. Prior to 
developing this application, we studied what kind of facial 
expressions were appropriate for a doctor greeting or treating 
an adult patient. We focused on four situations. Three of them 
are greeting situations when a doctor begins a patient 
interview in the general ward of a hospital. The fourth is when 
a doctor examines a patient by placing a stethoscope to a 
patient's 
chest, 
i.e., 
auscultation. 
We 
also 
identified 
appropriate facial expressions for doctors treating pediatric 
patients. To verify the training application’s effectiveness, the 
facial expressions before and after learning with the 
application were evaluated by potential patients or mothers of 
potential pediatric patients. The results demonstrated the 
application’s utility.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
We study facial expressions appropriate for young medical 
doctors and develop facial-expression training applications 
for medical students, one of which was presented at 
eTELEMED 2019 [1]. We have also identified appropriate 
facial expressions for when a doctor greets a patient at the 
beginning of a medical interview in the general ward of a 
hospital [2].  
Patient satisfaction is an important component of medical 
care [3]. Improving patient satisfaction enhances trust and 
the relationship between patient and doctor, which leads to 
stronger adherence to prescribed protocol, such as taking 
medicine, and to enhanced therapeutic effects [4][5]. Many 
studies and reviews have shown that the main determinant of 
patient satisfaction is the patient-doctor relationship [6]–[10] 
and that patient satisfaction is higher when the patient 
communicates with a doctor who has strong nonverbal-
communication 
skills 
[11][12]. 
However, 
young 
inexperienced doctors and medical students often have 
trouble producing appropriate facial expressions when 
greeting a patient. The first author of this paper, a lecturer on 
medical communication, often 
hears 
young 
doctors 
complaining that, though they intend to smile, patients say 
that they seem angry. 
In response to these complaints, we developed a facial-
expression training application that physicians can use for 
independent study. In this application, the Microsoft 
Cognitive Services Emotion API is used to analyze the 
doctor’s facial expression. This application uses the results 
of our study on acceptable expressions for doctors as model 
doctor expressions [2]. These model expressions are 
standards to compare with those of learners using the 
application. To verify the effectiveness of the application, 
learners’ facial expressions before and after learning with the 
application were evaluated by potential patients. The 
evaluation results confirmed the utility of the application. 
After introducing related work in Section II, acceptable 
expressions required for doctors are explained in Section III. 
The system of the facial-expression training application is 
introduced in Section IV. We discuss the results of our 
experiments in Section V. Section VI gives our conclusion, 
and Section VII considers future work. 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
This study focuses on facial expressions, we review 
research on nonverbal communication and research related 
to learning facial expressions. 
A. Nonverbal Communication 
Medical interviews have traditionally focused on 
gathering relevant information from patients [13]. In 
contemporary medicine, the focus has expanded to building a 
trusting relationship, sharing decision-making, responding to 
the patient’s emotional state, and supporting actions related 
to the patient’s condition and treatment; this requires the 
doctor to have a wide range of communication skills [14]. 
These skills include “looking at a patient not as a case but as 
a human being” [15] and “building and maintaining a good 
relationship between doctor and patient” [16]. It has been 
shown that such skills have a greater effect on patient 
satisfaction than the doctor’s medical skills, the medicine 
prescribed, the information provided, the questions asked, 
and the advice and instructions given. In particular, a 
patient's satisfaction is positively related to the doctor being 
warm [15]–[17], empathic [15][17]–[19], friendly [17], and 
giving the impression of being human [18].

Nonverbal communication is a means of communicating 
these emotional aspects of oneself. Patient satisfaction is 
higher when the doctor has a strong ability to express his or 
her emotions and to read the emotions of others through 
nonverbal cues such as facial expressions, gaze, posture, and 
tone of voice [10][20]. In short, a doctor's nonverbal 
communication is an important aspect of patient care. 
B. Learning Facial Expressions 
Natural, unconscious facial expressions can be seen in 
humans from infancy [21], but eventually conscious 
expressions appear. Conscious expressions might also be 
thought of as “false” expressions. These expressions are 
skills that form the basis of more complicated expressive 
behaviors, such as emotional expressions performed in 
accordance with rules in communication situations [22]. 
Facial expressions as expressions of emotion are thought 
to be founded in an understanding of emotions, and there are 
many developmental studies about understanding emotions. 
However, studies about learning facial expressions are 
mostly focused on social-skills training for children with 
developmental disabilities, and there are not many studies for 
adults. 
In one study, participants were required to express other 
people’s facial expressions by recalling emotions and 
showing photos of faces with emotions, the showing photos 
effect was shown about “anger” [23]. 
In research to develop a smile-training system with the 
goal of training participants to produce celebrity-like smiles 
(a facial expression recognized as attractive) [24], 
researchers created a smile-fitted deformation considering 
the characteristics of a celebrity-like smile in participants’ 
expressionless faces. As a result of training, participants 
were able to express a smile highly likely to be recognized as 
attractive by others. 
 From the above, it is clear that presenting appropriate 
facial-expression images is effective for facial-expression 
training as both a method of expressing emotions and a 
learning method. 
III. 
ACCEPTABLE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS 
The most acceptable facial expressions for doctors when 
they greet adult patients at the beginning of a medical 
interview and when auscultating adult patients in the general 
ward of a hospital were identified. Because the requirements 
when treating children are quite different from those when 
treating adults, the most appropriate facial expressions for 
three types of pediatric patients were also identified.     
A.  Acceptable Facial Expression for Adult Patients 
A previous study [2] has revealed what are considered 
acceptable facial expressions for a doctor in accordance with 
the patient's condition. One way to analyze appropriate facial 
expressions for doctors is to define the facial expressions of 
experienced doctors. However, their facial expressions are 
not always deemed appropriate. Also, because many young 
physicians have trouble presenting appropriate facial 
expressions when greeting a patient, we chose to find facial 
expressions that would be acceptable for most patients, 
including potential patients, from facial expressions that 
medical students think are suitable. We chose greeting 
patients in the general ward of a hospital as the target 
situation.  
The procedure was as follows. The participant role-
playing the patient portrayed three conditions, as shown in 
Figure 1: a patient who feels physically healthy (a “bright 
patient”), one whose physical condition is unknown (an 
“expressionless patient”), and one who feels badly and is 
suffering pain (a “patient in pain”). We photographed these 
role-played conditions. Then, a plurality of medical students 
greeted the three photographs with the facial expressions that 
each student deemed appropriate, and we recorded video of 
them doing so. Although evaluation by actual patients is best, 
it would have been difficult to request their participation. We 
asked generally healthy adults who been hospitalized in the 
past or would be in the future to evaluate the videos. To 
make the subjective evaluation more effective, we first had 
16 people view and evaluate each video recording and 
removed the ones, in which the student’s facial expression 
was judged to be unacceptable. We then had 31 other people 
view and evaluate the remaining recordings (Tables I and II). 
Comparing an evaluation by adults and analytical results 
from a computer of the medical student's greeting movies 
revealed what were considered the acceptable facial 
expressions in accordance with the patient's condition.

Figure 1.  Conditions portrayed by role-playing adult patient. 
 
The acceptable facial expressions when a young doctor 
greets an adult patient who is hospitalized in a general ward 
are as follows; 
- For patients who feel physically healthy, the most 
acceptable facial expression is Figure 2: “continuous 
happiness” (expressed more as a laugh rather than simply a 
smile).  
- For patients without a facial expression, the most 
acceptable facial expression is Figure 3: initially “happiness” 
(expressed 
as 
a 
smile) 
and 
then 
“neutrality” 
(expressionlessness).  
- For patients in bad physical condition suffering pain, the 
most acceptable facial expression is Figure 4: “neutrality” 
with a little “sadness” or “surprise.”  
The cells in Figures 2–4 corresponding to 0 or more and 
less than 0.2 are shown in blue, 0.2 or more and less than 0.4 
in green, 0.4 or more and less than 0.6 in yellow, 0.6 or more 
and less than 0.8 in orange, and 0.8 or more in red. The total 
for all emotions is 1, and the value for neutrality is obtained 
by subtracting the total value for the seven emotions from 1.

Figure 4.  Acceptable facial expression for adult patients in bad physical 
condition suffering pain. 
 
To identify facial expressions appropriate for a doctor 
performing auscultation, videos were created and evaluated 
using the following procedure; 
Step 1:  Take photograph of patient being auscultated 
(Figure 5). 
Step 2:  Record videos of two medical doctors producing 
facial expressions they thought appropriate for the 
patient (Figure 6). 
Step 3: Analyze videos using computer-aided facial-
expression-emotion analysis system. 
Step 4: Have ten potential patients evaluate doctors’ facial 
expressions on 3-point scale (1: appropriate, 2: 
neutral, 3: inappropriate).  
 
As shown in Tables III and IV, the results of the facial-
expression-emotion analysis are mostly “ neutral.” As 
shown in Table V, the potential patients feel that the facial 
expressions in Figure 6 are appropriate. The potential

patients feel that the facial expressions in the two videos are 
mainly "neutral," meaning that they feel that the doctor is 
performing the auscultation in a serious manner.

B. Acceptable Facial Expression for Pediatric Patients 
The expressions appropriate for pediatric patients likely 
differ from ones appropriate for adult patients. We were 
able to get cooperation from seven doctors in this part of 
our study (Table VI). We used our computer-aided facial-
expression-emotion analysis system to analyze the facial 
expressions they produced when shown photographs of 
pediatric patients in three different conditions. 
To identify facial expressions appropriate for greeting 
hospitalized pediatric patients in the same three conditions 
described above ("bright patient," "expressionless patient," 
and "patient in pain"), we used the following procedure; 
Step 1:  Take photograph of a role-playing pediatric patient 
(8-year-old) as she produced expressions for each 
of the conditions (Figure 7) . 
Step 2:  Record video of the seven doctors as they produced 
facial expressions they thought appropriate for each 
photograph. 
Step 3:  Analyzed the emotion shown by their expressions 
by using computer-aided facial-expression-emotion 
analysis. 
Step 4: Have evaluation from eleven mothers who has 
children. 
 
Although the evaluation by children is best, it would have 
been difficult to request them. We asked mothers who have 
children.  
The results of computer analysis were used to divide the 
facial expressions of seven pediatricians into three groups. 
-  Group 1 (Pediatricians 1, 2, 4): for bright pediatric 
patients 
who 
feel 
physically 
healthy—“continuous 
happiness” (expressed with a bright smile). For pediatric 
patients 
without 
a 
facial 
expression—“neutral” 
(expressionlessness). For pediatric patients in bad physical 
condition suffering pain—“neutral” with a little “surprise” 
(expressed with a pained expression).

Figure 7.  Conditions portrayed by role-playing pediatric patient.  
 
- Group 2 (Pediatricians 3, 5): for bright pediatric patients—
“neutral and happiness” (expressed with a natural smile). 
For pediatric patients without a facial expression—“neutral” 
(expressionlessness).  For pediatric patients in bad physical 
condition 
suffering 
pain—initially 
“neutral” 
(expressionlessness) and then “happiness” (expressed with a 
smile).  
- Group 3 (Pediatricians 6, 7); for bright pediatric patients—
“happiness” (expressed with a natural smile). For pediatric 
patients without a facial expression—almost “happiness” 
(expressed with a smile). For pediatric patients in bad 
physical condition suffering pain—initially “neutral” 
(expressionlessness) and then “happiness” (expressed with 
an encouraging smile).   
The facial expressions of Pediatrician 4 (Tables VII–IX), 
Pediatrician 5 (Tables X–XII), and Pediatrician 6 (Tables 
XIII–XV) were selected as representative ones for the 
corresponding groups.

The appropriateness of those expressions was evaluated 
by 14 mothers who had children between the ages of 2 and 
12. They did this by watching videos of the expressions and 
scoring them on a scale (1: appropriate, 2: neutral, 3: 
inappropriate). 
As shown in Figure 8, the representative facial 
expressions for the Group 3 pediatricians were evaluated 
overall as the most appropriate for pediatric patients. As 
shown in Table VI, the doctor who made the expressions 
had 29 years of experience. The expressions are shown in 
Figures 9–11. 
For bright pediatric patients, the average score was good 
for all three groups. The most appropriate facial expression 
was the same as that for adult patients, a bright smile 
expressing “happiness.” For pediatric patients without a 
facial expression, a smile held longer than for adults was the 
most appropriate facial expression. For pediatric patients in 
bad physical condition suffering pain, an initially “neutral” 
expression and then an encouraging smile expressing 
“happiness” was the most appropriate facial expression. 
The biggest difference in the appropriate expression 
between adult and pediatric patients was for patients in bad 
physical condition suffering pain. As expressed by two of 
the mothers, if a child is feeling pain and the pediatrician 
has a pained expression, the child will tend to cry. Another 
factor is that children are more likely to be scared by 
something than adults. It is also possible that an expression 
of encouragement from the pediatrician reassures the child.  
We asked an experienced pediatrician (Pediatrician 7) 
to describe the biggest difference between responding to 
adults and responding to children. He replied that adults are 
more often told the truth when the news is bad while it is 
important to give children hope of being cured. Thus the

FACIAL-EXPRESSION TRAINING APPLICATION SYSTEM 
The system of the facial-expression training application 
is introduced in this section. 
A. Requirements and Design Concept 
Learners study in the following order so that the 
appropriate facial expressions can be learned efficiently and 
repeatedly. When starting, to enable learners to notice what 
their facial expressions are before training, the system has 
them greet with expressions that they think are suitable 
without any specific instructions. 
Step 1:  A learner chooses one of the model patients.

Step 2:  The learner greets the model patient with a facial 
expression that the learner thinks appropriate, 
 and this greeting is recorded. 
Step 3: A video of the model doctor greeting the patient 
with the appropriate facial expression and analysis 
data are displayed, and important points to notice 
about the appropriate facial expressions are 
introduced. 
Step 4: The video recorded in Step 2 and its analysis data 
are displayed. 
Step 5: The learner repeats from Steps 2 to 4 until satisfied. 
Step 6: If the learner is satisfied, the learner selects a 
patient with a different condition and returns to 
Step 1. 
 
In the developed system, in addition to being able to 
check the facial expressions the learner performed by 
recording them as a video, the learner can also check the 
quality of his or her expression on a frame-by-frame basis. 
Each learner can save images as learning data and facial-
expression analysis results by applying security processing 
because these data and analysis results are important as 
research data. 
B. System Configuration 
We developed and used a system that quantitatively 
analyzes changes in facial expression. It is based on the 
Cognitive Services Emotion API [25] provided by 
Microsoft's Azure cloud service, and a facial-expression-
emotion detection system for video images. Microsoft 
Emotion API corresponds to multiple races. Our facial-
expression-emotion analysis system calculates the ratio for 
seven emotions (happiness, anger, contempt, disgust, fear, 
sadness, and surprise) reflected in the input video image and 
for neutrality. The total for all emotions is 1, and the value 
for neutrality is obtained by subtracting the total value for the 
seven emotions from 1. The configuration of this application 
is as shown in Figure 12. A video camera is controlled by the 
Open CV [26]. Recoded video data are converted the 
Motion-JPEG, and send to the Cognitive Services Emotion 
API. 
 First, the learner selects a patient to be a training partner 
in Figure 13. After clicking the recording button, the learner 
talks to the model patient. When the greeting and 
consultation is over, the learner clicks the stop button 
followed by the next button in Figure 14.  
The emotional values of the model doctor’s facial 
expression are displayed. By selecting a timeline, the 
corresponding facial expression is displayed in Figure 15. 
The emotional values of the learner’s facial expression 
are displayed. By selecting a timeline, the corresponding 
facial expression is displayed in Figure 16.

C. Model Doctors 
Videos of model doctors were prepared with the 
following procedure. In a previous study [2], the acceptable 
doctors’ expressions for the patients were measured and 
selected. The model doctors (one male and one female) 
reproduced the acceptable facial expressions, and their 
reproductions were recorded as videos. Seventy-nine people 
evaluated these videos of Figures 17–21 and confirmed that 
they were appropriate, so we adopted them as the model 
doctor videos.

EVALUATION 
In order to examine the effect of our facial-expression 
training 
application, 
the 
facial 
expressions 
of 
six 
participants before and after practice were evaluated. 
A. Experiment 
Six participants including three medical students played 
doctors and greeted patients with facial expressions that 
they thought appropriate for each condition of Figure 13. 
The application recorded them (before training), the 
participants repeated the facial-expressions training so that 
they could approximate the analysis results of the model 
doctors. After practice, we recorded their facial expressions 
again (after training). Although evaluation by actual patients 
is best, it would have been difficult to request actual 
patients’ participation. Hence, we asked 30 general healthy 
adults who had been hospitalized in the past or would be in 
the future. We showed the video recordings (before and 
after training) to 10 men and 20 women (average age 41.0 
years) without sound. We asked them to judge whether the 
doctor’s facial expression was appropriate for the condition 
on a 3-point scale (1: appropriate, 2: neutral, 3: not 
appropriate). We asked them to also comment on anything 
they felt or noticed. We showed the recordings without 
sound because we wanted them to focus on the appropriate 
facial expressions in medical communication conditions, 
and emotion is easier to read from speech than from facial 
expressions. 
B. Effects of Training 
The graph of Figures 22–25 showing the result of the 
rating before and after the training is as follows. 
In order to examine the effects of training with the 
application, we conducted 2 (using the application: before 
and after) × 6 (doctors) two-way analysis of variance with 
the evaluation results as the dependent under four conditions. 
The results showed a significant difference at the 1% level 
under all conditions (in order from condition 1, F (59, 295) 
= 3.19, P<.01; F (59, 295) = 4.51, P<.01; F (59, 295) = 4.52, 
P<.01; F (59, 177) = 5.26, P<.01). 
We consider the effectiveness of this application to have 
been confirmed because the evaluation scores improved 
with use of the application under all conditions. We also 
noticed the following two points during the experiment. The 
first point is that the evaluation for “patients in pain” was 
different for each person. Most persons regarded the 
doctor's serious expression as empathy and evaluated that as 
adequate. However, a few persons felt that the doctor's 
expression caused unease and worry, and that person 
evaluated the expression as not adequate. Therefore, the 
model expressions for patients in pain may not be limited to 
one type. The second point is that the facial expressions 
practiced in the application are unnatural for a few persons. 
By training in the application, people playing the role of 
doctor created expressions close to those of the model 
doctor's videos, and accordingly the evaluation score rose. 
However, when a facial expression that the participants 
learned was far from facial expressions that they always do, 
a few evaluators felt that the expression looked like “a 
pretended expression” or “artificial expression.”

VI. 
CONCLUSION 
Our quantitative analysis of medical student facial 
expressions when greeting adult patients and pediatric 
patients at the beginning of a medical interview in the 
general ward of a hospital revealed acceptable facial 
expressions. For adult patients who feel physically healthy, 
the most acceptable facial expression is "continuous 
happiness" (expressed more as a laugh than simply as a 
smile). For pediatric patients who feel physically healthy, the 
most acceptable facial expression is “happiness” (a natural 
smile). For adult patients without a facial expression, the 
most acceptable facial expression is initially "happiness" 
(expressed as a smile) and then "neutral" (without 
expression). On the other hand, for pediatric patients without 
a facial expression, the most acceptable facial expression is 
almost “happiness” (expressed as a longer smile). For adult 
patients suffering pain, the most acceptable facial expression 
is "neutral" with a little "sadness" or "surprise." On the other 
hand, for pediatric patients suffering pain, the most 
acceptable 
facial 
expression 
is 
initially 
“neutral” 
(expressionlessness) and then “happiness” (expressed as an 
encouraging smile).  
During 
auscultation, 
the 
most 
acceptable 
facial 
expression is always "neutral." 
 We developed a facial-expression training application 
that physicians can use for independent study. Six 
participants practiced using this application to express 
appropriate facial expressions. To verify the effectiveness of 
this application, the facial expressions that participants made 
before and after training with it were evaluated by 30 people. 
On the basis of the results, we consider the usefulness of the 
facial-expression training application to be verified. We 
think most learners could express their facial expression 
naturally by practicing repeatedly. 
In the future, we will improve the application so that the 
on-screen instructions will guide the learner's expressions 
more properly. 
Given the importance of smiles when people interact with 
each other in many countries or cultures, smiles on “bright 
patients” in this study are expected to be widely effective.
