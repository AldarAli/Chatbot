Abstract— This study aims to develop an ethical 
framework for the outcomes of Web-based Collective 
Intelligence 
(CI) 
in 
business 
organizations. 
The 
framework acts as a governance structure to organize 
and support the efforts of strategic planners, decision 
makers, systems analysts and developers in developing 
ethical collaborative Web-based systems and applications 
for harvesting an ethical CI in order to achieve the 
strategic business objectives. It considered five expected 
ethical outcomes that have to be evaluated and 
monitored. These outcomes include justice, satisfaction, 
trust, commitment, and pleasure. The framework 
suggests that these outcomes act as strategic leverage 
points to protect organization survival, serving the social 
acceptance of its existence, improving its public image, 
and achieving competitive advantage. 
Keywords-web-based collective intelligence; ethical theories; 
moral intelligence theories. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Business organizations have to constantly innovate in 
new areas, make complex decisions, originate creative 
solutions, adapt and behave as human beings to serve its 
survival, prosperity, and superiority. In this context, business 
organizations have to be recognized as complex adaptive 
systems [1][2]. They must learn, self-organize, adapt, 
compete, and evolve, getting rid of its mechanical and 
procedural life to behave and think as human beings. From 
this perspective, organizations must grow far more 
intelligence to deal with the diverse and simultaneous 
challenges. An organization is intelligent only if it is able to 
nurture a high level of CI [2].  
The new Information and Communication Technologies 
(ICTs) are organizing groups and collaboration efforts in 
new ways that have never been possible before in the history 
of humanity [3]. Lykourentzou et al. [4] described Collective 
Intelligence (CI) as an emerging field that seeks to merge 
human and machine intelligence, with an aim to achieve 
results unattainable by either one of these entities alone.  
Studying the synergy between IT and CI is still in its 
early stages and many important issues are still unexplored.  
Kapetanios [5] clarified that the transition from personalized 
data, knowledge, and contents towards CI forms are at its 
infancy and raises many questions. CI deserves to become a 
full discipline, with its formal framework, tools, measuring 
instruments, practical applications, and ethical field [4][5] by 
virtue of the advances in collaborative Internet applications. 
While IT revolution and its role in harvesting the CI is 
growing continuously, a little attention has been paid to 
study the ethical dimension of Web-based CI. Given that, 
this study contributes to the ongoing stream of research 
through developing an ethical framework for measuring the 
outcomes of Web-based CI in business organizations.  
The present study provides a starting point to meet the 
need for developing a business ethical framework that 
addresses the synergy between the collective humans’ 
intelligence and collaborative ICTs. It also provides strategic 
planners, decision makers, systems analysts and developers 
with a comprehensive ethical view, guiding their efforts to 
develop collaborative Web applications for harvesting CI in 
orders to achieve the strategic business objectives. 
The reminder of this paper is organized as follows: The 
second section will provide an overview of Web-based CI. 
The literature review section provides an overview of 
traditional ethical theories, moral intelligence, and ethical 
frameworks 
of 
IT-based 
collaborative 
business 
environments . The fourth section discusses the outcomes of 
ethical Web-based CI. The fifth section includes the succes 
story of MarkaVIP, a leading online store in the Arab 
World, and the paper is finalized with a conclusion section. 
II. 
AN OVERVIEW OF WEB-BASED CI  
There are many definitions of CI that has been built 
around the idea of intelligence and collaboration. For 
example, Lévy [7] defined CI as the capacity of human 
communities to co-operate intellectually in creation, 
innovation and invention. Lykourentzou et al. [4] asserted 
that CI is based on the concept that large groups of 
cooperating 
individuals 
can 
produce 
higher-order 
intelligence, solutions and innovation, and come to function 
as a single entity. Lévy [7] revealed that one axiom of CI is 
the coordination in real time through cyberspace.  
Collaborative Web-based systems are the most recent 
paths discovered for opening up the possibilities of 
harvesting and improving the CI. These systems leverage 
combined efforts of very large groups of people to solve 
complex problems, and often referred to as CI systems [3] 
[4]. As a collaborative platform, the Web-based systems 
provide a single point for integrating all the company’s 
information, applications and services that are used by 
employees, business partners, and customers [3]. It enables 
people from remote locations to meet each other and to 
32

share information to achieve common goals. It also 
facilitates knowledge delivery and creation in an open and 
distributed intelligent environment via networks [7]. 
III. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
A. Traditional Ethical Theories 
The review of literature confirms that the basic notion of 
CI stands on two complementary axioms, which together 
constitute the concept of CI bridged by the collaboration 
among a group of individuals. The first axiom is related to 
the limited capabilities of individuals including individual’s 
bounded rationality, cognitive limits, cognitive bias, and no 
one know every things [1]. The second represents the power 
of collective collaboration through the ability of a group to 
find better solutions to the same problems, evolve toward 
higher order complexity thought, and engage in intellectual 
collaboration in order to create, innovate, and invent [1] [7]. 
The two axioms represent convergence points that 
enable to accommodate many of conflicting ethical theories. 
Actually, from an ethical point of view, CI is closed to the 
Utilitarian Moral Principle that considers the benefits of 
society rather than the benefits of an individual [8]. In other 
words, one’s actions are morally justified if the actions are 
in the greatest interest for the largest number of people, 
emphasizing the well-being of society at large [8]. The 
theme of CI also support the ethical Golden Rule that call 
for putting yourself into the place of others, and thinking of 
yourself as the object of the decision, to help thinking about 
fairness in decision making [9]. 
     CI environment permits overcoming the individualism 
dilemma in some ethical theories, such as the Right Theory, 
the Categorical Imperative, and Egoism. This view is 
consistent with the argument of John Rawls, the author of 
theory of justice, that when social cooperation is lacking, the 
concept of justice is meaningless [10]. It is not inconsistent 
with the mind and rationality of individual’s action of 
Immanuel Kant’s Categorical Imperative [9][11] when the 
collective 
collaboration 
environment 
transforms 
the 
mindfulness to orgmindfulness, elevating the CI of the 
organization [2]. This view takes into consideration the 
Kant’s argument that morality is a reflection of rationality 
and is larger than the narrow framework of “the ends justify 
the means” [12], where the collective collaboration can 
transform 
the 
individuals’ 
bounded 
rationality 
into 
collective rationality. In this regard, it is important to 
mention that researchers of CI coined this transformation 
using different descriptions and terms, such as shared 
extended mind, collective mind, and collective cognition.  
B. Moral Intelligence 
Theorists and promoters of the multiple intelligences 
theory (e.g., [13][14][15]) posit that individuals possess a 
number of autonomous intelligences. Gardner [15] explains 
that individuals draw on these intelligences, individually 
and corporately, to create products and solve problems that 
are relevant to their societies. From this perspective, the 
moral intelligence is an important component of human 
society, where intelligence can be put to either moral or 
immoral uses. In the context of CI, moral intelligence 
emphasizes the ethical responsibilities of individual 
participants toward the other members of organization’s 
society and to make sound decisions that benefit not only 
yourself, but others around you [13].  
     Moral intelligence has different dimensions and 
mechanisms. According to Lennick and Keil [14], it 
represents the mental capacity to determine how universal 
human principles among diverse cultures should be applied 
to our personal values, goals, and actions. These principles 
include commitment to something greater than oneself. 
Lennick and Kiel [14] identified four integrity competencies 
of moral intelligence, including acting consistently with 
values and beliefs, telling the truth, standing up for what is 
right, and keeping promises. Sama and Shoaf [15] suggested 
that moral intelligence is epitomized in interactive social 
behaviors through shared values, respect the well-being of 
others, cooperation, reciprocity, and transparency. 
C. Ethical Frameworks of IT-based Collaborative Business 
Environments  
Business ethics can be described as a set of rules, 
standards, codes, principles, and philosophy to be followed 
for ethical decision making in business. Ethical decision-
making in today’s organization is not only the right thing to 
do, but is vital to its survival [17]. It is becoming apparent 
that the ethical dimension of ICT related business decisions 
cannot be safely ignored, especially with the development in 
Internet applications and its widespread use among the 
members of organization’s society [9].  
     There is a growing stream of research examining the 
ethical dimension of Web-based business relationships and 
interactions among the members of organization’s society. 
For example, Roman [18] discussed the ethics of online 
retailing from the consumers’ perspective. Yang et al. [19] 
and Limbu et al. [20] examined the effect of perceived 
ethical performance of shopping Websites on consumer 
trust, satisfaction, and loyalty. Mingers and Walsham [6] 
analyzed the potential of discourse ethics of Web 2.0 
applications. The authors provided seven principles of 
ethical discourse governed by different considerations, such 
as involving all social groups, negotiating fair compromises 
between competing interests, giving equal consideration to 
the interests of all, and involving a great number of 
stakeholders in decisions and system designs. In the context 
of IT-based collaborative business environments, the 
Normative Theories of Business Ethics (NTBEs) were 
adopted to develop different ethical frameworks for decision 
making and collaboration [21][22]. These theories and their 
explanations are given below: 
Stockholder Theory 
According to the Stockholder Theory, the social 
responsibility of business and hence the managers, is the use 
of resources to increase returns on investment for the 
stockholders. One moral argument associated with this 
33

Pleasure 
theory is that if individuals pursue profits, they will also be 
promoting the interests of society. 
Stakeholder Theory 
According to this theory, managers are responsible for 
taking care of the interests of all the stakeholders, such as 
employees, suppliers, customers. It claims that managers 
have a fiduciary duty to give equal consideration   to the 
legitimate interests of all such stakeholders. Under this 
theory, managers must recognize that all stakeholders are 
entitled to participate in decisions.  
Social Contract Theory (SCT) 
SCT proposes that all enterprises are ethically 
responsible and obliged to promote the welfare of society. 
SCT focuses on two aspects. The first is the social welfare 
term that stands on the obligation of the organization to 
improve the well-being of the society. The second is the 
justice term that includes the willingness of society’s 
members to authorize corporate existence only if 
corporations agree to remain within the bounds of the 
general principles of justice. Justice also means that 
organization operates in a way to avoid fraud and deception, 
showing respect for society’s members. 
Based on the previous literature review on ethical 
theories and ethical frameworks of IT-based collaborative 
business environment, the framework of the present study 
consists of three main constructs. As shown in Table 1, 
these constructs include the rights and obligations of all 
members of organization’s society, the expected outcomes 
of ethical Web-based CI, and the strategic business 
objectives that can be achieved by these ethical outcomes.

obligations; the present study classified members of 
organization’s society into four categories. These include 
stockholders, internal stakeholders, external stakeholders, 
and society as a whole. Internal stakeholders are those who 
are members of the organization, such as employees, boards 
of directors, and managers. External stakeholders are those 
who are not internal members but have direct interests in the 
organization and its activities, such as suppliers, logistics 
companies, wholesalers, retailers, and regulators. According 
to NTBEs, customers are affiliated to society category. 
Based on the overall review of ethical theories and 
ethical frameworks of IT-based decision making and 
collaboration; the development efforts of Web-based CI 
systems, management and organizational environment will 
work under the following ethical principles: 
• Provide a democratic environment in terms of freedom 
of self-expression, generate and explore ideas, 
discussion, and consensus in which all participants are 
considered and treated equally. 
• Provide mechanisms to support the morality of 
collaboration, including mutual respect, caring for 
collective well-being, standing up for what is right 
avoiding partial judgments, knowledge and ideas 
exchange, and consistent adherence to principles. 
• Support the compliance with laws, regulations, and 
standards imposed, or agreed to, by the government, 
industry associations, stakeholders. 
• Support the investigation of decisions truthfulness that 
complies with facts and reality. 
• Provide mechanisms to support the transparency and 
responsibility for the consequences of decisions. 
• Support the decisions that do the greatest benefit for 
the greatest number of members of organization’s 
society. 
     These principles work as mechanisms to achieve five 
outcomes of the ethical Web-based CI. In general, outcome 
measurements have an important communications role by 
making organization aware of what is important to success 
and the areas of evaluation. Based on the literature review, 
the research framework proposes five expected outcomes 
that have to be considered, evaluated, and monitored. These 
outcomes include trust, commitment, justice, satisfaction, 
and pleasure. It is suggested that these outcomes act as 
important strategic leverage points to protect organization 
survival, serving the social acceptance of its existence, 
improving its public image, and achieving competitive 
advantage [9] [17][22][35][25][31]. 
A. Justice 
In his distributive theory of justice, Rawls (1971) 
described justice as the first virtue of social institutions that 
protect the rights and freedoms of individuals, and support a 
reasonable distribution of benefits among members [8][12]. 
Rawls argued that social cooperation appears to be both a 
necessary and a sufficient condition for social justice that 
has meaning only within the framework of a cooperative 
society. In the context of business ethics, Hoffman and 
Moore [23] demonstrated that business ethics deal with 
comprehensive questions about the justice issues raised by 
the relationship of business to government, consumer, 
employees, and society at large. Murphy et al. [29] 
considered fairness as a principal ethical dimension of 
continuum relationship marketing. Hattwick [24] suggested 
that competitive market situations encourage the reasonably 
high standard of business ethics called the ethic of justice. 
Aryee et al. [30] investigated the relationship between 
organizational justice and work outcomes.  
      Collaborative Web-based applications advocate an equal 
freedom to individuals to express themselves freely, posit 
their views and experiences, and exchange of ideas and 
preferences [1][36][37]. On the other hand, the previous 
studies (e.g., [36][37]) confirmed that the effective 
management of CI is constituted by a democratic 
environment in terms of liberty, freedom, participation, 
plurality, discussion, and consensus in which all participants 
are considered and treated equally. 
B. Satisfaction 
The ethical theories have developed to provide solutions 
satisfying the human needs and desires. For example, Kant 
discussed the complete well-being and satisfaction of all 
one’s needs and inclinations with one’s condition [11]. 
Egoism theory considered the needs satisfaction in terms of 
self-interest that motivates the human actions [26]. 
Utilitarianism also investigated the benefits of society in 
terms of the action consequences that achieve the greatest 
satisfaction [8][12]. From this perspective, decision makers 
should estimate and select the solution that maximizes the 
satisfaction of the greatest number of society’s members. 
Berrone et al. [27] found that companies with strong 
ethical identity can obtain a greater degree of stakeholders’ 
satisfaction, which in turn affects positively the financial 
performance of companies. Koonmee et al. [28] also 
concluded that the ethics institutionalization has a positive 
impact on the job satisfaction as one of employee job-
related outcomes. Amine et al. [25] investigated the effect of 
ethics on job satisfaction as a mediating variable between 
ethics and corporate performance. Many of previous 
researches (e.g., [18][20]) examined the impact of business 
ethics on customer satisfaction. The issues of satisfaction 
also have been examined widely in the previous research 
(e.g., [36], [38]) to measure the success of Web-based 
collaborative systems adoption.  
C. Trust 
Trust is defined as the willingness of a party to be 
vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the 
expectation that the other will perform a particular action 
important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor 
or control that other party [39]. The previous studies (e.g., 
[28]) emphasized that the advancement of organizational 
trust depend, to a large extent, on organizational practices of 
business ethical principles. Murphy et al. [29] deemed trust 
as fundamental ethical virtue in relationship marketing. 
Aryee et al. [30] and Amine et al. [25] investigated the 
organizational trust as a mediating variable between ethics 
and performance.  Koonmee et al. [28] also declared that 
35

BUSTECH 2015 : The Fifth International Conference on Business Intelligence and Technology

 
ethical cultures create trust within and outside corporations 
encouraging appropriate risk taking, which leads to 
innovation, propels progress, and ultimately profitability.  
Different 
studies 
(e.g., 
[18][19]) 
discussed 
the 
relationship between business ethics and customer trust. 
Also a major stream of research (e.g., [31][25]) investigated 
the impact of organizational ethics on employees trust. In 
the age of Internet, trust among members of organization’s 
society has taken a special status. The previous research 
(e.g., [19][20]) on Web-based collaboration considered trust 
as an indicator to the quality of relationships.  
Many researchers (e.g., [2][40]) considered sustaining 
trust as one of the pillars of CI. Ng and Liang [2] revealed 
that collaboration in the intelligent organizations can only 
be achieved through mutual trust. Numerous studies (e.g., 
[37][40]) asserted that the role of collaborative IT and 
digital interaction in harvesting CI is not likely to succeed if 
openness and mutual trust is not promoted first. 
D. Commitment 
Commitment refers to partners’ desire to continue a 
valued relationship and a willingness to make short-term 
sacrifices 
to 
preserve 
the 
longevity 
of 
long-term 
relationships [20]. Murphy et al. [29] believed that 
commitment is a fundamental ethical virtue in business 
relationship. The survey of Aspen Institute [16] concluded 
that the company’s commitment to its social responsibility 
has definite business benefits, including a good reputation, 
loyal customers, and long-term viability in the marketplace. 
The review of literature showed a positive relationship 
between the ethics institutionalization and employees’ 
organizational commitment [28][31].  It also revealed a 
positive impact of business ethics on the customers’ 
commitment and loyalty [18][20]. Commitment is used as a 
central variable to determine the success and quality of 
Web-based collaborative relationship [20]. In the context of 
CI, research (e.g., [2][3][4]) indicated that the purpose of 
collective management is to promote the collective 
commitment in terms of common objectives, building long-
term relationship, a sense of togetherness, and partnership. 
E. Pleasure 
Many ancient philosophers believed that the purpose of 
all human actions was attainment of pleasure. The 
utilitarianism considers that the rightness or wrongness of 
an action is determined by its contribution to hedonistic 
consequential benefit and the overall utility in terms of 
maximizing pleasure [12]. Bose [9] explained that the goal 
of greater happiness in utilitarian principle can be achieved 
by nurturing the decency of individuals, so that all can 
benefit from the honor of others rather than focusing on just 
one individual’s happiness. Much works by economists 
have tied the ethical behavior to the pleasure principle, 
which can be gotten from the consumption of so much 
honesty, friendliness, or other ethical duty [24].  
The technology acceptance models have frequently used 
the hedonic motivations to predict the intention and usage of 
IT. For example, Davis et al. [32] considered perceived 
hedonic value as the extent to which the action of using the 
technology is perceived to be enjoyable in its own right for 
no apparent reinforcement. Venkatesh et al. [33] added 
hedonic motivations to UTAUT2 describing the fun or 
pleasure derived from using a technology.  
A considerable attention has been paid to the important 
role of hedonic and intrinsic motivations in harvesting CI. 
For example, Bothos et al. [37] described the intrinsic 
motivations of participants in terms of feeling of having 
positively impact, finding feedback potentially valuable and 
supportive of creativity, becoming co-creators, participating 
in the risk of failure or the joy of success. 
V. 
MARKAVIP : A SUCCESS STORY 
MarkaVIP [41] is an online shopping store, which was 
founded in 2010, selling gifts and accessories. The company 
chose to work in the Arab world environment, where people 
do not sufﬁciently trust paperless or faceless transactions, 
and buying from unknown sellers. In such a culture there are 
many barriers that can create customer resistance to 
changing from shopping at brick-and-mortar stores to virtual 
stores. The company started with an estimated $10,000 
capital and a few suppliers who had accepted to provide 
MarkaVIP with commodities on credit and getting paid after 
receiving money from customers. Today, MarkaVIP is a 
leading online retailer in the Arab world and a strong 
competitor of the offline deep-rooted traditional stores, 
offering a wide variety of products ranging from goods and 
services for men, women, and children; electronics; and 
home decor. The company follows the following 
philosophy: 
"We are a company that's all about people whether they are 
our employees, our customers or partners. We believe that 
having exceptional talents is fundamental to the success of 
our company." 
The Web-based collaboration of MarkaVIP with its 
online society's members has created "win to win" 
relationships, which represent a main feature of collective 
intelligence. One major strategic pillar of the company's 
success is based on a set of ethical rules, standards, codes, 
principles, and philosophy that enabled it to acquire the 
trust, 
satisfaction, 
commitment, 
and 
many 
other 
achievements of its society's members. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The present study aims to develop an ethical framework 
for the outcomes of Web-based CI. These outcomes are 
expected to contribute critically in achieving the strategic 
business objectives of the organization, such as survival, the 
social accept of its existence, improving its public image, 
and achieving competitive advantage. 
There are some limitations which can serve as directions 
for future research. The research framework needs to be 
tested empirically. Although the ethical outcomes have been 
measured in previous research, the present study does not 
provide a methodology to follow for achieving the ethical 
principles of Web-based CI.
