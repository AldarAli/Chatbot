Abstract— Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) are a new area of 
interests for researchers and a new technology for the next 
generation wireless networks. Multiple access protocol is an 
important issue to define the networks performance. In this 
paper, the throughput of a primary and secondary network is 
analyzed considering the Capture Effect in both systems and 
the Packet Error Rate (PER) due to the interference between 
primary and secondary stations, considering that the slotted 
Aloha protocol is proposed for the licensed network and 
Slotted Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) protocol is used 
in the secondary network.

 INTRODUCTION 
The radio frequency spectrum is a natural resource [2] 
and it is partitioned into several bands that are generally 
attributed to licensed holders through long-term agreements 
[3][4]. Inside frequency spectrum there are some unlicensed 
portions reserved for industrial, scientific or medical (ISM) 
purposes 
and 
they 
are 
commonly 
used 
for 
data 
communication in smaller networks [3]. 
The studies and measurements performed by the 
Spectrum Policy Task Force (SPTF), linked to the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC), concluded that certain 
spectrum bands are heavily used by licensed or unlicensed 
users (ISM users), while other spectrum fractions are used 
occasionally or rarely, depending on geographic location and 
time [2][5]. Also according to [6], in the future there could 
be scarcity of this precious resource due to increasing 
demand powered by a variety of factors, like the rapid 
economic growth of the telecommunications sector and the 
convenience offered by them, the emerging services and 
applications, the increasing of the human mobility and the 
appearance of new technologies [6]. 
Changes in the policy for the frequency spectrum that 
become more flexible the access to this resource, by using 
dynamic spectrum access (DSA), and the improvement in the 
spectrum management procedures would improve the 
efficiency in the using of this natural resource and would 
avoid its possible scarcity [2] [3] [4] [6]. According to [5], 
the DSA becomes viable by the emerging technology of the 
cognitive radio (CR). It is a new concept in the development 
of wireless communication systems enabling more efficient 
use of radio spectrum and, therefore, it is a strong candidate 
as a technological solution for the future wireless networks, 
so-called NeXt Generation (xG) networks or cognitive radio 
networks. 
In [5], CR is defined as a radio that can change its 
transmission parameters based on the interaction with the 
operating environment and its main goals are to provide 
reliable and seamless communication and to enable the 
efficient spectrum utilization. The cognitive radios must also 
be able to reconfigure their communication parameters 
rapidly and in the real time [2]. 
The cognitive radio networks can be defined as 
“networks that can dynamically alter their functionality 
and/or topology in accordance with the changing needs of its 
users, taking into account current environmental conditions. 
This dynamic modification is done in accordance with 
applicable business rules and regulatory policies” [7].  
The CRN architecture is formed by two groups: the 
primary network and the secondary network. These groups 
can coexist in the same geographic region and they can 
operate in the same spectrum band. According to [4], the 
primary network is an existing network where primary users 
(PU) have license to operate in a specific frequency band. 
Licensed users have higher priority in channel access. The 
secondary networks, or cognitive networks are those that do 
not have license to operate in the desired band [4] and the so-
called secondary users (SU) operate in such network. 
According to [8], the secondary users have lower 
transmission priority and they exploit the frequency 
spectrum in an opportunistic fashion, through the spectrum 
holes and without causing harmful interference to licensed 
users transmissions. 
According to [1], in the primary network, the protocols 
for medium access control (MAC) are important to organize 
access of the different primary users to the channels. In the 
secondary network, the MAC protocols are responsible for 
organizing access of the secondary users to the free primary 
network channels, avoiding or making the interference 
acceptable in the primary network. 
The network throughput is affected by the capture effect. 
In [1], the performance of cognitive radio networks (CRN) is 
analyzed for several MAC protocols, including an analysis 
that considers using Slotted Aloha in the primary network 
and the slotted carrier sense multiple access protocol 
(CSMA) in the secondary network. In these analyzes the 
Capture Effect is also taken into account in primary and 
secondary networks: if the difference between the power 
level of a concerned packet signal in relation to others 
interfering packets is higher than a threshold called capture 
ratio (R), then the concerned packet can be detected by the 
receiver, whereas all others fail in medium access [9]. 
However, the analysis introduced in [1] does not consider 
the possible errors due to interference during the packet 
detection. In this paper, we extend the analysis of [1], taking

into account the packet error rate due to multiple access 
scheme and their effects on the networks throughput. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Section II, we present the original model used in [1] for 
performance analysis; a new system model is introduced in 
Section III and the networks throughput is evaluated 
considering the PER; Section IV introduces and compares 
the analytical results for both models; and our conclusions 
are shown in Section V. 
II. 
THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM MODEL AND ITS 
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
The Fig. 1 shows the network architecture analyzed in 
[1]. The primary network uses Slotted Aloha as multiple 
access protocol to access the medium and in the unlicensed 
network is considered Slotted-CSMA protocol. The primary 
access point (PAP) and the secondary access point (SAP) 
provide services for primary and secondary networks 
respectively. All primary users can be viewed by SAP and 
vice versa. In the primary network there are Np primary users 
(PU) and among these, Ip stations are attempting to transmit 
their data packets during a time slot. On other hand, the 
secondary network has Ns secondary users (SU). During a 
time slot, there are Js unlicensed users attempting to send 
their packets [1]. 
The primary users have priority to transmit their data 
packets and, therefore, the SUs sense the channel to avoid 
interference with PUs and to identify clearly the spectrum 
holes that occur when a time slot of slotted aloha is idle. 
The Fig. 2 shows the structure of time slot for slotted 
aloha and slotted CSMA. In the primary network, each time 
slot can be busy or idle, depending on transmission states of 
PUs during a time slot. If there is no primary user attempting 
to transmit packets at the beginning of a time slot, then it is 
considered idle. This spectrum opportunity can be exploited 
by the secondary users [1].

A. Primary Network Analysis 
According to the traffic model introduced in [1], any PU 
that is not in a retransmission state can generate a new packet 
with probability σp. Therefore, the probability that a PU does 
not generate any packet is (1-σp). If a new packet is 
generated in the network, it is transmitted immediately in the 
next time slot. If the packet is not successfully transmitted 
during a time slot, it is retransmitted with probability σp in 
the following time slots until that packet is successfully 
transmitted. Users in the retransmission state cannot generate 
new data packets [1]. 
1) Fading Model in the Primary Networks: let xp be the 
instantaneous power of a concerned packet signal in the 
primary network and be yi the instantaneous power of the 
interfering packets signals generated by the others PUs 
during a time slot. The fading model considered in [1] is a 
Rayleigh fading channel with the following exponential 
distributions,

where Xp and Yi are the average power of concerned and 
interfering packet signals, respectively. In [1], Xp=Yi. 
2) Capture Effect in the Primary Network: according to 
[1] and [9], the signals arriving at the receiver have different 
power levels due to transmission power practiced by the 
user, fading or shadowing. In this case, whether the power 
of the concerned data packet from a PU is greater than the 
sum of the powers levels of all interfering packets in this 
network and satisfies a given threshold, so-called capture 
ratio (R), the concerned packet can be detected by PAP and 
all others interfering users fail in access medium. Thus, the 
probability of capture (Pcap->PAP) can be calculated as [1],

B. Cognitive Network Analysis for the original model 
In this network, Slotted CSMA protocol is used for 
medium access and its proposed slot structure is presented in 
the Fig. 3 [1]. 
In the Fig. 3, the first and third time slots of the primary 
network are busy, i.e., they are used by PUs. The second and 
fourth ones represent spectral opportunities and they can be 
exploited by SUs. Each of idle time slots of Slotted Aloha is 
subdivided into mini-slots. So, the channel is time slot based 
for primary network and mini-slot based for secondary users. 
The duration of each mini slot is equal to the maximum 
propagation delay (p) found in the primary and secondary 
networks and corresponds to the distance from point a to b in 
the Fig. 3 [1]. 
There are two kinds of mini-slots: (1) few are designed 
for carrier sensing period (Smi), and (2) the most are aimed 
for packet transmissions (Tmi) of the SUs [1]. According to 
the Fig. 3, the maximum sensing period allowed is from 
point a, i.e., the beginning of an idle time slot, to point c and 
the sensing point is set to happen at the beginning of each 
mini-slot.  The distance between point c and point e is 
specified as the maximum length of the data packets (Tmi) 
from the secondary network in terms of the number of mini-
slots. Therefore, the packet length of the secondary network 
is shorter than the packet length of the primary network due 
to the carrier sensing period [1]. 
1) Traffic model for the secondary network: in the 
secondary network, using Slotted CSMA as protocol to 
access the channel, each SU can generate a new packet with 
probability (σmi) during a mini-slot. Consequently, the 
probability of a SU does not generate a new packet is (1-
σmi). Whether an unlicensed user is in the retransmission 
state, it cannot generate a new packet [1]. 
During an idle or busy time slot in the primary network, 
if a new packet is generated by a SU within carrier sensing 
period of a mini-slot, it senses the channel in the following 
sensing point of the carrier sensing period. If the channel is 
idle, its packet is transmitted immediately. If the channel is 
busy, the SU gives up and starts sensing the channel with 
probability σmi during each sensing point of the remaining 
carrier sensing period in the current time slot, i.e., the point c 
in Fig. 3. And whether the channel remains busy during this 
carrier sensing period, the process continues with probability 
σmi during each sensing point in the following time slots until 
the channel is idle and the packet is successfully transmitted. 
If a new packet is generated outside the designated carrier 
sensing period, the new packet is stored and the station 
begins to sense the channel with probability σmi during each 
sensing point in the following carrier sensing periods until 
the channel becomes idle and the new packet is successfully 
transmitted. According to [1], a packet transmission of a SU 
can start from any sensing point of the carrier sensing period 
that channel is sensed idle [1]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3.  Time slot structure of Slotted CSMA for secondary users 
Observing the cases (1) and (2) in the Fig. 3, one can 
observe that if the channel is sensed idle before the end of 
the carrier sensing period in the current time slot (point c in 
the Fig. 3), then after the end of packet transmission remains 
some unused mini-slots [1]. Finally, in the model proposed 
in [1], SU should be able to sense the channel and determine 
if it is busy or not. The idle time slots represent spectral 
opportunities that are disputed by the secondary users within 
an environment for cooperation between themselves. 
2) Fading Analysis and Capture Effect for the 
Secondary Network: let xs and zj be instantaneous power 
level of the concerned packet signal and the interfering 
packet signals originated in this network, respectively. In [1] 
is considered a Rayleigh fading channel with the following 
exponential distributions [1],

the total number of mini-slots that are spent in the process of 
packet transmission, including in this case both busy and 
idle slots. Then, the secondary network throughput, Sso, is

THE PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM MODEL 
In this section, we propose an extension to the original 
model considering the influence of PER in the calculation of 
throughput. Transmission errors occur during the packet 
detection due to the network interfering signals. This 
approach becomes a more realistic model, since the packets 
received with errors are discarded and retransmitted in the 
most of data communication applications. 
The system architecture shown in Fig. 1 is also used for 
the new model, as well as the structure of time slots and 
mini-slots introduced in the Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 in the original 
model.  
In this new model, the USs also use Slotted CSMA 
protocol to access the medium and they can sense the 
channel. Thus, during a packet transmission in a given 
network, primary or secondary, in the SIR calculating are 
considered only the interfering signals generated by users of 
that network, i.e., SUs cannot transmit packets when there 
are PUs attempting to transmit their packets. The Users from 
cognitive network only can transmit packets when a time slot 
of the primary network is idle. 
A. Packet Error Rate 
The knowledge of the packet error rate in communication 
systems is important, since in most of these systems, data are 
transmitted in packets rather than bit streams. Moreover, 
their performance is determined by PER instead of bit error 
rate (BER) or symbol error rate (SER) [10]. The PER is 
dependent of the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio 
(SNIR) in the considered channel. However, as in [11], the 
additive noise is negligible in interference-limited channels. 
Therefore the model called signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) 
is used in this paper. 
References [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] and [17] introduce 
empirical or approximate methods for PER calculating. Their 
conclusion is that such calculation is quite complex, 
imprecise and cannot be generalized to the real applications. 
All proposed methods above to calculate or estimate the PER 
model the communication channels according to a Markov 
chain, where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is partitioned 
into a finite number of states that can range between two and 
several. The difficulties of working with Markovian models 
are in to set the transition probabilities of states to reflect the 
real channel behavior. In [18], [19] and [20] methods for 
PER calculating are analyzed and  is proposed to study such 
behavior by collecting the real statistical information or even 
by using suitable simulation tools on computers. 
Due to the exposed above, in this paper, we choose to 
work with the methodology introduced in [10], which allows 
the calculation of PER as a function of SIR, in a direct and 
simple fashion by using a highly accurate upper bound for 
the system analyzed. 
Considering that the SUs can listen the channel and they 
cannot cause interference to PUs, we can obtain the expected 
value for SIR in the primary network, Δp, as below,

Now, let f(δ) be a function that links the PER with the 
instantaneous SIR at reception (δ) in a channel with additive 
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and p(δ) is the probability 
density function of SIR in the receiver, with exponential 
distribution. According to [10], the average PER, represented 
by Pave(Δ), can be calculated by the following integrals,

bound provides an accurate value for the PER under some 
assumptions, e.g., when coherent BPSK is employed as a 
technique for modulation, with or without a channel coding 
scheme and by using some packet lengths (greater than or 
equal to 127 bits when channel coding is not used). In our 
analysis we assume coherent BPSK modulation without a 
channel coding scheme and with packets length of 127 [bits]. 
According to the considerations above, in this paper, we 
consider that the PER and the PSR are obtained in an 
approximate fashion by the equations presented below,

B. The Primary Network Throughput for the New model 
The primary network throughput is defined as the total 
number of packets transmitted by the licensed users and 
received correctly by PAP during a time slot [1].  
In the new system model, a packet is considered 
successfully transmitted when it is captured by the receiver 
and it does not have any errors due to interference present in 
the networks. In this case, the primary network throughput, 
Spn, is approximately given by:

defined as the length of packet in terms of mini-slots divided 
by the total number of mini-slots used in the transmission 
process, including both busy and idle slots [1]. When one 
considers only the packets received without errors due to

following graphics are used the same parameters introduced 
in [1], i.e., Np = 20 (users), Ns = 20 (users), R = 3 (dB),  = 
10, Smi = 10 (mini slots), Tmi = 100 (mini slots) e σp = σmi.

The graphs of Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and, Fig. 6 show that the 
effect of the PER on the primary and secondary networks 
transmissions, due to interference caused by their stations, 
cannot be disregarded. When one considers the PER, there is 
a significant reduction in the primary and secondary network 
throughput and also in the overall network throughput.

CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we propose a new model to compute the 
throughput in a cognitive radio network, considering Slotted 
Aloha in the licensed network and Slotted CSMA in the 
cognitive network. This proposed model is an extension of 
the model analyzed in [1]. 
The new model proposed considers the interference 
between the stations of the networks and their effects over 
the throughput of each network. It is verified that the 
interference increases the packet error rate and reduces the 
primary network throughput, the secondary network 
throughput and overall networks throughput. Therefore, it is 
concluded that the PER, due to interference between radio 
stations of both networks, cannot be neglected, as happens in 
[1]. 
As suggestion for future study, it is proposed to 
investigate mechanisms to reduce the packet error rate on the 
networks and thereby improve the throughput of each 
network and the overall throughput.
