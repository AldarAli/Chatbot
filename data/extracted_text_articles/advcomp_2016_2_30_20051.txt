Abstract—The use of minus identity lenses with an angle-cut
collimator can achieve high contrast images in high-energy
proton radiography. This article presents the principles of
choosing the angle-cut aperture of the collimator for different
energies and objects. Numerical simulation using the Monte
Carlo code Geant4 has been implemented to investigate the
entire radiography for the French test object. The optimum
angle-cut apertures of the collimators are also obtained for
different energies.

INTRODUCTION
High-energy proton radiography could provide a new,
quantitative, and much more capable diagnostic technique to
analyze the aspects for hydrotest experiments [1]. The three
most important effects on the protons as they go through an
object are absorption, multiple Coulomb scattering (MCS),
and energy loss. The key technology that led to the
development of proton radiography is a magnetic imaging
lens system located between the object and the image, which
forms a point-to-point focus of the proton beam and provides
good position resolution over the entire field of view
required for radiography.
The lens is a minus identity lens. Mottershead and
Zumbro [2] demonstrated that it is possible to sort the
scattered beam in terms of how it has been scattered. This
always occurs in the mid-plane (Fourier plane) of a
chromatically matched identity lens, where the trajectory
position depends only on the MCS angle, independent of the
initial position. If one places an angular collimator at this
intermediate Fourier plane where the rays are completely
sorted by MCS angle, it is possible to apply an angle-cut to
the proton beam, removing part of the scattered beam.
It is a very important to improve the diagnostic technique.
By using a single magnetic lens with just an angle-cut, one
can achieve high contrast images in proton radiography. The
angle-cut must be different for different proton energies and
objects. In order to obtain the best image, it is desirable to
choose the matching angular collimator and give an optimum
angle-cut for that collimator [3].
This paper is organized as follows. The basic principles
of proton radiography and choosing collimator angle-cut
aperture are presented in Sections II and III, respectively. In
Section IV, the numerical results are obtained with the
Geant4 toolkit. Finally, the conclusion is given in Section V.
II.
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PROTON RADIOGRAPHY
The processes of proton radiography can be described by
assuming
a
simple
exponential
formula
for
nuclear
attenuation and the angular distribution of scattering as
Gaussian MCS [4]. In this approximation, the transmission
of
protons
through
the
magnetic
lens
and
angle-cut
collimators has the following form:

The first term of (1) in the attenuation is the nuclear
attenuation and is analogous to X-ray attenuation processes,
but the second term is due to angular attenuation and makes
proton radiography unique. Angular attenuation provides
another way of distinguishing material properties.

PRINCIPLES OF CHOOSING COLLIMATOR ANGLE-CUT
APERTURE
Different collimator apertures will permit the obtaining
of different radiographs per proton pulse in the image plane.
In order to obtain the best image, which can produce an
intensified effect between the special points or structures in
transmission; it is desirable to choose a matching angular

collimator. The MCS
0
θ is proportional to the beam energy,
so that the angle-cut
θcut
must be different for different
proton energies. By placing an aperture restriction at the
Fourier plane that removes scattered beam with large angles,
the image contrast can be enhanced to give optimal images.
The transmission along ray j can be expressed by

The value of the optimal cut angle can be determined by
Eq. 5. At high energies where the mean free path
iλ for the
i’th material is approximately constant, by setting the
derivative of
∆T
with respect to
θcut
to zero, the optimum
angle-cut can be obtained.

GEANT4 SIMULATION
The simulations of the transport of protons have been
implemented
with
the
Geant4
toolkit
[5]
in
proton
radiography. The central part of the collimator designed in
the simulation was the same as that in the experimental setup
used at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In experiment 955
[6], the protons were provided by the Alternating Gradient
Synchrotron, and the momentum of the protons was 24
GeV/c. The collimators approximated multiple-scattering
angle acceptance cuts of 6.68 mrad. We have taken data on a
thick test object, the so-called French Test Object (FTO),
which was designed to allow French and U.S. experimenters
to collaborate on high-energy X-ray radiography methods
and analysis, and their detection [7]. The FTO consisted of
three concentric spherical shells. The inner shell was
uranium with an inside radius of 1 cm and an outside radius
of 4.5 cm. This was surrounded by a copper shell of outside
radius of 6.5 cm, and this was surrounded by a shell of foam
plastic with an outside radius of 22.5 cm.
The transmissions for the FTO are taken with different
angle-cut apertures of the collimators. The transmission
versus angle-cut aperture for 10 GeV, 23 GeV and 50 GeV
proton radiography are plotted in Fig. 1. The highest points
of the curves are the optimum angle-cut apertures. From Fig.
1, we can see that the optimum angle-cut apertures of the
collimators are 13.09 mrad for 10 GeV, 6.68 mrad for 23
GeV and 2.56 mrad for 50 GeV for the FTO.
Figure 1.
The difference in transmission between central point and the
inner shell of uranium as a function of angle-cut aperture.
The simulation results of the proton radiograph image
plane of the FTO are shown in Fig. 2. The image in Fig. 2(a)
corresponds to the normal angle-cut apertures of the 6.68
mrad collimator, and the image in Fig. 2(b) corresponds to
the
optimum
angle-cut
apertures
of
the
13.09
mrad
collimator for 10 GeV, respectively. Fig. 2(c) is the radial
distribution for the FTO radiograph where the highest outer
dosage is 1.
Figure 2.
Simulation results from image plane of FTO at 10 GeV protons
with angle-cut.
It can be seen that with the increase of angle-cut, there
are more protons received in the image plane, and the image
becomes lighter. It is obvious that the whole structure of the
object can be seen from the image of angle-cut at 13.09 mrad
but the core of the object cannot be distinguished if the
angle-cut is at 6.68 mrad. This conclusion is consistent with
Fig. 1.
V.
CONCLUSIONS
The ability of proton radiography to adjust the image
contrast by adjusting the angle-cut aperture of the collimator
has been demonstrated. There is an optimum angle-cut
aperture of the collimator for a given object and a given

energy. The angle-cut aperture of the collimator is chosen
according to the optical thickness of the object. In this
article, using the Monte Carlo code Geant4, the optimum
angle-cut apertures of the collimators are obtained as 13.09
mrad for 10 GeV, 6.68 mrad for 23 GeV and 2.56 mrad for
50 GeV respectively for the FTO. The numerical results
indicate that the image resolution can be improved by
choosing the optimum angle-cut apertures of collimators.
Thus, the study is beneficial for the design of the magnetic
imaging lens in high-energy proton radiography.
