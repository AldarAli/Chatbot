Abstract — The present paper aims at the specific 
application of Radio-over-Fibre to provide dedicated 
Wi-Fi access to tramway passengers. The challenge here 
is to provide wireless services in densely populated city 
areas based on a real-case scenario targeting public 
transport. The proposed system targets 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 
access at 1 Mbps per user inside a tram, with a wireless 
bridge at 5 GHz along the track. A chosen design will 
finally be implemented and evaluated in terms of WiFi 
coverage, BER and power consumption. Lessons learned 
will be interpolated for 60 GHz RoF for Wi-Fi access. 
Replacing the 5-GHz track site solution by a 60 GHz 
wireless link will bring a significant increase in data 
throughput (>1 Gbps). We report here performances of 
running experiments on 2.4 and 5 GHz RoF systems and 
results on photonic 60 GHz generation for existing fibre 
backbone between the stations. 
 
Keywords - radio-over-fibre applications; multiple standards; 
running experiments.

INTRODUCTION 
There is a growing demand for high-speed wireless 
access by the end users while they are on the move using 
trains, buses, planes, ships, etc [1-3]. Yet, train operators 
offer 
limited 
radiofrequency-based 
wireless 
network 
solutions to passengers on their intercity high-speed trains. 
Such solutions are mainly based on mobile (UMTS, LTE-
4G) and/or satellite communications but are limited in terms 
of bandwidth, resulting in slow access even under the best 
conditions. One attractive way to overcome these limitations 
is to employ Radio-over-Fibre (RoF) transmissions to 
transport 
data-carrying 
radio-frequency 
(RF) 
signals 
optically to/from a set of wireless access points distributed 
along the track. Ongoing project CapilRTram (2011-2012) 
aims at developing a fibre-supported wireless system to 
provide high speed and seamless Wi-Fi connectivity along 
the new tramway line (under deployment) in Brest (France). 
One key advantage is that all stations are interconnected by 
an optical distribution network. 
Section II of this paper presents the general system 
architecture of the Tram infrastructure. As will be shown, 
this system deals with different frequencies: Section III 
deals with the frequency 2,4 GHz to provide Wi-Fi for the 
passengers waiting in the tram station. In section IV, we 
focus on the frequency of 5 GHz to provide Wi-Fi 
connectivity between the Tram station and passengers inside 
the tram. Finally, Section V deals with the mm wave 
generation as 60 GHz band is an alternative to the 5 GHz 
link discussed in Section IV.

OVERALL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  General system architecture 
As depicted in Fig. 1, the proposed system comprises, at 
each station, an optical node (5) including a bidirectional 
optoelectronic transceiver (O/E; E/O) adapted to convert RF 
signals into the optical domain and vice-versa. This 
transceiver is coupled to a first wireless module (3) which is 
adapted to communicate with at least one RF transceiver (1; 
2) installed on top of each tramway carriage, thereby 
forming a high-speed wireless bridge between the tram and 
the stations. For that purpose, the antennas are selected and 
positioned to ensure continuous link availability between 
the station and the tram. A second wireless module (4) 
coupled to the optical node (5) provides wireless coverage 
to passengers waiting on the station platform. The first and 
second modules (3; 4) may be combined in a single module. 
The proposed system is Wi-Fi compliant (IEEE 802.11 
a/g/b) and adapted to operate simultaneously on two distinct 
RF bands (i.e. 2.4 GHz and 5 or 60 GHz). Microwave links 
(e.g. 5 GHz) or millimetre-wave links (e.g. 60 GHz) will be 
deployed using commercially available equipment all along 
the tramway line to connect tram carriages to stations. 
Inside the tram, Wi-Fi coverage is provided at the 
conventional 2.4 GHz band by a commercially available 
wireless access point (1). Wi-Fi access points (4) at 2.4 GHz

will also be provided to passengers on the station platform. 
The proposed solution is a flexible (easily upgradeable) and 
low-cost for a dedicated wireless access with high speed 
connections based on mature technology (IEEE 802.11a, 54 
Mbps for 5 GHz). Thanks to its fibre base, it is transparent 
to wireless protocols and future-proof. There will be no 
need to replace the whole infrastructure in case higher 
throughputs are needed or other frequency bands need to be 
used.  Replacing the 5-GHz link by a 60 GHz wireless link 
will bring a significant increase in data throughput [4] using 
existing standards at 57-66 GHz (ECMA-387, IEEE 
802.15.3c or IEEE 802.11ad). 
 
III.  BI-DIRECTIONAL ROF/ DAS LINK AT 2.4 GHZ (IEEE 
802.11B/G) 
Radio-over-fibre 
techniques 
used 
to 
interconnect 
optically wireless access points over Distributed Antenna 
Systems (DAS) could provide sustainable solutions for 
delivering high data rates to mobile end-users in public 
transport. In RoF systems, both the carrier and the data 
signals are transmitted from a central office via an optical 
fibre feed network to the remote antenna units from where 
they are distributed to the mobile end-users via wireless 
links. With RoF DAS, the transmitted signals can be easily 
shared amongst a large set of cells to provide improved 
coverage with reduced power levels. DAS was shown to be 
a flexible, bandwidth-efficient and cost-effective option for 
fibre-radio access infrastructure [5-6]. The use of RoF in 
moving vehicles is a novel application of RoF and more 
particularly for trains.  
 
A Wi-Fi DAS demonstrator adapted to operate at 2.4 
GHz will provide wireless coverage for mobile users, 
waiting for the tramway on the station platform. With 
reference to the overall system architecture illustrated in 
Fig. 1, the optical node at each station is connected to the 
optical distribution network by means of silica single-mode 
fibres (SMF) that transport the data-carrying RF signals on 
an optical carrier up to the individual roadside antenna 
units. As depicted in Fig. 2, the proposed DAS demonstrator 
comprises a conventional wireless router adapted to 
distribute Wi-Fi signals (IEEE 802.11b/g) to a set of four 
wideband omni-directional antennas, through a wired 
infrastructure based on fibre and coaxial cable. A circulator 
is used at each end of the loop to isolate the signals on the 
uplink and on the downlink. The circulators with an 
isolation of 23 dB could be replaced by switches showing an 
isolation level of 30-40 dB. An optical transmission link 
was introduced between the router and the antennas by 
means of two bidirectional RoF transceivers (E/O; O/E) 
with an output optical power of - 4.56 dBm and connected 
to each other by a 500-m single-mode fibre span. This 
length of fibre corresponds to the average distance between 
two adjacent stations in Brest.  
 
Figure 2.  Bi-directional RoF-DAS demonstrator  based on commercially-
available components (Buffalo Wi-Fi router Model WHR-HP-G54) at 2.4 
GHz; 2 RF Circulators; 2 FiberSpan bidirectional Transceivers  (O/E; E/O) 
for 2.4 - 2.5 GHz with  1.5µm and 1.3µm optical sources; 1 Power supply 
for the two FiberSpan modules (HAMEG HM8040-3 (12V) – not shown 
here; 500m SMF (Corning); 4 Omni-directional Antennas 2.4/5 
GHz  (Hyperlink HG2458CU) 
Power measurements (see Fig. 2) showed an attenuation 
of 18 dB between the RF output of the router and the output 
of the 2nd circulator. The optical link composed of the two 
RoF transceivers and the optical fibre span was 
characterised in terms of gain (-25 dB), non-linearity (Input 
Interception Point Order 3: 0 dBm <IIP3< 25 dBm), noise 
performance (Noise Figure: 50 dB <NF<55 dB) and 
frequency response (bandwidth: 2.4 GHz). Due to the low 
optical IIP3 and high NF of the optical link, the dynamic 
range (DR) of the RF signals must be reduced in order to 
meet the SNR requirements (minimum level of output signal 
power > noise + SNR) and to avoid the nonlinearities 
(maximum level of output signal power < OIP3 – 20 dB). 
DR is an important parameter for mobile cellular 
communications because the power received by the antenna 
from the endpoint varies widely (e.g. DR = 52 dB: -82 dBm 
to -30 dBm for WLAN 802.11g,). Automatic Gain Control 
techniques can be used to adapt the RoF system to various 
signal levels as described in the Wi-Fi standard.  
 
The system performance has been assessed through bi-
directional transmission of High Definition (HD) videos 
between two computers as shown in Fig. 2. Free software 
VLC 1.1.9 was used in broadcast mode to transmit 
1360x768 HD video signals with an average data rate of 
17.66 Mbps and maximum possible 20 Mbps. 
 
IV. ROF LINK AT 5 GHZ (IEEE 802.11A/N) 
According to the proposed system architecture, tram 
stations are interconnected by an optical distribution 
network and each station is connected to the tram by a 5 
GHz Wi-Fi link.  
For demonstration purposes, we tested the architecture as 
shown in Fig. 3 towards the 60 GHz RoF approach. This 
approach becomes essential to provide high data rates 
>10Gbps with high available bandwidth (7 GHz) to the end-
user.

Photonic RF generation was performed by means of a 
DFB Laser Diode (LD), operating at 1309 nm with an 
optical output power of 9.28 dBm directly modulated by 5 
GHz RF signal at -10 dBm . Applying a direct modulated 
laser (DML) at frequency f0 and a RF source with a 
frequency fRF, the generated first-order sidebands are 
located at a frequencies f0 + fRF and f0 - fRF. The same DSL 
technique can be applied at much higher frequencies in the 
millimetre-wave range. 
Broadband modulation in the optical domain was carried 
out using a LiNbO3 40 Gbps Mach-Zehnder modulator 
(MZM). The modulator acts here as an optical mixer, 
multiplying the optical RF carrier with the data signal. As 
shown on Fig. 3 the transmitter is followed by a polarisation 
controller (PC) to adjust and maintain the polarisation state 
of the light for the MZM, which is extremely polarisation 
sensitive. The maximum RF power that can be possibly 
applied directly to the RF input port of the MZM is 28 dBm 
(i.e. 2 dBm delivered to the input of its driver amplifier 
which has a gain of 26 dB). We used -20 dBm GSM /IEEE 
802.11.b signal at 5 GHz. The modulator is driven by a 
driver amplifier (bias 7.34 Volt corresponding to 256 mA) 
and biased at Vπ, here 6.5 Volt and modulated first with a 
GSM data signal, generated by a R&S vector signal 
generator with a level of -20dBm maximum output power 
of 64 dBm for 2.4 GHz (GSM) with demodulation rate 270 
kHz; symbol rate 270 ksym/s and GSM modulation 
1bit/sym. The optical power measured at the output of 
MZM was -6 dBm.  
 
The RoF unit is adapted to transmit the RF signal at 5 
GHz in free space to the end user terminal. This RoF unit 
consists of a photodetector (PD) that converts the received 
optical signal to an electrical 5 GHz signal, a power 
amplifier that boosts this electrical signal and an antenna 
adapted to operate up to 5.8 GHz. The PD (U2t Photonics 
XPDV3120R-FC-VF) has a bandwidth of 70 GHz and a 
responsivity of 0.57 A/W. The gain of the photodetector 
equals to -42 dB as measured by connecting it to the directly 
modulated laser diode LD (9.28 dBm optical LD output, -52 
dBm electrical PD output). 
  
The performance of the modulation procedure has been 
evaluated. The power of the optical signal measured at the 
output of the MZM was equal to -11.8 dBm with an input 
RF signal power level of -20 dBm. With a PD gain of -42 
dB, the output signal should be -63.8 dBm as compared to 
its measured value: -64 dBm).  Eye diagram for this signal 
is wide open with EVM = 6.5%, Peak EVM=15%, Mean 
Power = -62.3 dBm and SNR = 24 dB. Changing the level 
of the input signal up to -10 dBm shows corresponding 
results: satisfactory error-vector magnitude EVM = 2.5%, 
Peak EVM = 6%, Mean Power = -53.5 dBm, SNR = 32 dB.

Clearly open eye diagrams were observed for GSM

clearly “recognized”. Adding a low noise RF amplifier

Impedance Amplifier (TIA) after the photodiode  can 
improve corresponding values to EVM = 1%, Peak EVM = 
2.5%, Mean Power = -45 dBm (compared to -62 dBm 
before), SNR = 40 dB (compared to 24 dB before).   
 
To analyse the link performance, we have used Rhode& 
Schwarz OFDM Software working as a vector signal 
analyser. This Software synchronises and demodulates the 
modulated signal. For this purpose, we have chosen a 
standard WLAN A – 64 QAM demodulation and both 
cyclic and pilot aided synchronisations. EVM vs. Carrier 
diagram (showing peak, average, minimum performance) 
and selected constellation diagram, taken by choosing 
digital standard GSM-EDGE (GSM LNB) are displayed in 
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. EVM analysis shows that multiple 
standard wireless access signals such as GSM and WLAN 
802.11g can be successfully transmitted with no errors. 
With input Wi-Fi signal of -10 dBm, EVM is about 10% 
worse than with the GSM signal of the same power. In fact, 
as the envelope of Wi-Fi signals is no longer constant, it is 
possible that the peaks of signal exceed the maximum RF 
input level allowed by the MZM. In order to improve EVM 
and constellation, the input signal power of the driver 
should be less than – 20 dBm.

V. PHOTONIC 60 GHZ GENERATION (IEEE 802.11AD) BASED 
UPON EXTERNAL MODULATION 
 
With the use of the IEEE 802.11ad standard, higher 
throughputs could be achieved - at least 3 Gbps within 4 m 
and 1 Gbps up to 25 m [7]. Such speed becomes mandatory 
to deliver future applications. The standard takes advantage 
of large continuous blocks of unlicensed spectrum at 60 
GHz. As signal bandwidth and carrier frequencies keep on 
increasing, there is an urgent need to define the full potential 
of RoF technology for the transport of various wireless 
signals and protocols to meet the demand for new wireless 
services with enhanced data throughputs in moving 
vehicles. With the implementation of 60 GHz RoF, more 
than 1 Gbps could be delivered on wireless links between 
the tram carriages and the stations. Rather than generating 
the local oscillator signal electrically at each station, it is 
optically generated from a central point and distributed to 
the stations. Optical heterodyning was used to generate the 
60 GHz carrier according to the schematics as shown in 
Fig.7. Some of the equipment listed in the previous 
paragraph was used in combination with a high power laser 
diode (ILX Lightwave). The DFB laser diode operating at 
1550 nm was driven by a precision current source (LDX-
3545B) and stabilised by a temperature controller (LDT-
5412). The operating point was fixed at 18 dBm, 
corresponding to λ0 = 1548 nm. The laserdiode is again 
followed by a polarisation controller, slightly reducing the 
optical power to 17.7 dBm.

Using the driver amplifier, the modulator (MZM) was 
biased at a minimum transmission point (MITP, here 1.5V), 
in order to suppress the optical carrier at central wavelength 
λ0 , and modulated with a millimetre-wave signal at a 
frequency of 30 GHz, provided by the signal generator 
Anritsu MG-364A. The power of the 30 GHz input signal 
was set to -10 dBm.  If bias is set to MITP with respect to 
the optical carrier, the carrier is cancelled out as the phase 
shift between both arms is set to π. While applying an 
electrical signal at half the desired mm-wave frequency, i.e. 
30 GHz (= 0.5 x fLO) to the RF electrode of the modulator, 
the total frequency difference between both sidebands is 
now fLO = 60 GHz.  Two optical signals with a wavelength 
separation of 0.5 nm at 1550 nm generate the desired beat 
frequency upon detection by the photodiode: δf = f2 - f1 = 
c/λ2 − c/λ with  λ1= 1562.5 nm and λ2 = 1562 nm. Applied

signal generation technique is called double-sideband with 
carrier-suppression (DSB-CS) (see [8-9]). 
 
Simulations under VPI Transmission MakerTM, based on 
the schematics shown on Fig. 8 demonstrate that sidebands 
suppression contrast here is about 36 dB (see Fig. 9). The 
output optical field from the modulator consists now of the 
suppressed optical carrier and two optical sidebands (lower 
and upper sidebands). Additionally, Fig. 10a illustrates that 
the maximum output power at 60 GHz that can be obtained 
with this material is equal to -35 dBm. From Fig. 10b, it is 
also clear that -35 dBm is the highest measured power value 
for the discussed system.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS  
 
In this paper, we have proposed track side solutions to 
provide Wi-Fi to tram passengers. Different scenarios, based 
on RoF were simulated and tested, in order to demonstrate 
their performance for tram installations and to make an 
insight into the limits of existing RoF components. Through 
careful application of bias, the linear and nonlinear domains 
of the MZM transfer function are successfully used for 60 
GHz generation and for broadband modulation. VPI 
simulations were proved to be reliable and will be required 
in the future for the implementation of multiple standard 
solutions. Thanks to the broadband operation characteristics 
of the MZM and the PD, the proposed system can 
advantageously accommodate a large range of frequencies. 
System validations will follow by identification of critical 
components and optimization of energy consumption on 3 
(out of 28) tramway stations in Brest and 2 carriages.
