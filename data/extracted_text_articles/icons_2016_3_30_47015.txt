ABSTRACT— In this paper, we developed a real-time lane 
change assist (LCA) system based on automotive radar. The 
existing blind spot detection system only makes detection in a 
very limited zone up to about 5m, thus responding more slowly 
to vehicles approaching at faster speeds. In order to overcome 
this limitation, a radar-based LCA system was developed to 
provide information before vehicles enter the blind spot detec-
tion (BSD) and LCA zone. The performance of the developed 
LCA system was verified in an anechoic chamber and driving 
 environments.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, many vehicles have been equipped with driver 
assisting systems to assist drivers in their judgement and to 
prevent preventable accidents. Statistics show that most car 
accidents are caused by carelessness or misjudgment on the 
part of the driver. As such, the United States and Europe 
have enforced regulations on the installation of driver 
assistance systems and safety devices.  
Among the many safety systems, Blind Spot Detection 
(BSD) alerts the driver of possible collisions by detecting 
vehicles in the blind spot. The detection zone of the BSD 
system is shown in ISO 17387, which is presented in Figure 
1 [1]. When a car approaches rapidly from behind while the 
driver is attempting to change lanes, the driver may not 
receive sufficient information in a short BSD zone [2]. A 
Lane Change Assist (LCA) system that provides information 
on target vehicles from longer distances is needed to alert the 
driver of vehicles approaching from behind. 
Previously, BSD and LCA systems include infrared, 
vision, and ultrasonic sensors. However, these sensors are 
very sensitive to weather or have shorter detection distances. 
For vision sensor and ultrasonic sensors, the detectable 
ranges are about within 30m and 12m, respectively. Recently, 
to overcome these limitations, Radar based BSD and LCA 
systems is being developed having less sensitive to weather 
and with longer detection distances [3]. 
And, the main contribution is to extend the maximum 
detectable range up to 80m comparable to the conventional 
radar based LCA system. To do this, we enhanced SNR 
performance by accumulating the received beat signals using 
multiple chirp signals. 
In this paper, we developed a real-time radar based 
automotive LCA system. Here, a real-time means the system 
operates the LCA algorithm fully every 200ms time 
according to the standard 17387. Then, developed LCA 
System is verified in a chamber and various driving test sites.  
The rest of this paper is organized. In section II, we will 
illustrate development of a radar based automotive LCA 
system. In section III, to verify the feasibility of our 
developed LCA system, the environment of measurement 
and experimental results will be shown. Section IV 
concludes this paper.

LCA system in Table I. As shown in Table I, the center fre-
quency is set to 24GHz, and the bandwidth is set to 200MHz.

a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar [4] 
that outputs signals of 200 MHz in the range of 24.05GHz ~ 
24.25GHz at 10dBm power in the transmitter.  
Figure 3 shows the picture of antenna patterns in our 
developed LCA system. The transmission antenna is 
composed of 5 antenna element arrays. The transmission 
antenna arrays make beam shape cover the BSD and LCA 
zones simultaneously. There are two Rx channels having 
only output real signals for LCA detection, and a channel 
having I and Q output  signals for BSD detection.

C. Back-End Module and Radar Signal Processing 
We show the photo of back end module (BEM) in Figure 
4. The BEM was developed on the TMS320 DSP processor 
that operates at a maximum of 150MHz. Because the DSP 
processor is a low-cost and high-efficiency processor, it 
makes our designed LCA system cost-effective. Also, it 
provides various interfaces, such as ADC, Direct Memory 
Access (DMA), and Controller Area Network (CAN), in 
addition to a high-performance signal processing library.  
Figure 5 shows the block diagram of the developed LCA 
and BSD system. First, in the main task block of BEM, the 
RF_ON signal is transmitted to start the FEM. The FEM 
module receives the RF_ON signal to transmit FMCW radar 
signals, and outputs RF_Sync signals in a PRI period. The 
RF_Sync signals provide external interrupts to the BEM, 
which in turn leads to the external interrupt task and DMA 
interrupt task. 
The external interrupt task triggers the ADC, and beat 
signals are converted into digitalized signals to be stored in 
the DMA buffer. The DMA interrupt task is synchronized 
with RF_Sync signals from the FEM, and stores the 
digitalized beat signals in the external RAM according to the 
predetermined size and number by the DMA buffer. Once 
storing signals is complete, the DMA interrupt task stops the 
external interrupt task and runs the main task. The main task 
runs the radar signal processing so-called detection and 
tracking algorithms. 
Figure 6 presents the simplified radar algorithms of the 
radar signal processing in our developed system [6]. For 
distinguishing driving lane from another lane, digital beam 
forming [7] was applied to extract angles of target vehicles. 
The 2D-FFT algorithm was utilized to obtain the distances 
and velocities [7] and [8]. Due to the homodyne transceiver 
used for a cost-effective radar module, the DC–offset 
component is inherently included in the beat signals. For 
improving the performance of a near range detection, the DC 
offset was digitally calculated and removed. Next, a first 
FFT was processed the beat signals for range extraction, and 
a second FFT was processed the range bin in a PRI direction 
for Doppler extraction. Digital beam forming processing was 
performed the beat signals in an antenna direction for angle 
extraction. Finally, the target range, velocity, and angle were 
detected based on Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) and 
Peak Power Spectral Density (PSD) Detection. The final 
results provide various safety systems through a CAN 
communication. The total processing time of this system is 
within about 100ms.

MEASUREMENT RESULTS 
This section illustrates the environment of measurement 
and measurement results. Figure 7 shows the experiment 
setup of our developed LCA system. The FEM and BEM are 
integrated using a single connection socket, and the signals 
are exchanged between the two. The output is passed 
through CAN, and the results are sent to a PC through a 
CAN to LAN convertor. The final results were displayed 
using a monitoring program.

developed LCA system. The 95% probability of detection is 
met to the OEM requirements and the range accuracy of 
0.5m is good enough to meet the requirement according to

was evaluated in an anechoic chamber and real-road sites.

First, the probability of detection and false alarm rate 
were verified. Measurements were taken in the chamber in 
cases of single and multiple targets. A total of 400 single 
targets were detected in 400 attempts, and 770 multiple tar-
gets were detected in 800 attempts. A detection rate of 97.5% 
was achieved over 1,200 attempts. Table IV shows the detec-
tion results.

In order to evaluate the maximum detection performance, 
the developed LCA system was 20 times repeatedly tested on 
a moving target in a driving road site. The Figure 9 shows 
the experimental setup in the vehicle test site. Figure 9(a) 
shows the radar attached on the right side of the back bumper. 
A tilting device was installed to adjust the radar angle and 
direction. Figure 9(b) shows the radar-attached vehicle and 
the position of the target vehicle, which was set to move to 
the left of the radar. Figure 9(c) shows the scenario, while 
Figure 9(d) presents the GUI of the test results. The GUI 
outputs distance, velocity, angle, and camera images of the 
target vehicle. The target vehicle was detected at a maximum 
range of 80 m. The probability of detection was 97% meas-
ured.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, we developed a real-time radar-based au-
tomotive LCA system up to 80m without increasing output 
power. The system was based on a low-cost high-efficiency 
processor. The radar signal processing was carried out using 
2D-FFT and digital beamforming algorithms. The radar was 
tested in an anechoic chamber and real driving road test site.  
Further tests will be conducted in various actual driving en-
vironments and road conditions.
