Abstract — This article presents a dual beam array (DBA) for 
higher-order sectorization of a cellular site. This technique 
provides a means of cost-effective boosting network capacity 
without the use of additional frequency spectrum. The DBA 
comprises of a multi-column array and a beam forming circuit, 
which produces two overlapping beams with adjustable beam 
patterns. The proposed antenna is an adjustable cylindrical sector 
array, composed of three separate linear array columns. This 
structure allows for the formation of two overlapping beams with 
amplitude and phase excitations which can be implemented using 
a compact and low loss circuit. The adjustable offset displacement 
for the center column array allows for the refinement and 
adjustment of the pattern characteristics of the two overlapping 
beams. This method results in a beam split loss of less than 0.5dB 
in comparison to a single beam case. Performance parameters 
such as the beam cross-over loss and pattern discrimination 
between beams can also be adjusted in-situ for optimum 
operation.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Higher order sectorization provides a means of increasing 
cellular network capacity and providing optimum coverage 
without the use of additional frequency spectrum. Partial use 
of higher order sectorization is particularly useful for cost- 
effective accommodation of service growth in a localized 
service area within a cellular coverage. In these localized 
‘hotspot’ areas antennas with multiple beams of narrower 
beamwidth and higher directivity can be used to increase the 
overall capacity. For instance, one of the 65 degree sectors 
within a cell site that has a higher traffic may be served using 
two overlapping beams of 33 degrees. This method allows an 
increase in an overall network capacity by using multiple 
columns of linear array arranged on a cylindrical curvature. 
This arrangement results in an amplitude and phase excitation 
that can be implemented using a simple and low-loss beam-
forming network. It produces two symmetrical beams with 
respect to the azimuth boresight. Radiation patterns of the two 
beams are overlapped in the manner that the coverage of the 
cellular sector can be optimized using the adjustable beam 
array.  
 
Multibeam patterns of a multi-column array are typically 
formed using a combination of hybrids, couplers and phase 
shifters [2-4]. This general beam forming method often incurs 
an additional front-end loss as a result of circuit path losses 
and signal split between beams. Furthermore, a general beam 
forming method often requires multiple crossing between input 
feed lines, which can cause difficulties in the actual beam-
forming circuit implementation. This article is an extension of 
the previous reports [1][5], which presents the concept and test 
results of a proposed dual beam array (DBA) and the 
associated beam forming structure for use in efficient beam 
forming of two overlapping beams. Details of simulations and 
test results are also included. The adjustable DBA and the 
associated BFN technology under this development are patent 
pending 
and 
are 
strictly 
proprietary 
to 
Powerwave 
Technologies.   
 
A brief summary of the concept, design goals, and critical 
parameters of the proposed DBA is given in Section II. 
Section III describes theoretical background and feasibility of 
the implementation using a three-column array, while the 
proposed concept and implementation of the compact 3-to-2 
microstrip beam forming network is given in Section IV. The 
geometry and performances of the broad beamwidth aperture-
coupled patch is described in Section V. EM Simulations 
using HFSS and measured radiations patterns using spherical 
near-field range is given in Section VI and Section VII, 
respectively. Section VIII briefly compares and discusses the 
theoretical and measured results. Section IX concludes the 
paper.  
II. DUAL BEAM ARRAY 
Fig. 1 shows the concept of the proposed dual beam array. 
Each of the overlapping beams has a typical HPBW of 33 deg. 
The design is such that the combined pattern of the array 
matches the required coverage of a typical cellular sector     
(65 degree coverage). The dual beam array can potentially 
increase the overall capacity because of the narrower beams 
and higher antenna directivities. However, because the two 
beams are adjacent to each other, compromises in antenna 
performances such as signal interference between the two 
beams and hand-over loss are often required. By using a three-
column array with a movable center column, these 
compromises can be made adjustable in-situ to meet any 
particular need.

Table 1 gives a summary of the desired antenna parameters of 
the DBA. In this case, the antenna is designed for UMTS 
band, 1700MHz to 2200MHz. The total coverage angle is 
typically 67 degree. Beamwidth of the dual beams is expected 
to be approximately 33 degree.   
 
Key parameters of the dual-beam array are: (1) Aperture size 
and overall RF beam forming losses, (2) signal interference 
between the two adjacent beams, (3) loss factor at the cross-
over (hand-over) point. A typical DBA using conventional 
beam forming technique cannot deliver optimum performance 
in all these aspects. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The goal of this study is to develop a DBA which will permit 
trade-off and compromises between these parameters in order 
to achieve the optimum performance for a given application. 
The design will allow trade-off between signal interference 
and the cross-over loss between the two beams.   
 
III. 3-COLUMN DUAL BEAM ARRAY 
The proposed antenna can be perceived as a superposition of 
two partially-filled ring arrays. The azimuth pattern of the two-
ring circular array can be varied by adjusting the relative 
dimension of the radiuses of the rings. Fig. 3 depicts the 
theoretical model of a general two-ring array.

        Fig. 4. Three-column array with adjustable center column  
 
The radiating elements are aperture-coupled patches. Each of 
the three linear arrays is mounted on a separate reflector. 
Radius of the inside ring, a1, is determined by the subtend 
angle of the two edge reflectors, α. Radius of the outside ring, 
a2, is set and adjusted by the vertical displacement, D, which 
can be varied between -5mm to +25mm in the direction of the 
mechanical boresight direction.       
 
The relative slope of the two edge columns, α, with respect to 
the center column, is critical in achieving the required pattern 
shapes and beam cross-over loss. Typically, this angle is set 
between 20 degree and 30 degree with respect to the center 
column. With these parameters, the dual beam patterns can be 
maintained over a relatively broad frequency bandwidth. Fig. 5 
shows a simulated 65˚ full coverage beam pattern and three 
independent narrow beams at 2200 MHz. For these analyses, 
the angle (α) is set at 20 degree. The half-power-beamwidth 
(HPBW) of each individual narrow beam is approximately 33 
degree, which provides combined azimuth coverage of 65 
degree for a typical cell sector.  
 
For some applications, it is possible that signals are 
transmitted at one polarization using the broad beam pattern 
(65 degree), while the receive signals at other polarization 
using the two narrow beams. For other applications, both 
transmit and receive signals operate using the dual beams. A 
narrow center beam can also be formed if necessary. 
Combinations of these can be formed depending on the 
application.

With the displacement distance of the center column set at 
D=0mm (reflector surface of the center column levels with the 
top edges of the two edge columns), the three narrow beams 
and the 65˚ broad beam pattern can be formed using the 
amplitude and phase excitations given in Table 2.

∆φ represents an additional phase adjustment, which can be 
introduced into the excitation by the addition of a fixed line 
length on the feed line, or varying the relative displacement 
distance of the center column, D. This adjustable phase allows 
further optimization of beam parameters such as the beam 
cross-over losses and pattern discrimination.  
IV. BEAM FORMING CIRCUIT 
Fig. 6 shows the amplitude and phase excitations of the 3-to-2 
beam forming network for the dual beam patterns. Fig. 7 and 8

the compact dual beam former using micorstrip transmission 
line method.

 Fig. 7. Equivalent excitation signal diagram of the dual beam former 
The proposed 3-to-2 beam former is implemented using two 
unequally-split 180deg splitters and two in-phase Wilkinson 
combiners. This simple implementation has an added 
advantage of excellent isolations between antenna ports as 
shown in Fig. 9, simulated using Agilent ADS. These are 
inherent merits from port cancellation at the sum and 
difference ports of the 180 degree splitters.  
 
Another significant advantage of this implementation is the 
low beam-split signal losses. Each of the dual beams are 
formed using a 180 degree splitter (10 dB) on the 
corresponding edge column and a 3dB (0 deg) splitter on the 
center column. The total signal loss due to the beam split is 
less than 0.5 dB in comparison to the single beam case (center 
33˚), which has an excitation taper of (0.5, 1.0, 0.5). This is a 
direct result of the optimum phase and amplitude tapers from 
the array configuration. Furthermore, the path loss is also 
minimized because of the compact circuit design.

V. APERTURE-COUPLED PATCH (ACP)  
One of the critical elements of this development is the dual-
polarized radiators with relatively broad beamwidth over a 
large operating frequency. For optimum array performance, it 
is desirable that the azimuth pattern of the radiator can be 
adjusted to allow optimization of the azimuth beam pattern, 
port isolations, and the overall directivity of the array.  
 
Use of metallic boundaries in the near-field enables 
broadening of HPBW of a patch antenna up to approximately 
90 deg at the expense of the overall frequency bandwidth. The 
proposed method of dielectric fortification [5] between the 
radiator and the metallic boundaries provides a systematic 
means for significant broadening of HPBW over a large 
frequency bandwidth. Subsequently, this method allows 
optimization of array performance by selecting appropriate 
thickness or height of the dielectric material. The dielectric 
loading in this manner does not seem to degrade performance 
in the cross polarization pattern as long as the dielectric 
loading is symmetrical in all four directions.  
 
Fig. 10 shows the isometric and cross-sectional views of a 
dielectric fortified stacked patch. In this case, the aperture-
coupled stacked patch is dual linearly polarized. Two radiating 
patches are fed by a pair of orthogonal cross slots on the 
bottom ground. The radiating patches are centered in a square 
area with a perimeter formed by four dielectric walls with the 
outside dimension of approximately half-wave length. The 
outside surfaces of the dielectric walls can be backed by 
electrically conductive walls. This arrangement allows a 
compact construction of the patches. The top radiating patch 
can be conveniently flash-mounted on top of the dielectric 
walls, while the lower radiating patch are secured at a 
predetermined height from the ground via small recessed 
grooves cut onto the inside surfaces of the dielectric walls.    
 
The electrically conductive layer may be of the equal height as 
the dielectric walls, or preferably recessed from the top of the 
dielectric walls for better frequency bandwidth. For a given 
dielectric material with a fixed height, the HPBW is directly 
proportional to the thickness of the dielectric walls.  
 
A fullwave FEM model of a dual-polarized aperture-coupled 
stacked patch with dielectric fortification is simulated using 
the Ansoft HFSS. For the purposes of these demonstrations, 
FR-4 (εr=4.6) is assumed for dielectric material. The height of 
dielectric walls is fixed at 20mm and the height of the metallic 
boundaries is kept at 14mm. Fig. 11 shows the simulated 
azimuth HPBW for various thicknesses of dielectric walls. As 
indicated in the figure, the HPBW is varying from 70 degree 
to 125 degree for value of the dielectric thickness between 0 
mm and 7.5mm.

VI. EM SIMULATIONS 
A 4-element sub-array model of the three-column array is 
simulated using the Ansoft 3D full-wave Finite Element 
Method (FEM) HFSS. For these analyses, the subtend angle is 
set to 20 degree. Fig. 12 and 13 show the simulated azimuth 
patterns at 1700 MHz and 2200 MHz with the displacement 
distance (D) set at 0mm.

              Fig. 13. Simulated dual beam patterns at 2200 MHz 
 
At this setting, the beam cross-over loss at azimuth=0 deg is 
between 3.5dB@1700 MHz to 3.7dB@2200 MHz (D =0mm). 
These beam patterns and the cross-over losses can be varied 
by introducing an additional phase offset between the center 
column and the two edge columns using the adjustable 
displacement feature of the array. Fig 14 shows comparisons 
of the dual beam patterns for the displacement distance at 
various positions: -5mm, 0mm, and +15mm.  
 
When displacement distance (D) is between -5mm and 
+15mm, the beam cross-over loss is varying between -1.6dB 
to -4.9 dB. The lowest beam cross-over loss is -1.6 dB when 
the displacement distance is at D=-10mm. This low cross-over 
loss, however, comes at the expense of pattern discrimination 
performance (4dB at beam peak).

On the other hand, at D=+15mm, the dual beams has an 
optimum pattern discrimination of over 24dB at the expense of 
the beam cross-over loss of -4.9dB. Table 3 summarizes the 
dual beam performances for various displacement distance D.

 These results clearly demonstrated the advantage of the 
variable displacement of the center column, which allows 
optimization of performance between hand-over loss (cross-
over loss) and interference discrimination. 
VII. MEASURED RESULTS 
Fig. 15 show the prototype of the dual-beam array constructed 
based on the principle of the three-column variable beamwidth 
array presented in the previous sections. A total of five 3x2 
microstrip BFNs are used to feed the 30-element array. Two   
1-to-5 elevation power combiner & phase shifter (RET) are 
used to distribute the BFN Outputs of the left (L) and right (R) 
beams. This allows separate beam tilt of the R and the L 
beams in elevation plane between 0 and 7 degree.

two RET settings (0 deg tilt and 7 deg tilt).

setting, the measured HPBW is between 32deg to 39deg with 
cross-over loss between -3.5dB to -3.9dB. The array produces 
very low cross-polar field components at well below -20 dB. 
Fig. 18 shows the measured azimuth beam patterns of the 
DBA when the RET remains set at 0 deg but the center 
displacement D is moved to -5mm. The HPBW is reduced 
very slightly, but the cross-over loss is increased to between    
-4.0dB to -4.4dB. Fig. 19 gives the measured patterns when 
the displacement is set to 0mm. The HPBW is reduced to 
between 31 deg and 37 deg, while the cross-over loss is 
approximately -4.9dB for all frequencies. As shown in Fig. 20, 
as the displacement is moved up to +10mm, the HPBW is 
increased to over 36deg and the cross over loss is over 5.9dB.  
 
Fig. 21 to 23 show the azimuth patterns of the DBA when the 
RET is set to 7 deg. These results are similar to the previous 
when RET is set to 0deg. However, the cross-over losses are 
generally lower. For instance, the cross-over loss is reduced to 
-2.3 dB when the displacement D=-10mm. This is significantly 
lower than the previous case. However, this comes at the price 
of lower beam discrimination.   
 
Fig. 24 gives the measured elevation patterns of the array at 
1710MHz and 2150MHz when RET=0deg, for various 
displacement D. Similarly, Fig. 23 gives the elevation patterns 
for RET=7deg. Apparently, the offset distance (D) does not 
seem to affect the beam patterns in the elevation plane 
significantly. However, SLLs tend to increase as the offset 
distance decreases.

VIII. DISCUSSION AND RESULTS COMPARISONS 
Table 5 summarizes measured antenna parameters of the 
prototype DBA., including: 
1) Cross-over loss 
2) Discrimination at peak 
3) HPBW 
4) Directivity 
Table 6 compares these parameters at various values of center 
displacement, D. HPBW of the two beams are, in general, 
within 31 deg and 41 deg for D within ±10mm. The measured 
directivities are approximately between 20 to 21dBi, relatively 
independent of the displacement D. The cross-over loss varies 
significantly as the center displacement changes. When D is 
set to -10mm, the cross-over loss is reduced to -2.3 dB for 
RET=7deg and -3.5dB when RET=7deg. However, at the 
same time, the pattern discrimination is also reduced to 
between 6 to 9dB. The pattern discrimination is improved as

                 Fig.24(b) Measured EL Pattern (7deg Tilt, 2150MHz) 
 
the center displacement increases. When D=+10mm, the 
pattern discrimination is over 13 dB, but the cross-over loss is 
over 4.7 dB.      
 
The HPBW of the elevation patterns are generally between     
6 to 8 deg. A maximum elevation tilt of 7 deg is feasible using 
the current Powerwave RET phase shifter. Measured elevation 
patterns at 7deg tilt indicate a slightly higher SLL, above 
16dB. Fig. 24 and 25 compare HFSS simulations and 
measured patterns (1700 MHz and 2200 MHz) in the azimuth 
plane for D=0.0mm and -5.0mm. These results show very 
good correlations between the simulations and measured 
results. However, the HPBW is somewhat better correlated 
when the displacement D is above 0 mm and the cross-over 
loss is better predicted when D is below 0mm. Nevertheless, 
measured patterns and the HFSS simulated results compare 
relatively well.

IX. CONCLUSION 
 
Concept of an adjustable dual beam array for cell site 
enhancement of wireless base station is presented. This 
method allows for an increase in network capacity through 
higher order sectorization. The concept is realized using an 
adjustable three-column array and a compact, low-loss beam 
former. This structure produces two symmetrical narrow 
beams with respect to the azimuth boresight within a cellular 
sector. Radiation patterns of the two beams are adjustable for 
optimization of coverage of a cellular sector to minimize 
beam-split loss, or to optimize pattern discrimination and 
HPBW performance.  
 
The array is capable of delivering more than two beams using 
a suitable BFN circuit. Theoretically, the device is capable of 
producing a broad beam for the full azimuth coverage and 
three narrow beams, simultaneously. It is therefore feasible for 
the array to transmit signal at one polarization using the broad 
beam pattern (65 degree), while receive signals at other 
polarization using the two narrow beams for diversity. For 
other applications, the dual beam can be used to transmit and 
to receive simultaneously. The issue with cross-over loss 
between beams can also be eliminated using three narrow 
beams, if required. This method allows an effective increase in 
the overall network capacity as a result of low-loss and narrow 
beam patterns.  
 
A full array prototype was built and radiation patterns are also 
presented. The measured results are well correlated with the 
EM simulated results. 
 
The adjustable DBA and the associated BFN technology under 
this development are patent pending (Application #12/252,334 
and #12/175,725) and are strictly proprietary to Powerwave 
Technologies.
