Abstract— In this paper, we briefly present a subjective 
experimental validation of the bicycle simulator. In the first 
part, we present the different physical features of the simulator 
developed at The Perceptions, Interactions, Behaviors & 
Simulations Lab for road and street users (PICS-L). In the 
second part, we present the results of an experiment with 10 
participants in order to verify the liability of the simulator. For 
future work, the authors will deploy the simulator in behavioral 
studies and compare the outputs with experimentation in real 
environment seeking for the behavioral validity of the 
simulator. 
Keywords- Bicycle Simulator; Simulation; Subjective Validity.

INTRODUCTION 
This article is ongoing study started in [1] aiming at 
improving the dynamics of the bicycle model and simulations 
to deploy it in future studies on cyclists’ behavior and their 
interaction with different road features in a safe and 
controllable environment. While our previous work focused 
on the dynamical modeling of the bicycle simulator, we focus 
here on the subjective validity of the simulator. 
Studying road-user behavior through simulations is a 
promising tool to address challenges, such as: learning to 
drive, awareness of risks, road safety, etc. Different simulators 
have been developed over the past three decades with different 
focuses and goals [2]-[4]. We can categorize them into: 
motionless simulators and mobile-based simulators [5]. The 
first are built around a screen providing visual feedback as in 
[7], while the latter combines visual information and indices 
of movements consistent with those of a real vehicle as in [8]-
[10]. It has been recognized that often a mobile platform, if 
well controlled, can significantly improve the realism of the 
simulation of conduct. 
The PICS-L lab at Université Gustave Eiffel designs and 
develops simulators of conduct to study the behavior of 
drivers and vulnerable users (cyclists and pedestrians) in 
different situations, interactions with other users, and 
information-gathering strategies, in order to better understand 
the users’ immersion in a virtual reality environment [7].  
The intermediate complexity and level of realism of the 
PICS-L bicycle simulator is ensured through several features 
on the base and background platform, movement control and 
through numerous sensory information and measurements. 
These features aim at allowing the cyclists natural behavior, 
such as: movements, interactions, integrated sound and visual 
effects similar to the real environment. This equips the 
simulator for studying cyclists’ interactions with other users, 
road improvements and driving aids. This allows the 
assessment of the cyclists’ subjective risk, perception of and 
reaction to the infrastructural environment and other road 
users, as well as anticipation and decision-making. It is 
noteworthy to state that aspects of balance management and 
shock situations had been excluded, therefore deferring the 
study of situations including loss of control and shock, as well 
as high dynamic demands.  
By considering the cyclist as a control system, we could 
better understand driver behavior and improve the modeling 
quality of the bicycle and its simulator. In the following, we 
will focus on the subjective aspects of the bicycle simulator 
through analyzing different questionnaires. The design of the 
experiment aims to verify the reliability of the bicycle 
simulator to validate the model for future experiments. The 
paper is organized as following. Section 2 is devoted to 
present the bicycle modeling. In Section 3, experimentation 
environment and scenarios are detailed, and the results are 
presented in the Section 4.

BICYCLE MODELING 
          The bicycle dynamic model was created in MATLAB-
Simulink, it shows the relations between the different parts of 
the bicycle model in a graphical format. This allows to 
graphically trace the various inputs and visualize their relation 
in MATLAB script format. The model has different sub-layers 
showing the relative outputs of the different parts. Fig. 1 
presents the input /outputs of the Simulink model [1], which 
was used in the analysis following the simulation. 
Eq. (1) was implemented to estimate the friction force: 
𝑚.
𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑡 = 𝐹𝐹 + 𝐹𝑎 + 𝐹𝑐 + 𝐹𝐵 + 𝐹𝑔                (1) 
where m is the total mass of the bicycle-rider system in kg, 
𝑑𝑣
𝑑𝑡  
is the longitudinal acceleration as a function of the speed in 
𝑚/𝑠2 (the speed was measured using an incremental encoder 
attached to the rear wheel of the simulator), 𝐹𝐹 is the friction 
force to be calculated, Fc is the force applied by the cyclist on

the pedals which is measured using a pedal power meter, Fb 
is the breaking force and Fg is the gravity force caused by the 
slopes, Fa is the aerodynamic resistance calculated on the 
basis of the following equation:

with Cax, the coefficient of aerodynamic resistance given by 
the bicycle manufacturer, 𝜌 the air density in 𝑘𝑔/𝑚3and S 
the frontal surface of the bicycle and the rider body in 𝑚2.  
III. 
EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT 
A. Experimental Setup 
The Bicycle Simulator at PICS-L (UGE) with the primary 
aim to study the bicycle control in virtual environments, was 
designed by placing a real bicycle on a fixed platform.  
The speed of the rear wheel, the angular position of the 
handlebar, and the gear were measured and logged. A force 
feedback was applied to the rear wheel using a cylinder in 
contact with the wheel. The system was composed of a 10N 
constant part to simulate the dry friction, a variable part to 
simulate the dynamic friction in proportion to the speed and a 
variable part proportional to the acceleration to simulate the 
inertia.  
In order to provide more realistic conditions, a fan has 
been placed in front of the bicycle simulating the wind. The 
air flow speed was controlled during the simulation as a 
function of the wheel's speed. The simulated environment 
consisted of a straight road. Five projectors were fixed in front 
and beside the cyclist to provide a visual cue with 225° of 
horizontal and 55° of vertical field of view. A rear screen was 
placed behind the bicycle to allow a rear-view if the cyclist 
needs to turn around. The audio cue is simulated by software 
with the use of an audio system consisting of four speakers 
and a subwoofer reproducing the sound of the rolling tires 
(using speed), wind (using speed) and traffic. The simulator is 
equipped with gear, clutch and braking pedals. Fig. 2 shows 
the different features of the bicycle simulator.  
B. Participants 
      Ten subjects (6 male; mean age=28.17, SD=3.76 and 4 
females; mean age=25.25, SD=2.06) participated in this 
experiment. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. 
The mean cycling experience of the participants was 12.9 
years. The average number of cycling kilometers per month 
was 62.   
 
C. Scenario 
The experiment took place in a simulated urban 
environment. The road consisted of two straight sections: the 
first was a bicycle-bus shared lane, the latter a separate bicycle 
lane. Traffic was generated in the same and opposite direction 
of the cyclist and buses were passing the cyclist from time to 
time. The participants were asked to take a pre-ride in order to 
familiarize themselves with the simulator. They were asked to 
maneuver with the simulator and use the different features, 
such as: handlebar, pedals, gear and brakes. Following the pre-
ride, the participants were asked to go for a ride on the bicycle 
simulator along the virtual street. 
The duration of the experiment was around 10 minutes, 
which we considered long enough to test all the features of the 
simulator, collect enough date for post-analysis and not 
exhausting for the participants. The results of the simulation 
are used to validate the theoretical and the physical model of 
the bicycle simulator. 
At the end of the experiment, the participants filled three 
questionnaires. The first questionnaire consisted of general 
information and cycling experience of the participants in real 
life and using the simulator, followed by the Simulator 
Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) [12]; the participants evaluated 
their experience, through 16 questions, indicating on a scale 
of four steps (None, Slight, Moderate and Severe) the 
occurrence of different symptoms during the experiment. The 
third questionnaire, NASA Task Load Index (TLX) [13], was 
aimed at evaluating the overall workload of the cycling task, 
and the importance of each of the 6 work-load-factors under 
investigation. The questionnaires were available both in 
English and French as some participants speak only French.

D. Simulation  outputs 
Fig. 3 shows the speed profile of the bicycle simulator for one 
of the subjects measured through the incremental encoder 
attached to the rear wheel of the simulator. We could notice 
the acceleration and breaking phases at the beginning and end 
of the experiment.  
 
 
The steering angle of the bicycle simulator handlebar, 
shown in Fig. 4, is measured using an incremental encoder. It 
is noticed that the steering angle ranges between +\- 4, which 
is relatively small. This could be explained due to the 
straightness of the virtual road as noticed in the trajectories 
and global position (Fig. 5 and 6).

IV. 
SUBJETIVE VALIDITY  RESULTS 
A. Cycling Experience Questionaire 
The results of the first questionnaire are summarized in 
Appendix 1. As noticed in the last column, the average 
evaluation of the similarity to cycling in real environment 
ranges between 4 and 8 on scale of 10 (mean= 6.1, SD= 1,6). 
Assessing the realism of the simulator, participants mentioned 
the good design of the virtual road, pedaling, traffic and other 
sensory ques, such as the wind and the sound of the passing 
traffic. As suggestions for improvement, most participants 
agreed they expect higher speed compared to the cycling 
effort.  
 
B. Simulator Sickness Questionaire (SSQ) 
The analysis of the simulator sickness questionnaire listed 
in Table 1 shows that the average total severity of all 
participants is around 32.5. By comparing this number to the 
possible scores listed in Table 2, we could see that the total 
severity of the simulator is slight (less than 78.5). It is also 
noticed that participants wearing lenses experienced the 
highest total severity (participant #6 has 115.9 and participant 
#10 has 71). The affected participants showed high 
disorientation symptoms.

C. NASA Task Load Index (TLX) 
The Nasa Task Load index is used to collect subjective 
workload assessments for different simulators [13]. Table 3 
shows the weighted ratings of the NASA TLX. The first 
column shows the scales under assessment, the second 
represents the average weight of each scale according to the 
personal opinion of the participant. The scorer chooses 
different factors on an evaluation cards according to its 
importance, while the weight of each factor is the number of 
times it was circled. The third column is the average raw rating 
taken from the TLX questionnaire, where the participants 
evaluated each factor on a scale of 100. The last column 
represents the adjusted weighting, which is the multiplication 
of the weight and raw rating of each factor. It is noticed that 
the physical demand was highly weighted affecting the overall 
work load (87.4 on a scale of 100), while the raw rating shows 
a moderate overall workload.

Fig. 9 shows the weighted average of each work load 
factor; the width of each column represents the weight of each 
factor. We notice the performance was weighted the least, this 
could be explained because the required task was simple and 
easy to accomplish, so the participant chose not to give it a 
high raring.

V. 
CONCLUSION  AND FUTURE WORK 
The bicycle simulator enables us to put cyclists in a riding 
situation and accurately measure their effective behavior, 
while controlling the variables at play and avoiding the risks 
associated with a real environment. 
After analyzing the different questionnaires, it is possible 
to verify the reliability and to subjectively validate the 
simulator. The results show low simulator sickness and 
relatively high workload, which could be explained by the 
effort done by the cyclist.  
Further development was applied to the simulator 
including mathematical model improvements, development of 
the virtual environment and installment of new devices to 
simulate the interaction between the infrastructure and the 
bicycle. An additional experiment, including 36 subjects, was 
conducted in order to validate the new model physically and 
subjectively. The results of the new experiment will be 
published in an upcoming paper.
