Abstract—The myIdP service is an extension to the Swiss eID
infrastructure with the aim to provide a service that handles
personal attributes (like address, telephone number, email), which
are neither part of the SuisseID identity providers nor of a Claim
Assertion Services (CAS) because there is no ofﬁcial authority
owning and certifying these data. The myIdP service is a (pseudo-
)local CAS that can reuse data, which a user has already given
to an application via an Internet transaction. The data is thus
validated by the web application before being transferred - as
SAML 2.0 attribute assertion - to the myIdP service. The myIdP
service comes in two ﬂavors with different trust relations: the
attribute provider and the claim proxy. The attribute provider
unites several claims for a given attribute and provides an
optional quality assessment before sending it to a requesting web
application. A trust relationship must consist between myIdP and
the web application. The claim proxy only collects the received
claims for a given attribute and transfers them with all details
to the requesting application. The application can evaluate the
conﬁdence in the data based on the claim details. The myIdP
service is evaluated in a scenario of preﬁlling e-forms in a
eGovernment application.

INTRODUCTION
Like in many European countries, also in Switzerland
an infrastructure for electronic proof of identities (eID) was
developed and introduced in 2010 as SuisseID Infrastructure.
The basis is the SuisseID [1] available as USB stick or
chip card containing two digital certiﬁcates: (1) the SuisseID
identiﬁcation and authentication certiﬁcate (IAC) and (2) the
SuisseID qualiﬁed digital certiﬁcate (QC). The SuisseID IAC
can be used to identify the owner in Internet transactions. The
SuisseID QC can be used to sign electronic documents in a
forgery-proof manner. The SuisseIDs are issued by identity
providers (IdP). In contrary to other European countries, where
electronic identities are issued by the government together
with ofﬂine identiﬁcation (ID card), there are actual three
commercial and one governmental SuisseID IdP.
The SuisseID itself and its certiﬁcates contain only a mini-
mum of personal data (SuisseID number, name or pseudonym
and optional email address) due to stringent privacy and data
protection requirements in Switzerland. Additionally, a subset
of the personal data from the identiﬁcation document (e.g., a
passport) and a well-known set of additional attributes gathered
during the registration process (so called Registration process
data, RPD) are stored in the identity provider service (extended
IdP). The only way to retrieve this data is by strong authentica-
tion with the IdP service using the appropriate SuisseID IAC.
The SuisseID Infrastructure is completed with a set of Claim
Assertion Services (CAS) [2]. The purpose of a CAS is to
provide and certify speciﬁc properties or attributes, which had
been assigned to the SuisseID owner by some private or public
authority. Examples are the membership of an organization or
a company, and the proof of professional qualiﬁcations, like a
notary or a doctor. Especially in the context of eGovernment,
there is a need for an extension of the beforehand described
SuisseID Infrastructure.
Many more personal attributes (like invoice address, tele-
phone number, email) used in web applications, e.g., online
shops, or in electronic forms often used in the eGovernment,
are neither subject of the SuisseID IdPs nor the CAS because
there is no ofﬁcial authority owning and certifying these
data. The myIdP service ﬁlls that gap and allows storing and
maintaining personal attributes for a SuisseID owner. The idea
is to store information, which was at least entered (and thus
used) once in a web application, for later reuse. The data is
used and thus validated by the web application before being
transferred as SAML attribute statement [3] (the so-called
attribute claim) to the myIdP service. From now on, the user
can reuse the attribute for other applications, which improves
usability and reduces the error potential in the daily internet
transactions.
The paper starts with the related work in Section II, before
outlining the architecture and ﬂavors of myIdP in Section
III. In Section V, the integration of myIdP in a scenario
of preﬁlling e-forms is shown. Section VI concludes the
document.
II.
RELATED WORK
A service like myIdP or a SuisseID CAS corresponds
technically to an Attribute Authority deﬁned by SAML [3]: An
Attribute Authority is a system entity that produces attribute
assertions.[4]
In general, most of the known SAML Identity Providers
(IdPs) can act as an Attribute Authority and issue attribute
assertions beside their usual authentication functionality. Ex-
amples are the government-issued electronic identities of the
European Countries, like the German Identity Card [5], the
beID from Belgium [6] or the Citizens Card from Austria [7].
Similar to the SuisseID, all these government-issued eIDs
provide only a small number of personal attributes related to
the identity document they belong to.
The national electronic identities of the European member
states are made interoperable with the STORK European eID
Interoperability Platform [8]. With six pilots, the STORK
project offers several cross-border eGovernment identity ser-
vices. In the follow-up project STORK2.0 [9] also personal
attributes related to eIDs are subject of investigation. E.g.,
1

SERVICE COMPUTATION 2013 : The Fifth International Conferences on Advanced Service Computing

in the banking pilot, public and private identity and attribute
providers are included in the process of ”Opening a bank
account” in a foreign country online with a national eID
without physical presence. myIdP could be used in this con-
text as attribute provider for personal attributes, like address,
telephone number, email, etc.
In contrast to the central, government-regulated eID ser-
vices, OpenID [10] is a decentral authentiﬁcation service
for web based services. The user is free to choose his
favorite OpenID identity provider to get a OpenID, which
is an URL or XRI including an end-user chosen name
(e.g., alice.openid.example.org). OpenID providers are, e.g.,
Clavid [11] , CloudID [12], Google [13] etc. The OpenID
providers themselves can support different authentiﬁcation
methods. For example, Clavid offers username/password, one
time passwords, SuisseID authentication and the biometric
AXSionics Internet Passport.
User attributes, like name, gender or favorite movies, can
be also transferred from the OpenID identity providers to
the relying party following the OpenID Attribute Exchange
Speciﬁcation [14]. The attributes can be (almost) freely deﬁned
according to the requirements of the relying party. As many
OpenID providers do not validate the information entered
by the users, the provided attributes have a low level of
assurance. There is a need for a validation by a trusted 3rd
party, a so called attribute provider (AP). Google started the
Open Attribute Exchange Network (Open AXN, also known
as ”street identity”, see [15]) to include validated information
from APs. myIdP has the potential to act as an OpenID
attribute provider, but is currently only enabled for use together
with the SuisseID.
WebIDs [16] are especially common in social media (Face-
Book, LinkedIn . . . ) to allow users to identify themselves in
order to publish information. Each user can make his own
WebID or rely on an identity provider. The WebID is a URL
with a #tag pointing to a foaf ﬁle [17] containing a cross-
link to a (self-generated) certiﬁcate. Information that should
be included but are not required to be present in a WebID
Proﬁle are the name (foaf:name) of the individual or agent,
the email address associated (foaf:mbox) and the agent’s image
(foaf:depiction). More attributes and links to all kind of web
objects (other persons, groups, publications, account, ...) can
be also included. WebIDs can be connected to OpenIDs and
vice versa.
III.
ARCHITECTURE
myIdP consists of four components (see orange boxes in
Figure 1): the myIdP Service, the myIdP WebApp, the myIdP
Admin and the myIdP API.
The myIdP Service is an attribute authority according to
the SAML 2.0 [3] standard distributing assertions in response
to identity attribute queries from an entity acting as an attribute
requester. Like a typical SuisseID CAS [2], the myIdP service
let the users select and conﬁrm the properties, which were
formerly received from an attribute issuer and are stored in
the myIdP database.
New, to the concept of CAS, is the provisioning of a quality
(level of assurance, level of conﬁdence) together within the
Figure 1.
myIdP components and service provider roles
attribute assertions. myIdP integrates a quality module, that
calculates the trustworthiness of the provided information on
the basis of the ages, number of afﬁrmations and quality of
the issuer of the received and stored attribute assertions. This
assurance level or quality can be used by an attribute requester
to insist on a certain level of assurance for the requested
attributes. The calculation of the assurance level or quality
is a research topic on its own and therefore not included in
this paper. A possible approach is shown in [18].
The myIdP WebApp is the end user front-end of myIdP
where users – after the successful authentication with their
SuisseID IAC – can view and manage their attributes. At-
tributes can not be entered directly in the myIdP WebApp,
except the master data related to the myIdP account. Attributes
always come from a service provider, e.g., a web application,
acting as attribute issuer, which forwards – after conﬁrmation
by the user – the attribute assertions to myIdP. The attributes
then arrive in the so-called Inbox (see Figure 2) where they
can be detailed viewed and manually activated before they
are exposed via the myIdP service. Corresponding to the user
centric approach of the SuisseID, the users are always in
control of their data and can activate/deactivate and delete
attributes at any time. As a side effect, the user gets an usage
history of his attributes in the web.
The myIdP Admin is an administration tool for myIdP.
It supports the maintenance of attribute deﬁnitions and the
registration process of service providers, which is needed
to set up secure connections and trust relationships. New
attributes can be enabled for usages simply by importing the
related XML Schemata or by the use of the SAML Metadata
Exchange [19].
The myIdP API provides an interface to the central
database used commonly by the other three myIdP compo-
nents.
A service provider can interact with myIdP incorporating
two roles (see the blue boxes in Figure 1):
•
Attribute Requester: The service provider electroni-
cally sends an attribute query to the myIdP service in
order to draw a conﬁrmation statement - a SAML 2.0
attribute assertion - from the myIdP service and uses
it in further actions, e.g., preﬁlling of web forms.
•
Attribute Issuer: The service provider sends SAML

2.0 attribute statements to myIdP. (Despite the pos-
sibility to group several attributes in one SAML
statement, myIdP prefers single attribute statements,
in order to expose a minimum of information in the
claim proxy case.) The attribute values where entered
either manually by the users or requested beforehand
from the myIdP service.
A special attribute provider is the myIdP WebApp,
which uses the master data (address, email) entered
during the myIdP registration process, to provide the
ﬁrst attribute statements to the users.
The myIdP service is available in two ﬂavors: the Attribute
Provider and the Claim Proxy.
The attribute provider summarizes the in the myIdP
database available attribute assertions for the given request. All
details about the original attribute provider of the information
are hidden. After the user has selected and conﬁrmed the
attribute values, the newly built attribute assertion is signed
by the myIdP service. When requested, an assurance level is
included in this assertion. For this myIdP ﬂavor, a direct trust
relationship is established between the myIdP service and the
web application in the attribute requester role.
This is different in the second myIdP ﬂavor. The claim
proxy extracts the stored attribute assertions from the myIdP
database for a given attribute request. After the selection of
attribute values and the explicit conﬁrmation by the user,
an attribute assertion containing an URI and optional the
assurance level is returned to the requesting web application.
This attribute request is also signed by myIdP but only to
ensure integrity. The web application can use the URI from
the attribute assertion to assess the originally received attribute
assertions enveloped in an XML document. The web appli-
cation can now access all details of the original assertions,
including the issuers and timestamps, and perform its own
<complexType name="AttributeType">

<element ref="saml:AttributeValue"
minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
</sequence>

processContents="lax" />
</complexType>

quality assessment. The trust relationship has changed: the web
application trusts directly the attribute issuers.
In order to support the provision of a quality assessment
of an attribute value and of the claim list URI, the SAML
attribute assertions was extended (see the XSD fragment shown
in Figure 3).
IV.
PRIVACY
One important characteristic of myIdP (valid for both
ﬂavors) is the user-centric approach. The user is always aware
which information is exchanged and has explicitly to conﬁrm
every single attribute, which is sent out by myIdP.

Sequence diagram ”Get e-form”
myIdP implements multiple measures to ensure the privacy
of the user: First, every Attribute Issuer has to get an user
consent before sending any attribute statement to myIdP.
Secondly, in myIdP the arriving attributes are deactivated by
default. The user has explicitly to conﬁrm if he wants to
activate these attributes for further use. At any time, the user
is free to delete attribute statements in the myIdP WebApp
or to deactivate them. Thirdly, the user is involved in every
message exchange with an Attribute Requester and has to
conﬁrm all attribute values. In the claim proxy case, he has
also to conﬁrm the disclosure of original attribute assertions.
The attribute assertions contain information about visited web
sites and could be used to track the user and to create user
proﬁles. In any case, myIdP only sends attribute statements to
Attribute Requesters only if there is a valid authentication with
a SuisseID in addition to the user consent. These procedures
ensures that the user exposes only the data he wants to use
and protects his privacys.
V.
APPLICATION SCENARIO
A scenario of completing electronic forms (e-forms) vali-
dates our approach. E-forms are commonly used in the Swiss
eGovernment. With the help of the SuisseID, the citizen can
be securely identiﬁed and the attributes stored in the core
SuisseID components, like name, birthday, place of birth or
nationality, can be used to preﬁll the e-forms. As the number
of attributes available in the core SuisseID is quite limited, we
want to use myIdP to provide additional values for the e-forms.
For our proof of concept, we chose the form ”Proof of
residence”, which had already an integration with the core
SuisseID infrastructure. In Figure 4, the interactions between
the user, the e-form provider, the core SuisseID components
and myIdP are depicted:
1)
Service Request: the user requests an e-form from the
e-form provider (e.g., by clicking on a link).
2)
Authentication with SuisseID: the e-form provider
issues an authentication and attribute request to the
SuisseID IdP/CAS service. The following attributes
are requested: name, ﬁrst name and birthday.
Figure 5.
Sequence diagram ”Save e-form”
3)
Conﬁrmation request: the user has to identify himself
by entering his secret key (PIN) and in a second step
to conﬁrm his SuisseID attributes.
4)
Conﬁrmation response: the user’s decisions are sent
back to the SuisseID IdP/CAS.
5)
Authentication and Attribute response: the SuisseID
IdP/CAS sends a combined authentication and at-
tribute assertion back to the e-form provider.
6)
myIdP attribute request: the e-form provider issues
an attribute request to the myIdP service asking for
the address and the email.
7)
Conﬁrmation request: the user has to select the at-
tribute values in case several emails or addresses are
stored in myIdP and to conﬁrm the selection.
8)
Conﬁrmation response: the user’s decisions are sent
back to myIdP.
9)
Attribute response: myIdP sends an attribute assertion
back to the e-form provider.
10)
Service: the e-form is displayed to the user and
contains the selected and conﬁrmed values from the
SuisseID IdP/CAS and myIdP.
The user has now to complete the form and to enter the
number of copies he wants to receive. In case, his email
or home address has changed, he can also manually correct
the data on the e-form (the data from the SuisseID IdP/CAS
are read-only and can not be changed). When he saves the
document the governmental process of providing the requested
documents is started. But, the conﬁrmed data from the e-form
are also transferred – as new attribute assertions containing
validated information – to myIdP (see Figure 5).
A crucial point to use myIdP in eGovernment applications
and also in other domains is the selection and standardization
of attributes. In our scenario, we could reuse attributes deﬁned
and published as Swiss standards, e.g., the eCH-0010 [20] for
the address and eCH-0042 [21] for the email.
VI.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
myIdP is an extension to the SuisseID infrastructure. It pro-
poses a Claim Assertion Service (SAML attribute authority),
4

which handles personal data used and validated beforehand
in other internet transactions. The concept is extensible to
other eID solutions and can be also integrated in the STORK
European eID Interoperability Platform. In a next step, the
possibility to use myIdP as OpenID attribute provider will
be investigated. Also the combination with a WebID seems
feasible.
The myIdP concept was validated with a prototypical
implementation following the proposed architecture. The im-
plementation on the basis of the SuisseID SDK[22] showed
quickly some limitations, especially related to a ﬂexible at-
tribute set and structured attributes, like address.
As proof-of-concept, the prototype was integrated in an
eGovernment scenario of preﬁlling an e-form in order to
obtain a proof of residence. The integration of more e-forms
is planned. As precondition the set of myIdP attributes has to
be extended to have a standardized basis for the information
exchange.
The promoting of the myIdP service showed that many
applications are willing to act as Attribute Requester and to use
the personal attributes available in myIdP. The functionality to
act as Claim Provider and to provide validated information to
myIdP and to conﬁrm the reuse is often seen as burden. But,
both roles have to be equally provided to create a network of
validated personal attributes.
Soon as more service providers will use myIdP and provide
attribute claims, the model to calculate the assurance level can
be validated on a real data basis and be further improved.
To strengthen even more the user-centric approach and to
protect the private attribute, the central storage of claims in
the myIdP database could be changed towards a pseudo-local
approach that let the user choose where the store the data: on
his own device or on a central place. The storage of SAML
assertions on the user’s device would also enable the usage
of myIdP - in addition to the normal online scenario - in
environments with limited or no connectivity.
