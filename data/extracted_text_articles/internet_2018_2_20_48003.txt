Abstract—Blockchains
have
recently
emerged
as
an
architectural style to overcome the intrinsic trust problem that
arises when single central authorities are delegated the role to
keep certification information for different parties and actors.
By fueling a host of different cryptocurrencies, various forms
of blockchains are revolutionizing the finance sector. However,
blockchains are rapidly emerging outside of the finance sector,
disrupting the business scenarios. This paper presents a novel
Supply Chain Tracking system that eliminates fraud and
counterfeits from a specific business sector, namely toner
cartridge regeneration, where a recent European directive
(and subsequent national regulations) has posed stringent
limitations.

I.
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, cryptocurrencies have paved the way for
a new architectural model for distributed, decentralized (i.e.,
with no central authority/single point of failure) transactions
based on so-called blockchains.
Due to their nature as a distributed, non-repudiable, non-
centralized ledger, blockchain adoption has now extended
well beyond cryptocurrencies and finance in general [1], and
relevant use cases begin to emerge in disparate business
sectors, specifically where challenging traditional central
“trust” authorities open up new business opportunities [2][3].
Blockchain adoption in contexts other than cryptovalues
is quickly gaining momentum, and may be disruptive both in
technical and in business terms.
Blockchain architectural styles and implementations pose
some stringent limitations as well, and taking them into
account is crucial when planning their adoption in business
contexts other than finance.
This
paper
presents
an
innovative
approach
to
certification and tracking of cartridge regeneration process
and logistics.
A recent European Union (EU) directive called Green
Public Procurement (GPP) [16], and subsequent national
regulations (e.g., the Italian Criteri Minimi Ambientali –
CAM [17]) require Public Administrations to have a relevant
share of the toner cartridges they buy be regenerated and
supplied by certified providers.
However, nowadays toner cartridge regeneration suffers
from a high level of forgery, and the verification of used
toner cartridge life cycle (e.g., whether they have been
refilled from certified partners or not) becomes nearly
impossible.
Some studies report that in the last five years, original
and refilled cartridge market share have both significantly
dropped, in favor of a steady increase of cloned/fake
cartridge (from 1% to 30%).
We partnered with Eco-Recuperi [4] – a major Italian
player in the cartridge regeneration process, and we designed
a Supply Chain Tracking System that eliminates the
possibility to sell counterfeit cartridges as certified, recycled
ones, thanks to the adoption of blockchain as a distributed
notarization system for supply chain certification.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes related work and background knowledge. Section
III details the business scenario and main business/technical
requirements.
Section
IV
addresses
the
process
and
architecture of our solution. Section V concludes this paper
and summarizes our main findings.
II.
BACKGROUND
This section provides some background knowledge about
blockchains, and surveys their benefits, architectural styles
and alternatives, and their growing business adoption in
many business sectors.
A. Blockchain features, benefits, and issues
Blockchain architecture [5] is a network of computing
nodes that share a common state. Blockchain architecture
and protocols are designed so that at any given time, the
majority of nodes should agree on the state of a blockchain
itself.
Changes on the state of a blockchain are recorded as a
series (chain) of transaction groups (block): each transaction
relates to a specific user (identified by a unique identifier),
and a specific point in time (timestamp).
Blockchain typically acts as a generic distributed ledger of
transactions and guarantees some key characteristics that
lend themselves well to our business case.
1)
Non-repudiation: every transaction users register on
the blockchain automatically becomes non-repudiable, e.g.,
once a transaction takes place, the user that actually
performed the transaction will not, in any case, be able to
refute its responsibility about the transaction itself;

2)
Irreversibility: every transaction users register on the
blockchain automatically becomes irreversible, e.g., users
are not allowed to cancel/edit/undo a transaction;
3)
Transaction timestamping: any transaction happens
at a specific point in time, and blockchain records such
instant in a non-modifiable, and always identifiable way;
4)
Censorship resistance: single transactions and the
status of a system as a result of a series of transactions
cannot be denied, and are always publicly available and
verifiable.
The above features make blockchains a distributed ledger
that
notarizes
events,
and
makes
them
universally,
perpetually accessible and non-repudiable.
B. Blockchain architectural styles
Blockchain is neither a specification nor a technology,
and is rather considered a paradigm/architecture style.
The first blockchain specification was the Bitcoin one,
released in 2008 [6] [7]; from then on, many other
blockchain
implementations
have
emerged,
with
very
different characteristics.
The Bitcoin blockchain has been considered the reference
implementation of the blockchain paradigm. The major
capability to implement is to – statistically - solve Byzantine
Generals Problem [8], that is a classic problem faced by any
distributed
system
network.
The
Bitcoin
original
implementation is based on hashcash [9], a proof of work
algorithm. It is a smart approach to reach distributed
consensus, providing a strong protection from brute force
attacks, achieving overall system reliability in the presence
of a number of faulty processes.
A proof of work algorithm has two strong implications: it
needs a high amount of energy to run and it makes it harder
to deliver real-time results, since it is distributed among a
large and ever-increasing number of nodes, and it is based on
computation-intensive random processing. Due to these
limitations, many attempts have been made since Bitcoin
release, to avoid proof of work shortcomings. Those
implications set strong limits on transaction throughput and
significant operational costs of the network. Proposed
solutions focus on performance improvement and cost
decrease:
the
most
significant
changes
focus
on
the
centralization of the transaction validation process and on the
adoption of a consensus algorithm that is not based on the
computational brute force principle.
These ‘improvement solutions’ can be considered as
some sort of relaxation of constraints of the original Bitcoin
blockchain architecture; while those relaxations are not
necessarily a limitation, they should be carefully taken into
account when determining which blockchain style fits
business requirements and context the most.
Categorization [10] can be made in order to simplify
blockchain types understanding:

‘Bitcoin-like’
Blockchains:
blockchains
with
distributed
consensus
algorithm and
history of
transactions persisted in a chain of mathematically
linked
blocks;
those
are
the
blockchains
that
implement the original idea of blockchain as it was
proposed by Bitcoin and their focus is on transaction
history
immutability
and
consistency
over
transaction throughput;

‘Enterprise’
blockchains:
characterized
by
a
centralization of core functionalities like transaction
validation, block creation, and naming service; focus
is
set
on
governance
aspects
such
as
access
regulation and privacy mechanisms;

Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT): state is
shared among nodes of the network, but no chain of
blocks is implemented. Other measures are set in
order to enforce immutability of transactions, but
focus is set on performance in order to reach near-
real time information distribution in the network.
Blockchains - and DLTs - can also be categorized by
governance
model,
i.e.,
the
possibility
to
access
the
blockchain with or without the permission of a remote
account issuing service:

Permission-less: users independently create their
own account using a deterministic process that
ensures the account identifier is globally unique,
enabling them to immediately access the blockchain.
It
is
the
typical
approach
of
‘Bitcoin-like’
blockchains;

Permissioned: users registration has to be approved
by the blockchain centralized service issuer, such as
any traditional Information Technology (IT) service.
C. Blockchain use cases and business opportunities
As
previously
discussed,
the
blockchain
paradigm
addresses the big challenge of securely collecting events in a
distributed
scenario
enhancing
immutability,
transactionality, and near-real time delivery; the following
section describes real world scenarios that take advantage of
the adoption of the blockchain paradigm.
First of all, the use case the whole world knows is the
one the blockchain was born for: exchange of a new digital
currency, both coined and exchanged inside the blockchain.
The birth of the blockchain marks the introduction of a new
type of currency, alongside traditional fiat currencies, where
fiat means the currency has a legal value and is coined by a
proper institutional entity.
Digital currency exchange use case has already many
real-world business case, such as:

Cross border money transfer: near real-time
delivery of transaction in the network allows
worldwide value transfer with significant time
and cost decrease with respect to traditional
processes;

Pseudonymous
[11]
money
transfer:
as
previously said, account creation can be done
autonomously. In addition, account data are
pseudonymous, which means accounts do not
include any personal data. These two features
allow
enhancing
privacy
features
in
value
exchange between users;

INTERNET 2018 : The Tenth International Conference on Evolving Internet


Closed virtual currencies: since the blockchain
enables issuing digital currency autonomously,
organizations can take advantage of this feature
to
replace
-
or
implement
–
closed
loop
exchange of value such as fidelity card for
customer
retention
and
food
stamps
for
employers.
Notarization is a less explored use case for blockchains, and
derives directly from three Bitcoin-like blockchain features,
provided that they come together:

Non-repudiation:
transaction
issuer
cannot
repudiate ownership of his transactions;

Immutability:
transactions
inserted
in
the
blockchain cannot be altered in any way after
being considered validated;

Timestamping: every transaction is timestamped
with the blockchain time once considered valid by
the network.
A blockchain implementing all those three features can be
considered as a notary and transactions made on the
blockchain can be considered as notarized events.
Many business cases and applications can enhance
certification of their processes by enforcing trust using
blockchain as a notary service: tracking processes phases on
the blockchain means they become unmodifiable milestones.
While few real world applications of this use case are already
in production, the great majority are yet to come:

Track phases of clinical trials [12];

Track patents issuing, intellectual property and
copyrights [13];

Track supply chain of goods, such as the cartridge
recycling process phases presented in this paper.
III.
SCENARIO AND REQUIREMENTS
This section describes our scenario and requirements
from both business and technical perspectives.
A. Objectives
The main business goal of this project was to provide a
reliable/verifiable
certification
process
for
cartridges
lifecycle, to limit regeneration frauds. This means being able
to:

track cartridge status change between the various
stages of refill processes (e.g., collect, refill,
package, distribute, sell);

physically tag/associate each cartridge with such
lifecycle information with easily readable, non-
repudiable, and tamper-proof mechanisms;

build a verification infrastructure that lets anyone
publicly verify the status of each cartridge.
The verification infrastructure itself has stringent non-
functional requirements:

reliability
and
trust:
the
infrastructure
should
prevent anyone from introducing fake data to
certify non-recycled cartridges;

simplicity: to ease adoption, especially among
Public Administrations;

cost-effectiveness: physical tags and the associated
verification process should pose a negligible cost
overhead, to avoid posing refilled cartridges out of
market;

accessibility: the verification tools should be easily
accessible, via e.g., Web Applications and Mobile
Applications.
B. Actors and process
The main actors are:

Certification Authority: independent actor that
issues unique identifiers (UIDs) to tag and track
refilled cartridges;

Collector:
economic
subject
that
collects
exhausted toner cartridges and selects them for
regeneration;

Refiller: economic subject that actually refills
exhausted cartridges;

Distributor: economic subject that distributes
and sells refilled toner cartridges;

Customers: private/public subjects that buy
refilled cartridges;

Recycling consortium: consortium of recycling
supply
chain
participants
whose
recycling
process has been reviewed and approved by the
Certification Authority; any cartridge refilled
from a Refiller of the Consortium is identified
by a UID from the Central Authority.

Figure 2.
Blockchain-enabled, trusted recycling process and actors
Figures 1 and 2 depict traditional and blockchain-based
processes, respectively.
The blockchain-based process steps are as follows:

Step 0 – UID distribution: PACTO (Produttori
Associati Cartucce e TOner) [18] Consortium
distributes UIDs to certified Collectors, and
keeps track of UID-Collector relationships;

Step
1
–
Cartridge
collection:
certified
Collectors physically collect
cartridges and
cartridges, and tag them with physical, non-
removable, low-cost medium (e.g., Near-Field
Communication -NFC tags) that carry UIDs;
from
now
on,
each
cartridge
is
uniquely
identified
by
a
UID
and
can
be
tracked
throughout the whole process;

Step 2 – Cartridge refill: certified Refillers
receive exhausted cartridges from Collectors;

Step 3 – (Optional) Cartridge Distribution:
distributors are (optional) intermediary partners
that facilitate cartridge sell;

Step 4 – Sell: Distributors and Refillers are
allowed to sell refilled, certified cartridges;

Step 5 – Verification: Customers can verify
cartridge refill process steps, from 1 to 4, hence
being able to assess cartridge refill compliance.
C. The key blockchain role
From step 1 onwards, each step advance can be tracked
and uniquely associated to a physical cartridge.
A traditional, centralized database of cartridges does not
meet reliability and trust requirements: the owner of the
database may easily alter database content, leaving other
parties no option to verify the correctness of cartridge
information.
This
inherently
distributed
update and
verification
process lends itself well to the adoption of a blockchain-
based approach; in our model, blockchain acts as the
distributed, decentralized ledger that:

keeps track of cartridges status advances, and
uniquely identifies them (and each status change)
via their UID;

allows any party to verify each stage of the refill
process, at any time, and with no option for anyone
to alter/fake them.
D. Blockchain choice
Blockchain choice was a core activity of the analysis
phase of the project. A huge effort has been spent on
studying and researching to understand pros and cons of
major public blockchain implementations. This phase was
hard, because we were not even aware of the Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) to use for the evaluation. The
blockchain is not just a software component: even the
community surrounding it, which is defining its evolution
roadmap has strong implications on several key aspects that
have to be taken into consideration during the evaluation
phase. Legal implications, constraints on the underlying
service design, community principles, and so on, have to be
included in the evaluation.
Key aspects to evaluate are:

How the business service is considered critical: the
most important element is understanding how
service delivery failures can affect the real world.
For example, using the blockchain in healthcare
could be highly critical for humans, in supply chain
or
copyright
protection
it
could
result
in
considerable penalty to pay, and so on. In order to
reasonably guarantee a reliable service, it is
necessary to focus on the maturity level of the
blockchain
implementation,
and
the
level
of
reliability of its distributed service network. On the
other hand, if blockchain is used for a less critical
use case, such as academic research, it is safe to
adopt less mature technologies;

Requirements on blockchain governance: should
the access be regulated or not? Focus has to be set
on governance processes at business level;

Requirements
on
data
to
be
written
on
the
blockchain:
first
of all,
data
written
on
the
blockchain are intended to be stored publicly,
immutably and forever; this implicit feature has
strong implications on privacy and data lifecycle,
particularly if the blockchain is deployed and used
in a public scenario;

Requirements on performance and integrations:
performance
common
KPIs
are
transaction
validation time, transaction delivery throughput,
and scalability of the blockchain; integrations
aspects focus mostly on the quality and maturity of
integration tools such as library and development
environments;

Cost of the blockchain infrastructure: blockchain
costs can be divided in costs of transactions issued,
intended as the fee related to those transactions and
costs needed to run the infrastructure, intended as
computational power to run nodes of the network,
35

INTERNET 2018 : The Tenth International Conference on Evolving Internet

computational power to generate the blocks, and
other costs related to connection handling such as
bandwidth.
Ultimately, a wider understanding and weighted evaluation
on several aspects discussed above had led to consider the
Bitcoin blockchain the best choice for this use case.
IV.
ARCHITECTURE
The
following
section
describes
our
Supply
Chain
Tracking System architecture main inspiring principles and
design choices.
A. Architecture principles
Blockchain, as a distributed verifiable data storage,
suffers from two main issues:
1.
costs:
registering
transactions
(events)
on
a
blockchain usually has non-negligible execution
times and transaction fees (costs), especially on
public, permissionless blockchains;
2.
storage space: Bitcoin blockchain allows storing
custom payloads of 80kb: this means storing
business-related
pieces
of
information
on
blockchain is usually infeasible for real-world
scenarios.
Due to the scope of our business scenario, we expect the
number of transaction registrations to exponentially grow
over time, since it depends on the number of certified
refilled cartridges and on each status update event. In our
model, transaction fees become a direct, proportional cost
that contributes to the final cartridge price (as of today, this
fee is upon the consortium itself). This is the main reason
why cost efficiency throughout the whole recycling process
is key in keeping refilled cartridges market-competitive, and
we had to design a way for transactions on the blockchain to
remain cost- and time-effective, no matter the increase in
number of events. Our solution addresses both issues by
adopting three key tenets.
First, we define an Event Common Tracking Model
(ECTM) - a minimum set of pieces of information that each
actor on the process agrees upon to keep track of cartridge
status changes; this allows keeping business information
strictly
needed
for
notarization
to
a
minimum,
and
contemporarily enabling interoperability between actors of
the supply chain.
Second, we delegate storage of business information to
traditional databases: Business Databases can either be
centralized (e.g., a single database for the consortium) or
distributed (e.g., each actor may have its own database). The
only requirement on such databases is to keep track of the
Common Tracking Model for each.
Third, to obtain cost efficiency and throughput, we
group a set of multiple events into a single blockchain
transaction; each group has the following characteristics:

Each ECTM in a group gets hashed in an Event
Hash (EH);

Event Hashes are combined and hashed together via
a Merkle-tree algorithm, producing a Group Hash
(GH); this Merkle-tree-based approach is quickly
becoming
a
major
solution
to
provide
a
reproducible,
hash
based
event
grouping
mechaninsm
for
blockchain
efficiency,
and
is
currently being adopted by a number of online
blockchain based services, such as Eternity Wall
[14] – the blockchain-based public message wall
that promises messages lasting forever on the
blockchain itself;

The Group Hash gets stored on the blockchain.
This approach guarantees the following features:

Flexibility: actors can save any business-related
information into the Business Databases, provided
the Common Tracking Model information are
stored;

Non-repudiability: any party that owns or knows a
Common Tracking Model for an event, can easily
verify against the blockchain its correctness; having
Common
Tracking
Models
hashed
on
the
blockchain guarantees this model is tamper-proof
and unmodifiable.
B. Architecture description

Our Supply Chain Tracking System (see Figure 3) is based
on the components described below.

PACTO
Consortium
holds
a
central
database
where
business information related to recycling events are stored
for any involved party; these is no need for this kind of

database to be central, and any single operator of any kind
can adopt its own local database.
Transaction
storage:
this
component
holds
the
aggregation and hashing logic described in section IV.A
Blockchain
adapter:
this
component
acts
as
an
abstraction layer that hides blockchain-specific transaction
registration details, so as to let the architecture be portable
between different blockchain implementations;
Blockchain Explorer: third-party service that allows to
view information about blocks, addresses, and transactions
on the Bitcoin blockchain. Our implementation relies on the
open source Web portal BlockExplorer [15].
V.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This work presents a novel Supply Chain Tracking
System that relies on Bitcoin’s blockchain to realize a
notarization system supply chain goods status change and
transitions.
This solution allows to overcome traditional fraud and
counterfeit problems in a specific business sector, namely
toner cartridge regeneration.
Future work will focus on investigating some new models
and mechanisms (such as Lightning Network [19]) to keep
Bitcoin’s blockchain purest model, and simplify and speed
up registration of transactions on the blockchain itself.
