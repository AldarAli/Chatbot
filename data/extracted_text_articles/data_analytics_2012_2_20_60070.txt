Abstract—In 
this 
paper, 
we 
introduce 
the 
network 
visualization based on the rejection reasons on car inspections. 
It is compared with the visualization based on principal 
component analysis. The largest private provider of vehicle 
inspections in northern Europe, A-Katsastus, published 
rejection statistics in Finland for the fourth time. The statistics 
is  published  in  dozens  of  tables  on  the  basis  of  the  year  of  
introduction into use, make or model.  Our goal is to visualize 
all this information in one network. The car inspection data is 
aggregated with the produced visualization. However, the 
dependencies between the different rejection reasons and cars 
can be efficiently studied by exploring our network 
visualization.

 INTRODUCTION 
In our research, we used a desktop application Gephi. It 
is an interactive visualization and exploration platform [1]. It 
is commonly used for the visualization of social networks 
[2], Facebook friends, Twitter, etc. For example, the 
discussions between the Members of the Parliament in 
Finland have been visualized [3]. In that visualization, those 
who took part to the same discussions are connected. 
Visualizations of Social Networks have been widely studied, 
e.g., in [4], a network of social relations is created using 
publicly articulated mutual “friendship” links. In this paper, 
we present results suggesting that network visualization is 
suitable also for car inspection data where different rejection 
reasons are presented as “bridges” between the cars. 
Typically, in reliability rating reports, areas of inspection 
are excluded and the most common grounds for rejection to 
keep legibility simple enough on the different tables, e.g., 
TÜV  reports  [5].  Only  rank,  car  make  –  model  and  fault  
percentage in different “introduced into use” tables are 
shown. It means that there are 40 different tables published 
per year, i.e., 320 tables since 2004. Our goal is to aggregate 
all this data to one visualization including the most common 
grounds for rejection. It helps the users to make their own 
conclusions by extracting some rejection reasons, such as 
tires, which are totally dependent on drivers when analyzing 
the data. Our network visualization is compared with a 
visualization generated by Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) which was used on our earlier work [6].  
II. 
DATA AND PREPROCESSING 
A-Katsastus Group inspected approximately 925 000 
passenger cars in Finland in 2011 [7]. This and previously 
published data is used in our visualization. Yearly data is 
divided into several tables by the age of the car. A similar 
publication has previously been produced on the basis of 
their statistics by the Swedish company Bilprovningen and 
the German vehicle inspection chain Dekra.  
The top three rejection reasons (RR) are listed, if a 
certain car is inspected more than N=100 times and the same 
rejection  reason  is  listed  more  than  L=10 times.  The  
proportion of these requirements is p=0.1. In theory p ࣅ 
]0,1], but in practice it can be assumed that p varies around 
value 0.1. In this paper “car” means its model, type and age. 
In Finland, new cars are inspected on third and fifth year and 
older cars yearly. Newer cars have fewer rejections. 
Therefore there is less information about new cars than old 
ones. Also an average rejection r [percentage] is listed. 
In the original data rejections are divided into 13 
different classes, such as tires, brakes, steering and control 
devices; see Table 1. For analysis, a 14th class is defined as 
“unclassified” reason, because mostly the new cars have no 
listed rejection reasons in the data.

where vector a is defined in this research as:

All three reasons are listed: a = [0.04 0.02 0], 
x 
Two reasons are listed: a = [0.02 0], 
x 
Only one reason is listed: a = 0. 
 
So, if all three rejection reasons are listed for the car i, the 
row sum of the first 13 cells for this car is (0.14+0.12+0.1)r 
= 0.36r with the assumption p=0.1 (based  on  the  A-
Katsastus publication requirements). Last cell x(i,14) = 
0.64r, so the sum of each row X is r. If no reasons are listed 
for a car, then x(i,14) = r. In practice this means that we 
assumed that the most common (listed first) reason is 2r 
percentage units more probable than the second listed reason. 
In the year 2008, RRs were classified in a different way 
than in the years 2009 - 2011. Therefore, it was excluded 
from the analysis and three matrices X(2009), X(2010) and 
X(2011) were visualized. As mentioned before, newer cars 
are inspected every second year, so in matrices X(2009) and 
X(2011) there are cars, which are missing from the matrix 
X(2010). These data matrices were combined row by row. In 
a new matrix Z one row represents one car. Older statistics 
have less effect on the model and it is defined as

where Ȝ=[0,1] is  a  forgetting  factor.  If  Ȝ Į, it is expected 
that Į% of last years car RRs are taken into account in the 
visualization. L is a zero-one vector defining if car data 
exists on matrix X(k) or not. Car i introduced in use, e.g., in 
2007 was inspected in the year 2010, but not in the years 
2009 and 2011, so then L(i,:)  =  [0  1  0]. Zero values in 
matrix Z mean that there is no connection between the car i 
and RR j.

METHODS 
A. Principal Component Analysis 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a method for 
orthogonal linear transformation. The dimension of the data 
is reduced by transforming it to a new coordinate system 
such that the greatest variance lies on the first component 
[9]. The quantified matrices are combined as

and matrix C is projected to subspace by placing the first N

B. Network Visualization 
Our network layout is based on the ForceAtlas2 (FA2) 
method [8]. It is suitable for graphs with 10 to 10000 nodes. 
Cars and RRs are represented by colored balls in a graph. 
The attraction force F between two nodes n(1) and n(2) 
depends linearly on the distance d(n(1),n(2)).  
 FA2 is a continuous algorithm and the model is based on 
attraction and repulsion proportional to distance between 
nodes. Various layouts are achieved with different initial 
coordinates and parameter settings, see (2, 3). The main goal 
is to produce a readable spatialization and devise an energy 
model that could be easily understood by users. A clear 
visualization where nodes are separated and not overlapped 
(this feature can be forced in Gephi [1]) is reached by 
various parameter settings. In our model default values of 
scaling were increased and gravity decreased to obtain a 
sparser graph. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTS 
A. Principal Component Analysis 
We tested two different methods for car data 
visualization. Matrix C was projected to a 2-dimensional 
space using PCA. First and second components were 
visualized using Google Motion Chart where the RR 
statistics for 2009-2011 can be interactively explored. Cars 
with the same RR are situated in the same place in 
coordinates. However, this visualization is not very 
practical. Cars with only one listed RR are situated in 
corners, because m in (1) relatively small [6]. Readibility of 
the graph is not very good if only one plot is used, because 
RRs are shown only in a loadings plot, see Figure 1.  
 
 
Figure 1.   PCA results are shown in the motion chart. Volkswagen Bora 
(2004) in the last year’s statistics (2011) is projected to the far right. The 
first component loading for exhaust problem is positive. 
B. Network Visualization 
All cars are connected to rejection results based on 
matrix Z,  see  (3).  ForceAtlas2  algorithm  is  used  to  order  
initial car coordinates to stabile positions. Some of the 
40

default parameters were changed: Edge Weight Influence = 
0.02, Scaling = 50, Gravity = 1.0 and Tolerance = 0.1. Cars 
with same rejection reasons are situated in the same area in 
the graph.  
Some cars have no listed rejection reasons. Therefore, the 
unclassified class x(i,14) was introduced in the previous 
section. Cars without RR information are located in the same 
area. The total weights of RRs are the same as the average 
rejection percentage r. Each car type and model is connected 
to the same cars with up to two years difference in age with 
small connection weights. With one year difference w=0.2 
and two years difference with w=0.1.  By this procedure, the 
visualization is more informative, because a relatively large 
cluster of nodes with only one connection to unclassified RR 
is avoided. In practice, it means that in a graph we are 
assuming that if car i does not have listed RRs, it has with 
small probability the same RRs than older or newer cars with 
the same model and type, but are not listed in the published 
statistics.  
In the past three years, there were 1060 cars which were 
inspected more than 100 times. It means that the size of 
matrix Z is (n=1060, m=14) in  our  visualizations.  A  
produced network with Ȝ = 0.8) is visualized in Figure 2.  
All cars are connected to unclassified RR (ID=14) which is 
situated in the center of a graph. Infrequent RRs are placed 
on graph borders and RR(ID=i) which is dependent with 
another RR(ID=j) near each other. 
The parking brake RR is mentioned in car inspection 
statistics in highlighted cars shown in Figure 3. Chassis, 
front suspension and brakes problems also occur rather 
probably in these cars, because these RRs are rather close 
each other in the graph. 
Some of the RRs are totally driver dependent. Rather old 
Toyota Corollas have had small rejection percentage r. In 
addition, one of the reasons was bald tires. The connections 
of Toyota Corolla (2006) are shown in Figure 4. About 3.5% 
of the cars were rejected in the car inspections. Based on 
matrix Z, connections show that in the past three years 3rd 
top-rated reason was tires. Also, additional connections show 
that older and newer cars have had the same kind of RRs. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Cars and rejection reason classes (constant size red balls, m=14) 
are visualized. Old cars are represented by blue balls and newest (2008) by 
green balls, n=1060. Edges exist between RRs and cars. Also cars with age 
±2 are connected. Sizes of the car balls and edges between cars and RRs 
are proportional with the rejection rates r.
 
 
Figure 3.  The labels of cars with the parking brake rejection reasons are highlighted.

Figure 4.  The connections of Toyota Corolla (2006) are shown. It is connected with all rejection reasons mentioned in reports 2009-2011 and the same cars 
which have been introduced into use between 2004 and 2008.  Short edges between Toyota Corolla cars are corresponding similar RRs. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Our goal in information visualization was reached even 
though the provided data was not complete. The achieved 
results 
with 
certain 
assumptions 
related 
to 
data 
preprocessing and visualization are reported in this paper. 
PCA visualization was found to facilitate data exploration to 
some degree. Exploring the car inspection data is faster 
using the visualizations in Gephi or in a browser than by the 
dozens of tables. Visualization with the same parameters as 
presented in this paper is available on web [10]. A user can 
study the dependencies between the different rejection 
reasons and cars by exploring our network visualization. 
Our work is still in progress and in future work, we will 
use additional car inspection data to get more reliable and 
high quality visualizations. Other layouts will be considered 
in order to improve the network readability, e.g. [11].
