Abstractâ€”Data analysis may yield information regarding the 
system performance.  In this study, we analyze the maintenance 
data provided by Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation (TRTC); 
the data consists of limited maintenance records of the Taipei 
metro system.  However, the accuracy to ascertain the system 
lifetime based upon limited maintenance records of a still young 
metro system is yet to be determined.  Furthermore, the Taipei 
metro system is renowned for its good maintenance and 
performance, which further complicates the analysis with 
additional variable introduced by replaced new parts.  Based on 
limited maintenance records, the research objective is to assess 
the feasibility of extracting reliable information indicative of the 
current stage of life, and, the remaining lifetime of the metro 
system.

 INTRODUCTION 
The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system of Taipei Rapid 
Transit Corporation (TRTC) began operation on March 28, 
1996; it has been operating for 22 years [1].  Most of the 
equipment has not yet been replaced.  In this research, we 
investigate the feasibility of extracting information from the 
Taipei MRT maintenance records.  The research objective is 
to determine whether it is possible to acquire reliable 
information of the system performance from the limited time-
span maintenance records.  If the maintenance data indeed 
contains such information of the current system status, our 
goal is to assess the current stage of life of the Taipei MRT 
system and determine the remaining lifetime. 
The performance and degradation of metropolitan metro 
systems have been the focus of general public.  Various 
studies have been reported, including technical issues of the 
MRT.  Rail track condition monitoring is an important 
technical concern of the MRT system [2].  However, constant 
monitoring of the MRT system is not available; typically the 
usual maintenance is performed once a month or less.  The 
track condition has attracted much attention since it is a 
potential threat to the railway system.  Studies to prevent such 
threats have been reported [3]-[5].  To improve the reliability 
of a mass rapid transit system is the general goal of such 
research and technical modifications.   
Analysis of information regarding other metropolitan 
mass transport systems may be helpful.  As reported in [6], 
train model R36 of the New York City subway serviced from 
1964 to 2003, a total of 39 years.  R160s were used to replace 
45-year-old trains.  In another news report about old trains [7], 
the oldest trains for New York City Subway were planned to 
serve for 58 years.  Now, this type of train is considered too 
old, has very high failure rate and is not appealing to 
passengers.  The subway train lifetime is estimated to be 
around 40 to 50 years.  For example, some lines of Singapore 
Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) have been operating since 1987, 
30 years from today.  Thus, the actual wear-out period of a 
metro system, assuming they are similar, may roughly lie 
between 20 years (the oldest TRTC asset), and 40 years (New 
York City Subway).  However, all of these metropolitan metro 
systems are different in various aspects, such as: model, 
company, maintenance, management culture, etc.  It is natural 
that the characteristics of these MRT systems are not the same 
and may even differ dramatically.  With unknown number of 
variables involved, the accuracy of assessment may be very 
limited. 
Determining the current system status may be essential.  
The degradation curve is commonly employed for estimation 
of the system current status.  Analysis of the reliability is 
based on failure rate and maintenance records [8].  To study 
the maintenance and performance characteristics, various 
approaches have been reported [9]-[17], including the 
popular bathtub curve analysis [18]-[23].  Typically, the 
bathtub-shaped curve is employed for system performance 
analysis [24].  Analysis based upon the bathtub curve has 
been extensively applied to various problems; various 
modifications to improve applicability have been reported 
[11][25][26].  It is possible that the bathtub-shaped curve 
could be affected by human factors; for example, if the asset 
retired in its early stage, the curve may not rise up during the 
wear-out period and may even descend.  If properly 
maintained, the curve may not rise in the wear-out period.  
However, few MRT systems in reality exhibit degradation 
behavior similar to the bathtub-shaped curve model [27].  It 
is possible such bathtub curve may not be the ideal model for 
analyzing the metro system performance.

This paper is organized as follows.  Section I consists of 
an introduction of the problem. The research method is 
discussed in Section II.  Research findings are reported in 
Section III, and finally, a summary is presented in Section IV, 
followed by an acknowledgement. 
II. 
METHOD 
The bathtub-shaped curve model [24] is commonly 
employed to assess the system condition.  It consists of a 
break-in trend as the system condition improves, followed by 
a plateau regime where the system condition is stable.  After 
this stable regime, the system condition withers with 
increased malfunction rate, followed by a steep increase of 
malfunction rate where the malfunction rate increases with 
time rapidly whereas the system breaks down.  Together, the 
bathtub-shaped curve represents the various stages of an ideal 
system.   
However, the bathtub-shaped degradation curve is a 
theoretical model used in many problems.  It is an idealized 
trend that depends on various factors.  The feasibility of 
applying such bathtub-shaped curve may depend on the 
specific application and the various factors involved.  
Specifically, the system condition may not follow the same 
degradation curve, also, each equipment system may exhibit 
different characteristics depending on the specific application.   
Furthermore, each equipment in the Taipei metro system 
consists of various brands and various models that may 
possess different intrinsic characteristics.  Since each 
equipment is maintained by humans, the degradation curve 
may be influenced by human factors and fall short to follow a 
universal bathtub-shaped curve.  By analyzing the 
maintenance data, our goal is to decipher the feasibility to 
assess the MRT current stage of life based on available data 
ranging over a limited time-span. 
III. 
DATA ANALYSIS 
In this study, we investigate the maintenance data of the 
Taipei metro system.  Based on the maintenance data records 
provided by TRTC, we analyze the maintenance data of the 
escalator system, elevator system, and Electric Multiple Unit 
(EMU) air conditioner of the metro system.  These three 
systems are essential components of the metro system.  The 
elevator and escalator are used regularly by the commuting 
people.   
 
The maintenance records of the elevator, escalator, and 
EMU air conditioner are analyzed.  Figure 1 depicts the 
maintenance record of the escalator. We notice that the trend 
of the malfunction rate is irregular. Possibly because of the 
limited span of the maintenance data the specific stage of life-
time is not apparent; further analysis is therefore required.  
 
 
Next, the maintenance records of the elevator system is 
shown in Figure 2.  The maintenance records decrease with 
time. Trend of the maintenance records monotonically 
decrease with time.  The monotonic decrease trend appears to 
be easier to match with the ideal bathtub-shaped curve. 
Lastly, the maintenance records of the EMU air 
conditioner are shown in Figure 3, also exhibiting the 
malfunction rate decreasing over time.  However, compared 
to the smooth trend of Figure 2, the EMU air conditioner 
maintenance data is more volatile.  Though the maintenance 
data of the three systems differ, they all roughly decrease with 
time, suggesting that the system is still young whereas the 
performance is still improving.  Or, the system is being well-
maintained such that the malfunction rate does not reflect the 
system performance accurately.

The maintenance records provided by TRTC consists of 
only the number of malfunctions per month.  However, the 
severity of each malfunction may be drastically different, 
from as simple as the replacement of light bulb, up to power 
combustion resulting in system complete breakdown.  Yet, in 
the available maintenance records, there is no information 
describing the severity of the malfunction event.  The 
statistical analyses of these three systems (escalator, elevator, 
and EMU air conditioner) exhibit no apparent degradation of 
the system.  Trends of the maintenance records suggest that 
the system condition improves with time, which is not the 
typical of a withering system.   
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The objective of this research is to determine the current 
condition of the metro system, and, furthermore, if possible, 
to estimate the remaining lifetime. By means of data analysis, 
our goal is to identify characteristics indicative of the current 
status of the metro system, remaining lifetime, and estimate 
its future trend. However, the desired information may not be 
fully contained in the provided dataset and therefore limiting 
the accuracy of system lifetime assessment.  Research 
findings show that the accuracy to assess the system lifetime 
based upon the provided maintenance records of a still-young 
metro system is limited. 
Data analysis of the Taipei metro system maintenance 
records revealed the general trend and characteristics of the 
system condition and performance. Yet, information 
regarding the total lifespan of the system, current stage-of-
life, and remaining lifetime he not been ascertained.  Possible 
reasons include: 1) the system being still young, 2) the regular 
maintenance altered the natural deterioration trend, 3) the 
available data being far from complete to make meaningful 
estimations of lifetime information.  Further analysis to help 
answer these questions are in pursuit. 
Based on the available maintenance records of the Taipei 
metro system, the statistical analysis suggests that the 
maintenance of the Taipei metro system is well conducted; 
no signs of deterioration or withering.  The data analysis falls 
short to yield information regarding the total lifespan, the 
current stage of life, and the remaining lifetime.  If data with 
longer span and more variables is available, it is possible that 
such information can be ascertained.
