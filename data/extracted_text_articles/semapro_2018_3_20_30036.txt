Abstract- The vision of the Semantic Web is machine 
understandability for all data currently stored in web-based 
resources. Terminological resources, which follow the ISO 
(International Organization for Standardization) standards on 
terminology in defining concepts as unique combinations of 
essential characteristics (ISO 1087-1), need to become 
computable and Semantic Web compliant. This paper, first, 
describes the theoretical approach and the tool-assisted 
method, which underlies the turning of these terminologies into 
Semantic web compliant ontologies. Next, this paper presents 
Tedi (ontoTerminology editor), the platform developed for 
building multilingual terminologies, which share the same 
formal domain ontology. Tedi allows to export these 
terminologies into OWL (Web Ontology Language), RDF 
(Resource Description Framework), JSON (JavaScript Object 
Notation), and in a number of other formats, including 
multilingual 
HTML 
(Hyper 
Text 
Markup 
Language) 
electronic dictionaries of terms. Tedi is based on a theory of 
concept dedicated to Terminology. Semantics is defined as the 
relation between terms (natural language units with meaning 
specialized to a domain of knowledge) and concepts (units of 
thought whose meaning is formally expressed as a set of 
essential characteristics), according to the discipline of 
Terminology. Tedi stores the linguistic and the conceptual 
dimensions in two related, yet distinct systems. This formal 
theory, which supplies the semantic onto-terminological layer 
needed for deeper data interpretability by machines, is less 
contrived and far more intuitive to use. It empowers domain 
experts to build their own semantic multilingual terminological 
dictionaries without having to be aware of logical formalisms 
like description logics. Semantic content management systems 
are direly needed in the domain of ancient cultural heritage. 
The remainder of the paper will illustrate this particular point 
with a use case from the domain of ancient Greek dress 
terminology presented from the point of view of the user 
(domain expert).

 INTRODUCTION 
This paper proposes a tool-assisted method to design and 
create 
multilingual 
domain 
ontoterminologies 
(i.e., 
terminologies whose conceptual system is a formal domain 
ontology) relying on a definition of concept as a set of 
essential characteristics. An essential characteristic is such 
that, if removed from the object, the object is no more what it 
is, e.g., mortal for ‘human being’). Such ontoterminologies 
are both ontologies that represent and model the concepts of 
a domain of specialized knowledge and terminologies that 
capture the verbal expression of this knowledge in different 
natural languages. The approach is based on the assumption 
that the same conceptualization of a specific domain can be 
shared across different linguistic communities, albeit 
expressed differently due to the difference in the linguistic 
medium. It follows that a formal domain ontoterminology 
can be built in order to capture a/ the conceptual layer of the 
domain of interest, and b/ the multilingual sets of terms 
denoting the concepts in the ontology. The concepts are 
defined in an artificial and formal language embedded in a 
user-friendly interface. The definitions of terms in natural 
language are built from the formal definitions of the concept 
each term denotes. This permits to guarantee some logical 
properties, such as coherence and completeness. What this 
achieves is a degree of standardization necessary for verbal 
communication 
among 
experts, 
inside 
and 
across 
communities of practice, based on a common understanding 
of their domain. This opens up new perspectives for the 
operationalization of terminologies for IT (Information 
Technology) applications. The approach is extremely useful 
for solving the problem of how to describe object-based 
knowledge of a part of the world in relation to the textual 
resources that refer to the same part, as is often the case in 
archaeology, classics, and cultural heritage studies. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: 
Section II describes the motivation that led to building the 
ontoterminology editor Tedi [1]. Section III presents related 
work and briefly explains why it is not sufficient. Section IV 
addresses 
the 
theoretical 
underpinnings 
of 
the 
ontoterminology approach. Section V describes the Tedi 
platform in terms of interfaces and details a use case from 
the domain of application. Our domain of choice was Greek 
dress, a domain which is deep-seated in modern perceptions 
of ancient Greek culture. The conclusions and future work 
section closes the article. 
II. 
MOTIVATION 
Ontologies and terminologies are at the core of the 
Semantic Web [2]. Ontologies, defined as “an explicit 
specification of a conceptualization” [3] mainly rely on 
description logics for their knowledge theory and on W3C 
42

interchange formats for their formal representation [4]. The 
dominant formalism for representing ontology has been the 
T-Box (assertions on concepts) and A-Box (assertions on 
individuals) in Description Logics (DL) (alias terminological 
logics [5]). “Concepts represent sets of individuals, roles 
represent binary relations between the individuals, and 
individual names represent single individuals in the domain. 
Readers familiar with first-order logic will recognize these as 
unary predicates, binary predicates and constants” [6]. 
Readers with no such background, however, will have 
difficulty grappling with the notion of DLs (Description 
Logics), better known for their decidability and the ability to 
infer additional knowledge, than for being intuitive [7]. The 
most popular free open-source editor for authoring 
ontologies based on these principles is Protégé [8] thanks to 
its powerful functionalities. 
Not all terminologies rely on description logics for their 
conceptual system. Some terminologies follow the principles 
of the ISO standards for terminology work, which better 
match the way domain experts reason, because they are less 
contrived. 
There 
are 
numerous 
ISO 
standards 
for 
terminology work and no counterparts for dealing with 
ontology. The ISO 1087-1 and ISO 704, the standards on 
which all others should rely, were designed in times when 
the vision of the Semantic Web was not yet on the horizon 
(for a brief historical account see [9]). Their single goal was 
communication between humans, not IT applications [10], 
this is why they should be revised [11]. 
 ISO 1087-1 [12] defines Terminology a/ as the “science 
studying the structure, formation, development, usage and 
management of terminologies in various subject fields”, and 
b/ as the result of the application of this science to a 
dedicated specialized domain, i.e., a “set of designations 
belonging to one special language”. ISO 1087-1 defines 
concept as a “unit of knowledge created by a unique 
combination of characteristics” and term as a “verbal 
designation of a general concept in a specific subject field”. 
Representing concepts as sets of essential characteristics, not 
as sets of individuals (which is what Protégé does) allows to 
focus more on the nature of objects than on defining their 
properties solely as binary relations that link them together 
(“roles” in DLs, “slots” in Protégé). Based on Aristotelian 
definitions by genus and differentia, concepts can be 
verbalized in a more human readable form than restrictions 
on roles. This type of definition is particularly useful for 
ontology extraction [13]. What is more, a terminological 
system, which is also an ontology authoring tool with logic-
based formalisms and adheres to W3C standards, is 
extremely useful to domain experts and terminologists who 
do not have background in logic, but need to build their own 
machine-actionable 
and 
understandable 
domain 
terminologies. Tedi, a new ontology editing platform for 
terminologies of a given domain, was born out of the drive to 
respond to these needs. Formalized terminologies are 
essential for language processing tasks, for reasoning upon 
the data, for the creation of fully computable multilingual 
dictionaries, and for connecting object-based with text-based 
resources. 
III. 
RELATED WORK 
Relevant research on the state-of-the art on representing 
the semantics of our data for the Semantic web points 
towards the following directions: 
A. Ontologisation of non-ontological resources 
A conceptual model of a domain is at the core of most 
knowledge based systems and language processing systems. 
The specific contribution of formal ontologies is the detailed, 
logical definition of the concepts and of the possible 
semantic relations between entities. Today one of the most 
prominent application of ontologies is the semantic indexing 
of content for resource discovery. This requires that the 
underlying data has rich and unambiguous semantics. The 
need for structuring the categories of the domain in a way 
that can be communicated without the risks of natural 
language ambiguity and polysemy has given rise to 
numerous 
efforts 
to 
use 
controlled 
languages 
and 
vocabularies. For a relatively recent state-of-the-art see [14]-
[15].  
This approach is similar to that of wielding the power of 
thesauri as a less powerful and less granular way to structure 
into a hierarchy the terms of a domain. Thesauri structure 
concepts into monohierarchic trees or polyhierarchic lattices, 
ontologies structure them into semantically-rich directed 
graphs. The example of the ontologization of AGROVOC 
Thesaurus is a clear manifestation of the advantage of 
terminologically rich domain ontologies over other types of 
Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) [16]. The current 
need to reengineer cultural heritage thesauri into ontologies 
is exemplified by Getty Vocabularies [17]-[18]. 
B. Building natural language interfaces for representing 
knowledge on the Semantic Web 
Semantic Content Authoring and Linked Data authoring 
for user-friendly creation of content (manual or semi-
automatic) on the web of data are rapidly emerging. Natural 
language interfaces support end users who are not computer 
experts. A range of capabilities such as the authoring of 
knowledge content, the retrieval of information from 
semantic repositories, and the generation of pattern for 
definitions in natural language make content management 
more intelligent through the injection of descriptive 
semantics in the process of content creation [19].   
C. Building lexical models for the representation of lexical 
data on the Semantic Web 
The primary mechanisms for the representation of lexical 
data on the Semantic Web has been the Lemon core model 
[20] (with extra modules for Syntax and Semantics, 
Decomposition, Variation and Translation, and Metadata 
[21]), further developed in the context of the W3C OntoLex 
community group into the new OntoLex-Lemon model [22]. 
D. Using existing ontology authoring environments 
Before setting off, we considered using existing ontology 
editors. There exist different ontology editing tools, which 
support the creation and population of ontologies for the 
semantic web, but, to our knowledge, none which allows to 
43

directly take into account the notion of ‘essential 
characteristic’ for defining domain concepts. In order to 
build our domain ontology, we used Tedi, a software which 
empowers domain experts to do their own ontological 
modelling. We decided against building our ontology 
directly in Protégé, even though Protégé is a feature-rich 
open-source platform for the construction of ontologies for 
the semantic web and is supported by a big user community. 
Protégé users have to familiarize themselves with defining 
classes (concepts) in terms of roles and role restrictions, 
which is hardly intuitive for those with no background in 
Logic. Granted, modelling in Protégé is a steep learning 
curve for non-computer scientists [23]. In contrast, Tedi 
supports the definition of formal ontologies by means of 
essential and descriptive characteristics, which are more 
intuitive to domain experts. For example, sewn is an essential 
characteristic of the garment exomis, whereas color is a 
descriptive one. Unlike descriptive characteristic, essential 
characteristic cannot be assigned a value. Its formalization 
requires a higher logic. Furthermore, the notion of ‘essential 
characteristic’ is a cornerstone for Conceptual Terminology 
in 
Specialized 
Languages. 
Conceptual 
Terminology 
distinguishes the definition of concepts (set of essential 
characteristics) from the description of objects (set of 
descriptive characteristics).  
E. Ontologising cultural heritage  
Last, in order to ontologise our terminology from the 
cultural heritage of ancient Greece we considered using 
relevant ISO standards, especially the ISO 1087-1 standard 
on vocabulary, theory and application of terminology, and 
the ISO 704 on principles and methods of terminology work. 
As already discussed these ISO standards are not 
operationalisable [11]. There is one ISO standard for the 
cultural heritage sector, which as will be shown below, our 
approach aims to extend. The vocabulary for the description 
of cultural objects was accepted as international standard 
ISO 21127 and is also known as CIDOC-CRM (Conseil 
International des Musées-Conceptual Reference Model) 
[24]-[25]. CIDOC-CRM does not specifically address the 
terminologies of the cultural heritage domain [26]. The same 
holds for other data models used in the cultural heritage and 
museum community, e.g., LIDO (Lightweight Information 
Describing Objects) [27] and EDM (Europeana Data Model) 
[28].    
Due to the semantic richness and heterogeneity of 
cultural content and the distributed ways in which this 
content is created by domain experts, cultural heritage is a 
field where semantic technologies should become the 
standard technology to use. While archaeology and classical 
studies have spearheaded the use of digital tools, they have 
been quite slow in adopting W3C standards, mainly due to 
the belief that the type of humanistic inquiry pursued in these 
fields cannot or should not be standardized [29]. The theory 
and practice of ontological representation and modelling of 
archaeological, and more broadly, cultural heritage material, 
needs to be informed by the epistemic traditions of the 
disciplines involved [30]. Models that capture information 
independently of linguistic and cultural variation can 
standardize this diversity by adding a formal layer to the 
data. Knowledge, even tacit knowledge, needs to be 
expressed in a language, either natural or artificial. Models to 
cover both the conceptual and the terminological aspects of 
this knowledge are definitely going to multiply in the near 
future [31] – [33].  
In the domain of ancient Greek cultural heritage, efforts 
are made to produce new domain-specific standards, such as 
the standard for digital editions of texts inscribed on a range 
of materials, including stone and papyrus (EpiDoc, 
Epigraphic Documents in TEI-XML, Text Encoding 
Initiative - eXtensible Markup Language) [34], and the 
Standards of Networking Ancient Prosopographies (SNAP) 
[35]. Moreover, geo-ontologies, such as Pelagios [36] and 
Google Ancient Places [37] link space as place to ancient 
time, while datasets of ancient artefacts, such as coins [38] 
and pottery [39], can now be published as LOD (Linked 
Open Data). The formalization of terminological systems in 
the domain, however, remains at a nascent stage. 
IV. THE ONTOTERMINOLOGY APPROACH  
The need to make terminologies that are meant for 
human communication machine-processible according to 
international de facto and de jure standards motivated the 
first machine-readable trilingual terminology of ancient 
Greek dress (in English, French, and Greek) [40]. Our 
approach set out to build a formal domain ontology and 
make the resulting structured data shareable on the web of 
data. To achieve this means dealing with the ambiguity of 
natural language in defining the concepts of the domain. A 
degree of formalization/standardization was achieved, first, 
by clearly distinguishing between the concept level (i.e., the 
stable domain knowledge) and the term level (i.e., the natural 
language that is used to name the domain concepts); second, 
by putting them into relation (i.e., linking the terms in 
different languages to their denoted concepts). This leads to 
combining ontology and terminology into the new paradigm 
of ontoterminology [41]. An additional objective was to 
create a tool that lowers the barrier for users not familiar 
with knowledge engineering, both at the technical level and 
at the level of the logical theory adopted. When exporting in 
OWL essential characteristics are translated into classes; 
essential characteristics belonging to the same axis of 
analysis, therefore mutually exclusive, are translated into 
disjoint classes. There are different ways of translating 
essential characteristics into OWL. The use of classes is one 
of them. It is also possible to simulate a second order logic in 
considering essential characteristics as individuals [42]. 
V.TEDI SOFTWARE PLATFORM 
The 
Tedi 
software 
platform 
was 
developed 
in 
VisualWorks at the University Savoie Mont-Blanc [1]. It 
supports both term standardization and customization. 
Standardization 
of 
terminologies 
relies 
upon 
expert 
agreement on domain knowledge, which is necessary for 
collaboration and rapid sharing of information. 
Tedi relies on a theory of concept inspired by the ISO 
standards on terminology. It is based on the notion of 
essential characteristic. The essential characteristics are 
44

SEMAPRO 2018 : The Twelfth International Conference on Advances in Semantic Processing

grouped into axes of analysis (sets of exclusive essential 
characteristics, e.g., a garment can be either wrapped or 
attached; either worn directly on the skin or as an 
overgarment; etc.). The set of axes of analysis constitutes an 
‘orthogonal base’ for the meaning of the concepts. The 
logical properties of the system are verified at every step of 
ontology building. 
Such modelling of domain knowledge can be very finely 
structured knowledge in order to eventually support two 
types of queries: by means of words, and by means of 
concepts. In order to clearly distinguish between the different 
types of knowledge on which Tedi relies, we use the 
following conventions: concepts are written between angle 
brackets “< >”, whereas essential characteristics (also called 
“differences” in Tedi) are written between slashes “/…/”, 
and terms written between quotes “…”. For example, the 
term “exomis” denotes a type of objects associated to the 
following set of characteristics: /for man/, /around body/, 
/more than one part/, /with sewing/, /without sleeves/, 
/attached/, /one attachment/, /knee-length/, /unpleated/, 
/under/. 
A. Tedi Editors 
Tedi’s rich architecture deploys two interconnected 
systems for the conceptual and linguistic dimensions. The 
concept editor allows to define essential characteristics, axes 
of analysis, attributes (descriptive characteristics), relations, 
and concepts. It also allows to update the ontology by 
inserting new concepts into the hierarchy. In order to help 
structure the system, Tedi automatically infers the possible 
generic concepts as well as the possible essential 
characteristics. The system’s in-built reasoner checks the 
compatibility of the essential characteristics in order to 
propose only those that are possible at a given moment. It 
also infers those that can be logically inferred and generates 
the formal definition of the concept, helping the expert to 
manage the combinatorial explosion (n axes of analysis 
made up of two exclusive essential characteristics potentially 
define 2n concepts). If there is no concept corresponding to 
the set of essential characteristics denoted by a term, Tedi 
proposes to create a new concept and a new concept name 
based on the selected essential characteristics. 
In the term editor, the user can: enter the terms in as 
many languages as needed, declare the status for each term 
(term status can be parameterized) and the part-of-speech for 
each term (choosing from: noun, verb, adjective, none), add 
contexts and notes. Tedi generates a pattern of definition for 
each term on the basis of the formal definition of the denoted 
concept. The system also calculates automatically the 
terminological equivalents across different languages, but 
also in a given language and for a given term the 
terminological synonyms, terminological hypernyms and 
hyponyms (two terms are terminological synonyms if and 
only if they denote the same concept). 
B. Export Formats 
Tedi enables domain experts to capture domain 
knowledge, to express it formally regardless of their 
background in formal languages, and to export it into 
different formats, which, of course, are not equivalent. At its 
present version (version 1.1) Tedi exports in CSV (Comma 
Separated Values), HTML (both static and dynamic), JSON, 
and RDF / OWL. 
C. Use case: Conceptualizing Ancient Greek Garments 
In the use case we present here the user needs to define 
the Greek dress multilingual ontoterminology. Figure 1 
shows a screenshot of the modelling of the garment termed 
“ἐξωµίς” in ancient Greek, “exomis” in English and 
“exomide” in French. Textual and iconographic evidence has 
shown that the “exomis” is a male unpleated and sleeveless 
garment that covers the body down to the knees and is 
attached at one point of attachment.  
The ontoterminology building process, centered on 
essential characteristics, consists in five interrelated non-
linear iterative tasks that the expert should take for every 
concept defined in the system. 
Task 1: Go to Tedi Term editor: enter the terms to be 
defined in the language(s) we need. These terms can be 
given directly by the experts or from NLP tools for candidate 
term extraction. Define their Status (choosing from the 
following drop-down list: preferred, alternative, tolerated, 
not recommended, obsolete), and their PoS (Part-of-Speech) 
(choosing from: noun, verb, adjective, none). 
Task 2: In Tedi Concept editor: define the essential 
characteristics and the axes of analysis. These essential 
characteristics are found out by identifying differences 
between objects. 
Task 3: In Tedi Term editor: link the term to the concept. 
Select all the essential characteristics that you want 
associated with the term. If there is no corresponding 
concept, Tedi proposes to create a new one, whose name is 
constructed from the chosen essential characteristics. The set 
of characteristics that have been selected is its formal 
definition, i.e., its definition in a formal language imbedded 
in Tedi. The axes of analysis, their dependencies and the 
compatibility of the essential characteristics are managed by 
Tedi. The system automatically checks the compatibility of 
the defined essential characteristics thus guiding the expert 
by proposing only those that are possible at a given moment. 
Task 4: In Tedi Concept editor: update the ontology by 
inserting the newly created concept into the conceptual 
system, i.e., by linking it hierarchically (or associatively) 
with other concepts, supplementing its description by the 
addition of descriptive characteristics, if necessary. Where 
appropriate, new concepts can be introduced for the purposes 
of organizing the conceptual system without there being any 
terms that designate them in the given linguistic system. In 
order to help structure the system, Tedi automatically infers 
the possible generic concepts for a given concept, i.e., their 
intensional definitions, consisting in all their essential 
characteristics, are included in the intensional definition of 
the concept.  
Task 5: In Tedi Term editor: complete the definition of 
terms in different languages. To this end, Tedi proposes 
‘patterned’ definitions in natural language on the basis of the 
formal definition of the concept denoted by the term and its 
terminological hypernym. It remains for the expert to 
45

reformulate them syntactically and put them in their final 
form.  
D. Validation 
Going back to the example, the concept denoted by the 
term “exomis” is defined by the characteristics: /for man/, 
/around body/, /more than one part/, /with sewing/, /without 
sleeves/, 
/attached/, 
/one 
attachment/, 
/knee-length/, 
/unpleated/, /under/. This set of features constitutes the 
formal definition of the concept. Tedi automatically infers 
that this concept counts <Garment around body> and 
<Garment for man> among its possible generic concepts. 
The concept name proposed by Tedi is a concatenation of 
these characteristics: < Garment for man around body more 
than one part with sewing without sleeves attached one 
attachment knee-length unpleated under >. The definition for 
the term ‘exomis’ in English is: “Short and non-pleated 
garment for man, usually worn around the body directly on 
the skin, this sleeveless garment consists of two sewn pieces 
of cloth, attached on the left shoulder leaving naked the right 
shoulder and part of the chest”. The Greek-English Lexicon, 
also known as LSJ (Liddell Scott Jones), which is the 
standard dictionary for scholarly use defines exomis as 
“tunic with one sleeve”. A mere comparison of the two 
definitions illustrates the usefulness of the essential 
characteristics approach. 
VI. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 
To sum up, this paper presented a tool-assisted method 
for the ontologization of terminologies meant for human 
communication, so that they become interpretable also by 
machines. The approach and software presented here reflect 
the need for deeper semantics in the ontological part of a 
representation of reality, so that the represented part and the 
specialized language for human use can be more fully 
interpreted by machines. Tedi can be used to create 
multilingual terminological dictionaries of a domain 
containing definitions for terms in natural language, their 
canonical and inflected forms, and a wealth of related 
unstructured data in the form of notes, contexts of use, 
images, and videos. By combining ontology, terminology, 
and user-friendliness, Tedi software offers the possibility to 
enrich text-based data through semantic annotations. 
Ontoterminologies can be exported into different interchange 
formats including JSON and OWL. An ontoterminology 
mashup and server is currently under way.
