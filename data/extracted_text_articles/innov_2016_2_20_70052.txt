Abstract—Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are finding 
ever-increasing applications in both military and civilian 
systems owing to their self-configuration and self-maintenance 
capabilities. Communications in battlefields and disaster 
recovery are other examples of application environments. 
Many of these applications are security sensitive. As a result, 
security in MANETs has recently been drawing much 
attention. The vast majority of existing solutions that provides 
security services for MANETS does not take into consideration 
the need for authentic access control mechanism as a first line 
of defense to ensure that only the eligible nodes are involved. In 
this work, we propose an anonymous communication scheme 
that is based on an efficient access control mechanism with 
authenticated key establishment. Besides service integration 
offered by this framework, simulations and analysis showed 
that the proposed solution enhance quality of service (QoS) 
level compared to the existing approaches that aims to provide 
only access control or anonymous services separately. With a 
similar or a lower cost, our integrated approach enhanced 
MANET security and performance in comparison with other 
related proposals.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) are an ideal 
technology to deploy spontaneous wireless infrastructureless 
networks, either for military or civilian applications.  
 
Throughout recent years, MANETs have gripped a lot of 
attention due to its dynamic nature to establish wireless 
networks of mobile nodes and wireless routers. The key 
advantage of ad-hoc networks is that the knowledge about 
network topology is not necessary and even more it’s not 
necessary to have an infrastructure. Without any centralized 
entity ad-hoc networks are able to operate in an autonomous 
and spontaneous manner. Also all the required network 
modifications will be done in a self-configurable way.         
 
In order to have a proper function for a mobile ad-hoc 
network and achieve cooperation among all networking 
nodes, it is necessary to limit network access of packet  
 
forwarding and routing to righteous nodes and reject access 
from misbehaving nodes.  However, the network access 
protocols commonly used in traditional infrastructure-based 
networks are not applicable in MANETs due to the lack of 
fixed infrastructure, frequent changes in topology and node 
membership, and finally due to the potential attacks from 
adversaries inside the network itself [1]. This situation 
enforces the need to develop different strategies that suit 
MANET architecture in order to deploy an efficient access 
control mechanism. 
  
Also, the privacy of communication and sensitive 
information has become a serious issue on the Internet. 
Encryption schemes shield the contents of communication, 
but do not hide the fact that two users are communicating. 
In many situations, users may need to make their 
communication anonymous. Sensitive information includes 
the identities of communicating parties, network traffic 
patterns [2]. The leak of such information is often disturbing 
in security-sensitive situations. For example, an unexpected 
change of the traffic pattern in  a  military  network  may  
indicate  a  forthcoming  action,  a  chain  of  commands,  or  
a  state  change  of network alertness [3]. It may also 
disclose the locations of command centers or mobile VIP 
nodes, which will enable the enemies to launch pinpoint 
attacks on them.  In  contrast  to  active  attacks,  which  
usually involve the launch of denial of service or other more 
“visible” and hostile attacks on the target network, traffic  
analysis  is  a  kind  of  passive  attack,  which  is  
“invisible”  and  difficult  to  detect.  It is therefore 
important to design countermeasures against such malicious 
traffic analysis, which leads to the importance of deploying 
an efficient mechanism that ensure communication 
anonymity in MANETs. 
 
In this paper, we address two main concerns in 
MANETs; 
namely 
access 
control 
and 
anonymous 
communication in order to provide a framework for secure 
communication. Most of the work done only provides 
separate solutions for each of the two issues, putting into 
consideration the vitality of the two services as a backbone 
for secure MANET operations. For real life situations, a

MANET administrator should deploy the two services 
separately each with its independent cost. In comparison to 
other monotonic solutions that only provides one service at 
time, we argue that with a similar or even lower cost the 
security services can be highly correlated in a single 
framework that provides MANET nodes with key 
management, access control and anonymous communication 
capabilities.  
The rest of this paper is organized as the follows. In 
Section 2, we provide a background for access control and 
anonymous communication in MANETs and the major 
proposals that dealt with them. In Section 3, we present the 
preliminaries that are utilized in developing our proposed 
solution including elliptical curve with pairing and threshold 
secret sharing basics. In Section 4, we specify the network 
model, and the adversary model for the framework design. 
In Section 5, we present our proposed framework. In 
Section 6, we provide a performance analysis for our 
framework in comparison with existing solution. 
 
II. 
RELATED WORK 
Most of the work provided in the literature provides 
separate solutions for access control and anonymous 
communication schemes; here we provide a background for 
each of them. 
 
A. Access Control 
Access control for MANETS is a challenging task for a 
number of reasons [5]: 
 
First, MANET environment is a distributed problem. 
It does not have a clear defense line like other types 
of networks (wired or cellular) which make it 
difficult to implement the access control mechanism 
at routers or base stations.  
 
Second, it’s preferable that any access control service 
will be available at each node locally in order to 
evade communication over unreliable multihop 
channels.  
 
Third, access control solutions should deal with 
nodes’ misbehavior, as network nodes could already 
hold access control information.  
 
Finally, as node membership in MANET has a 
dynamic nature, the solution has to dynamically deal 
with that.  
 
Kim et al. in [6] presented an early effort to build a 
framework for network access control using cryptographic 
techniques and protocols. Their framework classiﬁes 
admission policy based on the entity which makes the 
admission decisions (external or internal entity). Despite of, 
the simplicity and the relative easiness to support these 
polices, they are inﬂexible and unsuitable for MANETs. 
 
Zhou 
and 
Hass 
[7] 
proposed 
using 
threshold 
cryptography [8] to secure MANETs. They suggested 
distributing CA’s (Certificate Authority) public key to each 
node, while CA’s private key distributed among the subset 
of nodes such that a certain threshold of them can jointly 
perform certiﬁcate generation to the nodes joining the 
network. 
Saxena et al. [9][10] make use of various existing 
threshold signature schemes to build a distributed admission 
control mechanisms for ad-hoc groups, but, they did not 
tackle the problem of group membership revocation.  
 
B. Anonymous communication 
Throughout the literature, a number of anonymous 
communication protocols have been suggested. Most of 
them come from Chaum’s two important approaches: 
mixnet [11] and DC-net [12]. These protocols discussed 
three types of anonymous communication properties: sender 
anonymity, recipient anonymity and relationship anonymity. 
 
Sender anonymity: means that a particular message is 
not linkable to any sender and no message is linkable 
to a particular sender.  
 
Recipient anonymity: similarly means a particular 
message cannot be linked to any recipient and that to a 
specific recipient, no message is linkable 
 
Sender-recipient 
relationship 
anonymity 
(or 
relationship anonymity in short): refers to that the 
sender and the recipient cannot be marked as 
communicating with each other, though it may be 
clear they are participating in some communications. 
 
The mixnet family protocols (e.g., [13][14]) make use of 
special servers that intended to shuffle the received packets 
to make the communication path (including the sender and 
the recipient) unclear “ambiguous” these servers called 
“mix” servers. In order to achieve the desired anonymity, 
these protocols depend on the statistical features of the 
underlying traffic which is also called cover traffic. As a 
result, these protocols are inadequate in dynamic network 
environments like MANETs where trusted servers are 
unavailable.  
 
 
The DC-net family protocols (e.g., [15][16]) use secure 
multi-party computation techniques. They offer verifiable 
anonymity without depending on trusted third parties. 
However, these protocols have transmission collision 
problem which does not have a concrete solution. 
 
III. PROPOSED FRAMEWORK 
The majority of solutions provided to address security of 
mobile ad-hoc networks only tackle one concern at a time 
either it be access control, key management, secure routing, 
anonymous communication, etc.  Our proposed framework 
aims to provide three of the major security services that we 
believe in its importance in order to provide a concrete and 
solid secure framework for MANET operations. Our 
proposed framework provides key management, access

control and anonymous communication and secure in a 
single coherent framework. We firstly introduced this 
framework  at [17] utilizing  the proposed identity based 
cryptography and access control techniques to provide 
crucial 
MANET 
services, 
namely 
address 
auto-
configuration, secure pairwise communication and secure 
group communication.  The main advantage of this 
framework that it provides the mentioned services without 
adding an excessive computational or communication 
overhead compared to existing solution that provides only 
one 
of 
our 
services. 
Our 
proposed 
anonymous 
communication scheme is based on an efficient access 
control mechanism with authenticated key establishment 
using identity based cryptography and threshold secret 
sharing techniques.  
Our mechanism provides its services without any 
assumption of a prefixed trust relationship between nodes, 
which effectively resolves the problem of single point of 
failure in the traditional public key infrastructure. In this 
paper, we present an access control mechanism based on the 
usage of membership access ticket using identity based 
cryptography primitives. Based on the possession of a valid 
access ticket, mobile nodes can get involved in a secure 
communication achieved through our proposed anonymity 
protocol.  
 
We consider a MANET consisting of N nodes, and the 
network size may change dynamically as nodes may join, 
leave, or crash at any time. Each node has a unique non-zero 
ID and assumed to be its MAC address. In order to improve 
system efficiency in terms of communication and 
computation, we employed identity-based cryptography 
(IBC) as an efficient alternative to the traditional public key 
cryptography techniques to provide essential cryptographic 
primitives. 
 
Fig. 1 depicts our framework, at the top layer, resides the 
three 
main 
services; 
access 
control, 
anonymous 
communication which are based on the intermediate layer 
that provides the key management functionality using IBC 
primitives provided by the lower layer.  Hereafter we 
describe protocols used to provide our targeted services. 
We propose four algorithms that provide collectively the 
functionality of key management, access control and 
anonymous communication.  
 
 
A. Key Management and Access control 
Key management functionality in terms of the creation 
of master public key, master private key share, nodes private 
key and new master private key share creation for a new 
node  are accomplished through algorithms 1 , 2 and 3. 
Access control functionality is accomplished based on key 
management and appears in algorithm 2.   
For membership renewal, after the membership access 
ticket (MAT) of a certain node expires, it sends a request to 
K neighbor nodes, where each of them checks node’s 
behavior, then send signed partial membership token. The 
requesting node combines partial signature to acquire its 
new MAT. Nodes behavior observation is out of our scope.  
Membership revocation of MAT happens for one or 
more of the following reasons:  
1. Due to expiry of MAT.  
2. Due to misbehaving or selfishness. 
 
B. Privacy and Anonymous Communication 
It’s widely known that privacy is conflict with 
authentication and certification which achieved only 
through a trusted third party (TTP) registration but in order 
to trace any node that would give out false information there 
must be a registration.  Hence when node X transmit a 
message to node Y, Y needs to check that X is a registered 
and authenticated node through the certificate that escort the 
message X, so that any node can be traced if the need arises. 
The certificate must be signed using certificate authority 
(CA) private key in order to enable Y to check the validity 
of the certificate. But in order to protect communicating 
entities privacy any message sent by one party should 
appear as if sent by another entity so that pseudonyms are 
needed, however the pseudonyms should contain some 
information that let the CA (and only the CA) to determine 
the true identity of its holder. 
 
Algorithm 1 describes the steps carried out by network 
nodes in order to cooperatively produce system’s master 
public key based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). 
Based on the concepts proposed by Pedersen [18], we 
employ ECC to generate the master public key and private 
key share.  In our proposed scheme we operate without any 
trusted authority support, where the master key pair is 
computed jointly by the initial network nodes.  
 
 
Algorithm 1: Master Public Key and Master Private Key 
share   generation 
1. Each node ni randomly chooses a secret xi and a 
polynomial fi(z) of degree k-1, s.t: fi(0)=xi.  
2. Each node ni compute its sub-share for nj as SSij= 
fi(j), j=1,2,3,...  
3. Send SSij securely to nj.

Figure. 1. Proposed Framework. 
 
Algorithm 2 describes the proposed node’s private key 
and access ticket generation process which is the core used 
to provide access control and anonymous communication 
services  in our frame work. For a node J, in order to get its 
private key and acquire a ticket that can be assumed as its 
access key to the network, we assume that, node’s J public 
key (representing node’s identity)  is the hash value of its 
MAC address. Then node J should contact at least k of its 
neighbor nodes presenting its identity (identity-based 
cryptography) and request private key generation service 
(PKG) (if J was unable to find k neighbors locally, node J 
would move (roam) to another location). Since all network 
nodes share the master private key, any node can be a 
service node.  
Each of k nodes generates a share of the new private 
key SKij and sends it to node j, which in turn combine all the 
shares to generate its new private key SKj. For 
authentication, as the new node joins the network it presents 
any required physical proof. And upon authentication by 
any t nodes, each node of them generate a partial 
membership access ticket  MATj
i using its share of the 
master private key Si on on the public key of the node 
appended with the expiry time of this ticket Exp_timej and 
its issuing time Tj.  
Upon reception of partial tickets node J combines then 
in order to get its access ticket MATj.  Using MATj node J 
can participate in further network actions and services

Algorithm 2: Private Key and access ticket generation 
 
1. Node J Public key Qj=H (MAC_ADD).  
2. Node J Contact at least k nodes and get SKij=SiQj . 
3. Node J compute its private key as SKJ= ∑ 𝑆𝑖𝑄𝑗

Node 
J 
combine 
partial 
tickets 
as 
𝑀𝐴𝑇𝑗=∑
 
𝑡
𝑖=1 𝑆𝑖 H(𝑄𝑗||Exp_time𝑗||𝑇𝑗)  
 
Algorithm 3 describes steps carried out to enable a new 
node n to get a new share of the master private key, in order 
to participate in network services. Any coalition of K 
existing nodes can jointly participate in the process. Each of 
the participating nodes create a partial share 𝑆𝑖,n and send it 
to the new node which accumulate those shares in order to 
get its share of Master Private Key.   
 
 
Algorithm 3: New Master Private Key share creation for 
new node n  
1. Each node i of k generate partial share as 𝑆𝑖,n = Si li(𝑛), 
li(𝑛) is Lagrange coefficient.  
2. Each node i send the share to node n. 
3. Node n adds shares to get Sn=∑
𝑆𝑖,𝑛
𝑘
𝑖=1
 
 
 
So, the true identity of a node should not be known or 
readable to any other node. A certified authority (or a 
trusted party) should sign the pseudonym to ensure that it 
has a trusted signature in order to achieve privacy and 
authentication. In order to overcome limitations imposed by 
CA-based architecture, we armed our security framework 
with an anonymity and privacy features through the usage of 
the proposed security architecture that utilize identity based 
cryptography and threshold cryptography in order to the 
achieve security goals. 
 
Since that our proposed framework’s design supports 
services flow, the privacy and anonymity features are built 
upon the ability of the node to have a righteous access 
control through steps accomplished through Algorithm 1 
and algorithm 2.      
 
In our proposed anonymity solution, for two parties 
Alice and Bob to communicate anonymously they use 
pseudonyms to conceal their identity as Carol and Dale. 
Alice starts with creating an alias identifier rather than its 
true identity as Carol, with this it creates an alias public key 
(PKals) and its corresponding alias private key (PrKals).  
Then perform the following steps described in algorithm 4.

Algorithm 4: Privacy and Anonymous Communication 
 
1. Alice generate an alias id (carol) , alias public key 
(PKals) and alias private key (PrKals) 
2. Alice sign its MAT with its system generated private 
key SKalice as its original certificate Original_Cert = 
𝑺𝑰𝑮𝑺𝑲𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒄𝒆(MATalice) 
3. Alice encrypt Original_Cert combined with its system 
public key Qalice and a timestamp TS, with system 
master public key Qn, producing a system authenticator 
Sys_Auth= 𝑬𝑸𝒏  (𝑶𝒓𝒊𝒈𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒍_𝑪𝒆𝒓𝒕 || Qalice || TS), TS 
change each time to make Sys_Auth looks different 
each time.      
4. Alice send a message M = (PKals, Sys_Auth,

partial signature.  
5. Each of the K nodes, checks signature correctness 
using PKals  and sign the digest of the message (PKals, 
Sys_Auth) using its share of the master private key Si 
and return it to carol (Alice) 
Note: none of the signing nodes can know the identity 
of the requesting node (Alice), all it do that it sign on 
the combination Sys_auth and PKals and that they 
belong to the same identity.

its private key (algorithm 2).

For Bob when he receives the message: 
1. Use system public key Qn to verify signature on 
carol’s certificate. 
2. If carol’s certificate is valid PKals is considered 
authentic and used to authenticate (verify) 
signature on carol’s signed hash to get

3. If message is encrypted using Bob’s alias PK, 
he uses his alias private key to decrypt the 
message. 
 
For Bob to replay as Dale: 
1. Do the same steps to get his alias certificate. 
2. Send [Dale’s Certificate|| H(carol’s message)

In case of the existence of a misbehaving node, our 
model requires the existence of some arbitrator or some 
reference entity to manage resolving the issue. If a threshold 
number of nodes (R) complain about an anonymous node 
(X), then this node is stripped out of its anonymity to find 
out its true identity to take the proper actions against. In 
order to resolve the dispute, a need to reveal the true identity 
of a misbehaving node (ex. carol) is aroused, and the 
following steps are carried out:

The arbitrator decrypt Sys_Auth by sending it to K 
nodes where each node uses its share of the master 
private key and the arbitrator combines the 
responses.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS 
As stated earlier existing security solutions for 
MANET provide security services separately. In our 
pervious papers [17] we provided a detailed performance 
analysis for our proposed framework in terms of access 
control and key management. In this Section, we provide 
a performance analysis for the integrated protocol for 
anonymous communication. 
 
A. Comparison with Some Existing Schemes 
We provide here a comparison for our proposed 
protocol with some existing solutions for anonymity in 
MANET, namely OR[19], Crowds[20],  BUS[21], 
KMAT[22]. 
 
Like mixnet-based protocols (OR, Crowds), our 
proposed solution provides anonymity to the sender and 
the receiver. Also they do not account on the statistical 
characteristics of the underlying traffic. Both hide the 
sender and the receiver from each other. Our proposed 
solution is more efficient than BUS in terms of overhead 
as our solution is O(N2) while BUS is O(N3), where N is 
number of the nodes in the network. And unlike BUS our 
solution permits the receiver to reply without able to 
identify sender identity and provides broadcasting 
messages anonymously.  
 
In comparison to KMAT, our proposal achieves the 
same level of anonymity with a lower communication 
overhead.  
 
Table 1 shows a comparison in terms of latency and 
overhead between our proposed solution and the existing 
ones (where I is the number of intermediate nodes, and N 
is the number of the nodes in the network). We can 
conclude that the proposed solution provides an enhanced 
anonymity in comparison with current anonymous 
communication protocols, where with the same or less 
communication overhead it provides the same anonymity 
level. 
 
B.  Security analysis   
Our solution achieved the three types of anonymous 
communication properties:  
 
Sender 
anonymity: 
where 
none 
of 
the 
transmitted messages can be linked to any 
sender. 
 
Recipient anonymity: where none of the 
messages can be linked to a certain recipient 
 
Sender-recipient 
relationship 
anonymity: 
Even it may be clear that two entities are 
involved in a communication, but they cannot be 
identified as communicating with each other.   
 
Those three anonymities called full anonymities, as an 
attacker cannot infer any knowledge about the a sender, 
a receiver or the communicating parties of any 
transferred messages from a current traffic   
 
V. 
CONCLUSION  
In this paper, we proposed a secure anonymous 
communication scheme for MANETs based upon 
authenticated access control mechanism that ensures the 
proper behavior within MANET as only nodes with rights 
to access the network will be involved, which enhances 
the reliability of the other security functions. The 
proposed scheme has many advantages over existing 
solutions as it provides a concrete framework for access 
control, key management and anonymous communication 
based on ideas from threshold secret sharing and ID-based 
cryptography. As results shows the proposed scheme is 
more efficient than the previously proposed solution for 
anonymity in addition to the extended capabilities of the 
proposed framework which also support access control 
and key management services which can be further 
extended to provide more security service for MNAETs.   
Due to the usage of threshold and identity based 
cryptography our proposed framework exhibits an 
optimized performance feature. Throughout this work we 
showed how we can enforce access control through 
making it a mandatory component in order to get access 
to other services like anonymous communication. The 
deliverables from the access control stage is used as a key 
in the subsequent stage in a way that make smooth service 
integration. Measurement 
results 
and 
performance 
analysis indicate that our solution provides an integrated 
framework for secure communication with an overall 
performance that outcome existing solutions, which make 
it more suitable in MANET environment.
