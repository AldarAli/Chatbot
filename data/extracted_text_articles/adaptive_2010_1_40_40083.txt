Abstract— Cooperative communication techniques have been 
proposed in order to improve the quality of the received signals 
at the receivers by using the diversity added by duplication of 
signals sent by relay terminals situating between each 
transmission 
pair. 
This 
paper 
proposes 
an 
adaptive 
cooperation technique for frame transmissions in Ad Hoc 
networks that is compatible to both of the basic access mode 
and the optional access mode of IEEE 802.11 Medium Access 
Control (MAC) protocol. The transmission mode for each data 
frame is adaptively switched between a cooperative mode and 
a non-cooperative mode based on the absence of acknowledge 
(ACK) 
frame. 
Simulations 
show 
that 
transmission 
performance is improved by decreasing the number of re-
transmissions due to frame errors; thus, chances of multi-hop 
mode transitions that are costly in time and bandwidth are 
alleviated. The analysis of the proposition performance 
indicates the interest of the adaptation paradigm. It puts 
forward that, in addition to the channel quality parameter, the 
channel availability parameter must be concerned in the 
adaptation process.

 INTRODUCTION 
In wireless communications, fading causes errors on data 
transmissions. Based on IEEE 802.11 MAC standard, re-
transmission processes are required when error data frames 
are detected. Obviously, re-transmissions increase delay and 
decrease the packet delivery ratio (PDR) of the networks. 
More precisely, in multi-hop networks, if the re-transmission 
counter (Re-Tx) reaches the threshold, a route recovery 
process is activated. For example, considering Ad Hoc On-
Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [1], the 
route recovery process is done by an AODV source-initiated 
route re-discovery method. The source terminal (S) 
broadcasts a route request (RREQ) packet to re-find a route 
to the destination terminal (D). The RREQ packet will be re-
broadcasted through the network. Therefore, the network is 
flooded and is led to network congestion problems. 
In addition, if the route re-discovery process occurs when 
the direct path (S-to-D) is dropped, instead of receiving the 
RREQ packet from S, D receives the RREQ packet from an 
intermediate terminal (I) locating between S and D terminals. 
Thus, the transmission mode is switched from direct 
transmission mode to multi-hop transmission mode as shown 
in Fig.1. Rather than directly transmits a data frame from S 
to D in one time slot, the multi-hop transmission requires 
two time slots to send this data frame from S to I and from I 
to D, respectively. Therefore, similar to re-transmissions, 
multi-hop transmissions also increase the delay and decrease 
the PDR of the networks. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Transmission mode transitions. 
Since multi-hop mode transitions happen when the Re-
Tx counter of the direct mode transmission (Rx-TxDirect) 
reaches the threshold, transmission performance of the direct 
mode must be improved in order to reduce the number of re-
transmissions. Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) is an 
example of transmission techniques that have been proposed 
to 
improve 
transmission 
performance 
in 
wireless 
communications. MIMO provide advantages of spatial 
diversity by uncorrelated signal components generated from 
antenna array at a source terminal and/or a destination 
terminal. However, each antenna in the antenna array must 
be separated at least λ/2 in order to provide independent 
signals. λ is the wave length of the system signal and it can 
be calculated as follows;  
 
cf
λ = c
                                            (1) 
Where c is a speed of light (3x108 m/s) and fc is a carrier 
frequency. Thus, for commonly used 2.4GHz frequency 
band, the space between antennas at 6.125 cm is required. 
These requirements make MIMO technique to be impractical 
to employ in networks with small wireless terminals such as 
sensor networks. In addition, MIMO requires multiple 
antennas, which are costly. For these kinds of contexts, 
cooperative 
communications 
provide 
an 
interesting

alternative that can gain benefits of spatial diversity while a 
single antenna is required on each terminal. Illustrations of 
MIMO and cooperative transmissions are respectively shown 
in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b.

Cooperative transmissions have been introduced by [2] to 
[4]. The concept of cooperative transmissions is to exploit 
the broadcast nature of the wireless medium and to transform 
single-antenna neighbour nodes, to work as virtual antenna 
arrays. As shown in Fig. 3, cooperative transmissions (Fig. 
3b) utilize more medium than non-cooperative transmissions 
(Fig. 3a) when the channel quality of the direct path (S-to-D) 
is good. However, if the channel quality of the direct path is 
dropped, non-cooperative transmissions with re-transmission 
processes (Fig. 3c) consumes more medium than cooperative 
transmissions. Therefore, cooperative transmissions are 
interesting and should be used when the channel quality of 
the direct path is dropped. Rather than remain the 
transmission mode in cooperative mode (named fixed 
cooperative transmission), cooperative transmissions should 
be able to switch their transmission modes between 
cooperative 
mode 
and 
non-cooperative 
one. 
These 
cooperative transmissions are called adaptive cooperative 
transmissions.

(b) Cooperative transmissions and (c) Non-cooperative transmissions with 
re-transmission processes. 
In adaptive cooperative transmissions, generally inspired 
from the IEEE 802.11 MAC standard [5], the activation and 
deactivation of these cooperative transmission modes require 
extra control frames, which are modified from Request-To-
Send (RTS) or Clear-To-Send (CTS) frames [6] and [7] 
and/or are created in new frame formats [8] and [9]. These 
adaptive cooperative transmissions cannot be implemented 
in IEEE 802.11 networks with basic access mode and also 
have interoperability problems with legacy systems. 
For example, the message flow of an adaptive 
cooperative transmission protocol called CoopMAC [6] is 
shown in Fig. 4. CoopMAC uses CoopRTS frames (modified 
from RTS frames), HTS frames (Helper ready To Send, 
modified from CTS frame), and CTR frames to activate and 
deactivate cooperative transmission modes among terminals. 
Therefore, CoopMAC can be implemented only in the 
optional access mode of IEEE 802.11 networks. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Message flows in CoopMAC protocol [6]. 
To overcome these problems, we propose a simple but 
effective transmission method called Adaptive Cooperation 
Multi-Hop Transmission (ACMHT). In order to have our 
proposition compatibly work with terminals without 
cooperative functionality in legacy systems, only some 
process modifications are required and affect only the nodes 
with cooperative functionality. In addition, our method does 
not use or modify RTS or CTS frames; therefore, it can work 
compatibly with both of the basic and the optional access 
methods of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. Transmission 
mode of ACMHT can be switched between cooperative and 
non-cooperative mode based on the absence of ACK frames. 
Our proposition intends to increase the link quality by a 
cooperative mechanism, and also to prevent unnecessary 
routing processes such as route maintenance and re-route 
discovery. In addition, the proposed method alleviates 
probability of multi-hop mode transitions in order to reduce 
costs of multi-hop mode transmissions. To evaluate the 
interest of our proposition, the transmission performance in 
term of PDR is considered. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, details of the proposition are presented. Section III is 
devoted to the system model while Section IV concerns with 
simulation results and analysis. Finally, the conclusion is 
drawn in Section V. 
II. 
ADAPTIVE COOPERATIVE MULTI-HOP TRANSMISSION 
Our proposition is designed for a WiFi network using an 
IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. For interoperability purposes, 
rather than specifying a new protocol, we decided to derive 
benefit from the handshaking access mechanisms to activate 
or deactivate the cooperative mode. Mechanisms of ACMHT 
when it works with the basic access method (also called two-
way handshaking; Data/ACK) are shown in Fig. 5a and Fig. 
5b and with the optional access method (also called four-way 
handshaking; RTS/CTS/Data/ACK) are shown in Fig. 5c and 
Fig. 5d. S, R, and D stand for Source, Relay, and Destination 
respectively. R is assumed to be chosen and is located in the 
transmission ranges of S and D. Fig. 5a and Fig. 5c represent 
ACMHT message flows when it works in a non-cooperative 
transmission mode and when it works in a cooperative 
transmission mode are shown in Fig. 5b and Fig. 5d. 
The proposition is adaptive because its transmission 
mode is able to switch between a direct mode and a 
cooperative multi-hop mode. The appearance of an ACK

frame informs R that the direct transmission is successful; 
thus, cooperative multi-hop mode is automatically turned off. 
The network transmission mode rests at the direct 
transmission mode. R remains quiet and S continues to 
transmit its next data frame in the direct path.

Figure 5.  Message flows of our proposition (ACMHT). 
On the contrary, in Fig. 5b and 4d, when D fails to 
decode a data frame and the network allocation vector 
(NAV) of R reaches to zero, the cooperative multi-hop mode 
transmission of the ACMHT is automatically turned on. The 
transmission mode of the network is temporally switched 
from direct mode to cooperative multi-hop mode as shown in 
Fig. 6. Without any changes in the header, R helps S to 
forward the data to D, and then the transmission mode of the 
network is automatically switched back to the direct mode. If 
D successfully decodes the data sent from R, it replies an 
ACK back to S. The Re-Tx counter at S is reset, and then S 
sends its next data frame. When the Re-Tx counter is reset, 
chances of multi-hop mode transition are alleviated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6.  Transmission mode transition of ACMHT. 
A MAC layer table is specified at terminal R in order to 
allow R to be able to filter and relay data frames sent from S 
to D correctly. MAC addresses of the transmission pair (S 
and D) are indicated in the table. These addresses are 
acquired by upper layer protocols such as Hello or routing 
protocols in the network layer. For data relaying, MAC layer 
relaying is chosen instead of network layer forwarding. R 
acts as a dynamical bridge since forwarded data frames do 
not need to be sent up to the network layer; thus, queuing 
delays and processing delays are alleviated. R directly 
forward exactly the same data frame (received from S) to D 
through its MAC layer. In addition, after forwarding the data, 
R does not need to wait ACK frames from D.  
If adaptive cooperative transmission done by R is also 
fail or the ACK frame sent from D is lost, S waits until its 
retransmission timer reaches to zero, then the data is 
retransmitted. To prevent collision between re-transmissions 
done by S and cooperative multi-hip transmissions done by 
R, S must extend its timeout at least two times of the value 
indicated in IEEE 802.11 MAC standard. 
For simplicity, similar to [6] [7] [10] and [11], in our 
proposition, the received signals at the destination terminal 
transmitted by S and R are not combined. If signal 
combinations in signal-level are needed, signal combiners 
such as maximum ratio combiners require fading amplitudes 
and phase compensations of the source and the relay 
terminals at both of transmitter and receiver sides [12]. These 
requirements 
cause 
system 
complexities. 
Moreover, 
additional hardware such as a signal combiner at the receiver 
side is required and it gains cost to the system. 
III. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The performance evaluation of the proposed method is 
done by simulations and compared with a non-cooperative 
transmission. NS 2.30 simulator is used [13]. Effects of 
channel quality and channel availability to ACMHT 
performance are studied. Three scenarios of 5-terminal 
networks (see Fig. 7) and a scenario of a 9-terminal network 
(see Fig. 8) are simulated. In Fig. 7a, a scenario in which 
only the relay terminal (R) is interfered by an A-B 
transmission pair is presented. Assume that the channel 
between A and B is perfect. Scenarios that all terminals (S, 
R, and D) are interfered and only R is not interfered are 
illustrated in Fig. 7b and Fig. 7c respectively. Note that 
terminals locating in the interference area cannot correctly 
decode received signals but they are interfered.

Figure 8.  A scenario of a 9-terminal network. 
To study the effects of channel quality to the ACMHT 
transmission performance in term of PDR, channel quality in 
term of error probabilities in the direct path (Si to Di) and the 
multi-hop paths (Si to Ri and Ri to Di) are varied. The frame 
error probabilities of the direct path (P1) are set at 0.1 and 
0.2 per frame, while those of the multi-hop paths (P2) varied 
from 0.025 to 0.4 per frame. For physical channels, the two 
ray ground propagation model is used while IEEE 802.11 
[5], and AODV [1] are used as the MAC, and the routing 
protocols. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) agents are 
created to send Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffic with data 
rate 448kbps and packet size equals to 210 bytes. The 
simulation time is 300 seconds. 
IV. 
SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
In the first scenario of the 5-terminal networks, where 
only the terminal R is interfered by the A-B transmission 
pair, there is no transmission state transition in both of non-
cooperative 
and 
ACMHT 
transmissions; 
thus, 
the 
percentages of data frames sent in multi-hop mode equal to 
zero as shown in Fig. 9. The x-axis represents values of P1 
over P2 (P1/P2). The frame error probability of the direct 
path (P1) is set at 0.1 and 0.2 per frame and the frame error 
probability of each proxy path (P2) is varied from 0.03 to 0.4 
per frame.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9.  The percentage of data frames sent in multi-hop mode in 
scenario 1 of the 5-terminal networks. 
PDRs of the systems with non-cooperative and ACMHT 
transmission in different link quality configurations are 
shown in Fig. 10. The PDRs of ACMHT are less than those 
of the non-cooperative transmission because of the effect of 
the extended timeout in ACMHT. If the quality of the multi-
hop paths is not good and R cannot relay data to D 
efficiently, S in ACMHT has to re-transmit the data with the 
extended timeout, which causes longer delay comparing to 
the 
re-transmission 
processes 
in 
non-cooperative 
transmissions. Therefore, in non-cooperative transmissions, 
if there is no transmission state transition from direct mode 
to multi-hop mode, ACMHT is not interesting. The PDRs of 
the non-cooperative transmission are nearly constant because 
all data are sent in the direct mode; thus, the performance of 
the system is only function of the link quality of the direct 
path. The increasing of P2 does not affect the performance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10.  PDR of non-cooperative and ACMHT transmissions in  
scenario 1 of the 5-terminal networks. 
In the second scenario of the 5-terminal networks, where 
all terminals are interfered by the A-B transmission pair, 
transmission state transitions occur in both of non-
cooperative and ACMHT transmissions (see Fig. 11). 
However, the percentage of data frames in ACMHT that are 
sent in multi-hop mode is very less compared with the non-
cooperative transmission. The result confirms that ACMHT 
can alleviate multi-hop transmission mode transitions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 11.  The percentage of data frames sent in multi-hop mode in 
scenario 2 of the 5-terminal networks. 
In Fig. 12, ACMHT generally has higher PDRs than 
those of the non-cooperative transmission. Thus, we can 
conclude that ACMHT is interesting when every terminal 
has same condition of channel availability and there are 
chances of transmission mode transition in non-cooperative 
transmission to transit from direct mode to multi-hop mode. 
On the left-hand side of Fig. 12 when P1= 0.2, the PDR 
of ACMHT is lower than that of non-cooperative

transmission because channel qualities of the multi-hop paths 
are very poor. This problem leads to two major drawbacks. 
First, when R missed-hears ACK packets, it competes with S 
to transmit data; thus, the collisions are occurred. Second, R 
is not able to help S on data relaying because it is unable to 
decode the data frame sent from S; therefore, D has to wait 
for the re-transmission done by S after the extended timeout, 
which is twice longer than the non-cooperative technique.

In the third scenario of the 5-terminal networks, where 
only the terminal R is not interfered by the A-B transmission 
pair, transmission state transitions occur in non-cooperative 
transmission but not in ACMHT. The percentage of data 
frames in ACMHT that are sent in multi-hop mode equals to 
zero while non-cooperative transmission has high percentage 
of data frames sent in multi-hop mode, as shown in Fig. 13.  
Thus, 
probabilities of 
multi-hop transmission 
mode 
transitions are alleviated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 13.  The percentage of data frames sent in multi-hop mode in 
scenario 3 of the 5-terminal networks. 
Similar to the second case, ACMHT is interesting when 
there are chances of transmission state transition from direct 
mode to multi-hop mode. In addition, since R is not 
interfered by the A-B transmission pair, it can well perform 
on data relaying. Therefore, ACMHT is outperformed and 
has higher PDR compared to the non-cooperative 
transmission as shown in Fig. 14 when P1= 0.1.  However, 
on the right-hand side of Fig. 14 when P1= 0.2 and multi-hop 
paths have very high channel qualities, ACMHT yields lower 
PDR than that of the non-cooperative transmission because 
the terminal D in ACMHT has to reply ACK frames through 
the direct path with P1= 0.2 while the non-cooperative 
transmission works in multi-hop mode and its ACK frames 
are sent through the multi-hop paths with P2 < 0.1. 
In the third scenario of the 5-terminal networks, we can 
conclude that ACMHT is interesting when terminal R has 
good condition on channel availability and there are chances 
of 
transmission 
mode 
transition 
in 
non-cooperative 
transmission to transit from direct mode to multi-hop mode. 
However, if the channel qualities of the multi-hop paths are 
much higher than that of the direct path, ACMHT should 
switch its transmission mode from direct mode and 
cooperative multi-hop mode to multi-hop mode. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 14.  PDR of non-cooperative and ACMHT transmissions in  
scenario 3 of the 5-terminal networks. 
In the 9-terminal network, the x-axis represents values of 
P1 over P2 (P1/P2). P1 is set at 0.1 and 0.2 per frame and P2 
is varied from 0.025 to 0.4 per frame. Transmission state 
transitions occur in both of non-cooperative and ACMHT 
transmissions. However, the percentage of data frames in 
ACMHT that are sent in multi-hop mode is very less 
compared with non-cooperative transmission (see Fig. 15). 
Thus, the probabilities of multi-hop transmission mode 
transitions are also alleviated in the 9-terminal network.

of the proxy paths are worse than those of the direct paths, 
the PDR of ACMHT is lower than those of the non-
cooperative transmissions because of two major reasons. 
First, because of the collisions generated by R when it

missed-hears ACK packets. Ri competes with Si on data 
transmissions. Second, due to the extended re-transmission 
time introduced by the inefficient relay transmission; i.e., Ri 
should be activated to help Si, but it is also unable to decode 
the data frame; thus, Di has to wait for the re-transmission 
done by Si after the extended timeout, which is twice longer 
than that of the non-cooperative technique, reaches to zero. 
Nevertheless, when the link qualities of the proxy paths are 
increased, the PDRs of ACMHT are continually increased. 
In some ranges of P1/P2, the ACMHT provides higher PDRs 
than those of the non-cooperative transmissions. 
In contrast, when the link qualities of the proxy paths are 
increased, the PDRs of for non-cooperative transmissions are 
decreased due to multi-hop transmission delays. However, 
when multi-hop paths have very high channel qualities 
compared to the direct path, transmissions through multi-hop 
paths are more interesting than re-transmissions through the 
direct paths with low channel qualities. Thus, on the right-
hand side of Fig. 16, the PDRs of non-cooperative 
transmissions are increased when the number of multi-hop 
transmissions is increased. 
Similar to the third scenario of the 5-terminal networks, 
the crossing point on the right-hand side of Fig. 16 when  
P1= 0.2 and multi-hop paths have very high channel 
qualities, ACMHT yields a little bit lower PDR than that of 
the non-cooperative transmission because the terminal Di in 
ACMHT has to reply ACK frames through the direct path 
with P1= 0.2 while the non-cooperative transmission works 
in multi-hop mode and its ACK frames are sent through the 
multi-hop paths with P2 < 0.053.

Therefore, to improve the performance of ACMHT, 
rather than to switch the transmission mode of ACMHT 
based only on the absence of ACK frames, both of channel 
qualities and channel availabilities of the direct path and 
multi-hop paths must be considered. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, an adaptive cooperative multi-hop 
transmission that can work compatibly with the legacy 
systems and is compatible to both of the basic and the 
optional access methods of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol 
is proposed. Beyond the proposition, the interest of the 
presented work concerns the study of the proposition validity 
that leads to determine some adaptation rules. 
From simulation results, it is shown that ACMHT 
transmission mode must be adaptable. The proposed method 
outperforms the non-cooperative transmissions in terms of 
transmission performance (evaluated by PDR), when channel 
distributions of the direct path (S-to-D) can cause multi-hop 
mode transitions in non-cooperative transmissions and a 
good relay is selected. A good relay means a relay terminal 
having high channel availability and high channel quality of 
its cooperative multi-hop paths (S-to-R and R-to-D) 
Thus, the control protocol in charge of relay selection 
(AODV routing protocol for Ad Hoc networks or Hybrid 
Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP) for wireless mesh 
networks for examples) has to collect information on channel 
qualities by measuring the frame SNR, and we also conclude 
that it has to collect information of channel availabilities by 
measuring for example the number of frames overheard by 
each potential relay terminal.
