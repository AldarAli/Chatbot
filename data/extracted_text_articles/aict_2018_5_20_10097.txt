Abstract—In 
this 
paper, 
we 
present 
two 
basic 
communication techniques for Internet of Things (IoT), as well 
as a new software-based solution to increase the receiver 
sensitivity and to improve the communication link budget. The 
methodology and the experimental results are also presented at 
the end. The complexity of the experimental setup is reduced, 
but it demonstrates how a simple method may be efficient for 
very low SNR. We apply the Time Synchronous Averaging 
(TSA) as a powerful signal processing technique to improve 
receiver sensibility. This technique is very useful for the 
constraints 
which 
occur 
during 
narrow 
band 
RF 
communications. The most important disadvantage of TSA is 
due to synchronization. To overcome this problem, an 
innovative signal processing method for synchronization in 
phase and in frequency is applied. The result of Averaging 
applied with innovative synchronization method, is the 
remarkable enhancement in signal detection in the presence of 
a very strong noise (Signal to Noise ratio near zero). The 
proposed solution can also be applied on large band 
transmissions.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The communication between the objects, Machine-to-
Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT), is the 
revolutionary movement toward controlling almost all the 
aspects of costs and resources. IoT could also help us 
overcome the global challenges like environmental 
pollution, resource depletion and energy crisis [1]. IoT 
applications vary between several sectors and consist 
mainly: smart cities, tele-operation, smart metering, 
industrial assets and critical infrastructure monitoring, 
logistics, home automation and also agriculture and wild life 
tracking. Several studies have proven the huge growth in 
volume and revenue of the IoT and M2M. The number of 
connected objects is predicted to surpass the number of 
human subscribers using smart phones, tablets, laptop and 
PCs by 2020 [2].  The overall IoT market is also expected to 
reach a revenue of 4.3 trillion dollars by 2043 [3]. Cellular 
networks 
and 
wireless 
short 
range 
communication 
technologies were traditionally used for IoT application. 
These two techniques are limited by their short range of 
communications or the vast power consumption. Low 
Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) as a novel 
communication paradigm has been examined as a solution 
for increasing the communication range while increasing the 
power efficiency. In the IoT applications, the size of the 
data packet is very small and therefore the data rate is 
considered to be lower than data rate in Cellular networks. 
Lowering the data rate could help us achieving the higher 
communication range. A brief demonstration of the 
relationship between the different communication standards, 
their data rates and the communication ranges is shown in 
Figure 1. Unlike the data packet size, which is not an issue 
for IoT applications, the power efficiency, data range and 
the ability to communicate with large number of devices are 
the most important concerns in this domain. There are 
various techniques employed by LPWAN technologies to 
satisfy the desire conditions of IoT.  
The desired link budget for LPWAN technologies is 
about 150±10 dB which is sufficient to cover a range of few 
kilometers for urban areas and tens of kilometers for rural 
areas. There is always the compromise between the data rate 
and the energy consumption. The receiver should be capable 
of decoding the noisy and weak signals. The sensitivity of 
such a receiver reaches as low as -130 dBm. Different 
LPWAN technologies are based on two main modulation 
techniques, narrowband and spread spectrum techniques. 
 
Figure 1. Data rate vs communication range 
Assigning a narrow band to each carrier provides a 
higher link budget. The experienced noise is reduced as 
well. This will give us a far greater range of communication. 
However the data rate is also reduced. The main difficulty 
of narrowband communication is the frequency generation

systems. This is mostly related to the oscillator’s stability 
and phase noise. It is hard to achieve the frequency 
synchronization in the case of very weak signals at the 
receiver. 
On the other hand, the spread spectrum technique spread 
the information signal over a wider frequency band but 
keeps the same power. This communication is more robust 
to interference and jamming. However, this technique is less 
efficient in terms of spectrum usage. SIGFOX and LoRa are 
two well-known examples of technologies, which use 
Narrowband and Spread spectrum techniques, respectively. 
Here, we introduce a novel technique to increase the 
receiver sensitivity. In consequence the increase in receiver 
sensitivity will cause more power efficiency as well as 
longer ranger of communication. The proposed method is 
applicable for both LPWAN technologies (Narrowband and 
spread spectrum). In state-of-the-art TSA approaches, the 
same information is transmitted K times. The signal must 
have sufficient energy to be correctly synchronized in 
receiver before averaging. There is a high risk of data 
distortion in averaging process in case of losing the 
synchronization. The most important advantage of our 
method is its robustness to the noise for achieving the 
synchronization. In simulations we had a non-zero two-way 
communication for SNR = -37 dB while in practical 
measurement, due to some physical limits we achieve a 
level of SNR = 0.3 dB. These limits and the solution to 
remove them are explained at the end of the article.     
 
II. TIME SYNCHRONOUS AVERAGING  
The sensitivity of a digital receiver is the minimum input 
signal power PMIN in dBm required for a particular quality of 
the received information in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) 
[4]. 
 
Pmin= -174 + 10 log (B) + NF + SNR  
(1) 
NF is the noise figure, B is the receiver equivalent noise 
bandwidth, and SNR is the detector input signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) needed to achieve a fixed BER. 
The smaller contribution of the receiver, which means the 
lower power to encode the receiving signal is mostly 
translated to the better sensitivity. 
By using advanced signal processing methods, we are 
capable of increasing the receiver sensitivity. Since the 
processing method is a software technique there is no need 
to change any in-use hardware. Coherent averaging is a 
software processing method to apply on the coherent 
component (a periodic signal). The received signal is 
damaged by a non-coherent component (stationary additive 
noise) [5]. An uncorrelated stationary white Gaussian noise 
is supposed to affect the data during the transmission. 
Averaging the repeated data at the receiver node will reduce 
the noise power K times. [6][7].  Let s(t) is a periodic signal 
with period T and power PS, and n(t), an additive white 
Gaussian noise (AWGN) with variance σn
2 . The signal to-
noise ratio SNR is: 
 
𝑆𝑁𝑅 = 
𝑃𝑆
σ𝑛2  
(2) 
By averaging the K signals synchronously, the SNR of 
the averaged signal becomes [5]: 
 
𝑆𝑁𝑅𝑇𝑆𝐴 = 
𝑃𝑆
(σ𝑛2
𝐾 )
= 𝐾. 𝑆𝑁𝑅 
 (3) 
TSA is widely used in communications [8], medicine 
[9], mechanics [10], electronics and all scientific fields 
which treat periodic weak signals corrupted by noise [11]. 
III. METHODOLOGY 
The most critical problem of averaging method is related 
to the synchronization. This is also the main issue for using 
the narrowband receivers. 
Synchronization for averaging concerns synchronization 
in phase and in frequency. These correspond to the data 
repetition period and data stream starting point. It is very 
difficult to recognize and distinguish the data period and 
data start point when the noise power becomes very strong 
in comparison to the signal power (low SNR). In reality we 
cannot apply averaging anymore since there is no 
information about start and end of each period. Here we use 
an innovative software signal processing method to achieve 
the synchronization. This method is based on the periodic 
behavior of the signal. The main stages for applying this 
technique are shown in Figure 2.  
 
 
Figure 2. Principle of the Time Synchronous Averaging 
 
The novel signal processing technique has been realized 
by MATLAB. For the experimental measurement, a signal 
generator is used to generate a series of data which are 
periodic. 
 
The incoming data will be registered in a memory block. 
The synchronization block and the memory block work in 
parallel. The synchronization block drives also the 
averaging and comparator blocks. The output is a multi-
level signal. The comparator converts it to the binary data 
signal. The modulation type and the SNR at the comparator 
(threshold circuit) input define the BER at the receiver 
output.  
 
The BER for the minimum shift key (MSK) modulation, 
which is very common for low data rate communication 
systems, in the presence of AWGN is [6]: 
 
𝐵𝐸𝑅 = 𝑄 (√2
𝐸𝐵
𝑁0)  
(4) 
 
EB is the energy per bit and N0 is the noise power spectral 
density. The last equation is valid only if we consider a 
perfect synchronization for the coherent demodulator / 
matched filter. The noise power Pn is:  
 
𝑃𝑛 = 𝑁0𝐵𝑛

Bn is the equivalent noise bandwidth of the Demodulator 
/ Filter circuit in Figure 2. Using (2), (3) and (5) (D is the 
data rate in bit/s.): 
 
𝐸𝐵
𝑁0 =
𝑃𝑆
𝑃𝑛 
𝐵𝑛
𝐷 = 𝑆𝑁𝑅𝑇𝑆𝐴
𝐵𝑛
𝐷 = 𝐾. 𝑆𝑁𝑅
𝐵𝑛

As we can see the TSA method improves the SNR at the 
comparator input K times and the corresponding BER is: 
 
𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑆𝐴 = 𝑄 (√2𝐾
𝐸𝐵
𝑁0) 
(7) 
K is the number of retransmission of the data frame. This 
repetition will increase K times the energy per bit since each 
bit is repeated K times. It is good to notice that the 
transmitted power remains the same. This is one of the 
important 
advantages 
of 
this 
method 
since 
the 
communication standards limit the transmitted RF power. In 
other words, with no need to increase the signal power, the 
signal energy can be improved significantly. This technique 
spread the signal in the time but keeps the same bandwidth 
for the system as well as the same RF power. The time 
diversity, which is due to the providing the receiver with 
several replicas of the transmitted signal is useful to 
overcome the fading problem and will improve the overall 
performance of the radio link.  
IV. THE MEASUREMENT SETUP  
Signals are generated and processed via MATLAB and 
Simulink. For the transmission, we use MSK modulation 
technique. The received signal is demodulated first and then 
TSA method is applied.  
To transmit and receive data, an ADF70XX evaluation 
board with ADF7021 transceiver was used. At the 
transmitter, the data generated by MATLAB is transferred 
to Keysight 33622A digital signal generator. The output of 
signal generator is connected to ADF70XX board. The 
transceivers are adjusted in a way to establish a MSK 
modulation. At the receiver, we use another ADF70XX and 
ADF7021 board. A manual attenuator is also applied at the 
first stage of receiver to attenuate the signal strength and to 
control the SNR. The output signal is driven from the analog 
port at the ADF7021 and can be seen with an oscilloscope. 
Registered data from oscilloscope at the receiver node is 
analyzed 
with 
MATLAB. 
The 
schematic 
of 
the 
measurement setup for transmitter and receiver are shown in 
Figures 3 and 4. 
 
 
Figure 3. Schematic of the transmitter 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Schematic of the Receiver 
 
The decision over the value of each bit has to be made 
after signal processing in MATLAB. To ignore any other 
effects during the measurements, any potential RF coupling 
has to be removed. 
Here, we present an experiment in which we use a series 
of 15 bits [010100001111101], which is the length of the 
data frame or one period of data. It will be repeated 80 times 
at the rate of 2 k.Samples/s. The over sampling rate at the 
receiver node on oscilloscope is 5, which makes 75 samples 
in each period of data repetition. The information binary 
data rate Db at the receiver node, after processing is 
calculated by dividing the samples data rate Ds by Total 
number of repetitions and equal to: 
 
 
𝐷𝑏 =
𝐷𝑠
𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = 
2000
5∗80 = 5𝑏𝑖𝑡/𝑠 
(8) 
 
The received signal power was about -119.7 dBm while 
noise power at the receiver was -120 dBm, so, the SNR = 
0.3 dB. The registered signal from oscilloscope at the 
receiver is shown in Figure 5 as a function of sample index 
(Time interval between two samples is equal to 0.5 ms). 
Please note that, this is the noisy signal before applying the 
signal processing methods. 
To synchronize the data and apply TSA we need the data 
start point as well as each repetition period. The calculating 
method is based on the periodic behavior of the information 
signal. 
 
 
Figure 5. Received signal 
 
The calculated values from received signal are presented 
bellow (corresponding peak index in Figures 6 and 7). 
In this experiment, there were 1400 non data zero samples 
before data stream. In Figure 6, the peak point value is 1401 
which is exactly the position of the first chip of data in the 
memory. The length of the data frame for one period 
multiply by the over sampling rate at the oscilloscope is 75, 
which is the period of data repetition. This is exactly the

peak value calculated and demonstrated in Figure 7.  These 
two values are essential for synchronization in phase and in 
frequency.

Finally, the result of averaging after applying TSA and 
before making decision is shown in Figure 8. The overall 
gain due to synchronized averaging techniques is 
significant. Using the comparator gives the digital signal 
(presented in Figure 9). The result after comparator block is 
[010100001111101] which is the transmitted data with no 
error. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Averaging helps to establish a link in the presence of a 
very strong noise. The cost of averaging is the size of 
repeated data (more bits than information bits are needed). 
The limitations of averaging are due to synchronization in 
phase and in the frequency. In other words, the exact instant 
at which the data starts as well as the period of each 
repetition are needed. One solution is to manipulate the data 
before sending. These manipulation parameters are used later 
at the receiver to reveal this information. The gain of whole 
process (averaging plus synchronization in phase and in the 
frequency) becomes infinity, as long as, there are no 
limitations in terms of data repetitions and memory size. But, 
in real measurements for SNR close to zero, it becomes more 
difficult to measure the received signals. It is mostly due to 
heavy coupling effect while the transmitter and receiver are 
near to each other (in the presented experiment). One 
solution to overcome this problem is to put a sufficient 
distances between receiver and transmitter to avoid the 
electromagnetic coupling. We also have to avoid using the 
same power line for both receiver and transmitter. In very 
low SNR the signals propagated over the powerlines are 
comparative to free space propagation. Therefor repeating 
the measurement in an anechoic chamber will reduce this 
effect as well. The other difficulty is the lack of memory in 
experimental devices in case of large information block. WE 
have to break the information into small block or add more 
memory at receiver node.
