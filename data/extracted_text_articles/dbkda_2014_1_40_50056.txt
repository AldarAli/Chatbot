Abstract—Ontology design is a complex and time-consuming 
process. It is extremely difficult for experts to discover ontology 
from given data or texts. This paper presents a semi-automatic 
method for  Fuzzy Ontology extraction and Design (FOD). The 
method is based on conceptual clustering, fuzzy logic and 
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The FOD approach starts 
with the organization of the data in homogeneous clusters 
having common properties which allows to deduce the data’s 
semantic. Then, it models these clusters by an extension of the 
FCA.  This lattice  will be used to build a core of ontology that  
is represented as a set of fuzzy rules. Ontology designer is given 
this initial ontology expression for further extension by adding 
concepts and relationships (part-of, related to, etc.). To validate 
our approach, we used Protégé 4.3, that support the fuzzy 
concept  and  generates automatically the script in fuzzy-OWL 
2 language.

 INTRODUCTION 
Manual construction and description of field-specific 
ontology is a complex and time-consuming procedure. The 
recent study of ontology design methodologies shows that it 
is very difficult for a designer to create a precise and 
consistent ontology [1]. Many researchers in the field of data 
mining have tried to build an ontology for data mining that 
intended to solve some specific problems. Most of the 
developments aimed to automate the planning of data mining 
workflows [2][3]. Some of them are concerned with the 
description of the data mining services on the grid [4]. Others 
explored the possible interactions among FCA and Ontology 
in the Semantic Web [5] and the text documents [6] fields. 
The problem of these ontologies is that they are not 
constructed to describe the complete domain of data mining, 
but are simply made with a specific task in mind. 
Accordingly, the limits of these approaches reside in the 
extraction of this ontology starting from the data or a data 
variety, which may be huge. The goal of this paper is to 
present a new semi-automatic approach to extract ontology 
using clustering and FCA combined with a fuzzy rule-based 
language[19].  
Our approach provides tools for semi-automatic extraction 
of taxonomy and automatic transformation of initial ontology 
to fuzzy rules. Validation of ontology is done by using 
Protégé 4.3 [15]. 
Thus, we propose a new approach for generating an  
ontology which takes into consideration another degree of 
granularity in the process of this generation. Indeed, we 
propose to define an ontology between classes resulting from 
a preliminary classification of the data and not from the initial 
large amount of data. We have proven that this approach 
optimizes the definition of the ontology, offers a better 
interpretation of the data and optimizes both the space 
memory and the time spent on data exploiting.  
The remainder of the paper is formed as follows: Section 
2 introduces the basic concepts of ontology and FCA. Section 
3 presents related work; Section 4 presents our motivation for 
this work. Section 5 describes our new approach for the semi-
automatic generation of Fuzzy Ontology of  Data Mining, 
called FODM. Section 6 validates our approach and 
represents some applications using the generated fuzzy 
ontology. Section 7 enumerates the advantages of the 
proposed approach. We finish this paper with a conclusion 
and a presentation of some future works.

BASIC CONCEPTS 
In this section, we present the basic concepts of ontology 
and FCA. 
A.  Ontologies 
Ontologies [7] are content theories about the classes of 
individuals, properties of individuals, and relations between 
individuals that are possible in a specified domain of 
knowledge. They set the terms for describing our knowledge 
around the field. An ontology of a domain is beneficial in 
establishing a common vocabulary describing the domain of 
interest. This is important for the unification and the sharing 
of knowledge about the domain and connecting with other 
domains. In reality, there is no common formal definition of 
what an ontology is. All the same, most approaches share a 
few core items, such as: concepts, a hierarchical IS-A-
relation, and further relations. For the sake of generality, we 
do not discuss more specific features like constraints, 
functions, or axioms in this paper, instead we formalize the 
core in the following way:  
Definition: 
A 
(core) 
ontology 
is 
a 
tuple   
O = (C, is_a,  R, σ) where

 
C     is a set, whose elements are called concepts  
 
is_a is a partial order on C (I. e., a is a binary relation 
is_a (C, X C which is reflexive, transitive, and anti 
symmetric),  
 
R is a set whose elements is called relation names (or 
relations for short),  
 
 : R  C+ is a function which assigns to each 
relation name its arity. 
 
In the last years, several languages have been developed 
to describe ontologies. For instance, the Ontology Web 
Language (OWL) [8] and extension of OWL language like 
OWL 2 [9] or Fuzzy OWL [10]. Likewise, the number of 
environments and tools for building ontologies has grown 
exponentially. These tools aimed to provide support for the 
ontology's development process and for the subsequent 
ontology usage. Among these tools, the most relevant are: 
Ontolingua [11], WebODE [12], Protégé-2000 [13], OntoEdit 
[14] and OilEd [15]. 
B. Formal concept analysis (FCA) 
FCA is a method of data analysis, knowledge 
representation and information management. It was suggested 
by Rudolf  Wille in 1982 [16]. In late years, FCA has grown 
into an international research community with applications in 
many fields, such as linguistics, software technology, 
psychology, 
medicine, 
AI, database, 
library 
science, 
environmental science, information retrieval, ontology 
building,  etc. FCA starts with the concept of a formal context 
specifying which objects have attributes and thus a formal 
context may be viewed as a binary relation between the object 
set and the attribute set. In [17], an ordered lattice extension 
theory has been proposed: Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis 
(FFCA), in which uncertainty information is directly 
represented by a real number of membership values in the 
range of [0,1], then the intersection of these membership 
values should be the minimum of these membership values, 
according to fuzzy theory [18]. This number is equal to the 
similarity defined as follows:

In (1),  and  refer to the intersection and union 
operators on fuzzy sets [18], respectively. In [19], we showed 
that these FFCA are very powerful in the interpretation of the 
results of the Fuzzy Clustering as well as in the optimization 
of the flexible query.

RELATED WORK 
Usually, the ontology building is performed manually, but 
researchers try to build an ontology automatically or semi 
automatically to save the time and the efforts of building the 
ontology. We survey in this section the most important 
approaches that generate ontologies from data.  
Clerkin et al. used concept clustering algorithm 
(COBWEB) to automatically discover and generate ontology. 
They argued that such an approach is highly appropriate to 
domains where no expert knowledge exists, and they 
proposed how they might use software agents to collaborate, 
as a substitute to human beings, in the construction of shared 
ontologies [20]. Blaschke et al. presented a methodology that 
creates structured knowledge for gene-product function 
directly from the literature. They apply an iterative statistical 
information extraction method combined with the nearest 
neighbor clustering to create an ontology structure [21]. FCA 
is an efficient technique that can formally abstract data as 
conceptual structures [22]. Quan et al. proposed to 
incorporate fuzzy logic into FCA to enable FCA to deal with 
uncertainty in data and interpret the concept  hierarchy 
reasonably, the proposed framework is known as FFCA. They 
use FFCA for  automatic generation of ontology for scholarly 
Semantic Web [23]. Dahab et al. presented a framework for 
constructing ontology from natural English text namely 
TextOntEx. TextOntEx constructs ontology from natural 
domain text using semantic pattern-based approach, and 
analyzes natural domain text to extract candidate relations, 
then maps them into a meaning representation to facilitate 
ontology representation [24]. Wuermli et al. used different 
ways to build ontologies automatically, based on data mining 
outputs represented by rule sets or decision trees. They used 
the semantic web languages, RDF, RDF-S and DAML+OIL 
for defining ontologies [25]. 
IV. 
MOTIVATION  
The motivation for developing an ontology of data mining 
is multi-fold.  
 
The area of data mining is rapidly developing and one 
of the most challenging problems deals with 
developing a general framework for data mining. By 
developing an ontology of data mining, we are taking 
one step towards solving this problem.  
 
There exist several proposals for ontology of data 
mining, but all of them are light-weight, aimed at 
covering a particular use-case in data mining and are 
of a limited scope and highly use-case dependent. 
Accordingly, we would argue that the limits of these 
approaches are due to the extraction of this ontology 
departing from the data or a data variety, which may be huge. 
To solve all these problems, we propose  a new approach for 
generation of the ontology using conceptual clustering, fuzzy 
logic, and FCA. Indeed, we propose to define an ontology 
between classes resulting from a preliminary classification of 
the data. The data classification is to divide a data set into 
subsets, called classes, so that all data in the same class are 
similar and data from different classes are dissimilar.

PRESENTATION OF THE FUZZY ONTOLOGY DESIGN: 
FOD  
A. Principle of the FOD  
In this section, we present the architecture of the Fuzzy 
Ontology Design (FOD)  approach and the process for 
building fuzzy ontology. Our FOD approach takes the 
20

database records and provides the corresponding Fuzzy 
Ontology Design; Figure 1 shows the proposed approach. 
 
 
 
Figure 1.  Presentation of the Fuzzy Ontology of  Data Mining approach 
The FODM approach is organized according to two 
principal steps: Data Organization step and Fuzzy Ontology 
Generation step. In the following we describe each step of the 
method in more detail. 
 
B. Theoretical Foundation of the FOD model  
In this part, we present the theoretical foundations of the 
proposed approach, based on the following properties:  
Property 1. The number of clusters generated by a 
clustering algorithm  is always  lower  than the number of 
starting objects to which one applies the clustering algorithm.   
 
All objects belonging to one same cluster have the 
same proprieties. These characteristics can be easily 
deduced knowing the center and the distance from the 
cluster.  
 
The size of the lattice modeling the properties of the 
clusters is lower than the size of the lattice modeling 
the properties of the objects.   
 
The management of the lattice modeling the 
properties of the clusters is optimum than the 
management of the lattice modeling the properties of 
the objects.   
Property 2. Let C1, C2 be two clusters, generated by a 
clustering algorithm and verifying the properties p1 and p2 
respectively. Then the following properties are equivalent:  
C1  C2  (CR) 
 
 
   object O1  C1 =>  O1 C2 (CR) 
 
 object O1  C1,  O1 checks the property p1 of  
    C1 and the property p2 of C2.  (CR) 
Property 3. Let C1, C2 and C3 are three clusters 
generated by a classification algorithm and verifying the 
properties p1, p2 and p3 respectively. Then the following 
properties are equivalent: C1, C2 = > C3  (CR)   
 
 
 object  O1  C1   C2 = > O1 C3 (CR)  
 
 object O1 C1   C2 then O1 checks the 
properties p1, p2 and p3 with (CR). 
 
The validation of the two properties rises owing to the fact 
that all objects which belong to a same cluster check 
necessarily the same attribute as their cluster.   
C. Data Organization Step 
This step allows us to organize the database records in 
homogeneous clusters having common properties. This step 
gives a certain number of clusters for each attribute. Each 
tuple has values in the interval [0,1] representing these 
membership degrees according to the formed clusters. We 
propose to leave the fuzzy formal context, to apply an -Cut 
(2) to the set of the degrees of membership, to replace them 
by values 1 and 0 and to deduce the binary reduced formal 
context. We define -Cut as follow: 
Definition. alpha-cut We define the cut, noted -Cut, on 
the fuzzy context as being the reverse of the number of 
clusters obtained.                     
-Cut = (c)-1         (2) 
Linguistic labels, which are fuzzy partitions, will be 
assigned to the attribute’s domain. This step consists of 
generating the relieving attributes for the fuzzy concept [19] 
lattices noted as TAH’s and the fuzzy nested lattice noted as 
MTAH's. This step is very important in the FOD process 
because it allows us to define and interpret the distribution of 
objects in the various clusters.  
Example: Let a relational database table presented in 
Table I containing the list of AGE and SALARY of 
Employee.

Table II shows the results of fuzzy clustering (using Fuzzy 
C-Means [26]) applied to Age and Salary attributes. For 
Salary attribute, fuzzy clustering generates three clusters (C1, 
C2 and C3). For AGE attribute, two clusters have been 
generated (C4 and C5).  
In our example, -Cut (Salary) = 0.3 and -Cut (Age) = 
0.5; so, the Table II  can be rewritten, as show in Table  III.

The minimum value (maximal, respectively) of each 
cluster corresponds to the lower (resp. higher) interval 
terminal of its values. The corresponding SALARY TAH of 
fuzzy context presented in Table III are given by the line 
diagrams presented in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2.  Salary TAH 
Each cluster of a partition is labeled with a linguistic label 
provided by the user or a domain expert. For example, the 
fuzzy labels young and adult could belong to a partition built 
over the domain of the attribute AGE. Besides, the fuzzy 
labels low, Medium and High, could belong to a partition built 
over the sphere of the attribute Salary. Table IV presents the 
correspondence of the linguistic labels and their designations 
for the attributes Salary and Age. The corresponding fuzzy 
concept lattices of fuzzy context are shown in Table V.

This very simple sorting procedure gives us for each 
many-valued attribute the distribution of the objects in the 
line diagram of the chosen fuzzy scale. Usually, we are 
interested in the interaction between two or more fuzzy many-
valued attributes. This interaction can be visualized using the 
so-called fuzzy nested line diagrams. It is used for visualizing 
larger fuzzy concept lattices, and combining fuzzy conceptual 
scales on-line. Figure 3 shows the fuzzy nested lattice 
constructed from TAH's. 
 
 
Figure 3.  Fuzzy Lattice:  MTAH 
D. Fuzzy Ontology Generation step 
This step consists of the construction of a Fuzzy Ontology 
from the Fuzzy Cluster Lattice generated in the first step. 
1) FCL Generation. 
The goal of this phase is to make a certain abstraction on 
the list of the objects with their degrees of membership in the 
clusters. This lattice will be used to build a core of ontology.    
Definition. A Fuzzy Clusters Lattice (FCL) of a Fuzzy 
Formal Concept Lattice, consists on a Fuzzy concept lattice 
where each equivalence class (a node of the lattice) contains 
only the intentional description (intent) of the associated 
fuzzy formal concept.  
Definition. A level i of FCL is a is the set of nodes of 
FCL with cardinality equal to i. 
We do a certain abstraction of the list of the objects with 
their degrees of membership in the clusters. The nodes of 
FCL are the clusters ordered by the inclusion relation.

As shown in Figure 5, we obtain a lattice more reduced, 
simply traversed and stored. 
2)   Discovering Knowledge 
This step consists in the Extraction of knowledge for the 
fuzzy ontology. To do so, we must build a concept of 
hierarchy from the conceptual clusters; we need to find the 
hierarchical relations from the clusters. We first define a 
concept hierarchy as follows: 
Definition  (Concept Hierarchy). A concept hierarchy is a 
poset (partially ordered set) (H,<), where H is a finite set of 
concepts and < is a partial order on H. 
a) Principle of discovering knowledge from FCL. 
Taking as input an FCL, the extraction of fuzzy 
association rules can be performed straightforwardly. Indeed, 
the rule represents the implications deduced from FCL 
between two adjacent classes. The confidence factor will be 
equal to the weight of the link (arc)between the two nodes. 
Rule 1. Discovering rule: Let C1= {A1.., A} and C2= 
{B1.., BM} two nodes of FCL such as C2 is the successors of 
C1 in the lattice and having as distance d>0 (weight of the arc) 
the generated rule will be defined as follows:   
A1,...,An => B1,...,Bm      (d) 
Notice that, if d=0 this implies that there is no object in 
common to the two concepts C1, C2. There is no knowledge 
to discover or to generate. 
Rule 2. Discovering rule: Let C1= {A1.., An} and C2= 
{B1.., BM} two nodes of FCL such as C2 is the successors of 
C1 in the lattice and having as distance d>0 (weight of the 
arc). The generated rule will be defined by:  
R: A1,.., An => C1,.., Cq      (d)  such that 
{C1,…, Cq} = {B1.., Bm}\{A1.., A} ( Ci, Ci ({A1,… 
An }) 
Rule 3. Generated rule: Let C1={A1.., An} C2={B1.., 
Bn} and C3={D1.., Dn} three concepts such as C2 successors 
of C1 and C2 successor of C3 having  respectively as distance 
d1 and d2.  The generated rule will be defined by: 
R 3: A1,..,An => D1,..,Dn      (d2*d1) 
b) Algorithm for Discovering Fuzzy Association rules. 
The pseudo-code for this algorithm is as follows:  
 
Figure 5.  Algorithm for Discovering Fuzzy Association rules 
The Algorithm for Discovering Fuzzy Association rules 
traverses the search space (FCL) by level to square up the 
Fuzzy Rules Set (FRS). As input it takes the lattice of 
Clusters FCL and  returns, as output, the list of all Fuzzy 
Rules Set (FRS) generated. It works as follows: For each non 
empty node  FCL in descending, it generates all rules with 
one cluster in conclusion (level 1). Then, it generates the set 
of all rules with two Clusters in conclusion. The same process 
is applied to generate conclusions with four clusters, and so 
on until conclusions with n clusters are generated. 
Proposition 3. 
If the system of extraction rules traverses the search space  
by the level of the lattice of clusters then no rule generated by 
this system is redundant (all the generated rules are 
obligatorily distinct).   
Proof. This is due to the fact that from a level to another 
of the lattice the nodes are obligatorily distinct (by definition 
even of a level of lattice).   
3) Ontology Generation. 
This step constructs fuzzy ontology from a fuzzy context 
using the concept hierarchy created by fuzzy conceptual 
clustering. This is done based on the characteristic that both 
FCA and ontology support formal definitions of concepts. 
Thus, we define the fuzzy ontology as follows: 
Definition (Fuzzy Ontology). A fuzzy ontology Fo 
consists of four elements (C, AC, R, X), where: 
 C represents a set of concepts,  
 AC represents a collection of attribute sets, one for each 
concept,  
 R = (RT; RN) represents a set of relationships, which 
consists of two elements: 
      RN is a set of non-taxonomy relationships and  
      RT is a set of taxonomic relationships.  
 Each concept ci in C represents a set of objects, or 
instances, of the same kind.  
 Each object oij of a concept ci can be described by a set of 
attributes values denoted by AC(ci).  
 Each relationship ri(cp, cq,α) in R represents a fuzzy 
association between concepts cp and cq, and the instances 
of such a relationship are pairs of (cp, cq) concept objects 
with confidence α; α  is in ]0..1].  
 Each attribute value of an object or the relationship 
instance is associated with a fuzzy membership value 
between [0,1] implying the uncertain degree of this 
attribute value or relationship.  
 X is a set of axioms. Each axiom in X is a constraint on 
the concept’s and relationship’s attribute values or a 
constraint on the relationships between concept objects. 
In our approach, we consider the Fuzzy Ontology Lattice 
as a formal domain-specific ontology. This ontology has all 
lattice properties, which are useful for ontology sharing, and 
reasoning. The whole process to create a fuzzy ontology was 
completed. We may consider nodes as concepts. The name of 
the concept is a concatenation of an attribute and its label 
linguistics, in accordance with the correspondence in Table 
IV. Nevertheless, taxonomic relationships between concepts 
are present in the lattice.

VI. 
VALIDATION AND APPLICATION OF GENERATING 
FUZZY ONTOLOGY  
The performance of the proposed algorithm for 
Discovering Fuzzy Association rules can be measured in 
order to evaluate the generated ontology. To do this, we 
evaluate the processing time and  the number of rules 
between two approaches: The first one does not apply the 
clustering concept and the second uses the formal concepts 
for structuring and building ontology-based classification. 
 
 
Figure 6.  Metrics of the Proposed Approach 
 
Figure 7.  Processing time of the Proposed Approach  
We prove that with FCA, we minimize the high time and 
space complexity of the resulting lattice. We implement, then, 
the concept lattice (result of fuzzy classification in 
ClusterFCA) with Protégé 4.3, generate the ontology, test its 
consistency, and extract the queries. The process of 
generating ontology is presented in Figure 9. 
 
Figure 8.   Process of generating/ vaidating Ontology 
By taking the abstractions got by FCA as a guideline, the 
generated ontology in Protégé 4.3 is shown in Figure 10. 
 
Figure 9.  Generated Ontology 
Once the queries concepts are defined, we can model the 
resulting rules deduced from our Fuzzy Ontology using 
Protégé 4.3 and respond to the user answers. We have also 
succeeded to generate the description of our ontology with

For  each relation concepts, we can have two 
concept instances which are equivalent. The 
two concept instances are valid in the sense 
that concept with a higher membership degree 
is closer to the concept truth. Eliminating one 
of the concept relation will not reduce the 
information conveyed, but will reduce by half 
the size of the storage. In constructing an 
ontology we retain the fuzzy relation that has a 
higher membership degree. This decision 
strategy will choose a positive concept instance 
and will choose a stronger relation if the two 
membership values are close to each other.

The relation between two distinct classes 
cannot be established if both concept never co-
occur so that their membership values will be 
0. It is obvious that unrelated classes should 
also not be considered during the ontology 
creation. These concepts will be automatically 
excluded by applying alpha-cut as described 
above.

The number of classes generated is less than

apply the classification algorithm. This 
improves the quality of the process of 
information retrieval by considering only a part 
of the ontology according to a user preference.

The ontology has been described  in OWL2, 
we took advantage of the progress of this 
language in terms of expressiveness for greater 
capacity inference without using a dedicated 
language to express rules

Nowadays, a few proposals for ontologies of data mining 
using FCA exist, but all of them start from a data unit, after 
having done a data cleansing step and an elimination of 
invalid-value elements. We have come to the conclusion that 
this idea is very important because it models an abstraction of 
the data especially in the case of voluminous one. 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
Motivated by the increased need for formalized 
representations of the domain of  Data Mining, the success of 
using FCA and Ontology in several Computer Science fields, 
we presented in this paper a new approach for the semi 
automatic generation of Fuzzy Ontology Design (FOD), 
through the fusion of conceptual clustering, fuzzy logic, and 
FCA. In our approach, we proposed to generate an ontology 
taking into consideration another degree of granularity in the 
process of generation. Indeed, we suggest to define an 
ontology between classes resulting from a preliminary 
classification of the data. We prove that this approach 
optimizes the definition of the ontology, offers a better 
interpretation of the data and optimizes both the space 
memory and the execution time for exploiting this data. To 
validate our approach, we used Protégé 4.3, which supports 
the fuzzy concept,  to model our ontology and  to generate the 
script in fuzzy-OWL 2 language.  
Knowing that the number of classes has been always  
lower than the number of starting data, our proposed 
approach intends to achieve the objectives of offering better 
interpretation of the data and minimizing both execution time 
and space memory (by reducing considerably the definition of 
the ontology). As future perspectives of this work, we intend 
to test our approach on several large datasets.
