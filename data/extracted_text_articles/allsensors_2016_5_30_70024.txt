Abstract— Resistive flex sensors have been gaining more and 
more importance in the latest years. They are applied in many 
and different fields ranging from human body tracking, traffic 
safety, musical instruments and so on. These sensors have the 
mechanical advantage to be low-weight, unobtrusive and 
pliable. However from an electrical point of view different 
works have been devoted to investigate single properties, but 
there is a lack of a comprehensive investigation, useful to select 
the proper sensor for the proper application. This paper is 
devoted to fill this lack. 
Keywords-resistive flex sensor; bend sensor. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
A Resistive Flex Sensor (RFS hereafter) consists 
typically of a thin flexible substrate painted on-top with a 
polymer ink, which includes conductive particles moved 
apart when the sensor is bent away (outward) from the ink. 
Because of the distances of the particles, an outward bending 
produces an increasing of the RFS impedance, which was 
demonstrated to be substantially resistive (real), since the 
reactive (imaginary) part is practically negligible [1]. The 
change in resistance is fully reversible; so that the sensor 
returns to its initial value when straighten.  
RFSs are furnished without or with a protective coating 
layer, useful for chemical/mechanical protection when 
necessary. In the first occurrence RFSs are known as 
uncoated (or base, or bare), otherwise as coated (or over-
laminated). Regarding all the different technological material 
and procedures in developing RFSs, the interested reader can 
find a comprehensive review in [2]. 
RFSs having only one layer printed with the conductive 
ink do not usefully respond when bent in the opposite side 
(inward) from the ink. Only the two-layer engineered types 
can respond both increasing and decreasing their resistance 
with both outward and inward mechanical bending. 
In the latest years, RFSs have been widely adopted for 
different purposes. Examples are bio-metrics (placement or 
movement of patients/athletes) [3], robotics (in realizing 
position feedback mechanism) [4], virtual-reality (user 
equipped with a sensory glove integrating RFSs virtually 
interact with objects on a PC screen) [5], automotive (for car 
occupant or traffic safety) [6] [7], musical instruments 
(transforming common gestures into sound creation) [8], 
assistive technologies (for communication of speechless 
users) [9], and so on. 
Despite their widespread usage, as far as we know, only 
single electrical issues of RFS have been treated in single 
papers, and some features have not been treated at all. This 
paper is aimed to fill this lack. 
In particular, our investigation of the electrical features of 
commercial RFSs considers the electrical resistance R versus 
angle of bending  (expressed as R=R()), the overall 
electrical variation R, the sensitivity S=R/, the 
repeatability, the hysteresis and the step response decay. In 
addition, all these aspects are here analyzed with respect to 
the RFS bending around pivots of different radiuses (0.6cm, 
0.8cm, 1.0cm, 1.2cm), RFS differently over-laminated (none, 
polyester, polyamide), with different length (1”, 2”, 3”, 
4.5”), and with inward (-90° to 0°) and outward bending (0° 
to 120°).  
In principle, RFSs can be indigenously prepared for 
custom design (an example explained in [10], but our 
investigation focuses on the mostly used RFSs, which are 
commercialized 
by 
Flexpoint 
(FP 
hereafter, 
www.flexpoint.com) and Spectrasymbol (SS hereafter, 
www.spectrasymbol.com), in particular the one-layer 
engineered types (also known as unipolar) being the most 
adopted ones. 
Section II reports details about the RFSs we adopted and 
the designed set-up used to characterize them. 
Section III is devoted to the outputs of the measurements 
and the resulting comments and suggestions useful for the 
selection of the right sensor for the right application. 
Section IV concludes with some remarks.  
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
RFSs by FP come in one uncoated version and in two 
coated versions (realized by means of polyester and 
polyamide respectively) and in three lengths of 1”, 2” and 3” 
respectively (Figure 1a). As a peculiarity, the SS RFSs are 
born with an inner high resistance of their conductive ink (in 
the MOhm range), so that some metallic pads are added 
(Figure 1b) to lower this high-value resistance to more 
convenient values.

The electrical features of the RFSs were obtained by 
means of a fully automatized set-up, so to overcome, as far 
as possible, human subjected errors. The core of the set-up 
was a mechanical hinge, with one leaf fixed on an anti-
vibrating bench, and one leaf welded to a central cylindrical 
pin and rotating with it. The rotation was obtained by means 
of a stepper motor (PD-109-57 by Trinamic, Hamburg, 
Germany). Each RFS was laid along the hinge so to bend 
according to the rotation of the mobile leaf (Figure 2). Four 
different hinges were utilized, with different diameters of the 
pin, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2cm respectively. 
Data were acquired by means of a multimeter (Agilent 
34405, by Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and the overall 
system was controlled via LabVIEW routines (Laboratory 
Virtual 
Instrumentation 
Engineering 
Workbench, 
by 
National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA). The ad-hoc 
realized LabVIEW graphical interface consisted of different 
sections with commands devoted to set/acquire data from the 
motor and the multimeter (Figure 3).

stepper motor (not visible in the figure) 
 
Figure 3.  The graphical interface useful to control instruments and to 
acquire data from the sensors 
All tests were performed in a room with fixed and 
controlled temperature (20°C) and humidity (40%). 
Each RFS was tested bending it from 0° to -90° to 0° 
(inward “round trip” bending) and from 0° to 120° to 0° 
(outward “round trip” bending), each cycle (“trip”) ten times 
iterated. The mobile leaf was rotated at 20 degree/sec, and 
paused every 5° to allow 10 data averaged acquisition during 
500ms. For the “step response decay” test, each RFS was 
simply randomly flexed and then returned to the flat position 
maintained for 60min, during which data were continuously 
acquired. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. R vs.  
Let us start considering the RFS electrical behavior in 
terms of resistance R versus bending angle , “R vs. ”. 
Figure 4(a) shows how sensors of the same type and 
length offer a different interval of resistance even when bent 
by the same amount, which seems to indicate the necessity to 
measure all RFSs, one-by-one, before their adoption. 
However, Figure 4(b) evidences a common trend for all the 
sensors with normalizing resistance data to 0-1 range. In

particular, for simplification purposes, if we can accept 
roughly a 12% of maximum error, we can adopt a unique 
average curve for all the sensors, as evidenced in Figure 5.

Similarly, the FP polyamide-coated and polyester-coated 
samples demonstrated different “R vs. ” curves (Figure 6a, 
b), but all with a similar trend, highlighted when a 
comparison is performed among the normalized versions of 
the curves. 
We interpolated all the previous “R vs. ” curves using 
the “polyfit” function of Matlab (by MathWorks®, Inc.), that 
is a polynomial fitting, with the related fit error evaluated in 
terms of “residuals” (differences between the response data 
and the fit to the response data).

Table II shows that a 6th degree polynomial curve fitting 
presents residuals as low as 2.3%, 2.5%, 1.2% 
respectively for A15, J4, C15 samples, in comparison to a 
“simple” linear approximation. A polynomial higher than six 
degree does not produce meaningful advantages. Anyway, 
the 6th degree polynomial claims the sensor to be subjected 
to a time-expensive calibration procedure before its usage, 
since it is necessary to bend it at six different angles and 
acquiring the relative resistance values to obtain the six 
coefficients of the equation.

A convenient alternative can be to consider a step-wise 
linearization: a linear fitting within 0°-40° range and another

linear fitting within 40°-120° range. In such a manner, the 
angle range versus R2 couples “;R2” are: 
 
sample A15: “0°-40°; 0.8275” and “40°-120°;0.9962” 
 
sample J4: “0°-40°;0.7878” and “40°-120°;0.9963” 
 
sample C15: “0°-40°; 0.7977” and “40-120°;0.9929” 
Although these results are obtained for special cases (in 
particular for FP uncoated, polyester-coated and polyamide-
coated 2” RFS samples), the same results can be usefully 
generalized for any FP RFSs, because of the possibility of 
normalization already discussed. 
When the non-linearity can be a relevant issue, 
linearization procedures ca be adopted, such as to insert a 
standard fixed-value resistor in parallel to the RFS under test 
[11], or to cut the RFS in a shape different from the standard 
rectangular one [12] or, finally, to add a coating layer [11], 
but waiving to the advantage of the greater sensitivity and, in 
fact, turning to the coated occurrence. 
Differently from the FP RFSs, the SS ones demonstrate 
an inner high degree of linearity (R2=0.997), as shown in 
Figure 7.

Figure 7.  The SpecrtaSymbol RFSs demonstrate an inner high degree of 
linearity of the “R vs. ” curve. 
In a previous work a mechanical model of the RFSs was 
developed to demonstrate that isotropy, of both the 
supporting layer and the on-top engineered sensible material, 
claims linearity of the “R vs. ” curve [13]. That 
demonstration suggests that FP RFSs are made of anisotropy 
elements and that SS RFSs have isotropy body. Another 
hypothesis for the linearity of the SS RFSs can result from 
the added metallic pads. In fact, as reported in [11], one 
method to linearize a non-linear behavior of an RFS is to add 
a parallel resistance and those pads can similarly “operate” 
as a sort a current-divider resistor. 
B. Sensitivity 
The FP polyamide-coated, polyester-coated and bare 
RFSs have higher sensitivity S=R/ for angles >40°, >25° 
and >18° respectively, as reported in Figure 8. 
For lower angles the FP RFSs sensitivity is reduces and 
comparable to the one of the SS RFSs.

C. Repeatability and hysteresys 
Among the specific features of a RFS, it is important that 
such a sensor can perform without any meaningful variation 
in measurement when subjected to the same testing 
conditions, i.e. to offer repeatability. In addition, it is 
relevant to observe if the resistance value, acquired at the 
same angle, is maintained when tests are performed when the 
stepper motor both increases the angle value and lowers the 
angle values, i.e. if RFS performs without meaningful 
hysteresis. 
All our tests were ten times iterated, and we evaluated the 
repeatability of the measures in terms of the standard 
deviation 
(SD) 
expressed 
in 
percentage.

Figure 9.  SD(%) versus bending angle for all types of RFSs 
It can be evidenced that a lower, and practically constant 
SD(%) results for the SS RFSs at all the tested angles. The 
FP RFSs perform with higher SD(%) in particular for middle 
angles, and the coated versions perform with higher SD(%), 
therefore a lower repeatability. 
Regarding the hysteresis, all RFSs performed with values 
lower than the respective SD, so that we can affirm that it is 
practically irrelevant. 
D. R vs. pin radius 
The resistance variation in bending a RFS is necessarily 
proportional to the portion of its length effectively flexed. 
Therefore, it is reasonable to experience higher resistance 
variation for lower value in diameter of the pin of the hinge. 
Figure 10 reports the resistance trend for the special case of

E. Different coatings 
An additional layer, on-top of the conductive one, can 
help in mechanical protection and increase the possible cycle 
of bending mechanical stress before failures of the sensor. 
This is why some types of RFSs come with some coatings, in 
particular made of polyester or polyamide. However, the 
advantages resulted from a mechanical point of view affect 
the sensors electrical performances. In particular, our tests 
evidenced a reduction in the range (max-min) of resistance 
variation, more evident with the polyamide coating with 
respect the polyester one, as evidenced in Table III. 
Regarding the SS RFSs, those sensors resulted with the 
lower range, possibly due to the metallic pads, since there is 
no evidence of a coating.

Again, also in spite of the coating layer, the FP RFSs 
result with the same trend in “R vs. ” curves, as evidenced 
in Figure 11 reporting the normalizing resistance data to 0-1 
range.

F. Inward bending 
For completeness, in addition to the outward bending 
(that is the bending which “elongates” the sensible 
conductive layer), we performed the inward bending, in 
particular from 0° to -90°, 5° stepped, averaging data of ten 
iterations. As it can be expected, results demonstrated the 
uselessness of RFSs in inward flexion. As an example, 
Figure 12 reports the behavior of the C1 (polyester-coated 3” 
long) FP RFS sample. 
This figure reports a non-monotonic function, which 
leads to the impossibility to determine unequivocally a 
bending angle from the reading of the resistance of the 
sensor. In addition, Figure 12 shows an inconsistent 
repeatability of the measure, since we obtained meaningful 
standard deviations (SDs), in particular for angle of bending 
within the -70° and 0° interval.

G. Step Response Decay 
 
A common requirement for any sensor is that its response 
has to be always the same with unchanging boundary 
conditions. In addition, a time-independent sensor has to 
maintain its response unchanged over time. In order to 
evaluate this characteristic for our RFSs, we tested their step 
response decay (a variation in resistance over time after a 
step transition to a different bending angle).

Figure 13.  Step response decay, during 60min, for all RFSs under test. 
Figure 13 reports the obtained results. 
Approximately 15 mins are necessary for the FP 
polyamide-coated, for the FP polyester-coated and for the SS 
RFSs to gain a roughly stable value of resistance, 
respectively equal to the 93%, 90% and 90% of their initial 
value; a triple time (45mins) occurs for the FP bare RFS to 
reach some stability in resistance equal to the 82% of the 
initial value. These results are comparable to the ones 
obtained in [14], and suggest that it is fundamental to always 
establish the same acquisition time after each bending of the 
sensors. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The choice of the right RFS is strictly related to the 
application. 
The FP RFSs offer high sensitivity but low linearity 
within all the tested bending range (0°-120°). Such sensors 
are well exploited when connected to a low-gain non-linear 
amplifier. The fact that FP RFSs with the same 
characteristics (equal length and coating) behave differently, 
force the user to perform tests before their usage or, 
alternatively, to count on the normalized resistance values 
rather than the actual ones. 
The coating reduces the sensitivity of the sensors, so that 
it can be recommended to use a coated sensor when strictly 
necessary, for example when RFSs have to be used in a 
harsh environment. 
The SS RFSs offer high linearity but low sensitivity, so 
that are well exploited when connected to a high-gain linear 
amplifier. In addition, SS RFSs of the same type (here a 
unique one) behaves with the same resistance values, so that 
we can perform a unique test before their utilization. 
High and acceptable repeatability of measurements was 
demonstrated for SS and FP RFSs respectively, and, for all 
RFSs, the importance to establish and maintain a time 
cadence in acquiring the measures to overcome issues related 
to the not-negligible step response decay. 
All considering, the commercial RFSs we tested are 
suitable to be generally adopted as bending sensors.
