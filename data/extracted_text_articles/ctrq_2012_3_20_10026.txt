Abstract— JPEG is a widely deployed image compression 
standard used in several applications. However, JPEG image 
transmission is challenging and sophisticated strategies are 
required for reliable transmission. This paper investigates the 
performance of JPEG image transmission using duo-binary 
Turbo codes with Unequal Error Protection (UEP). UEP is 
achieved by applying a lower code-rate to protect the DC-layer 
of the image more efficiently and a higher code-rate for 
protecting the AC-layer. Additionally, the duo-binary Turbo 
code is enhanced by scaling its extrinsic information to 
improve performance and by using a stopping criterion to limit 
the number of iterations required for decoding. The proposed 
UEP scheme provides a gain of at least 10 dB in Peak Signal to 
Noise Ratio (PSNR) over an Equal Error Protection (EEP) 
scheme for a range of Eb/No values. Moreover, the gain in 
PSNR increases as the couple length of the duo-binary code is 
increased.

 INTRODUCTION  
JPEG is a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based image 
compression algorithm, which employs Huffman coding to 
generate a compressed bit-stream [1]. It is a widely adopted 
standard and forms an integral part of several applications 
such as web browsing and telemedicine [2]. However, the 
use of Huffman coding renders the JPEG coded bit-stream 
very sensitive to error propagation because a single bit in 
error can cause a complete loss of synchronisation. As such, 
sophisticated coding solutions are required to ensure reliable 
transmission. One solution is to use powerful error-
correcting codes such as Turbo codes, which are well suited 
to protect image data as recently demonstrated in [3]. Error 
resilient and concealment techniques also provide a 
significant improvement in transmission fidelity [4,5]. 
Moreover, a highly efficient strategy for achieving robust 
JPEG image transmission is UEP. UEP consists of exploiting 
the fact that the DCT operation in JPEG, segments the image 
into layers of unequal importance. Hence, by allocating 
different levels of protection to these layers, a significant 
gain in the overall quality of the received image can be 
obtained.  
Several efficient UEP schemes have been developed for 
JPEG image transmission using Turbo codes. For example, 
in [6], UEP and joint source channel decoding with a-priori 
statistics were combined and applied to JPEG image 
transmission. Both Turbo codes and Turbo and Turbo Trellis 
Coded Modulation were used and major gains in PSNR were 
obtained over conventional JPEG image transmission 
schemes. 
An 
error 
resilient 
wireless 
JPEG 
image 
transmission scheme, which employed product Turbo or 
Reed Solomon codes alongside an optimal UEP algorithm 
was proposed in [7]. Moreover, in [8], an UEP scheme, 
which employs s-random odd-even interleaving with odd-
even puncturing, as well as a new UEP scheme for the soft 
output Viterbi algorithm, were proposed. Improved BER and 
PSNR performances in JPEG image transmission were 
obtained with these UEP schemes [8]. Finally, in [9], the 
performance of three UEP schemes for progressive JPEG 
image transmission using delay-constrained hybrid ARQ, 
with iterative bit and symbol combining was proposed. Gains 
of over 9 dB in PSNR were obtained with the UEP schemes 
as compared to their corresponding Equal Error Protection 
(EEP) schemes.  
In contrast with previous works, which considered binary 
Turbo codes, this paper proposes an UEP scheme based on 
duo-binary Turbo codes. These codes provide better 
convergence of iterative decoding, have reduced latency, 
lower sensitivity to puncturing, larger minimum distance and 
lower memory requirement [10]. Also, the duo-binary code 
is modified with a scale factor [11,12] and stopping criterion 
[13] to further improve the performance of the UEP scheme. 
The proposed UEP scheme allocates more protection to the 
DC layer, which contains the most significant part the image 
after the DCT operation, and less protection to the AC layer. 
This is achieved by using the puncturing matrices specified 
for the duo-binary Turbo code of the DVB-RCS standard 
[14]. The UEP scheme outperforms the EEP scheme by at 
least 10 dB in PSNR over a range of Eb/No values. 
Moreover, the gain in PSNR increases as the couple length 
of the duo-binary code is increased.  
The organization of this paper is as follows. Section II 
describes the complete system model.  Section III presents 
the simulation results and analysis. Section IV concludes the 
paper.

II. 
SYSTEM MODEL 
The complete encoding process is shown in Figure 1. The 
input image is fed to the JPEG encoder, which operates on 
blocks of 8x8 pixels and performs DCT, quantization and 
zig-zag ordering [1]. The AC and DC coefficients are then 
separated into the AC and DC layers. The DC layer regroups 
the first coefficient from all 8x8 blocks obtained after zig-
zag ordering and the AC-layer is the concatenation of the 63 
coefficients from all 8x8 blocks. For example with a 
256x256 image, there are 1024 blocks of size 8x8 and each 
block has one DC coefficient and 63 AC coefficients. The 
DC layer hence contains 1024 coefficients and the AC layer 
contains 1024x63 coefficients. To prevent error propagation, 
the AC and DC layers are divided into blocks of 63 and 64 
coefficients respectively. The blocks of the DC layer 
undergo Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) and 
DC-Huffman coding. Each block is encoded separately and 
after Huffman coding a header is inserted to indicate the size 
in bits of the resulting DC-packet. The blocks of the AC-
layer undergo Run-Length Encoding (RLE) followed by AC-
Huffman coding and a header is appended to indicate the 
size of each AC-packet. Each DC and AC packet can be 
decoded independently and errors within a packet do not 
propagate throughout the DC or AC layer.  
                  
                       
Figure 1. Complete encoding system with UEP. 
 
A code-rate allocation is performed to provide UEP to 
the DC and AC packets. The DC packets are given the 
lowest code-rate while the AC-packets are allocated a higher 
code-rate. The packets are then converted into couples of 
length N before being sent to the duo-binary Turbo encoder. 
The headers are transmitted error-free through a side-
channel. Finally, the encoded couples are QPSK modulated 
and sent over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) 
channel. 
    The decoding system is shown in Figure 2. The 
received noisy array, Rt is de-punctured as appropriate and 
sent to the first duo-binary decoder, DEC1. DEC2 receives 
the interleaved counterpart of Rt. The decoders employ the

are the intrinsic information of 
symbol i where i є(1,2,3), are generated by DEC1 and 
DEC2 respectively.  
 
   Further details on the computation of these parameters are 
given in [14,15,16]. In the enhanced Duo-binary decoder, 
the extrinsic information produced by both decoders are 
multiplied by a scale factor S as shown in Figure 2. The 
application of the scale factor improves performance 
because the extrinsic information value output by the Turbo 
decoder is most of the time too optimistic, hence by scaling 
it, better performance is achieved [11-12]. The controller 
unit accepts the extrinsic information from both decoders 
and uses a stopping criterion [13] to stop the iterative 
decoding process. At the start of the iterative decoding 
process, switches S1 and S2 are ON and when a given 
condition is met, the controller unit turns OFF both switches 
to stop the iterative decoding process. In this way, the 
decoder avoids the use of extra iterations and reduces the 
decoding complexity. This technique also reduces the  
power consumption of the decoder.

are used in the 
stopping criterion and the function f( ) counts the number of 
sign changes between the two arguments that are passed to 
it. The function detect( ) determines the maximum of the 
LLR values and outputs either symbol 0,1,2 or 3. The 
variable j increases by 1 because the decoder processes one 
couple at a time up to a maximum of Nc, which is the total 
number of couples in the image. The variable and r also 
increases by 1 up to a maximum limit of rmax. However, the 
variable num_iterations, which is used to count the number 
of iterations consumed by the decoder, is incremented by 
0.5. This is because the stopping criterion can stop the 
decoding process after either DEC1 or DEC2 whereby each 
decoder consumes 0.5 iterations. For example, if for a given 
couple, the decoding process completes 2 full iterations and 
then at the third iteration i.e., r=3, after passing through 
DEC1, the stopping criterion is satisfied, then only 0.5 
additional iteration is consumed and hence num_iterations 
will be 2.5 and not 3.  The complete decoding algorithm is 
as follows:

SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
The performances of the following four schemes for 
JPEG image transmission are compared:  
 
Scheme 1- UEP with scale factor:  This scheme employs 
UEP to provide different levels of protection to the AC and 
DC packets of the image. It also uses a scale factor, S, to 
enhance the performance of the duo-binary Turbo code by 
scaling the extrinsic information, as depicted in Fig.2. The 
value of S has been set to 0.75 in this simulation.  
 
 Scheme 2 - UEP without scale factor: This scheme is 
similarly to Scheme 1 but the extrinsic information is not 
scaled and the value of S is set to 1.0 in Fig.2. 
 
Scheme 3 - EEP with scale factor: It is similar to Scheme 1 
but equal protection is given to the AC and DC packets. 
 
 Scheme 4 - EEP without scale factor: This scheme is similar 
to Scheme 3 but the scale factor, S, is set to 1.0. 
 
In all simulations, the DVB-RCS standard duo-binary 
Turbo code [14] has been used with a stopping criterion. The 
generator polynomials in octal are g1 = 15 for the feedback 
branch, g2 = 13 and g3 = 11 for the parity branches. Couple 
lengths of N=64 and N=212 are used and the maximum 
number of iterations, rmax = 12. Puncturing matrices are 
chosen as per the DVB-RCS standard and the 256x256 Lena 
image is used as input. Moreover, it is assumed that the 
headers are transmitted error free over a strongly protected 
side channel. 
   The overall coding rate, Oc, was limited to Oc < 0.97 
bits/pixel and to ensure a fair comparison the overall coding 
rate for UEP was kept below that of EEP. However, with 
UEP the DC couples are more strongly protected with a 
code-rate of 1/3 while the AC couples are allocated a code-
rate of 4/5. On the other hand the EEP schemes allocates a 
fixed code-rate of 2/3 to both DC and AC couples. The 
overall coding rate, Oc, is computed as follows:

to convert the bit stream from the JPEG encoder into couples 
of length N.

      Figure 3 shows the graph of PSNR versus Eb/No for the 
four schemes with N = 64. The UEP scheme with scale 
factor provides a gain of 7dB in PSNR over the EEP 
schemes at Eb/No = 1.5dB and a major gain of 12dB in 
PSNR in the range 2dB ≤ Eb/No ≤ 3dB. It also outperforms 
the UEP scheme without scale factor by 1dB in PSNR in the 
range 2dB ≤ Eb/No ≤ 3dB. This gain is achieved because 
with the UEP the DC layer is recovered with fewer errors 
than the AC-layer and hence, the image can be reconstructed 
with much less distortions. However, it is observed that at 
high Eb/No values, the gain obtained with UEP over EEP 
decreases because the overall errors introduced in the image 
is considerably less.  
 
 
Figure 3. Graph of PSNR against Eb/No for N = 64. 
 
The graph of number of iterations versus Eb/No for        
N = 64 is shown in Figure 4.  The stopping criterion allows 
the number of iterations and hence the decoding complexity 
to decrease progressively as the Eb/No is increased. 
Interestingly, the UEP scheme with scale factor requires less 
iterations 
than 
the 
EEP 
schemes 
in 
the 
range                     
1dB ≤ Eb/No ≤ 3dB and provides an impressive reduction of 
5.5 iterations over the EEP scheme without scale factor at  
Eb/No = 1dB. 
    Figure 5 shows the graph of PSNR versus Eb/No for the 
four schemes with N = 212. The UEP scheme with scale 
factor provides a gain of 10dB in PSNR over the EEP 
schemes at Eb/No = 1dB and a major gain of 15 dB in 
PSNR in the range 1.5 dB ≤ Eb/No ≤ 2dB. It also 
outperforms the UEP scheme without scale factor by about 
1dB in PSNR in the range 1dB ≤ Eb/No ≤ 2dB. Moreover, 
with N = 212 the UEP scheme with scale factor outperforms 
the UEP scheme with scale factor for N = 64, by an average 
of 5 dB in PSNR. The gain is greater with a couple length of 
N=212 because the performance of the duo-binary Turbo 
code improves with increase in couple length. 
 
 
Figure 4. Number of iterations against Eb/No for N = 64.  
 
 
 
Figure 5. Graph of PSNR against Eb/No for N = 212. 
 
 
   The graph of number of iterations versus Eb/No for N = 
212 is shown in Figure 6.  It is observed that when N=212, 
the UEP scheme with scale factor takes less iterations than 
the EEP schemes only in the range 0dB ≤ Eb/No ≤ 1dB. For 
Eb/No > 1.5 dB the EEP scheme with scale factor requires 
significantly less iterations than the UEP schemes, for 
example, at Eb/No = 2.5dB it requires 5 iterations less than 
the UEP scheme without scale factor. A possible 
explanation for that is that the threshold used in the stopping 
criterion was not optimized for N = 212 and was maintained 
at 1/N.  
   There are two ways in which the UEP scheme can lead to 
an increase in complexity with respect to the EEP scheme. 
Firstly, over a certain Eb/No range, as observed in Figure 5, 
the UEP scheme requires more iterations than the EEP

Turbo encoder must treat the AC and DC packets separately 
and use different code-rates, hence different puncturing 
patterns are required for each of them. The same applies for 
the duo-binary Turbo decoder, whereby a different de-
puncturing process must be used for the AC and DC 
packets.

  CONCLUSION 
   This paper proposed an efficient UEP scheme for JPEG 
image transmission with enhanced duo-binary Turbo codes 
whereby an extrinsic scale factor and stopping criterion 
were incorporated. The performances of four schemes were 
compared with couple lengths of 64 and 212. The results 
showed that major gains of the order of 10 dB in PSNR are 
obtained with the UEP scheme over conventional EEP 
schemes and this gain increases when the couple length is 
increased from 64 to 212. Furthermore, the use of the scale 
factor improved the PSNR performance and reduced the 
number of iterations required, hence the complexity. 
Interestingly, with a couple length of 64, the UEP scheme 
required fewer iterations than the EEP schemes. However, 
with a couple length of 212, at higher Eb/No values, the 
EEP schemes required less iterations. An interesting future 
work would be to optimize the threshold used in the 
stopping criterion for couple lengths greater than 64, so as to 
reduce the number of iterations required by the UEP 
schemes.
