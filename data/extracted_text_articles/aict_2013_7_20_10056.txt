Bandwidth Reservation in the Erlang Multirate Loss Model  
for Elastic and Adaptive Traffic 
 
Abstract—In this paper, we consider a single-link multirate loss 
system, which accommodates K service-classes with different 
traffic and peak-bandwidth requirements. Calls of each 
service-class arrive in the system according to a Poisson 
process and have an exponentially distributed service time. The 
K different service-classes are distinguished in Ke elastic 
service-classes and Ka adaptive service-classes (K=Ke + Ka).  
Elastic 
calls 
can 
compress 
their 
peak-bandwidth 
by 
simultaneously increasing their service time, while, adaptive 
calls can tolerate bandwidth compression without affecting 
their service time. The system incorporates the bandwidth 
reservation (BR) policy whereby we can achieve certain quality 
of service (QoS) for each service-class through a proper 
bandwidth allocation, defined by the BR parameters. To 
calculate, in an approximate but efficient way, Call Blocking 
Probabilities (CBP) and link utilization, we propose a 
recurrent formula for the determination of the link occupancy 
distribution. The accuracy of the proposed formula is verified 
by simulation and is found to be very satisfactory. We also 
show the consistency and the necessity of the new model. 
Keywords - loss system; blocking probability; reservation;

 INTRODUCTION 
Call-level multirate loss models of a single link that 
supports elastic and adaptive service-classes have received 
attention over the last years due to the increase of elastic and 
adaptive traffic in communication networks and the 
consequent need for QoS network assessment (e.g.,  [1]-
[11]). Elastic traffic is composed of calls that expand their 
service time when their bandwidth is compressed. On the 
other hand, adaptive traffic refers to calls that do not alter 
their service time in the case of bandwidth compression. 
Examples of elastic traffic are generally TCP-based 
applications (FTP, HTTP, STMP), while examples of 
adaptive traffic are mostly real-time applications, like audio 
and video streaming, which can be transmitted with an 
acceptable QoS after bandwidth compression.  
The analysis of a single link multirate loss system, which 
accommodates elastic and adaptive calls that arrive to the 
system according to a Poisson process and have an 
exponentially distributed service time has been proposed in 
 [2]. In  [2], an arriving call is accepted in the system with its 
peak-bandwidth requirement, when the occupied link 
bandwidth does not exceed the capacity of the link. 
Otherwise, the system accepts this new call by compressing 
its peak-bandwidth, together with the bandwidth of all in-
service calls of all service-classes. Call blocking occurs 
when the maximum possible bandwidth compression is still 
not enough to ensure the acceptance of a new call in the 
system. When an in-service call, whose bandwidth is 
compressed, departs from the system, then the remaining in-
service calls (of all service-classes) expand their bandwidth. 
The existence of the bandwidth compression/expansion 
mechanism destroys the Markov chain reversibility and 
therefore the model of  [2] does not have a Product Form 
Solution (PFS). However, the calculation of CBP and link 
utilization is based on an approximate but recursive formula 
for the determination of link occupancy distribution. This 
formula resembles the classical Kaufman-Roberts formula 
used in the Erlang Multirate Loss Model (EMLM), where 
Poisson arriving calls have fixed bandwidth requirements 
(stream traffic, no bandwidth compression is permitted) and 
compete for the available link bandwidth under the 
complete sharing policy [12], [13]. To this end, we name 
herein the model of  [2], Extended EMLM (E-EMLM). The 
co-existence of stream and elastic traffic in the same link 
has been considered in [11], but the proposed formulas are 
not recursive (i.e., do not resemble the Kaufman-Roberts 
formula). 
In this paper, we incorporate into the E-EMLM the BR 
policy (E-EMLM/BR). The BR policy can achieve CBP 
equalization among service-classes (either elastic or 
adaptive), or guarantee a certain QoS for each service-class, 
by a proper selection of the BR parameters so that each 
service-class meets a certain bandwidth capacity. The 
consideration of the BR policy is of paramount importance 
in multirate communication networks, given that the 
absence of the BR policy leads to an unfair service (the less 
required bandwidth, the better CBP). The proposed model 
does not have a PFS and therefore we provide an 
approximate recursive formula for the determination of the 
link occupancy distribution. The latter not only simplifies 
the calculation of CBP and link utilization but also provides

quite satisfactory results compared to simulation. Note that a 
multirate loss system that accommodates Poisson arriving 
calls of elastic traffic only has been considered in  [1], while 
the application of the BR policy in that model has been 
proposed in [14]. 
The remainder of this paper is as follows:  In Section II, 
we review the E-EMLM. In Section III, we propose the E-
EMLM/BR. Section IV is the evaluation section. We present 
analytical and simulation results of CBP and link utilization 
of the E-EMLM/BR. We also provide analytical results of 
the E-EMLM for comparison. We conclude in Section V.

REVIEW OF THE E-EMLM 
A. Review of the E-EMLM 
Consider a single link of capacity C bandwidth units (b.u.) 
that accommodates calls of K service-classes. Let Ke and Ka 
be the set of elastic and adaptive service-classes (Ke + Ka = 
K), respectively. A call of service-class k (k =1,…,K) follows 
a Poisson process with arrival rate λk and has a peak-
bandwidth requirement of bk b.u. (integer value). Let j be the 
occupied link bandwidth when a new service-class k call 
arrives in the link. If j + bk   C, the call is accepted in the 
system with its bk b.u. and remains in the system for an 
exponentially distributed service time with mean
k 1
  . The 
new service-class k call is blocked and lost if j + bk > T, 
where T is the limit (in b.u.) up to which bandwidth 
compression is permitted. If T   j + bk > C the new call is 
accepted in the system. However, the assigned bandwidth of 
all in-service calls, together with the peak-bandwidth 
requirement of the new call is compressed. After the 
bandwidth compression of all calls (new and in-service) the 
system state becomes j = C. The compressed bandwidth of 
the new service-class k call is calculated by:

After the bandwidth compression, all elastic calls

The mechanism of bandwidth compression/expansion 
destroys reversibility in the E-EMLM and therefore no PFS 
exists. However, in  [2] an approximate recursive formula is 
proposed which determines the link occupancy distribution,

where t(k) is the reserved bandwidth (BR parameter) for 
service-class k calls (either elastic or adaptive). 
The BR policy ensures CBP equalization among 
different service-classes by a proper selection of the BR 
parameters. If, for example, CBP equalization is required 
between calls of three service-classes with b1=1, b2=7 and 
b3=10 b.u., respectively, then t(1) = 9 b.u, t(2)=3 and t(3) = 
0 b.u. so that b1 + t(1) = b2 + t(2)= b3 + t(3). If t(k) = 0 for 
all k (k=1,…,K) then the E-EMLM results. Furthermore, if 
T=C then the EMLM results.

The application of the BR policy in the E-EMLM is 
based on the assumption that the number of service-class k 
calls is negligible in states j > T-t(k) and is incorporated in 
(6) by the variable Dk(j-bk) given in (7). The states j > T-t(k) 
belong to the so-called reservation space. Note that the 
population of calls of service-class k in the reservation space 
may not be negligible. In [15], [16] a complex procedure is 
implemented in order to take into account this population 
and increase the accuracy of CBP results in the EMLM and 
Engset multirate state-dependent loss models, respectively. 
However, according to [16] this procedure may not always 
increase the accuracy of the CBP results compared to 
simulation.  
The CBP of service-class k, Bk, in the E-EMLM/BR is

Having obtained the values of the link occupancy 
distribution, G(j), according to (6) we can calculate the link 
utilization according to (5).  
Note that if the link accommodates only elastic service-
classes then the link occupancy distribution can be 
determined by the following recursive formula [14]:

IV. 
APPLICATION EXAMPLE - EVALUATION 
In this section, we present an application example of the 
new model, E-EMLM/BR, and the existing model, E-
EMLM. Through the E-EMLM/BR we obtain analytical 
CBP and link utilization results, and we compare them with 
the corresponding simulation results, in order to reveal the 
accuracy of the proposed model. We also compare the 
analytical CBP and link utilization results of the E-
EMLM/BR with those obtained by the E-EMLM to reveal 
the consistency and the necessity of the proposed model. As 
far as simulation results are concerned, they are mean values 
of 7 runs; no reliability ranges are presented, because they 
are very small. The simulation language used is Simscript 
II.5 [18].  
As an application example, we consider a single link of 
capacity C = 100 b.u., that accommodates calls of four 
service-classes, with the following traffic characteristics: 
1st service-class: α1 = 12 erl, b1 = 1 b.u. 
2nd service-class: α2 = 6 erl, b2 = 2 b.u. 
3rd service-class: α3 = 3 erl, b3 = 4 b.u. 
4th service-class: α4 = 2 erl, b4 = 10 b.u. 
 
Calls of the 1st and 2nd service-class are elastic, while 
calls of the 3rd and 4th service-class are adaptive. The limit 
T, up to which bandwidth compression of all calls is 
permitted, takes two different values T = 120 and T = 140 
b.u. In the first case, the minimum proportion of the 
required 
peak-bandwidth 
takes 
the 
value: 
rmin= 
C/T=100/120=5/6. Similarly, in the second case: rmin= 
C/T=100/140=5/7.  
When the BR policy is applied in the E-EMLM/BR, we 
choose the BR parameters t(1)=9, t(2)=8, t(3)=6 and t(4)=0 
in order to achieve CBP equalization among the four 
service-classes, since: b1+ t(1)=b2+t(2)=b3+t(3)=b4+t(4).  
In the x-axis of all figures, traffic loads α1, α2, α3 and α4 
increase in steps of 2, 1, 0.5 and 0.25 erl, respectively. In 
this way, Point 1 represents the vector (α1, α2, α3, α4) = 
(12.0, 6.0, 3.0, 2.0) while Point 7 is (α1, α2, α3, α4) = (24.0, 
12.0, 6.0, 3.5). In Figs. 1-4, we consider the value T = 120 
b.u and present the analytical and simulation CBP results of 
the four service-class calls, respectively, in the case of the 
E-EMLM/BR. For comparison, we give the corresponding 
analytical CBP results of the E-EMLM. The value T = 140 
b.u is considered in Figs. 5-8. Due to CBP equalization 
achieved by the aforementioned BR parameters, the 
analytical CBP results of the E-EMLM/BR are exactly the 
same in Figs. 1-4. The same happens in Figs. 5-8. The 
differences between the CBP results of the E-EMLM/BR 
and the E-EMLM show the consistency and the necessity of 
the E-EMLM/BR. Finally, in Fig. 9, we consider both 
values of T and present the analytical and simulation results 
of the link utilization in the case of the E-EMLM/BR. For 
comparison, we give the corresponding analytical results for 
the E-EMLM.   
All figures show that the analytical and simulation CBP 
results of the E-EMLM/BR are very close; this fact reveals 
the accuracy of the E-EMLM/BR. In addition, the 
comparison of Fig. 1 with Fig. 5, Fig. 2 with Fig. 6, Fig. 3 
with Fig. 7 and Fig. 4 with Fig. 8 shows that the increase of 
T reduces the values of CBP of each service-class; this fact 
shows the consistency of the E-EMLM/BR. Furthermore, 
note that the choice of the BR parameters that achieve CBP 
equalization, actually favors calls of the 4th service-class 
only (see Figs 1-4 and Figs 5-8, where the CBP of the first 
three service-classes increase in the E-EMLM/BR compared 
to the corresponding CBP results in the E-EMLM). As far 
as the link utilization results of Fig. 9 are concerned, they 
show that the compression/expansion mechanism increases 
the link utilization, since it decreases CBP.

CONCLUSION 
We propose an analytical model for the recursive 
calculation of CBP and link utilization in a single 
communication link, which accommodates multirate traffic 
of elastic and adaptive calls that follow a Poisson process, 
under the bandwidth reservation policy. This policy is used 
in order to achieve certain QoS among elastic and adaptive 
calls, or obtain equalization of call blocking probabilities. 
Simulation results verify the analytical CBP and link 
utilization results, and prove the accuracy of the proposed 
model. The comparison between the analytical results of the 
proposed model (E-EMLM/BR) and the corresponding 
results of the existing model (E-EMLM), prove the necessity 
and the consistency of the new model. A future extension of 
this model is the consideration of a mixture of random 
(Poisson) and quasi-random traffic under the BR policy. 
Quasi-random traffic, i.e., traffic generated by a finite 
number of sources (in contrast to random traffic, which 
assumes an infinite number of traffic sources), is a necessary 
assumption to many realistic network configurations.
