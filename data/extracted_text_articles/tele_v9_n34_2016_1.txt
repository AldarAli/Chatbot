Abstract—Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellite 
communication systems have received the attention of the 
research community over the last years. This paper proposes a 
downlink MIMO satellite-to-terrestrial (S2T) system aided by 
multiple amplify-and-forward (AF) terrestrial relay nodes. 
This system intends to provide robust, reliable, and efficient 
communication links and improve the spectral efficiency and 
the total capacity of the network. In particular, this paper 
mainly concentrates on investigating the performance of the 
proposed system and evaluating the bit-error-rate (BER) and 
the channel capacity. To model the satellite and terrestrial 
channel, the Loo and Rician statistical distributions are 
utilized, respectively. One major implementation difficulty of 
the MIMO technology is the signal separation (detection) 
problem at the receiving side of the communication link due to 
interference from multistream transmission. In this paper, the 
linear zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error 
(MMSE) multi-antenna signal detection techniques are 
employed. To improve the performance without significantly 
increasing the complexity, ordered successive interference 
cancellation (SIC) techniques are also exploited.

INTRODUCTION 
As new requirements for access to comprehensive 
broadband and broadcast/multicast high-speed wireless 
communication 
services 
are 
emerged, 
satellite 
communications can play an important role in the evolution 
of current and future communication systems by providing 
global coverage and ubiquitous access [1], [2]. Satellite 
networks intend to substantially support terrestrial backhaul 
networks and provide uninterrupted radio coverage to fixed, 
portable, and mobile terrestrial receivers. The development 
of next-generation communication systems envisages the 
synergetic and seamless integration of heterogeneous 
terrestrial and satellite networks with different capabilities, 
providing voice, text and multimedia services. Hybrid 
satellite-terrestrial networks are a typical example of 
cooperation between different architectures. 
For the terrestrial infrastructure, the multiple-input 
multiple-output (MIMO) architecture has fulfilled the 
growing demands for high data throughputs and enhanced 
link reliability [3]. In recent years, theoretical and 
experimental efforts have been also devoted by academia 
and space agencies to the investigation of the applicability of 
multiple-antenna techniques to satellite systems and the 
potential enhancements that can be achieved through spatial 
and/or polarization diversity [4], [5]. 
The advantages of MIMO technology can be combined 
with the features of cooperative diversity techniques via 
intermediate relays [1], [6]-[9], in order to improve the 
quality of service (QoS), extend the network range, and 
preserve the end-to-end communication between a source 
and a destination. The most usual and well-defined types of 
relaying are the non-regenerative relaying, e.g., amplify-and-
forward (AF) relaying, and the regenerative relaying, e.g., 
decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. In the first type, the relay 
is a conventional repeater, which just amplifies the received 
signal and forwards it to the destination. In the second type, 
the relay has an active role being able to decode the received 
signal, perform baseband signal processing, and retransmit 
the signal to the final destination. 
In [10], [11], the use of relaying in a single-antenna 
hybrid satellite-to-terrestrial (S2T) communication system 
was proposed, whereas the performance of a single-antenna 
hybrid S2T multi-relay cooperative system was analyzed in 
[12]. Besides, a MIMO S2T communication system with a 
single terrestrial relay was proposed in [13]. The benefits 
regarding the outage probability, the symbol-error-rate 
(SER) and the ergodic capacity of a S2T communication 
system with a single multi-antenna relay compared to a 
conventional single-antenna relay system was underlined in 
[14]. Indeed, research on multi-relay networks with MIMO-
enabled nodes remains limited. A cooperative multi-relay 
MIMO system, where every terminal in the network is 
employed with multiple antennas was presented in [15]. 
However, this system does not consider the special 
characteristics of the satellite radio channel. 
This paper investigates the performance of a downlink 
MIMO S2T communication system with multiple terrestrial 
relay nodes in terms of the bit-error-rate (BER) and the 
available channel capacity. To model the satellite channel, 
the Loo statistical distribution is used [16]. Besides, the 
terrestrial channel is modeled using the Rician distribution. 
Since the receiver often observes a linear superposition of

separately transmitted information that cannot be easily 
separated, this paper utilizes the linear zero-forcing (ZF) [17] 
and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) [18] signal 
detection 
techniques, 
which 
are 
characterized 
by 
computational simplicity compared to non-linear techniques. 
Moreover, the ordered successive interference cancellation 
(SIC) techniques are employed to enhance the performance 
without significantly affect the complexity at the receiver 
[19]. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents a MIMO multi-relay S2T system. In Section III, the 
satellite and terrestrial radio channels are statistically 
modeled using widely accepted statistical distributions. 
Section IV focuses on signal detection techniques. Results 
are provided in Section V. Finally, conclusions and future 
research perspectives are drawn in Section VI. 
II. 
SYSTEM MODEL OF THE MULTIPLE-INPUT MULTIPLE-
OUTPUT SATELLITE-TO-TERRESTRIAL MULTI-RELAY 
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM 
In this section, a downlink MIMO S2T communication 
system is considered, where R full-duplex (FD) AF 
terrestrial relays (R) are assigned to assist the source (S), 
i.e., the satellite, in forwarding its information to the 
destination (D), i.e., terrestrial station. Although half-duplex 
(HD) relaying offers interference-free transmission at the 
cost of inefficient resource utilization, FD relaying has 
received significant attention and many studies suggest that 
by allowing a certain amount of loop-interference (LI), 
improved performance can be harvested compared to HD 
relaying [20]. It is assumed the antennas at the relays are 
isolated and that perfect LI cancellation is feasible. It is also 
assumed that the direct link between source and destination 
is obstructed due to high attenuation. Τhe communication 
system comprises R intermediate relay nodes equipped with 
r
M  transmit and 
t
M  transmit antennas, where

Figure 2. The system model of a MIMO multi-relay S2T system. 
Note that the generalization to the case, where each relay 
has a distinct number of transmit and receive antennas can 
also be similarly incorporated in the following analysis but 
at the expense of a more complicated notation. The waves 
emitted from the source antennas travel over paths with 
different lengths and impinge the relays’ antennas. Then, the 
relay nodes amplify and forward the received signal to the 
destination. 
The 
transmitted 
data 
consists 
of 
t
N  
independent data streams, which are allocated to the 
correspondingly numbered antennas at the source and relay 
nodes. The link between the source and the relays represents 
the satellite link, while the link between the relays and the 
destination can be modeled as a terrestrial link. Data are 
transmitted in N-symbol packets. All wireless radio 
channels are assumed uncorrelated, unless otherwise 
specified, with frequency-flat block fading, where the 
coherence time is equal to the duration of the N-symbol 
packet. Note that the entire system can be separated into 2R 
MIMO subsystems related with the communication link 
between the source and each relay, as well as each relay and 
the destination. It is considered that each relay processes the 
received signals independently. 
First, the MIMO subsystem for the communication link 
between the source and the rth relay is considered. For this 
subsystem, the

An important prospective feature of multi-relay MIMO 
communication networks is an increase in the channel 
capacity. The ergodic channel capacity (in bits/sec/Hz) of a 
MIMO AF multi-relay system is defined as the expectation 
of the instantaneous mutual information (MI) between the 
source and destination. Fundamentally, the MI is given by 
the difference between the differential entropy and the 
conditional differential entropy of the received signal at the 
destination via the relays when the transmit data are known.

STATISTICAL MODELING OF THE SATELLITE AND 
TERRESTRIAL CHANNEL 
The modeling of the satellite channel can be performed 
via a deterministic or statistical approach. Although the 
deterministic 
channel 
models 
are 
accurate, 
their 
computational complexity is large. In particular, the 
application of the deterministic channel models to satellite 
systems is not practically attractive, since a single satellite 
beam covers a wide propagation area and the determination 
of all the relevant paths between the satellite and the 
terrestrial station is difficult. On the contrary, the statistical 
channel models express the distribution of the received 
signal by means of the first-order statistics, such as the 
probability density function (PDF) or the cumulative 
distribution function (CDF), and the second-order statistics, 
such the level crossing rate (LCR) and the average fade 
duration (AFD). Since multipath and shadowing effects are 
important in the signal propagation, the statistical models 
usually assume that the received signal consists of two 
components, the line-of-sight (LoS) component and the non-
line-of-sight (NLoS) component. Then, the relative power of 
the direct, i.e., LoS, and multipath, i.e., NLoS, components 
of the received signal is controlled by the Rician factor and 
the distributions of these two components are usually studied 
separately.  
The statistical models for S2T channels can be 
characterized into two categories; single state and multi-state 
models [24]. The single state channel models are described 
by single statistical distributions and can be used fixed 
satellite scenarios, where the channel statistics remain 
constant over the areas of interest. Besides, the multi-state 
channel models are used for non-stationary time-varying 
propagation conditions. 
In this section, a single-state statistical modeling 
approach for the satellite and the terrestrial channel is 
described. Specifically, the satellite channel is modeled using 
the Loo distribution [16], where the long-term shadowing 
due to roadside trees affects only the LoS component and is 
described through a log-normal distribution, whereas the 
NLoS component is described by a Rayleigh PDF. Hence, 
the resulting complex signal envelope is the sum of 
correlated lognormal and Rayleigh processes. The Loo 
distribution assumes that the foliage not only attenuates but 
also scatters the radio waves. In addition, the Rician 
distribution is utilized, in order to model the terrestrial 
channel. Then, a strong LoS signal also arrives at the 
receiver branches and the fading envelope follows a Rice 
distribution.

A. Modeling of the satellite radio channel 
As previously mentioned, for the communication link 
between the satellite and the terrestrial relays, the Loo 
distribution is used, which was verified experimentally by 
conducting measurements in rural areas with elevation 
angles up to 30o [25]. Using the Loo distribution, the 
channel matrix of the satellite link for the envelope

the log-normal distribution to model the large-scale fading 
and Rayleigh distribution for the modeling of small-scale 
fading. Specifically, the Loo probability density function is

B. Modeling of the terrestrial radio channel 
The terrestrial wireless radio channel is mostly 
characterized by the surrounding local scatterers in the 
vicinity of the terrestrial nodes, which produce multipath 
components. Since a strong LoS component is also present, 
the propagation environment can be characterized using the 
Rician distribution as follows [26]

 is a deterministic unit rank matrix, which represents 
the direct component, and 

 is the channel matrix of the 
multipath components. When Kr = 0 the channel is 
described by a Rayleigh distribution, whereas a very large 
value of Kr, i.e., 
,
r
K → ∞  implies the presence of a 
Gaussian channel.  
Recent studies have shown that the performance of 
MIMO systems strongly depends on the Rician factor [27]. 
In particular, as the Rician factor increases, the correlation 
between MIMO subchannels also increases [28]. Hence, 
efficient and accurate methods for estimating the Rician 
factor are of considerable interest [29]. Several values of the 
Rician factor have been reported in the literature from 
measurement campaigns and studies performed in the L- 
and S- frequency bands for satellite communications 
systems [30]. According to these measurements, the value 
of the Rician factor depends on the elevation angle of the 
satellite and the operating frequency. Nevertheless, the 
value of the Rician factor also depends on the propagation 
area, and the degree of urbanization. Thus, the Rician factor 
is expected to be lower in highly urbanized areas, where the 
scatterers are usually dense.  
IV. 
LINEAR SIGNAL DETECTION SCHEMES 
In MIMO systems, spatial multiplexing is exploited, 
where multiple streams of independent data are transmitted 
from the transmitting antennas. These streams should be 
then separated at the receiver by means of appropriate 
processing techniques. Hence, signal detection is required 
for the signals. In this paper, standard linear signal detection 
methods for MIMO spatial multiplexing systems are used 
due to their simplicity, versatility, well-understood 
characteristics, and ease of extracting performance metrics. 
In linear signal detectors, a linear transform is applied to the 
outputs of conventional matched filters to produce a new set 
of outputs, which may generate better results. These 
detectors treat all transmitted signals as interferences except 
for the desired stream from the target antenna at the 
transmitter. Therefore, interference signals from other 
antennas are minimized or nullified in the course of 
detecting the desired signal from the target antenna. To 
facilitate the detection of signals from each antenna, the 
estimated symbols are inverted by a weight matrix W as 
follows [22]

symbol, which depends on the number of the transmit 
antennas. The standard linear detection methods include the 
well-defined and widely used ZF and MMSE linear signal 
detection techniques.  
The simplest MIMO detector is the ZF detector, which 
simply inverts the channel matrix and attempts to 
completely remove (forced to zero) the interference caused 
by the channel. For the case when the inverse of the channel 
does not exist, the pseudoinverse of the channel matrix is 
used. The ZF detection technique assumes that the base 
station has perfect knowledge of the channel state 
information (CSI) of all users’ equipment present at the 
receiver. 
The weight matrix of the ZF technique is given by [22]

Note that the ZF detector 
performs poorly when the channel matrix is close to being 
singular, since it amplifies the noise. On the other hand, 
when the channel matrix is orthogonal, this suboptimal 
linear detector does not amplify the noise, and is equivalent 
to a decision feedback or non-linear maximum likelihood 
(ML) detector [31]. The latter is considered as an optimal 
complex technique in the sense of minimum error 
probability, when all data vectors are equally likely, and it 
fully exploits the available diversity. 
The noise enhancement effect plaguing the ZF detection 
technique can be reduced by using the MMSE detection 
technique, which is also considered suboptimal. To 
maximize the post-detection signal to interference plus noise 
ratio (SINR), the MMSE weight matrix is given by [22]

Although non-linear reception 
offers 
performance 
advantages in MIMO systems by assisting in the mitigation 
of the multi-antenna interference, the linear detection 
methods are characterized by low complexity in terms of 
hardware implementation. To improve their performance 
without significantly increasing their complexity associated 
with other non-linear methods, ordered SIC techniques can 
be exploited. These techniques consider a bank of linear 
receivers, each of which detects one of the parallel data 
streams, such that the detected signal components 
successively canceled from the received signal at each stage. 
The signal is first obtained in the detection step of each 
propagation path signal. Then, the signals are combined to 
detect each substream. More specifically, the detected signal 
in each stage is subtracted from the received signal so that 
the remaining signal with the reduced interference can be 
used in the subsequent stage [22].  
Fig. 3 illustrates the ordered SIC signal detection process 
for four spatial streams, i.e., Nt = 4. Let us denote 
ix  the 
symbol to be detected in the ith order, which may be 
different from the transmit signal at the ith antenna, since 
x( )i
 depends on the order of detection. Let 
x( )i
denote a 
sliced value of 
( ).
x i
 In ordered SIC techniques, symbol 
estimation can be obtained using a linear detector, such as 
ZF or MMSE. The first stream is estimated with the first 
row vector of the ZF and MMSE weight matrix in (13) and 
(15), respectively.

RESULTS 
This section demonstrates the performance of the 
proposed communication system with reference to the BER 
and the available channel capacity. To investigate the 
performance of the MIMO multi-relay S2T system, two 
scenarios are initially examined (see Fig. 4). In the first 
scenario, a single-relay system is considered with two 
antennas at the source, relay, and destination. The second 
scenario includes two synchronized relay nodes each 
equipped with single antennas. For the first scenario, the 
Rician factor is set to 10 dB, whereas for the second 
scenario, the Rician factor is set to 8 dB for the 
communication link between the source and the first relay 
and 10 dB for the communication link between the source 
and the second relay, respectively.  
Fig. 5 demonstrates the end-to-end BER performance for 
the aforementioned two communication scenarios. QPSK 
modulation is used, since satellite communications are 
sensitive to data loss due to the limited resources. According 
to the results, the best performance is achieved with SIC-
MMSE, while the worst with ZF for both scenarios. In 
addition, the MIMO two-relay S2T system outperforms the 
MIMO single-relay S2T system.  
In Fig. 6, the advantage of the MMSE technique over the 
ZF technique is depicted in terms of the channel capacity. 
However, this advantage is nullified as the SNR increases.

a single relay equipped with two antennas or two relays equipped with 
single antennas are used. 
In Fig. 7, different propagation scenarios are examined 
regarding the BER for a MIMO single-relay S2T system. 
Specifically, the Loo-Rician, Loo-Rayleigh, Rician-Rician, 
and Rician-Rayleigh distributions are compared. ZF signal 
detection is exploited and it is considered that the source, 
the destination, and the relay are equipped with two 
antennas. One observes that the performance is better, as 
soon as the Loo-Rayleigh fading distribution is considered, 
i.e., the Loo distribution is used for the link between source 
and relay, whereas the Rayleigh distribution is used for the 
link between relay and destination.  
The effect of the Rician factor, which controls the 
strength of the LoS component is demonstrated in Fig. 8, 
where identical values of the Rician factor are used for the 
different links. In particular, the BER performance degrades 
as the Rician factor increases. Overall, the results in Figs. 7 
and 8 confirm that the MIMO advantages can be 
successfully exploited in propagation environments, which 
are characterized by a sufficiently large number of non-
coherent diffuse components. 
In Fig. 9, the effect of the value of the amplification 
factor on the end-to-end BER performance of a MIMO S2T 
communication system is illustrated, where a single relay 
equipped with two antennas and SIC-MMSE techniques are 
used. One observes that increasing the amplification factor 
improves the performance. 
Fig. 10 shows the end-to-end BER performance of a 
MIMO single-relay S2T communication system for 
different digital modulation schemes, i.e., BPSK, QPSK, 8-
PSK, and 16-PSK. It is clear that BPSK is the preferred 
modulation scheme for the proposed system. 
Fig. 11 demonstrates the channel capacity as a function of 
the number of relays and the number of antennas at the 
relays. The capacity increases as the number of single-
antenna relays increases. However, when the relays are 
equipped with a large number of antennas, increasing the 
number of relays has an insignificant effect on the capacity.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, the benefits of using multiple antenna 
techniques in relay-based S2T systems have been 
demonstrated. Specifically, the performance of a MIMO 
S2T communications via single or multiple AF relays for 
the forward link has been investigated. The results have 
shown the gain in the BER and the achievable channel 
capacity by applying ZF, MMSE, SIC-ZF, SIC-MMSE 
signal 
detection 
schemes 
in 
different 
propagation 
conditions. These results have also underlined that the most 
promising system model for future reliable wireless 
networks in difficult terrains and/or high distances is the one 
that uses BPSK modulation and SIC-MMSE signal 
detectors. 
Nevertheless, this work could be further improved or 
extended into different areas. Due to the lack of channel-
sounding measurement campaigns, the contribution of this 
work has been limited to theoretical results. However, it is 
important to verify this results in real-world propagation 
conditions. Moreover, other relaying techniques, such as DF 
relaying, 
and 
more 
sophisticated 
signal 
detection 
techniques, such as the non-linear ML and Tomlinson-
Harashima Precoding (THP) techniques, may be exploited, 
in order to involve additional signal processing and improve 
error rate performance. The direct link from the source to 
the destination could be also considered in addition to the 
indirect source to destination link via the relay nodes, in 
order to construct a cooperative communication system and 
test its performance. Finally, multi-beam techniques based 
on the sufficient spatial separation of the users on ground 
and proper partitioning of the coverage area can be also 
exploited, in order to further increase the spectral efficiency 
of MIMO S2T multi-relay systems.
