Abstract—Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) represent 
a class of organic compounds that negatively affect human 
health. These compounds are of toxicological concern because 
some of them have been identified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, 
and teratogenic. Burkholderia fungorum DBT1 is a bacterial 
strain, first isolated from an oil refinery discharge, which can 
utilize 
dibenzothiophene 
(DBT), 
phenanthtrene 
and 
napthalene as substrates for growth. This strain is capable of 
degrading DBT nearly completely through the “Kodama 
pathway” more efficiently than others.  The work presented 
here is aimed at a  structural characterization at the molecular 
level of the proteins involved in the first step of the PAH 
degradation pathway, i.e., the Rieske Oxygense (RO) complex. 
Thus, using state-of-the-art structural bioinformatics tools we 
have built the structural models of each of the members of the 
RO complex encoded in the Burkholderia fungorum DBT1 
strain. The structural characterization combined with future 
molecular biology experiments  may give important insights 
into the functioning of this particular strain.

I. 
I.    INTRODUCTION (HEADING 1) 
 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are an 
ubiquitous class of hydrophobic organic compounds 
consisting of two or more fused aromatic rings. PAHs are 
widespread in the environment and persist over long periods 
of time: many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are 
largely suspected to be mutagenic or carcinogenic [1], and 
their contamination in soil and aquifer is of great 
environmental concern.  
Of the PAHs occurring in soils and groundwaters, about 
0.04 - 5% (wt/wt) are sulfur heterocycles [2] among which 
dibenzothiophene 
(DBT) 
represents 
the 
prevailing 
compound. This is therefore taken into account as model 
chemical 
structure 
in 
studies 
dealing 
with 
either 
biodegradation of organo-sulfur contaminants by petroleum  
biodesulfurisation through the “4-S pathway”[3] or through 
the “Kodama pathway” [4] [5] [6]. The latter transforms the 
molecule 
to 
the 
final 
product 
3-hydroxy-2-
formylbenzothiophene (HFBT). Denome et al. [7] cloned 
the genes responsible for the Kodama pathway from 
Pseudomonas fungorum. These genes, that are organized in 
a single operon, encode enzymes of the upper naphthalene 
catabolic pathway, and belong to a group of genes showing 
a high degree of sequence identity with the nah genes from 
Pseudomonas putida G7 [8]. The nah-like class of genes, 
cloned from different microorganisms, are highly conserved 
and are involved in the transformation of molecules that 
constitute the low molecular weight fraction of PAHs, 
including DBT [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]. They are normally 
clustered in a single operon under the control of a single 
promoter. 
A novel genotype for the initial steps of the oxidative 
degradation of dibenzothiophene was recently found in the 
bacterial strain Burkholderia fungorum DBT1 isolated from 
a drain receiving oil refinery wastewater [14]. Burkholderia 
fungorum DBT1 is a NON-PATHOGENIC strain capable of 
transforming DBT completely through the “Kodama 
pathway” with higher efficiency than other microorganisms.  
This strain  shows a particular genomic organization for the 
initial steps of the oxidative degradation of PAHs when 
compared to previously described genes capable of PAHs 
catabolism. In fact the genes are organized in two operons 
instead of one: they are called pH1A-p46 and p51 
respectively [14] (GenBank accession numbers AF380367 
and AF404408 respectively). In DBT1genes involved in 
DBT transformation show only low similarity with the 
corresponding conserved isofunctional oxidative genes. The 
unusual gene organisation suggests the possibility of novel 
features of DBT transformation in natural context.   
Rieske Oxygenase (RO) systems have been shown to 
catalyze the
 
first step in the Kodama  pathway [15]. ROs 
produce cis-dihydrodiols from
 
a large variety of substrates 
and molecular oxygen (dioxygen).
  
RO systems use electrons from NAD(P)H to activate 
molecular
 
oxygen, which is then used to oxidize the 
substrate. RO systems
 
are composed of two or three 
components, including a reductase,
 
a ferredoxin (not found 
in all systems), and an oxygenase (Fig.
 
1). The reductase 
component liberates electrons from NAD(P)H
 
and transfers 
the electrons to the ferredoxin. The ferredoxin
 
shuttles the 
electrons to the oxygenase, where they are used
 
in catalysis. 
In systems where the ferredoxin is absent, the
 
reductase 
transfers electrons directly to the oxygenase. The
 
oxygenase 
component of these systems is responsible for catalysis.
 
This 
component consists of an alpha subunit, which contains both
 
a Rieske binding domain and a catalytic domain. In some 
cases,
 
a beta subunit is present, which is believed to

primarily function
 
as a stabilizer for the alpha subunits. 
Rieske Oxygenase (RO) systems of Burkholderia fungorum 
DBT1 is called dibenzothiophene dioxygenase [14]. While 
structural studies have
 
been performed on a number of ROs, 
no crystal structure exists for the DBT1 enzymes. 
Dibenzothiophene dioxygenase is able to degrade a wide 
spectra of molecules, including naphthalene, phenanthrene 
and DBT [16]. For its particular characteristics, Burkholderia 
fungorum DBT1 might be interestingly exploited in 
bioremediation protocols 
of 
PHA-contaminated 
sites. 
Ultimately, therefore, understanding the molecular basis of 
ligand-target interactions in this system may be fundamental 
for a complete characterization of the mechanism of action 
of the present strain and for future applications in 
bioremediation protocols 
of 
PHA-contaminated 
sites. 
Computational molecular biology (CMB)  and protein 
structural bioinformatics approaches are keys to face these 
challenges, especially when, as for this particular case, no 
crystal structures 
exist 
for the different molecular 
components. 
The work presented here is aimed at a structural 
characterization at the molecular level of the proteins 
involved in the first step of the PHA degradation pathway, 
i.e.,  the RO system. We have built the structural models of 
each of the components encoded in the Burkholderia 
fungorum DBT1 strain.  Although the work is in a 
preliminary phase, still several conclusions can already been 
drawn specially in the formation of protein complexes 
involved in the Kodama pathway.  
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
 
The sequence alignment of the different targets and their 
corresponding structural templates were extracted from the 
multiple sequence alignment considering the entire families 
of interest.  
We then constructed the models for each of the members 
of the RO complex of Burkholderia fungorum DBT1 strain. 
This was calculated as follows: all sequences and those of 
their families were retrieved from the Uniprot [17] database 
using ssearch [18]. They were aligned with PROMALS 
[19]. This multiple sequence alignment was then used for 
the definition of the Hidden Markov profile (HMM) of each 
of the target sequences. The profiles were then funneled 
through the HHsearch  [20] program to identify the most 
plausible homologous structural templates. Such procedure 
is currently one of the best ones as evaluated from CASP7 
experiment [21]. The multiple sequence alignments obtained 
in this way were used as the reference for the structural 
prediction of the different targets by homology modeling. 
The models were then built up by the use of the program 
Modeller9v4 [22]. Superposition of the structures, protein 
visualization and figures were carried out using the program 
VMD [23]. 
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Ferredoxin reductase. The nucleotide sequence of 
ferredoxin reductase component of dibenzothiophene 
dioxygenase complex was taken from some recent studies 
(data not published) that indicates the presence of a putative 
ORF that probably encodes for this subunit. This component 
of the dibenzothiophene dioxygenase complex was modeled 
by standard homology modeling  [24] [25] procedures by 
the use of the program HHpred [26] in a semi-automatic 
fashion, as described in the methods section. The subunit 
was modeled based on the corresponding subunit of  
Benzoate 1,2-Dioxygenase Reductase from Acinetobacter 
fungorum Strain ADP1 [27] (PDB code 1KRH). The 
sequence identity shared between the ferredoxin reductase 
subunit with its template is 24%. The sequence alignments 
are available as supplementary material (Fig. S1 [28]). The 
selected template was not co-crystallized with NADP 
ligand. So the functional structure was built by optimal 
superposition of the main chain of ferredoxin reductase with 
the main chain of the X-ray solved structure.  To improve 
the quality of the model we modeled the enzyme in a 
putative catalytic conformation, that is, with NADP ligand 
in the putative binding cavity. The ligand was manually 
transferred to the model from the structure of Pea FNR 
Y308S mutant from Pisum sativum  (PDB code 1QFY) 
following the procedure used by Deng et al. [28]. That is, 
using the program VMD, we superposed the main chain 
coordinates of our model to the main chain of 1QFY protein 
transferring NADP coordinates into our model. 
 
     Ferredoxin (Ac. N. AAK96190). This subunit of the 
dibenzothiophene dioxygenase was modeled by standard 
homology modeling using the same protocol and criteria of 
ferredoxin reductase (Fig. S2 [28]). The subunit model was 
built using as template the corresponding subunit from 
Sphingomonas yanoikuyae B1 ferredoxin [29] (PDB 
code 2I7F), which shears 50% the sequence identity. This 
operation was performed as described in the Methods 
section. Studies of the interaction of ferredoxin with  the 
reductase and with the oxygenase will be carried in a near 
future by the use of protein-protein docking techniques and 
validated by experiments. 
 
     Oxygenase (Ac. N. AAK62353 and AAK62354). The
 
oxygenase 
component 
(α 
and 
β 
subunits) 
of 
dibenzothiophene dioxygenase was modeled by standard 
homology modeling using the same protocol seen for the 
others components. The alpha/beta complexes were 
modeled based on the alpha/beta subunits of the Bifenyl 2,3-
dioxygenase from Sphingobium yanoikuyae B1. The 
sequence identity shared between the alpha and beta 
subunits with their templates is 49 and 37 % respectively. 
The sequence alignments are available as supplementary 
material (Fig. S3, S4 [28]). The selected template was not

co-crystallized with ligands. The functional hexamer (three 
alpha and three beta subunits) was built by optimal 
superposition of the main chain of the alpha/beta complexes 
with the main chain of the X-ray solved structure. To test 
the validity of our models we modeled the hexamer in a 
putative catalytic conformation, that is, with the ligands 
bound in the putative binding cavity. The moiety of 
dioxygenase with their cognate ligands were solved for a 
variety of members of the family, nevertheless, two 
structures were co-crystallized with ligands that also bind to 
dibenzothiofene, i.e., naphthalene and phenanthrene. These 
structures are the Naphthalene 1,2-Dioxygenase from 
Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIB 9816-4 [30] (PDB code 
2HMK) and Naphthalene 1,2-Dioxygenase [31] (PDB 
code 1O7G) from Pseudomonas putida. Therefore, using the 
program VMD, we superposed the main chain coordinates 
of our model to the main chain of 2HMK and of 1O7G 
protein. We then transferred naphthalene and phenanthrene 
coordinates respectively, into our hexamer model. In the 
supplementary material (Fig. S5 [28]), the high structural 
conservation of  the binding sites can be appreciated, 
showing the full conservation of the latter, although the 
ligands were transferred from independent crystal structures 
belonging to different species. The conservation of all the 
interacting residues, albeit the low sequence identity 
between templates and target, provide an initial, although 
non definitive, validation of the reliability of our models. 
Indeed, future work will include the virtual docking of 
dibenzothiofene into the binding cavity combined with 
experimental validation. The final modeled RO complex 
members can be appreciated in Figure 1.  
 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
In the present work, we aimed at the modeling of the 
initial step in the Kodama pathway for the degradation of 
PAHs by the Burkholderia fungorum DBT1 strain.  The 
availability of several templates covering the entire RO 
complex gave us the possibility of building not only the 
structural models of the isolated components but also to 
gain insight into the big protein complexes involved in the 
process. Although, the obtained results are preliminary and 
correspond to the first step of a lengthy iterative process of 
experimental and computational work, the possibility of 
modeling one of the most important proteins complexes and 
its validation with experiments extracted from literature, 
prompted us to hypothesize that more refined models will 
offer more a important overview of the system under study 
and may allow the full characterization of the entire 
pathway. Moreover, at the present stage site directed 
mutagenesis experiments can be already designed and 
proposed from the models. The extremely high three-
dimensional conservation observed in the binding cavities 
will allow the production of targeted mutants that may 
permit a deeper characterization of the enzymatic 
mechanisms. Our analysis and modelling procedures 
allowed us to find, in the alpha subunit of RO complex of 
Burkholderia fungorum DBT1 strain, an insertion of three 
amino acids very close to the active site that seems to be a 
duplication. This insertion is present only in Burkholderia 
fungorum DBT1 strain and could represent  a peculiar 
characteristic of DBT1 strain for substrate degradation 
efficiency. We are also involved in modelling of the 
complex between the alpha subunit of RO and the 
ferredoxin component and the transient complex between 
the ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase subunit in different 
activation states. This work, will be extended to the entire 
Kodama pathway with the aim of characterizing such an 
interesting and efficient PAH-contaminated degradation 
organism.
