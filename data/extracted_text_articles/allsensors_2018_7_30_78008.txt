Abstract— Our contribution indicates a novel solution for the 
development of the field of low-cost, printed thermocouples for 
energy 
harvesting 
and 
autonomous 
thermal 
sensors. 
Particularly, our work stems from the observation that the 
totality of printed thermocouples presented in literature relies 
on the conversion of a thermal gradient parallel to the plane of 
material deposition. This strategy is inherently inefficient and 
rarely applicable in real life scenarios. To overcome these issues, 
we introduced a novel concept of printed thermocouples, which 
use 3D-printing to define a vertical structure, upon which an 
out-of-plane thermal gradient can form and be harvested. Here, 
we 
perform 
thermoelectrical 
multi-physics 
simulations, 
employing parameters of nanomaterials extracted from 
literature, to show how this approach can lead to generate 
hundreds of microwatt in typical work conditions. Given their 
elevated thermopower, these structures could be employed both 
as autonomous sensors and energy harvesters in Internet of 
Things applications.

 INTRODUCTION 
As the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) has been 
steadily rising in importance and interest, the world of 
electronics found itself facing many complex and very 
exciting challenges. If, on one hand, the IoT might account for 
an economic impact of more than $10 trillion by 2025, on the 
other hand there is still a number of barriers – socio-ethical 
and technological -  to overcome [1].  One of the main areas 
of needed technical progress is represented by the realization 
of low-cost and low-power sensors, able to provide the 
necessary information to the computer-centralized data-
analysis structures [1][2]. Amongst the many quantities to 
measure and to collect, temperature is certainly one of the 
most important: its applications range from smart cities [3] to 
agriculture [4], from healthcare [5] to industrial processes [6]. 
However, as in autonomous or semi-autonomous IoT 
nodes the power supply of the sensing system is a major issue, 
conventional thermoresistive systems cannot be employed. 
One of the strongest candidates to solve this issue is 
represented by printed thermoelectric devices. Differently 
from thermoresistors, thermocouples are able to generate a 
voltage across junctions of p-type and n-type thermoelectric 
materials. As a result, they can be employed as both 
differential temperature sensors and energy harvesters. 
Furthermore, printed thermocouples, similarly to most printed 
devices [7], are characterized by facile production, low-cost 
and arbitrary shapes [8]. Classical printed thermocouples are 
composed of a number of junctions between p-type and n-type 
thermoelectric materials, printed on a plastic (or paper) 
surfaces [9][10]. This system, however, presents a significant 
drawback: in order to function properly, they need a thermal 
gradient parallel to the deposition plane. Although this 
condition is easy to fulfill in laboratory conditions, it is far 
from real life applications, where typical thermal gradients are 
transverse to the deposition plane. Examples include, and are 
not limited to, heat emitted from a living body, or the 
temperature inside the engine of a vehicle. The solution we

recently proposed to use an out-of-plane thermal gradient, 
while retaining the benefits of printed electronics, is the 
development of printed thermocouples with unneglectable 
vertical dimension [11]. This result can be achieved 
depositing thin film thermoelectric materials upon thick 3D 
printed vertical structures, as presented in Figure 1. With this 
approach, the insulating thick structure will help retaining a 
temperature separation between top and bottom side (∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶), 
and the thermoelectric material will be able to generate a 
proportional thermovoltage. In this contribution, we 
systematically investigate the voltage and power, which can 
be potentially generated by such structures, using as active 
thin film thermoelectric nanocomposites explored in recent 
literature. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In 
Section II, we briefly describe the methods employed for the 
thermal and electrical simulations. Subsequently, in Section 
III we describe the evaluation of an explicit function for the 
thermal gradient (III.A), followed by a calculation of the 
theoretical power (III.B) and by the comparison of results for 
different active materials. 
II. 
METHODS 
A. Thermal Simulations 
The geometrical structures have been drawn in a 
commercial multi-physics simulation toolbox (COMSOL 
Multiphysics®). The material considered for the bulk 3D 
substrate is Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), as it is 
commonly employed in desktop 3D-printers. The simulations 
were performed sweeping the temperature of a hot-side (i.e., 
the bottom of the structure depicted in Figure 1b), considering 
conduction and convection heat dissipation on all the surfaces, 
given an ambient temperature of 293 K. 
B. Electrical Power Estimation 
The generated power was estimated utilizing the 
theoretical formula conjunctly with the semi-empirical model 
described in the “Discussion and Results”. The electrical and 
thermoelectrical characteristics of the considered materials 
were extracted from the works of Suemori et al. [12], 
Montgomery et al. [13], Lu et al. [14] and our own laboratory 
measurements. 
III. 
DISCUSSION AND RESULTS 
A. Evaluation of the thermal gradient 
The multiphysics simulations show how the thermal 
gradient across the 3D structure is strongly dependent on the 
difference between room temperature and the hot side ∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴, 
and the step height h. A typical result is presented in Figure 2, 
with a width of the structure equal to 25 mm and a step height 
of 5 mm, when ∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴 = 60𝐾𝐾. The gradient retained by the 
structure is circa 28 K, which is a remarkable value. On the 
other hand, Figure 3 (a) shows the variation of ∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶 as a 
function of the step height, and parametrized to the gradient 
∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴 . Albeit an exact analytical representation of the 
phenomena might require a more in-depth analysis, by 
restricting the domain to small step height (i.e., h < 14 mm), it 
is possible to effectively approximate the behavior of the 
gradient with respect to h with a family of second order 
polynomial curves: 
 
 
∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶 = ∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴 ∗ (𝑎𝑎2ℎ2 + 𝑎𝑎1ℎ + 𝑎𝑎0)

hot side and cold side of the 3D-printed structures, as a function of the step

considered polynomial fit is sufficiently accurate, when the step height is

with 𝑎𝑎2 = −0.0029, 𝑎𝑎1 = 0.0796  and 𝑎𝑎0 = 0.1680 , 
yielding an adjusted 𝑅𝑅2 = 0.99. 
B. Calculation of the Generated Power 
First, given the electrical, thermoelectric and geometrical 
characteristics of the system, we calculated an analytical 
formula to describe the dissipated power in the considered 
structures. Electrical power will simply be: 
 
 
𝑃𝑃 = 𝑉𝑉2
𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇
 
(2) 
 
where RT  is the total resistance of the thin film, and V is 
the generated thermovoltage between the left and the right 
side. Defining an effective Seebeck Coefficient α, as the 
average between the coefficients of the p-type and the n-type 
material, and n, as the number of periodic cells, it is possible 
to write: 
 
𝑉𝑉 = 𝑛𝑛 𝛼𝛼 ∆𝑇𝑇(ℎ) 
(3) 
 
Concerning the overall resistance, it can be evaluated as 
the sheet resistance of the thin film, multiplied by the total 
length and divided by the width W. The latter is a design 
parameter, while the former can be evaluated as 2n times the 
sum of the horizontal connecting steps and the oblique walls. 
In formulas: 
 
𝐿𝐿𝑇𝑇 = 2𝑛𝑛 ൬
ℎ
sin(𝛾𝛾) + 𝑆𝑆൰ 
(4) 
 
𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇 = 𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠ℎ𝐿𝐿𝑇𝑇
𝑊𝑊𝑇𝑇
 
(5) 
 
 
 
Combining (2) – (5), a final expression for the electrical 
power can be derived as: 
 
 
𝑃𝑃 = 2 𝑛𝑛 𝛼𝛼2 𝑊𝑊 sin(𝛾𝛾)
𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠ℎ(ℎ + 𝑆𝑆 sin(𝛾𝛾)) ∆𝑇𝑇2(ℎ) 
(6) 
 
 
This formula highlights a linear dependency of the power 
from the number of periodic cells, and a proportionality to the 
square of the temperature gradient. As shown in the previous 
section, however, the temperature gradient can be 
approximated with sufficient accuracy by a second order 
polynomial curve. By plugging (1) in (6) it is possible to have 
an approximation of the theoretical generated power as a 
function of all the geometrical, thermoelectric and electrical 
parameters. The resulting equation (not shown, as it is just as 
informative as (6)) can then be used for a simple calculation 
or for parameters optimization purposes. 
C.  Comparison of different nanomaterials 
In order to find the effectiveness of such structure, a series 
of different nanomaterials from previous literature was 
considered. Since, as we previously showed [15], solution-
processable nanomaterials can be deposited in-situ on 3D-
printed 
objects, 
we 
selected 
the 
most 
promising 
thermoelectric nanomaterials considered in current literature 
[11]–[14]. In the first three works, the materials are employed 
by the respective research groups for the realization of planar 
devices, while the last work is our preliminary proof-of-
concept of 3D-printed out-of-plane thermocouples. In every 
case, the sheet resistance was calculated as the ratio of the 
conductivity to a layer thickness of 1 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇. The outputs of our 
calculation script are shown in Figure 4, which presents the 
generated power as a function of ∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴  and h, with fixed n 
(a) and power as a function of n and h with given ∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴 (b). 
The curves provide a useful toolbox for the choice of the 
optimal geometrical parameters. For instance, combining the 
results, it is possible to estimate the optimal h and the 
minimum number of periodic cells to achieve a target power, 
with a constraint on the temperature difference. 
Calculations performed on the different nanomaterials 
yield a complete picture on the efficiency of the different 
materials, when employed in the proposed out-of-plane 
configuration. Particularly, as presented in Figure 5 (a), 
among the Carbon Nanotubes (CNT)-based nanocomposites, 
the top performer resulted to be the one presented by Suemori 
et al. [12], because of its elevated conductivity, due to high-
purity Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes. The best 
performances, however, would be obtained employing the 
aqueous dispersion of (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆, 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵)2(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇, 𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇)3  nanowires, as 
presented by Lu et al. [14]. Finally, to evaluate the maximum 
power generated by this material, the simulations were re-
iterated for different thickness of the thermo-active layer 
(1 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇 to 5 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇). While still keeping the thickness below a

the semi-empirical model are collected in a series of plots, summarizing the 
theoretically acheivable power as a function of the step height versus 
ΔTHTA (a) and the number of steps (b)

reasonable target for common deposition methods, such as 
spray-deposition, this approach would yield even superior 
results: the generated power, with ∆𝑇𝑇𝐻𝐻𝑇𝑇𝐴𝐴 = 100 𝐾𝐾, can easily 
exceed the hundreds of microwatts. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
In this contribution, we introduced further advances 
towards the obtainment of a fully printed, cost-effective, out-
of-plane thermocouple. In our previous work, we presented 
three different 3D geometries, choosing the one with the best 
trade-off between the ability to keep the thermal gradient, and 
the overall produced voltage. Here, we present a 
comprehensive theoretical calculation of the maximum power 
that can be generated by such structures, applied to some 
known nanomaterials. The final results show how most of the 
CNT-based nanocomposites could generate few microwatts 
with a very limited temperature gradient. They, however, 
underperform, 
when 
compared 
to (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆, 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵)2(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇, 𝑆𝑆𝑇𝑇)3 
nanowires. Although these values are smaller than what 
previously reported in literature for printed thermocouples, the 
scenarios in which out-of-plane thermal gradients are required 
(e.g., body temperature, vehicle engine) are much more likely 
than for the planar counterparts. Finally, these sensors can be 
employed either as harvesters to power up sensor modules, or 
as energy-autonomous temperature sensors. 
For this reason, we believe this novel approach will be a 
significant step forward in the realization of cost-effective, 
energy-efficient and environmental-friendly sensor nodes for 
the Internet of Things.
