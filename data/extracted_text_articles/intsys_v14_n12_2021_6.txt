Abstract-The reliability of wind turbines system (WTS) is 
becoming a key issue as the penetration rate of wind energy is 
continuing to grow in the last decades. The reliability of a wind 
turbine is the reliability of all the components and sub-systems 
that compose the entire system. In this paper, we present a 
study of the wind turbines structures, currently used 
components and technologies.  A review of wind turbine 
maintenance data from multiple wind turbines firms installed 
in different countries and different climatic zones. The study 
aims to identify the most critical components of the different 
technologies used in WTS and the effect of the wind turbine 
structure on the global failure rate of the WTS. We focus on 
two of the most used configurations in WTS (Variable speed 
wind turbine with partial-scale converter and Variable speed 
wind turbine with a full-scale converter) and the power 
converters associated with these 
configurations. These 
converters represent one of the most fragile components 
according to the data of major reliability studies. The 
comparison between the reliability rate of the different WTS 
topologies show the importance of the choice of the 
configuration and power converter topologies to ensure the 
availability of WTS. 
Keywords-Power Electronic Converters; Wind turbine;

 INTRODUCTION  
In order to reduce the dependence of their countries on 
fossil fuels and to increase the production of electricity by 
clean energy. Government investment in renewable energies 
is increasing. Therefore, the renewable energy production is 
growing worldwide, in 2020, the global production capacity 
has reached 2799 GW, it is about a third of total installed 
electricity capacity. Wind power is the second most 
renewable energies installed in the word with 733 GW, 
which represents 26% of global energy renewable electricity 
production [1][2]. 
The used technology in wind turbine applications has 
changed since the power capacity penetration has grown 
dramatically to reach, for example, 14% of all electric energy 
consumption in Europe and 41% of all electric energy 
consumption in Denmark [3]. The first configuration used in 
wind turbine applications was a fixed-speed Squirrel-Cage 
Induction Generators (SCIGs) directly connected to the grid.  
Recently, as the power capacity of the wind turbines 
increases, regulating the frequency and the voltage in the 
grid becomes a very important issue. Manufactures are 
moving 
toward 
variable 
speed 
Permanent 
Magnet 
Synchronous Generator (PMSG) connected to the grid 
through a power converter. This configuration shows nice 
properties like high efficiency, small size, and low 
maintenance; hence, it is a nice choice for wind turbine 
applications.   
The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of recent 
converters technologies used in WTS. On the other hand, as 
reliability is a major challenge in WTS, a comparative study 
about the reliability of the converters is presented.  
In Section II, an overview of existing technology market 
developments of wind power generation. In Section III, the 
most used wind turbine configurations and currents 
promising power converters topologies for WTS are 
presented. In Section IV, the reliability of WTS components 
is analyzed. In Section V, as they constitute one of the major 
sources of failure, a study about the reliability of power 
converters used in WTS is presented. Finally, the 
conclusions are presented in Section VI. 
II. 
WIND TURBINE SYSTEMS  
The wind power 
installed 
capacity 
is growing 
significantly since 1999 to reach 93 GW installed only in 
2020. Therefore, the cumulative installed wind power 
capacity increased exponentially from 6100 MW in 1996 to 
733 GW in 2020. Estimation predicts that this number would 
reach 2015 GW in 2030. Approximately 10 countries have 
more than 83% of all cumulative installed wind power 
capacity in the world, including 5 countries in Europe 
(Germany, Spain, UK, France, Italy), 2 in the Asia-Pacific  
(China, India), 2 in North America (US, Canada) and 1 in 
Latin America (Brazil) [2]. This dominance is shown in 
Figure 1 and it is obvious that countries with high technology 
advancements have a higher growth rate and higher 
penetration of wind power electricity.

The large turbine presents a lot of advantages. They 
allow capturing a high power with low installation and 
maintenance costs compared to the small turbines. Hence, 
the size of the commercial wind turbine has greatly increased 
in the last decade, as presented in Figure 2. The largest wind 
turbine reported in 2021 is 12MW with a diameter of 220 m 
(General Electric Haliade-X 12 MW), and it will be tested to 
operate at 13MW. Siemens Gamesa has announced that they 
are developing 14 MW wind turbine with a rotor diameter of 
222 m. It announced that the turbine will be available in 
2024 [4]. 
Denmark based wind turbine company Vestas remained 
the world’s largest wind turbine manufacturer and supplier in 
2018 [5], due to its wide geographic diversification strategy 
and strong performance in the U.S. market.

Top 10 wind turbine manufacturers in the world are

companies account for over 75% of the global installed 
capacity every year, and their industrial dominance is 
expected to continue over the future.  
 
 
  
III. 
 WIND TURBINE CONCEPTS AND CONVERTERS 
TOPOLOGIES 
A. Wind turbine concepts 
Depending on the types of generator, power converters 
and speed control, most wind turbine structures can be 
classified into following four types: 
• 
Type 1: Fixed-speed wind turbine systems; 
• 
Type 2: Semi-variable   speed   wind    turbine     
with variable rotor resistance; 
• 
Type 3: Variable speed wind turbine with partial-
scale converter; 
• 
Type 4: Variable speed wind turbine with a full-scale 
converter. 
All these wind turbine technologies have been used and 
commercialized in the last 30 years. Due to their efficiency, 
the two last configurations are the most dominant 
technologies in the market. In the following, these two wind 
turbine concepts are going to be exposed. 
 
1)  Variable Speed Wind Turbine with a partial-scale 
converter 
Variable speed wind turbine with the partial-scale 
converter is generally associated with a doubly fed induction 
generator (DFIG), the typical configuration of this 
technology is shown in Figure 4. The induction generator is 
directly connected to the grid and the rotor is interfaced 
through a back-to-back power electronic converter. The 
converter system includes two AC/DC-based Voltage Source 
Converters (VSCs) connected by a DC-bus voltage. The 
power converter controls the rotor frequency and thus the 
rotor speed. Typically, the variable speed range is +30% 
around the nominal speed [7][8]. The main advantage is that 
only a part of the power production is fed through the power 
electronic converter. Hence, the nominal power of the power 
electronics converter system can be less than the nominal 
power of the wind turbine. In general, the nominal power of 
the converter is about 30% of the wind turbine power. The 
gearbox is essential in this type of configuration. Some 
commercial solutions using this technology are Repower 
6M, 6.0 MW; Bard 5.0, 5 MW; Senvion 6.2m 126; General

electric GE.6-82.5   and Acconica AW-100/ 3000, 3 MW; 
Shanghai el W3600/122, 3.6MW; Nordex N80,1.5-2.5MW; 
Sinovel, 3MW [21].  
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Variable-speed wind turbine with a partial-scale converter 
2) Variable Speed with a Full-scale Converter 
A variable speed wind turbine partial-scale converter is 
shown in Figure 5. In this configuration, the wind turbine 
uses a full-scale power converter between the generator and 
grid to enhance performance. Since all the generated power 
has to pass through the power converter, the power converter 
must be rated the same as generator capacity, which involves 
increasing the size, cost, and complexity of the system. 
However, the wind energy conversion efficiency is highest in 
this turbine compared to other types of turbines and the 
gearbox can be eliminated by using a high pole synchronous 
generator [13]. 
The PMSG, SCIG, and Wound Rotor Synchronous 
Generator (WRSG) have all been used in this type of 
configuration. However, due to the reduced losses, weight, 
and noise, the PMSGs are most commonly adopted and they 
are becoming the best seller technology in the wind energy 
market. Manufactures are commercialized several models of 
wind turbines based on PMSG full-scale technology: 
Goldwind GW140/3000; Enercon E126, 7.5 MW; Siemens 
Gamesa SG 8.0-167 DD, 8 MW; General electric Haliade 
150, 6MW; Multibrid M5000, 5 MW; Adwen AD 5-135 and 
Vestas V-112, 3 MW [7][20].

B. Converters For Wind Turbine System 
 
The power converter is one of the most important 
components of Wind Turbine System (WTS). The main 
objective of the power converters is to ensure the generator 
speed variation control in the turbine system. To accomplish 
this purpose, different topologies of converter have been 
proposed in the literature in the last decades. Recently, with 
the growing wind turbine penetration, these converters have 
to fulfil several technical requirements.  The converter cost is 
an important factor, since it represents approximately 
7%~8% of the global cost of the wind turbine system 
[9][10]. The cost of maintenance must also be as low as 
possible to reach less expensive and competitive energy 
compared with the others sources of energy, reliability is also 
an important element in the choice of the converters. The 
efficiency of the converters is also very important, especially 
in high power wind turbines where even, 1% efficiency 
improvement can save thousands of dollars over a period of 
a few years [20]. The output power quality of the converters 
is a primordial in the comparison between the different 
topologies. The output voltage should be as close as possible 
to the sinusoidal shape with low total harmonic distortion 
(THD) and small filter for a better converter [13][16][18]. 
The power converters can be classified as direct and indirect 
according to the different stages of the conversion. Overall, 
the indirect Back-to-Back (BTB) converter technology is the 
most used in the wind turbine applications [11]. 
 
1)  Two-levels Voltage Source Converter (2L-VSC) 
The two-level voltage source converters are the most 
widely used converters on the market. For its simple 
configuration this technology is mastered and well 
established in the field of wind energy conversion. It is 
considered a dominant topology used in around 90% of the 
wind turbines with power less than 0.75 MW. As illustrated 
in Figure 6, the Voltage Source Rectifier (VSR) and the 
Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) are back-to-back and are 
connected to a DC-bus capacitor. This DC-bus ensures the 
decoupling between the generator and the grid, therefore 
transient in the generator do not appear on the grid side. The 
VSR controls the torque and speed of the generator, while 
the VSI controls the voltage of the DC-link and the reactive 
power of the grid.  
The VSR and the VSI are generally made with low-
voltage transistors (LV-IGBT) arranged in a matrix. The 
switching frequency of VSR and VSI are fixed between 1 
and 3 kHz to achieve low witching loss and high power 
density [6].

2) Parallel two-levels Voltage Source Converter (2L-
VSC) 
To achieve high current capacity, two or more VSC 
converters can be connected in parallel depending on the 
power required. As illustrated in Figure 7, two VSC modules 
are connected in parallel to reach a power of 1.5 MW 
corresponding to type 4 of the wind turbines. For type 3 of 
the wind turbines, connecting two modules in parallel can 
achieve a power of 5 MW. This configuration allows a wide 
margin for redundant operation. To improve the system 
efficiency in the case of underproduction, one or more 
converter modules can be put out of service. The redundancy 
of the converters allows the wind turbine to continue 
operating at reduced capacity in the case of a fault in the 
converters, after the faulty module is isolated. In the Gamesa 
G128, more than 6 power converters are connected in 
parallel to reach a nominal power of 4.5 MW [12]. However,  
the major disadvantage is that a large number of modules 
lead to the complexity control and congestion of the system.  
 
Figure 7.  WTS with parallel connected BTB Two-levels VSCs  
 
3) Three-levels Neutral-Point Clamped Converter (3L-
NPC) 
Another solution that has been widely studied in the 
literature for type 4 of the wind turbines is the three-levels 
Neutral 
Point 
Clamped 
converter 
(NPC). 
In 
this 
configuration, an arrangement of four power switches per 
leg, clamped with diodes to a midpoint of the dc-link. With 
this configuration, each power device has to block only half 
of the total converter voltage then the power of the converter 
can be doubled [14].  The output phase voltage of the 
converter contains three-levels leading to a reduced voltage 
variations dv/dt and electromagnetic interference compared 
to the 2L-VSC converters [13][17][21][22]. The main 
drawback of 3L-NPC is that the power switches do not have 
symmetric losses, forcing a derating of the devices. As 
shown in Figure 8, NPC converters enable medium voltage 
operation, and commercial wind turbines reached 6 MW 
rated power without connecting serial or parallel switching 
devices. These converters are installed and marketed with the 
“Multibrid M5000” wind turbine [7] [23]. 
 
 
Figure 8.   Three-levels Neutral-Point Clamped Converter ( 3L-NPC) . 
 
4) Three-levels 
Active 
Neutral-Point 
Clamped 
Converter   (3L-ANPC) 
Active Neutral Point Clamp (ANPC) converters 
illustrated in Figure 9 have a structure almost identical to the 
NPC converters, the diodes are replaced by Insulated Gate 
Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) switches. Although more active 
switches are used, that allowing more redundancy to 
maintain the frequency and the same switching losses in all 
the IGBT switches [7][13][24][25]. In similar operations, 
BTB 3L-ANPC converters are capable of handling 32% 
higher power (up to 7.12 MW) and 57% higher switching 
frequency (1650 Hz) compared to 3L-NPC BTB converters.  
This configuration has been applied more recently in the 
field of MV drives and can also be used in the wind turbine 
system sector [19]. Vestas, one of the leading manufacturers, 
is currently studying this power converter topology [20].  
 
 
Figure 9.  Three-levels Active Neutral-Point Clamped Converter (3L-
ANPC). 
 
5) Three-levels Flying Capacitor  Converter (3L-FC) 
 
The configuration of the Flying Capacitor converter (FC) 
is similar to the NPC converter, where the clamping diodes 
are replaced by the floating capacitors. The concept of FC 
was introduced in the early 1970, and was introduced into 
machine drives applications in 1990. The converter generates 
additional voltage levels while reducing voltage stress on the 
drive [15]. The power switches, setting an FC between two 
devices, are illustrated in Figure 10. Each pair of switches 
with an FC constitutes a power cell.

Figure 10.  Three-levels Flying Capacitor Converter (3L-FC)  
The most important difference with the NPC topology is 
that the FC has a modular structure and additional cells can 
be connected, increasing the number of voltage levels of the 
converter and the power rate. 
The advantages of the flying capacitor multilevel 
converter are flexible switch mode, high protection ability to 
power devices, to control active power and reactive power 
conveniently [26][27]. The 3-levels configuration has found 
a practical application, but has not yet found a commercial 
success in wind turbines.  
IV. 
WIND TURBINE SYSTEM RELIABILITY  
Recently, 
with 
the 
orientation 
of 
wind 
energy 
manufacturers towards offshore wind turbines, the issue of 
the reliability of wind systems has become a major 
preoccupation due to the maintenance costs caused by 
limited accessibility of wind farms. This problem has been 
extensively studied in literature [28-33].To identify the major 
cause of failure in wind systems. Researchers have 
conducted surveys of the reliability of wind systems at 
various wind sites around the world to identify the most 
common faults in these systems:  
 
• 
CIRCE 
CIRCE is a research project on the reliability of wind 
systems conducted by the University of Zaragoza in Spain. 
SCADA data are collected over a period of three years on 
different wind farms, the totality of wind turbines studied is 
close to the 4300 onshore wind turbines of variable power 
between 0.3 and 3 MW. Two wind turbines configurations, 
geared and direct drive technologies are studied in the study. 
Data from the reliability analysis of the 23 wind farms 
included in this research are published in [34]. 
 
• 
CWEA 
The CWEA study is carried out in China over a period of 
two years between 2010 and 2012. The data are published in  
[35] where the data analysis of 640 wind turbines with a 
power between 1.5 and 6 MW is presented. In this study, 
only the critical faults are considered, and the published data 
do not allow to differentiate the types of technologies used in 
these wind turbines. 
 
• 
LWK 
In [35] the LWK project data are presented. The data are 
collected over a period of 13 years from onshore wind sites 
in northern Germany. In total, the maintenance data of 643 
wind turbines of power varying between 0.2 to 2 MW per 
wind turbine are exploited in this study. The reliability of 
wind power systems of both geared and direct drive concepts 
is studied and the failure rate of different components is 
exposed. 
 
• 
Huardian project   
The study includes maintenance data from 26 wind farms
 located in China. These sites are made up of 1313 wind turbi
nes of different technology  type  and of  unspecified  power. 
The study is published in [36], failures are presented as a pe-
rcentage, which makes it difficult to use the data. 
 
• 
EPRI 
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) based in the 
USA is at the initiative of this project. The data come from 
maintenance data from various wind farms in California. The 
number of wind turbines exploited in the study is small (290 
wind turbines) of very low power, which varies between 0.04 
to 0.6 MW. The technology of the wind turbines studied is 
very old, due to the fact that the study was carried out 
between the years 1986 and 1987. The study is published in 
[37].

ELforsk/Vindstat 
The study was published in [38], it is based on the 
recovery of maintenance data from wind farms in Sweden. It 
comprises 723 onshore wind turbines with a capacity of 
0.055 to 3 MW monitored between 1997 and 2004. The 
study provides the failure rate and downtime of the various 
wind turbine components for the period studied.

This study is based on maintenance data from the 
Muppandal wind farm in southern India. The data are 
published in [39], where an analysis of the performances, 
failure and reliability of 15 wind turbines with a power of 
225 kW are presented. The recovery of maintenance data is 
over a period of 4 years between 2000 and 2004.

NEDO 
The study is conducted by Japanese New Energy and 
Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) 
and published in [40]. The study took place over a period of 
one year between 2004 and 2005. The number of wind 
turbines included in this study is 924 turbines. Only, faults 
with a downtime, greater than 72 h are considered as a 
failure in this study. This explains the very low failure rate of 
the various components of a wind power system, and makes 
any comparison with other reliability studies subjective.

number of wind turbines contained in the study is 1500 wind 
turbines of different technologies and power varying 
between 0.03 MW and 1.8 MW. The study is rich in 
information, it allows us in particular to have the failure rate 
and the downtime of different wind turbine components over 
a long period of time.

University of Strathclyde 
In [47], maintenance data from 2220 turbines were 
studied to determine the failure rate in the various 
components of these systems. The wind turbines studied are 
modern types, with power ranging between 1.5 MW to 2 
MW. They are divided into two groups, depending on the 
training configuration. The first group is made up of 1800 
turbines based on the DFIG generators. The second group 
consists of 400 turbines equipped with the PMSG generators.

OWEZ 
Offshore Wind farm Egmond Aan Zee (OWEZ) is an 
offshore wind farm launched in 2007 in Netherlands. The 
site is made up of 36 Vestas V90 wind turbines, with a 
power of 3 MW per turbine. The maintenance data are 
published annually by NoordzeeWind and are analyzed in 
[42]. 
 
• 
University of  Nanjing  
In 2016, a study by the City University of Nanjing on 
two wind farms in China [43]: The first project, which 
contains 61 wind turbines of 1.5 MW, with data recovered 
over a period of 4 years between 2009 and 2013. The second 
project contains a few numbers of wind turbines, 46 wind 
turbines, but with a power greater than that of the first 
project, 2 MW by a wind turbine.  
 
Figure 11 shows the results of the most relevant studies 
published in the literature and obtained from data recovery at 
different wind turbine sites around the world [34-43]. The 
distribution of wind turbine system components over the 
different subsystems is presented in Table I. The results 
show that the defect distribution rate varies between the 
different studies and this is mainly due to two reasons: the 
location of the wind turbines studied: the climatic regions 
can have considerable effects on the reliability of certain 
components. The second reason is the technology used in the 
different wind turbines, the reliability of the wind systems is 
also related to the manufacturers and the importance given to 
the reliability of the components during the development 
phase.  
 
In this section, we focus on the result of some of majors 
studies. According to a study published by the University of 
Kassel, Germany in 2006 [44], based on the recovery of 
maintenance data for 13 years, the power converters are a 
leading cause of failure in a wind system as shown in Figure 
12.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Another study [45], shows that the use of maintenance data 
LWK allowed researchers to identify the main causes of 
failures on this site. The conclusions given in [45] show that 
the defects in the converters represent a large part of these 
defects.  They are ranked in 3rd position, just behind the 
faults in the electric system control and the mechanical 
defects in the rotor.  
 
 
Figure 12.  Share of main components of total number of failures [44]. 
More recently, in 2016, in the study [43], the researchers 
found different results: for the first project, the result shows 
that electrical systems (converters) account for 14% of the 
failures. The control of the wind system accounts for the 
largest share of these defects, with 35% of total defects 
recorded over this period. In the second project, the analysis 
of maintenance data over a period of two years shows that 
electrical systems (converters) account for 26% of failures, 
equal to failures rate found in the control system. 
 
   The wind turbines designed in 2000 are generally based 
on fixed or semi-variable speed technology, different from 
the technology generally used this last decade based on the 
synchronous machine with variable speed. It can be noted 
that the zone  of  the installation  of these fields also  plays an 
important role in the rates of defects of the components. 
Another point that can be made is that the reliability of wind 
turbine systems depends on the reliability of the used 
components and experience of the manufacturers. However, 
despite the difference in the failure rates between the 
different components of the wind system, which can be 
found in the different studies, the defects in the converters 
are considered as a major element in the shut-down of the 
service in the almost all of these studies.

V. 
CONVERTERS RELIABILITY IN WIND TURBINES 
APPLICATIONS  
In the following, a deep analysis of the different 
reliability studies  based on wind turbines around the world 
is proposed. The purpose of this analysis is to find a link 
between the different systems used in wind turbines and the 
failure rate in power converters. This study will allow us to 
identify the causes of failures in power converters and to 
propose the solutions and topologies to be used to improve 
the reliability of wind turbine systems. In [45] and [46], the 
results of the data recovered on the wind farms, affirm that, 
contrary to that is widespread in the literature, the failures in 
the systems with direct drive permanent magnet synchronous 
generator (PMSG) are more significant to those with indirect 
drive doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). In their 
conclusions, the authors ask questions about the usefulness 
of the systems based on PMSG generators with the number 
of failures recorded, while it is supposed to improve the 
reliability of wind turbine systems. In the same study of the 
University     of     Columbia  [46],  the failure   rates   in   the  
 
 
converters used in the case of the two systems (Geared/ 
Direct drive) are studied and compared. The failures at the 
converters are greater in the case where the system is based  
on direct drive technology. In another study presented in 
[47], maintenance data from 2220 turbines were studied to 
determine the failure rate in the various components of these 
systems. The wind turbines studied are modern types, with 
power ranging between 1.5 MW to 2 MW. They are divided 
into two groups, depending on the training configuration. 
The first group  includes of 1800 turbines based on the DFIG 
generators. The second group consists of 400 turbines 
equipped with the PMSG generators. It should be noted that 
the converters used in the two configurations belong to the 
same manufacturer, which will allow us to analyze and 
compare the failures of these converters for each 
configuration. The comparison between the failure rates of 
the power converters of the two systems illustrated in Figure 
13 shows that the converter in the direct drive system with 
PMSG generators presents an annual failure rate of 0.593, 
which is approximately four times more than the failure rates 
recorded in the system based on the DFIG generators.

In [32], Koutoulakos presented a study of 643 WTs in 
Schleswig Holstein (LKW) Germany. The wind turbines are 
either fixed or variable speed configuration, and geared or 
with the direct drive concept. The study includes a data 
failure rates per turbine per year for different wind turbine 
sizes. We divided the WTs into two groups based on power 
(0.5 to 0.6 MW group and around 1 MW group). Reliability 
data of the various wind turbine components are separately 
analyzed to identify critical subassemblies of each topology. 
The comparison of geared and direct drive topologies shows 
that; the larger WTs had longer downtimes and higher cost. 
In Figure 14, the result shows that the electric failures in the 
direct driven wind turbine are more frequent for the two 
groups.  
 
 
Figure 13.  Annual failure rate [47]. 
To answer the questions on the number of significant 
failures recorded in PMSG generators systems compared to 
systems based on the DFIG generators, asked by the authors 
in, [45][46].This difference is mainly due to the increase in 
failures in power converters. Knowing that for the same 
power value of a turbine, the used converter in the PMSG 
systems must have a power three times higher than that of 
the converter used in DFIG systems. Since in the latter case, 
the power supplied via the converter represents only part of 
the overall power supplied by the turbine. Since the 
maximum power of a two-levels converter does not exceed 
750 kW, to increase the powers in PMSG systems, 
manufacturers tend to put in parallel several two-level 
converters as presented in Figure 5. This solution enables  to 
increase the number of switches and proportionally to the 
number of failures in the system. Figure 14 illustrates a 
comparison between the failures of converters recorded in 
three studies [32][46][47] with turbines of different powers. 
It is noted that the increase in the power of the turbine 
generates the increase in the difference between failure rates 
between the DFIG systems and the PMSG systems, due to 
the need of paralleling the two-level converters to achieve 
the desired power.  
 
Figure 14.  Converters failures rates based on the power of the turbine 
[32][46][47]. 
In the literature, the reliability of the power converters is 
linked only to the redundancy of the system, something 
which could be sufficient in the case of onshore wind 
turbines. Furthermore, in offshore wind turbines where for 
economy and production reasons, the reliability requirement 
is more important, any source of failure must be considered. 
Therefore, in this study the analysis of several 
maintenance data from   different   wind   farms around the 
world, allowed us to identify the importance and the need to 
take into account the number of switches used in the 
converters as a criterion for the reliability of energy 
conversation systems. Moreover, the choice of the most 
reliable converter topology is depending on the power of the 
application. In Table II, an example of reliability of 
converters for a 5 MW wind turbine, in this case the 
paralleling of 2-level converters does not offer higher 
reliability since the number of switches, which are fragile 
components becoming very important and decrease the 
reliability of the whole system.  
Several attempts to develop methods to ensure continuity 
of service in converters have been developed in the literature. 
These methods can be classified into two categories, the one 
that uses hardware redundancy and the one that has no 
hardware redundancy. The first solution ensures continuity 
of operation in the nominal mode without power reduction 
while the second solution envisaged aims a degraded mode 
of the converter, which certainly continues to operate, but 
with lower power.  
The hardware redundancy generally requires the use of 
other additional components, it was used for the 2-VSL 
converters in [51-55]. The most popular technique is based 
on the addition of a redundant arm can be activated when a 
fault is detected in one of the converter arms, this arm will be 
isolated using triacs or fuses. The same solution is used in 
[48-50] for NPC converters with the addition of an NPC 
redundant arm or FC redundant arm, as illustrated in Figure 
15. Similar strategy is also used for ANPC converter as 
shown in [56-57].

Figure 15.  Redundant NPC Converter 
On the other hand, in order to improve converters 
reliability and availability, various controls strategies to 
improve the system response in case of defects without 
hardware redundancy were studied. In [58-59], the authors 
proposed a control method using voltage vector redundancy 
for a Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) inverter. Similar 
approaches that do not require additional components are 
applied for other three-level topologies, such as the T-type 
converter [60], the active NPC converter [61-63]. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This paper presents the current technologies used in wind 
power systems and those may be a possible solution for 
WTS in the near future. A particular focus has been placed 
on power converters, as they are one of the most important 
components in the energy conversions in wind power 
systems. The other important point that we mention in this 
study is the reliability of wind power systems, a study of the 
various research and data available in the literature on the 
reliability of wind power systems is presented. Then an 
analysis and a comparison of the reliability between the 
different topologies used in wind power systems have been 
developed. This analysis allows us to observe: 
                                                                                                          
-The data from different studies on the reliability of the 
component of wind turbine systems may be different and it is 
mainly due to: the different meteorological conditions of the 
wind turbines firms studied ;  the different manufacturers and 
the importance that they give to the reliability in their 
designing processes; and the definition that researchers give 
to failure. For example, in the NEDO study, only 
breakdowns, which cause 72 hours of downtime are 
considered as failure, it explains the low rates of failures in 
this study.   
-The choice of the converters is important in the global 
wind turbines systems. The two-level converters are most 
used but with the current trend towards systems with high 
power levels and high voltage levels, multilevel converters, 
especially three-levels NPC converters represent the most 
suitable system. For reliability of the power converter issues, 
the failures at the converters are proportional to the number 
of switches used in the energy conversion system. 
- The majority of recent studies claim that, contrary to 
popular belief, failures in systems based on PMSG 
generators are greater than failures in systems based on the 
DFIG generators. In our study, we explain the reasons, 
which are mainly due to the significant increase in failures in 
the power converter systems. However, systems based on the 
PMSG generators remain the most reliable for onshore wind 
turbines since the downtime caused by a failure at the 
converters is significantly lower than that caused by a failure 
of the gearbox.  
 
In the literature very few studies allow access to 
components maintenance data according to the structure of 
the studied wind turbines, most of this research separates the 
studied wind turbines only according to their power. Except 
these information are important for comparative analyzes 
and to deduce more reliable conclusions.
