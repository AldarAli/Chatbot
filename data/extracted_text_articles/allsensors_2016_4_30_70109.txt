Abstract—We have demonstrated the phenomenon of active
plasmonic
grating
structure
for
active
surface
plasmon
polaritons propagating along 2-D grating at an organic/metal
interface via Surface Plasmon Grating Coupled Emission
(SPGCE) for enhancing and tuning far-field light emission.
Our results showed that strong coupling resonances in SP-
coupled emission from the interactions of organic/metal and
metal/air symmetric mode lead to the enhanced optical
properties of directional emission. Such scattering taking place
through a metal film has an important bearing on the
generation of useful light. Further investigations will be
performed on SPPs with the integration of optimized organic
electroluminescent plasmonic for active biosensor devices in
biochemical analysis and immunoassay.

INTRODUCTION
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) phenomenon was
described in 1980 and has been used for sensing for the past
three decades [1][2]. SPR biosensors are optical sensors
using polarized Surface Electromagnetic Waves (SEW) to
probe molecular interactions between metal film surface and
dielectric medium. SPR sensors have the advantages of high
sensitivity, label-free and real-time detection [3]. In this
paper, the coupling Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) on
the nano-grating, the active plasmonics band-gap structure
for bio-plasmonics are demonstrated. The presented results
show that the enhanced performance of plasmonic on nano-
grating,
the
active
plasmonics
band-gap
structure
is
important
for
the
structure
design
of
novel
optical
biosensors.
The motivation of this research is to develop an accurate,
integrated SPR sensor system chip using existing organic
electroluminescent
plasmonic
technology
due
to
its
sensitivity and label-free advantage. We will propose a novel
design of SPR device without using external light source and
polarizer to have the same features of SPR, i.e., high
sensitivity and real time. We can then observe the signal
changes due to the presence of surface molecule or specific
absorption wavelength of multiple samples. An all-in-one
SPR sensor system chip with the capability of sensing
applications in drug discovery, drug development testing or
different kind of viruses and poison will be realized to
eliminate large casualties in wars, terrorist activities or virus
infections.

EXPERIMENT PROCEDURES
The excitation of organic semiconductor molecules by
Surface Plasmon Grating Coupled Emission (SPGCE) is
intended to demonstrate the effect of coupled active SPPs on
the plasmonics response of a grating nanostructure with
organic material on the surface. Our fabricated different
pitch grating device consists of coupled organic/metal
nanostructure
with
specific
width
and
symmetric
and
asymmetric dielectric plasmonic band-gap structure. In
particular, it is found that emission is significantly inhibited
in the vicinity of the gap, and that the modified emission
spectrum is determined by the wavelength dependence of the
density of SPP states. We present recent experimental results
discuss potential applications of such active plasmonic
biosensor with enhanced resonance energy emission due to
interactions on the organic/metal nano-grating. We report the
design and development of organic semiconductor devices
for chemical and biological sensing. A plasmonics-based
biosensor was demonstrated using an organic SPGCE as an
excitation source. In addition, the possibility of biological
immunoassay for sensors based on active SPGCE was
explored, as shown in Figures 1(a-c).
The interaction of SPR on a periodic grating of metal and
polymer were investigated in theory and experiments [4]-
[14]. In addition, we proposed a novel design of plasmonic
biosensor without using the conventional external light
source and polarizer to produce SPR having the same
features, i.e., high sensitivity and real time. It can induce
SPR wave on the metallic surface when proper resonant
condition is matched by nano-grating coupled emission [4]-
[7].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We have shown experimentally that strong coupling
between electronic and photonic resonances in metal grating
and polymer grating really exist. Resonance angle plots of
reflectivity of a metal nano-grating sensor, demonstrates the
sensitivity of a refractmetric experiment, ∆θ/∆n=36.4 (λ=643 
nm) and ∆θ/∆n=69.7 (λ=833 nm). In active plasmonic, our 
fabricated grating device of various pitches consists of
coupled Au (gold) and polymer nanostructure with specific

width and symmetric/asymmetric dielectric SP band-gap
structure. In pitch modulation, results showed that grating at
different pitch can match a linear shifting of momentum of
about ∆k =4.79 μm-1 and ∆θ =11 degree per 100 nm pitch 
size. In layer modulation, the resultant emission intensity can
achieve a maximum enhancement of 6 times for the 4-Layer
device and the Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) was
less than 50 nm. We can then observe the emission signal
changes due to the presence of surface molecule or specific
absorption
wavelength
of
multiple
samples.
This
phenomenon gives rise to a selective spectral response and a
local field enhancement, which can be used for modulation
in
the
nano-optics.
The

interface
reciprocal
interactions
that
the
optical
absorption,
emission
and
scattering properties of metal nanostructures can be used to
control the decay rates, intensity and FWHM and direction
of luminescence emission.
The preliminary results of these prototypical systems
based on active plasmonics look very promising. The use of
active plasmonics may lead to new biosensors that are small,
portable, inexpensive, fast, without the need of label-free or
any chemical modifications, and biosensors that are capable
of detecting low concentrations of specific analytes with high
sensitivity, as well as selectivity, as shown in Figure 2 (a-c).
We will optimize the active plasmonics and
sensing
component, which will have the benefit of expanding its
application in various fields, including biochemical and
antibody/antigen analyses, as well as enhancing its dynamic
range due to the higher sensitivity. Such scattering taking
place through a metal film has an important bearing on the
generation of useful light. Further investigations will be
performed on SPPs with the integration of optimized organic
electroluminescent plasmonic for active biosensor devices in
biochemical analysis and immunoassay. In our calculation,
the grating pitch is set at 400 nm. Here, εd of air is 1, alcohol
(1%) is 1.329, DNA (0.1mM) is 1.405, and Ethanol (1%) is
1.363 in our calculation. Figure 3 shows the calculation
results from the SPR parameters given above. With an
increasing value of εd, one can see a right shift of the ω-k
curves, which correspond to an increase in momentum space.

CONCLUSION
We demonstrated the SPGCE from excited organic layer
on different metal grating in organic/metal structure. Our
results showed that strong coupling resonances in SP-
coupled emission from the interactions of Alq3/Au and
Au/air symmetric mode leads to the enhanced optical
properties of directional emission, intensity and FWHM for
active plasmon devices. Such scattering taking place through
a metal film has an important bearing on the generation of
useful light. Further investigations will be performed on
SPPs
with
the
integration
of
optimized
organic
electroluminescent plasmonic for active biosensor devices in
biochemical analysis and immunoassay. This indicated a
potential
application
of
disposable
and
point-of-care
biosensor.
