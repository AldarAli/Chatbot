Abstract—Over the last few years, with rapid population growth
in the biggest cities of the world, issues like air pollution, water
scarcity, and intense trafﬁc conditions, have become more evident.
Trying to mitigate them, the concept of Smart City was presented,
which uses technology and human resources to manage urban
resources in a sustainable manner. As new scientiﬁc researches
about this phenomenon are being carried out, the importance
of both human and technological resources remain implicit in
the development of Smart Cities. But, it is not clear what role
is occupied in the different stages of evolution, which leads a
city to be considered Smart. Given this context, in this paper we
used the SLR method to analyze scientiﬁc publications, and thus
to determine what is the role of the human factor, represented
by people, and technological, represented by sensors, in the
development of smart cities. We also created the overview of the
scientiﬁc research, and can identify the most and least studied
areas among those addressed in this study.
Keywords–Smart City; Sensors; IoT; People; Open Innovation.
I.
INTRODUCTION
In the last century, the number of cities in the world with
more than 1 million inhabitants jumped from 20 to 450. In
2007, the number of people living in urban centers exceeded
50% of the world population and it is estimated that this
number will reach 70% by the year 2050 [1]. The fast growth
of the population in urban centers makes us face problems
like the deterioration of public transportation services, decrease
of air quality and increase of unemployment, etc. [2]. When
dealing with these issues, it is necessary to use creativity,
human resources, and cooperation between the different areas
of the society and good ideas [3].
Technology is a way to solve the problems caused by
the population growth in urban centers. Some, such as the
IoT (Internet of Things), are used in the context of Smart
cities due to their potential to improve the life quality of
the population [4]. Not only investments in technology should
be taken into account when thinking about sustaining Smart
Cities, but human and social capital must be used as a fuel for
economic growth and high quality of life by using the natural
resources in an intelligent way, through government policies
that involve the society [3].
In the current scenario, every initiative is important if
it helps understand the growth of great urban centers and
how it occurs, as well as what measures should be adopted
to extinguish the problems caused by it, from a scientiﬁc
and economic point of view. Through a Systematic Literature
Review (SLR), a panorama of the current scientiﬁc research
will be presented, dealing with the relationship between people
and sensors with the development of modern cities, which are
Smart Cities.
The problem considered in this work may be described the
following way: There is a large number of works approaching
the participation of people and the use of sensors in Smart
Cities. There is a need to visualize the current panorama of this
research line in a broad way in order to identify open issues,
as well as identifying researches to be used for accelerating
the studies of this ﬁeld.
In this work, we intend to provide the current panorama
of the scientiﬁc researches made in the ﬁeld of Smart Cities
that talk about their development based on the participation of
people and the use of sensors, based on the Systematic Review
methodology, according to what Kitchenham [5] proposed.
In this work, the term ”development” is used to identify
the initiatives of creation of new Smart Cities, as well as
the improvement of those that already possess management of
natural resources and monitoring of basic services and wish to
improve them. Also, the term ”sensors” includes sensors that
receive information on the environment, actors that execute
actions and transform the environment they live in and other
technologies related.
This work is organized as follows: Section II presents
the necessary concepts to understand the rest of the research;
Section III presents the methodology used; Section IV presents
the research protocol used; Section V exposes the results
obtained from the execution phase of the protocol and presents
the analysis of the results and ﬁnally, Section VI exposes the
conclusions, suggestions for future researches and the ﬁnal
considerations.

SMART CITY
The term Smart City has been used for 20 years and it has
evolved due to concerns about the service supply and resource
consumption [6], which are increasing with the growth of
urban centers. According to Nam et al. [2], the term Smart
City can be approached according to three perspectives: (1)
Technological Elements: Hardware and software infrastructure;
(2) Human Elements: creativity, diversity and education; (3)
Institutional Elements: governance and politics. A city may
be considered as a smart one when investments in social
and human capital and Information Technologies infrastructure
transform environmental growth and improve quality of life
through participative governance [3].
The use of the word smart as a label for future cities is
not by chance. In marketing words, smartness focuses on the
248

ICSEA 2015 : The Tenth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances

perspective of the user [7], and it is related to a fast mind,
with efﬁcient answers. Smart Cities need to adapt themselves
rapidly to the needs of their citizens and provide customized
interfaces [2]. Technology is a way to reach it. In this context,
Smart Cities can be deﬁned, according to Kehua et al. [8],
as the use of information and technologies of communication
to measure, analyze and integrate the information of the
main services of a city. This way, Smart Cities may respond
intelligently to different types of need, including daily mainte-
nance, environmental protection, public safety and commercial
activities.
A. IoT
At the same time the access to the Internet becomes easier,
computer devices are getting smaller and more popular through
mobile devices with the evolution of the industry over the
years. IoT can be deﬁned as a global network infrastructure
with the ability to self-set itself based on interoperable com-
munication patterns and protocols, through physical and virtual
things have an identity, physical attributes and smart virtual
interfaces integrated through an information network [9].
Smart Things networks promise to revolutionize the mon-
itoring of environments in a great variety of application do-
mains due to their reliability, efﬁciency, ﬂexibility, low cost
and easy installation [10].
B. Smart City and People
The concept of Smart Cities only makes sense when we
talk about the presence of people as target audience of the
beneﬁts achieved through the use of technology and other ways
to improve quality of life. According to Washburn et al. [11],
what makes a city smart is the use of technology to provide
basic services for the citizens in an efﬁcient way.
Smart Cities are human cities with multiple opportunities
to explore the human potential and turn life into a more
productive life [2]. Technological issue, very present in the
current conception of smart cities, becomes secondary in the
views centered in the social and human part.

METHODOLOGY
In this section, we present the methodology used.
SLR is, almost always, the initial phase of any research
[12]. The purpose is to accumulate more knowledge about
the subject the research is about. SLR goes beyond a simple
literary review because it uses scientiﬁc methodology and
provides a way to integrate studies, creating generalizations
about the subject.
This modality of study is a way to identify, evaluate and
interpret a relevant part of the research about a speciﬁc matter
of the research, area or phenomena of interest [5].
According to Petersen et al. [13], the need to carry out
systematic reviews is that as a speciﬁc area matures, a lot of
research is made, which generates a great number of primary
works that need to be summarized.
Systematic review uses the review protocol as its main tool,
which deﬁnes a series of steps that must be followed in order
to get to a conclusion [12]. These steps must be very well
deﬁned so other people can reproduce the same process to
validate the study.
The systematic review model used in this work, is based
on the proposal of Kitchenham [5] and performed by Oliveira
et al. [14], Budgen et al. [15] and Ribeiro et al. [16]. Biolchini
et al. [12] proposed a model used on the protocol.
The model is based on three main phases: (1) Planning:
the research objectives and the research question are deﬁned;
(2) Execution: primary studies are identiﬁed, selected and
evaluated according to the criteria of inclusion and exclusion
deﬁned during the Planning phase; (3) Presentation of Results:
presentation of the report with the information obtained during
the previous phase.
Described phases may seem sequential, however, many
tasks performed in each one of the phases can be started in
the Planning phase and concluded only during the Execution
phase.
Biolchini et al. [12] describe the three phases through a
chart, as seen in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Three stages SLR process.
According to them [12], the process of systematic review
can be divided into ﬁve steps:
•
Problem formulation. Aims to deﬁne what kind of
evidences will be included in the review. On this step,
the criteria that will help the researcher deﬁne which
studies are relevant for his research should be set;
•
Data collection. The objective is to deﬁne which will
be the sources to acquire evidence;
•
Data evaluation. Aims to deﬁne which information
will be used in the research. Quality criteria must be
applied in order to distinguish the valid studies;
•
Analysis and interpretation. Synthesizing data is the
main goal to create generalization about the researched
subject in order to determine if it can be solved or not;
•
Conclusion and presentation of the results. The objec-
tive is to decide which information will be presented in
the ﬁnal report, since not all the information obtained
in the data analysis are relevant for the research.

IV.
PROTOCOL DEFINITION
Protocol deﬁnition is the ﬁrst step of the research devel-
opment. Using the problem related in the Introduction of this
work, a research question was elaborated with the objective
of conducing the research procedures. We may deﬁne this
question as: Q01 (Question 01) What is the role of people
and sensors in the development of Smart Cities?
Novais et al. [17] suggests the division of the research ques-
tion into sub-questions in order to provide greater coverage.
Thus, Q01 was subdivided: Q1.1. What is the inﬂuence of
the participation of people or use of sensors in the study?;
Q1.2. What is the level of previous infrastructure so the study
proposal is viable?; Q1.3. What stage of social organization
the city needs to be in so the study is viable?; Q1.4. What
is the contribution of the study for the scientiﬁc community?;
Q1.5. How was the study validated?; Q.1.6. What was the
main feature of the city affected by the study?.
After deﬁning what will be observed, the next step is
selecting the research bases of the research, which were:
•
Compendex (CPE);
•
IEEExplore (EXP);
•
Science Direct (SDI);
•
Scopus (SCO).
Besides the chosen research bases, a manual research
through the references of the publications was made, based
on the initial researches, restricted to articles, thesis and
dissertations in English.
A research expression was deﬁned to be used in the
consultations in each one of the research bases, using the
research question as a guide. The expression used was: EX01
- (((digital OR smart) AND (city)) AND (development OR
creation OR expansion)) AND (iot OR ict) AND (people OR
citizen)).
After researching in the chosen bases, the results obtained
were exported and stored.
The approach to select the primary studies follows the
guidelines of Barcellos et al. [18], which suggest only the
need to deﬁne exclusion criterion in order to select relevant
studies. This way, four steps were deﬁned and for two of them,
exclusion criterion were deﬁned as well. Details are presented
in Table I. The stages can be described as follows:
•
ST01. The search must be done in the selected bases
SCO, EXP, SDI and CPE using the search expression
EX01. Results obtained must be stored to facilitate
future consultation;
•
ST02. This stage eliminates primary studies that do
not attend the purposes of this study;
•
ST03. Publications not excluded on the previous step
will be re-evaluated based on their title, abstract or
full text;
•
ST04. Search for referenced of the remaining publi-
cations must be made.
Data extraction consists in taking relevant information that
may help solving the research question through the reading of
the text and the metadata.
A test before the ﬁnal protocol execution must be con-
ducted to assure it is correct, in order to identify possible
failures introduced during their deﬁnition. The test must be
carried out in a reduced portion of the total bases to be used
in the conduction of the research [18].

A protocol test was conducted using the CPE and SDI bases
with this purpose. Results obtained in the execution of the test
were left out; however, they were satisfactory and enabled the
protocol execution to be conducted without any changes.
A. Quality Assessment
According to Kitchenham [5], quality criterion can be used
to help analyzing and resuming the data obtained, identifying
subgroups among the selected studies. This way, a checklist
was set with some items that must be applied to the selected
studies after executing the ST03 stage.
Quality assessment will help determine if the quality of the
analyzed studies inﬂuences on the results of the publications.
The assessment can be made in parallel to the activity of
reading publications.
Issues related to evaluating the quality of the studies are
presented in Table II.

RESULTS
After the protocol approval, the other stages were executed.
The result can be seen in Table III. In this table we can notice
that, in the ﬁrst stage ST01 the number of publications is rather
high, a total of 1121 publications, which were evaluated in the
following steps according to the selection criteria. In the stage
ST02, 61 publications were excluded and , in the stage ST03,
the number of excluded publications was 1030.
After applying the exclusion criterion, the manual search
for references of the selected publications was made and
the general results can be seen in Table IV, as well as
the manual search. This table presents a summary of the
selection of publications result. The publications included in
the stage ST01 were found, so as the publications included

in the stage ST04, matching with the manual search. The
exclusions realized in the stages ST02 and ST03 are also
detailed, classiﬁed according to the search tool that have been
used.
45 publications were obtained after executing all the steps.

Results of the evaluation of the publications in each one
of the sub-questions were compared with the other results.
Therefore, deep analysis of the obtained data could be made,
once the isolated observation of the results is not enough for
the research question to be cleared.
Crossings between the research sub-questions are num-
bered in Table VI.
A. Question Q1.1 Analysis
During these two phases of development of the Smart
Cities, the Sensor element stands out in the Chaotic and
Managed levels of organization.
In the initial level of organization, the People element is
the one with more highlight. This happens due to the approach
of human resource in many publications as a collaborator in
data production, along with the sensors.
Last two levels of technological organization, Integrated
and Optimized, were the less approached levels among the
analyzed publications. A small amount of cities around the
world with characteristics that put them in these two last levels
is what partly explains this fact.
The ﬁrst level of social organization, the Chaotic, was
the one that obtained the highest number of publications,
which is explained by crowdsensing and other data collection
techniques. In the last two levels, the People element obtained
a higher number of publications.
The result of this research points out that when a society
is not organized to sustain initiatives to create a Smart City,
Technology is the most expressive element to start the process,

generating more engagement of the population in the subse-
quent levels, when there is already a favorable environment.
Thus, the result obtained through the analysis of the charts
in Figures 2 and 3 indicate that in cities with no infrastructure
and control of their resources nor promote participation of the
population in the decision-making processes,the administration
of the city prefer to invest their efforts to acquire technologies
that allow us to go forward towards a Smart City. Then,
technology is an enabler of future innovation in the ﬁeld of
the city.
When there are available infrastructure and the engagement
of the population in the city affairs, even if it is in a precarious
way, it is possible to notice that human resource is the most
discussed issue, indicating the inﬂuence it may have on the
development of the city.

sub-questions Q1.1 and Q1.4. We can see the elements People
and Sensors in it, distributed according to the scientiﬁc con-
tributions made. Generally speaking, the technological issue
was the most inﬂuent in all categories, except the last two,
Environment and Natural Resources and Popular Participation.
The result presented reinforces the statement of Chourabi
et al. [63] that the study of people and communities is critical
in the context of Smart Cities, however, it is being neglected.
The element People presented a small advantage in the cat-
egory Environment and Human Resources, demonstrating the
human perception of the environment is being explored in the
monitoring of natural resources and urban environment, being
as important as the sensors in the information acquisition. The
same element was the most inﬂuential in the category Popular
Participation, an awaited result due to its direct relationship
between people and concepts, such as crowdsensing, open
innovation, crowdsourcing and open participation.
Figure 5 represents the chart from crossing the results of
the sub-questions Q1.1 and Q1.5. We can see the elements

validation of each publication.
Figure 5. Result of questions Q1.1 and Q1.5.
The element People was the one with greater highlight in
the publications that adopted Implementation and Case Study
as a way of validation, obtaining only 1% (one percentage
point) more than Sensors in the Case Study way. This lower
number of the element Sensors related to human perspective is
because many publications about the technological perspective
maintained themselves in more theoretical subjects, with no
need of validation that would ﬁt one of the two validation
categories deﬁned in this work.
Figure 6 presents the chart from crossing the results of the
sub-questions Q1.1 and Q1.6. We can see the elements People

Cities of the analyzed publications.
Data presented followed a trend. In the ﬁrst four areas
(Economy, Environment, Mobility, Governance), sensors were
the most inﬂuent, while in the areas of Housing and People it
was the element People the most inﬂuent. Generally speaking,
results of the analysis of the combination of these two sub-
questions may indicate there should have more balance when
approaching both elements in every area. The least inﬂuenced

area was Economy, while Mobility was the most. It can be
explained by the low event of publications about economical
matters, while there were many talking about technological
issues.
B. Question Q1.4 Analysis
Analyzing the chart of Figure 7 that presents the results of
the sub-questions Q1.4 and Q1.5 together, it is expected to be
able to determine which are the most used ways of validation
in each research area. Firstly, the greatest part of the non-
validated publications talked about the theme of this research
in a theoretical way or those about works in progress. Popular
Participation was the area with more validated publications
through implementation and case studies.
In a general way, Implementation was the most used way
to validate the efforts, which made it a little ahead the Case
Study. It may indicate that Implementation is the most used
way of validation because there are not many options to test
the previously available proposals, which made the researchers
responsible for developing their own tools to validate their
proposals. Testbeds and Living Labs are initiatives that may
help.
Analyzing the chart of Figure 8 presenting the results of
the sub-questions Q1.4 and Q1.6 together, the intention is to
identify the most researched areas of the Smart Cities and
those that need more attention, taking into account the deﬁned
research areas.
Initially, it is possible to notice the concepts of the eco-
nomic elements were not explored. The research area of
Infrastructure did not emphasize technological elements of the
areas of Governance, People and Economy and there were
also no researches about services in the areas of Housing and
Environment. Those numbers suggest more research should be
developed in these areas.
Second, the result presents coherent numbers between the
two analyzed dimensions, like the cases of the areas of Envi-
ronment and Natural Resources and the area of Environment,
between the areas of Infrastructure and Mobility and between
the areas of Popular Participation and People.
As for the rest of the results, it is possible to observe that
concepts about all areas of Smart Cities were researched and
Figure 7. Result of questions Q1.4 and Q1.5.
Figure 8. Result of questions Q1.4 and Q1.6.
Popular Participation was also in their agendas. Economy was
the only exception in both cases, when it was not mentioned.
In a general way, it is possible to conclude that more
researches about the economic features of Smart Cities are
necessary.
C. Question Q1.6 Analysis
Due to the cross-analysis of the result of sub-question Q1.6
with sub-questions Q1.3 and Q1.3, it is expected to determine
which areas of the Smart Cities are more researched during
the phases of technological and social evolution.
Result of crossing sub-questions Q1.2 and Q1.6 is shown
in the chart of Figure 9. Governance was the area that received
more attention, followed by People, Mobility and environment,
as observed in the chart. Housing and Economy were not
mentioned. This result may point to a city in the Chaotic level
as Governance as the area that should get more attention, since
it deals with the decision making about the future of the city.
Only Governance was not mentioned in an initial level,
while Environment was the most discussed area followed by

People, Mobility, Housing and Economy. This result may
indicate that, in an initial level, Environment is the level that
should get more attention.
Mobility was the area that received more attention in a
Managed level, indicating that when there is infrastructure,
the trend is to try improving it.
Integrated and Managed levels were the least explored
among all the evaluated publications. For this reason, it is not
possible to conclude anything from the presented chart.
Figure 10 shows a chart that presents the result of the
crossing between sub-questions Q1.3 and Q1.6.
Through the chart is possible to notice that in the Chaotic
organization level there is more concern with the areas of
Governance, Mobility and Environment. However, the number
of studies about the People area in this level was zero.
According to its deﬁnition, in this stage the level of social
organization is zero, which demonstrates the evaluated studies
talk about an environment where the Popular Participation is
already in a more elevated level.
Figure 9. Result of questions Q1.2 and Q1.6.
Figure 10. Result of questions Q1.3 and Q1.6.
The initial level concentrates a bigger number of publica-
tions. In this level, Economy was the only area not explored
due to the low incidence of publications about this area. Most
explored areas in this level were Mobility and Environment,
indicating that caring for the environment and technology used
in the city are considered more important in this level.
D. Quality Analysis
As deﬁned in the revision protocol, a qualitative evaluation
of the 45 selected publications was made in order to avoid
biases in the selected publications. Results of this analysis are
shown in Table VI.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
SLR was the method used in this work, to create a
panorama of the scientiﬁc research about the participation of
people and use of sensors to develop Smart Cities. Based on
the work of Kitchenham [5], a revision protocol was developed
so the SLR could be executed.
Results obtained during the protocol test show it could
be used in a consistent way to reach the objectives of this
study. Through the research sub-questions, deﬁned during the
elaboration of the revision protocol, it was possible to direct the
analysis of the publications to reach the general and speciﬁc
objectives deﬁned for this study.
The general objective was to provide the current panorama
of the scientiﬁc research made in the area of the Smart Cities
that explore their development based on the participation of
people and use of sensors. We reached it by making a bi-
dimensional analysis of the research sub-questions results. We
could notice that people and sensors have great importance
when developing Smart Cities. Their importance changes ac-
cording to the level of technological and social development
each city is in, as well as the needs each city deﬁnes as priority.
It was also possible to classify the studies based on
different technical and scientiﬁc criteria, as well as identifying
many areas that need more attention of the scientiﬁc area when
it comes to popular participation and use of sensors in the
development of Smart Cities. Results obtained can show a
direction for future researches in most needed areas.
The economic aspect was showed pretty deﬁcient, from
almost all analyzed points of view. So, this theme needs to be
deeply analyzed, in order to understand better the relationship
with the cities technological and social elements.
This research was realized considering just a period of
ﬁve years of study. A new protocol execution can be made,
with a bigger range, in order to analyze the evolution of

the researched aspects with the development of new scientiﬁc
studies about Smart Cities, making it possible to enhance the
knowledge about how people and sensors inﬂuence the Smart
Cities development, drawing an evolutionary proﬁle.
