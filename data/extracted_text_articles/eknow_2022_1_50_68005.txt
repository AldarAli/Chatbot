Abstract—Sustainability reporting has become common 
practice in organizations. A factor that is associated with the 
rise of sustainability reporting is greenwashing. In order to 
counter greenwashing practices, counter-accounting, referring 
to the use of information produced by actors outside a given 
organization or industry, aims to help verify statements made 
by organizations. Although counter-accounting already exists 
in the toolbox of the auditor, it is mainly applied in an ad-hoc 
manner and rarely continuous. In this study, a continuous 
monitoring system for counter-accounts is proposed to 
measure gender inequality. The application of the system is 
demonstrated using data from the hospitality sector regarding 
the fulfillment of different job titles by male and female 
executives. The presented results shed light on occupational 
gender segregation and provide a basis from which more 
continuous counter-accounting systems can be developed.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
Over the last few decades, social and environmental 
challenges 
have 
led 
to 
a 
push 
in organizations’ 
sustainability-related activities. The consensus regarding 
organizations’ shared responsibility to act in accordance 
with sustainable purposes for all stakeholders resulted in 
increased regulations and policies [29] and consequently, 
also growth in organizations’ sustainability reporting. For 
instance, in 2020, 92% of the S&P 500 companies published 
sustainability reports or disclosures as opposed to only 20% 
in 2011 [12]. Such reports are an important part of the 
conversation between organizations and their stakeholders.  
Simultaneously, parallel to the increased sustainability 
communication, 
skepticism 
has 
grown 
towards 
the 
authenticity of such reporting [20]. A large body of research 
addresses how some organizations use such sustainability 
disclosures as “greenwashing” in order to develop a more 
sustainable image and “window dress” corporate behavior 
[6] [22]. Hence, greater emphasis has been placed on 
ensuring the reliability of corporate sustainability reporting. 
The growing awareness on the reliability of such reports 
has, for instance, translated into the implementation of a 
standardized reporting framework with principles to define 
the content and the quality of reports, as proposed by the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) [5]. 
Despite this development, there still remains tension 
between corporate sustainability discourse and practice [6]. 
To address the critique regarding the credibility and 
reliability of sustainability reporting and restore confidence 
in such disclosures, auditors and assurance providers are 
introduced to verify the statements made by the reporting 
organizations [5].  However, given the questioned honesty 
of corporate disclosures, it becomes increasingly more 
worthwhile to explore other accounts of organizational 
activities such as “counter-accounts”, that are, contrary to 
voluntary published corporate reports, outside the control of 
the organization subject to the account [30]. Counter-
accounting through media such as the internet and social 
media contributes to verifying the organization’s legitimacy 
as it provides an alternative representation of an 
organization with the aim to rectify otherwise harmful or 
undesired practices [22] [30]. As previous research suggests, 
the use of counter-accounts should be further explored [22]. 
Specifically, to systematically include such counter-
accounts when challenging organizations’ operations, 
auditors are in need of an appropriate toolbox existing of a 
continuous monitoring system [19]. 
Whereas a continuous monitoring system would be 
useful to review organizations’ disclosures with regard to 
each and every one of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), this paper proposes a 
continuous monitoring system that addresses the fifth goal, 
gender equality. Specifically, an application of the system is 
provided for the hospitality industry, providing insights on 
occupational gender segregation by mapping the differences 
in the job titles fulfilled by male and female executives.  
The research question addressed in this study is the 
following: “How can a counter-account monitoring system 
for gender equality in the hospitality industry be designed?”.  
The remaining part of the paper is structured as follows. 
Section 2 provides a literature review on counter-accounts, 
occupational gender segregation, and available monitoring 
systems. In section 3, a description of the research method is 
presented. Section 4 gives insight into the data collection 
and analysis procedure for this application. Section 5

addresses the system architecture and its application. 
Finally, section 6 concludes the paper.  
 
II. 
LITERATURE  
In 2015, all United Nations Member States endorsed the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a roadmap for 
peace and prosperity for both people and the planet, with 17 
SDGs at its core [27]. After having defined these integrated, 
universal goals for sustainable development, the next step 
toward achieving them was to set specific targets for each 
goal, which were then in turn further broken down to 
measurable indicators. However, the incompleteness of the 
indicators, even after more than three years into the 
program, make the tracking of the progress towards meeting 
the SDGs challenging [23]. 
To assess whether the actions taken by countries and 
organizations to reach the SDGs are effective and in 
correspondence with their own reporting, scholars have 
argued 
the 
need 
to 
explore 
new 
Information, 
Communication, and Technology (ICT) in combination with 
multiple data sources to provide a common, continuous, and 
transparent representation of their efforts [23]. 
A. Counter-accounts 
As sustainability becomes an indispensable topic on 
corporate 
agendas, 
growing 
skepticism 
toward 
the 
authenticity of organizations’ sustainability reporting arises. 
This calls for effective monitoring and auditing in this 
environment in order to ensure trust and credibility of the 
information contained in such reports.  
With the acceleration of available, real-time information 
flows, the “archival audit”, where the auditor evaluates 
organizations’ yearly reports, is complemented if not 
replaced by a more real-time evaluation called “continuous 
auditing” [1]. Together with continuous monitoring, which 
is described as an ongoing management process to monitor 
internal controls, continuous auditing aims to provide the 
organization with a reasonable level of objective assurance 
[26].  
Aside from introducing a continuous monitoring 
mechanism to provide assurance on these reports and the 
organizations behind them, scholars have argued the need to 
explore other accounts, or “counter-accounts”, that are 
outside the control of the respective organization [30]. 
Counter-accounts are defined as accountings that challenge 
the representation established by the subject organization 
and contribute to critically assessing the organization’s 
corporate accountability or lack thereof [22].  
B. Occupational gender segregation 
Over the past decades, one of the most pressing social 
issues is inequality [2] . Even though inequality is shown in 
a broad range of forms, this paper focuses on gender 
equality, the fifth United Nations SDG. A recent study 
commissioned by the European Parliament’s Policy 
Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs 
[9], shows not only a difference in the share of employment 
between working-age men (79%) and working-age women 
(67%) but also that those women who are employed, are on 
average paid 14.1% less per hour compared to their male 
counterparts.  
The gender gap, with its key dimension being the gender 
pay gap, has a considerable impact on individuals’ 
socioeconomic status since gender equality contributes to 
both economic growth and sustainable development [9]. 
Evidently, aside from being listed as one of the United 
Nations SDGs, gender equality is also addressed by the 
European Commission in the 2020-2025 Gender Equality 
Strategy which strives for equal access to the economy 
across genders. In addition, the European Parliament in 
2021 called for a new gender pay gap action plan, 
addressing women’s accessibility to study and work in 
male-dominated sectors, more flexible work arrangements, 
and improved wages in female-dominated sectors.  
The presence of occupational gender segregation and its 
role in gender inequality has been widely addressed [14] 
[28], yet there remains little work on the monitoring and 
auditing process of occupational gender segregation. 
Therefore, this paper proposes a continuous monitoring 
system for counter-accounts that allows internal and 
external auditors to map both the current state of gender 
division across different jobs and their evolution over time.  
C. Continuous monitoring systems 
Monitoring 
statements 
and 
claims 
organization 
communicate on the one hand and monitoring counter-
accounts related to the statements on the other hand can 
provide valuable insights and prevent greenwashing and/or 
brownwashing [30]. Multiple studies have focused on 
analyzing such statements and their counter-accounts. For 
example, reference [22] analyses counter-accounts and 
responses by various groups to challenge Nestlé on its 
sustainability actions. Although data analysis is conducted 
during these studies, commonly the research is performed 
once, and is singular problem-oriented, meaning that a 
specific study focusses on one organization and/or one 
problem, and executes the analyses once for the purpose of 
the study [13]. At the end of the studies, there is no 
information system in place that continuously monitors 
organizations' claims and related external data to compare 
both. Systems that continuously monitor data and derive 
results are developed in other studies related to stock prices 
[24] and political analyses [4]. Also, studies are conducted 
that focus on extracting the right information from texts to 
be able to conduct the analyses [24]. Information systems 
that “enable independent parties to provide assurance on a 
subject matter, using a series of 
reports, issued 
simultaneously with or a short period of time after, the 
occurrence of events underlying the subject matter” are 
called Continuous Monitoring Systems. In general such 
24

systems are used automatically to monitor internal controls 
within business processes [24]. 
However, two changes in the current business 
environment force organizations to start continuous 
monitoring of external sources. The first change is that 
organizations are exposed to increased requirements in 
terms of regulations and business objectives that require 
managing and monitoring the entire value chain [10]. 
Second, organizations more and more have to deal with 
actors that provide counter-accounts through the monitoring 
of external sources that provide statements about the 
organization. The focus of this study is automated 
continuous monitoring of gender equality across job titles 
and the challenges that occur. To overcome these challenges 
a system architecture is proposed and its application is 
presented. Similar to previous research, we consider Named 
Entity Recognition (NER) as the basis of our system [11] 
[24]. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
According to the structures of Design Science, designed 
artifacts must be measured by predefined variables. With 
regards to the developed counter-accounting system for 
gender equality, multiple variables can be measured. 
Examples of such measurements are usefulness, use, mutual 
exclusivity, completeness, quality, and impact [15]. As 
design research is a continuous cycle of building and 
evaluation, it is practically impossible to measure all 
elements in one study [16]. In this study, the focus is on use, 
feasibility, and quality. The reason use, feasibility, and 
quality are chosen, is to determine if a counter-accounting 
system for gender equality is feasible.  The goal of this 
research is therefore to identify gender equality across job 
titles. In addition to the goal of the research, also the 
maturity of the research field is a factor in determining the 
appropriate research method and technique. With regards to 
job titles, this research field is mature. An appropriate focus 
of research in mature research fields is formal hypothesis 
testing or reevaluating existing methods [8]. Summarized, to 
accomplish our research goal, a research approach is needed 
in which first, job titles are identified and compared, and 
second, a system in which constant comparison (monitoring) 
of male and female appointments can be achieved.  
To accomplish the first goal, grounded theory is applied. 
In total, three cycles of coding were completed: 1) open 
coding, 2) axial coding and 3) selective coding [7]. The goal 
of open coding is to create the first level of abstraction from 
analyzed data. This is realized by analyzing website data 
about announcements of employees’ appointments to new 
jobs. In each appointment announcement the job title (e.g. 
ceo, cfo), job description, and words indicating gender (e.g. 
he/she/him/her) are collected. For those job appointments in 
which no gender could be recognized, additional sources 
such as LinkedIn and company websites have been 
investigated to identify the gender. Identifying more precise 
categories and relationships among the high-level categories 
is the goal of axial coding. In our study, axial coding 
focused on identifying standardized job titles. For example, 
the role of ‘Chief executive officer’ can be described as 
‘CEO’, ‘New company CEO’, or ‘Chief executive officer’ in 
different job appointments. Selective coding was conducted 
to select the core category, relate categories, and fill in 
categories that need further refinement [7]. In our research, 
this means that standardized job titles are appointed to 
departments and hierarchy levels, see Section 5 for an 
example. Then, to increase the generalizability, 81 rounds of 
automated coding through computational grounded theory 
have been applied  [21]. In Figure 1, the process is 
visualized with the first step resulting in the creation of the 
pattern library for job titles. This step involves the 
exploration of text using unsupervised methods and manual 
coding. Following a chronological order, step 2 will result 
in the development of the departments and hierarchy which 
are in essence a cumulus of categories for the job titles. 
These are also thoroughly analyzed through the means of 
inter-rater reliability analysis and later translated into text 
which can be understood by the computer. To achieve the 
second goal the design for the Continuous Monitoring of 
Counter-Accounts system has been developed and tested.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS 
Grounded theory states that the first selection of 
respondents and documentation is based on the phenomenon 
studied at a group of individuals, organizations, information 
technology, or community that best represents this 
phenomenon. With the goal of this study being the 
establishment of a counter-accounting system for gender 
equality, data regarding the job titles of male and female 
managers had to be collected. Both the data collection and 
25

analysis have been performed and supervised by the three 
authors involved. At the time of writing, the first researcher 
completes a Master-level degree, whereas the second 
researcher obtained a Doctoral degree, both having +5 years 
of experience in Hospitality. The third researcher similarly 
obtained a Doctoral degree and has 20+ years of experience 
in Accountancy.  
For the model testing, one real-life data set has been 
collected from Hospitality.net, between the 1st of June 2021 
and the 15th of December 2021. The method of data 
collection involves the entire population of job postings of 
management employees, during the period mentioned 
previously. This population, in the first phase of our data 
collection, has been divided into different strata depending 
on job title, level, company, and geographical location. For 
every stratum, several job postings have been scraped and 
analyzed, totaling 1.000 job titles by open coding. Starting 
from the 7th of June, the sampling method has been changed. 
The following phase involved letting the system scrape data 
and showing the results by means of an automated generated 
email. The system would scrape newly identified job titles 
and mention the standardized version. The role of the 
researchers was to check the accuracy of the system and to 
standardize new job titles if they were not yet in the system.   
V. 
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND APPLICATION  
The architecture to ground the counter-accounting system 
for gender equality as proposed in this study is visualized in 
Figure 1. The architecture includes three different sections 
(Collection, Cleaning, and Analysis and Visualization), that 
are each supported by a different tool (Selenium, Spacy, and 
ScatterText). The application of each section is discussed.  
A. Collection of counter-account data 
First, counter-account data, that can counter the 
statements made by the organization concerning gender 
equality, need to be identified and collected. For this 
application, to collect this data, external sources are needed 
that give insight into the number of males and females 
appointed to specific job titles. Within the hospitality 
industry, multiple sources can be used for this, for example, 
Hospitality.net and LinkedIn. Even though a variety of tools 
can be used to collect this data, for this application, 
Selenium, a tool for automated web scraping is employed to 
extract useful information from the identified sources.   
B. Cleaning of counter-account data  
The second section of the model includes the cleaning of 
the collected counter-account data. For the job title data, a 
wide variety of linguistic variations need to be reduced to a 
manageable amount of job titles. Therefore, by making use 
of pattern lists, also called ‘business rules’ that exist of a set 
of reoccurring words with a predefined annotation, job titles 
are standardized, appointed to departments, and appointed to 
levels. To automate this process, a tool called Spacy is used 
[11].  
1) Standardize the job titles: When information on job 
title data is collected at a large scale, it becomes apparent 
that organizations give different titles to the same job. For 
example, when a person is a ‘Chief executive officer’ this 
can be described as ‘CEO’, ‘New company CEO’, or ‘Chief 
executive officer’. To allow for comparison, these small 
linguistic variations need to be standardized. Specifically, as 
for the previous examples, these job titles would be 
standardized to 'Chief Executive Officer'. In total, the NER 
system now incorporated 210 standardized job titles [18]. 
This NER needs to be updated regularly to adjust for both 
new job titles such as ‘vice president sustainability’, and for 
new title variations of existing jobs such as the examples 
mentioned above. A process to realize these updates has 
been put into place [18]. 
 
2) Appointment to departments: In addition to the job 
titles, also the department to which the job is appointed 
needs to be taken into account. Similarly, a standardized 
appointment of job titles per department needs to be 
developed. For example, 'Chief Executive Officer' is part of 
the administrative department, ‘Finance Director’ is part of 
the finance department, and ‘Director of Human Resource’ is 
part of the human resource department. Having determined 
the allocation of job titles per department, the axial coding 
has been automatized through the creation of pattern 
libraries. Finally, the system now includes a total of 17 
departments [18].  
 
3) Appointment to levels: Lastly, aside from department 
allocation, the job titles can also be categorized based on the 
hierarchical level to allow for multi-level analysis. The 
creation of the pattern library hierarchy resulted in three 
base hierarchy levels. As an organization can be divided 
into head office (HQ), regional office (RO), and property 
based (PB) job levels. Within the HQ level, 22 patterns have 
been developed. In RO there are 24 patterns and for PB 
there are 32 patterns.  
The hierarchy starts with HQ and ends with PB. As 
every organization is different, it was necessary to create 
more detailed levels to place job titles with a similar name 
in the same hierarchical level. The ‘Chief Financial Officer’, 
‘Chief Human Resource Officer’, and ‘Chief Sustainability 
Officer’ all come on the same level: HQ1. Followed with 
HQ2 the ‘President’ and will go to HQ7. This example 
explains the details of the standardized hierarchical levels of 
the HQ, there are also detailed levels for the RO: RO1 being 
the ‘Group Directors’, followed by the ‘Area/Regional 
Executive Vice Presidents’. This goes on till RO8. And PB: 
PB1: ‘General Manager’, followed by the ‘Assistant 
General Manager’ on PB2, going on to the managerial level 
PB8 [18].

C. Analysis and Visualization 
Finally, after having the data collected, standardized job 
titles, and appointed to departments and levels, the final step 
involves the comparative analysis of job titles fulfilled by 
males and females. To visually present the counter-account 
data, the system makes use of ScatterText [17]. This 
interactive scatter plot allows distinguishing between job 
titles fulfilled by male and female executives. Figure 2 
presents a visualization of the model outcome based on job 
titles; however, this can also be performed based on 
departmental or hierarchical levels.  The outcome of the 
counter-account analysis can be of value to auditors and 
assurance providers in their assessment of the reporting 
organizations’ 
credibility 
and 
reliability. 
For 
this 
application, this refers to the verification of statements made 
about gender equality efforts in the hospitality industry.   
Results from the counter-account monitoring of gender 
equality in the hospitality workforce confirm some of the 
stereotyped occupational gender segregation. For example, 
in line with arguments in reference [14] regarding women’s 
presence in occupations characterized by high warmth and 
low competence and evidence showing women tend to be 
excluded from fields like science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics [9], results in Figure 2 show job titles like 
‘Head of Human Resources’, ‘Spa Director’, and ‘Sales and 
Marketing Manager’ to be more frequently fulfilled by 
females, whereas job titles like ‘Chef de Cuisine’, ‘Senior 
Vice President of Operations’, ‘Director of Food and 
Beverage’, 
‘Executive 
Vice 
President’, 
and 
‘Chief 
Development Officer’ are substantially more often fulfilled 
by males.  
Even though there are clear signs of a gender division in 
the hospitality workforce, there are also some remarkable 
evolutions regarding female presence in higher executive 
level jobs. Women are traditionally strongly present in the 
hospitality industry, a service industry, yet struggled to 
fulfill higher-level positions. Figure 2, presenting the current 
gender division of the hospitality workforce, shows how 
positions 
like 
‘General 
Manager’, 
‘Director’, 
and 
‘President’ are roughly equally fulfilled by males and 
females.  
Lastly, relatively new positions such as ‘Vice President 
of Sustainability’ and ‘Chief Sustainability Officer’ do not 
appear to be appointed to any gender specifically. Mapping 
the gender division on a continued basis allows for tracking 
changes 
in 
occupational 
gender 
segregation 
within 
organizations or industries.  
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
This research aims to find an answer to the following 
research question: “How can a counter-account monitoring 
system for gender equality in the hospitality industry be 
designed?”. To answer this question, a system has been 
designed and tested. The research has several limitations. 
Limitations on the subject matter of hospitality and 
limitations on the actual counter-account system. First, the 
results are based on 1.000 new functions that became 
available to the public during a relatively short time frame 
(June-December, 2021). Although 1.000 new functions can 
be enough, it is possible that specific functions have not 
become available during this period. Future research should 
focus on collecting more and different function names to 
improve the current system, which is an integrated part of the 
application. Besides this, the sample contained only 
functions that have been posted on Hospitality.net. 
Therefore, results might not be fully representative of the 
sector and future research should attempt to extend sources

and generalize the results. Additionally, future research 
could focus on additional sectors to see expand the results.
