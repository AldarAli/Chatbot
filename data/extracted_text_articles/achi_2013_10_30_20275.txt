Abstract—Interaction and interface design for the young and 
the elderly has become an important research topic. The 
purpose of the research described here is to characterize motor 
performance in virtual environments across the lifespan. 
Participants between the ages of 7 and 90 years simultaneously 
reached to pick up two objects with their right and left hands 
in a desktop virtual environment.  On random trials, objects 
were unexpectedly moved to new locations.  Results indicated 
that older adults used different movement strategies in the 
virtual environment when compared to results from natural 
environment experiments.  Further, children and older adults 
responded to perturbation conditions with different movement 
time and hand coupling strategies than young and middle-aged 
adults.  These results suggest that age and task-specific design 
is necessary to ensure general access and optimal performance 
in virtual environments.

 INTRODUCTION  
A. HCI and Age 
With the expansion of the role of computers in schools, 
the workplace, and homes, the population of users who 
make regular use of computing technology has grown 
exponentially.  Unfortunately, Human-Computer Interaction 
(HCI) research has not reflected this demographic reality.  
Results of the 2010 US Census show that 17.5% of the US 
population is between the ages of 5 and 18 and a further 
40% of the population is above the age of 45 [1].  It has also 
been reported that Europe is experiencing an aging 
population, with projections of 35% of the population being 
above the age of 65 by 2025 [2]. Still most HCI research is 
focused on younger people, often university or college 
students [3]. Rather than representing the true population of 
computer users, most experimental HCI research is biased 
heavily towards the cognitive and motor abilities of young 
adults. Where age-specific research has been conducted, the 
majority relates to the design of standard computer interface 
systems for various age groups.  In particular, research has 
focused on ways to improve cognitive performance through 
specific training or tutorial methods [e.g. 4, 5], or on the 
age-appropriate design of input devices [e.g. 6, 7, 8].   
While a modest corpus of knowledge is available for the 
design of standard computer interface systems for a variety 
of age groups, much less is known about how age influences 
performance within immersive three-dimensional virtual 
environments (VEs) [9, 10, 11].  Immersive VEs are 
becoming more prominent as the costs of the relevant 
tracking and display technologies decrease.  VEs are 
commonly 
used 
in 
design 
and 
prototyping, 
data 
visualization, 
medical 
training, 
architecture, 
and 
entertainment.  Further, recent research has focused on the 
utility of VEs for rehabilitation of motor impairments such 
as stroke in the elderly and attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), developmental coordination disorder and 
cerebral palsy in the young [12, 13].  However, because 
there is a paucity of information on how healthy children 
and older adults interact in VEs, it is likely that the success 
of these systems will struggle. Specifically, it is nearly 
impossible to extrapolate design characteristics from healthy 
young adults to special-needs children and older adults.  
Results of the few studies conducted on performance across 
age-groups within virtual environments indicate relevant 
disparities in reactions to environmental immersion, usage 
of various input devices, size estimation ability, and 
navigational skills [9, 10, 11].  According to Allen et al. [9], 
“these results highlight the importance of considering age 
differences when designing for the population at large.” 
The purpose of the research described here is to 
characterize motor performance in virtual environments 
across the lifespan. To do this we asked participants ranging 
in age from 7 to 90 years to perform a foundational skill 
(bimanual reach to grasp) within a table-top virtual 
environment.  In the following sections, we describe the 
importance of the skill we chose to study. 
 
B. Bimanual Reach to Grasp Skills 
The performance of many everyday activities requires the 
completion of asymmetric but coordinated movements with 
our two hands. For example, touch typing, tying our 
shoelaces, and even reaching for a mug with one hand and a 
coffee pot with the other require the performance of two 
separate but coordinated movements. Many asymmetric 
bimanual tasks such as the ones described above can be 
performed quite effortlessly in natural environments.  This

seamless control is possible because we use feedforward 
sensory information (vision and proprioception) to pre-plan 
our movements and feedback sensory information for on-
line corrections during movement execution. 
Recently, bimanual tasks have been targeted as 
important skills to (re)train in rehabilitation protocols 
employing natural environments and virtual reality [14]. In 
rehabilitation training after stroke, these types of tasks are 
important for functional recovery because they require the 
areas of the brain most commonly afflicted by stroke to 
work 
with areas 
usually 
left 
undamaged, 
thereby 
maximizing the potential for positive neuroplastic changes 
[15]. 
While the study of bimanual movements has received 
some attention in natural environments, very little is known 
regarding the performance of these types of movements in 
virtual environments [16]. Further, no studies have looked at 
how the control of bimanual skills changes as a result of age 
in VEs.  In order to successfully implement rehabilitation 
and training protocols that make use of these types of tasks 
it is imperative that we first obtain a baseline understanding 
of how neurologically “normal” people across the lifespan 
perform bimanual skills in VEs and how they use sensory 
information for the performance of these skills. 
In natural environments, results from bimanual movement 
studies have indicated that when the two limbs are used to 
accomplish both symmetric and asymmetric task goals, 
coupling between the limbs for certain parameters occurs in 
the temporal domain [17, 18]. In particular, movement 
onset, duration, and end times tend to be similar for the two 
hands when subjects aim toward or reach to grasp targets of 
different sizes or at different locations [17, 18].  However, 
timing differences between the hands have been shown, and 
results indicate that these differences are associated with 
insufficient visual feedback for movement control [19].   In 
the current study we investigated whether the same patterns 
of results are seen in virtual environments and whether these 
patterns change with age.  We employed a target 
perturbation to specifically investigate how sensory (visual) 
information is used on-line by participants of various ages 
to modify their movements.  These paradigms are discussed 
in more detail in the following section. 
 
C. Unpredictable Environments: Perturbation Paradigms 
An experimental paradigm that has been successfully 
used to investigate the role of on-line visual information for 
the performance of goal directed tasks uses target 
perturbation to study adjustments to ongoing movements. 
The use of this type of paradigm allows us to discern how 
long it takes the nervous system to adapt to an unexpected 
visual change as well as the efficiency of the adaptation. 
In a target perturbation paradigm, the participant is 
unexpectedly presented with the requirement to alter their 
original movement plan either prior to or after movement 
onset. An example of a typical perturbation paradigm is as 
follows. A visual stimulus is presented to the participant 
prior to movement initiation and the participant generates a 
movement plan appropriate to the acquisition of the target at 
this initial location. Shortly prior to or after movement onset 
the stimulus is suddenly replaced by a second stimulus 
presented at an alternative location. The participant is thus 
required to reorganize their movement to successfully grasp 
the target at its new position. Results of studies using 
perturbation paradigms in both natural [20] and virtual 
environments [16] have indicated increased movement 
times to displaced targets and double velocity peaks in 
kinematic recordings. 
Studying the performance of bimanual perturbation tasks 
in a VE can provide us with important information about 
how participants make use of visual information during the 
execution of a skill.  This is particularly important given that 
the use of sensory information changes across the lifespan 
[21,22] and all the visual information presented to users of 
VEs must be synthetically created.  By comparing results in 
the VE to studies performed in the “real” world we can 
determine whether performance is similar within these two 
environments.   
   
II. 
METHOD 
A. Participants 
Fifty-one participants were divided into four age 
categories: Children (7-12 years, n=13), Young adults (18-
30 years, n=12), Middle age adults (40-50 years, n=12) and 
Older adults (60+ years, n=12). Due to problems with data 
collection final data analysis was conducted on 12 
participants in the “Children” group and 11 participants in 
the “Older adult” group. Decades of motor control research 
has indicated that a sample size of 10-12 participants 
provides sufficient statistical power in this type of reach to 
grasp study. All participants were self-reported right-
handers and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. All 
participants provided informed consent before taking part in 
the experiment. The protocol was approved by the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison Social and Behavioral 
Science Institutional Review Board. 
 
B. Experimental Apparatus 
This experiment was conducted in the Wisconsin Virtual 
Environment (WiscVE) at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison. In this environment, subjects see three-
dimensional graphical representations of target objects but 
interact with physical objects. As shown in Fig. 1, graphic 
images of two target cubes were displayed on a downward 
facing computer monitor. A half-silvered mirror was placed 
parallel to the computer screen, midway between the screen 
and the table surface. The graphic image of the cubes was 
reflected in the mirror and appeared to the participant to be 
located in the workspace on the table surface. Three light

emitting diodes (LEDs) were positioned on the top surface 
of two wooden target cubes (38 mm). A VisualEyez 3000 
motion capture system (Phoenix Technologies, Inc., 
Burnaby) tracked the three-dimensional position of the 
LEDs on the physical target cubes. This data was used with 
an 8–10 ms lag (which was not discernible to subjects), to 
generate the superimposed graphical representations of the 
cubes. A shield was placed below the mirror to prevent 
subjects from seeing the real environment or their hands as 
they performed the reach-to-grasp task. 
Participants wore CrystalEYES™ goggles to obtain a 
stereoscopic view of the graphic images being projected 
onto the mirror. Three LEDs were fixed to the goggles and 
were used to provide the subject with a head-coupled view 
of the virtual environment on the work surface. Thus, when 
the subject moved his/her head, the displayed scene was 
adjusted appropriately for the magnitude and direction of 
head movement. LEDs were also positioned on the subject’s 
right and left thumbs, index fingers and wrists. Data from all 
LEDs was collected at a sampling rate of 120 Hz and was 
stored for data analysis purposes. 
 
C. Design and Procedure 
Each trial began with the illumination of two blue 
circular start positions (radius 5 mm) located 12.5 cm to the 
left and right of the participants’ midline. The participants 
moved their hands from the periphery of the workspace to 
place their index fingers and thumbs over the start positions, 
which were haptically indicated by small metal hex nuts. 
When the participants’ hands were correctly positioned, the 
start positions turned yellow. Once both of the participants’ 
hands remained stationary at the start positions for 1 s, the 
two graphic target cubes appeared at a location 20 cm from 
the start position. The task was to reach forward with the 
right and left hands to grasp and lift the two target cubes. 
Grasps were made with a precision grip and participants 
were asked to move at a comfortable pace once the target 
cubes appeared.   
Participants experienced trials in four experimental 
conditions.  In the control condition both targets remained at 
their initial location throughout the trial (left target no 
jump/right target no jump; NN).  In the three perturbation 
conditions one or both targets were displaced 9 cm toward 
the participant at movement onset (defined as a 
displacement of 5 mm of the thumb LED).  The perturbation 
conditions consisted of: 1) left target jump/right target no 
jump (JN), 2) left target no jump/right target jump (NJ), 3) 
left target jump, right target jump (JJ). 
Participants performed a total of 100 trials.  The first 10 
trials were always control trials (NN).  This allowed 
participants to become comfortable with the task and also 
gave us the opportunity to analyze a set of “control” trials 
where participants had no expectation of a perturbation.  
The remaining 60 control and 30 perturbation trials, 10 in 
each condition, were presented in a random order. 
 
D. Data Analysis 
Position data from the block LED as well as LEDs on 
the wrists of both hands were analyzed for specific temporal 
kinematic measures. Start of movement was defined as the 
point where wrist velocity increased above a threshold of 5 
mm/s and continued increasing to a peak.  End of movement 
was defined as the point where block lift velocity increased 
above 5 mm/s and continued increasing to a peak.  Based on 
these two temporal measures we calculated Movement Time 
(MT) for both hands.  We also quantified temporal coupling 
of the two hands by determining whether the hands started 
and ended movement at similar times.  To do this we 
calculated the Absolute Start Offset (ASO: Start Left Hand 
– Start Right Hand) and Absolute End Offset (AEO: End 
Left Hand – End Right Hand).  
Data were statistically analyzed in two ways.  First, to 
quantify control performance in the first 10 trials, we 
conducted a 4 Group (Children, Young Adult, Middle 
Adult, Older Adult) X 2 Hand (left, right) repeated measures 
ANOVA on MT.  To quantify bimanual coupling during the 
control trials a 4 Group (Children, Young Adult, Middle 
Adult, Older Adult) repeated measures ANOVA was 
performed on ASO and AEO.  To quantify performance 
during the perturbation trials we conducted separate 4 
Group (Children, Young Adult, Middle Adult, Older Adult) 
X 4 Condition (JJ, NJ, JN, NN) repeated measures 
ANOVAs for each hand and dependent measure.  Post-Hoc 
analysis on significant main effects was done using the 
Fisher LSD method.   When significant interactions 
occurred, these were further explored using simple main 
effects with Condition as the factor.  An a priori alpha level 
was set at p < 0.05.

RESULTS 
A. Initial Performance: Control Trials 
The control trials allow us to determine how bimanual 
performance changes as a function of age within virtual 
environments and whether patterns of performance in VEs 
replicate those seen in natural environments.   
A main effect of Group was found for movement time 
(F3,43 = 7.053, p=0.001).  Results indicated that the fastest 
movement times were found in the young and middle aged 
adults.  Children were significantly slower than the young 
and middle aged adults, whereas older adults were only 
significantly slower than the young adults (Fig. 2). 
When looking at coupling between the left and right 
hands, main effects of Group were found for ASO (F3,43 = 
14.03, p<0.001) and AEO (F3,43 = 4.74, p=0.006).  The post-
hoc LSD indicated that children had significantly larger 
offsets at both the start (Fig. 3A) and end (Fig. 3B) of 
movement than any of the other age groups. 
B. Perturbation Performance 
The perturbation trials allowed us to investigate whether 
differences in the use of on-line visual feedback occur across 
age groups and for different perturbation conditions.   
An interaction between Condition and Group (F9,129 = 
2.934, p=0.003) was found for MT of the right hand.

have similar MTs to the older adults in the NJ condition. The 
young and middle adults had similar MTs across all 
conditions.  Finally, the older adults were significantly 
slower than the young adults in the NN and NJ conditions 
only.   
For MT of the left hand, main effects of group (F3,43 = 
6.04, p=0.002) and condition (F3,129 =10.6, p<0.001) were 
found.  The group main effect indicated that the children 
were significantly slower than the young and middle adults.  
No other significant differences were found (Fig. 5A).  For 
the main effect of condition, results indicated that MTs for 
the left hand were significantly faster in the NN and JJ 
conditions than in the JN and NJ conditions (Fig. 5B). 
When looking at coupling between the two hands during 
perturbation trials, a main effect of group (F3,43 = 15.9, 
p<0.001) indicated that children had significantly larger 
offsets at movement initiation than any other age group (Fig. 
6).  
For the end of movement, a Group X Condition 
interaction (F9,129 = 2.232, p=0.024) indicated that children 
had significantly larger offsets than all other groups in the 
NN condition (Fig. 7).  The older adults had longer offsets 
than the young adults in the NJ condition.  All groups had 
statistically similar offsets in the JN and JJ conditions.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
A. Performance of Bimanual Movements in VEs across the 
lifespan: Control and Perturbation Conditions 
Each participant began the experiment by performing a 
block of simple bimanual trials without perturbation.  These 
trials allowed us to determine whether age-specific patterns 
of bimanual performance in VEs are similar to the patterns 
seen in the natural environment.  When considering overall 
MT, research in natural environments has indicated that 
children and the elderly typically complete both simple and 
complex tasks more slowly than young adults [23, 24]. A 
similar pattern of results was found in the current study, 
indicating some similarities between VEs and natural 
environments. With respect to bimanual coupling in natural 
environments, prior studies have indicated that both young 
children and older adults exhibit greater offsets at 
movement initiation and movement completion than young 
adults [24, 25]. These results were replicated for the 
children; however, the older adults used similar movement 
offset patterns as the young and middle adults. This 
difference in movement coupling for the elderly subjects 
suggests that they use different control strategies in natural 
compared to virtual environments. Timing differences 
between the hands in bimanual tasks have been associated 
with the requirement to shift visual attention between the 
targets to obtain sufficient feedback [19]. In older adults, 
slowing of visual sensory processing due to aging should 
result in even greater timing differences between the hands 
[22].  The smaller offsets seen in the current study suggests 
that the elderly subjects may have been relying on a 
predominantly feedforward strategy to complete the task 
instead of the typical feedback-based strategy that is seen in 
the natural environment.  In a previous study investigating 
age differences on a simple reach-to-grasp task in a VE, we 
also found that older adults relied more heavily on a 
feedforward-based strategy [26].  The current findings add 
support to the notion that older adults may not rely on

Figure 7.  Main effect of Group on AEO 
similar movement planning and execution strategies when 
performing tasks in VEs.   
The perturbation conditions allowed us to investigate 
age differences in the visual control of movement in VEs. 
Overall, MT and offset results indicated similar movement 
performance between the ages of 18 and 50 years.  These 
results suggest that design principles extracted from studies 
done on young adults may be applicable to middle-aged 
adults as well.  In contrast, children and older adults 
exhibited distinct performance differences as a function of 
perturbation condition. While their performance was similar 
to the young and middle age groups for certain parameters 
and on certain conditions, the youngest and oldest age 
groups were slower and their movements were less coupled 
in other conditions.  Overall, these results suggest that task 
conditions and age are critical factors when considering the 
design and functionality of VEs.   Children and older adults 
do not perform or make use of sensory information in a 
similar fashion to young and middle-aged adults.  Further, 
results are clearly task specific.  This suggests that it is 
dangerous for designers to extrapolate performance in one 
task to other tasks.  Instead, our results suggest that age-
related performance must be investigated on a task by task 
basis for the generation of design principles. 
B. Implications for the Design of Training and 
Rehabilitation VEs 
Virtual environments have recently been touted as 
promising tools for training and rehabilitation [12, 13, 14].  
However, the capacity for these environments to provide 
optimal benefits hinges on the learner’s ability to transfer 
gains made in the VE to improvements in performance in 
the real world.  It has long been known in the human motor 
learning literature that successful transfer occurs when 
similarities in movement strategies between the practice and 
performance environment are greatest [27].  In the current 
study we found that children, young, and middle-aged adults 
used similar bimanual strategies in the control condition to 
those reported for natural environments.  In contrast the 
strategies used by the older adults in the VE were different

than those reported in natural environments.  It is important 
to note that visual feedback in this study was impoverished 
and relatively crude (i.e. no hand representation, simple 
table surface and object representation, low luminance 
contrast levels). These results suggest that when designing 
environments for older adults, it may be necessary to design 
tasks and environmental feedback conditions that better 
mimic the richness of the visual feedback conditions 
available in the real world.  We are planning future studies 
to test this hypothesis.
