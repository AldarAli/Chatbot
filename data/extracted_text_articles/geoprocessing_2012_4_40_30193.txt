Abstract— Pollution from urban transport has a big impact on 
community health. Environmental organizations in different 
countries of the world have installed sensor devices of air 
pollutants in different parts of their cities for informing the air 
pollution and its necessary and timely warnings and these 
devices record pollutants data in 24 hours of everyday. Today, 
these data are presented on large display boards installed in 
the important places of big cities. In this research, the results 
of pollutant data are presented visually on Tabriz map by GIS 
that it is better than statistical presentation. 
Keywords- Air Pollutants; Air Particles; Air Quality Index; 
GIS.

 INTRODUCTION 
Transportation is one of the vital components in modern 
human daily life. However, it has both productive effects on 
human developments and detrimental effects on public 
health. The number of motor vehicles is estimated to be over 
800 million worldwide and is increasing almost everywhere 
at higher rates than human population, and road traffic may 
be growing even more rapidly.   The number of private cars 
worldwide rose to 500 million in 1990 from 50 million in 
1950. Road traffic is related to undesirable health effects 
caused by air pollution, noise and accidents. This wide range 
of negative health effects includes increased mortality, 
cardiovascular, respiratory and stress-related diseases, cancer 
and physically injuries. The negative effects are felt not only 
by transport users but also by the whole population 
especially in the vulnerable group of children and elderly 
people, pedestrians and cyclists. The effect of air pollution 
on public health depends on factors such as: the chemical 
composition of a particular pollutant, the level of 
concentration; the presence of other pollutants; the existing 
health of individuals; and periods of exposure [3].  
Environmental organizations in different countries of the 
world installed sensor devices of air pollutants in different 
parts of their cities for informing the air pollution and its 
necessary and timely warnings and these devices record 
pollutants data in 24 hours of day. In our country, Iran, the 
Environmental Organization has installed 13 pollutant 
stations in Tehran and a few stations in other big cities. In 
Tabriz city 5 stations have been installed and we used all of 
them. More stations have best results and we can do best and 
complete analyses by GIS and then authorities can take 
decisions more effectively. Unfortunately due to the low 
monitoring stations in Tabriz, it is not possible we can 
perform GIS famous analyses such as Geostatistical analysis. 
Therefore, another GIS tools are used for visual presentation 
the results instead of statistical presentation. In this paper, a 
program has been developed in ARCObjectsTM [2] that it 
first calculates AQI values for whole of pollutant data and 
selects the maximum of them, then merges these values 
properly to attribute information of pollutant monitoring 
stations. Finally, based on these attribute information, the 
pollution status on the relevant maps or satellite images is 
represented as daily, monthly and yearly with various tools.

AIR POLLUTANTS AND THEIR ROLE IN HUMAN 
HEALTH 
The main air pollutants are ozone, particles, CO, 
Nitrogen oxides, Sulfur dioxide and lead. In Table I, one can 
see these pollutants and their effects on society health [4].

STUDY AREA 
Tabriz is located in the north-west of Iran and its 
population is about 1.5 millions. Tabriz is the fourth most 
populous city in Iran after Tehran, Mashhad, and Esfahan, 
and is also a major Iranian heavy industrial and 
manufacturing center. Some of these industries include 
automobile, machine tools, oil and petrochemical and cement 
production. Therefore, we used pollution data of it that were 
observed from 5 ground stations in 2011. These stations 
geographically 
located 
in 
Rahahan, 
Rastekouche, 
Baghshomal, Abrasan, and Hakimnezami zones (Fig. 1). 
Ground pollution monitoring stations collect daily amounts 
of pollutants in different parts of the city. In this work, all of 
pollutant data for determining the emergency situation are 
used. For example in Table II there is a sample data of air 
pollutants for one of pollutant stations during 5 hours a day. 
Based on pollution data, the Air Quality Index is calculated 
from Equation I and then emergency situation is warned.

AIR QUALITY INDEX 
Air quality indices (AQI) are numbers used by 
government agencies to characterize the quality of the air at a 
given location. As the AQI increases, an increasingly large 
percentage of the population is likely to experience 
increasingly severe adverse health effects [1]. 
To compute the AQI everyone requires an air pollutant 
concentration from a monitor or model. The function used to 
convert from air pollutant concentration to AQI varies by 
pollutant, and is different in different countries. Air quality 
index values are divided into ranges, and each range is 
assigned a descriptor and a color code. Standardized public 
health advisories are associated with each AQI range. An 
agency might also encourage members of the public to take 
public transportation or work from home when AQI levels 
are high [1]. 
 
Figure 1.  The pollutant stations of Tabriz city 
The air quality index is a piecewise linear function of the 
pollutant concentration. At the boundary between AQI 
categories, there is a discontinuous jump of one AQI unit. To 
convert from concentration to AQI the equation I is used [1]:

of

Figure 2.   Maximum of AQI for Baghshomal monitoring station in March 
2011. 
In Table IV, for example, the calculated AQI and their 
maximum for concentrations related to Table II are 
presented. The Maximum of AQI for Baghshomal 
monitoring station in March 2011 is shown in Fig. 2. It is 
determined from Fig. 2 there are about 5 days in March that 
air pollution is very much and the emergency status is 
Hazardous. 
V. 
IMPLEMENTATION 
In this paper, a program has been developed in 
ARCObjectsTM [2] that it first calculates AQI values for 
whole of pollutant data and selects the maximum of them 
then merges these values properly to attribute information of 
pollutant monitoring stations. Finally, based on these 
attribute information, the pollution status on the relevant 
maps or satellite images is represented as daily, monthly and 
yearly with various statistical tools. For example Fig. 4 and 
Fig. 6 represent the maximum AQI of pollutants in March 
and July 2011 with variable slice sizes and Fig. 5 and Fig. 7 
represent the same maximum AQI with identical slice sizes. 
In these figures the sequence of days is based on Fig. 3.

 It is seen from Fig. 9 that Tabriz city has air pollution in 
majority months of the year. 
By more developing of the written program and 
customizing it, some radio buttons and check boxes can  
develop for best interface and GUI that every user can select 
daily, monthly or yearly and so select other options to best 
visualization and interpretation of results. This program can 
run on the Web for online visualization the results. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
By using GIS with various representations everyone can 
utilize visual, not only statistical, analyses based on different 
data especially pollution data. If the AQI is represented with 
identical slices, everyone can rapidly conclude that in which 
interval of month, 1st week or 2nd week and so on, the air 
pollution has maximum value and if the AQI is represented 
with variable slices, everyone rapidly conclude that what 
days have the maximum pollution. 
Based on the data, it is obvious that PM10 is the major air 
pollutant in Tabriz city and other pollutants have a minor 
role in the pollution of its air. 
If the number of pollutant monitoring stations in our city 
increase and the resulted data are available in the hands of 
analysts in every time and everywhere, they can represent the 
various results of these data in the different places of the 
cities for public, and also they can use GIS complex analyses 
such as Geostatistical Analysis for better analyzing the 
results and estimating the quantity of pollution in other 
places of city. It is expected that by this article and articles 
like it, such matters to be provided in the near future.
