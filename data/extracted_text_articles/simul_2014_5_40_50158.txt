Abstract—The present study investigates the respective roles of 
lateral acceleration, and lateral, roll and yaw motions for self-
motion perception and cornering behavior on a dynamic 
driving simulator. A recent study advises the use of motion 
gains (in the range 0.4 to 0.75) on these three components in 
order to improve self-motion perception. However, the role of 
each component in self-motion perception has not been 
individually addressed and the same motion gain is proposed 
for all components, independently of the level of acceleration. 
The aim of the present study is to extend this previous result 
by systematically reassessing the motion gains for the three 
lateral motion components for several levels of acceleration. A 
slalom task was chosen (with the level of lateral acceleration 
modified by changing the distance between posts) so that 
cornering behavior and self-motion perception could be 
assessed for various settings of the three parameters. The main 
results suggest that 1/ lateral motion gain should be decreased 
when lateral acceleration is increased; 2/ roll motion gain 
should be set to 1 to improve and facilitate driving perception 
and performance and 3/ the yaw component has a more 
controversial role but it seems to facilitate driving control 
without influencing motion perception. In conclusion, this 
study shows that the three motion components generally used 
to simulate lateral acceleration should be set individually and 
that use of the same motion gain for all three is not the best 
solution for improving the realism of the simulator. Therefore, 
it is proposed that each parameter be dynamically set based on 
the driving conditions.  
 Keywords-Lateral acceleration; motion gains; driving 
performance; tilt-coordination. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
On dynamic driving simulators, motion perception is 
produced by stimulating the vestibular and somatosensory 
systems in addition to the visual system [1]. However, the 
intricacy of the multisensory stimulations undergone when 
driving a car makes the optimization of motion based 
simulators quite complex. For instance, it has already been 
shown that the motion on a driving simulator is 
overestimated when simulated at 1-to-1 rate [2]–[4]. In order 
to avoid this overestimation, some technical tricks are used, 
like the scale factor, called gain, and/or a combination of tilt 
and translation, called tilt-coordination [3]. However, both 
the gain and tilt-coordination needed to reproduce a positive 
or negative acceleration (e.g., take-off or braking) are highly 
dependent on the level of the simulated acceleration [4][5].  
For turning manoeuvers, the control of the simulator 
appears to be more complex than for longitudinal 
manoeuvers because, in addition to lateral acceleration, there 
are also the yaw and the roll motions of the car that have to 
be simulated. However, the main sensory information on 
which the driver depends in making the manoeuvers is lateral 
acceleration. Indeed, the driver controls the speed and the 
trajectory of the car to keep this acceleration in a comfortable 
range and to ensure a safety margin [6][7]. In most dynamic 
driving simulators, the simulation of lateral acceleration is 
produced by using the tilt-coordination technique (lateral 
translation and lateral tilt). However, during cornering, the 
car is subject not only to a lateral linear acceleration, but also 
to rotational motions, such as yaw and roll. These motion 
components are also taken into account for driving 
simulation and they are highly dependent on the steering 
behavior of the car during cornering. Therefore, Berthoz et 
al. (2013) [8] proposed that motion gains (for lateral and 
rotational acceleration) should be within the range 0.4-0.75. 
One limitation of this study is that the gain for linear 
translations, roll and yaw and their interactions were not 
systematically varied for different levels of acceleration. 
To go further this limitation, the present study, conducted 
on PSA’s (Peugeot Society Automobile) dynamic driving 
simulator 
SHERPA² 
[9], 
is 
focused 
on 
cornering 
manoeuvers. It aims at systematically reassessing the motion 
gains for the three lateral motion components (lateral, yaw 
and roll motions) for several levels of lateral acceleration. In 
order to evaluate the individual effects of the three 
parameters on driving behavior, a slalom driving task was 
selected. Through subjective and objective analyses, we tried 
to identify and quantify the major sources of motion 
perception and driving performance in cornering, and to 
identify the best set of parameters for each level of

acceleration to simulate. More precisely, the aim is to define 
a mapping of motion gain set-ups to improve the realism of 
the driving simulation for a wider range of lateral 
accelerations. It is hypothesized that the motion gains for the 
different parameters are not necessarily linked [10][11], and 
that they could be different depending on the level of lateral 
acceleration.  
The paper will be structured as follows: in Section II 
“Methods”, the experiment is presented (participants, 
devices, scenario etc.). Section III “Results” gives the results 
of the study. Finally, Section IV “Discussion of Results and 
Conclusion” is a discussion of the results of the study and 
their applications. 
II. 
METHODS 
A. Participants 
27 volunteers (2 women and 25 men), aged between 22 
and 49 (mean age: 28) participated in the study. All were 
PSA (Peugeot Society Automobile) employees who 
volunteered for the study, and none had significant 
experience of the simulator (average dynamic driving 
simulator experience less than 1.5 hours). 
B. Experimental Devices 
SHERPA² is a dynamic driving simulator equipped with 
a hexapod and an X-Y platform. The cell placed on the 
hexapod contains a fully-equipped half-cab Citroen C1 (2 
front adjustable seats, seat belts, steering wheel, pedals, 
gearbox, rearview mirror and side-view mirrors) where the 
driver sits. The motion limits of the hexapod are ±30 cm, 
±26.5 cm and ±20 cm, on X, Y and Z respectively [11]. 
Rotational movements are limited to ±18 deg, ±18 deg and 
±23 degrees, on pitch, roll and yaw respectively. The X-Y 
motion platform can reproduce linear movements of 10 and 
5 
meters. 
The 
maximum 
longitudinal 
and 
lateral 
acceleration is 5 m/s², and is actually produced by a 
combination of tilt and translation (in this paper, lateral 
tilt/translation is called “lateral motion”). 
C. Experimental Scenario 
The vehicle dynamics model (car dynamics and audio) 
selected for the present experiment was a Peugeot 208 1.4 
HDi. The visual scene consisted of a straight two-lane road 
(road width: 8m). Guardrails were placed at both sides of 
the road to delimit the allowed maximum excursion of the 
car. The slalom driving scenario consisted of a series of 8 
posts a constant distance apart (for a given level of 
acceleration). In addition, multiple mini-cones were used to 
represent the optimal sinusoidal pathway and help the 
subjects to perform the task [9]. The posts were alternately 
placed 0.9 m to the right and left side of the road centerline.  
 
 
Figure 1. Visual environment of slalom task. 
The velocity of the car was set at 70 km/h. Then, by 
adjusting the distance separating two posts, various 
theoretical lateral accelerations were imposed. Hence, this 
gave three different slalom scenarios leading to three 
theoretical lateral accelerations, of 1, 2 and 4 m/s², 
corresponding to post spacings of 86.39, 61.09 and 43.19 
meters, respectively. The equation enabling calculation of 
the theoretical lateral acceleration was borrowed from 
Grácio, Wentik and Païs (2011) [12]. 
D. Task 
Drivers were asked to perform a slalom course on the 
dynamic driving simulator by following the mini-cone path, 
without touching any posts or leaving the road. The run was 
performed in cruise control at a constant speed of 70 km/h.  
E. Experimental Design 
For each level of lateral acceleration (1, 2 and 4 m/s²), 
the motion gains of the 3 motion components (lateral 
motion; yaw and roll) were individually varied, leading to a 
total of 25 different conditions (see TABLE I).  
The motion conditions varied according to different 
gains applied to the three simulator motion components. 
Slaloms 1, 2 & 3 respectively correspond to 1, 2 and 4 m/s² 
acceleration levels. Condition 20 corresponds to the current 
SHERPA² configuration. Each participant performed 3 
repetitions per condition for a total of 75 trials divided into 
two sessions to avoid fatigue. The trials were organized 
using a central composite experimental design [13]. The 
choices of motion gains were made taking into account the 
physical limitations of the simulator (position, speed, linear 
and angular acceleration).

During the first session, the participants started with a 
simulator familiarization phase (10 min of rural driving) and 
a slalom learning phase (one trial for each slalom without 
motion of the simulator). This first session was followed by 
twenty-five trials of one slalom (same level of acceleration). 
The second session, performed four hours later, included 
another slalom learning phase along with the 50 remaining 
trials. The order of presentation of the three different 
slaloms was balanced over the total panel of participants. 
The order of the conditions was chosen using a Williams 
Latin Square, to balance the effect of the position and 
carryover effect between samples. The use of a central 
composite experimental design meant that the maximum 
information could be obtained in a minimum duration, and a 
model 
estimating 
nonlinear 
effects 
constructed. 
Furthermore, at the end of each trial, the participants 
answered a couple of questions to provide information about 
their subjective perception of the realism of the vehicle’s 
behavior and the facility of the task. Two 11-point 
qualitative scales were used, ranging from 0 (“Not 
Realistic” or “Not Easy) to 10 (“Very Realistic” or “Very 
Easy”). In addition, motion sickness level was monitored 
throughout the experiment via a Motion Sickness 
Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ) [10]. 
F. Data Analysis 
During the driving task, some dynamic variables were 
recorded from the vehicle and simulator (e.g., lateral 
acceleration, steering wheel angle, lateral position). All 
these measurements were used to conduct an objective 
analysis of driver behavior. The Steering Wheel Reversal 
Rate (SWRR) was calculated from steering wheel angle. 
SWRR is a performance indicator that quantifies the amount 
of steering correction, and means that the effort required to 
accomplish a certain task can be determined [14]. This 
metric measures the frequency of steering wheel reversals 
larger than a finite angle, or gap. The magnitude of this gap, 
the gap size, is thus a key parameter for this metric [15]. In 
the present study, the number of reversals per slalom was 
counted. The steering signal was filtered using a second-
order low-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency 
depending on the slalom level, specifically, 0.6, 2 and 5 Hz 
for the 1, 2 and 4 m/s² acceleration levels respectively. The 
algorithm for detecting the reversal was extracted from 
“Reversal Rate 2” in Östlund’s study (2005) [15], and a 
difference greater than or equal to 2° (gap size) indicates 
one reversal. 
Driving accuracy was quantified as lateral deviation 
from the reference trajectory (center of the mini-cone path) 
and computed as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the 
vehicle path. 
The subjective and objective data were analyzed using 
the NEMRODW [9] software package. For each subjective 
and objective variable, data was collected from each 
participant and a principal component analysis (PCA) was 
performed, in order to determine if there was consensus 
among subjects; if no consensus was found, an ascending 
hierarchical classification was performed. Afterwards, a 
model was constructed (using NEMRODW) so that 
nonlinear effects and the best set of parameters could be 
estimated for a specific slalom level. The model contains 
first and second order coefficients on the three motion 
components. From these coefficients, statistical analyses 
were performed using multiple linear regressions in order to 
determine significant coefficients.

RESULTS 
A. Subjective Analysis 
1) Motion Sickness 
During the experiment, four subjects felt motion 
sickness and were not able to finish all experimental 
conditions (Misery Score ≥6). Three of these participants 
felt motion sickness during the highest slalom level and 
with the highest lateral motion gains (Condition 10, 22 or 23 
in TABLE I). The remaining twenty-three subjects were 
able to conduct the experiment without serious motion 
sickness (average Misery Score = 0.78 ± 1.2). 
2) Realism of Vehicle Behavior 
According to the PCA, no consensus was found among 
participants, so the data was centered, and a hierarchical

clustering performed to identify homogeneous groups of 
subjects. The results of this analysis identified 2 groups (G1 
and G2). The experimental results for the two groups were 
analyzed separately. The analyses of model’s coefficients 
were 
performed 
to 
determine 
the 
optimal 
motion 
configuration. The coefficients are labeled as follows: “B0” 
is the model’s constant, “B1” is the linear coefficient 
applied to lateral motion gain, “B2” is the linear coefficient 
applied to roll gain, and “B1-1” is the squared coefficient of 
lateral motion gain. 
As shown in the TABLE II, for the first slalom (1 m/s²), 
lateral motion was a significant factor for both groups, while 
roll motion was a significant factor only for the second 
group. This means that changing their values should modify 
the perceived realism of the simulator. The model 
coefficients are presented in TABLE II for both groups.

According to the answers of group 1 (G1), the 
experimental model assesses as more realistic a motion 
configuration with: lateral motion gain = 0.5, roll motion 
gain = 1, and yaw motion gain = 0. 
According to the answers of group 2 (G2), the best set of 
parameters for realism is: lateral motion gain = 0.85, roll 
motion gain = 1, and yaw motion gain = 0. Figure 2 shows a 
2D representation of the experimental model of Lateral and 
Roll motion gains for vehicle behavior realism in the first 
slalom and according to G2. In Figure 2, yaw motion gain is 
set at 0. As can be seen on this figure, the quality of realism 
grows with the amplitude of lateral motion gain, until a 
maximum at 0.85. This figure also shows the importance of 
roll motion gain (see TABLE II), which give the best result 
with a value of 1. 
 
 
Figure 2. 3D representation of the experimental model for realism of 
vehicle behavior, for the first slalom and second group. 
For the second slalom, the only significant factor for 
both groups was lateral motion (p<0.01). The lateral motion 
gain should be set to 0.4 and 0.7 for G1 and G2 
respectively, to optimize the realism. In the third slalom, 
and for G1, the three motions were significant factors 
(p<0.01). For best realism, lateral, roll and yaw motion gain 
should be set to 0.25, 1 and 0 respectively. For G2, only 
lateral motion gain was a significant factor (p<0.01), and 
should be set to 0.5. 
 
Figure 3. Best lateral motion gains for the two groups and the three 
slaloms. 
Figure 3 presents the most realistic lateral motion gains, 
according to both groups. Lateral motion gains are 
digressive (reducing with increased acceleration) for both 
groups. Furthermore, for both groups, a roll motion gain of 
1 always gives the best result in all slaloms. 
 
3) Facility of Achieving Slalom 
In the first slalom, no difference was found between all 
configurations. The first slalom was certainly very easy, and 
so drivers did not need external help to perform the task, 
and consequently, did not feel perturbed by the motion of 
the simulator. 
For the second and the third slaloms, PCA analysis 
yielded a consensus between participants. Consequently, 
participants were included in the same group for subsequent 
116

analysis and computation of the model. The only significant 
factor in the second and the third slaloms was lateral motion 
(p<0.01). Contrary to the first slalom, participants found the 
second and the third slaloms less easy to perform, notably 
when lateral motion gain exceeded 0.2 in the second slalom 
and 0 in the third. 
The best motion gains for perceived facility are 
presented in TABLE III.

Facility depends on slalom level, hence the motion 
gains, in particular lateral gain, should be adapted as a 
function of slalom level. 
B. Objective Analysis 
1) Steering-Wheel Reversal Rate 
The PCA revealed a consensus among the participants, 
for all slalom levels. Hence, all 23 participants were 
analyzed together for the three slalom levels. For all slalom 
levels, the main significant factor was lateral motion gain. 
For the first slalom level, the results showed that the 
number of reversals decreases with an increase in lateral 
motion gain, so that more steering corrections were required 
with low lateral motion gain. The analysis also suggests that 
roll motion gain has no effect on driving performance, 
although the best result was obtained for a roll motion gain 
of 0.

Contrary to the first slalom, for the second and the third 
slaloms, the best model was obtained with a roll motion 
gain of 1. However, lateral motion gain has to be reduced 
when lateral acceleration to simulate increase. The yaw 
motion effect, although not significant in the model, seems 
to be best adjusted with a motion gain of 1 (see TABLE IV). 
 
2) Path Root Mean Square Error 
As for the previous variables, a single group was used 
for the model constructions. No difference was found 
between the motion configurations for the first and the 
second slalom. It is possible that the mini-cone path was 
helpful for accurate driving. Nonetheless, differences were 
found in the third slalom (4 m/s²). Again, the significant 
factor was lateral motion gain. 
The experimental model found two configuration 
settings that lead to the same performance (see TABLE V).

Figure 4 shows the results for the second configuration 
(lateral motion gain of 0.35); it can been seen that the curve 
is mainly influenced by the amplitude of lateral motion gain. 
With low or high lateral motion gains, the drivers take wider 
trajectories; thus, extreme lateral motion gains decrease 
drive accuracy.

variable, for the third slalom and the second configuration. 
Thus, the results of objective variables seem to 
corroborate the results of subjective variable concerning the 
setting of lateral and roll motion gains, which is not the case 
for the yaw motion gain. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSION 
The present research aims to reassess motion gains for 
the three lateral motion components (lateral, yaw and roll 
movements) for several levels of lateral acceleration. The 
slalom task has already been validated by several earlier 
studies. This research on dynamic driving simulators 
recommended use of unit motion gains in cornering, to 
improve motion perception and driving behavior [8][14].  
However, these studies did not systematically investigate 
possible changes in the various motion gains depending on 
the levels of acceleration to be simulated. In fact, these 
studies only used equal motion gains for all three lateral 
components, and did not consider the effect of their 
decoupling on final performance and motion perception. In 
the present study, it was found that the three lateral motion 
components should not be set to the same gain, and should 
change as a function of lateral acceleration level.

A. Motion Gains 
These results clearly show that, for all subjective and 
objective evaluations, lateral motion gain should be reduced 
as lateral acceleration increases. The equations from the 
Figure 3, which characterize lateral motion gain as function 
of lateral acceleration, could be used for simulator settings 
in order to improve realism. Nevertheless, these results 
seem to suggest there were two groups of drivers in the test 
population, preferring different lateral motion gains; it is 
possible that some of the participants assessed “comfort” 
instead of the realism. With regard to the subjective 
perception of task facility, a decrease in preferred lateral 
motion gain was observed as slalom level increased. Drivers 
found it more difficult to perform the second and the third 
slalom for configurations with lateral motion gains greater 
than 0.2 and 0 respectively. Greater physical fidelity 
(motions gains close to 1) and hence greater discomfort is 
probably the cause (large driver movements, lower facility 
of driving). Nonetheless, as showed by the objective 
analysis of steering-wheel corrections and lateral deviations, 
lateral motions gains below 0.2 are not recommended for 
maintaining accurate driving. Indeed, varying the amount of 
lateral motion in a simulated slalom affects driver 
performance. Except for the first slalom, where a lateral 
motion gain of 1 enabled optimal steering, driving accuracy 
for the two others slaloms was better with lower lateral 
motions gains. However, a lateral motion gain of 0 is not 
recommended for good driving performance and accuracy, 
as shown by the RMSE variable (see TABLE V).  
With regard to roll motion gain, the experimental model 
showed that a roll motion gain equal to 1 is evaluated as 
being the most realistic situation, despite the fact that the 
two groups preferred different lateral motion gains. 
Although roll motion is not the most significant of the three 
lateral movements, it does enhance driving control for 
slaloms levels ≥2 m/s², notably with a gain of 1 (see TABLE 
IV). 
Yaw motion was never a significant factor for vehicle 
behavior realism, except for G1 and the third slalom. 
Indeed, results on maneuverability show that drivers are 
sensitive to variations in yaw gains, and this motion can 
contribute to a change in the perceived maneuverability.  
However, as can been seen from the objective data from the 
second slalom, a better model is produced with a yaw 
motion gain of 1, probably because a very reactive car 
enables better handling (see TABLE IV).

As presented in Section 3, both subjective and objective 
variables show that lateral motion gain should be reduced 
when the lateral acceleration to simulate increases, so as to 
improve self-motion perception and driving performance. 
This very important result could be related to a previous 
result obtained in longitudinal acceleration, where the way 
the acceleration is produced (tilt/translation ratio) and the 
motion gain required to reproduce braking depend on the 
level of the acceleration [3]. In addition, previous research 
[8] has shown a decrease in steering corrections when lateral 
motion gain is increased. Nevertheless, they analyzed only 
one level of acceleration (1.2 m/s²). In the present study, it is 
shown that with increased lateral acceleration (i.e., slalom 
level), control of the vehicle demands more attention to 
accomplish the slalom with a unit or near a unit lateral 
motion gain. 
The perception of simulated self-motion can tolerate 
significant discrepancies between the physical and visual 
motion cues [16]. Nevertheless, the tilt coordination 
technique was used to reproduce lateral acceleration; it is 
also possible than tilt is more easily perceived as lateral 
acceleration increases. A previous study [17] has shown that 
the limit of lateral tilt (perceived as a tilt and not as a lateral 
acceleration) is higher for active drivers than for passive 
passengers [2]. This research advised limiting tilt rate to 
6°/s, twice the limit found for passive subjects. In our study, 
for the second and third slaloms and for the higher lateral 
motion gains, lateral tilt could reach 14° of inclination and 
an angular velocity of 12°/s (the limit set by our motion 
cueing algorithm or MCA). These magnitudes are higher 
than recommended by Nesti et al. [17], and higher than the 
threshold for roll tilt [18]; hence, the tilt of lateral motion is 
not perceived as lateral acceleration, but rather as a roll 
motion of higher amplitude than natural roll.  
C. Roll Motion 
A roll motion gain equal to 1 was perceived as the most 
realistic; moreover, the results from the RMSE and SWRR 
variables confirm this. Contrary to that for lateral motion 
gain, this result represents a new advance in the domain of 
simulation. It seems to confirm previous results obtained 
with expert drivers [11]. In the present study, this result has 
been extended to the wider population of “normal” drivers. 
A previous study [8] did not find this result. Indeed, as they 
used lateral motion gains of below 1, they never used a 
lateral motion gain of below 1 with a roll motion gain of 1. 
The driving simulator used in the present study reproduces 
exactly the roll angle and its derivates, and is temporally 
coherent with the visual roll. The absolute threshold of roll 
motion is around 2°/s [19]. Thus, a roll motion with a 
downscale factor is not necessarily felt by the driver. A roll 
motion supra-threshold has been shown to reduce latency of 
vection [20]. Hence, roll motion must remain at upper-
thresholds to improve realism and driving performance. 
This means that a roll motion gain equal to 1 is advisable, 
regardless the level of lateral acceleration. 
D. Yaw Motion 
Surprisingly, yaw motion only slightly influences final 
perception, contrary to results obtained in a recent study 
showing that the presence of yaw motion in a curve affected 
driving behavior [21]. This different result could be 
explained by the fact that its intensity was probably not felt 
(yaw rate in slalom 1 (≤3°/s) or was masked by the two

other components, i.e., the lateral and roll motion, unless 
visual yaw is sufficient in this slalom task (with low radius 
of curvature). In the previous study [21], the task was a 
corner negotiation (90° of rotation); the angle of curvature 
along with the total simulator velocity and angle were 
probably greater than in this slalom task. Thus, at higher 
velocity, drivers could probably more easily discern a 
configuration with and without yaw, which was not 
necessarily the case in the present study. Further work is 
required to elucidate this point, notably in a task requiring 
higher angular velocity, total angle, and lower linear speed. 
 
In conclusion, the results of the present study clearly 
demonstrate that lateral motion gain should be adjusted as a 
function of the level of lateral acceleration to simulate. This 
seems to be mandatory for the settings of dynamic driving 
simulators and represents a new advance in the domain of 
simulation. However, tilt limit has to be considered. In 
addition, roll and notably yaw motions seem to have less 
influence 
on 
perception 
and 
driving 
performance. 
Surprisingly, it is therefore suggested that 1-to-1 gain could 
be the best setting for roll (as roll is not necessarily 
perceived by drivers with a lower gain). Although, the 
results from the subjective and objective variables with 
regard to yaw are not in agreement, yaw motion gain is 
never a factor significantly influencing the results in a 
positive way, at least in this slalom task. Thus, we cannot 
recommend 
using 
any 
specific 
yaw 
motion 
gain. 
Consequently, and in order to improve driver perception and 
control performance, the MCA should be changed by 
decreasing the lateral motion gain, while keeping the roll 
motion gain equal to 1. Yaw motion gain needs to be 
studied under different conditions.
