Abstract—In this paper, we propose a novel carrier fre-
quency offset (CFO) estimation scheme for orthogonal fre-
quency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in non-Gaussian
noise environments. The proposed scheme has much wider
estimation range compared with that of the conventional
scheme, improving the overall CFO estimation performance.
Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has
better estimation performance than the conventional scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
Tho orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
signal has been widely used for wireless communication
systems including wireless local area network (WLAN),
wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN), and digital
video broadcasting (DVB) systems [1]. However, the OFDM
system is very sensitive to the carrier frequency offset (CFO)
caused by Doppler shift or oscillator instabilities. Thus,
the CFO estimation is one of the most important issues in
OFDM systems.
Several schemes [2]-[4] have been proposed to estimate
the CFO of OFDM signals. Schmidl and Cox proposed
a CFO estimation scheme using a training symbol with
two identical halves [2], whose estimation range is equal
to the sub-carrier spacing. In [3], a new CFO estimation
scheme that utilizes a training symbol with more than
two identical parts was proposed, increasing the estimation
range twice that of the scheme in [2]. With the maximum-
likelihood (ML) criterion, in [4], an optimal scheme for CFO
estimation was derived using the same training symbol as in
[3]. Recently, in [5], a periodogram-based CFO estimation
scheme was proposed, whose estimation range is as large
as the bandwidth of the OFDM signal while maintaining
the same level of the estimation performance as those of
the schemes based on training symbols with identical parts.
However, the conventional schemes are developed under
the assumption of the Gaussian distributed noise. Since
it has been observed that the noise often exhibits non-
Gaussian nature in wireless channels [6], the conventional
estimators could suffer from performance degradation in the
non-Gaussian noise environments.
In this paper, we propose a novel periodogram-based CFO
estimation scheme for OFDM systems in non-Gaussian noise
environments. We ﬁrst investigate the inﬂuence of the non-
Gaussian noise on the integer part of CFO estimation scheme
in [5], and then, propose a novel fractional frequency offset
(FFO) estimation scheme with wider estimation range. The
numerical results show that the proposed FFO estimation
scheme has better estimation performance than the FFO
estimation scheme in [5] under the inﬂuence of the non-
Gaussian noise.
II. SIGNAL MODEL
After the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) operation,
at the transmitter, the nth complex-valued OFDM sample
x(n) can be expressed as
x(n) =
1
√
N
N−1
∑
k=0
Xkej2πkn/N,
n = 0, 1, · · · , N −1, (1)
where N is the size of the IFFT and Xk is a phase
shift keying (PSK) or a quadrature amplitude modulation
(QAM) symbol in the kth sub-carrier. The data part of the
OFDM symbol has a duration of T seconds, and the cyclic
preﬁx (CP), whose length is generally designed to be longer
than the channel impulse response, is inserted to avoid the
intersymbol interference (ISI).
The nth received OFDM sample r(n) is obtained by
sampling the received OFDM signal every Ts = T/N
seconds and can be expressed as
r(n) = s(n)ej2π(εI+εF )n/N + w(n),
(2)
where s(n) = ∑L−1
k=0 hkx(n − k) is the signal component
with the kth channel ﬁlter tap coefﬁcient hk and the chan-
nel memory size L, εI and εF represent the integer FO
(IFO) and FFO normalized to the sub-carrier spacing 1/T,
respectively, and w(n) is the non-Gaussian noise sample. In
this paper, we assume the static channel during one OFDM
symbol duration and perfect timing synchronization.

III. PROPOSED SCHEME
A. Inﬂuence of the non-Gaussian noise on the IFO estima-
tion
In [5], the estimates ˆεI and ˆεF of the IFO and FFO are
obtained as
ˆεI = arg max
fk
{
I(fk) + I(fk + 1)
}
(3)
and
ˆεF =
√
I(ˆεI + 1)
√
I(ˆεI) +
√
I(ˆεI + 1)
,
(4)
respectively, where ‘arg’ is the argument operation and
I(fk) is the signal periodogram deﬁned as
I(fk) =

N−1
∑
n=0
r(n)e(n)e−j2πfkn/N

2
,
(5)
where fk ∈ {− N
2 , − N
2 + 1, · · · , N
2 − 1} is the kth IFO
candidate, | · | is the absolute operation, and e(n) is the
envelope equalized processing factor, which removes the
inﬂuence of the data modulation, deﬁned by
x(n)∗
∥x(n)∥2 with
the complex conjugation ‘∗’ and Euclidean norm ∥ · ∥.
In the absence of the noise, ˆεF is given by
Z(ˆεI)
Z(ˆεI)+Z(ˆεI+1),
where Z(α) = | sin(π(ε−α)/N)|, and is drawn as a function
of ε − ˆεI as shown in Fig. 1, where ε = εI + εF . It is seen
from the ﬁgure that the FFO can be correctly estimated only
when 0 ≤ ε − ˆεI < 1 (i.e., ˆεI ∈ (ε − 1, ε]) which is referred
to as the correct estimation range.
Fig. 2 shows the IFO metric {I(f) + I(f + 1)} nor-
malized to N 2∥h0∥2 as a function of the frequency f ∈
[−N/2, N/2) for εF = 0.3 when εI = 1, N = 8, and
the noise is absent, where ‘◦’ represents the IFO metric
value corresponding to each fk and the shaded region
represents the correct estimation range. In this paper, the
correct estimation probability of the IFO is deﬁned as the
probability that the maximum IFO metric corresponds to fk
stays within the correct estimation range.
From the ﬁgure, we can see that the IFO metric value
(outside the correct estimation range) nearest to the correct
estimation range is as large as that in the correct estimation
range. Thus, under the inﬂuence of non-Gaussian noise
with impulsive nature, the IFO estimation scheme (3) often
outputs an incorrect estimate.
B. Proposed FFO Estimation Scheme
First, we deﬁne a new function similar to the periodogram,
which can be expressed as
Ip(fk) =
N−1
∑
n=0
r(n)e(n)e−j2πfkn/N.
(6)
In the absence of the noise and interferences, Ip(fk) can be
re-written as
Ip(fk) =
N−1
∑
n=0
h0ej2π(ε−fk)n/N.
(7)
Next, using the ratio Ip(ˆεI) to Ip(ˆεI +1), we can remove
the channel component h0 as follows
Ip(ˆεI)
Ip(ˆεI + 1) =
h0 ·
1−ej2π(ε−ˆεI )
1−ej2π(ε−ˆεI )/N
h0 ·
1−ej2π(ε−ˆεI )e−j2π
1−ej2π(ε−ˆεI )/Ne−j2π/N
= 1 − ej2π(ε−ˆεI)/Ne−j2π/N
1 − ej2π(ε−ˆεI)/N
.
(8)
From (8), the estimate of the FFO ˆεF (≊ ε − ˆεI) can be
obtained as
ˆεF = N
2π ∠
(
1 − M(ˆεI)
ej2π/N − M(ˆεI)
)
,
(9)
where M(ˆεI) = Ip(ˆεI)/Ip(ˆεI + 1) and ∠(y) denotes an
angle of y. From (9), we can see that the estimation range
of the proposed scheme is − N
2
≤ ˆεF <
N
2 . Thus, the
proposed scheme (9) can estimate the FFO in both correct
IFO estimate and incorrect IFO estimate cases.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we compare the performance of the pro-
posed and conventional [5] FFO estimation schemes in terms
of the correct estimation probability. In the simulation, we
assume the following parameters: quadrature PSK (QPSK)
data modulation, the FFT size of N = 64, a CP with a length
of 8 samples, and the maximum Doppler shift of 125 Hz
(corresponding to a mobile speed of 54 km/h with a carrier

frequency of 2.5 GHz). The non-Gaussian noise is modeled
as Cauchy noise [7]. Since the variance is not deﬁned
in Cauchy noise, the standard signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
becomes meaningless. Thus, we employ the geometric SNR
(G-SNR), which provides a mathematically and conceptually
valid characterization of the relative strength between the
signal and noise [8], is deﬁned as
G-SNR =

four-path Rayleigh fading channel model with path delays of
0, 2, 4, and 6 samples and exponential power delay proﬁle
of E{A2
l } = exp(−0.768l) for l = 0, 1, 2, and 3 (i.e., the
power ratio of the ﬁrst and last paths is set to 10 dB).
Figs. 3 and 4 show the correct estimation probabilities
of the FFO as a function of ε − ˆεI for the proposed and
conventional schemes. In the ﬁgures, we can see that the
proposed scheme has wider estimation range than the con-
ventional scheme. Thus, the proposed scheme can estimate
the FFO when ε − ˆεI < 0 and ε − ˆεI > 1 (outside of
the correct estimation range of the IFO). However, we can
observe that the estimation range of the proposed scheme
is narrower than that in the ideal case of − N
2 ≤ ˆεF < N
2
in the absence of noise. This can be explained as follows.
The proposed scheme is based on Ip(ˆεI) and Ip(ˆεI + 1).
As shown in Fig. 2, when the chosen ˆεI is far from the
correct estimation range of the IFO, Ip(ˆεI) and Ip(ˆεI + 1)
have small values, and thus, they would suffer from more
severe inﬂuence of the non-Gaussian noise. Thus, the correct
estimation probability of the proposed scheme becomes
smaller as |ε − ˆεI| increases and the estimation range of
the proposed scheme is narrower than that in the ideal case.
However, as mentioned in Section III-A and shown in Fig.
2, in the most cases, the proposed scheme can improve the
overall CFO estimation performance.
In passing, we would like to stress that the proposed
scheme is applicable to any kind of OFDM system employ-
ing training symbol. However, in the applications adopting
the training symbol solely dedicated to the frequency offset
estimation (e.g., IEEE 802.11 [9], long term evolution (LTE)
[10]), the performance of the proposed scheme may not be
better than the schemes dedicated to the application only.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a novel CFO estimation
scheme for OFDM systems in the non-Gaussian noise envi-
ronments. We have ﬁrst investigated the inﬂuence of the non-
Gaussian noise on the IFO estimation, and then, proposed
a novel FFO estimation scheme with wider FFO estimation
range. From numerical results, we have conﬁrmed that the
proposed scheme has better estimation performance than the
conventional scheme.
