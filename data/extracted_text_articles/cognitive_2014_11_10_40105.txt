Abstract—It is well known that emotional stressors may have 
adverse effects on cognitive-motor performance. The system 
for evaluation of cognitive-emotional interactions, described in 
this paper, is based on real-time interplay between a selected 
cognitive task and selected emotional stressors, and may 
facilitate insight into an individual’s variation of cognitive and 
emotional parameters and variables. To illustrate the effects of 
emotional distraction on cognitive-motor performance, specific 
cognitive-motor test has been designed and combined with 
aversive highly arousing emotional distractions, including 
pictures, sounds, acoustic startle impulses and air blasts, while 
measuring 
multimodal 
physiological, 
vocal, 
facial, 
and 
electroencephalography (EEG) responses. Preliminary two-
phase experimental paradigm has been conducted: Phase 1 – 
cognitive-motor performance testing with neutral distractions, 
and Phase 2 – cognitive-motor performance testing under 
aversive highly arousing emotional distractions. Aversive 
emotional distractions delivered in Phase 2 transiently reduced 
cognitive-motor performance and produced stronger skin 
conductance changes in comparison to Phase 1 neutral 
distractions.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
It is well known that emotional stressors may have 
harmful 
and 
damaging 
effects 
on 
cognitive-motor 
performance. While some individuals are resilient, others are 
extremely vulnerable to such emotional disturbances. 
Cognitive-emotional interactions are mediated by functional 
connectivity between the PreFrontal Cortex (PFC) and 
limbic dynamic neural networks, which shape behavior 
[1][2][3][4]. The amygdala as the emotional hub is 
extensively interconnected with the PFC, especially the 
posterior OrbitoFrontal Cortex (OFC), and the Anterior 
Cingulate Cortex (ACC). The influence of emotional 
distractors and stressors on cognitive capacities is 
challenging to study due to the complexity of interconnection 
and interaction PFC and limbic neural networks that mediate 
cognitive-emotional interactions. Protective higher-order 
cognitive performance within an emotionally stressful 
environment is extremely important for individual judgment, 
reasoning, decision making and maintaining cognitive 
abilities in psychologically demanding environments. 
Therefore, this paper presents the design and implementation 
of a synthetic experimental environment for assessment of 
individual cognitive-motor performance under stressful 
emotional distractions. Real-time monitoring of individual 
cognitive-motor performance based on appropriate cognitive 
metrics, real-time generation of emotional distractions and 
measurements of the individual's multimodal physiological, 
EEG, vocal and facial responses enable real-time tracking of 
individual cognitive-emotional interaction. Such real-time 
tracking of cognitive and emotional performance over time 
can be used as a predictor of individual cognitive deficits 
prior to a negative impact of hard emotional stressors on 
strategic 
decision-making 
failures. 
Identification 
and 
recognition of individuals with a low level of emotional 
stability and robustness is very important to avoid the 
negative impact of reduced higher-order cognitive capacities, 
such as judgment, planning, and attention on effective 
decision-making. Therefore, the prediction of individual 
cognitive performance within stressful environments, which 
may significantly reduce their cognitive performance, is of 
foremost importance. 
Section 2 describes the technical aspect of the system 
used for evaluation of cognitive-emotional interactions. The 
proposed novel computerized testing of subject’s cognitive-
motor performance, as well as the corresponding cognitive-
motor performance metrics is introduced in Section 3. The 
process of generation of emotional distractions and 
measurement of their impact on subject’s physiological, 
acoustic, facial and EEG reaction is shown in Section 4. 
Section 5 describes the experimental paradigm and 
preliminary results conducted using the proposed system. 
The last section gives a brief overview of experimental 
results.

SYSTEM FOR EVALUATION OF COGNITIVE-
EMOTIONAL INTERACTIONS 
The system for evaluation of cognitive-emotional 
interactions is shown in Figure 1, which is based on real-time 
interplay between a selected cognitive task and selected 
emotional stressor, and enables better and deeper real-time 
insight into an individual’s variation of cognitive and 
emotional parameters and variables.  
As shown in Figure 1, it can be divided into three 
subsystems: 
1. Cognitive-motor subsystem for generation and 
delivering of a variety of cognitive tasks and 
evaluation of cognitive-motor performance such as 
motor reaction time, tracking accuracy, latency, 
inhibition of distractions, recovery time, etc. 
2. Emotional subsystem for generating of emotional 
distractors like images, sounds, narratives, stories, 
video clips, acoustic startle, air blast, etc. 
3. Multimodal acquisition subsystem for monitoring 
subject’s physiological, acoustic, linguistic, facial 
and EEG features, etc. 
Multimodal acquisition subsystem include: Biopac 
MP150 unit with ECG100C, RSP100C, EMG100C, 
GSR100C 
and 
SKT100C 
modules 
for 
physiology 
acquisition; voice acquisition system headset Sennheiser PC 
360; video acquisition system Logitech C920 webcam; and 
EEG acquisition system NeuroSky ThinkGear AM. The air 
blast delivery module [5][6] includes Messer air tank, 
solenoid valve, camelback with nozzle attached to hose and 
solenoid controller. The 140 p.s.i. air blast is triggered by 
Measurement Computing DIO24 PCI Card, which is also 
used for synchronization of cognitive-motor, emotional and 
multimodal acquisition subsystem. The acoustic startle 
module generates 108 dB (A) Sound Pressure Level (SPL) 
40-msec white noise bursts with 0-msec rise and fall times, 
which are delivered by a Samson headphone amplifier and 
Sennheiser 
PC 
360 
professional 
audio 
headphones. 
Aggregated longitudinal real-time analysis of cognitive-
motor and emotional performance offers considerable 
potential in deeper and better understanding of a specific 
individual’s cognitive-emotional strengths or weaknesses 
and enables comprehensive training and selection. 
III. 
COMPUTERIZED COGNITIVE TESTING 
Cognitive-motor performance in a complex, dynamically 
changing environment in which emotional and cognitive 
processes continuously influence each other depends on an 
individual’s perception, reasoning, feeling, and action 
tendencies. The system shown in Figure 1 can facilitate a 
variety of cognitive, motor and neuropsychological tests that 
have their own metrics for evaluation of specific aspects of 
an individual’s higher cognitive-motor competencies and 
functions in stressful environments. The human abilities of 
reasoning, thinking, analyzing and problem solving as valid 
measures of individual performance are widely recognized as 
excellent predictors of job performance. But, such approach 
could not capture and predict cognitive competencies and 
cognitive-motor performance within stressful emotional 
environments. Therefore, this paper describes the design and 
testing of an experimental testbed where subjects are faced 
with a complex set of cognitive tasks and conditions as well 
as a variety of environmental emotional distractors.

Cognitive performance might be related to: fluid reasoning 
as mental operations for solving novel problems; spatial 
ability as the ability to generate, retain, retrieve and 
transform visual images, including spatial visualization and 
spatial orientation; situation awareness as a mental process of 
knowing what is going on around you and is closely related 
to the accuracy and completeness of situation awareness, 
which imposes a heavy demand on working memory; 
executive function related to planning and organization, 
initiation and inhibition of behavior, strategizing, problem 
solving, flexible thought processes, behavior monitoring, 
self-awareness, and judgment [7]. Real-time measurements 
of all these individual’s cognitive-motor abilities in a rapidly 
changing complex and stressful environment deserve more 
attention.  
To illustrate the effects of emotional distraction on 
cognitive-motor performance the following cognitive-motor 
test has been designed as a computer game displayed on the 
computer screen, in which the subject’s task is to avoid 
collisions with falling objects. The subject uses two buttons 
on the response pad to evade the falling objects by moving 
left or right. In this example the cognitive effectiveness of 
the individual could be studied and measured by correctly 
headings cursor surface to effectively engage joystick pads 
through dynamically moving obstacle surfaces. The 
cognitive-motor test is used in two phases of experimental 
paradigm: in Phase 1 the test is delivered to the subjects 
mixed with emotionally neutral distractions, while in Phase 2 
the test is mixed with fear-related emotional distractions and 
stressors, which are described in the next section. Before 
Phase 1, there is practice session to stabilize the subject’s 
performance on this test when no distractions occur at all. 
During the game, collision area with falling objects is 
calculated in real-time, from which cognitive-motor 
performance can be computed. Development and evaluation 
of relevant quantitative measures of joystick manipulations 
enable appraisal of the individual’s current skill levels. 
During the execution of cognitive-motor test, the collision 
area with falling objects is computed in real-time, as the 
basis of cognitive-motor performance metric. Configurations 
of falling objects are randomized, in order to avoid learning 
effects. However, in order to maintain 
maximum 
comparability between subjects, they are exposed to the 
same order and the same configurations of falling objects. 
Cognitive-motor performance in time interval [ti, ti+1], 
which is large enough to smooth the stochastic relationship 
between cursor surface CS(tj) and dynamically moving 
obstacle surfaces OS(tj), can be defined based on intersection 
areas:

which measures the ratio of the subject's cumulative 
intersection area with falling objects versus the worst 
possible cumulative intersection area. The worst cumulative 
intersection area would be achieved if, at each moment tj, the 
subject was always in the spot of the falling object, which 
had the largest intersection with the subject’s zone of motion. 
This computerized cognitive-motor test can be configured 
flexibly with different levels of difficulty, in order to avoid 
floor or ceiling effects on performance. 
IV. 
EMOTIONAL DISTRACTIONS GENERATION AND 
MEASUREMENT 
Multimodal emotional elicitation [8] includes a variety of 
audio and visual stimuli like images, video clips, multimedia 
picture databases with universal facial expressions like 
NimStim Face Stimulus Set [9], International Affective 
Picture System (IAPS) [10], natural and manmade sounds, 
International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS) [11], 
recorded speech, written text messages, virtual reality 
synthetic environments, spoken narratives, stories, face-to-
face 
conversation, 
acoustic 
startle, 
air 
blast, 
fear 
conditioning/fear extinction paradigm, etc. Sounds and 
suitable narratives can be played and read along the visual 
stimuli enhancing the effects of the pictures and thereby 
taking full advantage of the multimodal emotion elicitation 
paradigm. As specific multimodal composite stimuli to 
enhance arousal level during emotion distraction we include 
highly arousing aversive IAPS video images and IADS 
sounds, in combination with 40 ms acoustic impulses of 108 
dB (A) SPL broadband noise and 250 ms 140 p.s.i. air blasts 
startle delivered to the subject’s larynx. Additional aversive 
stimuli include a 500-ms electric shock ranging from 0.5 to 
5.0 mA, delivered through electrodes attached to the fourth 
finger of the non-dominant hand, which can be selected to be 
highly irritating but not painful. The goal of multimodal 
emotion elicitation is to provide a variety of stimuli, which 
are capable of eliciting broadband emotional distractions to 
analyze the subject’s vulnerabilities related to the decline of 
specific cognitive performance due to deficits in attention, 
anticipation, speed of motor reactions, etc. Cognitive-
emotional interactions can be measured by cognitive task 
performance and multimodal bodily physiological and motor 
reactions, as well as subjective feelings. 
Estimation of elicited emotion is based on data fusion of 
Physiological-Features(t), 
Vocal-Features(t), 
Facial-
Features(t) and EEG-Features(t) extracted from individual’s 
physiological, facial, speech, and EEG signals [12] (Figure 
2). Physiological-Features(t) include: FHR,mean heart rate 
mean value, FHR,std heart rate standard deviation, FSC,mean skin 
conductance mean value, FSC,std skin conductance standard 
deviation, LF/HF low frequency/high frequency ratio (heart 
rate variability measure), FSCR,freq frequency of SCRs and 
FSCR,mag mean magnitude of SCRs, etc. Altogether, over three 
hundred physiological features can be computed from the 
acquired signals [13]. Vocal-Features(t) include: FT,kw_vec 
keyword vector, FE,std standard deviation of a speech signal 
energy, FP,jitt jitter of a pitch frequency contour, FS,F1_bw_mean 
mean value of a first formant bandwidth and FZCR,mean mean 
value of a zero cross rate, etc. More than four hundred vocal

features can be computed [14]. Facial-Features(t) include: 
FMW mouth width, FMH mouth height, FREW right eye width, 
FREH right eye height, FLEW left eye width, FLEH left eye 
height of the current facial expression, etc. EEG-Features(t) 
include: alphaPSD power spectral density of frequency band 
alpha (8-12 Hz), betaPSD power spectral density of 
frequency band beta (12-30 Hz), gammaPSD power spectral 
density of frequency band gamma (30-100 Hz), etc., sig_avg 
average EEG signal value, sig_max maximal value of EEG 
signal, etc. [15].  
Based on this set of multimodal features it is also 
possible to estimate the individual’s discrete emotions, e.g., 
fear intensity, happiness, sadness, disgust, or intensity of 
valence and/or arousal [16] and current level of perceived 
stress (e.g., see [9][17]). 
For illustration, acoustic startle, which induces muscle 
contractions

Equation (2) represents the mean level of the orbicularis

EXPERIMENTAL PARADIGM AND RESULTS 
To develop cognitive performance predictive models as 
specific indicators of individual effective performance we 
need quantifiable variables and metrics to systematically 
evaluate 
cognitive 
performance 
within 
environments 
characterized with a variety of specific emotional distractors. 
A methodology for evaluation of the degradation of 
cognitive-motor performance will be presented, including 
metrics of cognitive-motor tasks, metrics of emotional 
response, as well as metrics of combined cognitive-motor-
emotional interaction. Evaluation of cognitive-motor metrics 
under emotional distraction might be used as a measure of 
individual cognitive resilience within stressful environment, 
like high individual situational awareness, cognitive 
orientation, focused attention and situational assessment, etc. 
under the influence of environmental emotional noise. Such 
an approach enables evaluation and better understanding of 
complex higher-order cognitive processes and emotional 
vulnerability as well as better prediction of individual 
behavioral performance.  
For evaluation and selection of resilient or vulnerable 
subjects in the presented cognitive-motor-emotional game

Monitoring cognitive-motor performance variations 
under stressful stimuli is important for evaluating how each 
individual copes with different emotional distractors and 
might be used to assess individual differences to inhibit 
fearful stimuli and retain higher levels of cognitive function. 
Prediction of how people will behave in emergency 
situations and how they perceive and anticipate stressful 
stimuli may have enormous practical values. Such 
experimental laboratory infrastructure enables prediction of 
the individual’s cognitive-motor performance in stressful 
environments and can be used in progress monitoring during 
mental readiness training and selection of individuals with 
robust cognitive-motor performance under the stress. 
Evaluation of cognitive-motor performance degradation due 
to emotional distractors might be also used to develop 
predictive models of individual cognitive-motor performance 
in correlation with intensity of emotional distractors. The 
supervisor may select specific cognitive tasks and a variety 
of audio-visual stimuli distractors using the relevant user 
friendly interface. 
The sensitivity analysis concerning the influence of 
emotional stressors on cognitive-motor performance under 
the impact of aversive IAPS images, IADS sounds, acoustic 
startle and air blast in the high-threat period of Phase 2, is 
shown in Figure 3. The purpose of this experiment is to 
investigate how emotional distraction affects performance of 
a cognitive-motor task described in Section 2. For illustration 
of the discrimination potential of the system, two-phase 
experimental paradigm has been conducted, as described 
previously: Phase 1 – cognitive-motor performance testing 
with neutral distractions, and Phase 2 – cognitive-motor 
performance testing under high-threat arousing emotional 
distractions. In Phase 2, aversive IAPS images and IADS 
sounds enhanced by an acoustic startle and air blast are 
delivered to the subject.

Figure 4 illustrates that aversive emotional distractions 
delivered in Phase 2 can transiently reduce cognitive-motor 
performance 
relative 
to 
neutral 
distractions, 
since 
performance of both subjects decreased after first two 
emotional stressors at 60 and 120 seconds. Cognitive-motor 
performance was computed on 5-second intervals according 
to equation (1). Furthermore, aversive emotional distractions 
in Phase 2 produced stronger skin conductance changes for 
both subjects, in comparison with neutral distractions in 
Phase 1, and these changes were visible after all four 
emotional distractors. Despite this presence of emotions, the 
subjects seem to have habituated their cognitive-motor 
performance on the third and fourth emotional distractor. 
Preliminary proof-of-concept testing with two subjects 
precludes broader statistical analyses, but the results 
illustrate that designed emotional distractors were able to 
produce reliable physiological changes, which may also 
transiently lead to decreased performance on this specific 
game. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented a computerized system for 
real-time monitoring of cognitive-emotional interactions. 
This paper also illustrates an approach to objective 
measurement 
of 
cognitive-motor 
performance 
simultaneously with measurements of subject’s multimodal 
physiological, 
acoustic, 
facial 
and 
EEG 
response. 
Preliminary testing on two participants was conducted, 
which showed transient decrease in cognitive-motor 
performance induced by various emotional distractors in 
comparison to neutral distractors. Physiological response 
measurements also indicated apparent difference in subject’s 
bodily response to emotional distractors in comparison with 
neutral distractors. The cognitive-emotional interaction in the 
experimental 
paradigm 
was 
illustrated 
by 
inverse 
relationship 
between 
the 
subject’s 
cognitive-motor 
performance and physiological, i.e., skin conductance 
response.
