Abstract—This paper presents an initial investigation of 
practical realization of quantum secure communication using 
the three-stage multi-photon tolerant protocols. The secret raw 
key was optimized and used to calculate the maximum 
achievable distance at three different wavelengths, i.e., 1550 nm, 
1310 nm, and 850 nm assuming lossless fiber optics channel 
length. The maximum achievable distances for the three 
wavelengths were around 200 km, 140 km, and 25 km, 
respectively.

 INTRODUCTION 
Quantum cryptography is an emerging field in network 
security that relies on quantum mechanics proofs [1, 2] rather 
than on the complexity of solving a mathematical problem as 
in the case of classical cryptography. It is mainly used for 
secret key distribution, called quantum key distribution 
(QKD). The BB’84 protocol is the first QKD distribution 
protocol [1] and it was proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 
1984. BB’84 is based on encoding the bits of a random key 
using a single photon for each bit. The major drawbacks 
associated with the BB’84 protocol are due to the constraint 
of using a single photon per encoded bit to provide a provably 
secure QKD scheme. Therefore, this protocol is vulnerable to 
photon number splitting attacks (PNS) in cases where more 
than a single photon is generated per bit transmission.  
The 
three 
stage 
multi-photon 
tolerant 
protocol 
investigated in this paper does not require any prior 
agreement between a sender Alice and a receiver Bob [3-5]. 
This protocol is based on the use of unitary transformation 
known only to the party applying them. The transformation 
applied to the message in transit is the key that provides it 
with quantum level security. As shown in Figure 1, for each 
transmission, Alice and Bob use a new set of transformations.  
Coherent non-decoying quantum states are used in this 
paper in order to transfer the encoded bits from Alice to Bob.  
The studied multi-photon, multi-stage protocol is considered 
quantum secure as long as less than 𝑁 photons are used for 
communication [5] [6]. Therefore, in this paper, it is assumed 
that a light source can be constructed such that its Poisson 
photon-number distribution is truncated to a maximum 
number of photons. Although, this type of light source does 
not exit practically at this time, current and future 
developments in this field can lead to such sources and hence 
validate this research in a practical setup. Based on this and 
the formulations obtained, the maximum achievable distance 
for the three wavelengths of interest were evaluated at: 1550 
nm, 1310 nm, and 850 nm.

Significantly, this is the first research that has ever been 
done on the three stage protocol that estimates key results 
such as maximum distance that can be achieved at three key 
communication wavelengths, and then compares the data to 
existing results. Moreover, the three stage multi-photon 
protocol eliminates the need for the sifting step that is needed 
in the BB’84 protocol. In section II, the BB’84 formulations 
were adopted to fit the three stage protocol under study. 
Section III include the theoretical data and results obtained, 
while section IV is the conclusion.

FORMULATION METHOD 
A sender, Alice, has in her possession a list of symbols 
(called raw key); she wishes to share them with Bob using the 
three stage quantum protocol. To extract a short secret key 
from the raw key, one-way post-processing is required. The 
optimal one–way post processing consists of two steps. The 
first step is error correction (EC), also called information 
reconciliation, at the end of which the raw key becomes 
shorter and symbols perfectly correlated. The second step is 
privacy amplification (PA), and it is aimed at diminishing 
Eve’s knowledge of the reference raw key. The length of the

final secret key depends on Eve’s information about the raw 
keys.   
However, for practical setups, a practical parameter must 
also be taken into account as well: namely the raw key rate 
(R) rather than the raw key. This rate depends on the protocol 
used and on details of the implementation setup: the source 
used, losses in the channel, efficiency, and type of detectors.  
Hence, to assess the performance of practical single-stage 
protocol, a secret key rate is defined as [7]:  
 
𝐾 = 𝑅𝑟  
 
 
      (1) 
Based on the suggestions from references [6] and [7], the 
protocol is secure as long as the number of photons are less 
than a threshold maximum value Nmax. . We express the raw 
key rate R by the following equation: 
 
R=sPBob(Nmax)=s ∑
pA(n) [1- (1-detqc)
n
]  
Nmax
n=1
        (2) 
 
The factor 𝑠 is the repetition rate of the source used, and 
𝑃𝐵𝑜𝑏(𝑁)  is Bob’s detection probability. Under the no-
truncation assumption (i.e. Nmax ), Alice’s photon-
number distribution for a polarized-modulated pulse that she 
uses to send a single bit is according to Poissonian statistics 
of mean 𝜇 = 〈𝑛〉, 𝑝𝐴(𝑛) = 𝜇𝑛
𝑛! 𝑒−𝜇.  Because of the truncation 
assumption at Nmax, 𝑝𝐴(𝑛), it was properly normalized so that 
Alice’s average photon number is represented correctly by 
𝜇 = 〈𝑛〉.   𝑑𝑒𝑡  is the quantum efficiency of the detector 
(typically 10% at telecom wavelengths), and 𝑞𝑐  is the 
attenuation due to losses in the quantum channel.  For fiber 
optics link with length 𝐷, 𝑞𝑐 is given by 
 
qc=10
-αD
10 ,   
 
 
      (3) 
where  is the attenuation coefficient in dB/km at telecom 
wavelengths of interest. In this paper, we consider three 
communication wavelengths =1550 nm, 1310 nm, and 850 
nm with attenuation coefficients of 0.25, 0.35, and 2 dB/km 
respectively.  
The second parameter in (1) is defined as the secret 
fraction r, and can be written in terms of quantities that are 
known from calibration or from the parameter estimation of 
the protocol as [7]: 
 
r= (1-
μ
2detqc) {1-h(2Q)}-h(Q),   
     (4) 
 
 
 
Where Q is the expected error rate QBER and h is the binary 
entropy.  
As a first step, set in (2) was an assumed maximum 
number of photons 𝑁𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 12 that was encoded by Alice 
and sent to Bob at a fixed optics link length D to calculate the 
secret key rate 𝐾 as a function of µ. A maximum K value will 
be obtained at an optimum value of µ referred to in this paper 
as 𝜇𝑜𝑝𝑡.  Since the attenuation in (3) depends on the D and α, 
used, in this first step, is a laboratory short distance (𝐷 ≈ 0) 
for the calculation of 𝜇𝑜𝑝𝑡 where the attenuation is equal to 
1.00 regardless of the wavelength used.  
As a second step, using this optimum value of µopt, one 
can calculate the secret key rate 𝐾 from (1) as a function of 
the optical length D for each of the three communication 
wavelengths under investigations. The maximum optical link 
length or distance that can be achieved at each wavelength 
can then be determined. Varying the optics link length will 
affect the attenuation in (3), and hence will reduce the value 
of the maximum secret key rate from its peak value at D≈ 0. 
III. 
RESULTS 
As shown in Figure 2, the secret key rate from (1) as a 
function of 𝜇 for 𝑁𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 12 . One notices that the maximum 
𝐾 value occurs at 𝜇𝑜𝑝𝑡 = 7.22. This value can then be used to 
calculate the maximum secret key as a function of D.  As we 
increase D, the maximum secret key rate starts to decrease 
linearly until we reach a maximum possible distance (Dmax.). 
The maximum possible distances (𝐷𝑚𝑎𝑥) that can be achieved 
at 𝜇𝑜𝑝𝑡  can be found from Figure 3 at the fall off K values due 
to the effects of error correction and privacy amplifications  
for a no-decoy state at 𝜇𝑜𝑝𝑡 = 7.22 as a function of distance. It 
can be noted from the linear relationship that these effects are 
small for short distances and small losses. However as we 
approach the maximum possible distance the channel losses 
increase; thus EC and PA have more severe effects on K. This 
leads to a sharp drop in the secret key rate at the distance of 
about 200 km for the 1550 nm wavelength. This distance is 
comparable and even better theoretically from the currently 
used protocols in the market where the maximum distance 
achieved is around 100 km.  The influence of the wavelength 
through the attenuation coefficients on the secret key rate 
values for 𝜇𝑜𝑝𝑡 = 7.22 at 1310 nm and 850 nm are also shown 
in Figure 3. The maximum distances that can be achieved at 
1310 nm and 850 nm are 140 km and 25 km, respectively. The 
maximum achievable distance is higher at  = 1550 nm that is 
due to the low attenuation of the medium at this wavelength.

CONCLUSION 
This theoretical study was the first one toward determining 
key parameters and results to validate the use of the three stage 
multi-photon protocol in a practical setup. One of the key 
parameters that was determined is the maximum optical link 
length or maximum distance that the three stage multi-photon 
protocol can achieve to securely distribute a secret key 
between Alice and Bob at three communication wavelengths.  
Namely: 1550 nm, 1310 nm, and 850 nm. It is concluded that 
the maximum achievable distance using the three stage multi 
photon can reach 200 km at 1550 nm, theoretically, exceeding 
the single photon BB’84 protocol. This is an important result 
that needs to be proved in a practical setup. Operating at the 
other two wavelengths, where the fiber attenuation is higher, 
and decreases the maximum distance in a noticeable way. 
Future work is required to validate this study.  A starting 
point is to develop a laboratory setup were the fiber distance 
can be can considered zero and hence the maximum secret key 
rate can be determined and compared with the findings in this 
paper. Potential future research includes the use of fiber link 
lengths and wavelengths as parameters to determine the 
maximum distance that can be achieved practically with the 
use of this protocol.    In addition, it can include developing a 
light source that can be truncated to a maximum number of 
photons per pulse.
