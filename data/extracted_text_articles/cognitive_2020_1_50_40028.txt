Abstract— We continue a series of works on modeling especially 
the human aspects of cognitive process, such as intuition, the 
influence of emotions, the role of personality, etc.  The Natural 
Constructive Cognitive Architecture proposed and analyzed in 
our previous works has an important design feature: the entire 
system consists of two connected subsystems conventionally 
corresponding to the cerebral hemispheres of human brain. One 
of them is responsible for the processing of well-known 
information, the other is aimed at learning new information and 
creative work. This paper is focused on analyzing the extreme 
mode of thinking process, namely, the effect of panic in creative 
work (“throes of creativity”).  It is shown that the regime of 
panic in an artificial cognitive system could be imitated by 
chaotic fluctuations in the amplitude of self-excitation around 
an abnormally high level. A sharp drop in the self-excitation 
level below the normal value (ensuring normal system’s 
functioning) leads to a decrease in efficiency (an analogue to the 
depression).  
Keywords-emotions; creativity; noise; chaotic oscillations; 
extreme conditions. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Modeling the human cognitive process still represents a 
challenge in spite of considerable efforts undertaken in this 
field [1] – [3]. The influence of emotions to the logical 
thinking attracts especial attention [4] – [6], but the problem 
has no ultimate solution yet. In particular, this concerns the 
features of human thinking in difficult (extreme) situations 
[7], disease [8][9], stress [10], etc.  
In our previous papers [11] – [15], we have proposed and 
elaborated the so called Natural Constructive Cognitive 
Architecture (NCCA). This model has an important design 
feature: the entire system consists of two connected 
subsystems (hemi-systems), conventionally corresponding to 
the cerebral hemispheres, the right (RH) and left hemi-
systems (LH), respectively. One of them (LH) is responsible 
for the processing of well-known information (recognition, 
prediction, etc.), the other one (RH) is aimed at the perception 
of new information, learning, and creative work.  
The idea that any developing system should consist of two 
subsystems, one for generating an information (with the 
obligatory participation of a random element – noise), the 
other one for conservation of information (noise free) had 
been put forward in the works of Haken [16] and Chernavskii 
from the theoretical physics viewpoints [17]. Independently, 
similar idea appeared in the works of neuro-psychologist-
clinician Goldberg [3] and was supported by clinical data 
(tests, fMRI study, etc.).  He had argued that the generating 
subsystem corresponds to the Right Hemisphere (RH) of 
human brain, while the conservation subsystem could be 
associated with the Left Hemisphere (LH). 
Within NCCA, this specialization is ensured by the 
presence of random element (noise) in RH (random self-
excitation of neurons). Each hemi-system represents a 
complex multi-level hierarchical structure of various neural 
processors [18] – [20], with connections between neurons are 
to be trained according to different rules in RH and LH. 
Emotions are treated as a product of interaction between 
cortical and subcortical structures [21][22].  
In this paper, NCCA is used to analyze the extreme mode 
of the cognitive process – the effect of panic. We consider the 
panic caused not by certain external (threatening) factors, but 
by the need to solve urgently any complex problem (the so-
called “throes of creativity”).  
The paper is organized as follows. The problems of 
creativity are considered in Section II. In Section III, the main 
peculiar features of NCCA and our hypothesis on possible 
panic representation are discussed. Conclusions and 
discussion of further perspectives are presented in Section IV.  
II. 
 PROBLEMS OF CREATIVE WORK    
The creativity is treated as the ability of a person to find 
non-standard and nontrivial new decisions, to generate and 
perceive fundamentally new ideas and concepts [23][24]. Up 
to some degree, this ability is inherent in any person who is 
placed in new and, especially, extreme conditions. However, 
very rarely a new concept invented by a person becomes 
socially significant and considered as a chef-d’oeuvre, while 
the person is treated as a genius. Generally speaking [24], the 
creativity requires:   
• 
ability to extract key issues and ask important 
questions; 
• 
striving for novelty and the ability to find new 
solutions even for old problems; 
• 
ability to correlate old knowledge with new problems;  
• 
flexibility of thinking, i.e., the ability to abandon 
dogmas if new information contradicts them;  
• 
perseverance and focus on solving the problem;  
• 
“free wandering thoughts”. 
But all this is not a recipe for creating a chef-d’oeuvre ⎯ such 
recipe does not exist at all, which is really an enigma [15].  
From a neurophysiological viewpoint [25][26], it is 
believed that RH and the prefrontal cortex are responsible for 
the processing the new information and creativity. Actually, 
this formula is not entirely correct. Creativity is a complex

process requiring participation of many brain structures in 
RH and LH. Thus, the flexibility of thinking and the free 
wandering thoughts are associated with image thinking, 
while focus requires activation of both frontal lobes. The 
comparison of old and new knowledge occurs in the dialogue 
between RH and LH, etc. [24].  
Under extreme conditions, the extreme modes of the brain 
functioning (like stress, hyperactivity, etc.) could be switched 
on, which is accompanied by emotional instability [10]. In 
this case, the emotional excitation activates the latent 
("sleeping") neurons (self-excitation), but there is a huge 
expenditure of energy. Naturally, such regime cannot last 
long. It may end in success, i.e., a decision satisfying the 
person and causing a surge of positive emotions. If the 
solution had not been found, the depression (loss of strength) 
occurs that could be associated with an energy overrun.   
An extreme case of specific regimes is called a panic. 
Usually, panic is understood as a strong stress response to 
unexpected and frightening external phenomena. Moreover, 
a person’s behavior in a state of panic is individual, 
unpredictable and usually chaotic, from febrile activity to 
falling into a stupor [7][8][23]. 
However, we consider not the reaction to a threat to life, 
but to the need to solve urgently certain cognitive 
(intellectual) problem.  Here, the intensive (up to the stress 
regime) search for a solution could lead to increased stress up 
to the regime of intellectual panic, which is called also 
“throes of creativity”. This regime is characterized by the 
same (may be not so pronounced) manifestations: chaotic 
emotional jumps from euphoria (when the solution seems to 
be found) to disappointment (if it appears to be incorrect), 
and again, from over-mobilization to complete decline and 
despair (depression). 
Thus, negative emotions (anxiety, worrying) and the panic 
in particular can play both negative (destructive) and positive 
(constructive) role, if expressed in over-mobilization and 
does not result in deep depression.   
III. 
MAIN FEATURES OF NCCA   
The model NCCA has been elaborated in [11][12][13]. It 
is based on the dynamical theory of information [16][17][30], 
neuroscience [21][22], and neurocomputing [18] – [20].   Let 
us recall briefly its main features. 
A. Mathematics and schematic representation of NCCA 
The system is combined by two coupled hemi-subsystems, 
RH and LH, by analogy to the cerebral hemispheres of human 
brain.  They represent complex multilevel block-hierarchical 
combination of neural processors of the Hopfield [16] type 
(H) and Grossberg [17] type (G), referring to description of 
neocortex. These equations could be written in the form:  
𝑑𝐻𝑖
0(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡

𝜏𝑖
𝐻 [𝐻{𝐻, 𝛽𝑖(𝐺𝑅{𝑖})} + ∑ 𝛺𝑖𝑗

0], 
(2) 
where, H0i (raw images) and Htypi (typical images) variables 
(bistable elements) refer to Hopfield-type processors [18] for 
RH and LH, respectively. These processors correspond to the 
distributed memory (images), where each object is 
represented by certain chain of excited neurons, ij refer to 
connections between neurons within the processor; the 
functional H describes the internal dynamics.  The variable 
Z(t) in RH represents amplitude of the random self-excitation, 
with 0<(t)<1 being random function, and 𝜏𝑍  being 
characteristic time of Z(t) variations.

𝐿,(𝜎+𝜈)} + 𝛬(𝑡) ⋅ 𝐺𝑘
𝑅,𝜎].           (4) 
Here, GR,k and GL,k represents the symbols [19] in RH and 
LH, respectively. They are also bistable elements with 
internal dynamics described by the functional G; ik 
correspond to the connections between image neurons and 
their symbol; the functional  describes interactions between 
symbols at various levels, that results in creating the symbolic 
images at the current level and their symbols at the next level 
(for details see [13]). The marker  specifies the number of 
the symbol-processor level.  
The hemi-systems RH and LH have different functional 
specialization. RH plays the main role in learning of new 
information and creativity, while LH is responsible for 
processing the well-known information. This specialization 
is secured by the presence of random factor (noise) in RH and 
different training rules for all the connections, i.e., Hebbian 
rule [29] for RH and Hopfield one [18] for LH, e.g.: 
       
𝑑𝛺𝑖𝑗
𝐻𝑒𝑏𝑏(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
=
𝛺0
4𝜏𝛺 ⋅ [𝐻𝑖(𝑡) + 1] ⋅ [𝐻𝑗(𝑡) + 1],      (5) 
that corresponds to gradual connection amplification with 
time in RH (the choice), and  
𝑑𝛺𝑖𝑗
𝐻𝑜𝑝𝑓(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
= −
𝛺0
2𝜏𝛺 ⋅ [1 − 𝐻𝑖(𝑡) ⋅ 𝐻𝑗(𝑡)],           (6) 
that corresponds to the selection of relevant connections 
(“redundant cut-off”) in LH; 0 being the characteristic 
(maximum, or “black”) value of the connection. Due to this 
difference, 
LH 
stores 
only 
well-trained 
(“black”) 
connections, while RH stores as well weak (or “grey”) ones.   
Finally, (t) secures the interaction (“dialog”) between 
hemi-systems so as  = +0 corresponds to RH→LH transfer 
of activity, while  = −0 corresponds to LH→RH.  
The schematic representation of NCCA is shown in 
Figure 1.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of NCCA.   
The system evolves by self-development (in Figure 1 ⎯ 
from the left to the right). The ground (zero) level is 
represented by two H-type processors (distributed memory) 
receiving the external information in the form of “raw” 
images (certain chains of excited neurons). Let us stress that 
the image plate H0 (so called “fuzzy set”) in RH does play key 
role in intuition and actions under the extreme conditions. 
Actually, it could be treated as an analogue to the human sub-
consciousness filled with personal subjective associations, 
thus presenting the source for nontrivial solutions. 
All other levels  = 1…N are presented by G-type 
processors carrying out the symbolic information, with each 
symbol concentrates (being a convolution) all the 
information of its image [11].   
The high-level symbols correspond to abstract concepts, 
which are not based on any raw image of real object (such as 
“science”, “problem”, etc.).  However, they do control all the 
“parent” symbols at lower levels and thus could control the 
activity of the whole system. According to neuro-
physiological studies, these very functions are character for 
the frontal lobes of human brain [8][9][24][25]. 
B. Imitation of the extreme mode (panic)     
Note that the system of equations (1) – (4) is not complete 
in math sense, since the variables (t) and Z(t) are not 
specified as yet. In [12][13], we argued that they are tightly 
connected with emotions. The last are considered as a product 
of interaction between cortical and subcortical structures 
[21][22], which influence mainly the random factor in RH. 
Let us recall briefly the math background of this concept:  
𝑑𝑍(𝑡)
𝑑𝑡
=
1
𝜏𝑍 [𝑎𝑍𝜇𝜇 + 𝑎𝑍𝑍𝑍 + 𝐹𝑍(𝜇, 𝑍) + (𝑍, 𝐻, 𝐺𝑘
𝜎)],       (7) 
𝑑𝜇
𝑑𝑡 =
1
𝜏𝜇 [𝑎𝜇𝜇𝜇 + 𝑎𝜇𝑍(𝑍 − 𝑍0) + 𝐹𝜇(𝜇, 𝑍)],           (8) 
𝛬(𝑡) = −𝛬0 ⋅ 𝑡ℎ (𝛾𝜏𝑍 ⋅
𝑑𝑍
𝑑𝑡). 
 
(9) 
Here, Z(t) is the amplitude of random (stochastic) 
component (noise) presented in RH only. The functional 
{Z,Hi,Gk} refers to the influence of variables Hi and Gi 
(associated with the neocortex structures). The value Z0 
represents “normal” value of Z(t) necessary for regular 
system functioning, Z corresponds to characteristic time of 
Z(t) variation.    
The variable (t) in (7), (8) corresponds to purely 
“emotional” component produced by subcortical structures; 
it represents the effective composition of neurotransmitters 
(the difference between stimulants and inhibitors);  being 
the characteristic time for (t) variation.   
The variable (t) that is stitching together the equations 
(1)—(4), refers to the cross-hemi-system connections (like 
corpus collosum in brain), which provide the collaboration of 
two hemi-systems. The parameters Z and  control the 
pattern of  (t) variation.   
In [14][15], it was shown that typical pattern of Z(t) 
behavior for recognition and prediction process represent 
dumping oscillations around normal value Z0 (see Figure 2a).   
Note that the prognosis represents a particular case of 
recognition problem (the recognition of the time-dependent 
process).   
 
Figure 2. Typical patterns of the noise amplitude Z(t) behavior in the cases 
of (a) recognition procedure; (b) incorrect prognosis with sense of humor 
manifestation, and (c) aesthetic emotions (“goosebumps”). 
Special case of incorrect prognosis, which activates the 
sense of humor has been discussed in [13][14]. It arises when 
the examinee process seems familiar up to some moment t*, 
but the next bulk of information appears to be once 
unexpected, but still well-known. This switches the 
recognition process to the other, also familiar pattern. It 
corresponds to the specific reaction of the system, that is, 
sharp up-down jump (“spike”) in the noise amplitude, which 
could be associated with human laughter (see Figure 2b).  
In [15], it was shown that perception of art calling for 
bright but unformulated emotions (the goosebumps) could be 
imitated by small trembling of Z(t) around Z0 (see Figure 2c).  
Note that two last examples represent in some sense a 
kind of stress behavior (“smooth stress”), which corresponds 
to somewhat extreme impressions.

In [14], the variation of Z(t) under external load was 
considered.  It was shown that extremely high load results in 
specific behavior: irregular high-amplitude oscillations of 
Z(t) with high probability result in the fall to the abnormal 
stationary state {Z*, *}, where Z* << Z0 and * << 0,  that 
corresponds to deep depression or coma. These results 
coincide qualitatively with conclusions of [10].  
Here, we put forward the following hypothesis. The panic 
mode could be imitated as follows. If the recognition process 
meets unexpected difficulties (without any external effect) 
while the problem should be solved urgently, Z(t) at the first 
stage increases (without oscillations) up to some critical 
value Z**>> Z0. High level of noise corresponds to super-
mobilization of all the resources including self-excitation of 
so called “sleeping” neurons (never involved into training 
process before). Thus, at this stage increasing Z(t) value 
(negative emotions, i.e., anxiety, worrying, nervousness, etc.) 
does play positive (constructive) role.  Then, this regime 
changes for chaotic “jumps” of Z(t) around Z** (see Figures 
3a, 3b) that could be treated as intellectual panic. Indeed, if 
Z(t) achieves the value Z** >> 0 (the rough value of “black” 
connections), then these connections seem to be broken and 
the noise dominates in RH. It results in chaotic self-activation 
of the neocortex neurons (variables H0 and GR) independently 
of any already learned patterns. This corresponds to “free 
wandering thoughts” discussed in Section II. The jumps in 
Z(t) correspond to the emotional (mood) jumps.  
 The decrease of Z(t) down to zero at some moment t** 
results in a deep long depression (see Figure 3b), which could 
be overcome only by external efforts (an analogue to medical 
intervention).   
 
Figure 3. Typical behavior of Z(t) under the “intellectual panic” in the 
case of (a) “aha moment” and (b) deep long depression. 
However, such mode should require significant amount of 
energy and thus, could not last long. It could stop either by 
sharp drop in Z(t) down to normal value Z0, i.e., the peak of 
positive emotions (aha! moment, or eureka!) if rather “good” 
solution was found (Figure 3a), or by certain external (an 
analogue to drug) effect. Otherwise it could lead to deep 
depression as in Figure 3b.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK   
Within NCCA, emotions are associated with the noise 
amplitude Z(t) derivative dZ/dt: increasing Z(t) (dZ/dt>0) 
corresponds to negative emotions (anxiety, worrying), while 
decreasing Z(t) (dZ/dt<0) corresponds to positive ones 
(satisfaction, relax). Note that negative emotions in normal 
cognitive process (such as recognition, prognosis, decision 
making, etc.) do play positive role increasing the activity in 
RH for generating several hypotheses on the given problem 
solution. Here, positive emotions also play positive role 
activating LH for hypothesis testing.    
It is shown that under certain extreme conditions (such as 
the necessity of urgent solving any complex cognitive 
intellectual problem), normal functioning mode could be 
replaced by the extreme one. In this mode, increasing Z(t) up 
to some critical value Z** actually plays positive role 
resulting in mobilization of the latent resources (self-
excitation of “sleeping” neurons in RH). Further increasing 
Z(t) up to values Z(t) >> Z** results in chaotic activation of 
neurons in RH, which provokes chaotic “jumps” of the noise 
amplitude Z(t). This behavior could imitate the effect of 
intellectual panic, or “throes of creativity”.  
In this paper, we have not considered possible effects 
connected with ratio of characteristic times Z and  for 
variation of noise amplitude and connection training, 
respectively. This ratio should control the process of creation 
of new connections between the sleeping neurons in the 
“fuzzy set” H0 thus resulting in new nontrivial images and 
solutions.  
Also, we have not considered here the behavior of the 
neurotransmitter composition (t) at the panic stage. 
Apparently, this component should also demonstrate certain 
chaotic behavior, but with some time shift with regard to the 
noise amplitude Z(t). This dynamical process deserves 
special study.  
Moreover, variation of ratio of parameters 0, Z0, 0, and 
Z** could lead to interesting effects and deserve additional 
study. In normal cognitive mode, these parameters are to be 
similar by the order of magnitude: 0  0   0. Deviations 
from this ratio could result in some specific regimes as, e.g., 
“mental rigidity” [9] (poor dialog between hemi-systems) at  
0 <<  0, or “low creativity” [24] at Z0 << 0  0, etc. Оf 
course, all these effects require special study.  
In addition, various combinations of parameters Z0, Z and 
0,   could serve to reproduce the well-known Hippocrates 
classification of human temperaments (choleric, sanguine, 
melancholic, phlegmatic) and to reveal the correlation 
between the temperament and a tendency to a certain mode 
of panic behavior. But this is the subject for special study.   
It should be noted that all typical patterns of Z(t) behavior 
discussed here represent the results of theoretical simulations. 
Apparently, clinical verification is needed. Now, we plan 
certain collaboration with Dr. Dibsburry from PsychPress 
(Talent Management Psychology, Melburn, Australia) and 
Prof. Bykov from Irkutsk State Medical University (Russia) 
to verify our hypothesis by tests and questionnairs. Possible 
collaboration with Kurchatov Research Center (Russia) on 
fMRI study of the people in panic state is also considered. 
However, all these problems require further work.
