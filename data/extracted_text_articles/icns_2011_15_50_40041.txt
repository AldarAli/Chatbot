of the Networking Academy platform, for an improved student 
learning experience and better student retention rates. 
Keywords: learning platform; productivity; student experience; 
management; retention; online; satisfaction.   
I. 
INTRODUCTION  
The Credis Academy has been part of the Netacad 
Program for 12 years starting with 1999 as a local academy, 
and also becoming a regional academy starting in the year 
2000.  Managing more than 11 geographically dispersed 
local academies as well as offering Cisco‟s entire curricula to 
more than 2500 students only with the help of the NetAcad 
site had become a time consuming activity that needed to be 
re-engineered.  
We started the process in 2006, developing in-house a 
course delivery platform coupled with an Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) system [1], which is currently in 
use to manage over 2500 students spread over the entire 
country. 
Our course delivery platform and ERP is currently 
integrated with NetAcad, NetLab, Webex, Google Apps, 
Project Management tools and social services like Twitter 
and Facebook.  
This paper presents the solutions adopted in order to be 
able to scale up while maintaining a high degree of student 
satisfaction and achieving our motto: „best learning 
experience”.  
The paper starts by justifying the need of the platform 
and then presents the three main parts of it. After that we 
have presented the achieved results and some of the future 
developments of the platform. 
II. 
REASONS FOR AN ADDITIONAL PLATFORM  
The official NetAcad website is the command center for 
the daily management activities of Cisco academies. This 
system is used to coordinate student activities and part of the 
instructor activities. However, the site does not seem to have 
been designed to manage a large number of returning 
students. We believe that is the reason why we encountered 
increasing difficulties dealing with the following issues:  
 
It is impossible to know the class history for a 
particular student, 
 
It is impossible to send custom e-mails to all 
students in one particular class, 
 
There is no scheduling/viewing system for practical 
hand-on activities, 
 
There is no tracking system for student‟s progress 
through practical activities, 
 
The user enrollment process is relatively difficult 
(manually/by username), 
 
It is difficult to contact students, which have no 
public profile. 
Working with thousands of students has prompted us to 
implement a management system that would enable to 
overcome these problems. As a result, we designed and 
implemented our own online learning platform for the Cisco 
academy, to be used in conjunction with the NetAcad 
website. With the years this platform has become the central 
point of command for the entire academy, accommodating 
additional educational programs, like the Microsoft IT 
Academy, Adobe Training Center, Linux Professional 
Institute and Cisco Entrepreneur Institute.  
Our learning platform is divided in three views: student 
experience, instructor experience and finance module. The 
student experience module is an implementation of our 
vision of fully flexible student services in the learning 
process. The instructor experience module is designed like 
an ERP, aiming to ease the work of academy instructors and 
administrative staff.  
All the financial aspects of running the academy are 
integrated within the platform, in order to increase the 
productivity of the employees while considerably reducing 
the time a student needs for administrative purposes 
(registration details, accounts, invoices, etc.).  
The platform is well integrated with the academy‟s 
public website, Facebook and Twitter accounts, giving us the 
opportunity to easily communicate with our student 
community.  
III. 
STUDENT EXPERIENCE MODULE 
The student experience module is a GUI with a left-hand 
side main menu and a content area, which is, in turn, divided 
into two tabs: general news and personal relevant 
information (Figure 1).

A. Main Menu 
The left-hand side main menu gives students access to 
the following options: 
 
 
Course materials (“Curriculum” tab): access the 
course materials online, 
 
Student profile – update current contact information, 
 
Discussion forum- discuss with instructors and 
peers, 
 
Activity report– this is an area where students can 
see their own learning history throughout their entire 
period as students of our academy. The history 
shows courses taken, class dates and instructor 
contacts for each course. 
 
Legal agreement– every student must agree with the 
legal agreement setting on NetAcad as well as 
Credis policies on course completion, attendance, 
etc. The document clearly states out the rights and 
obligations of both student and academy.  
 
Support– this link gives students access to an online 
ticketing 
system. 
Student‟s 
requirements 
and 
complaints are registered and sent to the helpdesk. If 
the problem exceeds the helpdesk attributions, 
instructors and then the manager are contacted. 
During this period, students are constantly given 
feedback on the status of their tickets. 
 
Social networks tab– this tab allows students to 
follow the academy on social networks like 
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. We also send out 
newsletters and an RSS feed. 
 
Netacad login– this area allows the student to beam 
directly to the Netacad website, upon password 
confirmation.  
B. General News Area 
The general news area is centrally located in the upper 
part of the browser content window. This area contains all 
the news regarding the academy‟s activity, including job 
offers, internship offers, new courses, sweepstakes, events, 
etc.  
C. Personal Information 
The personal information area displays information 
relevant to each student given their own learning context: all 
the classes that one is registered for, name and contact data 
for the corresponding instructor, etc. 
Students can see the course‟s instructor led activities and 
their scheduling, can make reservations for such activities, 
and can access deeper information of such activities, 
including lab topics or lab prerequisites. 
Every class has an associated study plan, class rules, 
additional learning materials and certification information. 
All courses are displayed as part of a career path graph. 
D. Certification Area 
In the certification area students have access to 
information regarding the possible certifications that the 
course opens the way to and are shown a certification path 
that helps them better understand and manage their learning 
process in relation to their goals.   
 
IV. 
INSTRUCTOR EXPERIENCE MODULE 
The instructor experience on our learning platform is, 
obviously, different from the students. Instructors‟ main 
menu contains the following tabs: 
 
Instructor  home (Figure 2),  
 
Instructor  profile,  
 
Study materials, 
 
Classes,  
 
Accounts,  
 
Activities,  
 
Online courses,  
 
Feedback,  
 
Forum,  
 
Legal agreement,  
 
Inventory,  
We will only concentrate our presentation on the 
academic aspects: the instructor experience module is a 
result of our need to also manage a large number of 
instructors that are geographically dispersed (we currently 
have over 80 instructors around the country), while keeping 
the highest level of quality possible, both in order to comply 
with Cisco‟s Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) and to keep our 
good name with students. 
In effect, the instructor experience module acts as an 
academic Customer Relationship Management (CRM) [2] 
system, giving academy staff the tools to manage students 
and their learning process.  
Instructors and academy staff also have access to their 
own profiles just as students do, in order to update contact 
data, review their legal agreements (different than the ones 
signed by students), etc. 
The news area and the NetAcad login are also available 
in the instructor experience module.  
A. Scheduling Area 
The main difference in the schedule area comes from the 
possibility of instructors to schedule new activities. When 
accessing this area, instructors see the entire schedule of 
activities grouped by location, classrooms, instructors and 
subjects. This way, any instructor scheduling new activities 
can only announce a lab in a free time slot.  
Instructors schedule lab activities for a long time in 
advance, in order to book classroom timeslots, but have an 
option not to publish these activities to students. In this 
respect, the tool is used for classroom provisioning. 
Only at the time of publishing of such a lab activity to the 
student experience module, do students receive emails 
asking them to register and confirm their participation.  
Another use of this tool is to give management a good 
overview of the activities in the academy and the physical 
presence of instructors in the office.

B. Study  Materials Area 
The study materials area is used to give students access 
to a local copy of the curricula. We do that because we can 
increase the speed of access to the curricula like that. 
In addition to the official curricula, instructors have the 
opportunity to publish materials that are relevant to the 
course in general or just to a particular class, thus 
customizing students‟ learning experience (Figure 3).  
Also in this area, Cisco Press books [3] are recommended 
for further study. Starting with 2010, we have a partnership 
with Pearson Education Reseller for Romania and we are 
offering our students the opportunity to buy Cisco Press 
books with a discount to market price. 
We believe that blending the Cisco Press titles with the 
learning materials increases the value of our learning 
proposition to our students. 
V. 
FINANCIAL MODULE 
The financial module is only available to academy staff 
and acts as a back-end of the application. This area uses the 
same database with the front-end (student and instructor 
experience modules), allowing for invoices to be easily and 
quickly issued to students, for tracking of students‟ financial 
status, to calculate instructor‟s wages based on a revenue 
sharing scheme, etc.  
We are the academy with one of the largest number of 
instructors worldwide. These instructors are geographically 
spread across the entire country. We offer them the entire 
infrastructure to be able to offer Cisco curricula to their 
students. As a result, we use a revenue sharing model with 
most of our instructors and we use the financial area of the 
application to automatically calculate obligations, to generate 
all accounting and legal documents needed and to keep 
records of our activity. 
We run a cash flow management system, where we 
record all our activity in our system, in order to be able to 
quickly have reports, find out the financial standing of the 
academy, the results of promotional campaigns, and 
numerous other data-analyses. 
VI. 
RESULTS ACHIEVIED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF  
THIS PLATFORM 
With the constant development of our learning platform 
we have achieved several important improvements of our 
activities: 
A. Improved  student experience 
The philosophy behind eLearning and the NetAcad 
curricula is that students should be able to learn anytime, 
anywhere, at any pace. This flexibility was not possible with 
the practical, hands-on lab activities. We have taken one step 
forward with the implementation of the scheduling system. 
Instructors schedule labs repeatedly, at different hours 
and in different days, including weekends. With this 
approach, students are given a wide choice of options for 
their participation in the mandatory lab activities, being able 
to manage their learning schedule according to their needs. 
Furthermore, at the end of each lab, instructors confirm 
the actual presence of the registered students. This way, we 
can easily track student participation and performance in the 
practical activities. 
We can demonstrate a relatively high degree of customer 
retention, with one third of students in each year being 
“returning” students (that is students that have been our 
students in the previous year too).

Retention Rate is calculated as the number of Returning students  
divided by the Total number of Students per each year. 
We also believe that the improved user experience has 
translated into higher number of students registering for 
continuation of their studies. There is drop off rate between 
CCNA 1 and 4, with numbers constantly decreasing with 
each new course, but we also can show increasing numbers 
and percentages in this area:

B. Improved student management 
By duplicating the classes in the NetAcad website in our 
own platform and database we are now able to easily and 
automatically extract any kind of information about student 
participation and involvement in the program. 
For example, during 2010 we have had a number of over 
6000 activities scheduled. For these activities we have clear 
information about students that have registered and students 
that have actually attended. This is useful to generate track 
reports of students in their interaction with the academy. This 
feat is impossible to achieve with the NetAcad site. 
At any time during a course we can tell how the activities 
are progressing, the attendance rates, etc. This allows us to 
keep track of all the numerous instructors spread throughout 
the country and be able to ensure quality in the learning 
process. 
Using the NetAcad site we were not able to register 
students into classes, but the other way around. We had to 
create a class and then search for the students that we needed 
to register in that particular class. With growing numbers of 
students, this operation became cumbersome and time 
consuming. In the present, we can select students and enroll 
them in whatever class they have required, automatically 
sending the full-HTML emails with relevant information. 
C. Improved  Financial Management 
With the integration of the financial module, the time 
students spent dealing with the front-desk has significantly 
322

decreased. In the present, we easily know the entire student 
history both from an academic view point and from the 
financial one. 
Furthermore, classes are treated as projects in the 
financial module, allowing us to easily create all the reports 
and legal documents that support our revenue sharing model 
with the instructors.  
D. Improved  Reporting 
Using our own database allows us to easily create any 
number of statistics that we need, empowering us with the 
tools for data analysis.  
Using our own database we were able to create a map of 
the city of Bucharest related to the geographical distribution 
of our students, allowing us to identify the areas of the city 
where we need to increase our marketing efforts. 
Another good example of useful reports is the “customer 
loyalty report”, which has shown us the students that have 
followed the most courses with our academy, and we were 
able to recognize their participation, thank them for their 
trust, and invite them to become ambassadors of our 
academy. Getting feedback from the persons that know us 
most is a very important achievement.  
VII. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLATFORM 
At the time of writing of this paper we are working on 
integrating new social web technologies in our platform. We 
want to implement the OpenID [4] standard to allow students 
to register for classes using their social network or web 
accounts (Facebook, Google, Yahoo or any OpenID 
provider) in order to ease students‟ interaction with our 
platform. 
We are also testing different wiki solutions in order to 
implement a collaborative knowledge base that would add 
value both to our students and to our instructor all over the 
country. 
We intend to take one additional step in the blending of 
Cisco Press books with the study materials. In the present, 
we are showing relevant Cisco Press titles in the study 
materials area. Students are directed to the website pages 
describing the book and they can place orders. 
However this is not an actual online shop, but only an 
online order placement system. We intend to fully integrate 
an 
online 
book 
shop 
on 
our 
platform.
 
In this respect, we are  close to finishing the process of 
adding the possibility for students to register and pay online 
for our courses, in a desire to constantly keep improving our 
overall offer, aiming to provide a fully satisfactory learning 
experience. 
VIII. CONCLUSIONS 
Although this is an academic and not-for profit 
environment we found that our processes need to be 
designed the business way. That is why we have developed 
business specific tools and have customized them for our 
academic activity.  
Direct results are a significant improvement of work 
relationships, due to the fact that everyone's responsibilities 
are clearly defined together with the expectations for each 
employee.  
Furthermore, productivity tools enable us and our 
instructors to concentrate on increasing the quality of our 
students' learning experience in order to obtain even higher 
degrees of student satisfaction, retention and graduation as a 
direct measure of teaching/learning success.  
We aim that our students will speak about the Credis 
learning experience as the „best learning experience‟ ,which 
is why we need to be constantly developing and testing new 
ideas and technologies, especially more collaborative ones 
using Web 2.0 tools like Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and 
wiki‟s.
