Abstract— Operations Research classes are held focusing on 
practice. Following the textbook, slides are shown, there are 
lectures on problems and their formularization and solutions 
are explained using examples. After classes, as practice, a sheet 
with blank boxes for answers to similar problems in the same 
format as the examples was distributed and students were 
asked to complete it. The next week, after giving the answers to 
the practice problems, a sheet with problems similar to 
examples and practice was distributed as a challenge in the 
same format as practice problems and students were asked to 
complete it. E-learning that makes it possible to study with 
lecture slides and to browse answers to practice problems was 
provided for lesson preparation and revision in and outside of 
classes. At the beginning and the end of the course, students 
were questioned about their level of term recognition and 
awareness in the classes. This study analyses this information 
and reports on changes in level of term recognition and 
awareness.

 INTRODUCTION  
In Operations Research (OR) classes as one type of 
information science lectures, we believed that the contents of 
classes would not be well understood with only explanations 
of and solutions to problems. Therefore, we incorporated 
practice into these classes. The contents of the textbook were 
explained. During practice, worksheets that made it possible 
to practice by filling in the blanks were distributed. As a 
result, almost all students did the practice sheets and handed 
them in. For the practice portions of all chapters, the 
calculation method was explained so that it was possible for 
students to obtain solutions if they filled in the appropriate 
figures in each box of the calculation formula. It was made 
clear to students that if they had a calculator, they would be 
able to solve OR problems themselves. This method was 
adopted with the expectation of understanding the nature of 
OR and fostering people who can solve problems that they 
come up against in society through the experience of solving 
problems. The contents of these lectures have been made 
into an Operations Research textbook [1].  
 Following the textbook, slides are shown, there are 
lectures on problems and their formularization, and solutions 
are explained using examples in these classes. After these 
classes, a sheet with blank boxes for answers to similar 
problems in the same format as the examples was distributed 
and students were asked to complete it as practice. After 
giving the answers to the practice problems at the next week, 
a sheet with problems similar to examples and practice was 
distributed in the same format as practice and students were 
asked to complete it. In this way, OR classes were conducted 
focusing on practice [2]. 
How to learn is different for each student. A perfect 
media for all students does not exist. It is possible to support 
many and various student learning styles and to deepen 
understanding by using more than one media [3][4]. The use 
of e-learning, which cooperates with and expands the class, 
in the classroom is a useful means to improve the traditional 
class [5][6]. Reading class content on the web increases 
opportunities to review and prepare. It is tied with settlement 
of the contents to learn many times until a learner is 
convinced. Even if a learner is absent from a class, the class 
content can be reviewed at his/her convenience. 
Approximately 80% of classes using e-learning in 
Japanese higher education are blended learning [7]. In Japan, 
the number of blended classes coordinating lectures and e-
learning is particularly high. These are producing effects on 
studying through reciprocal complementation of lectures and 
e-learning [8]. There are expectations for this type of blended 
classes [9]. The authors have been implementing blended 
learning for the past ten years or so and have produced good 
results [10]. The authors are implementing blended classes 
for an introduction to computers. We can report that there 
were positive results from the development of classes with 
integrated media such as organized lecture notes, e-learning 
and short tests. In addition, we reported that it was possible 
to even further boost effects due to an increase in interaction 
with teachers through a questionnaire about the level of 
understanding [11]. The results of a comparison of the use of 
e-learning in and outside of classes showed that almost the 
same effects could be obtained with both methods [12][13].  
The structure of the classes can be roughly divided into 
lecture, practice and experiment. Blended classes for which 
we have made reports up until now have been lecture-type 
classes. Accordingly, in Operations Research classes that are 
practice-type, in order to produce results by implementing 
blended classes, preparing e-learning that makes it possible 
to study with the lecture slides and to browse answers to 
practice problems made it possible to use e-learning in lesson 
preparation and revision in and outside of classes.

 This paper sets out to discover the effects of blended 
practice-type 
classes, 
by 
analyzing 
the 
answer 
to 
questionnaire survey about their level of recognition of terms 
used in the classes and awareness at the beginning and end of 
the course. This paper explains class contents and methods, 
analyses the information obtained from questionnaires, and 
reports on changes in level of recognition of terms and 
awareness. 
 
II. 
CLASS DESIGN AND CONTENTS 
Class contents are shown in TABLE I. The textbook 
[1] is composed of 14 chapters with representative OR 
techniques and in classes, the 7 problems shown in TABLE 
I from these 14 chapters were taken up. The target was an 
elective course for the latter period of the 3rd year of 
university information studies. There were 20 students in 
the 2012 class. There were a total of 15 classes of 90 
minutes each. 
The textbook is composed of goals, definitions of 
problems, solutions to problems, practice and challenges for 
each technique. It was assumed that they would be used in 
lectures, but at the beginning of each chapter, the goal was 
explained so that they could also be used in practice and 
experiments. Next, the problems in the chapter were 
explained and defined so that the students understood the 
content. Actual examples were used and there were no 
omissions, giving a detailed explanation of techniques and 
methods or the solution to the problem. After this, practice 
problem sheets were distributed and practice in actually 
calculating and solving problems similar to the examples 
was conducted. These problems can be solved with either a 
calculator or a pen and paper. At this time, the practice 
problems sheet is prepared with the required tables and text 
and is in a framework in which the problem can be solved 
by filling in figures and results in the blanks. Furthermore, 
two challenges are also in the textbook to offer an 
opportunity for practice for those who wish to further 
cultivate their understanding. This is a feature that does not 
exist in similar books.  
If the problems could not be completed within the time 
limit, students were instructed to finish and hand it in by the 
next week. The answers to practice questions were 
explained the following week. One of the ways of using 
these challenges is to distribute challenge sheets with the 
same format as for practice and have the students solve 
them. Students were made to hand these practice and 
challenge sheets in as many times as it took until they got 
the correct answers. Furthermore, final exams were 
implemented. In any case, understanding of each technique 
is improved by repeatedly solving three types of problems: 
the example problem that shows the solution method, the 
practice problem and the challenge. 
From the actual experience [2] of giving lectures, the 
explanation of goals, problem definition and problem 
solution took between 15 and 40 minutes so it was possible 
to use between 35 and 60 minutes for practice, ensuring 
plenty of time. Lectures, practice and challenges for one 
chapter were completed every two weeks.  
 At the beginning of the class, the answers to the previous 
week’s practice are given. Then, after explaining the goal 
of that day’s problem technique, the formulization and 
method for solving the problem are explained. Lecture 
contents are explained through slides projected on the 
screen. After that, a practice sheet with blanks is distributed 
in order to implement practice for the chapter that has been 
explained. Then the students are asked to solve the problems. 
When the problems are solved, the students hand them in. 
A. Class Goals and Aims 
OR is a mathematical model for decision-making. Many 
mathematical models are proposed. The goal of this class is 
to explain these techniques, to actually practice these 
techniques after the lecture, to cultivate understanding and to 
be useful in problem solving in society. In addition, through 
various activities in these lectures, the ability to think and 
solve problems is cultivated.

The aims of this class are to understand the selected 
mathematical models in OR and the algorithms of these 
techniques so that students can solve the problems according 
to these algorithms. 
B. Class Design 
Explanations were given based on the class planning and 
design in TABLE I. In the first week, class plan explanations 
were distributed and class planning was explained. After that, 
an initial survey of term recognition and awareness was 
conducted. Based on the textbook, the goals, problem 
definition and solution method for the example were 
explained for Chapter 4 Transportation. Next, practice sheets 
were distributed and students were asked to solve the 
practice problems referring to the explanation of the solution 
method for the example. At that time, students were given 
advice to browse the e-learning lecture slides and refer to 
them. During practice, the teacher went around the 
classroom and accepted a question. Students were observed 
helping each other. Those who came up with the answers 
were asked to submit their practice sheets. Those who didn’t 
come up with the answers were asked to bring their 
completed practice sheets to the professor’s office before the 
next class. 
The next week, the answers to the practice problems 
were given. After that, sheets were handed back to those 
who had made mistakes in the answers or the calculations. 
Next, challenge sheets were distributed and students were 
asked to solve the problems. At that time, the students were 
advised to browse the e-learning lecture slides and refer to 
them. Those who came up with the answers were asked to 
submit their challenge sheets. Those who didn’t come up 
with the answers were asked to bring their completed 
challenge sheets to the professor’s office before the next 
class.  
In the 3rd week, the goals, problem definition and 
solution method for the example were explained for Chapter 
5 Allocation. Next, the students were asked to solve practice 
problems in the same way as for Chapter 4 and submit them. 
In the 4th week, the students were asked to solve challenge 
problems in the same way as for Chapter 5 and submit them. 
In this way, the class got through one chapter every 2 weeks. 
The submission of practice and challenge problems was 
repeated until the answer was correct. If a problem sheet was 
to be given back, mistakes on the sheet were marked with a 
colored pencil. There were some students who took a long 
time to get the right answers even though they were able to 
browse e-learning documents after the answers were 
explained in class. In the end, 7 practice and challenge 
problems were completed in 15 weeks. Post surveys of term 
recognition and awareness were taken in the 15th week.  
 Students were asked to fill in the goals, problem 
definition and discussion for each chapter after downloading 
framework files and were asked to submit these two reports 
in the 8th and the 14th weeks. 
C. Contents of E-learning 
To intensify the effect of this lecture and to enable the 
students to make a peer assessment, e-learning functions 
were added as follows: (1) learning with 254 lecture slides; 
(2) learning with downloadable documents and templates of 
seven kinds; (3) submitting and uploading exercises of seven 
kinds; (4) uploading opinions to a bulletin board and 
browsing them; and (5) sending question mail. 
 
III. 
ANALYSIS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
For this paper, in order to understand the level of 
understanding of terms that came up in class contents, term 
recognition surveys were conducted before and after the 
course. By conducting study activities related to the classes, 
an awareness study related to ability was implemented 
before and after the course in order to understand the 
changes in awareness related to ability. In order to 
understand which activities are useful in improving this 
awareness, students were asked to fill in activities that help 
to improve awareness in the right-hand column beside the 
awareness evaluation number in the post-project awareness 
survey.                           
Below, we state that significant differences were 
observed in the significance testing with a significance level 
of 5%. The symbols m, SD, F, t and p refer to mean, 
standard deviation, F value, t value for test statistics and 
probability respectively. The results of the tests show that 
symbols ***, ** and * are significant with significance 
levels of 0.1, 1 and 5% respectively. The + symbol shows 
the significance trend with a significance level of 10%. 
A. Changes in Term Recognition 
In order to find out whether students have understood the 
OR related terms that came up in class lectures, the term 
recognition level survey method [14] developed by 
Nakamura et al. was used. The 33 terms listed in TABLE II 
were surveyed twice for recognition (R) before (April) and 
after (July) the course (N=19). 19 people gave valid 
responses to this survey. Evaluations were made on three 
levels of recognition: 3. I understand it, 2. I don’t fully 
understand it but I have heard of it, and 1. I don’t understand 
it. H-check terms for which there is a high likelihood of 
respondents understanding them were: PC, queue and 
network and an L-check term for which there is a low 
likelihood of respondents understanding it was: simulation. 
These 4 terms were expected and set to be terms that did not 
change throughout the class.  
Results of paired significance tests for recognition of the 
above-mentioned terms are shown in TABLE II. The results 
of pre- and post- paired significance tests for the 
development of average recognition of the 33 terms showed 
a significant difference with a significance level of 0.1%. It 
was observed that post-course recognition was higher. 
The results of a paired significance tests for average 
growth of recognition of each term before and after the 
course showed a significance level of 0.1% for 22 terms, a 
significance level of 1% for 6 terms and a significance level 
of 5% for 1 term. This means that recognition levels for 
these 29 terms had risen after the course. However, through 
the significance test, 4 terms were observed not to have 
significant differences. These were all the check terms. PC,

queue and network were H-check terms. These had high 
recognition of R=3.0, R=2.6 and R=2.5 before the course 
and of R=3.0, R=2.8 and R=2.7 after the course respectively 
with almost no change. It is for this reason that these terms, 
having had high recognition from the beginning, did not 
change much due to the classes. In addition, the L-check 
term ‘simulation’ was not explained in the classes and the 
pre-course survey showed low recognition of R=2.1 whereas 
the post-course survey showed a value of R=2.4 with almost 
no change. In this way, the 4 check terms that were set to 
show the validity of the survey were stable and there was no 
significant difference in the significance test. This can be 
considered to show the validity of the survey. Due to this 
fact, it can be said that understanding of the 29 terms that 
appeared in relation to class contents was improved. 
B. Changes in Evaluation Values of Awareness related to 
Ability 
The 35 categories listed in TABLE III were surveyed 
twice for awareness before (April) and after (July) the 
course. There were 9 evaluation values: 1. Not at all, 3. 
Slight, 5. A little, 7. Fairly and 9. Extremely. 19 people 
responded to this before and after the course.

Average pre- and post-course evaluation values for all 
35 categories were 4.2 and 5.1 respectively. Results of 
paired t-tests for pre- and post-evaluation values are shown 
at the bottom of TABLE III. Significant differences in pre- 
and post-course values were observed in all 35 categories. It 
was discovered that awareness related to ability had 
improved as a whole after the course.  
The results of t-tests for pre- and post-evaluation values 
for each category of awareness related to ability are shown 
in TABLE III. The 20 categories of (2), (6), (7), (14)-(17), 
(20), (22)-(28) and (31)-(35) were observed to have 
significant differences. There were no significant difference 
trends for the 4 categories of (4), (8), (21) and (29). 
Therefore, it was discovered that awareness evaluation 
values were improved for these. 
One of the goals of the lectures was to cultivate the 
ability to think and to solve problems through various 
activities. It can be said that evaluation values for evaluation 
categories (26) Ability to solve problems and (28) Ability to 
think which are related to this were improved. 
It was discovered that all evaluation values for categories 
(31) to (35) related to knowledge of Operations Research 
improved. It is thought that by solving 3 problems in each 
chapter: example, practice and challenge, knowledge about 
OR and decision-making methods, expressing social 
phenomena in mathematical models, knowledge about 
algorithms to solve the mathematical models, and volition to 
solve social phenomena are increased. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
After a detailed explanation of the example solution, 
practice problem sheets with a framework for filling in the 
blanks with numerical values and results are distributed and 
practice is conducted. Challenges are conducted after 
explanation of the solution the following week. The effects 
of the class method focusing on practice were reported. The 
most frequent activities that helped with development were: 
listening to the lecture and the explanation of answers, 
preparation for and revision of lessons, and asking questions, 
etc. The following was discovered through an analysis of 
educational information that was gained from this class. 
(1) Term recognition improved overall after the course. All 
29 terms, not including the check terms, had improved after 
the course. 
(2) Awareness related to ability improved overall after the 
course. The 20 awareness categories out of the total 35 
categories improved after the course. In particular, the 5 
categories for awareness related to OR class contents all 
improved. 
Students submitted practice problem and challenge 
problem sheets several times until they got the answers right. 
We would like to study the effects of this in the future. In 
addition, we would like to be more inventive with the 
practice methods and research the role of media in further 
improving effects.
