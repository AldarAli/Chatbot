Abstract — AD5933 IC is a high precision impedance converter 
system. In this article, it is used for detection of an atmospheric 
icing event and to determine atmospheric ice type. A prototype 
circuit is developed and is tested using a microcontroller 
AtMega128 clock excitation frequency from 40Hz to 20kHz. The 
IC is calibrated using a 100k resistor. The real and imaginary 
components of discrete fourier transform are recorded in order 
calculate the gain factor at each frequency increment. The 
unknown impedances are then calculated which are then 
utilized to calculate the complex dielectric constant of 
atmospheric ice at each frequency. The results are then 
compared with the experimental results of Stiles, Evans and 
Kuroiwa in order to detect an icing event and to determine its 
type. Results reflect that it is possible to use this approach for 
detection of an icing event, however it is difficult to determine 
icing type using this approach.

INTRODUCTION 
The aim of this article is to evaluate the usage of AD5933 
Integrated Circuit (IC) to detect an atmospheric icing event 
and determine ice type. Using a pre-defined frequency range, 
this IC measure the real and imaginary components of 
discrete fourier transform of the load impedance. These 
components are recorded in order to calculate the gain factor 
at each frequency which is then utilized to determine the 
unknown impedances. In this experimental investigation, the 
load impedance is atmospheric ice. The calculated load 
impedances are utilized, to calculate capacitance of 
atmospheric ice at each excitation frequency. This 
capacitance measurement technique was highlighted in state 
of the art review by Mughal et. al. [1] and Homola et. al. [2], 
to be one of the many possible measurement techniques to 
detect atmospheric icing event, icing type and icing rate.  
This article is divided in five sections. Section I is an 
introduction. Section II is the state of the art, which is further 
divided in three sections in order to understand atmospheric 
ice capacitance measurement technique using frequency 
sweep approach and application/construction of AD5933 IC. 
Section III is about the approach and architecture of the circuit 
developed to measure capacitance of atmospheric ice. Section 
IV describes the experimental results and discussions. Section 
V is the last section which includes conclusions and 
limitations to use this IC.

STATE OF THE ART 
A. Capacitance Measurement Using Frequency Sweep: 
Capacitive ice sensors generate an electric field to detect 
the presence of dielectric materials. An electric field radiates 
outward around the probe and a dielectric material in close 
proximity of the field affects the measured capacitance. 
Capacitance 𝐶 = C0ε0εr can be measured by the variation in 
relative permittivity or dielectric constant ‘εr ’ or by the 
variation in electrode geometry ‘C0’. Where C0 = A/d where 
A is the area of the electrode and d is the distance between the 
electrodes, ε0  is the permittivity of vacuum equal to 
8.85x1012𝐹/𝑚                                                
Water molecule is polar in nature due to electronegativity 
difference of 1.2 between hydrogen and oxygen. These polar 
molecules orient themselves with the electrical field. 
However, when the electrical field is removed they disorient 
themselves. Under the influence of electric field, polar 
molecule behave like a parallel combination of capacitor and 
resistor. The dielectric constant of these molecules 𝜀𝑟(𝜔) =
𝜀𝑟
′(𝜔) − 𝑗𝜀𝑟
′′(𝜔) is a complex number, which is dependent 
upon the excitation frequency. Here 𝜀𝑟
′ represents the amount 
of energy from the electric field, which is stored in the 
material and 𝜀𝑟
′′ represents how lossy or dissipative a material 
is to the external electric field. This loss factor 
𝜀𝑟
′′(𝜔) includes the effects of both dissipation and 
conductivity. Also, the relative loss of the material is the ratio 
of energy lost to the energy stored and is defined as 
‘dissipation factor 𝐷 = 𝑡𝑎𝑛 𝛿 = 𝜀𝑟
′′ 𝜀𝑟
⁄ ′
. Polar materials 
generally have many dielectric mechanisms (atomic, 
electronic and dipolar) in different frequency domains 
associated with a cutoff frequency in each domain, which 
appears as a peak in 𝜀𝑟
′′ = 𝜀𝑟
′′(𝜔)  (likewise 𝐷 = 𝐷(𝜔) ) 
curve. The dipolar orientation is generally associated with the 
relaxation phenomenon, whereas the electronic and atomic 
polarization are associated with the resonance phenomenon. 
In the frequency domain analysis, the relaxation frequency 
‘𝑓𝑐’ is indicative of the relaxation time, 𝜏0 = 1 2𝜋𝑓𝑐
⁄
. This 
frequency can be detected by a peak by sweeping the 
excitation frequency and is generally unique for different 
materials. If we replace 𝜀(𝜔 → 0) = 𝜀𝑠  and 𝜀(𝜔 → ∞) =
𝜀∞, then by varying excitation frequencies, the dielectric 
constant of polar material can be analytically described by 
Debye relation, see (1) and Figure 1.

B. Dielectric Constant of Atmospheric Ice  
Figure 1a shows the dielectric constant variations of a 
sample of pure ice at two different temperatures (−80𝐶 and 
−150𝐶 ). Both curves of εr
′(ω)  and εr
′′(ω)  are shifting 
towards left as temperature was decreasing. The relaxation 
frequency ‘fc’ was in the range of  1 → 10kHz where the 
value of εr
′′(ω) is in the range of 40 → 50. Also, Figure 1b 
shows the dielectric constant variations of three distinct 
samples of snow with density ratios 𝜌= 0.095, 0.132 and 
0.254. Both curves of εr
′(ω) and εr
′′(ω) are increasing in 
magnitude as the desity ratio’s are increasing. The low 
frequency deviation of these curves from the ideal semi circle 
behavior (in Argand Diagram) is due to the conductivity of 
snow, which is increasing with increasing density ratio’s. 
However, the relaxation frequency ‘fc’ was not quite distinct 
but it lie in the range of  10 → 100kHz where the value of 
εr
′′(ω) are under 4 for all density ratio’s. The application of 
the electrical properties to the measurement of ice thickness, 
temperature, crystal orientations are also presented in Evans 
[4]. It is mentioned in Sihvola et. al. [5] that for dry snow, the 
dielectric constant is determined by the density and for wet 
snow, the imaginary part and the increase of the real part due 
to liquid water have the same volumetric wetness 
dependence. In Sihvola et. al. [5], the results indicate that the 
complex dielectric constant is practically independent of the 
structure of snow. The static dielectric constants rs of both 
polycrystalline and single crystals of ice have been carefully 
determined, Auty and Cole [6].  
Furthermore, Weinstein [7] and Jarvinen [8] proposed 
two different capacitive based ice detection methods. In his 
patent [8], Jarvenin has proposed the use of AD5933 to detect 
icing event, icing type, ice thickness and icing rate, however 
no commercially available sensor is found to utilize this 
technique for measurement of atmospheric icing parameters. 
C. AD5933 IC and its usage 
AD5933 is a smallest and lowest power solution to 
measure the range of impedances using discrete fourier 
components. The general impedance measurement system 
can be seen in Figure 2. The system is excited by a range of 
frequencies in order to measure the output phase and 
impedance magnitude. This approach is called the frequency 
domain measurement technique [9].  
In the block diagram from Figure 3, a direct digital 
synthesizer or DDS (AD9834) is used to generate a 
predefined frequency sweep to a tuning resolution of 
0.1Hz → 100kHz. The output frequency is then filtered and 
amplified before being applied to the known impedance. 
Analog to digital converter (ADC) is then utilized to sample 
synchronously across all frequencies so as both the excitation 
and response waveform can be compared to allow full phase 
information. The data is then delivered to digital signal 
processing (DSP) block for further processing.

AD5933 IC have been commercially utilized in 
impedance spectroscopy, proximity sensing, chemical 
analysis, bio medical analysis, human body impedance 
analysis and corrosion analysis. Norbotten B. J. [11] used 
AD5933 in the frequency range of 5 → 100kHz  and 
measured human body impedance in the range of 0.1kΩ →
10MΩ. Similarly Pena A. A. [12] developed spectrometer for 
electrical bioimpedance using this IC. This IC has also been 
utilized for measuring blood glucose levels by Kamat et. al.  
[13].  
III. 
APPROACH AND ARCHITECTURE 
The frequency generator allows an external complex 
impedance to be excited with a known frequency. The 
frequency generator require three inputs, which are start 
frequency ‘FSTART’, incremental frequency ‘F’ and number 
of frequency increments ‘NINCR’, see Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4. Frequency sweep characteristics 
The microcontroller used to program and to implement 
the architecture was Atmega128 due to its memory. Also, this 
microcontroller had the flexibility to read/write on AD5933 
IC’s internal registers through I2C interface. Nevertheless, the 
I2C address of AD5933 was fixed by the manufacturer. In this 
experiment it was desired to sweep the frequency from 
40𝐻𝑧 → 20kHz for a step of 40Hz. In order to meet this 
requirement, a changeable clock signal for AD5933 IC, was 
generated through Atmega128 timer1 in Clock Timer 
Counter (CTC) mode, see Figure 5. In CTC mode the counter 
was cleared to zero, when the free running counter or a 16 bit 
register (TCNT1) matches either the output compare register 
OCR1A (WGM13:0 = 4 where WGM is wave generation 
mode) or the input capture register ICR1 (WGM13:0 = 12). 
The counter value (TCNT1) was increased until a compare 
match occurs with either OCR1A or ICR1, and then counter 
(TCNT1) was cleared, see Figure 6. 
 
 
Figure 5. Block diagram for communication path 
 
Figure 6. CTC mode, timing diagram 
 
The function of timer1 over here was to generate 
frequencies, so that the CTC interrupat should be disabled to 
save CPU cycles. This Alf and Vegard RISC processor (AVR) 
timer was connected to general I/O Port. Then general I/O pin 
PD5 was converted to compare match output OC1A. After 
that OC1A pin function was set to toggle on compare match. 
Then the fuse bits were programmed to make clock division 
factor to 1 and set the timer1 clock source to no prescaling. 
Hence, the timer clock source was equal to crystal frequency, 
clkI/O=11.0592MHz. The output frequency was fout= 
clkI/O/(2×OCR1A). OCR1A was a 16-bits register, which 
ranged from 1 to 65535 therefore the range of output 
frequency could be was clkI/O/(2×1) to clkI/O/(2×65535), that 
is, from 5.5296MHz to 84Hz. Therefore when the system was 
running, the only requirement was to change the value of 
OCR1A to change the output frequency. Therefore using an 
internal clock source, which was 16.776MHz, the AD5933 
chip could measure the impedance spectrum in the required 
frequency range of 1 kHz–100kHz. However, using external 
clock source (as applied in this work), which was generated 
by AVR, the frequency range can go lower than 1 kHz.

Figure 7. Transmit Stage and Receive Stage of AD5933 [10] 
This IC worked in two stages, which are transmit stage 
and receive stage. The transmit stage of the AD5933 was 
made up of a 27 bit phase accumulator DDS core, which 
provided the output excitation signal at a particular 
frequency, see Figure 7a. The input to the phase accumulator 
was taken from the contents of the start frequency register

(Ram locations 82h, 83h and 84h). Although the phase 
accumulator offers 27bits of resolution, the start frequency 
register had the 3 most significant  bits (MSBs) sets to 0 
internally; therefore it became possible to program only the 
lower 24bits of the start frequency register. The frequency 
resolution 0.1Hz could be achieved. The frequency resolution 
was programmed via a 24 bit word loaded serially over the 
I2C interface to the frequency increment register. The last 
input was number of increments. 
The receive stage comprised of a current to voltage 
amplified, followed by a programmable gain amplifier 
(PGA), an anti aliasing filter, and an ADC, see Figure 7b. The 
unknown impedance was connected between the VOUT and 
VIN pins. The first stage current to voltage amplifier sat the 
VIN pin as a virtual ground with a DC value of VDD/2. The 
signal current developed across the unknown impedance was 
then flowed into the VIN pin, which, developed a voltage 
signal at the output of the current to voltage converter. 
The gain of the current to voltage amplifier was 
determined by selecting a feedback resistor of 𝑍𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 =
100𝑘Ω connected between rectified feedback (RFB) and VIN. 
The aim was to maintain the signal within the linear range of 
ADC (0V to 3.3V analog positive supply voltage or AVDD). 
The gain setting was set to one. The signal was then sent 
through a low pass filter and was presented to the input of the 
12bit, 1 mega samples per second (MSPS) ADC.  
The response signal from the impedance was sampled by 
the on-board ADC and discrete fourier transform (DFT) 
processed by an on-board DSP engine. Thle DFT algorithm 
returned real ‘ 𝑅 ’ and imaginary ‘ 𝐼 ’ data-word at each 
frequency point along the frequency sweep. Using these ‘𝑅’ 
and ‘𝐼’, magnitude ‘𝑀’ and phase ‘𝜑’ were calculated using 
(2) and (3). Therefore 𝑀𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑  and 𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑  were 
measured using 𝑅𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 and 𝐼𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑. Atmospheric ice 
was then placed on the electrode for which 𝑀𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 and 
𝜑𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 were measured using 𝑅𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 and 𝐼𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑚. 
                                  𝑀 = √𝑅2 + 𝐼2,                                 (2)

⁄
.                                (3) 
 
It was also necessary to ensure that the signal was always 
maintained within the linear range of the ADC over the 
impedance range of interest. Before measuring the unknown 
impedance, the calibration must be done. In calibration stage, 
the manufacturer mentioned that a gain factor needs to be 
calculated. The gain factor ‘𝐺𝐹’ could be calculated using,  
                             𝐺𝐹 =
1
𝑍𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑×𝑀𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑.                 (4) 
 
However, in this analysis, there was no need to calculate 
the gain factor due to the reason that in the measuring stage, 
the unknown impedance ‘𝑍𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑’ and its unknown phase 
were calculated using, 
                     𝑍𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛 =
𝑍𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑×𝑀𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑
𝑀𝑢𝑛𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑛

dielectric constant of the unknown sample of atmospheric ice. 
 
IV. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
Using (7), the results of εr
′  and εr
′′  were obtained by 
writing a simple algorithm in MatLab. The experimentations 
were done in the Cold Climate Chamber of UiT Campus 
Narvik, using the following samples at the respective 
temperatures, 
i. 
Glaze ice frozen on the electrode plate at a 
temperature of -160C,  
ii. Glaze ice frozen on the electrode plate at a 
temperature of -200C,  
iii. Glaze ice frozen on the electrode plate at a 
temperature of -240C,  
iv. Natural Snow from ground outside university 
campus at a temperature of -30C.  
v. Normal tap water at a temperature of 260C, 
The results of glaze ice at three different temperatures can 
be seen in Figure 8. This figure indicates there was no 
prominent peak observed in the dielectric constant variation 
(εr
′′ = imaginary part) with the variation in frequency (Figure 
8a), hence it was not possible to compare the results of Stiles 
[3] and Kuroiwa [14]. Both curves of εr
′(ω) and εr
′′(ω) were 
shifting towards left as temperature was decreasing. 
However, the capacitance phase ( 𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑛(εr
′′/εr
′) )  or 
dissipation factor (εr
′′/εr
′) reflect an observable trend. In the 
frequency range of  1 → 10kHz (relaxation frequency ‘𝑓𝑐’), 
the variation in the phase is prominent (Figure 8b). This value 
of 𝑓𝑐 was found in agreement with the experimental results of 
Stiles (Figure 1). It was also found that the average value of 
this phase reached a relative maximum of 200 by decreasing 
the temperature from −160𝐶 → −240𝐶 , hence more 
capacitance. The results were however very noisy possibly 
due to some harmonics from the microcontroller and 
reasonably high conductance of the sample. In another test, 
the results were compared with the natural occurring snow, 
collected from outside the university campus and water 
samples. The results are shown in Figure 9.  These results 
also indicated the same trend in the dielectric constant 
variation (εr
′′ = imaginary part) with frequency (Figure 9a), 
hence it was not possible to determine the relaxation due to 
dominated noise. Similarly, it was found that the phase of the 
capacitance ( 𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑛(εr
′′/εr
′) ) reflect observable trend for 
samples of glaze ice, snow and water (Figure 9b).

V. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
AD5933 IC works upon the frequency domain 
capacitance measurement technique [9]. It was possible to 
use the dissipation factor for detecting an icing event using 
the approach utilized in this experimental study. Most of the 
existing experimental study [3] [4] [14], by sweeping the 
frequency to determine the dielectric variation in different 
type of atmospheric ice, are laboratory based. However, the 
aim in this article was to evaluate the usage of AD5933 IC 
to detect an atmospheric icing event and determine ice type. 
It was found that the scope to utilize the excitation 
frequency from microcontroller clock for AD5933 IC is 
limited. A lot of noise was observed in the values of 
complex dielectric constant due to this and values were 
found possibly due to unwanted harmonics. It was therefore 
not possible to compare these values with the experimental 
values of Stiles and Ulaby [3], Evans [4] and Kuroiwa [14]. 
It was found that that the average value of this phase reached 
a relative maximum of 200 by decreasing the temperature 
from 
−160𝐶 → −240
, 
hence 
more 
capacitance. 
Nevertheless, by recording the dissipation factor / phase 
value, it was found possible to at least detect an icing event. 
Also due to reasonably high conductivity of ice, the 
complex dielectric constant was continuously reducing 
even at same environmental conditions, however the 
dissipation factor remained stable for longer range of 
frequencies. 
For future experimentations, it will be useful to improve 
the outputs of AD5933 IC for measuring atmospheric icing 
paramaters by utilizing the methods as described by Leonid 
[16].
