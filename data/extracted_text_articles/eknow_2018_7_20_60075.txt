Abstract—Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming the
mainstream
format
for
genome-sequence
data
and
creates
new challenges in genome-sequence comparison. The multiple-
sequence alignment approach is not suited to NGS data because
of short-read assembly and computational resource problems.
Therefore, alignment-free methods are needed for comparisons
involving NGS data. Most alignment-free methods rely on k-mer-
based distance measures. However, the characteristics of NGS
data mean that k-mer-based alignment-free methods might not
be optimal. NGS data contain substantial amounts of overlap
among the NGS reads, which will affect the distances between the
NGS sets for each input species as calculated by these methods.
We propose a novel alignment-free sequence-comparison method,
based on the number of neighbors in the NGS data, which aims
to reduce the effect of the NGS-read overlap. We performed
experiments that compared the proposed method with two exist-
ing methods. The results show that our method can distinguish
the differences between diverse species better than the compared
methods. Moreover, our method performs NGS data comparisons
while showing robustness with respect to the k parameter, in
contrast to the compared methods.

INTRODUCTION
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a method used to
transform data from genome samples to a digitized data se-
quence, achieving a rapid throughput compared with traditional
sequencing processes. Instead of one long sequence of genome
data, NGS produces large numbers of sequence fragments
called reads per genome sample. NGS can be applied to
many biological problems, including de novo whole-genome
sequencing and RNA-seq [1].
For most genome-sequence analysis applications, short-
read data is a new challenge [2], where sequence comparison
and phylogeny analysis are issues that we are interested
in. Normally, sequence-comparison algorithms use one long
genome sequence, such as 16S rRNA in mitochondrial DNA
(mtDNA), and the whole genome when measuring the distance
between sequences [3], [4], [5]. Clustering and classiﬁcation
algorithms are applied via distance matrices to produce a
phylogenetic tree from which evolutionary relationships among
species can be inferred. The emergence of NGS short-read
methods, with their new form for genome sequences, will
challenge the approach to genome-sequence analysis. In fact,
existing methods and algorithms are no longer efﬁcient for this
new type of genome data [6].
The traditional method for sequence comparison is the
multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) method, which has trou-
ble dealing with a large proportion of NGS short-read data.
Its approach is to reconstruct the short reads into one long
sequence. In a process called assemble, NGS reads are mapped
onto the template sequence, which involves signiﬁcant com-
putational cost. To assemble the genome without template
sequences is very challenging because the reads are mostly
short and contain large numbers of repeated genome data.
Recently, the alignment-free method for sequence comparison
has attracted attention from researchers because of its pro-
cessing efﬁciency compared with the alignment-based method
[6]. This method does not require an assembly process, and
is therefore scalable to large numbers of NGS short reads,
which avoids the main problem with MSA. Most alignment-
free methods rely on k-mer frequencies as the sequence proﬁle
used to measure the distance between proﬁles [5]. However,
alignment-free methods remain less accurate than MSA.
Several studies have proposed techniques that focus specif-
ically on NGS short-read data. CV Tree [7], [8] and dS
2 [9]
have shown good results for distance measurements and phy-
logeny reconstruction with both NGS data and long genome se-
quences. For a given k, CV Tree and dS
2 calculate the distance
between two NGS samples (or two DNA sequences) based
on the normalized k-mer frequencies. Because these methods
rely on k-mers, we need to consider the random overlaps
between NGS short reads. These overlaps affect the frequency
of occurrence of k-mers within NGS sets, which could lead to
an inaccurate distance matrix. The random overlaps between
NGS short reads can cause differences between the k-mer
frequency proﬁles of any two NGS sets obtained from the
same species sample.
In this paper, we propose an assembly-free and alignment-
free sequence-comparison method for NGS data called dNS.
The main aim of dNS is to reduce the effect of the overlap
among NGS short reads in sequence comparisons. By grouping
similar short reads together, we can assume that reads sharing
the same overlap are likely to fall into the same group.
Using a statistical assessment of the number of short reads
included in the neighbor search with a set of queries, the
method provides information about the similarity between
NGS sets. We performed experiments with two simulated NGS
datasets. According to the results using 29 mammalian mtDNA
sequences [10], [11], dNS performed well when reconstruct-
ing the phylogenetic tree of a diverse-species dataset, which
indicates that dNS can achieve sequence comparisons using
NGS data. For a 29-member Escherichia/Shigella whole-
genome dataset [12], dNS outperformed dS
2 and matched the
performance of CV Tree. In addition, the results showed that

dNS is more robust with respect to various values for k than
dS
2 and CV Tree, which indicates that dNS is robust against
the effects of NGS short-read overlap on the k-mer frequency
distribution. Because this neighbor-search-based alignment-
free approach to sequence comparison is novel, there is plenty
of scope for further development and possible improvements.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Two k-mer frequency-based alignment-free methods are
considered in this paper, namely CV Tree [7], [8] and dS
2 [9].
Both CV Tree and dS
2 focus on normalized k-mer frequencies.
The difference is that CV Tree calculates the distance between
two genome sequences or NGS short-read sets by using
their normalized k-mer frequency vector, called the composite
vector (CV), whereas dS
2 is a statistical approach to modifying
raw distance measures to produce measures better suited to
NGS data.
A.
CV Tree: CV alignment-free method
The CV Tree process is as follows. For a ﬁxed length k,
count separately the number of substrings of length k, k − 1,
k − 2 on each input sequence. The initial CV is the number
of k-mer items, which is N = 4k total dimensions for DNA
sequences and N = 20k for protein sequences in lexicographic
order. Calculate the subtraction score for the k-mer:
ai(α1α2...αk) ≡ f(α1α2...αk) − f 0(α1α2...αk)
f 0(α1α2...αk)
,
where f(α1α2...αk) is the frequency of k-mer α1α2...αk
and f 0(α1α2...αk) is the predicted frequency of the k-mer,
calculated by using a (k − 2)-th Markov assumption.
Let CVA = (a1a2...aN) and CVB = (b1b2...bN) be the
CVs for the species A and B, respectively. Finally, calculate
the distance matrix for the modiﬁed CV:
D(A, B) = (1 − C(CVA, CVB))/2,
where
C(CVA, CVB) =

B. dS
2 k-mer statistical alignment-free method
dS
2 statistics is a modiﬁed version of D2, D∗
2, and DS
2
statistics [13], [14]. They are applicable to NGS data by
considering the random processes of NGS data in terms of D2,
D∗
2, and DS
2 to model the correct k-mer distribution of NGS
data. NGS short reads are small fragments from the original
long sequence, which means that the method of sampling those
reads will affect the k-mer frequency distribution. Another
characteristic of NGS data relevant to dS
2 statistics is that
an NGS short read can originate from the forward or reverse
strand of the original genome, requiring consideration of not
only the k-mer distributions of short-read data themselves but
also their complementary sequences. dS
2 can be calculated by:

Suppose that M reads of length β are sampled from a
genome of length n. Let Xw and Yw be the numbers of
occurrences of word pattern w in the M pairs of reads from the
ﬁrst genome and the second genome, respectively. We deﬁne

w being deﬁned
analogously. Let w = w1w2...wk and pw = pw1pw2...pwk,
with
¯w being the complement of word w. Consider two
genome sequences taking L letters (0, 1, ..., L − 1) at each
position. For the null model, we assume that the two genomes
are independent and both are generated by models with pl
being the probability of taking state l, l = 0, 1,..., L − 1.

PROPOSED METHOD
The NGS data comprise a very large quantity of short
reads that contain overlapping data. Particularly for whole-
genome sequences, the number of overlaps and repeats can
grow dramatically. Most existing research on alignment-free
methods adopts k-mer frequencies to specify the proﬁle of a
sequence and when obtaining distances in NGS sets. However,
the random overlap of short reads in NGS data will clearly
affect the distribution of k-mer frequencies. This is the key
problem we focus on in this research.
Because the problem is caused by the overlap and the
repeating data, the key idea is to reduce their effect by grouping
similar short reads. We can then use a statistical approach to
calculate the evolutionary distance between NGS short reads.
Fig. 1 shows a feature space spanned by the k-mers. (As
mentioned above, the dimensionality of the space is 4k, but,
for readability, we show a 2-D space.) Each dot represents
an NGS short read. Dots of the same color indicate that the
corresponding NGS short read comes from the same genome
sequence. For a given short read r, its set of neighbors is
123

deﬁned as the set of short reads whose distance from r is
within a predeﬁned threshold. The circle in Fig. 1 encloses
the neighborhood of the short read represented by the triangle.
The assumption is that the short reads that are placed near
each other in the feature space will have a high probability of
sharing overlapping data. We deﬁne the difference between
any two NGS sets by comparing the number of neighbor-
search results that correspond to the same collection of search
queries on their NGS short reads. Because this method does
not consider k-mer frequencies in the similarity measures of
NGS sets, any overlap effects on the ﬁnal distance matrix are
reduced.
A. Notations and equations
Denote dNS(X, Y ) as the pairwise distance between NGS
sets X and Y , where X = {x1, x2, ...xn} and n is the number
of NGS short reads of X. Similarly, Y = {y1, y2, ...ym} and m
is the number of NGS short reads of Y . For a query sequence q,
let Rq
X denote the number of neighbors of q in X. dNS(X, Y )
can then be calculated as follows:
dNS(X, Y ) = (D(X, Y ) + D(Y, X))/2,

D(X, Y ) is a divergence measurement calculated by sum-
mation of the rational difference between the number of
neighbors in NGS sets X and Y for all NGS short reads
x1, x2, ...xn ∈ X. The min to max ratio of two normalized
values
R
xi
X
n
and
R
xi
Y
m in Eq. (2) indicates the rational similarity
between those two values. If the normalized numbers of
neighbors for X and Y are the same, this term will be equal
to 1. Subtracting the term from 1 makes it a divergence
measurement. For each short read in X and Y , the distance is
weighted by the normalized number of the neighbors for that
query. Because D(X, Y ) is an asymmetric function, we deﬁne
the distance dNS(x, y) as the average value of D(X, Y ) and
D(Y, X).
In the current implementation, we use locality-sensitive
hashing (LSH) [15] for the neighbor search because of its
lightweight nature. Minhash [16] was originally used to com-
pare the similarity between documents. This algorithm pro-
vides a fast approximation of the Jaccard similarity between
two sets by using their Minhash signatures and simply counts
the number of components of the signatures that are equal.
Let h be the hash function for mapping an integer to another
different integer, with no collisions. Apply n hash functions
in H = h1, h2, ..., hn to the set of integers. For each hi from
i = 1 to n, the minimum hash value produced by hi will
be assigned to the ith component of the Minhash signature.
We use this process to obtain the Minhash signature of an
NGS short read. The set of k-mers that appear in an NGS
short read are transformed into a set of integers to enable
the hash functions to be applied. These hash functions are
randomly generated with various values for the parameters
that produce different hash functions. LSH is a process for
ﬁnding a group of items whose Minhash signature is similar
to a query’s signature. It separates the Minhash signature into
a series of bands, each comprising a set of rows. For example,
200 Minhash signatures might be separated into 20 bands of 4
rows each. Each band is then hashed to a “bucket. If two sets
have the same Minhash signature in a band, they will be hashed
to the same bucket, and will therefore be considered candidate
pairs. In our approach, utilizing LSH with Minhash enables us
to search for similar NGS short reads easily. However, dNS
could adopt alternative neighbor-search algorithms because the
distance measurements in dNS are based on the results of
neighbor search, rather than its method.

EVALUATIONS AND RESULTS
A. Experiment setup
Two datasets, comprising 29 mammalian mtDNA se-
quences
[10],
[11]
and
29
Escherichia/Shigella
[12]
genomes were used to evaluate dNS by comparing it with
two existing k-mer-based alignment-free methods, namely
CV Tree and dS
2 . Because both datasets were originally made
up of long sequences, we used a tool called MetaSim [17] to
simulate NGS short reads from long genome sequences. We
used three error models, namely 454, Empirical(Illumina), and
Sanger, which enabled us to simulate the NGS high-throughput
sequencing results from three different NGS platforms. These
sequenced the actual samples into NGS data. In the following
discussion, the term “Exact” refers to the non-error case in
simulating NGS short reads from long genomic sequences.
We used sampling depths of 1, 5, 10, and 30, where the
sampling depth means the average number of occurrences
of the character at each position in the original sequences
appearing in the NGS set. The length of NGS short reads was
set to 100, with a default parameter for the error distribution
for each model. For the parameter k, we considered using
k values in the range 6 to 10. Although a larger k should
give a better result, the processing time to map each NGS
short read to the feature space would increase signiﬁcantly.
We planned our experiments to use this range of k values
for several reasons. One reason was that CV Tree and dS
2
proponents have suggested it as a suitable range. Second, for
dNS, k values out of this range would affect the efﬁciency of
the neighbor-search process.
MSA was used as the benchmark method for comparison
with the alignment-free methods to evaluate their performance
on phylogeny reconstruction. We used the ClusterOmega
tool [18], followed by the dnadist tool in the PHYLIP package
[19], on aligned sequences from MSA to calculate distance
matrices.
For a distance matrix, either from MSA or from an
alignment-free method, we used the neighbor tool in the
PHYLIP package to construct a phylogenetic tree using the
neighbor-joining method [20]. We used the popular Robinson–
Fould distance (RF) [21] for evaluation, as described in [22].
The RF value can be calculated by counting the internal nodes
that appear in one tree but not in the other. A small RF value
means that the shape of the trees is close to the benchmark
tree. The values for RF range from 0, meaning two tree are
exactly the same, to 2(n − 3) where n is the number of leaf
nodes.

B. Experimental results
1) The 29 mammalian mtDNA sequences: The 29 mam-
malian mtDNA sequences are a well-studied dataset, be-
ing widely used for the evaluation of existing sequence-
comparison methods. The MSA tree for this dataset is therefore
a reliable benchmark for our experiments. Because the evolu-
tionary relation between each species in this dataset is diverse,
a sequence-comparison method should be able to reconstruct
a phylogenetic tree almost identical to that for MSA to offer
conﬁdence in the performance of the method.
We applied three alignment-free methods, namely dNS,
CV Tree, and dS
2 , to simulated NGS short-read data. We com-
pared the resultant phylogenetic trees with the benchmark tree
obtained from MSA with mtDNA sequences. At a sampling
depth of 1, the phylogenetic trees obtained from the three
alignment-free methods were very different from the MSA
benchmark tree because of the shallow sampling depth.
Fig. 2 shows the RF between the MSA benchmark tree
and the phylogenetic tree obtained by dNS, CV Tree, and dS
2
on four types of NGS reads, using a sampling depth of 5
and various k parameter values. The ﬁgure shows that dNS
produces a more accurate tree than either CV Tree or dS
2 in
most cases.
Table I summarizes the most accurate result for each
alignment-free method shown in Fig. 2. Note that RF can
be up to 52 for this dataset. The best RF result in the table
among all three methods is 8, which means that the rational
distance between the tree obtained via alignment-free methods
and the benchmark tree is 8/52 = 0.154. We can therefore
consider that dNS and the other two alignment-free methods
all perform well using this dataset. dNS produced the best
result among the alignment-free methods across all NGS error
models. Regarding the sampling depth, we found no signiﬁcant
differences with 10 and 30 sampling, as shown in Fig. 3 for
dNS. The same result was found for CV Tree and dS
2 [22].
We investigated how parameter values affect the perfor-
mance of dNS. Fig. 3 shows the result of dNS on NGS reads
of 29 mammalian mtDNA sequences with a parameter setup
that included four NGS error models, k values from 6 to 10,
and sampling depths of 1, 5, 10, and 30. With a sampling
depth of 1 for any NGS error model, dNS could not produce
an accurate phylogenetic tree for this dataset. The reason could
be that the numbers of queries used in the neighbor search are

too small to retrieve good distance measurements. According
to this result for dNS, we can infer that a more suitable value
for the k parameter would be 8 or 9.
2) The
29
Escherichia/Shigella
whole-genome
se-
quences: We used this dataset to evaluate the performance
of dNS on the whole genomes of species that are close
to each other in evolutionary terms. The 29 whole-genome
sequences come from two main genera, namely Escherichia
and Shigella, which are from the same Enterobacteriaceae
family in the Bacteria kingdom. Because the dataset is large,
MSA’s lack of scalability prevents it from being applied.
We obtained the benchmark tree for this dataset from [12].
This involved concatenating the alignments of the 2034 core
genes of the Escherichia/Shigella genomes, then using a
maximum-likelihood method to construct the phylogenetic tree
for this dataset.
With the close evolutionary relationship between the
Escherichia and Shigella species, all alignment-free meth-
ods tested in this experiment failed to obtain an accurate RF
result when comparing their resultant trees with the benchmark
tree. As shown in Table II, the best RF value was 16, with the
rational distance between the result tree and the benchmark
tree being 16/52 = 0.3. The performances of all three methods
were below a satisfactory level. There was no signiﬁcant
difference among the dNS, CV Tree, and dS
2 methods. In fact,
dS
2 performed better for the Exact error model, whereas dNS
and CV Tree performed better for the other error models.
A point to note is that dNS appears more robust with
respect to variations in the k parameter than CV Tree or dS
2 ,
as shown in Fig. 4. For most k, and for each error model,
dNS’s phylogenetic tree is more accurate than those of the
other methods, with the RF value being at the same level. For
example, although dS
2 performs best on the Exact model with
RF of 18 when k = 9 and 10, the RF values are much bigger for
other k values. Robustness against the parameter k is beneﬁcial
because it makes parameter tuning easier and we can optimize
the processing efﬁciency by choosing a smaller value for k.
The reason for this effect is that the k parameter does not
directly affect how dNS calculates the distance between each
species. It uses the k value only for constructing the feature
space. Because of limited computing resources, we examined
only the case of the 1 sampling depth.
The main aim of this research is to introduce a novel
approach to performing NGS data comparisons. It is to be
expected that the computational efﬁciencies of CV Tree and
dS
2 would exceed that of dNS in its current implementation.
Table III conﬁrms that dNS’s runtime is slower than the others.
However, the k parameter value does not affect the runtime of
dNS, unlike those for CV Tree and dS
2 . In particular, dS
2 ’s
runtime grows dramatically between k = 6 and k = 10. It is an

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In conclusion, we propose a novel approach for an
alignment-free method dNS that is focused on NGS short-
read data and based on neighbor searching. Its main advantage
is that it is an accurate alignment-free sequence-comparison
method for reconstructing a phylogenetic tree more consis-
tently than other k-mer-based alignment-free methods. Al-
though it might lose signiﬁcant information in the NGS data
when ignoring the k-mer frequencies, the method is able to
specify the distance between NGS sets with good accuracy
when a sufﬁcient number of queries is used.

with simulated NGS short reads, the dNS method can construct
a phylogenetic tree that is almost as accurate as a benchmark
tree. In addition, dNS is able to deal with NGS short-read faults
in the k-mer distribution, as shown in our results. However,
the main drawback of dNS is the computational inefﬁciency
of the neighbor-search process, which consists of many NGS
short-read comparisons.
Because this method is a novel approach to NGS short-read
comparison, there are many aspects of it that we can develop
to make the method more accurate and more computationally
efﬁcient. First, we should consider modifying dNS toward
a parameter-free approach. To improve the dNS accuracy,
we should consider applying different processes for mapping
the NGS reads to a high-dimensional space during neighbor
search, rather than using a k-mer frequency vector. This
modiﬁcation would seek to obtain more reliable grouping
of overlapping NGS reads. Second, we should modify the
equation for distance measurement used in this approach.
We have noticed that calculating distances in the NGS data
using only the number of neighbor query results might be
insufﬁcient to achieve better results. This information is quite
coarse in comparison with normalized k-mer frequencies. We
should consider combining our approach with other alignment-
free methods to achieve higher accuracy. Finally, we need
to optimize this method to be more scalable with respect to
computational efﬁciency by considering alternative neighbor-
search algorithms. In fact, we might consider a completely
different approach, other than neighbor search, to the grouping
of overlapping NGS reads.
