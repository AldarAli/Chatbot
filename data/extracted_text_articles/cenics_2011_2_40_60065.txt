Abstract—Performance of high-k Double-Gate SOI MOSFETs 
is studied and compared to silicon dioxide based devices.  This 
is achieved by computing variation of threshold voltage, swing 
subthreshold, leakage current and drain-induced barrier 
lowering (DIBL) with respect to different gate bias (VG) when 
gate length (LG) decreases. This comparison is pinpointed 
taking SiO2 and HfO2 as gate oxides. Furthermore, quantum 
effects on the performance of DG MOSFETs are discussed. It 
is observed that less EOT with high permittivity reduces the 
tunnel current and serves to maintain high drive current, when 
compared with device using SiO2 dielectric. Our results show 
that the characteristics of SOI Double Gate MOSFET with 
HfO2 are superior to that of a device with SiO2 dielectric

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
     Over the past years, silicon-based electronic technology 
has been improved through downscaling MOSFETs, 
resulting in higher device performance and density. 
However, it has been expected that this downscaling will 
reach its limits about the gate of 5 nm around the year 2020 
or so. The 2006 edition of the ITRS (International 
Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors) forecasts a 
minimum feature size of 18 nm-node, a physical gate length 
of 7 nm for the year 2018 [1].  According to ITRS, a very 
thin gate insulator with EOT (Equivalent Oxide Thickness) 
less than 1 nm is required for both high performance and 
low power consumption CMOS devices. The thinner oxide 
lets more current leak between the gate and the substrate, 
driving up power consumption and better on- and off-state 
control [2].  In order to obtain a very thin EOT, we need to 
use high-k gate insulator such as HfO2 which is the most 
promising candidate, since it possesses high dielectric 
constant and good thermal stability in contact with silicon 
[2, 3].  
    Another way to overcome short channel effects (SCE) is 
the use of multiple-gate structures on undoped SOI (Silicon 
On Insulator).  One of these architectures is the Double Gate 
MOSFET (SOI DG-MOSFET) intended to control the 
channel very efficiently by applying a gate contact to both 
sides of the channel [4].  The intrinsic channel Double Gate 
MOSFET needs to rely solely on gate work function to 
achieve multiple threshold voltages on a chip due to the 
absence of body doping, which is efficient tool to adjust the 
threshold voltage in Double Gate MOSFET with doped 
channel [5, 6]. 
      From the very beginning of semiconductor technology, 
it was thought that numerical, physics-based analysis of 
devices could help a great deal in their understanding. 
Nowadays, simulation and modeling of semiconductor 
devices have become one of the most important 
development methodologies in industry and research alike 
[7]. In this work we use the nextnano code to simulate a 
DG-MOSFET with high-k gate dielectric. This simulation 
tool is based on the self-consistent solution of the 
Schrödinger, Poisson and current equations [8, 9]. The 
coupled Poisson-Schrödinger system is solved by an 
approximate quantum charge density, which is employed 
inside of Poisson’s equation in order to estimate the 
dependence of the density on the potential through 
Schrödinger’s equation. Using this estimator the coupling 
between both equations is much decreased and rapid 
convergence is achieved. The electronic structure is 
calculated within a single-band or multiband k .p envelope 
function approximation. The included model for the carrier 
transport is a Wentzel–Kramer–Brillouin (WKB)-type 
approach also known as quantum-drift-diffusion (QDD) 
method, where the carriers are locally in equilibrium, 
charactized by a local Fermi level [10, 11]. 
     The outline of the paper is as follows. Section II 
describes device structure. Section III presents some 
theoretical aspects. Section IV shows the simulation results 
using Quantum-drift-diffusion method. Using different gate 
oxide, the DIBL, subthreshold slope, and Ion current versus 
Ioff current under different EOT are presented and compared, 
also the gate direct tunneling current as function of the gate 
voltage are presented. Section V concludes the paper. 
 
II.     DEVICE STRUCTURE 
     An even higher Ion current and decreased subthreshold 
slope can be obtained by the careful choice of a gate 
dielectric. Moreover a Physical gate length of 7nm is kept 
constant for easy comparison. At this channel length limits, 
the susceptibility of the transistor to short channel effects

(SCE) is monitored in several ways such as threshold 
voltage (VTH), leakage current (Ioff) and drain induced 
barrier lowering (DIBL). 
     The structure of the proposed device is shown in Fig. 1.   
This symmetric structure is characterized by p-type doped 
Si channel of width 5nm. This channel is embedded 
between two heavily n-doped source and drain regions of 
length 10 nm that are connected to source and drain 
contacts. The junctions are assumed to be abrupt. The 
doping concentration of channel and source/drain are 1016 
cm-3,  1020 cm-3  respectively.  The polysilicon gates with 
work function 4.1eV are separated from the Si channel by 
an oxide layer and the power supply voltage VDD is 0.7V.  
    The 7nm length is chosen to study the performances of 
device, taking different Oxide thickness (5nm, 1.5nm, 1nm 
and 0.8nm) with the two Si channel width (5nm and 3nm) 
for both SiO2 and HfO2.

THEORETICAL ASPECTS 
     The model of carrier transport used in this paper is the 
quantum-drift-diffusion  model as implemented in nextnano. 
This model uses the first moment of the Boltzmann equation 
to determine the current and the quantum mechanics to 
calculate the carrier density. The charge density nc(x) for 
carriers of type c is calculated by assuming the carriers to be 
in a local equilibrium characterized by local quasi-Fermi 
levels

RESULTS 
     Using the proposed model, the DIBL is calculated for 
VDS = 50 mV and plotted as a function of the oxide 
thickness (EOT) in Fig. 2. The evolution of the barrier for 
TSi varying between 5nm and 3nm illustrates clearly the 
dependence of the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) on 
permittivity and Si channel width. The range of variation of 
the DIBL for SiO2 based device is from 0.02 eV for TSi = 
5nm to 0.063eV for TSi=3nm.  The DIBL is decreased for 
HfO2 based device and varies from 0.015eV for TSi=5nm 
and 0.023eV for TSi=3nm. From this figure it can be 
concluded that HfO2 has a great impact on the reduction of 
DIBL. 
     Fig. 3 illustrates the effect of high permittivity on 
subthreshold slope. It is well known that a small 
subthreshold slope is highly desired since it improves the 
ratio between the on- and off-currents. It is clear from figure 
3 that for SiO2 the subthreshold slope is degraded by almost 
400 % when the oxide thickness is reduced from 0.8 nm to 5 
nm for a channel width of 5 nm.  While for HfO2 the 
subthreshold slope is less degraded (only 148 %) for the 
same channel width. The figure also show that reducing the 
channel width  (TSi) to 3nm the same trends as already  are 
observed for both SiO2 and HfO2. The subthreshold slope 
takes a minmum value 90 mV/dec at EOT=1.5nm. We can 
conclude 
that 
subthreshold 
characteristics 
of 
SOI 
DGMOSFET based HfO2 are clearly better than SiO2 based 
device, but remains far from ITRS recommendation as the 
subthreshold slope S should not be higher than 80mV/dec.

     Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show gate direct tunneling current as

current becomes an increasingly important such when 
reducing TSi at 0.8nm physical thickness, and becomes 
much higher when replacing SiO2 with HfO2  thus the gate 
current at VDS=VDD=0.7V, is varied from 9.15·10-19 A/m at 
EOT=5nm to 0,135A/m at EOT=0.8nm for SiO2 and from

    The Ion current versus Ioff currrent for different EOT and 
for two channel width  is represented in Fig. 6. The high 
permittivity increases Ion and decreases Ioff for various EOT, 
for HfO2 at EOT=0.8nm, Ion  current value tends towards  
1002.02 A/m with Ioff currrent value equal to 0.15A/m, 
besides the SiO2 Ion current value which is equal to 717A/m 
with Ioff currrent value equal to 35.208A/m but when 
reducing the Si width channel to 3nm, we obtained a little 
values for Ion  current and Ioff currrent  than 5nm width 
channel, in this case Ion  current  is much  weak, which is  
cannot meet the ITRS predicted value.

CONCLUSION 
     In order to improve subthreshold slope and to suppress 
drain-induced barrier lowering in SOI MOFET, double gate 
architecture and high-k dielectric are introduced in this 
paper. The simulations were conducted using the nextnano 
code which uses a quantum-drift-diffusion model for carrier 
transport taking into account quantum confinement effects. 
It s concluded that hafnium oxide is one of the best 
candidate to replace SiO2, due to its extremely high 
subthreshold slope. Also HfO2 is effective at reducing Ioff 
current and maximizing the ratio of   Ion/ Ioff .
