Abstract— The upper limb is extremely important in the 
performance of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), and its 
function is highly compromised when considering the sequelae 
of neuromotor diseases. It is essential to obtain more accurate 
information about the contraction patterns of the upper limb in 
healthy individuals, for a better understanding and assessment 
of the movements performed during ADLs in pathological 
situations, since conventional assessment methods do not 
provide objective data on the patient's performance. The 
integration of technological devices in the assessment of the 
contraction pattern will be an asset in obtaining more accurate 
information to expand our ability to know, predict and diagnose 
health conditions. A pilot study was conducted to characterize 
upper limb neuromotor biosignals during five ADLs in 18 
healthy individuals. The BiosignalsPlux device was used to 
monitor the contraction pattern of the shoulder muscles by 
means of electromyography (EMG). Thus, the main objective of 
this article is to describe the results of the application of an 
experimental protocol to analyze the contraction pattern of six 
shoulder muscles during ADLs, through the electromyographic 
signal. Through this study, differences were verified in the 
patterns of muscle activation amplitude between ADLs directed 
to the midline, between ADLs directed to the contralateral side, 
as well as between these two groups of activities.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The performance and participation in Activities of Daily 
Living (ADLs) are strongly affected by the limitation of 
functional movements of the upper limb [1]. Functional use of 
the upper limb is highly compromised when considering 
stroke sequelae [2]. It is estimated that this affects about 80% 
of acute patients and 40% of chronic patients after stroke [3]. 
Upper limb paresis after stroke is characterized by 
decreased muscle strength [4] and loss of autonomy in ADLs 
[5]. About 37%-55% of subjects with stroke have deficits in 
the performance of these activities [6]. These deficits in the 
performance are related to the omission of small actions, 
changes in the sequence and in the quality of their 
performance, as demonstrated in studies related to the 
preparation of meals [7] and hygiene [8]. 
Impairment and disability in clinical settings are generally 
assessed by ordinal scales that are not very sensitive to the 
smallest and most specific changes [9]. More objective 
assessment methods are needed to evaluate and describe the 
upper limb function in detail [10]. 
An important factor for a better understanding and 
assessment of movements performed during ADLs, in 
pathological situations, is to understand the characteristics of 
the contraction patterns of the upper limb in healthy 
individuals in these same activities. The integration of 
technological devices that make it possible to obtain more 
accurate data about the contraction patterns in healthy subjects 
is extremely important here, since the expansion of knowledge 
about the contraction pattern in ADLs is only achieved 
through this type of information, so that later, in pathological 
conditions, we can predict and diagnose the changes more 
objectively. 
A. Data analysis of upper limb movement in ADLs 
Several studies have been performed using technology to 
study upper limb performance during functional tasks related 
to ADLs [10]-[16]. Although these studies are directed to the 
analysis of upper limb functionality, most of them focus on 
the study of kinetic and kinematic parameters and not on 
biosignals. Mainly using only technological tools such as 
optoelectronic 
motion 
analysis 
systems 
and 
inertial 
measurement sensors (3D accelerometer, 3D magnetometer 
and 3D gyroscope) [10]-[12][14][15]. However, they focus

their analysis only on the performance of the activity, drinking 
from a glass [10]-[13][15] and only two of them analyzed the 
pattern of contraction of the muscles of the upper limb in 
ADLs [13][16], using surface electromyography (EMG). 
Although kinematic analysis and kinetic analysis provide 
us with very relevant information in movement analysis, only 
through EMG can we know the amplitude of muscle 
activation of a group of muscles involved in ADLs. 
EMG is the measurement of the electrical signal 
associated with muscle activity. Muscle excitation is then 
analyzed through the amplitude of the EMG signals, which 
means that the more motor units are recruited and the higher 
the firing rates, the greater the contraction by the muscle [17]. 
Through the EMG signal, muscle contraction and relaxation 
data are obtained, indicating whether the muscle is actively 
participating in the execution of the movement. 
B. Analysis of the muscle activation amplitude of the upper 
limb in ADLs 
According to one of the studies found [13], the sequence 
of muscle activation amplitude in the activity of drinking 
water from a glass, differs between subjects with and without 
stroke, regarding shoulder and arm muscles. In shoulder 
muscles, Superior Trapezius is activated throughout the 
activity, contrary to healthy subjects, who only activate in the 
phases of taking the glass to the mouth and returning to the 
table. The deltoids (anterior, middle, and posterior) in 
individuals with stroke are activated in the phases of "initial 
position to reach", "reach for the cup", "carry to mouth", while 
the control group only activates the anterior deltoid in the two 
first phases, the middle deltoid in the third phase and the 
posterior deltoid in the "return to pick up point" and "return 
hand to initial position". 
 In the study that our team developed previously [16] but 
in only one healthy individual, the results are indicative of 
differences in the pattern of activation amplitude between 
ADLs directed to the midline (drinking from a cup, eating 
soup and brushing teeth), between ADLs directed to the 
contralateral side (brushing the hair on the contralateral side 
of the head and washing the contralateral upper limb), as well 
as between these two groups of activities. In this study, two 
parameters were used to characterize the pattern of muscle 
contraction, the maximum peak of contraction amplitude 
(mV), that is, the maximum contraction amplitude verified in 
each of the muscles, as well as the time (s) in which these same 
maximums occur during the ADLs performance, which makes 
it possible to perceive the sequence of maximum amplitude of 
contraction activation of each muscle during the activity. 
To better understand and evaluate the compensatory motor 
strategies developed by patients with neuromotor disorders, 
such as stroke, and to verify an inadequate pattern of muscle 
activation during ADLs, it is necessary to know the normal 
pattern of muscle activation in these activities, in healthy 
individuals. These compensatory motor strategies are very 
common in stroke patients and can cause severe 
musculoskeletal disorders, worsening the functional status of 
patients [18]. Therefore, it is essential that these compensatory 
patterns are detected early, thus preventing the installation of 
other types of dysfunctions resulting from stroke. 
Biosignals give thus valuable information that provides a 
better perception of the patient's clinical status, constituting an 
important tool for clinical decision-making and measurement 
of the evolution resulting from clinical intervention [19]. 
The issue of this investigation focuses on exploring the 
applicability of the protocol [16] and characterizing the 
muscle activation pattern in healthy individuals in ADLs. This 
study aims to analyze and explore the characteristics 
(amplitude and sequence of muscle activation peaks) of the 
activation pattern of the electromyographic activity of the 
shoulder main muscles [20] during ADLs (eating, drinking, 
dressing and personal care) [21] in healthy individuals. 
 This article describes in Section 2, the materials, and 
methods (participants, equipment, and the experimental 
procedure of the investigation), in Section 3 the results, in 
Section 5, the discussion of them from a critical perspective 
and in Section 6 the main conclusions and perspectives.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This study was previously approved by the Ethics 
Committee and the Board of Directors of NOVA School of 
Science and Technology at NOVA University of Lisbon, and 
data collection was carried out at the same university. 
A. Characterization of the Sample  
This protocol was applied to 24 healthy adult subjects, 
selected for convenience. Of these individuals, 6 were 
excluded due to failure to capture the EMG signal during 
activities, leaving the sample with n=18 individuals. As 
exclusion criteria, diagnosis of neuromotor, cognitive or 
language deficits and changes in visual acuity not 
compensated by glasses or contact lenses were defined. The 
volunteer joined the study after reading and signing the 
informed consent. 
The 18 participants who make up the sample of this study 
present the following characteristics: mean age of 29.1 years 
± 3.2 in a range 19-62 years, in which 6 men and 12 women, 
17 were dominant right-handers. 
B. Instruments  
To collect the EMG signals, the Biosignalsplux device was 
used, wirelessly connected to the OpenSignals (r)evolution 
software, for data acquisition, visualization, and processing, 
being a specific software for PLUX biosignal hardware 
platforms [22]. 6 channels were used to record bipolar EMG 
related to 6 different muscles and the signal was collected at a 
sample frequency of 1000Hz. [13]. 
The electrodes were placed 2 cm apart [23], according to 
the agonist muscles of the main shoulder movements namely 
the Pectoralis Major (PM), Anterior Deltoid (AD), Middle 
Deltoid (MD), Posterior Deltoid (PD), Upper Trapezius (UT) 
and Lower Trapezius (LT), responsible for flexion (F), 
extension (E), abduction (ABD), adduction (AD), scapular 
elevation (SE), and scapular depression (SD) [19].

C. Experimetal Procedure 
The procedures for carrying out this study consisted of: 
• 
Participants first performed activities directed to the 
midline (drinking from a cup, having soup, brushing 
teeth) and then to the contralateral side (brushing 
hair and washing the contralateral side), with the 
dominant limb [16].  
• 
During the tests of activities directed to the midline, 
the subjects will be seated in a chair without an 
armrest (40 cm high) with the dorso-lumbar region 
of the spine supported on the back of the chair, next 
to a table (75 cm height), with the feet well 
supported on the floor, knees and hips flexed at 90º. 
The upper limbs are placed on the table, assuming 
as the initial position the shoulder in neutral 
position, elbow flexed at 90º, forearm in pronation, 
wrist in neutral position and two in extension. 
• 
In activities directed to the contralateral side, 
participants are seated in a chair, in the same 
position as in the previous activities, but away from 
the table. The upper limbs are supported on the 
thighs, shoulders in a neutral position, elbows flexed 
at 45º, forearms and wrists in a neutral position and 
fingers semi-flexed. In these activities, only an 
object (hairbrush) is used, which is in the subject's 
hand in the initial position. To carry out these 
activities, a glass cup, a metal spoon, a soup bowl, a 
toothbrush, a toothpaste, and a hairbrush were 
selected as materials (Table I). 
• 
The materials will be placed before the start of the 
rehearsal of each of the respective activities, in the 
respective marks on the table towards the midline of 
the subjects' body: the cup at the 8x8cm mark 30 cm 
from the edge of the table, the soup bowl at the 
14x14 cm mark at 3 cm from the edge of the table 
and the toothbrush and toothpaste in the same mark. 
• 
Before data collection, each activity is explained 
and given the opportunity to perform the movement 
so that subjects feel comfortable with the execution 
of it [10].  
• 
Participants will be instructed to perform 5 trials in 
each of the 5 activities, making a total of 20 trials. 
• 
Once the subjects are ready, the command “you can 
start now” is given and the subject will perform the 
activity at a speed comfortable for him/herself and 
five trials are collected.   
• 
Between each trial, subjects will have a 2-minute 
rest period and a further rest period (5 minutes) 
between the set of activities aimed at the midline and 
activities aimed at the contralateral side to minimize 
muscle fatigue. 
D. Activities performed 
The activities performed by the participants consist of 
complex movements of the joints of the upper limbs. 
Considering their complexity, it is important to distinguish 
their phases [11][24] (Table I), as well as the respective 
movements performed by the shoulder [20] (Table II).

E. Signal Analysis  
MATLAB software, version R2022a, was used to process 
the EMG signals. The files were imported into this software, 
and channels related to the EM activity were selected for each 
of the activity.  
After selecting the epoch of 7000 points corresponding to 
the activity (part of the signal to be analyzed), the sample 
points were transformed into units of time (s), the mean of the 
signal was subtracted, the signal was placed in absolute 
values, and a moving mean was applied at the same.  
Although most studies opt for a normalization of the 
contraction amplitude, we chose to obtain the values of the 
maximum peak amplitude (mV) of activation of each of the 
analyzed muscles and the time (s) in which they were in the 
activity, considering it as an advantage to be able to compare 
our results with the results of the previous study [16]. 
For the descriptive statistical treatment of data (mean and 
standard deviation) the Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences (SPSS) software, version 28, was used. 
III. 
RESULTS 
The information on the maximum amplitude peaks (mV) 
of each muscle and the time (s) at which they occur during 
the performance of activities are presented in Table III (ADLs 
for the midline) and in Table IV (ADLs for the side 
contralateral). Graphs are also presented that exemplify, in a 
subject, the signal obtained in each of the ADLs performed, 
Figures 1, 2 and 3 (ADLs directed to the midline) and Figures 
5 and 6 (ADLs directed to the contralateral side). It is verified 
in Table III that the ADLs directed to the midline (drinking 
from a glass, eating soup and brushing teeth) present a 
sequence of the average of the peaks of maximum amplitude 
of muscle activation that are different from each other, as well 
as the temporal sequence in which they occur also differs 
between them. 
The only similarity verified is related to the muscles that 
present greater amplitude peaks, that is, the AD, UT, and MD 
(drinking from a glass and eating soup are common). The 
activity of brushing the teeth has in common with the two 
previous activities the UT and the AD (Table III). 
Like with the previous activities, in Table IV, it is verified 
that ADLs directed to the contralateral side (washing the arm 
and brushing the hair) present a sequence of the average of 
the peaks of maximum amplitude of muscle activation that 
are also different from each other, as well as the temporal 
sequence in which they occur. The only similarity is the fact 
that the AD and UT are among the muscles that reach the 
highest amplitude peaks during the activity, as well as the PD 
and the LT among those that reach the lowest amplitude 
(Table IV).

Regarding the period in which the average peaks of 
maximum muscle activation amplitude are found during the 
activity, we can see in Table III that the ADLs directed to the 
midline occur between 2.24s and 5.05s. In the activity of 
drinking from a glass, they occur in the interval of 1.01s (2.42s 
± 0.08s and 3.43s ±0.28s), in eating the soup between 0.84s 
(2.24s ±0.22s and 3.08s ±0.30s) and brushing the teeth. 
between 1.5s (3.55s ±0.50s and 5.05s ±0.46s). 
In the ADLs directed to the contralateral side, it is verified 
in Table IV, that the averages of the maximum amplitude 
peaks of muscular activation occur between 1.46s and 2.25s. 
In the activity of arm washing, they occur in the interval of 
0.79s (1.46s ±0.71s and 2.20s ±2.67s), in brushing the hair 
between 0.4s (1.52s ±0.80s and 1.92s ±0.25s). 
Regarding the pattern of muscle amplitude activation, 
five graphs representing the muscle activation pattern of one 
of the subjects, for each of the five ADLs, are presented. In 
these graphs, in all activities, there is a phase corresponding 
to the increase in muscle activation amplitude, in which after

each muscle reaches it maximum amplitude (Tables III and 
IV), there is a decrease in it. This can be seen in Figure 1 
(drinking), Figure 2 (eating soup) and Figure 3 (brushing 
teeth), corresponding to ADLs directed to the midline. Figure 
4 (washing the arm) and Figure 5 (brushing the hair) concern 
ADLs directed to the contralateral side. 
IV. 
DISCUSSION AND CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE 
 
Regarding the analysis of the average times in which the 
maximum amplitude peaks occur, it is verified that in the 
ADLs directed to the midline, such as drinking or eating soup, 
the muscles reach an average of their maximum activation 
peaks at around 2 to 3 seconds. This reinforces the results of 
previous studies [16]. However, the same is not verified for 
the activity of brushing teeth, in which the time interval 
corresponding to the average in which the peaks of maximum 
amplitude occur is around 3 to 5 seconds (Table III). 
In ADLs directed to the contralateral side, the average 
time in which the peaks of amplitude occur are between 1 and 
2 seconds, which corroborates previous studies [16]. The 
results referring to the period in which the peaks occur are 
indicative that there are two marked phases in all activities. 
These phases are also represented in the graphs that constitute 
examples of the signal collected in each of the activities.  
The first phase, in which there is an increase in the 
amplitude of muscle activation, corresponds to an increase in 
contraction. A second phase follows, in which there is a 
decreased amplitude, that is, decreased muscle contraction.  
From ADLs directed to the midline and considering Table 
II, and other studies that mention these same phases of activity 
[11][16][24], it can be inferred that the contraction phase 
corresponds to the first four phases of activity, and the 
decreased contraction to the remaining phases.  
Regarding the ADLs directed to the contralateral side 
(Figures 4 and 5) and the phases of these same activities 
(Table II), it can be inferred that the contraction phase 
corresponds to the first three phases of the activity, and the 
decreased contraction to the remaining phases.  
In ADLs directed to the midline, the sequence of muscle 
amplitude activation peaks is different between the three 
activities (drinking, eating soup and brushing teeth) (Table 
III). 
This difference may be related to the different 
requirements of the activities themselves, in each of the 
phases. In each of the ADLs directed to the midline, there are 
different procedures, which leads us to infer that in the same 
phase, despite the same muscles being involved, the amount 
of muscle fibers that are recruited for the performance of that 
phase in each of the activities is different. The same happens 
with ADLs directed to the contralateral side, in which both 
activities are different in the sequence of mean values related 
to the maximum peaks. The sequence of the average of the 
peaks of activation of the maximum muscle amplitude is 
different between the two activities (washing the contralateral 
arm and brushing the hair), as shown in Table IV. 
To better understand this fact, it would be necessary to 
analyze the average values representative of the entire muscle 
activation amplitude during the activity and not just the 
average of the maximum activation peaks, or the graphs of 
only one subject in the sample. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION  
Although the shoulder muscle groups involved in ADLs 
are the same, the specifics of the activity point to the existence 
of different characteristics in the amplitude of muscle 
activation between the ADLs analyzed. Thus, the results are 
indicative of differences in the pattern of peak muscle 
activation amplitudes, as well as in the time sequence in which 
they occur, between ADLs directed to the midline, between 
ADLs directed to the contralateral side, as well as between 
these two groups of activities. 
There is a need for future work to understand these 
indications in a larger sample, with an average age closer to 
the average age of subjects with stroke and with data analysis 
that includes the normalization of the amplitude of muscle 
activation throughout the activities, relating it to a with the 
different phases of the activities. Another suggestion is the use 
of EMG in conjunction with other technologies, such as 
accelerometry and optoelectronic motion capture systems.  
This study thus contributed to establish a normative 
behavior of shoulder movements during ADLs in a healthy 
population, which, in the future, can be compared with the 
results using the same experimental protocol in patients with 
pathologies such as stroke.
