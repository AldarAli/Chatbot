Abstract—The zero-sum matrix, or in general, tensor, reveals
some consistent properties at multiplication. In this paper, three
mathematical rules are derived for multiplication involving such
entities. The application of these rules may provide for a more
concise and straightforward way to formulate mathematical
proofs that rely on such matrices.

INTRODUCTION
On the topic of rare matrices, some properties of a matrix,
here deﬁned as a zero-sum matrix, are analyzed and three rules
are derived governing multiplication involving such matrices.
The suggested category (the zero-sum matrix) does not seem
to presently exist, and is as expected neither included in lists,
such as [3]. In this paper, a zero-sum matrix is deﬁned as a
matrix where the sum of the column vectors is equal to a zero
column vector and/or the sum of the row vectors is equal to
a zero row vector, or in the general case, a zero-sum tensor
of size N1 × N2 × · · · × NQ, where summation along one,
or several dimensions, results in a P-dimensional tensor (with
P = Q − 1), that consists of zero-elements only. This rule
applies to any tensor T of dimension Q ∈ N2 (all integers
equal or greater than two). A matrix where the sum of the
columns and rows both are equal to zero vectors, could further
be deﬁned as a complete zero-sum matrix, and similarly in the
general case, a complete zero-sum tensor could be deﬁned as
a tensor where summation along all dimensions results in a
P-dimensional tensor that consists only of zero-elements.

An example of a zero-sum matrix is a regular n-simplex
matrix, based on the n-dimensional geometric object called
the n-simplex. A few examples are the 0-simplex (point),
the 1-simplex (line segment), the 2-simplex (triangle) and
the 3-simplex (tetrahedron). If the object is fully symmetric
(all edges are of equal length), it is called regular. Scaled
appropriately, the regular n-simplex exhibits the following
properties:
ti · tj =

1,
i = j
−1/n,
i ̸= j
(1)
n+1
X
i=1
ti = 0
(2)
where ti and tj with i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N} and N = n + 1
denote any unit vectors i and j pointing from the center of the
regular n-simplex to its i:th and j:th vertices. These properties
were conﬁrmed in [4] and [6] in context with an elementary
mathematical proof of the relation δ = arccos( 1
n), where δ
denotes the dihedral angle of the regular n-simplex. For n = 1,
t1 = −t2 = 1. For n = 2, as shown in Fig. 1:

In this example, the vectors ti spanning the coordinate system
of the regular n-simplex, are placed so that t1 coincides with
the x-axis.
As a brief overview, we start by the derivation of three
mathematical rules, followed by an example for the demon-
stration of Rule III (which is slightly more complex than the
other two), and ﬁnally conclude, by the application of Rule III
to reconﬁrm an already existing mathematical proof.

GENERAL CASE
The idea behind the derivation of the rules presented in this
paper originated from the evaluation of H = TT T in [1], with
the proposition of the extension of minimax [5], and alpha-beta
pruning [2], from the two-person case to the general N-person
case, which as a side effect led to the discovery of a new
elementary method for the calculation of the dihedral angle
of the regular n-simplex. The relation in (2), was used in this
context by Fridenfalk [1], to derive a generic algorithm for the
recursive calculation of T = [ t1 t2 . . . tN ], for N ∈ N2, with
N = n + 1:

An alternative and concise proof of the relation in (2)
follows by the derivation of Rule III in this paper. Before the
presentation of this rule, we start by the establishment of two
basic rules.
Rule I. Given the matrices A, B, and H of size M × N,
N × K, and M × K, respectively, such that H = AB, if sum
a of the row vectors of A, is equal to a zero row vector 0T
N
of size 1 × N, then sum u of the row vectors of H, is equal
to a zero row vector 0T
K of size 1 × K.
Proof. Given:
u =


b11(a11+...+aM1)+...+bN1(a1N+...+aMN)
b12(a11+...+aM1)+...+bN2(a1N+...+aMN)
...
b1K(a11+...+aM1)+...+bNK(a1N+...+aMN)


T
(6)
a = 0T
N → u = 0T
K.
■
Rule II. Given the matrices A, B, and H of size M × N,
N × K, and M × K, respectively, such that H = AB, if sum
b of the column vectors of B is equal to a zero column vector
0N of size N × 1, then sum v of the column vectors of H is
equal to 0M of size M × 1.
Proof 1. Given:
v =


a11(b11+...+b1K)+...+a1N(bN1+...+bNK)
a21(b11+...+b1K)+...+a2N(bN1+...+bNK)
...
aM1(b11+...+b1K)+...+aMN(bN1+...+bNK)


(7)
b = 0N → v = 0M.
■
Proof 2. Given Rule I and the rules for matrix transpose, H =
AB ⇔ HT = BT AT , thus, b = 0N → v = 0M.
■
Rule III. Given the real matrices A, B, and H of size M ×N,
N × M, and M × M, respectively, such that H = AB, if
A = BT , v, deﬁned as the sum of the column vectors of the
symmetric matrix H, is equal to a zero column vector 0M of
size M × 1, then b, deﬁned as the sum of the column vectors
of B, is equal to a zero column vector 0M of size M × 1.
Proof. Given (7), 1M = [1
1
. . .
1]T of size M × 1 and
s, a positive-deﬁnite scalar, equal to the sum of the elements
of the symmetric matrix H:
s = 1T
MH · 1M = 1T
Mv
(8)
as akj = bjk and v = 0M → s = PN
j=1(bj1 + bj2 + . . . +
bjM)2 = 0 → b = 0N, since:
s = 1T
Mv = 0 ⇒







b11 + b12 + . . . + b1M = 0
b21 + b22 + . . . + b2M = 0
...
bN1 + bN2 + . . . + bNM = 0
(9)
Thus, v = 0M → b = 0N.
■
Once u and v are derived, as shown in (6)-(7), the deriva-
tion of the ﬁrst two rules is straightforward. To concretize,
the following example demonstrates the third rule for a 2 × 3
matrix, B = AT . Given:
B =

a
b
c
d
e
f

(10)
If H = AB, 13 = [1
1
1]T and s = 1T
3 H · 13 = 1T
3 v,
then:
s = 1T
3
" a(a + b + c) + d(d + e + f)
b(a + b + c) + e(d + e + f)
c(a + b + c) + f(d + e + f)
#
= (a + b + c)2 + (d + e + f)2
(11)
Thus, v = 03 → s = (a+b+c)2+(d+e+f)2 = 0 → b = 02,
since s = 0 → a + b + c = d + e + f = 0. Or in other words,
if H = BT B is a 3 × 3 zero-sum matrix, then the sum of the
columns of B is a zero-vector of size 2 × 1.
III.
APPLICATION
As an example of the application of Rule III, given (1),
a new and a more straightforward proof of (2) is hereby
produced:
Proposition. The sum of the unit vectors ti of a regular n-
simplex, where each vector i points from the center of the
object to its i:th vertex, is equal to 0.
Proof. Given a n-simplex matrix T = [t1 t2 . . . tn+1], H =
TT T (of size n + 1 × n + 1), and:
hij = ti · tj =

1
i = j
−1/n
i ̸= j
(12)
given (1), where hij denotes an element in H. Thus, the sum of
any row (or column) in H is equal to 1 − 1
n · n = 0, and since
H is a (symmetric) zero-sum matrix, according to Rule III,
Pn+1
i=1 ti = 0.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, a zero-sum matrix (or tensor) has been closely
deﬁned, along with the related concept complete. Three rules
have been presented governing multiplications involving such
entities, along with an example of the application of Rule III
for a concise reconﬁrmation of (2), exempliﬁed in this paper
by a proposition.
