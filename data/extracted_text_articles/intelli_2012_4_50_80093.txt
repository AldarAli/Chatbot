Abstract—The problem of identifying and prioritizing various 
types 
of 
genetic 
markers 
including 
single 
nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), which are involved in human diseases 
such as cancer, is a one of primary challenge in current disease 
association studies. In this work, we propose a prioritization 
method, SNPRank that employs linkage disequilibrium (LD) 
network to improve the prioritization of candidate SNPs in 
disease association study. For the construction of LD network 
structure, we defined mutual links between SNPs based on r2 > 
0.6, and prioritized such SNPs that are linked to other highly 
ranked SNPs. For experiments, we applied our method to 
identify SNP markers associated with prostate cancers. The 
results showed that the proposed method can improve upon 
existing approaches by newly finding disease related SNPs which 
could not be identified by existing approaches.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
After completion of Human Genome Project in 2003 [1], 
most of researchers were interested in specific areas which are 
varied between individuals to individuals. Out of all the 
genetic variations, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, 
pronounced snip) is known to contribute to 90% of them with 
being almost uniformly distributed across the genome. The 
SNP is a DNA sequence variation occurring when a single 
nucleotide –A, T, G, or C- in genome (or other shared 
sequence) differs between members of a biological species [2]. 
In recent disease association study, the presence of certain 
SNPs is often used as a significant clue to identify gene 
markers which predispose individuals to specific diseases. 
That is, some SNPs can be involved in increasing the risk of 
human disease, although most SNPs are not responsible for 
causing a particular disease phenotype. Thus, the problem of 
identifying such SNPs that are associated with disease in 
humans is a major task of disease association studies. 
 In this paper, we have overviewed current existing 
methods such as single SNP analysis methods and introduced 
our new approach in order to solve existing approach 
problems. In last section, we have showed that by allowing the 
usage of LD based network construction, SNPRank improves 
the performance over the state-of-the-art ranking method such 
as GWAS approach [3]. 
II. 
RELATED METHODS 
.  Most of existing methods use single SNP analysis, which 
include a chi-square test, Fisher`s test and Cochrane-Armitage 
trend test [3]. In these approaches, candidate SNPs are ranked 
based on the statistical significance of the test and top few 
SNPs are chosen to be highly associated with the phenotype.  
A. Cochraen- Armitage Trend Test 
Cochrane-Artimage test for trend, named for William 
Cochran and Peter Artimage, is used in categorical data 
analysis when the aim is to assess for the presence of an 
association between a variable with two categories and 
variable with k categories [4].

Trend test statistic can be shown as in (1). In genetic 
application, the weight ti can be different according to genetic 
models described in [3]. In order to test allele is dominant A 
over allele B, the choice is: t = (1,1,0); if we assume Allele A 
is recessive to allele B, the choice is: t = (0,1,1).To test 
whether alleles A and B are codominant, the choice is: t = 
(0,1,2) [4]. In disease association study, the additive (or 
codominant) version of the test is mainly used. 
However, when number of SNPs are in millions, statistical 
significance of each SNP would be too small to rely on; this 
leads to the difficulty in finding significant SNPs in top ranked 
results. To solve such problems, in this work, we propose a 
new SNP ranking method, called SNPRank. 
III. 
PROPOSED METHOD ‘SNPRANK’ 
The newly proposed method SNPRank is taking some 
ideas from Google`s popular PageRank [5] algorithm. 
Adapting this concept in bioinformatics field was firstly 
attempted on gene expression data analysis with GeneRank [6] 
algorithm by Morrison et al. in 2005. Here, our method 
employs linkage disequilibrium [7][8] based network structure 
along with ordinary GWAS test result to produce an efficient 
prioritization of the SNPs in a disease association study. In 
particular, SNPRank method attempts to improve ranking 
results in such a way that relative ranking of a SNP makes it 
higher if it is linked to other highly connected SNPs.

A. LD Network Construction 
Network construction can be summarized into following 
steps. 
 
Order candidate SNPs according to chromosome 
position value  
 
Calculate LD values (r2) [7][8] between two SNPs 
 
Define each SNPs as nodes on network structure  
 
If r2 between two SNP is greater than the threshold add 
the edge between the SNPs to the network 
 
Build adjacent matrix for SNPRank 
 
Our aim here is to construct a network structure by using 
correlation between SNPs. The correlation between two SNPs 
can be estimated by using r square measurements [7][8], 
which can be obtained by using (2), between them.

where PA , PB , Pa , Pb are frequency of each allele and D is LD 
measurement defined by [6]. When the two alleles are not 
independent, we consider them to be in a state of linkage 
disequilibrium (LD). When the dependence between SNP is 
high, the two SNPs are considered to be in a state of high LD. 
After estimating the LD measurements we constructed network 
structure and considered each SNPs as nodes in the graph 
structure. We assumed there that there is an edge between 
SNPs if r2  between two SNP is greater than ≥ threshold. We 
have tried different threshold values in range of (0.2 to 0.9), see 
Table I. SNPs are presented as a node in network structure.  
From the network structure, we have built the adjacent 
matrix(4) structure which is used as an input in in our 
SNPRank.

is a control parameter which is to define the weight of network 
structure reflected to calculate ranking statistic. 
The value d = 0.80 is appears to be used by Google. From

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
A. Dataset 
For experiments, we have used dataset from GSE [8], which 
include genotype called data profiles of 20 prostate cancer 
tumors paired with normal samples for 500568 SNPs. For 
evaluation, we counted how many truly disease related SNPs 
are in top n-ranked result by using prostate cancer related gene 
list [9] as gold standard. That is, SNPs are considered 
biologically meaningful if its associated genes match with any 
one of gold standard genes [10]. 
B. Results 
To obtain better result, we implemented matching process 
in different ranges of parameter d and r2. The best 
improvement of performance was when r2 ≥ 0.6, d = 0.5 when 
comparing current approach. We have implemented SNPRank, 
when   r2 ≥ in range of [0.4 to 0.9] and d is in range [0 to 1]; if 
d = 0, the ranking returned is based on solely on the absolute 
value of Cochrane-Armitage test results for that SNP. For d = 
1, we return the ranking based on Linkage Disequilibrium 
Network connectivity. By setting d in the range [0 to 1], we 
interpolate between two extremes.

Since the choice of d =0.5 was suggested in original

we

sensitivity to the choice of r2. In Table I, column heads 
represent top rank SNPs in range of 100 to 500. We compared 
how many ‘gold standard’ genes are matched in top SNPs in 
two prioritization method classical Cochrane Rank and new 
SNPRank. We noted the best performance was when r2 ≥ 
0.6.To evaluate the performance for novel SNP identification 
we compared the SNP ids and its associated genes for 
SNPRank with GWAS Cochrane Test ranking. Comparison 
was performed for top 50 SNPs to 500 SNPs when r2 ≥ 0.6, d 
=0.5 in Table II.

CONCLUSION  
In this work, we have addressed the problem of ranking 
and prioritizing biomarkers called SNPs which are the most 
common form of genetic variations on the human genome, and 
they have been widely used as genetic markers for studying 
common and complex human diseases.  The tremendous 
number of SNPs, which is estimated at more than eleven 
million, poses new challenges for discovering and ranking 
procedures associated with such studies. Our purpose is to 
support effective disease association studies by providing 
operational prioritization methods for SNP markers based on 
both their allele frequency information and Linkage 
disequilibrium measurement. To achieve this purpose , we 
have proposed a novel integrative approach, SNPRank method, 
which allows us to combine linkage disequilibrium based SNP 
connectivities and conventional rank statistics to produce more 
robust SNP markers in disease association study, compared 
with traditional methods only based SNP genotype frequency. 
In particular, with d = 0.5 when r2 ≥ 0.6 is used, we observed 
no deterioration and overall improvement over original 
Cochrane-Armitage test results. Also, our new  method 
SNPRank incorporated with LD network structure was shown 
to improve GWAS performance by newly identifying some of 
truly disease related SNPs, which include rs4287583, 
r231150, rs34011899, rs10079737, rs9936929, rs5749939, and 
rs6560010. In addition, our SNPRank identified new genes 
(e.g., TRPS1, CDKN2A, CDH9, CDH13, MAPK1, DAPK1) 
in top ranks, which could not be identified by conventional 
approach.  
VI. 
FUTURE WORK 
The work described in this paper comprises one step toward 
the goal of identifying disease variants, SNP, which 
underlying human diseases. For extending the work, we are 
interested in conducting simulation studies to examine the 
performance of the proposed method under various genomic 
experimental conditions, e.g., using the Next Generation 
Sequencing data.  Finally, we mention the main lines of 
research of  prioritizing genetic variation for certain disease 
will be still remain open for us after finishing this paper.  In 
future, our particular would be using Next Generation 
Sequencing methods for identifying and prioritizing bio-
markers in common and complex human disease.
