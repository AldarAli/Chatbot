Abstract—In this paper, a new methodology of linguistic 
threshold 
schemes 
application 
for 
secure 
information 
distribution and management in Cloud Computing will be 
presented. Linguistic threshold schemes were proposed as 
extension protocols dedicated for secure information splitting 
and hierarchical management in different information 
structures. Currently, Cloud Computing infrastructure offers 
different resources and services virtualization and distribution, 
so one of the promising solutions is application of linguistic 
schemes for splitting of classified information or remote 
application execution, based on personal accessing grants. The 
essence of the presented approach is the application of a 
personally defined formal language, which allows splitting and 
securely managing strategic data in Cloud Computing. An 
example of the application of linguistic threshold procedure 
will also be presented.

INTRODUCTION 
One of the emerging problems in data and services 
security 
is 
high 
level 
confidentiality 
and 
secrecy 
management in Cloud Computing infrastructure. Security 
management tasks related to distributed data shares have 
been intensively developed for various communication 
infrastructures [3][4][14][16][18]. In this contribution, we 
will describe the most important aspect related to the use of 
linguistic models for secrecy management thanks to the 
creation of a new secure information management protocol. 
Such new protocol will be based on mathematical linguistic 
techniques applied for information sharing and encoding, 
and called linguistic threshold schemes [13]. 
Mathematical linguistic formalisms have been proposed 
for computer modeling of natural languages, but later, in 
addition to such applications, other important areas of 
application appeared. All possible areas of application of 
such techniques cover: 
 
• 
Natural languages description and modeling; 
• 
Compiler construction; 
• 
Pattern classification [6]; 
• 
Cognitive analysis [7][8]. 
 
Recently, a new field for applying such techniques 
appeared, and was connected with advanced algorithms for 
information sharing [13][14][15]. The paper is organized as 
follows: Section 2 presents the general idea of using 
linguistic formalisms in creating threshold schemes. In 
Section 3, we will present an illustrative example showing 
how information may be divided using such procedures and 
distributed in the cloud. In Section 4, some concluding 
remarks will be presented. 
II. 
LINGUISTIC APPROACH FOR DATA AND SERVICES 
MANAGEMENT 
Secure data and services distribution and management 
are very challenging tasks. For this purpose, we will consider 
the distributed approach, in which each node will execute 
different information parts or store different service 
resources. To distribute information in a hierarchical manner, 
linguistic schemes may be applied [1][2][8][9]. 
The general methodology of such protocol is as follows: 
 
• 
Data sharing schemes should be selected for a 
particular infrastructure or information management 
in the cloud; 
• 
The secret data or strategic information should be 
converted to the bit notation; 
• 
A formal grammar should be introduced to define a 
new linguistic representation; 
• 
The linguistic representation is divided using the 
threshold procedure; 
• 
Secret parts may be distributed among different 
instances in the cloud (Figure 1). 
 
In such a procedure, the divided data or service 
information [7] distributed over the cloud infrastructure may 
have a different representation, e.g. in the form of bit blocks 
with various length or in the form of small images, text 
sequences, etc. 
A procedure which allows generating secret parts of any 
shared information may be realized in the following way: 
 
• 
Select appropriate classes of linguistic schemes used 
for considered data sharing [11]; 
• 
Create a linguistic representation of shared data [10];

• 
Define a grammar generating data shadows (secret 
parts); 
• 
Distribute generated parts of secret data between 
different instances.

The most important feature of the presented protocol is 
the possibility to use some personal information or encoding 
keys for the divided information representation during the 
encoding stage. This means that we can rely on using unique 
digital sequences or approaches for encoding particular bits 
or bit blocks of shared information [12][13].  
A generalized grammar capable of converting blocks of 
information to a new representation, which constitutes the 
shared secret at subsequent stages, can be found in [14]. 
An introduction for encoding grammar makes it quicker 
to re-code the input representation of the shared information, 
which will then be split among different authorized 
instances. An example of generating data shares using this 
approach is presented in Figure 2. 
Such a procedure of information splitting in the Cloud 
infrastructure allows distributing data which are not available 
to all instances to be securely delivered to trusted instances. 
The security features of secret splitting algorithms are due to 
using cryptographic information encryption at the stage of 
developing these secret parts. The specialized protocols 
guarantee the security of the entire splitting process, namely, 
information 
encryption, 
its 
splitting, 
and 
later, 
its 
reconstruction [13].  
III. 
INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION IN THE CLOUD 
In this section, an example of encrypting and 
reconstructing secret information will be presented. The 
secret data will have the text form containing the title of this 
paper, i.e., “Secure Information and Services Management in 
the Cloud”. 
This information can be shared in the way presented in 
Figure 3, by using a linguistic threshold procedure. 
This information may also be presented in a binary form, 
with 5-bit long blocks marked. Bit blocks of this length will 
then be coded using a defined grammar.

The length of bit blocks is equal to 4, and the shares are generated using a 3, 5-threshold approach.

Thus, the bit representation of the secret takes the 
following form (Figure 3(A)): 
 
01010 01101 10010 10110 00110 11101 01011 10010 01100 
10100 10000 00100 10010 11011 10011 00110 01101 11101 11001 
00110 11010 11000 01011 10100 01101 00101 10111 10110 11100 
01000 00011 00001 01101 11001 10010 00010 00000 10100 11011 
00101 01110 01001 11011 00110 10010 11000 11011 00101 01110 
01100 10000 00100 11010 11000 01011 01110 01100 00101 10011 
10110 01010 11011 01011 00101 01101 11001 11010 00010 00000 
11010 01011 01110 00100 00001 11010 00110 10000 11001 01001 
00000 01000 01101 10110 00110 11110 11101 01011 00100 
 
In order to encode such a digital sequence, a special 
context-free grammar should be defined, which allows to 
encode 5-bit block using terminal symbols [13].  
From the security point of view, the grammar and the 
length of terminal symbols remain secret, but known only to 
the instances that generate and distribute secret parts. For the 
obtained bit representation of the secret, and the defined 
grammar, a syntactic analysis should be performed, which 
will generate a new sequence containing the numbers of 
grammar rules. Such grammar rules allow generating the bit 
sequence using terminal and non-terminal symbols. This 
sequence of production numbers has the following form 
(Figure 3(B)). For our secret information, the sequence of 
grammar rules has the following form: 
 
111419230730121913211705192820071430260727251221140
624232909040214261903012128061510280719252806151317052
725121513062023112812061426270301271215050227071726100
1091423073130120533 
 
Such new representation of the secret in the form of a 
sequence of production numbers is the basis for further steps 
of information sharing using the selected threshold 
algorithm. For this, a large prime number should be 
generated (Figure 3(C)). 
Then, we use the sharing algorithm to share the secret 
using a (3, 6) threshold scheme. This means that 6 shares of 
the secret are generated, but to reconstruct it again it will be 
necessary to combine at least 3 freely selected shares (Figure 
3(D)). For our example, the generated shadows are presented 
in Figure 3(E). 
The trusted instance which executes the secret procedure 
can distribute the obtained shares among authorized persons 
or instances. 
The reconstruction of the original information distributed 
between the authorized instances may be realized in the way 
described below. 
At the beginning, the selection of the necessary number 
of secret shares must be performed. In our case, we collect at 
least 
three 
shadows 
(Figure 
3(E)), 
which 
allow 
reconstructing the original input sequence, which is really 
the sequence of production rules presented in Figure 3(F). 
In the next step, the rules of the defined grammar should 
be applied to the sequence obtained above and the 
production numbers should be replaced with bit sequences 
represented by these rules. This produces the previous binary 
representation of the originally shared secret information. 
The instance, which is necessary to restore the secret, 
uses their knowledge of the grammar employed to encrypt 
the information and converts the sequence of production 
numbers obtained in the previous stage into a binary 
representation of the secret presented in Figure 3(G). 
At the end of the secret reconstruction process, the 
managing instance reconstructs the final secret information 
having the form of letters, digits or other characters using 
information about the coding method in the given system. 
This allows the original secret to be reconstructed as 
presented in Figure 3(H).

At the same time, it is worth noting that if the required 
number of shares of the divided information necessary to 
restore it is not selected when restoring the secret, the use of 
the threshold scheme will not generate the sequence of 
production numbers of our grammar, but some nonsensical 
information that cannot be converted into a meaningful text.  
The linguistic threshold procedure is very universal and 
may have many different applications. The main application 
is related to intelligent secret data distribution in hierarchical 
management structures [6][16][18]. In such management 
models, at each level in the management pyramid, particular 
secret data may be divided in different manners depending 
on the level, number of trusted persons and accessing grants 
to secret information. 
Such protocols may also play an important role in secret 
data distribution in cloud infrastructures. In such case, 
storing different secret parts on different cloud servers will 
affect for information confidentiality and security of 
transmission over the distributed networks. Such features are 
especially important in storing and managing a big data or 
large information repositories. The efficiency of linguistic 
threshold procedures was evaluated in [13]. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
We presented a new protocol for digital information 
sharing and distribution in cloud infrastructure. In particular, 
we proposed a new scheme for secret division and 
distribution between trusted instances, based on linguistic 
threshold procedures. The secret parts of the divided 
information may be obtained using the linguistic threshold 
procedure presented in this paper, which allows sharing data 
using formal grammars in a more general way than in DNA 
cryptography [11]. Such a method of information encoding 
and sharing may define new areas in cryptography and 
security called cognitive cryptography. The presented 
approach seems to be very useful in efficient information 
management in Cloud infrastructures [15][17]. 
The main difference between the presented linguistic 
approach and classic encoding cryptographic procedures is 
that our protocol is a high level sharing algorithm, allowing 
the generation of secret parts using both traditional threshold 
procedures as well as specially defined (by splitter or user) 
grammar. This grammar allows controlling the sharing stage 
in the manner defined by the splitter. The whole protocol is 
secure and efficient in generating secret parts of information 
[3][4][5]. The grammar may also influence the security level 
in this protocol. If the grammar is more complex the 
cryptanalysis will be more difficult because it will be 
necessary to determine the larger number of applied 
grammar rules.  
The presented approach has also a great number of 
possible application, especially in solving practical security 
related and management problems. In particular, it is 
dedicated to dividing secret or classified information and 
distribute it in a secure manner between trusted parties. It 
guarantees not only security and confidentiality of 
information, but also prevents against insider treats or 
unauthorized access for strategic data stored in Cloud 
Computing infrastructure or distributed architectures.
