Abstract—This paper addresses a novel Alamouti coding
scheme for asynchronous cooperative communication systems
over frequency selective fading channels. In the proposed scheme,
the Alamouti coded form at the destination node is constructed
through a simple combination of symbols at the source node,
instead of the time-reversal operation at the relay nodes used
in the conventional scheme. Numerical results show that the
proposed scheme achieves a higher order cooperative diversity
than that of the conventional scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
A spatial diversity is an efﬁcient technique to improve the
reliability of transmission in wireless environments [1]. The
classical approach for achieving the spatial diversity is to use
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems employing
multiple antennas at transmitter and receiver. However, due to
the limitations of size, cost, and power, it may be impractical
to accommodate multiple antennas on mobile devices [2].
Cooperative communication systems can provide the spatial
diversity referred to as the cooperative diversity by forming the
virtual MIMO systems via distributed nodes with only a single
antenna, thus overcoming the limitations of MIMO systems
[3], [4]. In the cooperative communication systems, however,
symbols from different nodes are received at different time
instants, resulting in an asynchronous environment. Several
transmission schemes have been presented to achieve the
cooperative diversity for the asynchronous cooperative com-
munications [5]-[8]; however, they are difﬁcult to implement
since a symbol decoding step is required at the relay nodes. In
[9], a transmission scheme without any symbol decoding step
at the relay nodes has been proposed for the asynchronous
cooperative communications. The scheme in [9] can construct
the well-known Alamouti coded form at the destination node
using only the simple time-reversal and conjugate operations at
the relay nodes, achieving the cooperative diversity. However,
in the frequency selective fading channels, bit error rate (BER)
performance of the scheme in [9] signiﬁcantly degrades since
the decoding process at the destination node is not able to

construct the Alamouti coded form due to the multipath com-
ponents. Recently, in [10], a modiﬁed version of the scheme
in [9] has been introduced for the asynchronous cooperative
communications, combating the inﬂuence of the frequency
selective fading channels. With the modiﬁed operations at the
relay nodes, each relay node performs either time-reversal
or conjugate operation only, the scheme in [10] overcomes
the inﬂuence of the frequency selective fading channels, and
thus, the Alamouti coded form is constructed at the destination
node.
In this paper, we propose a novel Alamouti coding scheme
for asynchronous cooperative communication systems over
the frequency selective fading channels. By transmitting the
combinations of the data symbols at the source node, the
proposed scheme achieves a higher order cooperative diversity
than that of the conventional scheme in [10], where each
data symbol passes through the different channel. It is also
demonstrated that the proposed scheme provides a higher
order cooperative diversity, and thus, better BER performance
than the conventional scheme in [10]. The rest of this paper
is organized as follows. Section II introduces the system
model of the cooperative systems. The conventional scheme
is explained in Section III. In Section IV, a novel coopera-
tive transmission scheme is proposed. Simulation results are
presented in Section V, and conclusion is given in Section VI.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
Fig. 1 illustrates a cooperative system model with one
source node S, one destination node D, and two relay nodes
R1 and R2, where each node has a single antenna.
It is assumed that the channels between the source node
and each relay node and between each relay node and the
destination node are frequency selective fading channels with
L and Q independent propagation paths, respectively. Then,
the nth channel impulse response coefﬁcient hSRm(n) from
the source node to the mth relay node can be expressed as
hSRm(n) =
L−1
∑
l=0
αSRm,lδ(n − τSRm,l),
(1)
where δ(n) denotes the delta function, and αSRm,l and τSRm,l
are the channel coefﬁcient and path delay of the lth propaga-
tion path from the source node to the mth relay node, respec-
tively. Similarly, the nth channel impulse response coefﬁcient
hRmD(n) from the mth relay node to the destination node can
be expressed as
hRmD(n) =
Q−1
∑
q=0
αRmD,qδ(n − τRmD,q),
(2)
where αRmD,q and τRmD,q are the channel coefﬁcient and
path delay of the qth propagation path from the mth relay node
to the destination node, respectively. The channel coefﬁcients
αSRm,l and αRmD,q are modeled as complex Gaussian random
variables with mean zero and variance σ2
SRm,l and σ2
RmD,q,
respectively, where ∑L−1
l=0 σ2
SRm,l = ∑Q−1
q=0 σ2
RmD,q = 1. It
is assumed that the channel coefﬁcients and path delays are
constant during two orthogonal frequency division multiplex-
ing (OFDM) symbol intervals, and a relative timing difference
between the symbols arriving at the destination node from the
relay nodes R1 and R2 is denoted by τ.
III. CONVENTIONAL SCHEME
In the conventional scheme [10], ﬁrst, the source node gen-
erates the following two complex-valued data symbol blocks
X1 and X2:
Xi = [Xi(0), Xi(1), · · ·, Xi(N − 1)]T
, for i = 1 and 2, (3)
where Xi(k) and (·)T denote the complex-valued phase shift
keying (PSK) or quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
data symbol on the kth sub-carrier of Xi and the transpose
operation, respectively, and N is the number of the sub-
carriers. For transmission from the source node to the relay
nodes, complex-valued baseband samples are generated as
xi(n) = DFTN{Xi}
=
√
1
N
N−1
∑
k=0
Xi(k)e−j2πkn/N, for n = 0, · · ·, N − 1,
(4)
where DFTN(·) denotes the N-point discrete Fourier trans-
form (DFT). Then, the ith OFDM symbol si is obtained as
si = [si(0), si(1), · · ·, si(Ls − 1)]T
= [xi(N − NG), xi(N − NG + 1), · · ·, xi(N − 1),
xi(0), · · ·, xi(N − 1)]T
(5)
by inserting the cyclic prefex (CP), where Ls ≜ N +NG with
NG the length of CP. It is assumed that NG is longer than the
sum of total propagation path delay from the source node to the
destination node and the maximum relative timing difference
at the destination node. Next, the source node transmits two
consecutive OFDM symbols to the relay nodes, and then, the
ith received symbol ri,m of the mth relay node can be written
as
ri,m =
√
P1 si∗hSRm + ni,m,
(6)
where P1 is the transmission power at the source node,
hSRm = [αSRm,0, αSRm,1, · · ·, αSRm,L−1]T is the L × 1
impulse response vector of the channel between the source
node and the mth relay node, ni,m is the additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) vector with zero mean and unit
variance added to the ith received symbol of the mth relay
node, and ∗ denotes the linear convolution.
Each relay node allows the Alamouti coded form to be
constructed at the destination node by transmitting symbol
esi,m obtained as in Table I to the destination node during two
consecutive time slots, where esi,m, P2, ζ(·), and (·)∗ denote
the ith transmit symbol of the mth relay node, the transmis-
sion power at the relay nodes, time-reversal operation, and
conjugate operation, respectively. The time-reversal operation
ζ(·) is given by
ζ{ri,m(n)} =
{ ri,m(0),
for n = 0
ri,m(Ls − n),
for n = 1, · · ·, Ls − 1,
(7)
where ri,m(n) denotes the nth sample of ri,m.
At the destination node, as in general OFDM systems, the
CP is removed ﬁrst for each received symbol. After the CP
removal, the last τ1
′ = NG − (max(τSR1,l) − 1) samples of
the received symbols are shifted to the front of the received
symbols. Then, after the CP removal and sample shifting
process, the received symbols can be expressed as

IV. PROPOSED SCHEME
Combining the complex-valued data symbol blocks X1 and
X2, the source node ﬁrst generates the following four symbol
blocks C1, C2, C3, and C4:
Cd = [Cd(0), Cd(1), · · ·, Cd(N − 1)]T
,
for d = 1, 2, 3, and 4
(15)

(16)
where Cd(k) denotes the complex-valued data symbol on the
kth sub-carrier of Cd. The generated symbol blocks satisfy
the following property used in the processes at the destination
node:
jCd =
{ C∗
d+1,
when d = 1 and 3
C∗
d−1,
when d = 2 and 4.
(17)
Then, complex-valued baseband samples corresponding to Cd
are generated as
cd(n) = IDFTN{Cd}

N
N−1
∑
k=0
Cd(k)ej2πkn/N, for n = 0, · · ·, N − 1
(18)
for transmission from the source node to the relay nodes, and
the dth OFDM symbol ud is obtained as
ud = [ud(0), ud(1), · · ·, ud(Ls − 1)]T
= [cd(N − NG), cd(N − NG + 1), · · ·, cd(N − 1),
cd(0), · · ·, cd(N − 1)]T
(19)
by inserting the CP. Next, the source node transmits four
consecutive OFDM symbols to the relay nodes, and thus, the
dth received symbol vd,m of the mth relay node can be written
as
vd,m =
{ √
P1/2 ud∗hSRm + nd,m,
when d = 1 and 2
√
P1/2 ud∗gSRm + nd,m,
when d = 3 and 4,
(20)
where nd,m is the AWGN vector with zero mean and unit
variance added to the dth received symbol of the mth re-
lay node. Unlike the conventional scheme transmitting two
OFDM symbols at the source node with the transmission
power of P1, the proposed scheme transmits four OFDM
symbols at the source node with the transmission power of
P1/2, that is, the total transmission power of the proposed
scheme is the same as that of the conventional scheme.
gSRm
= [βSRm,0, βSRm,1, · · ·, βSRm,L−1]T is the L × 1
impulse response vector of the channel between the source
node and the mth relay node for the last two transmit symbols

(d = 3 and 4), where the channel coefﬁcient βSRm,l has
the same distribution as the αSRm,l of hSRm. Similarly, the
impulse response vector gRmD of the channel between the
mth relay nodes and the destination node for the last two
transmit symbols is the Q × 1 vector deﬁned as gRmD =
[βRmD,0, βRmD,1, · · ·, βRmD,Q−1]T , where the channel coef-
ﬁcient βRmD,q has the same distribution as the αRmD,q of
hRmD. That means the channels are constant during the ﬁrst
two transmit symbol intervals and the last two transmit symbol
intervals, respectively.
Finally, each relay node allows the Alamouti coded form to
be constructed at the destination node by transmitting symbol
eud,m obtained as in Table II to the destination node during
four consecutive time slots, where eud,m is the dth transmit
symbol of the mth relay node.
Now, without loss of generality, we describe the demod-
ulation and decoding steps at the destination node with the
received symbols during the ﬁrst two time slots (that is,
the received symbols during the last two time slots can be
demodulated and decoded in the same manner). After the CP
removal, the received symbols can be expressed as

where G1,p and G2,p denote noise term of Y1(k) and Y2(k),

where H1,p (k) = HSR1,p(k)HR1D,p(k) and H2,p (k) =
HSR2,p(k)HR2D,p(k)e−j2πkτ/N. Clearly, the channel matrix
Hp(k) is the Alamouti coded form, and thus, we can obtain
the estimates bC1(k) and bC2(k) as

for C1(k) and C2(k), respectively. The estimates bC3(k) and
bC4(k) corresponding to C3(k) and C4(k), respectively, can be
obtained in the same manner.
Lastly, we can obtain the estimates b
X1(k) and b
X2(k) as

Re{·} and Im{·} denote real and imaginary parts, respectively.
From (27), we can see that
bC1(k) and
bC2(k) ( bC3(k)
and bC4(k)) are obtained from Y1(k) and Y ∗
2 (k) (Y3(k) and
Y ∗

symbols to demodulate two data symbol blocks, resulting
in a trade-off between the cooperative diversity order and
transmission rate. Speciﬁcally, the proposed scheme has the
half transmission rate compared with the conventional scheme,
while achieving the higher diversity order by averaging more
channels.

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
In this section, the proposed scheme is compared with the
conventional scheme in terms of the BER over the frequency
selective fading channels. In evaluating the performance, we
assume the following parameters as in [10], [11]: an FFT size
of N = 64 samples, a CP length of NG = 16 samples, binary
PSK data modulation. The transmission power at the source
node P1 and at the relay nodes P2 are assumed as P1 = 2P2.
It is also assumed that the channel has a two path equal-power
delay proﬁle with a relative delay of 3 samples between the
two paths, and the relative timing difference τ between the
symbols arriving at the destination node from the relay nodes
is distributed uniformly over [0, 6] samples. From Fig. 2, it is
clearly observed that, the conventional scheme demonstrates
the same slope of the BER curve as that of the Alamouti
scheme for 2×1 multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems
when the value of P1 is large, meanwhile, the proposed scheme
shows the same slope of the BER curve as that of the Alamouti
scheme for 2×2 MIMO systems, which demonstrates that the
proposed scheme achieves a higher order cooperative diversity
than that of the conventional scheme. This is due to the fact
that, by transmitting the combinations of the data symbols at
the source node, each data symbol undergoes more channels
than the conventional scheme, and thus, the proposed scheme
achieves a higher order cooperative diversity than that of the
conventional scheme by averaging more channels than the
conventional scheme. From the ﬁgure, it is also shown that
the BER performance of the proposed (conventional) scheme
is degraded compared to the 2×2 MIMO (2×1 MISO) systems
while achieving the same order of cooperative diversity. This
is due to the fact that the signal is contaminated by noise at
both channels between source and relay nodes and relay and
destination nodes in the cooperative communication systems,
meanwhile, in the MIMO (MISO) systems, the noise is added
at the channels between transmitter and receiver only.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a novel Alamouti coding
scheme for asynchronous cooperative communication sys-
tems over frequency selective fading channels. The proposed
scheme construct the Alamouti coded form at the destination
node by using a simple combination of symbols at the source
node, resulting in achieving a higher cooperative diversity than
the conventional scheme. From the simulation results, it is
conﬁrmed that the proposed scheme provides a higher order
cooperative diversity than that of the conventional scheme.
