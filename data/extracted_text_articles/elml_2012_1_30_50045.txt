Abstract— Games are increasingly recognized for their 
educational potential. However, when used as a learning 
resource, games can differ substantially from other educational 
media. They often combine high-fidelity audio and video 
content with experiential, social, or exploratory pedagogy. As 
educators increasingly turn to technology to support the 
delivery and management of content, the capability to describe 
and package serious games effectively as reusable learning 
objects (LOs) is increasingly vital. Doing so requires 
developing the capability to express games not in terms of 
technical boundaries, but as coherent and discrete LOs, which 
can be reused and combined. Enabling this requires metadata 
be attached to games, whilst making the metadata schema 
explicit to allow the use of the metadata beyond its original 
scope. Furthermore, standardisation of metadata schema 
means that systems are able to work together and use data 
interchangeably. However, current standards for describing 
educational content cannot directly be utilized to describe these 
serious games as educational resources. This makes it difficult 
to include serious games in repositories of learning objects and 
to describe them in a coherent way in the various online 
repositories. This paper introduces a metadata schema for 
describing serious games as educational resources, based on 
existing standards, so that serious games content can be 
described within online repositories.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Experts are increasingly recognizing the educational 
potential of serious games [1] and their use has been growing 
over recent years. Serious games can provide learning 
environments, which studies have shown can enhance 
efficacy over traditional learning [2]. According to Norman 
and Spohrer [3] a learner’s motivation makes more 
difference to the learning outcome than any other factor. An 
advantage of computer-based instruction is that it can engage 
learners, particularly though its support of high-frequency 
feedback in novel forms [4]. Serious games often combine 
high fidelity audio or video with elements of game play, in 
order to offer a more immersive learning experience that 
provides even higher levels of engagement and direct 
feedback than more traditional computer-based learning 
materials. 
The potential of computer-based education has been well 
established [3] and indeed various standard metadata 
schemas have been developed [5] to describe digital 
educational resources in a coherent way. The use of 
standards means that materials can be used and re-used 
across platforms and systems. However these standards are 
not capable of capturing serious games fully, missing out 
important aspects, such as the context a particular game can 
be used in, and what type of learner and age group it is 
suitable for. The most important aspect is pedagogic; 
particularly as serious games are often shown to work most 
effectively when blended with other instructional techniques 
and resources [6], [7] and the same may fit in different 
blended scenarios. Whilst standards exist, there are no 
general and complete standards for describing serious games 
as educational resources. Developing games is a complex 
and costly affair; games have been shown to work best in a 
blended approach and repurposing games is complicated as 
there is not always a one to one relationship between serious 
games and learning goals [8]. Therefore, it is essential to 
have the interoperability 
between 
different learning 
platforms and metadata standards. Torrente and colleagues 
[9] attempted to export games to self-contained Learning 
Objects (LO), which could be easily distributed through any 
Learning Management System (LMS) compliant with the 
current interoperability standards. 
However, when attempting to create descriptions of 
serious games in a comprehensive interoperable manner, a 
standard is required. As such a standard does not currently 
exist, the authors of this paper propose a metadata schema 
for describing serious games as educational resources, based 
on existing metadata standards and a comprehensive four 
dimensional framework for evaluating serious games 
proposed in [10], [11]. The work is based on work around 
creating an educational metadata schema and repurposing of 
serious games in the mEducator project and, defining a rating 
tool for serious games in the EduGameLab project. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. While it is 
beyond the scope of this paper to list all existing educational 
standards, Section II introduces a few related metadata

standards. Framework for evaluating serious games as well 
as categorisations and classifications of games and their 
learning experience are briefly reviewed in section III, 
section IV describes standards for managing and describing 
competencies, section V introduces the proposed metadata 
schema and finally section VI outlines our plans for testing 
the proposed schema. 
II. 
METADATA STANDARDS 
In this section, we briefly review established Metadata 
Standards from the field of Technology Enhanced Learning, 
to identify possible candidates to base our metadata schema 
on. 
A. IEEE LOM 
When attempting to create a metadata schema for 
comprehensive descriptions of serious games in an 
interoperable manner, the starting point must be existing 
metadata standards. A well-known standard for educational 
resources, called learning objects, is the IEEE Learning 
Object Metadata (LOM) [12], [13] specification. LOM 
defines a number of vocabularies for describing pedagogical 
attributes of resources. It includes, for example, attributes 
like resource type, level of interactivity, semantic density, 
difficulty and description. In addition, LOM encapsulates the 
Dublin Core [14] elements. Dublin Core is a cross-
disciplinary standard for describing a wide range of 
networked resources [15]. It consists of two levels: Simple 
and Qualified. Simple Dublin Core describes objects using 
15 simple elements [14] like the Title, Creator and Subject. 
Qualified Dublin Core adds a group of element qualifiers and 
three additional elements: Audience, Provenance and 
RightsHolder.  
Serious games are, however, different from most other 
educational resources as they often offer a game play 
delivery using high fidelity audio and media and can use a 
variety of different pedagogical approaches. LOM does not 
have the attributes to describe these aspects. However, 
serious games may be exported into self-contained Learning 
Objects (LO) that can then be combined into larger 
units/courses. 
B. Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 
The Sharable Content Object Reference Model aims to 
bring together previous e-learning standards in a single 
distributable package and forms a structured design pattern 
around the creation of interchangeable educational material. 
SCORM uses IMS Content Packaging [16] for distributing 
its content and consists of the following parts.  
 
• A Content Aggregation Model defining the components 
used to build a learning experience from learning resources, 
and how they are aggregated and organised in units of 
instruction. 
• Assets representing a collection of media. This collection is 
called a Sharable Content Object (SCO) if it represents a 
single learning resource. 
• An activity, which is a unit of learning, may provide an 
asset or be composed of sub-activities. 
 
While games can be included in a SCORM package, there 
are no separate facilities for describing serious games. 
Therefore there is no particular standard way of including 
them. 
C. IMS Learning Design (IMS-LD) 
IMS Learning Design (IMS LD) [17] was developed by 
the Open University of the Netherlands and released as a 
standard by the IMS consortium in 2003. IMS LD is a meta 
language that evolved from the Educational Modeling 
Language (EML). There are various activities called acts and 
people can have different roles. Activities and are conducted 
in an environment that is composed of several learning 
objects called Units of Learning. There are three levels (A, B 
and C), in increasing complexity and several players have 
been developed, such as CopperCore [18] and .LRN [19]. 
.LRN is integrated into a learning management system. 
However there is no native support for serious games. The 
XML-based format can describe a game only in general 
learning object terms. 
III. 
EVALUATION FRAMEWORKS AND CLASSIFICATIONS 
OF SERIOUS GAMES 
In this section, we briefly review established frameworks 
and classification methods for serious games. Our proposed 
metadata scheme is based on the elements used in the 
evaluation and classification in these frameworks.  
A. Four Dimensional Framework  
The four dimensional framework, which emerged from 
user studies, has been proposed previously in [10], [11] and 
its value has been shown in a number of studies since 
[20][18], [21]. The framework for evaluating serious games 
proposes four dimensions: the learner, the pedagogic models 
used, the representation used and the context, in which the 
learning takes place. The table below shows the framework 
schematically. Since the framework is an established 
framework for evaluating serious games, the metadata 
schema proposed in Section V should be able to express this 
evaluation.

The learner specifics dimension involves profiling and 
modelling the learner to ensure a close match between 
learning activities and the required outcomes. The second 
dimension analyses the pedagogic perspective of the learning 
activities in the serious games such as the kinds of learning 
and teaching models. The third dimension is the 
representation, how active the learning experience needs to 
15

be, what levels of fidelity are required and how immersive 
the experience needs to be. Finally, the context describes 
where the learning is taking place, what resources the learner 
has access to but also the topic being studied. The context the 
game is used in can vary and different evaluators may 
evaluate the game differently depending on their own 
experiences. Therefore, one game can have multiple 
evaluations. 
B. Different Types and Styles of Games 
Mark Prensky proposes a classification of games [22] 
based on diverse content perspectives, shown in Table II. 
While his work is controversial and this classification does 
not provide a comprehensive evaluation framework, it does 
show how games can be classified in terms of the different 
types of content. The learning activities are related to the 
pedagogy dimension and the game styles are related to the 
representation dimension. The classification of games does 
not take into account any specifics of the learner, as it does 
not seek to evaluate its use with particular learners but is 
merely intended to group games in categories. 
Sawyer and Smith [23] have created taxonomy of serious 
games by distinguishing into 6 categories, Games for Health, 
Advergames (games for advertising), Games for Training, 
Games for Education, Games for Science and Research, 
Production Games as Work. However, they noted that this is 
work in progress and it can continuously be modified. This 
taxonomy again is focusing more on the content of the 
games and does not focus on the learning needs of the 
user/learner. However, they are associating these categories 
with the areas of application such as Government and NGO, 
Defence, Healthcare, Marketing and Communication, 
Education, Corporate and Industry creating a matrix like 
taxonomy. 
Similarly, Alvarez and Rampnoux [24] have attempted to 
classify serious games in 5 main categories: Advergaming, 
Edutainment, 
Edumarket 
game, 
Diverted 
game and 
Simulation game. 
C. Learning Objectives Based Game Classification 
Educational games can be produced as self-contained 
distributable Learning Objects (LO) [9] in support for the 
principles of the LO model [12], [13] that deploys the 
learning contents as small self-contained objects that can 
then be combined into larger units/courses. However, 
particular challenges exist when considering games, which 
might address multiple learning objectives, and therefore by 
definition encapsulate multiple LOs, or games, which are 
blended with other materials, and therefore to function as a 
repurposable LO require these materials to be included. 
Standardized formats should be used to store and distribute 
learning objects, allowing the content to be reused across 
platforms and contexts. Pivec and Moretti [25] have 
introduced a Learning Objectives-based classification for 
serious games. The classification describes a definition of 
the game, the features required, the typology and number of 
players. The Learning Objectives can be classified in the 
following groups. 
• 
Memory/Repetition/Retention (factual knowledge) 
• 
Dexterity/Spread/Precision (sensorial/dexterous  
knowledge) 
• 
Applying Concepts/Rules (translate knowledge into new 
context; use information, methods, concepts, theories in 
new situations) 
• 
Decision-making (strategy & problem-solving) 
• 
Social Interaction/values/cultures (understanding the 
social environment of others) 
• 
Ability to learn/self-assessment (evaluation) 
 
Below we see an example describing John Smith, who wants 
to find a learning resource that extends his skills in web 
editing and is a president at learNR. 
<PersonName> 
    <GivenName>John</GivenName> 
    <FamilyName>Smith</FamilyName> 
    <Objective>Find a learning resource that 
extends his skills in web editing </Objective> 
<EmploymentHistory>    
    <EmployerOrg> 
        <EmployerOrgName>learNR</EmployerOrgName> 
        <PositionHistory> 
            <Title> President</Title> 
            <OrgName> 
              <OrganizationName>Paper 
              </OrganizationName> 
            </OrgName> 
            <Description>Key Player</Description> 
            <StartDate> 
                <AnyDate>2002-02-01</AnyDate> 
            </StartDate> 
        </PositionHistory> 
    </EmployerOrg> 
</EmploymentHistory> 
</PersonName> 
As we can see in Table II most of these groups have been 
covered in the four dimensional framework and the existing 
classifications and taxonomies. Our classification of game 
styles in Table II is not intended to imply the game style will 
necessarily include a given content type; rather, that these 
game styles are amongst the most common and relevant 
when attempting to categorise serious games. 
IV. 
COMPETENCIES 
The learner will have a certain set of competences, as 
suggested in the Learner Specifics dimension of the four 
dimensional framework. The learner will also be acquiring 
new competencies. Describing and managing competences is 
a well researched topic and is very relevant for serious 
games. 
Various 
different 
standards 
for 
describing 
competencies have been proposed [26], most notably the 
IMS Reusable Definition of Competency or Educational 
Objective (RDCEO) [27], IEEE Reusable Competency 
Definitions (RCD) [28] and HR-XML [29] competencies. 
Both IMS RDCEO and HR-XML identify the following. 
• 
An identification of the competency 
• 
A title for the competency 
• 
A description 
• 
A definition 
• 
A taxonomy of the competency 
• 
Personal information

In addition to this some European countries have 
developed their own set of standards to describe 
competencies, e.g., France is implementing ScoLOMfr [30], 
which extends LOM with vocabularies to classify learning 
objects used by teachers and students in secondary 
education. 
• 
HR-XML also has measurable weights and importance 
levels. The European Union established various 
standards in the Lisbon treaty [31], which define what 
should be acquired through education, is based on this. 
However its focus is very narrow and mainly on the 
competences that must be acquired through formal 
school education and therefore the standard exists of the 
following seven blocks of competences.Mother tongue 
knowledge 
• 
Practice of a foreign language 
• 
Math, scientific and technological culture 
• 
Visual information and communication’s techniques 
• 
Humanities culture 
•

• 
Autonomy, initiative 
V. 
SERIOUS GAMES METADATA 
As the IEEE LOM standard is widely used for describing 
learning objects, the metadata schema we propose for serious 
games is an extension to IEEE LOM. When describing 
serious games, we face a challenge not dissimilar to the 
challenge standards such as IMS-LD and Dublin Core faced 
when they were being developed. A human can read and 
write full-text with ease but can be confused by complex 
compound structures. However, free-text is difficult to 
process automatically and a more complex compound 
structure using complex data types can make automatic 
processing more feasible. Therefore our proposed metadata 
schema, which adds a number of fields to IEEE LOM, will 
have two different levels. The first level that focuses on 
human readability and the second level that focuses on 
machine processability. The elements are the same, but the 
types are stricter in Level 2. Our proposed schema mainly 
focuses on descriptive and review elements of serious games. 
In Tables III and IV, we describe the fields that we propose 
to add to IEEE LOM. We show the type for Level 1 and 
Level 2. The proposed metadata schema allows for a number 
of reviews in addition to technical and descriptive fields, 
therefore, we make a distinction between these technical and 
descriptive fields on the one hand and the set of review fields 
on the other hand. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK 
Existing standards for describing learning resources are 
incomplete when it comes to describing serious games. Any 
automated system that stores and retrieves serious games as 
objects, needs a metadata schema to describe them. Hence, a 
general metadata standard for describing serious games is 
needed. In this paper, we introduced our proposed metadata 
schema, based on existing technology enhanced learning and 
standards and metadata standards, also taking into account 
existing frameworks for evaluating serious games. 
We plan to test our metadata schema, which was inspired 
by previous work in the mEducator project, by integrating it 
into a rating tool for serious games. The rating tool is being 
developed in the course of the EduGameLab project, which 
is aimed at parents and teachers. The rating tool will enable 
rating and sharing of experiences with individual games. For 
this purpose the metadata schema will be used to describe the 
games.

It will be tested in user-panels that are due to be set up

Significant future challenges surrounding the use of 
serious games within LMS and LCMS systems include the 
capacity to define and extract multiple LOs from single 
games, as well as support fully games, which function as part 
of blended learning activities, and therefore can represent an 
element of content within a larger LO. Our schema has 
addressed, on a technical level, some key considerations, 
which are essential to allow functional repurposing of game-
based learning content. Future work must couple this with a 
full pedagogic consideration of how this technical capacity

be difficult to define independently from its given context. 
not in terms of the boundaries arbitrarily placed by the 
interface between game engine and LMS, but instead in 
pedagogic terms, thus allowing them to adhere to best 
practices for LO definition, as well as best practices for the 
implementation of game-based learning approaches.
