Abstract— In this paper, we designed and implemented the 
automotive radar based on Frequency Modulated Continuous 
Wave method for Lane Change Assist and Blind Spot 
Detection radar system. We also developed digital signal 
processing module and a 24 GHz FMCW radar RF module 
composed of a single transmitter, a single transmitting antenna 
array of five elements and three receivers to measure range, 
velocity and angle for LCA and BSD. In order to verify the 
developed radar system, we conducted experiments to measure 
the detection rate and the range accuracy in the anechoic 
chamber and real road environment. The experimental results 
show that the developed radar is feasible for use in BSD/LCA 
systems for automotive.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, the smart car for autonomous driving has 
functions such as lane keeping support, lane change support, 
inter-vehicle distance control, etc. This function is based on 
radar and vision sensor. It is a precise distance measurement 
technology for various obstacles and moving objects is 
required. Lane change assist (LCA) and Blind spot detection 
(BSD) radars should be able to detect objects approaching at 
a medium distance as well as at the rear of the near side. 
Because the LCA/BSD system must be able to detect where 
the moving target is on the left and right lanes of the vehicle 
in the rear of the vehicle and to be able to detect whether 
there is a moving target in the blind zone area, the signal 
processing technique is needed [1]-[3]. 
Frequency modulated continuous Wave (FMCW) radar 
has been popularly used in automotive radar. It can detect 
range and velocity of the moving target, simultaneously. To 
overcome ambiguities, the fast ramp based FMCW radar has 
been proposed [4][5]. 
In this paper, we developed an integrated medium - range 
radar system with dual function for blind spot detection and 
lane change support. To verify the developed radar, we 
tested in the anechoic chamber of high frequency band. 
This paper is organized as follows. The system design of 
the BSD/LCA radar is presented in Section II. To validate 
developed systems, experimental results are provided in 
Section III. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section IV. 
II. 
BSD/LCA RADAR SYSTEM DEGIGN 
We implemented the FMCW LCA/BSD radar systems at 
24 GHz, which has two receiving antennas and analog-to-
digital converter (ADC) channels. The transmitter contains a 
voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), a frequency synthesizer, 
and a 26 MHz oscillator. To generate the FMCW source, a 
frequency synthesizer controls the input voltage of the VCO. 
The source sweeps over the range of 24.0-24.25 GHz.

Figure 1 shows frequencies as a function of time in the 
transmitted signals and received signals for a stationary 
target. The range beat frequency can be obtained by signal 
processing, and then the range of the target can be estimated 
using (1).

where, C is light speed, B is the modulation bandwidth, and 
dt is the delay time between transmitted and received signals. 
The PRI  is Pulse Repetition Interval, which is a chirp 
period. 
The signal processing module and the transceiver are shown 
in Figure 2. The detection algorithm based on 2D fast fourier 
transform (FFT) using fast ramp was implemented in the 
signal processing module. Transceiver consists of a transmit 
antenna with five arrays, a receive antenna with three 
channels, which has three receiving antennas and four ADC 
channels.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
This section presents experimental results to demonstrate 
the performance of the developed BSD/LCA radar in the 
anechoic chamber and road environment. 
We experimented in chamber with frequency band from 
8GHz to 110GHz to obtain the accurate measurement results. 
As shown in Figure 3, the dimension is 10m (L) × 5m (W) × 
4m (H).

In our chamber environment, we performed range 
accuracy experiments with multiple targets. Figure 2 shows 
the signal processing module and the radio frequency (RF) 
transceiver module of the developed LCA / BSD radar.  
BSD/LCA radar algorithm is implemented in TI DSP 
TMS320F28335 as shown Figure 2. The MS320F28335 
processor is a low cost, high efficiency processor that 
operates at 150MHz and provides interfaces and signal 
processing libraries such as ADC, direct memory access 
(DMA), and control area network (CAN). The RF 
transceiver module consists of a transmit antenna with five 
arrays, a receive antenna with three channels, and an RF 
module. 
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we 
tested the detection performance of the developed radar 
system using the two-channel FMCW RF module shown in 
Figure 2.

By using the chamber environment, we can avoid the 
negative effect of the unknown echoes on the algorithm 
performance. We performed the range estimation of the 
developed 24 GHz FMCW BSD/LCA radar sensor for single 
target, placed at different location in chamber room. We 
have captured the beat signal through Ethernet using radar 
signal processing module. Range accuracy was measured 
1,000 times in the anechoic chamber. The target is located 
0.5m to 3m in intervals of 0.5m. We measured the range 
changing the distance in 10m intervals from 10m to 70m to 
demonstrate the performance of the maximum detection 
range. Table 1 shows the measurement results of the range 
accuracy. The experimental results show that the measured 
average distance accuracy is about 0.11m at distance 
between 0.5 m and 3.4 m and about 0.69m at distance 
between 10m to 70m respectively.

Figure 4 shows the experimental environment for the 
verification of the algorithm of the developed BSD/LCA 
radar in this paper. Figure 4 (a) shows that the developed 
radar for the experiment on an actual road environment is 
mounted on an experimental vehicle bumper. Figure 4 (b) 
shows an experiment in which the radar detects a moving 
target. The measured results of the developed radar system 
are passed through CAN, and the results are sent to a PC 
through a CAN to LAN convertor. The final results were 
displayed using a monitoring program as shown Figure 5 and 
Figure 6.

Figure 6.  Experimental results of the BSD zone on urban road

The experiments were performed to verify the developed 
radar could simultaneously detect the BSD and LCA zones 
on urban road environment. The purpose of this experiment 
is to verify that the BSD/LCA radar system gives warnings 
when required as the target vehicle overtakes the radar 
vehicle on real road environment. 
Figure 5 shows the experimental results of the LCA zone 
of the developed radar on real road environment. The 
measured detection results of the LCA zone shows that 
developed radar can detect the target vehicle approaching the 
radar vehicle at high speed as shown Figure 5. Figure 6 
shows the measured detection results of the BSD zone of the 
developed radar on real road environment. The detection 
results of the BSD zone show that developed radar can detect 
the target vehicle in the BSD area within 5m as shown 
Figure 6. Figure 5 and 6 show the range, velocity, and angel 
of the radar output. 
IV. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, the LCA/BSD radar system was presented. 
We developed the radar system to obtain high accuracy 
range and velocity for LCA/BSD. The LCA/BSD radar 
algorithm is implemented on DSP chip of the developed 
signal processing module. We verified the radar sensor 
connected with a 24 GHz front-end-module transceiver to 
obtain accurate measurement results in anechoic chamber. 
And we demonstrated that the developed radar has target 
detection capabilities of BSD area (within 5m) and LCA area 
(maximum 70m) for BSD/LCA application. Convincing 
results confirm the feasibility of the complete system and are 
encouraging for further research activities.
