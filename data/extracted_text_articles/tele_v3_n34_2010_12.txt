Abstract—In this paper we propose a mathematical frame-
work for the performance evaluation of an all-optical packet
switch, in terms of packet blocking probability. We provide
the analytical models for several QoS differentiation schemes,
including wavelength conversion, packet dropping, pre-emptive
dropping, ﬁber delay lines, and wavelength reservation. We
demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed models by comparing
the analytical results with that of simulation; the results are
found to be quite satisfactory.

I. INTRODUCTION
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is the most
promising solution for the efﬁcient utilization of the enor-
mous bandwidth of an optical ﬁber [2]. In WDM optical
networks, the bandwidth of an optical ﬁber is partitioned
into multiple data channels, in which different messages
can be transmitted simultaneously. Nowadays, the WDM
technology is deployed in point-to-point architectures, where
electronic devices are used to switch optical signals. How-
ever, traditional electronic packet switches are not suitable
for handling such high bandwidth due to limitations of
electronic processing speeds and due to the signiﬁcant cost
of high speed Optical-Electronic-Optical (O-E-O) converters
[3]. Optical Packet Switching (OPS) is a promising sub-
wavelength switching approach, since it is capable of dy-
namically allocating network resources with ﬁne granularity
and excellent scalability. In OPS networks the packet pay-
load remains in the optical domain during the entire packet
transmission from the origin to the destination node [4].
Even though the packet payload is switched transparently
without O-E-O conversion, the packet header requires elec-
tronic processing. A long term approach of the OPS is to
process, buffer and forward the entire packet (both header
and payload) in the optical domain.
A vital problem in OPS networks is the resolution of
packet contention which occurs at a switching node when-
ever two or more packets are switched on the same output
wavelength, at the same time. In electrical packet-switched
networks, contention is resolved with the store-and-forward
technique, where packets that lost the contention are stored
in a memory module, in order to be sent out at a later time
to an available output port. This is possible because of the
availability of electronic Random-Access Memory (RAM).
Since there is no equivalent all-optical RAM technology, op-
tical packet switches need to implement different approaches
for contention resolution.
In OPS networks, popular contention resolution schemes
include the use of Fiber Delay Lines (FDLs) [5], [6],
wavelength conversion [7], [8] and deﬂection routing [9].
FDLs provide constant delay to optical packets, to avoid
packet blocking and loss, when all output ports are busy
upon packet arrival. Even though employing FDLs makes
the switch bulky and expensive, especially in cases where
large amount of data needs to be buffered [10], packet
contention ﬁnds a straightforward solution by incorporating
FDLs readily. Wavelength converters are used in an OPS
switch to resolve optical packet blocking by transmitting
a contending optical packet on another wavelength of the
same ﬁber. Deﬂection routing is another way to minimize
packet losses by routing packets, which lose the contention,
to nodes different than their preferred next hop nodes, with
the prospect that they will eventually reach their destinations
[11]. The latter solution is not preferred in delay-sensitive
services, such as real-time or interactive applications, be-
cause it may cause packet misordering upon arrival at the
destination node.
Apart from wavelength conversion which is the most
promising solution for optical packet blocking, other res-
olution schemes such as wavelength reservation, packet
dropping and pre-emptive drop policy, must be employed,
in order to provide Quality of Service (QoS) differentiation.
Wavelength reservation is an access restricted scheme, where
a number of wavelengths are reserved to beneﬁt high priority
service-classes [12]. In packet dropping, packets belonging
to low priority service-classes are dropped with a certain
probability, before destined to an output port [13]. In the

pre-emptive drop policy, high priority packets pre-empt low
priority packets (currently in transmission) in the case of
contention.
The performance evaluation of an OPS switch, in terms
of Packet Blocking (Loss) Probability (PBP), attracts no-
table research efforts [12]-[17]. We concentrate on Øverby’s
works [12]-[15], where analytical models for the PBP cal-
culation in an all-optical packet switch, under the afore-
mentioned QoS differentiation schemes, are presented. In
[14], Øverby studied QoS differentiation schemes with
wavelength converters for an asynchronous bufferless OPS
switch, while the absence of wavelength converters was
investigated in [15]. In all cases only two service-classes
were considered (low and high priority) with inﬁnite number
of trafﬁc sources. The utilization of FDLs in a slotted
optical shared-buffer cross-connect is studied in [16], where
a single service-class is considered. In [17] the authors
present an analytical model for the calculation of the PBP
in an all-optical packet switch equipped with tunable optical
wavelength converters shared per output ﬁber that supports
service-classes with different priorities.
In this paper, we extend our work presented in [1] and
we propose analytical loss models for the PBP calculation
in an all-optical packet switch that accommodates multiple
service-classes of ﬁnite population, and supports QoS dif-
ferentiation among them. The ﬁnite population assumption
is essential, because the number of input ports in an all-
optical packet switch is limited. Our study begins with the
PBP determination in an all-optical packet switch with full
wavelength conversion capability. The switch may operate
without any QoS differentiation scheme, or adopt the inten-
tional packet dropping policy, or the wavelength reservation
policy (a number of wavelengths are reserved for each
service-class). In addition, we study the all-optical packet
switch which utilizes a number of FDLs in each output
wavelength, by considering two cases: i) Packets belonging
to a low priority service-class are intentionally forwarded to
an FDL, before attempting to reach an output wavelength.
In this way their arrival rate is reduced and therefore the
probability that high-priority packets will occupy an output
wavelength is increased. ii) Packets of a low priority service-
class are not allowed to access the output wavelengths, when
the number of occupied output wavelengths exceeds a pre-
deﬁned threshold. In that case, packets of the high-priority
service-class are forwarded to an FDL.
Furthermore, we study the case of the absence of wave-
length converters in the switch, where the QoS differentia-
tion is employed either with the intentional packet dropping
policy, or the pre-emptive drop policy. All the proposed
models are computationally efﬁcient since they are based on
simple recurrent formulas. Our analysis is validated through
simulation; the accuracy of the proposed models is found to
be quite satisfactory.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section
II, we present the analytical model for the PBP calculation in
with full wavelength conversion capability in the case where
i) no QoS differentiation scheme is applied (subsection II.A),
ii) the intentional packet dropping policy is applied (subsec-
tion II.B), iii) the wavelength reservation policy is applied
(subsection II.C), iv) the combination of the wavelength
reservation policy and the intentional packet dropping policy
is applied (sub-section II.D), and v) a number of FDLs is
equipped in the switch (sub-section II.E). In Section III we
present the analytical model for the PBP calculation in an
all-optical switch without wavelength conversion capability
i) under the intentional packet dropping policy (subsection
III.A), and ii) under the pre-emptive drop policy (subsection
III.B). Section IV is the evaluation section. Finally, we
conclude is Section V.
II. ALL-OPTICAL PACKET SWITCH WITH WAVELEGNTH
CONVERSION CAPABILITY
Fig. 1 shows the considered architecture of an all-optical
packet switch with full wavelength conversion capability.
The switch has F input and output ﬁbers, while each
input/output ﬁber supports W wavelengths. The bandwidth
capacity of each wavelength is C bits/sec. Each one of
the output ﬁbers corresponds to a speciﬁc destination node.
The OPS network accommodates K service-classes with
different QoS priorities; service-class 1 has the lowest prior-
ity, while service-class K has the highest priority. Arriving
packets at the switch are switched to the appropriate output
ﬁber according to the packet header which is processed
electronically. Since wavelength conversion is supported by
the switch, a packet can be switched to any wavelength of
the destination ﬁber, as long as at least one wavelength is
available at the time instant the packet arrives at the switch.
The arrival rate of service-class k packets (k ∈ [1, K]) is
denoted as λk. We assume that the length of the packets is
exponentially distributed with mean lp, which is the same
for all service-classes. The latter assumption is adopted
in order to deﬁne the same service-time for each service-
class; therefore, if a packet is accepted for service through
an available wavelength, the time that this wavelength is

occupied is µ−1 = lp/C, where µ is the service rate of
the wavelength, (exponentially distributed). In the following
subsections we present the analytical models for the PBP
calculation both without any QoS differentiation scheme,
and with QoS differentiation schemes: the intentional packet
dropping policy, the wavelength reservation policy, and the
utilization of FDLs. Although our analysis targets at the PBP
calculation in one destination ﬁber, it can be applied to any
output ﬁber of the all-optical packet switch.
A. Absence of QoS differentiation scheme
The absence of a QoS differentiation scheme means that
all service-classes have the same priority; therefore, the PBP
is the same for all service-classes. The calculation of the PBP
is based on the knowledge of the occupancy distribution of
the wavelengths in the ﬁber. To this end, we formulate a
Markov chain with the state transition diagram of Fig. 2,
where state irepresents the number of occupied wavelengths
in the ﬁber. We denote the total packet arrival rate from
an input wavelength byλ = PK
k=1 λk.We also indicate the
number of input wavelengths that offer trafﬁc to the ﬁber
under study, as Rf, f ∈ [1, F], where Rf = F · W, if we
assume that all output ﬁbers have the same trafﬁc load. The
transition from state [i-1] to state [i] of the Markov chain
occurs [Rf-(i-1)]·λ times per unit time. This is because in
state [i-1] the number of input wavelengths which have not
been used for a connection establishment with an output port
is Rf − (i − 1), while the call arrival rate is aggregated to
λ, since a packet from any service-class is required for the
occupation of the wavelength. The reverse transition, from
state [i] to state [i-1] is realized i times per unit time, where µ
is the service rate of a wavelength. The probability P(i) that i
wavelengths are occupied in the ﬁber can be derived from the
rate balance equations of the state transition diagram of Fig.
2. We use the classical method for deriving the distribution
P(i) which is described in [18]. More speciﬁcally, from the
global balance equations (rate-out = rate-in), we obtain the
following steady-state equation:
P(i − 1)[(Rf − (i − 1))λ] + P(i + 1)[(i + 1)µ] =
= P(i)[(Rf − i)λ + iµ]
(1)
where P(i) = 0 for i < 0 and i > W. By writing (1) for
i = 0 to i − 1, and summing up side by side, we get the
following recurrent formula:
P(i) = λ
µ
Rf − (i − 1)
i
P(i − 1)
(2)
Consecutive applications of (2) yields the equation that
gives the probability P(i) that i wavelengths (i=0,1,...,W)
are occupied in the output ﬁber:
P (i) =

· P (0)
(3)

The probability P(0) that the ﬁber is empty can be derived
using the normalization condition,

i=0
P (i) = 1
(4)
Therefore, the probability P(0) is given by the following
formula:
P (0) =

(5)
It should be noted that the distribution of (3) is the
well-known Engset distribution. The PBP is determined by
(3) when i=W, i.e. P(W), since an input packet cannot be
serviced when all the wavelengths are occupied. As a result,
in the absence of any QoS differentiation scheme, the PBP
is the same for all service-classes.
B. The intentional packet dropping policy
In the intentional packet dropping policy, a service-class
k packet is dropped with a constant probability pk, before
reaching the output ﬁber. Since the ﬁrst service-class has
the lowest priority and the K-th service-class has the highest
priority, p1 > p2 > ... > pK = 0 i.e. a K-th service-class
packet cannot be dropped. In order to favor speciﬁc service-
classes, the values of the dropping probabilities pk should
be selected appropriately. In this case, the occupancy distri-
bution of the wavelengths in the ﬁber could be derived from
the state transition diagram of Fig. 2, with the substitution:
λ =
K
X
k=1
λk(1 − pk)
(6)
Following the same concept as in the case of no QoS
differentiation scheme, the distribution of the occupied
wavelengths in the output ﬁber is given by (3) and (5), where
λ is given by (6). The PBP of a service-class k packet is
given by:
Bk = pk + (1 − pk)P(W)
(7)
since a service-class k packet can be blocked when the
system is at any state with probability pk, or at the last
state (when all wavelengths are occupied) with probability
(1−pk)P(W). Especially for the K-th service-class, the PBP

is determined by P(W), given that the K-th service-class has
the highest priority and pk = 0.
C.
The Wavelength Reservation Policy
In the wavelength reservation policy a number of wave-
lengths in the output ﬁber is reserved exclusively for each
service-class. More precisely, a service-class k packet is
accepted for service, when more than tk wavelengths are
available in the ﬁber. In order to reduce the PBP of the high
priority service-classes, we assume that t1 > t2 > ... >
tK.The occupancy distribution of the ﬁber is described by
the Markov chain of Fig. 3, where the arrival rate λ(i) is
given by:
λ(i) =
K
X
k=1
λkDk(i)
(8)
where Dk(i) is a parameter that equals to 1, if the number
of the free wavelengths is less than or equal to tk, or equals
to 0, if the number of the free wavelengths is more than
tk; therefore, from the state transition diagram of Fig. 3 we
derive the recursive formula:
P(i) = (Rf − (i − 1))
µ · i
K
X
k=1
λkDk(i − 1) · P(i − 1)
(9)
where:
Dk(i − 1) =
 1, for i ≤ W − tk
0, for i > W − tk
(10)
Eq. (9) can be solved by setting P(0)=1, (P(i)=0, i<0), and
normalizing each value over the summation PW
i=0 P(i). The
PBP calculation of service-class k is based on the summation
of the probabilities of the blocking states [W-tk] to [W], and
is given by the formula:
Bk =
W
X
j=W −tk
P(j)
(11)
D.
A combination of the intentional packet dropping and
the wavelength reservation policies
Under the intentional packet dropping policy, a low pri-
ority packet is dropped with a constant probability, even
when the number of the occupied wavelengths is low (at
the time instant of the dropping). An alternative solution
could be the activation of the intentional packet dropping
policy, only when the number of occupied wavelengths in
the ﬁber exceeds a pre-deﬁned threshold. In this way we
favor the high priority service-classes only when the number
of the available output wavelengths is low. Since the ﬁrst
service-class has the lowest priority and the K-th service-
class has the highest priority, the dropping probabilities for
the K service-classes are deﬁned as p1 > p2 > ... > pK = 0,
while the thresholds for the activation of the dropping policy
are deﬁned as t1 > t2 > ... > tK = 0; therefore packets of

the highest priority cannot be dropped. In this case, the oc-
cupancy distribution of the ﬁber is described by the Markov
chain of Fig. 3, where the arrival rate of packets is given
by (6) only when the number of the occupied wavelengths
exceeds the threshold W-tk for the speciﬁc service-class,
while, the arrival rate of service-class k packets equals to
λk, only when the number of the occupied wavelengths in
the ﬁber is less than W-tk, therefore:
λ(i) =
( PK
k=1 λk(1 − pk), if i ≥ W − tk
PK
k=1 λk,
if i < W − tk
(12)
Following the same concept as in the case of no QoS
differentiation scheme and based on the state transition
diagram of Fig. 3 we derive the recursive formula:
P(i) = (Rf − (i − 1))
µ · i
λ(i − 1) · P(i − 1)
(13)
Eq. (13) can be solved by setting P(0)=1, (P(i)=0, i<0),
and normalizing each value over the summation PW
i=0 P(i).
The PBP calculation is based on the fact that a service-class
k packet can be blocked at any one of the states from [W-
tk] to [W] with probability pk, or at the last state (when all
wavelengths are occupied) with probability (1-pk)P(W):
Bk =
W
X
j=W −tk
pkP(j) + (1 − pk)P(W)
(14)
It should be noted that if t2=W, then the set of equations
(12)-(14) calculates the PBP in an all-optical switch, which
supports 2 service-classes, under the intentional packet
dropping policy (sub-section II-B), using the same values
for the dropping probabilities pk. Furthermore, if p2 = 1,
the same set of equations calculates the PBP in an all-
optical switch, which supports 2 service-classes, under the
wavelength reservation policy (sub-section II-C), using the
same values for the parameters tk.
E.
Utilization of FDLs
Optical buffering using FDLs could be used in several
ways in order to provide QoS differentiation. We consider
two cases in which the OPS network supports 2 service-
classes with different priorities. In the ﬁrst case, only low
priority packets are forwarded to FDLs before attempting
to reach an output wavelength. In the second case, when
the number of occupied wavelengths exceeds a pre-deﬁned

243
International Journal on Advances in Telecommunications, vol 3 no 3 & 4, year 2010, http://www.iariajournals.org/telecommunications/

threshold, packets that belong to the high priority service-
class are forwarded to an FDL module before attempting to
reach an output wavelength. In the following sub-sections we
provide the analysis for the PBP calculation in both cases.
1)
Delaying low priority packets through FDLs: We
consider the case where low priority packets are forwarded
to FDLs before attempting to reach an output wavelength.
In this way the arrival rate λ1 of the low priority packets
is reduced and the high priority packets have increased
probability to reserve an output wavelength. We assume that
each wavelength is equipped with a module that contains an
equal number of L FDLs. The length of each FDL is denoted
by lF DL; thus, the delay that a packet suffers during its
transmission through an FDL is equal to the transmission
delay plus the propagation delay of a packet:
h = lp
C + lF DL
˜c
= lp
C + lF DL · ˜n
co
(15)
where ˜c = co/˜n is the speed of light in the optical ﬁber,
co is the speed of light in the vacuum (3 · 108m/sec)
and ˜n is the refractive index of the optical ﬁber. Since
the mean length packet lp is exponentially distributed and
lF DL · ˜n/cois constant, h is also exponentially distributed.
The procedure of the postponement of the low priority
packets through an FDL can be modeled as a loss system
with a ﬁnite number of input trafﬁc sources and L FDLs as
the number of servers, as shown in Fig. 4. The number of the
input trafﬁc sources for each set of FDLs is not constant;
it is a function of the number i of occupied wavelengths
and consequently, the number of the input trafﬁc sources
to the FDL module of a wavelength is (Rf -i). Moreover,
the arrival rate of each input trafﬁc source is λ1, since,
only packets from the ﬁrst service-class enter FDLs and the
service time of FDLs is equal to h. This system can be
described analytically by the Engset distribution:
qi (j) = (λ1 · h)j ·
Qj
m=1 [(Rf − i) − (m − 1)]
j!
· qi (0)
(16)
The probability qi(0) that FDLs are empty, when i wave-
lengths are occupied in the output ﬁber, can be derived
using the normalization condition,PL
m=0 qi (m) = 1. The
probability that a low priority packet will ﬁnd all L FDLs
occupied is given by qi(L); in this case the low priority
packet is blocked and lost.
Since the number of the input ports to an FDL module is
a function of the occupied wavelengths, it is possible that in
case of high wavelength occupancy, the low priority packets
can not be blocked because of the unavailability of an FDL;
they are only delayed by their transmission through an FDL.
This situation occurs when the number of the input trafﬁc
sources is less than the numbers of FDLs in the FDL module.
Therefore, the rate by which the packets egress the FDLs and
request access to the wavelength is L·1/h, when the number
of input ports is larger than L; if this number is less than
L, no packets are blocked in the FDLs and the egress rate
of the packets is (Rf − i) · 1/h. This rate is added to the
rate of the high priority packets, which is (Rf − i) · λ2. In
the case of (Rf − i) < L, in order to achieve the reduction
of the arrival rate of the low priority packets, this delay has
to be larger than the inter-arrival time of the packets. The
total arrival rate of packets, when i output wavelengths are
occupied in the output ﬁber, is given by:
λ(i) =
 (Rf − i) · λ2 + L · 1
h
if L < (Rf − i)
(Rf − i) ·

module at any one of the states from [W-tk+1] to [W-1] with
probability qi(L) (given by (16)) or at the last state (when
all wavelengths are occupied) with probability P(W):

III. ALL-OPTICAL PACKET SWITCH WITHOUT
WAVELENGTH CONVERSION CAPABILITY
The analysis of an all-optical switch without wavelength
conversion capability could be considered as a special case
of the analysis of an all-optical switch with wavelength con-
version capability, presented in Section II. More precisely,
we focus on the determination of the occupancy distribution
of one output wavelength; therefore this analysis could be
used to any output wavelength of any output ﬁber. In the
following subsections we present the analytical models for
the PBP calculation in an all-optical packet switch that
operates under the intentional packet dropping policy, or the
pre-emptive drop policy.
A.
The Intentional Packet Dropping Policy
We assume that the switch operates under the intentional
packet dropping policy; therefore a service-class k packet
is dropped with a constant probability pk, before reaching
the output ﬁber. Since an output wavelength can be idle
(state 0) or busy (state 1), we formulate a Markov chain
with the state transition diagram of Fig. 6, where the total
arrival rate is given by (6) and Rf,w denotes the number of
input wavelengths that offer trafﬁc to the wavelength under
study. By solving the Markov chain of Fig. 6, we derive the
steady-state probabilities:
P(0) =
µ
Rf,wλ+µ
P(1) =
Rf,wλ
Rf,wλ+µ
(23)
Following the same analysis as in the full wavelength
conversion case, the PBP of service-class k packets is given
by:
Bk = pk + (1 − pk) · P(1)
(24)
B.
The Pre-Emptive Drop Policy
In the pre-emptive drop policy, high priority packets
pre-empt low priority packets currently in transmission in
the case of contention. In our study, we assume that the
all-optical network supports 3 service-classes. When the
wavelength under study is occupied, packets that belong to
service-class 1 will be blocked, while packets that belong
to the other two service-classes are permitted to interrupt
the transmission of a service-class 1 packet, and pre-empt
the wavelength. We assume that the successful pre-emption
of a service-class 1 packet by a packet that belongs to
service-class 2 and 3 is realized with probability p2 and
p3, respectively. We deﬁne that service-class 3 packets
have higher priority than service-class 2 packets, therefore
p2 < p3. By ﬁne-tuning the values of p2 and p3 we can
adjust the PBP of service-class 2 and 3, respectively, to any
desired level.
In order to model the all-optical switch without wave-
length conversion capability, under the pre-emptive drop
policy, we construct the Markov chain of Fig. 7. State [0, 0]
is the idle state, while states [1, 1], [1, 2] and [1, 3] indicate
the states where the wavelength is occupied by a service-
class 1, 2 or 3 packet, respectively. When the system is idle,
it is transferred to state [1, m], m=1, 2, 3, Rf,w·λm times per

unit time, where Rf,w is the number of input wavelengths
that offer trafﬁc to the wavelength under study. When the
system is at state [1, 1], it can be transferred to state [1,
2] Rf,w · λ2 · p2 times per unit time. This transition refers
to the case where a service-class 1 packet is pre-empted by
a service-class 2 packet. Similarly, when the system is at
state [1, 1], it can be transferred to state [1, 3] Rf,w · λ3 · p3
times per unit time, when a service-class 3 packet pre-empts
a service-class 1 packet. Solving the Markov chain of Fig.
7, we obtain the following state probabilities:

A service-class 3 packet is blocked when the system is
at state [1, 3] or either at state [1, 2], or at state [1, 1]
and pre-emption fails. Similarly, a service-class 2 packet
is blocked when the system is at state [1, 2] or either at
state [1, 3], or state [1, 1] and pre-emption fails. A service-
class 1 packet is blocked when the system is at states [1,
2] or [1, 3] or [1, 1] and pre-emption by a service-class 2
or 3 packet successfully occurs. Therefore the PBP of the
three service-classes (B1, B2 and B3, respectively) can be
calculated using the formulas:
B1 = P(1, 3) + P(1, 2) + P(1, 1)(1 + p3λ3
λ1 + p2λ2
λ1 )
B2 = P(1, 3) + P(1, 2) + (1 − p2)P(1, 1)
B3 = P(1, 3) + P(1, 2) + (1 − p3)P(1, 1)

IV. EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the proposed analytical models
through simulation. To this end, we simulate the different
functions of the all- presented in section II and III, by
using the Simscript II.5 simulation tool [19]. We examine
the blocking performance of the all-optical packet switch,
with or without wavelength conversion, by providing two
application examples.
Figure 7.
State transition diagram of the number of occupied wavelenths
in the output ﬁber of the switch without wavelength conversion, under the
pre-emptive drop policy.
In the ﬁrst example we consider an all-optical packet
switch with wavelength conversion capability. The number
of the input/output ﬁbers are F=10, while each ﬁber supports
W=8 wavelengths. The capacity of each wavelength is C=
10 Gbit/sec. Packets that belong to K=2 service-classes
arrive at the switch and they are switched to the appropriate
output ﬁber. We calculate the PBP in one output ﬁber,
while considering that an equal trafﬁc load is offered to
every output ﬁber, i.e. Rf = F · W. The length of the
packets that belong to all service-classes is exponentially
distributed with mean value of 15 Kbytes. In Table I we
present analytical and simulation PBP results for the case of
no QoS differentiation policy versus the arrival rate per idle
input wavelength. Since no QoS differentiation scheme is
considered, the PBP is the same for the two service-classes.
The comparison between analytical and simulation results
reveals that the accuracy of the proposed analytical model
is completely satisfactory.

dropping policy to the PBP is shown in Table II. A packet
that belongs to the ﬁrst service-class is dropped with a
constant probability p1=0.05, while packets that belong to
the second service-class cannot be dropped. As Table II
shows, the model’s accuracy is satisfactory. We notice that
the PBP of the second service-class is reduced, compared
to the corresponding results of Table I, while the PBP of
the ﬁrst service-class is increased. This is due to the fact
that 5% of the ﬁrst service-class packets are dropped, before
reaching an output wavelength; therefore packets that belong
to the second service-class have privileged access to the
output wavelengths. Moreover, in Figs. 8 and 9 we present
analytical PBP results for both service-classes, respectively,
versus the packet arrival rate, for various values of the
dropping probability p1. We consider 7 arrival-rate points
(1, 2, . . . , 7) in the x-axis of Figs. 8 and 9. Point 1 corre-
sponds toλ = (500, 1000)packets/sec, and in the successive
points the values of λ1, λ2 are equally increased by 250
packets/sec. The last Point 7 corresponds to (2000, 2500).
Comparison of the results of Figs. 8 and 9 clearly reveals
that the PBP of the ﬁrst service-class strongly increases with
the increase of the dropping probability p1, while the PBP
of the second service-class is softly affected by this increase.
The effect of the wavelength reservation policy on the
PBP is presented in Table III. We assume the same scenario
for the all-optical switch as in the two previous cases, while
t1=1 out of W=8 wavelengths are reserved for the packets
of the second service-class (note that t2=0). As the results
reveal, the accuracy of the presented analytical model is
quite satisfactory.
The impact of the increase of the wavelength threshold
t1 to the PBP of both service-classes can be monitored in
Figs. 10 and 11. In particular, Figs. 10 and 11 illustrate
the PBP of both service-classes against the arrival rate,
for different values of the threshold t1. We employ the
same arrival-rate points, as the ones used in Figs. 8 and
9. The study of these ﬁgures reveals that the increase of
t1 results to the PBP decrease of the second service-class;
the reverse performance is observed for the PBP of the ﬁrst
service-class. The explanation for this behavior is as follows:
for high values of t1 more wavelengths are reserved for

service-class have increased probability to access the output
wavelengths of the output ﬁber, compared to packets that
belong to the ﬁrst service-class.
The evaluation of the combination of the intentional
packet dropping policy and the wavelength reservation pol-
icy is realized through the comparison of analytical and
simulation PBP results versus the packet arrival rate, as
presented in Table IV. The results were obtained under the
ﬁrst application example, while the dropping probability of
the ﬁrst service-class is p1= 0.05 and t1 = 1 out of 8
wavelengths are reserved for the second service-class. As the
results of the Table IV reveal, the accuracy of the proposed
analytical model is quite satisfactory. Since the results of

values of the threshold t1, for the ﬁrst service-class of the ﬁrst example,

Table IV were obtained by considering that only t1=1 out
of 8 wavelengths are reserved for the second service-class,
there is a small beneﬁt for packets of this service-class, over
packets of the ﬁrst service-class. The effect of the number of
wavelengths that are reserved for the high priority service-
class is depicted in Figs. 12 and 13. More precisely, Figs. 12
and 13 show the PBP of the two service-classes, respectively,
versus the arrival rate, for different values of the threshold
t1, while the dropping probability p1 is kept constant and
equal to 0.05. As the results of Figs. 12 and 13 reveal, the
increase of the value of t1 has a small inﬂuence on the PBP
performance of the high priority second service-class. On the
other hand, increasing t1 results in higher PBP values for the
low priority service-class. Therefore, in order to beneﬁt the
high priority service-class, both the dropping probabilities
pk and the thresholds tk should be carefully adjusted.
The ﬁrst application example is also employed in order to
evaluate the analytical models for the PBP calculation in an
all-optical switch that utilizes FDLs. In the case where low
priority packets are delayed by their transmission through a
number of FDLs, we consider that each wavelength in the

output ﬁber is equipped with a module that contains an equal
number of L = 4 FDLs. The length of each FDL is denoted
by lF DL = 5 km, while the refractive index of the ﬁber that
is used for the construction of the FDLs is n=1.55. In Table
V we present analytical and simulation PBP results for the
two service-classes against the arrival rate. The comparison
of analytical and simulation results reveals that the accuracy
of the proposed analytical model is satisfactory.
We also study the effect of the number of the FDLs in
each FDL module, to the PBP of both service-classes. Fig.
14 presents analytical PBP results of both service-classes,
versus the number of FDLs. We assume that the length of
each FDL is lF DL = 5 km, while the packet arrival rate
of both service-classes is (λ1, λ2)=(300,500) packets/sec.
Fig. 14 shows that when more FDLs are used in the FDL
module, the PBP of the low priority service-class decreases;
the reverse behavior is observed for the high priority service-
class. For higher number of FDLs the PBP of both service-
classes becomes the same and increases with further increase
of the number of FDLs. This is due to the fact that when

few FDLs are employed, most of the low priority packets are
blocked in the FDL module and high priority packets have
increased probability to ﬁnd an available output wavelength.
By installing more FDLs in the FDL module, the difference
between the PBP of both service-classes is reduced, while
higher number of FDLs corresponds to higher input packet
sources to the switch, which results in higher PBP for both
service-classes.
Apart from the number of FDLs installed in each FDL
module, another parameter that affects PBP is the length
of each FDL. In Fig.15 we present analytical PBP results
of both service-classes versus the length of an FDL. We
assume that each FDL module consists of L = 4 FDLs,
while the packet arrival rate of both service-classes is (λ1,

packets through FDLs.
λ2)=(300,500) packets/sec. Fig. 15 shows that the increase
of the FDL length results in a PBP decrease of the high
priority service-class, while the PBP of the low priority
service-class has a decrease up to a certain value of the FDL
length; after this point the PBP increases. The explanation
for this behavior is as follows. When the FDL length is
small, the delay that low priority packets experience is low
and therefore the rate by which packets egress the FDL
is high, compared to the rate when the FDL length is
large. In the latter case, fewer low priority packets request
service through an output wavelength; therefore high priority
packets have privileged access to the output wavelengths.
The analytical model for the combination of the wave-
length reservation policy with the utilization of FDLs is
evaluated by comparing analytical and simulation results,
as they are presented in Table VI. In particular, in Table
VI we present analytical and simulation PBP results, for
different values of packet arrival rate, for both service-
classes. We consider the ﬁrst application example, while
each wavelength in the output ﬁber is equipped with a
module that contains an equal number of L = 4 FDLs.
Also, the length of each FDL is denoted by lF DL = 5

km and 2 out of 8 wavelengths are reserved for the high
priority service-class. As the results reveal, the accuracy of
the proposed analytical model is satisfactory. We also study
the impact of the wavelength threshold WT to the PBP.
To this end, Fig. 16 and 17 presents analytical PBP results
of both service-classes, respectively, versus the arrival rate,
for different values of the parameter WT . We consider 7
arrival-rate points (1, 2, ..., 7) in the x-axis of Figs. 16
and 17. Point 1 corresponds to (λ1, λ2) = (500, 1000)
packets/sec, and in the successive points the values of λ1,
λ2 are equally increased by 250 packets/sec. Thus, Point
7 corresponds to (2000, 2500). As it was anticipated, the
increase of WT results in the increase of the difference of
PBP of the two service-classes, since more wavelengths are
dedicated to exclusively service high priority packets.
In the second application example, we consider an all-
optical switch without wavelength conversion capability. The
number of the input ﬁbers are again F=10, while each ﬁber
supports W=8 wavelengths. The capacity of each wavelength
is C= 10 Gbit/sec. Packets that belong to K=3 service-classes

wavelength, considering that an equal trafﬁc load is offered
to every output ﬁber, i.e. Rf,w = F · W. The dropping
probability of the second and third service-classes is p2 =
0.01 and p3 = 0.02, respectively, while packets from the
ﬁrst service-class are not dropped. In Fig. 18 we present
analytical PBP results of the three service-classes, where the
arrival rate is the same for all service-classes. As the results
reveal, packets of the second and third service-classes suffer
higher blockings, compared to packets of the ﬁrst service-
class. The same scenario is used to study the pre-emption
drop policy. The successful pre-emption of a service-class

1 is realized with a probability p2 = 0.1 and p1 = 0.2,
respectively. In Fig. 19 we present analytical PBP results of
the three service-classes. As the results reveal, the PBP of
the 3rd service-class is higher, compared to the PBP of the
1st and 2nd service-classes.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we propose analytical models for the calcu-
lations of PBP in an all-optical packet switch, under several
QoS differentiation schemes. Packets that belong to multiple
service-classes arrive from a ﬁnite number of input ports
and attempt to gain access to an output wavelength. PBP
is derived by the steady-state equation of one-dimensional
Markov chains. The accuracy of the proposed calculations
is quite satisfactory as was veriﬁed by simulations. In our
future work we shall extend this analysis, in order to further
study the effect of the implementation of FDLs and examine
the deﬂection routing to the blocking performance of the all-
optical switch.
