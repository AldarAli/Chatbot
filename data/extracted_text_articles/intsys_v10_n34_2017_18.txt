Abstract—The development of smart sensor systems, wearables 
or internet of things devices necessitates new fabrication 
technologies. The challenge is to meet requirements such as 
low-cost, flexibility, reproducibility and capability for large 
area fabrication. Fabricating conductive microstructures on 
polymer films by additive processes like inkjet printing has 
become increasingly important for these applications in the last 
decade. Additive processes are potentially more ecofriendly 
than conventional electronics fabrication processes but 
printing has still not reached wider implementation in 
industry. One of the potential reasons is the still insufficient 
reliability of printed components that must sustain electrical, 
thermal, mechanical and chemical stress. This reliability of 
printed products is influenced by a vast number of factors and 
process parameters. The impact of a certain parameter on the 
product’s reliability can so far not be defined precisely. Besides 
functional testing, the examination of cross sections of printed 
structures can lead to a more detailed understanding of their 
morphology and may entail information for the optimization of 
the fabrication process. Regarding the requirements, the nano- 
and microstructure of printed structures has to be analyzed. In 
the present work, a method is described for the investigation of 
nano- and microstructures of inkjet-printed conductive traces 
on polymer substrates by means of scanning electron 
microscopy of cross sections prepared by ultramicrotome 
sectioning.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Currently, 
printing 
of 
electronically 
functional 
components represents an important field of study in regard 
of which not only fabrication processes have to be 
investigated but also methods for the analysis of the 
reliability of printed devices [1]. In the last decade, printing 
technologies have become more and more important in 
research and development for flexible electronics [2]. The 
objective is to replace conventional subtractive fabrication 
processes of printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing by 
additive processes. Printing processes can be used to 
fabricate conductive structures, as well as more complex 
electronic components on flexible polymer films.  
The analysis of inkjet-printed conductive structures on 
polymer 
substrates 
in 
terms 
of 
morphology 
and 
nanostructure is essential for the assessment of reliability and 
reproducibility in printed electronics [1]. Established 
preparation methods for nanostructure analysis are Focused 
Ion Beam (FIB) milling and ultramicrotome sectioning. 
A. Preparation methods for analyzing cross sections of 
printed structures on polymer films 
In FIB milling the material is being etched by a beam of 
focused Gallium ions, with removal rates of a few 
µm³/minute and a depth resolution in the range of 5 
nanometres [3]. Usually, the FIB instrument is combined 
with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), so that the new 
by FIB etching prepared sample surface can be immediately 
imaged (FIBSEM). Repeated FIB etching and imaging 
allows inspection of sample volumes, but still on a very 
limited scale. Moreover the impact of the Gallium ions may, 
depending on the sample material, create severe damage on 
and below the milled surface [3]. This includes local 
amorphization, heating damage and Ga implantation. Chain 
scission, cross-linking and chain shrinkage have been 
observed, effects which may transform the structure and 
crystallinity of polymers [4]. Another aspect is that 
repeating etching and imaging steps in a FIBSEM the 
prepared sample surface is continuously being destroyed 
with the next etching step, hence lost for other imaging 
modalities. 
Ultramicrotome sectioning means embedding the sample 
in a polymer and cutting thin slices, called sections, with a 
diamond knife. Section width is limited by the width of the 
diamond knife, which may reach up to several millimetres. 
Thus, ultramicrotome sectioning is applicable for structural 
elucidation of larger volumes than FIB milling. Its depth 
resolution is however limited by the minimum section 
thickness achievable for the given combination of sample 
and embedding material, typically 30 to 200 nm. After

cutting the sections float on the water surface of the knife 
boat behind the diamond knife edge from where they can be 
picked up and transferred onto the substrate (glass cover slip, 
silicon wafer, TEM-grid). Depending on the substrate the 
sections are then available for different imaging modalities 
such as light microscopy, SEM or transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM). Proper embedding of the sample is a 
challenge; the embedding material stiffness should be 
compatible with the stiffness of the sample. Distortion of the 
nanostructure of the sample, e.g., swelling of porous 
materials due to embedding has to be avoided [4]. Loosely 
connected particles in the sample may be detached and 
smeared across the section during cutting. Moreover, 
mechanical stresses during cutting may lead to deformations 
and structural alterations.  
Melo compares FIB 
milling and ultramicrotome 
sectioning for sample preparation for analytical microscopy 
of the cathode layer of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell and 
shows the drawbacks of FIB milling and the challenges for 
ultramicrotome sectioning [4]. 
The requirements for sample preparation for the 
structural elucidation of printed electronic structures 
fabricated in our lab are 
 
potential for larger sample volumes (a few hundred 
microns up to a few millimetres width/depth and 
up to a hundred microns thickness)  
 
analysis of the samples with different imaging 
modalities 
(light 
microscopy 
and 
electron 
microscopy)  
Hence, ultramicrotome sectioning has been selected as 
method for sample preparation for analysis of printed traces. 
B. Functional printing vs. conventional PCB fabrication 
A number of printing technologies were transferred from 
the realm of graphic printing to electronics manufacturing in 
the last decade. Manufacturing processes can be categorized 
into processes for mass production and processes for single 
part or small series production. In the same way, printing 
processes can be also classified with regard to process 
productivity. Conventional printing processes based on 
printing tools (stencils, print cylinders) are well suited for 
large-scale 
production 
whereas, 
tool-less, 
non-impact 
printing processes are more suited to individual part up to 
small series manufacturing and research applications [5] [6].  
Conventional, subtractive PCB fabrication requires a 
complex process sequence with electroplating, lithography 
and etching steps based on a fair amount of toxic chemicals. 
Printing processes usually need one single additive 
fabrication step followed by an additional curing process in 
order to create conductive traces on a substrate [7] [8]. Thus, 
material usage is optimized and the toxic waste accumulated 
in subtractive processing is eliminated [9]. Printing allows 
faster, cleaner, cheaper and more environmentally friendly 
fabrication of PCB’s than conventional processes [8]. 
Additionally, printing enables large area processing of 
flexible polymer substrates at low temperatures and ambient 
conditions [10]. 
The implementation of printing processes for a desired 
electronic function in microstructure resolution demands 
careful selection of the three main process components - ink, 
substrate and printing system. These components have to be 
precisely tuned to get optimum conditions for realizing 
features with high reproducibility [5].  
C. Ink materials 
There exists a number of ink materials to realize 
electronic functions like resistors, capacitors [11] or 
transistors [12]. A fundamental element in printed electronics 
however are conductive traces [7]. They have to provide 
high conductivities in order to minimize power loss. 
Currently, there are two main ink types for printing 
conductive traces available. One type are metal organic 
decomposition (MOD) inks, with oxidized metal ions as 
main component [13]. The most prevalent type are 
nanoparticle inks, where the particles are dispersed in 
solvents and stabilized by an organic capping agent against 
agglomeration [14]. 
Due to their high conductivity, silver-based inks are most 
widely used [9]. For printed silver nanoparticle traces a 
conductivity of about 10 % of bulk silver is applicable for 
many applications [15]. 
Typically, the particle size of such inks can be found in 
the range of 10 to 80 nm. Small nanoparticle sizes are 
desirable, as the nanoparticle size severely influences the 
curing process, due to melting point depression; the smaller 
the particles, the lower the melting point compared to the 
bulk material [16] [17]. 
D. Printing substrate materials 
For printed flexible electronic applications low cost 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates are widely used. 
The  base materials have a glass-transition temperature (Tg) 
of 78 °C and a melting point of 255 °C [18] [19]. 
Commercially available PET films, e.g., Melinex® ST from 
DuPont Teijin Films are often used in printed electronic 
applications. Such PET substrates are thermoplastic semi-
crystalline polymer films whose maximum working 
temperature for printing and sintering processes (Tmax) of 
about 150 °C is largely independent of their Tg due to a 
heat-stabilization [18] [19] [20]. Semi-crystalline polymer 
films have better resistances against solvents than 
amorphous polymers [20]. 
E. Inkjet-printing 
Drop-on-demand (DoD) piezo inkjet printing is the most 
widespread non-impact printing principle in the field of 
printed electronics [10]. It allows direct, mask-less and 
vectorial printing of layouts on flexible polymer films [5]. 
The layouts are created by computer-aided design (CAD) 
tools. With regard to printability the interaction between 
print head and ink is of crucial importance. Relevant ink 
parameters are viscosity, surface energy, density, particle 
size and particle stability [7] [8]. In order to prevent print 
head nozzle clogging a particle diameter of less than 1 % of 
the nozzle diameter is recommended [21].

Inkjet-printing often produces non-uniform, low edge 
quality and non-reproducible morphology compared to 
conventional electronics fabrication processes [22] [23]. In 
order to obtain an optimum line quality, the important 
printing parameters that need to be controlled are the droplet 
velocity (vd), the frequency of droplet generation (fd), the 
distance between two adjacent droplets (dd) on the substrate, 
the substrate temperature (Ts) and substrate surface 
properties [24] [25]. 
F. Curing of printed structures 
After the printing process, the resulting structures must 
be cured in order to get the desired electrical conductivity 
[15]. First, the ink solvent has to be evaporated; then, the 
organic stabilizing shell has to be removed. During sintering, 
a percolation-based network of conductive paths is 
established due to sporadic agglomeration of particles [15]. 
At higher temperatures, sintering necks improve the 
conductivity, the coalescence of the particles leads to a 
higher metal density of the printed feature [26]. High 
conductivities have been achieved by means of an oven 
sintering regime with 30 minutes or more at temperatures 
above 250 °C [2]. 
Despite the lower melting point of nanoparticles 
compared to the bulk material, a sintering regime required 
for such an increased conductivity is not compatible with 
many of the widely used low-cost polymer substrates, e.g., 
PET [27]. 
Therefore, low temperature sintering methods are taken 
into consideration that allow either sintering at room 
temperature (commonly known as chemical sintering) or 
selective sintering where only the printed structure that needs 
to be cured is heated while the substrate stays at moderate 
temperatures [2]. Selective sintering methods are photonic 
flash sintering, laser sintering, plasma sintering, microwave 
sintering and electrical current sintering [2] [15]. 
Chemical sintering comprises, among other methods, 
sintering triggered by additives in the ink, embedded in the 
substrate material or coated on its surface [28]. 
G. Properties of printed structures 
In view of the manifold applications of printed structures, 
such as conductors and passive components, not only their 
electrical characteristics must be considered, but also their 
mechanical and chemical properties. Printed conductive 
traces have to withstand mechanical, chemical und thermal 
stresses 
that 
can 
influence 
their 
inherent 
porous 
nanostructure and thereby impair the reliability. Particularly, 
adhesion to the substrate, bendability and fatigue resistance 
are important properties of printed structures for applications 
on flexible polymer substrates. Sintering conditions 
substantially influence mechanical properties, such as fatigue 
resistance [29]. 
H. Hybrid electronics 
To date, many electronic functional elements besides 
conductive traces such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, 
organic light emitting diodes (OLED), organic photovoltaics 
(OPV) and sensors have been realized by printing 
technologies. However, it is currently not possible to achieve 
the performance of silicon electronic devices; e.g., the 
switching frequencies of printed transistors are still several 
orders of magnitude lower than their silicon counterparts. 
 Moreover, 
highly 
integrated 
circuits 
such 
as 
microcontrollers cannot yet be realized by printing. 
Therefore, a hybrid approach for the fabrication of more 
complex electronic systems on flexible polymer substrates 
seems to be an interesting solution in the medium term to 
overcome the still low performance of printed complex 
elements [30] [31]. Marjanović et al. define hybrid electronic 
integration as the combination of printed components and 
surface-mount technology (SMT) devices on foils [30].  
For demonstration of a hybrid intralayer-integration 
approach, the conductive trace structure of a flip-flop circuit 
shown in [31] was first printed with silver nanoparticle ink 
on a PET film. 
Then SMT components were connected to the conductive 
traces with silver flake based conductive adhesive. Figure 1 
shows the realized flip-flop circuit. Tests with these circuits 
indicated that the system is sensitive to mechanical stress 
such as bending. Either the conductive adhesive that 
connects the SMT components fails or the conductive traces 
crack or delaminate from the substrate. In order to improve 
the structure’s resistance to mechanical stress, the 
microstructure of the printed traces has to be investigated, as 
it directly affects the mechanical properties of the printed 
feature and is of high importance for reliable circuits [32].  
After this introduction to hybrid electronics based on 
functional printing, in Section II, the materials and methods 
are described that were used for realizing test structures. In 
Section II.A, the analysis method is outlined, in Section II.B, 
the test structure is described, in Section II.C, the applied 
inkjet printer, the silver ink and the PET substrate are 
presented. Section II.D illustrates the printing process and 
Section II.E the sample preparation that is needed for the 
analysis of the cross sections. In Section III, the results of the 
printing process (Section III.A), the sample preparation 
(Section III.B) and the SEM analysis of the fabricated cross 
sections (Section III.C) are outlined. Finally, Section IV 
gives a conclusion and an outlook.

II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Analysis workflow 
The method for the analysis of the nano- and 
microstructure of printed structures on flexible polymer 
films demonstrated in the present paper is based on a 
workflow composed of the process steps for sample 
preparation, the ultrathin sectioning and the analysis itself. 
Figure 2 shows the workflow of this method. After printing 
and curing of a test structure on a flexible polymer substrate, 
rectangular samples were taken. These samples were 
embedded into an epoxy resin and cured subsequently. 
Afterwards, the resulting sample blocks were trimmed and 
sectioned with the ultramicrotome. Scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) images were taken from the sections and 
analyzed afterwards. 
B. Test structure 
 A test structure was defined for the electrical and 
mechanical evaluation of the properties of different ink-
substrate-printer-combinations and different 
processing 
parameters. The test structure conceived for electrical and 
mechanical characterization consists of a 45 mm long 
conductive trace (L) that connects two contact pads each 
having a length (B) of 7 mm and a width (T) of 2 mm. 
Figure 3 shows the geometry of the test structure (top) and 
some inkjet-printed samples (bottom). 
C. Materials 
The printer used for printing the test structures is based 
on a custom-built piezo-driven four-axis positioning system 
NAMOSE. 
It 
has 
a 
working 
space 
of 
400 mm x 150 mm x 40 mm, a repeatability of less than 
1 µm and a maximum speed of 200 mm/s [5]. The 
NAMOSE system is controlled by a Beckhoff-CX2040 with 
TwinCAT, programmable logic controller (PLC) and 
numerical control (NC) axis controlling. For inkjet-printing, 
the positioning system is equipped with a piezo-electrically 
driven single nozzle Microfab print head (MJ-AL-01-50-
8MX) with an orifice diameter of 50 µm [5]. A NC-task 
synchronizes the droplet frequency (fd) with the axis velocity 
(v), while the droplet distance (dd) is maintained at its set 
point. Furthermore, the NAMOSE system is equipped with a 
heated vacuum chuck and an optical observation system for 
controlling and adjusting droplet formation. 
The silver-nanoparticle ink DGP 40LT-15C (Advanced 
Nano Products (ANP)) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich 
(736465 ALDRICH). The ink has a solid content of 30 -
 35 wt % of silver nanoparticles of less than or equal to 
50 nm diameter, a surface tension of 35 - 38 mN/m, a 
viscosity of about 10 - 17 mPa·s and is designed for 
application on polymer films. The manufacturer recommends 
a curing regime with 30 - 60 minutes at 120 - 150 °C. The 
main solvent of the ink is triethylene glycol monoethyl ether 
(TGME) [33]. The ink contains polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) 
as capping agent that leads to an electrostatic stabilization of 
the nanoparticles [14]. 
In the present work, two different PET-films were used 
as substrates. The 125 µm thick Melinex® ST506™ from 
DuPont Teijin Films is optimized for printed electronics. 
Both sides of this film are pre-treated for improved adhesion 
of inks [19]. The NB-TP-3GU100 from Mitsubishi Paper 
Mills is a 135 µm thick PET-film that is optimized for inkjet-
printing of conductive structures based on silver nanoparticle 
dispersions. Due to its optimized nanoporous single side 
coating, it provides fast drying of water-based inks [34]. The 
thickness, morphology and the surface chemistry of this 
coating are not further specified by the supplier. 
D. Printing samples 
Test structures were printed on both substrates using the 
ink DGP 40LT-15C. The piezo-inkjet-device was actuated 
with a standard trapezoidal waveform. Figure 4 left 
illustrates the applied waveform. Figure 4 right shows the 
resulting droplet formation. For all samples, the waveform 
parameter trise was 3.0 µs, tdwell was 28.0 µs and tfall 3.0 µs.

For the samples A, C and D, Udwell was 38.0 V. For sample 
B, Udwell was 35.0 V. 
Table I shows the printing parameters for four different 
samples. After printing, the samples were cured in a 
convection oven (Memmert UP 500) for about 60 min. at 
120 °C.  
After curing, the width of the central part of the test 
structure (see the red box in Figure 3) was measured by 
optical microscopy and image processing with the DIPLOM 
software that was developed at the KIT Institute for Applied 
Computer Science (IAI). The image processing yields the 
line width and its standard deviation which can be used as an 
indicator of the line edge quality.  
E. Sample preparation for SEM-analysis 
For analyzing the cross section in the central area of the 
printed traces, about 10 mm long and 1.5 mm wide 
rectangular specimen were cut from the printed test 
structures (see the red box in Figure 3). 
As it is not possible at ambient conditions, to directly cut 
the flexible polymer with an ultramicrotome without 
delamination of the ink, the printed samples need to be 
embedded into a polymer in order to achieve proper sections. 
Two different specimens were embedded parallel to each 
other into one embedding mould. 
As embedding resin, the Embed 812 Kit from Electron 
Microscopy Sciences was used. The filled embedding 
moulds were cured over night at 60 °C in a convection oven.  
After polymerization, the resulting blocks with the 
embedded samples were removed from the moulds and then 
prepared for ultramicrotome sectioning. For this purpose, the 
blocks were trimmed in a Leica Ultracut 7 ultramicrotome 
using a standard glass trimming knife. Then, sections of 
100 nm and 200 nm thickness were cut with the same 
instrument but with a Diatome Ultra 35° knife at ambient 
conditions. The knife boat was filled with double-distilled 
water during the cutting process. To avoid electrostatic 
charging of the sample, a Diatome static line 2 ionizer was 
used. The cut sections are floating on the water surface of the 
knife boat, where they can be subsequently picked up and 
placed on a silicon wafer for imaging in the scanning 
electron microscope (SEM).  
For SEM imaging, an Ultra 55 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, 
Oberkochen, Germany) was used. Particle density in the 
SEM images of the cross sections was measured with the 
software package Fiji [35]. 
Figure 5 illustrates the approach to determine the particle 
density by image segmentation. The threshold for the 
segmentation was manually selected for different details of a 
SEM-image of a cross section. The particles density in the 
sectional plane was calculated for each detail. 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Printing and curing 
In a preliminary test, it was found that the behavior of 
the ink after deposition at room temperature is completely 
different on the two different substrates. Although the initial 
wetting 
seems 
to 
be 
good, 
printing 
on 
the 
Melinex® ST506™ substrate is followed by a continuous 
parasitic spreading combined with a resulting shape similar 
to a coffee-ring effect. This results in very flat, broad and 
fringed traces, with poor edge quality. The nanoporous 
coating of the PET-film from Mitsubishi Paper Mills avoids 
this ink spreading over a broad range of droplet-distances 
dd. A considerable trace height can be achieved, even for 
narrow traces. Optimizing the droplet-distance (dd), it is 
even possible to print continuous traces with a width of less 
than the diameter of a single droplet. Figure 6 shows 
microscope images of this preliminary test. The printing 
parameters were the same for both substrates: the jetting 
frequency (fd) was 2000 Hz, the axis speed (v) was 
100 mm/s and the droplet-distance (dd) results in 50 µm. 
The silver trace on Melinex® ST506™ (see Figure 6 left) 
shows a poor edge quality, a width of about 1180 µm and a 
height in the range of about 100 nm, whereas the trace 
printed on NB-TP-3GU100 (see Figure 6 right) has a good 
edge quality at a width of about 88 µm and a height of about 
1140 nm.

In further tests, it was found that printing on Melinex® 
ST506™, with 80 °C substrate temperature results in much 
better trace quality. This parameter was maintained for all 
subsequent tests with this substrate.  
Concerning the sintering in a convection oven, an 
irreversible warping of the NB-TP-3GU100 can be observed 
when heating above Tg of PET. This warpage potentially 
induces an initial strain into the printed structures, which 
may lead to damages such as cracks and delamination. A 
possible explanation for this effect could be different 
thermal 
expansion 
coefficients 
of 
the 
single-side 
nanoporous coating and the PET bulk material. The 
Melinex® ST506™ substrate does not show such an effect. 
B. Ultramicrotome sectioning 
Figure 7 shows the block with the embedded specimens 
(left, a and b), the top of the block during trimming with the 
glass knife (center, c) and a section directly after cutting 
(right). 
200 nm sections can be cut reproducibly but with a 
significant wrinkling of the embedding material along the 
edges of the embedded specimens (see Figure 7 right, d and 
e). Lower section thicknesses led to delamination between 
specimen and embedding resin due to this wrinkling. 
Different cutting directions were evaluated with respect 
to the sample orientation in the block: perpendicular, 
parallel and at an angle to the embedded substrate plane. 
Figure 8 shows typical results indicating the effect of the 
cutting direction (red arrows). 
When cutting is performed perpendicular to the substrate 
plane, the interface between the ink and the substrate is 
being compressed and can therefore not be used for further 
investigation of the interface. Additionally, this section 
shows many wrinkles and dominant knife marks (see 
Figure 8 left). In contrast, sections obtained when cutting 
parallel to the substrate plane, show less wrinkles and knife 
marks (see Figure 8 center). It is assumed that this cutting 
direction introduces fewer mechanical stresses to the 
interface between ink and substrate. The sections obtained, 
when cutting at an angle of about 26° to the substrate plane, 
were also acceptable (see Figure 8 right). The embedded 
NB-TP-3GU100 substrate (see Figure 8 a and c) produces 
much more wrinkles than the Melinex® ST506™ (see 
Figure 8 b and d). We suppose that Melinex® film is harder 
than the Mitsubishi film due to its heat and surface 
treatment. This can explain why the sections of NB-TP-
3GU100 specimen show a stronger wrinkling than the 
Melinex® substrate. 
C.  SEM analysis and image segmentation  
 Despite varying the cutting direction, a certain degree of 
section wrinkling was unavoidable. This led to a 
degradation of the sections in terms of cracks. Sometimes 
delamination occurred in the section while cutting. Figure 9 
shows a section from a NB-TP-3GU100 substrate cut 
parallel to the substrate plane (I). It can be seen that the 
substrate was torn during the cutting process (see Figure 9 I) 
and the printed ink delaminates from the coated substrate at 
the locations of the wrinkles (II and III). 
Nevertheless, there are enough regions suitable for 
further analysis (compare Figure 9 II and III), since the 
cutting preserved the nanostructure of the cross section. 
Table II summarizes some of the results obtained from 
the analysis of images from SEM and optical microscopy of 
the printed samples. 
Using the SEM-images, the line width was measured in 
the cross sections. It can be seen that there is a discrepancy 
between both results for the line width. For the samples B 
and D, the discrepancy is stronger than for the other samples. 
The samples B and D were taken from the line ends, where a 
decrease in line width can be detected for both samples via 
optical microscopy. Therefore, the line widths measured 
using the SEM-images cannot be compared to the line width 
obtained from the optical scanning of the printed and

sintered lines (as described in Section II.D).  
In the case of the samples A and C that were taken from 
the middle of the lines, both values for the line width can be 
compared. For A, the line width measured from the REM-
image is about 76 % of the line width calculated from the 
optical scanning data. For the sample C, this value is about 
86 %. For both substrates, there is a wrinkling induced 
“shrinkage” of the measured line width in the range of 14 to 
24 % of the line width due to the ultramicrotome-cutting 
process at an angle of about 6° between the cutting direction 
and the substrate’s surface. The wrinkles coming out of the 
section plane are the results of that process. Table II also 
shows the results of the measurements of the ink layer 
thickness by SEM-image-analysis. 
The ratio of the ink layer thickness and the line width is 
about 0.09 % for the narrow line printed on Melinex® 
ST506™ (sample A). This ratio is about 0.86 % for a 
narrow line printed on NB-TP-3GU100 (sample C). The 
wide line on Melinex® ST506™ achieves a ratio of ink 
layer thickness and line width of about 0.28 % (sample B) 
whereas this ratio is about 0.61 % for NB-TP-3GU100 
(sample D). The actual cutting angles for all four samples 
are also given in Table II. 
Figure 10 shows the cross section of the samples B (I) 
and D (II). The full low magnification cross section for each 
sample can be seen on the top, a detail image can be found 
on the bottom for each sample. Using such high 
magnification images from SEM the particle density of each 
sample according to the procedure described above has been 
determined. The particle density of the conductive traces 
calculated for all four samples was between 58 % and 65 %. 
The particle density is slightly higher for structures printed 
on Melinex® ST506™ than on Mitsubishi NB-TP-3GU100. 
For the samples A and B the particle density is about 65 % 
and 61 %, respectively. In the case of the samples C and D, 
the particle density was calculated to about 60 % and 58 %. 
Moreover, from these SEM images, it can be derived that 
the cross section of the traces printed on Melinex® ST506™ 
tapers off towards the line edges (see the blue box in 
Figure 10 I). In contrast, the height of the silver trace on NB-
TP-3GU100 only decreases close to the edges (see the blue 
box in Figure 10 II). An off leveling ratio of the line’s 
thickness towards its edges was determined for the different 
samples. Figure 11 illustrates the determination of the off 
leveling ratio. The ink layer thickness was measured in small 
steps starting in the middle of the cross section moving 
towards the edges. The two points T80 where the ink layer 
thickness falls below 80 % of the ink layer thickness in the 
middle of the cross section Tm delimit the segment WT80 of 
the cross section. Formula (1) defines the off leveling ratio 
OL. 
OL =  
W − WT80
W
∙ 100 % 
(1) 
The obtained value gives an impression of the ink 
layer thickness across the line width. It can be seen, that the 
off leveling is stronger for the substrate Melinex® ST506™ 
than for the NB-TP-3GU100. For the sample B, the off 
leveling ratio is about 43.8 %, for the sample C, it is 24.4 % 
and for the sample D, the off leveling ratio is 24.6 %. The off 
leveling ratio seems to be characteristic for a given substrate 
(compare values for samples B and D) and independent of 
the line width (compare values for samples C and D). 
Figure 12 shows SEM images of the samples A (I) and C 
(II). In the segment at the bottom of Figure 12 it can be seen 
that the ink layer thickness of the sample C (II) is higher than 
for sample A. 
Figure 13 shows SEM images of one section containing 
both samples B and D. It can be seen that the wrinkling is 
stronger for the NB-TP-3GU100 substrate than for the 
Melinex® ST506™. In can be supposed that Melinex® 
ST506™ is stiffer than NB-TP-3GU100 and that the 
embedding resin is more or less as hard as Melinex®

ST506™. This finding confirms the observation described 
above (Section III.B). 
Moreover, Figure 13 I shows that in sample A larger 
silver particles have been ripped out of the conductive trace 
and are smeared into the embedding resin. This indicates that 
the embedding and cutting process have to be further 
optimized. Using different SEM- and optical microscope 
images, the the substrate thickness has been measured. For 
Melinex® ST506™ a substrate thickness of 127.9 µm +/- 2.0 
µm was determined. The Mitsubishi NB-TP-3GU100 has a 
thickness of 138.2 +/- 2.5 µm, whereof the nanoporous layer 
is 38.3 µm +/- 1.0 µm. 
The comparatively high thickness of this layer supports 
the hypothesis stated above (Section III.A) that this might be 
the main reason for the warping of the substrate after thermal 
sintering. There was no indication for sectioning or 
embedding process related changes of substrate thickness, 
neither for the bulk substrate nor for the porous coating. 
With proper cutting parameters (angle between cutting 
direction and substrate plane) the influence on the ink layer 
thickness should be minimal. Section wrinkling due to 
stiffness incompatibilities between substrate and embedding 
materials is probably the only remarkable deformation of the 
samples during the whole sectioning process. 
IV. 
   CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK 
A method was outlined for analyzing the nano- and 
microstructure of inkjet printed conductive traces on 
different 
polymer 
substrates 
using 
ultramicrotome 
sectioning and SEM imaging. Our results confirm the 
finding by Melo [4]. The sections produced showed 
wrinkling along the substrate plane partially leading to 
delamination. This may result from stiffness differences 
between the substrate material and the embedding resin, a 
parameter to be optimized in further investigations. Despite 
the resulting delaminations, there were enough regions that 
could be used for investigation of the nanoparticle network 
of the printed conductive traces. This indicates that with 
properly optimized embedding and cutting parameters, the 
described scheme is a promising method for analyzing 
thermal, mechanical and chemical influences on the 
morphology of printed metal nanoparticle inks and on the 
interface between substrate and ink.
