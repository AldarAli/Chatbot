Abstract—Antarctic and Arctic sea ice characteristics are 
starkly contrasted. Antarctic sea ice is encapsulated by a 
frontal ice zone (FIZ), which is a circumpolar band of sea ice 
consisting of older and thicker ice adjacent to the ice edge, 
while Arctic sea ice contains younger and thinner ice in the 
marginal ice zone along the ice edge.  Here we examine the 
distribution and properties of the FIZ using NASA remote 
sensing data from a satellite scatterometer and from Operation 
IceBridge.  Results show that the FIZ is a persistent feature, 
where sea ice is continually built up by a supply of younger sea 
ice effectively produced and transported from the internal ice 
pack. During the ice growth season, the FIZ becomes rougher, 
due to ice deformation and ridging, and thereby thicker.  Also 
sustained by westerly winds and currents, the FIZ supports the 
maintenance of the ice cover.  Future coordinated campaigns 
with surface and aircraft observations, together with high-
resolution multi-dimensional measurements by the TanDEM-X 
satellite polarimetric and interferometric radar, are crucial to 
characterize, understand, and predict Antarctic sea ice change.

 INTRODUCTION 
The total extent of Antarctic sea ice has been preserved 
and even slightly increased in contrast to the drastic decrease 
of Arctic sea ice in recent decades.  The opposite behavior in 
the interdecadal change of Antarctic and Arctic sea ice is 
considered by scientists as a paradox [1]-[4], which the 
cryospheric science research community has been struggling 
to explain.  The stratospheric ozone depletion was suggested 
to cause atmospheric change that would maintain Antarctic 
sea ice [5][6]; however, this explanation was challenged by 
Sigmond and Fyfe [7]. Others relied on fresh meltwater and 
salinity reduction [8][9] and on wind effects [10][11] to 
address the paradox while leaving several issues unresolved.   
For an explanation of the polar sea ice paradox to be 
plausible, it requires self-consistent answers simultaneously 
to all of these science questions about Antarctic sea ice: (1) 
What are the most effective processes for sea ice production 
pertaining to Antarctic conditions? (2) What are the factors 
protecting the sea ice cover? (3) What are the factors 
sustaining sea ice? (4) What are the factors causing regional 
variability? (5) Is there any discord among these factors? (6) 
Why do opposite effects occur in Antarctic and Arctic sea ice 
while both have to obey the same physics?  
In a recent publication [12] using satellite and surface 
observations to address the above science questions, Nghiem 
et al. have presented an original research that ‘gives a 
plausible explanation for the difference in the Arctic and 
Antarctic sea ice response to the climate change of recent 
decades’ as noted by the peer review.  A key finding is the 
formation of a formidable circumpolar FIZ that shields and 
thereby protects the internal younger and thinner sea ice.  
Here we further examine the characteristics of the FIZ in 
the Southern Ocean encircling Antarctica.  Remote sensing 
data used in this study include both satellite and aircraft data.  
In Section II, we present results from radar backscatter data, 
collected by the SeaWinds scatterometer aboard the 
QuikSCAT satellite (QS) in 1999-2009. Section III shows 
observations from aircraft acquired during the NASA’s 
Operation IceBridge (OiB) in 2009 together with the satellite 
results.   Section IV highlights the characteristics of the FIZ 
in sustaining Antarctic sea ice, and presents a concept for 
future Antarctic field campaigns with coordinated surface, 
aircraft, and satellite observations, including TanDEM-X 
synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to advance sea ice science. 
The last section provides the summary and conclusion. 
II. 
SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS 
The immense extent of Antarctic sea ice requires satellite 
observations such as QS to identify and map different sea ice 
classes with different physical characteristics.  QS was 
launched from the space complex at Vandenberg Air Force 
Base, California, in June 1999.  QS radar backscatter data 
were acquired globally across orbit swaths as wide as 1800 
km with a resolution of ~25 km and an accuracy of 0.2 dB 
for 3σ [13]. To observe the FIZ, QS satellite data were used 
in the sea ice classification algorithm developed by Nghiem 
et al. [12].  Their results revealed a band of circumpolar FIZ 
containing older and rougher sea ice in the zone adjacent to 
the sea ice edge, surrounding the internal sea ice pack 
consisting of younger and smoother sea ice.  QS results in 
2008 and on 22 September for each year in 1999-2009 
identified the persistent existence of the FIZ [12].   
We now use QS data in 2009 to observe how the FIZ 
evolves during the sea ice growth season from May through 
the peak sea ice extent in September (Figure 1).  The ice 
classes include rough older sea ice (RI), older sea ice (OI), 
younger sea ice (YI), melt on sea ice, and permanent ice as 
defined in the published literature [12].  Results in Figure 1 
confirmed that the circumpolar FIZ, composed of RI and OI, 
had already formed by May in 2009.  Encapsulating YI in 
the internal sea ice pack around Antarctica, the presence of 
the FIZ was persistent throughout the sea ice growth season 
as the ice cover expanded and reached its largest extent in 
September 2009. In particular along the longitude of 3.38o,

sea ice advanced northward away from Antarctica to reach 
around Bouvet Island in August and could not extend much 
farther north in September 2009.  The constraint of the sea 
ice edge near Bouvet Island is a recurrent feature also found 
in other years in 1999-2008 [12]. 
During the 2009 seasonal evolution of the Antarctic sea 
ice cover, the FIZ advanced outward in the circumpolar zone 
adjacent to the sea ice edge while the areal extent of the 
internal YI enlarged (Figure 1).  This was due to persistent 
winds shaped by the Antarctic continental topography [12], 
forcing the transport of the internally produced YI outward 
to supply sea ice that continually built up and reinforced the 
FIZ along its south side.  Some minor zonal areas of transient 
melt occurred on the surface of sea ice at different times in 
various locations near the sea ice edge (Figure 1).  
III. 
OPERATION ICEBRIDGE MEASUREMENTS 
Measurements from the OiB can provide relevant data to 
characterize the FIZ in more detail.   The OiB is a NASA 
mission using aircraft to survey the Earth’s polar ice to 
obtain three-dimensional view of Arctic and Antarctic ice 
sheets, ice shelves, and sea ice [14].  OiB flights have been 
conducted in September-November over various Antarctic 
locations in multiple years.  We use OiB data acquired along 
the 3600-km Seelye Loop over the Weddell Sea in 2009 by 
the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) and by the Digital 
Mapping System (DMS).  ATM is a scanning laser altimeter 
developed at the NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, 
and DMS is an airborne digital high-resolution camera 
maintained and operated by the Airborne Sensor Facility at 
the NASA Ames Research Center in California. 
ATM measurements include surface elevation, slope, and 
roughness [15] with a sample width of 80 m and a pacing of 
40 m on the surface along the flight track.  Figure 2 presents 
ATM roughness along the OiB Seelye Loop flight on 24 
October 2009, overlaid on a QS map of synoptic sea ice 
classes on the same day for comparison.  The ATM 
roughness data have been averaged in each bin of 0.25o × 
0.25o in latitude and longitude along the OiB flight line. 
Overall, ATM observations show the largest roughness on 
RI, medium roughness on OI, and smaller roughness on YI.  
This is consistent with the general characteristics of the 
synoptic sea ice classes [12].  However, there is some 
discrepancy due to a mismatch in the spatial resolution of 
ATM and QS data to be cautioned in the comparison. 
DMS data are processed to obtain geolocated and 
orthorectified images that represent the surface topography 
or digital elevation model (DEM). DMS DEM has a relative 
accuracy of ~0.2 m and a resolution of 10 cm × 10 cm [16] 
over a swath width of several hundred meters depending on 
 
Figure 1. Antarctic synoptic sea ice classes throughout the ice growth season in 2009 observed by QS satellite data. Bouvet Island is marked by white cross.

the flight altitude.  Within the DMS DEM accuracy limit, 
areas with pronounced features on sea ice surface such as 
deformed sea ice, ruble ice, pressure ridges, and other large-
scale roughness [17] can be identified and statistically 
categorized over various sea ice classes. A 2-km segment of 
DMS DEM reveals a complicated surface of snow-covered 
sea ice varying over a range of more than 3 m (Figure 3).  
IV. 
DISCUSSIONS 
The characteristics of the Antarctic circumpolar FIZ 
consisting of formidable sea ice are directly opposite to the 
feeble ice conditions in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) 
consisting of young and thin ice along the edge of the Arctic 
sea ice cover.  As presented, the FIZ consists of older sea ice 
grown earlier in the sea ice season and gradually advanced 
outward away from the Antarctic coast.  The FIZ is 
continually built up by a supply of ice from the internal YI 
that can grow efficiently with a high growth rate, while the 
FIZ is furthermore sustained by a recirculation driven by 
persistent westerly winds and currents [12]. As observed in 
Figure 2, the FIZ has a larger roughness, corresponding a 
larger thickness as Toyota et al. [18] demonstrate that the 
mean ice thickness of Antarctic sea ice correlates with the 
surface roughness even better than with the mean freeboard.  
Persistently consisting of thicker ice, the circumpolar FIZ 
serves as a shield to protect the Antarctic sea ice cover. This 
is in a stark contrast to the Arctic MIZ that is easily reduced 
by melt and by wind and wave effects, making Arctic sea ice 
vulnerable to climate change. QS satellite scatterometer data 
acquired in 1999-2009, Oceansat-2 collected in 2009-2014, 
and SCATSAT-1 to be obtained in 2016-2021 together 
provide interdecadal observations of sea ice change.

To fully quantify the properties of the FIZ and to 
determine 
its 
long-term 
change 
demand 
extensive 
observations from the surface to aircraft and satellite levels 
at multiple scales in time and in space across the vast extent 
of the Southern Ocean over decades.  This is particularly 
important to advance Antarctic science research, as there 
have been overwhelmingly more observations and modeling 
activities for the Arctic.  A potential approach is to maximize 
the science return from the NASA’s significant investment in 
the current OiB by developing a collaborative coordination 
with a future acquisition of a massive satellite SAR dataset, 
such as TanDEM-X [19] acquired over the Antarctic sea ice 
cover at its seasonal maximum extent, typically reached in 
the month of September or October. 
The conceptual science plan is to conduct multi-phase 
surveys to obtain contemporaneous and collocated OiB and 
TanDEM-X data in conjunction with surface measurements 
using buoys, stations, and field observations from Antarctic 
icebreaker expeditions and drone operations.  OiB ATM data 
can be used to calibrate DMS DEM, and then to compare 
with and correctly interpret TanDEM-X data in two (2D) and 
three dimensions (3D).  While OiB can provide accurate and 
high-resolution measurements, the aircraft data are limited to 
a finite number of flight lines with pointwise or narrow-strip 
measurements.  Once verified with OiB results, TanDEM-X 
can provide multiple measurements of sea ice properties 
across the vast coverage over Antarctic sea ice at its 
maximum extent, which may take more than 55 days to 
complete the massive TanDEM-X SAR data acquisition.   
A major advantage is that the TanDEM-X SAR has 
monostatic, 
bistatic, 
polarimetric, 
and 
single-pass 
interferometric capabilities for robust ice and open water 
identification [20], sea ice classification [21], ice drift 
measurement [22][23], and DEM assessment [23] at a high 
resolution. For instance, open water detected by TanDEM-X 
is a crucial reference to estimate the sea ice freeboard from 
collocated OiB data. Since radar backscatter is sensitive to 
sea ice roughness [12] that correlates with sea ice thickness 
[18], TanDEM-X 2D SAR backscatter patterns are an 
independent source of information to cross-verify 3D DEM 
results from remote sensing estimates.   Then, the 2D SAR 
backscatter can be used to examine the spatial distribution of 
roughness and thickness of Antarctic sea ice.  As DEM 
derived from SAR interferometry represents scattering center 
height, which is dependent on the penetration depth in snow-
covered sea ice as a function of the electromagnetic wave 
frequency, DEM of the snow surface from coordinated OiB 
DMS optical data is necessary to understand and interpret 
TanDEM-X 3D observations over different sea ice classes 
that can be mapped in 2D by TanDEM-X data [21].  
Moreover, the coordinated OiB/TanDEM-X Antarctic 
Science Campaign (OTASC) can be extended from sea ice 
into land to assess the DEM over terrestrial snow-covered 
ice, where the topography can shape wind patterns that exert 
a significant control on sea ice formation and evolution [12]. 
Figure 4 gives an example of TanDEM-X 2D and 3D 
observations of Antarctic sea ice surrounding Sturge Island 
to illustrate the versatility of the TanDEM-X capabilities.   
Moreover, a fully polarimetric interferometry theory for 
bistatic radars [24], inherently reduced to the case of 
monostatic radars as a special case, has been derived based 
on the fundamental basis of the first principle of Maxwell’s 
equations to preserve the phase information that is 
imperative for the interpretation of TanDEM-X polarimetric 
and interferometric data.  This is crucial as the foundation of 
electromagnetic physics for 2D and 3D SAR signatures of 
snow-covered sea ice and land ice to develop remote sensing 
algorithms, considering noise effects at various resolutions

topography is measured in 3D by TanDEM-X interferometry.

specifically required by different science research objectives. 
Results from aircraft and satellite algorithms can then be 
validated by surface truth and observations collected during 
Antarctic field campaign expeditions coordinated with 
remote sensing overflights.   
The international community report on Global Satellite 
Observation Requirements for Floating Ice – Focusing on 
Synthetic Aperture Radar, specifically calls for the use of 
TanDEM-X capabilities to observe sea ice [25] in the 
Strategic Plan 2015-2018 of the Polar Space Task Group 
operated under the auspices of the World Meteorological 
Organization Executive Council Panel of Experts on Polar 
and High Mountain Observations, Research, and Services 
[26].  In view of multiple satellite missions for Earth science, 
results from the OiB/TanDEM-X coordinated campaign can 
serve as a reference to compare with results from future 
satellite missions such as the NISAR mission [27], the 
ICESat-2 mission [28], and the proposed Tandem-L mission 
[29].  From these missions, long-term validated remote 
sensing observations will be crucial as input to as well as 
verification of models for Antarctic sea ice seasonal 
prediction and decadal projection.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 
The Antarctic circumpolar FIZ is examined in this paper.  
Observations from remote sensing data show that the FIZ 
forms with sea ice produced earlier in the ice-growth season. 
Then the FIZ becomes older, rougher, and thicker as the 
Antarctic sea ice extent reaches its seasonal maximum in the 
austral winter-spring transition.  In contrast to the feeble MIZ 
in the Arctic, the persistent FIZ encapsulates and protects the 
younger and thinner ice in the internal ice cover, and thereby 
contributes to the maintenance of Antarctic sea ice.  The 
future OTASC field campaign is formulated to characterize 
the FIZ quantitatively, and to obtain a basic reference for 
comparisons with observations from future satellite missions 
to determine interdecadal change of Antarctic sea ice.
