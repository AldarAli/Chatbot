Abstract— Elderly people, especially walking disabilities, have 
an increased risk of falling and consequently injuring 
themselves. They need to be prevented from falling to maintain 
their health because injuries from falling are a major reason for 
them to be hospitalized or placed in residential care. Motion 
capture systems are a key component to prevent falls. We 
comparably analyzed walking gait cycle between healthy people 
and walking disabilities using a wearable device (WD) and 
KINECT to detect warning signs of falls. In this paper, we 
experimentally clarify what signs are useful to prevent falls. We 
developed a gait monitoring device comprised of a smartphone 
application and a pair of shoes on which WDs are mounted to 
measure such warning signs, and proposed presentation 
formats for data measured by KINETC.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
The authors comparably analyzed walking gait cycles 
between healthy people and walking disabilities using gait 
monitoring shoes on which wearable devices (WDs) were 
mounted [1]. 
As the percentage of elderly people in the populations is 
increasing around the world [2], the number of functionally 
impaired people, such as cerebrovascular patients who are 
paralyzed down one side, will also increase. These people 
have an increased risk of falling and consequently injuring 
themselves [3][4]. Falling down is one of the main reasons for 
them to be hospitalized or placed in residential care. 
There are many studies on falls by elderly people. The 
World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe 
analyzed these studies and classified fall risks amongst elderly 
people by history of falls, age, gender, living alone, ethnicity, 
medicine, medical conditions, impaired mobility and gait, 
sedentary behavior, psychological status - fear of falling, 
nutritional deficiencies, visual impairments, and foot 
problems [4]. Stroke patients, such as those with 
cerebrovascular disease, especially are at a substantially high 
risk of falling [5][6][7][8]. Their higher frequency of falls is 
due to weak muscles, one-side paralysis, and downward-
pointing toes. For people with impaired mobility and gait, 
tripping is a major cause of falls [9][10], so we focus on 
tripping in this paper. 
Since weak muscles, one-side paralysis, and downward-
pointing toes strongly appear in the movement of legs and feet, 
motion capture for them is a key component to analyze 
impaired mobility and gait, and useful to prevent tripping, and 
conducts therapy and rehabilitation of hemiplegia.  
Here, we focus on extracting warning signs of tripping for 
walking disabilities, such as cerebrovascular patients. In this 
paper, a WD is mounted on a shoe to measure the acceleration 
and angle velocity, and Microsoft KINECT [11] is used to 
measure positions of each joint of the lower body. 
We obtained output data of an acceleration sensor and 
gyroscope sensor in a WD, Sony Smart Watch 3, mounted on 
the front part of a shoe to estimate the kicking power and 
change of angle between a foot and the floor. We noticed that 
the angle velocity at the terminal stance and the angle at the 
terminal swing are clearly different for unimpaired subjects 
and walking disabilities such as stroke. Moreover, they clearly 
have different step lengths as measured by KINECT. We also 
developed a monitoring device comprised of a smartphone 
application and a pair of shoes on which WDs were mounted, 
and proposed using the side and top view formats to present 
data measured by KINECT. 
After introducing related works in Section II, we consider 
how people trip on a flat floor in Section III. Different features 
between physically unimpaired students and walking 
disabilities such as stroke are extracted from measured data in 
Section IV. Gait monitoring shoes and monitoring application, 
and gait presentation format with a KINECT are introduced in 
Sections V and VI. Measuring and analyzing a walking gait 
for walking disabilities are described in Section VII. Finally, 
conclusions are summarized in Section VIII. 
II. 
RELATED WORKS 
In this section, we introduce motion capturing devices. 
A. Sensor usage type 
Weijun Tao et al. reviewed gait analysis technologies 
based on wearable sensors that were the accelerometer, 
gyroscope, electromagnetic tracking system, magneto-
resistive sensors, flexible goniometer, sensing fabric, force 
sensor, and so on [12]. They mentioned that fall risk 
estimation is an important application of gait analysis using 
wearable sensors. However, they did not describe about 
motion of gait for elderly people or walking disabilities. 
Stacy J. Morris Bamberg et al. developed a prototype shoe 
in which several kinds of wearable sensors, such as 
accelerometer, gyroscope, force sensor, bidirectional bend

sensor and so on [13]. The calibrated sensor outputs were 
almost same as results obtained simultaneously from a 
biological motion measuring equipment. They calculated the 
maximum pitch (angle between the shoe sole and floor at the 
toe-off timing), minimum pitch (angle between the shoe sole 
and floor at the heel-strike timing), the stride length from 
output of accelerometers and gyroscopes. They also compared 
the maximum pitch, minimum pitch and stride length between 
the healthy gait and parkinsonian gait. There were differences 
on mean value of calculated data between the healthy gait and 
parkinsonian gait. However, considering standard deviation of 
calculated data, such differences were small. They also did not 
measure and analyze motions of gait for elderly people or 
walking disabilities. 
Farzin Dadashi et al. measured motion of gait for many 
elderly people with shoe-worn inertial sensors and provided 
normative values for a clinician to measure reference gait 
parameters [14]. They analyzed motion of gait and clarified 
the difference in gait parameters, such as the clearance 
between a shoe sole and floor, gait speed, stride length 
between males and females by considering the effect of age 
factors. However, their data did not show differences clearly 
between the male and female, and the effect of age factor. And, 
they did not investigate data for walking disabilities or analyze 
reasons for tripping. 
Mourad Benoussaad et al. introduced a method to robustly 
estimate foot clearance during walking using a single inertial 
measurement unit (IMU) placed on the subject’s foot [15]. In 
their paper, the foot clearance was the height of ankle from a 
floor. However, the toe clearance is more critical for tripping. 
And, they did not measure the toe clearance for walking 
disabilities such as stroke and analyze reasons for tripping.  
B. Camera usage type 
Vicon is one of the most famous companies in the motion 
capture industry. They can measure complex motions of 
joints in a body [16]. Vicon’s system needs plural specialized 
video cameras, and know-how is needed to measure motions 
of joints. Thus, this system is too expensive for a small 
rehabilitation center or an individual to purchase and operate.  
KINECT is one of motion capture devices distributed by 
Microsoft [11]. Since its price is a few hundred dollars, it is 
possible for small rehabilitation facilities to introduce it. There 
are many researches that use KINECT. Obdrzalek et al. 
compared the Kinect pose estimation with more established 
techniques relying on motion capture data [17]. They said that 
system such as Kinect has significant potential as a low-cost 
alternative for real-time motion capture and body tracking in 
health applications. We also used KINECT for a remote 
rehabilitation system of which content was a standing-up 
training [18].  In this paper, three kinds of view method, that 
are the front-view, side-view and top-view, were introduced 
to present a strain of the upper body.  
III. 
CONSIDERATION OF TRIPPING FACTOR 
When the swing foot progression is unexpectedly 
obstructed, a trip occurs that leads to a forward rotation of the 
body and eventually might cause a fall.   
Mourad Benoussaad et al. measured the minimum toe 
clearance (MinTC) to avoid tripping [15]. MinTC is a critical 
value to clear obstacles on the ground or floor. However, 
elderly people, especially those who have had strokes, 
sometimes trip on flat ground or floors, not obstacles. In this 
section, we consider reasons a person trips on flat ground or 
floors. We divide the normal walking gait cycle into eight 
phases the same as Weijun Tao et al. as shown in Fig. 1 [12]: 
(1) initial contact (heel-strike timing), (2) loading response, 
(3) mid-stance, (4) terminal stance (toe-off timing), (5) pre-
swing, (6) initial swing, (7) mid-swing, and (8) terminal swing. 
 
 
Figure 1. Normal walking gait cycle (See a right foot) 
 
Most walking disabilities have weak muscles and are hard 
to raise their toe. They are at risk of three types of trips. 
- 
Case 1: A toe touches the floor first instead of a heel 
at phase 1. Since phases 2-5 are skipped, the toe is 
dragged along the floor. When the dragging strength 
is stronger than the person’s muscular power, he/she 
trips (Fig. 2(a)). 
- 
Case 2: Kicking power of the front part of a foot is 
insufficient at phases 4 and 5 to raise the heel and toe 
up from the floor. In this case, a person does not swing 
but shuffles. When the frictional force between a shoe 
sole and the ground or floor is stronger than his/her 
muscular power, he/she trips (Fig. 2(b)). 
- 
Case 3: A toe touches the floor due to it pointing down 
during the swing phases (5-8), and the knee goes 
further forward than the foot. When the dragging 
strength is stronger than the person’s muscular power, 
he/she trips (Fig. 2(c)).

The above problems suggest that the kicking power at 
phases 4 and 5 and the angle between the foot and a floor are 
critical parameters. 
 
IV. 
EXTRACTION OF WARNING SIGNS FOR TRIPPING 
In this section, we experimentally investigate whether the 
kicking power at phases 4 and 5, and the angle between the 
foot and lower limb are critical parameters. 
A. Experimental method 
Since kicking power must be expressed as the angle 
velocity or the acceleration for the foot, we mounted a WD 
which had an accelerometer and gyroscope on the foot. In this 
experiment, we used Sony SmartWatch 3 as a WD which is 
mounted on the front part of a foot with Velcro tape as shown 
in Fig. 3. This mounting position was same as one in Farzin 
Dadashi’s experiment [14]. The sampling rate was 40 msec.  
We measure angle velocity for up and down directions of 
the front part of the foot (X axis of a 3D gyroscope). We also 
adopted a three-point moving average of the angle velocity to 
calculate the angle, because output values extremely change 
up and down. Therefore, the angle for X axis Anglexn at time 
tn is calculated as follows. 
 
𝐴𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑛 = 𝐴𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒𝑥𝑛−1 + 
𝑡𝑛−𝑡𝑛−1
1000  × 
𝐺𝑥𝑛−1+𝐺𝑥𝑛+𝐺𝑥𝑛+1

       (1) 
 
Gxn is the value of angle velocity for X axis at time tn.  
We investigated the measuring accuracy of Sony 
SmartWatch 3 using a slant rule as shown in Fig. 4. We 
measured data five times. Calculated angles vs. angles given 
by the slant rule are listed in Table I. These data showed 
calculated angles were so accurate. We noticed drift errors of 
a gyroscope that increase the value by 0.2 rad. /sec. during a 
WD sets on a flat floor. However, each measurement lasted 
less than 20 sec. Therefore, we think the effect of the drift 
error is negligible.

We also measured the foot stride (FS) and recorded 
motions of subjects’ knees, ankles, and feet by using 
KINECT. The UNIX time was introduced to synchronously 
measure data with a WD and KINECT. 
We defined the FS as the maximum difference between 
positions of the right and left foot measured by KINECT as 
shown in Fig. 5. We experimentally looked for the height of 
KINECT to measure accurately. As the result, the height of 
KINECT is 75 cm. Moreover, we set the face angle of 
KINECT so that “+” markers on the display are 
superimposed on “-” markers on the floor to correct KINECT 
as shown in Fig. 6. From the bottom of the image in Fig. 6, 
these markers correspond to 2, 3, 4, and 5 m from KINECT. 
Since this picture is output of KINECT’s video camera, left 
and right are reversed.

the green line shows the length for the left foot minus the

length for the right foot. The minimum and maximum values 
of the green line very clearly correspond to FS for each step. 
Three-point moving average curves for measured data are 
shown in Fig. 7 (b) for reference. Circled parts correspond to 
movement of the feet from the mid-stance to terminal stance. 
Since the three-point moving average masks such feet 
motions, we decide to present a graph containing raw data.

We experimentally evaluated the accuracy of measured 
FSs. Participants were eight unimpaired university students. 
They walked on three sets of stride markers of 30, 60, and 70 
cm as shown in Fig. 8.

Experimental results are shown in Table II. Since the 
range within which KINECT can definitely measure is 
between 1.5 and 4.5 m, average values in Table II are 
averages of absolute values for strides between them. Errors 
were less than 10%, and the standard deviations were less 
than 3 cm. We evaluate the errors within allowance.

B. Measured data and consideration 
We measured the acceleration, angle velocity and angle 
for five physically unimpaired students and three walking 
disabilities using a WD as same as the former sub-section. 
Every walking disabilities in this experiment had one-side 
paralysis, and trained periodically at a rehabilitation facility. 
Some of them used a wheel chair and could not walk by 
himself before training. They walked along a straight line to 
MS-KINECT. A WD was attached on the front part of foot 
on the paralysis side as shown in Fig. 9. We measured data 
for each patient two times.

    rehabilitation facility 
Figure 9. Measurement environment in rehabilitation facility 
 
Figs. 10 and 11 show examples of change of acceleration, 
angle velocity, and angle for a physically unimpaired student 
and a walking disability. Data for two steps are plotted.  
Each flat period (roughly the center period) in these 
figures is when the entire shoe sole touched the floor; this 
period corresponds to phases 2 (loading response) and 3 
(mid-stance). The reason that the value during this period is 
not zero is that the WD measures the angle between the front 
part of the foot and the floor, which depends on the person 
and shoe. Therefore, we reset this angle for the gait 
monitoring shoes described in Section V when the entire shoe 
sole touched the floor. This processing enables the WD to 
measure the angle between the back of the foot and the floor, 
and removes the drift error of the gyroscope. This value does 
not depend on person or shoe. 
The maximum angle velocity at timing A means the 
kicking power from phase 4 (terminal stance) to 5 (pre-
swing), and the minimum angle at timing B means the angle 
to the floor at phase 8 (terminal swing).

Lower angle velocity at A in Fig. 10 is about 420 deg./sec. 
On the other hand, higher angle velocity at A in Fig. 11 is 
about 250 deg./sec. Thus, a physically unimpaired student 
and a walking disability obviously differ in terms of gait. The 
walking disability clearly has weaker kicking power at phase 
4 (terminal stance) than the physically unimpaired student.  
 
 
Figure 10. Changes of angle velocity, angle, and acceleration for physically 
unimpaired student  
 
 
Figure 11. Changes of angle velocity, angle, and acceleration for walking 
disability 
Higher angle at B in Fig. 10 is about -18degree. On the 
other hand, lower angle at B in Fig. 11 is about -8degree. 
Thus, a physically unimpaired student and a walking 
disability obviously differ in terms of the angle to a floor at 
phase 8 (terminal swing). This shows that it is difficult for a 
walking disability to raise his or her toe at the terminal swing 
phase. 
The other hand, the acceleration basically changes 
corresponding to the angle velocity and angle. However, they 
have much noise, and their amplitudes are not stable. 
Tables III and IV list the averages and standard deviations 
(SDs) of measured data for angle velocity at timing A and 
angle at timing B. The angle velocity at timing A is clearly 
different between unimpaired students and walking 
disabilities. There is a big difference between them in the 
angle at timing B, however, this value would have sometimes 
overlapped each other.

We also measured the FS using KINECT, and the cadence 
for a gait using a WD and KINECT. Table V lists the 
averages and SDs of measured data for the strides. In this 
paper, we define the cadence as the number of steps per 
minute. We estimated the cadence derived from an average 
of 10 intervals between one timing A and the next A, which 
were peak angle velocities of a step, when a WD was used. 
Estimated cadences are listed in Table VI.  
There are clearly differences between unimpaired 
participants and walking disabilities in terms of the FS. FSs 
of walking disabilities are more than 10 cm shorter than those 
of unimpaired participants. On the other hand, the cadences 
of walking disabilities are slightly faster than those of 
unimpaired participants. Most physiotherapists said that FSs 
of elderly people, especially walking disabilities, are usually 
shorter than those of unimpaired people. These data prove 
what physiotherapists know experimentally.

On the basis of the results of these experiments, we 
decided to adopt the angle velocity at the terminal stance 
to initial swing, angle between a foot and floor at the 
terminal swing, and average FS to detect warning signs of 
falls. Section V introduces a pair of shoes and smartphone 
application to measure angle and angle velocity, and Section 
VI shows presentation formats for data measured by 
KINECT. 
V. 
GAIT MONITORING DEVICE 
A. Shoes 
A WD has to be attached somewhere on a body during 
walking to detect signs of tripping to prevent a fall. A WD 
was attached to the front part of the foot in Section IV. 
However, it is difficult for a WD to firmly be set at this place 
for a long time because it is easily detached. Therefore, we 
studied which position is the best to detect the change of 
angle velocity for a foot and angle between a foot and floor. 
We attached WDs to a heel and a lower limb as shown in Fig. 
12.  
For this test, we used STEVAL-WESU1 by STMicro-
electronics (see Fig. 13) as a WD instead of Sony 
SmartWatch 3. This wearable unit includes four sensors: 
- 
3D-accelerometer, 
- 
3D-gyroscope, 
- 
3D-magnetometer, 
- 
MEMS pressure. 
 
This device is 37 x 40 x 8 mm and weighs 9.6 g. 
We inserted STEVAL-WESU1 into the heel of a shoe as 
shown in Fig. 12 (a) (details in the next sub-section). Angle 
velocity and acceleration data of STEVAL-WESU1 are sent 
to and processed by an Android smartphone. The sampling 
rate was 40ms. We adopt a three-point moving average to 
remove noise.

Figure 13. STEVAL-WESU1 by STMicroelectronics 
We requested three unimpaired students to walk with 
their normal gait. Since their data change was basically the 
same, graphs of one participant are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. 
Both plotted lines in Fig. 14 are similar in shape to those in 
Fig. 10. Timing A and B correspond to timing A and B in Fig. 
10. Timing B in Fig. 14, which is the angle at the terminal 
swing, is shown more clearly than that in Fig. 10. On the other 
hand, timing C in Fig. 15 shows the kicking power from 
phase 4 (terminal stance) to 5 (pre-swing) is the same as 
timing A in Figs. 10 and 14. However, the angle at timing D 
in Fig. 15 is between not the foot and floor but a single limb 
and the vertical line to the floor. The plotted angle in Fig. 15 
clearly shows a change of angle for the single limb. 
As the result of this experiment, we decided that the heel 
was the best position to place a WD.

B. Monitoring application for smartphone 
As described in former sub-section, we determined the 
heel of a shoe is the best place to measure angle velocity of 
the foot and angle between the back part of a foot and the 
floor. 
We 
inserted 
a 
WD 
(STEVAL-WESU1 
by 
STMicroelectronics) into soles of both shoes. And, we also 
developed a gait monitoring application for Android

smartphone which measures and stores the angle velocity and 
angle as shown in Fig. 12. The upper part shows ID of WD 
for the right and left shoe, and the lower part shows angle 
velocities at A in each step for right foot, angle at B in each 
step for right foot, angle velocities at A in each step for left 
foot, and angle at B in each step for left foot. In this 
application, direction of angle is turned. When these graphs 
were measured, a participant played a stroke patient who had 
a one-side paralysis for the right side of the body. Therefore, 
most strength of angle velocity at A for right foot were 
smaller than that for left foot. And, most amplitude of angle 
at B for right foot were smaller than that for left foot.

C. Measured data using gait monitoring shoes 
We experimentally monitored the walking gait for two 
participants. They were unimpaired people. They walked and 
played the three types of trips in Fig. 2. Example measured 
data are shown in Fig. 13. Therefore, curves of angles in these 
graphs have different discontinuity to those in other graphs at 
the sole of a shoe touching a floor.

Figure 13. Example measured data for tripping with gait monitoring shoes 
 
In (1); toe touching the floor first instead of a heel, and 
(2); shuffling, shapes of angle velocity resemble that of the 
normal walk shown in Fig. 10. However, maximum values of 
angle velocity and minimum angle in a cycle in Fig. 13 (1) 
and (2) are much smaller than those in Fig. 10. Their absolute 
minimum values are also much smaller than those in Fig. 10. 
This feature must show that when muscle strength is weaker, 
more trips occur. The red circle in Fig. 13 (3) shows this 
situation clearly. In the case of a normal walk, angle velocity 
rapidly decreases from the pre-swing to the initial swing. 
However, in (3), the angle velocity limply decreases on the 
way. 
 
VI. 
GAIT PRESENTATION FORMAT FOR KINECT 
The above gait monitoring device is useful to measure 
degrees of muscle power and the angle between the foot and 
floor. However, they have difficulty measuring the position 
of joints of the lower body such as the foot and ankle. Hence, 
we measured them using KINECT. Since we noticed that 
three kinds of view image (front, side, and top views) were 
useful to find out the strain condition of the upper body [18], 
we adopted these three view graphs for the gait cycle. Before 
measuring joints of the lower body for walking disabilities,

KINECT’s measurement accuracy. The walking course was 
the line shown in Fig. 6. A participant walked in three ways:  
(1) Natural gait: a participant puts one foot on either side of 
the center-line (Fig.14). 
(2) On-line gait: a participant puts his/her foot on the center 
line (Fig.15). 
(3) Circumduction gait: a participant moves his right foot 
naturally and exaggeratedly rotates his/her left-foot away 
from the center-line (Fig.16). Some hemiplegia patients 
move their palsied foot with this walking form. 
 
In Figs. 14 to 16, the original position is the center of 
KINECT for each direction. Since KINECT is set 75 cm 
above the floor, height of the floor is -75 cm. Data for hips, 
ankles, knees, and the front part of feet are presented in these 
figures. 
The front-view shows moving height ranges for each joint. 
However, it is impossible to detect the position of each joint 
of the basis of walking steps. On the other hand, the side and 
top views respectively show the change of each joint in the 
vertical and horizontal directions in accordance with walking. 
The change of the moving height range of hips is very clearly 
shown in all side view graphs. However, measured data for 
the heights of knees, ankles, and feet by KINECT did not 
change smoothly. Since lengths from KINECT for both feet 
were very accurately measured as shown in Fig. 7, we 
decided not to adopt the moving average processing. Hence, 
we will consider whether some processing should be adopted 
to smooth them. 
A top view curve in each graph shows the change of 
length from the center line. From Figs. 14 and 15, measured 
data were shifted to the right when KINECT was used. 
However, left and right feet were put on the center line one 
after the other in the case of on-line walking (Fig. 15 (c)). 
This means that the measured length from the center line is 
basically accurate. 
When a participant exaggeratedly rotated his/her left-foot 
away from the center-line in the circumduction gait, curves 
of his/her left knee, ankle, and foot in the top view clearly 
showed their motions as shown in Fig. 16 (c). Moreover, their 
curves in the side view showed that their motions in the 
vertical direction were bigger than those of the right foot. 
KINECT detected exaggerated motion with high accuracy. 
One physiotherapist said that curves in the side and top 
views would be useful to instruct hemiplegia patients to walk 
more generally. 
 
VII. MEASURING AND ANALYSING A WALKING GAIT FOR 
WALKING DISABILITIES 
We measured angle velocity at the terminal stance to 
initial swing, angle between a foot and floor at the terminal 
swing, and average FS using a proposed gait monitoring 
device and KINECT. Positions of joints on the lower body 
measured by KINECT were presented with the side and top

view formats. Since a gait monitoring device did not work 
well at the first measuring date, we measured four patients 
using KINECT only at that day (17/08/2017). We measured 
different four patients using a gait monitoring device at 
different date (23/08/2017).  
A. Measured by a walking gait device 
Measured data for four walking disabilities by a walking 
gait device are showed in Fig. 17. Profiles of patients are 
listed in Table VII. Since Patient A has paralysis in right-side, 
his right foot angle velocities at the pre-swing are lower than 
those of his left foot. His right foot angles at the initial contact 
are approximately equal to an average foot angle of walking 
disabilities listed in Table VI. However, those of his left foot

are changed so hard. Patient B has paralysis in his left-side. 
However, his physical strength is weak, and there is not 
clearly difference between his right and left foot. Patient C 
and D do not have any paralysis. Their physical strengths are 
a little weak, and their toe angles at the initial contact are 
basically low. 
B. Measured by KINECT 
Measured data for four walking disabilities by KINECT 
are showed with the side and top-view as shown in Fig. 18.

Table VIII. Patient profiles and foot stride (FS) measured by KINECT 
 
 
The average FS for every patient are less than that of 
walking disability listed in Table V. These data correspond to 
what physiotherapists said they have a gait disturbance.  
The top view curves in Fig. 18 (1) shows that Patient E 
walks in the circumduction gait for his left-side and has 
paralysis in his left-side. An average FS of Patient F is very 
shorter than others. The curve of FS is usually changed 
symmetry to cross points of both feet. However, his curve is 
not asymmetry as shown in Fig. 19. The reason is that he uses 
a cane with his left hand, he sends a cane first, and then his 
right foot near by the position of cane, and finally his left foot 
a little beyond his right foot in a gait cycle. Since he leans on 
a cane with his left hand, his right- hip is shifted to the left. 
Side-view curves of Patient G’s hip and knee in Fig.18 (3) 
show that her both hips and knees do not almost move up-
and-downward. 
The 
chief 
physiotherapist 
in 
this 
rehabilitation facility says that she must have mastered this 
walking gait to avoid ache in her both shoulders. There are 
not any features for Patient H in Fig. 18(4).

VIII. CONCLUSION 
We comparably analyzed walking gait cycle between 
healthy people and walking disabilities using a wearable 
device (WD) and KINECT to detect warning signs of falls. 
On the basis of the results of experiments, we decided to 
adopt the angle velocity at the terminal stance to initial swing, 
angle between a foot and floor at the terminal swing, and 
average FS to detect warning signs of falls. We also 
developed a gait monitoring device comprised of a 
smartphone application and a pair of shoes on which WDs 
were mounted, and proposed using the side and top view 
formats to present data measured by KINECT. Proposed 
warning signs calculated for walking disabilities using 
developed device and KINECT showed clearly difference 
from healthy people. The proposed presentation format also 
made clear difference between them. We plan to develop a 
system that measures effect of rehabilitation quantitatively, 
and a warning system for fall prevention using proposed gait 
monitoring device and presentation formats.
