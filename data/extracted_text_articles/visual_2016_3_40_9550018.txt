INTRODUCTION 
With the development of image processing technology 
and 
laser 
scanning 
technology, 
3D 
reconstruction 
technology has become an important research content for a 
wide range of applications in the field of reverse 
engineering, pattern recognition, film and television, and 
obtained the rapid development. The complex model is 
constructed quickly and accurately through the 3D point 
data. The existing reconstruction algorithms are mainly 
divided into two main categories: volume reconstruction 
and surface reconstruction [1]. Volume reconstruction 
needs a long execution time to be processed. Surface 
reconstruction processing speed is relatively fast, and it is 
good for real-time processing. Surface reconstruction 
mainly includes three phases: contour line connection, 
contour 
extraction 
and 
triangulation. 
Contour 
line 
connection means connecting the adjacent cross section 
contour points. Contour extraction is a virtual cube formed 
by the eight neighbouring points, which represent the 
contour surface of a polygon. Triangulation is a 
construction of tetrahedral mesh. The higher the processing 
speed of surface reconstruction, the lower accuracy it has, 
because of the lack of some contour points. For this reason, 
we propose a 3D data reconstruction algorithm based on 
improving Voronoi diagram in which the 3D point data is 
filtered and de-noise.  
The details of our research are as follows. In Section II, 
we introduce the critical technologies related with our 
research, 
including 
3D 
visualization 
class 
library 
Visualization 
Toolkit 
(VTK), 
Voronoi 
diagram 
reconstruction 
method 
and 
semi-automated 
mesh 
simplification method. In Section III, our new method 
realization is presented, including realization of new 
construction method and Semi-automatic simplification 
method. There are two tests in Section IV, the first test is 
used to prove that our surface reconstruction method is 
feasible and efficient, the second test is to confirm that our 
method of semi-automatic mesh simplification has good 
interface and is accurate. In Section V, we present a 
conclusion about our research.  
II. 
CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES 
In this section, we introduce critical technologies related 
with our research, including 3D visualization class library 
VTK, reconstruction method and semi-automated mesh 
simplification method. 
A. 3D visualization class library VTK 
In 3D visualization class library VTK, there are three 
key parts: Voronoi tessellation code, Vanderpool (VT) and 
VTK. Voronoi tessellation code defines a cellular-like 
structure, where each particle is associated to a region in 
which any point in that region is nearer to that particle than 
to any other particle. The parallel Voronoi tessellation code 
is an open source code, and it has the following 
characteristics: (1) parallel and optimization, has full 
advantage of actual multicore and distributed memory, (2) 
user-friendly in documentation and interface, (3) has typical 
I/O formats used in the field of NN-body simulations. In 
addition, this code also has the properties such as Voronoi 
densities, cell volumes, density gradients, and immediate 
neighbour lists. In the field of astrophysics, particularly for 
NN-body simulations, Voronoi tessellation code is a very 
useful tool to identify immediate neighbours of particles,

and it is one of the best adaptive methods to recover a 
precise density field from a discrete distribution of points, 
with 
a 
clear 
advantage 
over 
smoothed 
particle 
hydrodynamic or other interpolation-based techniques. Its 
principal asset is complete independence of arbitrary 
smoothing functions and parameters specifying their 
properties.  
Vanderpool (VT) in 3D visualization reproduces the 
anisotropies of the local particle distribution and through its 
adaptive and local nature proves to be optimally suited for 
uncovering the full structural richness in the density 
distribution. Other remarkable uses of VT in this field are 
filamentary structure identification, NN-body simulation 
code 
AREPO, 
halo 
and 
void 
identification, 
and 
nonparametric determination of halo concentrations. 
In 3D visualization class library, VTK is a set of 3D 
graphics, image processing and visualization tools which is 
integrated with the C++ library developed by the United 
States Kitware company. It is a source development, 
visualization technology and image processing software 
system; it can be used in C++, TCL/TK, Java and Python 
language environments [2]. It combines computer graphics, 
image processing and visualization technology, and it has 
an absolute advantage in the field of visualization and 
image processing. It has become often used in the research 
of image visualization system. VTK system mainly has two 
kinds: the graphic model object and visualization object 
model. The main function of graphical model is 
representing the scene which is formed from geometry by 
graph. VTK has 3D interactive components where users can 
choose the functions of parallel processing, running 
algorithm and visualization process. Visualization process 
includes functions of read data, filtering, mapping and 
rendering. 
B.  The method of Voronoi diagram reconstruction 
The accuracy and efficiency are two key factors of 3D 
surface reconstruction by data. The accuracy is required to 
maintain the topology and shape. The efficiency is required 
to reduce the reconstruction time in the premise of 
maintaining the original topology under. Distance algorithm 
deals with noisy scattered data and it also reconstructs the 
surface of triangular mesh concerning for sample density 
and surface details based on a greedy filter. 
The original Voronoi diagram [3] has a great effect on 
the distance between the point and other geometric objects. 
Assuming that in a given plane or space, there are n 
scattered points, point set

Delaunay triangulation is dual related to Voronoi 
diagram, which has the characteristics of the maximum of 
the minimum angle, the cavity and the local reconnection 
[4]. Power map is an extension of Voronoi; its generating 
element can be regarded as the Voronoi figure of the Power 
circle, and the distance is not Euclidean distance but Power 
distance:

If we hope to obtain better approximation of the surface 
vector of sampling point, we need to improve the surface 
reconstruction algorithm. The details of our improved 
method are described in Section III A.  
C. Semi-automated mesh simplification method 
For regular models, such as airplane, tank, etc., model 
conforms to a certain rule, automatic error correction can be 
easily achieved by feature preserving simplification [5]. 
However, for the cows, dinosaurs and other irregular model, 
or users who have special expectations to simplify models, 
we need select error correction mode and the expected 
characteristics of the region are preserved. 
The basic error measure is quadric error metrics, which 
focuses on the feature of size in shape variable before and 
after the simplification. In many cases, the curvature of the 
model is more important than the feature ones. For surfaces 
that are in the same plane, only a few polygons can be 
expressed, however highly curved surfaces require more 
polygons to represent [6]. For this reason, we study the 
curvature error and the two-error weight as the result of 
automatic error correction, and do research on the triangle 
optimization factor to the quality of triangle.  
The three vertices of the triangle V3, V2 and V1 are 
used to calculate the product of vectors, which are the 
normal vectors of triangle:

If a triangle is closer to the equilateral triangle, it is 
regular [7]. Triangle optimization is to avoid appearing long 
and narrow triangles in the simplified process [8]-[12]. It 
tries to make the generated triangle approaches in an 
equilateral triangle.

In order to improve the result of the simplification, 
users can mark in 3D model to refine and retain in the 
simplified platform directly, and simplify to achieve new 
simplified results. The user impact factor of the marked 
area is embodied in the way of weight. In our new error 
method, we set weight value of W both by system 
initialization and by calculation of each point. The 
initialization value of W is 1. If the user did not make any 
other decision, the way of automatic error correction will be 
followed. If the user tag, the tag area will be given a new 
weight, and the value of W > 1, the twice error will be 
modified by following formula:

The error is multiplied twice by a weight. To calculate 
the initial value of weight, we provide two methods to set 
the initial weights in the system; the details are presented in 
Section III B. 
III. 
REALIZATION OF OUR NEW METHODS 
There are two improved methods in this section; one 
improved method is to improve Power Crust Algorithm, 
other 
improved 
method 
is 
semi-automatic 
mesh 
simplification method.  
A. The concrete realization of Power Crust  
Power Crust algorithm has the advantages of a simple 
process to accurately reconstruct the results, for a large 
number of scattered point cloud data without a normal 
vector [13]-[14].  The processing speed is very fast, but the 
disadvantage of this method is that it is not accurate [15]. 
Power Crust algorithm can generate a watertight and sealed 
3D mesh; in addition, it can construct the estimators from 
the central axis of the original surface which contains noise, 
sharp and unclosed points cloud data. The steps of Power 
Crust algorithm are: 
 
Calculate centre axis of the sample, find out 
v vertices to create graph on Voronoi 
triangulation , 
 
Connect through triangulation points of the 
original point cloud into triangular mesh 
model,  
 
Delete the grid which does not comply with 
requirements.  
 
 Construction of the grid mesh 
The advantage of Power Crust algorithm is that it can 
construct the region with dense points. Its disadvantage is 
that the output of discrete surface has sparse points. We 
modify Power Crust algorithm based on Voronoi diagram:  
1) Set Delaunay triangulation by sampling point S; and 
find the Voronoi vertex which the boundary box of vertex is 
considered to be the sampling point in Power diagram. 
2) Determine which Voronoi vertices are poles. 
3) The generation of the pole penalty set Bp, calculated 
the Power chart. 
4) Mark each pole inside or outside. 
5) Set the triangle as the output, and return the results. 
We would prove that our modified algorithm has better 
result by experiments in Section IV. 
B.  Modified Semi- automatic mesh simplification method 
There are two methods to set weight value in mesh 
simplification method; in the first method, users input a 
weight value, the second method consists on setting an 
initial weight value by the system, because it may be 
difficult for some users and cases to actually set suitable 
weights.  For different grid model, weights will have great 
differences. 
The two methods of set weight value are: 1) User 
input weight value to system. This method can meet user 
different 
requirements. 
The 
weight 
values 
include 
maximum and minimum values. 2) Initial label the mean

value of the error in the actual simplification process for 
different mesh models. If the pre-set weight range is large, 
it is likely that role to the quadric error led to final folding.  
We modify semi-automatic mesh simplification 
method by calculating the weight value two times so that 
the error would not make model losing retention effect. 
Model when it is in the medium errors are in reasonable 
way because that model retention effect is better than at 
other errors .The twice error and the weight of the transfer 
process are done separately. The definition of weight 
transfer is as follows: 
1) The process of Edge collapse: Point 
1v  and 
2v  fold 
to 
'v .The weight value of
1v is
1
w , weight value of 
2v is
2
w . 
Weight value of
'v is average value of  
1
w  and 
2
w . 
2) The process of Split point process: The parent node 
V is split into two nodes, if v weight is w, then two sub-
node weights are w. 
The semi-automatic mesh simplification code is 
described as follows: 
1) E(u,v):=v.quadric/v.opt+F(u,v); 
2) W(u,v):=(u.weight+v.weight)/2; 
3) Cost(u,v):=W(u)*E(u)+W(v)*E(v); 
4) Mesh.list.sort(mesh.v,cost(u,v)); 
5) Mesh.list.popfront(); 
6) Mesh.update(); 
7) If is Ok (mesh) then 
8) return mesh; 
9) else goto step5; 
10) end if 
    The algorithm needs to deal with a large amount of data, 
so the definition of a suitable data structure ensures 
simplification and the capability of handling large data 
models quickly. The modified semi-automatic mesh 
simplification is as follows: 
1) Set sequence of vertices, which record each vertex 
and adjacency edge, adjacent triangles, error values and 
weights. 
2) Record vertex triangle index sequence. 
3) Identify the sequence of vertices and triangles 
sequence model data structure. 
4) Store the folded edge in the record list. 
    The modified algorithm will be tested and analysed by 
experiments in section IV. 
IV. 
EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS 
There are two tests in this section; one test is a 
reconstruction test aiming at proving our improved 
algorithm of reconstruction described in section III A; the 
second test is to verify our improved algorithm of semi-
automatic mesh simplification method being described in 
section III B.  The data used in experiment came from the 
3D scanned images stored in the Txt text [16] in the form of 
3D coordinates. 
A.  Reconstruction test and analysis  
The 
program 
of 
surface 
reconstruction 
and 
visualization in 3D point cloud are designed based on 
Visual C++ Microsoft platform. We choose two sets of 
three dimensional point cloud data, such as data of whale 
and ocean to do the tests. They are shown in Figure 1 and 
Figure 2. 
 
Figure 1.  The reconstruction of whale 
 
Figure 2.  The reconstruction of ocean 
We achieve two reconstruction effects both by using 
Crust Power algorithm through the 3D point cloud data and 
by using our algorithm through the 3D point cloud data to 
carry out a comparative analysis. Table 1 summarizes the 
results of the reconstruction of the two algorithms.

Through the above tests, we can find that the time 
efficiency of power crust algorithm is lower than our 
method. Our reconstruction method based on Voronoi 
diagram can achieve the stereo effect of 3D point cloud 
well and can retain some details of the original object. 
Therefore, our reconstruction method based on Voronoi 
diagram is an effective method in surface reconstruction. 
B.  Experiment and analysis of semi-automatic mesh 
simplification method 
Our semi-automatic mesh simplification method was 
implemented by the standard C++ language. There are 
several parts in this program, such as error correction, edit 
mode, different simplified models and default settings.  
User error correction for weight allows the users to do 
marking operation. In edit mode, the user can alter attention 
region (the region should be distinguished by different 
colors) which facilitate the user operation through CTRL + 
mouse to select smear colour; SHIFT + mouse to delete the 
selected colour. For different simplified models, the range

of calculation errors and the ranking results are different. 
The weight of the error is proposed to properly affect the 
calculation of the results of the calculation error, and 
therefore, the appropriate value of the initial weight is the 
key influence on error calculation. According to the 
different weights of the experimental model, the optimal 
setting is to obtain the minimum and maximum error, and 
then take the average value between the two values as the 
initial value for the corresponding model. The default 
settings for the user's marking area are the initial value and 
the value of the tag. Specific weights are set shown in Table 
II.

The results of our method to achieve the 3D model of 
simplification are shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5. 
According to the initial weight of the set rules, the weights 
are the average between the initial weight and the maximum 
error.

We use the function of user error correction to get the 
best simplification result. Labelled and unlabelled mesh 
simplification results are shown in Table III.

THE NUMBER OF MESH MODEL SIMPLIFICATION RESULTS. 
From the experiment results, we conclude that our 
semi- automatic mesh simplification algorithm can obtain 
the simplified model conforms to the simplified criteria. It 
can also fully retain the local area which users concern 
about maintaining the appearance. It can be seen that our 
modified algorithm is important in generating a simplified 
model and it is consistent with user's requirements. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we firstly analyse the existing surface 
reconstruction of Voronoi and Delaunay triangulation 
Power Crust algorithms and study the implementation 
toolkit of VTK. Secondly, we modified Power Crust 
algorithm based on Voronoi diagram to reconstruct the 
surface by using the cloud data into VTK which has a 
strong image processing capabilities. Our modified method 
can effectively improve the efficiency of reconstruction and 
has a good visualization performance. Thirdly, based on the 
two error metric algorithm, we proposed a new method of 
semi-automatic 
mesh 
simplification. 
Our 
algorithm 
provides automatic error correction and user error 
correction which has twice error correction functions 
according to different models with different types of error 
correction. By comparing with different models obtained by 
different 
experiments, 
our 
semi-automatic 
mesh 
simplification method has the characteristics of good 
retention effect and can simplify the complex structure of 
the model.
