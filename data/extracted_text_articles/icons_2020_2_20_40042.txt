Abstract— Greenhouses are especially important in hot 
climates. In fact, there are some plants that cannot survive in 
hot climates; for instance, strawberries, peaches, and 
pomegranates. In general, Greenhouses are a closed and 
transparent structure that can be used in home gardens and 
farms, creating a suitable environment for plants to grow in 
a relatively cold environment. Furthermore, greenhouses 
offer some other factors of extreme importance for plants to 
grow rapidly; to name but a few, cold temperature, suitable 
humidity, soil moisture, and a cover from harmful winds. A 
greenhouse is designed in such a way to increase the 
production of crops and harvest seasons. Moreover, 
greenhouses are mobile, which makes them easy to transfer 
from one place to another if need arises. Besides, a 
greenhouse is not limited to a specific size, but can be 
adjusted based on the available surface area and number of 
crops. Unlike traditional greenhouses, the automated 
greenhouse proposed in this paper will have an automatic 
irrigation system and a weather controller.

I. INTRODUCTION  
The consumption of fruits and vegetables has become 
of vital importance in most societies. A large number of 
different kinds of fresh fruits and vegetables are available 
anytime of the year. However, in a dry climate such as 
Oman’s, growing fruits and vegetables is a big challenge 
because of different factors such as the low humidity and 
the lack of rain. A suitable greenhouse that takes into 
account the challenges aforementioned is needed to grow 
fruits or vegetables. A greenhouse is defined as a simply 
designed house whose ceiling can be made of different 
materials like, plastic or glass. The selected material 
depends on the climate condition requirement.  
Structure and design of greenhouses affects the crop 
production. Many developments have appeared related to 
greenhouse design recently. Those early structured was 
made to control parameters like temperature and humidity. 
Nonetheless, these latter did not meet the needed 
requirements of quality control criteria. Nowadays, the 
surrounding environment faces many issues and challenges 
regarding the climate condition. Global warming and 
weather changes are considered to be the main causes of 
these latter. Farmers, and the agriculture industry in 
general, are facing many obstructions regarding the 
aforementioned 
issues. 
Therefore, 
the 
automated 
greenhouse is the best solution to overcome these issues in 
the agriculture sector.  There are several advantages that 
come with building a structure like that. To mention but a 
few, its suitability to grow any type of plants, its ability to 
provide the ideal weather condition and conserve the 
water, and its ability to decrease the need for technicians 
since the greenhouse is fully automated. The remaining of 
this paper is structured as follow. Section II discusses the 
literature review. Section III, presents the implementation 
objectives. Section IV, describes the design and the 
implementation. Section V, present the results. Finally, the 
conclusion and the future work of the paper are presented. 
II. LITRATURE REVIEW 
   This section will introduce the relevant literature and 
research projects that have been done before. The concept 
of the greenhouse is to provide a suitable environment for 
many different plants. The greenhouse is a method to 
provide plants such fruits and vegetables all year round 
with the different weather conditions by control and 
monitor different parameters such as, humidity and 
 temperature [6]. 
    Waaijenberg [5] conducted a research about the 
greenhouse design, construction, and the covered 
materials. Generally, there are many material properties to 
evaluate the covered material of a greenhouse. For 
example, the fire behavior, the mechanical strength, the 
investment costs, the permeability for humidity, and the 
available dimensions. Another parameter which will be 
affected by a covering material is the light transition. 
Light transition relies on the covered material of the 
 greenhouse.    
   The concept of growing different types of plants in a 
monitored and controlled environment came from "Rome 
under the reign of Emperor Tiberius"[13]. It was found 
that similar papers only focus on the temperature, the 
humidity, and the irrigation system. For a plant to grow 
with a good quality, it needs enough space to develop its 
roots, an appropriate amount of water, adequate lighting, 
oxygen, a suitable temperature, and mineral. Kumar et al 
[8] suggested the usage of microcontrollers for controlling 
greenhouses. The aim of this project was to enhance 
plants’ growth by providing a suitable environment and a 
controlled irrigation system to offer a sufficient amount of 
water. The sensors utilized in this project are: a soil 
moisture sensor, a temperature sensor, and a humidity 
sensor. Each and every recorded value is presented on a 
Liquid Cristal Display (LCD) that enables the farmers to

parameters 
 environment of the greenhouse. 
   On the other hand, Shaker et al. [1] built a greenhouse 
project to control the climate and the irrigation system 
inside the greenhouse by using Wireless Sensor Network 
(WSN). The structure of this project aimed at providing 
environment where the climate can be fully controlled in 
order to protect the plants from any external weather 
condition.  
III. IMPLEMENTATION  OBJECTIVES 
   The main purpose of this automated greenhouse is to 
design and implement a greenhouse for plants that can be 
automatically controlled and monitored by using a 
microcontroller.  
The detailed objectives of this project are as follow: 
• 
Optimizing the usage of Energy by controlling the 
energy consumption. 
• 
Minimizing the usage of water by controlling the 
irrigation system, and providing the needed 
amount of water. 
• 
Designing and constructing the structure of the 
greenhouse by selecting efficient and appropriate 
materials.  
• 
Designing and implementing an Automated 
Irrigation System. 
• 
 Maintaining the climate factors inside the 
greenhouse’s environment.  
   The greenhouse will be fully automated system so there 
is no need for human interventions. In addition, it will be 
open source which, make it unique and different from the 
others projects.  
IV.  DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION 
To achieve the project objectives, using Arduino as a 
microcontroller seems to be the best choice since it 
supports open hardware and software systems. In addition, 
it has a very low cost and it is available on the local 
market. The choice of materials was as follows. A Field 
Control System: this step depends on the working of 
different sensors used in this project which are the soil 
moisture, the temperature and the humidity, the lighting, 
the water flow, the gas, a SIM card and electric current. 
The testing and programming for every sensor was done 
separately. The first sensor used is the temperature and 
humidity sensor and then we added the other different 
sensors which are the soil moisture, PH level, light, SIM 
card, MQ-7, flow meter, and current. However, different 
actuators such, pump, light, and fan are installed to.  The 
second step is the project preparation. For the purpose of 
building the structure of this project, plastic and aluminum 
were used. 
A. Design Process 
   Selecting of structural material of the greenhouse 
depends 
on 
the 
cost 
and 
availability, 
technical 
characteristics, and local climate. Furthermore, the 
selection of these materials is based on the requirements of 
design strength, physical properties, life expectancy, and 
cost of construction materials 
a)Frame: 
   The frames for the greenhouse are essential because 
without good solid frames, any greenhouse would not 
stand properly. There are a variety of materials that may be 
used for the frames of the greenhouse. Each material has 
advantages and disadvantages. Selecting the suitable 
choice of frames will have a good impact on the 
greenhouse structure.  
   Aluminum is the selected material for the greenhouse 
frame. It is considered as a low maintenance material, and 
can be used for a long time. This material cannot break or 
rust easily. It supports the members which are made from 
the heaviest pieces. Moreover, it supplies good rigid for 
the plastics, and it can be painted in any color. It has 
several advantages such as its lightness and robustness. 
Also, it is suitable in any environmental condition and will 
not face any corrosion, unlike iron. 
b)Covered material: 
   Covering material of the greenhouse is also an essential 
part that affects the productivity of the crops and the 
structure performance of the greenhouse. It also affects the 
amount of light needed for growing plants. Several 
characteristics should be considered in choosing the most 
suitable covering material such as, weight, amount of 
transmitted light, cost, amount of transmitted energy, and 
the ease of maintenance. 
   Polycarbonate plastic is the selected material for 
covering the greenhouse. It has better insulation and a 
natural light filter which conserves the plants from harmful 
radiations. This plastic consists of UV radiations, which is 
used in outdoor areas. UV radiations help the plastic to 
prevent the deterioration and yellowing from sun radiation. 
It is available anywhere there is strong wind and other 
mechanical stress. It is a fully transparent material. The 
transparent corrugated plastic provides strength and  a 
protection from high temperature. Also, it consists of clear 
bubble insulation which provides a protection from cold 
weather.   
The greenhouse profile is generally of lean type design, 
with 60 cm width, 80cm length and 80 height. The last 
step was to assemble all parts together to finalize the 
project construction besides the last step in the coding 
process was to gather all codes in one single program and 
run it in a large-scale project to make sure that everything 
is working perfectly. 
B. System block diagram 
 
Figure 1 shows the system block diagram. The 
greenhouse environment in this project is controlled and 
monitored by the microcontroller Arduino Mega. This 
latter controls and monitors the plants within this 
greenhouse, which is lettuce in this case, by utilizing the 
sensors, mainly the humidity, temperature, and current 
sensors. The fan and water pumps are the actuators used 
in this project. In addition, the Arduino software or 
"Arduino Integrated Development Environment" was used 
to develop the different codes that are used in this project 
the language of this software based on C++ language. The 
first sensor utilized is the humidity and temperature 
sensor. This sensor is responsible for sending the value of 
the temperature and the humidity inside the greenhouse. If 
27

a temperature higher than 26 degrees Celsius is recorded, 
fan will be activating it to regulate it. On the other hand, if 
a temperature lower than 26 C is recorded, the fan will be 
deactivated and the lamp will be turned on to work as 
“sun” in order to regulate the temperature. The same goes 
for the humidity, the humidity will be sensed during the 
system operation. If the humidity level exceeds 34%, the 
fan will be turned on, and if it goes below 31%, the lamp 
will be activated. The second sensor is the soil moisture 
sensor this sensor detects the soil moisture percentage. If 
the detected moisture percentage is less than 35%, it is 
concluded that the soil is very dry and the water pump 
machine will be turned on to irrigate the plants inside the 
greenhouse. However, if the sensor detects a soil moisture 
percentage higher than 35 %, it is concluded that the soil 
is wet, and there is no need for irrigation. Regarding the 
light sensor (LDR), it will work if it senses that the value 
of the LDR is lower than threshold. Then, the light will 
turn on, and vice versa. following to that, the PH sensor 
will work if the PH inside the main tank become less than 
8, then the second water pump will operated to stabilize 
the PH value. In addition, the carbon monoxide sensor 
will detect the amount of CO inside the greenhouse. If the 
CO concentration is more than 120 ppm, the SIM sensor 
will be activated and a message will be sent to the 
greenhouse’ owners. Finally, the water flow detector is 
installed to sense the water flow rate record the water 
consumption in liters.  
 
 
Figure 1. System block diagram   
C. Automated greenhouse flowchart 
  The flowchart in Figure 2 presents the different sensors 
and how each of them works. The flowchart represents the 
used sensors and how they operate. The environment of 
the lettuce crop is monitored by the  Arduino Mega 
microcontroller that controls the needed sensors for the 
plant and offers the suitable environment. These sensors 
are PH, soil moisture, light, temperature, and humidity. 
Moreover, there are some actuators which are installed in 
the greenhouse in order to maintain the suitable 
environment. These actuators are fan, lamps and pumps. 
Firstly, the humidity and temperature sensors are used to 
measure the temperature and humidity value. If the 
temperature is more than 26 degree, then the fan will work 
to reduce it and if it is less than 26 then the lamps will 
work to heat the greenhouse. The second sensor provides 
the suitable value of the PH value. If the PH value is more 
than 8 in the main tank, then the pump will work to 
provide more water from the other tank until it reaches 8. 
Thirdly, the light sensor detects the brightness inside the 
greenhouse. If the LDR value is less than threshold then 
the lamps will work. Furthermore, Furthermore, soil 
moisture sensor detects the amount of water in the soil.  If 
the soil moisture is less than 35%, then the pump will work 
to provide the needed water for lettuce. Then, if the carbon 
monoxide sensor records that the value of CO more than 
120ppm, a message will be sent to the owner of the 
greenhouse. Finally, both values of the current sensors will 
be represented on the LCD during the fan and the pump 
operation.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
   Selecting the materials: 
1. Aluminium: it is very light in weight which is needed 
to build the greenhouse structure to handle it

everywhere, and to protect it from the climate 
conditions such as strong wind. 
2. Polycarbonate plastic: it is easy to fit and handle. 
Replacing polycarbonate plastic sheets from the 
greenhouse is much easier, but to be more careful 
when installing any material in polycarbonate plastic 
because it gets damaged quickly.  
3. Light bulb: incandescent lights are reliable and have a 
full brightness as soon as the key switches on. The 
quantity of lose heat is very high which increases the 
temperature inside the greenhouse and affects the 
growth of the plants. 
4. Fan: it is one of the high performance cooling 
products. 
 
Figure 3. LDR Sensor 
 
   The line graph in Figure 3 illustrates the values of the 
LDR sensor that detect the brightness inside the 
greenhouse from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. It can be clearly 
seen that the LDR values are fluctuating during that 
period. Moving on to the details, the highest values were 
recorded at 9, 11 and 1:00PM, while the lowest values 
were recorded at 3:00 and 4:00PM.These changes 
happened because the LDR sensor detects the brightness 
from the lights which are installed inside the location of 
greenhouse. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Fan's current 
   The line graph from Figure 4 presents the values of 
current sensor that monitors the fan consumption with the 
time from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The overall trend shows a 
fluctuation in the fan’s current values. Back to the details, 
the highest value was recorded at 1:00 PM, whereas the 
lowest value was recorded at 4:00 PM. These fluctuations 
happened because the fan was switched on and off during 
the period due to a temperature change. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Fan's Current & Temperature 
   Figure 5 presents the comparison between the fan’s 
current and temperature from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The 
y-axis presents the temperature values while the x-axis 
shows the fan’s current in Ampere. It can be clearly 
observed that both lines are constant during the period.

 Figure 7. Pump's (ON) Current during Irrigation 
  
   The two-line graph in Figures 6 and 7 shows the current 
sensor for the pump with the time from 9:00AM to 5:00 
PM. In the first graph, it can be observed that the pump’s 
current values are almost zero because the pump was 
switched off. Whereas in the second graph, the value for 
the pump’s current was 2.5 Ampere because the pump 
was switched on. The pump was switched on because the

soil was dried. In the remaining time the values are almost 
zero because the soil had enough water. 
 
 
 
Figure 8. Pump's (OFF) Current  & Soil Moisture 
 
 
 
Figure 9. Pump's (ON) Current & Soil Moisture 
 
   The two graphs in Figures 8 and 9 show the comparison 
between the pump’s current and soil moisture. The x-axis 
represents the pump’s current while the y-axis represents 
the percentage of soil moisture. In the first graph, the 
values of soil moisture were decreased gradually but the 
pump’s current values were almost zero during the period. 
Whereas in the second graph, the value for the pump’s 
current was 2.5 ampere at the first period. The soil 
moisture value was recorded in that time was 0.59%. In 
this situation, the pump was switched on to irrigate the 
plants. In the remaining time, the pump’s current values 
are almost zero. 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Temperature Average 
   For the humidity and temperature sensor, it has been 
noticed that if the value of the temperature that appears in 
the LCD Screen becomes more than the fixed temperature 
number in the system, the sensor shows response to that 
and the Fan will be switched on to decrease the value of 
the temperature. The chart in Figure 10 shows the average 
temperature in Celsius for outside and inside the 
greenhouse. The results were recorded for 4 days 
(Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), each day 
from 9:00AM to 5:00PM. Looking to the graph, the 
temperature inside the greenhouse was recorded with a 
constant value 25 for whole the days. On the other hand, 
the outside temperature recorded an average value 
between 38 and 39 for the same period.  
 
 
 
Figure 11.  Average Humidity 
   Regarding the humidity controls, if the percentage of 
humidity is either less or more than the fixed point in the 
system which is 35%, the sensor will detect that and the 
fan will be operated in order to decrease the value of the 
humidity inside the greenhouse. The next chart in Figure 
11 shows the average percentage of the humidity for a 
period of four days beginning with 27/5/2019 until 
30/5/2019 for each day from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The 
humidity in the greenhouse environment was compared 
with the outside humidity. In general, it is clear from the 
graph that the humidity inside the greenhouse was 
constant during that time for all the mentioned days, 
which means that the control system works efficiently. On 
the other hand, the outside humidity was varying with a 
range of 19% to 23% during the same time of the change 
in the other condition outside.

    In this test, it has been noticed that when the percentage 
of the soil moisture becomes lower than the limited value 
(35%), it was detected by the sensor and a signal was sent 
to operate the pump to irrigate the plants in the controlled 
greenhouse. Nevertheless, if the soil moisture sensor 
sense that the value of the moisture exceeds 35%, a signal 
is sent to the system to stop the irrigation process as the 
plants have enough water. Moreover, Figure 12 shows the 
average percentage of the soil moisture for a period of 4 
days between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM daily. Looking into 
the graph, it can be recognized that the soil moisture 
average has declined on Tuesday due to the results that 
was recorded during the day has the lowest value between 
the four days. However, the percentage of the soil 
moisture 
increased 
gradually 
on 
Wednesday 
and 
Thursday. 
 
 
Figure 13. Water Flow Average 
   In Figure 13, the water flow sensor works to detect the 
water flow that enters the greenhouse. When the soil 
becomes dry, the sensor of soil moisture sends a signal to 
operate the pump. During that time, the water flow sensor 
will record the water flow. The chart above in Figure 13 
illustrates the average water flow amount during the 
aforementioned period. It is clear from the graph that the 
water flow rate recorded the lowest amount on 
Wednesday with a value of 0.557 L/Min.  Nonetheless, it 
has the lowest value on Thursday because the plants were 
not irrigated during the system operation. On the fourth 
day, the data of the water flow was 0 L/Min for the whole 
period because the soil has enough water and there is no 
 need to irrigate the plants. 
   Figure 14 compares the soil moisture to the water flow 
rate for the first day. What is noticeable is that there is a 
direct relationship between the water flow and the soil 
moisture. When the water pump works to irrigate the 
plants, the amount of water increased sharply to reach its 
peak. During that same time, the soil wetness percentage 
increased and the same was noticed during the whole 
days.

Figure 15. PH Average 
   The PH sensor works to sense the PH level into the 
main tank which is used for the irrigation system. When 
the value of the PH becomes more than threshold, the 
sensor detects that and the second pump is operated to 
push water into the main container to decrease the PH 
level. Figure 15 demonstrates the daily PH level. Overall, 
the PH level is at its highest on Monday because the water 
was not used before. In contrast, the lowest value was in 
Thursday with a value of 8.08. In general, the water that 
used in the tank considered basic.

   The MQ-7 sensor is used.  This sensor detects that the 
value of the gas (CO). If the said value is more than the 
threshold, a message will be sent to the owner in order to 
quickly check the greenhouse. The above chart in Figure 
16 demonstrates the average value of the gas (CO) in 
PPM for a period of 4 days, each day between 9:00 AM to 
5:00 PM. What is noticeable on Monday the CO 
concentration recorded as the highest value its reach 133 
ppm. On the other hand, the lowest value was recorded on 
Wednesday with a value of 70 ppm.      
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  
   The main purpose of this research project is to 
construct, design, and implement a fully automated 
greenhouse with an efficient design to provide a suitable 
environment for growing plants using an Arduino 
microcontroller. The greenhouse is constructed using 
Aluminum as a supported frame and polycarbonate plastic 
as a cover material. The choice these materials is based on 
the previous studies about constructing a greenhouse. The 
selected design is lean-to type greenhouse that is mobile 
and easily transferrable. We achieved successful results 
with this project. In fact, the sensors used showed very 
promising response with a success percentage reached to 
90% in detecting and sending signals to Arduino, to 
control the climate parameters and the irrigation system. 
By having this efficient system inside greenhouse, the 
lettuce 
productivity 
increased, 
water 
and 
energy 
consumption were optimized, and manpower decreased.  
 
   Regarding the future works, intelligence with data 
processing and prediction will be carried out to improve 
the result. In addition, a possible extension of this project 
would involve creating a knowledge management system, 
where several cases are going to be fed into the system for 
future predictions and recommendation purposes.
