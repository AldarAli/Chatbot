Abstract— Capturing the benefits generated from investments 
in digital health is key towards demonstrating accountability to 
funders as well as to encouraging widespread adoption by 
clinicians and other health care professionals. The cumulative 
benefits calculation, developed by Canada Health Infoway, is a 
macro-level indicator trended over a period of 10 years. It 
represents estimated benefits accruing to various health care 
system stakeholders, as driven by component technologies and 
their associated adoption across the country. In-depth studies, 
validated by external experts in relevant fields, have been 
completed for specific technologies, such as diagnostic imaging 
systems, ambulatory care Electronic Medical Records (EMR), 
and telehealth. The financially quantifiable aspects of each 
study are aggregated, trended over time, and indexed to 
inflation. From 2007 to 2015 benefits accrued to the Canadian 
health care system exceeded $16B.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Efforts to build an interoperable electronic health record 
(iEHR) have been underway across Canada for many years.  
While deployment progress and rates of user adoption vary 
across provinces and territories, the initiative has passed its 
tipping point and uptake is now increasing rapidly. The 
potential benefits of the iEHR are substantial – improved 
quality of care, system efficiencies, improved access to care 
and use of health data to better manage the health system and 
facilitate ground-breaking research. An iEHR is a secure, 
integrated view of a person’s medical records from all 
systems in the network; it provides a comprehensive view of 
a patient’s medical history [1].   Typically, it integrates data 
from diagnostic imaging systems, laboratory information 
systems (LIS), as well as drug information systems (DIS), to 
provide a longitudinal view of a patient’s clinical history.  As 
such, it is a similar concept to that of a Health Information 
Exchange (HIE) [2]. Across Canada, iEHRs are at various 
stages of implementation and maturity and have evolved 
according to provincial/territorial strategies and priorities.  A 
growing number of health care professionals in Canada can 
now access important information about their patients 
outside of their practice settings through iEHRs [3][4]. 
The iEHR acts as a complement to point of service 
systems like electronic medical records (EMR) in physician 
offices or clinical information systems (CIS) in hospitals.  
Regular measurement of adoption and maturity for these 
technologies has made progress easy to follow and manage.  
For example, in the 2015 Commonwealth Fund Survey, 73% 
of all family physicians reported they do use electronic 
records to enter and retrieve clinical notes [5].  
In the interest of accountability for the public funds under 
its management, and optimizing the value accruing from 
investment of those funds, Canada Health Infoway (Infoway) 
has developed approaches to evaluate and systematically 
model the estimated value of outcomes related to select 
digital health solutions nationally [6]. The cumulative 
benefits model contains estimates for benefits generated 
through the use of diagnostic imaging systems, DIS, 
ambulatory and primary care EMRs, and telehealth.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
describes the methods used for calculating cumulative 
benefits. Section III describes the most recent results based 
on data up to the end of 2015. Section IV addresses the 
assumptions and limitations of the model. The conclusion, 
Section V closes the article. 
II. 
METHODS 
The cumulative benefits calculation is driven by 
individual quantitative estimates obtained from pan-
Canadian studies commissioned by Infoway for each of the 
topics mentioned above. The concept of pan-Canadian 
studies to estimate national value was developed in 2006 to 
summarize results across diverse data domains, settings, 
evaluation methods and time periods. The studies aim to 
generate estimates, which are as comprehensive as possible, 
validated by experts, and reflecting available evidence. The 
cumulative benefits cover a subset of digital health solutions, 
and as such represent a portion of the value from digital 
health at large.  They also provide an assessment of gaps and 
recommendations for increasing and optimizing the use and 
spread of technologies in order to increase value over time 
[6].  Estimates are expressed in Canadian dollars realized on 
an annual basis and base assumptions to current contexts are 
applied and documented. Not all outcomes represent direct 
financial savings, but where possible, a value is expressed

financially to allow comparison of magnitudes. Where the 
literature does not provide sufficient evidence to quantify the 
current dollar value of a specific outcome, the value is 
omitted from quantitative modeling. In instances where a 
range of estimated benefits is provided, the mid-point value 
was used as a base estimate.  The mid-point estimate for each 
domain-specific benefit is highlighted in Table 1 and 
corresponds to the year in which the study was carried out. 
Simplicity is a core principle of the specification of the 
quantitative benefits model, with most discrete value 
estimates derived by multiplying the magnitude of outcome 
observed per unit x value of outcome x extent of adoption 
across 
Canada. 
Adoption 
maturity 
variation 
(e.g., 
functionalities used, frequency of use, etc.) is an important 
driver of value in digital health deployment, so the extent of 
the adoption used in the model must be matched to the 
maturity required to achieve the magnitude outcome applied. 
Adoption is determined by examining data from surveys 
of clinicians and patients, usage data from digital health 
solutions, and operational data sets collected by Infoway’s 
partners.  Specific definitions of adoption are designed to suit 
distinct kinds of solutions, and trended over time [6].  
Adoption is measured differently for each domain or 
technology. This is both due to the practicality and feasibility 
of collecting the data and the way in which benefits were 
initially modelled. For example, telehealth benefits are 
driven by the number of clinical sessions—defined as 
consultations involving a clinician and a patient [7] whereas 
EMR benefits are driven by the number of Canadian 
physicians who reported using an EMR to document patient 
information as shown in Figure 1. EMR benefits largely 
accrue to physicians, and as a result, it is fitting for physician 
adoption to be a driving factor.

Commonwealth Fund Surveys. 
Conversely, telehealth benefits largely accrue to patients 
and the health care systems that fund patient expenses, such 
as travel costs. As a result, benefits are driven by patient 
utilization. Diagnostic imaging benefits are driven by the 
adoption of picture archiving and communication systems 
(PACS) 
by 
radiologists, 
physician 
specialists, 
and 
emergency department nurses since they are the professions 
who would be the most likely to depend on these systems as 
part of their workflow. While other clinicians and health 
professionals are likely to benefit, it was preferable to be 
conservative in the adoption estimate, in line with the 
organization’s overall reporting principles.  
Benefit estimates for previous and subsequent years are 
dependent on the adoption of each technology by health care 
professionals in each year as compared to the base years.  
Each year’s estimate is adjusted for inflation according to the 
Statistics Canada Consumer Price Index for Health Care [8].

RESULTS 
Between2007 and 2015, over $16 billion in quantifiable 
benefits have accrued to various parts of the Canadian health 
care system as shown in Figure 2. These could take the form 
of productivity gains for clinicians, such as those seen 
through the introduction of diagnostic imaging systems.  
Alternatively, they may represent avoided expenses for 
consumers, such as avoided travel by substituting an in-
person visit to an urban centre with a virtual consultation via 
telehealth.  In 2015, the estimated value to the healthcare 
system exceeded $2.5B.

It is expected that future pan-Canadian studies, 
examining incremental benefits related to other components 
of the iEHR such as patient access to health information 
and/or electronic prescribing will expand the model 
according to the same overarching methods described above.

IV. 
ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS 
While it would be desirable to calculate return on 
investment (ROI), these benefits accrue to multiple 
stakeholders and costs are also borne by multiple and 
sometimes different stakeholders, making these calculations 
complicated, and best assessed on a stakeholder by 
stakeholder basis. As an example, productivity gains may 
increase access but result in additional costs to the health 
system since more clinical procedures and/or patient visits 
can be completed with the same inputs.  Nonetheless, this is 
a useful analysis at a macroeconomic level since it can 
demonstrate the positive effects of investing in digital health.   
The pan-Canadian studies completed to date, which drive 
the cumulative benefits calculation, were completed 
independently, over a number of years (2008 to 2015). As 
such, benefits calculated as part of one study, may also be 
reflected in another. For example, the Generation 2 Drug 
Information Systems study tracked patient safety benefits 
related to printing out prescriptions from physician EMRs—
this benefit was also included in the EMR pan-Canadian 
study. These benefits were included only once when 
aggregating totals in order to eliminate double counting.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The cumulative benefits calculation has been and 
continues to be a useful tool for demonstrating the benefits of 
digital health investments for the purpose of accountability to 
funders and taxpayers. In addition, it is a useful tool to 
persuade clinicians and other health care professional to 
adopt new technologies, and to encourage partners, such as 
jurisdictions and health care provider organizations to 
continue to invest in digital health.
