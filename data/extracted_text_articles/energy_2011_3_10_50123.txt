Abstract—In this paper, a review of the steps taken by some
of the higher educational institutes around the world to increase
their energy efﬁciency is presented. The paper also provided an
overview of the state-of-the-art in managing energy consumption
in computers. With the growing number of computers being
employed in higher educational institutes, this paper discuses
and present an example on how power management in computer
labs and IT centres can help educational institutes improve their
energy efﬁciency and carbon footprint.

I. INTRODUCTION
The warming of the climate system is one the ﬁrst main
challenges of the twenty-ﬁrst century. It has been argued
that most of the observed increase in global average tem-
peratures since the mid twentieth century is very likely due
to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas
concentrations [1]. Thus, rising up to the challenge of climate
change demands an effort from society to reduce greenhouse
gasses (GHG) emissions using new ideas and tools to achieve
sustainable development.
Universities constitute a suitable target for environmentally
friendly initiatives. Universities and colleges are usually at-
tended by young people who consider environmental issues
important to their lives [2] and are ready to accept changes.
Due to the rising utility costs that dwarf the annual rate of
inﬂation, post secondary education institutions are open to
new sustainability programs that tackle the ever-escalating
energy expenses [3]. The size of the potential target audience
also is an important reason for focusing in such educational
institutions. In Canada and the United States alone, there were
approximately 20 million students enrolled in 2007 [4] [5].
This is roughly the equivalent to the population of the whole
Scandinavian Peninsula as of 2010 [6]. One way to reduce
global GHG emissions is improving energy efﬁciency of small
and extremely ubiquitous ofﬁce equipment, such as computers,
as the number of personal computers is expected to reach 2
billion by 2014 [7]. A signiﬁcant portion of those billions of
computers is located in post secondary educational institutes.
Assuming that there is 1 computer per 10 students, as it
is the case at the University of Calgary, Canada, there will
be more than 2 million energy-hungry computers in North
American universities and colleges alone. On average, and
when kept on for the whole year, a desktop computer with
a LCD monitor uses approximately 475 kWh a year [8]. Two
million computers will consume approximately 950 MWh a
year, producing close to 665,000 metric tons of CO2 [9]; this
is roughly the same amount of CO2 emissions from 130,000
typical passenger vehicles [10]. Even a reduction of only
10% will have the same impact as taking 13,000 vehicles
off the streets. Thus, there is a signiﬁcant potential untapped
for reducing GHG by improving current usage strategies of
computers in higher education institutes.
In the present paper, efforts on improving carbon footprint
of higher educational institutes are reviewed. The review is
focused mainly on what universities are doing to increase
the efﬁciency of buildings. This paper also reviews the ap-
proaches to reduce energy consumption including behaviour-
oriented energy conservation programs, student-led initiatives
and various retroﬁts to increase energy efﬁciency in university
buildings. This paper also discusses a power management-
based strategy for saving energy consumed by computers in
post-secondary educational institutions. The results of prelimi-
nary ad hoc power management schemes provide incentive for
using data mining and artiﬁcial intelligence-based strategies
for power management in universities’ computers.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Sec-
tion II literature on energy approaches in higher educational
institutes is reviewed, including approaches to reducing energy
consumption such as behaviour-oriented energy conservation
programs, student-led initiatives and various retroﬁts to in-
crease energy efﬁciency in university buildings. Section III
includes a review on available literature on computer-related
energy consumption as well as studies on the impact of power
management schemes in computers. Section IV presents the
current state of affairs in the University of Calgary’s computer
labs as well as some preliminary results on estimated savings
using power management. Section V includes the conclusions
of the paper.
II. ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS IN HIGHER
EDUCATION INSTITUTES
Universities across the world are being faced with highly
increasing utility costs, which serve as a motivation for boost-
ing up their efforts to save money. Currently, those efforts
are headed towards developing new sustainability programs

to tackle the escalating energy expenses; however the goal of
these projects is not only the containment of utility costs but
also a reduction of the environmental footprint [11] [12] as can
be inferred from the signing of the “President’s Climate Com-
mitment” by over 600 US college and university presidents
[13].
The continuously growing energy budgets are forcing many
university presidents to make hard decisions on how to keep
the institution ﬁnancially aﬂoat. Options include cutbacks in
building maintenance and postponing the building of new
classrooms and laboratories, as well as postponing the up-
date of existing facilities [14]. Fortunately, there are other
approaches making their headways across universities. If an
institution wants to reduce utility expenses, it can do so by
adhering to LEED standards, establishing programs to reduce
transportation cost, promoting energy conservation schemes
among staff members, faculty members and students and also
making sure that any new building is energy efﬁcient.
Designing and constructing energy efﬁcient buildings have
the potential to reduce or eliminate negative environmental
impacts. Once the building is constructed, operating costs are
reduced, worker productivity and comfort are increased, all of
which result in an enhancement of the building marketability
[15]. All of these propositions mean that the construction of
an energy efﬁcient building has environmental, economic and
social beneﬁts for building owners, occupants and the general
population.
Sustainability involves improving the environmental, eco-
nomic and social impacts of resource use. The most common
target when developing a strategy to ﬁght climate change
is the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This
requires much more than just technological change; it demands
behavioural change and adaption from the community and
long-term commitment.
Any university aiming to reduce GHG emission must take
into account the fact that a behaviour-oriented energy con-
servation program, in addition to various system upgrades is
essential to a comprehensive energy reduction effort. Any kind
of measure is insufﬁcient to reduce energy consumption by
itself if the building’s occupants are not actively engaged in
the process [16].
One of the universities to implement such behaviour-
oriented energy conservation programs is the University of
Michigan (UM), an institution encompassing over 200 build-
ings, with over 41,000 students and 20,000 faculty and staff
members. Since the late 1980s, UM has made efforts to reduce
rising energy costs focusing on building modiﬁcations and
retroﬁtting measures. In 2006, UM ofﬁcially decided that it
was necessary to go beyond the technological approach of
the last 25 years. A pilot study was planned and conducted
to examine the behavioural aspects of energy consumption
among faculty, staff and students. The purpose of the study
was to determine energy consuming practices and attitudes on
campus and thus help university administrators to establish
more effective policies [14]. The ﬁndings of the pilot study at
the UM showed that a signiﬁcant proportion of the faculty,
staff and students were unaware of UM efforts to reduce
energy consumption on campus. These poor results concluded
that UM should launch a publicity campaign aimed letting
everyone know of the concerted efforts of the university
to reduce energy consumption in buildings by establishing
clear energy reduction targets. Finally, the pilot study led to
a more comprehensive understanding of how attitudes may
affect energy conservation behaviour at a large educational
institution and can also serve as a model for using behavioural
research into energy consumption reducing efforts in univer-
sities around the globe.
In the ﬁscal year 2005/2006, the University of Calgary
(UofC), emitted 214,733 metric tones of CO2 caused by its
buildings operations. By identifying the best options in energy
supply, energy conversion and distribution, and by using state
of the art technology for energy sustainability for buildings,
the UofC planned to have reduced 15% in utility budget costs
by March 2009 [17]. Since 1995, the Energy Performance
Initiative has been responsible for the use of lighting controls,
variable air conditioning, occupant awareness dashboards and
lighting retroﬁts. These upgrades resulted in the reduction of
8,100 metric tones of CO2 per year over the past 14 years. The
medium term objective of this project is to meet the Kyoto
Protocol target of reducing gas emissions 6% below 1990
levels and also to achieve LEED accreditation. The backbone
of this project is the implementation of a cogeneration plant,
which produces electrical power and thermal energy from a
single energy source: in this case, natural gas. This would
result in an increase of gas consumption by 20%, being
the extra fuel required to run the turbine engine, and the
reduction of electrical energy purchases by 50%. Although the
UofC is among the top universities in Canada implementing
sustainability measures, more emphasis must be placed on
bringing the community together to work for this project. This
should not be a project just for professors and students, but
also for staff and even visitors, because all the efforts might
lead to a poor results if there is no sufﬁcient cooperation
between the 40,000 people that currently work, live and study
and the UofC.
The University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver,
Canada, implemented the three-year project ECOTrek from
2003 to 2006. The main objective was to reduce energy
consumption, water use and GHG emissions by retroﬁtting
300 academic buildings. The project resulted in reductions
in energy consumption of 20%, water use reduction of 30%,
a reduction of 15% in GHG emission and savings of 2.6
million dollars annually [18]. These results were achieved by
using a Building Management System to automate 90% of the
academic campus HVAC systems, to match performance to the
exact occupancy of any given building. However, more work
still must be done to show people what the university is doing
and what they can do to help.
At the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC), in Spain,
a plan for sustainability in 2015 was drafted to achieve a
change in mentality and behaviour of the academic commu-
nity. This means putting more effort in social commitment

to reduce UPC’s carbon footprint instead of achieving high
amounts of resources to retroﬁt a large number of buildings.
The plan also includes the effort to secure money for research
to identify the main factors that determine the inefﬁcient
consumption of energy in campus[19]. The UPS’s Plan puts
more focus on people instead of technology, which is a dif-
ferent paradigm from that of the aforementioned universities.
Although there are no clear results of this plan yet, it will
be interesting to follow because it might give a hint on what
more can be done without spending millions of dollars on new
technology.
Another adopter of a GHG reduction policy is Yale Univer-
sity, in the United States, which in 2003 set a goal of reducing
its GHG emissions by 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. Yale’s
intention is to avoid falling into the trap of overreaching
system modiﬁcations and instead focus on speciﬁc projects
with a smaller number of participants and a less ambitious set
of goals, which is often more successful [22]. In order to have
a successful strategy to attain sustainability goals, Yale’s GHG
reduction target is part of a ﬁve step process: development
of a vision, development of quantiﬁable goals, leadership
endorsement, implementation and an institutional evolution
towards a sustainable campus. Yale has identiﬁed that almost
90% of its GHG emissions come from purchased electricity
and the two on-campus power plants, and plans to reduce these
emissions by focusing on efﬁciency upgrades and renewable
energy projects, instead of purchasing carbon offsets [20].
As of 2008, Yale had reduced is GHG emissions by 7%
below 2005 levels, and has achieved LEED accreditation in
10 buildings. Although the project in Yale looks promising;
it seems to rely too heavily on technology instead of people
involvement in a project, which is something critical for any
successful sustainability project.
The University of New Hampshire (UNH), in the United
States, is among the pioneers in reducing energy consump-
tion in educational institutes in America. For more than 35
years it has cultivated a sustainability outlook in its students
integrating sustainability into the spirit of an institution of
higher learning in order to cultivate a critical and creative
global sustainability outlook in students, staff and faculty
members [23]. The UNH approach to reduce GHG emissions
is to calculate them by using a greenhouse gas inventory
tool, developed by the UNH and marketed as the ”Clear Air-
Cool Planet Campus Carbon Calculator”. This translates to
a decrease of GHG emissions, and an increase in monetary
savings for the campus.
The most ambitious project the UNH has taken so far to
reduce its carbon footprint was the 2006 installation of a
landﬁll gas pipeline to fuel the on-campus cogeneration heat
and power plant, thus making heating/cooling and electricity
no longer the largest contributor of emissions. With an initial
$28 million investment, the plant has an anticipated payback
time of 20 years and resulted in 21% emission reduction in
the academic year 2006-2007 compared to the academic year
2005-2006. Another novel step the UNH has taken is to solicit
everyone in the university community to come up with new
ideas for projects, discuss targets and timelines. The UNH plan
incorporates both state-of-the-art measures to reduce GHG
emissions, but it also relies heavily on people and their actions
[24].
Table I lists the USA institutions of higher education that
were early adopters of greenhouse reduction targets, their
commitments and dates of commitments.
There is also a variety of student-led initiatives to reduce
energy consumption and ﬁghting climate change in universities
around the world, ranging from the use of renewable energy
[25] to reducing GHG emissions using energy efﬁcient equip-
ment and energy efﬁcient buildings [26]. The most common
type of student-led initiative is focused on awareness-raising,
providing students with real options for taking personal action
to reduce their impact on the environment. Usually the core
of these awareness-raising campaigns is a weeklong series
of events to send a message to the student body about
the importance of sustainability. Another type of student-
led initiative is residence buildings competitions to reduce
electricity consumption. This initiative proved to be the most
compelling for students; the winning campus was able to
incorporate 46% of students living on campus and achieved a
reduction electricity consumption of 4%. An additional beneﬁt
of this competition is that it provided a new impetus to install
energy meters in residences and a high level of institutional
involvement was achieved at the participating universities [27].
Students are key players on campuses and have a unique
perspective that is helpful to any type of discussion around
campus climate solutions, this discussion should have in mind
that the best option for encouraging young leadership in
creating climate solutions on campuses is a shared power
relationship, since the student body will implement many of
the initiatives in residences and in their student union.

III. CURRENT ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN COMPUTERS
AND RELATED WORK
Since the introduction of the personal computer in the 1980,
the growth in the market for this particular device has been
remarkable. It was only until 1992 when the Environmental
Protection Agency launched the Energy Star program, that
computers among other electronic product and appliances
started being tested and labeled for energy efﬁciency [28].
In order to improve energy efﬁciency, Energy Star labeled
computers and electronic devices use power management (PM)
schemes, in which products enter a low power state after a
certain period of inactivity, saving energy. In computers, the
period of inactivity that triggers a transition to a low power
state can be customized by the user. Since PM parameters are
customizable, a user can potentially drive energy savings down
to zero.
The University of California, in Berkeley, conducted an
after-hours survey in ofﬁce, education and health-care build-
ings with the objective of collecting power data on a 1,453
desktop computers during 4 hours [29]. The results indicated
a mean turn off rate of 36%, that varied from building to
building. A mere 6% of the computers had a PM scheme in
place. As for LCD monitors the average turn off rate was 32%
with a 75% PM-on rate, however, the monitors needed a signal
from the PC to enter a low power mode. The study reports that
university buildings have the highest monitor PM rate, 87% but
at the same time, monitor turn off rates were the lowest, 13%,
in university buildings. The lack of an automated collection of
data is responsible for making the study look like a snapshot
of the problem. It is desirable to have a more extensive set of
data over the time, which will show possible seasonalities.
The relationship between the user and the PM rates were
studied by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In this
study, the information was collected using after-hours audits in
non occupied commercial buildings, since they have relatively
ﬁxed schedules. The audit consisted in physical inspection of
the power cord of the computer [30]. Not surprisingly it was
found that PM inﬂuences energy use to a great extent, and
also that the relationship between user behaviour and on/off
modes is very straightforward. If somebody is using the device,
it is on, otherwise, it is off. Background network activity may
keep a computer from entering a low power mode, and if the
computer enters a low power mode, it may fail to interact
correctly with the network. In this case, the PM is disabled.
A PM scheme has to wait for a certain period of time
of inactivity. The average PM delay time was found to be
15 minutes. Four scenarios were evaluated in [30]: as-found,
computers always on but with PM in place, computer turned
off after hours without PM in place, and ﬁnally, computers
turned off after hours and with PM in place during the day.
It was also found that PM rate depends on corporate culture
which varies in different types of industry. Total energy con-
sumption by a computer was calculated under each scenario.
The ﬁrst one constitutes 100% of consumption over a year. The
second scenario, consumed only 52% over the same period,
the third scenario consumed even less, 20% and ﬁnally, the
fourth and most aggressive scenario takes consumption down
to 17%. The same calculations were done for a LCD monitor
under each scenario. Again, the ﬁrst one constitutes 100% of
consumption over a year. The second scenario, consumed only
22% over the same period, the third scenario consumed even
less, 21% and ﬁnally, the fourth and most aggressive scenario
takes consumption down to 17%.
These results must be taken cautiously, since they are based
on a commercial building with more strict hours of operation,
compared to a post secondary education institute where classes
can go until 10 p.m. However, they provide a good argument
to increase the implementation of PM successfully to attain
energy savings. Weekends and evenings make up 75% of the
week. In the average ofﬁce space with a 35 hour work week,
a computer that is on 7 hours is in active use only for 3 hours
[31], the remaining time, it is idle and wasting energy.
In another study, the Lawrence Berkeley National Labora-
tory analyzed the relationship between consumption of energy
and power on 14 desktop computers [32]. Computers and
monitors have many levels of activity. A computer can be
on-idle, which means that it is not running any process and
thus the processor can be stop. Another mode of operation
is on-active, when the computer is performing calculations.
Hibernate is not a mode itself, but a process in which the com-
puter saves the current state of the system into the hard drive,
and then, the computer shuts itself down. Energy consumption
was measured for every power mode using a power line meter.
For desktop computers, it was found that they consume on
average 3W when turned off, and an average of 9W when in
sleep mode. Also, the average recovery time from sleep mode
was close to 10 seconds. For monitors, it was found that their
consumption is 2W on average both for when turned off and
in sleep mode, and also, monitors require 2 seconds recovery
time.
As mentioned before, any PM scheme requires time to enter
a sleep state and also to recover itself from it. This amount of
time will obviously have an impact on energy consumption. A
study was conducted on this subject and it found - via surveys
and ﬁeld measurements - the relationship between the delay
time and the average rate of PM [33]. The lower rate of use
and the shorter delay time will result in a higher rate of PM
operating during idling. For a time delay of 5 minutes, the PM
rate was 76.3%, whereas for a delay of 60 minutes, the PM
rate was 19.6%.
IV. STRATEGIES FOR SAVING ENERGY IN COMPUTER
LABS: THE EXAMPLE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY
The University of Calgary, Canada, with over 30,000 un-
dergraduate and graduate students it is currently ranked as
one of Canada’s most sustainable universities by the College
Sustainability Report Card 2011 [34]. The Information and
Communication Technology, ICT Building at the University
of Calgary has three Windows-based computer labs totalling
64 desktop computers. Each computer has the same make,
the CPU consumes 50W idle, 2.9 W in sleep state and 0.7W

when it is off. As for the LCD monitors, they consume 22
W when used, and their consumption goes down to 0.4 W
when in stand-by mode. Currently, the computers inside ICT
building are never turned off as part of the IT policy in place.
The rationale behind this is that the computers must be on so
that they have immediate access to the latest security updates.
Also, as part of the security policies of the U of C, every time
a user logs in and logs out of a computer located inside a
computer lab, a timestamp is recorded.
The timestamps recorded for those three labs from Septem-
ber 1st 2008 to August 31st 2009 were analyzed. Using the
timestamps, the number of working computers in each minute
of a full year was obtained, as shown in Fig. 1. Seasonalities
are very clear, there are peaks and valleys and long periods
of no computer use. Peaks are related to examination periods.
Valleys are related to special periods such as the beginning
of the semester, a no classes 1-week period and December
holidays. After the Academic Year ends, the Spring/Summer
term begins. During this particular period, computer usage
drops dramatically since most of the undergraduate students
are on vacation. Most of the usage thus can be attributed to
graduate students. It is clear that using even a simple power
management scheme would results in signiﬁcant savings for
the U of C. Three simple strategies are proposed based on
common sense of the behaviour of computer labs over an
extended period of time.
Under Strategy 1, all the computers inside the lab are
kept on from 06:00 to 24:00, during the remaining 6 hours
the computer would be in a deep sleep state. Strategy 2 is
takes into account the fact that the computer usage patterns

are not the same during weekdays and weekends. During
the weekdays, computer labs are controlled using Strategy
1; however during the weekends, a new strategy is used. On
Sundays, only 50% of the computers are kept on from 10:00
to 18:00; all the computers in the lab remain in the deep
sleep state for the time remaining. On Saturdays, 50% of the
computers are kept on from 06:00 to 18:00; after that time all
the computers in the lab remain in deep sleep state.
Strategy 3 takes into account different patterns during the
week and also seasons. During Fall and Winter it is expected
that the number of computers in use will be higher than
the number of computer in use during Spring and Summer.
Strategy 2 is implemented during September 1st and April
30st. From May 1st until August 31st a new strategy is used.
From Mondays to Saturdays, only 50% of the computers are
kept on from 07:00 to 19:00; all the computers in the lab
remain in the deep sleep state for the rest of the time. During
Sundays, 50% of the computers are kept on from 10:00 to
18:00; all the computers in the lab remain in the deep sleep
state for the rest of the time. Each strategy is simulated over
the same 365 days period for each computer lab and then
compared with the current 24/7 PM policy in place. Table II
provides a comparison between all of them for each computer
lab. It is easy to see that as the complexity of the strategies
increase, so does energy efﬁciency for the computer labs.
The analysis of the gathered data shows that data mining
and machine learning approaches can potentially generate PM
schedules that improve efﬁciency computer labs signiﬁcantly.
Those approaches are under investigation and will be re-
ported in future publications. It is important to ensure that
sophisticated PM strategies are feasible. There is a need for
balancing energy savings with the comfort level for students
and acceptable security measures for IT operators.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper presented an overview of the ongoing efforts
in some higher education institutes with regard to energy efﬁ-
ciency and conservation. The available reports point that while
technological improvements and retroﬁts can potentially im-
prove energy efﬁciency is such institutes, awareness programs
to engage the students, faculty and staff in those programs

are key in obtaining acceptable results. Also reviewed in this
paper is the potential for energy conservation in computer labs
in higher educational institutes. With more than 20,000,000
in North America, and the typical one computer for each
10 student norm, the potential for energy conservation in
computer labs and IT centres is signiﬁcant.
An example of three simple power management schemes
based on the data from typical computer labs at the University
of Calgary was reported in this paper. The results show that
with very naive solutions, energy consumption and emissions
in computer labs can be cut by up to 50%, from an estimated
8 metric tons per computer lab during a year. Extrapolating
the results, just by changing the current power management
schemes in the computer labs, the UofC would stop emitting
495 metric tons of CO2 which has the same effect as taking
approximately 95 cars off the streets. This would result in
a smaller carbon footprint for the UofC, a boost for its
sustainability credentials and a reduction in utility costs.
