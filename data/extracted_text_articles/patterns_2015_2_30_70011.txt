Abstract— Findings from scientific disciplines with close ties to 
the industry – such as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) – 
can be useful for advancing both the scientific discipline itself 
as well as the associated industry. It is, therefore, an additional 
challenge to consolidate and convert the scientific knowledge 
gained into a format of which is applicable and understandable 
in practice in order to provide meaningful and usable tools for 
practitioners in their daily work routines. We used patterns to 
combine research results and industry know-how into solutions 
for distraction-related design problems in the automotive 
domain. In this paper, we present our pattern generation 
process that resulted in the creation of 16 patterns with input 
from scientists, as well as industrial stakeholders, in several 
key phases. Thereby, we discuss the advantages of patterns as 
a means to put scientific knowledge into practice. The 
contribution of this paper is a pattern generation and 
validation process and structure tailored towards combining 
scientific results and industry knowledge, as well as our 
pattern structure that resulted from this process.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Patterns are a method to capture proven design solutions 
to reoccurring problems. They are a structured description of 
best practices and, as such, highly problem-oriented and 
reusable [1]. The use of patterns in design can improve the 
design process (both with regards to time and effort spent) to 
a considerable degree [2][3][4]. Patterns are also a 
recognized way of facilitating communication between 
different stakeholders. Since scientific research in Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI) is closely interconnected with 
the industry, patterns could serve as a tool to communicate 
scientifically proven solutions to industry stakeholders. In 
our work, we aimed at generating patterns for HCI 
researchers and industry stakeholders based on scientific 
findings and transform them – by directly involving industry 
practitioners – into solutions that are relevant for and usable 
by these stakeholders. The underlying research question is 
how scientific findings may be translated into design patterns 
usable for practitioners in their daily routines and how such 
patterns may be generated by including scientific and 
industry stakeholders. 
The outcome of our efforts was a pattern structure that 
incorporates scientific results and fits industry stakeholder 
needs, as well as a first set of 16 automotive User Experience 
(UX) design patterns. We refer to UX design patterns as 
patterns that tackle user experience issues in their core. In 
this paper, we present the final pattern structure, as well as 
the phases of the pattern generation process involving both 
scientists and industry stakeholders (We use the term 
‘generation’ to delineate our approach from pattern finding 
methods, 
which 
usually 
focus 
only 
on 
actual 
implementations, and not theoretical or scientific works). We 
begin with an overview of current pattern literature in 
Section II. In Section III, we describe our pattern finding 
process via the concrete pattern structure example and its 
development. In section IV, we provide a summary of the 
overall process, together with a brief discussion on the 
limitations and potentials of our approach.

RELATED WORK 
In order to provide best practices and specific knowledge, 
the patterns approach has been well established in the 
domain of HCI [1]. Recently, specific domains in HCI, such 
as UX research, also deployed patterns to collect and 
structure their knowledge [3][4].  
Köhne [6] (based on Quibeldey-Cirkel [7]) outlines 
specific steps for generating patterns. The process starts with 
discovering patterns, so-called pattern mining, by identifying 
whether a solution is valuable to solve a problem. The next 
step consists of pattern writing, where the problem solution 
is described in a defined structure. This is followed by 
shepherding, in which an expert provides support in 
improving the patterns content. Thereafter, a writers 
workshop is conducted. In such a workshop, a group of 
pattern authors discuss a pattern. Based on the feedback from 
the writers’ workshop, the pattern author revises the pattern 
(author review). In a next step, the patterns are made public 
in a pattern repository, which is open to anonymous peer 
review. Finally, the pattern collection is published in a 
pattern book making the final patterns available for a large 
readership. 
Similarly, Biel et al. [8] split the process of defining trust 
patterns for interaction design into four subtasks. The first 
task is identifying a pattern by analyzing the solutions used 
by designers. Second, the pattern gets categorized in order to

make it reusable and accessible for designers. Third, the 
pattern is described following a specific structure. The 
fourth task is evaluating the pattern to prove its quality 
before it is introduced to a pattern library. 
Aside from starting the pattern mining from designers’ 
practical knowledge, patterns can also be harvested from 
scientific research findings. Martin et al. [9] use patterns to 
describe findings from ethnographies. For creating their 
patterns, they started by looking for specific examples in a 
particular domain in ethnographic studies and then tried to 
expand the observed phenomena to other domains (similar 
but different examples). Krischkowsky et al. [10] introduce a 
step-by-step guidance for HCI researchers for generating 
patterns from HCI study insights. According to them, the 
first step is giving novice and expert HCI researchers a brief 
overview on the concept of patterns and, more specifically, 
Contextual User Experience (CUX) patterns [4] (i.e., patterns 
to enhance user experience in a particular context). After 
this, the next step of the guidance concerns the reflection and 
selection of relevant UX related results from empirical 
studies conducted by the researchers. In a third step, HCI 
researchers develop their own CUX patterns, which are then 
internally evaluated by researchers following a checklist. In 
the last step, researchers give feedback on the pattern 
generation process. 
Following a user centered patterns generation approach, 
we aimed at including industry designers within a specific 
domain (in our case automotive user interface design) in the 
patterns generation process in order to bring the target group 
as early as possible into the loop. Other approaches often 
miss to explicitly include industry stakeholders in the 
patterns generation process. In the following section, we 
outline and reflect on how we generated patterns. Further, we 
describe a seven-step approach that describes how we 
generated an initial set of automotive UX patterns from a 
scientific knowledge transfer workshop (step 1) to final 
pattern iteration (step 7). Based on a reflection of our work, 
we conclude with a novel patterns generation approach 
consisting of five phases. In addition, this paper presents an 
according pattern structure for distraction-related design 
problems in the automotive domain. Both, the patterns 
generation approach as well as the pattern structure for 
automotive UX patterns, are the main contributions of this 
paper.  
III. 
THE PATTERN GENERATION PROCESS 
Within our research activities, the need for pattern 
guidance occurred within a national project focusing on 
contextual interface research in the automotive domain. In 
particular, the following section outlines the process of how 
we developed a pattern structure that provides insights, 
information, and guidance on how to design for a positive 
User Experience (UX) for the driver. This general aim (i.e., 
designing for a positive UX) was divided into more specific 
goals related to distinct UX factors (e.g., workload, fun, or 
trust). As the focus of our work was on the pattern generation 
process and the pattern structure, we decided to select one 
specific UX factor and improve the process and the structure 
by developing patterns for this factor. We chose to generate 
patterns for reducing workload that is caused by distraction, 
as this constitutes one of the most prevailing and severe 
problems in the automotive domain. In the next paragraphs, 
we outline each phase in the generation process in detail, 
reflecting on each step individually. 
A. Phase 1: Starting from scientific knowledge 
In this first phase, we started from pure scientific 
knowledge about distraction-related design problems in the 
automotive domain to create an initial draft set of patterns. 
This seemed like a logical first step, since we wanted to go 
from the science to the practice. As we would learn later on, 
however, a slightly different approach would have been even 
better. This will be reflected in the conclusion chapter. The 
first phase can be segmented into four sub-steps, outlined in 
the following sections.  
B. Step 1: Scientific knowledge transfer workshop 
Within the first step, a knowledge transfer workshop, 
organized by pattern experts and HCI researchers in the 
automotive domain, was conducted. Hereby, the main goal 
was to give experts in the automotive domain know-how on 
pattern generation. This know-how was provided by HCI 
pattern experts, in order to facilitate the development of an 
initial draft of patterns. The workshop lasted approximately 
four hours. Overall, six HCI researchers, all closely familiar 
with the automotive context, and two HCI pattern experts, 
who led the workshop, participated in this workshop.  
In this initial knowledge transfer session, participants 
were introduced to patterns in general and the role of patterns 
in HCI in particular. This included aspects such as the 
usefulness of patterns as a tool for documentation, collection, 
communication, and representing knowledge [1]. They were 
also introduced into the distinguishing characteristics 
between patterns and guidelines. Thereafter, example 
patterns from other domains were presented (e.g., [11], [12], 
[13]). Subsequently, participants where shown the main 
goals for the development of patterns in the automotive 
domain (e.g., collect a number of UX related patterns, 
structured guidance on how to design for a good UX 
regarding 
advanced 
in-car 
systems). 
Thereafter, 
a 
presentation of the initial pattern structure was given, based 
on the CUX patterns approach [4]. This approach has already 
proved its value for collecting and structuring knowledge on 
UX [3]. The CUX pattern approach was chosen, as it 
explicitly considers the relation of UX and contextual 
aspects. In order to provide a better understanding of the 
CUX pattern approach, an exemplary CUX pattern reflecting 
on ‘increased workload by font size’ was shown to the 
participants. At the end of the workshop, participants were 
introduced to the entire, initially defined, pattern structure for 
UX patterns in the automotive domain (see Table 1, not-
underlined parts).  
C. Step 2: An Initial set of patterns 
After the workshop, the HCI researchers (and pattern 
experts) received the task to create two patterns within the 
next 10 days based on literature and/or their own research 
activities. They received a template with the pattern structure 
39

PATTERNS 2015 : The Seventh International Conferences on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

as a guideline for creating a first set of patterns related to a 
car driver’s workload caused by distraction. Furthermore, the 
HCI researchers were also encouraged to give individual 
feedback to the pattern experts about issues and problems 
concerning the generation process, as well as the given 
structure (i.e., CUX pattern structure template). More details 
about the identified issues and problems are outlined in the 
next section.  
Within this first generation phase, 16 patterns focusing 
on workload caused by distraction were developed (i.e., two 
patterns per person). All patterns were derived on the basis 
of scientific literature (e.g., research articles or book chapters 
referenced in the pattern). Also, two pattern experts were 
involved in this process and generated two patterns each. The 
generated patterns were about one page each and exclusively 
dealt with design solutions (e.g., voice interaction, 
multimodal 
interfaces, 
or 
information 
presentations) 
addressing the problem of increased workload due to 
distraction.  
 
D. Step 3: First iteration based on participants feedback: 
identified problems in the generation process, resulted 
in a refined pattern structure 
The first round of pattern generation led to the 
identification of several issues with the initial pattern 
structure. During creating their patterns, the HCI researchers 
listed and forwarded encountered problems to the pattern 
experts. In a second workshop, the HCI researchers 
discussed their experiences with the provided pattern 
structure and the pattern creation process with the pattern 
experts and collected further problematic issues. The pattern 
experts then used the feedback for improving the pattern 
section structure and the related instruction for how to 
generate patterns based on the provided structure. 
The refined pattern structure, as the outcome of the third 
step, is presented in Table 1. Changes to the section name 
and instruction are marked with an underline, parts not 
underlined are those from steps 1 and 2. The proposed 
pattern structure consists of nine parts: name (a description 
of the solution of the pattern), UX factor (the addressed 
automotive user experience factor), problem statement (a 
very short description of the problem which should be solved 
by the pattern), forces (a more detailed explanation of the 
problem), context (the application context of the pattern), 
solution (the proposed solution of the particular pattern), 
examples (concrete examples of best practices), keywords 
(phrases related to the pattern),  and sources (origin of the 
pattern). 
Most of the issues brought forward were concerned with 
what makes the pattern a high-quality pattern and what 
supports the comprehensibility of the pattern. More 
specifically, the HCI researchers had difficulties with 
achieving the aim of a pattern to provide best practices. The 
HCI researchers experienced it as challenging to judge if the 
provided solutions are the “gold standard”. They also felt 
uneasy if “old” literature can serve as basis for pattern 
creation. Therefore, it would be more realistic to speak of 
providing existing knowledge to the best of one’s judgment, 
i.e., preferably using the newest knowledge for underpinning 
a specific pattern and using as many potential evidences 
(studies, norms, etc.) as possible. Our patterns suggest 
solutions for specific UX demands in the car area based on 
existing knowledge (e.g., studies, best practices). 
Another difficulty is related to deciding on the 
abstraction level of a pattern. The HCI researchers were 
unsure whether they should create very general patterns 
(global patterns) versus very specific patterns (sub-patterns, 
local patterns). They finally agreed on providing patterns that 
are abstract enough to make generalizations, while providing 
practical solutions at the same time. Thus, both elements 
(i.e., generalization as well as a concrete example) should be 
provided. 
Identifying the stakeholders of the patterns was also an 
issue. It was unclear to the HCI researchers whom they 
should address with the patterns; whether the future users of 
the created patterns are designers (expert or novice), domain-
specific users (e.g., industrial manufacturers), researchers, or 
developers.

PATTERNS 2015 : The Seventh International Conferences on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

The HCI researchers also experienced difficulties in 
creating a pattern name; should the pattern name be 
formulated as solution or problem? It was eventually decided 
to opt for a solution orientation of the pattern name and 
modified the pattern instruction accordingly. Moreover, 
using technical terms in the pattern name lead to 
comprehensibility problems among the HCI researchers. A 
pattern needs to be easy to understand and quickly assessed. 
Consequently, very specific technical terms should not be 
used in the pattern name and, if they occur in the description 
of the pattern, they need to be explained. 
Furthermore, the first round of pattern generation 
revealed that the HCI researchers deployed different ways to 
generate their patterns, which are based on existing state of 
the art knowledge/experience in the field, on own empirical 
studies, on literature (desktop research of empirical studies), 
as well as on existing structured knowledge. Therefore, the 
section on sources (#9) was supplemented with different 
ways to generate patterns. 
E. Step 4: Participants iterate patterns based on refined 
structure 
Finally, the HCI researchers task was to iterate their 
initially created patterns based on the refined pattern 
structure. Each researcher transformed the existing pattern 
he/she originally constructed into the new pattern structure. 
Parts were reformulated, where necessary, and other parts 
were added. 
F. Step 5: Industry stakeholder pattern structure 
evaluation workshop 
To further iterate and finalize the pattern structure, we 
involved the industry stakeholders in a workshop with the 
aim of evaluating the current pattern structure on the basis 
of two representative patterns. The workshop was conducted 
at our facility with five participants (one female and four 
male) from our industrial partner from the automotive 
domain. The participants’ age ranged from 20 to 45 years, 
job experience from 7 months to 20 years. Their 
professional 
background 
was 
software 
developers, 
engineers, and designers. After a 10-minute general 
introduction to patterns and our pattern structure, 
participants received printouts of one of our automotive UX 
patterns with the instruction to read through it attentively 
(duration: 10 minutes). After that, they had to fill in a 
questionnaire regarding the quality and understandability of 
the pattern. Participants then received another pattern 
printout and were again given 10 minutes to read it 
thoroughly. This was done to ensure that the participants 
had a means of comparison and also to reduce bias 
regarding the quality (or the lack thereof) of the pattern 
structure based on only one pattern. After these 
preparations, the main part of the workshop, a discussion 
session (total duration: 1.5 hours), began. The moderated 
discussion was audio recorded and later transcribed for 
further analysis. During the course of the discussion, 
participants could voice concerns they had encountered 
when reading the individual patterns, together with 
suggestions for improvements to the pattern structure, as 
well as the existing automotive UX patterns in particular. 
In the following section, we will outline the most 
important outcomes of the workshop, in reference to the 
iterated structure shown in Table 1. Participants were 
confused by the separation of problem and forces, stating 
that they did not understand why those were two separate 
categories and that they found the term ‘forces’ itself 
difficult to understand. Furthermore, participants found that 
they had to read quite far into the patterns before they knew 
what the patterns were exactly about. Generally, the 
participants desired an “abstract” for each pattern, 
containing scope, context, and possibly an outlook on the 
solution in a very compact format. In addition, the pattern 
should be re-structured, so that the most important 
information (at the very least: name, keywords, and 
problem) is at the very beginning of the pattern. Or, as one 
participant put it, “If using a pattern collection is more 
cumbersome than using Google and produces lesser results, 
then there is little reason to use that pattern collection.” 
The writing style and vocabulary used in both patterns 
was perceived as very unusual by the participants and more 
“scientific” than what they were used to. More specifically, 
they were not used to citing sources for every claim and the 
rather high number of technical terms used in each pattern. 
While they found the scientific writing style an overall 
pleasing quality that should be kept, they suggested a 
minimal citation style (numbers only, full references only at 
the very end of the pattern collection). The issues identified 
in the workshop were then further discussed and 
transformed into concrete instructions for another pattern 
structure overhaul. 
G. Step 6: Final pattern structure iteration 
Based on the feedback gained from this workshop, the 
pattern structure underwent a final iteration, which would 
then become the basis for all further patterns (see Table 2). 
Similar to the pattern structure shown in Table 1, the final 
pattern structure consists of nine elements. The name of the 
pattern should again focus on the provided solution. The 
intent should include the main category of the pattern, a 
short problem statement, and briefly outline the context in 
which the pattern should be used. It replaces the problem 
statement (3) and the context (6) of the initial structure 
presented in Table 1. The new element topics is a structured 
list of keywords describing the problem scope. The element 
problem replaced the forces (4) section. The new element 
scenario gives a detailed description of the problem in a 
scenario like style. The solution again describes the solution 
to the problem. Within the final structure, we provide a 
structured approach how to present the solution. Examples, 
as before, should show best practices of the pattern. 
Keywords, again, should help to find related patterns. 
Finally, sources link to the origin of the pattern. The 
element UX factor (2) from the initial pattern structure was 
omitted at all.

PATTERNS 2015 : The Seventh International Conferences on Pervasive Patterns and Applications

The new structure focuses on informing the reader as 
concisely as possible about whether the pattern is relevant 
for them. Name, intent, and topics are standardized and kept 
brief so that only a minimal amount of time is needed to 
read and process them. Context and forces are combined 
into the new Scenario-category, since the stakeholders had a 
hard time differentiating between them and found the 
distinction to be inconsequential in practice. 
TABLE II.  
FINAL PATTERN STRUCTURE  
 
H. Step 7: Final pattern iteration 
 The entire set of 16 patterns was then revised, based on 
the above-mentioned structure (see Table 2). Scenario, 
Solution and Examples specifically underwent an adaptation 
according to the stakeholders’ requirements. If possible, 
solutions were also represented graphically or illustrations 
from cited publications were added. Concrete examples 
(state of the art) from recent production vehicles illustrated, 
if appropriate, the examples section. In general, care was 
taken to present the information in every pattern in a 
compact form, easily comprehensible and practicable. This 
final iteration was completed as a team effort by two 
scientists. 
I. 
Validating the patterns 
For the final validation of the iterated pattern set, we 
conducted a second workshop at our facility with seven 
participants (4 employees from our industrial partner and 3 
researchers; 6 male and 1 female). Age ranged from 21 to 48 
years, job experience from one month to eight years. 
Regarding their professional background, they were software 
developers, engineers, designers, and HCI experts. Part of 
the participants from the first workshop also participated in 
the second one. To have a good mix of informed and fresh 
views, we involved two stakeholders who had already 
participated in the previous workshop, and two who were 
completely new to the topic. The overall goal of the second 
workshop was to assess the quality of the first UX pattern 
set, as well as to iterate the pattern set based on the industry 
stakeholders’ feedback.  
In this workshop, the full iterated pattern set was 
presented to the participants and evaluated on a peer-pattern 
basis. Each of the 16 existing patterns was rated individually 
by each participant. To avoid serial positions effects and 
similar forms of bias, the patterns were presented to 
participants in different orders. After a 10-minute general 
introduction to patterns and explanations of the iterated UX 
pattern structure from the first workshop, a researcher 
explained the purpose and the agenda of the one-day 
workshop to the participants. 
Then, each participant read thoroughly and rated each 
pattern based on the following slightly modified quality 
criteria checklist [14] that consists of four quality criteria (c1, 
c2, c3, c4). The first quality criterion (c1) states that all parts 
of a pattern description should be reasonable to the pattern 
users. This means they should have a meaningful name, a 
clear formulated problem statement, and enough background 
information for the provided scenario, concrete solutions, as 
well as give plausible examples. The second quality criterion 
(c2) addresses five aspects: (1) completeness, i.e., necessary 
information is given in the pattern; (2) clarity of the 
language, i.e., the style of the pattern is well-readable; (3) 
problem-centricity, i.e., the scenario, solutions, and examples 
are coherent and clearly related to the problem description; 
(4) good balance between concreteness and abstractness; and 
(5) helpfulness, i.e., the presented patterns support 
stakeholders to develop better interactive systems. The third 
criterion (c3) requested an individual overall assessment of

the patterns from a more general perspective.  C4 states that 
the whole collection of patterns captures relevant knowledge 
about User Experience and provides a suitable common basis 
for designers, developers, and researchers. C4 applies to the 
whole collection and not to individual patterns. It was, 
therefore, excluded from the questionnaire and instead 
discussed in plenum at the end of the workshop for a 
qualitative, overall assessment of the pattern set quality and 
applicability. 
After the rating of the patterns, a moderated discussion 
session took place. During the discussion, participants could 
voice all concerns they had encountered when reading the 16 
existing patterns, together with suggestions for future 
improvements to the existing UX patterns. In order to trigger 
the discussion, two questions of criterion (c4) from the 
quality framework were asked to the participants: Do you 
think that the presented patterns support the communication 
of designers, developers and researches by providing 
common basis? Do you think the presented patterns capture 
relevant knowledge about user experience? The discussion 
session was audio-recorded and later on transcribed for 
further analysis. 
Due to the low number of participants, the questionnaire 
results were analyzed in descriptive form. The results of the 
first quality criterion (c1), rated on a scale from 1 (absolutely 
agree) to 5 (do not agree at all), show that the pattern set had 
a meaningful name (M=1.86, SD=1.08), a clear stated 
problem (M=1.48, SD=0.80), and enough background 
information of the stated scenario (M=2.03, SD=1.02). The 
two last categories of c1, i.e., the solution (M=2.69, SD= 
1.15) and the examples (M=2.60, SD=1.16), were rated as 
neutral. 
The questionnaire responses of the second quality 
criterion (c2) indicated a very positive overall picture with 
mean values all in a positive spectrum (lowest was 1.55) and 
the most negative responses being neutral ones (2.78). The 
responses were also rated on a scale from 1 (absolutely 
agree) to 5 (do not agree at all). Lowest mean values were 
identified clarity of the language used in the pattern (M= 
1.55, SD=0.73) and the problem-centricity (M=2.16, 
SD=0.88). 
In total, the participants perceived only one pattern as 
implausible (c3). As mentioned by the participants during the 
discussion 
(c4), 
the 
presented 
patterns 
support 
the 
communication of designers, developers and researchers, 
provide a common basis, and capture relevant knowledge 
about user experience. 
One recurring problem, which had sporadically been 
voiced during the previous workshop as well, was the 
relevance of the problem statements in the discussion. The 
participants felt that the problems stated in some patterns 
were only partly relevant for them and while they 
appreciated the solutions, they would often have desired to 
be part of the problem statement beforehand. This led us to 
modify our pattern generation approach to involve the 
industry stakeholders already during the very first step in the 
pattern generation process. The list of design problems that 
patterns are then generated for should, together with a rating 
regarding relevance and importance, come from the industry 
stakeholders themselves. Ideally, this should happen with 
guidance and assistance from researchers. Contextual 
inquiries or brainstorming with subsequent problem rating 
sessions with the industry stakeholders are both suitable 
methods to achieve this.  
IV. 
CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have described a seven-step approach 
how to generate (automotive) UX patterns. It started with a 
scientific knowledge transfer workshop (step 1), which led to 
an initial set of patterns (step 2). A first iteration based on 
participants’ feedback and the identification of problems in 
the generation process resulted in a refined pattern structure 
(step 3). An iteration of the patterns led to a refined pattern 
structure (step 4), with which we conducted a pattern 
structure evaluation workshop with industry stakeholders 
(step 5). Another pattern structure iteration (step 6) led to a 
final pattern iteration (step 7). 
By involving industry practitioners directly in the pattern 
generation process, we were able to translate scientifically 
proven 
results 
into 
proven 
solutions 
for 
industry 
stakeholders. As mentioned earlier, it might have been 
beneficial to include industry stakeholders before the first 
patterns were generated. We experienced that not all of the 
patterns we initially produced were urgent problems for our 
practitioners from the industry. They mentioned that an 
approach where they could identify problems of high priority 
to them would be better. Nonetheless, the insights we gained 
have resulted in a pattern structure suitable for industry 
stakeholders’ needs in the automotive domain. The structure 
focuses on clarity and brevity and should, with slight 
modifications, be adaptable for other industry domains as 
well. Furthermore, we have documented our pattern 
generation process, together with both scientists and industry 
stakeholders. A high level overview of the process can be 
seen in Figure 1. It includes a first phase with industry focus, 
in which industry problems are identified, and where patterns

might be a beneficial way of helping to solve these problems. 
In phase 2, we suggest generating an initial set of patterns. 
Phase 3 includes evaluation and iteration through a scientific 
lens. Phase 4 includes evaluation and iteration with a focus 
from industry and, in phase 5, patterns are validated. 
Apart from the patterns generation process, this paper 
presents a structure for automotive user experience patterns. 
It consists of nine elements (name, intent, topics, problem, 
scenario, solution, examples, keywords, and sources), which 
proved to be a useful way to structure UX patterns in the 
automotive domain. 
The approach described in this paper is a departure from 
the common practice of documenting already working 
solutions, to a way to convert (proven) scientific results to 
working problem solutions. The evaluation of the described 
approach was based mainly on feedback of practitioners 
from the HCI car domain. Furthermore, we did not compare 
the quality of our patterns’ problem solutions to those of 
other HCI patterns in our research. While the positive 
assessment of the overall process and its results (the 
patterns) provides a positive outlook, further evaluations 
(and possible iterations) are certainly needed to fully 
validate it as a reusable standard procedure in the 
community. 
Overall, the pattern generation process and structure we 
gained will be used for generating additional UX patterns for 
the automotive domain. More specifically, we intend to also 
cover the factors perceived safety and joy of use and generate 
patterns for these. We have already begun the generation 
process by identifying common design problems related to 
these factors in a workshop together with the industry 
stakeholders. In the future, we intend to implement the full 
pattern collection as an online database based on the pattern 
framework proposed in [15]. We will continue using our 
inclusive pattern generation process to translate scientifically 
proven results into proven solutions for industry stakeholders 
and encourage others to employ and further refine our 
proposed method.
