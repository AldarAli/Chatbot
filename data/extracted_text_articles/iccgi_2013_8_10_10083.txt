Abstract— The fourth generation (4G) network integrates 
various access technologies, such as UMTS, WiMAX, and 
WLAN. In the 4G environment, a handset with multiple 
interfaces can switch among access networks to achieve 
ubiquitous service. However, how to select the best access 
network is critical for users to obtain their preferred services. 
In the past, Always Best Network Connection (ABNC) has 
been presented to select an access network based on properties 
of communication session, which is composed of both source 
and destination access networks.  Nevertheless, ABNC fails to 
consider current multimedia services, which require an end-to-
end bandwidth much larger than that of voice sessions and 
media types, such as voice, video, and data. In this paper, an 
extension to ABNC is presented to support multimedia services 
by exploiting parallel paths between multimode handsets. We 
formulated the problem as a Multiple Attributes Decision 
Making (MADM) hierarchy with a utility-based media 
assignment and utilized a hybrid Analytic Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) scheme to solve 
the problem. Finally, an example is illustrated to show how the 
scheme works.

I. 
 INTRODUCTION  
The main feature of 4G is in its ability to integrate 
different access technologies, such as universal mobile 
telecommunication 
system 
(UMTS) 
[1], 
Worldwide 
Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) [2], and 
wireless local area networks (WLAN) [2], leading us to all-
IP networking era. The vision of a 4G mobile system is to 
integrate various radio access technologies (RATs) into a 
common network called the open wireless architecture 
(OWA) platform. 
To enjoy the convenience of 4G, nowadays, handsets are 
equipped with multiple interfaces and can switch among 
various access networks to achieve ubiquitous service. 
However, 4G networks still face a number of challenges; one 
of them is to select the best access network based on user 
preferences. 
An earlier solution was using Always Best Connected 
(ABC) schemes. ABC enables a user to choose the best 
available access network that best suits his/her needs based 
on receiving signal strength (RSS), cost, quality, security, 
etc. Later on, a new paradigm called Always Best Network 
Connection (ABNC) is presented. ABNC selects an access 
network based on properties of communication session, 
which is composed of both source and destination access 
networks. It has been proved that ABNC indeed works better 
to meet user’s requirements [3] . 
ABNC, however, has a number of deficiencies when it is 
applied for multimedia communications: first, ABNC 
considers only RSS as an index of quality; it does not 
consider other indices, e.g., bandwidth. Second, ABNC does 
not exploit path diversity between the source and the 
destination; it only chooses a path for end-to-end 
communication between two peers. Finally, ABNC only 
considers voice sessions, which only require small 
bandwidth. Thus, ABNC cannot meet the need of 
multimedia communications, which require exchange of 
various media data such as video that needs a large 
bandwidth. Thus, a more comprehensive model than ABNC 
is required for multimedia session services. 
In multimedia communication, multiple connections need 
to be set up between the source and the destination for 
exchange of various media type of data, such as data, audio, 
and video. Besides, many paths may exist between handsets 
with multimode interfaces. Thus, each connection may be set 
up on different path. Therefore, to support multimedia 
services, the new model must allow us to select which path 
or set of paths for connection setup to best meet user’s 
preference. In this paper, we extended ABNC and presented 
a new paradigm called Always Best Multiple Network 
Connections (ABMNC) for multimedia services.  
ABMNC is formulated as a Multiple Attributes Decision 
Making (MADM) problem. The ABMNC decision hierarchy 
chooses a combination of network connections instead of 
each individual connection based on a number of attributes 
such as cost, quality, security, and power consumption. The 
ABMNC decision hierarchy also weights each media type in 
a multimedia service according to its significance in 
communication. To assign a media type on a network 
connection with best communication quality, the media 
assignment problem was formulated as a utility-based 
Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP). Furthermore, to reduce 
the complexity of the MADM and have a reasonable number 
of alternatives, the original MADM hierarchy is decomposed 
into three iterated sub-MADM hierarchies. A novel hybrid 
AHP and SAW scheme was presented to efficiently solve the 
iterative strategy. Finally, an example is used to illustrate 
how ABMNC works.  
In summary, this work has three contributions: A new 
paradigm called ABMNC is defined; a utility-based media 
assignment problem based on the significance of each media 
on multimedia communication is formulated as a MKP

problem; an efficient iterative problem solving scheme that 
integrate SAW, AHP and path selection is presented to solve 
ABMNC.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
summarizes related work. Section III describes and 
formulates the multimedia session selection problem.  
Section IV depicts the proposed methodology, and a hybrid 
scheme of SAW and AHP is presented. An example to 
illustrate ABMNC is given in Section V. Finally, Section VI 
concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK  
 ABC has been extensively studied by a number of 
researchers. The Concept and architecture of ABC are 
described in [4]. V. Gazis et al. [1] formulates the ABC 
problem as a variation of the Knapsack problem with 
multiple knapsacks, and further proved it to be NP-Hard. 
Given a set of flows, [5] formulate ABC as a variant of bin 
packing problem and presents a series of approximation 
algorithms based on First Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithm 
that selects a network to meet user’s Quality of Service 
(QoS) requirements and with maximal admitted flows for a 
user. However, the approach used in [1] addresses the 
problem from a network perspective. What it is maximized is 
the admitted flow, not the user satisfaction. J. Jackson et al. 
[6] intends to achieve ABC over WLAN and WiMAX by 
using a new mechanism to detect QoS support of the 
underlie networks.  
In [7],  both user preferences and attributes of access 
networks were considered, and ABC was formulated as a 
problem of MCDM. A hybrid Analytic Network Process 
(ANP) [8] with RTOPSIS [9] model based on several 
decision making algorithms to select the best candidate 
networks from the user’s perspective is proposed in [10]. It 
solves the rank irregularity problem and eliminates the 
interdependence between criteria. All previous researches in 
ABC focus on source access network selection, which is 
appropriate when a multimode handset is in a standby mode. 
However, when a service session is being set up, ABC is no 
longer efficient as the performance of a service session 
depends not only on the source access network, but also on 
the corresponding access network.   
In [3] , ABNC was proposed. ABNC enables users with 
multimode handsets to select the best network connection for 
a voice session, which consists of source and destination 
access network pair, to satisfy quality constraints and users’ 
preferences. However, when a multimedia session with 
multiple media type and bandwidth requirement is being 
setup, ABNC cannot meet the need.  
III. 
MULTIMEDIA SESSION SELECTION  
 The characteristics of a multimedia session are 
determined by the source and the destination access 
networks. A multimedia session consists of three media 
types: video, voice, and data. The problem of selecting the 
best connection becomes more complicated since a 
configuration or alternative may consist of one or more 
connections and the significance of each media type in 
communication quality must be considered. In this section, 
multimedia session attributes are described first. Then, the 
utility functions for media assignment are presented. Finally, 
the problem of multimedia session selection is formulated. 
Table I shows a summary of notations used in this section.

Utility (quality): Although delay, packet loss rate of 
candidate connections and data rate allocation for 
each medium can be used to measure the quality of a 
multimedia session, we only consider the data rate as 
the quality index. The utility function 
U k
 for 
configuration k  will be defined in the next section. 
The parameter cost, power, and security can be easily 
specified in the user profile but not the utility because the 
available bandwidth of each access network changes 
dynamically. In this study, it is assumed that each 
handset uses an IS service on Media Independent 
Handover (MIH) to report its available access networks 
and their respective available bandwidth [2] . Thus, with 
the assistance from IS, a handset can acquire all needed 
information for network selection. 
B. Utility-Based Media Assignment  
In this section, a utility-based measurement scheme is 
presented to evaluate the quality of multimedia services, 
based on which, the media session assignment is formulated 
as a MKP.  
The design of the utility functions is to strike a balance 
between system utilization and system QoS requirements. 
Let 
U km
be the utility function of a given configuration k for 
some medium m, where
{
,
,
}
m ∈
video voice data
, and is 
defined as follows:

  (1) 
where 
X m
and 
bm
are the allocated and requested BW for 
media m, respectively. wm is the weight for media m which is 
obtained from AHP. Because humans are more sensitive to 
voice (speech) than video, and data is considered the least 
important, the weights for video, voice, and data are: 
>

.  
 
In the ABMNC, the network connection problem is 
modeled as a simplified MKP. In MKP, every path of 
different bandwidth between the caller and callee is 
considered as a bucket of different size. Each medium of 
different bandwidth requirement is considered an object of 
different size that to be included in one of many possible 
buckets. The objective is to assign objects to the available 
buckets such that the maximal utility value can be achieved 
without overflow. Thus, given N different paths, the media 
assignment problem of ABMNC is defined as follows.

C. Problem Formulation 
Given a pair of communicating parties, each is equipped 
with n interfaces. Then, there exist
n2
possible network 
connections between them. A multimedia session contains 
three medium sessions: video, voice, and data session, and 
each can take any one of the connections. Assume one 
medium can pass only on one connection and more than one 
medium can share one connection when the connection has 
sufficient bandwidth. With this assumption, there exist 
2

 possible transmission configurations. So, the 
problem of ABMNC is to choose the best configuration from 
the large number of possible configurations.  
Based on the previous analysis of session attributes, 
choosing the best configuration belongs to a MADM 
problem and can be defined as follows.

The MADM decision hierarchy for ABMNC can be 
shown in Fig. 1. The goal of the hierarchy is to select the 
most suitable configuration k for transmission at the top 
level. Solution alternatives are located at the bottom nodes. 
Video, voice and data are represented as v , s , and d  , 
respectively.  
IV. 
ABMNC 
Applying a simple MADM solution to our problem is not 
feasible because we have to compare a large number of 
alternatives, which makes it impractical for real time 
applications. In the proposed scheme, the original hierarchy 
is decomposed into three iterated sub-MADM hierarchies 
and a hybrid scheme of SAW and AHP is used to efficiently 
solve the problem. AHP is used to decide the relative 
importance of criteria and media, which is then used by 
SAW for scoring. In the hybrid SAW and AHP scheme, each 
sub-MADM rates the path alternatives by considering all 
criteria except utility to produce a partial score first. Then, 
the overall score of a configuration is computed by merging 
the utility value after each media type is assigned.  
 
 
Figure 1.  MADM hierarchy 
 
The MADM hierarchy is divided into the single-path 
sub-MADM hierarchy that takes one path as input, the dual-
path sub-MADM hierarchy that takes two paths, and the tri-
path sub-MADM hierarchy that takes three paths. The 
single-path 
Sub-MADM 
hierarchy 
outputs 
its 
best 
configuration as an input to dual-path Sub-MADM. The 
dual-path Sub-MADM tries to find a better result by 
combining the input best single path with another path. 
Similarly, the tri-path Sub-MADM tries to find an optimal 
configuration that has three paths by integrating the best dual 
path from the dual-path Sub-MADM and another candidate 
path.  Fig.2 shows single-path sub-MADM hierarchy. 
A. AHP Weighting   
In this study, AHP is used because it is easy to 
understand and does not need too much calculation. 
Furthermore, AHP is very convenient to establish a 
mathematical model [12]. AHP can be summarized as the 
process of constructing a problem as a hierarchy with a large 
number of attributes. The first step of AHP is to construct a 
decision hierarchy as shown in Fig.1. Then, pair-wise 
comparison between alternatives for each attribute in each 
hierarchy is done. 
Since our approach deals with multiple media sessions, 
AHP must not only weight criteria or attributes 
c

w p
,
w sl
, 
and
w u
 of our MADM hierarchy, but also weight media

that is used during media 
assignment. Normally, attribute weights are decided 
according to user’s preferences and AHP illustrates how 
important each attribute is by determining the relative 
weights of the compared attributes. 
B. SAW 
SAW is a simple and most often used multiple attribute 
decision technique. The method is based on the weighted 
average. In our research, the overall score of an alternative is 
computed as the weighted sum of all the attribute values. 
SAW classifies criteria into two categories, beneficial and 
non-beneficial. A criterion is beneficial if users are interested 
in having a higher value of it, e.g., security and utility; 
otherwise it is non-beneficial, e.g., cost and power. 
In our study, the parameters used for different access 
technologies are derived as follows: the cost is referred by 
recent ISP charging mechanism, the power consumption, i.e., 
standby time is based on the specifications of some 
representative multimode handsets, and the relative values of 
security level are from some wireless technical reports as 
shown in Table III. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Single-path sub-MADM hierarchy 
 The scale values of 1-9 with calibration is used where 1 
stands for extremely low while 9 represents extremely high. 
Table II shows the scale values, which are assigned to power 
and security. 
V. 
ABMNC EXAMPLE  
In this section, a simple example is shown to illustrate 
how ABMNC works.  
A.  Single-path 
In the example, the source and the corresponding handset 
each have three interfaces, UMTS, WiMAX, and Wi-Fi. 
Thus, there exist 9 candidate network connections for the 
single-path sub-MADM hierarchy as shown in Table V.  
First, AHP is used to elicit the weight for media (wm) as 
shown in Table IV. The voice row shows that voice is twice 
161

as important as video, three times as important as data, and 
equal to itself. The video row shows that the video is twice 
as important as data. The matrix satisfies the transitive 
condition. The Consistency Ratio (CR) is applied to prove 
the matrix is consistency. [13] explains that when the CR of 
the comparison matrix is less than 0.1, a precise result can be 
achieved. Since our CR is equal to 0.0079, it is far below 0.1 
so the matrix is consistent. A comparison matrix is also 
evaluated using Arithmetic Mean of the Normalized Column 
Vectors (AMNCV).  AMNCV is defined as follows:

Second, SAW is used to construct a decision matrix 
based on parameters and scale values, where criteria 
considered are cost, power, and security level. In the un-
normalized decision matrix,
ij
v  represents the original score 
of the j th criterion of the i th alternative. Table V shows the 
scores of all alternative paths in the un-normalized decision 
matrix. 
Third, 
ij
v must be normalized to
ijr , the higher the
ijr , the 
better the alternative performs with respect to the jth 
criterion. Beneficial criterion is normalized by using (5) 
while Non-beneficial criterion is normalized by using (6).

Finally, the best configuration is obtained by comparing

. By applying (7), we get Table 
VI, which shows the partial scores of alternatives without

It can be seen from Table VI that the best alternative is 
S33
(WiFi-WiFi). Intuitively, 
S33
 is the right choice since the 
selection seems cost-preferred without taking utility into 
consideration. Assume the bandwidth of 
S33
 is 90Kbps, the 
media assignment scheme will allocate 64 Kbps, 16 Kbps, 
and 10 Kbps to video, voice, and data, respectively. By 
applying (2), we get the utility of video

 is equal to 0.588 .

TABLE VI.  
PARTIAL SCORE FOR SINGLE-PATH 
 
 
 
B.  Dual-path 
In dual-path, a large number of possible configurations is 
considered. The output of the single-path sub-MADM 
S33
 is 
input to the dual-path sub-MADM, which tries to find the 
best result by combining 
S33
 with another path in order to 
reduce the complexity.  
When considering a dual-path alternative, the normalized 
scores of all 
ij
v must be reevaluated, because the computed 
results will be changed if max (
)
i
v ij
 and min (
)
i
v ij
 change. 
Fortunately, the 
v ij
 with respect to all criteria except utility 
will become smaller for beneficial criteria and larger for non-
beneficial criteria if more paths are involved. Thus, when we 
insert a new dual-path configuration by adding single-path to 
an existing single-path alternative, max (
)
i
v ij
 and min (
)
i
v ij
 
remain the same when utility is not considered. Therefore, 
Table V remains unchanged. 
When the same computations are applied on the dual-
path configuration, the partial score of 
2

 can be 
derived as 0.243 , which is smaller than

. The 
partial scores for dual-path are shown in Table VII.

We assume the bandwidth of
S32
is 90Kbps. Then, the media 
assignment scheme will assign 64 Kbps, 64 Kbps, and 20 
Kbps to video, voice, and data , respectively to
S33
 and 
S32
. 
By applying (2), the utility of video

VI. 
 CONCLUSION 
Multimedia communication has become part of daily live 
for many people. Therefore, how to choose an appropriate 
configuration for a multimedia session between multimode 
handsets is an important issue. In this paper, a new paradigm 
called ABMNC is presented to address this issue. Unlike 
traditional network selection problems, ABMNC is modeled 
as a MADM problem along with media assignment. To 
reduce the size of candidate solutions, the ABMNC MADM 
hierarchy is divided to three Sub-MADMs and an efficient 
hybrid SAW and AHP scheme was proposed to solve the 
problem. An example has been illustrated to show how our 
presented approach works.  
This paper only considered bandwidth as a quality index. 
In the future, we will consider more types of QoS parameters 
like packet loss rate, delay, etc., to make ABMNC more 
practical. Also, each criterion in connection evaluation may 
be correlated. For example, a larger bandwidth may also cost 
more. So, we will use different MADM model other than 
AHP in our future study.
