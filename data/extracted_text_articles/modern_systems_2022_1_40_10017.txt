Abstract— How can we ensure that we do not overload the 
power grid as we use more renewable energy sources, charging 
more electric vehicles and using more home electronics? In this 
paper we will investigate the limitations in the power grid, the 
consequence of using more renewable energy and charging 
more electric vehicles. We will also look into ways that smart 
home technology can make the grid more efficient, and reduce 
the need for infrastructure upgrades.

 INTRODUCTION 
The Nordic Transmission System Operators (TSOs) 
Svenska kraftnät, Statnett, Fingrid and Energinet.dk has 
identified the following challenges for the Nordic power 
system: climate change, development of more Renewable 
Energy Sources (RES), technological development, and a 
common European framework for markets, operation and 
planning [1]. 
Before we continue, renewable energy is according to U.S. 
Energy Information Administration [2]: energy from sources 
that are naturally replenishing but flow-limited: renewable 
resources are virtually inexhaustible in duration, but limited in 
the amount of energy that is available per unit of time. The 
major types of renewable energy sources are: 
• 
Biomass 
o 
Wood and wood waste 
o 
Municipal solid waste 
o 
Landfill gas and biomass 
o 
Ethanol 
o 
Biodiesel 
• 
Hydropower 
• 
Geothermal 
• 
Wind 
• 
Solar 
 
The Nordic power system have experienced trouble during 
cold winter days with high consumption and limited 
generation and transmission capacity. It is easy to predict 
when these conditions will occur, and to implement corrective 
actions. In addition to days with high consumption, the power 
grid may also have hours with low load and high wind 
production. The power system (illustrated in Figure 1) needs 
to keep production at the same level as consumption at all 
times. To be able to do this, flexibility is required. This can be 
used to change the input or output for balancing purposes. 
Irregular renewable production is a main driver to increase the 
flexibility compared to today. Flexibility can be achieved 
through utilizing transmission capacity more efficient, utilize 
information from Automatic Metering System (AMS) to 
further develop demand response and new technology. As the 
world shifts for more renewable energy production, a new 
problem emerges. With some green energy, comes more 
unreliable production and with the increasingly bi-directional 
flow of power, there is a need to update the infrastructure. 
With the emerging number of prosumers (households and 
Electric Vehicles (EV) that consume power from the grid, but 
also produce electricity from their rooftop solar panels or wind 
turbine) installation of smart technology will be required to 
ensure flexibility [3].

The reminder of this paper is organized as follows, Section 
II investigates the current limitations in the power grid. 
Section III investigates the consequences of using more 
renewable energy. Section IV investigates how agents can be 
applied. Section V investigates in to how we can achieve a 
holistic view of challenges. Section VI looks into how smart 
technology can be used for grid   efficiency.  
II. 
CURRENT LIMITATIONS IN THE POWER GRID 
Most of the Norwegian transmission grid is built from 
1950 – 1980 and the last part of the transmission grid 
connecting northern Norway with southern Norway was 
finished in 1994 (see Figure 2). Large parts of the power 
production happens in western Norway and in norther 
Norway, but eastern Norway has the highest consumption 
with limited local production. This is reflected in the 
transmission grid, where the flow of power basically flows 
from west to east and north to south (Figure 3). The 
government sees a need to modernize, restructure and expand 
the capacity in the transmission grid. This is to increase the 
security of supply in some areas, more RES, higher 
consumption in industry and rural areas with population 
growth [4].

III. 
CONSEQUENCE OF USING MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY 
To be able to reduce initial infrastructure cost its 
recommended to exploit the current transmission grid in 
relation to available transmission capacity, so that renewable 
energy production is localized in areas with low capacity or 
areas in need of more capacity. This may mean a more 
geographical distributed development.  
Renewable energy draw power from natural sources; 
solar, wind, ocean, hydroelectric and geothermal. This means 
that it is affected by environmental, seasonal and daily cycles 
that can limit their efficiency. This means that production will 
vary during all hours of the day and be less predictable. 
Because of this there is a need to store the energy, grid energy 
storage. There are multiple ways to store energy depending on 
the source; dammed hydroelectricity, batteries, thermal 
energy storage and mechanical energy storage. Dammed 
hydroelectricity is the largest way to store energy, using both 
conventional hydroelectricity generation and pumped storage 
hydroelectricity. Recent years the research and development 
of battery storage technology has enabled commercially 
viable projects to store energy during periods with low 
consumption and high production. Thermal energy storage is 
another way to store renewable energy using liquids or solid 
materials to store and release thermal energy. Water tanks in 
buildings are a simple example of thermal energy storage 
systems. Storage of energy may give the TSOs and grid 
operators the flexibility and ability to maintain security of 
supply. 
As a consequence of high electricity bills, lower cost for 
solar panels and the security of supply more and more 
consumers become prosumers. Not only do they consume 
power, they also generate their own (Figure 4). 
 
Figure 4. Consumer vs. Prosumer [3]. 
 
The increase in electrical appliances and charging of EVs 
is making some cities experiencing higher peak loads. 
Increasing peak loads will lead to grid enhancements and 
increased cost. Some of this cost may be reduced if local 
generation, batteries or other demand flexibility resources 
reduce the required capacity during peak load hour.

IV. 
APPLICATION OF AGENTS 
The problem domain can be viewed as a system containing  
various agents. The agents and their characteristics can 
change based on the area that’s being researched or analyzed. 
The Energy Hub [20] has made some good examples of this,  
they present all consumers and producers of electricity are 
represented by an agent, connected to a power matching 
auctioneer agent (Figure 5).  
 
The report “NIST Framework and Roadmap for Smart 
Grid Interoperability Standards” written by The National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [16] has useful 
illustrations showing the agents and domains that could exist 
in the problem domain. This is a good basis to understand the 
different stakeholders (Figure 6).

V. 
ACHIEVING A HOLISTIC VIEW OF THE CHALLENGES 
A central approach in Systems Thinking is the holistic 
approach, which looks at the interrelationship between the 
parts in its environment [5]. We want to use this approach, and 
to get a holistic view, we model the problem domain and its 
relationship in a Systemigram. The Systemigram can be seen 
in Figure 7 below, and the full-scale Systemigram can be seen 
in Figure 8 at the end of this paper. From the Systemigram, 
we can see that there are many complex and complicated 
relationships and not individual problems. The Systemigram 
contains many stories, and every story has an unique color, 
and the reading direction is appointed by the arrow. By the 
help of the Systemigram, we get a holistic view of the problem 
domain. This is helpful because, as stated earlier, new 
solutions bring new challenges to the table, but with the 
Systemigram one can get an idea of how the other 
relationships are affected, so one can take precautions and 
make a more robust solution. From the Systemigram we can 
see that there is more than one system in action.

VI. 
USING SMART TECHNOLOGY FOR GRID EFFICIENCY 
In recent years, there has been multiple research projects 
focusing on utilizing smart technology for grid efficiency. The 
focus has been to give TSOs and grid operators the flexibility 
needed to maintain security of supply and minimizing the 
impact on the customers. These research projects have been 
cooperation between different technology companies, grid 
owners and TSO. 
A. NorFLex 
Cooperation between Agder Energi, Statnett, Glitre 
Energi, Mørenett and NODES to develop new technological 
solutions to get a more flexible power consumption [6]. The 
solutions shall contribute to avoid overload in the power grid. 
The goal of the project is to find the smart technological 
solutions for the power grid that smooths out the peak loads 
over the hole day. One of the technologies used in this project 
is smart adapters for panel heaters and smart EV chargers

auctioneer agent [20].

connected to Tibber. Tibber then pooled together the 
flexibility from these two device types in multiple homes and 
offered this aggregated flexibility to the local grid owner 
Agder Energi in an automated process. 
B. Electric vehicles and buildings keep the power grid in 
balance 
This is a cooperation project between Tibber, Entelios and 
Statnett to use electric vehicles and large buildings to maintain 
balance between the production and consumption of electric 
power [7]. Entelios and Tibber are working to deliver 
flexibility from a wide range of technologies. Tibber has now 
contributed flexible power consumption from EVs in Greater 
Oslo, while Enelios has tested automated flexibility from 
electric central heating boilers in industrial, commercial and 
public buildings in the eastern part on Norway, according to 
Statnett. Both research projects conclude that to be able to 
safeguard the supply of power in the future, there is a need for 
smart technological solutions. 
Tibber is currently using smart chargers for electric 
vehicles as load balancer in the real power grid in large scale 
in Sweden as they have moved into the Swedish balancing 
market for frequency containment reserve (FCR), using the 
capacity offered by electric vehicles [8] [18]. 
The U.S. Department of Energy´s Office of Electricity 
states that [9]: “The Smart Grid is not just about utilities and 
technologies; it is about giving you the information and tools 
you need to make choices about your energy use. If you 
already manage activities such as personal banking from your 
home computer, imagine managing your electricity in a 
similar way. A smarter grid will enable an unprecedented level 
of consumer participation. For example, you will no longer 
have to wait for your monthly statement to know how much 
electricity you use. With a smarter grid, you can have a clear 
and timely picture of it. "Smart meters," and other 
mechanisms, will allow you to see how much electricity you 
use, when you use it, and its cost. Combined with real-time 
pricing, this will allow you to save money by using less power 
when electricity is most expensive. While the potential 
benefits of the Smart Grid are usually discussed in terms of 
economics, national security, and renewable energy goals, the 
Smart Grid has the potential to help you save money by 
helping you to manage your electricity use and choose the best 
times to purchase electricity. And you can save even more by 
generating your own power.” 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
Norway is committed to achieving its emission reduction 
target under the Paris Agreement, which sets a target of 
reducing emissions by at least 50% and towards 55% below 
1990 levels by 2030 [10]. Smart Grids are the digitalized and 
smart power grids of the future. They are also essential to 
Norway’s electrification efforts and success with the 
necessary reduction of greenhouse gas emissions [11]. 
Norway, the Nordic countries and the EU are all shifting 
from large, centralized coal- and gas power plants to de-
centralized wind- and sun power plants. It is estimated that 
from 2010 to 2025 the total capacity of wind power is 
quadrupled to 24.000 megawatt, or 22% in the Nordic. The 
most important challenges for the TSO and grid operators is 
to secure a stable power grid. One of the means to ensure this 
is flexibility; the possibility to get industry or households to 
reduce their consumption during peak load hours [12]. 
The Nordic TSOs has published a report “The Way 
forward – Solutions for a changing Nordic power system” 
where they summarize the key solutions that are needed to 
meet the challenges affecting the Nordic power system in the 
period leading up to 2025. One of the key areas is balancing 
the power system, with a new Nordic balancing concept 
called the Modernized Area Control Error (MACE) [13]. 
Compared to ACE control, MACE control utilizes modern IT 
solutions and optimization algorithm, automatic reserves and 
available transmission capacities in order to exchange 
reserves between zones [14]. 
There are multiple research projects underway or finished 
related to the topic we have investigated in this paper. All 
projects conclude that smart technology, used right, gives the 
flexibility needed to help balance the power grid as more RES 
are integrated. Tibber is doing this in Sweden using only 
smart charges for electric vehicles, this can be expanded to 
utilize other smart technology to balance the power and to 
postpone the need for infrastructure updates. The 
implementation Tibber is doing in the Swedish power grid 
can easily be expanded to Norway and Germany where 
Tibber also has established their business [19].
