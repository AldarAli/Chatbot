Abstract – In this paper, we present a metal oxide-based 
hydrogen gas sensor with high sensitivity and short response 
time, operating at room temperature. Our sensors have a 
sandwich-like structure with a thin metal oxide layer in between 
the top and bottom electrode. The electrodes are in a shape of 
long narrow bridges, perpendicular to each other. It has been 
shown that narrowing the top electrode down to ~100 nm causes 
the sensitivity to substantially increase and reduces the response 
time. The sensor response (ratio RAir/RH2) to 1% H2 in synthetic 
air can be as high as ~105 at room temperature, with response 
time of only a few seconds. A theoretical model explaining such 
a behavior is also proposed. The increased sensitivity of sensors 
with narrow top electrode is explained by non-trivial abrupt 
change of the charge carrier transport mechanism from 
thermoemission to electron drift. This change is caused by the 
hot electron temperature instability induced by combination of 
the H2 diffusion profile under the top electrode and high 
intensity of electric field between the electrodes.

 INTRODUCTION 
Pursuit of alternative fuels and energy carriers causes 
hydrogen to attract more and more attention. However, the use 
of hydrogen also brings its safety risks what makes the leak 
detection crucial. Demand for highly sensitive, fast, stable and 
reasonably priced hydrogen gas sensors therefore increases 
[1]. Operation of the chemiresistive MOS gas sensors is based 
on the change of conductivity due to contact with oxidizing 
and reducing gases [2]. Although these devices are already 
being used for years, their further research and improvement 
is possible thanks to development in the field of 
nanotechnology. One of the problematic properties of the 
MOS gas sensors is their relatively high operating 
temperature, usually ranging approximately from 200 to 400 
°C. Heating to such temperatures is undesirable for use in 
hazardous explosive environments and significantly rises the 
power consumption. The work presented here is therefore 
focused on development of highly sensitive metal oxide gas 
sensors operating at room temperature.  
In Section 2, the sample preparation process is described. 
In Section 3, the results of measurements performed on the 
prepared samples are presented and discussed.

SENSOR FABRICATION 
The sensors were prepared as follows: On the sapphire 
substrate, the 100 μm wide and 20 nm thick bottom Pt 
electrode was formed by lift-off photolithography and DC 
(direct current) magnetron sputtering. The 35 nm thick TiO2 
layer was then deposited by DC reactive magnetron 
sputtering. Subsequently the upper Pt electrode (width 
ranging from 100 nm to 1100 nm on different samples) was 
formed on top of the TiO2 layer by DC magnetron sputtering 
followed by electron beam lithography and ion beam etching. 
The whole sensor structure was then annealed at 600 oC for 1 
hour. During the annealing process, the TiO2 crystallizes and 
ohmic contacts are formed at the metal-semiconductor 
interfaces. The TiO2 grain diameter was determined by XRD 
(X-ray diffraction) and AFM (atomic force microscopy) to be 
approximately 10 nm. A sketch of the final sensor profile is 
shown on Figure 1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Responses of the sensors to presence of H2 in technical air 
were measured in a closed chamber in a gas flow regime, with 
possible target gas concentration ranging from 300 ppm to 
10 000 ppm (parts per million) regulated by two Red-y mass 
flow controllers. For wider (over ~300 nm) top electrodes,

the resistance of the sensors was observed to slightly increase 
with the decreasing width of the top electrode due to its 
smaller cross section. However, a steep decrease of the sensor 
resistance at 10000 ppm of H2 was observed for sensors with 
the top electrode width below ~200 nm even at room 
temperature (Figure 2). Response of the sensor (ratio 
RAir/RH2) with 100 nm wide top electrode to 10000 ppm H2 
in synthetic air was higher than ~105. We explain such high 
response of the sensors with narrow (~ 100 nm) top electrode 
by a combination of two effects. First, for such narrow 
electrodes the diffusion length of H2 molecules is large 
enough to create high concentration profile even directly 
under the top electrode and the height of the inter-grain 
energy barriers in this region is decreased. At the same time, 
the intensity of the electric field reaches its maximum in this 
region. Combination of these two effects induces the hot 
electron temperature instability, which will be explained 
further. In general, relation between the temperature of 
electron gas and the temperature of crystal lattice is given by 
the energy balance equation [3] 
𝑘𝑏𝑇𝑒
2
= 𝑘𝑏𝑇
2 + 𝑗𝑒𝐹𝜏𝑒 
where je is the electron current density, F is the electric field 
intensity and τe is the energy relaxation time. The term 𝑗𝑒𝐹𝜏𝑒, 
which represents the electric field induced heating of the 
electron gas, is usually negligible. In our situation, this term 
rises significantly and the electron temperature Te is no more 
equal to the temperature of the crystal lattice T.  
Rise of the electron gas temperature well above the level of 
crystal lattice temperature causes the abrupt change of the 
charge carrier transport mechanism from thermionic 
emission to electron drift [4].  
Problematic is the high resistance of our sensors, which 
reaches values over our measurement limit of ~ 1011 Ohm 
without the presence of hydrogen. This decreases the 
measurable response of such sensors, especially for low H2 
concentrations. A solution for too high resistivity of TiO2 
material has been proposed through doping [5]. To solve this 
problem in our case, sensors with the top electrode consisting 
of many parallel bridges were fabricated. This type of 
electrode is expected to decrease the overall resistance of the 
whole structure and allows us to detect lower concentrations 
of hydrogen. Preliminary results obtained on the sensor of 
this type, with a 500-bridge top electrode, are shown in 
Figure 3.
