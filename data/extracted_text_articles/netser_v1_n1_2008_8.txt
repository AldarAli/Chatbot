Abstract 
 
Traditional 
mobile 
operators 
invested 
huge 
amounts of money in the 1990s to build the current 2G 
wireless networks, like GSM networks in Europe. 
Those networks have proven to be stable. In most 
cases, their capacity has not yet been exhausted. 
Furthermore, the marketing departments of mobile 
operators now consider the commercial possibility of 
selling mobile subscriptions through new channels, 
like supermarkets. The concept of Mobile Virtual 
Network Operator (MVNO) arose. Some of them are 
just new brands and do not own any tele-
communications equipment. Other companies do own 
part of the network: these are the Mobile Virtual 
Network Enablers (MVNE). They provide part of the 
network infrastructure, while the Mobile Virtual 
Network Operators (MVNO) serve end-customers. 
Furthermore, 
in 
the 
context 
of 
international 
globalization, it appears more and more meaningful 
that the same platform in one dedicated country serves 
end-subscribers from several operators in different 
countries. When it comes to service triggering, the 
interactions between three kinds of network are 
critical. These three kinds of networks are: the home 
network, which owns the services’ platform, the host 
network, which actually triggers the platform in the 
home country, and visited networks, where the 
subscriber may roam abroad. The goal of the present 
paper is to study these interactions based on an actual 
implementation example. 
 
Keywords: IN, Service Trigger, MVNO, Multi-
Country, IMS 
 
1. Introduction 
 
We shall focus on signaling issues for triggering a 
Value Added Service (VAS) such as an Intelligent 
Networks (IN) service. The signaling to establish the 
bearer trunk will not be the central focus of this paper; 
instead, we shall concentrate on the signaling for the 
exchanges with the services’ platform. 
We shall assume that the owner of the services’ 
platform like the MVNE has its own Network Sub-
System (NSS), which represents the true Home 
Network. First, it owns the register of its subscribers or 
Home Location Register (HLR). That is, it has the 
freedom for provisioning subscribers. In addition, it 
owns a VAS platform. Finally, it owns a core network, 
including Mobile Switching Centers (MSC) and 
Signaling Transfer Points (STP). For the Radio Access 
Network (RAN) or Base Sub-System (BSS), the 
MVNE relies on a traditional mobile operator defined 
as the Host Network. The fact that the MVNE owns a 
VAS platform means that it has the flexibility to offer 
differentiated services in comparison with other mobile 
networks including the host network. 
A IN prepaid service is a good example of a Value 
Added Service because it contains both: 
1. Originating triggers: a subscriber pays to 
make a call; thus the prepaid service is 
triggered for an outgoing call. 
2. Terminating triggers: a subscriber might pay 
to receive calls: for example when he/she is 
roaming abroad in a Visited Network. For such 
incoming calls, the service is triggered too. 
Like in [1], we shall study first the outgoing and 
terminating case for a single MVNO. To illustrate this, 
we give an implementation example. Then, we tackle 
the Multi-Country topic, which may apply when 
MVNOs are located in different countries, as well as 
when an international operator has affiliates in various 
countries. 
Finally, 
we 
shall 
outline 
what 
the 
interconnections between the home network and 
external networks could look like in the IMS 
architecture. 
Since many acronyms are used, a terminology can 
be found at the end of the paper.

2. Making outgoing calls from the Host 
network 
 
The MVNE does not own its Radio Access Network 
(RAN). Therefore, in the home country a mobile 
subscriber of the virtual operator is first detected by the 
RAN of the host network. The Host Network needs to 
retrieve the subscriber information from the HLR of the 
MVNE. Based on that information, it will trigger the 
VAS platform of the MVNE. 
Through which protocol? The two usual protocols 
for value-added services such as IN services are INAP 
and CAMEL. For interoperability issues, especially in 
the roaming case (see chapter 3) the CAMEL protocol 
might be preferred. CAMEL, sometimes called 
CAMEL Application Part (CAP), as INAP, is built 
over TCAP [2], which is built itself over SS7, and 
therefore CAMEL resp. INAP messages transit through 
the SS7 network by means of Signaling Transfer Points 
(STP). 
If CAMEL is used, the IN platform is triggered as 
illustrated in Figure 1. This applies to voice calls, as 
well as to SMS, in case the latter are charged through 
an SS7-based protocol. 
 
 
The A-party is known in the host network. At 
registration time, the VLR gets the information from 
the HLR of the MVNE about the Originating CAMEL 
Subscription Information (O-CSI) for that subscriber. 
The O-CSI contains, among other things, the SS7 
address or Global Title (GT) of the IN platform 
belonging to the MVNE. The MSC retrieves that 
information in turn from the VLR. Based on that 
information, the MSC of the host network builds and 
forwards the service triggering message to the IN 
platform in the home network. In fact, the message is 
built by the Service Switching Functionality contained 
in the MSC. That functionality is called SSF or 
gsmSSF as described in [3]. The message later transits 
through the STP nodes of the SS7 network. 
In the case of GPRS resp. UMTS networks, the role 
of the MSC consisting in triggering the Value Added 
Service would be played by the SGSN, which would 
contain also an SSF, called this time gprsSSF instead of 
gsmSSF. For more details, the reader can refer to [4]. 
We might call this scenario a “home” call since the 
subscriber is in its home country. However, the call is 
handled partly by the host network. So in reality, it is 
not completely a “home” call. 
When the subscriber moves within the host network 
from one area to another, the VLR corresponding to the 
current area for the subscriber is updated with the 
service triggering information related to the A-party. 
The local MSC retrieves the updated information from 
the VLR and is still able to contact the IN platform in 
order to trigger the Value Added Service. 
The reader who wishes to get more information on 
that topic can refer to the chapter ‘Mobility 
Procedures’ in [5]. 
 
3. Making outgoing calls from a visited 
network 
 
The main reason why the CAMEL protocol is 
preferred is that it is fully standardized. You cannot 
find so many various implementations as with INAP. 
Consequently, while a subscriber is visiting a mobile 
network abroad, the Visited MSC (V-MSC), which 
monitors the call legs, can talk directly through 
CAMEL with the IN Platform of the MVNE. That 
latter provides the instructions for handling the call. 
In CAMEL, there are different subsets of 
capabilities or Phases, where the next phase is a 
superset of the previous one. The actual CAMEL phase 
to handle the call should be the minimal phase 
supported by both the visited MSC and the IN platform 
of the MVNE. For example, if the IN platform supports 
Phase 2, but the visited MSC only supports Phase 1, 
then Phase 1 will be the relevant phase to handle the 
call. 
The IN platform is triggered as illustrated in    
Figure 2. In case data traffic was charged through an 
SS7-based protocol like CAMEL Phase 3, the scenario 
described would still apply. 

93
International Journal On Advances in Networks and Services, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/
 
The IN platform can only be triggered once the A- 
party has been identified as a subscriber of the MVNE. 
When the MVNE subscriber roams abroad, the VLR is 
updated with the O-CSI of that subscriber. From the 
visited VLR, the visited MSC retrieves the GT of the 
IN Platform belonging to the MVNE, so that it can get 
instructions from the IN platform on how to handle the 
call. Once that information is retrieved, the V-MSC can 
monitor the call. The bearer trunk is established 
through the ISUP protocol, from the visited network to 
the host network, which forwards the call to the G-
MSC of the home network. In case the MVNE is 
officially registered at regulatory authorities, and does 
not operate under the umbrella of a well-established 
operator, it can happen that the bearer trunk transits 
directly from the visited network to the home network 
through an international carrier, thus bypassing the host 
network. 
Having a CAMEL dialogue between the visited and 
the home networks means of course that the visited 
MSC has CAMEL capabilities. However, CAMEL is 
not necessarily implemented by all roaming partners, 
and even if it is, it may not be in the right phase. For 
example, in order to play announcements, CAMEL 
Phase 2 is required. And in order to charge data traffic, 
CAMEL Phase 3 is required. Consequently, if the 
visited MSC has only Phase 1 at its disposal, then the 
home network might better control the call itself. For 
that purpose, the control of the call needs to be passed 
over to the home network. We will study how this 
could work in Chapter 4. 
 
4. CAMEL Rerouting 
 
Let us consider the case in which the V-MSC offers 
CAMEL Phase 1, and the control of the call is passed 
over to an MSC in the home network. 
When a subscriber is abroad, the V-MSC takes care 
of all outgoing calls. The V-MSC knows which IN 
platform to trigger when the subscriber tries to make a 
call since the VLR is updated with the O-CSI from the 
HLR of the MVNE. Once triggered, the IN platform of 
the MVNE can instruct the V-MSC to connect the call 
to a dummy destination number belonging to the home 
network. That dummy number could contain a 
sequence number in order to identify the call later. 
When the ISUP ‘Initial Address Message’ (IAM) to set 
up the voice call reaches the G-MSC of the home 
network, the G-MSC could trigger again the IN 
platform of the MVNE. Based on the sequence number 
defined earlier, the IN platform would be able to 
correlate the incoming voice call with the service 
triggering message previously received, and would thus 
take control of the call in this fashion. 
This is illustrated in Figure 3. 
 
 
 
When the G-MSC of the home network triggers the 
IN platform the second time, it can use INAP. It is not 
necessary to use CAMEL anymore since the MSC and 
the IN platform belong to the same network. Therefore, 
the rerouting scenario is also a way to control an 
originating call using INAP. 
There could be also a rerouting scenario for home 
calls between the host network and the home network. 
There would be a first trigger to the IN platform from 
the host network. Later, a second trigger would come 
from the G-MSC of the home network. As the first 
trigger comes necessarily from the host network, INAP 
could be used also in order to trigger the IN platform 
the first time from the host MSC. It would only be a 
matter of agreement between the host and the home 
networks, not with other partners. 
 
5. Receiving calls 
 
In the terminating case, the called number or B-
Party is one of the subscribers of the MVNE, which is 

94
International Journal On Advances in Networks and Services, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/
not necessarily the case for the A-Party. The network, 
where the A-party is located, is called the Interrogating 
Network. For more information on that topic, the reader 
might refer to [3], especially the chapter ‘Architecture’. 
As in the originating case, the G-MSC of the 
interrogating network needs to set up the connection to 
the B-party and get the CAMEL subscription 
information from the HLR of the MVNE. In that case, 
it is not the Originating but the Terminating CAMEL 
Subscription Information (T-CSI). That piece of 
information contains again the GT of the IN platform 
belonging to the MVNE. Consequently, there can be a 
CAMEL dialogue between the G-MSC of the 
interrogating network and the IN platform, as 
illustrated in Figure 4. 
 
 
 
Again, this assumes that the G-MSC has CAMEL 
capabilities and that the supported CAMEL phase is 
sufficient to provide the desired service to the end-
subscriber. 
The host network is involved in the terminating 
scenario, too, since the B-Party, which is a subscriber 
of the MVNE, is seen as belonging to the host network 
by any foreign network. 
In order to avoid the problem with CAMEL 
compatibility, the T-CSI can be disabled in the HLR, 
and the G-MSC of the MVNE can trigger the IN 
platform itself based on the incoming ISUP message to 
set up the voice call, similar to the second trigger in the 
CAMEL re-routing concept. It is possible because the 
bearer trunk will always reach an MSC of the home 
network in the terminating scenario. This is illustrated 
in Figure 5. 
 
 
 
In that case, the terminating call is monitored by the 
G-MSC of the MVNE itself, with instruction from the 
IN platform. 
 
6. Implementation 
 
The 
present 
chapter 
describes 
an 
actual 
implementation of an IN prepaid platform at the 
MVNE Vistream in Germany in 2006. 
 
6.1 Making outgoing calls 
 
For outgoing calls from the host network, CAMEL 
Phase 2 has been used in order to have the capability to 
play announcements to the end-subscriber. 
Here is the log for an Initial DP message, which is 
the initial CAMEL message in order to trigger the IN 
platform: 
 
TRACE: cml!initial_dp_received( 
transaction_id= 1576, 
[...], 
calling_party_number=cml_calling_party_number(

ue,nature_of_address=cmnt_international_number
,numbering_plan_indictator=cmlbnp_isdn,address
_signals=491770381000), 
[...] 
) 
 

95
International Journal On Advances in Networks and Services, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/
Please note that only the transaction identifier, the 
calling party number, called party number, event type 
and MSC address have been kept from the original 
message log. The other parameters have been removed 
for the sake of clarity. 
In the present log, a MVNE subscriber, whose 
number (without Country Code) is 015701234518, 
calls another subscriber from the MVNE, whose 
number is 015701234593. The 01570 prefix is 
characteristic for the MVNE. The present trigger 
relates to the A-party of the call i.e. 015701234518 
since the IN platform has been triggered in Detection 
Point (DP) ‘Collected Info’ in accordance with the 
Basic Call State Model (BCSM) defined in [3]. 
The GT of the MSC, which sent the CAMEL 
message, is an address in the host network: 
491770381000. That piece of information needs to be 
passed over to the IN platform since it is relevant in 
order to rate the call to know whether the call comes 
from abroad or not. If the subscriber were roaming in a 
foreign network, the MSC address would have another 
Country Code other than 49 for Germany, and the call 
would be more expensive for the calling party. 
 
6.2 Receiving calls 
 
For mobile terminating calls, the decision has been 
taken to have the G-MSC of the MVNE triggering the 
IN platform using CAMEL Phase 2. 
Here is the log for an initial DP message: 
 
TRACE: 
CAMEL_PROT_FSM[85874]: 
call_id 
= 
'553658458'  state = 'CML_IDLE'  event = 
'LLS_cml_initial_dp_receivedTyp' 
 
TRACE: cml!initial_dp_received( 
transaction_id=1605, 
[...] 
calling_party_number=cml_calling_party_number(
present=true,nature_of_address=anoa_national_s
ignificant_number,number_incomplete=false,numb
ering_plan_indicator=cmlnp_isdn,presentation_i
ndicator=iapi_allowed,screening_indicator=isi_
network_provided,address_signals=01638080080), 
[...], 
called_party_number=cml_called_party_number(pr
esent=true,nature_of_address=anoa_national_sig
nificant_number,internal_network_number_indica
tor=iini_route_to_number_allowed,numbering_pla
n_indicator=cmlnp_isdn,address_signals=0157012
34518), 
[...], 
event_type_bcsm=cml_p2_event_type_bcsm(present
=true,value=cmlp2etb_term_attempt_authorized), 
[...], 
msc_address=cml_isdn_address_string(present=tr
ue,nature_of_address=cmnt_international_number
,numbering_plan_indictator=cmlbnp_isdn,address
_signals=491570012360), 
[...] 
) 
 
In this example, the GT of the MSC, which sent the 
CAMEL message, is an address from the MVNE: 
491570012360. Again, we recognize the prefix 
(0)1570. The present trigger relates to the incoming 
call for the B-Party: 015701234518 since the DP is 
‘Terminating Attempt Authorized’. The A-Party 
number, 01638080080, is not a number of the MVNE. 
In the case of a Mobile Terminating call, the IN 
platform needs to know the location of the B-Party. If 
the latter were in the home country, the call would most 
probably be free of charge: the subscriber then would 
not need to pay to receive calls in the home country. It 
would certainly not be the case if the B-Party were 
abroad. 
In order to know the location of the B-party, the IN 
platform sends a MAP Any Time Interrogation (ATI) 
message to the HLR. The reader might have a look 
again at Figure 5, and refer to [5] for further 
information. 
Here is an example of an ATI message: 
 
TRACE: mapss7!send_anytime_interrogation( 
[...], 
msisdn=map_v2_isdn_address(present=true,noa=mn
t_international_number,np=mnp_isdn_telephony,d
igits=4915701234518)), 
requested_info=map_requested_info(location_inf
ormation=true,subscriber_state=true,current_lo
cation=false), 
[...] 
) call_id=553658458 
 
This way, the IN platform knows in which country 
the called party is and can rate the call accordingly. 
 
7. Multi-country MVNO 
 
Given that the aim of an MVNE is offering services 
to multiple MVNOs, it can happen that these MVNO 
have different partnerships with mobile network 
operators, thus leading the MVNE home network to 
interface with more than one host network. It is 
especially the case in the context of international 
globalization, where MVNO can be located in different 
countries. One example would be when an international 
supermarket chain with subsidiaries in different 
countries wants to launch parallel MVNO offers. 
For an MVNO located in another country than the 
MVNE, it makes sense that the MVNO relies on a local 
host network, in order to avoid some interconnection 
costs. This makes it necessary for an MVNE to 
interface with multiple host networks. It is represented 
in Figure 6. 

96
International Journal On Advances in Networks and Services, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/
 
 
In the case that two host networks are not located in 
the same country, it can also happen that S2, a 
subscriber of an MVNO relying on Host Network 2 is 
roaming to Host Network 1. This is represented in 
Figure 7. 
 
 
Will the two triggering messages for S1 and S2 be 
different given that they may come from the same SSP 
in the same Host Network, possibly using the same 
protocol? 
 
7.1 MVNO Differentiation 
 
Regarding the originating SSP in the Host Network, 
the SCP is indeed able to identify it. 
The incoming triggering message, which is for 
whatever IN triggering protocol a TCAP message [2], 
provides the following information: 
 
SS7 Protocol 
Available parameter 
TCAP 
Application Context 
SCCP 
Originating GT 
MTP 
Originating PC 
 
Nevertheless, this information depends on the 
originating 
SSP 
only, 
not 
on 
the 
MVNO. 
Consequently, the MVNO distinction cannot be done 
by the “network”, unless it is done at an upper level 
like CAMEL i.e. while the SSP retrieves the 
subscriber-specific application information, which is 
the O-CSI in the case of an outgoing CAMEL trigger. 
Please note that this MVNO differentiation at 
Application level is valid not only when two MVNO 
rely on two hosts networks located in two different 
countries, but also if there are two MVNO relying on 
the same host network in the same country because in 
this case, the triggering information coming from the 
SSP might be the same also. 
If we look at the O-CSI, the following parameters 
are available according to [3]: gsmSCF Address, 
Service Key, Default Call Handling, TDP List, DP 
Criteria, CAMEL Capability Handling. If we do not 
use different gsmSCF addresses (Global Titles) to 
identify in reality the same IN platform, the relevant 
parameter for MVNO differentiation would be the 
Service Key. In other words, MVNO1 would use 
Service Key 1, while MVNO2 would use Service Key 
2 when triggering the IN platform. 
This means that two service instances, triggered by 
two different service keys, would coexist on the SCP. 
Attached to each of the instance, there would be a 
different data set: this can make data configuration 
complex! 
Another 
option 
is 
to 
have 
the 
subscriber 
differentiation not coming from the network, but from 
the SCP: subscriber S1 would be stored in the SCP 
with an MVNO “Identifier” (ID), or “Community” ID, 
or “Class of Service”, or whatever the name is, equal to 
'MVNO1', while subscriber S2 would be stored with 
MVNO_ID 'MVNO2'. Based on the subscriber data on 
the SCP, the service logic, especially the rating, could 
be different. 
Whether data separation relies on a Service Key or 
on an MVNO ID, it is recommended for a service’s 
platform to support data segmentation: MVNO1 should 
have the capability to access or modify its data in a 
secure way, without the risk of access or modification 
by MVNO2.  
 
7.2 Roaming consideration 
 
Nevertheless, the MVNO ID information stored at 
SCP level does not tell whether the subscriber is 
currently roaming or not! If we take the case of 
multiple host networks located in different countries 
but belonging to the same international group, it could 
be an asset to define the same service logic i.e., the 

97
International Journal On Advances in Networks and Services, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/
same service key with variations depending only on the 
originating country and whether the subscriber is 
currently roaming or not. For example, some menu 
options like the call history could be barred to roaming 
subscribers to avoid interconnection fees with the host 
network, but allowed for calls made in the same 
country as the local host network. 
In this case, the MVNO ID would not be sufficient 
anymore, but the Country Code of the Country “where 
the subscriber is not considered as roaming” would be 
required at SCP level too, so that the service logic, by 
comparing this Country Code with the Country Code of 
the originating SSP, knows in the end whether the 
subscriber is indeed roaming. This means that it can be 
an asset for a services’ platform to store the “home” 
country of any subscriber as part of the subscriber data. 
Otherwise, it could make sense to add an additional 
parameter, a kind of “roaming flag”, in the service 
triggering message coming from the network, but this 
would need extending IN protocols. 
Of course, another way to avoid this issue is to 
physically assign a different SCP per MVNO. 
Therefore, if MVNO1 is routed to SCP1, while 
MVNO2 is routed to SCP2 with two different GT, GT1 
and GT2, it is possible to define the “home” country on 
SCP1 as the country of Host Network 1, and differently 
on SCP2 as the country of Host Network 2. It can make 
maintenance easier, since a downtime for MVNO1 on 
the SCP1 machine would have no impact on MVNO2 
which runs on SCP2. However, it means additional 
hardware investment for the MVNO, and this needs to 
be considered in the business case. 
Please note that all these considerations regarding 
the multi-country topic are not relevant only to MVNO, 
but also to any international operator, with affiliates in 
various countries, wishing to store subscribers from 
different countries on the same platform centrally 
located in a specific country. 
 
8. Service triggering in IMS networks 
 
Let us see what the MVNE scenario could look like 
in the IMS architecture. The reader might refer to [6] 
and [7] to get information on the IMS concepts. 
The User Equipment (UE) of the A-party first 
contacts the Proxy Call State Control Function (P-
CSCF) of the visited network, as described in [7] in the 
paragraph ‘Roles of Session Control Functions’. 
Similarly to the V-MSC in the GSM case, the P-CSCF 
sees the subscriber as belonging to the host network 
(instead of the home network) and therefore sends a 
SIP message to the Interrogating Call State Control 
Function (I-CSCF) of the host network. The latter is 
able to make the distinction between its own 
subscribers 
and 
the 
ones 
from 
the 
MVNE. 
Consequently, the SIP message is sent finally to the 
home network. 
It makes sense that the MVNE owns an I-CSCF 
capability. This way, the host network does not need to 
know how the MVNE subscribers are dispatched onto 
the different S-CSCF of the home network. Otherwise, 
the host network needs to be informed every time the 
distribution changes. 
If the I-CSCF belongs to the MVNE, as well as the 
S-CSCF, which corresponds to option 3 in [8], the 
service triggering scenario is described in Figure 8. 
 
 
 
This means that as soon as the MVNE owns 
equipment at Session layer, an originating call resp. 
session is always controlled by an S-CSCF in the home 
network. The Application Server (AS) will never 
control a CSCF in the visited network like a Service 
Control Point (SCP) could do against a visited MSC in 
traditional GSM networks. 
Another option for the MVNE would be that the I-
CSCF and S-CSCF belong to the host network. In other 
words, the MVNE does not own any equipment at 
Session layer, only at Application layer. It corresponds 
to option 1 or 2b or 2c in [8]. 
The service triggering scenario in that case is 
described in Figure 9. 
 

98
International Journal On Advances in Networks and Services, vol 1 no 1, year 2008, http://www.iariajournals.org/networks_and_services/
 
 
Please note that in case SMS or more generally data 
traffic is not charged by means of an SS7-based 
protocol, but by means of an IP-based protocol, like 
Diameter, the triggering scenario would be similar. The 
SMS-C resp. GGSN would forward the charging 
request to an SMS-C resp. GGSN located either in the 
home network or in the host network, depending on 
whether the home network has its own SMS-C resp. 
GGSN. Finally, the home or host SMS-C resp. GGSN 
would start a dialogue with the Application Server. 
 
9. Conclusion 
 
In traditional GSM networks, the interaction 
between a home network and a visited network is a 
known field. It corresponds to the roaming scenario. At 
this point, it has been standardized and implemented 
for years. Through the CAMEL protocol, there can be a 
direct control of a network component in the visited 
network by a services’ platform in the home network. 
With the irruption of the MVNO, which own part of 
the network equipments, the concept of host network 
has been introduced between the visited and the home 
network. However, there can still be control of the 
visited network by the home network with regard to 
value-added services. If there can be multiple host 
networks between the visited and the home network, 
MVNO differentiation must be done at Application 
level. 
In the IMS architecture, which relies on standard IP 
protocols like SIP or Diameter, the component that 
monitors the call resp. session and the services’ 
platform are always within the home network. This is 
valid even in the roaming case, unless the MVNO owns 
only the services’ platform and no equipment at all at 
Session level. Consequently, the interactions between 
the home network and external networks are less 
critical in IMS when it comes to service triggering.
