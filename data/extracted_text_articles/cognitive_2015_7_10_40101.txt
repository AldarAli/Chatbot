Abstract—The more technologies are being developed and used,
the
more
problems
occur
in
many
technical
fields.
Interdisciplinary communication is suitable to solve such
problems. However, the education fostering this approach is
still insufficient. The purpose of this study is to develop an
interface to support the awareness of specialization so that we
provide
an
effective
interdisciplinary
communication
education for participants. Towards this goal, we utilize the
transition of speakers’ specializations following turn-taking
and we define it as “patterns”. To support awareness of
specialization,
this
study
focuses
on
the
rate
at
which
participants recognize other experts’ specialization and specify
the patterns when the awareness of specialization is easy to
obtain. Experiments have been performed on 16 participants
and were analyzed based on quantity and accuracy of the
information to ascertain the effect of the proposed pattern.
Our
results
show
that
the
proposed
pattern
can
give
information at the rate of about 50% and support participants’
recognition of other experts’ specialization. From this result,
the proposed pattern can support participants’ recognition of
other experts’ specialization. Based on this, we propose an
interface that shows when proposed patterns are likely to
create chances to perceive specialization.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, experts’ fields of science technology
have become increasingly subdivided into many areas. By
separating fields, we can encourage the growth of specific
disciplines.
However,
some
problems
accompany
the
subdivision of learning fields; for example, we miss out on a
holistic picture and it becomes more difficult to solve
problems which span more than one technical field. To solve
these
problems,
interdisciplinary
communications
are
becoming more important [1]. For example, in the field of
human / computer interaction, people are developing systems
to improve interaction, not only between humans and
computers, but also among humans. When we develop such
systems, it requires the knowledge of psychology and
sociology to perform practical interactions. In addition, there
are various subjects such as medical science and economics
to be considered. If we focus on such fields, we should not
only investigate relevant studies, but also communicate with
experts in those fields. However, there are few opportunities
to communicate with other fields in a practical way in the
Japanese educational environment. For that reason, it is
thought that interdisciplinary communication education is
insufficient [2].
In such a situation, interdisciplinary discussions are
focused
as
a
method
of
learning
interdisciplinary
communication [3], because interdisciplinary discussion may
function as training for communication with people who
have different specializations. In learning methods by using
discussion, it is important to have interests in the differences
between specializations and to recognize these features. By
examining other expert’s specialization, we better understand
our own research position in academia; by acquiring
different experts’ knowledge and viewpoints, we have the
opportunity to develop new technologies. However, it is
difficult
to
fully
comprehend
other
participants’
specialization in actual interdisciplinary communication.
These difficulties are due to the complexity of the contents of
interdisciplinary
communication
that
have
diverse
participants’ specialization. Moreover, participants must
voice their ideas in discussions; therefore, they cannot focus
fully on paying attention to others’ specialization. In the field
of cognitive psychology, it is known that people cannot
perceive anything which they do not understand [4]. This
way, it is insufficient for people who are not familiar with
interdisciplinary communication to learn it merely by
discussion with experts who have different specialization.
The purpose of this research is supporting the awareness
of specialization for effective learning of interdisciplinary
communication. For that reason, we propose a method to
support awareness of specialization. We utilize the transition
of
speakers’
specialization
following
turn-taking
as
“patterns”, and examine a method to determine the patterns
that make it easier to comprehend other participants’
specialization. We ascertain whether the patterns can help
participants
to
recognize
the
specialization
through
experiments. Based on the result of an experiment, we
propose
an
interface
that
shows
the
timing
when
specialization is apt to be recognized to help participants
recognize the specialization. The rest of the paper is
organized as follows. In Section II, a review of the literature
on related work and the viewpoint of this study are given. In
Section III, we define the elements utilized in this study and
propose the information to support the awareness of
specialization. In Section IV, we describe the experimental
method and the result. In Section V, the proposal of interface
idea is given. In Section VI, a conclusion and future works
are given.

RELATED WORKS
A.
Related works
In
recent
years,
many
studies
have
investigated
interdisciplinary communications. Fujigaki ascertained that
multi
specialized
knowledge
caused
difficulties
in
understanding
each
other
in
interdisciplinary
communication
[5].
She
defined
the
axis
classifying
scientific ideas, analyzed them and proposed a practical
method of knowledge integration to remove the difficulties.
Visualization methods are proposed by many studies to
support
interdisciplinary
communication.
Sumi
et
al.
developed an interface denoting background knowledge that
each participant’s specialization had on a computer display
[6]. They showed it could solve the problems caused by
distance of knowledge. Huub et al. offered ontological
knowledge base and Modeling Support Tools to support the
multidisciplinary modeling process for water management
that
sometimes
lacks
mutual
understanding
between
modeling team members [7]. They showed that tools can
facilitate cooperation in teams. Lisa et al. visualized a
cluster that showed studies’ relationships in interdisciplinary
fields [8]. This study suggested a system intended to reveal
each study’s position and its outline.
We refer to studies about turn-taking. Turn-taking is a
speakers’ exchange system defined by Sacks et al [9]. There
are many studies that use turn-taking to support discussion.
Cao et al. showed that people could smoothly shift the right
to speak by obtaining feedback on turn-taking [10]. Dimicco
et al. created an application that visualizes information
about turn-taking and
speaking time
[11]. From the
investigation, visualization can help participants reconsider
and better understand their interactions from social and
behavioral viewpoints.
B.
View point
In this research, we support recognition of specialization
in
the
discussion
for
learning
interdisciplinary
communication. Therefore, we consider which elements of
discussion
we
should
use
to
support
awareness.
In
discussion, specialization generally appears in participants’
utterances. Moreover, how to represent each specialization
and the contents thereof depends on the speakers’ field of
academic specialization. We define the learning domain that
discussion participants specialize in as their “field.” For
these reasons, we focus on participants’ utterances and
fields.
In addition, we must also consider the discussion’s
features because we selected a learning method that uses
dialog. Discussion consists of interactive utterances by
participants.
In
this
respect,
it
is
the
same
as
interdisciplinary communication. For that reason, we should
study the features relevant to awareness of specialization
from interaction with more than one participant. Therefore,
we focus on turn-taking with regards to recognizing the
characteristics of specialization.
We mentioned turn-taking and fields as elements to
observe. We connect them and treat the transition of
speakers’ specialization following turn-taking. We defined
the transition as a “pattern” and we use it to specify the
timing that governs when participants are easily able to
recognize the specialization. We describe an example of the
pattern. By denoting humanities experts as “H” and science
experts as “S”, if H speaks just after S, we form the pattern
“SH.”
C.
Difference from existing research
In existing research, many methods are proposed for
supporting awareness of specialization. However, these
studies do not refer to participants whose understanding of
interdisciplinary communication is insufficient. There is
some possibility that if those people used the proposed
systems, they could not communicate smoothly and make a
discovery through awareness of specialization. It is not until
those people are educated that they can use the existing
systems. With regard to studies that focused on turn-taking,
those proposed methods are not for learning but rather for
interaction support. This study treats turn-taking as one
element to support the awareness of specialization in group
discussions necessary for interdisciplinary communication
within academia. That distinguishes our study from existing
studies in focusing on basic learning and using it for
interdisciplinary communication.
III.
TOWARD THE SUPPORT OF THE
SPECIALIZATION AWARENESS
A.
Awareness of specialization and turn-taking
It is necessary to define what constitutes “awareness of
specialization”
for
the
purpose
of
interdisciplinary
communication support. Specialization is composed of
education and knowledge that participants have attained;
therefore, the features of specialization are influenced by
which disciplines the participants have learned. When
participants
attempt
to
recognize
other
experts’
specializations, they compare their knowledge with other
experts’
utterances.
Therefore,
what
participants
can
recognize is whether the utterance has specialization from
the viewpoint of their own specialization. For that reason,
this
study
treats
“awareness
of
specialization”
as
“recognizing the features of other specializations,”
We are required to consider a relationship between fields
and specialization because we are focusing on transition
between fields. In Japan, academic fields are often classified
into
two
types:
“Humanities”
and
“Sciences”
[12].
Generally, this classification is based on universities’
departments or high schools’ courses; however, it is difficult
to delineate a clear division. Moreover, there are various
specializations,
and
their
classification
and
each
participant’s understanding of the classification is different.
For that reason, each specialization should be labeled based
on its field to avoid confusion.

Sacks et al. defined turn-taking as consisting of five
rules [9][12]. However, his rules did not stipulate that
participants begin to speak simultaneously or while other
people are speaking. Schegloff [13] and Jisun [14] defined
how turns should be treated when such cases arise.
Accordingly, this study combines Sacks’ Schegloff’s and
Jisun’s rules and defines turn-taking as having seven rules.
This study focuses on awareness of specialization and
pattern;
therefore,
it
is
necessary
to
consider
these
relationships. It is expected that there are easily recognized
patterns
because
specialization
necessarily
reflects
participants’ disciplines and their awareness is based on the
comparison of their own paradigm to other experts’
specializations.
B.
Proposed method
This study defines a “specialization rate” as the rate at
which participants recognize other experts’ specialization.
We estimate the timing which participants will recognize the
specialization
and
inform
them
about
the
timing
to
encourage awareness. For example, if a certain pattern
appears x times and specializations emerge at y times just
behind that pattern, then specialization rate “α” is defined as
in the numerical expression below.
α=y/x
(1)
It can be expected that we can recognize patterns more
easily if the patterns are decided by specialization rate. We
propose a method to obtain such patterns. Specifically, we
classify patterns based on each speaker’s field, derive each
specialization rate, and form a pattern from fields that have
the highest specialization rates. This study defines the pattern
obtained by the above method as the “specialization pattern.”
Moreover,
we
define
the
patterns
that
are
same
as
specialization pattern except one field as the “proximate
patterns.” This study calls for greater attention to awareness
of specialization in subsequent utterances by presenting these
patterns.
We illustrate this point with an example deriving a
pattern composed of three utterances and two fields of
Humanities
and
Sciences.
Hereinafter,
Humanities
are
referred to as “H” and Sciences are referred to as “S.” If
there are N utterances in the discussion, there are N-2
patterns in the same discussion. At first, we divide these
patterns into two types based on first speaker’s field whether
H or S. Second, we calculate each case’s specialization rate
and select the field which has the higher specialization rate.
In the same way, we compose the specialization pattern for
the second and third field. Finally, we define proximate
patterns from the decided pattern. For example, if we get
pattern SSH, the proximate patterns are defined as HSH,
SHH, and SSS.

EXPERIMENT
A.
Purpose
The purpose of the experiment is to gain information
about turn-taking and awareness of specialization and
examine the effect of specialization pattern. Specifically, we
Figure 1. Experiment
derive specialization pattern and proximate patterns and
confirm the rate of the utterance just behind the patterns
containing specialization. From the result, we propose an
interface.
B.
Abbreviations and Acronyms
The purpose of this research is to support recognizing
specialization for interdisciplinary communication learning;
therefore,
it
is
necessary
to
observe
interdisciplinary
discussions. Participants of the experiment should have a
certain amount of knowledge and little experience of
interdisciplinary communication because the candidates for
support are unfamiliar with interdisciplinary discussion. The
classification
of
specialization
uses
“Humanities”
and
“Sciences” which are referred to as “H” and “S” to prevent
confusion. H and S are classified based on Universities’
departments which are familiar in Japan because it is said
that the factor which determines to which fields a person
belongs to is the relevant university’s departments [15][16].
We adopt current topics as the subject for the discussion
because it seems more likely that participants know about
the topics and they have original knowledge of their fields.
It is necessary to obtain information about turn-taking and
awareness of specialization while participants engage in
discussion.
However,
participants
are
unfamiliar
with
interdisciplinary discussion; it is difficult for them to carry
on a discussion and recognize the specialization at the same
time. This study obtains information about turn-taking and
awareness of specialization separately. Participants are able
to focus on discussion while they speak and concentrate on
awareness of specialization while they try to recognize it in
order to get valid data.

Our experimental procedure is shown below.
(I) Interdisciplinary discussion for consensus building
(40 minutes)
(II) Recognizing specialization using the video of (I)
This study obtains turn-taking information in (I) because
turn-taking occurs whenever speakers engage in dialog.
Specifically, we record the order of turn shift in the
discussion and obtain turn-taking information. Information
about awareness of specialization is acquired in (II). This
study gathers information about awareness of specialization
from each participant’s decision. If more than one participant
judged that the utterance was professional, this study treats it
as having specialization. The situation of the experiment is
shown in Figure 1.
D.
Analysis
This study considers the rates at which specialization
became apparently just after specialization pattern and
proximate patterns. We define the rate as the “information
giving rate.” We can get information giving rate “P” as in
the following expression when we define the number of
specializations which participants recognized as Ra and the
number of specializations which participants recognized and
located just after specialization pattern or proximate patterns
as Rs.
 
P = Rs / Ra . 
(2) 
This study proposes two types of patterns to help
participants recognize the specialization. Meanwhile, we can
propose patterns that have high specialization rates. To
compare proposed patterns and such patterns, we derive
specialization rate for each pattern. We get the information
about
how
many
times
each
pattern
appeared
and
participants recognized specialization after each pattern from
our result. After that, we calculate the specialization rate of
each pattern forms this information. We define such patterns
as “higher patterns” and compare their information giving
rate to analyze each pattern’s feature.
The number of higher patterns is equal to the sum total of
specialization pattern and proximate patterns. The number of
utterance composing patterns is three or four. If the number
of utterances is too few, the feature of interaction may be
lost. On the other hand, if the number of utterances are too
many, it may be difficult for participants to comprehend all
of the patterns.

Result
Figure 2 shows specialization rates per patterns that are
composed of three utterances. For example, item SSH
shows the utterance just after the pattern contains the
specialization at the rate of 50%. The number of each
pattern’s appearance is shown as “Number of patterns.”
Specialization pattern is indicated by a black bar and
proximate patterns are depicted by gray bars. As a result, the
utterance just after the specialization pattern contained
specialization at the rate of nearly 40%. Some proximate
patterns matched patterns whose specialization rates are
higher.
Figure 3 shows specialization rates per patterns that are
composed of four utterances. The graph composition is the
same as in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 3, the utterance just
after the specialization pattern contains the specialization at
the rate of nearly 45%. One proximate pattern matched the
pattern whose specialization rate is highest; however, the
others show lower specialization rate patterns.
Figure 4 shows the information giving rates. Black bars
show the rate at the time of presenting specialization pattern
and proximate patterns and gray bars show the rates at the
time of presenting higher patterns. As shown in Figure 4, in
the case of three utterances, there is almost no difference
between presenting specialization pattern and proximate
patterns and presenting higher patterns. In the case of four
utterances, Figure 4 shows presenting specialization pattern
and proximate patterns can produce more information than
presenting higher patterns except for group 4.
F.
Considerlation
Figures 2 and 3 show there is some possibility that the
proposed patterns can present good information from the
perspective of the ease of recognition for every pattern
because some specialization pattern and proximate patterns
matched higher patterns. It appears that the reason some
proximate patterns’ specialization rates were low is the
feature of specialization rates. Specialization rates become
high not only when awareness of specialization transpired
often but also when the patterns seldom appeared. This
problem can be solved by providing more data for every
pattern.
Figure 4 shows that information giving rates are
influenced by the number of utterances that composes
patterns. This result shows the possibility that we can
change the amount of the information provided. It is
necessary to provide a suitable quantity of information in
accordance with the students’ skill level. If the quantity of
information is too high, participants may be confused. On
the other hand, if the information is too scarce, the nature of
the support system may be lost. We have confirmed that the
proposed method can flexibly educate participants by
changing the number of utterances that compose the
relevant composing patterns. From this result, we can use
the method proposing specialization pattern and proximate
patterns
for
education
support
using
awareness
of
specialization.
Moreover, Figure 4 shows specialization patterns and
proximate patterns can transmit more information except in
the case of group 2 of three utterances and group 4 of four
utterances. This result shows that high specialization rate
patterns cannot always give a great deal of information. One
of the reasons for the result is same as the reason that
proposed patterns did not match higher patterns. In other
words, the cause is features of specialization rate. As in the
other case, higher patterns that have been derived from all
groups’ data do not always match the patterns that have
been derived from each group’s data. This result shows that
the
proposed
patterns
can
produce
highly
adaptable
information.
In summary, these considerations show that if we can
gather appropriate data, the proposed patterns can produce
patterns that have a high specialization rate. Moreover, the
proposed patterns can become a good support method under
the same conditions. On the other hand, when the number of
utterances which composes patterns is increased, proximate
patterns’ specialization rate and information giving rate
decrease. This result shows that if we focus on more
utterances, the number of patterns increases and awareness
of specialization may diverge accordingly. In consequence,
each pattern’s specialization rate and information giving rate
may be reduced. This phenomenon would occur when the
number of fields is increased because this result is linked to
an increase in the number of patterns. This study focuses on
helping
participants
unfamiliar
with
interdisciplinary
discussion recognize the specialization; therefore, this study
presupposes that the case in which there are too many
patterns is not in effect.
Meanwhile, there is a question of whether support
interface is really necessary because participants recognized
specialization
in
this
experiment.
This
study
gathers
information
about
turn-taking
and
awareness
of
specialization
separately;
however,
discussion
and
awareness
should
be
performed
at
the
same
time.
Participants
who
are
unfamiliar
with
interdisciplinary
communication
do
not
always
perform
these
tasks
simultaneously.
Moreover,
even
if
one
participant
recognized specialization, the others might not be able to
recognize the specialization. From these viewpoints, a
support interface is needed.
V.
TOWARD INTERFACE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
A.
Proposing interface design
This
study
shows
that
specialization
pattern
and
proximate patterns can indicate patterns that have a high
specialization rate with some accuracy. We propose an
interface to help participants recognize the specialization
based on the experiment result. Specifically, we propose the
interface that calls participants attention to recognize the
147

specialization when utterance that includes specialization
appears. We describe a detailed method.

Store
the
information
about
turn-taking
and
awareness of specialization that were gathered from
this experiment and other discussions in a database.

Derive specialization pattern by using stored data
and information from the present discussion.

Propose
that
the
next
utterance
may
have
specialization to participants if the present pattern
matches proposal patterns.
These methods give participants a stronger chance to
recognize whether some utterances have specialization and
make this awareness easier. Figure 5 shows our proposition
for the design of such an interface.
Moreover, this interface can give information to not only
participants but also facilitators. Participants can recognize
the
specialization
from
the
information
through
the
facilitators.
B.
The subject towards interface development
We describe the subject to develop the interface. At first,
there is a problem with the data limitation. This study gets
information
from
the
discussion
composed
of
2
H
participants and 2 S participants; however, the number of
participant and participants’ field ratio is not always the
same. This interface can be applied to the case when these
elements change though we need information about turn-
taking and awareness of specialization from the other
elements of discussions. We need more experiments to
expand the useful range of our interface.
Second, there is a problem of how we determine the
number of utterances that compose a specialization pattern.
Figure 4 shows each case of information giving rate;
however, the standard number of utterances that should be
used remains indeterminate. This study focuses on three and
four utterances; however, it is possible to increase the
number
of utterances
unless
the
number
of patterns
increases too much. Therefore, it is necessary to consider
the relationship between the standard of participants’ skill
level and the number of utterances that composes patterns to
determine which information to give them.
C.
Future works and subjects
The goal of this study is to develop an interface that is
able to give all requisite information about awareness of
specialization and help participants to be aware of and
recognize it more readily. It seems that participants can get
knowledge about the diversity of other participants’ way of
thinking
and
field
and
learn
interdisciplinary
communication through awareness of specialization by
using such a system.
There are some obstacles to achieving this goal at
present.
(i) Not all participants can recognize the specialization
when information is presented.
(ii) Fields’ classification and definition are very limited.
(iii) Classification is not applicable to all discussions.
This section considers how to solve these problems. First,
we focus on (i). This study leaves the decision of whether
utterances have specialization to participants; no matter how
well developed the system becomes, not all participant will
be able to recognize the specialization when information is
given. It is possible to make participants recognize the
specialization by analyzing the contents of utterances to
show more exactly timing. However, if this system provides
more detailed information, there is a possibility that
participants cannot learn spontaneous awareness. It is
necessary to consider how far we should provide support.
Second, we focus on (ii). As mentioned in Section III-A,
the standards of fields’ classification are based on Japanese
universities’ departments; therefore, it is unclear whether
the proposed method can perform in foreign countries’
educational environments. Moreover, this study presumes
participants have only one specialization; however many
experts have more than one specialization. It is necessary to
examine
the
effect
of
this
method
based
on
field
classifications considered common in the pertinent country
and consider what happens when participants have multi
specialization. We forecast that the effect of this method
does not change when the fields’ classification changes
unless the number of classification is increase. In addition, it
is expected that multi-specialized experts recognize more
specialization than other participants and their specialization
is easy to recognize.
Finally, we focus on (iii). Not all interdisciplinary
discussion can separated in H and S. For example,
discussions
between
Engineering
experts
and
medical
experts
is
considered
as
interdisciplinary
discussion;
however, these fields both belong S in this study’s
classification of fields. In that case, this method is not able
to support participants; therefore, it is necessary to confirm
whether the method can support participants in other
systems of classifying fields. Moreover, if this method will
be
usable,
we
need
new
training
data
with
a
new
classification to derive the proposed pattern.

VI.
CONCLUSION
This
study
was
aimed
to
support
awareness
of
specialization
in
group
discussion
for
learning
interdisciplinary communication. Toward the goal, we
proposed providing information based on transition of
speakers’ specialization following turn-taking as “pattern”.
We focused on when the pattern by which participants tend
to recognize the specialization appears. We defined such
patterns as “specialization pattern” and “proximate patterns”
and examined whether these patterns can help participants
to recognize the specialization. The result showed that, if we
choose an appropriate number of utterances and have
suitable data, specialization pattern and proximate patterns
can
help
participants
recognize
the
specialization
in
interdisciplinary discussion. We proposed an interface that
indicates when specialization might appear in the next
utterance when specialization pattern or proximate patterns
appeared.
The proposed interface can be adapted to specific groups
at the present. Further discussion is needed to gather
information
about
turn-taking
and
awareness
of
specialization. Moreover, it is necessary to develop the
interface
to
examine
the
effect
of
interdisciplinary
communication
learning
through
recognition
of
specialization.

We want to express special thanks to the students of the
