contextualisation and symbolic representation of worldwide
Holocene-prehistoric
volcanological
features
and
discovery
of
archaeological
settlement
infrastructures,
especially
for
prehistoric contexts and context discovery. The research is based

I.
INTRODUCTION
This paper is an extended and updated presentation of
new research results, based on the research, publication, and
presentation at the GEOProcessing 2023 conference in Venice,
Italy [1].
The theoretical and practical developments of this ongoing
research are one group of six impactful research endeavors
selected worldwide for the 2023 Hyperion Research spe-
cial report on recent High-Performance Computing (HPC)
centric AI success stories [2] (AI, “Artiﬁcial Intelligence”).
The special report emphasises the epistemologically relevant
methodological fundament ‘The Conceptual Knowledge Ref-
erence Implementation’ (CKRI) and ‘The Component Refer-
ence Implementations framework’ (CRI), providing sustainable
standard component groups for implementation.
Due to the large number of inquiries and far-reaching
interests from scientiﬁc disciplines and public regarding multi-
disciplinary contextualisation cases employing the created in-
ventory, we take the chance that this extended paper can con-
centrate on the practical application of the inventory, showing a
wider range of new survey and on-site result groups of archae-
ological settlement infrastructures and insights based on prac-
tical conceptual facets used for on-demand contextualisation
and symbolic representation. The entirety of provided methods
enables an advanced, consistent multi-disciplinary conceptual
knowledge contextualisation, especially universal knowledge
facets, method integration, ﬂexible workﬂow deﬁnition, and
parallelisation on HPC resources.
Both, the ongoing research on the epistemological [3] and
the components base [4] and its implementations were pub-
lished and demonstrated at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory (LLNL) [5].
This publication includes the new survey results and refer-
ences to on-site results of archaeological settlement infrastruc-
tures and Holocene-prehistoric volcanological features based
on methodological contextualisation. The historico-cultural
contexts span several continents.
The goal of contextualisation especially targets prehistoric
contexts worldwide, identifying and integrating archaeological,
prehistoric objects with objects from other scientiﬁc disciplines
on equal footing, promoting a coherent multi-disciplinary
conceptual methodological approach. The methodological goal
of this research is the creation of practical and sustainable
knowledge-based methods and tool sets, which provide solid
means for sustainable long-term research. The methods and
sets of tools should provide standardised components, which
can be continuously further developed and adopted to future
research questions and targets. The research targets ﬂexible
context processing, integration, and representation, which in-
cludes further development of knowledge resources, visuali-
sation, and chorological and chronological views for analysis,
interpretation, decision making, and new insight.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Sections II and
III present the implementations of and conceptual knowledge
with all required references including all technical aspects.
Section IV provides the all respective components and ref-
erences used for implementation. Section V delivers results
for an excerpt of four scenarios. Sections VI and VII discuss
case scenarios and summarise lessons learned, conclusions,
and future work.

KNOWLEDGE AND COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATIONS
Two major practical reference implementations were de-
ployed for full implementations, realisations, and continuous

further developments: the new versions of the prehistory-
protohistory and archaeology CKRI [3] and the CRI frame-
work [4] for conceptual knowledge-based context integra-
tion, complements processing, and geoscientiﬁc visualisation.
CKRI provides the knowledge framework, including multi-
disciplinary contexts of natural sciences and humanities [6].
CRI provides the required component groups and components
for the implementation and realisation of all the procedural
modules.
The reference implementations are based on the fundamental
methodology of knowledge complements [7], considering that
many facets of knowledge, including prehistory, need to be
continuously acquired and reviewed [8]. Creating contextu-
alisation requires to coherently integrate multi-disciplinary
knowledge and to enable symbolic representations. Realisa-
tions need to integrate a wide range of components as required
from participating disciplines, e.g., for dynamical processing,
geoprocessing, spatial contextualisation. The capabilities and
features of both reference implementations are huge. The
individual characteristics and features of the components are
explained in detail in the cited publications and the referenced
documentation of the components. The materials also already
include thousands of examples and applications. Here, we will
assume these fundaments to be known and concentrate on the
newly achieved survey results of archaeological settlement in-
frastructures and Holocene-prehistoric volcanological features.
III.
CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE IMPLEMENTATION
Implementations and realisations are based on the CKRI
reference implementation [9], and respective contextualisation.
References are capable to integrate required context. Besides
the core scope of this knowledge-focussed research on prehis-
toric, archaeological, and geoscientiﬁc questions, procedural
complements are employed and extended via the CRI frame
reference implementations [10]. Both provide sustainable fun-
daments for highest levels of reproducibility and standardisa-
tion.
Many aspects of knowledge [11], including meaning, can be
described using knowledge complements supporting a modern
deﬁnition of knowledge [12] and subsequent component instru-
mentation, e.g., considering factual, conceptual, procedural,
metacognitive, and structural knowledge. Complements are
a means of understanding and targeting new insight, e.g.,
enabling advanced contextualisation, integration, analysis, syn-
thesis, innovation, prospection, and documentation. Regarding
knowledge, it should be taken for granted, that scientiﬁc
members of any disciplines nowadays continuously practice
and train themselves in development and practical employment
of methods, algorithms, and components as required by their
disciplines and keep track with how to integrate methods.
A. Coherent Conceptual Knowledge Implementation
Universally coherent multi-disciplinary conceptual knowl-
edge is implemented via the CKRI [9], demonstrated with
Universal Decimal Classiﬁcation (UDC) [13] code references,
spanning the main tables [14], based on science and knowledge
organisation [15], [16], as shown in Table I. The verbal
descriptions of the references are already available in more
than ﬁfty languages. Here, verbal descriptions are given in
English language (en) as is. Any factual content in the verbal
descriptions can be deliberately modiﬁed and re-assigned if
descriptions should be used in a procedure. Consistent multi-
disciplinary conceptual knowledge is demonstrated via UDC
code references spanning auxiliary tables [16].

COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATIONS
A. Resulting Methodological Component Integration
Integration components, reﬂecting standards and sustainable
modules are based on the major groups of the CRI. The CRI
framework is provided in development stage edition E.0.3.9.
The ten major CRI component groups are:
1)
Conceptual knowledge frameworks.
2)
Conceptual knowledge base.
3)
Integration of scientiﬁc reference frameworks.
4)
Formalisation.
5)
Methodologies and workﬂows integration.
6)
Prehistory knowledge resources.
7)
Natural sciences knowledge resources.
8)
Inherent representation groups.
9)
Scientiﬁc context parametrisation.
10)
Structures and symbolic representation.
All parts were realised based on CRI components, with realisa-
tions fully referenced in the following sections. The groups are
numbered for clearly addressing that these components and the
understanding of their functional requirements and also their
technical background are precondition for own knowledge-
centric implementations and realisations.
1)
The conceptual knowledge was realised for all disci-
plines via the CKRI conceptual knowledge framework
[9] and operations (Table III). CKRI is demonstrated
with UDC [13] references. For demonstration, CKRI
references are illustrated via the multi-lingual UDC
summary [13] released by the UDC Consortium, Cre-
ative Commons licence [17].
2)
Relevant scientiﬁc practices, frameworks, and standards
from disciplines and contexts are integrated with the
Knowledge Resources (KR), e.g., here details regarding
volcanological features, chronologies, spatial informa-
tion, and Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) [18]. Cor-
responding coherent complementary results and details
on faceting are available for a whole inventory of
volcanological features groups [3].
3)
All integration components, for all disciplines, require
an explicit and continuous formalisation [19] process.
The formalisation includes computation model support,
e.g., parallelisation standards, OpenMP [20], Reg Exp
patterns, e.g., Perl Compatible Regular Expressions
(PCRE) [21]. Here, common scale of entities for pri-
mary objects is 103 and for secondary objects 104–105.
Processing operations [22] were parallelised for pri-
mary (n1) features groups with respective instances. For
production, all components were implemented under
Linux on multi-core systems and showed very efﬁcient,
both for OpenMP and GNU Parallel (GNU, Gnu’s Not
Unix).
4)
Methodologies for creating and utilising methods in-
clude model processing, remote sensing, spatial map-
ping, high information densities, and visualisation. Re-
spective contextualisation for scenarios in prehistory
should be done under conditions especially reﬂecting
state-of-the-art methods, e.g., spatial operations, trian-
gulation, gradient computation, and projection.
5)
The symbolic representation of the contextualisation
can be done with a wide range of methods, algorithms,
and available components, e.g., implemented here via
LX Professional Scientiﬁc Content-Context-Suite (LX
PSCC Suite) deploying the Generic Mapping Tools
(GMT) [22] for visualisation.
6)
Prehistoric objects and contexts are taken from The Pre-
history and Archaeology Knowledge Archive (PAKA),
which is in continuous development for more than
three decades [23], released by DIMF [24]. Collabora-
tive interfaces, e.g., The Archaeological Data Collector
(ADC) [25], were developed and established for archae-
ological survey contributions and are used for ongoing
data integration and analysis.

7)
Several coherent systems of major natural sciences’
context object groups from KR realisations have been
implemented, especially KR focussing on volcanologi-
cal features [18] deployed with in depth contextualisa-
tion and with a wide range [13] of contexts [26] and
structures [27] [28].
8)
The contextualisation solution can employ state-of-the-
art results from many disciplines, e.g., context from
the natural sciences resources, integrating their inher-
ent representation and common utilisation, e.g., points,
polygons, lines, and spatial techniques and standards.
Here, resources are Digital Elevation Models (DEM),
High Resolution (HR) (Space) Shuttle Radar Topog-
raphy Mission (SRTM) [29] data fusion [30], HR
Digital Chart of the World (DCW) [31], and Global
Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography
(GSHHG) [32].
9)
Scientiﬁc context parametrisation of prehistoric tar-
gets can use the overall insight from all disciplines,
e.g., parametrising algorithms and creating palaeoland-
scapes.
10)
Structure is an organisation of interrelated entities in a
material or non-material object or system [27]. Here,
relevant examples of sustainable implementations are
NetCDF [33] based standards, including advanced fea-
tures, hybrid structure integration, and parallel comput-
ing support (PnetCDF).
Overall, all parts of the solution were implemented and
realised via these components. Especially, GMT modules were
deployed for select procedures together with PCRE and Perl
ﬁlters. Spatial distance dependencies of objects and conditional
decision criteria were realised via GMT geodesic calculation,
which is very accurate using the Vincenty algorithm [34].
V.
SCENARIOS, IMPLEMENTATIONS AND RESULTS
The results for a multi-disciplinary case scenario from
the current research with full practical implementations for
four primary case instances were chosen, Holocene-prehistoric
volcanological features of strato volcanoes, maars, subglacial
volcanoes, and submarine volcanoes (CKRI: UDC:511.2...), with
geospherical calculations on a global scale and context dis-
covery with coherently classiﬁed archaeological settlement
infrastructure instances (CKRI: UDC:711....,692,903,902,...) in geo-
spherical radii of 300 km spatial distance from primary objects.
A. Methodological Approach
The method can be summarised as follows.
•
Selection of KR, components, primary and secondary
object types, symbolic representation, ...
•
Conceptual knowledge assignment.
•
Selection of chronological properties.
•
Selection of primary objects.
•
Selection of secondary objects.
•
Calculation of secondary objects’ geospherical spatial
distances.
•
Parallelisation of conceptual knowledge processing.
•
Parametrisation of symbolic representation.
•
Parallelisation of context data processing.
•
Visualisation processing.
•
(Further development of resources and implementations
by the speciﬁc disciplines.)
In new applications, all steps and items should be carefully
and intentionally addressed for any intelligent employment,
depending on the research questions and contexts.
B. Resulting Context Groups
An excerpt of the four primary context groups and criteria
(α,
β ,
γ , and
δ ) and contextualisation of archaeological
settlement infrastructures is shown in (Table IV). The primary
decision criteria (n1) include conceptual context, feature ob-
ject type, chronology, and position. The secondary decision
criteria (n2) include conceptual context, prehistoric object
type, chronology, position, and conditional geospherical spatial
distance depending on respective primary objects.

Prehistoric object groups include all available language

object group deﬁnes the spatial projection for consecutive
primary groups. Each of these primary groups is contextualised
for all of the secondary object groups.
C. Resulting Context Discovery Matrices
Table V shows an excerpt of the result matrix of Holocene-
prehistoric volcanological features groups and respective

facets, namely conceptual knowledge, chronology, and chorol-
ogy for the four scenarios (α,
β , γ , and δ in Table IV).
The result matrix includes conceptual knowledge view
groups [13] based on CKRI references [9], factual knowl-
edge from the KR objects, respective Country Codes (CC),
and further Associated Context Data (ACD), e.g., symbolic
representations of national ﬂags.
Context example references for the features groups facets
show Prehistoric Volcanic Activity (PVA), Historic Volcanic
Activity (HVA), and Continued Volcanic Activity (CVA), e.g.,
latent volcanic activity. PVA are consequence of the Holocene-
prehistoric chronological contextualisation for all objects in
the resulting volcanological features groups. Cases for which
further facts are holding true can also allow past-prehistoric
contextualisation, e.g., with HVA and CVA.
Four instances each are further discussed for the primary
scenarios. Contextualisation for instances is done regarding
resulting settlement infrastructures. Instances are named 1 ,
2 , 3 , 4 . Resulting context discovery matrices for primary
case instances of the scenario for multi-disciplinary contex-
tualisation of settlements are given in Tables VI and VII.
Instances α, β , γ , and δ refer to Table IV. Figure 1 shows
a corresponding visualisation of the calculation results of the
context discovery for the ﬁrst two instances.
The corresponding visualisation of the calculation results
of the context discovery for consecutive instances three and
four are given in Figure 2. Overall we have sixteen groups in
this example as we select four primary with four secondary
groups each. By consequently following the methodological
approach does have the beneﬁt of being consistent regarding
multi-disciplinary conceptual knowledge, e.g., when integrat-
ing volcanological features and archaeological settlement in-
frastructures. The targets can also be modiﬁed by switching
primary and secondary groups and by selecting different object
groups. Applying such systematical implementations for the
realisation of individual methods for case scenarios can deliver
new factual answers to different research questions.
VI.
DISCUSSION OF CASE SCENARIO RESULTS
The next sections discuss result we regard relevant from the
methodological, historico-cultural, and educational domains.
A. Methodological Domain
Implementation and realisation provide a seamlessly coher-
ent multi-disciplinary conceptual knowledge contextualisation
for the case scenario and its instances. The context discovery
result matrices (Tables VI, VII, VIII, and IX) for all instances
α,
β , γ , and δ refer to n2 in Table IV. Especially, these
secondary object groups include objects from Middle Neolithic
(MN) to at least Late Iron Age (LIA), including ages in
between, e.g., Bronze Age. Auxiliaries of time support various
concepts and include geological, archaeological, and cultural
time divisions, spanning from the Precambrian Supereon over
the Archaean to the Palaeolithic over the Neolithic and to
historical times. Mechanisms allow ﬂexible extensions and
facets, e.g., ‘zoic’ and ‘phytic’ references. Therefore, the
Holocene-prehistoric scenarios, besides their high quantities
and complexities, comprise just a small subset of cases.
The objects groups comprise all types of settlement infras-
tructures, e.g., Celtic ramparts, Viereckschanzen (VS), earth-
works –commonly square, four corner ramparts–, and middens
with settlement contexts.
The resulting group of strato volcanoes aligns along
0 ◦ / 360 ◦ longitude (Figure 1). An appropriate Transverse
Mercator projection was chosen in order to minimise the
distortion along a respective meridian for the generation of
the primary results of strato volcanoes and results for other
consecutive, secondary, contextualised volcanological features,
e.g., maars, subglacial and submarine volcanoes.
The CRI framework components were employed for all
steps, including knowledge organisation, conceptual and spa-
tial calculation, and visualisation. Primary objects, strato vol-
cano (medium green volcano symbol), maars (light green
volcano symbol), subglacial volcano (light cyan volcano sym-
bol), and submarine volcano (cyan volcano symbol), are
marked as well as resulting secondary objects, settlements
(blue rectangular symbols), all in their precise georeferenced
position. Resulting conceptual knowledge is given for these
objects. Resulting sums of secondary discovery objects were
calculated.
Each case scenario can be dynamically contextualised with
coherent multi-disciplinary knowledge, as demonstrated for
geosciences, prehistory, and archaeology, e.g., referring to pre-
historic object properties and excavation results and targeting
new insight from geoscientiﬁc and multi-disciplinary context
integration.
Any resulting contextualisation matrices and coherent con-
ceptual and facetted knowledge can further be input to con-
secutive contextualisation processes. The more, solutions with
individual methods and workﬂows can be created for countless
different questions and situations.
B. Historico-cultural Domain
The methodological approach to the cases delivers a series
of new context-chorology results for our four scenarios:
Alpha-scenario: maximum numbers of archaeological set-
tlement infrastructures in surrounding areas of strato
volcanoes near the zero longitude are located in Japan,
followed by Iceland, and the Azores, Portugal.
Beta-scenario: maximum numbers of archaeological settle-
ment infrastructures in surrounding areas of maars under
alpha-dependence conditions are located in the Eifel,
Germany, followed by Chile, and Indonesia.
Gamma-scenario: maximum numbers of archaeological set-
tlement infrastructures in surrounding areas of subglacial
volcanoes under alpha-dependence conditions are lo-
cated in Iceland and Canada.
Delta-scenario: maximum numbers of archaeological settle-
ment infrastructures in surrounding areas of submarine
volcanoes under alpha-dependence conditions are lo-
cated in Italy and Iceland.
Integrated analysis: The methodological approach to the
cases delivers further new results beyond the primary context
groups, based on the large scale and on-site surveys. We see
that the scenarios are interrelated on a knowledge level. The
results form intermediate matrices from the KR, which can be
used for further fact-based analysis, for which we just give
some starting examples.

The density of archaeological settlement infrastructures in
the Eifel, Germany, is far highest. This area marks the southern
margin of the North European Plain. The prehistoric extension
of the North European Plain was several times larger than
today.
Nevertheless, the Eifel also marks the southern margin of
known occurrences of volcanological features in the periphery
of the North European Plain during human presence in the
prehistoric North European Plain in at least more than the last
700,000 years [35].
The resulting ﬁndings also show prevalent concentrations
of archaeologically relevant settlement infrastructures in close
proximity of otherwise historico-culturally used areas with
high concentrations of volcanological feature groups with a
wide diversity of volcanological features.
This is especially relevant for the settlement infrastructure

results on Iceland, which show uniquely high concentration of
settlement placements in a range of three volcanological fea-
ture groups, next to a diversity of strato volcanoes, subglacial
volcanoes, and submarine volcanoes. The analysis results
quantify and qualify the important role of these locations for
ancient society, may it be have been for logistics, economy, and
strategic purposes. The spatial density of the settlement can
be suggested in this map scale but we have seen the detailed
results in Tables VI, VIII, VII, and IX.
Further relevant context result from ﬁndings of prehistoric
coast lines, especially for the prehistoric North European
Plain. Factual prehistoric evidence in the prehistoric catch-
ment ares of the North European Plain proves that ﬁndings
concentrations date far back beyond Holocene, e.g., in Eng-
land / Scotland so far 700,000 a to 500,000 a B.C.E (B.C.E.,
Before Common Era) for ﬂint artefacts [35] and currently
known 8,000 a to 7,800 a B.C.E. for post-built mesolithic
houses [36] of post-glacial European societies. A large number
of prehistoric settlements should still be waiting discovery and
analysis in the prehistoric North European Plain, most of them
in what are now submarine areas.
The results of the analysis in these scenarios enable us to
further contextualise with physical and non-physical contexts
supported by participating disciplines, e.g., targeting prehis-
toric use of resources and materials, ritual and symbolic corre-
lations. Therefore, examples of object groups include ﬁndings
of ﬂint, obsidian, and basalt objects and material sources on
the one hand and symbolic and mythological contexts on the
other hand.
Regarding this long-term research, further ﬁndings from
multi-disciplinary scientiﬁc endeavors are ongoing matter of
research and contextualisation, especially pedology and soil
condition results, bog and swamp related results, pre-modern
mobility ﬁndings, ﬁndings on open ﬁeld names and site names,
coast lines, ﬁndings on materials of non-volcanic and volcanic
origin, ﬂint, obsidian, and basalt, and further volcanological

results, seismological results, and evidences of earthquakes and
natural disasters in prehistoric times.
The knowledge resources associate context, e.g., from the
fact that obsidian formation is associated with felsic lava and
contains higher percentages of lighter elements, especially,
Si, Al, Na, K, O (silicon, aluminium, sodium, potassium,
oxygen). This makes it distinct from ﬂint and basalt and allows
historico-cultural contextualisations, e.g., origins of resources,
travel, transport, and trade.
An example of multi-disciplinary contextualisation are fac-
tual results on pre-modern infrastructures, e.g., various pre-
modern trackway systems, often wooden structures, are widely
spread in several areas of interest, especially in the North
European Plain, dating back older than 4,500 a B.C.E. [24],
[37] [38] [39]. This is an example where results and insights
–as often presented [40]– could beneﬁt from a consequent
scientiﬁc multi-disciplinary factual contextualisation in order
to encounter non-factual approaches and perception.
C. Lessons Learned on Complexity and Educational Aspects
The methodology enables to manage a high grade of
complexity and employ complexity for the creation of new
insights. The methodological approach enables to even coher-
ently contextualise symbolic, non-physical contexts of physical
object groups by integrating new methods for procedural and
conceptual knowledge complements, e.g., The Abydos Ships
Method, a new insight-driven numeral systems approach for
coherent multi-disciplinary analysis and contextualisation of
object groups and their contexts [41].
The approach of methodological coherent multi-disciplinary
contextualisation is what truly earns the term ‘Artiﬁcial Instru-
ments’. As all the ‘technical’ details are published and laid
out in the given documentation of the components we have
to explicitly emphasise that here a technical and unknowingly
applied approach should not be considered a solution. This
is just an optional consecutive stage of implementation and
realisation as shown with the contextualisation here.
Contrary to an instrument approach, recently, researchers
of some disciplines commented in personal communication
that the motivation they use ‘Artiﬁcial Intelligence’ is that
they do not want to lose the overview in their disciplines and
respective contexts and because they want to get on in complex
situations. This shows very limited engagements, shufﬂed
views, and perspectives in some disciplines and is made an
easy choice fostered by parts of the non-scientiﬁc world,

by legal visions, and industry focus and is clearly not what
we should want, especially not in science. Besides unfunded
claims and neologisms, relevant fundamental principles have
not changed, e.g., Turing machines [42], Busy Beaver test [43],
and machine unintelligence [44]. It is for sure, these principles,
logic, and consequences will prevail true, even in future.
The given conditions for determination and analysis of this
scenario are independent from the symbolic representation,
e.g., the visualisation. For example, the speciﬁcation of a radius
inside which we analyse archaeological settlement infrastruc-
tures does not represent archaeological object distributions.
It is a common premise that researchers understand how to
specify their research questions and how to describe and use
their methods, premises, and relevant logic.
Therefore, from our experiences, it is recommended to
include information science fundaments, e.g., epistemology
and logic, during all stages of educational processes of all
disciplines and to practice multi-disciplinary approaches. Com-
prehensive studies of the works of the classical Organon [45]
[46] [47] [48] [49] and understanding of logical fallacies [50]
can be most beneﬁcial as starting points. Further, a few years
of practical experience in employing the component groups in
complex scenarios will also be helpful.
VII.
CONCLUSION
This publication on extended research presented the new
survey and methodological analysis results on coherent multi-
disciplinary contextualisation and symbolic representation of
worldwide Holocene-prehistoric volcanological features and
discovery of archaeological settlement infrastructures, espe-
cially for prehistoric contexts and context discovery.
The research is based on the employment of contextualisa-
tion reference implementation and component frameworks for
coherent multi-disciplinary conceptual knowledge-spatial con-
text discovery, CKRI, which enable to implement conceptual
multi-disciplinary coherency and a high level of consistency –
keys for fact-based analysis and context correlation.
The practical realisations achieved their goals and proved
efﬁcient and sustainable over the long-term research and de-
velopment of more than three decades. The case scenarios for
context discovery of archaeological settlement infrastructures
for Holocene-prehistoric volcanological features resulted in
valuable contextualisation potential and possible new insight
from on multi-disciplinary scenarios. The scenarios should
have implicitly demonstrated that solely technical and proce-
dural approaches are not sufﬁcient.

identiﬁed and assigned during the contextualisation processes.
An excerpt of complements relevant for this case scenario
are CKRI classiﬁcation, position data, calculation algorithms,
content structures, and parametrisation experiences.
The methods and reference implementations can be efﬁ-
ciently and effectively employed for practical implementations
and realisations for multi-disciplinary research, especially in
prehistory, archaeology, natural sciences, and humanities. The
solutions provide countless facilities and modules for adopting
to individual solutions.
Future research will address archaeological settlement in-
frastructures and further object groups and new models for
their coherent multi-disciplinary contextualisation based on
continuous developments of the reference implementations and
knowledge resources. Further, contextualisation and analysis
of object groups will be matter of future advanced large scale
scenarios, site surveys, and campaigns in prehistory and ar-
chaeology, targeting fact-based analysis and historico-cultural
contexts. Projects will include ongoing multi-disciplinary in-
vestigations, e.g., context artefacts, pedological properties, soil
characteristics, and pre-modern transport and mobility. The
creation of new methods will include further integration and
processing of knowledge complements, georeferencing, spatial
and satellite data processing.
