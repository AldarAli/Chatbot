Abstract—The technological chain of precise tuning of 
magnetic properties of amorphous microwires has been 
established for the first time. The main elements of chain are 
the chemical composition, geometrical proportions, thermal 
annealing, mechanical stress and crossed magnetic fields. The 
relevance and importance of the establishment of the tuning 
chain is determined by the wide application of magnetic 
microwires is magnetic sensors.  
Keywords-Soft magnetic materials; Amorphous magnetic 
wires; Magneto-optic Kerr effect.

 INTRODUCTION 
Amorphous magnetic wires present a number of 
properties suitable for technical applications, such as giant 
magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect or magnetic bistability 
associated with fast domain wall propagation [1]–[4]. 
Amorphous magnetic wires are also important when using 
new 
highly 
accurate 
switching 
sensing 
devices. 
Consequently, various types of magnetic wires have been 
widely investigated during last years [1]–[9].  
Our study was directed to select the essential properties 
to establish a repeatable control of the key technological 
parameters of magnetic microwires. We recognized that, at 
each steps of the chain, we change and manipulate the 
limited number of the properties. Therefore, by increasing 
the number of the elements of the technological chain, we 
make the magneto-electric system of the microwire more 
predictable.   
The main idea of our work is the presentation of the 
technological chain providing the tuning of the basic 
properties of glass covered microwires. Preliminary, we 
selected microwire samples with different compositions and 
geometry to establish in the best way the each step of the 
process chain.  
The structure of the paper is the following: Section II is 
devoted to the experimental details, Section III – to the 
composition and annealing, Section IV – influence of torsion 
stress, Section V – influence of crossed magnetic field, 
Section VI – conclusions.  
II. 
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
The study of the magnetization reversal in the surface of 
microwires has been performed by means of the optical 
polarizing microscopy working in reflective mode using the 
longitudinal 
magneto-optical 
Kerr 
effect 
(MOKE) 
configuration [10] [11]. The surface hysteresis loops were 
obtained from the MOKE intensity for different values of 
the external magnetic field applied in the axial direction 
(Hax) as a result of the MOKE images processing [10].  
A pair of Helmholtz coils provided an axial magnetic 
field Hax. The circular magnetic field was originated by the 
electric current flowing along the microwire. The 
mechanical torsion stress has been applied. While one of the 
wire ends was mechanically fixed the second end was rotary 
stressed to apply the stress with different angle.  
Samples annealing has been performed in a conventional 
furnace below the crystallization temperature and Curie 
temperature. All the thermal treatments were performed in 
air because metallic nucleus is coated by the insulating and 
continuous glass coating. The microwire was heated, 
annealed and slowly cooled with the furnace under the 
tensile stress. 
Bulk hysteresis loops have been measured by flux-metric 
method. We represent the normalized magnetization, M/Ms 
as a function of the axial magnetic field, H, where M is the 
magnetic moment at given magnetic field and Ms is the 
magnetic moment of the sample at the maximum magnetic 
field amplitude. We measured the dependence of the 
impedance, Z, and GMI ratio, ΔZ/Z, on the magnetic field 
by using specially designed micro-strip sample holder 
placed inside a sufficiently long solenoid that creates a 
homogeneous magnetic field. ZMAX is the value of the 
impedance measured when the axial magnetic field H was 
maximal.

COMPOSITION AND ANNEALING 
The selection of nominal composition and the conditions 
of the thermal annealing are the basic steps of technological 
chain. At the first step of the technological route, we 
demonstrate the role of the microwire composition. Taking

into account that the Co-based and Fe-based wires (that is, a 
wire in which the Co or Fe content is maximal relative to 
other chemical elements) are the main elements of the wire-
based sensors we selected the following samples: 
Co69.16Fe4.1B11.81Si13.84Cr1.09 with metallic nucleus diameter 
d=25,6 µm and total diameter D=30,2 µm (sample I)  and 
Fe65B15Si15C5 with d=30 µm and D=34,4 µm (sample II). 
The sample II was annealed in the presence of tensile stress.  
 Figure 1 shows the magnetic hysteresis loops (Fig. 1a)) 
and GMI dependencies (Fig. 1b)) of the sample I while the 
Figure 2 presents the experimental dependencies obtained in 
the sample II.  
The magnetic behaviour is different for these microwires. 
The magnetization reversal in the as-cast sample I reflects 
the magnetization rotation contribution while as-cast sample 
II demonstrates the magnetic bistability. The annealing 
process reverses the picture: the annealed sample I becomes 
magnetically bistable while the annealed sample II looses 
the bistability.  
 
 
Figure 1.  a) bulk hysteresis loops and b) GMI of as-cast and annealed 
microwire obtained in sample I.  
The annealing influences in the opposite manner on the 
GMI effect in two studied samples (Figs. 1b and 2b). For 
Co-rich wire, the GMI (Fig. 1b)) of annealed microwire is 
basically lower than of the as-cast sample [12]. It is 
associated with to the axial magnetic anisotropy induced by 
the thermal annealing.  
 
 
Figure 2.  a) bulk hysteresis loops and b) GMI of as-cast and annealed 
microwire obtained in sample II.  
The wire annealed in the presence of the tensile stress 
demonstrates the rectangular hysteresis loop (Fig. 1a) 
normally 
observed 
in 
the 
wires 
with 
positive 
magnetostriction constant. For Fe-rich wire, the increase of 
GMI ratio (Fig. 2b)) is related to the partial crystallization 
and change of sign of the magnetostriction constant [13]. 
The annealing in the presence of stress is related to stress 
relaxation and considerable effect of internal stresses on 
magnetostriction [14] [15]. We assume that the stress 
relaxation 
induced 
by 
annealing 
can 
change 
the 
magnetostriction sign. On the other, hand under applying 
stresses we can reduce the magnetostriction constant.  
IV. 
TORSION STRESS  
Here, we present the influence of the torsion stress on the 
magnetization reversal. First, we have demonstrated that the 
magnetization reversal in the surface of the wire repeats the 
magnetization reversal in the volume both for as-cast and 
annealed samples. Figure 3 presents the longitudinal MOKE 
hysteresis loops for the as-cast and annealed sample I. The 
shape of these curves coincides with the shape of magnetic 
hysteresis (Fig. 1a)).  
  Applying the torsion stress we have demonstrated the 
possibility of the transformation of the hysteresis of type a) 
to the hysteresis of type b).

Figure 3.  Surface MOKE hysteresis loops obtained in a) as-cast sample I, 
b) annealed sample I.  
  Taking into account the importance of thermal stability of 
the sensors operation, we could remark the following. 
Generally, the hysteresis loop consists of fluent rotation of 
the magnetization and sharp jumps. The relation between 
these two parts of magnetization reversal depends on the 
temperature. In some wires this effect is observed even 
when approaching only 50 OC.  
  Figure 4 shows the stress induced transformation of the 
MOKE hysteresis of the as-cast sample I. In the presence of 
the stress, the jump of the magnetization appears and 
increases. In such a way, the hysteresis loop takes the shape 
of the annealed wire (Fig. 3b). The evident jumps of the 
surface magnetization are observed in the presence of the 
high torsion stress (the curve with “star” points in the Fig. 
4).  
V. 
CROSSED MAGNETIC FIELD 
The final step of the tuning is the application of the 
crossed magnetic field. Figure 5 shows the MOKE 
dependencies on circular magnetic field with the presence of 
DC axial magnetic field acted as an external parameter.  
Without the axial field the jump between two circularly 
magnetized states takes place (line with rectangular black 
points). The DC axial magnetic field moves the hysteresis 
loop along the circular field axis. The direction and the 
value of the shift depend definitely on the sign and the value 
of the axial field. This shift reflects the change of the angle 
of helicality of surface magnetic structure.

stress of different value in as cast sample I.

process obtained in a circular field in the presence of DC axial field HAX. 
Sample I.  
The angle between the circular axis of the wire and 
surface magnetization changes in the presence of axial filed. 
In such a way, the angle of surface helical structure is 
smoothly and reversibly adjusted by the DC axial field. This 
fine tuning of the helical structure is considered as a key 
method of the control of GMI sensor because the applied 
experimental configuration of “circular field + DC axial 
field” is totally coincide with the field configuration of the 
GMI sensors.  
VI. 
CONCLUSIONS 
The technical chain of the adjustment of the magnetic and 
electric properties of magnetic microwire for sensor 
application is demonstrated. The un-reversible elements of 
the chain are the chemical composition, geometric metal-
glass proportion and the thermal treatment. The reversible 
units necessary for the fine tuning are the mechanical stress,

in particular torsion stress, and the vector sum of crossed 
circular and axial magnetic fields. 
Creation of such type of chains extends the possibility of 
the control of the main properties of microwires permitting 
the realization of the predicted parameters of magnetic 
sensors. The main parameters which could be predicted are 
the frequency and magnetic field ranges of the stable 
operation of sensors. Also the range of the sensitivity to 
external stresses and the level of stress saturation could be 
determined.  
The disadvantage of the proposed scenario is the 
impossibility of the creation of the universal chain. Different 
types of the microwires need different elements of the 
technical chain.
