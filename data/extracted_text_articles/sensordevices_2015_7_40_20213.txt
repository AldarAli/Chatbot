Abstract—This paper focuses on scientific issues related to 
new application of GPS in radar networks that use the effect of 
Forward Scattering (FS) of electromagnetic waves to detect and 
estimate targets on their GPS radio shadows. The aim of the 
paper is to describe the experimental study of GPS radio shadows 
of different objects irradiated by GPS signals and to develop a 
possible algorithm for signal processing of the radio shadows of 
objects. Registration of FS-GPS radio shadows from moving 
targets is performed using a small commercial GPS antenna and 
the stationary receiver. Topology of the experiment meets the 
requirements for the appearance of the FS effect. The results 
presented in this article show that from FS-GPS radio shadows of 
different objects can be extracted information about the 
parameters of the object including size, speed and direction of 
movement, distance to the receiver. The information extracted 
from FS-GPS radio shadows of objects can be used in different 
applications including radio barriers, security, classification and 
identification of moving and stationary objects. 
Keywords—FS effect; GPS; detection and estimation 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The main idea is that radio shadows contain valuable 
information about the objects that can be used to improve the 
performance of systems with secondary application of wireless 
technologies. These are FS passive bistatic positioning systems 
based on radio communication or radio navigation systems, in 
particular the GPS system. It is normal situation when in 
conditions of radio shadow of the object these passive radio 
systems lose the object. When the object is close to the line 
between the transmitter and the receiver, the receiver loses the 
reradiated signal from the object (radio shadow). Forward 
Scatter GPS (FS-GPS) radio shadows formed by different 
moving objects are investigated in this article. The occurrence 
of FS radio shadow is the essential physical phenomenon, 
which can be used to extract some useful information about 
the objects that generate it. 
Forward Scattering Radar operates in the narrow area of the 
forward scattering effect where the bistatic angle is close to 
1800, and the target moves near the transmitter-receiver 
baseline (Fig. 1) [1]. In forward scatter radar (FSR), the 
forward scattering effect can be modeled using the Babinet's 
principle. The Babinet principle says “A plane absorbing 
screen of limited dimensions may be replaced by a 
complementary infinite plane screen with an aperture shaped 
exactly like the original screen (the complementary screen has 
openings where the original screen is closed and vice versa. 
The incident field diffracted at the aperture gives rise to the 
field coinciding with the shadow field of the original absorbing 
screen, (except for the sign)”. 
Due to the forward scattering effect, the Radar Cross 
Section (RCS) of targets extremely increases (by 2-3 orders) 
and mainly depends on the target’s physical cross section and 
is independent of the target’s surface shape and the absorbing 
coating on the surface. The use of GPS signals in a passive 
radar system is very popular as an alternative to traditional 
radar systems. The idea to apply a GPS L1 receiver to FSR for 
air target detection is discussed in [2]. Some experimental 
results of a GPS L1 receiver concerning the detection of air 
targets are shown and discussed in [3]. A possible algorithm 
for air target detection in a GPS L5-based FSR system is 
described in [4], and the detection probability characteristics 
are calculated in [5] in case of low-flying and poorly 
maneuverable air targets in the urban interference environment. 
GPS L1 FSR system for detection of FSR shadows of 
stationary ground objects is studied in [6][7]. Target detection 
is indicated if the signal integrated from some satellites exceeds 
a predetermined threshold. 
In this paper, a passive FSR system where GPS satellites 
are exploited as non-cooperative transmitters is studied. The 
aim of this study is to verify the possibility to detect FS shadow 
of moving ground targets when GPS satellites are located at 
small elevation angles. The experimental scenario includes 
moving targets and stationary-based FS-GPS system that 
registers FS shadow of ground moving targets. The 
experimental results obtained can be used for the design of 
software applications to a GPS receiver that could measure 
traffic movement, target velocity and target classification. 
The paper is structured as follows. In Section I, the 
principle of passive Forward Scattering Radar together with its 
application to FS GPS system is described. In Section II, the 
description of the experiment with FS GPS system in urban 
conditions is done. Section III describes the basic stages of 
signal processing for detection and parameter estimation of 
moving targets using their FS radio shadows. In Section IV, the

experimental results obtained in result the experiment are 
discussed.    
II. FSR EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION 
The experimental scenario includes targets that are moving 
into two directions and a stationary-based FS-GPS system that 
registers FS shadow formed by the moving targets (Figure 1). 
The GPS receiver is positioned at one side of the road.  
 
 
Figure 1.  GPS-GSR topology 
The purpose of the experiments is to verify that with a 
small and omnidirectional commercial GPS antenna it is 
possible to register differences in FS-GPS shadows of moving 
targets depending on their size and velocity, and also to verify 
whether the differences in the FS-GPS shadows allows 
classifying the objects (Figure 2). 
 
Figure 2.  Experimental equipment 
The paper considers one experimental scenario that 
includes a stationary-based FS-GPS system that records FS 
shadows formed by cars moving on the road (Figure 2). During 
the experiment, the conditions for the occurrence of the FS-
GPS effect have been guaranteed. In the experiment, the GPS 
receiver is positioned from the one side of the road and records 
the signal from GPS satellites. The signals are recorded from 
such visible satellites that are located at low elevation angles 
and when a baseline between satellite and receiver is 
perpendicular to the road, in order to meet the requirement for 
the occurrence of the FS effect. During the experiment, the 
satellite signals are recorded when cars move on the road. The 
objects passing on the road have different dimensions (cars, 
vans, buses, trucks, pedestrian etc.). The purpose of these 
experiments is to check whether the type of the registrated FS 
shadows depends not only on the dimensions of the object, but 
on the speed of the moving targets as well. The dependence of 
FS-GPS radio shadows on the size and speed of the marine 
targets registered by the coastal FSR is firstly shown in [1].  
III. SIGNAL PROCESSING 
The general block-scheme of a possible algorithm for 
FS_GPS shadow detection is shown in Figure 3. According to 
this block-scheme, several visible GPS satellites are acquired 
and tracked over the complete duration of recorded signals. 
Here, we consider the case when the acquisition and 
tracking algorithms of a GPS receiver are implemented in 
MATLAB. According to the block-scheme shown in Figure 3, 
the squared values of the In-phase component at the output of 
the Code&Carrier tracking block are then filtered by means of 
the Moving Average Filter with the jumping window. This 
filter divides the input signal into non-overlapping intervals 
(jumping windows) of size N milliseconds and calculates the 
average of samples (integrates) in each interval. This filter not 
only improves the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the detector 
input but reduces the number of signal samples as well. Target 
detection is indicated if the filtered signal exceeds a 
predetermined threshold H. The Constant False Alarm Rate 
(CFAR) processor firstly detect single samples and then counts 
them using a binary nonparametric procedure for detection of 
sample packages of unknown length, with the decision rule 
“M/N–L”, in order to estimate their unknown length. The 
estimated sample package length is proportional to the linear 
dimension of the target. Next, using the CFAR processor, we 
use the same approach for estimation of the other target 
characteristics in the frequency domain. In that way we obtain 
two important parameters of moving targets – energy and 
frequency. The obtained target signature can be used for 
estimation of various target parameters in the time and 
frequency domains. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. The general block-sheme of signal processing in a FS GPS system 
The CFAR processing is a very important procedure, which 
is very often used especially in real systems, because it allows 
maintaining the required false alarm rate at the detector output 
using the adaptive threshold. Next, the extracted target 
signatures can be used to estimate different target parameters 
for their classifications. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The GPS receiver is positioned at the one side of the road, 
at the height of 1 m from the ground (Figure 2 and Figure 4). 
The street has four lanes each with the width of 3m, two in one 
direction. A high building is located on the west of the receiver,

so the GPS receiver receives signals only from the GPS 
satellites on the east. 
 
Figure 4. Experiment scenario  
During the experiment, several cars move at velocity of 
about 20 - 30 km/h relative to the GPS receiver. The 
constellation of the visible satellites is shown in Figure 5. It can 
be seen that during this experiment only four satellites are 
visible (7, 10, 13 and 28), one of which with the number 13 
creates the best conditions for the occurrence of the FS effect.

Figure 5. Satellite constellation 
This satellite is located most low on the horizon, the 
bistatic angle between the satellite and receiver is close to 180 
degrees, and the car crosses the baseline "satellite - receiver" 
at the angle of about 90 degrees. The signals from this satellite 
can be used for detection of the FS-GPS shadow created by 
targets. The squared in-phase components at the output of the 
Carrier&Code tracking block are recorded for four satellites 
(7, 10, 13 and 28) and further filtered by means of the MAF 
with the moving window of size 200ms. The FS-GPS radio 
shadows obtained from satellites 7, 10, 13 and 28 are shown in 
Figure 6. Satellites 7 and 10 are located also low on the 
horizon, but in their case the car crosses the baseline “satellite-
receiver” at an angle different from 90o. These satellites do not 
meet the requirements for the occurrence of the FS effect. For 
that reason the signals received from these satellites cannot be 
used for detection of the FS shadows created by cars. The 
satellite 28 is located high above the horizon, which worsens 
the conditions of the occurrence of the FS effect and the FS 
shadow is small. It is so because the direction of propagation 
of the signals from the satellite is not orthogonal with respect 
to the cross section of the vehicle.

Figure 7. Filtered signal from satellite 7 
This figure shows that cars passing near to the receiver 
have the deepest FS radio shadow (about 8-10 dB). Moreover, 
the size, the depth and the form of the shadow could serve as 
information for the development of GPS software applications 
- for determination of the car velocity and for traffic control. 
Using the multi-level threshold procedure, it is possible to 
determine the distance to the vehicle.  The shape of the 
shadow (the first peak) can be used to determine the direction 
of travel of the vehicle. So, in this way the selection and 
classification of vehicles can be realized. The parameters of 
the FS_GPS radio shadow (width and depth) can be used for 
classification of the type of vehicle. The FS-GPS radio 
shadowsare shown in Figure 8 -  for five cars and the van and 
in Figure 9 – for the car and the bus. Figures 8 and 9 show that 
the FS-GPS shadow parameters can be used to classify 
different moving targets. For example, the longer the vehicle, 
the deeper his radio shadow. The radio shadow width is 
proportional to the length of the vehicle and his speed of 
movement. The FS-GPS shadows shown in Figures 8 and 9 
are formed by the vehicles moving at almost the same speed of 
20-30 km/h.

Figure 10. Power spectrum (bus, car and pedestrian) 
In  this study, it is observed that the FS-GPS shadow depth 
is proportional to the distance from the object to the receiver. 
The smaller this distance, the greater the FS-GPS shadow 
depth. The greater this distance, the smaller the FS-GPS 
shadow depth. As mentioned above, the road where the study 
is realized has four lanes, two in one direction. Figures 8 and 
9also show that the FS-GPS shadow depth in each successive 
lane of the road is differed by about 2 dB. The length of the 
car is 4 m, of the van - 6 m, of the bus -12m. Applying the 
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or the Welch method 
(PWELCH) to the filtered signals from different targets, we 
obtained the corresponding power spectra (Figure 10). Figure 
10 shows that the power spectrum reduces to the level of -40 
dB at the frequency of 15 Hz – for the human and at the 
frequency of 20-30 Hz –for the car and the bus.  
V. CONCLUSIONS 
It is shown that it is possible to detect different objects on 
their FS-GPS shadows using a small commercial GPS antenna 
and the software-defined GPS receiver. Topology of the 
experiment meets the requirements for the occurrence of the 
FS effect. This means that the satellite and the GPS receiver 
are located on the same line, which crosses the object. 
Experiments show that the FS-GPS shadow can provide 
information about the object including size, speed, direction of 
movement, and the distance to the receiver. This information 
can be extracted from the width, shape and length of the FS-
GPS shadows. The occurrence of FS shadow is essential 
physical phenomenon, which can be used to extract some 
useful information about the objects that create it. The 
information obtained can be used in various applications 
including radar, radio barriers, security, classification and 
identification of moving and stationary objects.
