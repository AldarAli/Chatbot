Abstract—In this paper, we evaluate other features different
from the waveforms to classify seismic sources. Classiﬁcation
of sources of the deep moonquakes is an important issue for
analyzing the focal mechanisms and the lunar deep structures.
It was found that deep moonquakes that occur from the same
source have similar waveforms. Some studies have been conducted
to identify the deep moonquake sources using the waveform
similarities. However, classifying some deep moonquakes using
only the waveforms is difﬁcult due to large noise and the small
amplitude. If we could show that other features different from
the waveforms are effective for classiﬁcation of deep moonquakes,
we can increase the number of classiﬁable moonquakes even if
moonquakes include noise and small amplitude of the waveforms.
Therefore, we use other features to classify deep moonquakes
(position and velocity relative to the Earth, Sun, Jupiter, and
Venus, as seen from the Moon). We apply these features to classify
deep moonquakes that are not classiﬁed based on only waveforms,
and it is useful to analyze the deep moonquake occurrence
mechanisms. Our experiments showed that the position and
velocity relation between the Moon and the Earth or Jupiter
are effective for classiﬁcation.

INTRODUCTION
The Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP)
was deployed on the Moon to investigate the lunar surface, in-
ternal structure and surrounding environment through NASA’s
Apollo missions. The Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE) in the
ALSEP has been performed to observe the lunar seismicity.
The observations revealed that seismic events called moon-
quakes occur on the Moon. All observed data are acquired
and viewed on the Web [1] [2]. The moonquake data are very
important to analyze the lunar internal structure and the focal
mechanisms of moonquakes, even after 40 years since PSE
ﬁnished [3] [4].
Earlier studies have revealed that moonquake character-
istics differ widely from those of earthquakes. For instance,
contrary to earthquakes, moonquakes do not occur due to
plate tectonics. Additionally, moonquakes have several types:
’Deep Moonquakes’, ’Shallow Moonquakes’, ’Thermal’, and
’Meteoroid Impact’, which are classiﬁed based on the oc-
currence factor or depth of seismic sources. About 13,000
events have been found to date including about 7,300 deep
moonquakes, about 30 shallow moonquakes, and about 1,700
meteoroid impacts. Deep moonquakes account for over half of
all moonquakes.
Deep moonquakes that occurred from the same source
are similar waveforms [5] [6]. Earlier studies have classiﬁed
deep moonquakes based on the similarities [7] (sources of
deep moonquakes are labeled as Axx e.g., A1, A6, A200.).
The purpose of this study is the classiﬁcation of unclassiﬁed
deep moonquakes to elucidate the deep moonquake focal
mechanisms. Goto et al. [8] classiﬁed deep moonquakes,
speciﬁcally examining frequency spectra of deep moonquakes
using machine learning. Machine learning has advantages to
classify deep moonquakes such as automation of analyses and
the great reduction of human cost.
Although the waveforms are effective features to infer
moonquake sources, determination of sources of some moon-
quakes is difﬁcult due to large noise and the small amplitude.
Previous studies have not applied any features other than
the waveforms. Therefore, we speciﬁcally examine features
other than the waveforms. If we show that feature such as
velocity is effective for classiﬁcation of deep moonquake,
classiﬁcation using a combination of the feature and wave-
forms may increase the number of classiﬁable moonquakes
even if moonquakes include noise and small amplitude of
the waveforms. Deep moonquakes occur periodically from
the same source related with the tidal stresses [9]–[11]. As
described herein, we extract features from the occurrence time
of deep moonquakes. Then, using machine learning, we verify
the effective features to classify sources of deep moonquakes.
A principal beneﬁt of our approach is that we can infer sources
of deep moonquakes, irrespective of noise and amplitude of the
waveforms.
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents
a review of related works including moonquake analyses.

RELATED WORKS
Generally, time differences among arrival times of the seis-
mic phases observed at several seismic stations are available
to determine the moonquake sources. If we cannot use the
time differences to estimate sources due to the noise and small
amplitudes in the waveforms, then similarities of waveforms
are useful to classify sources. In 1970, the moonquakes were
classiﬁed manually by visual observation [12].
With the evolution of computers, Nakamura et al. [7]
classiﬁed deep moonquakes using hierarchical clustering based
on cross correlation of waveforms. This classiﬁed result of
deep moonquakes is cataloged as a standard criterion for
classiﬁcation in this study. The improvement of the prepro-
cessing methods, which use cross-correlation analyses, enables
us to discover new events and to classify the unclassiﬁed
deep moonquakes [13]. Furthermore, the paper written by
Endrun et al. [14] proposed a method for event detection and
classiﬁcation using a Hidden Markov Model. Goto et al. [8]
developed a web system for visualizing moonquakes consid-
ering waveform similarity using Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
to advance the study of moonquake classiﬁcation. This study
showed that noise and small amplitudes of the waveforms
affect classiﬁcation criteria. Therefore, we propose an approach
to classify deep moonquakes, not using the waveforms.
III.
METHODS
To verify the features for classiﬁcation of deep moon-
quakes, we apply Balanced Random Forest [15] extended
from Random Forest [16], which is a representative supervised
learning method. We verify whether seismic sources can be
reproduced or not using Balanced Random Forest.
A. Features
We extract the position (x, y, z), velocity (vx, vy, vz),
distance (
√
x2 + y2 + z2), and the magnitude of the velocity
(
√
vx2 + vy2 + vz2) of each planet (the Earth, Sun, Jupiter
and Venus) relative to the Moon in the IAU MOON coordinate
system, calculated using SPICE [17] at the deep moonquake
occurrence time. We apply the orbit parameters as the features.
The IAU MOON coordinate system is the Moon ﬁxed coor-
dinate system. The z-axis is the North Pole direction of the
Moon. The x-axis is the meridian direction of the Moon. The
y-axis is to the right of the x-z plane.
B. Balanced Random Forest
Random Forest [16] is a classiﬁcation algorithm that ﬁts
a number of decision tree classiﬁers on various sub-samples
of the dataset. This algorithm can compute feature impor-
tance. However, Random Forest has a serious problem: the
classiﬁer might overﬁt with imbalanced data. Generally, when
we apply Random Forest, we assign weights based on class,
with the minority class assigned a larger weight to make the
classiﬁer more suitable for the imbalanced data. However, this
approach can cause over-learning of minority data if the data
are extremely imbalanced. We must apply a method for the
imbalanced data to analyze of deep moonquakes because a
different number of events occurs at each seismic source.
As described herein, we apply Balanced Random Forest
[15], which equalizes the number of samples per class for

each iteration in random forest. The decision tree of Balanced
Random Forest uses a Gini coefﬁcient to ﬁnd splits. We then
compute the feature importance by calculating the average
reduction ratio of the Gini coefﬁcient in the tree split for each
feature.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, we present the results obtained from appli-
cation of our method to the dataset. The procedures used for
our proposed method are presented below.
•
We extract the orbit parameters as the features at the
occurrence time of deep moonquake event.
•
We create a Balanced Random Forest classiﬁer for
every pair of seismic sources.
•
We verify the relation of seismic sources and the
features based on the classiﬁcation performance and
feature importance of each classiﬁer.
In these experiments, we applied one-vs.-one, which creates a
classiﬁer for each pair of seismic sources.
As described in this paper, the number of iterations in
Balanced Random Forest is 1,000. Each iteration randomly
selects 30 samples for each class using bootstrap method and
3 features from 8 features. Each iteration tree is implemented
using the scikit-learn [18].
A. Dataset
The number of events in each source is given in Table I.
We chose the seismic sources with more than 70 events in the
lunar event catalog. The used dataset has 16 sources and 2,480
events.
B. Criterion
We used the classiﬁcation performance and the feature
importance to evaluate the features. We performed 10-fold
cross validation, and used the minimum f-measure in each class
for the classiﬁcation performance. Due to different number of
seismic events at each source, the minimum score was applied
because the scores depend on the amount of data in each class.
We calculated feature extraction from all classiﬁer-learned data
of the target class without cross validation and the classiﬁcation
performance and the feature importance among each planet.
C. Classiﬁcation performance
The average of classiﬁcation performance for each seismic
source and planet is shown in Table II. ”avg./total”, which is in
the last row, shows the average of all classiﬁers. The averages

of all classiﬁers are 0.79 for the Earth, 0.70 for Jupiter, 0.55
for the Sun, and 0.46 for Venus. A classiﬁer using those
features for the Earth has the highest classiﬁcation performance
presented in this paper. Among our selected seismic sources,
the classiﬁer for A23 using the features for the Earth has the
highest classiﬁcation performance reported in this paper. The
classiﬁcation performance ranking is shown in Table III. Table
III shows that the classiﬁer for A1 has the lowest classiﬁcation
performance reported herein. For the Earth and Jupiter A5,
A23, and A25 are classiﬁed very well within the top 6.
The number of classiﬁers with classiﬁcation performance
of 0.8 or more are 70/120 (number of classiﬁers is 120) for
Earth, 30/120 for Jupiter, 5/120 for the Sun, and 0/120 for
Venus in Table II. These results demonstrate that an orbit
parameter of the Earth and Jupiter relative to the Moon is
effective for deep moonquake classiﬁcation. Particularly, the
features based on the Earth are the most effective. As described
in previous papers, this fact indicates that the tidal stress caused
by the Earth in the lunar interior can affect the occurrences of
deep moonquakes.
The features based on the Sun and Venus are ineffective,
as show in Table II. These results show that some features
based on the Earth and Jupiter are effective to classify seismic
sources, nonetheless some features based on the Sun and Venus
are not. There are some sources, such as A5, A23 and A25,
which are easy to classify by using orbit parameters. A subject
of future work is analysis of why these features contribute well
to the classiﬁcation or not.

Table II and Table III show that orbit features are useful
for classiﬁcation of deep moonquakes as well as waveforms
studied in an earlier paper [7]. As a result, our experimental
results show that orbit features can classify deep moonquakes.
Therefore, when we try to classify unclassiﬁed deep moon-
quakes or moonquakes with noise and small amplitude of
the waveforms, the orbit features are effective to classify
the moonquakes. In addition, the relation between the Moon
and other planets includes some knowledge to analyze the
occurrence of deep moonquakes.
D. Feature Importances
The average of feature importances in each seismic source
for each planet are shown in Table IV, Table V, Table VI, and
Table VII. Among all lists, vz of the Earth in A9 based on
the Earth is the highest score. Also, z of the Earth in A23
based on Earth is the second highest score. The velocity of
the Earth in A5 is the lowest score. In Table IV, the score
related to velocity is low in all sources. The score difference
in all sources is small in Table V and Table VII. Also, x and
vy of A204 are the highest scores in Table VI. The feature
importances of distance and velocity are low in all sources in
Table VI.
We discuss a reason of high feature importances related to
vz of the Earth in A9 and z of the Earth in A23. Figure 1 and
Figure 2 are box plots that present values of the feature for
each seismic source. Figure 1 shows that distribution of the
position in the z coordinate at occurrence time of A23 events
is from about -45,000 km to about -20,000 km. That of A7
events is from about 0 km to about 50,000 km. Other sources,

such as those of A1, A8, and A10, have a wider range than
A23 or A7. Conversely, Figure 2 shows that the distribution
of the velocity in the z coordinate at occurrence time of A9
events is from about 0.06 km/s to about 0.13 km/s. That of A5
is from about -0.13 km/s to about -0.02 km/s. Other sources,
such as A8, A20, and A35, have a wider range than A9 or A5.
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show differences in the distribution
of the features for each seismic source. We can show that the
features with high importance have a narrow distribution and
that seismic sources have features which have high feature
importances; A1 does not have these features.
Moreover, the position and velocity in z coordinate at
occurrence time of each seismic event in a few sources are
shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Figure 3 shows that ﬂuctuation
of z position at occurrence time of A23 events is small through
the observation period and that the occurrence frequency of
A23 from about 1975 to about 1976 is less frequent than
in other periods. The distribution of z position at occurrence
time of A1 events changed from about 1973 to about 1975.
Conversely, Figure 4 shows that ﬂuctuation of z velocity at
occurrence time of A9 events is small through the observation
period. The distribution of z velocity at occurrence time of A1
events changed from about 1973 to about 1975.
The results show that there is a time variation of the fea-
tures for each source. Therefore, the classiﬁcation performance
of A1 might be improved if features with time variation could
be considered.
Next, we discuss the velocity of the Earth and the distance
of Jupiter as examples of the features with low feature im-

portance. Figure 5 and Figure 6 are box plots that indicate
values of these features for each seismic source. Figure 5 and
Figure 6 show that the low feature importances are caused by
small difference among values of the features for each seismic
source.
Time variations of the velocity of Earth and distance of
Jupiter are presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8. Figure 7 shows
that the velocity of Earth greatly varies with time. Figure 8
shows that the period of distance is about 1 year. Figure 7
and Figure 8 show that it is difﬁcult to extract tendencies of
the features because, this time, the variation is very different
from Figure 3 or Figure 4. These results show that we may be
able to improve classiﬁcation if we apply methods and features
considering the time variation or periodicity.

Using Balanced Random Forest, we easily calculated the
feature importance in addition to the classiﬁcation perfor-

mance. As a result, some orbit parameters are useful for
the classiﬁcation of deep moonquakes. However, we did not
do ﬁne-tuning to improve the classiﬁcation performance. We
need to apply other machine learning methods, ﬁne tuning of
parameters, and waveforms to classify more precisely.
We avoided analyzing all features to limit multicollinearity.
Therefore, it is difﬁcult to declare decisive features to charac-
terize seismic sources. Additionally, in this paper, it is difﬁcult
to estimate causal relationship.
Accordingly, we must verify new features or preprocess
features with multicollinearity considering features leading to
elucidation of the causes of deep moonquakes. However, the
features in our approach are effective for new analyses and
for creating knowledge of experts. Our ﬁndings show the
causal relations between seismic sources and outer space for
occurrence of deep moonquakes.
V.
CONCLUSION
This study evaluated the spatial and temporal features for
classiﬁcation of deep moonquake sources using Balanced Ran-
dom Forest. The ﬁndings reported in this paper are presented

•
Seismic sources are classiﬁable using temporal and
spatial features without using the waveforms used in
conventional classiﬁcation.
•
Results of the classiﬁcation performance using orbit
parameters of objects in our Solar System (Earth, Sun,
Jupiter, and Venus) suggest that the Earth orbit param-
eter is the most effective feature among them. The
Jupiter orbit parameter is effective for classiﬁcation
of some seismic sources.
•
Features of seismic sources with low time variation
have high feature importance.
Our experimental results show that the orbit features are effec-
tive when we try to classify unclassiﬁed deep moonquakes or
moonquakes with noise and small amplitude of the waveforms.
These ﬁndings are expected to be useful for new analyses and
for knowledge creation by experts. Further progress of this
study can generate new knowledge about deep moonquake
occurrence mechanisms. Future works are described below.

Veriﬁcation considering correlation and confounding
among some features.
