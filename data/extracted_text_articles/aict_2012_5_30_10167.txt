Abstract—The aim of this paper is to present a new analytical
calculation method for the occupancy distribution and the
blocking probability in the so-called limited-availability group
with multi-service sources and reservation mechanisms. The
paper considers multi-service limited-availability systems with
multi-service sources, in which each single trafﬁc source can
generate calls of different trafﬁc classes. To date, only models
of multi-service systems with single-service sources, in which
a single source of a given class generates always only calls
of this particular class have been considered in teletrafﬁc
literature. The results of analytical modeling of the limited-
availability systems with multi-service sources and reservation
mechanisms are compared with simulation data, which conﬁrm
a high accuracy of the method. Any possible application
of the proposed model can be considered in the context of
wireless networks with multi-service sources and reservation
mechanisms, as well as in the context of switching networks.

I. INTRODUCTION
Cellular networks are one of the most rapidly growing
areas of telecommunications and one of the most popular
systems of mobile communication. They can be used for
voice transmission, but are also very efﬁcient for sending
data streams from different applications [1] [2] [3]. Data
transmission is a type of service that originally was not
handled by cellular networks. Over time, data transmission
has become more and more popular in expanding mobile
networks. Data transmission services offered by operators
include video conferencing services, streaming audio ser-
vices, electronic mail and large ﬁle transmission [4] [5] [6]
[7].
The increase in trafﬁc intensity of trafﬁc generated by
data transmission services is accompanied by an increase
in the requirements with respect to the size of resources
offered by networks. This also causes a growing necessity
of working out mechanisms that introduce differentiation
in Quality of Service (QoS) for particular data classes.
The introduction of QoS differentiation mechanisms was
conducive in turn to a development of new analytical models
for dimensioning of multi-service mobile networks. The
initial models of multi-service cellular networks (cell groups
models) assumed that a single trafﬁc source of a given class
could generate only one, strictly deﬁned, type of the trafﬁc
stream (trafﬁc sources class unequivocally determined the
nature of a trafﬁc stream). Both cell groups without QoS
mechanisms introduced [8], and cell groups with QoS differ-
entiation mechanisms, were considered, including resource
reservation mechanisms [9] [10] [11].
With multi-service terminals becoming more and more
universal in modern cellular networks, it has become nec-
essary to develop new trafﬁc models. In [12], a model of
the multi-service network was presented for the ﬁrst time,
which assumed that a given and deﬁned set of services was
related to a single trafﬁc source. The considered system
was described as a multi-service system with multi-service
sources. The considerations presented in [12] were limited,
however, to a model of a single full-availability cell (single
resource) without any Quality of Service differentiation
mechanisms introduced.
This paper proposes a model of a limited-availability
group of resources, in which — to facilitate resource usage
— a reservation mechanism has been implemented. The
model can be used, similarly as in [12], for modeling cell
groups in multi-service networks. In the proposed model,
it is taken into consideration that a single terminal can
generate various trafﬁc streams corresponding to particular
services implemented in the terminal. Additionally, it is
assumed that the services cannot be used simultaneously by
the terminal. This means that when the terminal is involved
in the generation of trafﬁc stream related to one service, it
cannot at the same time generate trafﬁc streams related to
other services.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section II, the analytical model of the limited-availability
systems with multi-service sources and resource reservation
mechanism is proposed. In Section III, the results of the
blocking probability obtained for three limited-availability
systems with multi-service sources and reservation mecha-
nisms are compared with the simulation data. Section IV
concludes the paper and presents further work.

II. ANALYTICAL MODEL OF LIMITED-AVAILABILITY
GROUP WITH MULTI-SERVICE SOURCES AND
RESERVATION MECHANISMS
Let us consider a model of the limited-availability group
(LAG) with multi-service sources and the capacity VL,
presented in Figure 1. The limited-availability group consists
of υ identical separated resources (e.g., transmission links)
with the capacity equal to f BBUs (basic bandwidth units,
i.e., allocation units). The total capacity of the system VL is
equal to VL = υf BBUs.
Figure 1.
Model of the limited-availability group
In the considered model, m trafﬁc classes that belong
to the set M = {1, 2, ..., m} are deﬁned. A given class c
requires tc BBUs to set up a new connection. The service
time for class c calls has an exponential distribution with
the parameter µc (service rate). In the group, the reservation
mechanism has been applied. In accordance with the adopted
reservation mechanism for a given class c, the reservation
limit Qc is introduced (Qc is a certain occupancy state of
the system, expressed in the number of BBUs being busy).
The reservation mechanism can be applied to selected trafﬁc
classes from the set M. The classes, in which the reservation
limit has been introduced are grouped into a new set of
classes R, which is a sub-set of the set M. The parameter
Rc that determines the reservation area (a certain number of
occupancy states of the system) has also been deﬁned. This
parameter can be expressed by the following formula:
Rc = VF − Qc.
(1)
The system admits a call of class c that belongs to the
set R for service only when this call can be entirely carried
by the resources of an arbitrary single link and when the
number of free BBUs in the group is higher or equal to the
value of the reservation area Rc. A call of class c that does
not belong to the set R can be serviced when this call can be
entirely carried by the resources of an arbitrary single link.
This is, thus, an example of a system with a state-dependent
service process, in which the state dependence is the result
of the structure of the group and the introduced reservation
mechanism. An example of the limited-availability group
with reservation mechanism applied for only class 1 is
presented in Figure 2.
Figure 2.
Model of the limited-availability group with reservation
mechanisms
The group is offered three types of Erlang (Poisson
call streams), Engset (binomial call streams) and Pascal
(negative binomial call streams) trafﬁc streams [13]. The
selected types of trafﬁc cover three different types of the
dependence between the mean arrival rates of calls and the
occupancy state of the system: (1) the mean arrival rate of
new calls does not depend on the occupancy state of the
system (Erlang trafﬁc), (2) the mean arrival rate of new
calls decreases with the increase in the occupancy state of
the system (Engset trafﬁc), (3) the mean arrival rate of new
calls increases with the increase in the occupancy state of
the system.
Each trafﬁc stream is generated by sources that belong to
the corresponding set of trafﬁc sources ZC,s. In set ZC,s
index C denotes the type of trafﬁc stream generated by
sources, which belong to this set and takes the value I for
Erlang trafﬁc stream, J for Engset trafﬁc stream and K for
Pascal trafﬁc stream, respectively, while index s denotes the
number of the set, the sources of which generate a given type
of trafﬁc stream. In the system, the sI sets of trafﬁc sources
that generate Erlang trafﬁc streams are deﬁned, as well as
sJ sets of trafﬁc sources that generate Engset trafﬁc streams
and sK sets of trafﬁc sources that generate Pascal trafﬁc
streams. The total number of the sets of trafﬁc sources is
S = sI + sJ + sK. The sources that belong to the set ZC,s
can generate calls from the set CC,s = {1, 2, ..., cC,s} of
trafﬁc classes according to the available set of services.

The participation of class c (from the set M) in the trafﬁc
structure of trafﬁc generated by sources from the set ZC,s
is determined by the parameter ηC,s,c, which, for particular
sets of Erlang, Engset and Pascal trafﬁc sources, satisﬁes the
following dependencies:
cI,i

c=1
ηI,i,c = 1,
cJ,j

c=1
ηJ,j,c = 1,
cK,k

To determine the value of trafﬁc AI,i,c offered by Erlang
sources that belong to the set ZI,i as well as the trafﬁc value
AJ,j,c(n) offered by Engset sources from the set ZJ,j and
trafﬁc AK,k,c(n) offered by Pascal sources from the set ZK,k
that generate calls of class c in the state of n busy BBUs,
we use the following formulas [12]:
AI,i,c = ηI,i,cλI,i/µc.
(3)
AJ,j,c(n) = ηJ,j,cNJ,jαJ,jσJ,j,c,T (n),
(4)
AK,k,c(n) = ηK,k,cSK,kβK,kσK,k,c,T (n),
(5)
σJ,j,c,T (n) = [ηJ,j,cNJ,j − yJ,j,c(n)]/ηJ,j,cNJ,j,
(6)
σK,k,c,T (n) = [ηK,k,cSK,k + yK,k,c(n)]/ηK,k,cSK,k,
(7)
where:
• λI,i – the mean arrival rate of new calls generated by
a single Poisson source that belongs to the set ZI,i
• ηJ,j,c – the parameter that determines the participation
of calls of class c in trafﬁc generated by sources that
belong to the set ZJ,j,
• ηK,k,c – the parameter that determines the participation
of calls of class c in trafﬁc generated by sources that
belong to the set ZK,k,
• NJ,j – the number of Engset trafﬁc sources that belong
to the set ZJ,j,
• SK,k – the number of Pascal trafﬁc sources that belong
to the set ZK,k,
• yJ,j,c(n) – the average number of calls of class c
generated by Engset sources that belong to the set
ZJ,j currently serviced in the system in the occupancy
state n,
• yK,k,c(n) – the average number of calls of class c
generated by Pascal sources that belong to the set
ZK,k currently serviced in the system in the occupancy
state n,
• αJ,j – the average trafﬁc intensity of trafﬁc generated
by a single Engset source that belongs to the set ZJ,j,
determined by the following formula:
αJ,j =
cJ,j
X
c=1
ηJ,j,c
γJ,j
µc
,
(8)
where γJ,j – the mean arrival rate of new calls gener-
ated by a single Engset source that belongs to the set
ZJ,j,
• βK,k – the average trafﬁc intensity of trafﬁc generated
by a single Pascal source that belongs to the set ZK,k,
deﬁned by the following formula:
βK,k =
cK,k
X
c=1
ηK,k,c
γK,k
µc
,
(9)
where γK,k – the mean arrival rate of new calls
generated by a single Pascal source that belongs to the
set ZK,k.
We can notice that – according to Formulas (6) and (7)
– with the case of Engset sources, the mean arrival rate
of new calls of individual trafﬁc classes decreases with the
increase in the occupancy state of the system, whereas in the
case of Pascal sources the mean arrival rate of new calls of
individual trafﬁc classes increases with the increase in the
occupancy state of the system.
Taking into consideration the inﬂuence of the speciﬁc
structure of the limited-availability group on the process of a
determination of the occupancy distribution using Kaufman-
Roberts recursion, in [14] the use of conditional coefﬁcients
of passing σc,S(n), was proposed. The value of the param-
eter σc,S(n) does not depend on incoming call process and
can be determined as follows [14]:
σc,S(n) = F(VL − n, υ, f, 0) − F(VL − n, υ, tc − 1, 0)
F(VL − n, υ, f, 0)
,
(10)
where F(x, υ, f, t) is the number of arrangement of x
free BBUs in υ links, calculated with the assumption that
capacity of each link is equal to f BBUs and each link has
at least t free BBUs:
F (x, υ, f, t) =
=
⌊ x−υt
f−t+1⌋
X
r=0
(−1)r
υ
r
x − υ(t − 1) − 1 − r(f − t + 1)
υ − 1

.
(11)
Observe that in the case of the considered model of the
limited-availability group with multi-service trafﬁc sources
and reservation the operation of the reservation mechanism
introduces an additional dependence between the service
stream in the system and the current state of the system.
To determine this dependence, the parameter σc,R(n) is
introduced. The parameter σc,R(n) can be calculated using
the following formula:
σc,R(n) =





1
for n ⩽ Qc ∧ c ∈ R,
0
for n > Qc ∧ c ∈ R,
1
for c ̸∈ R.
(12)
The reservation mechanism is introduced to the group
regardless of its structure, which allows us to carry on with
product-form determination of the total coefﬁcient of passing

(transition coefﬁcient) σc,Tot(n) in the limited-availability
group:
σc,Tot(n) = σc,S(n) · σc,R(n).
(13)
Having the values of offered trafﬁc AI,i,c, AJ,j,c(n),
AK,k,c(n) and the total coefﬁcient of passing σc,Tot(n) at
our disposal, we are in position to modify the original
Kaufman-Roberts formula [15] [16] in order to determine the
occupancy distribution in the limited-availability group with
multi-service trafﬁc sources and the reservation mechanism:
n[Pn]VL =
sI

X
c=1
AK,k,c(n − tc)σc,Tot(n − tc)tc[Pn−tc]VL,
(14)
where [Pn]VL is the occupancy distribution (the probability
of n busy BBUs) in a system with the capacity VL, and the
parameter σc,Tot(n) determines the additional dependence
between the service stream and the current state of the
system resulting from the speciﬁc structure of the group and
the applied reservation mechanism.
Having the values of individual state probabilities [Pn]VL,
determined on the basis of Formula (14), we are in position
to determine the average number of serviced calls of class
c, generated by sources that belong to the sets ZJ,j (Engset)
and ZK,k (Pascal sources). For this purpose, we use the
following formulas:
yJ,j,c(n)=





AJ,j,c(n − tc)σc,Tot(n−tc)[Pn−tc]VL/[Pn]VL
for n ⩽ VL,
0,
for n > VL.
(15)
yK,k,c(n)=





AK,k,c(n − tc)σc,Tot(n−tc)[Pn−tc]VL/[Pn]VL
for n ⩽ VL,
0,
for n > VL.
(16)
The knowledge of the occupancy [Pn]VL is required to
determine the parameters yJ,j,c(n) and yK,k,c(n). Whereas,
to determine the occupancy [Pn]VL it is necessary to know
the values of the parameters yJ,j,c(n) and yK,k,c(n). Equa-
tions (15), (16) and (14) form thus a set of confounding
equations. To solve a given set of confounding equations it
is necessary to employ iterative methods [17] [18].
Assuming that the distribution [P (l)
n ]VL is the occupancy
distribution, determined in the l-th iteration, while y(l)
J,j,c(n)
and y(l)
K,k,c(n) deﬁne the average number of serviced calls of
class c generated by trafﬁc sources that belong respectively
to the sets ZJ,j and ZK,k, we can write:
y(l+1)
J,j,c (n)=





A(l)
J,j,c(n−tc)σc,Tot(n−tc)[P (l)
n−tc]VL/[P (l)
n ]VL
for n ⩽ VL,
0,
for n > VL.
(17)
y(l+1)
K,k,c(n)=




A(l)
K,k,c(n−tc)σc,Tot(n−tc)[P (l)
n−tc]VL/[P (l)
n ]VL
for n ⩽ VL,
0,
for n > VL.
(18)
The iteration process, involving Formulas (14), (17) and
(18), terminates when the assumed accuracy ǫ of the iteration
process is reached:
∀0≤n≤V

yl−1
J,j,c(n) − y(l)

Subsequently, we are in position to determine the blocking
probability for calls of class c that belong to the set M =
{1, 2, ..., m}:
Ec =

[Pn]VL [1 − σc,Tot(n)] .
(21)
III. NUMERICAL RESULTS
The presented method for a determination of the blocking
probability in systems with multi-service trafﬁc sources and
reservation mechanisms is an approximate method. In order
to conﬁrm adopted assumptions, the results of the analytical
calculations were compared with the simulation data. The
research was carried for three systems, which are described
below:

The results of the simulation are shown in the charts in
the form of marks with 95% conﬁdence intervals that have
been calculated according to the t-Student distribution for
the ﬁve series with 1,000,000 calls of each class. For each
of the points of the simulation, the value of the conﬁdence
interval is at least one order lower than the mean value of
the results of the simulation. In many a case, the value of
the simulation interval is lower than the height of the sign
used to indicate the value of the simulation experiment.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER WORK
This paper proposes a new method for a calculation of
the occupancy distribution and the blocking probability in
limited-availability systems with multi-service trafﬁc sources
and reservation mechanisms. The method can be used in
modeling connection handoff between cells in cellular sys-
tems [8], as well as in modeling outgoing directions of
switching networks [19]. The proposed method is based on
the iterative algorithm for a determination of the average
value of trafﬁc sources being serviced in particular states
of the system. The results of analytical calculations were
compared with the simulation data, which conﬁrmed high
accuracy of the proposed method. The proposed method is
not complicated and can be easily implemented.
In the further work we plan to develop analytical models
of the multi-service systems with multi-service sources, in
which different call admission control mechanisms will be
applied, i.e., an analytical model of multi-service networks
with threshold mechanisms and multi-service sources, and
