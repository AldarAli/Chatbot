Abstract—Recently, a new scheme for joint remotely
preparing an arbitrary three-qubit state based on two
three-qubit projective measurements was proposed. In
this paper, we put forward two novel schemes to
complete the joint remote preparation for this class of
three-qubit state with complex coefficients via three
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states as the
quantum channel. In the present schemes, two senders
share the original state which they wish to help the
receiver
to
remotely
prepare.
To
complete
the
schemes, some novel sets of mutually orthogonal basis
vectors are introduced. It is shown that, only if two
senders collaborate with each other, and perform
projective measurements under suitable measuring
basis and appropriate unitary operations on their own
qubits respectively, the receiver can reconstruct the
original state. Compared with the previous scheme,
the advantage of the present schemes is that the total
success probability can reach 1.

Ⅰ. INTRODUCTION
In the last decade, Lo [1], Pati [2], and Bennett et al. [3]
presented a new quantum communication scheme that
uses classical communication and a previously shared
entangled resource to remotely prepare a quantum state.
This communication scheme is called remote state
preparation (RSP). Compared with teleportation [4], RSP
requires
less
classical
communication
cost
than
teleportation. Since then, various theoretical protocols for
generalization
of
RSP
have
been
proposed
and
experimental implementations of RSP scheme have been
presented [5-22]. One can note easily that the above
schemes assume the case that only one sender knows the
original state.
Recently, a novel aspect of PSP, called as the joint
remote state preparation(JRSP), has been proposed [23-
29]. In these schemes of the JRSP [23-29], two senders
(or N senders) know partly of original state they want to
remotely preparation, respectively. In a recent paper [30],
joint remote preparation of an arbitrary three-qubit state
with complex coefficients has been proposed. More
recently, Chen et al. [31] pointed out that the scheme by
Luo et al. [30] does not work for states with arbitrary
complex coefficients, and then proposed a new scheme
for JRSP of an arbitrary three-qubit state with complex
coefficients via EPR-type pairs [31]. In the scheme [31],
the coefficients of the original state are split into two
symmetric subsets. For maximally quantum channel,
Chen's scheme can be successfully realized only with the
probability 1
8 by two sets of three-qubit orthogonal basis
projective measurement.
Now, we re-investigate the joint remote preparation of
an arbitrary three-qubit state with complex coefficients.
In this paper, two novel JRSP schemes are presented with
unit successful probability. For clearly, we only consider
maximally entangled channel. In Section 2, we propose
the first scheme using three-qubit GHZ states as the
quantum channel, and construct two sets of measuring
basis which are same as [31]. Different from the Chens'
scheme in [31], in our scheme, to acquire unit success
probability, the coefficients of the original state are split
into two non-symmetric subsets, and after first sender

(Alice) performs her projective measurement, the second
sender (Bob) should make a suitable unitary operation on
his
qubits,
and
then
perform
another
projective
measurement on the qubits, the receiver can recover the
original state by appropriate unitary operations, and the
total successful probability of JPSP process being 1. In
Section 3, we propose the other deterministic JRSP
scheme
via
a
novel
three-qubit
orthogonal
basis
projective measurement, and the total success probability
is still 1. The required classical communication cost of
each of these schemes is six bits. Some discussions and
conclusions are given in the last Section.
Ⅱ. JRSP VIA TWO THREE-QUBIT PROJECTIVE
MEASUREMENTS AND AN UNITARY OPERATION
BY TWO SENDERS
Suppose that two senders Alice and Bob wish to help
the receiver Charlie remotely prepare the state [31]

To

inspired by the schemes of [22, 32, 33], we assume that

state (1) are split into two non-symmetric subsets, i.e.,
modulus ( )

and phase (
j )
coefficients. We also
suppose that the state shared by Alice, Bob, and Charlie
as the quantum channel are three GHZ states

outcomes of Alice and Bob, the receiver Charlie can
reconstruct the original state p
and the total successful

scheme
is
deterministic.

Ⅲ. JRSP VIA TWO THREE-QUBIT PROJECTIVE
MEASUREMENTS BY TWO SENDERS
Now, let us further propose the scheme for remote
preparation of an arbitrary three-qubit state by only two
three-qubit projective measurements. Assume the state
that Alice and Bob wish to help the receiver Charlie
remotely prepare is still in state
p
(see (1)), and the
quantum channel shared by Alice, Bob and Charlie is still
in states (2).
In order to realize the JRSP, two senders need to
construct their own measuring bases respectively. The
first measuring basis chosen by Alice is still in a set (3).
The second measuring bases by Bob are eight sets of

So, the JRSP scheme is also deterministic. The required
classical communication cost is six bits.
Ⅳ.CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have presented two novel schemes
for joint remote preparation of an arbitrary three-qubit
states with complex coefficients. In these schemes, two
senders share the arbitrary three-qubit states, but each
sender only partly knows the state, and two three-qubit
GHZ states are exploited as the quantum channel. To
complete the JRSP schemes, some novel sets of three-
qubit mutually orthogonal basis vectors have been
introduced. In the first scheme, the first sender performs a
three-qubit
projective
measurement
on
her
qubits.
According to the measurement result of the first sender,
the second sender should perform a suitable unitary
operation on his qubits, then makes another three-qubit
projective measurement on those qubits. In accord with
the measurement outcomes of two senders, the receiver
can reconstruct the original state by appropriate unitary
operation. Next, we have proposed second scheme for
JRSP of arbitrary three-qubit state with two senders. In

this scheme, the first sender performs a three-qubit
projective measurement on her qubits and the measuring
basis is still in Section 2. Different from the scheme in
Section 2, according to measurement result of first sender,
the second sender should choose one of the novel eight
sets of the measuring basis to measure his qubits. After
these projective measurements by two senders, the
original state can be recovered by the receiver. Compared
with the previous scheme of JRSP in [31], the advantage
of the present schemes is that the total success probability
can reach 1. Thus, our present schemes are useful in
expanding RSP field in quantum information science.
