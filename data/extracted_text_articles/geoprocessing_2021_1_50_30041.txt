Abstract—Mineral/melt partition coefﬁcients describe the re-
distribution of trace elements during melting processes. They
are highly inﬂuenced by changing pressure, temperature, and
composition. We ﬁnd that for sodium, partition coefﬁcients rise in
the order of two magnitudes from 0-15 GPa along the peridotite
solidus temperature. Still, because of lacking high-pressure exper-
imental data and the limited pressure range of most partitioning
models, mantle and crust evolution models normally rely on
constant partition coefﬁcients. Based on an earlier model, we cre-
ated a thermodynamic model which calculates sodium partition
coefﬁcients between clinoproxene and anhydrous silicate melts.
With the results, we parametrise an equation over 0-15 GPa and
various melt fractions. Our new parametrised partitioning model
for sodium complements previous models and is applicable up to
the mantle transition zone (4-12 GPa/1850-2360 K). Knowing
the sodium partitioning behavior enables us to base further
calculations for many other elements on it.

I. INTRODUCTION
Inside the Earth and other terrestrial planets, partial melts
usually control the redistribution of trace elements from the
mantle to the crust. If melt is buoyant due to a lower density
than the surrounding rock, it moves upwards and transports the
previously incorporated incompatible trace elements towards
the surface. This leads to enriched reservoirs near the surface
and depleted upper mantle areas. Expanding the redistribution
concept to a certain number of elements leads to the creation of
trace element patterns, which are unique geochemical markers
of the events that led to the exact appearance and compositions
of a rock of interest [1][2][3].
During melting, partition coefﬁcients describe if an element
prefers to be incorporated into a mineral or, if it is incompat-
ible, into melt. Partitioning data for peridotite including the
minerals olivine, orthopyroxene, and clinopyroxene show that
in mantle rocks, clinopyroxene is the mineral taking in most
incompatible trace elements [4][5]. This makes clinopyroxene
the mineral with the largest inﬂuence on trace element redis-
tribution.
Since partition coefﬁcients of sodium between clinopyrox-
ene and silicate melt are highly affected by changing pressure
and temperature, partition coefﬁcient models should consider
these parameters. Because of analytical limitations, there are
only few measured partition coefﬁcients available for high-
pressure conditions. Additionally, partition coefﬁcient models
are often only applicable for rather low pressures. This is the
reason why so far, partial melt simulations in some mantle
evolution models either neglected partition coefﬁcients and
chose pre-deﬁned elemental abundances in mantle melts [6],
or settled for constant experimentally derived and estimated
partition coefﬁcients [7][8][9][10].
In 1937, Goldschmidt postulated that both the matching size
and charge of the mineral’s lattice site and element of interest
determine an element’s ability to partition into a mineral [11].
This leads to the assumption that not only it is possible to de-
termine the P-T sensitive partition coefﬁcients experimentally,
but also by means of numerical modelling. Based on a model
of Brice (1975) [12], Blundy et al. (1995) [13] developed a
quantitative model and determined a parametrised ﬁt function
for clinopyroxene/melt partition coefﬁcients for sodium in the
range of 0-4 GPa and 1000-1800◦C.
As is shown in Figure 1, partition coefﬁcients of trace
elements have a parabolic relationship in an Onuma diagram.
The parabolas’ curves change in broadness and shift along the
x-axis depending on the bulk modulus E and the ideal lattice
site radius r0, respectively. Because of this relationship, it is
possible to calculate other trace elements’ partition coefﬁcients
based on the reference coefﬁcient DNa.
The aim of this study is to implement a thermodynamic
model for Dcpx/melt
Na
for a large range of pressures suitable
for mantle melt simulations. Furthermore, we parametrise a ﬁt
function from the mentioned model that is applicable for upper
mantle pressures. This will open the possibility to include
partition coefﬁcients depending on pressure and temperature
into mantle evolution models and to acquire more realistic
model results [14].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section II,
we describe the methods used for our parametrisation and ther-
modynamic model in the appropriate subsections. Section III

parametrisation respectively. Section IV discusses the results
and compares them to experimental data. Section V concludes
the paper, summarizes the ﬁndings, and points out what can
be done in future works.
II. METHODS
A. Thermodynamic Model
To obtain the most realistic trace element partitioning re-
sults for mantle melting processes, it is useful to determine
a strain-compensated partition coefﬁcient D0 [15]. Strain-
compensation means that the redistributed element has the
same charge and size as the regular element on the lattice site
of the crystal [12]. Therefore, it is assumed that the radius
of the element of interest ri equals the lattice site radius r0.
This way the partition coefﬁcient Di can be calculated with
the following equation:
Di = D0 exp
−4πEM2NA( r0
2 (ri − r0)2 + 1
3(ri − r0)3)
RT

,
(1)
where EM2 is the bulk modulus of the M2 lattice site, NA the
Avogadro’s number, R the gas constant and T the temperature.
Here, the lattice site of interest is the crystallographic M2 site
of clinopyroxene. Sodium is used as the strain-compensated
partition coefﬁcient D0 because it is the 1+ charge element
that has a radius ri which is closest to the M2 lattice site
radius r0. Therefore, we assume D0 = DNa.
To calculate the strain-compensated partition coefﬁcient D0,
we took a thermodynamic approach described by Blundy et
al. (1995) [13]. For this, we used the melting curve of jadeite
and linked it to the activity of jadeite’s components in the
melt. To calculate the partition coefﬁcients of sodium between
clinopyroxene and silicate melt, jadeite was the clinopyroxene
of choice because of both, its high concentration in sodium
and its ability to mix nearly ideally with diopside [16] and
enstatite.
Generally, partition coefﬁcients are given as the weight
fraction ratio
Di = Xcrystal
i
Xmelt

,
(2)
with Xi being the weight percentage of the given component.
However, since we obtain partition coefﬁcients with the help
of thermodynamic properties, we calculate molar partition
coefﬁcients. Based on experiments on plagioclase/ﬂuid parti-
tioning [17], it is broadly assumed that also for other minerals
molar partition coefﬁcients nearly equal weight percentage
coefﬁcients [18]. Thus, we can make use of Flood’s equation
for exchange equilibria in molten salts [19]:
RT lnKf =
X
Ni∆G0,
(3)
where Kf is the molar equilibrium constant, Ni the concen-
tration of the component and ∆G0 the Gibbs’ free energy of
change. Because we use a thermodynamic approach for our
calculations, Ni can be neglected and is set to one. The molar

roxene M2 lattice site. Modelled after Wood et al. (1997) [18]. Here, DNa

partitioning of jadeite Djd can be expressed by using Kf in
the expression
Djd =

(4)
where acpx

and amelt are the mole of the solid clinopyroxene
and molten components, respectively. Here, we assume an
ideal case where the activity equals the mole fraction of the
elements of interest. Thus, we assume acpx

Na and

= Xmelt
Na . Taking (4) and rearranging (3) leads to the
following equation:
Dcpx/melt

(5)
Besides (5), one more equation is needed to determine
DNa thermodynamically. Equation (6) relates the entropy of
the melting reaction to its heat capacity and melting point
Tf of jadeite at the pressure Pf=0.0001 GPa. By including
the enthalpy, we determine the Gibb’s free energy change of
reaction with the following equation:
∆G(f(P,T )) =∆Hf(Pf ,Tf ) +
Z T

Table I). With the given parameters we can solve the ﬁrst two
integrals in (6) analytically, by evaluating the heat capacity of
the solid at temperature T and the melt heat capacity at Tf.
To solve the third part of the integral in (6) we use a Riemann
integral, where we approximate the intervals on subintervals
deﬁned over a pressure vector of n=1000 steps from P=0.0001
to 15 GPa and assume that the volumes of melt and solid are
constant in each subinterval.

Here, we assume that the thermal expansion coefﬁcient α
is constant for melts and solids (see Table I), hence
∆Vf(T ),i =

By including the melt fraction P-T proﬁles, we make
sure that the resulting model function will satisfy a broader
range of P-T conditions and is not only valid for modelling
partial melting in the mantle (where temperatures are close
to the solidus), but also for crystallisation of melt (where
temperatures are close to the liquidus). In contrast to our
model, partition coefﬁcients for crystallising liquid were often
determined by taking only the liquidus temperatures into
account [25][26][27].
For both, the thermodynamic model and the ﬁt function
development, replication data is accessible in the TRR170-DB
[28].
III. RESULTS
A. Thermodynamic Model Along Melting Temperature Proﬁles
In a pressure range between 0 and 15 GPa and a temperature
range between 1400 and 2400 K, the thermodynamic model
produces increasing partition coefﬁcients from low P/high T
(0 GPa/2400 K) to high P/low T (10-12 GPa/1400 K) condi-
tions (Figure. 2). The increase is in the order of four magni-
tudes and coincides with experimental observations [29][30].
At higher pressure above 12 GPa and low temperatures, the
model starts to invert the trend and the partition coefﬁcients de-
crease with increasing pressure. However, for our ﬁt function
development we have used the P-T space between the solidus
and liquidus, which is not affected by this inversion. Along the
melting temperature proﬁles, increasing pressure always leads
to increasing partition coefﬁcients, while increasing tempera-
tures cause the partition coefﬁcients to decrease (Figure 2).
In Table II, we compare the thermodynamic model results
with experimental literature data. It is notable that most of the
experimental data ﬁt well to the model results. On average, the
coefﬁcients calculated by the thermodynamic model deviate
from the experimental data by 26%. The best ﬁtting value
deviates only 2.9% from the experiments at 0.0001 GPa and
1526 K, while the worst ﬁt deviates by 46.9% at 0.0001 GPa
and 1524 K. The implications of this variance will be discussed
in section IV.
B. Parametrisation of Thermodynamic Model Results
As described in section II-B, we developed a scaled
equation along the mantle peridotite solidus, liquidus, and
corresponding melt fraction temperatures in between. For this,
we used the least square function to ﬁt the thermodynamic
model results presented in Figure 2 to the following equation:
DNa(T[K],P[GPa]) =
exp
2183 + 2517P − 157P 2
T
− 4.575 − 0.5149P + 0.0475P 2

With the new resulting scaling law (15), it is now possible
to calculate partition coefﬁcients for sodium at varied temper-
ature and pressure conditions.
Figure 3 illustrates how the rising DNa values correlate
with rising pressure along the solidus temperature. In contrast
to the ﬁt function of Blundy et al. (1995) [13], our resulting
function produces steadily rising values up to 13.2 GPa at
the respective peridotite solidus temperatures. After this point,
the calculated values are starting to decrease. In contrast to
our study, the model values of Blundy et al. (1995) [13]

start to decline after approximately 5 GPa along the solidus
temperature. However, Blundy et al. (1995) [13] themselves
state that their scaling law is not to be used over a pressure
of 4 GPa.
In Figure 4, the decrease of partition coefﬁcients from the
solidus towards the liquidus becomes visible. This indicates
that not only pressure, but also temperature and therefore melt
fractions have an impact on the redistribution. It should be
noted that at low pressures and high melt fractions, our ﬁt
seems to divert more from the thermodynamic model than
the previous ﬁt [13]. Consequences of this diversion on the
applicability of our scaling law (15) are explored in section IV.
IV. DISCUSSION
Partition coefﬁcients are highly controlled by pressure,
temperature, and composition. Since it is not possible for
models to include all compositional interactions between
a mineral and melt, comparing them to experimental data
is sometimes difﬁcult. This is especially true for higher
pressures, where partition coefﬁcient data is, to this date,
often lacking. However, the existing experimental data for
lower pressures already indicate if we can expect realistic
results from our calculations. As is shown in Table II, our
thermodynamic model results ﬁt well to the experimental
results [13][31]. Best matches were achieved for experimental
data at 0.0001 GPa/1526 K, 2 GPa/1843 K and 3 GPa/1938 K
[13], where the model data deviates from the experimental
values by only 2.9% and for the latter two by 5.4%,
respectively. Interestingly, with 46.9%, the second largest
diversion from the experimental data is at 0.0001 GPa/1524 K,
which is at the same pressure and only 2 K below a very
well ﬁtting value (Table II). However, the experimentally
derived partition coefﬁcients vary more than what could
be solely explained by changing P-T conditions. Deviating
experimental and thermodynamic model results can happen
24

because of several effects. For example, analytical error
margins have to be considered. Furthermore, the composition
of melt as well as solid clinopyroxene can be much more
diverse in experiments than it is for thermodynamic model
calculations, which does not take these changes into account.
It should be noted that the ﬁt parameters in (14) differ from
the parametrisation in Blundy et al. (1995) [13], which is due
to the larger parameter space applied in our model. For a
comparison of the two scaling laws, we refer to Figure 3 and
Figure 4. A direct comparison of the resulting parameters for
the scaling law of our and the previous study [13] is given in
Table II.
Figure 3 illustrates that the partition coefﬁcients calculated
with our scaling law (15) over solidus temperatures is close
to the experimental sodium partitioning data. This data is
indicated by a shaded grey area and, for DNa in the Ab80Di20
system, by darker grey dots [30]. A direct comparison with
appropriate temperatures in the range of the experimental data
[30] shows that here, the thermodynamic model is within an
error of on average 32%.
As is shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, our and the previous
ﬁt [13] do not completely agree with each other. Blundy et al.
(1995) [13] parametrised their thermodynamically calculated
results over a peridotite solidus of McKenzie and Bickle
(1988) [32], while we took the peridotite solidus equation
of de Smet (1999) [22]. This could have produced a small
shift in the DNa-P-T ﬁeld and, therefore, in the resulting
ﬁt function. Also, a different parametrisation method could
have been used by the previous study [13], which might have
produced slightly different ﬁts. Finally, the previous study
[13] concentrated more on low pressure partitioning, whereas
we have tried to parametrise the function up to the 410 km
discontinuity. The inclusion of higher pressures could also
be the reason why at pressures below 4 GPa (especially at
higher melt fractions) our scaling law (15) ﬁts less well to
the thermodynamic model values than the older model [13].
Between 4 and 12 GPa, our scaling law (15) ﬁts well to
the thermodynamic data over all melt fraction values from
solidus to liquidus. However, at high melt fractions below
4 GPa, larger diversions from the original ﬁt function [13]
appear (Figure 4). The reason for this lies in the nature of the
least square parametrisation used in Python 3, which allows
the ﬁt function to divert from the thermodynamic model at
low pressures for the expense of being applicable to higher
pressures and to a wide range of melt fractions. If we would
only parametrise the model over the solidus, the shift would
disappear at the expense of the model being applicable to
any other P-T conditions. Thus, the included P-T conditions
for the varying melt fractions ensure that the model is useful
over a wide range of pressures and temperatures, but limits
the applicability of the scaling law for higher melt fractions
to a range between 4 and 12 GPa.
In the upper mantle, buoyant melt can occur up to the
depth where it becomes gravitationally stable and a density
inversion of melt and solid surrounding material takes place
(the so-called density crossover). In other words, melts
formed at higher pressures may not be able to rise to the
surface [33][34]. However, this is only true for upper mantle
melts and melts rising upwards in lower regions of the Earth
can not be ruled out [35]. Inside Earth, the density crossover
exists at approximately 11-12 GPa at 2000◦C [36], and in
Mars between 7 GPa [36] and 7.5 GPa [37]. To include
pressure and temperature dependent partition coefﬁcients into
a mantle evolution model, it would often sufﬁce to be able
to calculate them up to the density crossover. Overlapping
with the density crossover, in the Earth’s 410 km mantle
discontinuity (i.e., pressures of approximately 12-15 GPa),
phase changes occur [38] and pyroxene slowly starts to
dissolve into a pyrope-rich garnet to form majorite [39]. This
and the density crossover indicate that a parametrisation up
to approximately 12-15 GPa is sufﬁcient.
As the experimental data [30][29] suggests, the partition
coefﬁcients
of
sodium
in
clinopyroxene
increase
with
temperature and pressure before they remain constant. At
solidus P-T conditions, our ﬁt function curve slowly starts to
ﬂatten and starts to fall at approximately 13 GPa (Figure 3).
This coincides with the thermodynamic model, where (along
the solidus) the partition coefﬁcients start to decrease at
12.5 GPa. Combining these ﬁndings with the occurence of
a density crossover and transition zone at approximately
12 GPa, we suggest to not use our scaling law (15) above
this pressure.
As is discussed above, the scaling law works well for
melting P-T conditions between the peridotite solidus and
liquidus between 4 and 12 GPa. Thus, it can be considered
as a useful expansion of the previous scaling law for DNa
[13]. Because of the broad P-T range, the model should
not only be useful for mantle melting, but also for models
which crystallise melt, as is the case in a magma ocean.
However, as recent studies have suggested, the solidus and
liquidus temperature may change heavily depending on if
material is melting or crystallising [40]. If this is the case,
our model could lie outside of the P-T range between solidus
and liquidus for crystallising liquids and would have to be
extrapolated. Therefore, one has to be careful with the usage
of the ﬁt.
Like the thermodynamic model, phase transitions and
density crossover behavior all depend on pressure. Thus,
even for planets with a radius or mass different from Earth,
the ﬁt should be applicable if the mantle composition is
comparable to Earth. Additionally, the composition of the
terrestrial planet has to be taken into account. If there is no
or if there are only very minor portions of clinopyroxene in
the planets upper mantle, our partition coefﬁcient calculations
for clinopyroxene cannot be used.
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
With the new high-pressure scaling law (15), it is now
possible to include partition coefﬁcient models depending on
pressure and temperature into mantle convection models for
the entire pressure range over which upper mantle melts are

buoyant. The newly developed ﬁt function can be used to
calculate clinopyroxene/melt redistribution behavior of sodium
starting from 4 GPa up to the mantle transition zone of the
Earth. This is in contrast to the scaling law by Blundy et al.
(1995) [13], which can be applied from 0 to 4 GPa. Our new
scaling law can be used as the basis for calculating Di in (1),
with D0=DNa for 1+ charge elements. Possible approaches to
model partition coefﬁcients based on this scaling law for the
charges 2+ to 4+ are described in Wood and Blundy (2014)
[41] and are based on adjusted calculations for the mineral’s
lattice site radius r0 and the bulk modulus E.
Compared to the existing experimental data, our scaling law
(15) allows for a good approximation of clinopyroxene parti-
tion coefﬁcients of trace elements between solid and melt. This
enables us to do self-consistent calculations of local partition
coefﬁcients for variable pressures and temperatures. Because
we have parametrised our model over a wide range of P-T
conditions and melt fractions between the peridotite solidus
and liquidus, our model can be applied for any Dcpx/melt
Na
calculation between 1850-2360 K and 4-12 GPa.
By combining our scaling law with the older scaling law
[13], we will be able to calculate the redistribution behavior
of trace elements in terrestrial planets in much more detail. Our
partition coefﬁcient calculations for clinopyroxene should be
applicable as long as clinopyroxene is present in the planet’s
upper mantle in sufﬁcient abundance.
Future works could not only include the application of our
new scaling law (15) in numerical simulations, but also further
investigations on partitioning behavior in mantle material as
well. For instance, adding an orthopyroxene/melt trace element
partitioning model to a mantle evolution model would provide
an even more detailed tool to study on the trace element
redistribution from mantle to crust if used alongside the
clinopyroxene/melt partitioning model.
