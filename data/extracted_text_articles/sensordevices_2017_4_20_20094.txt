Abstract—Among copper oxides, Cu2O is intensively studied 
due to its high optical absorption coefficient and relatively 
good electrical properties. Copper oxide thin films properties 
depend on the deposition method as an effect of detailed 
arrangement of Cu and O atoms that induce different physical 
properties. Cu2O is a p-type semiconductor having a band gap 
sufficiently close to the optimal band gap under AM1.5 
radiation spectrum, which makes it an attractive material for 
photovoltaic applications and solar cells. The structural and 
morphological properties of deposited thin films were 
investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and 
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The thin film thickness and 
optical 
constants 
were 
determined 
by 
Spectroscopic 
Ellipsometry (SE). The purpose of the paper was to study the 
technological possibilities of preparing high quality Cu2O thin 
films, used in photovoltaic applications. The sputter-deposited 
Cu2O thin films presented in this work show good potential as 
absorber layers for photovoltaic applications.

 INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) has been 
intensively studied due to its high optical absorption 
coefficient and favorable electrical properties. Cu2O thin 
films properties are depending on the deposition method, as 
a result of the detailed arrangement of Cu and O atoms that 
induce different physical properties. Several methods can be 
used to prepare Cu2O thin films, including thermal 
oxidation, chemical vapor deposition, plasma evaporation, 
reactive sputtering, and electrodeposition [1][2]. It has been 
reported that most of these synthesis methods result in a 
combined growth of Cu2O and CuO phases, which is 
unfavorable in photovoltaic applications. Cu2O is very 
promising candidate for solar cell applications as it is a 
suitable material for photovoltaic energy conversion [2]. In 
this work, we analyze Cu2O thin films, deposited on SiO2 
and quartz substrates by magnetron sputtering. The purpose 
of the paper was to study the technological possibilities of 
preparing high-quality Cu2O thin films for photovoltaic 
applications. 
The optical transmittances of the films show a strong 
dependence on the flow rate during deposition [1]. 
Ohajianya and Abumere [3] show that the efficiency of 
Cu2O/Cu solar cell increases as the thickness of the Cu2O 
decreases, up to a limiting thickness of 26.30 µm, after 
which the efficiency decreases as the thickness decreases.  
This paper is organized as follow: Section I. Introduction 
presents the applications of cuprous oxide (Cu2O); Section 
II. describes the method for preparing copper oxide thin 
film; Section III. describes the structural investigations; 
Section IV. presents the results of the research, and the 
paper concludes in Section V.

CUPROUS OXIDE THIN FILM PREPARATION METHOD 
 Cu2O is a p-type semiconductor having a band gap 
sufficiently close to the optimal band gap under AM1.5 
radiation spectrum, which makes it an attractive material for 
photovoltaic applications and solar cells. 
Cu2O thin films were deposited on 1 × 1 cm2 quartz and 
silicon substrates by a direct current (DC) magnetron 
sputtering system (Semicore Triaxis). The quartz substrates 
were cleaned in piranha and rinsed in deionized water. The 
substrates were dried with nitrogen and loaded into the 
deposition chamber. Cu2O was deposited by reactive 
sputtering of Cu target (99.999%) in O2/Ar (6/49 sccm) with 
a substrate temperature of 400 ºC. The power density was

fixed at 2.2 W/cm2, and experimentally established. During 
the magnetron sputtering deposition, the base pressure was 
kept below 3.0 x 10-7 Torr and the sample stage was rotated 
at a constant speed of 12 rpm. The Cu2O thin films were 
deposited in two different thickness ~ 200 nm and ~ 500 nm 
with a deposition rate ~ 25 nm/min. As-grown Cu2O films 
were annealed at 900 ºC for 3 minutes in vacuum (pressure 
~10-1 Torr) in order to enhance the optical and electrical 
properties [4]. 
III. 
STRUCTURAL INVESTIGATIONS 
The structural and morphological properties of deposited 
thin films were investigated by SEM and AFM. The thin 
film thickness and optical constants were determined by SE. 
Several variants of Cu2O thin film preparation have been 
considered, resulting in films of approximately 200 nm and 
500 nm thickness.

RESULTS 
The structural and morphological properties of deposited 
thin films were investigated by SEM and Atomic Force 
Microscopy AFM. The thin film thickness and optical 
constants were determined by SE. 
A. Scanning electron microscopy 
SEM images of 200 nm and 500 nm film deposited on 
SiO2 substrate are shown in Figures 1 and 2. For 200 nm 
films, the grain size is around 30 to 40 nm (Figure 1) and 
rarely more than 60 nm. For films of thickness 500 nm the 
grain size increased to 60 - 70 nm (Figure 2).

Figure 3 presents SEM images for Sample 5 and Sample 
6, deposited on quartz substrate. It is noticeable that for the 
Cu2O thin film on quartz, average grain size increases from 
~70 nm for the as-grown film to ~600 nm for the annealed 
film [4].  
The size of the grains depends on the thickness of the 
films deposited and the type of substrate material. For the 
SiO2 substrate it is noticeable that the grains deposited are 
more uniform and smaller than the films deposited on the 
quartz. 
For the quartz substrate, increasing the thickness of 
Cu2O films, from 200 nm to 500 nm, also increases grain 
size.

B. Atomic force microscopy 
In order to study the effect of the deposition condition 
on the morphology of the Cu2O thin film, the morphologies 
of all samples have been analyzed using an Atomic Force 
Microscope (AFM), (INNOVA, Veeco Company). For the 
data acquisition, we used an AFM probe model RTESPA, 
doped with Si and for image analysis we used Scanning 
Probe Microscopy with special SPM Lab Analysis v.7.0 
software (from Veeco Company). The scanning was made 
in tapping mode and the scanning speed was about 2.5 µm/s 
on a surface area of 10×10 µm2. The AFM images had a 
resolution of 512×512 pixels. For all the samples, the AFM 
images were performed first on 30×30 µm2 area and then on 
the 10×10 µm2 area, representing the cleanest zone of the 
large area. 
AFM data analysis allows quantitative information to be 
extracted on surface roughness. A systematic description of 
various 
analytical 
methods 
used 
for 
roughness 
characterization can be found in [5]. The root-mean square 
roughness (RRMS) is defined as the standard deviation of the 
surface height profile from the mean height, (1).

where N is the number of pixels in the image (or data 
points), hi is the height of the ith pixel, and h is the mean 
height of the image [5]. 
The AFM has been employed to determine the 
morphology, the grain size and the root mean square (RMS) 
surface roughness of all deposited films at 400 oC as-grown 
for 200 nm and 500 nm thicknesses of films, and annealed 
at 900 0C for 200 nm and 500 nm thicknesses of films. 
The 2D and 3D AFM images of Cu2O thin films 
deposited at different conditions show the surface 
morphologies of the films (Figures 4 to 8). Generally, we 
found that an increase in the thickness of Cu2O films 
potential results in an increase of the grain size and RMS 
surface roughness, as shown in Table II.

Sample 6

For the same thickness of 500 nm, the roughness on Si 
substrate is smaller than the roughness on quartz. Sample 6 
has the greatest RMS roughness.  
Generally, during the Cu2O film making, we found that 
an increase in film thickness and the treatment temperature 
increase the grain size and implicitly the roughness of the 
films. 
Samples 2 and 4 had similar roughness, the coating was 
not influenced by the two selected substrates (Si and quartz 
substrates). However, we notice that the coating on Si 
substrate (Sample 2) had more dense and compact columns, 
compared with Sample 4.  
After the film deposition at 400 °C, it was observed the 
fine structure for the coatings on Samples 3 and 4, 
emphasized by the low roughness values (1.58 nm, 
respectively 7.95 nm). 
The annealing at 900 °C, 3 min in vacuum led to an 
increase of roughness for both samples with different layers 
thickness deposited on quartz substrate (Samples 5 and 6). 
Sample 6, with a thickness of 500 nm, after the 
annealing, presented the largest grains size and therefore the 
highest value of roughness parameter (20.60 nm). 
 
C. Spectroscopic ellipsometry 
 
Spectroscopic 
ellipsometry 
and 
reflectivity 
measurements are used for determination of Cu2O film 
thickness [6]. 
For determination of the optical properties of the Cu2O 
films, a layer-by-layer growth model was used as presented 
in Figure 9 [7]. In the calculation process, optical constants 
of each material in the respective layer are cited from the 
literature. The surface roughness is modeled by mixing the 
optical constants of surface material (Cu2O) and 50% air 
(i.e., n = 1 and k = 0) as shown in Figure 9.  
 
 
 
Figure 9. Schematic illustration of 3-layer model for oxidized Cu layer on 
quartz substrate [7]. 
We used the UVISEL Spectroscopic Ellipsometer 
equipment from HORIBA Jobin Yvon in the spectral range 
190-2100 nm [8]. All calculations were performed using 
DeltaPsi vs 2.6 software. 
Tan Ψ and cos Δ spectra were modeled until the best fit 
was obtained. The model consists of a main copper oxide 
layer with a surface roughness layer and an interlayer layer 
above the (Qz / Si) quartz / Si substrate. The Tauc - Lorentz 
dispersion law was used for the Cu2O layer, while the 
surface roughness layer was formed by one layer of Cu2O, 
CuO and voids. The model used is shown in Figure 10.

CONCLUSIONS 
Characterization of sputter-deposited Cu2O thin films by 
scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy 
showed that the average grain size and the RMS surface 
roughness increases with film thickness. Spectroscopic 
ellipsometry measurements showed that annealing of the 
Cu2O film at 900°C reduces optical absorption, i.e., the 
extinction coefficient is reduced, presumably as a result of 
increased grain size [4]. In conclusion, the sputter-deposited 
Cu2O thin films presented in this work show good potential 
as an absorber layer for photovoltaic applications.
