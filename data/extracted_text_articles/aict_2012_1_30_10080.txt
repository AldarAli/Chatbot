Abstract—This paper proposes a novel management algorithm
for distributed antenna systems (DASs) that exploits the spatial
diversity of the distributed architecture in order to schedule (over
the same radio resource) as many transmissions as possible with
the most appropriate modulation and coding schemes (MCSs).
This goal is achieved by implementing a joint user scheduling and
link adaptation algorithm (including power control and adaptive
modulation and coding) that allows for an appropriate man-
agement of intra-cell interference. The algorithm provides the
optimum set of scheduled users, the optimum serving nodes, the
transmit power levels, and the MCSs that maximize the capacity
of the system. In comparison with conventional approaches,
where the objective is to maximize the signal-to-interference-
plus-noise ratio (SINR) of each user, in this paper the target
is to satisfy a given SINR value that ensures the transmission
of the chosen MCS with a particular value of block-error-rate
(BLER). To achieve this goal, an iterative optimization scheme is
proposed in which the set of scheduled users, the power levels,
and the MCSs are modiﬁed according to channel and interference
conditions. A novel method for the calculation of outer-cell inter-
ference in multi-cell conﬁgurations is also proposed. Imperfect
channel state information is used throughout the system-level
simulation work. Simulation results show considerable gains in
terms of throughput and reduced power consumption per node
when compared to conventional systems, thereby making the
proposed algorithm suitable for green energy solutions.

I. INTRODUCTION
Future wireless networks will make use of advanced al-
gorithms to cope more efﬁciently with harsh propagation
conditions and increasing bandwidth demands. In addition,
networks need to be energy efﬁcient and reduce as much
as possible dangerous emissions to comply with future reg-
ulations regarding health safety and green energy. Over the
last few years, multiple antenna technology (also known as
multiple-input multiple-output or MIMO) has attracted lots of
attention from the research community as a good candidate
for boosting the performance of future wireless networks
[1]. MIMO systems have the ability to increase the capacity
of wireless channels without the need of using additional
bandwidth for data transmission [1]. However, due to size and
space limitations of user terminals and base stations (BSs)
MIMO suffers from the problem of high correlation between
the signals of the antenna elements. A solution to this problem
can be found in the area of distributed antenna systems (DAS).
As compared to co-located antenna systems (CAS), where all
antennas are co-located at the central BS, in DASs the antennas
or nodes are geographically distributed within the cell [2],
thereby reducing access distance to the user and minimizing
correlation problems.
Distributed antenna systems were conventionally studied
as simple signal relay solutions to improve coverage in in-
door locations [3]. However, over the last years, distributed
systems have been investigated under more advanced MIMO
and multiuser detection schemes. The capacity of DASs with
CDMA (code division multiple access) in single cell scenarios
has been investigated in [4]. The authors found that capacity
gains can be achieved in the down-link by simple selecting
for transmission the antenna with the best conditions. By
contrast, uplink capacity was maximized by using multiple
antenna processing (i.e., multi-user detection). Focusing also
on capacity analysis, the work in [2] has proposed a down-link
DAS multi-cell scenario with a single user. Two transmission
schemes were analyzed: blanket, in which all the antennas
assist in the transmission process, and antenna selective, where
only the antenna with the lowest path-loss value is selected for
transmission. Perfect knowledge of channel state information
(CSI) at the transmitter and/or at the receiver was assumed
in the analysis. The antenna selective scheme was shown to
provide the best performances. Optimum power allocation for
DAS in multi-cell environments with a single user has been
addressed in [7] and [8].
Despite this extensive work on the physical layer of dis-
tributed antenna systems, cross-layer issues such as the design
of channel-aware scheduling and resource management algo-
rithms remains relatively unexplored. To partially ﬁll this gap,
the work in [5] has analyzed two basic schedulers: round robin
and maximum-carrier-to-interference (MCI) for the down-link
of distributed systems under different values of trafﬁc load and
transmit power. The study has concluded that antenna selective
schemes provide considerable gain margins as compared to
other solutions, particularly when using round robin schedul-
ing. Relatively less gains were reported in the case of MCI
scheduling due to its multiuser diversity properties. Improving
on this previous work, a novel packet scheduler for the down-
link of DAS using power control has been proposed in [6].

This solution aims to select a different user for each distributed
antenna and then optimize the antenna power levels in an
iterative way in order to comply with a prescribed signal-to-
interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each scheduled user.
The results showed that the algorithm provides considerable
gains in terms of packet throughput that escalate with the
number of distributed antennas/nodes inside the central cell.
This paper proposes a further improvement over the algo-
rithm presented in [6] by using different thresholds for differ-
ent modulation and coding schemes (i.e., adaptive modulation
and coding). Therefore, the algorithm also attempts to schedule
a different user attached to each one of the nodes in the cell.
Each node initially selects the user with the higher channel
gain and attempts transmission with the highest possible mod-
ulation and coding scheme. Then, an iterative algorithm is used
to adapt the transmit power of each node and its associated
user in order to satisfy the SINR requirement of the selected
modulation and coding scheme. If at the end of this iterative
phase the SINR conditions of the scheduled users are not
satisﬁed, then either the modulation and coding schemes or the
set of scheduled users are modiﬁed. This scheme is repeated
until the conditions of all the scheduled users in the cell are
satisﬁed. In this way, the set of optimum scheduled users, their
transmit power levels, and modulation and coding schemes that
maximize system capacity are obtained for a particular time-
slot of the system. In order to calculate outer-cell interference,
the results of the power levels calculated in previous simulation
runs are reused in the outer-cells to replicate in a better way
the behavior of the algorithm at the system level. The results
show that the proposed algorithm improves considerably the
throughput of the system using lower values of transmit power
per node, thereby being suitable for green energy solutions in
future deployments.
The structure of this paper is as follows. Section II describes
the multi-cell deployment scenario and the propagation and
signal models to be used. Section III describes the proposed
algorithm and the optimization techniques. Section IV presents
the results of the simulation work. Finally, Section V draws
the main conclusions of the paper.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider the hexagonal multi-cell distributed antenna sys-
tem depicted in Fig. 1 with I +1 cells: one central cell (i = 0)
which will be the main target of analysis, and I surrounding
cells (i = 1, . . . , I), which will be used as simple sources of
outer-cell interference. Only one tier of surrounding cells will
be used (i.e., I = 6). Each hexagonal cell has a radius R
and consists of a total of L + 1 radiation nodes: one located
at the center of the cell (l = 0), and L distributed nodes
(l = 1, . . . , L) located at a distance Dr from the center of the
cell. The distributed nodes are spaced at uniform angles given
by θl =
2(l−1)π
L
. A conventional cellular system with one
centralized node can be characterized by substituting L = 0
in all the expressions in this paper. It is also assumed that
the distributed nodes are connected, via a dedicated link such
as a coaxial cable or optical ﬁbre, to the node at the center
of the cell where all decisions for user scheduling and power
allocation are taken.

Cellular Architecture for evaluation of DAS.
All the transmissions in the network are organized in time-
slots. Each transmission can use one of the M possible
modulation and coding schemes (MCSs). A set of J potential
users is considered to be randomly deployed in the central
cell of analysis every time slot of the system. The channel
between user j and the l-th node of the i-th cell of the
network will be denoted by hl,i,j. Channel envelopes of dif-
ferent users and different distributed nodes are assumed to be
statistically independent and with Rice distribution described
by the parameter K. This means that hl,i,j will be modeled
as a complex Gaussian variable with mean µ and variance σ2,
i.e. hl,i,j ∼ CN(µ, σ2), where K =
µ2
σ2 . The channels are
affected by a propagation path-loss model deﬁned by [9]:
LdB(l, i, j) = 20 log10(dl,i,j) + 44.3 + 20 log10
 f
5.0

, (1)
where dl,i,j is the distance (in meters) between user j and
the l-th node of the i-th cell of the network, and f is the
operational frequency in GHz. Shadowing is also considered
using a log-normal distribution with parameter σs = 3dB.
The signal transmitted by the l-th node of the i-th cell will be
denoted by si,l = [si,l(0), . . . , si,l(S − 1)]T , where S is the
number of symbols and (·)T is the vector transpose operator.
Assuming that the transmitted symbols have unitary power
(i.e., E[sH
i,lsi,l] = 1, where E[·] is the expectation operator
and (·)H is the hermitian transpose operator) and the transmit
power of the l-th node in cell i is given by Pl,i, then the signal
received by user j can be written as:
rj =

where vj = [vj(0), . . . , vj(S − 1)]T is the additive gaus-

v = 1. The signal-
to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) experienced by user j
in cell i given the transmission of the l-th node, which is also
in the i-th cell, is denoted by γl,i,j and can be mathematically
written as:
γl,i,j =
Pl,i|hl,i,j|2
1 + PL
n=0;n̸=l Pn,i|hn,i,j|2 + υi,j
,
j ∈ Ui
(3)
where υi,j = PI
k=0;k̸=i
PL
n=0 Pn,k|hn,k,j|2 is the outer-cell
interference when user j is incell i, and Ui is the set of users
located in the coverage area of cell i. Since all the decisions
for resource allocation, user scheduling and power control
will be taken at the central node, the available channel state
information is potentially inaccurate. In this paper we will
assume that the central node has perfect knowledge of long
term channel statistics, such as average power and the line-
of-sight component of the Rician-distributed channels, and
imperfect knowledge of the random fading component. The
channel variable available at the central node will be denoted
by ˆhl,i,j, and the accuracy of the channel state information
(CSI) will be characterized by a correlation coefﬁcient deﬁned
as ρ =
E[(ˆhl,i,j−µ)(hl,i,j−µ)]
σ2
. The SINR measured by the
central node in the cell will be then given by:
ˆγl,i,j =
Pl,i|ˆhl,i,j|2

n=0;n̸=l Pn,i|ˆhn,i,j|2 + ˆυi,j
,
(4)
where ˆυi,j is the estimated outer-cell interference for user j
in cell i.
III. ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION
The main objective of the algorithm proposed in this paper
is to multiplex/schedule as many users as possible over the
same frequency band while maximizing capacity in the cell.
Each user will be attached to each one of the distributed nodes
inside the cell (only one user per node). The algorithm aims
to optimize the power levels of the nodes as well as their
modulation and coding schemes in order to reduce interference
and maximize the throughput in the cell. The steps of the
algorithm can be described as follows:
1) Simulation is initialized
2) Users are placed in random positions across the central
cell.
3) For each one of the distributed nodes in the central cell
the best user is selected based on the measured channel
gain:
ul = arg max
j
|ˆhl,0,j|,
ul ̸= un,
, (n, l) ∈ {0, . . . , L}
4) For all the selected users the maximum possible modu-
lation and coding scheme is initially selected as well as
the maximum transmit power level per node Pmax.
5) Power levels required to satisfy the SINR of the modula-
tion and coding scheme of each scheduled user (denoted
by γ(mcs)
l,0,ul ) are updated using eq.(4):
˜Pl,0 =
γ(mcs)
l,0,ul (1 + PM
n=1;n̸=l Pn,0|ˆhn,0,ul|2 + ˆυ0,ul)
|ˆhl,0,ul|2
,
Pl,0 = min(Pmax, ˜Pl0),
l ∈ {0, . . . , L}
6) The actual SINR achieved by each user is obtained
based on the updated power levels using eq.(4). If all
the users have satisﬁed their required SINR level then
the algorithm jumps to the next step. Otherwise, the user
with the highest transmit power requirement must be
allocated with a modulation and coding scheme with less
SINR requirements. In case there is no other modulation
and coding scheme with less SINR requirement then the
user and the serving node are dropped from the set of
scheduled users/nodes (Pl,0 = 0). The algorithm then
goes back to step 4.
7) The power levels of the outer-cells (Pl,i, i ̸= 0) are
updated using the results of the central cell, and another
iteration is started by going back to step 2.
A ﬂowchart of the proposed algorithm describing these steps
is shown in Fig. 2.

IV. RESULTS
This section presents simulation results that show the bene-
ﬁts of the proposed algorithm. The main metric to be used is
throughput (T), which can be deﬁned as the ratio of the total
amount of bits successfully transmitted to the total time used
in the transmission of that information. In all the simulations,
the throughput is calculated by means of look up tables. Once
the instantaneous SINR of each user has been calculated, its
value is mapped into a look up table with thresholds for each
modulation and coding scheme. If the SINR surpasses the
threshold of the targeted modulation and coding scheme then
the information can be considered as correctly transmitted with
a given block error rate (BLER). The modulation and coding
schemes and their corresponding thresholds and BLER values
are shown in Table I. These modulation and coding schemes
correspond to the WiMAX system as given in [10] with a block
size of Q = 7200 symbols and a frame length of Fl = 5ms.
The mathematical expression for the instantaneous throughput

given that the SINR surpasses the targeted threshold is given
by:
T = (1 − BLER)B · Q · Rc
R · Fl
,
where Rc is the rate of the turbo code scheme, B is the
number of bits per constellation, and R = 6 is the repetition
coding rate [10]. The results obtained after 10,000 Monte-
carlo simulation runs are displayed in Fig. 3 for the average
throughput versus various values of the transmit power-to-
noise ratio ( Pmax
σ2v ) in dBs, using a Rice factor of K = 10dB
for the particular case of ρ = 1, i.e. a system with perfect
channel state information. In all simulations, J = 10 user
terminals, a cell radius of R = 500m and a node position
of Dr = 2/3R have been used. It can be observed in Fig.
3 that the proposed algorithm for DAS (L = 6) provides a
considerable gain in throughput over a conventional cellular
system (L = 0). To further illustrate these gains, Fig 4 shows
the throughput gain of the proposed algorithm with respect to
a conventional cellular system. It can be observed that at low
values of transmit power the gain reaches almost the maximum
theoretical value of L + 1 = 7 for MIMO systems, but it
reduces the performance for higher values of transmit power
to almost 2.5. In terms of power consumption, Fig. 5 shows
that the average transmit power per node in DAS using the
proposed algorithm is considerably lower (by almost 10dB)
than the power consumed by a conventional cellular system
without power control. To illustrate the statistical performance
of the iterative scheme, Fig. 6 shows the average number
of iterations required by the proposed scheme to reach the
optimum solution. It can be observed that higher number of
iterations are required for low values of transmit power (almost
70), while at low values of power, the number reduces to nearly
50. This means that the proposed algorithm can converge more
or less quickly to the desired solution. A method to speed up
the performance is by improving the initial conditions of the
iterative scheme by ﬁguring out which users will be likely
to be dropped, or by making a better guess of the MCS to
be used by a given terminal. Since the proposed algorithm
also aims to allow simultaneous user transmissions within the
cell, Fig. 7 displays the average number of scheduled users
per time-slot or TTI (time-transmission-interval). It can be
observed that at higher values of power more users can be
simultaneously served by the system, reaching a maximum
close to 4 scheduled users, which indicates that nearly 50% of
nodes are deactivated each TTI. To illustrate the advantages
of the algorithm in terms of the usage of higher order MCSs,
Fig. 8 shows the average usage of the top three MCSs in
Table I, where it can be observed that the algorithm allows
more frequent use of these MCSs.
To illustrate the effects of imperfect channel state infor-
mation, Fig. 9 shows the average throughput performance of
the proposed algorithm in DAS and for a conventional cellular
system versus different values of the correlation factor ρ using
a Rice factor of K = −∞ dB (Rayleigh fading) and a ﬁxed
value of transmit power-to-noise ratio of
Pmax
σ2v
= 95dB.
It can be observed that both schemes can be considerably

affected by the effects of imperfect CSI, particularly when
the correlation factor is below 0.9. The proposed algorithm
for DAS results more affected than a conventional cellular
system. At very low values of correlation factor (ρ < 0.7),
the performance can be slightly worse than the performance
of conventional cellular systems with perfect channel state
information. Therefore, it is important for the correct operation
of the proposed algorithm to have a reliable channel state
information to reduce throughput losses in Rayleigh fading
channels. Fig. 10 shows the average throughput performance
of the proposed algorithm in DAS and for a conventional
system versus different values of the correlation factor ρ using
a Rice factor of K = 10dB. As shown in Fig. 10, both schemes
can be affected by the effects of imperfect CSI when the
correlation factor is below 0.9. It can be observed that the
proposed algorithm is not affected as much as in the case of
Rayleigh fading. In fact, the performance is always higher than
that of the conventional cellular system. Theses results show
that the the proposed algorithm is more robust to the effects
of imperfect channel state information in environments with
good line-of-sight.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
This paper has presented a new algorithm for the optimiza-
tion of distributed antenna systems that allows the simultane-
ous transmission of several users attached to different nodes in
the cell with controlled power to reduce inter-cell interference
and with adaptive modulation and coding. The algorithm
shows that by controlling inter-cell interference based on a
cross-layer approach, high capacity gains can be achieved
by exploiting the spatial diversity of the distributed nodes
in the system. In addition, considerable power transmission
reduction can be achieved while preserving high throughput
gains, particularly in environments with good line-of-sight.

This feature makes the algorithm suitable for green energy
solutions. The results also show that the maximum gain is
close to the theoretical boundary of MIMO systems, which
is equal to the number of antennas in the system. It was also
observed during the simulation work that users that previously
were discriminated due to their poor channel conditions have
now more chance to get access to network resources. Analysis
of fairness for the proposed algorithm is an interesting future
research topic. Future works include the use of beam-forming
across different distributed nodes, the extension of the algo-
rithm to the uplink case, and also considering that users have
a ﬁnite buffer with data to be transmitted.
