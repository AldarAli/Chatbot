Abstract—The distribution of brightness of nighttime lights 
(NTL) at the Earth’s surface in the visible band of the 
electromagnetic spectrum is a new forward-looking data source 
for socio-economic studies. Visual and statistical analysis of this 
distribution in time and space requires new mathematical and 
geo-informational methods of cooperative processing of many 
raster images and vector data (geographical maps) together 
with socio-economic analytics. The current research develops 
new means of the spatiotemporal analysis, reveals basic 
problems of applied monitoring, and outlines forward-looking 
approaches to their solution.  
Keywords - remote sensing, nighttime lights, data mining, big 
data, spatio-temporal analysis, socio-economic applications. 
I. 
 SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS OF NTL DYNAMICS  
Basic data for the applied analysis of changes in Nighttime 
Lights (NTL) in the visible spectrum are received in the form 
of a continuous sequence of images from two constellations 
of 
American 
low-Earth-orbit 
heliosynchronous 
meteorological satellites DMSP and JPSS with a 1 km spatial 
resolution ([1], [2]). Monthly maps of the mean brightness of 
cloudless and moonless NTL created on the basis of 
VIIRS/DNB data were used for the analysis of statistics of 
changes in urban NTL. 
Figure 1 demonstrates an example of a monthly brightness 
distribution map of Moscow in the DNB channel. Yellow 
color corresponds to pixels with higher brightness, blue – to 
pixels with lower brightness. 
In order to create the map, the data range was compressed 
with the use of a logarithmic function. The obtained image 
was laid over a map in the Google Earth application. The map 
contains several distinct large objects: the Kremlin and city 
center are much brighter even after a logarithmic 
compression; blue color corresponds to large forest parks; 
major highways are clearly visible. Nevertheless, it is clearly 
seen that the borders of districts with high and low brightness 
are blurred. It is associated with the spatial resolution of 
images and the fact that detection coordinates (the center of a 
pixel in which the light source is reflected) differ from the 
coordinates of the source itself, so in the course of several 
flyovers one and the same light source corresponds to a 
“cloud” of detections with different coordinates.

spectrum channel. 
 
Figure 2 demonstrates an example of a time sequence of 
the mean brightness value of pixels obtained in Moscow, that 
was formed starting from January 2017 till July 2019. The 
graph is characterized by the absence of indications in several 
summer months because of sunlight contamination in the 
satellite images and an abnormal increase in brightness during 
winter months because of snow [3]. Manual exclusion of 
abnormal indications can ensure more precise results but has 
two significant drawbacks:

1) Subjectivity of the analysis. Different specialists can 
keep different months and consequently obtain different 
trends. It is hard to answer which trend is the right one and 
which is not; 
2) Labor intensity. If it is necessary to analyze several 
hundreds of cities, manual exclusion of indications will 
require large labor inputs.

OUTLIER REMOVAL IN NTL DYNAMICS  
We have automated the outlier removal with the help of 
the RANSAC algorithm [4]. The algorithm includes two basic 
steps: generation of a hypothesis and its testing. In the 
generation step, a random subset is chosen from the whole 
sample of data. It is supposed that the chosen subset does not 
contain any abnormalities. Optimal model parameters are 
selected for the chosen subset. The class of the model is 
defined beforehand. For example, if it is a linear model of the 
form ax + by + с = 0, it is necessary to evaluate the 
coefficients a, b and c. 
In the testing step, all points of the input sample are tested 
for abnormality. The process of testing depends on the 
examiner. For example, in the case of a linear model, it can be 
fulfilled on the basis of the distance between the point and the 
line of the examined model: if it is larger than a given 
parameter, then the point is considered abnormal.  
Once all points are tested for belonging to the model, the 
overall number of abnormal points is estimated. If at this 
iteration the number of abnormalities is the smallest one 
among all previous iterations, the result is saved as an 
intermediate one. If the number of iterations has not reached 
the limit (indicated by the examiner), a new iteration begins; 
otherwise, the intermediate result returns.  
Thus, while using RANSAC, it is necessary to define a set 
of parameters including: 
 
Model on the basis of which the data will be 
evaluated;           
 
Metric for the separation of points in the 
corresponding models and abnormalities;      
 
Number of iterations sufficient for the construction of 
a consistent model. 
In this case, we selected a linear model and used the 
distance between the point and the line as an abnormality 
filtration metric defined by the following formula:

where TH stands for the admission threshold, STD defines 
the root mean square deviation of the time sequence of the 
mean brightness indications of the examined city, and STD_M 
is the root mean square deviation of the time sequence of the 
mean brightness indications of Moscow. 
The result of the RANSAC algorithm application for 
Moscow are demonstrated in figure 3. Indications belonging 
to the model are marked by green points and the red line shows 
the linear trend.

(excluding Novomoskovsky Administrative Okrug, Troitsky 
Administrative Okrug, and Zelenogradsky Administrative Okrug). 
Figure 3 demonstrates that the algorithm excluded those 
points that corresponded to the increase in urban brightness in 
winter. However, apart from brightness increase, the 
observations from November 2017 were also excluded due to 
a downturn in the signal level, possibly due to the low cloud 
free coverage. The reason for such a significant downfall 
requires further examination but whatever it is, the question 
arises as to whether such months should be excluded from the 
calculations. 
In this case, a long time period is examined and the linear 
trend is consequently defined, so it is implied that the analysis 
is long-term and the changes are gradual. In this regard, it

seems logical to exclude both upward and downward 
abnormalities in the signal level.           
III. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF NTL DYNAMICS                      
A detailed analysis of changes in NTL over time can be 
carried out with the help of time sequences that are obtained 
by summing up and averaging the light sources’ brightness in 
a limited region over a short period of time.  
Mean brightness of the Nighttime Lights (MNL) indicates 
the mean level of artificial lighting in the examined area. For 
integral quantization values of the brightness of the DMSP / 
OLS sensor it is defined by the formula:                



where DNi is the i-th level of brightness (i = 0–26) in a 
DMSP/OLS image, Ci stands for the number of pixels that 
correspond to the given brightness color within the examined 
region.              
Figure 4 demonstrates a time sequence of indexes of the 
annual mean radiance MNLOLS in the vicinity of the city of 
Grozny for the period from 1992 to 2013. DNi images from 
different satellites F10 — F18 were compared with the use of 
cross-calibration according to the method [5]. The graph 
demonstrates downfalls in the brightness of the nighttime 
radiance during the First and the Second Chechen Wars and a 
stable positive trend in the postwar reconstruction period.   
 
 
Figure 4.  Time sequence of indexes of annual mean radiance MNLOLS in 
the vicinity of the city of Grozny, the Chechen Republic for the entire 
period of digital registration of nighttime images from the DMSP satellites 
from 1992 to 2013. 
To compare the time series of the NTL brightness in 
different regions, we use an index calculated on the map of 
NTL in an equal area projection (Area Corrected Total 
Nighttime Lights, ACTNL). ACTNL is used to compare the 
total brightness of night lights in regions located at different 
latitudes. 
We need to adjust the pixel area because the NTL are 
mapped on the grid with a regular 15 arcsec step in latitude 
and longitude. The choice of step is determined by the spatial 
resolution of the DNB channel of the VIIRS sensor, equal to 
750 × 750 m, which is about 20 arcsec at the equator [1]. A 
grid cell area of a fixed angular step will change with latitude 
when moving from angular to metric coordinates according to 
the law of cosine (decrease from the equator to the poles). 
Therefore, to correctly compare the total brightness of regions 
with equal area, but located at different latitudes, you have to 
introduce the trigonometric correction::    



where i defines the latitude at which the pixel with the 
index i is located within the region R on the map that is 
constructed in the latitude-longitude projection. 
We illustrate the potential of using the ACTNLDNB index 
for the analysis of regional socio-economic dynamics with 
changes in the total brightness of night lights from 2012 to 
2018 in three cities of Ukraine: Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk. 
Due to the possible straylight in the DNB sensor at these 
latitudes in summer, the analysis was carried out only for the 
mean brightness of lights calculated for the months when no-
straylight, cloud free, and low moon satellite images were 
available for each city.  
The vector boundaries of cities within which the monthly 
ACTNLDNB  index was calculated are shown in Figure 5. It also 
shows the time series of indices and their mean values for the 
period before and after the outbreak of armed conflict in 
eastern Ukraine in May 2014, in the zone of which Donetsk 
and Lugansk did fall, but Kiev did not. The results of the 
analysis are summarized in table 1. 
We use Student’s t-test to estimate the significance of 
changes in the mean values of the ACTNLDNB index before and 
after the outbreak of armed conflict in the Donbass. The null 
hypothesis assumes that the mean values for the monthly 
ACTNLDNB indices in the periods of time before and after the 
start of the conflict are equal. In other words, that the total 
brightness of the city lights has not changed. As follows from 
table 1, the null hypothesis is confirmed only for Kiev: despite 
a small negative trend, the average brightness before and after 
May 2014 can be considered unchanged. We get a different 
result for the total brightness of the lights in Donetsk and 
Lugansk. Here, with a confidence of 99.999%, a stepwise 
decrease in brightness is observed right after the outbreak of 
the military conflict in proportions of 0.6 and 0.47, 
respectively, to the pre-war level.

(middle) and Lugansk (bottom) from 2012 to 2018. Summer months with 
interference from straylight in the VIIRS sensor are excluded. 
 
Changes in the total brightness of nighttime lights are 
consistent with regional macroeconomic changes due to 
conflict. Macroeconomic estimates were obtained by German 
scientists Julia Bluszcz and Marica Valente in their work “The 
War in Europe: Economic Costs of the Ukrainian Conflict” 
[6], which used the “potential opportunities” approach to 
assess the impact of armed conflict in Ukraine on the GDP. 
The proposed approach is based on their Synthetic Control 
Method (SCM) developed in 2003 and refined in 2010. The 
authors assess the impact of armed conflict on GDP by 
determining the difference in the values of GDP before and 
after the war, extrapolated to years after the war. For this, a 
control group of countries not involved in the armed conflict 
is taken, and all parameters of the country under study (in this 
case, Ukraine) before the conflict are expressed through the 
parameters of these countries. It is further assumed that this 
ratio of parameters between Ukraine and the control group 
would have to be maintained in subsequent years if it were not 
for the armed conflict, and all changes in the found ratio were 
caused solely by military operations. 
Results from the counterfactual estimation by the synthetic 
control method indicate that the Donbass war led to a 
considerable decline of Ukraine’s economy. Namely, authors 
estimate that, due to this war, the country’s per capita GDP 
decreased by 15.1% (1438.90$) on average over the period 
2013-2017. Statistical significance of the causal estimates was 
estimated by multiple placebo tests, and robustness was 
checked by leave-one-out estimations, and confoundedness 
analyses. In particular, the 2009 gas disputes with Russia and 
the financial crisis in the same year may lead to overestimated 
causal effects. As a consequence, the estimated lower-bound 
of Ukraine’s per capita GDP foregone due to the war amounts 
to 12.7%. Additionally, authors show that the conflict affected 
the Donbass more severely than the other Ukrainian regions. 
Over the period 2013-2016, the per capita GRP of the Donbass 
provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk is found to be, on average, 
43% (4630$) lower compared to its synthetic counterpart not 
affected by the military conflict.  
CONCLUSION 
The current research presents new methods of 
visualization of changes in NTL brightness at the Earth’s 
surface underpinned by economic, sociologic, and political 
factors. A quantitative analysis of time sequences of the 
integral NTL brightness over a limited area in Russia is 
aggravated by interseasonal changes in albedo because of 
snow (see [3]). The current research provides a new method 
of distinguishing interseasonal abnormalities on the basis of 
the RANSAC algorithm. After the separation of abnormalities 
in NTL brightness associated with the regional climate, it is 
possible to apply pattern recognition for time sequences in the 
form of stepwise changes and trends associated with different 
socio-economic and political phenomena. This research 
presents the results of such analysis for Eastern Ukrainian 
cities affected by the military conflict since spring 2014.
