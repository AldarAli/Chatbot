Abstract—The objective of this research is to determine 
whether the blogosphere, as a type of social media platform, 
can be used to disseminate information regarding the socio-
political views and concerns of citizens within a community. As 
an example case, we focus on examining information relative to 
the Venezuelan community regarding the current Venezuelan 
socio-economic crisis. Are Venezuelan blogs being used to 
express quality of life concerns that are associated with the 
crisis? Are Venezuelans using blogs to discuss possible 
migration away from the region as a result of these concerns? 
The Blogtrackers tool was used to analyze almost 30,000 
Venezuelan blog posts collected between August 2003 and 
March 2017. Our analysis showed that the blogosphere is 
indeed being used as a platform for citizens to discuss these 
issues. We show how the posting frequency, sentiment, and 
keyword trends have changed over time relative to the changes 
in the socio-political landscape of the region. Of particular 
interest is the keyword trend analysis that shows that blogs are 
being used to discuss issues associated with quality of life 
factors and interest in migration away from Venezuela as a 
result of the crisis. We believe that this study can be used as a 
starting point to show the value of analyzing blogs in 
facilitating humanitarian assistance efforts.  
Keywords-blogosphere; situation awareness; socio-political; 
social media data analysis; migrant influx. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
Social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, 
YouTube, and blogs have changed the way citizens express 
and share their sentiments regarding socio-political situations 
within their communities, and have created a space for 
citizen 
journalism 
[14]. 
These 
new 
mediums 
of 
communication have also allowed for citizen sentiment to be 
channelized from the online forum to the streets in the form 
of public debates and protests. Tufekci and Wilson [27], for 
example, demonstrated that participation in protests, both 
before and on the first day of the Tahrir Square 
demonstrations was elicited by information that citizens 
posted on blogs, Facebook, and Twitter. 
A blog is a “personalized webpage, kept by the author in 
reverse chronological diary form” [10]. Blogs give people a 
social identity and are a medium for association, self-
expression, and dissemination of information [30]. Blogs can 
be a very effective way to gain an in-depth understanding of 
issues and events due to the fact that recording, revisiting, 
and reflecting on the past is possible through previous blog 
entries. The ability for readers to leave comments in an 
interactive environment is an important part of blogging.  
Blogs serve as an interactive platform for information 
exchange and discussion, and provide useful information 
about events. [2] Blogs serve as a way for citizens to gain 
situational awareness of the socio-political landscape of their 
environment, and data experts who track and analyze blogs 
can gain an understanding of the perspectives and intentions 
that exist among citizens. In this paper, the Blogtrackers tool 
[35] was used to analyze a large dataset of Venezuelan blogs 
to determine whether the blogosphere is being used to 
disseminate information about issues stemming from the 
Venezuelan socio-economic crisis, and, if so, how this 
content is changing over time. This information is 
particularly helpful for emergency responders, and policy 
and decision makers leading humanitarian assistance efforts. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
reviews the currently published literature regarding citizen 
use of social media platforms relative to the attainment of 
situational awareness of socio-political issues. Section III 
explains the methodology used such as the data collection 
process and the Blogtrackers tool. Section IV provides a 
discussion of the data analysis results. Section V concludes 
the study outlining future research directions.

LITERATURE REVIEW 
Next, we present a review of the literature relevant to this 
research. 
A. Informational Power of Social Media Platforms 
Many sources highlight the power of Social Media 
Platforms such as blogs, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to 
be effective tools for allowing citizens to engage in socio-
political 
scenarios 
such 
as 
obtaining 
information, 
disseminating information, participating in socio-political 
discussions, and becoming mobilized to act or to participate 
in 
impactful 
events 
[1][7][9][15][18][20][26][28][29]. 
Additionally, some sources focus on or add that the 
effectiveness of social media platforms as informational and 
motivational tools can be leveraged by organizations for 
crisis management and emergency response [6][7][18][21] 
[22][29][31][33]. Much of the literature highlights the power 
of social media platforms by using the example of the 2010 
protests in Egypt, followed by an Egyptian Revolution in 
2011, wherein the public used social media to communicate 
their dissatisfaction with socio-political issues such as 
22

SOTICS 2017 : The Seventh International Conference on Social Media Technologies, Communication, and Informatics

poverty, unemployment, corruption, high prices, repression, 
and human rights abuse [1][3][9][15][18][32]. 
B. New Media Versus Traditional Media 
Many sources refer to Social Media Platforms as “New 
Media” [1][19][26], “Participatory Media” [9][17], and 
“Modern Information and Communication Technologies 
(ICTs)” [1][3][26][32], and draw a contrast with “Traditional 
Media” platforms such as television, newspaper, and radio 
(especially state-controlled traditional media) [1][3][9][17] 
[18][19][26][28]. Valentini et al. [28]. showed that crises 
tend to be communicated or framed differently within the 
writings of new media (specifically blogs) than they are 
within the writings of traditional media. Some sources 
contend that citizens are increasingly using social media sites 
for obtaining and disseminating socio-political information 
due to the perceived or real incompetence of or censoring by 
state-owned media outlets [1][3][19]. 
C. A Focus on the Blogosphere 
A small pool of sources focuses specifically on blogs as a 
means for obtaining and disseminating socio-political 
information [3][5][26][28]. The number of blogs has been 
said to double every five months; they are easily found and 
can be accessed freely by anyone with an internet connection 
[26]. Al-Ani et al. [3] highlighted the power blogs played in 
mobilizing citizens during the Egyptian revolution of early 
2011. Blogs represent a “counter-narrative” to the 
government-controlled media especially during times of 
crisis, and provide a means to voice dissent and to challenge 
authoritative power [3]. Blogs provide a means to potentially 
develop and maintain a strong sense of community among 
citizens interested in certain themed topics [5]. Additionally, 
blogs often-times represent “citizen-based news sources” that 
challenge traditional media in terms of the ability to form 
public opinion [28]. The information posted on blogs and the 
commentary reactions to the posts, therefore, have become 
of increasing interest to social media researchers. 
D. Cybersecurity Issues 
Some sources highlight the potential cybersecurity issues 
related to the use of social media platforms for spreading 
situational awareness in terms of socio-political issues [12] 
[17][18]. Fearn [12] warns that “cybercriminals” are 
increasingly using programs called “bots” to attack social 
media users via Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube with 
negative comments and to spread disinformation or fake 
news via these platforms. Since the blogosphere is also a 
social media platform, the potential for blogs to be used 
nefariously by bots can be argued [17]. Goolsby et al. [17] 
also argue that social media can be used to broadcast “hoax 
messages”, which can “hide among the stream of natural 
messages and be accepted…”. 
E. Methodologies for Analyzing Blog Data 
A review of the literature shows a variety of 
methodologies for conducting data analysis on blog data. Al-
Ani et al. [3] utilized the technique of topic modeling on blog 
data to ascertain how blog topics changed over time between 
2004 and 2011. The topic modeling technique revealed time-
specific themes in the blog data that could then be compared 
with public events and citizen actions such as protests [3]. 
Berendt et al. [5] used text and graph mining to analyze blog 
data. The text mining revealed the word themes in the data; 
whereas the graph mining exposed the connections between 
the bloggers in terms of their use of these words/themes [5]. 
In addition to longitudinal content analysis, Valentini et al. 
[28] applied sentiment analysis to blog data wherein they 
attempted to assign the sentiment values of neutral, positive, 
or negative to each blog post. Their analysis revealed 
interesting time-relevant topics and associated sentiments, 
such as a strong lack of trust in public and private governing 
entities surrounding political issues [28]. 
F. Migration Potential Resulting from Socio-Political 
Crisis? 
Google [16] created an interactive data visualization for 
tracking the interest in migrating to various countries of 
destination from specific countries of origin. Of particular 
interest is the data visualization showing a ranking of 1 to 
211 based on user search counts about migrating to the 
United States from within a particular country. For example, 
Venezuela is “ranked 105 out of 211 countries for Google 
searches for immigration to the United States from 2014-
2015” [16]. According to numerous sources, Venezuelans 
are protesting against their government due to such reasons 
as unemployment or low income, lack of access to basic 
needs such as food and medicine for themselves and their 
children, and political corruption [13][18][23]. Although the 
Google search data visualizations [16] precludes many of the 
Venezuelan issues that have been recently reported, one can 
still ask the question of whether or not there is potential for 
Venezuelans to migrate away from the many problems that 
they have been experiencing in their specific socio-political 
crisis? An analysis of numerous active Venezuelan-specific 
blogs was conducted to provide some insights. 
III. 
METHODOLOGY 
Next, we present our proposed methodology. 
A. Data Collection, Cleaning, and Indexing 
Using the Blogtrackers tool, three steps were executed in 
order to crawl and collect the data from an identified set of 
Venezuelan blogs: (1) exploring the blog site, (2) crawling 
the blog site, and (3) cleaning and storing the data in a 
database for analysis and retrieval (Fig. 1). Hussain et al. 
provide a detailed explanation of the mechanics of the 
Blogtrackers tool in “Analyzing the Voices during European 
Migrant Crisis in Blogosphere” [34]. 
 
1) Exploring the blog site: Several blog sites were 
identified that specifically discussed issues relevant to 
Venezuela. Subsequently, each site was explored to 
determine whether their structure was ideal for use with the 
Blogtrackers tool. It was also important that the blog 
continually be focused on Venezuelan topics and contain 
23

SOTICS 2017 : The Seventh International Conference on Social Media Technologies, Communication, and Informatics

specific meta-data attributes for each post such as author, 
title, and date. 
 
Figure 1. Data collection process. 
 
2) Crawling the data: The Web Content Extractor 
(WCE) tool [36] (Fig. 2) was then used to collect data from 
each blog site. Once the crawler is set up, the tool begins 
from a set of seed URLs—the blog sites’ home pages—and 
advances through each blog post to extract all of the desired 
attributes. 
 
 
Figure 2. Web Content Extractor. 
 
3) Cleaning and Storing the Data: A three-step cleaning 
process was used. (1) Clean from within WCE by deleting 
empty fields and advertisement URLs. (2) Clean with SQL 
queries to select validated and verified data. (3) Clean with a 
script to standardize attributes, extract metadata, sentiments, 
and outbound URLs. 
B. Analyzing the Data with Blogtrackers 
Blogtrackers is a tool designed to explore the 
blogosphere and gain insights about events and how these 
events are perceived in the blogging community [25]. After 
setting up a Venezuelan blog tracker, five features of the 
Blogtrackers tool were used to analyze the resultant dataset.  
 
1) Posting Frequency 
The “Posting Frequency” feature was utilized to identify 
any unusual patterns in the blog postings. This aids in 
detecting real-time events that interested the blogging 
community. The user can click on any data point on the 
graph to get a detailed list of the named-entities mentioned in 
blog posts during that time-period. This feature also displays 
a list of active bloggers with number of posts. Fig. 3 shows 
the posting frequency for Venezuelan blogs from 2003 to 
2017. 
 
 
Figure 3. Change in Venezuelan blog posting trends from 2003 to 2017. 
 
2) Keyword Trends 
The “Keyword Trends” feature was used to provide an 
overall trend for keywords of interest. It helps track changes 
in topics of interest in the blogging community. The user 
can select any data point on the trendline to view all the 
blogs and a network of co-occurring named-entities. Fig. 4 
shows the keyword trends related to the ongoing 
Venezuelan socio-political crisis. 
 
 
Figure 4. Trends for keywords “Venezuela”, “Maduro”, “America” and 
“Economic crisis” for 2016. 
 
3) Sentiments and Tonality 
The “Sentiments and Tonality” feature was used to 
display the trend of positive and negative sentiments of 
blogs for a selected time-period (Fig. 5).  
 
 
Figure 5. Venezuelan blog sentiment trends for 2016. 
 
The sentiment and tonality features used were as defined 
by Pennebaker et al. [37][38] and as calculated by the 
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software [39]. 
Additionally, a data analyst can drill down by clicking on 
any point of interest and view radar charts (Fig. 6), which 
display tonality attributes such as personal concerns, time 
orientation, core drives, and cognitive process.

Figure 6. Tonality of two random Venezuelan blog posts. 
 
4) Influence 
The “Influence” feature was used to identify the 
influence of a blogger or post. Agarwal et al. discussed the 
concept of influence with regard to bloggers [2]. The 
“Influence” feature of the Blogtrackers tool can display the 
influence trends over time for the top 5 influential bloggers 
(Fig. 7). Clicking on a point on the trend line allows a 
deeper dive into the data by displaying the most influential 
posts for that period. Additionally, a user can explore the 
content themes of active-influential, inactive-influential, 
active-non influential, and inactive-non influential bloggers. 
 
 
Figure 7. Influence trend for top 5 bloggers for 2016. 
 
5) Additional Blog Info 
The “Additional Blog Info” feature was used to provide 
additional information about a specific blog. A dashboard-
like screen is presented to the user, revealing the posting 
trends and sentiments of the selected blogs, as well as a list 
of the underlying URLs and domains. Fig. 8 shows this 
feature being used to look at a specific blog from the 
database called, “Caracas Chronicles”. At a glance, we can 
see some interesting things about this particular blog; such 
as, it is most active on Monday’s; it was most active during 
the month of February in 2014, December in 2015, and 
April in 2016; and more negative sentiment in 2016 than in 
2015.

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
Next, we present the discussion of the results. 
A. Venezuelan Blog Database 
    To assess whether Venezuelan blogs were discussing 
issues related to the economic crisis in Venezuela, 40 blog 
sites were identified. The blogs were found using simple 
manual search techniques on various platforms, such as 
google.com, blogsearchengine.org, and fastblogfinder.com. 
The blogs were reviewed by our research team to ensure 
that they fit the structure required by the Web Content 
Extractor and the Blogtrackers tool. A final dataset of 
29,493 blog posts was obtained between August 27, 2003 
and March 26, 2017. A total of 177,870 links were extracted 
(120,296 being distinct links) from 13,590 domains and 
749,829 entities. The post sentiments were also extracted. 
Table 1 gives the language distribution for this dataset.

B. Posting Frequency of Venezuelan Blogs 
Fig. 9 shows a more detailed view of blog posting 
frequency from January 2015 to March 2017, which 
indicates a continuous increase. Specifically, blogging 
activity increased drastically between March 2016 and 
January 2017. This increase corresponds to news reports of 
hundreds of thousands of people beginning to take to the 
streets in protest during early September of 2016 [8].  
 
 
Figure 9. Change in Venezuelan blog posting frequency from January 2015 
to May 2017. 
 
C. Keyword Trendlines for Venezuelan Blog 
To further assess the extent of the impact of the crisis on 
Venezuelan citizens, the dataset was searched for quality of 
life keywords such as “need food”, “need water”, “need 
petrol”, “need medicine”, “high prices”, and “inflation”. The 
resultant keyword trendlines indicated that the occurrence of 
these quality of life factors fluctuated over time (Fig. 10). 
 
 
 
Figure 10. English keyword trendlines for various quality of life keywords 
over time. 
 
   Trendlines for the Spanish equivalents for these quality of 
life keywords were also generated (Fig. 11). For example, 
similar to the increase in blog posting frequency, the quality 
of life keywords trends figures each show a large increase in 
frequency beginning near early September of 2016 [8][4]. 
 
 
 
Figure 11. Spanish keyword trendlines for various quality of life keywords 
over time. 
 
    These quality of life keywords may represent a set of 
motivational factors leading to an interest in Venezuelan 
citizens migrating away from Venezuela. To explore this 
suggestion, we generated several trendlines for keywords 
such as “immigrate”, “migrate”, “emigrate”, and “leave 
Venezuela” (Fig. 12). The frequency of occurrence of the 
keyword, “leave Venezuela” seems to drastically increase 
between the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016. 
 
 
 
Figure 12. English Keyword Trendlines for various keywords that possibly 
indicate migration interest over time.

    Trendlines for the Spanish equivalents for these migration 
keywords were also generated (Fig. 13). It was revealed that 
the keywords “leave Venezuela” and “Venezuela” were 
almost identical, indicating that every time Venezuela was 
mentioned it was about leaving or migrating from 
Venezuela. As with the quality of life indicators, these 
migration-related keywords trends figures show a large 
increase in their frequency beginning in 2016, especially 
near early September. 
 
 
 
Figure 13. Spanish Keyword Trendlines for various keywords that possibly 
indicate migration interest over time. 
 
D. Timeline of Sentiments Among the Venezuelan Blogs 
Recall that Fig. 5 shows the prevailing sentiment of the 
blogs for a specific time period. Fig. 14 provides a more 
detailed and various view of how the sentiment of the 
Venezuelan blogs has changed over time. The graphical 
output appears to show a sharp shift to a prevailing positive 
sentiment in early January 2016. This could correspond to 
the Venezuelan leader, Nicholas Maduro, declaring a 60-day 
economic emergency for the region in order to give himself 
power “to pay for welfare services and food imports” [4]. 
Subsequently, however—and although many blog posts 
were identified as having a negative sentiment—the 
prevailing sentiment of the blogs has been positive for the 
past two years. This prevailing positive sentiment seems 
counterintuitive, as we expected to see a prevailing negative 
sentiment due to the ongoing Venezuelan economic crisis 
and continued reports of Venezuelan citizens protesting in 
the streets. Therefore, we believe that the concept of 
sentiment with regard to this dataset needs to be addressed 
further in future work involving a more detailed dataset and 
a possible revision of how sentiment is calculated. 
Consequently, for this paper, we can only conclude that the 
graphical output at this time does not seem to reveal any 
significant differences over time, and appears to only 
fluctuate along with the recorded count of blog posts.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 14. Change in sentiment of Venezuelan blogs over time. 
 
E. Tonality of Venezuelan Blogs 
    Recall that Fig. 6 displays the feature of Blogtrackers that 
shows tonality attributes of individual blog posts. For 
example, for two random Venezuelan blog posts in our 
dataset, the predominant personal concerns were “Work” 
and “Money”. The predominant time orientation was 
“Present focus”. The predominant attribute for core drives 
and needs was “Power” (and to a lesser extent 
“Achievement”). The predominant cognitive process was 
not as clear, varying among that of “Differentiation”, 
“Tentativeness”, and “Cause”. The predominant summary 
variable 
was 
“Analytical 
Thinking”. 
Finally, 
the 
predominant sentiment/emotion for this timeframe was 
“Anger”. We did not analyze the tonality feature further for 
this paper, but believe that the concept within the 
blogosphere should be examined in future work. 
F. Influential Venezuelan Bloggers 
Recall that Fig. 7 shows the top 5 influential bloggers for 
a specified time period. Blogtrackers calculates influence 
based on the blog characteristics of inlinks, outlinks, 
27

comment quality, and blog post content quality [25]. Fig. 15 
is another example of the feature, using January 2015 to 
March 2017 as the selected time-period of analysis. One 
blogger, “Daniel”, was consistently more influential than 
other bloggers. We did not analyze this feature further for 
this paper, but believe that the concept of influence within 
the blogosphere should be examined in future work.

to March 2017. 
 
V. 
CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 
This paper establishes the basis for using blog analysis 
for studying socio-political awareness. This approach is 
novel in that few researchers have specifically focused on 
analyzing blogs, and instead focus on other social media 
platforms, such as Twitter and Facebook. As a detailed 
example, this research showed that Venezuelan blogs are 
being used to disseminate socio-political information in an 
attempt to increase awareness during the Venezuelan 
economic crisis. Our analysis showed that the frequency and 
content of posts changed over time, reflecting changes in the 
socio-political landscape of the region—such as protest 
events, the decline in quality of life factors such as the need 
for food and medicine, and interest in migration away from 
Venezuela. The sentiment of the blogs seemed to change 
over time as well, but the graphical output was inconclusive 
and the concept needs to be addressed further in future work. 
We believe, however, that blog analysis—with Blogtrackers 
and other tools—can continue to be used to gauge socio-
political awareness of important issues. This paper sets the 
stage for future work using Blogtrackers and other natural 
language processing tools and techniques for blog analysis as 
a possible approach for anticipating events (e.g., protests, 
migration, refugee scenarios). Future work may also include 
further analysis of the concepts of blog tonality and blogger 
influence. Broadly speaking, this particular study sheds a 
spotlight on the blogosphere’s role in assessing situation 
awareness of a region engulfed in socio-political crisis. This 
information can provide actionable insights to emergency 
responders, humanitarian assistance organizations, policy 
and decision makers.
