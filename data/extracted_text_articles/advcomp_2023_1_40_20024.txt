Abstract—The structure of the current public transport net-
work is the result of many different political, economical and soci-
etal decisions over a long period of time. Further developments of
these networks require exhaustive analysis of the actual topology
and its properties in order to achieve significant improvements. In
this work, a statistical analysis and graph theory approach of the
multimodal transport network of the Bay of Cadiz is proposed.
First, the statistical characteristics of centrality and robustness
of the global network are calculated. Later, the influence of
specific means of transport on the complete public transport
network is analyzed by comparing these parameters against
different subnetworks where one or more transport networks
have been eliminated. The results obtained evince the importance
and influence of the different transport networks in the Bay
of Cadiz, highlighting those presenting high robustness on the
overall network, as well as those whose influence is limited.
Index Terms—Multimodal transport network; public transport
efficiency; graph theory; centrality and robustness metrics.
I. INTRODUCTION
Society is currently experiencing the migration of popula-
tion to big cities world wide. It is forecasted that by 2050
over 66 % of the population will live in urban areas [1].
This fact brings many opportunities but also many challenges
that governments need to face to overcome traffic congestion,
spatial inequalities and promote sustainability and economic
development [2]. Among many other issues, an in-depth study
of the Public Transport System (PTS) is essential for the devel-
opment of cities to make them more efficient, sustainable and
attractive to users, thus reducing traffic congestion, pollution
or noise, and making cities more livable.
However, their design, planning and expansion of PTSs are
not straightforward due to the demands of all actors involved.
For example, quality of service and passenger comfort are
essential to increase ridership. Low operational cost is required
to make it profitable for the operator. Efficiency is required
not only to reduce operational cost but also to address sus-
tainability, as well as connectivity between different transport
networks [3].
Public transport networks can be studied or assessed from
different points of view, such as trip and route planning,
user ease of use, or graph theory, among others [4]. In the
latter, transport networks are represented as a graph, whose
nodes and edges determine the shape and composition of the
network. The nodes represent the transport stops; while the
edges represent the route between stops.
Multimodal transport is defined as the process of trans-
porting a person/goods between two distant points using
two or more modes of transport. It is experiencing a great
development around the world because of its high flexibility
and efficiency and low cost and energy consumption [5].
In this work, we propose an analysis of the multimodal
public transport network of the Bay of Cadiz, including
train, tram, boat, urban and interurban bus networks. Different
characteristic parameters of the network topology are obtained
and compared against different subnetworks where not all
the means of transport are presented. The results obtained
demonstrate the level of network connectivity, as well as the
effect of extracting one or more transport networks and the
influence of such extraction. Thus, the relevance of each of
them and the connections between the different stops of the
targeted network are checked.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: the
most relevant related works are briefly presented in Section II;
the methodology used is introduced in Section III; Section IV
shows the results obtained; and finally, Section V reflects the
main conclusions and outlines some future research lines.
II. RELATED WORKS
The study of multimodal transport networks has been widely
addressed in the literature. He et al. [6] study freight transport
in the Netherlands, focusing on road, river and rail transport,
obtaining a series of critical nodes essential for the stability
of the network structure, thus obtaining the key areas of
the network. Wang et al. [7] study the multimodal transport
network of the China-Europe Railway Express, obtaining that
the transfer between road and rail manages to alleviate the
cascade failures that can occur. Tympakianaki et al. [8] study
the effect of tunnel closures on the Stockholm transport
network, resulting in the need for network redistribution to
avoid traffic management problems for the city. Guo et al. [5]
analyse the multimodal transport network of the Sichuan-Tibet
(China) region of rail, road and air to place emergency rescue
facilities, concluding that the whole network should be taken
into account, especially at the most important nodes and links.
Graph theory has been also applied to analyze transport
networks. In [9], the Madrid metro network is analysed
through centrality and robustness parameters, focusing on
closeness centrality and cluster coefficient. As a result, the

vulnerability of the entire network is obtained, as well as the
identification of the most important stops to achieve robustness
in the network. Similarly, Mari˜nas Collado et al. [10] carried
out a study of the Barcelona metro network using indicators
of robustness, cluster coefficient and average efficiency. Thus,
they obtained the characteristics of the different stops with
the aim of obtaining a specific analysis to plan and restructure
the network in search of better viability. Derrible makes use
of graph theory in [11], to study the centrality of the metro
network of various cities, focusing on centrality measures in
search of future efficiency improvement for network planning
and sustainable cities. Frutos Bernal et al. [12] analyze the
Madrid metro network in terms of centrality measures to
verify the location of the different stops, showing that the
stops in the center of the city are those with greater centrality
and, therefore, greater connection. Cats [13] analyzes the
historical evolution of the multimodal rail transport network
(tram, light rail, metro, high-speed express connections and
local, suburban and regional trains), focusing on the efficiency
and centrality of the nodes. In this way, it shows how it
is affected by the technological factor in search of better
connectivity, taking into account the increase in urban centres
and population growth.
III. METHODOLOGY AND CASE OF STUDY
The metropolitan area of the Bay of Cadiz comprises 12
municipalities, with a total of 823,806 inhabitants [14] [15].
These towns are: Cadiz (CA), El Puerto de Santa Mar´ıa (PSM),
San Fernando (SF), Puerto Real (PR), Jerez de la Frontera (JF),
Chiclana de la Frontera (CF), Rota (RO), Conil de la Frontera
(CoF), Arcos de la Frontera (AF), Chipiona (CH), Sanl´ucar
de Barrameda (SB), and Medina Sidonia (MS). As it can be
seen in Figure 1, they are all located in the province of Cadiz,
south-west of Andalucia (Spain).
Fig. 1. Location of the municipalities that form the Bay of Cadiz in Andalusia,
Spain.
These municipalities are scattered across the territory and
require urban and interurban transport systems to interconnect
them and meet passenger demands. The Transport Consortium
of the Bay of Cadiz operates a transport network comprising
train, boat, tram and bus services, both at urban and interurban
level. The stops of the train, tram and boat networks are
outward and return, thus providing two-way journeys. For the
rest of the networks, any stop only refers to one way trip,
because they are generally circular lines (see [15] [16] for
more detailed information). Table I shows the different types
of transport offered in each of the cities [16].

The representation of the public transport network of the
Bay of Cadiz has been determined using the L-Space method
initially proposed in [17] [18]. In this method, the nodes
represent stops, while the edges represent the given connection
between two nodes of a route. The multimodal transport
network is represented as a directed graph G = (V, E), where
the set of nodes (V = {v1, v2, ..., vN}) corresponds to the
different transport stops, and the trips between any two stops
correspond to the set of directed edges (E). The adjacency
matrix of G, AG is an asymmetric matrix of size N x N,
where each entry aij equals 1 if there is a mean of transport
that offers trip that goes from stop vi to stop vj, 0 otherwise.
Figure
2 shows the resulting graph of the complete public
transport network in the Bay of Cadiz using Matlab software.
Fig. 2. Resulting graph of the complete public transport network in the Bay
of Cadiz.
In order to study the relevance of the different modes of
transport that constitute the multimodal network, a set of sub-
networks has been created based on the combination of the
different existing transports. Specifically, three categories or
groups have been considered. They are explained next, and

shown in Figure 3. Group A is composed of the different
possible combinations that can be obtained from the different
interurban networks of the set (train, tram, boat). Group B
is related to the interurban bus network and two subgroups
are possible. First, the global network is analyzed without the
interurban network. Second, only the interurban is considered.
Regarding group C, two possible subgroups are considered. On
the one hand, all the means of transport are included except the
urban bus networks for all cities. On the other hand, there are
twelve subgroups C, one per each city whose urban network
is not included.

where ”W/” stands for ”Without” and ”O/” stands for ”Only”.
A. Statistical and robustness parameters
The analysis of a transport network involves examining
specific data about its structure, including relevant statistical
and robustness parameters [19] [20]. Next, the most relevant
features analyzed in this work are presented:
• The density (d) of the network is a measure of the number
of existing connections in relation to the total number of
possible connections in the network.
d =
E
V (V − 1)
(1)
• The frequency distribution of degree (P(k)) in a network
assigns to each degree k the number of nodes that have
that value, describing the proportion of nodes in the
network with that value.
P(k) = Vk
V
(2)
Where Vk is the number of nodes with degree k in the
graph, and V is the total number of nodes given. Graphs
with a more uniform degree distribution tend to have a
higher normalised robustness indicator compared to those
with a more heterogeneous distribution. The value of this
is higher when more alternative routes are available, and
lower when the system is larger.
• The diameter (D) of a graph is defined as the longest
distance between any pair of nodes in the network,
representing the longest path.
• The closeness centrality Cc(i) is defined as the proximity
to all other nodes in the graph. It is calculated as stated
in ( 3), where d(i,j) is the shortest distance from node i
to node j; while d(j,i) is the shortest distance from node
j to node i.
Cc(i) =
1
P
j̸=i(d(i, j) + d(j, i))
(3)
Nodes with a higher closeness are considered more influ-
ential in the network, occupying a more central position.
In this way, it is possible to identify those that are most
relevant to the connection in the graph.
• The betweenness centrality (Bci), measures the degree to
which a node is on the shortest path between other pairs
of nodes in the network, i.e., the number of times a node
acts as an intermediary in communication. It is calculated
as stated in ( 4), where σjk is the total number of shortest
paths between nodes j and k, and σjk(i) is the number
of such paths passing through node i.
Bci =
X
j̸=i̸=k
σjk(i)
σjk
(4)
Nodes with high betweenness centrality occupy strategic
positions in the network, so their removal can have a
significant impact on the connectivity and efficiency of
the network.
• The average efficiency (E[ 1
H ]), represents the overall
communication capacity of a network by calculating the
average of the efficiencies of all the pairs of nodes that
make it up as shown in ( 5), where d(vi, vj) is the shortest
path distance between nodes vi and vj of the network,
using
1
V (V −1) as the normalisation factor.
E[ 1
H ] =
1
V (V − 1)
V
X
i,j=1,i̸=j
1
d(vi, vj)
(5)
The efficiency of a pair of nodes is defined as the inverse
of the shortest distance between them. It ranges between
0 and 1. The higher the value of this parameter, the higher
the robustness of the analysed network because it refers
to the survivability against random failures or deliberate
attacks involving the removal of nodes and links [20]
[21].
• The normalised robustness indicator (¯rT ), which ranges
from 0 to 1, evaluates the resilience of a network to
failures and its ability to maintain connectivity. ¯rT is
given by the ratio between the number of alternative
routes in the network and the total number of nodes [20],
from the total number of edges E and the number of
nodes V.
¯rT =
ln(E − V + 2)
ln( V (V −1)
2
) − V + 2

• The global cluster coefficient parameter (Gc) indicates
how neighbours of a given node are connected to other
nodes, ranging between values of 0 and 1.
Gc = 1
V
V
X
i=1
Gc(vi)
(7)
Where Gc(vi) represents the individual cluster coefficient
of each node, while V means the total number of nodes.
The clustering coefficient reflects the fault tolerance ca-
pability, so as the value of Gc increases, the local fault
tolerance increases.
The use of the aforementioned statistical and robustness
parameters, in addition to the basic statistical parameters of
standard deviation σ applied to degree distribution, have been
used to compare the subgraphs versus the global network.
Thus, by extracting one or several transport networks, the
relevance of each transport system on the global network is
evaluated.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This section first presents an analysis of the global mul-
timodal network and then evaluates the influence of each
subgroup on the complete network once the following are
extracted from it.
A. Analysis of the complete Multimodal Public Transport
Network of the Bay of Cadiz
First of all, the density d of the network studied, indicates a
poorly connected network according to (1), with this value be-
ing approximately 0.00183. In comparison with other national
transport networks, such as the metro networks of Madrid
and Barcelona, which have values of 0.009421 and 0.0157
respectively [9] [10], the connectivity of the Bay’s multimodal
transport network is lower. This result is reasonable because
the targeted network is a multimodal transport network where
more than one type of transport is studied.
In terms of the node degree, the studied multimodal network
presents a highly variable value varying from 80 to 2. The
average degree of the network is ⟨k⟩ ≈ 4.867, meaning that
most of the nodes has a low degree value. In Figure 4, the
distribution degree P(k) is shown.
As it can be seen in Figure 4, most of the nodes are
concentrated in the first grades, being connected to at least two
nodes. This is the most frequent grade (about 60%) although
the average is 4.867. It is followed by grade 4 with a little
more than 20%, i.e. the stops with the possibility to change
route. After that, the decrease in percentage for the following
grades occurs from grade 10 onwards, being less than around
2%.
Table II shows the five nodes with the highest degree values.
As it can be seen, the station of Jerez presents the highest
value, 80. Indeed, this node is included in three different
means of transport (urban, interurban and train) and in many
different lines in each of them. Table II also shows that there
are two more locations in the overall network with a high

(in both directions), the latter being where the Cadiz hospital
is located.

The diameter of the network is 73, representing the longest
distance between any pair of nodes. However, the average
shortest path is 19,622. In terms of the the centrality param-
eters, the closeness and betweenness centrality of each node
forming the global network have been studied. The former
reaches a maximum value of 0.090, shown in nodes such as
Telegrafia (to Cadiz), Puerta del Mar (the stop of the hospital
to Cadiz) and El Puerto Station (to Cadiz). The latter, i.e. the
betweenness centrality, reaches a maximum value of 0.50 for
Jerez Station, followed by values of 0.28 approximately, as in
the nodes found in El Puerto Station. This makes the areas of
Cadiz, PSM and Jerez, the most relevant in terms of centrality
and, therefore, connectivity.
Regarding to the robustness parameters of the global net-
work, the average cluster coefficient of the network is 0.031,
a value similar to relevant networks such as the London
Metro Network (Gc = 0.0409) or Tokyo Metro Network
(Gc = 0.0285) [21] and, on Spanish territory, exceeding the
Barcelona Metro Network (Gc = 0.0044) [10].
B. Transport system relevance on the multimodal network
The statistical parameters of groups A, B and C presented
in Section III are summarised in Tables III, IV and V,
respectively. These tables show the values of the different
statistical and robustness parameters for each subgroup. These
parameters are: number of nodes, number of edges, diameter,
average degree (k), standard deviation of the nodes’ degree

In Table III, the statistical parameters of each of the
seven subgraphs of group A are compared against the global
network. This group considers maintaining the urban and
interurban buses in all subgroups, but not considering the
other means of transport in turns. As it is shown, there are
no remarkable variations in any of the parameters studied.
Indeed, the diameter, the normalised robustness indicator,
the clustering coefficient as well as the average efficiency
do not change in any of the studied subnetworks. In terms
of the number of nodes and edges, the maximum variation
is obviously found when not considering the combination of
the three means of transport (W/T+B+Tr). However, when
considering the deletion of a single mean of transport, the
one presenting a higher impact is the tram. This is mainly
because the stops and therefore, the links included in it, are
exclusively for this kind of transport.

The impact of the interurban bus network is analyzed in
Table IV, where the parameters of the two different subgraphs
that conform Group B are presented. It is observed that
removing the interurban, subgraph (W/I), means losing a total
of 135 nodes, a considerable loss, which highly affects all
the statistical parameters of the subgraph, as it it is shown in
Table IV. This means that some localities are disconnected
from the rest of the graph, such as Chipiona, Sanlucar de
Barrameda and Medina-Sidonia, and it makes more difficult
the access to the rest of the network. Indeed, the value of
the diameter has highly increased from 73 to 92. Thus, as
this network has a smaller number of nodes than the global
network, the standard deviation σ of the degree distribution
is remarkably lower, showing that the distribution is more
evenly distributed across the network nodes. In relation to the
robustness parameters, it is observed that both the average
efficiency E[ 1
H ] and the clustering coefficient are lower than
the global network. In contrast, it has a similar value for the
normalized robustness indicator rT , indicating that it has a
similar number of alternative routes as the global network.
Table IV also analyzes the interurban network by itself. It
has a total of 251 nodes, differing greatly from the global
network. On the one hand, its diameter is 40, so the distance
between any two nodes is shorter compared to the global
network. In terms of robustness parameters, the normalized
robustness indicator rT is close to the values of the other
subgraphs in the group, so it has a similar number of al-
ternative routes as the other graphs in this group. Regarding
both cluster coefficient parameter GC and average efficiency
E[ 1
H ] present a remarkable increase in their values, indicating
a higher robustness in this network.

Finally, the parameters of subgraphs included in group C
are shown in Table V. In this case the impact of the urban bus
network is studied. As can be seen, the values obtained by
removing a single urban network are similar to those of the
overall network, having similar characteristics of nodes and
edges, as well as in terms of robustness parameters. However,
in the case of Jerez de la Frontera it is different. In this case,
as it is the largest urban network of those studied, the effect of
eliminating it is more significant in comparison with the rest.

It is interesting to note the results obtained when all city buses
are eliminated. It can be seen that the impact on the number
of nodes and edges is high, as well as the diameter becomes
smaller and, therefore, there are smaller maximum distances
between nodes. Indeed, this behaviour is very similar to the
subgroup of group B where only interurban bus network is
considered. Both subgraphs present lower number of nodes,
edges and diameter than the global network, but higher average
degree and standard deviation, as well as similar values for the
robustness parameters, meaning that both the interurban and
urban networks are the most representative in the global graph.
This analysis shows that changes in the urban and in-
terurban networks will directly influence the global network
significantly, i.e. in terms of the robustness and connectivity.
However, the tram, train and boat have a low impact. More-
over, independently of the studied subgraph, the normalized
robustness indicator keeps a high value, highlighting the
resilience of the network (in terms of connectivity) to failures.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, a graphical analysis of graph theory has been
carried out on the public transport network of the Bay of
Cadiz, since it is a transport network that is in continuous
growth and can give rise to studies on its efficiency. In order
to achieve the objectives of this study, a statistical and graph
theory analysis of the network structure is carried out. The
global network has been partitioned in different graphs and
subgraphs in order to analyze the influence of the different
means of transport composing it.
The results of this work show the importance or influence
of the different types of transport in the Bay of Cadiz. In
this way, the networks that function as the core of the overall
network are both the urban and the interurban bus networks.
The interurban network presents the highest normalised ro-
bustness indicator as it is the one that connects the different
localities included in the Bay of Cadiz. Some of them become
isolated when this subnetwork is not considered. However, it
is worth noting that in any of the studied subnetworks, the
normalised robustness indicator presents a high value (always
over 0.87) even when not considering many of the transport
modes, meaning that the system is resilient and it maintains
connectivity in case of failure of any transport mode.
As future work, the travel time or fuel consumption will
be considered, including these features as weights in the
network. In addition, a multifractal study of the Bay of Cadiz
transport network based on the statistical study can provide
more information in this respect, as well as studying how
to adapt fractal algorithms to directed graphs of the different
types of transport.
