Abstract — The article analyses the research problem, what 
model for performance evaluation of virtual team could 
effectively serve a project leader by applying intelligent 
computational methods, which could reflect human cogitation. 
The hierarchical fuzzy comprehensive method of virtual team 
performance evaluation is suggested. The list of criteria of 
three groups (team, task and interaction) is elaborated for 
evaluation of project status and computed as the multi-level 
fuzzy vector. Expert evaluation, Shannon entropy and multi-
level 
matrix 
computational 
methods 
are 
applied 
for 
experimental research of the model. The experimental results 
of comprehensive task evaluation by combining expert 
judgments 
and 
quantitative 
values 
derived 
from 
communication data are highly compatible and can assist 
project leader by providing valuable insights of underlying 
reasons affecting project outcome.

 INTRODUCTION 
Globalization 
and 
penetration 
of 
information 
technologies are urging the need for new strategies of 
organizing projects in virtual mode and elaborating methods 
for their evaluation. Comparing to traditional attitudes the 
concept and principles of virtual work management are 
different not only due to the modes of communication in 
virtual and regular workspaces. Even experienced specialists 
and project leaders notify of numerous unexpected risks and 
difficulties, which undermine team efforts while working in 
virtual space. Recently, we can observe quite intensive 
informal discussions among project managers and leaders 
trying to reveal what brings the most significant influence in 
their efforts to streamline project progress, and what types of 
performance evaluation techniques could improve exposure 
of the real situation. This problem is important to project 
managers who apply both traditional and specific project 
methodologies. The group of team management problems in 
virtual environment is identified as e-leadership [1,2]. 
The traditional project management methodologies 
acknowledge administration and operational control. These 
techniques are characteristic for organizing work processes 
in the face-to-face environment, where prevailing methods of 
evaluation of progress status by the top-level organizational 
bodies are based on subjective insights. High level of 
subjective judgments and uncertainty makes project 
evaluation costly, time consuming and not all the time 
effective.  
The process-based method Project Management Body of 
Knowledge (PMBOK) [3] accentuates the interaction- 
oriented tools and techniques for project team management: 
Observation 
and 
Conversation, 
Project 
Performance 
Appraisals, Conflict Management, and Issue Log. 
Emerging project management approaches (such as Agile 
methodologies) emphasize importance of leadership in 
management process. Leader is assumed as the person who 
keeps the spotlight on the project vision, who inspires the 
team, who promotes teamwork and collaboration, who 
champions the project and removes obstacles hindering 
progress [4]. One of the most highly evaluated qualities of 
team leader is the ability to identify teamwork situation and 
project progress status. The effective tools and models for 
evaluation of the teamwork characteristics could enhance 
impact of personal qualities and to apply proper leadership 
techniques. 
Human interaction management theory (HIM) presents 
different perspective of human work modeling principles and 
suggests specific notation for revealing interaction processes 
and their content among team members [5].  
The interaction analysis oriented methods emphasize 
communication processes among team member, but do not 
provide 
evaluation tools, except plain statistics of 
communication intensity.  
The issues of performance evaluation of the virtual 
teamwork are summarized in [6], where the possibility to 
derive interaction statistics-based variables and to find their 
causal relationships for evaluating project performance is 
explored by applying balanced scorecard approach. The 
intelligent analysis of virtual communication variables by 
combining neural networks and sensitivity analysis in [7] 
reveals that the information captured in project environment 
cannot be directly applied for evaluation of project members, 
but the combined neural network-based analysis of the 
derived variables can predict project outcomes with 
sufficient precision, while the impact of various variables is 
different. The feasibility of introduction of interaction–based 
variables and fuzzy rules of their interrelationships for 
comprehensive evaluation of project team performance is 
researched in [8].

The article analyses the research problem, what model 
for analysis of virtual team could serve as effective 
evaluation tool for project leader, and to provide insights of 
performance by applying intelligent methods, which could 
reflect human cogitation.  
In Section 2, we present analysis of pilot survey, which 
explores attitudes of experienced project managers towards 
performance evaluation. The survey outcomes enabled to 
suggest new method of creating hierarchical structure of 
criteria for performance evaluation of virtual project. As the 
experts denoted it is crucial to evaluate virtual team 
performance based on members’ interaction analysis with the 
help of a system of interrelated criteria. In Section 3, we 
explain the structure and computational procedures of the 
model, 
designed 
by 
applying 
multi-level 
fuzzy 
comprehensive method, and aimed to identify and calibrate 
weights of task evaluation criteria. The conclusion and future 
works section summarizes the outcomes of the research and 
evaluation of adequateness of the model to the findings of 
pilot survey. 
II. 
IDENTIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
CRITERIA 
The research of criteria for evaluating performance of 
virtual team was made in two phases: the survey of project 
experts and computational analysis by applying method of 
multilevel fuzzy assessment.  
In order to find out different attitudes and reveal 
significant insights to project performance evaluation fifteen 
project managers from different information technologies-
related companies, participated in the interviewing process. 
The participants of the discussion were project managers of 
highest experience and technical consultants of JIRA Agile 
and JIRA Confluent solutions. They had experience of using 
ComindWork [9] and other applications of similar 
functionality for supervising virtual teams. The virtual 
collaboration environment ComindWork allows tracing 
various types of interactions among the members of project 
teams: messages, submitted files, timing settings and 
assignment of task status during project cycles [9]. 
The interviews consisted of two parts. The questions of 
the first part were formulated according to the main 
principles of Human Interaction management theory: Team 
building, Communication, Knowledge, Empowered time 
management, Collaborative, and Real time planning. 
The second part of survey aimed to collect detailed 
information that could indicate difficulties of virtual project 
management and lack of e-leadership efficiency related to 
performance evaluation and situation assessment. One of the 
goals of the discussion was to find out which of the criteria 
could be derived and measured by using logging records of 
virtual collaboration interactions, such as ComindWork and 
further processed by the computational model. 
After summarizing interviews the list of criteria for 
virtual team task performance evaluation based on human 
virtual interaction, was generated. After the reflective 
analytical discussion, the initial list of evaluation criteria was 
shortened. The refined version of the criteria list for human 
interaction evaluation is presented in Table 1. The criteria 
were grouped into three parts: Team evaluation criteria, Task 
evaluation criteria and Interaction evaluation criteria (Table 
1). The Team and Interaction evaluation criteria were 
designed to evaluate performance either of teams or of 
individuals. 
TABLE I.

Team and Individuals) 
Hierarchy - level of team hierarchy (the rate of high, middle, junior 
experience within a particular  role); (describes Team) 
Task evaluation criteria 
Phase - expert judgment /manager evaluation, parameter rate from a 
particular interval (beginning, middle or end of a particular project 
phase or iteration)

defining duration, number of topics, etc.) (describes Team) 
Questioning level - number of questions sent to team members and 
requests for information to team leader and senior members 
(describes Team and Individuals) 
Information sharing level - eagerness  of team and individual 
members to share information (describes Team and Individuals) 
Activity level - activeness level of the individual and team (describes 
Team and Individuals) 
Punctuality level - punctuality level of the individual and 
team(describes Team and Individuals) 
Maturity level - expert evaluation of the maturity level, which 
encompasses all characteristics (describes Team) 
 
The second part of the research was executed together 
with 
project 
managers, 
virtual 
project 
environment 
application specialists and associated statistics research 
professionals. The goal of the second part was to develop or 
to adapt classical methods for creating computational 
measurement system for human interaction criteria. 
Everybody agreed that the most suitable criteria for Team 
evaluation were traditional articles of project management 
evaluation that have been deeply investigated by researchers 
and successfully adopted in practice by project managers. 
For deriving these criteria the liner mathematical calculations 
were suggested and applied. 
The group of Task evaluation criteria was strongly based 
on expert knowledge and different task implementation 
circumstances that could not be accepted and analyzed as 
standard, as they were never known in advance. Therefore, 
all criteria in Task group were evaluated by expert judgment.

The measurement of third group Interaction evaluation 
criteria was based on application of computational methods 
for processing data acquired by event recording in 
collaboration system by Interaction observing agents. For 
example, 
analysis 
of 
the 
parameter 
Meeting 
level 
accumulated information about the number of meetings, 
which were held during implementation of particular task, 
the duration of meetings, their types according to goal, 
planning time, number of participants and results. Parameters 
Questioning level and Information sharing level depend on 
number of messages and chats distribution according to their 
purpose types, also meetings held on a particular question 
(problem) or learning issues. Activity level summarized total 
amount of actions done by individuals and teams during task 
implementation period. Punctuality level referred to fact if 
interim or final results, reviews of tasks were fulfilled in 
time, whether the response to question was done with 
acceptable time delay, if there were no late arrangement of 
meetings. The last parameter Maturity level served as 
compound parameter, which accumulated all values from 
Interaction evaluation criteria group and two criteria of Team 
evaluation group (Experience and Hierarchy). The whole 
parameter set is presented in Table 2.

The project management experts agreed that skillful 
observing team communication in virtual settings were no 
less significant and challenging as in the real environment.  
The main information used by project leader to derive 
insights were team behavior patterns, interpretation of 
situations and task implementation processes by reviewing 
and evaluating content and intensity of team interactions. For 
example, analysis of team members’ qualification and 
activities, questioning level, tendency to obey or to avoid 
obligations, punctuality in doing everything on time/not on 
time), keenness to share information and other characteristics 
could make it possible to identify the potential risk of task 
failure or possible delay. By employing insights from 
compound evaluation characteristics, the team leaders used 
to reduce risk of false judgment and make corrective actions 
of the situation concerning team behavior.  
The presented model was further investigated by 
applying experimental data in order to compare the 
evaluation of team performance by skillful experts and by 
computational intelligence methods for defining values of 
the selected criteria.  
Four 
possible 
situation 
outcomes 
of 
teamwork 
performance were chosen and experimentally tested by 
applying evaluation procedures of the suggested model:  
(1) If task implementation is proceeding well;  
(2) If the risk of task implementation delay can be 
identified;  
(3) If the problem of non-understanding and chaos is 
accruing;  
(4) If the project work is stagnated or omitted. 
The computational method based on multilevel fuzzy 
approach for criteria estimation, the experimental setting, 
procedures of application the suggested model and 
evaluation of its results are discussed in the Section 3. 
III. 
TASK PERFORMANCE EVALUATION MODEL BASED 
ON MULTI-LEVEL FUZZY METHOD 
The method presents the new conceptual model of ability 
to integrate numerous criteria of different hierarchical levels 
for deriving status of the highest-level criteria.  Multi-level 
Fuzzy Comprehensive method was chosen because of the 
variety of task evaluation criteria and their causal 
relationships. The quantitative evaluation by extracting 
information of virtual project environment is possible only 
22

for deriving part of the low-level criteria. The expert 
evaluation of the low-level criteria can be done with 
sufficient quality even by project leaders with lower 
experience, whereas expert judgment of high level criteria 
implies high risk and subjectivity. The method is based on 
Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process approach [10, 11], which 
allows formation of hierarchical criteria matrix, defining 
values of the low-level criteria and deriving values of the 
highest level criteria by calculating their weights and 
probabilities of status according to the defined status vector.  
The experimental results are based on analysis of the 
performance of software solution implementation project 
team, which consisted of seven members. The database of 
interactions among team members in the virtual environment 
ComindWork consisted of 937 records, which were analyzed 
for evaluation of team performance. 
The results of the expert evaluation for each level of 
criteria were benchmarked to the results obtained by 
applying the suggested model. 
Task Performance evaluation of the Multi-level Fuzzy 
Comprehensive methods were applied by these steps:  
(1) The determination of all level criteria sets;  
(2) The identification of each criteria evaluation;  
(3) The indication of weight for each criterion;  
(4) The construction of single criteria evaluation matrix;  
(5) The construction of comprehensive evaluation model. 
A. The determination of all level criteria sets 
Virtual team evaluation criteria are shown in Table 2. 
Variables differ by the following characteristics: category 
(applied for team, task or interaction), application type 
(applied for team or individual), measurement principles 
(qualitative, quantitative or compound) and measurement 
methods (Table 2). The set of criteria is arranged as the 
matrix C=(Cij), (i=1,2, … m), (j=1,2,…n), where (i) 
indicates higher level category and (j) category of lower 
hierarchical level. 
B. The identification of each criteria evaluation 
Evaluation of each criteria group is done according to the 
expert recommendations and specific results. The criteria 
evaluation set is constructed by applying status rating vector 
V = (V1, V2, V3, V4) = {Omit; Chaos; Delay; Well}. 
C. Weight indication for the criteria 
The weight values for each criterion were determined by 
two methods: they were defined by experts and by applying 
Shannon entropy measure [9].  
The weight indicator corresponds to each criteria level 
W=(Wij), (i=1,2,..m), and (j=1,2,..n). The list of criteria and 
their weights are shown in Table 3, where (i) indicates first 
level criteria and (j) – the second level criteria. Weight 
parameters should meet several conditions: Wi, Wij >0, Wij 
< 1, and formula (1):

In order to research if the quantitative measures of 
interaction can be computed and used to assist the project 
leader (and at least partially replace expert judgment), the 
Shannon entropy measure was applied [12]. Shannon 
entropy takes into account the information effectiveness of 
the analyzed data series and can be applied for defining 
weights of the criteria. We applied standard algorithm for 
calculating weights of interrelated criteria [10]. Our 
suggested list of criteria (Table 2) consisted both of expert 
judgment-based values and of quantitative measures, defined 
from human interaction statistics in virtual collaborative 
space.

We applied Shannon entropy for computing weights for 
the interaction-statistics-based criteria for the individual 
members and the project team (C13, C14, C32, C33, C34, 
and C35 from Table 3). We implied that the interaction data 
provided by the virtual collaborative space of the team can 
be applied for calculating part of the evaluation criteria set 
and provide insights for the project leader for further 
evaluation of the whole criteria set. 
The results of weight assignment according to Shannon 
entropy measure, as presented in Table 4, are highly 
compatible to the weights set by experts (Table 3).

experience, and the Shannon’s entropy method was applied 
to process the interaction data of a single project. The results 
encourage for further investigations aimed achieving validity 
of the experimental research. 
Application of Multi-level Fuzzy Comprehensive method 
was intended to analyze experimental data in order to exploit 
hierarchical interrelationships of the criteria set and expert 
evaluations of the particular criteria in order to compute 
cumulative evaluation the team performance.

E. The construction of Comprehensive evaluation 
Comprehensive evaluation is multi-level process. The 
computation is performed starting with the lowest level 
criteria of the initial criteria set Ci = (Ci1, Ci2 … Cij), then 
processing to the highest level criteria C = (C1, C2,   Cm). 
The comprehensive evaluation matrix for Ci is Bi, for C is B,

The value vector V was applied for expert judgments. 
The computation results of the three criteria groups C1, C2 
and C3 are evaluated according to values of vector V: (Omit; 
Chaos; Delay; Well) = {V1, V2, V3, V4}. The biggest 
element of the computed array means that the value of the 
computed criterion is equal to the corresponding element of 
the vector V with the highest probability.  After applying the 
above-discussed computation procedures, the evaluation 
parameters 
for 
Team, 
Task 
and 
Interaction 
level 
characteristics (C1, C2, and C3) were computed and the 
project status evaluation was derived.

The results lead to further interpretations and insights. 
The 
Team 
characteristic 
of 
the 
second 
level 
of 
Comprehensive evaluation was assigned value “Chaos” with 
the highest possibility (0,3). The Task characteristic was 
evaluated as “Omit” with the highest possibility (0,3). 
Analysis of Interaction denotes the situation of “Delay” 
(0,34). By accumulating all parameters according to multi-
level 
fuzzy 
comprehensive 
evaluation 
method 
and 
calculating the compound situation, measure B the situation 
“Delay” could be identified with the highest probability 
(0,28). 
Slightly different situation is identified in the case of 
applying calculation of criteria weights by Shannon entropy 
method, where the values of criteria subset are derived from 
interaction statistics information captured in the virtual 
project environment (Table 4). In this case the compound 
situation measure “Delay” has higher possibility equal to 
0,29, as the B {Omit; Chaos; Delay; Well} = (0,24; 0,27; 
0,29; 0,20).  
The research results revealed that the suggested multi-
level interaction system and expert judgment lead to similar 
results and can be applied to assist project leaders working in 
virtual environment. The human interaction instances 
registered during virtual teamwork can be used for deriving 
evaluation criteria and provide reliable insights for 
evaluating team performance and its outcomes. The initial 
results encourage that further research should be executed. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The main drawback of applying existing methods (Agile, 
PMBOK, HIM) for project management in virtual 
environment is lack of measures for performance evaluation. 
The analysis of virtual communication among project 
team 
members 
is 
mainly 
based 
on 
statistics 
of 
communication intensity, captured in the virtual project 
environment. The information of number of messages, 
submitted files and responses is not sufficient for providing 
in-depth insights for the project leader for comprehensive

evaluation of task quality, individual input or risk of project 
outcomes.  
The article presents solution for the research problem as 
the multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model for 
performance evaluation of virtual team. The variables and 
their multi-level structure were elaborated by applying 
method of expert survey. The performance of the model is 
based on measurement of the variables and assigning their 
weights indicating their impact for the project outcome. 
Sixteen criteria of three groups (team, task and interaction) 
were included to the model for evaluation of project status, 
computed as the multi-level fuzzy vector. The measurement 
of criteria is combined not only of expert evaluation but of 
quantitative values related to communication of project team 
members as well. Shannon entropy method is applied for 
processing communication-related information captured in 
virtual environment of project team. 
The experimental research of consisting of pilot expert 
survey and analysis of project teamwork performance in 
virtual environment ComindWork allowed to positively 
evaluated the suggested model. The values of interaction 
statistics-based criteria processed by applying Shannon 
entropy were highly compatible to the values assigned by 
experts.  
It allows concluding that at least part of criteria for 
project performance evaluation can be computed by 
processing 
information 
of 
virtual 
communication 
environment used by the project team. Project leaders can 
evaluate the other part of low-level qualitative criteria 
included to the hierarchical model. The highest level-criteria 
for evaluating situation and forecasting the project outcome 
involve the biggest risk and require mature experience of 
project leader.  
The suggested method of multi-level fuzzy assessment 
allows applying computational model, to calculate the 
highest level-criteria and assist project leader by providing 
valuable insights of underlying reasons affecting these 
criteria.  
The proposed multi-level fuzzy method is an innovative 
approach for project performance evaluation by creating 
hierarchical interrelationship structure of criteria and their 
measurement by combining expert evaluation and Shannon 
entropy. The suggested method based on fuzzy logic can 
provide better understanding to project outcomes considering 
ambiguous and imprecise data in a manner similar to the 
human thinking and the human judgment.  
The validity of the model will be tested by future 
experimental research.
