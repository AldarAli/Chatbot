Patent data of GaN industry were preprocessed by filter model
based on NLTK Toolkit to identify the tech terms and then
clustered them based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to
find the latent topics which were visualized. Based on group
operation, new emerging terms ranked by TFIDF through

focused evolution. This research offers a demonstration of the
proposed method based on 26,854 GaN patents. The results
show 20 Research and Development topics with tech terms in

evolution based on new emerging terms every year, which
provides a clue for more detaied analyses later. Our results
show an efficent way to find technology focused evolution from
a large scale text data.

INTRODUCTION
As an unsupervised learning method, the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) is widely used for topics finding in large
text analysis. Topic model is a generative model for
documents which are mixtures of topics comprising words
over probability distribution. Traditionally, words were used
to construct an LDA model, which resulted in quite a lot of
general words on top of each topic. Herein, the noun terms
are utilized instead of words to discover patterns of term-use
and the documents relationship.
In the Derwent Innovation Index (DII) database, original
patent titles and abstracts are rewritten in English and the
technology details including patent novelty, use, advantage
and so on from patent full text are extracted. In this paper,
based on preprocessed text dataset of 26,854 patent titles and
abstracts about GaN technology field from DII, the research
topics were discovered, and R&D focus changes were
detected and visualized.
Researches about R&D changes or evolution based on
LDA have focuses at topic level. T. L.Griffiths et al. write
about a method identifying ‘hot topics’ or ‘cold topics’ [1].
D. Choi et al. explore technological trends based on patent
share and their change at the topic level [2]. X. C. Gong et al.
detect topic splitting and merging based on the LDA Model
[3]. J. B. Qu et al. analyze topic evolution with topic
relevance from adjacent time intervals [4]. Many researches
have improved and practiced methods detecting R&D
changes or evolution at topic level, while few have discussed
finer granularity analyzing at term level.
II.
TEXT PREPROCESSING
Since most terms have the syntactic form of a noun
phrase [5], identifying the noun phrases in the text was
executed during text preprocessing. Part-Of-Speech Tagging
in Python NLTK was used to construct language filter and
identify noun phrases as following:
1. The sequence consists of nouns, v-ing form and
adjectives, such as the phrase ‘device comprising virtual
display system’.
2. The sequence ends with a noun or a v-ing form, such
as
the
phrase
’distributing
workflow’
or
‘business
computing.
Additionally, stop contents were manipulated in the
Python script from three different levels: sentence, phrase
and word. For example, the publisher information sentence
such as '(C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved' and the
patent text description phrases such as 'independent claim'
were stopped. Basically, uppercase and lowercase, singular
and plural nouns and so on are preprocessed on word level.
After text preprocessing, the terms were prepared for
LDA model.
III.
RESEARCH TOPICS FINDING AND VISUALIZING
A. Research Topics Finding
The Gibbs sampling algorithm was used, with β=0.1, α
=50/T, (T is the number of topics) [6]. In practical
application,βis relatively small and words can be expected
into a specific research topic [1]. Since GaN field is already a
specific area, fewer topics are involved in this case. Because
the value of T in is very small, less than 30, topics for
different T were discriminated manually to avoid overlap

between topics in macro level. Finally, 20 topics were
suitable for GaN patent data, as shown in Table 1.

B. Research Topics Visualization
Based on LDA model, the metric for terms and topics
was measured and used to calculate the similarities between
terms. A visualization map was constructed by applying
Multidimensional Scaling to the similarities [6]. 20 topics in
the GaN field were visualized, as shown in Figure 1. The
threshold value for terms showed in the map was 0.001 in
this case.

The metric  of topics and documents was used to find
the topic contributing the most to every document.ߠ݅,݆can
reveal the degree to which topic i is referred to in the

The evolution of R&D

through
new terms
emerging in every year was observed. All documents were
grouped by year, and terms in a year’s documents were
counted. ܶerms௬ means terms in year. Then, (2) was used to
extract new emerging terms in year y,ܧݕ, ranked by sum of
TF-IDF scores.

In practice, the top technical terms are ranked and
identified by term frequency and TF-IDF value. But there are
a large number of high frequency general terms by term
frequency rank while the technical terms obtained by TF-
IDF are more meaningful. Based on (2), new emerging terms
were counted from 2011 to 2017 every year in GaN field, as
shown in Figure 2.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The analysis model proposed in this paper gives an
efficient way to find technology focus evolution from a large
scale text data, such as patent information in this case.
Compared with topic level analysis, the tech evolution
provides a breakthrough point for finer granularity analyzing
to discover hot tech researches on a timescale which could be
a clue for finding more information about these tech focuses.
In the future, we will continue to optimize the analysis model
in practice, especially the processing of synonyms.
