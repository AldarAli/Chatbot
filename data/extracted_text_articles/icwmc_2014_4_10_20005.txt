Abstract — This work presents a design example of a wideband 
envelope modulator (EM) that can effectively modulate the 
instantaneous supply voltage for a monolithic SiGe power 
amplifier to form a highly efficient envelope-tracking power 
amplifier (ET-PA) system for potential broadband wireless 
applications. Trade-offs between linearity, switching noise, 
efficiency and bandwidth have been examined carefully with 
both experimental data and RF/analog/digital co-simulations. 
The SiGe ET-PA using our wideband EM was characterized 
by the WiMAX 64QAM 8.75 MHz signal, showing an overall 
PAE of 30.5% at output power of 17 dBm with an error vector 
magnitude (EVM) of 4.4%, while successfully passing the 
stringent WiMAX spectral mask.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recently, envelope-tracking (ET) has become a very 
popular efficiency enhancement technique for RF power 
amplifiers (PAs) design [1]-[5]. Split-band design concept 
has been applied to the envelope modulator (EM) for 
wideband applications [1] [4] [5]. However, compared with 
narrowband cellular applications (e.g., EDGE), the high 
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR or PAR) of the 
broadband signals (e.g., LTE/WiMAX) require the EM to 
have wider bandwidth and lower distortion, while still 
maintaining 
excellent 
efficiency. 
Therefore, 
careful 
investigations of the design trade-offs for the wideband EM 
are still required. In this paper, we will report a design 
example for a wideband EM paired with a SiGe monolithic 
PA to form an effective ET-PA system for potential 
broadband wireless applications. A discrete linear-assisted 
switching EM is designed to investigate the overall ET-PA 
system 
performances 
by 
experimental 
data 
and 
RF/analog/digital co-simulation. The effects of bandwidth 
and switching frequency as two major factors on linearity 
and efficiency will be studied carefully to make this EM 
applicable for high PAR wideband applications.  
This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents 
the designs of the common-emitter SiGe PA and linear-
assisted switching EM. In Section III, we demonstrate the 
effective of our designed EM by applying it to the SiGe PA 
to form an ET-PA system. A WiMAX 64QAM 8.75 MHz 
signal (PAR of 10.5 dB) will be applied to the ET-PA to 
showcase the efficiency and linearity enhancements of the 
ET technique over traditional fixed-supply PAs.

CIRCUITS DESIGN 
A. Design of Common-Emitter SiGe Power Amplifier  
A monolithic 1-stage common-emitter SiGe PA is used 
here as an example to form an ET-PA system to study the 
trade-offs for wideband EM design. This PA was designed 
and fabricated in IBM 7HP 0.18μm SiGe BiCMOS 
technology [1]-[3]. The simplified schematic and die picture 
of the PA are shown in Fig. 1. The high-breakdown 
heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) option is used for 
the PA design with a total emitter-area of 220 μm2 (typical 
BVCEO=4.2 V; BVCBO=12.5 V). This monolithic SiGe PA 
was tested on a FR4 PCB. The RF Choke (RFC) inductor 
was left off-chip to achieve high Q at 2.4 GHz for better 
power-added-efficiency (PAE). A high-Q bondwire is used 
as the output tank inductor design, together with more than 
4 downbonds (i.e., bondwires at the emitter node) to reduce 
the ground parasitic inductance for high PAE [3]. No other 
off-chip elements are needed nor used for the PA input and 
output matching. 
It is important to characterize the PA thoroughly before 
designing the EM for optimal ET-PA performances, as the 
collector impedance presented by the PA (Rload) will affect 
the efficiency and linearity performance of the EM. Fig. 2 
shows the measured PAE vs. output power (Pout) at different 
supply voltage VCC in the continuous wave (CW) mode. For 
the fixed-supply PA, its PAE reduces rapidly when Pout 
drops, but the PAE at low Pout can be greatly enhanced by 
varying VCC as shown by the dash curve, which shows the 
idea for an ET-PA operation. The dash curve is obtained at 
each peak PAE point of different VCC levels. This 
characteristic of PAE enhancement indicates that the ET 
technique can improve the average efficiency of the PA 
compared with the case of a fixed-supply PA. Fig. 2 also 
plots the collector impedance presented by the PA to the 
EM (i.e., Rload), which is calculated from the DC supply 
voltage and the measured DC supply current of the PA at 
each peak PAE point (please refer to Fig. 4 for the definition 
of Rload [4]). The Rload presented by the PA varies, dependent 
on the operating regions of the PA [1]. According to the 
measurement data shown in Fig. 2, Rload can change roughly 
from 70 Ω to 10 Ω when Pout increases from 8 dBm to 20 
dBm.

B. Linear-Assisted Switching Envelope Modulator 
A proper EM design is critical to achieve the best overall 
efficiency and linearity performances for an ET-PA. As 
reported in [1]-[4], the finite bandwidth and the associated 
group delay of the EM are large contributors of nonlinearity 
in an ET-PA. In addition, to take advantage of the efficiency 
enhancement provided by the ET technique, the EM needs 
to maintain high efficiency throughout the ET-PA operation. 
The overall power efficiency of an ET-PA system is the 
product of the EM efficiency and the PA collector efficiency 
(CE), which is expressed as:

Therefore, the EM design targets are high efficiency and 
wide bandwidth to track the instantaneous input envelope. 
1) Split-Band Design of the Envelope Modulator 
The envelope signal is extracted from the modulated I/Q 
(i.e., in-phase/quad-phase) signals from the LTE/WiMAX 
baseband and then feed into the EM. Such nonlinear 
transformation will expand the bandwidth of the envelope 
by a factor of 5-10 compared with the original signal 
bandwidth [4] [5]. Conventionally, the EM can be 
implemented in the form of a linear regulator (e.g., a low 
dropout regulator (LDO) as in [6]), as the linear topology 
offers wide bandwidth and can be with almost no output 
ripple. Nonetheless, the power efficiency of linear regulator 
is very poor when the output voltage level is low [6], 
making it unsuitable for high PAR signals for 3G/4G 
applications. On the other hand, a switching regulator has 
high power efficiency across a broad range of output 
voltage, but it produces significant output ripples and its 
bandwidth is constrained to be a fraction of the switching 
frequency [7], making it suitable only for narrowband 
applications such as the North American Digital Cellular 
(NADC) in [7]. Switching regulators can also be applied to 
high data-rate systems when a rather high switching 
frequency is employed [8], but the high switching frequency 
inevitably causes high switching loss that limits the power 
efficiency (e.g., ~76% maximum for WCDMA in [8]) and 
also can degrade ET-PA linearity considerably, which can 
often defeat the purpose of using switching regulators.

Fig. 3 Simulated envelope spectra of WiMAX 8.75/20 MHz signals. 
Many recent reports on the wideband EM design for ET-
PA have combined the advantages of a wideband linear 
regulator and a high efficiency switching regulator in 
various ways [9]-[11]. Fig. 3 shows the simulated envelope 
spectra of WiMAX 8.75 MHz and 20 MHz signals (PAR of 
~10.2 dB). An important characteristic of the envelope 
spectrum is that ~80% of envelope power resides from DC 
to several kHz, while over 99% of the envelope power 
resides within DC to 8MHz for the 8.75 MHz signal, and 
within DC to 20 MHz for the 20 MHz signal, respectively. 
Such a characteristic of the envelope spectrum implies that a 
“split-band” EM design (or often called “linear-assisted 
switching” structure) can achieve a high efficiency over a 
wide bandwidth [4]. The split-band EM consists of a 
wideband linear stage (therefore of low efficiency) and a 
high efficiency narrowband switching stage. This split-band 
design lessens the requirements of the switching stage, since 
the fast transients of the envelope signal will be taken care 
of by the wideband linear stage, while the switching stage 
will handle DC and the slow moving signals with high 
efficiency. The efficiency of the entire EM (ηenv.-mod.) is a 
combination of the switching stage efficiency (ηSW) and the 
linear stage efficiency (ηlin), as expressed by: 
env-mod.

2) Discrete Envelope Modulator Design 
The linear-assisted switching EM is designed by using 
commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) components to investigate 
the overall efficiency and linearity trade-off in an ET-PA 
system. Fig. 4 shows the circuit implementation of the 
discrete EM using an operational amplifier (Op-Amp) as the 
linear stage and a buck converter as the switching stage. The 
buck converter supplies the slow slew-rate load current (ISW) 
that contributes to the majority of the load current (Iload) to 
ensure high efficiency, while the wideband linear Op-Amp 
stage operates in a feedback mode to track the high slew-
rate current (Ilin). Additionally, the ripples caused by the 
buck converter will be attenuated and/or filtered by the 
linear Op-Amp. The smooth transition between the 
switching stage and the linear stage is realized by a 
hysteretic current feedback control. The hysteretic current 
feedback control consists of a current sensing resistor Rsense 
that senses the output current of the linear stage and a 
hysteresis comparator to control the buck converter. The 
value of the sensing resistor Rsense is chosen to be 1 Ω in this 
case, as it needs to be much smaller than Rload (i.e., the load 
impedance presented by the PA) to achieve high efficiency.

C. Efficiency and Nonlinearities of Envelope Modulator 
Although many reported on the efficiency of the EM 
design in the literature [1] [2] [4] [13], its linearity and 
switching noise trade-offs vs. efficiency have not been 
studied as rigorously, which are especially critical for 
wideband signals. In this section, the nonlinearities of the 
discrete linear-assisted switching EM will be characterized. 
The switching noise and the bandwidth of the EM are two 
major factors that cause distortions to the output envelope 
signal. Understanding the effects of the switching frequency 
and bandwidth limitation of the EM helps to optimize both 
efficiency and linearity of the overall ET-PA.  
1) Bandwidth of the Envelope Modulator 
Previous works suggest that for a good linearity 
performance, the linear stage (i.e., the Op-Amp) should 
have sufficient bandwidth to track the high frequency 
contents of the envelope signal with high fidelity [1] [4] [5]. 
In addition, once the linear Op-Amp stage is used to assist 
the switching buck converter, it should have sufficient 
bandwidth to suppress the switching ripples/noise. The 
switching ripples beyond the bandwidth of the linear stage 
can distort the envelope signal, and be mixed with the 
modulated carrier in the PA to cause large spurious noise at 
the PA output, potentially degrading the system linearity.

Fig. 5 Simulated (A, C, E) current and (B, D, F) voltage waveforms of the 
EM; the behavior model is used for the Op-Amp with different 1-dB 
bandwidths, while realistic SPICE models are used for other blocks of the 
EM. Input voltage = 1.25+sin(2π·200kHz·t) V, L = 4.7 µH, Rload = 20 Ω. 
To investigate the effect of the EM bandwidth, the 
commercial available Op-Amp (i.e., LMH6639 in Fig 4) is 
replaced with an Op-Amp behavior model provided by 
Agilent’s ADS, such that the bandwidth of the Op-Amp can 
be changed manually in the SPICE simulations. The 
realistic SPICE models are still used for other blocks of the 
EM. Fig. 5 shows the simulated current and voltage 
waveforms of the EM using different 1-dB bandwidths of 
the Op-Amp at an input wave of 1.25+sin(2π·200kHz·t) V. 
Here, the 1-dB bandwidth is defined as the frequency where 
the gain response decreases by 1 dB. As shown in Fig. 5(A), 
(C) and (E), the output current of the switching stage (ISW) 
has large ripples on the waveforms, which need to be 
suppressed or cancelled by the output current of the linear 
stage (Ilin) to reproduce an accurate load current waveform 
(Iload). When the 1-dB bandwidth of the Op-Amp is set as 
0.2 MHz, the output voltage (Vout) of the EM exhibits not 
only the switching ripples but also with some attenuation 
(Fig. 5(B)). When the 1-dB bandwidth of the Op-Amp is set 
as 2 MHz, the output voltage waveform Vout can follow the 
input voltage without attenuation, but the switching ripples 
still cannot be suppressed (Fig. 5(D)). When the 1-dB 
bandwidth of the Op-Amp is set as 8 MHz, Vout can now 
follow the input voltage with high fidelity and at a low noise 
level (Fig. 5(F)).  
To further demonstrate the importance of having a 
wideband linear stage in the EM to meet the stringent

linearity specs, the entire ET-PA using the monolithic SiGe 
PA is simulated with the RF/analog/digital co-simulation 
bench. The behavior model is used for the Op-Amp, while 
the realistic SPICE models are used for the PA and the other 
blocks of the EM. The inductor (L) of the buck converter is 
first chosen around 40 µH. The effect of the value of L on 
the EM design will be discussed in the next section. The 
simulated output error-vector-magnitude (EVM) values of 
the ET-PA against different 1-dB bandwidths of the Op-
Amp stage are plotted in Fig. 6 for the WiMAX 64QAM 
8.75 MHz signal. As shown in Fig. 6, the EVM values of 
the ET-PA decrease as the 1-dB bandwidth of the Op-Amp 
increases, and become saturated to ~1.8% after the 1-dB 
bandwidth of the Op-Amp becomes larger than 18 MHz. 
Fig. 7 shows the simulated transmission output spectra of 
the ET-PA with different bandwidths of the Op-Amp. There 
is a large improvement on the Adjacent Channel Power 
Ratio (ACPR) when the 1-dB bandwidth of the Op-Amp 
increases from 8 MHz to 18 MHz, enabling the output 
spectrum passing the stringent WiMAX spectral mask specs 
for the case of 18 MHz. As indicated by Figs. 6-7, the 
required bandwidth of the EM for the ET-PA needs to be 
able to respond to the envelope frequency contents to at 
least 2x of the original instantaneous signal bandwidth.

, where Vdc and Vrms are the average and root-mean-square 
voltages of the output envelope signal, respectively; h is the 
hysteresis voltage of the comparator, and D is the duty ratio 
that can be calculated from Vdc/VDD. In this design, the 
comparator LMV7219 has a predetermined internal 
hysteresis h of 7-10 mV according to the data sheet and the 
SPICE simulations. Therefore, from (3) the average 
switching frequency can now be mainly controlled by the 
value of L. The drawback of using a small L is that it usually 
generates more switching ripples at high frequencies, 
making the design of the linear stage more challenging [11].  
Fig. 8 shows the SPICE simulated waveforms and 
spectra of the EM designed using two different values of L 
with an input waveform of 1.25+ sin(2π·500kHz·t) V. This 
time, the realistic SPICE models are used for all blocks of 
the EM simulations. The switching current Isw supplies both 
DC and AC components of the load current (Iload) by using 
an L of 4.7 µH; a higher switching frequency and large 
switching ripples on the waveform of Isw can be observed 
from Fig. 8(A). Such large switching ripples need to be 
suppressed or cancelled by the output current of the linear 
Op-Amp (Ilin), which can be clearly shown by the spectra of 
Isw and Iload in Figs. 8(E) and (G). On the other hand, for the 
case of L= 68 µH, Isw supplies only the DC component of 
Iload, while the AC component is taken care of by the linear 
Op-Amp, as shown in Fig. 8(B). Also, the spectra of Isw and 
Iload for the case of L= 68 µH have smaller harmonics than 
those using L= 4.7 µH. These SPICE simulations indicate 
that the optimal value of L should be selected according to 
the best trade-off of maximum efficiency and linearity.  
Fig. 9 shows the SPICE simulated efficiency of the EM 
and the EVM of the ET-PA using the monolithic SiGe PA 
presented in Fig. 1. The realistic SPICE models are used for 
the SiGe PA and all blocks of the EM. From the pure view 
point of efficiency, the optimal value of L for the best 
efficiency is 8.2 μH. Smaller L results in higher switching 
frequency that can cause significant switching loss and 
ripples. On the other hand, too large of the L makes the 
buck-converter only able to supply the DC component of the 
load current, and in that case the lower efficiency Op-Amp 
has to deliver the remaining AC contents (as illustrated in 
Fig. 8 (B)), leading to lower efficiency for the EM and thus 
the overall ET-PA system. Rather large L can also cause 
high parasitic resistance to decrease its efficiency. In 
addition, as shown in Fig. 9, the output EVM of the ET-PA 
is increased (i.e., linearity degraded) as L decreases. For 
example, the efficiency of the EM is increased by 4% by 
reducing L from 100 µH to 8.2 µH, but at the slight cost of 
worse EVM from 2.45% to 2.8%. 
Fig. 10 shows the SPICE simulated output spectra of the 
ET-PA using L of 8.2 µH and L of 27 µH, respectively. 
When the larger L (27 µH) is chosen, the ACPR is 4-6 dB 
better at the offset of 5-8 MHz from the center frequency. 
Please note the output spectrum for the case of L=8.2 µH 
slightly violates the WiMAX spectral mask.

Fig. 9 SPICE simulated efficiency of the EM and output EVM of the ET-PA 
using different values of L for WiMAX 64QAM 8.75MHz signal. Realistic 
SPICE models were used for the PA and EM. VDD= 4.2 V, Pout = 17 dBm. 
Figs. 9-10 indicate that a small efficiency improvement 
may not be worthwhile if one has to sacrifice the linearity of 
overall ET-PA. Therefore, the L of 27 μH is chosen in the 
design for our EM to achieve best trade-off of efficiency vs. 
linearity, which is of course dependent on the best high-Q 
inductor available with the given budget. Fig. 11 shows the 
measured efficiency of the EM with different bandwidths of 
the WiMAX 64QAM signals. Note the efficiency of the EM 
shown here is only reduced by 2.5% when the signal 
bandwidth increased from 1.5 MHz to 20 MHz.

When the output current is low, the inductor may be 
completely discharged at the “OFF” state of the buck 
converter before the switcher is turned on again, which is 
often called as the “discontinuous mode” for DC-DC 
converter design [22]. Therefore, another concern in the 
selection of the inductor value is to ensure the buck 
converter does not go into the discontinuous mode operation 
[22]. The boundary of the discontinuous mode occurs at 
where the output DC current (Io) equals to one half of the 
peak-to-peak inductor ramp current ΔI (i.e., 0.5ΔI = Io). For 
the 
stand-alone 
buck 
converter 
controlled 
by 
the 
conventional pulse-width modulation (PWM) scheme, the 
minimal L should be determined to avoid the discontinuous 
mode at the minimum DC output current (Io,min) as [22]

, where Vout,DC is the output DC voltage, D is the duty cycle, 
and fSW is the switching frequency determined by the PWM 
control scheme. For example, if the EM were to be 
implemented using the conventional PWM control scheme 
for this ET-PA, one could obtain the Vout,DC = 2.3 V, Io,min = 
33 mA (i.e., at Rload = 70 Ω presented by the SiGe PA as 
shown in Fig. 2). Therefore, the minimal inductor value 
calculated based on (4) would be ~16 µH for a PWM-
controlled buck-converter, assuming fSW =1 MHz.

However, for the linear-assisted switching EM design 
presented here, the peak-to-peak inductor ramp current ΔI is 
limited under 2h/Rsense, which is not related with the 
inductor value [4]. This is because once the switching 
current ISW is h/Rsense lower than the load current Iload, the 
hysteresis comparator will immediately sense the current 
difference and turn on the switcher again, assuming the 
switcher can response fast enough [4]. In the practical 
design, however, the switcher is not ideal due to its intrinsic 
gate capacitance and resistance, therefore it may not respond 
fast enough with a high switching frequency, and this 
frequency is directly determined by the inductor value. 
Also, the hysteresis window h increases with higher input 
slew rate [23]. The SPICE simulations show that h is ~7 mV 
with the input voltage ramp below 0.2 V/µs, but increases to 
~43 mV with the input voltage ramp of 4 V/µs. According 
to the simulation, the minimal L is 1.2 µH to avoid the 
discontinuous mode operation for this EM design. Fig. 12 
shows the SPICE simulated current waveforms of the linear-
assisted EM at the boundary of the discontinuous mode. 
Depending on the accuracy of the device modeling and the 
packaging parasitic, the inductance in the practical 
implementation may be lower than the simulated value.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OF THE SIGE ET-PA 
A. Efficiency and Linearity of the Stand-Alone PA 
First, the stand-alone PA with fixed-supply voltage is 
tested to serve as a reference for the comparison with the 
ET-PA. Fig. 13 shows the measured gain, PAE and EVM 
vs. Pout for the WiMAX 64QAM 8.75 MHz signal (PAR = 
10.5 dB) at 2.3 GHz. Without using any off-chip matching 
elements, the PAE of the SiGe PA reached 39% at the Pout 
of 17.8 dBm, but with a rather high output EVM of 11.7% 
(the EVM spec of WiMAX 64QAM is 5.0% or -26 dB). At 
Pout of 16 dBm, the stand-alone PA already violates the 
lenient EVM spec. Increasing VCC could reduce the EVM as 
shown in Fig. 14, but at the cost of lower efficiency.  
B. Efficiency and Linearity of the ET-PA 
The discrete EM discussed earlier is used to modulate 
the supply voltage VCC of the PA to form an ET-PA system. 
Please note that no predistortion is used in this work. The 
entire ET-PA operates at VDD of 4.2 V. Fig. 15 shows the 
measured EVM, gain and overall PAE vs. Pout of the ET-PA. 
Note the overall PAE (or the ET-PA composite PAE) 
includes the power consumption of the EM. The overall 
PAE is 30.5% at Pout of 17 dBm with an EVM of 4.4%. 
Judging from the PAE of ~50% for the SiGe PA at Pout of 17 
dBm (Fig. 2) and the efficiency of the EM of ~68% (Fig. 
11), the expected overall efficiency of the ET-PA would be 
34%, which is close to the measured data observed from Fig. 
15. 
Fig. 16 shows the output spectra of the ET-PA and the 
stand-alone PA with fixed supply. At the same Pout of 17 
dBm, the ET-PA successfully passes the stringent WiMAX 
64QAM mask defined by European Telecommunications 
Standards Institute (ETSI), while the stand-alone PA fails 
the spectral mask badly. The ET-PA operates at its P2dB 
point for Pout of 17 dBm, but still impressively passes the 
WiMAX emission mask. The better linearity of the ET-PA 
is probably due to the same envelope shaping function 
applied in the system as [24], which linearizes the AM-AM 
of the ET-PA across the instantaneous Pout range. Fig. 17 
further shows that the maximum linear Pout of the fixed-
supply PA is only ~13.5 dBm in order to pass the WiMAX 
spectral mask, leading to a PAE of only ~26%. Therefore, 
the ET-PA outperforms the fixed-supply PA by 3.5 dB on 
maximum linear Pout and 4.5% on PAE. Table I summarizes 
the performances of our ET-PA and its comparison with 
other state-of-the-art polar/ET-PAs.

IV. 
CONCLUSTION 
The circuits and system design insights of a high 
efficiency and linear ET-PA system have been discussed 
using a SiGe PA and a discrete linear-assisted switching EM. 
The switching frequency of the switching stage and the 
bandwidth of the linear stage have been studied carefully to 
make the EM suitable for high PAR wideband applications. 
The WiMAX 64QAM 8.75 MHz signal was used to 
characterize the linearity and efficiency performances of the 
ET-PA system. Without needing any predistortion, the 
entire ET-PA system achieved an overall PAE of 30.5% at 
Pout of 17 dBm with an EVM of 4.4%, while successfully 
passing the stringent WiMAX spectral mask.
