Abstract—Researchers are encouraged to describe and publish
research datasets so that others can ﬁnd and reuse it. Following a
semantic approach, well-known concept identiﬁers are necessary
that can be used as values for meta-data properties to describe
relevant characteristics of such a research artifact. Multiple re-
search disciplines, communities or initiatives have already created
and published standardized terms as taxonomies or ontologies for
that. However, these developments are distributed on the Web. As
a consequence, it can be difﬁcult for researchers to become aware
of already recommended structured terminologies. Thus, they will
further rely on ambiguous, literal annotations. In this paper, we
investigate existing data sources in the Semantic Web that contain
relevant terms to describe a research dataset in a structured,
content-oriented and ﬁne-grained way and how to integrate it in
corresponding applications. We therefore analyze both Linked
Data services and traditional terminology services on how to
retrieve and ﬁlter terms for particular research-relevant charac-
teristics. It is shown that a variety of well-structured community-
speciﬁc terminologies with relevant concepts already exist, but
that community-overspanning building blocks are nevertheless
missing. Furthermore, ﬁltering and mapping particular concepts
is still a challenge to improve interdisciplinary publishing.

INTRODUCTION
The publication of research datasets is increasingly recog-
nized as an essential part of scientiﬁc research [1]. Publishing
research data in the World Wide Web has various advantages for
both the creator and the consumer of the data [2]. It facilitates
the reproducibility of research results, raises awareness and
allows to discover, reuse and repurpose existing datasets [3].
However, the publication of scientiﬁc artifacts also poses chal-
lenges, in particular regarding the description and provisioning
of a research dataset. In contrast to other types of publications,
which can traditionally be classiﬁed by librarians, research
datasets have to be annotated by the originating researcher
or at least domain experts as they are normally not self-
descriptive. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientiﬁc data
management and stewardship [4] address this challenge by
deﬁning requirements for publishing research datasets. These
principles are intended to make data discoverable to humans
and machines. Since their original publication in 2016, the
FAIR Principles have received broad support, particularly
from research journal publishers, including Springer Nature,
GigaScience, or Gates Open Research.
Based on these principles, additional information about the
dataset should be provided, such as administrative metadata
on the creator, the involved institution and publication license,
technical metadata on the media type, extent, recording software
or device, and also further domain-speciﬁc descriptive metadata.
Focusing on predicates, a set of established ontologies already
exists that can be used to provide a basic metadata description
for research datasets, including properties from initiatives,
such as the DataCite [5], Dublin Core Metadata Element
Set (DCMES) [6], DCMI Terms [7], DCAT-AP [8], MARC
[9], MODS [10], PREMIS [11], or projects like schema.org
[12]. However, approaches on providing structured content and
domain related object values are apparently still vague.
Nowadays, the provision of structured descriptive meta
information on the content of the research dataset seems often
neglected or only done in natural language in the abstract or
a separate ReadMe description of the dataset [13]. Persistent
Digital Object Identiﬁers (DOIs) are commonly provided to
reference the dataset resource itself, but other concepts that
describe characteristics of the dataset are provided as a free-
text string in many research disciplines, although controlled
vocabularies or established identiﬁers for common concepts
would be possible to use as well that also allow semantic
linking operations. This hinders the discovery and selective
ﬁltering possibilities in established data repository directories
and crawling services, especially in an interdisciplinary context.
This situation can be improved, if the meta description
of a research dataset does not only rely on predeﬁned, well-
understood properties provided by established ontologies, but
also makes heavier use of unambiguous identiﬁers for object
values in a Resource Description Framework (RDF) statement.
A Linked Data-based approach allows to deﬁne type restrictions
for the range of these object values and enables inference
operations to discover even taxonomically similar concepts
with different terms in the description.
Relying on single controlled vocabularies can only partially
solve this issue. Ontologies already include a set of predeﬁned
persistent identiﬁers for concepts but they are limited in
their expressiveness and focus only on a small scope of
characteristics that can be described. In contrary to that, a
comprehensive, atomic description of content characteristics
requires many more necessary identiﬁers that have to be
provided in a simple fashion. Sometimes, existing identiﬁers
from general-purpose services in the Web, such as DBpedia
[14], Wikidata [15] or ConceptNet [16], can be additionally
used, but research dataset related concepts are likely to be too
specialized in order to be listed there.

Even within the same research area, there can be vastly
different types of research data characteristics. National and
international research initiatives, such as the National Research
Data Infrastructure (NFDI) in Germany, have started to work
on harmonizing these terminologies into taxonomies, but we
nevertheless face a distributed scenario where to query and
retrieve existing relevant concept identiﬁers from.
Within this paper, we will discuss possibilities and chal-
lenges in querying concept identiﬁers from multiple existing
sources in the application domain of research dataset meta
descriptions. Our results can be used to build semantic-aware
Web applications in the future that can provide structured
explicit Linked Data research dataset meta descriptions with
an improved user experience. The paper is part of the PIROL
[17] PhD project about Publishing Interdisciplinary Research
over Linked Data and has the following contributions:
1) We systematize existing data sources for concepts relevant
for research dataset meta descriptions.
2) We describe a concept on how to query and ﬁlter these
decentralized knowledge bases for relevant identiﬁers.
3) We run performance measurements on how to retrieve
these identiﬁers in a Web application for research dataset
management
The rest of the paper is structured in the following way:
Section II describes the problem domain in detail and deﬁnes
requirements. Section III provides a systematic mapping of
existing knowledge sources for domain-speciﬁc research dataset
concepts. Section IV discusses a proof-of-concept and different
query strategies on how to incorporate these data sources into
an application, which is then evaluated in Section V. Section VI
contrasts our work to other existing approaches and Section VII
summarizes our results and gives an outlook to future work.

INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH DATASET
DESCRIPTION
When publishing a research dataset, additional meta infor-
mation has to be provided that can be used later so that other
researchers are able to discover it based on their particular
needs. Therefore, the corresponding meta information has to
satisfy the following ﬁve aspects:
A1 The provided information has to be correct
A2 The provided information has to be machine-readable
A3 The provided information has to be sufﬁciently extensive
A4 The provided information has to be comprehensive
A5 The provided information has to be usable across multiple
user groups
A1 is a necessity, as the provided meta information will be
the foundation to discover a particular research dataset.
A2 is given, when a separate digital metadata description
ﬁle is provided. However, this can either be done as a quite
unstructured natural-language text, in a semi-structured way
with key-value pairs, where the values can again contain
descriptive continuous text, or highly structured where both
the keys and values contain unambiguous identiﬁers.
A3 is commonly a trade-off between what can be stated
about the data set and what is relevant information to actually
discover it. An extensive number of statements can be made
to describe the research dataset, but it should focus on ﬁlter
criteria important for the consumer.
A4 asks for a certain understandability of the provided
information, both for humans and machines. The provided
terms have to represent a commonly known concept in this
knowledge domain.
A5 is important especially in an interdisciplinary context
when research data is not only relevant for a particular
community but across multiple disciplines. It should therefore
be possible to identify and link related or similar concepts.
Discovery operations nowadays commonly apply a keyword-
based or fuzzy search on existing metadata descriptions in
combination with some kind of natural language processing
and named entity recognition. The metadata description itself
concentrates on administrative meta information, whereas the
description of the dataset content is either based on plain
descriptive text or literal keywords. Figure 1 illustrates a
scenario, where a research associate publishes, e.g., a research
dataset that contains a set of recorded videos of elderly men
walking.
Figure 1. Example metadata description for a video dataset in JSON-LD.
To improve the discovery and reuse of existing research
dataset meta descriptions, such a Linked Data based approach
can be valuable. The exemplary description satisﬁes aspect
A1-A4, but we still face challenges when we want to ﬁnd this
research dataset among multiple disciplines based on certain
ﬁlter criteria. Therefore, it is necessary on one hand to provide
structured RDF statements on a research dataset subject, and on
the other hand to make use of well-known unambiguous identi-
ﬁers from controlled vocabularies for predicates and values in
these statements. In this research activity, we particularly put
focus on Uniform Resource Identiﬁers (URIs) that are provided
as object values in these descriptions to express a concrete
concept in an unambiguous way. We follow the hypothesis that
this is an important requirement to improve the interdisciplinary
discoverability of research data among multiple disciplines with
the means of terminology mapping and linking and Linked Data
inference capabilities for related concepts and sub-concepts.
In order to identify concept groups of major relevance, our
pre-analysis consisted out of three steps:

Examine established vocabularies for attribute groups
The DataCite / OpenAIRE metadata schema speciﬁcation
and schema.org/Dataset were reviewed for common
attributes and yielded the following reoccuring concept
domains: topic, resource type, (ﬁle) format/media type,
rights/license, discipline, measurement technique/device,
material, audience.
Examine UI of established research dataset repositories
We carefully analyzed the input interface for research
dataset meta description of Zenodo [18], Open Science
Framework (OSF) [19] and Mendeley 20 and identiﬁed
similar terminology groups as in the previous step.
Examine meta descriptions of existing research datasets
We veriﬁed the results through the result list of the
Google Dataset Search. Apart from the already identiﬁed
groups,
it
was
obvious
that
additional
relevant
knowledge-domain speciﬁc concepts are often mentioned
in the content description ﬁeld text such as demographic
characteristics,
examined
objects,
research
and
evaluation methods, metrics, measurement characteristics,
models or other applied paradigms.
In the following, we assume the existence of reusable
terminologies as several communities have already worked on a
standardization of such vocabularies throughout the last decades
to represent particular research-related concepts. However, this
knowledge is scattered along the entire Web in a decentralized
way and can be found in different types of data sources. This
complicates the reuse of existing terminology. In the following,
we are, therefore, interested in existing data sources that fulﬁll
the following requirements:
REQ1 DOMAIN The data source provides research-relevant terminologies of a speciﬁc
domain that can be used as object values in the meta description of a research
dataset
REQ2 SCHEME The data source provides the information in a semantic data serialization
format with a clearly deﬁned meta scheme to group and access similar concepts
REQ3 LABELING The data source provides labeled entities and persistent URIs for each
concept
REQ4 API The data source offers a mechanism to access and ﬁlter these concepts
remotely
REQ5 EXTENT The data source is actively maintained and has a complete or at least
sufﬁcient extent of entries

SOURCES FOR RESEARCH DATA CONCEPT
IDENTIFIERS
Resource URIs from DBpedia, Wikidata or ConceptNet
are commonly used in the Linked Open Data Cloud (LODC)
to provide links to nameable entities. However, they focus on
general-purpose data whereas scientiﬁc descriptions might need
a domain-specialized vocabulary that is not part of Wikipedia
or similar services. Additionally, the information there might
be incomplete or of intermediate data quality.
We therefore conducted a systematic search for alternative
sources for research dataset related concepts and mapped them
to 4 groups as mentioned in the following sections. Deprecated
or unavailable services were excluded from the mapping. We
also excluded entity related groups for which appropriate au-
thority services already exist, such as for identifying individual
persons (Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)) [21],
organizations (GRID [22], GND [23], LCCN [24], VIAF [25]),
geographical information, such as countries and cities, or
publications
A. Ontology catalogs
Ontology catalogs are a directory or collection of proposed
vocabularies with a certain focus. Within these ontology
catalogs, “1) metadata should be stored and handled based
on a well deﬁned syntax and semantics, i.e., a documented
schema, 2) the catalog software must offer both a user interface
and a widely accepted API for access by other software like
applications and data portals” [26], as shown in Table I. The
focus is set on providing standardized schemes and established
ontologies with well-known properties, but these vocabularies
might also contain (sub-)class deﬁnition or instances with a
unique identiﬁer that is appropriate to describe and ﬁlter certain
meta-data value speciﬁc concepts.

B. Authority services
Several terminology, thesauri and taxonomy services already
exist for general or speciﬁc application domains, commonly
built with the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)
vocabulary as exemplary shown in Table II. Although they are
often provided as a searchable Web page or data dump down-
load without any API, they commonly also provide uniform
resource identiﬁers and a hierarchical concept classiﬁcation.

This category basically contains all services from the Linked

D. Other concept sources
Beside these ontology, terminology and instance data
collections and services, a variety of other data sources exist
that might be relevant to retrieve concept identiﬁers. They are
typically provided on separate websites in static text ﬁles by
services like DataHub [28]. Examples are speciﬁcations, such
as CERIF [29] or KDSF [30], use case-related developments,
such as from data.gov.uk, or individual recommendations, such
as vocabularies for representing data licenses, geographical
information or ﬁle speciﬁc aspects. If these concepts are relevant
for research dataset annotation processes or tool development,
they can be downloaded and stored as a local data source and
are therefore not further considered here.
Dedicated encyclopedic dictionary services exist, such as
WordNet [31] and related projects like ConceptNet [16] or
BabelNet [32], Wiktionary [33] or OmegaWiki [34]. Applica-
tions to annotate research datasets can also beneﬁt from these
service as they can also provide APIs, but were not in the
particular focus of this research.
We also examined the usage of semantic search engines
for concept discovery and retrieval purposes. However, at the
point of writing, none of the existing Linked Data search
services from the past was publicly available and functional,
such as Swoogle [35], Sindice [36], Falcons, SWSE, LOTUS
or IBM Watson.
E. Discussion
We manually reviewed the mentioned data sources against
the relevant concept that we identiﬁed in Section II. It became
obvious that no data source contained all relevant concepts.
The list below shows exemplary data sources:
demographics BioPortal
device AberOWL, OLS, OntoBee
discipline UNESCO and other Authoritative Services
ﬁle format Static vocabularies
license Static vocabularies
measurements NCBO BioPortal
research methods LOV
Instead, we face a scattered scenario, where available
terminologies and ontologies are provided only by some
established aggregation services, or not at all (such as for certain
devices, materials, methods, metrics, models etc.). In other cases,
a researcher needs explicit knowledge on where to ﬁnd terms
for a particular knowledge domain in a decentralized landscape.
It may even be misleading, that portals related to biomedical
aspects might also identify interdisciplinary relevant concepts.
Characteristics of a research dataset meta description, such
as the topic or examined object, are challenging to systematize
at all. In these cases, the usage of established Linked Data entity
description services, such as DBpedia, Wikidata or ConceptNet,
is considerable to make use of persistent identiﬁers for a
distinguishable concept.
Beside that, the interdisciplinary reuse of existing terms
is hindered by the variety of representation formats for the
hierarchical grouping of related concepts. Using rdf:type or
a categorization is an approach commonly used by instance
data sets to state that a concept is an instance of a speciﬁc
type. Other concepts are represented as subclasses in the Web
Ontology Language (OWL) or as a terminological hierarchy in
SKOS. Hybrid approaches relying on SKOS and certain RDF
Schema (RDFS) and OWL properties do also exist.
IV.
AD-HOC TERMINOLOGY QUERYING
In practice, frontend Web applications to describe research
datasets contain input interfaces where users have to enter or
select a particular concept with a certain domain focus. Text
input of literals is still dominating. Auto-suggestion elements
can be applied in combination with Linked Data sources [37]
so that a user can select the correct concept out of a list of
existing concepts which can be solely based on the input literal
or restricted to a certain concept type. In order to bridge the
gap between existing terminology and ontology services and
frontend user interaction, we focus on concept queries that can
retrieve RDF statements (description, URI, etc.) for a given
concept label/URI or which can retrieve a list of concepts based
on a given type or super class via the SPARQL Protocol and
RDF Query Language.
When relevant databases, such as listed in Section III, exist
and the requirements from Section II are satisﬁed, it is possible
to query concepts of a particular characteristic, as shown in
Figure 2, by either
• importing relevant terminologies in a centralized data base
• running follow-up queries along relevant data sources
• using federated query approaches along multiple endpoints.
Figure 2. Conceptual architecture of a Concept Query Component.
The ConceptQuerier component provides a WebAPI that
accepts requests with parameters stating the data the user has
already entered in a text input ﬁeld together with optional
ﬁlters that describe the scope of the concepts that shall be
retrieved. Such a component might analyze these parameters
in advance and then query a set of appropriate services for
existing concepts. This can either be done until the ﬁrst Web
service is able to satisfy the scope and returns corresponding
concept data or in a parallel fashion, where the ConceptQuerier
aggregates the results of multiple Web service responses.
Querying a remote service for a label or entity URI is
considered as an already-understood trivial task. However,
restricting existing resources based on ﬁlters requiring a
particular class is more challenging as the type and hierarchy
of an entity has to be identiﬁed additionally and the name of
this type can either be ﬁltered based on a keyword or based
on a qualiﬁed identiﬁer as conceptually shown in Figure 3.

?query contains the type restriction of the Web application text input ﬁeld.

EVALUATION
We have implemented a software prototype [38] as a proof
of concept of such a ConceptQuerier in a NodeJS based
Web application. It offers a simple Web form with multiple
text input ﬁelds which have an auto-suggest extension that
provides concepts of a corresponding scope. After entering
a keyword in such a text ﬁeld, an AJAX request is created
and sent to local a /suggest REST API endpoint of our demo
application, containing the entered literal string and a list of
ﬁlter expressions deﬁned in advance by a developer based
on the domain scope of the input ﬁeld in a JSON string.
The ConceptQuerier implements a simple query strategy to
SPARQL endpoints investigated in this paper to the Wikidata
and DBpedia SPARQL endpoint. It ﬁrst retrieves a list of
matching concept URIs and then executes a DESCRIBE on
each entity URI to get additional meta information for each
of these concepts.
We used this application to measure a selection of indicators
for service quality and data quality metrics of the identiﬁed
concept data sources in order to assess to which extent they
are appropriate in practice to retrieve Linked Data identiﬁers
for concepts of a particular knowledge domain. We therefore
focused on a PopulationCompletenessMetric, RelevanceMetric
and LatencyMetric calculated on the extent (Table IV) and
processing time (Table V) for the retrieved result list for
four exemplary concept groups: gender (for a structural
interdisciplinary demographic characteristic), license (for a data-
related, interdisciplinary aspect), ﬁle format(for a computer
domain-speciﬁc characteristic) and research method (for a
research-concept oriented characteristic).
Querying via a SPARQL endpoint concrete concept labels
or concept URIs was a trivial task. Retrieving concepts which
are an instance or sub concept of a certain class was also
straight-forward and yielded results in less than 1.0 second as
long as caching strategies were established (**) or the entity
URI of the super concept is known. However, this is typically
not the case and includes a tedious manual lookup activity. And
these URIs differ in practice between multiple data sources
as long as no linking/inference operation is executed in the
background. We therefore focused on a keyword-based search
for appropriate super classes and retrieved a list of concepts
based on these classes. This aspect and the measured latency
times make these concept queries inappropriate for federated
SPARQL approaches.
We evaluated at least one appropriate representative for
each of the identiﬁed data source groups. For ontology catalogs,
candidates were the BioPortal and LOV. Querying the BioPortal
Ontology Catalog had to be done over the REST API and
included the manual retrieval of subclasses from identiﬁed
ontologies (*), as the provided SPARQL interface was only
in beta status and limited to ontology meta information. For
authoritative terminology services, we focused on EuroVoc and
additionally provided EU Named Authority Lists. For instance
data collections, we selected Wikidata and the LODCache. But
the SPARQL endpoint of LODCache always ended with a
timeout without text search index optimizations. Instead, we
therefore considered DBpedia.

We used existing fulltext index query extensions of the
services, where possible. Retrieving concepts based on a
keyword search in associated class labels had the advantage
that also concepts from different but similar groups could be
retrieved (e.g., a query via Wikidata for instances containing
the string ”license” also returned 435 relevant concepts from
groups, such as ”software license”, ”free license” or ”data
copyright license”, in comparison to a URI based constraint
wd:Q207621 with only 47 results). However, this also resulted
in extended processing times which were ten times higher
in our experiment than in the explicit case, and might also
lead to false-positive results (the search for concepts related
to ”gender” in Wikidata, e.g., returned 546 results, where
the majority instantiated the group ”tennis tournament edition
by gender”). Additionally, the terms used for describing a
certain concept class differed between the services (”License”
vs. ”Licence”, ”Media Type” vs. ”File Format”, or ”Research
Method” vs. ”Scientiﬁc Method”).

False-positive results also originated from the data basis
of the data provider itself. Queries for ”File Format”, e.g., in
Wikidata and DBpedia returned many concepts with multiple
literal duplicates representing the same concept with additional
appendices in the label, or no ﬁle format at all. Despite the
high number of results from instance data providers for this use
case, a high-quality population completeness was not given as
some concepts were still missing. But using this kind of data
sources for retrieving other specialized concept groups (such
as research objects, devices, material) was still a valid strategy
in comparison to approaches based on general taxonomies or
ontology catalogs, where none of these concepts might be
provided in a controlled fashion at all.
Searching for other, research-speciﬁc entities, such as a
research method, revealed actual weaknesses of the tested data
sources. Surprisingly, 3 out of 4 tested data sources returned
some results for such a concept class. However, the obtained
concept results were limited and also contained inappropriate
concepts, e.g., from DBpedia. Services providing research-
oriented, domain speciﬁc taxonomies or ontologies are a better
choice in such a case as they commonly provide controlled
terms and vocabularies.
From a technical point of view, it is demonstrated that a
ConceptQuerier with a homogeneous interface to query multiple
Linked Data concept sources was feasible to implement. How-
ever, separate queries had to be carefully designed for each data
provider as the underlying data model differed on how concepts
are classiﬁed into groups, based on rdf:type, rdfs:Class/subClass
relationships, skos:broader or even skos:inScheme.

RELATED WORK
Using standardized identiﬁers to classify publications is
already common for decades in a librarian environment [39–
41]. Authoritative services exist there to represent entities, such
as authors, disciplines, keywords, publications and publishers
[42]. In this context, the usage of Linked Data in a librarian
environment was discussed and applied multiple times [43].
However, this topic also became increasingly important for the
description and discovery of other scientiﬁc publication artifacts.
Especially the publication of research datasets requires expert
insights where only the originating researcher can precisely
provide a meta description of the provided content. Embedded li-
brarians [44] might help to reuse existing classiﬁcation systems,
but interdisciplinary data exchange requires atomic research
concepts [45] from established terminologies to support Quality-
Driven Information Filtering among different disciplines [46].
The Semantic Web community has already presented concepts
on federated SPARQL engines [47], and how to execute
SPARQL queries over the Web of Data [48] and how to establish
links between similar concepts from multiple ontologies [49].
Beyond that, science put emphasis on the development of
ontologies, such as DataCite, SWAP, LinkedScience, SciData
or ModSci], for modelling relationships between scientiﬁc
branches and scientiﬁc entities with a focus on established
predicates. Querying and proxying decentralized data sources,
such as NCBO, was discussed for single examples, such as
the BioPortal [50] or ONKI [51]. Beside that, general-purpose
encyclopedia and thesaurus-based terminology-providing ser-
vices exist [52, 53]. Dedicated semantic terminology services
providing concrete interdisciplinary concepts are still rare and
limited to discipline-speciﬁc approaches, such as [54]. In both
cases, relying on a single API to query for particular concepts
will fail if these terminologies are very speciﬁc and not present
in the knowledge base of the addressed service. Research dataset
related concepts might be such an example, where an approach
to query speciﬁc data sources as presented in this paper can
provide better results.
VII.
CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented an analysis of data sources that
provide labels and persistent identiﬁers for concepts that can
be used as values in meta descriptions of research datasets
and other interdisciplinary relevant scientiﬁc publications. We
have identiﬁed four groups of potentially relevant services
(ontology catalogs, authoritative services, instance dataset
collections, static independent vocabularies). We provided an
implementation of a Web-based prototype that is capable of
querying these remote concept sources based on a particular
concept scope represented by a concrete type or class label. In
an evaluation, we showed a varying service and data quality of
existing data sources. Response times, especially for a keyword-
based class search, are still too high to consider remote services
for ad-hoc queries in real-time user interaction. Apart from that,
different underlying data models require adapted query patterns
for each data service which make federated query approaches
difﬁcult in practice. From a content-perspective, we still face
a scattered distributed scenario, as none of the data sources
provided a set of discipline-overspanning, research-focusing,
interdisciplinary-usable concepts in a single point of access. To
improve the interdisciplinary discovery and reuse of research
datasets, additional research in the future is needed.
