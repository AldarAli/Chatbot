and designed in this paper for the purpose of detecting any 
collision between the end effector and peripheral equipment 
(e.g., fixture) for the three degrees of freedom hybrid robotic 
manipulator when it is in operation. The new design is 
illustrated and modelled. The capacitance, sensitivity and 
frequency response of the detector are analyzed in detail, and 
finally, the fabrication process is presented. The proposed 
collision detector can also be applied to other machine tools.

INTRODUCTION 
       A capacitor is defined as two conductors that can hold 
opposite charges. If the distance and relative position 
between two conductors change due to the external force, 
the capacitance value will be changed. This is the basic 
principle of capacitive sensing, which belongs to 
electrostatic sensing. The major advantages of electrostatic 
sensing can be concluded as follows: firstly, it is simple. No 
special functional materials are required. The sensing 
principle is easy to implement, requiring only two 
conducting surfaces. Secondly, it has the characteristic of a 
fast response. Capacitor-based sensing has high response 
speed due to the fact that the transition speed is controlled 
by the charging and discharging time constants that are 
small for good conductors [1]. There are two kinds of 
capacitive electrode geometries: parallel plate capacitor 
and interdigitated finger capacitor. For the interdigitated 
finger capacitor, it can be regarded as many parallel plate 
capacitors combining together. One side of the finger is 
fixed and the other side is suspended, and can move in one 
or more axes.  
       Parallel mechanisms have been widely used in 
different kinds of areas, such as machine tools as shown in 
Figure 1. When machine tools are in operation, it is 
sometimes unavoidable to hit the peripheral equipment 
(e.g., fixture) by the tool, which can damage cutting tools, 
clamps and fixtures as shown in Figure 2, or cause damage 
to the machine itself, which undermines the performance of 
the whole parallel robotic system, and delays the 
productions. Therefore, how to prevent the collisions 
during machining is very important for the machining 
process. When the end-effector/tool of parallel robotic 
machine tool accidently hits the peripheral equipment, e.g., 
fixture, an operator usually finds it, and hits the emergency 
stop button, but there is always a time delay. The machine 
tool should ideally stop immediately when the tool hits the 
peripheral equipment so that it does not cause further 
damage. Based on this need and motivation, a sensor 
should be developed to address this goal. Some computer 
aided manufacturing software has the ability to perform a 
machine collision check, but some machine tools do not 
have this function. Most computer aided manufacturing 
programs 
determine 
the 
cutter 
paths, 
considering 
sometimes just the tool. In machine tools, it is likely to 
drive the end effector outside the bounds, resulting in a 
collision with others. Many machine tools are not aware of 
the surrounding environment. The end effector just follows 
the code and it is totally dependent on an operator to detect 
if a crash occurs. 
       Imagine the following scenario: when the tool hits the 
fixture, there should be a vibration produced. So, the 
question is how to harness this vibration and convert the 
vibration to an electrical signal that can be recognized by a 
computer. Capacitive based sensor depends on the physical 
parameter changing, e.g., the space between the plates and 
the dielectric constant between them, etc. For example, in 
the vehicle air bag deployment system, a crash acceleration 
makes one plate closer to the other, and therefore triggers 
the bag to deploy. Inspired by this idea, a capacitance-
based collision detector/sensor is designed that can sense 
the vibration and convert the vibration to an electrical 
signal.  
       In [2], vibration on a rotating spindle is generated by 
the sum of the variations in weight distribution. The

corrective action is needed to have a force with an equal 
but opposite direction to cancel the imbalance condition. 
The first step to achieve this is to measure the vibration. 
There, a vibration sensor is installed in a grinding machine 
spindle, and the vibration is measured using a vibration 
sensor that is composed of a seismic mass that is connected 
to a piezoelectric transducer which converts the vibration 
into an electric signal. The above scenario mainly measures 
the amount of vibration that the rotating spindle produced 
and it is not appropriate to use here as a collision detector. 
In [3], the chatter vibration is detected by using three 
different acceleration sensors that are attached to three 
different axis of the machine tool. In [4], a web learning 
tool with 3D simulation for axial table collision detection 
was proposed, but no device has been designed. In [5], a 
vibration detection algorithm was proposed and a speed 
regulator was designed for the backlash vibration of a 
machine tool. In [6], a new approach was presented to 
detect and avoid hard and soft collisions caused by user 
errors, and a capacitance based sensor was briefly 
mentioned for the collision of the machine tools, but it did 
not explicitly design and propose the capacitance based 
collision sensor. In [7], a six-dimensional wrist force/torque 
sensor based on E-type membranes is designed and 
fabricated, and it is applied onto the five-axis parallel 
machine tool to measure the tool forces and torques. The 
previous one is force/torque sensor (used to detect forces 
and moments), but that is not a vibration sensor. 
       In this paper, a collision detection sensor is designed 
that can sense the vibration that the end-effector caused 
when the tool accidently hits the fixture. When the tool 
accidently hits the ground or an object, it will produce 
vibration, the vibration will make the distance of the 
capacitor change, and therefore trigger the machine to stop 
immediately. No one has ever designed the collision 
detector that gears towards the situation that the machine 
tool should stop immediately when the end-effector hits the 
peripheral equipment.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, 
the new design will be illustrated. The capacitance and 
sensitivity will be discussed in Section 3. Section 4 
analyzes the resonant frequency of the detector, and finally 
fabrication process is presented in Section 5.  
 
II. 
NEW DESIGN 
Capacitive sensing depends on the physical parameter 
changing either the spacing between the two plates or the 
dielectric constant. Our vibration sensing method is based 
on this idea.  
One side of the finger-like capacitor is attached to the 
moving platform of the hybrid robotics manipulator, and 
the other side of the finger-like capacitor is attached to the 
tool as shown in Figure 3. The details and its dimensions 
are shown in Figures 4 and 5. When the tool accidently hits 
the ground or an object, it will vibrate and the distance 
between the fingers will change and therefore, the 
capacitance will change and trigger the machine to stop.

Figure 5.  Capacitance based collision detector  
 
The capacitance between a pair of fingers is 
contributed by the surface of fingers in the overlapped 
region. Capacitance derived from multiple pairs are 
connected in parallel, so the total capacitance is the 
summation of capacitance contributed by neighboring 
fingers.  
 
III. 
CAPACITANCE AND SENSITIVITY 
       For a single fixed finger and its two neighboring 
moving fingers, there are two capacitances associated with 
each finger pair, one is the left-side of the finger, denoted 
as 
l
C , and the other is the right-side of the finger, denoted 
as 
r
C . When the tool is not vibrating, the values of these 
two capacitance is the same, i.e.,: 
                               
0
l

where  
0
  is the permittivity of the vacuum, l  is the 
engaged overlapping distance of the fingers, t is the 
thickness of the fingers, d  is the distance between a fixed-
comb finger and its neighboring movable finger. 
A. Movement along y direction  
       When the tool accidently hits the fixture, the tool will 
vibrate, the free finger will move by a distance, say x, and 
then the capacitance values of these two capacitors become 
the following:

           (4)  
For a case study, suppose there are 13 fingers, which means 
there are 12 capacitors, so the 12 capacitors will contribute 
the total capacitance of the device. So the above can be 
rewritten as follows: 
                        C = 12

This change can be transferred to the electrical signal, and 
under a certain value, it means the machine tool is in the 
process of manufacturing. Even though there are small 
vibrations, the capacitance change is under that value, and 
the capacitance will not trigger the electrical controller to 
stop the machine. When, however, the capacitance change 
is very large, then the capacitor will trigger the controller to 
stop the machine immediately. This takes place if the 
condition of the pieces is softer than the fixture. When the 
pieces are stiffer than the fixture, we need to set the 
condition so that when the capacitance is under that value, 
the capacitor needs to trigger the controller to stop the 
machine. When the vibration is above that value, the 
capacitor will not trigger the controller to stop the machine. 
In other words, under a certain value range, the capacitance 
change is not sensitive (big) enough to trigger the 
controller to stop the machine, which is under the condition 
that the piece is softer than fixture. Also, that certain value 
needs to be determined by experimentation.

stiffer than fixture. Also, that certain value needs to be 
determined by experimentation.

The capacitor will trigger the controller to stop the machine 
       Set the decision logic to a certain value, the decision 
logic will receive a signal from the capacitor/sensor to 
determine if it is actually manufacturing or a collision. We 
can set the logic to negative value when the pieces are 
stiffer than fixture. The sensor will not decide if the contact 
is the beginning of a collision or simply defines the 
manufacturing pieces. This is the function of the decision 
logic [6]. If the value is larger or smaller than a certain 
value that was given to the logic, then the detector/sensor 
will trigger the machine to stop or not to stop. It is related 
to the decision logic module design, which has been out of 
the authors’ research scope, and can be done as a future 
work.  The main purpose of this paper is the idea of using 
the capacitive principle based method to design the 
collision sensor.  
       In terms of when the cutting tool breaks the moment it 
hits the fixture, this must be the condition that the fixture is 
harder than the piece. If it is in that case, as being said 
above, i.e., under certain value range, the capacitance 
change is not sensitive (big) enough to trigger the 
controller to stop the machine when the tool is in the 
process of manufacturing. Also, that certain value needs to 
be determined by experimentation. Ideally, when the tool 
hits the fixture, the detector/sensor will trigger the machine 
to stop immediately, so the tool will not break. The worst 
case scenario is when the tool breaks, at which point the 
capacitance will also change, so it will trigger the machine 
to stop. Either way, no matter if the tool breaks or not, if 
the capacitance change is above that value, then it will 
trigger the machine to stop.  
       However, during motions, the rate of capacitance 
change can be measured; this rate of change can also be 
called the displacement sensitivity. It is obtained by taking 
the derivative of C with respect to x, and we can have the 
following, 
 
                   S(x) = C

The above is under the movement along the y direction 
(transverse). Transverse comb drive devices are frequently 
used for sensing the sensitivity and they are easy to 
fabricate.                                                  
B. Movement along x direction 
       When the movement is along the x direction, we have 
the following, (note that the movement along z direction is 
very small or none because the suspension beam is along 
the z direction, which blocks the movement along z 
direction), there are 13 fingers, which means there are 12 
capacitors, so the 12 capacitors will contribute the total 
capacitance of the device. At rest, the total capacitance is:

                              (7) 
 
When there is force in x direction, which will make the 
fingers move in the x direction, this will cause the effective 
thickness t’ to change. Suppose the change value is x. 
Under the above changed condition the capacitance will 
change to the following:

as a function of applied displacement) can be expressed as

Where 1l  is the suspension beam length, E  is the Young’s 
modulus, w  is the width of the finger, t is the thickness of 
the finger, the resonant frequency value is dependent on the 
above parameters, a different parameter will result in 
different values.

FABRICATION 
       Silicon bulk micromachining is the process that 
involves partial removal of bulk material in order to create 
three dimensional structures or free suspended devices. 
Etching is a subtractive process that removes materials. 
Etching can be divided into two categories; one is wet 
etching and the other is dry etching. For the wet etching, 
the liquid etchants can be acids and hydroxides; for the dry 
etching, we have the physical etching (impact of 
atoms/ions), reactive ions and enhanced by RF energy. 
Isotropic etching can give rounded profiles and anisotropic 
etching can yield flat surfaces.  
       A process for prototyping is illustrated in the following 
Figure. If we draw a vertical line that cuts across both sets 
of fingers in Figure 3, we will get the cross section as 
shown in Figure 6. Here we only drew two of the 13 fingers 
in the cross section for the purpose of clearly illustrating 
the fabrication process. These are the two floating 
rectangles in the final step.

CONCLUSION 
       In this paper, a capacitance based collision detector is 
designed in order to detect any collisions between tool and 
peripheral equipment to prevent further damage to the 
machines. The new design is illustrated and modelled. The 
capacitance, sensitivity, and frequency response of the 
detector are analyzed in detail, and the fabrication process 
is finally presented. The proposed collision detector can 
also be applied to other machine tools. Future work will 
build the prototype to test the proposed detector in the real 
application scenarios.
