Abstract—This paper describes a framework for annotation
on travel blogs based on subjectivity (FATS). The framework
has the capability to auto-annotate -sentence by sentence-
sections from blogs (posts) about travelling in the Spanish
language. FATS is used in this experiment to annotate com-
ponents from travel blogs in order to create a corpus of
300 annotated posts. Each subjective element in a sentence
is annotated as positive or negative as appropriate. Currently
correct annotations add up to about 95 per cent in our subset
of the travel domain. By means of an iterative process of
annotation we can create a subjectively annotated domain
speciﬁc corpus.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Social Web [1] has enabled humans to express and
share their opinions and concerns to the World. One of the
tools to share data and information within the net is a Blog.
According to the WordPress [2] online dictionary, a blog, or
weblog, is an online journal, diary, or serial published by a
person or group of people.
Currently, there are several platforms such as Blogger
APPis of Google [3] or APPis of MyBlogLog of Yahoo [4]
that offer blogs classiﬁed according to several taxonomies
including classes such as personal, business, non-proﬁts,
politics, etc [2]. Travel blogs belong to the personal class.
In this work, the authors take into consideration the
following premises:
• According to [2] the type of blog, those studied belong
to the personal class.
• The Blogs of study belong to the travel domain in
Spanish language.
• The writing process used by bloggers to express their
ideas depends on age, context, time, culture and geo-
graphic place.
• Despite the availability of good practices on the web to
preserve the quality of writing, for instance FS250062
[5], most bloggers express their opinions in very het-
erogeneous ways.
• The blogs have several components including title,
banner, tagboard, links, archives and posts.
• The posts of each blog keep their chronological order.
• Some of the elements of posts are positive or negative
or both.
Considering all this, the scientiﬁc hypothesis of our re-
search is to auto-annotate the bloggers’ expressions based
on their subjectivity with at least 90% recall and precision
for posts. The methodology used in this research is top-down
in contrast to the Folksonomies methodology [6] where the
main aim is to annotate collaboratively the social web.
This research deals with corpora in two dimensions:
linguistic and technical. The linguistic dimension refers to
the selection of sentences and their elements of the posts.
The technical dimension encodes, builds the meta-model for
annotation and annotates the posts.
Linguistic dimension:
• The sentence selection is based on ﬁnding blogs with
two main components: 1) the title, and 2) the ﬁrst post.
Technical dimension:
• The encoding is based on the standard ANSI/NISO
Z39.19-2005 [7] to represent parts of a sentence and,
in addition, to add the mark P for positive and N for
negative.
• Annotation is based on bracketing conventions of seg-
ments according to the recommendations for the mor-
phosyntactic annotation of corpora in tagging from
lexical data (EAGLES96) [8].
• The meta-model for annotation is represented by eight
patterns proposed in this research (see Section IV).
In order to analyze the bloggers’ expressions, a subset
of an ad-hoc corpus collected by [9] is used. This corpus
consists of 10 thousand words extracted from Spanish blogs,
sampled from a comprehensive range of travel blogs.
The aim of this work is to automatically recognize the
positive or negative elements of the posts and annotate them.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
Section II brieﬂy discusses the related work. In Sections III
and IV, the detailed functionalities of FATS are presented.
Section V brieﬂy evaluates the performance of the frame-
work proposed. Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.
II. RELATED WORK
The related work dealt with takes into account three
topics: subjectivity, lexicons and annotation.

A. Subjectivity
According to Wiebe [10], subjectivity is ”the linguistic
expression of somebody’s opinions, sentiments, emotions,
evaluations, beliefs, and speculations”.
Research work on subjectivity includes: Kanayama and
Nasukawa [11] who built some domain-dependent polarity
lexicons for Japanese language; Andreevskaia and Bergler
[12] proposed various methods for learning subjectivity from
WordNet. Esuli and Sebastiani [13] proposed a method for
identifying both, the subjectivity and prior polarity of a
word, also using WordNet. Wiebe and Mihalcea [14] were
able to automatically identify whether a particular word was
subjective or not, using a computer program. Kim and Hovy
[15] used small seed sets and WordNet to identify sets of
subjective adjectives and verbs, and Kobayashi et al. [16]
identiﬁed domain-dependent sets of subjective expressions.
This work is based on the subjectivity classiﬁcation for the
previous research work.
B. Lexicons
According to [17], a general deﬁnition of a lexicon is
”the vocabulary of a language that contains all the words or
LEXEMES in the language”. A more speciﬁc one suitable
for our domain dependent research is ”Word stores that are
primarily consulted for the reason of information retrieval
are referred to as ”dictionaries”. By contrast, word-stores
that constitute a component within a natural language pro-
cessing system are called a lexicon [18], the LEXICON is
understood broadly as a ﬁnite list of stored forms and the
possibilities for combining them”.
Previous research has focused on the creation of lexicons
in English such as: Higashinaka [19] who used a set of
dialogues to build her own lexicon. Lexicons are also avail-
able as linguistic resources in the Internet, some examples
are SentiWordnet [20], NTU Sentiment Dictionary [21],
Opinion Finders subjectivity Lexicon [22], etc. However
our research relies on a controlled vocabulary that tries to
eliminate noise by providing a list of preferred and non-
preferred terms and a domain-semantic structure in Spanish.
Therefore, the lexicon built by [9] was taken as reference.
The process for creating this lexicon was the following: a)
key terms used in valorative sentences are extracted and
b) words or groups of words with positive or negative
sentiment are selected for the lexicon. The ﬁnal classes
were nouns, adjectives, diminutives, preﬁxes, verbs, adverbs,
interjections, and idioms taken from the language sample.
C. Annotation
Although there are many Spanish Corpora involving
grammatical analysis or annotation of Spanish texts (e.g.,
Atwell [23]) and a signiﬁcant number of software libraries
developed at universities to annotate texts (Exmaralda [24]
and MMax 2 [25] tools). However, no research has been
found on annotating each component of a post -as positive
or negative- as appropriate. The closest results were found
to be by [23], [24], [25] and their results evaluated only part
of speech tagging. Our proposal is based on the subjectively
annotation of posts of blogs supported by a reference-
subjectivity lexicon.
The Corpus of blogs used for this research consists of
10 thousand words of Spanish written blogs, sampled from
a comprehensive range of blog within the travel domain.
For this research annotation is the process of attaching
subjectivity information to the posts which can be opinions,
evaluations, emotions and beliefs. It consists of two main
steps: identifying elements on the post, and attaching polar-
ity information to these elements.
The process for annotation in our research is aligned
with the automatic annotation of three linguistic levels:
morphosyntactic, syntactic and semantic.
• At the morphosyntactic level, a word is divided into its
root and sufﬁxes.
• At the syntactic level, the lexico-syntactic representa-
tion of nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs (positive
or negative or both) -all of them based on the lexicon
proposed by [9]- are mapped according to the eight
patterns proposed in Section IV.
• At the semantic level, the eight patterns (see Section
IV) link the relationships between each word in each
sentence of the posts.
III. FRAMEWORK OF FATS
The general architecture of FATS consists in a series of
components performing sequential transformations on an
input blog. The architecture is structured into four layers:
Data Source, Matching Components, Analysis Components
and Result Components, as shown in Fig. 1.
• Data Source: this layer contains the basic elements of
blogs (see Fig. 2) required by the FATS.
• Matching Components: this second layer contains the
main matching engineering functionality carried out
through the analysis of components. Additionally, other
components such as selector, split up, match, patterns
and blogger-opinion are shown.
• Analysis Components: this middle layer contains the
main linguistic levels of analysis in the blog: mor-
phosyntactic, syntactic and semantic as explained in the
introduction section.
• Result Components: the last layer contains the posts
subjectively annotated of the blogs.
The relationships among the different components of the
framework of FATS are explained below:
First of all, blogs are collected in digitized documents
from the WWW throughout Heritrix [26] as an example the
authors made a job limited by scope and frontier. Next, they
are taken to the matching components where the blogs are
structured and modelled on separated components such as

titles and posts. Then, the selector component takes the ﬁrst
post and matches it with the related patterns (see Fig. 3); we
do not match with the titles yet. In this stage, the analysis is
conducted by the syntactic, morphosyntactic and semantic
components. The syntactic analysis is done by mapping
onto the lexico-syntactic representation of nouns, adjectives,
verbs and adverbs (positive or negative or both) all of them
based on the lexicon proposed by [9]. In the next stage, the
morphological component processes a word into its smallest
meaningful components, or morphemes. This is done by
dividing a word into its root and sufﬁxes. Subsequently, the
semantic component establishes the relationships between
each word in each sentence. Finally, the posts are placed in
bags, which in turn have the annotated posts of blogs that
determine the polarity of subjective expressions of the terms
included in the posts.
IV. PATTERNS
For this research, we created eight different patterns as
shown in Fig. 3, based on the most common structure type.
Each pattern describes how the experiment interacts with
the proposed framework (see algorithm 1) to achieve a new
section of annotated posts. The 8 specialized patterns are
represented by the following equations:
∀x, y.Sentence(x, y) → Subject(x) ⊓ Predicate(y).


∀x.Subject(x) → ∃Art(x) ⊓ Noun(x)

The part of speech tagging schemes are: s (subject), nc
(noun complement), na (noun adjective), d (article), vc (verb
complement), pp and p (preposition). Also, Table 1 presents
an example of a post annotated using FATS. In this case the
annotation scheme [8] was used to tag the posts elements.
The bracketing of each element in the sentence involves the
delimitation with square brackets.
V. PERFORMANCE RESULTS
In order to evaluate the quality of the structural markup,
we calculated the recall and precision rates produced by
FATS, as shown in formulas (10) and (11), where RW means
Retrieved Words.
precision = |{relevant(NP ∪ AP ∪ AdP ∪ V P)} ∩ {RW}|
|{RW}|
(10)
recall = |{relevant(NP ∪ AP ∪ AdP ∪ V P)} ∩ {RW}|
|{relevant (NP ∪ AP ∪ AdP ∪ V P)}|
(11)
The ﬁrst task is to analyze whether each post is grammat-
ically and semantically correct or not as shown in algorithm
1. If the post is incorrect grammatically/semantically, FATS
ends the task of analysis and cannot continue with the
process of annotation. However, anytime a post is both
grammatically and semantically correct FATS produces a
YES answer, at the same time comparing each element with
the proposed patterns (see Section IV). The results are shown
in Table 2 where a collection of 180 sentences of the 100
posts are tagged.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
This paper presented FATS, a framework for tagging
posts of blogs by using a table of symbols of subjectivity,
a lexicon of reference [9], and eight patterns of analysis.
Our framework automatically builds a subjectively annotated
domain speciﬁc corpus by analyzing morphosyntactic, syn-
tactic and semantic levels of posts with at least 90% recall
and precision. The corpus resulting from this research can
be used as it is for other applications because it is easy to
integrate in other processes. We can see as shown in Fig. 4
that the accuracy of FATS in the tagging of NP, AP and VP
is higher than in the tagging of AdP. However, the difference

is negligible and thus, it does not represent a limit for the
present research. Future work will be done with ontologies
to enrich and improve FATS.
