Abstract—By now, computers and software have spread into 
all fields of industry. Therefore, extensive efforts are currently 
made in order to improve the safety by applying certain 
numerical solutions. For many engineering problems involving 
shock and impact, there is no single ideal numerical method 
that can reproduce the various aspects of a problem. An 
approach which combines different techniques in a single 
numerical analysis can provide the “best” solution in terms of 
accuracy and efficiency. This paper presents a set of numerical 
simulations of ballistic tests, which analyze the effects of armor 
structures. The goal is to find an appropriate technique for 
simulating composite materials and thereby improve modern 
armor to meet current challenges. To have the correct material 
model available is not enough. In this work, the main 
simulation methodologies are compared to create a perfect 
model for different armor structures. The calculation should 
match ballistic trials and be used as the basis for further 
studies. Given the complexity of penetration processes, it is not 
surprising that the bulk of work in this area is experimental in 
nature. Terminal ballistic test techniques, aside from routine 
proof tests, vary mainly in the degree of instrumentation 
provided and hence the amount of data retrieved. Here, both 
the ballistic trials as well as the analytical methods will be 
discussed.

INTRODUCTION  
In the security sector, failing industrial components are 
ongoing problems that cause great concern as they can 
endanger people and equipment. Therefore, extensive efforts 
are currently made in order to improve the safety of 
industrial components by applying certain computer-based 
solutions. To deal with problems involving the release of a 
large amount of energy over a very short period of time, e.g., 
explosions and impacts, there are three approaches, which 
are discussed in detail in [1]. 
As the problems are highly non-linear and require 
information regarding material behavior at ultra-high loading 
rates, which are generally not available, most of the work is 
experimental 
and 
may 
cause 
tremendous 
expenses. 
Analytical approaches are possible if the geometries 
involved are relatively simple and if the loading can be 
described through boundary conditions, initial conditions, or 
a combination of the two. Numerical solutions are far more 
general in scope and remove any difficulties associated with 
geometry [2].  
For structures under shock and impact loading, numerical 
simulations have proven to be extremely useful. They 
provide a rapid and less expensive way to evaluate new 
design ideas. Numerical simulations can supply quantitative 
and accurate details of stress, strain, and deformation fields 
that would be very costly or difficult to reproduce 
experimentally. In these numerical simulations, the partial 
differential equations governing the basic physics principles 
of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy are 
employed. The equations to be solved are time-dependent 
and nonlinear in nature. These equations, together with 
constitutive models describing material behavior and a set of 
initial and boundary conditions, define the complete system 
for shock and impact simulations. 
The governing partial differential equations need to be 
solved in both time and space domains (see Figure 1). The 
solution for the time domain can be achieved by an explicit 
method. In the explicit method, the solution at a given point 
in time is expressed as a function of the system variables and 
parameters, with no requirements for stiffness and mass 
matrices. Thus, the computing time at each time step is low 
but may require numerous time steps for a complete solution.  
The solution for the space domain can be obtained 
utilizing different spatial discretization techniques, such as 
Lagrange [3], Euler [4], Arbitrary Lagrange Euler (ALE) [5], 
or “mesh free” methods [6]. Each of these techniques has its 
unique capabilities, but also limitations. Usually, there is not 
a single technique that can cope with all the regimes of a 
problem [7].

This work will focus on high-speed dynamics, esp. 
impact simulations. By using a computer-aided design 
(CAD) 
neutral 
environment 
that 
supports 
direct, 
bidirectional, and associative interfaces with CAD systems, 
the geometry can be optimized successively. Native CAD 
geometry can be used directly without a translation to IGES 
or other intermediate geometry formats [8]. An example is 
given in Figure 2.  
The work will also provide a brief overview of ballistic 
tests to offer some basic knowledge of the subject, serving as 
a basis for the comparison and verification of the simulation 
results.  
The objective of this work is to compare current 
simulation methodologies to find the most suitable model for 
high-speed dynamics and impact studies. Lagrange, Euler, 
ALE, and “mesh free” methods, as well as combinations of 
these methods, are described and applied to a modern amor 
structure impacted by a projectile. It aims to clarify the 
following issues: What is the most suitable simulation 
model? How does the mesh density affect the results? What 
are the benefits of high-performance computing? 
The results shall be used to improve the safety of ballistic 
structures, esp. for armored vehicles. Instead of running 
expensive trials, numerical simulations should be applied to 
identify vulnerabilities of structures. Contrary to the 
experimental results, numerical methods allow an easy and 
comprehensive study of all mechanical parameters.  
Modeling will also help to understand how the armor 
schemes behave during impact and how the failure processes 
can be controlled to our advantage.  
After a brief introduction and description of the different 
methods of space discretization in Section III, there is a short 
section on ballistic trials where the experimental set-up is 
depicted, followed by Section V describing the analysis with 
numerical simulations. In Section VI, the influence of high-
performance computing is emphasized. The paper ends with 
a concluding paragraph. 
II. 
STATE-OF-THE-ART 
Simulating penetration and perforation events requires a 
numerical technique that allows one body (penetrator) to 
pass 
through 
another 
(target). 
Traditionally, 
these 
simulations have been performed using either an Eulerian 
approach, i.e., a non-deformable (fixed) mesh with material 
advecting among the cells, or using a Lagrangian approach, 
i.e., a deformable mesh with large deformations. The main 
point of criticism of the Eulerian approach has been that the 
shape of the penetrating body, usually an idealized rigid 
projectile, becomes “fuzzy” as the penetration simulation 
proceeds, due to the mixing of advected materials in the 
fixed Eulerian cells. Lagrangian methods require some form 
of augmentation to minimize or eliminate large mesh 
distortions. The so-called “pilot hole” technique and the 
material erosion are the two most often used augmentations 
for Lagrangian penetration simulations. In the pilot hole 
technique, elements are removed a priori from the target 
mesh along the penetrator trajectory, which works well for 
normal impacts where the trajectory is known a priori. The 
latter technique removes distorted elements from the 
simulation based upon a user supplied criterion. They are 
also removed along the penetrator trajectory, but with no 
general guidance for selecting certain criteria, i.e., they are 
ad hoc. 
The focus of the present work is to assess a relatively 
new class of numerical methods, so-called mesh free 
methods, which offer analysts an alternate analytical 
technique for simulating this class of ballistic problems 
without a priori trajectory knowledge or the need to resort to 
ad hoc criteria. The assessment is made by comparing 
projectile residual speeds provided by the various techniques, 
when used to simulate a ballistic impact experiment. The 
techniques compared are the mesh free method known as 
Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), a multi-material 
ALE technique, and Lagrangian with material erosion. Given 
that comparing these inherently different methods is hardly 
possible, large efforts have been made to minimize the 
numerous ancillary aspects of the different simulations and 
focus on the unique capabilities of the techniques.  
III. 
METHODS OF SPACE DISCRETIZATION 
The spatial discretization is performed by representing 
the fields and structures of the problem using computational 
points in space, usually connected with each other through 
computational grids. Generally, the following applies: the 
finer the grid, the more accurate the solution. For problems 
of dynamic fluid-structure interaction and impact, there 
typically is no single best numerical method which is 
applicable to all parts of a problem. Techniques to couple 
types of numerical solvers in a single simulation can allow 
the use of the most appropriate solver for each domain of the 
problem [9].  
The most commonly used spatial discretization methods 
are Lagrange, Euler, ALE (a mixture of Lagrange and Euler), 
and mesh-free methods, such as Smooth Particles 
Hydrodynamics (SPH) [10].

A. Lagrange 
The Lagrange method of space discretization uses a mesh 
that moves and distorts with the material it models as a result 
of forces from neighboring elements (meshes are imbedded 
in material). There is no grid required for the external space, 
as the conservation of mass is automatically satisfied and 
material boundaries are clearly defined. This is the most 
efficient solution methodology with an accurate pressure 
history definition.  
The 
Lagrange 
method 
is 
most 
appropriate 
for 
representing solids, such as structures and projectiles. If 
however, there is too much deformation of any element, it 
results in a very slowly advancing solution and is usually 
terminated because the smallest dimension of an element 
results in a time step that is below the threshold level.  
B. Euler 
The Euler (multi-material) solver utilizes a fixed mesh, 
allowing materials to flow (advect) from one element to the 
next (meshes are fixed in space). Therefore, an external 
space needs to be modeled. Due to the fixed grid, the Euler 
method avoids problems of mesh distortion and tangling that 
are prevalent in Lagrange simulations with large flows. The 
Euler solver is very well-suited for problems involving 
extreme material movement, such as fluids and gases. To 
describe solid behavior, additional calculations are required 
to transport the solid stress tensor and the history of the 
material through the grid. Euler is generally more 
computationally intensive than Lagrange and requires a 
higher resolution (smaller elements) to accurately capture 
sharp pressure peaks that often occur with shock waves.  
C. ALE  
The ALE method of space discretization is a hybrid of 
the Lagrange and Euler methods. It allows redefining the 
grid continuously in arbitrary and predefined ways as the 
calculation 
proceeds, 
which 
effectively 
provides 
a 
continuous rezoning facility. Various predefined grid 
motions can be specified, such as free (Lagrange), fixed 
(Euler), equipotential, equal spacing, and others. The ALE 
method can model solids as well as liquids. The advantage of 
ALE is the ability to reduce and sometimes eliminate 
difficulties caused by severe mesh distortions encountered by 
the Lagrange method, thus allowing a calculation to continue 
efficiently. However, compared to Lagrange, an additional 
computational step of rezoning is employed to move the grid 
and remap the solution onto a new grid [7].  
D. SPH 
The mesh-free Lagrangian method of space discretization 
(or SPH method) is a particle-based solver and was initially 
used in astrophysics. The particles are imbedded in material 
and they are not only interacting mass points but also 
interpolation points used to calculate the value of physical 
variables based on the data from neighboring SPH particles, 
scaled by a weighting function. Because there is no grid 
defined, distortion and tangling problems are avoided as 
well. Compared to the Euler method, material boundaries 
and interfaces in the SPH are rather well defined and 
material separation is naturally handled. Therefore, the SPH 
solver is ideally suited for certain types of problems with 
extensive material damage and separation, such as cracking. 
This type of response often occurs with brittle materials and 
hypervelocity impacts. However, mesh-free methods, such as 
SPH, can be less efficient than mesh-based Lagrangian 
methods with comparable resolution. 
Figure 3 gives a short overview of the solver 
technologies mentioned above. The crucial factor is the grid 
that causes different outcomes.  
The behavior (deflection) of the simple elements is well-
known and may be calculated and analyzed using simple 
equations called shape functions. By applying coupling 
conditions between the elements at their nodes, the overall 
stiffness of the structure may be built up and the 
deflection/distortion of any node – and subsequently of the 
whole structure – can be calculated approximately [12].  
Due to the fact that all engineering simulations are based 
on geometry to represent the design, the target and all its 
components are simulated as CAD models [13]. Therefore, 
several runs are necessary: from modeling to calculation to 
the evaluation and subsequent improvement of the model 
(see Figure 4).

The most important steps during an FE analysis are the 
evaluation and interpretation of the outcomes followed by 
suitable modifications of the model. For that reason, ballistic 
trials are necessary to validate the simulation results. They 
can be used as the basis of an iterative optimization process.  
IV. 
BALLISTIC TRIALS 
Ballistics is an essential component for the evaluation of 
our results. Here, terminal ballistics is the most important 
sub-field. It describes the interaction of a projectile with its 
target. Terminal ballistics is relevant for both small and large 
caliber projectiles. The task is to analyze and evaluate the 
impact and its various modes of action. This will provide 
information on the effect of the projectile and the extinction 
risk.  
Given that a projectile strikes a target, compressive 
waves propagate into both the projectile and the target. 
Relief waves propagate inward from the lateral free surfaces 
of the penetrator, cross at the centerline, and generate a high 
tensile stress. If the impact were normal, we would have a 
two-dimensional stress state. If the impact were oblique, 
bending stresses would be generated in the penetrator. When 
the compressive wave was to reach the free surface of the 
target, it would rebound as a tensile wave. The target could 
fracture at this point. The projectile could change direction in 
case of perforation (usually towards the normal of the target 
surface). A typical impact response is illustrated in Figure 5.  
Because of the differences in target behavior due to the 
proximity of the distal surface, we must categorize targets 
into four broad groups. In a semi-infinite target, there is no 
influence of distal boundary on penetration. A thick target is 
one in which the boundary influences penetration after the 
projectile has already travelled some distance into the target. 
An intermediate thickness target is a target where the 
boundaries exert influence throughout the impact. Finally, a 
thin target is one in which stress or deformation gradients are 
negligible throughout the thickness. 
There are several methods which may cause a target to 
fail when subjected to an impact. The major variables are the 
target and penetrator material properties, the impact velocity, 
the projectile shape (especially the ogive), the geometry of 
the target supporting structure, and the dimensions of the 
projectile and target. 
 
Figure 5.  Wave propagation after impact. 
The results of the ballistic tests were provided prior to the 
simulation work to aid calibration. A series of metal plate 
impact experiments, using several projectile types, have been 
performed. For the present comparative study, the only target 
considered is 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) thick 6061-T6 aluminum 
plate. The plate has a free span area of 8 by 8 inches (203 by 
203 mm) and was fixed in place. 
The plate was nominally center impacted by a blunt 
projectile, also made from 6061-T6 aluminum, with an 
impact speed of 3181 feet/second (970 meters/second). The 
orientation of the projectile impact was intended to be 
normal to the target. The projectile is basically a right 
circular cylinder of length 0.974 inches (24.7 mm) and 
diameter 0.66 inch (16.7 mm), with a short length of reduced 
diameter (shoulder) at the rear of the projectile. 
The projectile’s observed exit speed was 1830 
feet/second. The deformed target and projectile are shown in 
Figures 6 and 7, respectively. As can be seen the target is 
essentially “drilled out” by the projectile, i.e., a clean hole 
remains in the target plate. Also, the lack of “petals” on the 
exit surface of the target indicates the hole was formed by 
concentrated shear around the perimeter of the hole. 
The deformed projectiles, shown in Figure 7, indicate the 
increasing amount of projectile deformation as it perforates 
increasingly thicker targets: 0.125 to 0.5 inch. The deformed 
projectile on the right is the case of present interest. It is 
worth noting that the simulation of deformable projectiles 
perforating deformable targets is a challenging class of 
ballistic simulations. The vast majority of perforation 
simulations involve nearly rigid projectiles impacting 
deformable 
targets. 
Although 
deformable 
projectile 
calculations form a special, and limited, class in ballistics, 
establishing confidence in the simulation of this challenging 
class of problems will lend further confidence to the 
comparatively easier simulation of near rigid projectile 
perforating deformable targets [14].

V. 
NUMERICAL SIMULATION 
The ballistic tests are followed by computational 
modeling of the experimental set-up.  
Three mesh refinement models were constructed using 
the two-dimension axisymmetric solver in ANSYS. While 
the three-dimensional solver could also be used, using the 
two-dimension axisymmetric solver allows more efficient 
solutions, especially with a large number of elements. The 
particulars of the three meshes are summarized in Tab. I. 
Figure 8 shows two of the three axisymmetric mesh 
configurations. The mesh discretizations are similar in that 
each mesh uses one number as the basis for determining the 
number and size of all the elements in the mesh. The target 
plate elements immediately below the projectile have the 
same mesh refinement as the projectile. The configuration is 
based on [14]. 
A suite of impact simulations was performed using the 
above-described 6061-T6 aluminum projectile and 6061-T6 
aluminum target. The projectile was given an initial velocity 
of 3181 feet/second (970 meters/second) and the projectile’s 
speed was recorded at a point near the rear of the projectile. 
The resulting residual speed was thought to best correspond 
to the experimental measurement technique for residual 
speed.  
The overall projectile and target plate dimensions were 
previously given in the description of the ballistic 
experiment. The axisymmetric model is fully constrained 
around the outer diameter of the target plate, i.e., fully fixed 
(clamped). 
Different solver methodologies have been applied. The 
comparison is presented in the following section.

A. Solver Evaluation 
Using the Johnson-Cook failure criterion eliminates the 
need to select an erosion criterion and a value for the 
criterion at which to erode elements. These are two 
significant difficulties most often overlooked when using an 
erosion-based simulation technique. Many users select an ad 
hoc erosion criterion and assign ad hoc values for erosion. In 
so doing, they seem to ignore the fact that the results are then 
also ad hoc, which is not desirable when making predictive 
calculations.  
As mentioned above, the Johnson-Cook failure model is 
not regularized via element characteristic lengths. Thus, we 
expect the results to be mesh-dependent. It is the purpose of 
this section to assess this mesh dependency using four 
successively refined meshes. Subsequently, theses Lagrange 
erosion results will be compared with the corresponding 
ALE and SPH results. 
1) Lagrange method: Figure 9 shows the initial and 
deformed (t = 0.053 ms) mesh configurations for the 
medium discretized mesh. Also shown is an illustration of 
the eroded element distribution at the end of the simulation. 
The eroded elements are indicated relative to their initial 
position using a different color to differentiate them from 
the non-eroded elements of the same part. Tab. II 
summarizes the residual speed of the projectile for the three 
mesh configurations considered. With the exception of the 
medium mesh speed, which indicates a somewhat larger 
projectile speed reduction, the projectile speeds are 
decreasing 
nearly 
uniformly 
with 
increasing 
mesh 
refinement. Figure 10 shows a plot of the residual speed 
versus the mesh refinement parameter. This plot indicates 
that the results do not follow the developing trend. Based on 
this plot, no claim can be made that the results are in the 
asymptotic 
regime, 
much 
less 
converged. 
This 
is 
disappointing since the mesh densities for these two cases 
are likely to be much greater than it would have been 
attempted in typical three dimensional simulations.

Figure 10.  Plot of residual speed versus mesh refinement parameter. 
2) ALE method: As mentioned above, failure criteria 
such as the Johnson-Cook failure criterion, cannot be used 
with Eulerian formulations as cell (element) deletion is not 
allowed. If a user attempts to use a failure model, the 
deletion of failed cells will eventually cause the calculation 
to terminate inaccurately. Thus, all the ALE simulations in 
this section omit the Johnson-Cook failure model. 
In the absence of a failure criterion, it will be 
demonstrated that the residual speed of the projectile is quite 
low. It is the purpose of this section to assess the mesh 
dependency of the ALE solution using successively refined 
meshes. Subsequently, these results will be compared with 
the corresponding Lagrange and SPH results. 
Note: although the same mesh densities are used in both 
the Lagrange and ALE simulations in this demonstration, 
ALE mesh densities generally need to be greater than 
corresponding Lagrange with erosion mesh densities. The 
advection of materials from cell-to-cell, and especially the 
assumption of uniform strain-rate increments for all 
materials occupying a cell, introduces numerical errors to the 
ALE solution that can only be minimized by increasing the 
mesh densities. For the present demonstration, it is posited 
that the Lagrange mesh densities are greater than they would 
typically be for such a perforation simulation, making the 
ALE mesh densities probably appear typical in terms of 
expectations. 
Tab. II compares the previous Lagrange with erosion 
results with the corresponding ALE projectile residual 
speeds. The vast majority of perforation simulations involve 
nearly rigid projectiles impacting deformable targets. Figure 
11 shows the ALE simulation at t = 0.1 ms with a medium 
number of elements. It is interesting to note that the ALE 
deformed projectile is quite similar in shape to the deformed 
projectile after the test.

3) SPH method: Failure criteria like the Johnson-Cook 
failure criterion, are not typically used with the Smooth 
Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) formulations, as particle 
methods are designed to avoid mesh distortions, which is 
the primary motivation for using failure/erosion criteria. It is 
the purpose of this section to assess the mesh dependency of 
the SPH solution using three successively refined particle 
meshes. These results will be compared with the 
corresponding Lagrange with erosion and ALE results. 
Much like the mesh refinements used in the Lagrange 
and ALE calculations, refinements of the SPH particle 
spacing requires changing the spacing in both the impacted 
region of the target plate and the projectile, which is also 
modeled using SPH particles. Figure 12 shows the coarsest 
SPH model with the projectile and center of the target plate. 
It was modeled using SPH particles, while the outer portion 
of the plate was modeled with Lagrange solid elements. Tab. 
III summarizes the three SPH meshes.

Figure 13.  Initial and final (t = 0.1 ms) configurations for finest SPH mesh 
(0.43 mm spacing). 
Figure 13 shows the initial and final (t = 0.1 ms) 
deformed projectile and target plate configuration for the 
finest SPH mesh. In addition to the target plate ‘plug’ being 
removed from the plate by the projectile (darker brown 
particles on the right side of target plate), there is 
considerable front surface ejecta of both the projectile (light 
brown particles) and the target plate (darker brown particles). 
For this mesh refinement, the deformed projectile remains 
relatively intact, with the exception of the front surface ejecta 
and portions of the projectile that remain attached to the 
target plate.  
B. Simulation Results 
In the previous sections, the results from a laboratory 
experiment were used as a basis to assess the accuracy of the 
numerical simulations with respect to mesh refinement.  
Examining the Lagrange results first without considering 
the experimental observation, it would seem like the 
Lagrange method provides the “best” results. All three sets 
of the Lagrange-with-erosion results have an observed order 
of convergence which is less than two and thus considered a 
favorable indication, since few numerical methods have 
orders of accuracy greater than two. 
A general trend seems to be that, as the mesh is refined, 
the resulting deformed projectile more closely resembles the 
observed deformed projectile. The exception to this trend is 
the “point” that protrudes from the front of the projectile. 
Due to target elements, this “point” appears to be eroded 
erroneously along the axis of symmetry.  
Also, it can be deduced that, for ALE simulations, 
meshes need to be more dense than it is required for the 
corresponding Lagrange mesh density. The current status is 
as follows: the ALE meshes were refined enough, and the 
Lagrange meshes were more refined than necessary. It is 
more likely that the advection of material, e.g., from target 
plate into the surrounding vacuum, over-predicts the motion 
of the target plate, thus effectively reducing its stiffness and 
allowing for a “soft catch” of the projectile and an associated 
reduced projectile residual speed. Here, it needs to be 
recalled that the Johnson-Cook failure model cannot be 
included in the Eulerian simulations as the notion of removal 
of a cell in the Eulerian context is not permitted. However, 
these results do indicate that they converge in or at least near 
the asymptotic range. 
Just like the ALE results, the SPH residual speeds 
increase with increasing mesh density, thus being opposite to 
the general trend for the Lagrange results. An increasing 
speed with mesh refinement leads to predictions for a 
converged result that is greater than the calculated values. 
Finally, the SPH deformed projectile, previously shown in 
Figure 13, bears little or no resemblance to the deformed 
projectile recovered after the perforation test (see Figure 7). 
Thus, the SPH residual speed results should perhaps be 
considered reasonable, at least compared to the ALE results. 
However, the lack of uniformity of the deformed projectile 
shape between the SPH simulations and the actual 
experiment might be an indication that the “right” answer 
might be obtained for the “wrong” reason. Future perforation 
experiments should include additional diagnostics, e.g., 
strain measurements on the target plates, so that assessments 
of agreement can be more extensive than solely considering 
residual speed. 
The SPH deformed projectile looked the least like the 
observed deformed projectile of any of the three simulation 
techniques reported. Rather than forming a rounded impact 
end on the projectile, the SPH deformed projectile seems to 
form more of a “jet” with a narrow diameter at the fore and a 
tapered diameter toward the rear. Also, only the refined mesh 
appears to maintain the integrity of the projectile, i.e., the 
other two mesh configurations indicate the projectile 
separating into two parts. Finally, it appears as if some of the 
projectile material remains on the inner diameter of the hole 
formed in the target plate. However, it is uncertain if this was 
observed in the test. 
VI. 
HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING 
The objective is to develop and improve the modern 
armor used in the security sector. To develop better, smarter 
constructions requires an analysis of a wider range of 
parameters. However, there is a simple rule of thumb: the 
more design iterations that can be simulated, the more 
optimized is the final product. As a result, a high-
performance computing (HPC) solution has to dramatically 
reduce overall engineering simulation time. HPC adds 
tremendous value to engineering simulation by enabling the 
creation of large, high-fidelity models that yield accurate and 
detailed insights into the performance of a proposed design. 
HPC also adds value by enabling greater simulation 
throughput. Using HPC resources, many design variations 
can be analyzed. 
This research will evaluate the performance of the 
following server generations: HP ProLiant SL390s G7, HP 
ProLiant DL580 G7, and HP ProLiant DL380p G8. 
Taking the influence of the software into account, 
different versions of ANSYS will be applied here. Regarding 
the Lagrange solver in a complex 3D multi-material 
simulation model (modern composite armor structure instead 
of 6061-T6 aluminum target), the following benchmark is 
obtained for the different simulations (see Tab. IV below).

The results indicate the importance of high-performance 
computing in combination with competitive simulation 
software to solve current problems of the computer-aided 
engineering sector.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
The reader is reminded that the ballistic simulation 
attempted in this work is among the most difficult as both the 
projectile and target experience significant deformation. The 
deformation of the projectile as it interacts with the target 
affects the deformation of the target, and vice versa. 
The introduction of a failure criterion, such as the 
Johnson-Cook failure criterion, is clearly necessary for 
Lagrange models, and appears to also be necessary for SPH 
models. A better overall approach than on-off failure models, 
like the Johnson-Cook failure model, would be the use of 
continuum damage models. These models allow for the 
gradual reduction in strength of highly deformed materials 
and can be used in all three solution techniques. 
The importance of mesh refinement has been emphasized 
in this work. This relatively simple to perform assessment of 
how the key results change with mesh density is all too often 
overlooked in computational solid mechanics. Further, 
establishing that the results are in the asymptotic regime 
provides some confidence that the mesh density is adequate. 
When predictions are required, analysts want as many 
checks and assurances as possible that their results are 
credible. Mesh refinement studies provide the analyst some 
confidence the results are at a minimum not being affected 
by ad hoc choices of discretization. 
This work demonstrates how a small number of well-
defined experiments can be used to develop, calibrate, and 
validate solver technologies used for simulating the impact 
of projectiles on armor systems.  
New concepts and models can be developed and easily 
tested with the help of modern hydrocodes. The initial design 
approach of the units and systems has to be as safe and 
optimal as possible. Therefore, most design concepts are 
analyzed on the computer.  
The gained experience is of prime importance for the 
development of modern armor. By applying the numerical 
model, a large number of potential armor schemes can be 
evaluated and the understanding of the interaction between 
different materials under ballistic impact can be improved.  
The most important steps during an FE analysis are the 
evaluation and interpretation of the outcomes followed by 
suitable modifications of the model. For that reason, ballistic 
trials are necessary to validate the simulation results.

They are designed to obtain information about 
 
the velocity and trajectory of the projectile prior 
to the impact, 
 
changes in configuration of the projectile and 
target due to the impact, 
 
masses, velocities, and trajectories of fragments 
generated by the impact process. 
The combined use of computations, experiments and 
high-strain-rate material characterization has, in many cases, 
supplemented the data achievable by experiments alone at 
considerable savings in both cost and engineering manhours.
