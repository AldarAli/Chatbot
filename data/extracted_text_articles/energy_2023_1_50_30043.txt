Abstract— The world is moving towards a conservative 
approach to fulfilling its energy needs due to inevitable 
uncertainty and disruptions in the supply chain. In addition, 
climate change, the availability of materials, and making them 
sustainable through recycling are other topics of high interest. 
Energy is a common item among all the industries, and 
demand for it keeps increasing due to developmental activities. 
In this work, we aim to improve the efficiency of utilising the 
available energy in the material processing industries. Mining 
the ore, extracting the material of interest, melting the 
material, and manufacturing the required components are 
typical processes in these industries. The manufacturing of the 
components also includes a heat treatment process. For 
example, the heat treatment process demands 20% of the total 
energy in a non-ferrous foundry. Pre-heating and heat 
treatment operations consume a significant amount of energy 
in the ferrous-based industry. We intend to investigate the 
processes in these industries and create a machine-learning 
model of the processes involved. Later, we use the machine 
learning models to build an optimization framework that 
provides the optimal process operating parameters to achieve 
the best output while using the least amount of energy. 
Keywords- machine-learning; Optimisation; heat-treatment; 
energy-efficiency.

INTRODUCTION
Heat treatment processes are an important stage in 
materials processing in which component properties are 
modified to suit a particular application. In this process, 
mechanical and physical properties, such as ductility, 
hardness, toughness, wear resistance, and strength are 
changed without changing the designed shape and size of the 
component [1]. In general, heat treatment processes are 
carried out to improve strength in the case of loaded 
members and wear resistance in the case of moving parts, 
however, it can also be used to improve the machinability, 
formability of materials. The changes in the properties of the 
material are made possible thanks to the changes which 
occur at molecular structure/microstructure level. The 
structure of the material is a function of two factors; (1) 
Grain size (2) Grain structure. These two components of 
microstructure of a material define its mechanical and 
physical properties. Also, heat treatment process is often 
coupled with pre and post heating process which enable us to 
utilize energy effectively besides improving the product 
performance. 
In total, it can be observed that there are several 
parameters involved in heat treatment process such as, 
chemical composition of alloy, dimensions and shape of the 
component to be heat treated, micro structural, physical and 
mechanical properties, energy required for the heat treatment 
process, etc. Depending on specific objective, some of the 
parameters will be input before/during heat treatment and 
others will be output parameters. Irrespective of our 
objectives if we end up with more than 4 parameters, which 
vary then a complex problem needs to be solved to realize 
the effect of each parameter on the set out put parameters. To 
address this issue regression models are used. A brief 
literature review of the regression models used to map input 
to output parameters in heat treatment process is presented in 
the following section.  
The rest of the paper is organized as, details of regression 
model and its results are presented in Section III, details of

optimization framework and its results are presented in 
Section IV and the conclusions are presented in Section V.

LITERATURE
In the case of metals, Johnson [2], Avrami [3] proposed 
analytical models. Using their work, numerical simulations 
were developed to study heat treatment process. The 
simulation 
results 
reduced 
the 
effort 
of 
extensive 
experimentations (hence reduction in energy consumption) 
however they lack accuracy [4]. For example, Maisuradze 
[5] proved that the simulations predict strength parameter in-
accurately in a heat treatment process.  To address this issue 
computer aided simulations are developed which give a 
better accuracy than the simulations [6] – [9].  
In general, an important task in a heat treatment model 
development is to predict the micro-structural properties 
accurately as they predominantly influence output quality 
parameters. In this way it is easy to suggest the initial/input 
parameters of a heat treatment. In this regard, data driven 
solutions are proven to accelerate the problem solving [10] 
[11]. Related works in this field include, Homer et al. [12] 
and Zhu et al. [13] investigated grain boundaries in 
polycrystalline material using machine learning tools, 
Raccuglia et al. [14] created a classification model to predict 
successful and failed experiments using vast amount of 
experimental data on materials. Agrawal et al. [15] [16] 
created a machine learning model which predicts fatigue 
strength of steel using composition and processing 
parameters. In [17] regression models are used to predict 
four mechanical properties after heat treatment process. The 
authors have used five different regression models of which 
random forests performed well in predicting the mechanical 
properties and they developed mathematical expressions out 
of it. 
Heat treatment and other processes of glass also results in 
change in microstructure and hence mechanical properties. 
Structural and physical properties of strontium borate glass 
are evaluated against chemical composition using regression 
analysis by Masai H et al. [18]. Samuel B. O. et al. [19] have 
developed an optimization technique using which they 
modelled glass material for composites of particular flexural 
strength using Taguchi and general regression. In case of 
glass, a lot of attention is given to the manufacturing 
processes such as cutting, grinding, etc. In [20] [21], the 
authors have created a Neural Network (NN) model to 
predict material removal rate and surface roughness 
parameters in a laser machining process. Shimaa et al. [22] 
created a machine learning model of abrasive jet machining 
of glass in which material removal rate is correlated with 
process variables of machining process. Bezzera et al. [23] 
developed a machine learning model using NN to predict 
shear stress-strain behavior of CFRP material. 
There is a lot of research literature in which 
investigations are carried out on implementing optimization 
methods with regression models as basis for prediction. 
Although regression models developed on machine learning 
techniques perform as per the expectations, the developed 
models suffer from a dis-advantage. The solution space of 
the machine learning models may refer to a local maxima or 
minima, over/under fitting and slow convergence. These dis-
advantages can be identified and overcome by implementing 
an optimization technique to rigorously search the solution 
space for a specific solution that fits our application [24] [25] 
[26]. In recent research works, deep learning models such as 
Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) 
are used for forecasting energy demand forecasting. Works 
of [27] [28] [29] have shown that using more than one type 
of deep neural networks for forecasting energy demand gives 
accurate result. Khan A. et al. [30] used machine learning 
algorithm along with cuckoo search method for forecasting 
energy requirement. Almalaq, A. et al. [31] used Long short-
term memory networks with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to 
create prediction and optimisation models of energy 
consumption of buildings. Wen L. et al. [32] used LSTM 
with particle swarm algorithm (PSO) to correlate load 
dispatch in a community micro grid with solar power 
assistance. Similar work is done by Ceylan H. et al. [33] by 
using GA to estimate energy demand of Turkey using 
economic indicators.  
Some other related works include [34] [35] in which 
researchers have used PSO to optimally configure the 
weights of NN to create an accurate model of energy 
consumption.  
Although the reported literature includes the use of GA 
and PSO, there are several such heuristic algorithms namely, 
Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Travelling Salesman, 
etc. A review of the algorithms is presented in [36]. Of all 
these algorithms, GA and PSO are predominantly used 
because of their exceptional performance when applied to 
engineering problems. These two methods are broadly 
similar however they differ in their basic nature of search 
technique. GA is based on evolution whereas PSO is based 
on swarm intelligence. A detailed comparison study of these 
two techniques is presented in [37]. Also, R. Kshirsagar et al. 
[38] proved that PSO can be derived as special case of GA 
for a class of engineering problems. GA is a suitable 
algorithms for non-linear problems.  
In this work we used simulation model results of a case 
study in glass industry to create regression model and an 
optimization frame work is created using the regression 
model. The frame work is a multi-objective and multi-
constraint based prediction model which is capable of 
generating input parameter values for a particular output 
required.

REGRESSION MODEL OF HEAT TREATMENT 
The case study we considered to analyse is a heat 
treatment process of glass bottles made of soda-lime 
material. Cooling part of the heat treatment process is 
selected for simulation. In the cooling part of the heat 
treatment we aim to study the changes in material quality and 
energy consumption in relation to the parameters annealing 
temperature (0C), Cooling rate (0C/min) and Exit temperature 
(0C). All the other possible parameters are kept constant for 
this study. These three parameters are the independent 
parameters of the process.

For the purpose of creating data related to heat treatment 
of glass, we have setup maximum and minimum values of 
independent variables of heat treatment process of glass 
bottles. The details of the independent parameter values are 
presented in Table I.

Using the values of each independent/input parameters, 
we have created a full factorial design of experiment which 
results in 27 experiments. These experiments are carried out 
in a computer simulation using ANSYS. The simulation is a 
cooling simulation where the work piece is at annealing 
temperature and cools down to exit temperature at the given 
cooling rate.  In each simulation, the value of maximum 
stress and energy required are evaluated. Results of 
simulation along with input parameters of each simulation 
are presented in Table II.

Using these results (listed in Table II), a data set is 
created with three input parameters namely Initial 
temperature, Cooling rate and Exit temperature, two output 
parameters namely maximum stress value and energy. NN is 
used to create a regression model. Details of the NN is 
presented in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Flow chart of optimisation algorithm. 
It can be noted that a specific architecture (as shown in 
Figure 1) is used in this work to create NN. As explained in 
[25], there is no logical way to decide the number of neurons 
and number of hidden layers in NN architecture for a 
particular type of problem or data set. In this report the 
architecture shown in Figure 1 is realised after several 
attempts made, by changing the number of hidden layer, 
number of neurons in the hidden layers and examining the 
results after several training iterations. The NN code is set to 
iterate till the loss function evaluated on training set is same 
as testing set and percentage error evaluated between 
predicted values and the actual values is less than 1%. This 
exercise confirms that the created model is accurate and does 
not over fit the data.  
Data is normalised before feeding it to NN. It is 
normalised using the formula given by (1).

Here, Xnorm – normalised value, Xmin – minimum value of 
a particular variable , Xmax – maximum value of a particular

The NN is trained by dividing the data into training and 
testing set. The division is carried out randomly. 80% of the 
data is used to create the NN model. Rest of the 20% of the 
data is used to validate the model created by training data. 
Mean squared error is measured on both testing and training 
data set. Training of the NN is carried out till mean squared 
error measured on both testing and training are equal so that 
the prediction model does not over fit the data. Percentage 
error between the predicted values and the actual values is 
within 1%. Percentage error evaluated over five data points 
is presented in Table III.

OPTIMISATION MODEL USING HEAT TREATMENT 
MODEL
Regression model created (in Section III) to predict Von-
Mises stresses and energy is used in GA to create 
optimization frame work. It enables us to find out the values 
of input parameter values for the required output. In the 
frame work, objective function is created using regression 
models created using NN. The objective function is given by 
(2). 
Objective function = Minimize {abs(Stress evaluated by 
regression 
model-Required 
stress 
value)+abs(Energy 
evaluated by regression model-Required energy value}) 
(2) 
Note that the parameters used in (2) are in normalized 
form, hence the issue of incomparable engineering units in a 
single equation does not arise. Also the parameters used in 
(2) namely “Required stress” value and “Required energy” 
value are set by the user. The range of parameters is 0 to 1. 
The regression model and the optimization process works 
well for interpolation. 
The objective function is created as a minimization 
problem in which GA tries to find out a stress and energy 
value which is equal to required stress and energy values. 
The iterative steps in GA are as follows  
• 
Step 1: Create an initial population. Here the initial 
population is nx3 matrix where n is the population length 
and 3 is the number of input variables in GTS data. Each 
value in the matrix is chosen randomly that lies between 0 
and 1. This is because, regression model created is based on 
normalized data. 
• 
Step 2: Evaluate stress, energy values for each 
population set (each row of nx3 matrix) using regression 
model and then evaluate objective function given by (2). 
• 
Step 3: As the objective is to minimize (2), the rows 
of population set is sorted in ascending order with respect to 
objective function. 
• 
Step 4: Top half of the population is selected as fit 
population. Cross over is carried out on the fit population by 
selecting two random chromosomes. Another half of the 
population is replaced with newly formed chromosomes.  
• 
Step 5: Mutation is carried out by replacing 
randomly selected gene in a randomly selected chromosome.  
• 
Step 6: repeat from step 1 to 5 with new set of 
population formed in Step 5 until the percentage error 
between the actual vs predicted values is within the set value. 
Flow chart of the Algorithm explained in the above 6 
steps is presented in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Flow chart of optimisation algorithm. 
To start the algorithm, we have set required stress value 
and energy value as presented on Table IV.

Using trial and error, we identified that a population size 
of 50 results on definite convergence. So the population size 
is set to 50 and the algorithm is iterated till the required 
accuracy is achieved. At the end of the iterations, top 
chromosome set after sorting is identified to be the best 
solution. This exercise is carried out for all the 6 set of stress 
and energy values and corresponding input values obtained 
using GA are presented in Table IV with label “GA result”. 
To validate the obtained values using GA, “GA result” 
set are input to neural network model and stress and energy 
values are calculated. The values are presented in Table IV 
with label “NN result”.

CONCLUSIONS
Heat treatment process of glass is studied in this work. A 
specific pattern of heat treatment and cooling is required to 
achieve desired properties in the glass material. For the 
purpose of study, independent/input parameters list is created 
with their maximum and minimum values. A full factorial 
design of experiments set is listed for computer simulations. 
Output parameters namely stress, energy are evaluated using 
the simulations. A multi-objective and multi-criteria 
optimization framework is created using regression model 
and genetic algorithm. Results obtained using both 
regression model and optimization model are well within 1% 
error. Although only one case study is used to carry out the 
analysis, the optimization framework we proposed can be 
used for any industry problem. 
The framework proposed in this manuscript allows to set 
the output parameters and evaluate input parameters. GA is 
used for the evaluation. The framework also allows to 
constrain the range/value of few input parameters and 
evaluate others. In this way it is possible to obtain a range of 
input parameters which fit the operating conditions. So for a 
particular value of energy consumption and stress value and 
exit temperature, it is possible to obtain various values of 
cooling rate and initial temperature. An example is presented 
in Table VI. In this way, an optimal input parameter-set can 
be evaluated for a particular operating conditions. Several 
such input parameter-set can be evaluated using the proposed 
framework.
