Abstract —In developed countries, the prevalence of infertility 
ranges from 3.5% to 16.7%. There are several factors that 
affect the success rate of in vitro treatments and so every 
couple has a singular probability of success which can be 
predicted. As these treatments are complex and expensive with 
a variable probability of success, the most common question 
asked by in vitro fertilization patients is ‘‘What are my chances 
of conceiving?”. Classical statistics and artificial intelligence 
models have been published in the literature. So far, artificial 
intelligent prediction models are not aimed at live birth but 
rather at pregnancy and use undergoing treatment features. 
The main aim of this study is to develop a classification tree 
model that estimates the chance of a live birth before In Vitro 
Fertilization (IVF) treatments. This decision tree might result 
in a new clinical support system that helps physicians to deal 
with the couple's expectations.

 INTRODUCTION 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a promising tool for a wide 
range of applications in Medicine. AI is a “branch of 
computer science that attempts to both understand and build 
intelligent entities, often instantiated as software programs” 
[1]. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have been 
developed to help enhance patient care and improve clinical 
outcome prediction. The first generation of AI systems relied 
on clinical knowledge and the computation of vigorous 
decision rules. Nowadays, AI in healthcare has reached 
machine learning techniques that can rely on complex 
interactions [2]. When the CDSS are trained with classified 
data and recognize patterns in those data, they constitute a 
type of IA named supervised learning. CDSS should be 
integrative and understandable, which are attributes of 
decision trees. Although CDSS are very helpful, these 
systems produce outputs that respond to the question 
“what?”. However, the responsibility to know “why” belongs 
to the physicians [3]. 
One of the clinical areas where CDSS could be of great 
support to physicians is in predicting the output of in vitro 
treatments. According to the study performed by Boivin et 
al. [4], the prevalence of infertility ranged from 3.5% to 
16.7% in developed countries. Based on these authors’ 
estimates, 72.4 million women are currently infertile, and, of 
these, 40.5 million are currently seeking infertility medical 
care [4]. For Portugal, most recent data estimated that 9.8% 
of couples are infertile [5]. 
Infertility is defined as a clinical condition “characterized 
by the failure to establish a clinical pregnancy after 12 
months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse or due to 
an impairment of a person's capacity to reproduce either as 
an individual or with his/her partner” [6]. 
Nowadays, the two most recurrent Medically Assisted 
Reproduction (MAR) techniques are In Vitro Fertilization 
(IVF) and its subtype Intracytoplasmatic Sperm Injection 
(ICSI). According to the European Society of Human 
Reproduction and Embryology, the number of MAR cycles 
between 1997 and 2014 increased by 13%, reaching 776556 
cycles in Europe in 2015 [7]. Although the probability of 
having a live birth is low with IVF, there are more and more 
people using this type of treatment. In fact, this probability 
may increase by up to 30% to 40% with MAR techniques 
[8]. In Portugal, the last report of MAR shows that the 
treatment success rate varies between 25-30% [9]. MAR 
treatments entail issues, such as stress, anxiety, or depression 
due to time and money involved [10]–[14]. Furthermore, 
these treatments may result in medical complications, such 
as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or premature births 
[15]. 
Pondering complications and benefits, the couple may 
decide if it is their will to proceed or not with treatment. In 
that way, infertile couples usually ask clinicians about their 
chances of conceiving. 
There are several factors involved in predicting the 
output of in vitro treatments. Female’s age and infertility 
diagnosis are usually the main factors physicians take into 
account [16]. However, hormone doses, physiological 
factors, and sperm quality are couple’ characteristics that 
interfere with the estimate of the success probability [17].  
As the chances of in vitro treatment success depend on 
various factors and those factors are often correlated, there 
are many models in the literature that try to predict infertility 
treatment 
output 
for 
couples 
undergoing 
IVF-ICSI 
[8][16][26][18]–[25].  
Traditional statistic models, such as binary logistic 
regression, are very common in in vitro treatment’s outcome 
prediction. The first predictive model ever built in this

context is from Templeton et al. in 1996 using a logistic 
regression model to predict the probability of live birth for an 
individual woman using the woman’s age, number of 
previous live birth or pregnancies not resulting in a live birth 
and whether these were a result of previous IVF treatments, 
female causes of infertility, duration of infertility and the 
number of previous unsuccessful IVF treatments [16]. Since 
then, many authors used logistic regression to predict the 
chances of live birth for couples undergoing IVF-ICSI[18]–
[20][22][27]. The majority of the developments resided in 
adding new variables, such as serum Anti-Müllerian 
Hormone  (AMH) value [19], Body Mass Index (BMI), or 
ethnicity [18]. Although logistic regression is the most 
recurrent approach to binary output problems and usually has 
high discriminatory ability, a major limitation is a need for 
the dataset features to be independent of each other [28]. 
Data mining techniques are another possible approach to 
this predicting problem. In 1998, Jurisica et al. proposed a 
model based on k-nearest neighbors classifiers [23]. They 
used a case-based reasoning system that exploits past 
experiences to suggest possible modifications to an IVF 
treatment plan in order to improve overall success rates. 
They built an interactive system for physicians that uses both 
pre-treatment features and also ongoing treatment features. 
This model’s accuracy was 60.6%. In 2011, Guh et al. [24] 
developed a hybrid intelligence method that integrates 
genetic algorithm and decision learning techniques for 
knowledge mining. Their study counted on 70 different 
attributes (before and after treatment features) and had an 
accuracy of 72,3%. A complete study from Güvenir et al. 
[25] in 2015 compared the RIMARC (Ranking Instances by 
Maximizing the Area under ROC curve) algorithm with 
naive Bayes classifier and random forest and concluded that 
RIMARC has a potential to be used successfully to estimate 
the probability of success in medical treatment. RIMARC 
algorithm is based on pre-treatment features, and their output 
feature was clinical pregnancy. RIMARC’s accuracy was 
84.4%. Hafiz et al. [8] published in 2017 a comparative 
study between five classifiers based on before and after 
treatment features: support vector machines, adaptive 
boosting (Adaboost), recursive partitioning (RPART), 
random forests (RF) and one nearest neighbour (1NN) and 
concluded that RPART and RF had the highest values of 
Area 
Under ROC Curve (AUC) (0,82 and 0,84, 
respectively). In 2016 Milewska et al. [26] used 
classification trees to obtain a group of patients characterized 
most likely to get pregnant while using in vitro fertilization. 
However, they used undergoing treatment features, such as 
quality of oocytes obtained by the stimulation. For the 
training group, the area under ROC (Receiver Operating 
Characteristic) curve (AUC) was 0.75–0.76, while for the 
validation group, it was from 0.66 to 0.68. Trimarchi et al. 
[29] findings obtained from more traditional statistical 
approaches seem to validate the results obtained by the data 
mining techniques both in terms of accuracy and number of 
variables considered. More recently, Tran et al. [30] created 
a deep learning model named IVY, which was an objective 
and fully automated system that predicts the probability of 
fetal heart pregnancy directly from raw time-lapse videos 
without the need for any manual morphokinetic annotation 
or blastocyst morphology assessment. They achieved an 
AUC of 0.93 [95% CI 0.92–0.94] in 5-fold stratified cross-
validation. 
In data mining of clinical data, it is wanted to provide 
models understandable to humans once it is imperative that 
physicians understand the conclusions, and that can explain 
it to their patients [3]. In other words, decision trees are 
graphical, allowing easy visualization and computationally 
translate the typical human reasoning in which the process is 
of eliminating hypotheses corresponding to the tests 
performed on each node. Therefore, the decision tree 
learning technique can be more useful in this context once it 
can create a model in terms of intuitively transparent if-then 
rules [31].  
This study aims to develop, for a Portuguese hospital, a 
validated decision tree model that estimates the chances of 
live birth on couples before they start their IVF non-donor 
cycle on pre-treatment. The work presented in this short 
paper is only part of the whole study done. The ultimate goal 
is to use the most accurate model for the development of a 
clinical support interface. Other models based on logistic 
regressions and bayesian classifiers were developed. In 
addition, further data are pending collection for validation. 
This paper is structured in introduction, methods, results, 
discussion, and conclusion. After presenting the problem in 
the introduction section, the chosen method to build the 
decision tree will be described, in the next section. The 
results section contains the tree model, which is analysed in 
discussion section. At the end of this paper, there is a 
conclusion section that summarizes the key points of this 
paper.   
II. 
METHODS 
This was a retrospective study of the data from 39 cycles. 
The cycles were performed between 2012 and 2016 in the 
Centro de Infertilidade e Reprodução Medicamente Assistida 
(CIRMA) at Hospital Garcia de Orta, E.P.E., Almada, 
Portugal. 
After approval from the Hospital’s Ethics Committee for 
Health, it was considered as a primary outcome the existence 
of live birth (at least one baby was born alive and survived 
for more than 1 month). Pregnancy was not considered as an 
output because the aim of this study was to predict the 
success of the treatment which is not complete measurable 
with pregnancy due to miscarriages. 
In terms of the baseline characteristics used to develop 
the Portuguese model and taking into account the literature 
in this area [16][32][33], we used the following features: 
woman’s and man’s age (years), duration of infertility 
(months), cause of infertility (categorised as diagnosis of 
tubal, endometriosis, disovulation, male factor, both female 
and male factor, multiple female factors, unexplained or 
other), woman’s and man’s BMI (Kg/m2), serum anti-
Müllerian hormone (AMH) (ng/mL), Antral Follicle Count 
(AFC) (number of follicles), woman’s and man’s ethnicity 
(Asian, Caucasian, Gipsy, Indian, Black or Mixed), woman’s 
and man’s smoking status (never, previous, present) and

woman’s and man’s previous live births (yes or no). This 
was the complete set of features available on the database.  
Data was pre-processed aiming to find missing values 
and for that reason, two cases were not considered for that 
model. In other words, the model was constructed with data 
from 737 couples. 
To build the decision tree, we used the Salford Predictive 
Modeler’s CART® (Classification and Regression Trees) 
modeling software from Minitab Statistical Software. The 
CART methodology was developed in the ’80s by Leo 
Breiman, Jerome Friedman, R.A. Olshen and Charles Stone 
and was first presented in their paper from 1984 [34]. The 
CART modeling engine, Salford Predictive Modeler’s 
implementation of CART, is the only decision tree software 
embodying the original proprietary code. Their method 
allows the construction of binary decision trees and so 
CART only asks yes/no questions [35]. Binary trees can be 
specifically applied in this context because the output is 
binary (with or without live birth), adjusting better to the 
form of human reasoning. 
CART analysis generates simple and practical clinical 
decision rules. Every value of each variable is considered as 
a potential split (parent nodes), and the CART method 
divides the selected range of variables to obtain an optimal 
binary split into two subgroups (child nodes)[34]. From this, 
CART analysis generated an optimal classification tree 
(minimal cost tree), and numerical rank for each input used 
to build the tree by relative importance. The software took 
into account that the database is unbalanced once option 
DATA was chosen in the priors of model setup. Gini 
impurity criterion was adopted as the node splitting rule. 
CART performed ten-fold cross-validation, and AUC was 
used to evaluate the accuracy of the model and compare it to 
the logistic regression model.  
III. 
RESULTS 
 The CART analysis showed that the best discriminators 
for classification were AFC, AMH, female’s age, infertility 
cause, and female’s BMI. Figure 1 shows the optimal tree 
generated by this analysis, which means the tree with 
minimal cost generated by CART software. The tree has six 
splits and produces seven terminal nodes. Only two terminal 
nodes result in live birth class: node 3 and node 6. Node 3 
includes the couples with values of AFC>10.50, female’s 
age≤35.5 years and disovulation as a cause of infertility. 
Node 6 represents the couples with AFC between 10.50 and 
26.50, female’s age≤35.5 years, AMH>1.58 ng/mL, female’s 
BMI ≤ 25.50 Kg/m2 and with a cause of infertility which is 
not disovulation. The prevalence of live birth in these two 
nodes were 76.5% and 56.1%, respectively. Terminal nodes 
1,2,4,5 and 7, obtained from the optimal tree, are determined 
as a group of couples without a live birth.  
Table I shows the confusion matrix (also known as an 
error matrix) on the test set, allowing visualization of the 
performance of the model in terms of correct/incorrect 
classified cases. Table II reports the evaluation metrics on 
the test set. The AUC test for the discriminatory ability of the 
final prediction model is 0.68021 on train set and 0.59621 on 
the test set.

IV. 
DISCUSSION 
To our knowledge, this is the first decision tree reported 
in the literature for live birth IVF-ICSI prediction that 
accounts only on pre-treatment data from couples. The 
created tree provides the possibility of defining groups of 
couples for whom the probability of live birth is very small 
or very high. The overall rate of at least one live birth was 
31.4% a priori and this tree returns a range of probabilities 
of success (green percentages represented in Figure 1) from 
18.7% to 76.5%. This is the optimal tree computed by 
CART, and the features selected as better splitters were 
mainly 
woman’s 
characteristics. 
The 
only 
man’s 
characteristic 
that 
integrates 
this 
tree 
appears 
in 
“disovulation?” question which divides couples according to 
infertility cause. 
The initial if question “AFC≤10.50?” splits the initial 
sample of 737 couples in two groups according to levels of 
AFC: AFC lower or equal to 10.50 classifies couples 
automatically with “No live birth” (Node 1) once only 18.7% 
of couples in that condition achieve a live birth. This result 
corroborates older literature findings in which women with 
low values of AFC had more difficulty to have success in 
IVF-ICSI [18][36].  
Going down the tree, the group of women with a value of 
AFC higher than 10.50 are split according to their age: if the 
female’s age is higher than 35.50 years then the tree 
classifies that group with “No live birth” (Node 2) because 
69.7% of couples from our database did not achieve live 
birth. This result also agrees with literature because of the 
loss of fertility with aging in women, mainly due to the 
decrease of gamete’s quantity and quality over the years 
[16][33][37]. 
Continuing down the tree, couples with younger women 
(female’s age lower than 35.50 years) are parcelled out 
according to infertility cause. Couples in which women have 
disovulation are classified with “Live Birth” once 76.5% of 
couples in the Node 3 conditions accomplished a live birth. 
The tree continues with the remaining causes of infertility 
(tubal, endometriosis, male factor, both female and male 
factor, multiple female factors, unexplained or other). Once 
IVF/ICSI has higher success rates on male factor [38][39] 
and disovulation, we expected that the male factor was also a 
tree splitter. 
Next, AFC values split the couples with all of the 
infertility causes mentioned before, which were not 
disovulation. Thus, AFC is used two times as a splitter in this 
tree, thus becoming the most important splitter according to 
CART software scoring variables output. Node 4 classifies 
women with AFC higher than 26.50 follicles with “No live 
birth”. This was not expected according to literature 
[18][36]. However, this result shows that AFC is not 
sufficient as an ovarian reserve marker and that is why AMH 
appears as next splitter. 
Node 5 classifies women with values of AMH serum 
lower than 1.58 ng/mL with “No live birth” since 71.4% of 
35 women in that node did not reach the live birth. This 
result about AMH reinforces La Marca [19]  results in which 
probabilities of live birth are higher on women with AMH 
0.4ng/mL-<2.8 ng/mL and even higher on the group with 
AMH≥2.8 ng/mL. The value 1.58 ng/mL is in the middle 
category of La Marca study.  
Continuing down the tree, women with higher values of 
AMH are split according to their BMI. Again, following the 
previous conditions of the tree, if the female’s BMI is higher 
than 25.50 Kg/m2, then the prevalence of no live birth is 
65.3%. In that way, it is better to have a value of female’s 
BMI lower than 25.50 Kg/m2 (taking into account all of the 
previous conditions that lead to Nodes 6 and 7). According 
to Adolphe Quetelet scale of BMI used worldwide [40], a 
BMI higher than 25 Kg/m2 is related to pre-obesity and 
lower than that value is associated with normal weight. 
Various studies showed that overweight women have 
ovulatory problems and increased risks of abortion [41][42]. 
To our knowledge, since this is the first decision tree in 
this context with only pre-treatment features and with live 
birth as output, we do not have any direct possible 
comparison with other models especially in terms of 
variables included in the final model and AUC values. 
However, we can indirectly compare with models referred in 
introduction section, namely RIMARK, RF, RPART and 
1NN and observe that they have much higher values of 
accuracy. Milewska et al’s model [26] with decision trees 
also has higher accuracy than our model because they used 
under treatment features and their output was “pregnancy” 
and not live birth. 
An advantage of decision trees is that they are easily 
readable and understandable. Using such a proposed 
approach, it becomes easy for doctors to explain to couples 
their situation following the decision tree until the terminal 
node. On the other hand, classic logistic regressions result 
from computation coefficients that, most likely, will be far 
from intuitive to explain to all patients. 
In future work, we plan to investigate the “without live 
birth” nodes in order to further analyze the causes of in vitro 
treatments unsuccess. Furthermore, we intend to collect more 
data to validate our model, possibly improve accuracy, and 
explore other artificial intelligence algorithms with deep 
learning approach.  
V. 
CONCLUSION 
In this study, clinical and lifestyle factors of 737 infertile 
couples were used to create a classification decision tree. 
This tree incorporates the five optimal features to provide a 
probability of live birth due to IVF-ICSI: AFC, female’s 
age, AMH, infertility cause, and female’s BMI. Decision 
trees building allows that the variables might be dependent 
and so this method gives successful results in terms of

evaluating these variables together and bringing up relations 
between variables. Furthermore, decision trees are intuitive 
and easier to explain to patients. 
As we said before, the work presented in this short paper 
is only part of the whole study done. The ultimate goal is to 
use the most accurate model for the development of a 
clinical support interface. Also, further data are pending 
collection for validation. In that way, this decision tree 
might result in a new clinical support system that helps 
physicians to deal with the couple's expectations.
