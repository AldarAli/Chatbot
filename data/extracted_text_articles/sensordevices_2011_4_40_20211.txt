Abstract—In this paper, the potentialities of the manganese
oxide compound La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) for the realization
of sensitive room temperature thermometers and magnetic
sensors are discussed. For these two applications, the sensor
performances are described in terms of signal to noise ratio
especially in the 1 Hz-100 kHz frequency range. It is shown
that due to the very low 1/f noise level, LSMO based sensors
can exhibit competitive performances at room temperature.

thermometers
I. INTRODUCTION
Because of the colossal magnetoresistance effect and
the strong spin polarization at the Fermi level, the rare-
earth manganese oxides may ﬁnd important applications in
magnetoresistive devices such as magnetic random access
memories and magnetic sensors [1]. The large change of
their electrical resistance R at the metal-to-insulator transi-
tion, which takes place around 300 K makes them potential
materials for the fabrication of room temperature thermome-
ters. Ideal materials would indeed present at the desired
operating temperature T close to 300 K: i) the highest-
temperature coefﬁcient of the resistance (βT ), expressed in
K−1 and deﬁned as the relative derivative of the resistance
versus temperature

R · dR
dT , or βH, expressed in T−1, the
highest relative change of the resistance with the magnetic
ﬁeld µ0H and deﬁned as
1
R ·
dR
d(µ0H) (with µ0 the vaccum
permeability) and ii) the lowest noise level. The limits of
the device performances will then be given by the signal to
noise ratio.
Temperature coefﬁcient of the resistance values and oper-
ating temperatures are important parameters to be considered
in the fabrication of high sensitivity room-temperature ther-
mometers or magnetoresistances. However, more attention
should be drawn to the low-frequency noise level in these
materials since it can vary by several orders of magnitude
while βH or βT values may only vary by a factor less than
10. Noise is more difﬁcult to optimize since its origin is still
not well known [2].
Even if it does not exhibit the highest βT or βH values,
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO) has been selected among all the
possible manganite composition because it has shown the
lowest reported low-frequency noise level so far [3]–[9].
In this paper, sample preparation is shown in the next
Section. In Section III, the measurement set-up and the mea-
surement protocol and low frequency noise measurements
are presented. A discussion about the sensor performances
as a function of the geometry, of the bias condition and of
the frequency is given in Section IV. The performances in
terms of thermometers as well as magnetoresistive sensors
are then presented and compared with published values.
II. SAMPLE PREPARATION
The sensors consist in t=100 nm thick LSMO thin ﬁlms
deposited by pulsed laser deposition from a stoichiometric
target onto SrT iO3 [001] single crystal substrate. The laser
radiation energy density, the target-to-substrate distance,
the oxygen pressure and the substrate temperature were
220 mJ, 50 mm, 0.35 mTorr and 720
◦C respectively.
These parameter values were found optimal for producing
single-crystalline ﬁlms with smooth surface as judged by
x-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy. The x-ray
diffraction study indicated a full [001] orientation of the
LSMO ﬁlms. The magnetic moment as a function of the
temperature was measured using a superconducting quantum
interference device. We thus measured a Curie temperature
of about 340 K, typical for good quality ﬁlms of this
composition.
After LSMO deposition, a 200 nm thick gold layer
was sputtered on the ﬁlms in order to make low resistive
connections. The LSMO thin ﬁlms were patterned by UV
photolithography and argon ion etching to form lines. As
shown in Figure 1, the mask enables the study of lines
of four different widths W=20, 50, 100 and 150 µm. For
each width, ﬁve lengths L could be measured depending
on the position of the voltage contacts 50, 100, 150, 200,
and 300 µm. tens of samples with different geometries have

been investigated. Typical results for a 100 nm thick sample
are reported here.

probes IP and IM and 4 voltage probes (V1...V4, V1’...V4’) on each side
of the line. The line lengths between V1 -V2, V2 - V3 and V3 -V4 are
100 µm, 50 µm and 150 µm respectively.
III. LOW FREQUENCY NOISE MEASUREMENTS
A. Measurement set-up and protocol
The experimental set-up mainly consists in one low noise
high output impedance DC current source and a dedicated
low noise instrumentation ampliﬁer with the following char-
acteristics: a DC output dedicated to resistance measurement
with a voltage gain equal to 10 and an AC output dedicated
to noise measurements with a voltage gain around one
thousand and a 1 Hz-1 MHz bandwidth [10]. The input
voltage white noise is around 20 · 10−18 V2·Hz−1 and its
input current noise is negligible. The device is connected
at the output of the DC current source using IP and IM
pads (deﬁned in Figure 1). The DC voltage as well as
the voltage noise are measured using the instrumentation
ampliﬁer connected either on IP, IM pads for two probe
conﬁguration or on Vi, Vj (i,j=1..4 with i̸=j) for four
probe conﬁguration. A spectrum analyzer Agilent 89410A
calculates the noise spectral density for frequencies in the
1 Hz-1 MHz range.
According to [10], the DC current source is quasi-ideal:
its output impedance is inﬁnite and its noise contribution is
negligible. It is also assumed that the input impedance of the
instrumentation ampliﬁer is very high so that no DC current
ﬂows in its inputs. It will be also considered that the noise
contribution of the ampliﬁer is known and can be subtracted
from the measured noise when a device is connected at
its input. The noise of the measurement set-up is deduced
from the measurement performed at zero bias. This set-up
contribution is then removed for all the measurement points
when the current is non zero.
Different noise contributions that both generate white
noise and 1/f noise have to be considered in the sensor:
the voltage contact noise, the current contact noise and the
ﬁlm noise. Details can be found in [11] and it can be shown
that in the two probe conﬁguration, the ﬁlm and current
contact noise contributions are measured. In the four probe
conﬁguration, due to the high output impedance of the DC
current source, the current contact noise contribution can be
completely eliminated. Since no DC current ﬂows into the
voltage contact, one would assumed that no 1/f noise exists
for the voltage contact sources.
B. Obtained results
Figure 2 shows the noise spectral density measured in the
two probe (SV 2p) and the four probe conﬁgurations (SV 4p)
for the same DC current I. Two noise contributions were
found: a white noise one and a 1/f noise one. The white
noise level is clearly due the thermal noise contribution
given by 4 · kB · T · R (kB is the Boltzmann constant equal
to 1.38 · 10−23 J·K−1) and should not depend on the bias.
The white noise level is consistent with the expected value
deduced from the DC measurement of the sample resistance
thus validating the thermal origin of the white noise.
Figure 2.
Noise spectral densities in the two probe (SV 2p) and the four
probe (SV 4p )conﬁgurations for the same DC bias current. With the mask
shown in the Figure 1, the current contact noise is non negligible and may
have a great impact on sensor performances.
For this sample, the current contact contribution is much
higher than the ﬁlm noise. This results has already been
reported by other studies [12]. It can lead to an overes-
timation of the ﬁlm noise if the current source used for
the measurement does not exhibit a large output impedance
(at least 30 times higher if the current contact noise is one
thousand time higher than the ﬁlm noise).
The contact contribution originates from the contact be-
tween gold and LSMO and thus presents a great impact
for sensor applications. The sensor can not be used with
two contact conﬁguration. A four probe conﬁguration must
be used to ensure best signal to noise ratio. Moreover, the
metallic pads used for the voltage contacts have also to be
64

placed in a correct manner in order to avoid any possible
current path through this metallic contact. As a consequence,
metallic voltage pads should not be placed onto the line
(like in Transmission Line Measurement (TLM) patterns for
instance) but on the side of the line in order to achieve a
low frequency noise level sensor.
Figure 3 shows the voltage noise spectral density mea-
sured for a typical device (W=50 µm and L=300 µm) in four
probe conﬁguration for different values of the bias current I
in the device. The inset shows the noise level at 1 Hz versus
the DC voltage V across the sample. As expected, the white
noise level does not depend on the bias current and 1/f noise
level depends on the square of the DC voltage V.
Figure 3.
Noise spectral density measured in the four probe conﬁguration
at different bias currents. White noise does not depend on the bias point
on the contrary of 1/f noise. The inset shows that the 1/f noise at 1 Hz
depends on the square of the DC voltage V.
From measurements performed on different geometries,
it follows that the 1/f noise level at 1 Hz is in the inverse
ratio of the device volume W · L · t. Finally, the noise
spectral density of the sample in the four probe conﬁguration
SV 4p(f) can be written as follow:
SV 4p(f) =
K1/f
f · W · L · tV 2 + 4 · kB · T · ρ · L
W · t
(1)
In equation 1, ρ is the ﬁlm electrical resistivity (typical
value of 2 mΩ·cm for LSMO at 300 K) and K1/f is
a material characteristic independent of the geometry that
quantify the value of the 1/f noise level. In this sample,
K1/f is found around 1 · 10−30 m3.
Equation (1) clearly shows length and bias dependency
of the noise are completely different in the low frequency
and white noise ranges. These discussions are extended in
the next Section in the framework of sensor performance
analysis.
IV. SENSOR PERFORMANCES
In this Section, the performances in terms of signal to
noise ratio will be presented and discussed in the case of
thermometers and magnetoresistance sensors.
A. Background
To use the devices as sensors, a current source is con-
nected and the voltage across the sensor is measured. A
four probe conﬁguration will be used to avoid the current
contact noise contribution. Either the temperature T or the
magnetic ﬁeld µ0H are the mesurand. For these theoretical
derivations, the mesurand will be noted M and the relative
sensitivity βM, deﬁned in the following equation, will be
used:
βM = 1
R ·
 dR
dM

M0
(2)
M0 is the DC value of the mesurand for which the
relative sensitivity is estimated. The equivalent input sensor
noise SM(f) is given by the ratio of the voltage noise
spectral density of the sensor SV (f) (given by SV 4p(f)
in the case of our LSMO samples in the previous sample)
over the square of the voltage sensitivity at M0 given by
(dV/dM = V · βM). Using equation (1), it follows that
SM(f) ﬁnally writes:
SM(f)

(dV/dM)2
=

β2
M

K1/f
f · W · L · t + 4 · kB · T · ρ · L
V 2 · t · W

(3)
In order to obtain the smallest noise sensor, this equation
shows that in addition to large sensitivity values, low value
of the 1/f noise parameter K1/f and low value of the
electrical resistivity are ﬁrst required. Two geometrical and
bias dependencies can then be distinguished:
• in the low frequency part where 1/f noise dominates,
the equivalent input sensor noise does not depend on
the bias and the sample should have the largest volume
W · L · t.
• in the white noise range of frequencies, the equivalent
input sensor noise decreases with the square of the bias
voltage. The geometry should have the smallest ratio
value L/W and the sensor should also be as thick as
possible.
All these considerations obviously do not take into ac-
count other constraints such as frequency bandwidth or
cost, which usually leads to opposite conclusions in term
of device volume or size. These results are illustrated in
the next Sections for thermometers and magnetoresistance
sensors for a optimal devices regards 1/f noise (L=300 µm,
W=150 µm).

B. Thermometers
LSMO electrical resistivity ρ and relative temperature
sensitivity βT (also called TCR for thermometers) versus
temperature T are shown in Figure (4). In this kind of
material, a transition from metallic to insulator behavior
occurs for temperature close to room temperature as already
reported [13]. In this sample, the maximum value of βT is
found for temperature close to 330 K. A typical value is
reported in Table I.
Figure 4.
LSMO electrical resistivity ρ(square symbols, left axis) and
relative temperature sensitivity βT (circle symbols, right axis) versus
temperature T in the 300-380 K range for a line with W =50 µm and
L=300 µm. The maximum sensitivity is found around 330 K where
βT =2.7 ·10−2 K−1.
C. Magnetoresistance sensors
LSMO electrical resistance and relative magnetic ﬁeld
sensitivity βH as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld µ0 ·H are
shown in the Figure 5. Due to the ferromagnetic behavior
of LSMO at room temperature, a magnetoresistance effect
is observed. Two kinds of effect can be distinguished: i)
a Colossal MagnetoResistance effect (CMR) for magnetic
ﬁeld values greater than 2 mT [14], [15] and ii) a low
magnetoresistance effect for magnetic ﬁeld values close to
0.5 mT. The ﬁrst one leads to a small sensitivity with no
interesting sensor applications. The second one is related to
the magnetization reversal [16]–[18]. It leads to two peaks in
the R versus µ0H characteristic and a relatively high value
of the relative magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity (absolute typical
values around 1 T−1 for an operation point around 1 mT )
at room temperature (cf. Table I).
D. Discussions
In this discussion, it will be assumed that the thermometer
or the magnetoresistance is connected in four probe conﬁg-
uration and that the device geometry leads to the smallest
value of 1/f noise. The noise performances in terms of
equivalent input sensor noise values of DC current will be

with W =50 µm and L=300 µm. Magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to the current
direction. Sensitivity maxima observed at low magnetic ﬁeld are related to
the magnetization reversal in the ﬁlm.

calculated with the data in Table I for three values of the
DC current I=100 µA, I=1 mA and I=5 mA.
Table II summarizes the results for a 150 µm wide
and 300 µm long thermometer or magnetoresistance at
optimal operating point (330 K for the thermometer, 300
K and 0.1 mT for the magnetoresistance). In this Table,
the equivalent input sensor noise has been calculated at two
frequencies (30 Hz and 10 kHz) to distinguish between the
low frequency domain where 1/f noise dominates and the
white noise domain.
The equivalent input sensor spectral densities ST (f) (also
called NET Noise Equivalent Temperature) and SH(f)
calculated using equation 3 and data from Table I are
shown in Figure 6. As expected, the spectral density at
low frequency does not depend on the bias when 1/f noise
dominates. On the contrary, at high frequency, the noise
level is directly related to the applied bias current. From
this Figure, it appears that ultimate performances can be
achieved at highest current. This remarks has obviously to
be moderated by the fact that self heating effects occur for
too high current values so that the noise performances will

be discussed in the following for a bias current limited to
100 µA. At low bias current, the 1/f noise contribution is
negligible. In this LSMO sample, due to the low value of
the 1/f noise level, the noise spectral density mainly consists
in white noise even at a bias current of about 300 µA.

densities ST (f) (ﬁlled symbols) or SH(f)( open symbols) using equation
(3) and the Table I data for three values of the DC current I for a 150 µm
width and 300 µm length sensor.
These NET values are lower (at least one magnitude
order) than the one of other uncooled thermometers such
as amorphous semiconductors, vanadium oxides, etc. or the
well-known Pt100 thermometer [8], [9]. This can easily be
explained by the lower noise level of epitaxial manganites
thin ﬁlms compared to others. The results show that despite a
quite small TCR value and thanks to a very low-noise level,
LSMO thin ﬁlms are real potential material for uncooled
thermometry.
According to [19] where equivalent input sensor spectral
densities SH(f) have been compared for various kinds
of magnetic sensors, this LSMO magnetoresistance noise
performances are better than hall effect sensors. Equivalent
input sensor spectral densities is only one order of magnitude
higher than commercial honeywell HMC1001 sensors. Same
results are also proposed by [19], [20]. These results are
promising since the mask used was not optimized for sensor
applications so that the sensitivity could be increased by
changing the substrate type or the line geometry. Moreover,
it has been demonstrated that LSMO can be deposited
onto silicon substrate [21] without modiﬁcations of the
magnetic properties: compatibility with the standard semi-
conductor used in the microelectronic industry has thus been
demonstrated. This is another way to extend to ”More than
Moore” idea proposed by the International Roadmap for
Semiconductor by the integration of manganese oxide.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the potentialities of LSMO thin ﬁlms as
magnetic and temperature sensors at room temperature have
been reported. It has been shown that a four probe con-
ﬁguration is required to remove the current contact noise
that is often several order of magnitude higher than the
material noise. In such conditions, It has been shown that
the performances of the room thermometers are competitive
and that magnetoresistance exhibits noise performances one
decade better than classical hall effect sensors.
