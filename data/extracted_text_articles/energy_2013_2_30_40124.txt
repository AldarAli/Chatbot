Abstract- In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient 
management scheme of sensor data for building energy saving. 
To manage buildings, we collect data from the variety of 
sensors in buildings able to recognize illumination, motion, 
temperature, humidity and so on. We analyze this data and 
derive energy saving measures from it. In case there is a large 
amount of data from the sensors, most of it is redundant if the 
data period is shorter than needed for services. We need a 
method to manage the data and to save the data in a resource-
efficient manner, in terms of energy, time and space to save the 
data. Therefore, we propose a method to select the adequate 
period of sensor data to manage and use some meaningful data 
for the energy saving service. Using this method, we can save 
the resources for sensor data and derive the energy saving 
measures more quickly and efficiently without all sensor data. 
Keywords-Resource; Sensor Data; Compression; Energy. 
I. 
 INTRODUCTION 
These days, environment pollution and climate changes 
have become world-wide issues [1], and international 
community has made progress towards the reduction of 
carbon emissions. To support these efforts, many kinds of 
green technologies are studied in many areas including 
buildings. Since residential and commercial buildings 
consume over 21% of total energy use in South Korea, many 
energy management solutions in buildings are studied and 
developed such as Building Automation System (BAS) and 
Building Energy Management System (BEMS) [2]. BEMS 
manages and saves energy consumption in buildings by 
collecting many kinds of data from building automation 
system and sensors in buildings. Some BEMS technologies 
have more than 8,000 sensors, so the volume of sensor data 
is too large to save and manage. Many works have studied 
the compressing of data in order to save resources [3][4], 
such as energy, time, storage and so on. Shannon-Nyquist 
sampling theorem has been widely used as a base theory for 
digital systems [5][6]. But, the theorem is assessed again in 
academia by Compressed Sensing (CS) theory [7][8].  
Donoho et al. introduce CS and show that fewer number of 
samples are required than the conventional approach. They 
consider that raw samples are redundant and can be 
compressed before being transmitted.  
In this paper, we propose a method of efficient 
management of sensor data in terms of energy, time and 
space saving. We collect data from sensors and save it into 
the database according to the service interval. Using our 
scheme, we can save energy, time and space for the sensor 
data for building energy saving.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: We 
introduce background and related works in Section II. We 
propose resource-efficient management scheme of sensor 
data in Section III. Finally, we draw conclusions in Section 
IV.

RELATED WORKS 
A. Conventional Compression and Compressive Sensing 
Mechanism 
In a conventional sensor system, each sensor node 
performs Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) at the 
Nyquist rate that should be set at least twice the maximum 
frequency of the measured signal [9]. Uniformly spaced 
samples are obtained during a fixed time period. These raw 
samples are redundant and they can be compressed before 
being transferred. Because sending the redundant data is 
inefficient, compression can be done in order to reduce the 
number of bits transmitted and save transmittal power.  
However, two things are considered for this approach. First, 
is that all the sensed samples are required to be gathered and 
stored at a collaboration location, and thus inter sensor 
correlation cannot be performed unless all the sensed 
samples are at a single location. Second, compression 
operations can be performed at the central location.

Compressive sensing is a sampling method that converts 
high dimension input signal into another signal that lies in a 
space of smaller dimension [10][11]. As described in Figure 
1, Donoho et al. suggested the compressive sensing theory, 
which obtains compressed signal from complex signal 
processing using simple matrix operations, under the 
assumption that the observed signal is sparse [7][9]. Using

CS, obtaining signal from sensors can be very simple and 
efficient without complex computation [6].  
B.  Building Energy Management Technology 
As time goes on, the performance of various equipments 
in buildings is degraded, and energy usage increases because 
of faults and errors of the old equipments. So, building 
energy management is essential for maintaining initial 
performance [2]. However, equipments in most buildings are 
not managed systematically and professionally, because 
monitoring and inspection of the facilities are mostly based 
on the facility managers’ experience. To solve these 
problems, many technologies, such as Energy Management 
Systems (EMS), Facility Management Systems (FMS) and 
BEMS, have been developed and used for building 
management. For these technologies, the main mechanism 
for efficient management of building is BEMS. The 
technology includes the software, hardware, and services 
associated with the Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT)-based monitoring, management, and 
control of energy. The main function of BEMS is to reduce 
the whole energy cost by decreasing energy consumption. 
The BEMS is similar to a traditional BMS, but it differs in 
that it places more emphasis on energy [3]. The BEMS has 
many functions for building energy management, and its 
main features are as follows:   
- Monitor, track, control, and manage buildings to reduce 
energy use and maintain comfort of residents 
- Provide optimized energy control measures by reducing 
unnecessary energy use 
- Monitor, track, and manage equipment and energy 
usage via sensors, meters and systems  
 
These days, most of BAS vendors have their own 
building management solutions. As shown in Figure 2, the 
Enterprise Buildings Integrator (EBI) system of Honeywell 
is for integrated facility management, application areas in 
buildings to provide control and manage functions [12]. The 
Architecture of Honeywell EBI system consists of various 
databases and application programs, which enable building 
managers to monitor, control and display the equipments in 
buildings. Siemens has building automation software, named 
APOGEE [13], which offers many functions for building 
management. First, it integrates multiple building systems no 
matter the manufacturer or installer achieving greater 
flexibility through open protocol interoperability. Also, it 
expands, upgrades, and optimizes facility systems in 
buildings.

RESOURCE-EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT SCHEME OF 
SENSOR DATA 
We implemented a resource-efficient management 
scheme of sensor data for building energy saving. There is a 
lot of data from various sensors in buildings that can be used 
for energy saving. From all this data, we periodically select 
only some data to use and manage, considering the service 
interval. For example, if the service interval is 15 minutes, 
then we choose 1 piece of data per 1 minute. This way, the 
amount of data is smaller than that of original data. Also, 
data processing time can be reduced. As illustrated in Figure

3, the Remote Building Management Center (RBMC) 
manages a lot of building energy. Each building has many 
sensors and meters to collect data such as temperature, 
humidity, illumination, motion, power and gas, and so on. 
For meaningful data, the number of sensors in a large 
building is over 8,000, and the interval of some sensor data is 
very short, such as 1 second or less. When data is collected 
from sensors in the unit time of 1 second, some data has 
different values at the same time due to the sensing range 
and the collecting time interval. Then, the data processing 
time, the size of the database and data consistency can be the 
problem in the RBCC.

We installed four kinds of sensors, such as illumination, 
temperature, humidity and motion, in our office as shown in 
Table I, where the temperature and humidity sensors exist in 
one module. We collected sensor data for 192 days in our 
office. Although the data is for only part of the building, the 
total amount of data is huge.

The interval of each sensor data and the number of data 
per minute is as illustrated in Table II. The data was 
collected and saved every 6-9 or 20 seconds, but energy 
saving services in buildings can be performed every 10 and 
15 minutes. The energy saving service for lamps in 
restrooms of our building is performed every 10 minutes, 
and the duration of 15 minutes is frequently used as time 
interval for delivering power meter information [12]. 
Although the duration is shorter, the amount of energy 
saving may be similar because of the cost of the power on 
and off. Furthermore, the comfort of the residences in a 
building can be reduced. If the duration is longer, then the 
amount of energy saving may be reduced. In case that the 
time interval is 15 minutes, the saving scenario is as follows: 
if there is no-one in a zone for 15 minutes, then the lights in 
the zone are automatically turned off. So, the number of data 
per minute is unnecessarily frequent for our service.

 We propose a method to save and manage the sensor data 
considering the service interval. We supposed that the 
interval of data from illumination, temperature and humidity 
is every 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15 minutes. The duration of 15 
minute is the unit of metering system for power usage 
statistics used in Korea [14]. Also, it is used for demand 
controller because the sensor values of temperature and 
humidity do not change much, and the value of illumination 
is needed only when the service is performed. However, the 
values of motion sensor are needed every minute to detect 
the duration of absence. So, we use the sensor data every 
minute among the collected data.  
   Table III shows the result of the number of data for one 
day to be saved in the database. The volume of data is very 
small and the time to save is shorter compared with the 
original data.

As illustrated in Figure 4, we get the pattern of one 
illumination sensor data for 1 hour from 7 to 8 AM in the 
morning to view detailed data. As seen in the graph, if the 
interval is over 10-minutes, then the effect of the energy

pick the reasonable duration for the service.

Figure 4.  Data of Illumination Sensor for 1 hour 
When the lux (lx) value for illumination is over 300, we 
know that the lamp is on. So, we can get the accuracy rate 
for the energy saving service using the following model: 
 
Accuracys,i= D300/DTotal                            (1) 
 
s: service, i: interval  
D300 : Number of lux data over 300 
DTotal: Number of total data 
 
In the 2-minute interval, the accuracy rate is 98.3 because 
the number of accurate data is 59 out of the total of 60. The 
number of accurate data for the durations of 5, 10, 15 
minutes are 58, 53 and 38, respectively. If the building 
policy of energy saving needs the accuracy rate of 90%, then 
the interval 10 and 15 have to be discarded. Table IV shows 
the comparison of the accuracy between the original data and 
the proposed mechanism for the data of 1 hour. In the table, 
we show the number of original data and the revised number 
of accurate data. Here, we assume that the data value is same 
as the previous data for the duration in the revised number of 
accurate data.

We get the illumination pattern for 1 day with the same 
sensor above as described in Figure 5. The patterns are 
almost the same even if the duration is longer. But, if we 
select sensor data for long duration, then the energy saving 
service also can’t be provided in time and the amount of 
saving energy is reduced. For example, if we have data for 
each 5 minutes, then the light may be turned on for 4 minutes 
and 59 seconds after users’ absence. So, we have to select 
the adequate period considering the energy saving rate and 
data management time and storage space as following: 
 
Period s,i= α × Saving energy + β × Saving db, time 
 - γ× Error probability                      (2) 
 
s: service, i: interval  
α : The weight of the energy model 
β : The weight of the database and processing time 
γ : The weight of the error probability 
 
In (2), the weight for the period of data selection is 
determined by the building energy manager. The error 
probability is calculated as:

Table V shows the result when we assume that all values 
of α, β, and γ are 1. We consider the accuracy rate for energy 
saving, then we select the data period as 1 minute. We can 
select best period as 1 minute. Also, 2 or 5 minutes of 
intervals can be chosen according to the building’s energy 
policy. 10 or 15-minute interval is difficult to be selected 
because the probability of service error is high and the 
amount of energy saving is reduced. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
Because the environment pollution and climate changes 
have become world-wide concerns, energy saving is 
essential in all industrial areas. For this reason, several 
technologies are explored for saving energy in buildings. 
Among these technologies, BEMS manages and saves 
energy consumption in buildings by collecting several kinds 
of data. A challenge is that the large volume of sensor data 
constitutes a problem to save and manage.  
Many works have studied data compressing in order to 
save resources, such as energy, time, storage, and so on. 
These works consider that redundant raw samples can be 
compressed before being transmitted.  
In this paper, we proposed an efficient management of 
sensor data in terms of energy, space and time saving. Using 
our proposed mechanism, the time and space to save the 
sensor data was reduced compared to the case that did not 
use our mechanism. We plan to measure and analyze the 
amount of the energy saving and its effects as further study. 
We are also planning to apply the compressive sensing 
regarding the relations among sensors.
