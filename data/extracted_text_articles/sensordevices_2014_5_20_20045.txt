Abstract—The purpose of this research is to demonstrate a new 
design for a mass sensor with a disc-shaped resonator that is 
free of power supply lines. The line-free mass sensor comprises 
a resonator and a piezoelectric element for vibrating it. Since 
electrical power is used to actuate the piezoelectric element, the 
resonator is free from power lines. Target molecules become 
attached to the resonator, changing its resonant frequency. The 
geometric shape and dimensions of the resonator were 
designed using the finite element method (FEM). The 
resonator was fabricated in the shape of a circular plate of 
diameter 4 mm by photolithography, so that the radial 
oscillation primary mode of vibration would be 3.68 MHz. The 
concentrations of glucose solutions were measured using the 
line-free mass sensor. The sensitivity of the line-free mass 
sensor was estimated to be 0.06 fg when a frequency resolution 
of 1 mHz was used.

 INTRODUCTION 
Micro-cantilever transducers have certain advantages 
in terms of detecting and identifying chemical and 
biological elements in air or liquid environments with high 
sensitivity [1][2]. The sensitivity of micro-cantilever 
transducers is superior to those of traditional quartz crystal 
microbalances (QCM) [3] and surface acoustic wave (SAW) 
[4] transducers. It has been reported in one theoretical study 
that the potential measurement sensitivity of micro-
cantilever transducers is 2.34 × 10-19 g [5]. 
Crystal oscillators and piezoelectric elements can be 
used to excite vibrations in micro-cantilever transducers. 
When the excitation source is directly fixed to the micro-
cantilever, the electrical power required to feed it seriously 
degrades the vibrations. Moreover, capacitive coupling of 
the vibrator influences the frequency and decreases the 
quality factor (Q-factor) of the micro-cantilever transducers. 
We have already proposed a power supply line-free mass 
sensor for measuring biomarkers [6]. Our study indicates 
that, if an optical displacement sensor with a frequency 
resolution of 1 mHz is used, a sensitivity of 76.2 ng/ml can 
be achieved with a line-free mass sensor. 
The purpose of this research is to improve the 
sensitivity of a line-free mass sensor to as high as the tens of 
fg/Hz range. The geometric shape and dimensions of a disc-
shaped resonator were designed using FEM and the 
resonator was fabricated by photolithography. The measured 
results of glucose concentrations using the fabricated line-
free mass sensor were discussed. 
II. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
A. Structure and Principle 
The line-free mass sensor consists of a resonator, a 
piezoelectric element (20 mm diameter and 0.5 mm 
thickness, NEC Tokin Corporation, Japan) to excite the 
resonator as the vibrator, an alternating current power 
source, and an optical non-contact displacement sensor. 
Since the power source is used to actuate the vibrator, the 
sensing element, i.e. the resonator, is free from power lines 
(Figure 1(a)). A microscope-type Laser Doppler vibrometer 
(KV-100, Denshigiken Corporation, Japan) and a spectrum 
analyzer 
(frequency 
resolution: 
1 
mHz, 
Advantest 
Corporation, Japan) were used for measuring the resonant 
frequency of the resonator (Figure 1(b)). 
Firstly, the target material adheres to the resonator

without chemical bonding. Then the resonator is placed on 
the piezoelectric element. When the piezoelectric element is 
excited at an arbitrary frequency, the vibration is transmitted 
to the resonator mounted on it, which then vibrates at its 
resonant frequency. The resonator will never fall from the 
piezoelectric element because the amplitude of vibration is 
smaller than a nanometer scales. The change in resonant 
frequency is proportional to the mass of target material 
adhering to it. 
B. Design of Disc Resonator 
A disc-shaped resonator was designed to have a 
resonant frequency of several MHz (Fig.2). The outer 
diameter and thickness were 4.0 and 0.5 mm, respectively. 
The detecting area, d, was used as a parameter to design the 
resonator, then two types of resonator were fabricated (type 
A and B). Using an eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis 
employing a FEM was calculated to compare the resonance 
frequency of the two types of the resonator. The boundary 
conditions at the outer peripheral edge of the resonator were 
set to free edge. The density, longitudinal modulus of 
elasticity, and Poisson’s ratio were set to 2,329 kg/m3, 185 
GPa, and 0.28, respectively 
C. Fabrication of Disc-shaped Resonator 
A photolithography technique such as deep-reactive-
ion etching (DRIE) was used to fabricate the disc-shaped 
resonators with several diameters of detecting area from a 4-
inch sized silicon wafer. The entire photolithography 
process was carried out in three steps; 1st wet etching, 2nd 
wet etching, and DRIE process (Fig.3).  
1st wet etching process: A wafer was coated with a positive-
type photoresist (OFPR-800, Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co., Ltd, 
Japan) using a spin coater (ASC-4000, Actes Inc., Japan). 
The photoresist exposed to the UV light using a photomask 
α and a mask aligner (MA6, Suss MicroTec, Japan). After 
the developing, the silicon was liquid (wet)-etched to 
remove the unprotected oxide. The SiO2 was removed using 
hydrogen fluoride. Finally, the photoresist was removed 
from the substrate using heating sulfuric acid treatment.

2nd wet etching process: The wafer was coated with a 
positive-photoresist (PMER P-LA900, Tokyo Ohka Kogyo 
Co., Ltd, Japan) using the spin coater. The photoresist was 
exposed using a photomask β and the mask aligner. After 
that, the developing and the wet etching were processed. 
DRIE process: The 1st DRIE was performed for 23 min 
using a DRIE system (MUC-21, Sumitomo Precision Co. 
Ltd., Japan). After the photoresist was removed, a 
supporting substrate was adhered using the positive-type 
photoresist. The 2nd DRIE was performed for 90 min using 
the DRIE system. Finally, the supporting substrate was 
peeled using a stripping solution (Microposit Remover 1165, 
Shipley Co., Inc., US).

D. Measurement of Resonant Frequency 
The resonant frequencies of each mode of vibration of 
the disc-shaped resonators were measured using a 
microscope-type Laser Doppler vibrometer, a spectrum 
analyzer, and a xyz stage.  
E. Measurement of Glucose Concentration 
As a typical human blood biomarker, glucose was 
selected as a sample material to evaluate the sensitivity of 
the line-free mass sensors. A set of D(+)-glucose (180.16, 
CAS No. 50-99-7, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., 
Japan) solutions with concentrations between 250 ng/mL 
and 100 mg/mL was used. 
A 0.1 μL sample of each solution was dropped on the 
detecting area of the disc-shaped resonator by a precision 
dispenser (SMP-3, Musashi Engineering, Inc., Japan). After 
that, the disc-shaped resonator was dried at room 
temperature for 10 min. The change in resonant frequencies 
compared to those without the sample solutions was then 
measured for each glucose concentration. 
The disc-shaped resonator was cleaned using an 
ultrasonic washing machine (2210DTH, Emerson Japan Ltd., 
Japan) for 5 min. and dried for 30 min. in order to refresh 
and reuse it.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Design and Fabrication of Disc Resonator 
The calculated results of the resonant frequencies for 
types A and B at 1st mode were 3.919 and 1.934 MHz, 
respectively (Table I). The surface areas of types A and B 
were 0.2 and 0.6 mm2, respectively. The type A condition 
was selected to fabricate the disc-shaped resonator. 
A disc-shaped resonator was fabricated from a silicon 
wafer. 
B. Measurement of Resonant Frequency 
The measured results of the resonant frequency of type 
A was 3.682 MHz, which agreed well with the theoretical

results obtained using FEM (Fig.4). The Q-factor was 
calculated to be 10,000, which was particularly high 
compared with those given in previous reports [1] [3]. It was 
considered that the noise of frequency was reduced enough 
to synchronize with the exciting frequency by use of the 
spectrum analyzer.

C. Measurement of Glucose Concentration 
The glucose concentrations were converted into a mass 
of glucose per 0.1μL of sample volume (Fig.5). The 
frequency shifts for the 0.1, 1 and 10 μg masses of glucose 
were 0.45, 1.64, and 16.52 kHz, respectively (Fig.5 (a)). The 
frequency shifts for the 0, 25, 33, 50 and 100 pg of glucose 
samples were 0, 0.24, 0.54, 0.98, and 1.83 kHz, respectively 
(Fig.5 (b)). The results of a linear regression analysis 
between 0 – 100 pg for the line-free mass sensor showed the 
R2 value to be 0.97. The calibration curve between the 
frequency shift, ∆f, and the mass of glucose, m, is given by 
∆f = 18.027×m×1012 (Hz), showing that the frequency shift 
is proportional to the concentration of m in the sample 
solution. Since the frequency shifts by 18.03 Hz per 1 pg 
mass of glucose, the sensitivity is calculated as being 55 
fg/Hz. Finally, the sensitivity of the line-free mass sensor 
was estimated to be 0.06 fg because the optical 
displacement sensor has a frequency resolution of 1 mHz. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
We designed and analyzed the performance of a line-
free mass sensor, comprising a disc-shaped resonator and a 
separate excitation source. Our study indicates that, if an 
optical displacement sensor with a frequency resolution of 1 
mHz is used, a sensitivity of 0.06 fg can be achieved with 
this line-free mass sensor. This sensitivity is adequate for the 
required level in order to carry out salivary hormone analysis.
