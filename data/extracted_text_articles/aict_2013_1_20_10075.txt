Abstract—The use of Impulse Radio-Ultra Wide Band (IR-
UWB) introduced a low data rate and low power consumption 
systems, which are suitable for sensor networks. Due to strict 
regulations of the power transmission and frequency use, the 
range and usage of IR-UWB remained very limited. To enlarge 
the range of UWB, this paper presents a system design on how 
to replace the radio part of the physical layer (PHY) of UWB 
by free space optics, without changing the major parts of the 
standard, including frame structure and coding. The 
performance of such a system on optical links is analyzed in 
Monte-Carlo simulation. The utilization of optical links will 
offer new configurations for uplink and downlink.  This system 
will deal with optical noise and optical multipath channel and 
shows the performances of the new system in presence of Line 
of Sight (LOS) and diffuse links.

 INTRODUCTION 
The Optical Wireless Communications (OWC) is an 
alternative technology to radio communications, which 
suffers from congested frequency bands as the number of 
mobile users increased significantly. The OWC offer a broad 
unlicensed free spectrum that enables high data rate, low 
cost, high speed, and ease of development systems. These 
advantages make the optical solution attractive for short 
range communications applications, such as smart homes, 
smart offices, wireless LANs, and sensor networks. 
Currently, the ultra wideband systems are the best 
technology choice for short range communication, since they 
offer a large bandwidth (3.1-10.6 GHz), high speed, immune 
to multipath fading, multi access capabilities, and low cost 
transceivers. The fractional bandwidth of UWB is defined by 
FCC as a signal with 20% of its center frequency or 
500 MHz bandwidth, when the center frequency is above 
6 GHz with a limited power of -41.3 dBm/MHz [1]. The 
optical devices introduce a low modulation bandwidth, 
which does not exceed 20 MHz in case of using LED and 
hence limit the data rate and available broadband spectrum 
[2]. This limitation is caused by the characteristics of LEDs 
available in the market, which have a slow response to the 
feeding current. The 3dB frequency and hence the 
modulation bandwidth depends on minority carrier lifetime. 
To solve the limitation of modulation bandwidth problem, 
we recommend two solutions. We can use either special 
LEDs with larger modulation bandwidth similar to that used 
in fiber optical communications or we can use laser diodes, 
which offer bandwidth in GHz at expense of increasing 
shadowing effect due to the nature of direct light generated 
by laser diodes. Nevertheless, a lot of solid state electronics 
researches focus on optical wireless communication and this 
gives a sign that we will see high-speed low-cost LEDs in 
the next decade. 
The utilization of optical wireless links in IR-UWB 
systems will overcome the limitations in emission power and 
bandwidth and/or introduce a new Radio/Optical IR-UWB 
system where we can take advantages of both configurations. 
The optical links do not interfere with the electrical systems 
and they are not affected by multipath fading. This design 
will be suitable to operate in sensitive environments like 
hospitals where the radio communications are prohibited.  
In this paper, we have proposed a new optical IR-UWB 
system design to solve the problem discussed above. The 
conventional IR-UWB system employing radio antenna at 
the transmitter and receiver has been modified to be able of 
transmitting the information data via the optical link. To 
establish an optical link in our design, both antennae in 
transmitter and receiver are replaced by LEDs and 
photodetector respectively. The transmitted pulse is 
converted into light pulse by regulating the input current of 
light device to form the same shape of radio pulse. On the 
receiver side, the power of the received light signal will be 
detected by photodetector and converted at output to current 
levels which reconstruct the shape of transmitted pulse. The 
further steps of detection process are done as in IR-UWB 
radio systems.  
The rest of paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the 
system design describes the transmitter and receiver is 
presented. Also in Section II, the optical channel impulse 
response regarding the environment and SNR are explained. 
The system simulation is introduced and the results are 
discussed in Section III. Finally, Section IV concludes the 
paper. 
II. 
SYSTEM DESIGN 
 
A. 
Transmitter Design 
The transmitter of IR-UWB is modified to be able to 
transmit in the manner similar to optical pulses as shown in 
Fig. 1. We employ the Binary Pulse Position Modulation (2-
PPM) as presented in [1] combined with intensity 
modulation.

The Gaussian monocycle pulse
p ( )t
is used to drive the 
LED by convert it to a set of quantized current levels as 
shown in Fig. 2. The pulse is quantized to L current levels 
and every level is mapped to a defined brightness level. The 
current levels represent the intensity power should be non-
negative to ensure that the LED is not reversely biased.

A dc-bias is chosen to boost the negative part of the radio 
pulse in order to keep the diode in the ‘ON’ state and 
illuminates a 10% of full brightness. The constant forward 
current (I0) will keep the diode in ‘ON’ state even if the 
pulse time end and hence keep the diode operating in the 
active region. The modulation bandwidth should be 
increased since the diode rise and fall time regarding the 
diode switching operation is minimized. 
To create a different emission power for each of current 
level, we suggest the white-LED lnGaN/GaN to transmit the 
optical pulses. This white-LED proposed in [5] shows that 
the emission power in the blue spectrum portion is increased 
relative to the injected current. Nevertheless, a blue filter at 
the receiver Front-end should be used to gain the blue 
spectrum power. 
B. 
Optical Multipath Channel 
The optical multipath channel is characterized by an 
impulse response
h ( )t
, which describes the propagation of 
the optical signal between the transmitter and receiver. The 
propagation pattern is approximated by lambertian radiation 
pattern, which state that the light intensity emitted from a 
source has a cosine dependence on the angle of emission 
with respect to the surface normal [2,3]. The luminous 
intensity in angle φ  is given by

The optical channel is characterized by the room 
dimensions, reflectance indices of walls and transmitter and 
receiver orientation. Table I describes the parameters used 
to simulate the channel impulse response.  
The optical impulse response is used to calculate the 
channel gain, which is important to estimate the influence of 
channel on the received power. The power contained in a 
LOS component is larger than the power contained in the 
first reflection components as shown in Fig. 3 since the long 
distance and reflection from the surfaces introduce a power 
loss. The received power can be calculated when the 
transmitted power was 1 Watt as

Another important feature is the root mean squared 
(RMS) delay, which describes how much delay added by 
the channel. A large delay led to intersymbol interference 
(ISI), which make the detection of transmitted signal 
complicated. The RMS delay calculated from the channel

The RMS delay for the simulated channel is 0.49 ns, 
which define an upper bound for the transmission rate. For 
the proposed system, the symbol time is less than the RMS 
delay and hence no equalizer at the receiver side is needed.

In an optical wireless system, the noise is classified into 
two types namely the shot noise and thermal noise. The shot 
noise is a time-varying process generated by external light 
sources like background noise and quantum noise or internal 
source as intensity radiation, dark noise and excess noise. 
These sources are independent Poisson random variables 
and their photoelectron emission follows the distribution of 
Poisson distribution with mean equal to the sum of the 
individual processes. The variance of any shot noise process 
associated with photodetection are represented as

where q is the electronic charge, B is the equivalent 
bandwidth, and
i
is the mean current generated by 
n electron. However, if the photoelectron count is large, 
the generated signal current probability distribution can be 
approximated to be Gaussian process [6].

To evaluate the SNR required for a BER, the received 
power needed to achieve a BER of 10-6 is about 18dB. 
 
D. 
Receiver Design 
The receiver of optical system is based mainly on photo- 
detector employing the direct detection. The area of detector 
and the orientation play important roll in the receiver design 
and performance. The photodetector generates an output 
photocurrent relative to the incident light power pinging on 
the surface. i.e., the changes produced in intensity 
modulation at the transmitter are detected by direct 
detection at the receiver. The photocurrents induced by 
photodetector form a replica of the transmitted pulse. At the 
receiver Front-end the received signal is defined as

The optical channel impulse response in Fig. 3 is 
simulated in a room with dimensions of (5m×5m×3m) and a 
fixed transmitter and receiver are assumed. The optical 
pulse is convolved with the channel and added to the noise. 
 On the receiver side, the photo detector is percepts the 
incident light and converts it into current. We assume that 
the detector responsivity R  equal to one. The received 
pulse constructed from current levels is correlated with the 
mask of transmitted pulse and the peak power is compared

to the threshold in time window. This system is assumed to 
be synchronized and no equalization stage is performed. 
In OWC systems, a unit rectangular pulse is used to 
transmit the power of modulated binary bits with duration 
Ts. [8, 9]. In Fig. 4, the same system design was simulated 
using rectangular pulse and monocycle pulse to compare the 
BER performances of using the shaped pulse used for 
wireless system and rectangular pulse used in OWC 
systems. Fig. 4 shows that the BER for both signals are 
equal, which is evident that other pulses shape could be used 
without loss of performances. Although rectangular pulse 
evaluation is simpler than Gaussian pulse, the later 
introduces capability for utilizing advantages of a designed 
UWB radio wireless system communicating on optical link 
in sensitive environments. Nevertheless, the effects of LEDs 
nonlinearities and shot noise are expected to disfigurement 
the transmitted Gaussian pulse at transmitter and receiver 
front-ends. These effects will be studied experimentally in 
the future work to find the performance degradation for the 
proposed design.  
Fig. 5 compares the BER performance of the proposed 
systems operate on LOS optical wireless channel with that 
on diffuse channel in the absence of LOS link. The direct 
path between transmitter and receiver delivers higher power 
than paths reach the photodetector after reflections. This 
explains why the BER in the presence of LOS channel is 
lower than that in diffuse channel by ~2dB. Also, the 
influences of optical wireless channel gain and delay on the 
proposed system increase the BER by ~4dB compared to the 
AWGN bound. The use of equalization techniques such as 
zero forcing or decision feedback equalizer will enhance the 
system performances because the shape of the transmitted 
pulse at receiver is better restored.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
In this paper, a new design of optical IR-UWB is 
introduced to overcome the limitations of power and 
bandwidth since optical links introduce unlimited bandwidth 
and no constrains on the emitted power. Our design will be 
suitable for non radio environments like hospitals or for 
systems that operate in both optical/radio configurations. 
The optical wireless link is established between the 
transmitter and receiver by replacing antennae with optical 
devices. Also, the radio pulse is quantized and offset is 
added to define an optical version of the radio Gaussian 
pulse. The optical pulse is transmitted using an optical 
device and received by a photodetector. The effects of the 
optical multipath channel are investigated and the system 
performance using Monte-Carlo simulations has been 
obtained and analyzed.  
This work will be continued to introduce a better system 
performance using equalization techniques. Also, the LEDs 
characteristics effects on pulse shaping process will be 
investigated in order to achieve experimental results and 
build a demonstrator for the proposed system.
