Abstract—In this paper, we present a Dynamic and Opportunistic 
Spectrum Access (DOSA) technique that allows access to the static 
and equal licensed 28 GHz millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum 
of each Fifth-Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) Mobile Network 
Operator (MNO) to every other MNOs in a country to serve their 
respective in-building Small Cells (SCs) subject to avoiding Co-
Channel Interference (CCI). We derive the system-level Average 
Capacity (CA), Spectral Efficiency (SE), and Energy Efficiency 
(EE) performance metrics for an arbitrary number of NR MNOs. 
With extensive simulation results and analyses for four MNOs, we 
show that the proposed DOSA can provide CA and SE 2.5 times 
and improve EE by about 60% as compared to that of the 
traditional Static and Equal Spectrum Access (SESA) technique. 
Moreover, DOSA can achieve both SE and EE requirements 
expected for the Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile networks by 
reusing the countrywide mmWave spectrum for 46.87% fewer 
buildings of SCs than that required by SESA.

I. INTRODUCTION  
      Traditionally, the mobile radio spectrum specified for a 
country is allocated statically in an equal amount to each of its 
Mobile Network Operator (MNO) regardless of the inequality 
in the number of subscribers of one MNO from another. This 
uniform distribution of spectrum causes one MNO to allocate 
more spectrum than necessary, whereas the other MNO suffers 
from the lack of a sufficient amount of spectrum, resulting in 
low spectrum utilization. Due to this reason, such Static and 
Equal Spectrum Allocation (SESA) is no longer considered 
effective. Recently, Cognitive Radio (CR) has been considered 
an effective technology to address this issue. In CR, the 
spectrum is given access to the secondary User Equipment (UE) 
with the primary UE to use unused spectra of the primary UE 
opportunistically, resulting in improving spectrum utilization.  
    Several research studies have addressed the spectrum 
allocation problem in CR systems. For example, to address 
constraints with SESA, an underlay CR access technique in 
Saha [1] and an interweave shared-use model in Saha [2] have 
been presented to share the unused millimeter-wave (mmWave) 
spectrum of one MNO to another. However, both studies are 
limited by the assumption of a specific number of MNOs in a 
country. In this paper, we address this constraint by relaxing 
this assumption and present a Dynamic and Opportunistic 
Spectrum Access (DOSA) technique for an arbitrary number of 
MNOs to share the 28 GHz spectrum opportunistically with in-
building Small Cells (SCs) of each Fifth-Generation (5G) New 
Radio (NR) MNO with that of other MNOs in a country.  
      The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system 
model, including the system architecture and the proposed 
DOSA technique, is presented. We formulate the problem in 
Section III. Section IV covers the performance results of the 
proposed technique where the Spectral Efficiency (SE) and 
Energy Efficiency (EE) performances are compared with that 
of the prospective Sixth-Generation (6G) mobile systems. We 
conclude the paper in Section V.   
II. SYSTEM MODEL 
A. System Architecture  
A system architecture consisting of an arbitrary O number 
of 5G NR MNOs in a country is considered. Each MNO 
comprises three Base Stations (BSs), including Macrocell BSs 
(MBSs), Picocell BSs (PBSs), and Small Cell BSs (SBSs). An 
SBS of each MNO is located in each apartment of any building, 
and each SBS can serve one Small Cell UE (SUE) at a time. 
SBSs operate in the 28 GHz, whereas MBSs and PBSs operate 
in the 2 GHz, bands. Assuming similar architecture of all 
MNOs, Figure 1 shows the system architecture of MNO 1.

5G NR MNO x in the primary level can be reallocated in the 
secondary level to SBSs of another MNO y in a building l as 
long as no UE of x exists within l to avoid Co-Channel 
Interference (CCI) between SBSs of x and y. 
     Let O denote a set of 5G NR MNOs in a country such that  

1,2,..., 

O

. Let each MNO is allocated to an equal amount 
of 28 GHz spectrum, denoted as M in Resource Blocks (RBs) 
where an RB=180 kHz. To analyze the performance, we 
consider that the occurrence (i.e., either presence or absence) of 
an SUE of each MNO within an apartment is equally likely over 
an observation period of 
T  Q
such that any combination of 
the occurrence of SUEs of all MNOs happens with a probability 
of 
2O 1
Q
 . The reallocated spectrum to an SUE of MNO o can 
be expressed as a set of

the left-justified Pascal’s triangle [3] corresponding to

. For example, the minimum reallocated spectrum of 
0 and the maximum reallocated spectrum of n M

 occur for 
an SUE of o, respectively, for no absence (Figure 1(c)) and no 
presence (Figure 1(b)) of SUEs of MNOs O\o in an apartment 
of a building.

IV. PERFORMANCE RESULT AND COMPARISON 
      Selected parameters and assumptions are given in Table I. 
Detailed parameters and assumptions can be found in [1]-[2]. 
From Figure 2(a) for a single building of SBSs of all MNOs, it 
can be observed that the proposed DOSA can provide 2.5 times 
average capacity and SE as compared to that of the traditional 
SESA. The additional 1.5 times improvement in the 
performance of the capacity and SE comes from reallocating 
mutually the licensed mmWave spectrum of one NR MNO to 
another. Due to the same reason, DOSA improves EE by about 
60% as compared to SESA.

      Figures 2(b)-2(c) show SE and EE responses of DOSA and 
SESA techniques when reusing the same countrywide 
mmWave spectrum to more than one building of SBSs (i.e., 
L>1) located over the macrocell coverage. Note that SE 
increases 
linearly, 
whereas 
EE 
improves 
negative-
exponentially, with an increase in L. This can be justified by the 
expressions of SE and EE in (8) and (9), respectively. 
Moreover, from Figures 2(b)-2(c), it can be found that the 
proposed DOSA technique outperforms SESA with a great 
margin in terms of SE and EE. Furthermore, it can be observed 
from Figures 2(b)-2(c) that the proposed DOSA technique can 
achieve both SE (10 times of 5G, i.e., 370 bps/Hz) and EE (10-
100 times of 5G, i.e., 0.03µJ/bit) requirements ([6]-[9])

countrywide mmWave spectrum for 46.87% less number of

V. CONCLUSION  
      A Dynamic and Opportunistic Spectrum Access (DOSA) 
technique has been presented to allow opportunistic and 
dynamic access to the static and equal licensed 28 GHz 
mmWave spectrum of one NR MNO to that of the other in a 
country to serve their in-building SCs. System-level Average 
Capacity (CA), Spectral Efficiency (SE), and Energy 
Efficiency (EE) performance metrics for an arbitrary number of 
NR MNOs are derived.  For an example case of four NR MNOs, 
the outperformance of DOSA in CA, SE, EE, as well as 
satisfying both SE and EE requirements expected for the future 
6G mobile networks, over that of SESA have been shown.
