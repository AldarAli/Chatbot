Abstract—A recently developed energy management platform
named MEU (an acronym for Management of Energy in Urban
areas) has been tested on three case study urban areas of a
few hundred buildings in the Swiss cities of la Chaux-de-Fonds,
Neuchˆatel and Martigny. The MEU simulation framework for
energy-efﬁcient systems simulates the buildings’ energy demand,
infers the production of the connected energy conversion systems,
and simulates the complete demand and supply energy ﬂow
picture. The platform is designed to use monitored consumption
data if available, and, where it is not, intends to produce
correct estimates of the average energy demands of housing
and administrative buildings. This article explores in detail the
capacity of the platform to correctly represent existing urban
areas’ energy ﬂow based on the limited data available by com-
paring the simulated values with monitored data. Default values
are carefully chosen to obtain a statistically adequate match,
thus strengthening the conﬁdence in simulation results when no
monitored data is available. The study also leads to interesting
observations and hypotheses regarding the energy efﬁciency of
existing buildings, and provides useful conclusions about the
possibilities and limitations of the simulation of disaggregated
urban energy ﬂow.
Keywords—urban energy ﬂow simulation, heating demand si-
mulation, calibration, veriﬁcation, monitored energy consumption,
energy demand and supply.

INTRODUCTION
D
ESPITE raising awareness of the problems associated
with the widely unsustainable modern energy use, much
improvement is still needed to reduce resource consumption.
A large part of energy use can be attributed to buildings in
urban zones, and urban populations are increasing. It is thus
of interest for research to propose innovative energy efﬁciency
measures and energy management tools for the urban context.
Such a tool, the MEU platform, is described and tested in
detail in this paper, after the ﬁrst results were presented in [1].
The MEU platform was developed through a collaboration
between several Swiss research labs (CREM in Martigny,
Hes-so Valais, CEN, LENI and LESO-PB at EPFL), cities
(Lausanne, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Martigny and Neuchˆatel) and
energy utilities (Synergy, Viteos, SSIGE). Its objective is to
offer a platform for the management of energy in urban areas,
considering neighbourhoods of a few hundred buildings and
based on the limited available data. Among the functionalities
required, speciﬁc features of this platform include:
•
consideration of individual buildings,
•
modelling of supply as well as demand,
•
combined use of available monitored data and spe-
cialised simulation tools to produce a coherent picture
of the urban energy ﬂow,
•
parallel modelling of the existing situation and of energy
efﬁciency scenarios.
The third point in particular is, to our knowledge, an un-
common feature. A speciﬁc approach is required to deal with
conﬂicting simulation results and monitored values. On the
other hand, the procedure offers a valuable opportunity to study
how micro-simulation tools for energy demand and supply
can be used to estimate real urban energy consumptions. The
study presented here exploits this opportunity as part of the
veriﬁcation and calibration process of the MEU platform.
The next section of this article reviews related research in
the domain of urban energy modelling. Section III gives an
overview of the methodology of the MEU platform, covering
its modelling approach, simulation method and implementation
structure. Section IV describes the models of the case study
neighbourhoods, the data sources used to create the models and
the choice of default values. Section V presents the results
of the calibration and comparisons between simulated and
monitored values. The results obtained through simulations are
discussed in Section VI, and Section VII provides a concise
conclusion of this paper.

STATE OF THE ART
Among the large number of research domains concerned by
urban energy simulation [2] [3], there is now a growing interest
in the evaluation of the energy need of larger and/or pre-
existing urban areas [4], to evaluate the energy performance
associated with alternative development or improvement sce-
narios. However, it remains a challenge today to simulate the
detailed energy ﬂow at the scale of a few hundred buildings,
including the demand and the supply sides [5]. The advantage
of this simulation approach is that it allows for the test of
260

scenarios of various levels of detail, covering in a large part the
options available to local politicians and energy departments.
The simulation of existing buildings’ disaggregated energy
ﬂow at a large scale is however complicated by a lack of
information regarding the buildings’ characteristics and energy
supply situation, and a limited number of veriﬁcation studies
comparing simulation tools’ results and monitored data.
Even when simulating individual new buildings, where con-
struction characteristics are well known, the simulated energy
demands and real consumption can differ signiﬁcantly [6].
Regarding existing buildings, a successful method is to use
well-calibrated statistical models, for which aggregated results
match monitored data quite well [7]. Nevertheless, more
detailed data sources exist: cadaster and building geometry
data, building registers, monitored consumption data, other
geographical information system (GIS) data, etc. Together with
the development of decentralised energy production systems
and the need for more localised information, this supports
the development of disaggregated urban energy simulation
models [8]. An interesting veriﬁcation study at this level was
performed on a 700-building area in Germany [9], evidencing
an average dispersion between simulated and monitored con-
sumption of individual buildings above 30%, while the overall
annual consumption was reasonably well estimated.
Two factors explain the difﬁculty to simulate individual
buildings at a large scale: the limited level of detail of data
available for such simulation, and the stochastic behaviour of
occupants. Nevertheless, acknowledging our inability to model
all parameters does not decrease the beneﬁts of using all
available data: a disaggregated model making an intelligent
use of default or standard data to mitigate unavailable data has
the potential to provide better results than statistical models,
without limiting possible improvements of the model. The
calibration of the model and veriﬁcation of default values,
which is the primary focus of this article, is however of
uttermost importance.
As discussed in [10], the amount of data (whether real or
default) involved in this kind of study, as well as its quality and
longevity are important concerns. However, few publications in
the domain tackle this problem. The MEU platform presented
in this study was developed with this concern in mind. It was
designed to provide the simulation functionalities necessary for
the energy management of urban zones, accounting for both
demand and supply sides, whilst addressing some of the data
concerns related to this domain.

METHODOLOGY
The simulations presented here were performed with the
MEU platform, an urban energy management tool developed
these last four years through a collaboration between research
units, energy utilities and municipalities. Not just an energy
demand simulation tool, the MEU platform intends to manage
energy-related data in an adapted data model, represent the
demand and supply energy picture, offer a structure for a
combined use of monitored data and simulation tools, and
integrate standard analysis functionalities.

Example graph representation of the energy ﬂow providing a
building’s energy services.
A. Energy system model
The MEU platform models the urban energy ﬂow as an
oriented graph, with the following rules: source nodes (in a
broad sense) are linked to (i.e., provide energy to) energy
conversion system (ECS) nodes or network nodes. The network
nodes themselves are linked to other network or ECS nodes,
and the ECS nodes in turn are linked to other ECS nodes or
building nodes, seen as energy sink nodes (Figure 1).
This graph approach was chosen for two main reasons:
without it, even simple situations where a building’s domes-
tic hot water (DHW) is provided by solar thermal panels
completed with an electrical boiler while space heating is
supplied by an oil boiler soon become very complicated to
model. Furthermore, the intent to consider monitored data
highlights its natural attribution to ECS instead of buildings: a
gas consumption usually corresponds to a gas boiler, whether
this boiler provides only one energy service in one building
or several services in a group of buildings. In the MEU graph
model, monitored energy consumptions can be attributed to
any ECS node as its input ﬂow.
Energy demands for space heating, DHW, electricity and
cooling services are associated to each building node. An
arbitrary number of connections link each of these demands
with the ECS nodes supplying them. Each connection records
information about which fraction of the demand is supplied
through this connection.
The source nodes actually represent energy in any form that
does not need to be investigated further: it can be natural
gas as delivered in the country, or a pre-deﬁned standard
electricity mix. These nodes are deﬁned along with their name
by environmental factors, such as a kWh primary energy per
kWh coefﬁcient and a kg CO2,eq per kWh coefﬁcient, based
on the EcoInvent database [11], which intend to unite such
sustainability data in one coherent data bank.
Network nodes are mainly characterised by a loss factor,
whereas ECS nodes refer to a dedicated black-box simula-
tion model including any number of modiﬁable parameters.
Building nodes include data about address, location (footprint),
allocation and a physical model used for the estimation of
heating and cooling demand with the simulation program
CitySim presented below. Electricity and DHW needs are
estimated using Swiss norms [12], based on main allocation
and treated ﬂoor area.
B. Energy ﬂow simulation
The simulation process consists of three main steps:
261

•
The whole annual energy ﬂows are ﬁrst estimated,
creating a complete but fully-simulated energy ﬂow
picture. The energy service demands of each building
are simulated by a dedicated module: the CitySim web
service. The graph model structure then ensures sufﬁ-
cient information is available to resolve the energy ﬂow
providing those demands. The ECS nodes losses are
simulated using the corresponding black-box models,
offering ﬂexibility regarding the available ECS models.
•
The simulated energy ﬂow picture is then adapted
(scaled) to match the monitored consumption values
available. The intent is to create an energy ﬂow picture
as close to reality as possible, by combining the incom-
plete information of monitored data with the structuring
simulation results. Both original simulated values and
subsequently adapted values are saved for later analyses.
•
The last step consists in retrieving usually required
results from the fully-informed energy ﬂow picture,
including building-based values of primary, ﬁnal (de-
livered) and useful energy use per service (as deﬁned
in [13]). The results produced also include map repre-
sentations of the relative energy efﬁciency of buildings,
as well as overall results, such as the relative shares
of energy carrier used or the renewable fraction of the
primary energy consumed.
The ﬁrst results presented in [1] conﬁrmed that the approach
described above could correctly represent urban energy ﬂow.
The test scene included several cases of centralised ECS
providing space heating and / or DHW in different buildings,
buildings where space heating is produced by both the district
heating network and a gas boiler (in order to free power on
the district heating network during heavy load periods), and
electricity meters providing both the electricity demand and an
electrical boiler, which were correctly simulated by the MEU
platform.
On top of the pre-computed results, the energy ﬂow picture
obtained contains a large amount of information that can be
accessed to perform more detailed analyses. In particular, the
co-existence of the simulated and adapted values provides a
valuable tool for the analysis of the validity of the model. We
will consider the discrepancy of those two values at the level
of the buildings’ energy demands, using a discrepancy factor
f2 deﬁned as the logarithm in base 2 of their ratio:
f2 = log2
simulated value
adapted value

(1)
The choice of this indicator comes from two observations:
ﬁrstly, when dealing with a large number of buildings, the
meaning of a particular monitored consumption value is often
uncertain, i.e., it is not always well deﬁned which services
and buildings are concerned. As such, using the monitored
values as reference was not deemed a reliable method, no
more than using the simulated values as reference. Secondly,
using the percentage of deviation from a reference value has
the drawback of not being a symmetrical indicator: a 50%
result can be considered as an equivalent error to a 200%
result. The use of the f2 factor avoids such problems with

symmetric values around zero (which corresponds to a perfect
match). An f2 value of -1 corresponds to a simulated value
twice smaller than the adapted value, and an f2 value of 1
corresponds to a simulated value two times higher than the
adapted value, without any hypothesis regarding which is more
reliable. A map representation of this indicator is also very
useful to quickly spot locations where simulated values and
monitored data do not match, in order to verify and correct
the underlying model.
C. The MEU platform
The MEU simulation framework was implemented as a web-
based platform with decentralised web services (Figure 2). A
GIS-based web interface provides access and editing function-
alities to the model through a map representation (Figure 3).
It also grants access to the simulation results, in the form of
map representations as well as numerical results, for individual
buildings or aggregated for the whole scene.
The data is stored in a spatio-temporal PostgreSQL (open-
source) database and can also be accessed directly. The si-
mulation of the energy ﬂow is implemented in the dedicated
MEU web service. During the simulation process the MEU
web service connects to the database to retrieve the necessary
input data and later to save results, calls the CitySim web
service for the estimation of energy demands, and uses the
“technology models” module to simulates the production of
an ECS based on its consumption or vice-versa.
D. CitySim
The urban energy use simulator CitySim [14] was developed
at EPFL based on multiple physical models coupled together.
Its simulation results have been compared against ESP-r,
EnergyPlus and the European norm CEN 13790, demonstrating
similar results [14]–[16]. The veriﬁcation study presented here
concerns to a large extent the simulation of heating needs by
the CitySim web service, which is described in some detail.
CitySim can compute an estimation of the on-site energy
use for heating, cooling and lighting with an hourly time step.
A radiation model ﬁrst computes the irradiation incident on

each surface of the scene, direct from the sun, diffuse from the
sky and reﬂected by other surfaces. The results of this model,
together with predictions of long-wave radiation exchange, are
input to a thermal model. This model determines the thermal
exchange through building envelopes and computes the heating
and cooling energy needs to maintain predeﬁned temperature
conditions inside. Finally, ECS providing heating, cooling and
electricity can also be deﬁned.
As input, a complete physical description of the scene
as well as climatic data are needed for the simulation. The
climatic data includes hourly temperature, wind and irradi-
ance values, together with the geographic coordinates and
the deﬁnition of far ﬁeld obstructions (which is used by the
radiation model). The building models describe the envelope
of each building (the thermal properties of each facade, the
layered composition of the walls with thermal inertia and
transmittance properties, the proportions of window openings
and the physical properties of the glazing) as well as the
inﬁltration rate and the presence of occupants and heat gains.
CitySim is used in the MEU platform to compute heating
and cooling demands only. It was transformed for this purpose
into a web service, also including the estimation of electricity
and DHW annual demands based on the SIA norms [12].
The central MEU web service prepares the input model based
on the data available in the database, calls the CitySim web
service and retrieves the simulated energy demands to save
them in the database.
IV.
CASE STUDY MODEL
The veriﬁcation study considers three case study urban
areas, located in the Swiss cities of Neuchˆatel, La Chaux-de-
Fonds and Martigny. Still in its veriﬁcation phase, the platform
has, to date, not been used in other countries. This section
describes the data sources used to create the models, and gives
some speciﬁc insights on each of the urban zones. The default
data chosen to complete these models is discussed in the next
section.
A. Data sources
The models created for this project are based on cadastral
data deﬁning buildings’ footprints, and possibly their type
(allocation). The footprints are combined with data from the
national building register including the address, period of
construction, number of ﬂoors and optionally space heating
and DHW supply systems. These were completed with a large
amount of default data to form the physical model of the
building (see Section IV-C).
The monitored consumption of electricity, gas and heat from
the district heating network (DHN) were obtained through
the local energy providers. Part of the fuel oil (supplied by
various companies) consumption values were provided by the
cities, based on contacts with building owners. The model is
completed with locally measured meteorological data for the
year corresponding to monitored consumption data.
The concerned municipalities’ help permitted to slightly
simplify the collection of data. Nevertheless, the combination
of the various sources into a coherent model remained a time-
consuming task, accounting for several weeks of work for each
case-study model.
B. Case study urban zones
The three cities are located in the western part of Switzer-
land, but cover quite different climatic conditions. Figure 4
shows the buildings’ footprints and their construction period.

Maps of the three case study areas, showing the buildings’ construction period (colours available online).
1) La Chaux-de-Fonds (CdF): Located in the Jura sub-
alpine mountain range, La Chaux-de-Fonds (alt. 1000m) is a
UNESCO World Heritage Site for its watchmaking industry-
driven urbanism mixing housing and workshop at the heart of
the city. The case study area covers the main part of the city
center and is composed of 600 buildings. It includes mostly
multi-family houses and industrial or workshop buildings,
heated through a district heating network (DHN), gas or oil.
The model was up to some extent veriﬁed with the help of
the energy ofﬁce and energy supplier of La Chaux-de-Fonds,
producing the highest conﬁdence level case study model.
Energy consumption data for the year 2011 (3853 degree-
days1) was provided for electricity, gas and the DHN as well
as for oil, although part of this data was extrapolated from
other years.
2) Neuchˆatel (Nch):
Neuchˆatel is located in the Swiss
plateau, between the Alp and the Jura mountains. The case
study area is a part of the city center, covering a slope between
a lake and the ﬁrst shoulders of Jura (alt. 430m-500m), and
composed of approx. 400 single-family houses, multi-family
houses, commercial buildings and other types of buildings.
This most heterogeneous case study area is also heated with
gas, oil and DHN.
Digital surface and terrain models (DSM and DTM) were

available for the creation of the model, providing individual
building’s average altitude and height. The model was less
intensively checked than that of CdF, but can rely on monitored
gas and DHN consumption data for the year 2008 (3166 DD).
3) Martigny (Mrt): Martigny (470m) is located in the Rhone
valley in the western part of the Alps range; the case study area
is a very compact housing neighbourhood of approximately
200 buildings west of the city center. Unlike the two other
case study areas, a large share of the buildings are heated
with electricity, the others using mostly oil or gas. Monitored
consumption values are available for 2010 (3116 DD). The
model is however the least veriﬁed, and an unknown part of
the buildings might use a wood stove for complementary space
heating. The case study was still included in our analysis for
representativeness, although the results obtained with it were
considered with a lower weight.
C. Default data
As mentioned above, in order to obtain a microsimulation
model at this scale of a few hundred buildings, numerous
default values and rules were used. Only a very limited amount
of data was considered as compulsory to create the case study
models: the buildings’ footprint, period of construction, main
allocation (type) and number of ﬂoors (although the use of
more available data was always possible).
For this veriﬁcation study, default values were ﬁrst chosen
based on the information available to us, through published

work as well as surveys or informal knowledge transmission.
Given the limited available knowledge regarding the existing
building stock’s physical properties and energy supply situa-
tion, the ﬁrst version (Version 1) of the model was not expected
to provide a good match with monitored data, but rather a basis
for the deﬁnition of more adapted but still realistic default
values. The objective of such a crude model is not to obtain
precise individual building energy demands, but representative
average results.
Regarding the simulation of energy demand, energy con-
sumption studies show that the most inﬂuent parameters are
the dimensions of the building, its age and its type (alloca-
tion) [17], [18]. The dimensions of the buildings are obtained
through their footprints and number of ﬂoors. The default
values are thus attributed based on the buildings’ period of
construction and type. Sensitivity analyses performed with
CitySim, in accordance with [19], show that after dimension-
related parameters, the most inﬂuent parameters for the si-
mulation of heating loads are the set point temperature, the
ventilation rate and the insulation thickness (or more generally
the outer surfaces’ properties), followed by internal heat gains
and climatic conditions.
The closest measured climatic data was obtained through
a national database. Swiss norms recommend the use of
a heating set point temperature of 21 ˚C for housing and
administrative buildings’ thermal simulations. This important
parameter can vary considerably depending on the occupants
preferences, but cannot be reﬁned based on the data available
to us. Together with electricity and DHW needs, internal heat
gains are estimated based on norms.
As for dimension-related parameters, the simulation uses
a 3D ﬂat-roof model based on the cadastral footprint of the
buildings and their number of ﬂoors. The fractions of fac¸ades
that are shared between heated buildings are considered to
be adiabatic. The DSM and DTM data of Neuchˆatel’s case
study corresponds to an average height of 2.73 m per ﬂoor
as recorded in the register of building. This value is used to
estimate the unknown heights of buildings, while a treated ﬂoor
area to footprint ratio of 0.8 per ﬂoor is assumed. The heated
volume is further estimated considering 20 cm thick slabs and
10% of the volume occupied by furnitures.
The ventilation rate and construction properties are more
uncertain and will thus be the focus of our analysis. The
ventilation rate parameter represents the building’s air volume
change per hour in usual conditions. It strongly depends on
the air-tightness of the envelope, the existence of an HVAC

(heating, ventilation and air conditioning) system and the
occupants’ stochastic behaviour regarding ventilation (win-
dow opening to avoid overheating is considered separately in
CitySim simulations). Although one of the most inﬂuential
parameters for the simulation, it is thus one of the least
accessible. Studies on the air tightness of buildings present
a large range of results, corresponding to inﬁltration rates
ranging from 0.1 to 1 h−1 [20]–[22]. We thus chose default
values for the ventilation rates based on two considerations:
most studies show that the inﬁltration rate of older buildings
is 2 to 4 times higher than that of more recent buildings, and
Swiss norms recommend a minimum total ventilation rate of
0.3 h−1 for comfort and health purposes. The original default
values are shown in the “Version 1” part of Table I (the
versions 2 and 3 are discussed further on).
Regarding the physical properties of the envelope, the con-
struction default parameters must represent the average state of
all buildings of each construction period, as the available data
does not include information about past thermal retroﬁtting
of buildings. Further, the unknown existence of non-heated
attics or cellars complicates the estimation of their thermal
resistance (ground K-value and roof U-value). Nevertheless,
a ﬁrst version of default values was based on typical period-
speciﬁc construction characteristics determined with the help
of experimented local architects, and are also shown in Table I.
Windows ratio, U-value and g-value, estimated based on a
visual survey of approximately 500 buildings in Z¨urich, are
shown shown in Table II. The calculated U-value and g-value
also depend on the hypotheses made regarding the typical
glazing properties.
Considering the supply side, wherever monitored consump-
tions of gas, fuel oil or district heating are available, gas
boilers, fuel oil boilers and heat exchangers respectively are
deﬁned in the corresponding buildings. It is assumed that these
produce space heating, as well as DHW if the building register
announced the same energy carrier for both services. The

method showed its limits as numerous buildings of Neuchˆatel
appear to use gas only for cooking, their consumption being
clearly incompatible with either space heating or DHW de-
mands.
The lower conﬁdence data of the building register was
used to complete the supply picture with other ECS for both
space heating and DHW when information was available for
buildings without consumption data. At this point, using maps
of the f2 factor, buildings without monitored data for heating
that are semi-detached from buildings with a high consumption
value were considered to be heated by the same centralised
ECS and thus connected to that ECS. Fuel oil boilers were
eventually deﬁned in buildings without any other ECS.
An electricity meter providing electrical services was also
deﬁned in each building, and associated with the electricity
consumption obtained through the energy provider. The elec-
tricity consumption of electrical boilers was assumed to be
included in the total monitored electricity consumption.
The technology models used to simulate the ECS are quite
simple and use the default efﬁciencies shown in Table III,
based on the Swiss norm SIA 2031 [23]. When two or more
ECS are deﬁned to provide the same service, it is supposed
that each meets the same share of the demand, except for solar
thermal panels that are often sized to provide approximately
65% of the annual DHW demand. These default shares can be
adapted during the simulation based on the monitored data.
V.
DEFAULT DATA CALIBRATION AND MODEL
VERIFICATION
The calibration and veriﬁcation of the model focused on
the housing and administrative buildings, which seem the
most predictable building types. Other types of buildings are
expected to have more varying energy demands, which are
barely correlated to the rough data at our disposal. The limited
number of such buildings in our case studies also limits the
possibilities to perform statistically relevant analyses.
Each case study model was simulated with the MEU plat-
form, ﬁrst using the Version 1 default values. This section
analyses the results using the f2 factor. Representing the
discrepancy between simulated values and monitored data,
it provides insights regarding the default values’ adequacy
as well as indications on other possible model errors. Two
improved default values versions were then deﬁned, simulated
and analysed.
A. Version 1 simulations
Most of the least reliable default values concern the space
heating demand simulation and are attributed based on the

construction period. The logarithmic discrepancy factor f2 for
the heating demand is plotted against those periods in Figure 5
for all housing or administrative buildings of each case study.
First of all, it must be noted that the largest proportion of
buildings in our case studies were built before 1960 (Table IV);
the results concerning more recent buildings are less reliable
as a result of their limited number. The dispersion of the
discrepancy factor is quite high, with a few buildings for which
the simulated value was more than 4 times smaller or 16 times
greater than the monitored value. However, the interquartile
range is between 1 and 2 units of the f2 factor’s scale, which
corresponds to ratios of 1:2 to 1:4.
More interesting at this stage is the average value of the
f2 factor, showing that our model globally overestimated the
space heating demand of older buildings and underestimated
that of more recent constructions. In other words, the thermal
efﬁciency of old buildings was underestimated, while that of
recent buildings was overestimated. Surprisingly, the energy
use per square meter for heating, represented in Figure 12 and
discussed later in Section VI, does not evidence a decrease
of the energy consumption with time, except for buildings
built after 2000. This goes against our ﬁrst choice of default
values, which supposed a decreasing thermal efﬁciency for old
buildings.
In the case of Mrt, either the heating demand was even more
generally overestimated, or the monitored consumption values
used for the comparison are too low, which would be coherent
with the existence of a non-negligible number of unmodeled
wood stoves, the consumption of which could not be taken
into account.
B. Version 2 simulations
Based on the previous observations, a second set of default
values (Version 2) was deﬁned. The life-time of windows being
considerably lower than that of buildings, it was estimated that

the quality of glazing and frame materials was more uniform
than previously estimated (Table II). The overall quality of the
envelope was revised, based on the hypothesis that the simplest
insulation measures for old buildings, and thus the most likely
to be widespread, concern primarily the roof and ground. The
ventilation rate of old buildings was also reduced, keeping in
mind the following remarks:
•
To our knowledge, no study regarding air-tightness or
ventilation rates of Swiss buildings is available.
•
Measurements usually concern the air-tightness of the
envelope; the estimation of an average ventilation rate
based on those measurements still involves numerous
hypotheses (among other regarding wind conditions) that
were not taken into account in this work.
•
For very leaky buildings, improving the air tightness
is possibly easier to accomplish than other energy-
efﬁciency measures.
Conversely, the overall quality of more recent buildings was
slightly reduced, among other by diminishing the estimated
insulation thickness.
The results of the second simulation, shown in Figure 6,
slightly improved the match between simulated and monitored
values, but the trends observed in the ﬁrst simulation remain.
At this point, the correlation between the discrepancy factor
and the technology used for heating was also investigated, but
no signiﬁcant trend could be observed (Figure 7). Nevertheless,

and although information regarding the average efﬁciency
of existing energy conversion systems is very scarce, the
default efﬁciencies of the heat exchangers, oil boilers and
gas boilers were modiﬁed the Version 3 to better represent
the average quality of installed ECS. Regarding the DHN,
according to a local specialist heat exchanger efﬁciencies are
currently of the order of 99%. This value was only slightly
decreased to 97% to account for heat losses after the heat
exchanger. Losses occurring during heat production and in
the distribution network are considered elsewhere, i.e., at the
corresponding nodes in the graph model, and were also set
according to the local energy provider’s data. By contrast, the
original hypotheses regarding gas and oil boilers efﬁciencies
were probably too optimistic, as they correspond to values
given by the norm [23] for correctly sized condensing boilers.
Regarding conventional boilers, the norm proposes an annual
efﬁciency of 80%, and less in case of bad sizing. An ofﬁcial
document regarding the sizing of boilers also mentions typical
annual efﬁciencies of 70 to 85% [24]. Globally, the overall
space heat production efﬁciency in Switzerland is estimated
at 78% by [25]. Moreover, the efﬁciencies are traditionally
computed based on the lower caloriﬁc value of the substance
in Europe [26] (the convention used by the documents cited
above is unspeciﬁed), while the efﬁciencies considered in
our simulation refer to the higher caloriﬁc value. Finally, the
efﬁciencies used in two large scale studies of Swiss energy
consumption [27] [28], once converted to refer to the higher
caloriﬁc value based on [29], are reproduced in Table V. Based
on these observations, the default efﬁciencies of the main
technologies were adapted in the third version to the values
presented in Table III.

C. Version 3 simulations
In addition to the ECS efﬁciencies modiﬁcations, the de-
fault properties of buildings were also adapted again, with
the overall same hypotheses as before regarding pre-1960
constructions. For more recent constructions, the envelope’s
quality was lowered again, but most importantly the ventilation
rate was substantially increased. We thus make the hypothesis
that the usual ventilation habits clearly exceed the minimal
recommended ventilation rate of 0.3 h−1.
The simulation of all case studies with the third version of
default values leads to the discrepancy factor for space heating
showed in Figure 8. This third version intends to represent the
most equilibrate hypotheses that can be made regarding the
unknown parameters of our simulation, based on the available
information and monitored data. A more reﬁned calibration of
the model for buildings built after 1960 would require a larger
number of buildings to be relevant.
With this better calibrated space heating energy demand
simulation, the f2 factors for the DHW and electricity demands
were also investigated. Both energy demands are estimated
based on the building type; Figure 9 shows the f2 factor
per type for all services. The average electricity and DHW
consumption of housing and administrative buildings was quite
well estimated by the simulation based on norms, while other
building types show, as expected, much less predictable trends.
VI.
DISCUSSION
Considering the case studies of CdF and Nch only, half of
the housing and administrative buildings’ f2 value for space
heating is comprised in the interval (-0.40, 0.43), meaning
that the simulated heating demand of half the buildings was
comprised between 76% and 132% of the monitored values.
This can be considered as a good result for such a crude
model, although the results for individual buildings cannot
be trusted. The quality of the results for DHW is similar,
while the interquartile range for electricity is (-0.30, 0.45).

Discrepancy factor for the space heating, DHW and electricity
services demands as a function of the building type in the version 3 simula-

by the same ECS in most buildings. Allocation types: 1 apartment building,
2 individual home, 3 administrative, 4 schools, 5 sales, 6 catering, 7 meeting
venues, 8 hospital, 9 industries, 10 warehouses, 11 sports installations, 12

The simulation of other building types is much less reliable,
and the results of the case study of Martigny remain uncertain.
The origin of the remaining discrepancies are numerous,
but difﬁcult to take into account. The space heating demand
of individual homes is slightly overestimated when compared
to apartment buildings, although the available data is not con-
clusive. Otherwise, the f2 factor did not exhibit any signiﬁcant
correlation with the other available parameters that were tested

(treated ﬂoor area, form factor, number of ﬂoors).
Among the inaccessible factors, the stochastic inﬂuence
of occupants behaviour is known to be of high importance,
practically limiting the precision of the results even with a
very well calibrated physical model. However, numerous other
sources of imprecision are known, in particular regarding space
heating demand simulation:
•
Many uncertainties regarding the correct attribution of
monitored data remain. Visual representations of the f2
factor help to spot likely errors, but more information
is often needed to resolve them. For instance, adjacent
buildings with high and opposed f2 factor hints for a
shared use of the energy consumption, but this often
cannot be conﬁrmed without on-site surveys.
•
The existence of other ECS such as solar thermal panels
and wood stoves is usually not documented and could
not be assessed for this study. Aerial photography might
prove to be a valuable source for the localisation of solar
technologies, whereas the location of other technologies
might remain very hard to assess without extensive
surveys.
•
The cadastral footprint of buildings used for the cre-
ation of the 3D model does not always represent the
simulation relevant part of the building: some have been
found to include adjacent garages, while buildings with
a complex shape are simpliﬁed to the point where the 3D
model and treated ﬂoor area estimation might not have
any relevance at all. The use of the correct roof shape
(instead of the simpliﬁed ﬂat-roof model currently used)
could also improve the simulation results’ quality.
•
The unknown refurbishment status of buildings is likely
to account for an important part of the dispersion of the
f2 factor for all but the most recent buildings.
•
Construction techniques are quite variable even for the
same period, and further might depend on the region,
although the difference between the three case studies
simulated here with the same default values are not
conclusive in this regard. The case study of Mrt, where
a better thermal efﬁciency of buildings could be hypoth-
esised based on the f2 factor, is actually supposed to be
a quite low energy efﬁciency neighbourhood.
Any attempt to further improve the calibration of the model
without ﬁrst addressing these uncertainties would not be perti-
nent. However, as the creation of models at this urban scale is
likely to often suffer of the same limitations, it is interesting to
document the precision of such models. The results obtained
for buildings with monitored energy consumption also help to
evaluate the reliability of the simulation on other buildings.
The simulated and adapted total space heating demands
are shown in Figure 10, conﬁrming for the case study of
Mrt that either the space heating demand is overestimated,
or the related consumption is underestimated. CdF and Nch
total space heating demands are underestimated by 15.5% and
10.4%, although their average f2 factors correspond respec-
tively to a 5% underestimation and a 13% overestimation.
Figure 11 shows that the highest space heating demands are
indeed most frequently underestimated, and have an order of
magnitude close to the difference between the total simulated

and monitored values. Unlike regular statistical variations, the
unpredictable demands of a few big energy consumers can thus
have a strong impact on the overall results.
Plotting the ﬁnal energy use for heating versus the construc-
tion period of the buildings (Figure 12) does not reveals a clear
decrease with time, except for the most recent buildings (built
after 2000). All case studies present more or less the same
trend, with only a marginal number of old buildings showing
a clearly higher energy consumption for heating. The three
partner cities have been promoting energy efﬁciency for some
time and have all obtained labels in this domain [30]; never-
theless, Martigny’s case study zone in particular is considered
to have quite a low energy efﬁciency. On the other hand, the
small number of recent buildings and possible errors in their
modelling might have created a bias, which would require a
broader study to be correctly explored.

simulation performed by the MEU platform. The platform
intends to provide a ﬂexible tool for the energy management
at the scale of a neighbourhood, based on the limited available
data sources and providing default values to supplement their
low level of detail. The platform’s combined management of
simulation results and monitored data proved to be a powerful
tool both to improve the model’s quality and to perform
veriﬁcation studies.
The validity of the results at the scale of individual buildings
was explored in detail, focusing on the housing and administra-
tive buildings. The correct simulation of average buildings was
demonstrated, while individual results remain, as expected,
less reliable. The remaining discrepancies between simulated
and monitored values can be attributed to the inﬂuence of the
stochastic behaviour of occupants, but also to the limitations
of the model regarding, among others, the attribution of mon-
itored values, the unknown refurbishment status, the possible
existence of other ECS, and the crude 3D model used for the
simulation. Nevertheless, this study’s results will already help
improve the platform’s reliability.
The aggregated results at the scale of a few hundred
buildings shows that the total space heating demand is un-
derestimated by 10% to 16% by the simulation for the two
reliable case studies. This result highlights that a better match
at the level of individual buildings does not necessarily yield
a correct aggregated value, as some unpredictable high energy
consumers can have an important impact. The possibility to
simulate other buildings types with a satisfactory accuracy
based on similarly low level-of-detail data remains to explore.
The research of realistic default values leads to new hypothe-
ses regarding what can be considered as standard ventilation
rates or as typical construction properties, but the lack of
knowledge in this area makes the veriﬁcation of those hypothe-
ses difﬁcult. A large scale but detailed assessment of existing
buildings’ physical properties would thus be a contribution of
great value for the simulation of buildings’ energy demand
and for studies regarding the potential of energy-efﬁciency
measures.
Finally, this study also evidenced interesting results regard-
ing the energy use of our three case study areas. The most
surprising observation is the low difference in energy con-
sumption for space heating among buildings built before 2000.
Note however that the individual renovation status of buildings
is not known, and thus the role of recent refurbishments cannot
be assessed. An analysis on a larger number of buildings
built after 1960 would also be necessary to conﬁrm the trends
observed here.
