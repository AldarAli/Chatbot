Abstract—The nonlinearity magnetization characteristics of 
the rotor material is a problem in the analysis of eddy current 
retarders (ECR) because the typical operating conditions of 
ECRs require high supplied currents. In order to address the 
nonlinearity of the rotor material, a proper method is needed. 
In this paper, we propose a process to express the effective 
magnetic flux considering the nonlinear magnetization 
characteristics of the ferromagnetic materials used in ECRs. 
Using a numerical iterative scheme to deal with nonlinear 
magnetization characteristics, we explain why the torque tends 
to increase less with higher supplied currents. Using the 
nonlinear analysis model, we discuss the effects of several 
design parameters on the torque-speed behavior in order to 
determine the parameters that are most important for torque-
speed performance. 
Keywords-Eddy current retarder, Nonlinear magnetization 
characteristics, Magnetic saturation, Numerical analysis, Copper

 INTRODUCTION 
With stricter safety regulations being imposed on large 
vehicles, there is an increasing demand for velocity retarders, 
which assist the primary friction brakes. In fact, the use of 
retarders for heavy-duty vehicles is a growing trend in Japan, 
Australia, Europe, and North America. Among several types 
of retarders, ECRs are preferred owing to their fast response 
time and the small installation space they require.  
ECRs are classified into linear types, drum types, and 
disk types, depending on their rotor shapes, and into 
permanent magnet types and electromagnet types, depending 
on their flux supply sources. For permanent-type ECRs, the 
path of the magnetic flux through the rotor is controlled by 
mechanically moving the magnets, which alters the polarity 
between adjacent magnets. Although this type of retarder 
requires no external power source, it is mechanically 
complex and suffers from off-state leakage flux [1]. 
Electromagnet-type ECRs, on the other hand, in which the 
magnetic flux is controlled by a coil current, are 
mechanically simple and free from flux leakage. 
The approach to analyze an ECR can be classified into 
Finite Element Method (FEM) [2-4] and analytical method 
[5-10]. Research on ECRs by FEM has mostly been 
conducted on industrial applications with high torques.  Jang 
analyzed a linear-type ECR with a permanent magnet array 
using [2]. Choi discussed an optimum method for managing 
a Halbach array using FEM, as well for linear rotor-type 
ECRs [3]. For a drum-type ECR with permanent magnets, 
Alvaro took into consideration the thermal effect [4]. The 
merit of FEM analysis is the accuracy of its solution. 
However, the downside of FEM is a long computation time 
for even moderately complex geometry. 
Without recourse to FEM analysis, analytical methods 
have been utilized to model the eddy current distribution and 
retarding torque of ECRs. The advantage of analytical 
methods over FEM is the reduced computation time and 
increased understanding of physical principles underlying the 
ECR. Smythe studied the effects of an induced magnetic flux 
on the retarding behavior [5]. Schieber analyzed the 
distribution of eddy currents in the vicinity of pole arrays 
using the magnetic vector potential [6]. By assuming 
constant power dissipation for all speed regions, Wouterse 
showed that the retarding force can be described in terms of 
the air gap and pole diameter [7]. Lee proposed a model by 
using an image charge method for a disk-type ECR [8]. A 
representative analytical model was proposed by Davies, 
who derived the torque equation from a diffusion equation of 
the eddy current density in a three-dimensional Cartesian 
coordinate system [9]. By applying the energy conservation, 
Malti derived a torque equation in three-dimensional 
cylindrical coordinates [10].  
However, the problem of the analytical approaches is that 
an enormous deviation of the theoretical from the 
experimental result is produced when a high current is 
applied to the electromagnets of the ECR. The discrepancy is 
due to the fact that the magnetic flux density does not 
increase linearly with the coil current. The approach in this 
paper to address this difficulty is to find the effective 
magnetic density by calculating iteratively using the 
magnetization data of the rotor material.  
Section II is devoted to explanation on the configuration 
of a drum-type ECR. The analytical procedure combined 
with iteration method is explained in Section III through V. 
In Section III, the eddy current density equation is derived. 
Section IV is divided by two parts. In Part A, the magnetic 
circuit is utilized to obtain an expression for the effective 
magnetic flux density. Part B explains the iteration steps to 
compute the effective magnetic flux. After that, Section V 
derives the torque equation by applying the Lorentz force 
formula. In result and discussion, the analytical and

experimental results are compared, and the effects of some 
design variables on the torque-speed characteristics are 
evaluated. 
II. 
CONFIGURATION AND PRINCIPLE OF A DRUM-TYPE 
ECR 
 Fig. 1 shows the structure and actual shape of the rotor 
and stator for the drum-type ECR that was studied in the 
present work. As shown in Fig. 2, the ECR is mounted at the 
end of a propeller shaft in a vehicle. 
Figure 1.  Configuration of drum-type ECR. 
Figure 2.   ECR mounted in a vehicle. 
A pair of electromagnets was used to supply the magnetic 
flux in the radial direction through the rotor. Nine pairs of 
electromagnets were used to produce a peak torque of 800 
N·m at a maximum current. The fins on the outer surface of 
the rotor dissipated the heat generated by the eddy current. 
The torque is controlled by varying the amount of coil 
current supplied from the retarder controller. A maximum 
current of 72 A can be supplied to 18 electromagnets.  
The eddy current generated in the moving rotor and the 
applied magnetic flux interact to produce a force that 
opposed the direction of rotation, attributed to Faraday’s law. 
In the next session, the physical model of an ECR is 
developed based on fundamental electromagnetic equations. 
III. 
DERIVATION OF EDDY CURRENTS IN THE ROTOR 
Table 1 lists the definitions of the design parameters and 
material properties. Fig. 3 shows the front, side, and 
isometric views of one pair of the electromagnets and the 
corresponding portion of the rotor. The rotor is usually made 
of steel to ensure its high stiffness. The surface of the rotor is 
coated with copper in order to generate a large amount of 
eddy current, because copper has a higher conductivity than 
steel. In this work, the permeability and conductivities of the 
steel and copper are considered separately in order to analyze 
the effect of the copper coating thickness on the generation 
of the eddy current.

Given that ˆ
Bmn
 is obtained by (19), 
ey
B  is also obtained 
by (8). 
In practice, however, R  is not analytically determined 
because the steel that composes the rotor and the stator 
exhibits a nonlinear magnetization characteristic for a flux 
density of around 1.5 T, as shown in Fig. 7. This means that 
ˆ
Bmn
 cannot be analytically by (19), in which a linear 
magnetization characteristic is assumed. To address this 
difficulty, we solve (16) and (21) simultaneously, with the 
help of the numerical method given in the following 
description. 
• 
We assume an initial value for ˆ
Bmn
. From this value, 
Fiy
 
and
 
Fey
 
are obtained using (14) and (15).

RETARDING TORQUE OF THE ECR 
Fig. 8 shows the infinitesimally small volume in which 
Bey
 and 
zJ  interact. The Lorentz force 
x
F  is obtained via 
the cross product of 
z
ey
J
× B
. The eddy current retarding 
torque T  is calculated by integrating the cross product of 
xF  
and the distance from the center to the point of action

over the entire rotor volume. Therefore, the total retarding 
torque is a summation of the torque generated at copper, 
Tcopper
, and the torque generated at steel, 
Tsteel
, as follows:

RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
A. Experimental setup 
Fig. 9 shows the experimental setup used for the eddy 
current 
retarding 
torque 
experiments. 
An 
engine 
dynamometer was used to supply the rotational velocity and 
to measure the retarding torque. A coil current was applied to 
the retarder from a power supply by a command from a 
computer, and the retarding torque was recorded in the 
computer. The rotational velocity was increased from 200 
rpm to 1000 rpm. The supplied current was increased from 1 
A to 4 A, making a total of 18 A to 72 A when multiplied by 
the number of poles. In order to exclude the effect of the 
thermal heat generated at the rotor, the rotor was cooled for 
more than 30 min. A total of 24 experiments were performed.

B. Comparison between the experimental and theoretical 
results with the consideration of nonlinear 
magnetization characteristics of the material 
Fig. 10(a) shows the theoretical and experimental results 
of the torque characteristics of the rotational velocity when 
the magnetization characteristics are assumed to be linear. 
When the applied current is low, the theoretical and 
experimental results agree well. However, when the applied 
current is increased, the real torque is substantially reduced 
as compared to the theoretical torque.  
Fig. 10(b) shows the theoretical and experimental results 
for the torque characteristics of the rotational velocity when 
the magnetization characteristics are nonlinear, since this is 
practical. As can be seen in the figure, the real torque agrees 
well with the theoretical torque in the overall current ranges. 
C. Dependency of torque characteristics on variations in 
the design parameter 
Fig. 11 shows the torque characteristics with respect to 
the copper thickness. As shown in Fig. 11(b), the position of 
the maximum torque varies for different values of d. The 
torque in a high rotating speed region decreases with an 
increase in d. This result indicates that the reduction of the 
magnetic flux from the air gap increases due to increased 
copper thickness is more dominant than the increase in the 
eddy current. When the copper thickness increases, the 
maximum torque is obtained at a low rotational speed.

model. 
Figure 11.  (a) Crosse section of the retarder with copper thickness 
indicated by d and (b) analytical torque curves obtained for I = 4 A when d 
varies by specified values of 30, 50, 100, and 200 µm. 
Figure 12.  (a) Crosse section of the retarder with rotor and pole widths 
specified as L and La, respectively, and (b) analytical torque curves 
obtained for I = 4 A when La/L varies from 0.5 to 1. 
From these results, it can be said that it is important for 
the thickness of the copper coating to be evenly distributed 
over the rotor, since the torque is strongly affected by even a 
slight variation in its thickness.  
Fig. 12 shows how the torque varies with the rotor-width-
to-pole-width ratio. In order to compare only the effect of the 
applied magnetic flux density, the total supplied current and 
the rotor length were assumed to be constant. As shown in 
Fig. 12(b), the torque-speed relationship varies for 
La
L .  
When the pole area is decreased, even though the 
magnetic flux density is increased, the torque decreases 
owing to the reduced area in which the eddy current is 
generated. For the speed region from 1000 rpm to 1500 rpm, 
which is a typical driving condition, the ratio of 0.7 gives a 
maximum torque value.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have proposed a process to express the 
effective magnetic flux in terms of the nonlinear 
magnetization characteristics of ferromagnetic materials, an 
issue that has not been considered in previous analytical 
methods of an ECR. Using a numerical iterative scheme to 
deal with the nonlinear magnetization relationship, we 
explained why the torque does not linearly increase in 
response to higher supplied currents. This result implies that 
the nonlinearity of the material should be adequately 
addressed in the analysis of ECRs. Using the iterative 
analytical model, we discussed the effect of several design 
parameters on the torque-speed behavior. It was discussed 
that the copper thickness and the rotor-width-to-pole-width 
ratio play an important role in determining the torque-speed 
performance.  
For the sake of simple derivation of equations, the rotor 
surface was assumed to be flat. This assumption would be 
appropriate if the rotor diameter is much greater than the 
pole pitch. Further researches on deriving the model based 
on cylindrical coordinates and comparison it with the model 
based on Cartesian coordinates would be beneficial for the 
effect of rotor curvature on the analysis of an ECR.
