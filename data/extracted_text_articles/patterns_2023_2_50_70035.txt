Abstract—The paper discusses the issues related to the use of
machine learning in designing and creating predictive models of
the territorial development of cities. Special attention is paid to
models that use satellite data, which is the most easily accessible
type of data and allows for the use of machine learning. The
proposed provisions are based on the authors’ current experience
in developing an information system for forecasting the territorial
development of cities based on remote sensing data of the
Earth. A novel approach to developing predictive models of
urban growth is presented, which is based on machine learning
methods. The approach uses satellite data from the Defense
Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System
and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite/Day-Night Band
for training. The corresponding machine learning optimization
problem is presented and discussed.
Keywords—Earth remote sensing; urbanization; evolutionary
models of urban development; cellular automata; machine learn-

I. INTRODUCTION
Existing computational models of urban evolution are too
resource-consuming, and the validation of forecasting results
is quite complicated. However, the growing flow of new data,
primarily data from remote sensing of the Earth, enables
the use of the ’Big Data’ approach for both prediction and
validation purposes. Remote sensing data have a high spatial
resolution and global coverage and are collected according to a
common methodology. To learn the model of a particular city
(or agglomeration) development, one can use both historical
data from a given city and data from other “similar” cities.
The parameters of the computational model based on “Big
Data” can be optimized by statistical and machine learning
methods. The quality of the simulation can be evaluated
by training the model on a piece of data. For example, by
training a predictive model of evolution on time series until
2017, you can get the system forecasts for 2018, 2019, and
subsequent years, and compare the forecast provided by the
system with the real territorial development of the city in
these years. A computing system based on such a model can
be used to analyze and refine the city’s development plans
by comparing the development plan of an already developed
city with the forecast of city development created based
on previous development and the geographical characteristics
of the earth’s surface. A comparative analysis of these two
spatiotemporal series of maps – “plans” and “forecasts” – can
indicate possible planning shortcomings and suggest ways to
eliminate them. The information system for forecasting the
territorial development of cities, on which the provisions of
this work will be illustrated, uses a computational model of the
spatiotemporal evolution of cities, developed by the authors.
Machine learning is very demanding on the quality of data, so
in the course of the research, the authors paid great attention
to data preprocessing (for methods of processing satellite data,
see [1]).
Figure 1: On the left – stable night-time lights of Moscow
region in 2008. On the right – an urbanization map that was
created based on these night-time lights.
Based on remote sensing data of the earth’s night surface,
the light footprints of cities are calculated. Night-time remote
sensing data, in turn, allow calculating the so-called urbaniza-
tion maps showing several levels of urbanization for a given
city - the city center, nearby neighborhoods, and so on, a total
of five levels. From these maps over several years, a time series
of urbanization maps for a certain period is compiled.
Figure 1 features the stage of defining the boundaries of the
compact residence of the population at a certain point in time.
The time series of such maps allow for studying the territorial
evolution of the city.
To model the dynamics of changes in this series, it is
necessary to use physical characteristics of the earth’s surface
that hinder or contribute to the development in this area. These
characteristics are extracted from the daytime multispectral
satellite images. Machine learning can be useful at different
stages of the system. For example, machine learning can
be used to process space images to detect and classify the
characteristics of the earth’s surface and objects located on it
(see, for example, [2]). In this work, the authors focus on the
role of machine learning in optimizing model parameters and
evaluating the quality of prediction results.

a forecast works. The top row shows urbanization maps for

Such a forecast can be compared to real urban development to
assess the quality of the forecast and adjust model parameters.
The urban growth model is an important tool for predicting
and managing the expansion of cities. This paper discusses
urban growth prediction using historical satellite data from
the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) / Op-
erational Linescan System (OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging
Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) / Day-Night Band (DNB). Night-
time DMSP and VIIRS data provide high-quality satellite
images that capture the urbanization process over time. A
machine learning optimization problem for the urban growth
model based on the Probabilistic Cellular Automata (PCA)
using historical satellite VIIRS data is also presented. The
PCA is a popular method for modeling urban growth.
In particular, the well-known SLEUTH (slope, land-use, ex-
clusion, urban extent, transportation, and hill shade) approach
is also based on PCA (see [3]). The model was trained and its
parameters were optimized with the help of historical VIIRS
data. Different approaches to the solution of the optimization
problem are also discussed in this paper.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a
short review of the urban growth predictive models based on
machine learning. The authors’ approach to the application
of machine learning methods to urban growth is described
in Section III. Section IV features the comparison of two
predictive systems: the one developed by the authors and
SLEUTH. Section V describes the advantages of the authors’
system. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.
II. URBAN GROWTH PREDICTION AND MACHINE
LEARNING: OUTLINE
Urban growth models can be defined as spatiotemporal
models, which can be generally grouped into three categories:
(1) Cellular Automata (CA), (2) Agent-Based Models (ABM),
and (3) Machine Learning models. Different machine learning
algorithms have been used in the context of urban growth,
including Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Net-
works (ANN), Linear Regression (LN), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forests (RFs), and so on.
In a systematic review of urban growth models in [10], their
evolution, common frameworks, and applications were dis-
cussed. In particular, the review considered Cellular Automata
models, Agent-based models, and Machine Learning models.
In another review [7], it was demonstrated that RFs, Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNN), and Support Vector Machines
(SVM) are among the best algorithms for the classification and
analysis of patterns in data obtained from earth observation as
well as in urban growth problems. It was also emphasized that
hybrid approaches combining machine learning and cellular
automata have the potential for better performance in terms of
accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost.
Machine learning techniques have been applied to different
aspects of urban growth models, including calibration, sensi-
tivity analysis, and validation. In [11], SVMs were applied to
identify the most influential factors affecting urban growth in
the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The study found
that land use change, population density, and road density
were among the most important factors. In [12], an artificial
neural network was used to develop an urban growth model
for the five largest cities in Greece. The model incorporated
various impact factors, such as social, economic, biophysical,
neighboring-related, and political driving forces.
In [8], a novel technique combining supervised classifica-
tion, prediction of urban growth, and machine learning was
developed to predict urban growth boundaries and evaluate
urban expansion. The technique showed that the expansion
of Nasiriyah City was haphazard and unplanned, resulting
in disastrous effects on urban and natural systems. In [9],
Artificial Neural Network-Cellular Automata (ANN-CA) and
Random Forest machine learning algorithms were used for ur-
ban growth modeling (2021–2041) in Islamabad, Pakistan. The
study found that the city’s urbanization has been unplanned
and erratic, leading to dire consequences for the environment
and urban systems.
Overall, machine learning techniques have shown promis-
ing results in improving the accuracy and efficiency of the
SLEUTH model for urban growth prediction. However, more
research is needed to further explore the potential of machine
learning in this field.
III. OUR APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING METHODS
TO URBAN GROWTH
The problem considered here is the prediction of the future
growth of cities using PCA and historical satellite VIIRS
data. Specifically, it is necessary to find the parameters of the
PCA model that minimize the loss function, which measures
the difference between the predicted urban growth and actual
urban growth.

The optimization problem can be formulated as follows:
argmin
𝜃∈Θ
ℒ(𝜃),
(1)
where 𝜃 represents the model parameters, Θ is the parameter
space, and ℒ(𝜃) is the loss function that measures the discrep-
ancy between the predicted urban growth and the actual urban
growth observed in the VIIRS data.
The loss function ℒ(𝜃) can be defined as the sum of two
terms: a reconstruction loss ℒ𝑟𝑒𝑐 and a regularization loss
ℒ𝑟𝑒𝑔. The structure of the reconstraction loss function in the
area 𝒜 is based on the mean squared error (MSE) between the
predicted urban growth and the actual urban growth at each
time step 𝑡 :
ℒ𝑟𝑒𝑐(𝜃) =
1
𝑛𝑇
∑︁
𝑥∈𝒜
𝑤𝑖(𝑡)
𝑇
∑︁
𝑡=1
(𝑦𝑥,𝑡 − ^𝑦(𝑖𝑥,𝑡; 𝜃))2
(2)
where 𝑛 is the number of cells in the study area 𝒜, 𝑇 is the
number of time steps, 𝑤𝑥(𝑡) is the weight assigned to cell 𝑥
at time 𝑡, 𝑦𝑥,𝑡 is the observed urban growth level at cell 𝑥 and
time 𝑡, 𝑑𝑥,𝑡 is the input data at cell 𝑥 and time 𝑡, and ^𝑦(𝑑𝑥,𝑡; 𝜃)
is the predicted urban growth level at cell 𝑥 and time 𝑡 based
on the model with parameters 𝜃.
The regularization loss ℒ𝑟𝑒𝑔 penalizes the complexity of
the model, and generally helps prevent overfitting. A common
choice for ℒ𝑟𝑒𝑔 is the 𝐿2 norm of the parameters:
ℒ𝑟𝑒𝑔 = 𝜆 · ||𝜃||2
2.
(3)
The motivation behind such a formulation of the problem
is to develop a model that can accurately predict urban
growth and be quite stable and robust. Urbanization is a
complex process that involves various factors such as pop-
ulation growth, economic development, and land use change.
Accurately predicting urban growth can help urban planners
and policymakers make informed decisions regarding infras-
tructure development and resource allocation. Satellite VIIRS
data is a rich source of information about night-time lights
that provide unique information about population density. By
leveraging this data, machine learning models can learn to
identify patterns and predict urban growth with high accuracy.
To solve the optimization problem (1) efficiently, it is
possible to use the stochastic gradient descent method (SGD)
or one of its variants to update the parameters iteratively based
on a minibatch of data. In particular, the optimization problem
can be solved using gradient descent, which iteratively updates
the parameters 𝜃 in the direction of the negative gradient of
the loss function:
𝜃𝑡+1 = 𝜃𝑡 − 𝛼∇𝜃ℒ(𝜃),
(4)
where 𝛼 is the learning rate and ∇𝜃ℒ(𝜃) is the gradient of the
loss function with respect to the parameters 𝜃.
The gradient of the loss function with respect to the pa-
rameters can be computed using backpropagation through the
neural network. It is also possible to use such techniques as
early stopping and learning rate scheduling to improve the
performance of the model.
IV. COMPARISON OF TWO PREDICTIVE SYSTEMS – OURS
AND SLEUTH
The model developed by the authors of this paper uses a
computational framework of probabilistic cellular automata:
the earth’s surface is divided into cells, the interactions of
which are described by some rules. The evolution of cell states
over time is modeled by discrete iterations of interactions
according to these rules. The same scheme is used in the well-
known SLEUTH model [3] [4].
SLEUTH is the most popular urban expansion model to
date. The SLEUTH model reflects the patterns of urban
expansion based on several input variables and is therefore
relatively easy to understand. The interaction of different
parameters of this model, as in any other cellular automaton,
is based on explicitly described rules. It is important to note
the already known shortcomings of SLEUTH (see [5]): adding
new variables to the model and assessing their impact (e.g.,
beautification, land values, socio-economic distribution, access
to utilities, etc.) are complex and time-consuming; the model
considers only the fixed spatial neighborhoods of variables,
although their spatial influence is not always the same; poor
performance.
The authors expect that the use of their model will help
to overcome the shortcomings of SLEUTH and will allow
moving from “manual selection” of model parameters to
their automated assessment, applying statistical and machine
learning methods.
The SLEUTH system was developed and implemented in
C programming language in the late 1990s. It is designed to
model the spatial structure of land use changes. Since then,
the system has practically not changed, having undergone only
minor changes after 2001 (the last change was in 2017). It
runs on a dedicated server and does not use parallelization
technologies. The system is based on the use of cellular
automata, which play a key role in it. The SLEUTH system
uses cellular automata to model the spatial structure of land-
use changes.
In general, working with the SLEUTH system is not an
easy task, including compiling its source codes, configuring,
preparing data, running diagnostics, analyzing calculation re-
sults, etc. Adding new modules to the SLEUTH system is also
difficult, due to its monolithic architecture and underdeveloped
diagnostics and I/O functions.
V. ADVANTAGES OF OUR SYSTEM
The prototype of the prediction module developed by the
authors of this paper has been tested and has shown encour-
aging quality results.
The proposed system has demonstrated very good per-
formance, thanks to the extensive use of parallelization of
computing and cloud technology. Due to the use of modern
architecture, this system is also easier to maintain and develop.
The performance of the system is very important, since the
high speed of operation allows for conducting a large number
54

of experiments with different data and various model parame-
ters, and potentially opens up the possibility of using machine
learning, which will improve the quality of predictions.
Our approach has significant advantages over the SLEUTH
approach in terms of architecture, data used, model parameter
settings, and the implementation of the model itself. Using
the unique features of satellite data and cloud technologies,
our model can provide faster and potentially more accurate
forecasts of future territorial development.
At the architecture level, our system works in the cloud and
uses all its advantages, such as high scalability, parallelization,
the convenience of data storage, etc. The SLEUTH system, in
turn, runs on a single dedicated server with a limited set of
service functions and does not support parallelization. Thus,
to increase the performance of SLEUTH, you need to upgrade
the server at the physical level.
The authors use satellite data over different years, including
“night lights” (DMSP, VIIRS), which provides several ad-
ditional opportunities for forecasting territorial development.
In particular, “night lights” help to reliably determine the
boundaries of the compact residence of the population, as well
as to estimate the population density. In contrast, SLEUTH
relies on land-use maps and urbanization data, which may be
outdated and incomplete.
Historical data also provides a unique opportunity to assess
the quality of the predictive model and adjust additional global
parameters of the model. The use of more extensive and
diverse data sets allows for capturing changes over time better
and providing more accurate forecasts of future development.
The model parameter settings in the approach developed by
the authors differ from those used in SLEUTH. In the authors’
implementation of integer automata, the history of changes in
local data on the satellite data set used is taken into account.
By evaluating the parameters based on this story, including the
relationship between neighboring cells, the proposed model
can better account for the complex and dynamic nature of
urban development.
Effective application of machine learning and statistical
methods is possible only if there is a large amount of data. The
results of the work of “prediction” algorithms should be easily
interpreted and credible. One can recall the statement of the
economist J. M. Keynes where he claimed that the theory of
probability for many “has a taste of astrology or alchemy” [6]
(p. 8)). The same could be probably applicable to the results
of machine learning. Therefore, in the developed information
system, the initial focus is aimed at assessing the accuracy of
projected urban sprawl maps using validation methods as well
as visualizing the results at various stages of work.
The input data has spatial dimensions (latitude and longi-
tude) and a temporal component (time or time interval). Lo-
calization by space allows considering the local characteristics
of specific areas of interest and automatically adjusting the
local parameters of the algorithms using machine learning.
The presence of a time component in the data, in turn, allows
making additional adjustments to the parameters based on
historical data to improve the quality of the forecast and, where
it is possible, to compare the forecast and the real development.
In the proposed system (see Figure 2), the main manipulated
object is a time series of maps, where each pixel of data
(correspondent to some area of the surface) is classified, for
example, as “urban” or “non-urban”. The classification is not
binary but has several values corresponding to different ranges
of population density in the corresponding area.
The Map Web application allows simultaneously visualizing
different data layers and modeling results. Visualization, in
turn, provides an opportunity to obtain, study, understand, and
transfer to others difficult-to-formalize knowledge about the
process of urbanization.
The software created by the authors allows:
∙ Creating and processing time series of two-dimensional
data;
∙ Calculating the likely continuation for a given time series
of data;
∙ Making joint calculations of several time series (in par-
ticular, calculating a binary measure of the similarity of
two series of data cards.
As applied to the problem of spatiotemporal modeling of
cities, the functions mentioned above allow:
∙ Preparing data;
∙ Training and calculating the forecast;
∙ Visually comparing the forecast obtained after training on
historical data with the real development by calculation;
∙ Calculating a measure of the quality of the forecast,
which provides an opportunity to directly improve the
parameters of the forecast calculation algorithm;
∙ Conducting a comparative analysis of “plans” made by
policymakers and “forecasts” computed by the proposed
system.
The authors believe that a new round of progress in the field
of predictive computing systems for the territorial development
of cities will occur primarily due to the improvement of
nonfunctional characteristics, such as the simplicity of data
preparation, system performance, visualization efficiency, and
the ease of results interpretation at various stages of work.
Assessing the quality of modeling by training a model on a
piece of data at an early stage of system development helps to
improve the model and quantify the usefulness of certain data.
The use of the new model allows shifting from the manual
selection of model parameters to the selection of real data on
the territorial development of cities. The growing flow of new
instrumental data and data from techno-social systems, such as
social networks, will soon provide a substantial improvement
in the quality of forecasting with the help of statistics and
machine learning.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper is aimed at considering the issues related to
the application of machine learning in designing and creating
predictive models for the territorial development of cities. The
use of satellite data in developing machine learning predictive

models is also discussed. The role and importance of remote
sensing data, particularly night lights VIIRS/DNB satellite
data, in the development of these models, is highlighted. Ad-
ditionally, the authors share their experience in developing an
information system for forecasting the territorial development
of cities based on remote sensing satellite data.
Furthermore, a novel approach to developing a mathematical
model for urban growth prediction is presented. This approach
is based on machine learning using VIIRS/DNB satellite data.
The corresponding optimization problem for finding optimal
parameters of the urban growth predictive model is also raised
and discussed.
In the future, the authors plan to carry out practical ex-
periments involving urban growth predictive models in real-
world urban planning scenarios. To evaluate the performance
of the urban growth predictive model, quantitative metrics
will be employed to compare the predicted values with the
actual observed values using historical satellite data. These
metrics will provide a clear indication of how well the
model aligns with the observed urban growth in diverse real-
world scenarios. In particular, the Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE) metric will be used. By analyzing and comparing
the RMSE values across different regions and time periods,
a comprehensive assessment of the model’s accuracy can be
made, allowing for the identification of potential variations in
its performance. Furthermore, the authors intend to employ
validation techniques, such as cross-validation, to thoroughly
assess the robustness and generalizability of the model.
