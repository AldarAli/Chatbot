Abstract—In 
this 
paper, 
we 
propose 
applicable 
and 
comparative cost-capacity analysis of the heterogeneous 
wireless networks in order to determine the most cost effective 
radio network deployment strategies as a function of an 
extreme demand levels of even more than 100 GB per user and 
month. We perform the modeling by considering of the unit 
cost drivers relevant for the various base station classes which 
provide different coverage and high capacity performance, 
coming with the Long Term Evolution Release 10 (LTE-
Advanced) radio access technology or IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi 
standard. 
Considering 
different 
amounts 
of 
available 
bandwidth in the 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz bands, the key finding 
is that the small cell solutions like femto cells and Wi-Fi are 
more cost efficient when new macro base station sites need to 
be deployed or when very high demand levels need to be 
satisfied. In all other evaluated cases, the importance of the 
spectrum size comes to the highest level together with the 
introduction of the LTE-Advanced carrier aggregation 
functionality. Also, we evaluate the economic gains of a joint 
deployment of femto/Wi-Fi sites from one side and macrocells 
from other side. We determine that instead of investing in 
additional spectrum or deploying denser macro network, 
mobile operators could compensate the indoor wall penetration 
losses by deploying different number of femto sites per floor or 
user per femto site, for still satisfactory level of QoS.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
The rapid increase of mobile broadband services has 
resulted in a marvel of decoupling the traffic load from 
operator revenues. Flat service subscriptions nowadays, even 
further increases the challenge of the Mobile Network 
Operators (MNOs) to monetize on the data traffic. Hence, it 
is from the highest importance of the MNOs to deploy more 
cost effective networks that will respond to the increasing 
user 
demand. 
The 
forthcoming 
wireless 
network 
architectures 
become 
more 
heterogeneous, 
with 
hierarchically ranged Base stations (BS) sites/cells, as 
follows: macro (MaBS) to cover wider areas, and micro 
(MiBS), pico (PBS) and femto (FBS) complemented with 
particular wireless local area network (WLAN/Wi-Fi) to 
cover smaller areas. A number of papers have been 
published on modeling the cost-effectiveness by comparing 
the MaBS cell deployment with the small-cell deployment 
and suggesting utilization of joint or heterogeneous and even 
cooperative networks. Analysis of MaBS, MiBS and PBS 
HSPA cells capacity-cost comparisons including IEEE 
802.11a, are provided in [1][2][3]. Cost comparisons of LTE 
with HSPA deployed MaBS networks and FBS solutions are 
extensively covered in [3][4]. Additionally, the evaluation of 
the economic gain provided by various deployments of FBS 
and MaBS for LTE mobile broadband services is outlined in 
[5].  
In this article, we originally introduce the comparative 
cost modeling of MaBS, MiBS, PBS and FBS utilizing LTE-
Advanced (LTE-A) RAT [6][7], alongside with Wi-Fi 
standard IEEE 802.11ac [8]. Considering the “up to date” 
initial and running cost drivers, together with the coverage 
and capacity specific parameters, we deliver results helping 
more easily to assess the most cost efficient manner to 
deploy the heavily-loaded, wireless heterogeneous networks. 
The special focus is put on the comparison between MaBS 
and various small cell deployments. As according to 
Analysis Mason [9], more than 80% of the mobile traffic is 
generated in indoors, we create long-term investment case 
study related to indoor office users. In order to determine 
more realistic cost-capacity performance modeling, besides 
already discussed wall attenuation and indoor coverage 
strategies 
in 
[3][4], 
additionally, 
we 
consider 
the 
performance of the carrier aggregation functionality of LTE-
A RAT. For all deployment scenarios, we analyze the 
deployment of new sites and reusing the existing sites.  
Still having in mind that each cellular network in reality 
consists of a mix of BSs, we conduct the joint heterogeneous 
network cost-capacity analysis as well. The assessment of 
the economic gains of joint deployments is done for the 
period of 10 years by using the discounted cost model in 
order to take into account the “time value of investment and 
running costs”. 
The paper is organized as follows. Sections II and III 
describe the analysis approach through elaboration of RAN 
specific coverage, capacity and unit cost estimates for 
various BS classes. In the next section, we perform 
investment 
modeling 
of 
various 
wireless 
network 
deployment strategies through the case study. Based on the 
results from Section IV, in Section V, we discuss the 
findings and analyze the most and less cost-effective 
scenarios 
separately 
deployed. 
In 
Section 
VI, 
we 
demonstrate the combined cost-capacity modeling of 
different wireless heterogeneous network solutions to satisfy 
high demand levels.  A conclusion is drawn in Section VII.

II. 
RADIO ACCESS NETWORK COVERAGE AND 
CAPACITY MODELING  
Consisted of numerous BS sites and Radio Network 
Controllers (RNCs), the Radio Access Network (RAN) of 
the MNO is deployed to provide services within the entire 
system coverage area denoted as Asyst. According to 
Johansson et al. [10], a BS of class i is characterised by a 
maximum average throughput or capacity Tmaxi and cell 
range ri related to coverage. Based on the purpose of use, a 
BS of class i could be equipped with radio equipment 
supporting up to three sectors and up to three different 
frequency carriers. The number of cells Ncel, within the 
particular BS site i, is obtained as multiple of the number of 
supported sectors and frequency carriers. We model the 
coverage Acell of a particular cell area of BS site i as follows:  
𝐴𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 =  𝜋 ∙ 𝑟𝑖2                                    (1) 
The maximum path loss allows the maximum cell range 
to be estimated with a suitable propagation model, such as 
Okumura-Hata [12]. Based on [11], the calculation shows 
that urban cell range varies from 0.6 km at 2.6GHz to 1.4 km 
at 900 MHz. Since in this paper we focus on the urban dense 
area, according to Markendahl and Mäkitalo [3] and 
Markendahl [4], we consider 0.57 km range for MaBS. 
Based on the elaborations in [1][2], we estimate 0.27 for 
MiBS and 0.1 km range for PBS. FBS cell range in [3] is 
assumed at 0.050 km and in [13] in range of 0.01 – 0.030 
km. According to Mölleryd et al. [14], we model the 
aggregated capacity of the system, Tsyst, as follows:  
 
𝑇𝑠𝑦𝑠𝑡 =  𝑊 ∙ 𝑁𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒 ∙ 𝑁𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 ∙ 𝑆𝑒𝑓𝑓                             (2) 
where W is allocated bandwidth in MHz, Nsite  is the total 
number of BS sites within the system coverage area Asyst and 
Seff is the cell average cell spectral efficiency in bps/Hz/cell. 
Based on [6] [7] the average spectral efficiency for LTE-A 
varies from 6.6, 4.2 and 3.8 bit/s/Hz/cell for the indoor, 
microcellular and base coverage urban environments, 
respectively (environments are determined in line with [15]). 
With regard to the FBS deployment, interference problems to 
non-FBS cell occur with the creation of the so called “Closed 
User Group” deployment FBS model [16]. As proposed by 
[17], in adjacent-channel deployments (the FBS is deployed 
on a dedicated carrier), the coverage holes are considerably 
easier to minimize and control than when the FBS is 
deployed on the same carrier as the macro layer (co-channel 
deployment - sharing the channel with the MaBS network). 
Hence, in this article we consider FBS deployment in a 
different frequency band than MaBS. Currently, the LTE 
FBS are developed with 5, 10 and 15 MHz bandwidth 
(achieving up to 37, 75 and 112 Mbps in downlink, 
respectively) and available from 8 to 16 users simultaneously 
[18]. Choi in [13], indicates that 4G FBS will utilize the 
bandwidth of 20 MHz per carrier. We use the indoor average 
spectral efficiency of 6.6 bps/Hz and 20 MHz of spectrum 
for FBS with 50m coverage range.  According to Xiao [19], 
it is very difficult to exceed 50-60% of the nominal bit rate 
of the underlying physical layer of Wi-Fi. Frame 
aggregations techniques are used to improve the Medium 
Access Control (MAC) layer efficiency [20].

According to Cisco [21], we consider the first-wave 
IEEE 802.11ac products operating in the 5 GHz band with 
80 MHz and delivering up to 1300 Mbps (high end) at the 
physical layer up to 30 m coverage range. Based on the all 
above coverage and capacity estimates, we summarize in 
Table I, RAN coverage and capacity parameters related to 
different RAT as used in this paper. 
III. 
HETEROGENEOUS RADIO ACCESS NETWORK COST 
MODELING  
We base our cost structure modelling to the methodology 
developed in [1] [5] by limiting to the capital investment to 
acquire and deploy the RAN (CAPEX), and the costs to 
operate the RAN (OPEX). We consider the BS equipment, 
BS site installation & buildout, backhaul transmission 
equipment and Radio Network Controller equipment as BS 
related CAPEX items and electric power, operation & 
maintenance, site lease and backhaul transmission lease as 
BS related OPEX items. Also, we evaluate the CAPEX and 
OPEX of system spectrum. Regardless that CAPEX consists 
of one-time expenditures, usually for practical reasons these 
expenditures are spread over several years, i.e., annualized. 
Still, according to METIS [22] an even more accurate model 
could be obtained by using present values instead of 
annualizing the CAPEX. In order to calculate the cost per 
item of type i in present value, according to Johansson et al. 
[2], we use the standard economical method for cumulated 
discounted cash flows yield by summing up the total 
discounted annual expenditures for the whole network life 
cycle (K years) as follows: 
Ɛ𝑖 =   
𝛼𝑘,𝑖
(1 + 𝛽)𝑘
𝐾−1
𝑘=0
                          (3) 
 
where αk,i is the sum of expenditures, in terms of CAPEX 
and OPEX, occurred within year k of an item of type i and β 
is the discount rate. In all analyzed scenarios in this paper, 
we assume network life cycle of K = 10 years and that all 
BSs are installed during the first year of deployment. 
Additionally, according to Frias and Pérez [5], we use the 
discounted rate equalized to the cost of capital (a WACC - 
weighted average cost of capital) of β = 12 %. Consequently, 
the total discounted cost, CTOT, of a wireless heterogeneous 
access network comprising of macro sites and small sites 
normalized per unit of area, can be approximated as follows: 
𝐶𝑇𝑂𝑇 = Ɛ𝑀 ∙ 𝑁𝑀 + Ɛ𝑆 ∙ 𝑁𝑆 + Ɛ𝑆𝑃𝐸𝐶𝑇𝑅𝑈𝑀
𝐴𝑠𝑦𝑠𝑡
   [𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡/𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎]          (4)

where ƐM is the total discounted cost of MaBS, ƐS the total 
discounted cost of small BS (or Wi-FI BS), ƐSPECTRUM is the 
total discounted cost for spectrum licenses, Asyst is the 
coverage area of entire operator’s network and NM and Ns is 
the average number of MaBSs and small BSs, respectively 
(in this paper, we will not consider the costs that are not 
related to the technical solution, such as customer care and 
marketing, as well as the average customer retention or 
subsidy costs). The cost estimates related to different RATs 
and BS classes will be derived in the next subsections. 
A. Base Stations Unit Cost Estimates 
The cost per BS is significantly different based on the 
BS type considered in this paper. For example, BSs 
providing bigger coverage imply a higher cost for 
equipment, site leases and installation whereas a small cells 
BS sites costs much less in those aspects. Nevertheless, 
according to Johansson et al. [2], fixed costs not directly 
related to the capacity of the BS are divided between many 
users in a MaBS so the cost per user may still be lower in 
many scenarios.  
According to Markendahl and Mäkitalo [3], the 
estimates for year 2010 show that cost for deploying a new 
MaBS site in the urban area is 110 k€ including 
transmission and that the cost for radio equipment 
supporting three sectors and 5–20 MHz to 10 k€, yielding to 
total CAPEX of 120 k€. According to Johansson [1], 
CAPEX for 2-carrier and single carrier MaBS deployment is 
20% and 40% lower than 3-carrier MaBS, respectively. 
Notice though that the costs for an LTE-A cellular network 
are hypothetical since the system is now being released to 
the market. Out of Johansson [1], we consider the price of a 
MiBS and PBS station equals 50% and 15%, respectively, 
of a single-carrier MaBS equipment, with a note that PBS 
needs 2 k€  for transmission, and  MiBS and PBS requires 
10 k€  and  2 k€ for the site deployment, respectively. 
According to Markendahl [4], on average the deployment of 
one FBS is around 1 k€.  
Even prior the full standardization, some manufactures 
start to offer IEEE 802.11ac products. WLAN Access points 
(AP) for consumers are currently available at prices of 
around €160 [24]. Nevertheless, for the enterprise solutions 
there should be used WLAN carrier grade access [25] [26]. 
Johansson in [1], outlines that the carrier grade AP is 10 
time more expensive than WLAN AP for consumers, and 
that cost for router and access getaway is 20 k€. 
Consequently, we assume that carrier grade access point 
supporting IEEE 802.11ac will cost around 1.5 k€, and 
additional 1k€ should be added per AP, assuming that the 
control equipment is divided between 20 APs.  
Regarding the OPEX, Markendahl and Mäkitalo in [3] 
assume 30 k€ annual cost for the new MaBS site and 
Johansson in [1] considers 13.4 k€ for the single carrier 
MaBS by outlining an appropriate ratios of 1.15, 1.29, 0.67, 
0.21 and 0.10 related to this cost for the 2-carrier MaBS, 3-
carrier MaBS, MiBS, PBS and Wi-Fi BS. Consequently in 
this paper, we assume 20 k€ OPEX for the new 3-carrier 
MaBS site.

According to Markendahl and Mäkitalo [3], we assume 
10 k€ for the existing site. For the FBS, Markendahl and 
Mäkitalo in [3] estimates the annual operational cost to be 
0.5 k€ per BS. To summarize the discussion on cost 
estimates, Table II outlines the resulting discounted cost per 
the considered newly deployed BS class as calculated 
according to (3). 
B. Spectrum Cost Analysis 
Alternatively, and if possible, MNOs could increase the 
number of carriers by adding additional spectrum, which 
could replace the deployment of new sites. This brings 
spectrum to an essential asset as it could be a substitute for 
new sites.  
The more bandwidth that can be used at one site the 
higher the capacity. Currently, across Europe MNOs have 
licensed spectrum at different bands and the carriers in 
between are set at 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 
MHz and 2600 MHz bands. All parts from the available 
bandwidth provide different performance for coverage and 
capacity. 
MNOs are annualizing the CAPEX related to the 
spectrum licenses for the period of their validity, which is 
mostly 10 years and usually no more than 20 years. 
Additionally MNOs have OPEX per MHz related to the 
annual frequency charges.  
From today’s perspective and according to the ongoing 
developments in the European telecommunication markets, 
most of the used spectrum is amortized, excluding the part 
of the spectrum from 790 MHz to 862 MHz (so called 
Digital Dividend - DD) that was acquired by the MNOs in 
the past few years in most of the European countries. Based 
on the benchmark analysis of the data collected from the 
European National Regulatory Authorities websites [26], the 
average annual frequency fee per MHz is below 1 
EUR/MHz and population and maximum 10 EUR/MHz and 
km². Furthermore, according to BEREC [26], the Figure 1 
depicts the invested price in DD band per MHz and per km² 
(Note that, for Netherlands and United Kingdom the price is 
1525 and 736 EUR/MHz/km².  
According to PWC [27], the invested price in DD band 
per MHz and per population moves from 0.2 EUR in Croatia 
up to 0.8 EUR in Italy.

IV. INVESTMENT CASE STUDY 
A. Case Study Description  
According to Johansson et al. [2], the different BSs will 
minimize cost for different scenarios. Nevertheless, for the 
sake of simplicity, first we will perform cost modeling 
through case study of different base stations separately. 
Based on the results of separate analysis, than we will 
dimension the network of the analyzed service area as a 
combination of a of a macro layer solution, using existing 
sites and as much available spectrum as possible, with a 
supporting small cells network. Accordingly, based on the 
per unit cost estimates from Table I and Table II in this 
section, we will assess how the total investment cost (initial 
CAPEX) of the wireless network deployed within the 
particular area, varies as a function of the user demand. 
Furthermore, we will apply different deployment scenario 
combining the amount of the bandwidth and BS classes. In 
particular, we consider building of the new office center in 
the 1 km² urban indoor area through construction of ten 5 
floor buildings hosting 10.000 workers. Consequently, we 
will not analyze the MiBS and PBS options out of the small 
cell deployments, but only the strict indoor solution of small 
cells represented by FBS alongside with the Wi-Fi. For the 
macro layer, we will consider the CAPEX needed for 
deployment 
of 
three-sector 
MaBS 
supporting 
three 
frequency carriers. Nevertheless, for the capacity estimates, 
we will consider that only single carrier is in use, to make the 
comparison between BS types simple. 
 In line with Figure 1, the cost of 1 MHz per the system 
area of 1 km² is negligible compared to the cost of even 
single carrier MaBS. Consequently, we will ignore the 
CAPEX inputs for the spectrum within the estimation of the 
total investment costs calculated according to (4).

B. Traffic Demand 
Based on [28], in 2013 around 95% of the total global 
mobile traffic was generated by smartphones (62%), laptops 
(24.5%) and tablets (8.5%) with around 0.5 GB/month from 
smartphone user and 2.6 times more from the laptop users 
and 4.6 times more from tablets (only 3% of the users 
generated more than 5 GB/month and 24% more than 2 
GB/month). The same source predicts that the average usage 
per month of smartphones will rise x 5 times (up to 2.7 GB) 
by 2018 having 66% from the total traffic and that tablet 
share will be more than 18%.  Following the same ratios, we 
could draw conclusion that the average usage per month in 
2018 will be around 12.2 GB and 6.9 GB for tablets and 
laptops respectively. Furthermore, [29] predicts an average 
N. American mobile user to consume 6 GB/month in 2017. 
Consequently, in order to ensure future-proof network 
(e.g., beyond 2020), we will perform the dimensioning of the 
network from our case study with the following two demand 
levels: moderate demand or in average 44 GB/user/month 
and high demand of 110 GB/user/month.  
We consider that the usage will be spread out over 8 
hours per day, translating into a busy hour rate of 12.5%, in 
line with the industry standard [30]. Conversion of the 
load/user/month to the user data rates (Mbps) and capacity 
per area unit for 10 000 users (Gbps/km²) is given in Table 
III, for the 8 busy hours. In this paper, we consider uniform 
traffic distribution within the considered area. 
C. Macro cellular Deployments 
Assuming the spectral efficiency of 3.8 bit/s/Hz/cell of 
outdoor LTE-A RAT, the achieved capacity with a single 
carrier three-sector MaBS site is 114.0 Mbps, 228.0 Mbps 
and 342.0 Mbps with 10 MHz, 20 MHz and 30 MHz of 
spectrum, respectively (calculated in line with (2)).  
1) Initial Scenario 
Since a cell area of 1 km² corresponds to a cell radius of 
0.57 km (according to (1)), our requirements on average user 
data rates during busy hours would be met even at the cell 
borders with the high broadband demand (~ 1.0 Mbps what 
is in line with the data rate of 1.0 Mbps as assumed in [11]).  
Within the initial scenario, we perform the cost-capacity 
analysis using 20 MHz for the macro-layer in the 2.6 GHz 
band with the average spectral efficiency of LTE-A RAT. In 
accordance with [3], for the MaBS site re-use scenario, we 
estimate the total CAPEX of 20 k€ for existing site (the cost 
needed to upgrade an existing site is estimated to 10 k€ and 
the cost for radio equipment supporting three sectors and 5–
20 MHz to 10 k€). Based on Tables I and II, Table IV 
summarizes the total invested costs for the moderate and 
high demand estimates. It is noticeable that the investment to 
satisfy the high demand with the implementation of the 
existing MaBS is almost half than the cost needed to ensure 
2.5 times less capacity with new MaBS sites.  
2) Wall Penetration Losses Compensation Scenario 
When trying to compensate for the wall penetration 
losses, two options are possible according to Markendahl and 
Mäkitalo [3] and Markendahl [4]: building a denser 2.6 GHz 
network and deployment using 10 MHz within the 800 MHz 
band, i.e., better indoor coverage.

Markendahl and Mäkitalo in [3] calculated that in order 
to compensate the additional 12 dB of attenuation (the 
difference between operation in the 800 MHz and the 2.6 
GHz band), 5 time denser network should build at 2.6 GHz 
band. Consequently, Table V summarizes the cost-capacity 
outcomes of this scenario. We can see that in order to 
compensate the wall penetration losses with the MaBS 
solution, the deployment of a large number of new sites is 
very costly. Again, the re-use of existing sites leads to less 
costly deployment even when many sites need to be 
equipped with new radio transceivers for the high demand. 
Still, due to the high coverage performance, the most cost-
efficient option in case of high demand is the reuse of the 
existing sites with 10 MHz in 800 MHz band. 
3) Carrier Aggregation Scenario 
According to Qualcomm [31], carrier aggregation as 
characteristic of LTE-A RAT, allows combining lower and 
higher bands — leveraging better coverage of the former 
with higher availability of the latter (up to 5 carriers and up 
to 100 MHz supported in standards). In order to fully assess 
the cost-efficiency possibilities, we create one more 
deployment scenario assuming the aggregation of the both 
frequency carriers at 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz bands. By this 
the bandwidth available will be increased to 30 MHz, and 
exactly this is going to be the solution how to increase the 
capacity (even for 3 times) compared to the use of only 10 
MHz bandwidth in 800 MHz band, but without increase the 
number of sites due to coverage reasons as in the case with 
2.6 GHz deployment. From the cost perspective, this will 
mean that we need to install two type of different radio 
equipment per BS. Consequently, the CAPEX will increase 
for additional 10 k €, and the total CAPEX per site will be 
130 k€ for the new sites and 30k € for the existing sites. 
According to pervious estimations, we will assume OPEX of 
20 k€ for new and 10 k€ for the existing MaBSs.  
The number of needed BS sites using carrier aggregation 
functionality and the relevant costs-capacity outcomes are 
summarized in Table VI.

Findings show that for around 0.9 M€ needed to upgrade 
the existing sites, the high user demand will be ensured. 
Further, with 1.56 M€ of investment and construction of new 
sites the high demands can be satisfied, too.    
D. Femto Cell and Wi-Fi Deployments  
In line with [3], and explanations for the maximum 
numbers of users per access point for FBS and Wi-Fi given 
in Section II above, we consider different options of the user 
oriented and coverage oriented approaches.  Since the 
construction of the new office center is green-field, we will 
assume that previously there were no small cell installations 
within the considered area of 1 km². Consequently, the Table 
VII summarizes the cost-capacity figures for the FBS and 
Wi-Fi deployments. As expected with any of the considered 
scenarios of FBS and Wi-Fi, the provisioning of the 
demanded capacity will be achieved.  The coverage is main 
cost driver for these two scenarios and high density indicates 
high network costs.  
V. 
COMPARATIVE DISCUSSION RELATED TO THE 
SEPARATE NETWORK DEPLOYMENTS 
Assuming the total investment budget of 3.0 Million € 
(M €), we compare in Figure 2 the investment costs in M € 
for separate network deployment scenarios as function of 
user demand in Gbps. It is noticeable that LTE-A MaBS 
deployment with site re-use and carrier aggregation in place, 
has the lowest cost for the capacities below 2.0 Gbps. Even 
LTE-A MaBS deployment with new sites and carrier 
aggregation in place is more cost effective option compared 
to the Macro 5xtime denser deployment and site reuse at 2.6 
GHz band. Hence, the LTE-A RAT and carrier aggregation 
functionality from cost perspective could be acceptable 
MaBS deployment scenario for the new market entrant as 
well, since with it the new comer will be able to achieve 
comparable profitability with the existing operators for 
relatively high demand levels.

From other side, deployment with the reuse of the 
existing MaBS with 10 MHz spectrum in the 800 MHz band 
causes achieving high demand with tolerable investment of 
1,75 M€ due to the superb coverage and penetration 
performance of the 800 MHz carrier frequency. For the 
existing mobile operator missing spectrum in the 800 MHz, 
an option will be to reuse existing sites with 5 time higher 
density, what is more cost-effective solution than MaBs 
deployment with new sites in the 800 MHz band what in fact 
is the less cost efficient option. Thus, we can draw a 
conclusion that it is very important if new MaBS sites need 
to be deployed or not. In general, for the MaBS deployments 
it could be noticed that the slope of the lines depends on the 
number of sites that are needed and especially if new sites 
need to be deployed. The performances of FBS and Wi-Fi 
are different. As we already considered those types of indoor 
deployments are coverage, rather than capacity limited. Their 
cost depend form the density of BS used. As shown in Figure 
2, for dense network deployments 4 users per FBS/Wi-Fi or 
32 FBS/Wi-Fi sites per floor, is less cost-effective option 
comparing to most of the MaBS deployments unless the user 
demand is extremely high  (above 6.5 Gbps). FBS/Wi-Fi 
deployments are cost-efficient when single site can support 
higher number of users (e.g., 32 per site or 4 sites per floor).  
Thus, for the capacities above 2.0 Gbps, the most cost-
effective deployment option is the utilization of 4 FBS per 
floor. A comparison of FBS and Wi-Fi shows that the FBS 
solution is more cost effective than Wi-Fi deployment, but 
from the capacity long-term perspective the better option 
should be IEEE 802.11ac Wi-Fi deployment due to its 
superb capacity performance. 
VI. 
DEMONSTRATION OF THE COMBINED COST-
CAPACITY MODELING 
In the previous section, we have conducted the cost-
capacity modeling through case study of different BSs 
separately and focusing only at the investment performed 
within the first year. Following the findings of the separate 
solutions, 
here, 
we 
will 
demonstrate 
the 
network 
dimensioning of the analyzed service area as a combination 
of most cost-effective macro and small cell or Wi-Fi 
solutions.

Fig. 3. Wireless heterogeneous network total discounted cost for the 
period of 10 years, jointly deployed by categories to satisfy high 
demand level of 10 Gbps/km ² with the LTE-A and IEEE 802.11ac. 
This could be as of particular interest of MNO having 
existing network deployment within the analyzed area. Thus, 
in the spotlight once again comes the initial scenario with the 
usage of 20 MHz in the 2.6 GHz band for the macro layer, 
identified as insufficient to compensate the wall penetration 
losses arising with the construction of the office center.  
The graphical representation of the total discounted cost 
for various heterogeneous network deployments in 10 years 
period is shown in Figure 3. The results are yield in 
accordance with (3) and (4), the total discounted cost 
estimates per different BS classes (CAPEX + OPEX in 
present value for the period of 10 years and WACC = 12%) 
and findings for the number of BS (as per Tables IV – VII) 
needed to satisfy the high demand level of 10 Gbps/km ².  
As some of the FBS and Wi-Fi options produce capacity 
overprovisioning (e.g., 4-8 user per BS or 16-32 BS per 
floor), we combine some of those deployments only with the 
initial MaBS scenario. The rest of the FBS and W-Fi 
solutions are combined with the MaBS scenarios which 
ensure wall penetration losses compensation, too.  
It could be noticed that MNO having deployed macro 
network with 20 MHz in the 2.6 GHz network, instead of 
investing in additional spectrum or deploying denser 
network, it could compensate the indoor wall penetration 
losses by deploying 16 FBS sites per floor. That total 
discounted cost-efficient level of around 6.0 M€ is 
comparable for instance with deployment of new MaBS sites 
with carrier aggregation and 32 users per FBS indoor 
deployment  what in fact is the most cost efficient combined 
macro/small cell deployment for still acceptable QoS from 
capacity perspective.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
We introduced a model for evaluation of the total 
deployment costs of heterogeneous wireless access networks. 
The model uses up to date inputs of the unit cost of particular 
base station class which is characterized with specific 
coverage and capacity parameters. For the cellular 
deployments, we use the forthcoming LTE-A RAT and for 
the WLAN networks, we consider the future-proof IEEE 
802.11ac standard.

Through the investment case study, which considers 
construction of large office center, we have compared the 
cost-capacity performance for macro and small cell 
deployments as a function of moderate to very high user 
demand levels. The study analyzed deployments in both the 
800 MHz and 2.6 GHz bands as well as the scenario of 
aggregated carriers in these bands. Findings show that the 
macro cell deployment scenarios show linear increase with 
demand. In order to satisfy moderate demand levels, it can be 
concluded that the re-use of sites, have a large impact also 
when a “denser” macro network is deployed in order to 
compensate for wall attenuation. The re-use of the existing 
macro sites with the low-end frequency carriers at 800 MHz, 
represents moderate cost-efficiency compared to other 
solutions.  
Still, the solution to deploy the denser network at 2.6 
GHz band with re-use of the existing sites is more cost-
efficient than the solution to construct new sites with 800 
MHz carrier, what shows the importance of the spectrum 
available, too. Hence, the key finding is that use of carrier 
aggregation functionality of LTE-A will significantly 
increase 
the 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
the 
macrocellular 
deployment. Thus, with enabling aggregation of the carriers 
in the band of 800 MHz and of 2.6 GHz on the existing sites, 
we create the most cost-efficient deployment for moderate 
demand levels.  
On the other side, the indoor deployed femto cell and Wi-
Fi solutions (being only coverage limited) are most cost 
efficient only for the higher to extreme user demands. 
Results indicate that FBS/Wi-Fi significantly become cost-
efficient when single site can support higher number of 
users, basically due to the very low unit cost compared to the 
equipment cost of the higher order cellular deployments. 
With regard to the joint heterogeneous deployment, we 
determine that for operator holding less spectrum and in the 
upper bands, instead of investing in additional spectrum or 
deploying denser network, it could compensate the indoor 
wall penetration losses by deploying the acceptable number 
of FBS sites per floor from perspective of high demand 
levels and taking into account the “time value of money”. 
Further studies in this field could investigate the 
cooperative layouts of macro with femto cells or Wi-Fi by 
consideration of the beyond 2020 mobile and wireless 
system targets [22].
