Abstract—This paper presents an analysis and parametrical 
modeling of blood plasma separation devices with optical 
sorting and deterministic lateral displacement mechanisms.
The new device for optical sorting is offered. The modeling 
with the novel device shows that this device can separate red 
blood cells of different sizes from whole blood. Special 
numerical technique with periodical boundary conditions was 
applied for simulation of deterministic lateral displacement. 
Comparison of optical sorting and deterministic lateral 
displacement is performed. Unexplored optical and mechanical 
properties of blood components and indispensability of 
additional researches are also discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Separation of the cellular component of human blood is 
of essential interest for medicine and research. In general 
outline human blood consists of plasma, erythrocytes or red 
blood cells (RBCs), reticulocytes, platelets, and leukocytes
or white blood cells (WBCs). About 55% of whole blood is 
blood plasma. The proportion of blood volume that is 
occupied by erythrocytes is normally about 48% for men and 
38% for women. This proportion is a hematocrit. Normally 
leukocytes take up approximately 1% of blood volume in a 
healthy adult human. The number of WBCs in the blood is a 
very sensitive indicator of diseases. Thus it is especially 
important to remove all RBCs for further analysis of WBCs. 
There are diverse classes of WBCs. A major separation of 
leukocytes includes five types, neutrophils, lymphocytes, 
monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils [1].
Usually, human blood is separated by large volume 
centrifugation [2]. With modern lab equipment such as lab-
on-a-chip-type devices this approach is not so effective. This 
has lead to an interest in adopting new microscopic 
separation techniques. Two of these promising methods are 
optical sorting [3][4] and deterministic lateral displacement 
[5] methods.
In the present paper, we first consider the new design for 
optical sorting and then we compare it to the deterministic
lateral displacement. Also we discuss unexplored optical and 
mechanical properties of blood components.
II.
OPTICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF BLOOD
The analysis of the reviews devoted to optical sorting and 
deterministic lateral displacement shows that only separation 
of colloidal particles of spherical shape in special mixture is 
well investigated [6-12]. Fractionation of real human blood 
requires essential efforts and more complicated devices [13].
Major problem here is that we have multi-component 
mixture of composite particles in non-Newtonian liquid.
Not all of the physical properties of these particles and 
liquid are well known.
A.
Refractive Index and Absorption Coefficient
Mostly examined are the refractive index of whole blood, 
blood plasma, and RBCs. We collected some of measured 
refractive indexes and description of measuring methods in 
Table I.
If λ is the wavelength in nm then according to [26] the 
spectral dependence of refractive index of blood plasma is:

np 
We managed to find in the literature only one mention of 
platelet [22] and WBC [25] refractive index.
Absorption and scattering coefficients of whole blood at 
different oxygenation and different wavelength of incident 
light is widely published [16][27-29]. These coefficients for 
blood components are studied not completely. Absorption 
coefficient is very important for estimation of heating of 
plasma and particles during optical sorting.
B.
Mechanical Properties of Blood
In a first approximation the blood plasma can be 
considered as a Newtonian liquid, but whole blood is a non-
Newtonian. 
At a normal physiological hematocrit of 45%, the 
viscosity of blood is  = 410-2 poise, which is roughly 4 
times that of water. Plasma alone (zero hematocrit) has a 
viscosity of  = 1.110-2 to 1.610-2 poise, depending upon 
the concentration of plasma proteins [30]. Variation of 
viscosity with shear rate at different haematocrits is well 
studied [31].

The movement of a particle in the viscous medium is 
characterized by Reynolds number Re = vR/, where,  is 
the fluid density, v is the particle velocity, R is a 
characteristic dimension (for example, radius of spherical 
particle), and  is the fluid viscosity. In our case for very low 
Reynolds numbers (Re<<1) the drag force on a sphere is 
described by Stokes’ law:

FDvR,

For a 10 m diameter spherical particle at a speed of 20.0 
m/s the drag force is changed from 2.1 to 3.0 pN depending 
on plasma viscosity.

Elastic properties of blood cells are very important in 
collision between particles or between particles
and 
mechanical hindrance. To the best of our knowledge, mainly 
works have been devoted to the coefficient of elasticity of 
RBCs. For example, in [32], the homogeneous Young’s 
modulus for spherical red blood cells was measured as E = 
11.0 ± 0.5 Pa. In all probability the elastic properties of over 
blood cells are still unknown.
III.
OPTICAL SORTING
According 
to 
investigations 
of 
continuous 
flow 
separation [4, 33-38] optical fractionation may offer 
unparalleled selectivity for particle size and refractive index. 
WBCs have larger size than RBCs and smaller refractive 
index. Hence WBCs are undergone to greater drag force and 
smaller optical force than RBCs. It allows us to propose a 
device of optical sorting which separates only RBCs from 
whole blood.
Figure 1. Schematic drawing of possible device for optical separation.
A two buffer streams of plasma and a central stream of 
whole blood move at equal speed (Fig. 1.). The optical traps 
are shown in Fig. 1 by green dots. RBCs are deviating by 
light (red arrows); WBCs are practically not at same 
conditions (blue arrows).
For our simulation, we assume that RBCs and WBCs are 
spherical balls. The radii of RBCs are RRBC = 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 
and 4.0 m. The refractive index of plasma is np = 1.335, 
refractive indexes of RBCs and WBCs are nRBC = 1.40 and 
nWBC = 1.36 respectively. The distance between light spots is 
b = 4 and 5 m. The angle of trap layout is  = 15 and 20. 
The laser power per trap is P =5.0, 6.5 and 8.3 mWtrap. The 
speed of plasma is 20 m/s for all presented calculations.

distance b = 4 m and angle  = 20 are shown in Fig. 2. 
Trajectories of RBCs are deviated on angle  while WBCs 
practically freely pass through tweezers array.

To calculate the optical force we followed [4, 33], the 
drag force was evaluated by (2).
Some results of our simulations for average velocity of 
RBCs are summarized in Table II and III. At some set of 
parameters it is possible to keep RBC at the trap. At the same 
time WBCs practically do not change speed.
IV.
DETERMINISTIC LATERAL DISPLACEMENT
Deterministic lateral displacement has been applied to the 
size separation of particles and DNA molecules by pumping 
through an array of obstacles [5, 13, 39-41]. The array 
consisted of rows of micrometer-scale posts with a consistent 
gap between the posts in each row. Each row of obstacles is 
shifted horizontally with respect to the previous row (Fig. 3).
Figure 3. Streamlines in low Reynolds number flow through a periodic 
array of micrometer-scale obstacles.

The green circles represent the array of obstacles; the red 
lines are the streamlines in Fig. 3. The shift of each next row 
equals to tenth of the horizontal distance between obstacles 
in our illustration. The total fluid flux through each gap 
between two obstacles is divided into 10 flow streams in Fig. 
3.
After 10 horizontal rows the picture is repeated. 
Rectangular periodical part of obstacle array is colored in 
Fig. 3.
According 
to 
deterministic 
lateral 
displacement
conception, small particles shall move in zigzag mode (blue 
and pink paths in Fig. 3) along a streamline from top to 
bottom. Large particles should jump from one post to 
another and deviate to the right from horizontal direction.
Apparently the flow in infinite periodic array of obstacles 
is presented by the primitive cell shown in Fig. 4. Obstacles 
are painted in green color; the cell is marked by pink color. 
We applied the finite element method and used special 
numerical technique to take into account periodical boundary 
conditions 
for 
simulation 
of 
deterministic 
lateral 
displacement in primitive cell. This reception allows to 
reduce number of nodes essentially.
Figure 4. Streamlines (a) and velosity distribution (b) for primitive cell of 
obstacle array.
For simulation which shown in Figs. 3 and 4 the diameter 
of cylindrical obstacles was 10 m, Distance between centers 
of cylinder in horizontal direction and period of obstacle 
rows in vertical direction were 20 m.
The large problem is a trajectory analysis of individual 
blood cell:

Application of the Stokes’ law (2) for evaluation of 
the drag force is incorrect;

The size of a particle is comparable with distance 
between posts as shown in Fig. 4b. Such particle has 
to perturb the fluid flow;

Parameters of collision between a blood cell and 
obstacles are unknown. Conditions of sticking of a 
cell to an obstacle are unknown too;

Density of blood cells is quite high therefore RBCs
undergo impacts at passing through an array.
Let's note also that boundary conditions between plasma 
and obstacles as well as between plasma and blood cells are 
insufficiently studied.
V.
CONCLUSION
The review of measured optical and mechanical 
properties of blood is presented. It is noted, that physical 
properties of many blood components are studied not fully.
Thus it is essential to investigate refractive indexes and 
absorption coefficients of reticulocytes, platelets, and white 
blood 
cells 
(neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, 
monocytes, 
eosinophils, and basophils). Also elastic properties of all 
blood cells except RBCs are practically unknown.
We offered a new device for optical sorting of blood 
cells. The modeling with the novel device shows that this 
device can separate RBCs of different sizes from whole 
blood. For simulation of deterministic lateral displacement 
we developed special finite-element technique which allows 
to take into account periodical boundary conditions for 
primitive cell and to reduce number of nodes.
We can conclude that optical separation possesses certain 
advantages
in comparison with deterministic lateral 
displacement:

Smaller distance of separation;

Tunable distance between light spots and tunable 
power per trap;

Absence of mechanical interaction and hence 
absence of mechanical damage of cells.
Additionally we note that the gaps between mechanical 
posts in deterministic lateral displacement method can be 
littered by the stuck cells.
At the same time optical separation has the certain 
drawbacks:

Heating of plasma and blood cells;

Optical traps can hold small blood particles and 
obstruct to extraction of RBC;

Speed of the RBC guided by optical traps is smaller 
than speed of a free RBC thus it is possible a 
collision between RBCs.
The large benefit of the deterministic lateral displacement
is that the method is very simple and devices are very cheap. 
Although the optical sorting still are on a development stage 
the deterministic lateral displacement are already close to 
clinical tests.
