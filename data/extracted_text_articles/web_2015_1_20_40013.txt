Abstract— Web service composition is studied by many works 
and constitutes the heart of a great research activity. However, 
the majority of this work does not take into account temporal 
exception handling. Consequently, the results do not answer 
the needs and the temporal preferences of customers and 
suppliers. Incorporating temporal constraints in Web service 
composition results in a more complex model and addresses 
the crucial need for exception handling. In this paper, we 
present H-Service-Net model for Web service composition and 
policies of handling exceptions. We validated our proposed 
approach in an implementation called H-Service-Editor tool. 
Keywords-Composition of Web services; Petri network; 
temporal constraints; handling of exception.

INTRODUCTION  
Due to its capability for dynamic composition and easy  
reuse,  Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)  has become  a  
popular  framework  for  software development  in  many  
application  domains.  An important process in SOA is 
service composition [9].  
A major part of the interest created by so-called Web 
services is their possibility to distribute processing 
capabilities across a number of loosely coupled functional 
entities communicating over standardized messages [6]. 
Companies such as Google, Amazon or PayPal have been 
making an increasing part of their revenue by exposing and 
selling their functionalities as instances of services, reusable 
as background components by third-party application 
developers [6]. 
A composite Web service invokes one or more other 
Web services and combines their functionality. In contrast, a 
Web service that does not invoke other Web services is 
called a basic Web service. The process of developing a 
composite Web service is referred to as a Web service 
composition [10]. 
The objective of Web services composition is to 
determine a combination of services according to the 
customer's request. This composition will seem to the 
customer as a single service because it is transparent to him. 
In composition, Web services collaborate by exchanging 
messages. In addition to this exchange, other factors affect 
this composition. We are interested in the time factor which 
is crucial and at the same time very complex.  
Due to failures that can occur using Web services and 
their composition, several solutions of exception handling 
have been proposed in order to recover from these 
exceptions.  
Exceptions are critical in Web services. Therefore, it is 
essential to take into account the handling of exceptions, 
especially if their execution relates to the continuation of the 
composed service. The rest of this paper is organized as 
follows. Section II defines some related work. Section III 
presents our model called H-Service-Net. Section IV 
addresses the policies of handling exception with a 
demonstrative example. Section V presents the H-service-
editor tool, its architecture and usage.  Conclusions close the 
article. 
II. 
RELATED  WORK 
In the literature, several theories have been proposed to 
explain exception handling, which is a critical case in Web 
services, therefore, to have a consistent execution, it is 
essential to take into account exceptions. In service 
composition it is important to define the mechanism of 
handling exceptions in order to have a coherent and 
consistent composition even in the presence of exception. 
A number of approaches have been proposed to deal with 
exception handling in Web service composition. First, 
Caoqing et al. [1] describe the integration model which 
contains the normal process and exception handling logic 
based on Petri net integration technologies. The result shows 
that this model can realize formal modeling of exception 
handling in Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), 
and further provides support for analysis and verification of 
properties relating to exception handling.  A novel 
architecture for exception handling has been proposed by 
Thirumaran et al. [2] for focusing upon and verifying the 
manageability of a web  service. But this solution does not 
provide methods of handling exceptions, it only detects if an 
exception is manageable or not. The approach proposed by 
Wang et al. [3] describes the policy-based exception 
handling approach for BPEL processes, which is a new 
framework designed for exception handling in BPEL 
processes to provide a flexible language mechanism. The 
approach of Erradi et al. [5] proposes a set of extensible 
recovery policies to declaratively specify how to handle and 
recover from exception in Web services composition. The 
identified constructs were incorporated into a lightweight 
service management middleware named Manageable and 
Adaptive Service Composition (MASC) to transparently 
enact the fault management policies and facilitate the

monitoring. Hamadi et al. [4] propose Self-Adapting 
Recovery Net (SARN), an extended Petri net model, for 
specifying exceptional behavior in business processes. 
SARN adapts the structure of the underlying Petri net at run 
time to handle exceptions. The approach of Christos et al. [7] 
introduces 
the 
Service 
Relevance 
and 
Replacement 
Framework (SRRF) whose main concept is resolving 
exceptions by finding relevant Web tasks, exploiting 
qualitative and functional metadata semantics. Finally, Lau 
et al. [8] propose an approach to server-side exception 
handling 
by 
composite 
Web 
services 
that 
capture 
Unavailability and Time-out exceptions and provide Retry as 
recovery action, or Throw to propagate exceptions. 
Exception handling is generally tedious and error prone.  
The  issue  of  exception  handling has  not  been  carefully  
considered  in  existing  service composition  works [9].   
Although several studies have indicated that exception 
handling is critical, little attention has been given to time out 
exception.

H-SERVICE-NET: A TEMPORAL MODEL FOR WEB 
SERVICE COMPOSITION  
 
The H-Service-Net model (an  acronym  for  Hierarchical 
Service Net) is a time Petri net-based model. It allows the  
modeling  of  time-critical  aspects  in  the  field  of  Web 
Services. It allows incremental composition of services, as 
well as consistency checking after each modification. It 
introduces a new type of places named composite places. A 
composite place is an abstract place represented by a sub-
network, allowing a degree of independence between the 
parts of the H-Service-Net. Indeed, a composite or single 
place in H-Service -Net depends only on the subnet to which 
it belongs.  In other words, the modification of a component 
can affect its subnet or the subnets of the same hierarchy. 
This representation allows for incremental modeling of the 
H-Service-Net.  This  will  allow for  easy  correction  of  
errors,  an  exact  location  of  conflicts between the subnet 
elements and support rapid changes. Thus, the H-Service-Net 
model is well suited for modeling the synchronization 
constraints in a temporal scenario. As a result, it was chosen 
to model the composition of Web services. We present in 
what follows the different elements of the H-Service-Net 
model: 
A. Places in H-Service-Net    
There are two main types of places of H-Service-Net: 
simple and composite."  Then, Table I shows places in H-
SERVICE-NET, simple place are modeled by circle shape 
and composite place are modeled by triangle shape.

Description 
Ordinary  Place 
 
 
It models a basic element (Web 
service) and its execution time. 
 
Virtual Place 
 
 
It models a temporal constraint. 
 
Silent Place 
 
 
 
It models a place without any 
specific task, which is used to 
handle exceptions. 
Parallel 
Place 
 
 
 
It models a set of elements of the 
same 
group 
that 
operate 
simultaneously, which is used to 
model concurrent Web service. 
Sequential 
Place 
 
 
 
It models a sequence of elements of 
the same group that run in sequence. 
It is used to model sequential Web 
services. 
Root Place  
 
 
 
 
It represents the root of the global 
Petri net and behaves like a 
sequential composite place.   
Loop Place  
 
 
 
It is an element that runs in a loop 
and is used to model a recursive 
Web service. 
 
 
An H-Service-Net can be seen as a tree where the parallel 
and sequential composite places represent intermediate 
nodes, and atomic places associated with Web services are 
the leaves. 
B. Transitions in H-Service-Net 
An operation performed by a Web service is modeled by 
a transition. Table II shows transition in H-SERVICE-NET 
that define the different termination semantics : 
TABLE II.  
TRANSITIONS IN H-SERVICE-NET 
C.  Tokens and arcs in H-Service-Net 
H-Service-Net defines state tokens and exception tokens 
and there are two types of arcs in the model, then Table III 
shows tokens and arcs in H-Service-Net:

The modeling of Web services in H-Service-Net is given 
as follows: 
— 
A simple or atomic Web service is represented by 
an ordinary simple place. 
— 
A composite Web service is represented by a 
sequential, parallel or loop composite place. 
 
D. Example of the TimeOut policy: 
Let us consider the following scenario: 
A person wants to go on holiday, and wants to make a 
campsite for two days in a forest at the end of the holidays. 
Inclusive vacations are offered by a travel agency that can 
offer a composition of the following Web services for this 
request: 
Ws1, Ws6: two Web services of payment by credit card. 
Ws2: Visa Service. 
Ws3: Sales service ticket travel agency. 
Ws4, Ws5: two Services of booking rooms in two different 
hotels. 
 Figure 1 shows the time constraints (date) in the 
network H-Service-Net of the example. 
 
Figure 1.  Temporal Constraints in H-Service-Net for the example. 
For the modeling of these Web Services in a single H-
Service-Net, we add the following composite places:  
• 
The visa services ws2 and the sales service ticket 
travel agency ws4 can run in parallel, so we represent them 
in H-Service-Net by a parallel composite place P1.   
• 
The Web Services of booking rooms ws4 and ws5 
can run in parallel, so they are modeled in H-Service-Net by 
a parallel composite place P2. 
• 
The composite services P2 and Web Payment 
service banking ws6 are modeled with the sequential 
composite place S1. 
• 
The Composite services P1 and S1, and the Web 
Service Payment by credit card ws1 run in sequence, so we 
have modeled this set by the root place R. 
IV. 
SOLUTION TO TEMPORAL VIOLATIONS BY A 
HANDLING OF EXCEPTION 
Exception 
handling 
is 
critical in 
Web 
services 
composition. It is essential to consider exception handling 
for 
the 
robustness 
of 
the 
composition, 
especially if the exception relates to the continuation of the 
composition. 
In this section, we present the policies of exception 
handling in H-Service-Net. For each exception, a set of 
methods is executed to handle the exception. We were 
inspired by Rachid et al. [4] to define the methods of 
exception handling. Table IV shows all used methods: 
TABLE IV.  
BASIC OPERATIONS FOR EXCEPTION HANDLING 
Method 
Description 
CreatePlace(namews , type-
place, type-transitionIn, type-
transitionOut) 
Allows 
creating 
a 
simple 
or 
composed place with an input 
transition and output transition. 
CreateSilentPlace(nameSilentPla
ce , type-transitionIn, type-
transitionOut) 
Allows creating a silent place 
without any task between two types 
of transition. 
AddExceptionToken (place) 
Allows adding an exception token 
to a silent place. 
DisableWS(ws) 
Allows canceling the running Web 
service. 
AddTo(P, ws) 
Allows to add the place ws to the 
composed place P 
AddBefor (ws, ws’) 
Allows adding the place ws' before 
the place ws. 
AddAfter(ws, ws’) 
Allows adding the place ws' after 
the place ws. 
ReplacePlace( ws ,ws’) 
An existing place ws is replaced by 
another place ws'. 
RemoveToken(ws) 
A token of state is removed from 
the Web service ws. 
A. The TimeOut policy:  
In a Web service composition, both the client and the 
service provider may have temporal constraints in their 
interaction. For example, the service provider may cancel the 
service if it does not receive a response after a time T_max 
and similarly for the service requester. 
To handle the time out exception, each Web service is 
associated with a time limit T_max. If the execution of a 
Web service exceeds this time limit, a time-out exception is 
triggered. 
A policy of handling TimeOut (WebServiceWsTO, time 
T) exception is defined in Figure 2:

PSEUDO CODE 1. The TimeOut policy 
1. DisableWs(WsTO). //Cancels the Web service which 
reached the timeout.  
2. Compensate (WsTO) or RollBack (WsTO).  //Optional 
3. RepeatAfter(WsTO). //Repeat the Web service which 
has reached the timeout (defined in the next section). 
4. Compensate (WsTO) or Rollback (WsTO).  // Optional. 
5. RepeatAfter(WsTO, 2*T).// If another exception of time 
out is raised, Repeat the Web service till the doubling 
timeout expired. 
6. Compensate(WsTO) or Rollback (WsTO). // Optional 
7. OtherWS(TimeOut, WsTO, OtherWsTO). //If another 
exception of time out is raised, search another alternative 
service (defined in the next section). 
Figure 2.  Pseudocode of the TimeOut policy. 
 
In order to handle the time out exception, the Web 
service which has reached a timeout is cancelled. Then, the 
Web service is repeated using the RepeatAfter policy and if 
another timeout exception is captured Repeat the Web 
service until the doubling timeout expired and expect that the 
service will not miss this deadline with T = 2* T (by 
doubling the time out).   If this strategy does not work, the 
exception can be handled by calling another equivalent and 
compatible Web service. 
Compensate(WsTO) : undoes the effect of task execution 
result of the  Web service (WsTO). 
In compensation, information must be added in the 
SOAP header in order to define that the Web service can be 
compensated or not, <nsto :compensate enable= ―True‖ /> or 
<nsto :compensate enable= ―False‖ /> . 
 Rollback functionality RollBack (WsTO) is executed in 
the reverse order of their forward execution and rolled back 
to (WsTO) original state. 
 The difference between compensate and rollback is that 
compensate is a Forward Recovery and rollback is a 
Backward Recovery, compensation or rollback are not 
require in read-only Web service. 
 
Compensation is run on the service provider's side by a 
call to service. In our solution, compensation is considered as 
a service call cancellation 
If the temporal constraint assigned to the Web service is 
higher than the execution time of the timeout policy 
(RepeatAfter (Ws, T) + RepeatAfter (Ws, 2*T)) then all the 
timeout policy is executed. Otherwise if the temporal 
constraint is higher than the execution time of the 
RepeatAfter (Ws, T)  policy then only the stage one, two, 
three, four and seven are executed in order to satisfy the 
temporal constraint. In default only the stage one, two and 
seven are executed to handle the critical Web service. 
B. The RepeatAfter policy:  
When an exception event is captured, the policy of 
handling RepeatAfter allows to repeat the execution of a 
Web service after its execution. A policy of handling 
exception RepeatAfter (Exception e, WebServiceRepeatWs), 
when a corresponding event of exception e is captured is 
defined in Figure 3:  
PSEUDO CODE 2. The RepeatAfter policy 
1. CreateSilentPlace 
(S, 
simpleTransition, 
simpleTransition). // Create a silent place S between two 
simple transitions 
2. CreatePlace 
(Sra, 
Seq, 
simpleTransition, 
simpleTransition) // Create a new sequential composed 
place Sra between two simple transitions. 
3. ReplacePlace (RepeatWs, Sra). // Replace the composed 
place RepeatWs by the place Sra. 
4. RemoveToken (RepeatWs). // A token of state is 
removed from the place RepeatWs . 
5. AddExceptionToken (S). // Add an exception token to a 
silent place S. 
6. AddBefor (RepeatWs, S). // Add the place S before the 
repeated place RepeatWs and run the new H-service-net 
in order to handle the exception. 
Figure 3.  Pseudocode of the repeatAfter policy. 
C. The OtherWs policy 
 
The failure of a Web service Ws requires a search for 
another Web service OtherWs offering, at least, the same 
functionalities. The policy of handling OtherWs allows 
running another alternative Web service in case the Web 
service fails. 
A policy of handling of exception OtherWs (Exception e, 
WebServiceWs, WebServiceotherWs) when a corresponding 
event of exception e is captured is defined as in Figure 4:

PSEUDO CODE 3. The OtherWs policy 
1. DisableWs (Ws).  // Cancel the fail Web service Ws. 
2. CreatePlace 
(otherWs, 
simple, 
simpleTransition, 
simpleTransition). // Create a new place OtherWs 
between two simple transitions. 
3. RemoveToken (Ws). //Remove the token of state in the 
place Ws 
4. AddExceptionToken (otherWs). // Add a token of 
exception to the place otherWs.  
5. CreatePlace 
(So, 
seq, 
simpleTransition, 
simpleTransition) // Create a new composite place So 
between two sequential simple transitions 
6. ReplacePlace (Ws, So). // Replace the place Ws by the 
composite place So. 
7. AddTo (So, Ws). //Ajouter the service Web to be 
cancelled in the made up place So. 
8. AddAfter (Ws, otherWs) // Add after the place Ws the 
place otherWs and run the new H-service-net in order 
to handle the exception.  
Figure 4.  Pseudocode of the OtherWs policy. 
During the execution of the network in Figure 1, an 
exception of time out is raised from the flight ticket 
reservation service Ws3. In order to handle the TimeOut 
exception first, the Web service Ws3 is cancelled, and then a 
repetition of the same service is performed using the 
RepeatAfter policy and the network H-Service-Net will 
become like Figure 5. 
 
Figure 5.  H-Service-Net before the execution of RepeatAfter policy. 
After the execution of the RepeatAfter policy if another 
exception of time out is raised, the TimeOut policy calls 
another Web service using the OtherWS policy and the H-
Service-Net network will become as Figure 6. We note that 
during the execution of the exception, the token of 
exception has become a token of state. 
 
Figure 6.  H-Service-Net before the execution of OtherWS 
V. 
IMPLEMENTATION 
We developed H-Service-Editor to illustrate the viability 
of the proposed composition and exception handling 
techniques presented above. H-Service-Editor is a Web 
service 
composition 
modeling 
tool 
with 
simulation 
capability; it supports the creation of policies for handling 
exceptions through the System of handling exception as 
depicted in Figure 7. 
 
 
Figure 7.  Depicts a screen shot of H-Service-Editor 
The authoring environment offers different views that 
allow the composition of Web services and handling of 
exception. The different views are:  
— 
The graphical view: it displays the handling of 
exception for all the policies introduced in this article in the

form of H-Service-Net model. The user can view the 
different sequences and temporal relations between simple or 
composite Web services before and after the manipulation. 
— 
XML View: it displays the composition file of the 
handling of exception in the Extensible Markup Language 
(XML)  standard format document 
— 
The hierarchical view: It allows the representation 
of services composition in the form of a tree structure. The 
different services are represented in this area by hierarchical 
structures similar to the H-Service-Net. 
— 
Error message view: if any temporal conflict is 
found, the tool displays an error message in order to offer 
earliest error detection within the editing process of handling 
exception. 
 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE 
In order to complete the H-Service-Net model, we have 
proposed to apply to the H-Service-Net model a 
manipulation of exception in a hierarchical way. This allows 
an easy management of time out exception while 
maintaining the fundamental design of Petri net simple and 
easy. 
Finally, an application (H-Service-Editor tool) of the 
proposed approach is presented for the modeling of all the 
policies of handling exception based on our model. 
Until now the policies of handling exception are executed 
manually. The next stage of our research will be to automate 
the execution of the policies. Further research is needed to 
consolidate this approach.
