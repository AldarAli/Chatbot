Abstract— This paper reports ongoing work in the 
development of self-aware artificial general intelligence, called 
Nature-inspired Humanoid Cognitive Computing Platform for 
Self-aware and Conscious Agent (NiHA). It is based on a 
quantum and bio-inspired cognitive architecture for machine 
consciousness and artificial intelligence. So far, a number of 
different cognitive features have been implemented to help 
facilitate the realization of NiHA. These implemented features 
include imaginations, dreams, personal semantics, psycho-
psychological based motivations and ethics. Apart from these, 
some industrial applications are also underway. The review of 
the results obtained from these applications is encouraging and 
supports the potential to achieve a certain level of 
consciousness.

 INTRODUCTION 
Recent years have witnessed exceptional progress in the 
field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Machine 
Consciousness (MC). Considering the current pace of 
technological evolution, it is envisaged by some that in the 
future, machines will become self-aware and even 
potentially become part of a man-machine society. The idea 
of implementing consciousness in machines is thus not new 
[1]-[5]. It does, however, raise several philosophical and 
computational issues [5]-[7]. Addressing these issues 
requires the unification of different knowledge domains such 
as physical sciences, neuroscience, psychology, and 
computer sciences [8].  Consequently, it has resulted in the 
establishment of computational theories of the mind [8]-[11], 
and domains which include both bio-inspired [11] and 
quantum-inspired methods [8][12]-[17]. Various researchers 
have contributed to the construction of computational 
equivalent of the human mind/brain [7]-[8][18]-[24].  In this 
regard, several projects have been initiated which include the 
Blue Brain Project [25]; the Human Brain Project [26]; 
DARPA and the Brain Initiative [27]. In addition to these 
projects, there have been recent corporate efforts by the likes 
of Google [28]-[30], Facebook [31]-[34], and IBM [35].  
A roadmap for addressing the challenges of bio-inspired 
modeling is shown in Figure 1. One of the most challenging 
of these is getting humans to accept them as co-workers 
(socio-cognitive agents) [11][36]. 
 
 
 
Figure 1 - Roadmap for the Bio-inspired Challenge [11] 
 
From the roadmap, it can be seen that these socio-
cognitive agents must be capable of producing believable 
conscious-like behavior and a sense of their presence in 
their human co-workers [11]. The benefit of such behavior 
is clear when considering socio-assistive robots, domestic 
robots, and personal robots. Examples of such machines 
acting as co-workers have long appeared in entertainment

films (for example, ‘Geminoid F’ an actoroid, acted in the 
film ‘Sayônara, 2015’), and more recently a robot named 
Sophia, was awarded citizenship by Saudi Arabia [37]. 
Moreover, significant work has been done in the form of 
cognitive computing which includes IDA [9], LIDA [38], 
WATSON [35], CLARION [39], SIRI [40] and CORTANA 
[41].  
Although current progress is encouraging, there are still 
many issues that need to be addressed before reaching the 
point where it can be claimed that the presence of 
phenomenal consciousness [7] in machines has been 
achieved. Simply to achieve functional consciousness [7] 
the agent must demonstrate voluntary control of attention, 
intention, action selection, motivation, goal-setting abilities, 
emotional intelligence, and self-regulation along with 
communication capability utilizing the cognitive constructs 
listed earlier [11].  
One of the critical factors to help facilitate the 
implementation of the aforementioned is the selection of an 
appropriate modeling technique. Current literature suggests 
that there are two approaches for such modeling. These are a 
hierarchical and non-hierarchical approach [42], where a 
hierarchical model treats consciousness as a single reality 
with different levels of depth and a non-hierarchical model 
treats consciousness as a self-organizing multiplicity of 
embodied states (this allows the emergence of intelligence 
which is greater than the sum of its information).  
Non-hierarchical methods can be used for modeling 
emergent 
artificial 
general 
intelligence 
[42], 
while 
hierarchical methods can be used for modeling a cognitive 
system 
comprised 
of multiple complex 
subsystems 
interacting together in synergy to generate conscious 
behaviors [42]. Both approaches have strengths and 
weaknesses. Keeping in mind the limitations of both 
methods, one of the successful methods for modeling is 
hybrid. The hybrid approach allows the modeling of higher 
abstraction in a hierarchical fashion. The functional level of 
these abstractions consists of subsystems that may operate 
according to the different paradigms. The hybrid approach 
seems to be the most promising as it ameliorates the 
deficiencies associated with the other methods. 
Apart from bio-inspired modeling discussed above, this 
study also takes into account quantum inspiration. There are 
a number of school of thought associated with quantum 
inspiration explaining the functioning of brain/mind, 
consciousness, and intelligence. The reason for taking into 
account quantum inspiration is that the Universe is governed 
by the laws of nature [43]. The brain, mental processes 
along with other biological reactions, physical realities from 
quantum to classical world, computation, are all part of 
nature. If the Universe is quantum mechanical then mental 
processes can be described using quantum theories [43] and 
the mysteries of the brain, mental processes, and emergence 
of consciousness can be due to quantum processes or 
quantum computations [14][44]-[46].  
Quantum mechanics is the study of subatomic particles 
that 
possess 
features 
such 
as 
superposition 
and 
entanglement, and the computation performed on them is 
referred 
to 
as 
quantum 
computation. 
Analysis 
of 
interpretations of quantum mechanics suggests that it has 
the 
computational/mathematical 
potential 
to 
model 
cognition/consciousness. There are different schools of 
thought on this issue, namely: (i) quantum mind/ 
consciousness, (ii) quantum cognition, (iii) quantum 
artificial intelligence. 
Quantum consciousness assumes that the brain works on 
the principles of both neural and quantum computations 
[14][43][44][47]-[50]. 
Quantum 
cognition 
does 
not 
explicitly discuss the involvement of quantum mechanics in 
the function of the brain at the physical level [51]-[53].  
Rather this paradigm acknowledges the mathematical and 
abstraction strength of quantum mechanics to model human 
memory, knowledge representation issues, perception, 
decision making and reasoning process. There are a number 
of useful references that expound this school of thought 
[15][16][54]-[58] which uses quantum inspired neural 
networks, quantum Bayes network and other quantum 
cognition algorithm to model complex human mental 
facilities. In contrast to quantum consciousness, quantum 
artificial intelligence is about transforming existing artificial 
intelligence algorithms to make them work on quantum 
computers [12][13]. 
The existence of consciousness in machines can be 
evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative methods. 
Qualitative analysis can be performed using Aleksander’s 
axioms of conscious [59]. Qualitative analyses using 
Aleksander’s Axiomatic postulates that an agent having 
depiction, imagination, attention, volition, and emotion may 
possess some kind of conscious activity [59]. Moreover, the 
quantitative analysis includes Quantum Mutual Information 
(QMI) and ConsScale method [60]-[63]. QMI is a method 
that was developed to determine the correlation between the 
subsystems of two quantum states where these states are not 
pure states [8]. ConsScale is a characterization mechanism 
for the evaluation of consciousness in an agent [61].  
Moreno originally proposed ConsScale [61], a method 
that was later improved upon [62][63], as the reference 
method for analysis of the correlation between cognitive and 
conscious capability. ConsScale mainly evaluates an agent 
based on its behavior and architecture [62]. 
Following the legacy of the aforementioned studies, 
project 
NiHA 
(Nature-inspired 
Humanoid 
Cognitive 
Computing Platform for Self-aware and Conscious Agent) 
was initiated. In this paper, NiHA is introduced as an entity 
with a limited level of consciousness and general 
intelligence. The design and implementation strategy are 
also articulated and the results acquired so far presented. 
The results are encouraging and suggest that NiHA may 
possess a certain level of consciousness. This does not 
imply that NiHA is fully conscious or that it possesses 
human-level of phenomenology or general intelligence, 
neither do the authors intend to claim such. Indeed, NiHA is 
an attempt to explore the possibility of designing and 
implementing an artifact that falls under the domain of 
machine consciousness and artificial general intelligence.  
In this paper, Section II details NiHA’s architecture, 
Section III deals with its applications and functionality,

Section IV describes the test of consciousness, and Section 
IV documents the results and discussion.   
II. 
NATURE-INSPIRED HUMANOID COGNITIVE 
COMPUTING PLATFORM FOR SELF-AWARE AND CONSCIOUS 
AGENT (NIHA) 
NiHA is based on previous work related to the unified 
theory of the mind, ‘Quantum & Bio-inspired Intelligent & 
Consciousness Architecture (QuBIC)’ (see Figure 2) and on 
the code-base of an agent called Johi [8].  
A. Cognitive Architecture (QuBIC) of NiHA 
The cognitive architecture of NiHA is constructed in 
layers (see Figure 2). The first layer consists of physical 
components, while the second layer comprises of mental 
processes. The physical layer consists of sensors and 
actuators. 
The 
mental 
regime 
further 
consists 
of 
unconscious and conscious layers.  . The unconscious layer 
consists of several cognitive units working together in order 
to regulate the involuntary and pre-programmed tasks that 
are essential requirements for the agent’s self-regulation and 
optimum performance. The modules of the conscious layer 
are responsible for awareness, attention, intention and 
voluntary tasks. The conscious layer serves as the executive 
control of the mind and the functional description of the 
whole architecture is discussed in [8].  
i. 
Memory Units 
 
 
Unconscious components consist of several modules; 
these include memory systems, circadian clock, implicit 
behavior center, reflexes, decision action center, deed 
assessment module, seed knowledge, memory management, 
drives, and a synchronization unit. 
a) Sensory Memory 
Sensory Memory is responsible for the storage of sensory 
inputs coming from external and internal sensors. Sensed 
contents are collected in the implicit knowledge repository. 
Sensory processes apply basic filters to the sensory contents. 
The filters include those responsible for resizing the 
incoming image stream, encoding the stream as required and 
applying part-of-speech-tagger on the lingual contents. These 
sensory contents are then transferred to various unconscious 
modules as per the connections shown in Figure 2. 
b) Perceptual Associative Memory 
A copy of processed sensory contents is received by the 
Perceptual Associative Memory (PAM). PAM is responsible 
for the formation of an association between objects based on 
recognition, perception, and classification. Information is 
encoded for further processing, using structural and semantic 
analysis and collaboration between Short-Term Memory 
(STM) and Working Memory (WM). The percepts are then 
transferred to conscious memory system for further 
processing.

COGNITIVE 2018 : The Tenth International Conference on Advanced Cognitive Technologies and Applications

c)   Decision Execution Center 
The Decision Execution Center (DEC) consists of both 
conscious and unconscious components. It actually acts as a 
procedural memory. This unit consists of “how to perform a 
task” information which is needed mainly for motor actions. 
d) Short-term Memory 
Short-Term Memory (STM) receives and examines 
contents from PAM to determine what requires attention 
through a process called ‘selective attention’. The content, 
which does not get attention, is forgotten when short-term 
memory overflow occurs or content’s signal is decayed. This 
selective attention process acts as a gateway between 
unconscious and conscious layers, resulting in an awareness 
of sensory contents. 
e) Working Memory 
Working Memory (WM) is responsible for the 
manipulation and processing of information during the 
course of the cognitive process. WM consists of the central 
executive that is supported by visual memory (which process 
visual content) and spatial memory (contains the spatial 
maps and information about size and location of content). 
ii. 
Long-term Memories 
Long-Term Memory (LTM) holds the information for 
longer periods. LTM is composed of episodic and semantic 
memories. The episodic memory contains the information 
related to the agent’s experience of particular events, while 
the semantic memory contains the record of meanings, facts, 
and knowledge related to objects. 
iii. 
Circadian Clock, Monitoring and  Control 
The Circadian Clock (CC) triggers several high-level 
and low-level drives (and ensures the optimal performance 
of an agent), while the Circadian Monitoring and Control 
(CMC) units safeguard the activities by maintaining the 
threshold levels. CMC also protect various conscious and 
unconscious cognitive modules from malfunctioning. 
iv. 
Seed Knowledge 
One of the major challenges when modeling artificial 
general intelligence is to implement safe artificial 
intelligence. Seed knowledge acts as apriori knowledge 
implemented at design time. This provides ethical norms 
and a set of rules that try to ensure “safe” artificial 
intelligence. To date, a conceptual knowledge base has been 
designed but not yet implemented [64]. This knowledge-
base contains information relating to ethical values, laws 
related to daily life, rules regarding social etiquette and an 
understanding of the difference between right and wrong. 
Seed knowledge has already been implemented in NiHA [8] 
[64]. 
v. 
Deed Assessment Module 
The Deed Assessment Module (DAM) acts as the “inner 
self” and assesses performance with regard to the guidelines 
available as seed knowledge. Conscious and unconscious 
activities are regulated in the DAM based on predefined 
parameters and evolved knowledge. 
vi. 
Emotions 
The Emotion Module regulates and influences the 
rational decisions based on basic emotions [65]. The 
emotions are extracted from the facial expression of a 
human interacting with NiHA. The extracted expressions 
are then used for the regulation of decisions. 
vii. 
Meta-cognition 
Meta-cognition performs a regulatory role of managing 
several conscious and unconscious modules. These modules 
perform 
numerous tasks 
i.e. 
memory 
management, 
evaluation, emotion modulation, synchronization between 
conscious and unconscious modules, learning management 
and goal setting. 
viii. 
Behavioral and Motivational System 
The Behavioral System is responsible for generating 
implicit and explicit behaviors in the agent based on current 
context and experiences. The Motivational System [67], 
inspired by the work of Manzotti [66], generates 
motivations in an agent in the form of goals. These goals  
are then used to take desired actions, along with what and 
how the task will be done.  
ix. 
Dreams 
Dreams are the most important cognitive unit. It is 
responsible for memory consolidation, the evolution of 
ideas, and creativity through the manipulation of known 
objects. The first stage of Dreams (i.e. memory 
consolidation) has been implemented in NiHA [68], and is 
based on Quantum Neural Network and Quantum Genetic 
Algorithm. 
x. 
Imagination 
Imagination is the manifestation of scenarios that are not 
directly present to the sensors. The first stage of its 
implementation in NiHA had the goal of emulating the 
imagination of a young child. Studies suggest that young 
children only understand simple sentences.   Imaginations 
implemented to date simulate psychological aspects 
comparable with that of a four-year-old child [69]-[70].  
Further exploration in this area is in progress. 
B. Design Rationale & Implementation Philosophy 
The design and implementation principles that have been 
utilized are based on ConsScale guidelines [60][62][63]. 
According to these, every conscious agent must possesses 
mental processes and a physical or simulated body. The 
mental processes in NiHA are based on QuBIC. Currently, 
the mental processes have been interfaced with a simulated 
iCub robot [71]. The simulated iCub runs on a laptop 
mounted on an iCreate robot platform along with Microsoft 
Kinect sensor and is collectively known as NiHA’s body. 
Moreover, the integration of the Allison humanoid robot 
with NiHA is underway. 
The motivation behind this study is to address a number 
of philosophical and design issues not taken into account 
previously. These issues are associated with quantum-

inspired 
modeling, 
synchronization 
of 
autonomous 
functions through the circadian clock, imaginations, dreams, 
personal semantics, and psychophysiological regulation of 
drives through the modeling of insulin and glucose 
interplay, seed knowledge including deed assessments. 
Further details on these features are documented in [8][70] 
The quantum inspiration is based on methods from quantum 
cognition and quantum artificial intelligence. 
The aforementioned features are complex systems and 
depended on one another as shown in Figure 1. Therefore, 
modeling of such systems requires the implementation of 
the cognitive architectural framework, together with a set of 
cognitive processes, cognitive cycles, and representation 
schemes [72]. The cognitive processes and cycles are 
inspired from pandemonium theory [1], feature-integration 
theory [73], unified theory of an artificial mind, global 
workspace theory [74] and QuBIC architectural model [8]. 
The neural correlates of the architectural model are 
summarized in [75]. These features were implemented 
separately due to computational and design complexity and 
are yet to be integrated into the architectural framework 
(moreover, some are still at the conceptual stage). The 
overall design and implementation was service oriented. 
These 
modules 
are 
implemented 
using 
different 
programming languages and run on Windows and Ubuntu 
platforms. Further details are provided in the ‘languages and 
tools’ section. 
C. Cognitive Processes and Codelets 
The pandemonium theory suggests the presence of 
demons (mini-agents) in the mind, working in synergy to 
perform various cognitive tasks in parallel [1]. These 
cognitive tasks may range from simple identification of 
objects to learning and to execution of complex sensory 
motor controls. Generally, these demons are called codelets 
in cognitive computing domain [2][76][77]. According to 
the pandemonium theory, these codelets are an independent 
set of programs working in parallel to process incoming 
signals. Therefore, each of these codelets has well-defined 
responsibility and executes continuously and cyclically. 
Further 
details 
on 
codelets 
and 
their 
standard 
implementation and guidelines are available in [2][76][77]. 
In NiHA, the codelets were implemented as proxies to 
the actual implementation of the code in QuBIC 
architectural framework. The actual implementations are 
either in the form of C#’s tasks from ‘Task Parallel Library’ 
(TPL) [78] or services implemented running as nodes on the 
network. Implementation of these codelets as TPL-tasks or 
services was determined based on response time and the 
programming language in which they were coded. Cognitive 
processes with short running time and programmed using 
C# were developed as TPL-tasks. Cognitive tasks, which 
were implemented on different platforms or had large 
execution time, for example learning codelets, were 
implemented as services. This division is simply a rule of 
thumb, and in order to keep cognitive optimization, 
variations can be made as per requirement and future need. 
Table 1 summarizes the list of codelets in NiHA.

Conceptually, each codelet is a part of the codelet eco-
system running on top of a cognitive module. As shown in 
Figure 3, a set of codelets are working on the contents of 
workspace module. These codelets are pre-programmed for 
specific tasks, for example, the conversational codelet 
generates a potential response after processing the lingual 
contents from the workspace. In parallel to this, the tagging 
codelet tags the current mental state with the prevailing 
positive and negative emotions. Responses from various 
codelets are compiled together by the underlying modules as 
chunks. These chunks are then broadcasted to relevant 
modules for further processing.

D. Tools and Languages used for Implementation 
 
The following programming languages were used: C#, 
Java, Python, and C++. The high-level abstraction of 
NiHA’s design is shown in Figure 4. The cognitive structure 
(QuBIC architectural framework) is written in C# using 
service-oriented programming. The service orientation is 
done using Apache Thrift, ROS.NET and YARP.NET.  
Apache thrift was used as the primary tool for implementing 
network computing between various services in the 
framework. ROS.NET is used where communication 
between modules written in C# and Robotic Operating 
System (ROS) is required.  
 
 
 
Figure 4 - Proposed NiHA Cloud 
 
The software framework (YARP) for the iCub robot is 
written in C++ and YARP.NET is a wrapper/binder to 
interface YARP with C# code, which was acquired after 
compiling the YARP C++ code using SWIG. Python is used 
for natural language processing. Accord.NET and EmguCV 
are used for computer vision support and Accord.NET for 
audio 
processing. 
The 
conversation 
module 
was 
implemented using the Artificial Intelligence Markup 
Language (AIML). Weka.NET is used for machine learning 
support and MaryTTS for text to speech processing. Neo4j 
is a graph database used for the implementation of episodic 
and semantic structures. Moreover, quantum computations 
are performed using an in-house developed quantum 
computing library written in C# (see download section of 
the official NiHA website [79]).  
E. Application and Functioning of NiHA 
The current implementation allows NiHA to have 
general communication with a human operator. Moreover, it 
can play the popular paper-scissor-rock game. It can also 
construct an artistic work through storytelling processing 
utilizing imagination codelets. Moreover, it can construct 
short dreams using annotated images placed in the memory 
system.  Details of the implementation of these applications 
and functioning will be published in the future but related 
video demonstrations are already available to be reviewed 
[79]. 
III. 
TEST FOR CONSCIOUSNESS 
The objective of this paper is to report on progress to 
date on constructing NiHA, an agent that currently has 
limited consciousness and general intelligence. The 
presence of a certain amount of consciousness in an agent 
can be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative analyses. 
Qualitative methods include Aleksander’s Axioms [59] and   
the quantitative methods,  Quantum Mutual Information 
(QMI) [8] and ConsScale [63].  
A. Aleksander and Dunmall (ADM) Axioms 
Aleksander and Dunmall, based on neuroscience studies, 
articulated the necessary properties for an agent to have 
indications of its own existence [59]. In this section, NiHA 
is assessed to determine its level of  consciousness. 
i. 
Depiction 
Depiction is the mechanism of bringing the perceptual 
experiences into awareness. NiHA is able to formulate 
meaning from sensory information. The visual and auditory 
cues generate selective awareness about the existence and 
movement of the object(s) in an environment. Similarly, the 
acoustic cue in NiHA reacts by generating appropriate 
replies. According to Gamez [23], the integration of various 
perceptual signals give the sensation of something, that is 
out there and consequently, qualify the possibility of the 
depiction of an agent. The depiction is achieved in NiHA 
via the collaborative work of numerous codelets. 
ii. 
Imagination 
As mentioned earlier, in NiHA imagination is 
implemented in the form of the collaborative work of 
several codelets. So, NiHA can be credited with the 
existence of imagination in its primary form. Aspects of 
storytelling have been chosen for its initial development 
[69][70]. Moreover, NiHA is able to generate sensations and 
future aspects of known and unknown objects in the absence 
of any sensory information. 
iii. 
Attention 
The bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism is 
implemented in NiHA. The recall represents the top-down 
attention when signals are generated in working memory 
from long-term or medium-term memory, whereas signals 
coming from perceptual memory represent bottom-up 
attention. 
iv. 
Volition 
NiHA plans and simulates its actions before applying 
them to the environment and regulates them by means of its 
emotional state. 
v. 
Emotions 
Emotions play a vital role in manipulating the generation 
of goals and motivations. The Emotional Block, in NiHA, 
83

COGNITIVE 2018 : The Tenth International Conference on Advanced Cognitive Technologies and Applications

influences the effects of drives, decision-making, and 
planning. This block consists of six basic emotions [65]. 
Axiomatic 
analysis 
advocates 
the 
possibility 
of 
consciousness in NiHA. Moreover, the axioms suggest that 
the consciousness can be measured by evaluation of 
minimum mutual information exchange between cognitive 
blocks. 
B. Quantum Mutual Information 
Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) is used to measure 
the correlation between several sub-systems where the 
quantum states are not pure. Cognitive blocks can be 
represented as quantum states. This correlation represents 
the level of consciousness.  For experimental analysis, the 
selected states are Working Memory (WM) and Perceptual 
Associative Memory (PAM). 
i. 
Analysis 1 
Signals were transmitted from the Sensory Memory 
block to the Perceptual Associative Memory block, the 
NiHA was supposed to get the awareness of conscious 
stream between various unconscious blocks. 
ii. 
Analysis 2 
Signals were transmitted from unconscious block 
(Perceptual Associative Memory) to conscious clock 
(Working Memory and Medium-term Memory) where 
NiHA was expected to get the attention of the memory 
contents. 
iii. 
Analysis 3 
Signals were transmitted from Working Memory to the 
Workspace and Medium-term Memory, where NiHA was 
supposed to get aware of the memory contents.  
C. ConsScale 
ConsScale was proposed by Moreno [61] and later 
matured [62][63] for the characterization of consciousness 
in an agent. The correlation between cognitive and 
conscious skills are being measured on the basis of 
Cumulative Levels Score (CLS) and ConsScale Quantitative 
Score (CQS).  The levels of consciousness in ConsScales 
range from 0 to 11, from disembodied to super-human. The 
evaluation is mainly based on its architectural framework 
and behavior. 
IV. 
RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
The experiments have been performed on NiHA to 
analyze its conscious activity. In this regard, using signals 
transmitted from the unconscious region to the conscious 
region, signal analysis to determine level of consciousness 
were carried out using Quantum Mutual Information (QMI) 
sharing. Measuring of mutual information sharing is an 
established practice [23]. 
i. 
Analysis 1 
NiHA did not show any conscious activity between 
unconscious blocks. 
ii. 
Analysis 2 
The analysis was performed on the contents being shared 
between Perceptual Associate Memory (PAM) and 
Medium-term Memory (MTM), similarly between PAM 
and Working Memory (WM). This resulted in conscious 
activity (see Figure 5). These results were recorded for 
1,000 circadian clock cycles against 25 sample streams. The 
level of mutual information sharing shown in Figure 5 
represents the level of consciousness recorded at different 
data sample points. The x-axis represents the sample 
number and the y-axis represents the level of consciousness 
in terms of mutual information sharing. 
 
 
 
Figure 5 - Conscious activity between Perceptual Associative Memory 
and Working Memory [8]. The x-axis represents the sample number and Y-
axis represents the conscious level in that sample. 
iii. 
Analysis 3 
The analysis was performed between conscious modules. 
These modules were Working Memory, Workspace, and 
Medium-term Memory. The consciousness level obtained 
between these modules is shown in Figure 6.

Workspace [8]. The x-axis represents the sample number and Y-axis 
represents the conscious level in that sample. 
 
iv. 
ConsScale based Evaluation of NiHA 
ConsScale was also applied in order to further clarify the 
class of consciousness which NiHA possess, given the 
current state of its implementation. A Cumulative Levels 
Score (CLS) of 1.27 and a ConsScale Quantitative Score 
(CQS) of 2.94 were obtained.

Figure 7 - ConsScale Evaluation Method for NiHA 
 
The ConsScale result is summarized in Figure 7. It 
suggests that NiHA achieves a 3 on the 11 levels scale. It 
further proposes that by design NiHA is computationally 
equivalent to adaptive species, and therefore it still requires 
a lot of developmental work before anywhere close to 
achieving human level of consciousness. 
V. 
CONCLUSION 
The study reports an ongoing work in the development 
of NiHA which is based on the QuBIC architecture. NiHA 
is composed of several success stories, cognitive memories, 
dreams, imagination, machine ethics and socio-cognitive 
capabilities and other blackboard-like projects. Results 
obtained from various isolated studies imply that NiHA (as 
the extension of Johi) has a certain degree consciousness. 
The qualitative analyses suggest that all necessary 
conceptual and theoretical ingredients required to model a 
conscious agent are present.  The quantitative analyses using 
quantum mutual information sharing suggests that at certain 
points in the signal stream, conscious activity was 
registered. This indeed supports the presence of a minimum 
level of consciousness. Furthermore, analysis using 
ConsScale suggested that this presence of consciousness can 
be classified as computationally equivalent to level 3 
species.
