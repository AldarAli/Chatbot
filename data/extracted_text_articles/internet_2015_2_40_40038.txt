Abstract—In this study, we compare Japanese and English tweets
submitted to Twitter and discuss how we use unsounded code
strings at the end of online messages. We ﬁrst deﬁne unsounded
codes and unsounded code strings used in Japanese and English
text. Next, we compare and discuss the usage of unsounded code
strings at the end of Japanese and English tweets, especially,
to general public and particular persons. Finally, we show the
receiver of a tweet, whether general public or a particular person,
is a factor that affects the usage of unsounded code strings at
the end of Japanese and English tweets. Speciﬁcally, Japanese
speakers use unsounded code strings at the end of tweets more
frequently to particular persons than to general public while
English speakers do not.
Keywords–unsounded code string; Twitter; general public; par-
ticular persons; non verbal communication.

INTRODUCTION
Many of us think that it is easy to understand the meanings
of non verbal expressions in online messages even if different
language speakers generate them. However, the usage differs
between different language speakers and the difference is at
risk of bringing unnecessary frictions between them. As a
result, it is important to consider the difference, especially, in
multilingual computer-mediated communication (CMC) sys-
tems. In this study, we show the usage of unsounded code
strings, one kind of non verbal expression, differs between
Japanese and English speakers and discuss a factor that affects
the usage of them.
We often ﬁnd consecutive unsounded marks and characters
are used at the end of online messages, such as mails, chattings,
and tweets in Twitter.

(exp 1) and (exp 2) are tweets submitted to Twitter. (exp
1) was submitted by an user who chose English as his/her
language for tweets. On the other hand, (exp 2) was submitted
by an user who chose Japanese as his/her language for tweets.
Both (exp 1) and (exp 2) have consecutive unsounded marks
at the end of them. These unsounded marks are used for
smooth communication. The submitter of (exp 1) is thought
to use the three consecutive exclamation marks for expressing
his/her impression strongly. On the other hand, the submitter
of (exp 2) is thought to use the seven consecutive periods
for expressing his/her opinion softly. In this study, we deﬁne
unsounded marks and characters as unsounded codes. Further-
more, we deﬁne three or more consecutive unsounded codes
as a unsounded code string. For example, in Twitter, 14 % of
Japanese tweets and 10 % of English tweets have unsounded
code strings at the end of them. Although unsounded code
strings are popular, there are few studies on them. As a result,
in this study, we investigate how we use unsounded code
strings at the end of tweets in Twitter. Especially, we compare
Japanese and English tweets in Twitter and discuss a factor
that affects the usage of unsounded code strings at the end
of tweets. The results of this study will give us a chance to
understand the usage of unsounded code strings and improve
multilingual CMC systems.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section
II, we survey the related works. In Section III, we deﬁne
unsounded code strings and describes how they are used at
the end of tweets in Twitter. Finally, in Section IV, we present
our conclusions.

RELATED WORKS
There are a considerable number of studies comparing
speakers of various languages from various viewpoints, such
as, pragmatics, cognitive science, and so on. These studies can
be classiﬁed into two types:
•
studies comparing native speakers of one language to
non-native speakers of the same language
•
studies comparing native speakers of one language to
native speakers of other language directly
This study is classiﬁed into the latter. It is because we compare
unsounded code strings in Japanese tweets to those in English
tweets directly.
In pragmatics, a considerable number of studies have
been made on interlanguage speech acts, such as, expressing
compliments [1], apologies [2], gratitude [3], politeness [4],
and refusals [5]. In these studies, native speakers of one
language were compared to non-native speakers of the same
language. Also, there are a considerable number of studies
comparing pauses and backchannels of native speakers to those
of non-native speakers. Backchannels are listener’s responses,
such as “uh-huh” and “yeah”, given while someone else
is talking, to show an interest, attention, or willingness to
keep listening. Deschamps investigated how French learners of
English made pauses in their English speeches [6]. Bil´a and
D˘zambov´a investigated the function of silent pauses in native
and non-native speakers of English and German [7]. Ishizaki
investigated how English, French, Chinese and Korean learners
of Japanese and native Japanese speakers made pauses in their
Japanese speeches [8]. Tavakoli reported that the location of
pauses is important in comparisons of native speakers and

foreign learners [9]. Okazawa reported that native Japanese
speakers paused roughly twice as often in their English utter-
ances than in their Japanese utterances [10]. LoCastro reported
that Japanese speakers often feel uncomfortable when speak-
ing English because they are unable to use the appropriate
backchannels [11]. From the viewpoint of cognitive science,
Tera et al. compared and analyzed reading processes of native
Japanese speakers and foreign learners of Japanese [12].
On the other hand, there are also a considerable number of
studies comparing native speakers of one language to native
speakers of other language directly. Especially, many studies
have been made on backchannels. It is because backchan-
nels are found in various languages. Maynard showed that
backchannel phenomena for Japanese and English differ in
terms of type, frequency, and context [13]. Miller reported
that Japanese speakers use backchannels more frequently
than English speakers [14]. However, in most of previous
studies, the frequency of backchannels were observed in
various situations while little is known about factors that
affect the frequency of backchannels. Chen pointed out that
it is important to investigate factors that affect the frequency
of backchannels and took White’s work [15] for example
[16]. White reported that Americans used backchannels more
frequently in conversations with Japanese than in conversations
with other Americans [15]. In other words, the conversation
partner, whether American or Japanese, is a factor that affects
the frequency of Americans’ backchannels. As a result, when
we compare different language speakers, it is important to
investigate factors providing different responses between them.
In this study, we investigate a factor that affects the usage of
unsounded code strings at the end of tweets.

UNSOUNDED CODE STRINGS AT THE END OF
JAPANESE AND ENGLISH TWEETS IN TWITTER
In this section, we compare and discuss the usage of
unsounded code strings at the end of Japanese and English
tweets. In Section III-A, we deﬁne unsounded code strings
and show how they are used at the end of tweets. In Section
III-B, we show the investigation object of this study. Finally,
in Section III-C, we compare Japanese and English tweets
and discuss a factor that affects the usage of unsounded code
strings at the end of tweets.
A. The deﬁnition of an unsounded code string
First, we deﬁne unsounded codes and unsounded code
strings. In this study, we deﬁne that an unsounded code string
is three or more consecutive unsounded codes. In this study,
unsounded codes in English text are limited to
•
punctuation marks (e.g. !#$%&.,:;<=>?@ (){}).
On the other hand, unsounded codes in Japanese text are
limited to the following marks and characters:
•
punctuation marks,
•
Greek characters,
•
Cyrillic characters, and
•
ruled lines.
It is because these marks and characters are generally un-
sounded when they are used at the end of Japanese sentences.
Next, we show how unsounded code strings are used at the
end of tweets. Twitter users often use unsounded code strings
in order to enable anyone to understand their tweets clearly
and avoid unnecessary frictions with others.

homework doooooooooooone!!!!!!!!!!)

For example, the submitters used exclamation marks consec-
utively at the end of (exp 3) and (exp 4) for expressing their
feelings strongly. On the other hand, the submitter used periods
consecutively at the end of (exp 5) for expressing his/her
impression softly.
We may note that there are some submission constraints
in Twitter. For example, Twitter users are prohibited to post
the same tweets repeatedly. To avoid this constraint, some
users use unsounded code strings. For example, (exp 6), (exp
7), and (exp 8) were posted consecutively in a few seconds
to a particular user, ssuzuki16, beyond the limit of repeated
submission.

(exp 7)
@ssuzuki16 yo....
(exp 8)

B. The investigation object
We obtained tweets by using the streaming API. However,
the streaming API allows us to obtain only 1% of all public
streamed tweets because of API restriction. We used the
streaming API and obtained the following tweets in three
weeks in November and December 2012.
•
7,085,267 tweets submitted by users who chose
Japanese as their language for tweets. In this study,
we call these tweets Japanese tweets.
•
31,253,241 tweets submitted by users who chose En-
glish as their language for tweets. In this study, we
call these tweets English tweets.
Table I shows the number of the obtained Japanese and English
tweets. These tweets can be classiﬁed into three types:

Figure 1. A reply is submitted to a particular user.
Figure 2. A normal tweet is submitted to general public.
•
reply
A reply is submitted to a particular user (Figure 1). It
contains “@username” in the body of the tweet. For
example, (exp 2) and (exp 4) are replies.
•
retweet
A retweet is a reply to a tweet that includes the original
tweet.
•
normal tweet
A normal tweet is neither reply nor retweet. For
example, (exp 1), (exp 3), and (exp 5) are normal
tweets. Twitter users generally submit their tweets to
general public. As a result, most of normal tweets are
submitted to general public (Figure 2).
From the obtained Japanese tweets, we extracted 966,187
Japanese tweets that have unsounded code strings at the end
of them. These 966,187 Japanese tweets are 13.64% of all
the Japanese tweets. On the other hand, from the obtained
English tweets, we extracted 3,270,821 English tweets that
have unsounded code strings at the end of them. These
3,270,821 English tweets are 10.47% of all the English tweets.
Table I shows the number of Japanese and English normal
tweets, replies, and retweets that have unsounded code strings
at the end of them.
In this study, we do not discuss unsounded code strings
at the end of retweets. It is because, messages in retweets
are created not by submitters, but by other users. As a result,
retweets are inadequate to investigate how we use unsounded
code strings at the end of online messages.
In this study, we compare unsounded code strings at the
end of (1) normal tweets and (2) replies. It is because we intend
to compare and discuss the usage of unsounded code strings
at the end of tweets to (1) general public and (2) particular
persons. As mentioned, normal tweets are generally submitted
to general public. On the other hand, each reply is submitted
to a particular person.
Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the cumulative relative fre-
quency distribution of
•
the length of all the Japanese and English tweets
(excluding retweets),
•
the length of Japanese and English tweets (excluding
retweets) that have unsounded code strings at the end
of them, and
•
the length of unsounded code strings at the end of
Japanese and English tweets (excluding retweets).
As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the distribution of the
length of Japanese tweets shifts to shorter ranges than the
length of English tweets. On the other hand, the distribution
of the length of unsounded code strings at the end of Japanese
tweets shifts to longer ranges than the length of those at the
end of English tweets.
C. The comparison of the usage of unsounded code strings at
the end of Japanese and English tweets
Next, we compare the length of unsounded code strings
at the end of normal tweets and replies. Figure 5 and Figure
6 show the cumulative relative frequency distribution of the
length of unsounded code strings at the end of
•
Japanese normal tweets and replies, and
•
English normal tweets and replies.
As shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, the length of unsounded
code strings at the end of Japanese and English normal tweets
have a similar distribution pattern to those of Japanese and
English replies, respectively. As a result, it may be said that the
length of unsounded code strings at the end of tweets are less
affected by whether the tweets are normal tweets or replies.
Next, we compare the length of normal tweets and replies
that have unsounded code strings at the end of them. Figure 7
and Figure 8 show the cumulative relative frequency distribu-
tion of
•
the length of all the Japanese and English normal
tweets, and
•
the length of Japanese and English normal tweets that
have unsounded code strings at the end of them.
On the other hand, Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the cumulative
relative frequency distribution of
•
the length of all the Japanese and English replies, and
•
the length of Japanese and English replies that have
unsounded code strings at the end of them.

As shown in Figure 7–10, only the distribution of the length
of Japanese replies that have unsounded code strings at the
end of them shifts to longer ranges than the length of all the
Japanese replies. On the other hand, the distribution of the
length of the other tweets (Japanese normal tweets, English
normal tweets and replies) that have unsounded code strings
at the end of them do not shift to longer ranges when they are
longer than 30 characters. It may be said that the length of
Japanese tweets that have unsounded code strings at the end
of them are affected by whether the tweets are normal tweets
or replies. On the other hand, the length of English tweets
that have unsounded code strings at the end of them are not
affected.
Next, we investigate that the percentages of tweets that
have unsounded code strings at the end of them are affected
by whether the tweets are normal tweets or replies. Figure 11
shows the percentages of Japanese normal tweets and replies

that have unsounded code strings at the end of them. As
shown in Figure 11, 9.4 % of Japanese normal tweets have
unsounded code strings at the end of them while 17.0 % of
Japanese replies have unsounded code strings at the end of
them. As a result, the percentages of Japanese normal tweets
and replies that have unsounded code strings at the end of them
differ considerably from each other. In other words, Japanese
replies have unsounded code strings at the end of them more
frequently than Japanese normal tweets. On the other hand,
Figure 12 shows the percentages of English normal tweets
and replies that have unsounded code strings at the end of
them. As shown in Figure 12, 7.0 % of English normal tweets
have unsounded code strings at the end of them while 7.6 %
of English replies have unsounded code strings at the end of
them. As a result, the percentages of English normal tweets
and replies that have unsounded code strings at the end of
them differ little from each other. In addition, the percentages
of English normal tweets and Japanese normal tweets that have

unsounded code strings at the end of them differ little from
each other. From these points, it may be said that Japanese
speakers use unsounded code strings at the end of tweets more
frequently to particular persons than to general public while
English speakers do not. In other words, the receiver of a
tweet, whether general public or a particular person, is a factor
that affects the usage of unsounded code strings for Japanese
speakers, however, not for English speakers. It is not clear
whether this phenomenon is speciﬁc for Japanese speakers.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Unsounded code strings, in other words, consecutive un-
sounded marks and characters are frequently used at the end
of online messages. However, there were few studies on them.
In this study, we investigated unsounded code strings at the
end of Japanese and English tweets in Twitter. Then, we
showed that Japanese speakers use unsounded code strings

at the end of tweets more frequently to particular persons
than to general public while English speakers do not. It may
be said that the receiver of a tweet, whether general public
or a particular person, is a factor that affects the usage of
unsounded code strings for Japanese speakers, however, not for
English speakers. In order to discuss whether this phenomenon
is speciﬁc for Japanese speakers, we intend to analyze tweets
in various languages. The results of this study will give us a
chance to understand the usage of unsounded code strings and
improve multilingual CMC systems.
