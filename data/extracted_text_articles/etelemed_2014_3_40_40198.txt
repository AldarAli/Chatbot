Abstract—The oxygen concentration in the blood is a very
important physiological parameter. This variable is ordinarily
monitored using a pulse oximeter, a device that measures the
proportion of Hemoglobin that carries oxygen. Although noninva-
sive, this device needs constant contact with the patient’s skin. The
possibility of performing the same measurement without contact
using a color camera and ambient light is investigated in this
work. Particularly, the presence of signals necessary to oximetry
measurement on recorded videos is evaluated. It was found that
photo-plethysmographic signals are present at two color channels
simultaneously, depending on the analyzed region of the videos.
Thus, remote camera-based oximetry is possible in principle. Such
a device could ﬁnd numerous applications for patient monitoring,
either at the hospital or at home.

INTRODUCTION
Among the physiological parameters of interest for pa-
tient monitoring, blood gases’ concentration is of particular
importance. Patient’s oxygenation status is a key factor and
should be followed closely by the physician in several cases.
This parameter is ordinarily measured by a pulse oximeter
[1]. This device is a low-cost, noninvasive instrument that
measures the peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and provides
an approximation to the arterial oxygen saturation. The later is
the ratio between the amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin
(oxyhemoglobin, HbO2) and the total hemoglobin content,
which includes HbO2 and oxygen-free hemoglobin (deoxyhe-
moglobin, Hb), in the arterial blood. Although reliable and
small, the pulse oximeter needs constant contact with the
patient’s skin, usually on the ﬁnger tip or the ear lobe, and
is prone to movement artifacts [1].
One interesting alternative method to perform pulse oxime-
try, if possible, would be the use of a simple camera remotely
ﬁlming the patient. Such a method would greatly simplify the
monitoring of SpO2 at the hospital, and could be used to reduce
patient discomfort due to the use of sensors in applications
that require data acquisition during sleep, such as screening
for Sleep Apnea Syndrome [2] and automatic sleep staging
[3].
Recent literature provides some insight on whether such ap-
proach is possible. First, some results show that the acquisition
of photo-plethysmography, one of the key ingredients of pulse
oximetry, is possible via simple cameras. In [4], consumer
level digital cameras were used to record facial-area videos
of human subjects trying to maintain static positions under
ambient light. A signal with a strong component corresponding
to the subject’s heart rate was reliably recovered by using
spatial averaging over selected regions of interest (ROIs),
usually on the green channel. The authors conclude that this
signal is mostly due to a variation in volume of sub-cutaneous
blood vessels and thus a real photo-plethysmography (PPG).
Similar results were found in [5]. In [6], automatic face
tracking was used to provide a ROI on each video frame to
take care of subject movement. To further improve the response
to movement artifacts, the authors used a technique of blind
source separation to extract a heart related signal.
Another type of result regarding the second necessary
ingredient to pulse oximetry — multi-wavelength measure-
ment — has also been reported. In [7], a camera was used in a
special illumination setup where all ambient light was blocked
and the subject’s arm was illuminated with monochromatic
light. Up to three different wavelengths were used, however
not simultaneously, and videos were recorded. Oscillations at
the heart rate were observed at all tested wavelengths. Simul-
taneous PPG measurement in two wavelengths was obtained in
[8], although with a controlled light source synchronized with
the camera. In [9], a mobile phone camera was used to actually
estimate SpO2, but the camera needed to stay in contact with
the subject’s skin.
For the oximetry camera to be possible, two conditions
must be attained at the same time: remote PPG measurement
and multiple wavelength measurement, both under normal
ambient light. The aim of present study is to verify whether
these are possible. This work in progress, once completed
will, hopefully, construct a pulse oximetry camera or show
its feasibility.
This contribution is organized as follows. Section II sum-
marizes the theory behind pulse oximetry and shows how a
camera could be used to acquire the necessary data. Section III
describes the experimental setup used and the ﬁrst results
obtained. Finally, Section IV discusses the results and presents
some perspectives.

PULSE OXIMETRY
A good review of the theory of pulse oximetry is provided
in [1]. The interested reader is referred to that work, and

explanation. Here a short summary is included for sake of
completeness.

Light absorption in living tissue. Adapted from [1].
The physical principle used in oximetry is the different
optical absorption spectra of Hb and HbO2. This is responsible
for the difference in color between oxygenated and deoxy-
genated blood. The absorption of light passing by a solution
at a speciﬁc wavelength depends on the path length of the
light, the concentration of the solute and a characteristic of
the later called molar absorptivity. Under a few assumptions,
the proportion of the concentration of one solute with respect
to another in a two-solute solution can be determined by
absorption measurements in two wavelengths. The wavelengths
usually used correspond the red and infrared lights. However,
any two wavelengths for which HB and HbO2 have different
absorptivity can in principle be used. This method can be used
to measure the oxygen saturation of a blood sample. However,
when such method is applied to measure oxygen saturation
noninvasively in a patient, for instance by shining light through
some part of the patient’s body and measuring the transmitted
or the reﬂected light, the unknown optical characteristics of the
patient’s tissues make the calibration of the instrument very
difﬁcult.
An interesting approach was proposed by [10] and [11].
The light traveling through live human tissue have a time-
varying component in its absorbance signal. This time-varying
signal is called photo-plethysmography (PPG) and is caused
by the change of volume of the blood vessels related to the
cardiac contraction. The higher pressure during cardiac systole
corresponds to a larger volume of the arteries and, hence, to
a greater absorption due to the increased volume of blood.
The situation is reversed during diastole. This is depicted in
Figure 1.
The optical characteristics of tissue are represented by the
lower part of the graphic. Albeit unknown, the tissue’s ab-
sorption can be considered constant during short periods. The
same is valid for the venous blood’s absorption. The variable
part of the signal is due mostly to the change in volume of
arterial blood. If the absorption is considered additive, one can
use the variable signal to perform a normalization and take
into account only the contribution of the arterial blood. This
provides two advantages. First, only arterial blood saturation
is measured, which is the physiological parameter of interest.
Second, calibration is easier since only the blood’s optical
characteristics impact the measure, instead of the subject’s
tissue.
The normalization is usually performed by dividing the
pulsating part of the PPG signal (commonly referred as the
AC part) by the non pulsating part (the DC part). The nor-
malization is performed for each wavelength, yielding two
normalized measurement signals, one for the red light and
one for the infrared. The ratio between these signals is then
used to compute the oxygen saturation. In this later step, an
empirical calibration table is used in order to compute the
actual saturation.
The pulse oximetry requires, therefore, two “ingredients”.
First, at least two distinct wavelengths have to be used where
Hb and HbO2 have different absorptivities. Second, an oscil-
latory signal corresponding to the change in volume of the
arteries must be present at both wavelengths.
A. Camera-based pulse oximetry
Color cameras, even simple webcams, are devices capable
of acquiring a large amount of data. For instance, an webcam
with a resolution of 640x480 pixels recording at 30 frames per
second will measure light at 307200 different locations (each
pixel) at 3 different wavelengths (red, green and blue) 30 times
each second.
A camera-based pulse oximeter would use a camera to
measure the light that comes from the subject in a similar
manner that a regular pulse oximeter uses discrete phototran-
sistors or photodiodes as photodetectors. A camera pointed at
a subject from some distance away in a place where enough
normal ambient light is present is comparable to a reﬂectance
pulse oximeter. The hardware of the later consists of at least
two light emitting diodes (LEDs), one for red and one for
infrared, and one or more photodetectors. Both LEDs and
photodetectors are packed together in a way that their active
sides point at the same direction. When the device is placed
in contact with the subject, the LEDs illuminate the subject’s
skin and the photodetectors measure the reﬂected light. The
camera’s pixels play the role of the photodetectors and the
broad-spectrum ambient light combined with the color ﬁlters in
the camera provide the measurement at different wavelengths.
In order for such a camera-based oximeter to be feasible, it
remains to be veriﬁed that both “ingredients” for pulse oxime-
try are present. Multi-wavelength measurement is already a
feature of color cameras. What remains to be veriﬁed is that
a reasonably clear PPG signal can be acquired in at least two
color channels simultaneously. That is the objective of this
work.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND INITIAL RESULTS
The experimental setup carried out was as simple as
possible. Videos of human adult subjects were recorded, one
subject per video. During recording, the subject was in a sitting
position facing the camera, while trying to remain static. The
camera imaged the frontal part of the subject’s face from about
40cm away. The illumination was composed of natural daylight
and the regular ﬂuorescent ceiling lamps already present at
the ofﬁce. The camera used was an of-the-shelf consumer
webcam (HD Webcam Citrine WC064, Sweex Europe B.V.,
Netherlands). It can record color videos at 640x480 pixels
resolution and at 30 frames per second.

This setup mimics what would be a possible arrangement
for a future camera-based pulse oximeter. For instance, a
patient would be lying on a hospital bed in a illuminated
room. The camera of the pulse oximeter would be pointed
to the patient’s face, as this part is likely to present uncovered
skin. The oximeter would be at some distance away from the
patient, possibly at the ceiling, and would measure the SpO2
without encumbering the patient with a contact sensor. The
actual distance from the camera to the patient should not be
critical provided adequate optics are used, as a longer distance
from the camera to the patient can be compensated with a
longer focal length. What is important is that a sufﬁciently
large part of patient’s skin is visible from the camera’s point
of view.
Several videos of about one minute in length were
recorded. In order to avoid any disturbance, each video was
stored in raw format (YUV422)[12] in an AVI[13] container
ﬁle. This is important because most video compression tech-
niques lose information. Since the PPG signal is not usually
seen with the naked eye, a video compression algorithm
could, in theory, cause an important damage to the acquired
PPG signal while maintaining the perceived quality of the
compressed video. The drawback of recording raw video is the
large size of the video ﬁle. An one-minute raw video ﬁle has a
size of about 1.2 GiB. However, this difﬁculty is particular of
the experimental protocol used and is should not be present in
the ﬁnal device since the later should process the video signal
in real time and will have no need to record the video.
Video recording was done with MPlayer[14] in a PC
running GNU/Linux.
Video processing was made in Python[15] using the
OpenCV library[16] and custom made code. The Python
language was chosen due to its simplicity that allowed a fast
application development. As in [4], spatial averaging was used
to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Each color of
each pixel has a relatively low amplitude resolution of 8 bits,
which leads to a poor SNR. This can be partially overcome by
averaging together neighboring pixels in a region of a frame. In
this work, each frame was divided in 20x20 pixel regions that
where averaged together in each color channel. This provided a
single value per region, per channel and per frame. The channel
time series of the regions were later analyzed looking for the
presence of PPG signals.
A. Results
Figure 2 shows parts of two videos. These images where
created by averaging the green channel over the entire video
for illustration purposes. The subject on the left shows consid-
erable movement while the one on the right was able to keep
a more static position. Superimposed on the images are the
grids formed by the 20x20-pixel regions.
Three regions in Figure 2 are indicated by letters, two
on the left image and one on the right image. The time
series corresponding to the region “A” are shown in Figure 3.
All time series show an increasing trend, probably related to
the subject’s movement during the recording. On the green
channel, two oscillatory components are visible, one with a
low frequency and one with a relatively higher frequency. The
low frequency component is possibly related with the subject’s
Figure 2.

respiration. The high frequency component is the PPG signal.
Its presence on the green channel is in according to what was
found in [4]. The red channel, on the other hand, shows what
appears to be a PPG signal, although with a lower SNR. The
blue channel does not seem to have a PPG signal.
In order to better evaluate the possible presence of the
PPG signal, the time series were band-pass ﬁltered with a
FIR ﬁlter with cut-off frequencies at 0.7 Hz and 2.5 Hz. The
ﬁltered signals are shown in Figure 4. The PPG signal is easily
seen on the green channel. Even a slight amplitude modulation
is present, also possibly related with respiration. On the red
channel, the PPG signal can also be seen, particularly between
15 s and 40 s and around the 60 s mark. The signal quality is,
nevertheless, worse.
The presence of a PPG signal in multiple channels is very
dependent on the particular region chosen. As an example,
the band-pass ﬁltered time series of region “B” are shown in
Figure 5. Although clearly seen on the green channel, the PPG
signal is absent from the other channels.
Finally, different subjects may have different “optimal”
face regions where the presence of PPG is concerned. The
ﬁltered time-series of region “C” on the second subject are

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The possibility of remote oximetry measurement via color
camera and ambient light was investigated in this work. It was
found that a necessary condition for pulse oximetry, namely
the acquisition of PPG signals simultaneously in more than
one wavelength, was present in the recorded videos with at
least two different human subjects. The simultaneous presence
of PPG signals in multiple wavelengths was not veriﬁed in
previous publications under the conditions of this work (non-
contact camera, ambient light). This positive result means that
remote, camera-based pulse oximetry is in principle possible.
However, a lot of work remains to be done before such
a device is constructed. First, systematic measurement of the
recovered PPG amplitude for all face regions must be made.
This will help with the development of the next necessary
step that is an automatic and reliable way to detect and extract
the PPG signals. To this end, tools from the computer vision
domain may prove invaluable. After such extraction tool is
devised, a further step would be to create an experimental
protocol where different subjects are recorded while using
standard pulse oximeters and breathing at different oxygen
concentrations to provide a data base that would allow for

The possible applications of camera-based remote pulse
oximetry are numerous. At one end, long-term hospital and
home monitoring could replace contact oximeters in order
to decrease patient discomfort. On the other end, novel and
disruptive applications may become possible. For instance, a
simple software application could transform a smartphone into
a medical device capable to measure an important physiolog-
ical parameter without any hardware modiﬁcation and allow
for screening or monitoring of several diseases at home.
