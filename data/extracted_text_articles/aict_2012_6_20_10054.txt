Abstract—Motivated by a polarization approach to construct
code sequences related to Reed-Muller (RM) codes with gen-
erator matrix G2n of size 2n × 2n to increase the cutoff rate,
we consider a problem of systematic constructions of polar
codes as splitting threefold input binary discrete memoryless
channels (B-DMC) for generator matrix G3n. The polarized
channel achieves the symmetric capacity of arbitrary binary-
input discrete memoryless channels under a low computation
complexity of successive cancellation decoding strategy for any
core matrix O3, which is a submatrix of generator matrix
G4 = O2 ⊗ O2. In principle larger matrices G3n with fast
construction algorithms can be used for constructions of polar
code sequences that tend to polarize with respect to the rate
and reliability under certain fast combining and splitting
operations. The proposed polarization code scheme has a
salient recursiveness feature and hence can be decoded with
a belief propagation (BP) decoder, which renders the scheme
analytically tractable and provides a powerful low-complexity
coding algorithm.

channel coding; fast algorithm.
I. INTRODUCTION
The channel polarization may be consisted of code se-
quences using a belief propagation (BP) decoder with sym-
metric high rate capacity in given binary-input discrete
memoryless channels (B-DMC) [1]. It is a commonplace
phenomenon that is almost impossible to avoid as long
as several similar channels are combined in a sufﬁcient
density with certain elegant connections. The investigation
of channel polarization not only has become an interesting
theoretical problem, but also have lots of practical applica-
tions in signal sequence transforms, data processing, signal
processing, and code coding theory [2], [3].
Motivated by a fascinating aspect of Shannon’s chan-
nel coding theorem that shows the existence of capacity-
achieving code sequences [4], we show a novel construction
of provably capacity-achieving sequences with low coding
complexities with BP decoders. This paper is an attempt to
meet this elusive goal for B-DMC, which is an extension of
work where channel combining and splitting were used to to
improve the sum cutoff rate [1]–[3]. In a recent investigation,
the above-mentioned rate has been generalized for different
forms of polar-code constructions [5]. However, there is few
recursive method suggested there to reach the ultimate limit
of such improvements. As the present work progressed, it is
shown that polar-code sequences have much in common with
Reed-Muller codes [6]. Indeed, recursive code construction
and successive cancellation decoding, which are two es-
sential characters of polar coding, appear to be introduced
into coding theory. It has a relationship to existing work
by noting that polar-code sequences can be made to be
multilevel in terms of generator matrices Gpn originating
from Plotkin’s constructions [7]. Therefore, Polar coding has
a strong resemblance to Reed-Muller coding, and hence may
be regarded as a generalization of Reed-Muller codes since
both coding constructions start with a generator matrix for
a rate one code and obtain generator matrices of lower rate
codes by expurgating rows of the initial generator matrices.
While in this paper, we would like to point out that polar-
code sequences that have the same structure as Reed-Muller
codes have a sparse factor graph representation and can be
fast decoded with BP decoder for superior performance [3],
[8].
Since polar-coding, which may be considered as a gener-
alization of Reed-Muller coding, is an approach employed to
construct capacity-achieving codes with certain symmetries,
we demonstrate the performance advantages of several polar-
code sequences under BP decoder with respect to symmet-
ric capacity and Bhattacharyya parameter. The symmetric
capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the
input alphabets of B-DMC with equal probability. Polar-code
is the ﬁrst provably capacity achieving code with low coding
complexity [9].
According to construction of polar-code sequences, we
consider a generic B-DMC denoted by W
: X
7→ Y
with input alphabets X = {0, 1}, output alphabets Y, and
transition probabilities W(y|x) for x ∈ X, y ∈ Y. There are
two channel parameters [1], i.e., the symmetric capacity
I(W) =
X
x∈X

y∈Y

and the Bhattacharyya parameter

The two parameters are much useful as measures of rate
and reliability of the B-DMC, i.e., the Shannon capacity
I(W) is the highest rate at which reliable communication is
possible using the inputs with equal frequency, and Z(W) is
an upper bound on the probability of maximum-likelihood
(ML) decision error.
Throughout this paper, we use the notation aN
1 to denote a
row vector (a1, · · · , aN). Given such a vector aN
1 , we write
aj
i to denote the subvector (ai, · · · , aj). Moreover, we write
aA to denote the subvector (ai : i ∈ A ⊆ {1, 2, · · · , N}).
We write aj
1,o to denote the subvector with odd indices
(ai : 1 ≤ i ≤ j, i odd ), and aj
1,e to denote the subvector
with even indices (ai : 1 ≤ i ≤ j, i even ). Similarly,
we write aj
1,l to denote the subvector with the indices
(ai : 1 ≤ i ≤ j, i = pk + l). We write W N to denote the
channel corresponding to N uses of B-DMC W, and hence,
W N : X N 7→ YN with W N(yN
1 |xN
1 ) = QN
i=1 W(yi|xi).
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, generation
matrices of polar codes are presented via the channel com-
bining and splitting. In Sec.III, according to the properties of
polarization constructions, a decoding algorithm is suggested
for the GN-coset codes. Finally, conclusions are drawn in
Sec.III.
II. POLARIZATION CONSTRUCTION
In this section, we derive fast constructions of polar-codes
based on Arikan’s construction [1]. We begin by giving
an explicit algebraic expression of generator matrix GN of
polar-code, which has been deﬁned in a schematic form. The
algebraic form of GN point at an efﬁcient implementation of
coding operation uN
1 GN. In analyzing the coding operation,
we exploit its relation to fast transforms in signal processing
[9].
We carry out the construction of GN-coset codes before
specializing polar-codes. Recall that individual GN-coset
codes are identiﬁed by a parameter vector (N, K, A, µAc)
[1]. In the following analysis, we ﬁx the shorted parameter
vector (N, K, A) while keeping free µAc to take any value
over X N−K as frozen bits. In other words, the analysis of
polar-code sequences will be over the ensemble of GN-coset
codes with a ﬁxed parameter vector (N, K, A) based on
several families of generator matrices GN = O⊗n
3 , where ⊗
denotes keronecker product, n is a positive integer.
Constructions of polar-code sequences based on generator
matrices G3n are derived from the radix N = 3n channel
polarization, which is an operation by which one manufac-
ture out of N independent copies of a given B-DMC W
yields a second set of N channels {W i
N : 1 ≤ i ≤ N} that
show a polarization effect in a sense that, as N becomes
large, the symmetric capacity terms {I(W i
N) : 1 ≤ i ≤ N}
tend towards 0 or 1 for all but a vanishing fraction of indices
i. This operation consists of a channel combining phase and
a channel splitting phase.

Taking block length N = 3n, the channel combining
based on core matrix O3 of order 3 includes 3n copies of a
given B-DMC W in a recursive manner to produce a vector
channel W (i)
3n for any 1 ≤ i ≤ 3n. In a similar way , the ﬁrst
level of the recursion combines three independent copies of
W as shown in Fig. 1 and achieves the combined channel
W3 with the transition probabilities described as
W3(y3
1|u3
1) = W(y1| ⊕3
i=1 ui)W(y2|u2)W(y3|u3),
(3)
where the mapping W3 is deﬁned as W3(y3
1|x3
1)
=
W 3(y3
1|u3
1O3), where the core matrix
O3 =



is sub-matrix of O4 = O⊗2


,
where 11×3 = (1, 1, 1) and 03×1 = (0, 0, 0)T.
For the second level of the recursion, we combine three
independent copies of W3, as shown in Fig. 2, to generate
the channel W32 with transition probabilities

Therefore, we obtains the mapping u9
1 → x9
1 from the input
of W9 to the input of W 9 such that x9
1 = u9
1G9, where
G9 = B9G9 = B9O9 = B9O⊗2
3 .
Generally, we get the extensive form of the recursion
while three independent copies of W3n−1 are combined
to produce the channel W3n. The input vector u3n
1
is
transformed to s3n
1
such that
s3i−2 = ⊕2
j=0u3i−j,
s3i−1 = u3i−1,
s3i = u3i
for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3n−1. The operator R3n is a permutation
operation deﬁned as
R3n(u3n
1 )
=
(u3n
1,1, u3n
1,2, u3n
1,3)
=
(u1, · · · , u3n−2, u2, · · · , u3n−1, u3, · · · , u3n).
It is obvious that the mapping u3n
1
→ x3n
1
from the input of
the synthesized channel W3n to the input of the underlying
raw channels W 3n is linear and hence can be represented
with a generator matrix G3n so that x3n
1
= u3n
1 G3n. Thus
the relation of transition probabilities of W3n and W 3n are
described as W3n(y3n
1 |u3n
1 ) = W 3n(y3n
1 |u3n
1 G3n), where
y3n
1
∈ Y3n, u3n
1
∈ X 3n, G3n = B3nG⊗n
3
and B3n is a
3n-order permutation matrix deﬁned by B3n = R3n(I3 ⊗
B3n−1).
According to the previously deﬁned processing for chan-
nel combining and splitting which transforms 3 independent
copies of W into W (i)
3
for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, we get the following
one-to-one mapping to describe the relation of W and W (i)
3
Ξ3 : (W, W, W) 7→ (W (1)
3
, W (2)
3
, W (3)
3
), where
W (1)

i=1 ui)W(y2|u2)W(y3|u3).
In a similar way, for N = 3n we achieve the generalized
mapping to establish the relation of W (i)
N
and W (k)
3N as
follows
Ξ3i : (W (i)
N , W (i)

The transformation Ξ3n is not only rate-preserving but also
reliability-improving, i.e.,

N ).
In addition, the channel splitting moves the rate and reliabil-
ity away from the center. Namely, we obtain the following
results
I(W (3i−2)
3N
)≤I(W (3i−1)
2N
)≤I(W (i)

Z(W (3i−2)

3N
)≥Z(W (i)
N )≥Z(W (3i)
3N).
The afore-mentioned reliability terms further satisfy the
following constrained conditions
Z(W (3i−2)
3N
) ≤ 3Z(W (i)
N ) − 2Z3(W (i)
N )
Z(W (3i−1)

To illustrate the process of polarization on the basis of
core matrix O3 for a given N = 3n, each input sequence
uN
1 can be encoded through using an encoder
xN
1 = uN
1 GN,
(7)
where GN = BNO⊗n
3
is the generator matrix of order N
and BN is a permutation matrix (operation) deﬁned in the
recursion way as
BN = RN(I3 ⊗ RN/3) · · · (IN/3 ⊗ R3).
(8)
We note that O3 · O3 = I3 and BN = RN(I3 ⊗ BN/3).
Actually, it is easy to prove that RN(G3 ⊗ IN/3) =
(IN/3 ⊗ O3)RN. Therefore, one has
GN = (IN/3 ⊗ G3)RN(I3 ⊗ RN/3),
which can be rewritten as
GN
=
RN(O3 ⊗ GN/3)
=
RN(I3 ⊗ RN/3)(O⊗2
3
⊗ GN/32).

where Gi

N column’s permutation matrices P c
N(i) of Gi
N such that
P r

Moreover,
we
consider
another

scheme based on core matrix
ˆO3 =

to generate a vector channel W (i)
ˆO3 is sub-matrix of O4 = O⊗2 3n , where the core matrix

O4 =

ˆO3

,
where 11×3 = (1, 1, 1), 03×1 = (0, 0, 0)T, and ˆO3· ˆO3 = I3.
In this case the ﬁrst level of the recursion combines three
independent copies of W that achieves the combined channel
W3 with the following transition probabilities
W3(y3
1|u3
1) = W(y1|u1 ⊕ u3)W(y2|u2 ⊕ u3)W(y3|u3), (12)
where W3 is deﬁned as W3(y3
1|x3
1) = W 3(y3

design the second level of the recursion we obtain the
combined channel W32 in Fig. 2 with transition probabilities

To construct polar-code sequences of block length 3n
based on the polarization of channel with generator matrices
G3n for core matrix O3 of order 3, we should compute the
reliability channel polarization in terms of the vector
Z(3n) = (Z3n,1, Z3n,2, · · · , Z3n,3n)
through using the recursion
Z3k,j =



3Zk,j − 2Z3
k,j,
for 1 ≤ j ≤ k;
Z3
k,j−k,
for k + 1 ≤ j ≤ 2k,
Z3
k,j−2k,
for 2k + 1 ≤ j ≤ 3k,
(13)
for any k = 1, 3, 32, · · · , 3n−1 starting with Z1,1 = 1/2.
After that we generate a permutation operation π3n
=
(i1, · · · , i3n) with respect to the set (1, · · · , 3n) so that
Z3n,ij
<
Z3n,ik for any 1
≤
j
<
k
≤
3n. The
generator matrix GP (3n, K) of a (3n, K) polar-code can
be constructed from the sub-matrix of G3n with indices
{i1, · · · , iK} ⊆ {1, · · · , N}. According to the polarization
of channel with generator matrices G3n, it is obvious that
the computational complexity of this processing is 2n3
n
2 .
However, the computational complexity of the direct ap-
proach is n3n, which shows an advantage of the proposed
construction.
Example 1: Taking the matrix G9 = O⊗2
3
for recursion in
Eq.(13), we have
Z9 = (0.857, 0.034, 0.034, 0.034, 0.001, 0.001,
0.034, 0.001, 0.001),
(14)
which gives the permutation π8 = (9, 8, 6, 5, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1)
for rows of the generator matrix G9. Exploiting the po-
larization of channel with generator matrices G9, the code
(9, 5, {9, 8, 6, 5, 7}, (0, 0, 0, 0) can be constructed with the
encoder mapping as follows

For a source block (1, 1, 1, 1), the coded block is x9

III. DECODING ALGORITHM
In this section, we consider the decoding algorithm of
the proposed polar codes. As in the previous section, our
computational model will be a single processor machine
with a random-access memory. We consider the decoding
of GN-coset codes with parameters (N, K, A, µAc) for a
given block length N = 3n.
Recall that the source vector uN
1 consists of a random part
µA and a frozen part µAc such that uN
1 = {µA∪µAc}. This
vector uN
1 is transmitted across WN and a channel output
yN
1 is obtained with probability WN(yN
1 |uN
1 ). The decoder
observes (yN
1 , µAc) and generates an estimate ˆuN
1 of uN
1 .
If i ∈ Ac, the element ui is known, and thus the i-th
decision element is ˆui = ui. However, if i ∈ A, then the
i-th decision element waits until it has received the previous
decisions ˆui−1
1
. Upon receiving them, the decoder computes

which is then sent to all succeeding decision elements. This
processing is a single-pass algorithm, with no revision of
estimates. The complexity of this algorithm is determined
essentially by the complexity of computing the LRs.
As for polarization of channel based on generator matrix
G3n of order 3n, we calculate with the recursive formulas
(6)-(6) on the top of the next page based on core matrix O3
and obtain the formula in Eq.(15).
IV. CONCLUSION
In
this
paper,
we
considered
the
overall
encod-
ing/decoding structures and systems of the polar-code se-
quence to show the expression of encoding/decoding of the
polar-code with fast algorithms based on its generator matrix
G3n. The complexity of the proposed encoding scheme
is much lower than the previous which is proposed by
Arikan. By transmitting the information bits over the almost
noiseless B-DMC W, polar-codes of block-length 3n can be
fast constructed starting with any polarizing matrix G3n. The
encoding and successive cancellation decoding complexities
of such codes are lower than Arikan’s code.
