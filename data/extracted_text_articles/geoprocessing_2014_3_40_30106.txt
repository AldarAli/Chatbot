Abstract — This paper concerns the compression of 
hyperspectral data from Earth remote sensing by suggesting a 
multistage algorithm to increase the compression ratio, using a 
formation of auxiliary data of the large redundancy in their 
byte presentation, and taking in account the correlation intra-
bands. Here are presented the results of the studies on the 
effectiveness of compression of hyperspectral space images 
made by the proposed compression algorithm with the 
universal and specialized compression software.  
 
Keywords - remote sensing; hyperspectral images; lossless 
compression; intra-bands correlation; byte representation of

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Modern centers for space monitoring and systems of 
Earth Remote Sensing (RS) continually process, archive and 
distribute data which constitute tens and hundreds of 
gigabytes [1-9]. A key problem in the process is 
compressing RS data to increase effectiveness of a data 
transfer via connection channels of limited carrying capacity 
and archiving in RS storage subsystems of a limited 
capacity.  The necessary classification of this data must be 
of the highest value. That is why it is more appropriate  
lossless compression, which is free of any distortions of 
statistic brightness characteristics of restored data.  
The solution of the compression problem, which is the 
most accessible for practical implementation presupposes 
the usage of universal and widely-known algorithms and 
means of compression, for instance, in the archival software 
WinRar, WinZip or compressor Lossless JPEG (JPEG-LS) 
on the base of JPEG [10-15] image  compression standard. 
However, RS data is classified by various characteristics – 
spectral, radiometric, spatial resolutions and by geometrical 
size of the scene. The above-mentioned universal means of 
compression fail to consistently consider the variable 
differences [16-19]. Thus, there are multispectral and 
hyperspectral 
Aerospace 
Images 
(АI), 
which 
have 
essentially different parameters of spectral resolution and 
are characterized by dependence (correlation) between data 
of different bands [20]. If for multispectral aerospace 
images the coefficient of mutual correlation of bands is 
R(0.3; 0.8), then for hyperspectral AI representing values 
of brightness which are received in various spectral bands 
with the high spectral resolution, the correlation of 
neighboring bands is R ≈ 1.0. This demonstrates high 
redundancy of data and expediency of applying this feature 
while compression [21][22].  
Besides, knowing the correlation value (intra-bands 
correlation) between bands of hyperspectral AI, it is 
expedient to operate values of deviations (difference) 
between it and actual reference values, and that will allow to 
reduce the range of data change and hence will demand a 
smaller number of categories for their storage. The effective 
usage of specialized means of the compression is possible, 
considering the above-stated features of hyperspectral AI. 
The software intended for the analysis of spatial data and 
processing of АI are ERDAS Imagine, ERDASER Mapper, 
ArcView GIS, GeoExpress and others often dispose of  
specific modules for compression of АI. Thus, the package 
ERDAS Imagine utilizes the compression tool for images in 
the format of MrSID (IMAGINE MrSID Desktop Encoder 
and IMAGINE MrSID Workstation Encoder), based on 
wavelets and intended for lossy compression of large RS 
images. The system ERDASER Mapper has modules of loss 
compression on the basis of the standards JPEG2000 and 
ECW [23]. In the package ArcView GIS there is a module 
MrSID which compresses raster images files with loss [24]. 
The software product GeoExpress is intended for 
compressing raster data with the use of popular formats 
MrSID and JPEG2000 [25]. Thus, all commercial systems 
of  RS data processing  are have all means of loss 
compression on the basis of well-known standards. 
Today hyperspectral RS images lossless compression 
research attempt to apply various approaches and methods 
[26-34]. The separate stages of transforming data while 
compressing АI and possibility of decreasing power inputs 
and algorithmic complexity are discussed. Additionally, 
there are various attempts at adapting standards which have 
successfully proved for compressing usual images for 
compressing hyperspectral AI.

II. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM  
 
However, not all details of the original algorithms of 
compression are clear. Their numbers exceed the 
possibilities of most widespread means of compression; 
when 
applied 
to 
hyperspectral 
АI 
with 
various 
characteristics is uncertain.  
It is our purpose to promote further search for 
approaches to lossless compression of hyperspectral RS 
images, substantially free from the disadvantages of existing 
universal and specialized means of compression.  
Considering the features of hyperspectral АI and some 
details of existing analogues, the most expedient solution of 
the problem of compressing hyperspectral АI is by multi-
stage transformations: first the advantages of universal 
traditional approaches for data compression, and secondly to 
consider the specificity of hyperspectral data. The algorithm 
embodying this approach and some of its results is 
discussed below. 
Considering the specificity of compressing hyperspectral  
AI, the proposed algorithm has the following stages:  
1. 
To consider the functional dependence of values of 
brightness (albedo) between various bands of images, by 
calculating the correlation and of deviations (differences) of 
initial data and the values of those found for functional 
dependence. 
2. 
Creation of auxiliary structure of data on the basis 
of the initial hyperspectral АI, storing the unique pair 
groups of values of elements in a byte representation, and 
addressing   references on   these  unique pair groups as 
well. 
3. 
Compression of received data transformations with 
standard entropy algorithm by processing the generated 
auxiliary structures of the data. 
Let us consider the details of the above-mentioned 
stages. 
In the first stage, the value of deviations of the linear 
dependence on the matrix of values I[m,n,k]. 
For step-by-step description of the first stage consisting 
in searching correlation and deviations it is necessary to 
account the following objects: 
 An initial image – the matrix of values of the image 
I[m,n,k],  where m,n,k – are indices of the lines, columns 
and bands of the initial image, m = 1,2,…,M, n = 1,2,…,N, k 
= 1,2,…,K; 
 R[k] – a  file for "level-by-level" preservation  values 
of correlation  R   between  the   neighboring  bands 
(layers);  
 Q[k] – a file for placing values of the mathematical 
expectation for each band I[m,n,k]; 
 L[k] – a file for preserving the linear dependence; 
 I'[m,n,k] c a file for placing values of differences 
(deviations) between L[k]  and  I[m,n,k]. 
Step 1. To calculate a mathematical expectation mk  of 
each band of the initial image I[m,n,k] and to place values to 
the file Q[k], as in (1):

Step 2. To calculate (on the base of  Q[k] and I[m,n,k]) 
correlation R for each pair of all available K bands of the 
initial image I[m,n,k], as  in (2):

Step 3. To calculate (on the base of Q[k] and R[k]) a

available K bands of the initial image I[m,n,k]. Result 
should be placed to L[k], L[k] = Q[k]×R[k], k=1,2,…,K-1. 
Step 4. To calculate (on the base of R[k] and L[k]) the 
difference between elements L[k] and corresponding values 
of the initial image I[m,n,k] in each of K bands, as in (3):

for m=1..M, n=1..N. The result is placed to I'[m,n,k].  
Step 5. To transform the negative values I'[m,n,k] to 
positive ones in the byte representation as numbers with a 
sign demand more bytes than those without a sign (4):

The result is the file I'[m,n,k] considering values of 
intra-bands correlation R[k]. 
The essence of the second stage consists of forming a 
file of unique pair groups of values which represent the 
initial image in the byte representation. Then, the file is 
formed containing references to the same pair group of 
values.  
The algorithm proceeds with two additional objects: 
 M[j,k] – a file of unique pair groups of values of the 
initial image in the byte representation; 
 D[j,k] – a file for entering references (to unique pair 
groups of values). 
In second stage of transformation, the step-by-step 
elaboration is shown in Figure 1:

Step 1. To form (on the base of I'[m,n,k]) a file M[j,k] 
for each band K adding unique pair groups of values in the 
byte representation from the file  I'[m,n,k]. To place the 
result to M[j,k], j= 1,2,..,J. If repeated pair groups of values 
are absent, then J = (M×N×K)/2, k= 1,2,..,K. 
Step 2. To form  (on the base of   M[j,k]) a  file   D  [j,k], 
putting down references to unique pair groups of values 
from the file M[j,k] to D[j,k]. To place the result to D[j,k],  
j<J as  j = M×N×K, k= 1,2,..,K. 
 
 
Figure 1. Procedure of forming auxiliary structure of data. 
At the end of the second stage, context modeling was 
used with the known arithmetic coding for compressing data 
of the file D[j,k] to the archival software D'[j,k]. 
In order to form an initial hyperspectral AI I[m,n,k] from 
D'[j,k] it is necessary to make a number of transformations 
opposed to the above-mentioned: 
 To make arithmetic decoding of the file  D'[j,k] 
restoring the file  D[j,k]; 
 To find in the file D[j,k] the corresponding references 
to unique pair groups from the formed structure of the data 
M[j,k]; 
 To restore the file I'[m,n,k] containing a file of 
dependencies L[k] having counted the absolute values of the 
file I'[m,n,k] and having restored the initial image I[m,n,k].

EXPERIMENTAL  RESEARCH 
In order to access the effectiveness of the proposed 
algorithm in what concerns both the point compression ratio 
as the limits of its application, a number of experiments was 
perfomed using hyperspectral AI of the system RS AVIRIS 
(table 1) in the format of data of raster geoinformation 
system Idrisi Kilimanjaro. The system AVIRIS (Airborne 
Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) provides 224 
spectral images with the wavelength of the band from 400 
nanometers to 2500 nanometers.  Also, the comparison of 
the proposed algorithm with the results of experiments 
received for universal archivers compression algorithms 
WinRar, WinZip and compressor Lossles JPEG which 
applies the resolution of compression standard JPEG widely 
used in commercial compression systems were made.  
The experiments are made on a computer with the 
processor Intel Core i5 2,5 GigaHerz and RAM 4 Gigabit 
under operating system Windows 7 (updating package 3).

The proposed algorithm was then performed sequence of 
stages to find the most effective:   
Sequence I – Consideration of the correlation (1)  
forming an auxiliary of data with unique pair groups and 
references to them (2) arithmetic coding (3).  
Sequence II – Forming an auxiliary of data with unique 
pair groups and references to them (1)  arithmetic coding 
(2).  
Sequence III – Consideration the correlation (1)  
arithmetic  coding (2).  
Sequence IV – Forming an auxiliary of data with unique 
pair groups and references to them (1) consideration the 
correlation (2)  arithmetic coding (3). 
In order to evaluate the most productive sequence 
considering the contribution of each of these stages a 
number of experiments with different variants was 
conducted (Figure 2).

sequences, the results surpass Losless JPEG indifferent 
degrees (from 25% to 46%).  
The best result is achived by sequence I is with the 
highest exponent of compression. Sequence IV was 
impaired by the execution of stage it is not expedient to 
realize the stage (of considering the correlation after the 
stage of forming auxiliary structures of data)  as it leads to 
increasing a range of data change while counting the 
difference. The results of realizing the second stage show 
that absence of the stage of intra-bands correlation leads to 
an insignificant exponent of compression in comparison 
with Losless JPEG.

sequence III leads to the most insignificant result as there is

no powerful formation of unique pair groups and references 
to them with creation of corresponding auxiliary structures 
of data. 
In Figure 3, the results of comparative experiments 
demonstrate   the superiority of the proposed algorithm over 
analogues in exponent of compression Dсs at the varied 
geometrical sizes of hyperspectral АI. At increasing the 
geometrical size of the scenes, all the investigated 
algorithms show a steady result which exhibits little to no 
change.

Figure 5. Computational performance of compression algorithms. 
 
Research was conducted to explore the dependence of 
compression exponent Dсs on the number of bands of AI K 
(Figure 4). Results show that compression exponent Dсs is 
increasing proportionally to the number of bands Kas the 
redundancy of the data of hyperspectral AI raises. 
In conducting comparative research of compression 
exponents it is necessary to pay attention to calculating 
expenses of compression algorithms (Figure 5). 
As seen in Figure 5, in the proposed algorithm, the 
calculated effectiveness in comparison with analogues 
increased 3 fold. This is explained by an improved multi-
stage algorithm which is provided to form auxiliary 
structures of data on AI considering the correlation and the 
following arithmetic coding. Universal archival software 
does not take into account the specificity of the data being 
compressed and does not account for such operations.

IV. CONCLUSION 
1. A multi-stage algorithm for compressing hyperspectral 
АI was developed. This algorithm considers intra-bands 
correlation and the preliminary byte data processing, 
allowing up to 46 % increase in data compression when 
compared with other algorithms. 
2. The analysis of the importance of stages has shown 
that the stage of preliminary byte processing with formation 
of auxiliary structures of data allows to improve the result 
considerably – up to 45 %. The stage of considering intra-
bands correlation is less significant. However it allows to 
lower a range of varied values for operating by smaller 
spacing, allowing to increase the compression ratio 
considerably – up to 26 %. 
3. The analysis of computing efficiency has shown, that 
in order to achieve significant results of compression in 
applying a multi-stage algorithm, high computing expenses 
are required, conceding to the nearest analogue Lossless 
JPEG up to 3 folds.
