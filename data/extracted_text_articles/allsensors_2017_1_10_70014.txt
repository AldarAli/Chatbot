Abstract— In order to improve the frame rate of a CMOS image 
sensor (CIS), a novel technique of correlated double sampling 
(CDS) and a symmetrical 3-input comparator are discussed. In 
the conventional digital CDS, a subtraction algorithm between 
the reset digital code and the pixel digital code has been 
normally adopted. Thus, it needs two ramps and takes a much 
more operating time, compared to that of analog CDS. In this 
paper, an intelligent digital CDS is proposed drastically to 
reduce the operating time. Further, a symmetrical 3-input 
comparator to implement the intelligent digital CDS is also 
described.  A high speed CIS with the proposed CDS and a 
symmetrical 3-input comparator has been fabricated with 
Samsung 0.13um CIS technology. A high frame rate of 240fps is 
achieved at the VGA resolution of 640x480 with 39mW power 
consumption. 
 
Keywords—CMOS image sensor(CIS); one-ramp digital 
correlated double sampling; symmetrical 3-input comparator; 
subtraction algorithm.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) are now widely used in many 
kinds of areas including digital cameras,  camcorders, CCTV 
cameras, medical equipment, etc. In order to improve the 
image quality of CIS, research has focused on developing 
methods to reduce noise. In CIS, Fixed Pattern Noise (FPN) is 
a major factor causing the degradation of image quality. FPN 
is normally generated from the device mismatching errors of 
pixel circuits, such as threshold voltage variations of source 
follower, fluctuations of MOS transistor size, etc.  To remove 
the errors, a few techniques of analog Correlated Double 
Sampling (CDS) have been reported [1][2]. However, it 
requires a large size of capacitor to enhance the accuracy. 
Further, it is difficult to have a high resolution image beyond 
8-bit. Therefore, many CISs with a single-slope ADC use a 
digital CDS to reduce FPN [3]-[10]. In the digital CDS, FPN 
is normally eliminated by comparing the reset signal and the 
pixel signal through the two ramp signals. Generally, the 
length of the reset ramp signal is at least about a quarter of the 
pixel ramp signal. In other words, the A/D conversion time of 
digital CDS is much longer than that of analog CDS only. 
Even though the digital CDS has a high quality image, the 
operating speed is much lower than that of analog CDS. In 
this paper, to improve the speed of CIS, a single ramp signal 
is used. The contents of the papers are as follows. In Section 
II, the conventional CDS and a new CDS are discussed. The 
implementation of CIS and experimental results are described 
in Section III. Finally, the conclusions are summarized in 
Section IV. 
II. CORRELATED DOUBLE SAMPLING (CDS) 
In order to understand the main idea of this paper, the 
principle of CDS is essential. After a conventional CDS is 
described, the proposed CDS technique will be discussed.   
A. Conventional Two-ramps Digital CDS 
Fig. 1 shows a conventional CIS with a single-slope ADC 
(SS-ADC). Fig. 1(a) shows the block diagram of a CIS with a 
column parallel ADC. Since it consists of many pixels, the 
pixel FPN can occur due to device mismatching errors. The 
pixel FPN conveys each output from the same light to the 
ADC in the form of another voltage. Moreover, the ADC in 
each column can also generate imbalance features, column 
FPN. Therefore, both the pixel FPN and the column FPN 
must be reduced and properly calibrated. In order to reduce 
the FPN, an SS-ADC with an analog CDS shown in Fig. 1(b) 
is widely used. The difference between the pixel signal 
voltage and the reset voltage is transferred into ADC [3]-[6].

The analog CDS requires a large size of the capacitor to 
enhance the accuracy. Thus, a digital CDS is generally used 
with an analog CDS in order to reduce FPN. Fig. 2 shows the 
timing diagram of the conventional SS-ADC with a digital 
CDS. It compares the reset signal with the first ramp and the 
pixel signal with the second ramp. When comparing the reset 
signal, the counter executes a down count mode.  When 
comparing pixel signal, the counter operates in the up count 
mode. In this case, the digital CDS can remove the FPN that 
cannot be removed with the analog CDS. However, the 
conversion time of digital CDS is increased because an 
additional ramp is needed at the SS-ADC, compared to that of 
analog CDS. Generally, the operation time to compare the 
reset signal with the ramp is about a quarter of the time to 
compare the pixel signal with the ramp. Therefore, the A/D 
conversion time of digital CDS is much longer  than that of 
analog CDS only.

B. Intelligent CDS 
Fig. 3 shows the principle of a SS-ADC with the proposed 
intelligent digital CDS.  Fig. 3(a) shows the circuit diagram of 
a SS-ADC with the intelligent CDS. Instead of a conventional 
comparator, a symmetrical 3-input comparator performs an 
A/D conversion. In order to separate the voltage coming from 
the reset signal and the pixel signal, a holding capacitor and a 
DC blocking capacitor are used at each node, respectively. 
Fig. 3(b) shows the circuit diagram of 3-input comparator, 
and Fig. 3(c) shows the timing diagram of a SS-ADC. Since 
the reset signal and the pixel signal are stored separately 
through the operation of the intelligent CDS, only one ramp 
signal is enough to obtain a digital code even in a digital CDS. 
The procedure of Fig. 3(c) is as follows. In the region of A, 
the reset signal is stored at CH1 when S1 and S3 are ON, then 
the pixel signal is stored at CH2 when S2 and S4 are ON. 
Further, in Fig. 3(b), when S6 and S8 are ON, S7 and S9 are 
OFF, the 3-input comparator is now ready to start.  
In the region of B, all the switches of Fig. 3(a), S1,S2,S3, 
and S4 are OFF.  Then, the ramp is now starting down when 
S6 and S9 are ON, S7 and S8 are OFF in Fig. 3(b). Thus, the 
right side of 3-input comparator is at the state of equilibrium, 
and the left side of 3-input comparator amplifies the voltage 
difference between the ramp and the reset signal. The output 
voltage of 3-input comparator is easily obtained from the 
simple equation of a differential amplifier as follows.  
 
Vout = 𝐺𝑚  𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑡  {(𝑉𝑅𝐴𝑀𝑃 − 𝑉𝑟𝑠𝑡) + (𝑉𝑠𝑖𝑔 − 𝑉𝑠𝑖𝑔)}          (1) 
 
where 𝐺𝑚  is the input transconductance of 3-input 
comparator, 𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑡 is the output impedance, respectively. At 
the end of region B, when the ramp signal and the reset signal 
are the same, the sync block becomes HIGH.

the right side of 3-input comparator amplifies the voltage 
difference between the ramp and the pixel signal. At this time, 
the output voltage of 3-input comparator is also easily 
obtained as follows.  
 
Vout = 𝐺𝑚  𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑡  {(𝑉𝑟𝑠𝑡 − 𝑉𝑟𝑠𝑡) + (𝑉𝑅𝐴𝑀𝑃 − 𝑉𝑠𝑖𝑔)}          (2) 
 
At the end of region C, when the ramp signal and the pixel 
signal are the same, the sync block becomes LOW and the 
counter stops. Therefore, the digital code which corresponds 
to the difference of reset signal and pixel signal can be 
calculated. The operating time of the intelligent CDS 
technique can be reduced drastically compared to that of a 
conventional CDS, because only one ramp is used. In the 
region of D, all the functions of 3-input comparator stop and it 
returns to the initial state, when S6 and S8 are ON, S7 and S9 
are OFF. Thus, the 3-input comparator is like a symmetrical 
amplifier.

Figure 4. Timing Diagram of the Proposed Intelligent One-ramp CDS 
 
Fig. 4 shows the timing diagram of a SS-ADC with the 
proposed intelligent digital CDS. Compared to those of Fig. 2, 
it does not need the section that compares the reset signal with 
the ramp. In case of 10-bit SS-ADC, at least, the time of 256 
cycles is saved. Therefore, the operating time of the proposed 
technique is much faster than that of the conventional one. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Fig. 5 shows the block diagram of a CIS with a 10-bit 
SS-ADC and the intelligent digital CDS. The CIS is based on 
a column-parallel ADC structure with a VGA resolution of 
640x480, and each pixel uses a 4-TR APS with a size of 5.6 
µm x 5.6 µm. As mentioned above, the CIS uses the 
intelligent digital CDS, which compares the reset signal and 
the pixel signal with only one ramp signal. Thereby, this new 
method facilitates the digital block with a simple counter. 
Because of a simple counter, the chip area of digital block is 
drastically reduced, compared to that of the conventional one.  
Table I shows the comparison of chip size per one column. 
With 0.13µm Samsung CIS technology, the total layout size 
of the proposed one per one column is 470 µm, while that of a 
conventional one is 450 µm. Thus, the total chip area of the 
proposed CIS is not so much bigger than that of the 
conventional one, even though the intelligent digital CDS 
technique uses the large size of capacitors and differential 
mode at the analog block.

Fig. 6(a) shows the chip microphotograph of the CIS 
fabricated with Samsung 0.13 µm 1P4M CIS technology. The 
chip size is   6 mm x 6 mm, and the pixel array conforms to 
the VGA resolution (640x480). Fig. 6(b) shows the 
configuration of the measurement system which is comprised 
of a board that contains the Xilinx-XEM 3050 FPGA and a 
test board of the prototype CIS chip with a chip-on-board 
(COB). The prototype of CIS chip shown in Fig. 6(a) is 
controlled by the control signals through an external FPGA. 
Using such a configuration allows us to establish various test 
environments for the image sensor, to verify the performance 
of the CIS and to check the results of various features. The 
FPGA plays a role in generating the control signal for the 
measurements, receiving the output data from the image 
sensor, and delivering the results to the PC through the USB 
interface. The transmitted data are handled in the PC, where 
the real image is processed.

Figure 7. Measured VGA Sample Image 
 
Fig. 7 shows the VGA sample image with the condition of 
10-bit resolution. The method achieves frame rates of 240 fps 
at a main clock speed of 100MHz. The image shows high 
quality. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
A high speed CMOS image sensor with an intelligent 
digital CDS technique was discussed. In order to raise the 
operating speed of the conventional CIS, we described a new 
symmetrical 3-input comparator and an intelligent digital 
CDS that compares the reset signal and the pixel signal using 
only one ramp. With the technique, the operating speed of the 
proposed CIS was much faster than that of the conventional 
one, because only one ramp was adopted. The prototype chip 
has been fabricated with the Samsung 0.13 µm 1P4M CIS 
technology. The resolution of the CMOS image sensor was 
the VGA specifications of 640x480, and the pixel size was 
5.6 µm with the 4-TR APS. The conversion time of the 
designed 10-bit SS-ADC using the intelligent digital CDS 
satisfied the 16-µs at a main clock speed of 100MHz. The 
frame rate of the CIS was of 240 fps at the main clock speed 
of 100MSPS. Table II shows the comparison results of the 
proposed CDS with the previously published works. The 
proposed CIS has the advantage of high speed frame rate, 
compared to other ones at the same condition.

the ADC resolution up to 14-bit. Further, a two-step 
single-slope ADC with the proposed CDS technique will also 
be studied.
