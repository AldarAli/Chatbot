Abstract—Twitter (currently being re-branded as “X”) is
widely used as a tool for collecting and disseminating information
about the latest security incidents. However, the quality of
threat information provided by Twitter (earliness, detailedness,
and reliability) has not been studied sufﬁciently so far. Fresh
information is required by both security experts and non-experts.
Detailedness and reliability are also important criteria in two
aspects. First, there are many accounts on Twitter, and anyone
is free to post fake news. Second, true information that is not
detailed is inconsequential to experts. This study compares the
quality provided by Twitter and a security news site, which is
expected to be very trustworthy. Because Emotet is having a
serious impact in Japan, this study veriﬁed the earliness and
detailedness by measuring when and how often words charac-
terizing Emotet variants have appeared on Twitter and the news
site in the past. Experiments revealed that Twitter alerted far
earlier and more frequently about more diverse malware types,
malicious attachment extensions, and malicious subject lines.
Reliability was assessed based on two criteria: website reliability
and text reliability. The news site was superior in terms of website
reliability. In terms of text reliability, on the other hand, their
difference was insigniﬁcant. The text reliability was derived from
discrepancies between articles about the same security incidents,
which were detected by humans and a state-of-the-art machine
learning model. Overall, the quality of information on Twitter is
higher than on the news site.
Keywords—cyber security; Twitter; cyberthreat intelli-
gence; threat information quality; ChatGPT.
I. INTRODUCTION
This study extends our original conference paper [1] in
three aspects. First, the quality of threat information has
been assessed with the addition of 2023 data. Second, web
page structure containing unrelated text (e.g., advertisements,
recommendations, related articles, etc.) was analyzed to collect
body texts of web pages successfully. Third, an approach using
Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) [2] that
automatically detects discrepancies between two descriptions
was added to verify the reliability of web page content.
Twitter is a place where diverse topics are transmitted in
real-time among many users. Because cybersecurity topics are
also actively exchanged, many security experts are trying to
extract useful Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) from Twitter
[3]. One of the most attractive features of Twitter is its real-
time nature. Because attack tactics continuously evolve and
new attack techniques could suddenly emerge, cybersecurity
practitioners, who want to proactively defend their organiza-
tions, are forced to retrieve timely information from Twitter.
Twitter is currently regarded as one of the major Open-
Source INTelligence (OSINT) sources [4] [5]. However, except
for a few studies on extracting Indicators of Compromises
(IoCs) (i.e., forensic artifacts or remnants of an intrusion),
quality evaluation focusing on Twitter CTI information has
not been conducted [3]. Niakanlahiji et al. demonstrated the
earliness of IoCs in Twitter by extracting many malicious
URLs from Twitter that are not in blacklist databases [6].
Shin et al. showed the excellency in earliness, uniqueness,
and accuracy of Twitter IoCs by comparing them with public
CTI feeds [7].
Fake news, i.e., false or misleading information, often
spreads over Twitter, especially when big events, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic [8] or natural disasters [9], occur. Twitter
may not always provide reliable information because anyone
is free to post their own opinions. Additionally, although many
security incidents are posted every day, it is not clear whether
they are useful professional knowledge. The reliability and
detailedness of Twitter information may not fully meet the
requirements of experts and non-experts.
This study compares the earliness, detailedness, and reliabil-
ity of CTI information provided by Twitter and Security NEXT
[10], a major Japanese cybersecurity news site. The news
site publishes daily free-access articles on security incidents
and new vulnerabilities, with coverage by trusted security
experts. As such, the site surely provides sufﬁciently reliable
information with some level of detail and speed.
This study collected Japanese tweets and articles related
to Emotet as a case study; Emotet is a Trojan horse that is
spreading worldwide. The most common Emotet attack is to
infect computer systems with various types of malware using
malicious attachments in spam emails. Japan has been a major
Emotet target since 2019 [11]. This study quantitatively reveals
that Twitter excels in terms of detailedness and earliness but
not in terms of reliability.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II presents research related to this paper. Section III outlines
security news, CTIs, and Emotet. Section IV describes our
experiment and program to collect and analyzes website data.
Section V presents experimental results regarding the informa-

tion quality of the two media types. Section VI discusses the
possibility of automatic discrepancy detection using the state-
of-the-art artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technology ChatGPT. Sec-
tion VII discusses some aspects of Twitter threat information
from the perspective of our ﬁndings. Finally, the conclusion of
this study and future directions are presented in Section VIII.
II. RELATED WORK
The idea of collecting CTI information from Twitter dates
back more than a decade [12]. Because it is a time-consuming
task due to the enormous volume of data generation, many
recent studies have proposed more efﬁcient extraction mecha-
nisms. Some studies make use of advanced machine learning
technologies [13] [5] [14] [15], some utilize semantic knowl-
edge bases [4], and some focus on active Twitter account
tracing [16] and detection [17]. Recent approaches improve
the accuracy of IoCs by comparing threat reports from six
sources, including Twitter [18], or by collecting tweets from
non-experts who discovered or encountered attacks [19].
The term IoC is used in the computer security domain to
refer to speciﬁc patterns, markers, or evidence that indicate
a security incident or breach. IoCs can be represented in
different forms and types depending on attack techniques. IoCs
may be IP addresses, domain names, ﬁle hashes, malware
behavior patterns, or network trafﬁc characteristics. These can
help detect, investigate, and respond to attacks and breaches
on computer systems and networks.
In contrast, limited studies have investigated the quality of
CTI information provided by Twitter. Table I compares our
approach with prior studies [6] [7] [20]. All existing studies
in the table extracted IoCs and compared them with blacklists
or CTIs, while this study extracted the entire text that describes
Emotet attacks in order to capture characteristic attack patterns
and their evolution. Moreover, these studies evaluated Twitter
IoCs based on earliness or timeliness. In addition to earliness,
this study evaluated Twitter information based on detailedness
and reliability. For comparison, we selected Security NEXT,
a cybersecurity news site, which is expected to be highly
reliable.
“Earliness,” “detailedness,” and “reliability” are the essential
criteria that should not be missing in any one of these. It is easy
to understand that earliness and reliability are indispensable;
detailedness is also necessary because an easy way to increase
reliability is to avoid detailed descriptions so as not to increase
incorrect expressions. The earliness, uniqueness, and accuracy
criteria in [7] were also treated as a set. In our opinion,
Shin et al. of [7] emphasize the aspect of Twitter information
diversity, while this study focuses on Twitter information
volume. Reference [20] extended the work in [7] using similar
quality criteria.
This study collected body text on each web page and
detected discrepancies among texts using ChatGPT. The study
also evaluated earliness and detailedness from three categories:
malware types, attachment extensions, and email subject lines.
This is because many words that appear frequently in the texts

III. BACKGROUND
A. Threat Information
Security companies and experts provide the latest threat
information and advice on security measures via Twitter. They
share information and engage in discussion with the hashtag
#Infosec. The hashtag #Cybersecurity is also widely used
and is a keyword for sharing security news, vulnerability
information, and best practices.
In addition to Twitter, there are various other ways to gather
threat information [18]. Security vendors and information-
sharing organizations, such as Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT) and Computer Security Incident Response
Team (CSIRT), provide CTI information and access to threat
databases. They also provide useful early warning and coun-
termeasure information and services to automatically collect
and analyze threat information. Meanwhile, security news sites
and blogs present articles and analyses on the latest threat
information and attack trends regularly.
B. News vs. CTI
Both security news and CTI are important components
of the cybersecurity landscape. In general, they have the
following different characteristics:
• Scope:
Security news covers a broad range of topics and provides
a general awareness of current happenings in the ﬁeld of
security, such as the latest events, incidents, breaches,
vulnerabilities, and developments. While analysis and
insights may be included, they are usually limited due to
the nature of news reporting. Meanwhile, CTI provides
in-depth analysis, context, and actionable insights about
cyber threats. It involves the collection, analysis, and
dissemination of information about potential or ongoing
cyber threats to help understand the tactics, techniques,
and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers.
• Timeliness:
Security news typically reports real-time or near real-
time information on noteworthy security incidents, data
breaches, emerging vulnerabilities, and other relevant
topics. CTI focuses on long-term trends, emerging threats,
and potential risks, which are not immediately visible in
security news.

Figure 1. Number of tweets per month collected from Twitter APIs using search strings “emotet” (orange bars) and “emotet lang:ja” (blue bars). Japan is the
primary target country and Emotet infection has two phases: dormant and spreading.
• Audience:
Security news caters to a broad audience, including
general users, businesses, and professionals in the cyber-
security industry. CTI is primarily targeted at cyberse-
curity professionals, threat intelligence analysts, incident
responders, and security operations teams.
C. Emotet
Emotet is a type of banking Trojan ﬁrst discovered in 2014.
Emotet hijacks user computers through emails and opens a
backdoor to download and install various malicious programs.
Infected computers may be used as part of a botnet to send
spam emails and spread various types of malware. The goal
of the attack is to steal personal information, such as credit
card information and passwords.
Figure 1 shows the monthly numbers of tweets collected
with the search strings “emotet” and “emotet lang:ja,” where
lang:ja limits the language to Japanese. The ﬁgure shows that
Emotet has heavily affected Japan and that there were several
major Emotet outbreaks, partly because of its attack strategy
changes. Detailed and reliable Emotet variant information soon
after its outbreak is indispensable.
Early Emotet used spam emails containing Microsoft Ofﬁce
ﬁles with malicious macros. Later, around 2016-17, Emotet
replaced macros in spam emails with links through which
users downloaded malicious ﬁles. In 2018-20, Emotet often
downloaded TrickBot, a type of banking Trojan. Recently, it
has been downloading ransomware Ryuk, which encrypts ﬁles
on infected systems and demands a ransom.
Subjects of Emotet emails vary widely, but they generally
have the following characteristics. They may disguise the
content of invoices or orders, such as ”Invoice Payment Due,”
contain subjects related to banks and ﬁnancial institutions,
such as ”Transaction Notiﬁcation,” and use themes related to
important documents, such as ”Urgent: Read Immediately.”
Emotet can disguise ﬁle types and extensions and changes
them frequently, making it difﬁcult to identify Emotet by a
speciﬁc extension alone.
IV. SOFTWARE STRUCTURE
A. Program Overview
Figure 2 shows the structure of our Python program. Similar
tools and ideas to extract IoCs from Twitter were discussed in
Section II. The uniqueness of our program is to automate the
process of parsing Japanese words describing Emotet threats
and outputting graphs. The correctness of the output results
was veriﬁed by comparing sampled outputs with manually
calculated results.
As shown in Figure 2, input CSV ﬁles containing Emotet
tweets are processed sequentially, characteristic Emotet words
are extracted, and bar graphs are output. The following de-
scribes detailed steps 1)-6) executed by the modules in the
ﬁgure (because the news site program is roughly a subset of the
Twitter program in Figure 2, the two programs are described
simultaneously):
1) Tweet collection: Collect all Japanese tweets containing
string “emotet” using Twitter APIs. The numbers of such
tweets per month are shown in Figure 1. A Google
Chrome extension [21] that compiles tweets satisfying
search criteria into a CSV ﬁle was used.
2) URL collection: In the case of the Twitter analysis
program, collect all shortened URLs (http://t.co/)
in the tweet, and then convert all the shortened URLs
to the original URLs. Next, exclude all duplicate sites
by checking whether they have the same URL, title, or
text. In the case of the news site analysis program, collect
URLs of all Japanese articles available on the news site.
3) Text collection: Collect text bodies (the areas enclosed by
tags <p>) of web pages speciﬁed by the URLs mentioned
above through scraping if the page titles include “emotet.”
The reason why the areas enclosed by tags <p> are used
for text body extraction is explained later in this section.

Figure 2. Twitter analysis program written in Python designed to collect words about Emotet threat from Japanese tweets and output graphs.
4) Word collection: Extract nouns or compound nouns from
the texts obtained above using janome [22], a morpho-
logical analysis library.
5) Word classiﬁcation: Classify all collected words into
several categories based on the meanings of the words.
Collected words are diverse; they include a variety of
synonyms and contractions.
6) Graph generation: Create graphs (e.g., histograms) that
show the frequencies of characteristic Emotet words for
each category.
B. Web Page Analysis
In HyperText Markup Language (HTML) [23] documents,
the <p> tags are generally used to group text bodies into
paragraphs to provide appropriate styling and semantic sep-
arators for each paragraph. Meanwhile, the <div> tags are
used for semantic content grouping and styling and can group
different types of content, so that elements other than text
bodies (e.g., advertisements) can be placed within the <div>
tags. Although the <p> tag is generally not used directly for
advertising, it may be used, for example, to represent a caption
for an image or chart or to indicate a whole or part of a quote.
Program twitter_4_web_scraping.py in Figure 2
extracts body texts of web pages from text areas enclosed by
<p> tags in the HTML codes. Although <div> tags can also
be used to enclose text bodies, they tend to be used for areas
other than the body text. Table II compares the occupancy
rates (how much the body is enclosed) and unrelated rates
(how much the text area is not related to the body) of <p>
and <div>. For comparison, the ten most frequently tweeted
web pages and ten randomly selected Security NEXT news
articles were used. As can be seen from the table, the mean
occupancy rate is always high, independent of the tags and
the media types. On the other hand, the mean unrelated rates
of <p> for Twitter and the news site are not greater than
12.4%, whereas those of <div> exceed 85%. Thus, tags <p>
were used for text body extraction. Most unrelated texts in-
clude advertisements, recommendations, related articles, etc.,
so statistical results obtained using <div> tags are strongly
inﬂuenced by such texts.
C. Word Collection
Emotet spreads via spoofed emails with malicious ﬁle
attachments, and installs a variety of malware on the infected
devices. Accordingly, extensions of the attachments, subject
lines of the spoofed emails, and types of Emotet malware are
words that characterize currently popular Emotet variants and
are very valuable threat information.
The program set_1_word_classification.py in
Figure 2 collects characteristic Emotet words using regular
expressions, which specify match patterns in the body texts.
Table III exempliﬁes regular expressions for malware type
TrickBot and attachment extension ONE. As shown in the
table, Microsoft OneNote ﬁles correspond to those that include
either one or onenote.

<div> tags.

V. CALCULATION RESULTS
A. Data Size
We collected Japanese tweets and news articles describing
Emotet threats posted in the period from January 1, 2019 to
April 30, 2023. The numbers of Japanese tweets during this
period can be seen in Figure 1. Table IV shows the number of
websites we observed, the number of words (different words)
in all websites, and the execution times for characteristic word
extraction. The table indicates that Twitter provides larger
dataset sizes; the numbers of websites and words on Twitter
are 19 and 46 times greater than those of Security NEXT,
respectively. The table also indicates that the number of words
per website on Twitter is 2.5 times greater than that on Security
NEXT. According to Table II, no news articles include more
than 2,000 words, while some websites referenced from tweets
exceed 6,000 words.
The execution time for Twitter was approximately 16 times
longer than that for the news site. Much of the execution
time was spent collecting URLs and texts (steps 2)-3) in
Section IV). Therefore, the ratios of the execution times and
the numbers of websites between the two media types are
roughly the same.
B. Earliness
Emotet tactically distributes malware using spam emails
with malicious attachments. Therefore, malware types, exten-
sions of attachments, and subject lines of spam emails are
important threat trends. Let us ﬁrst verify how quickly these
trends were announced via Twitter and the news site. Table V
compares the dates when the two media reported each of the
ten Emotet malware types [24] [25] [26] for the ﬁrst time. As
shown in the table, Twitter reported at least 100 days earlier for
all malware types. In addition, there are four types that have
not appeared on the news site yet. It is clear that security
experts can more quickly share information about malware
variants via Twitter.
Tables VI and VII compare the dates when the two media
reported the ﬁle name extensions and email subject lines
used for Emotet infection for the ﬁrst time. Although Twitter
provides quicker reports for these categories as well, the two
categories show greater variability in delays than the malware
type category. Moreover, Twitter did not issue an alert for the
extension “ONE” and subject line “ﬁre inspection” earlier than

the news site. This result indicates that Twitter is not always
the ﬁrst to announce current Emotet threats.
C. Detailedness
Figure 3 illustrates the numbers of websites that described
each of the ten Emotet malware types per year from 2019
to the ﬁrst four months of 2023. Figs. 3 (left) and (right)
correspond to Twitter and Security NEXT, respectively. Note
that the vertical axis scale of Twitter is more than 10 times
larger than that of the news sites. Note also that four malware
types have not been reported on the news site yet. From the
ﬁgure, Twitter has more websites reporting Emotet malware
and more malware types than the news site for all years. Thus,
Twitter provides more detailed malware information each year
than the news site.
Figure 4 shows the numbers of websites that described each
of the seven malicious ﬁle extensions. Again, Twitter has more
detailed Emotet attachment information. For example, Figure
4 (left) indicates that Twitter has been alerting malicious XLS
attachments every year since 2019, whereas from Figure 4
(right), Security NEXT reported them only in 2022.
Figure 5 shows the numbers of websites that described
Emotet email subject types. Figure 5 (left) shows that at least
four subject types appeared every year, while Figure 5 (right)
shows that more than three types appeared only in 2020.
Malware types are shared among experts, while malicious
subject lines are sent to alert email users. Thus, information
on Twitter is useful to non-experts as well. In summary,
Twitter consistently provides far more detailed attack trends
than Security NEXT in terms of malware type, extension, and
subject line.
D. Reliability
This study evaluates the reliability of information from
two perspectives: reliability of websites and reliability of text

on the web pages. Table VIII compares eight measurements
of twenty websites randomly selected from those referenced
by Twitter and Security NEXT. The ﬁrst six measurements
are whether the website speciﬁes the writer’s name, writer’s
contact information, published/update date, Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) certiﬁcate [27], information source, and privacy
policy. The last two verify whether the site has link errors and
misspellings.
Table VIII concludes that Security NEXT is more reliable.
The news site is perfect except that it barely speciﬁes the
source of the news articles. Although Twitter also provides a
high score, reliability varies from one website to another. It
should be noted that Twitter is more likely to give link errors
and misspellings because, as shown in Table II, its text size is
larger in most cases.
Let us next see the reliability of text on the web pages.
Because it is difﬁcult to verify whether text includes fake
news, study detected discrepancies between two web pages
and considered that their descriptions are not fake if there
are no discrepancies. We detected discrepancies between two
pages describing the same security incident, where the number
of incidents we used was 53. Figure 6 shows the number
of pairs of web pages describing the same security incident
and the number of page pairs that include discrepancies in
their descriptions. From the ﬁgure, there are eight discrepant
pairs among 108 pairs referenced from different media, and
there is one discrepant pair among 110 pairs referenced
from Twitter. (The news site has one article per incident,
so there were no discrepancy checks between news articles.)
Thus, the percentage of discrepancies that occurred between
the two media (between the pages referenced in tweets) is
approximately 8% (1%).

nine pairs. The discrepancies are all small differences in
numbers and dates, except for incident 4, where two pages
reported different infection routes. In other words, excluding
minor numerical differences, the semantic discrepancy rate
between the two media is less than 1%. Thus, the rate at which
Twitter provides serious incorrect information is 1% at most.
VI. AUTOMATIC DISCREPANCY DETECTION
In the previous section, discrepancies in the descriptions of
two web pages were detected by humans. When large amounts
of text must be inspected, humans can make mistakes. There-
fore, this section veriﬁes whether ChatGPT can be applied
to discrepancy detection. OpenAI, an American AI research
laboratory, provides APIs [28] for easy access to various
ChatGPT models [29] for AI developers. It is well known that
slight differences in question wording could signiﬁcantly alter
ChatGPT’s answers. Thus, we decided to develop a program
that includes an OpenAI API to feed many similar questions
into a ChatGPT model.
Figure 7 shows a part of our Python program. The program
asks a question question about discrepancies between two
texts: text1 and text2. We prepared 144 questions with
almost the same meaning. Some of them are as follows:

Tables X and XI show the outputs of the AI program
for text pairs with and without discrepancies, respectively.
In the tables, TP and TN (FP and FN) denote the number
of outputs detecting discrepancies correctly (incorrectly) and
the number of outputs indicating no discrepancies correctly
(incorrectly), respectively, and “else” denotes the number of
unintelligible answers. The tables also present the percentages
of these numbers among all 144 answers. Table X shows that
the percentage of including correct answers (TP and TP &
FP) is 17.2%. Note that the sum of TP and TP & FP for

incident 2 is only 7. From this result, the 144 questions is
not necessarily too many. Meanwhile, Table XI shows that the
percentage of correctly answering no discrepancies is 28.7%.
Thus, GPT tends to present more correct answers for text pairs
without discrepancies than with discrepancies. This section
has revealed that even the latest AI technology still cannot
detect discrepancies automatically. In our opinion, GPT could
be used as an auxiliary tool that helps reduce false positive
and false negative errors.
VII. DISCUSSION
We have learned that it is possible to gather large amounts
of up-to-date threat information about Emotet through Twitter.
Furthermore, we have learned that the information is not
considerably less reliable than that of the security site used
for comparison. However, we also found that the following
considerations must be made before collecting information via
Twitter:
• Twitter alone is not enough.
Twitter tends to provide information on Emotet malware
and malicious attachment extensions much earlier than
the news site. However, there was a case where the news
site was quicker to warn about the subject line used in
Emotet emails.
• Diverse website structures.
Compared to the news site operated by a single organiza-
tion, information on Twitter is disseminated by a diverse
set of people. Therefore, when collecting information
via Twitter, it is necessary to consider the structure and
operating policies of the sites (e.g., update frequency,

scraping, and API). For instance, as shown in Table
II, Twitter cannot always provide body text successfully
using only <p> tabs, while the news site can.
• Text reliability veriﬁcation.
Table VIII suggests that Security NEXT is trustworthy,
but not all Twitter users are. In other words, Twitter
information should be veriﬁed in most cases. As dis-
cussed in Section VI, automatic discrepancy detection
is not possible at this time, so human veriﬁcation is
deﬁnitely required. According to the approach in Section
VI, we must consider how many questions we need to
prepare depending on the GPT version and parameters.
Another issue is how and how often we should ﬁnd
sources reporting the same security incident to perform
discrepancy detection. Currently, reliability is dependent
on the results of veriﬁcation by some valuable sources
[30].
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Today, many people retrieve threat information through
Twitter. Because there are so many accounts on Twitter and
anyone can freely transmit information, it is important to know
the quality of the information provided by Twitter in advance.
However, there have been insufﬁcient studies dealing with
this topic. This study measured quality based on earliness,
detailedness, and reliability, which are different from the
quality criteria used by previous studies.
To evaluate the quality of Twitter information, this study
collected tweets about Emotet threat from January 1, 2019 to
April 30, 2023, of which many tweets regarding Emotet were
shared in Japan. The quality was compared with that of news
articles provided by Security NEXT, a major cybersecurity
news site in Japan, which is expected to be very reliable.
Our results revealed that the quality of Twitter information
was far superior in terms of earliness and detailedness. How-
ever, in terms of reliability of websites, the news site achieved
a better score. The discrepancy rate between descriptions of the
same incidents provided by the two media was less than 1%
after minor numerical differences were excluded. Accordingly,
we concluded that the two media rarely contain incorrect
information.
In the future, we plan to develop a fake threat news moni-
toring system that will regularly collect texts about the same
security incidents from Twitter and news sites and publish
discrepancies on an ongoing basis.
