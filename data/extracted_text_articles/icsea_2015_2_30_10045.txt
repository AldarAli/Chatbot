Abstract— Over the last decade, many firms in the world have 
started adopting Global Software Development (GSD) in order 
to reduce software development cost, and access to qualified 
resources and modern technology. Due to the rapid 
development of ICTs, the GSD has become an acceptable 
business strategy with several paradigms. One of the rising 
business paradigms of GSD is Offshore Software Development 
Outsourcing (OSDO). The objective of this research is to 
provide mitigation advice for addressing communication and 
coordination challenges from vendors' perspectives in OSDO 
relationships. We have performed systematic literature review 
(SLR) process for identifying the practices/solutions for these 
challenges. We have identified 65 practices for addressing 
these challenges. This paper can help the OSDO vendor 
organizations to use the identified practices in order to address 
the communication and coordination challenges in OSDO 
relationships.

INTRODUCTION 
Many software development companies from the last 
decade have been trying to enhance their business profits by 
improving the time-to-market of their products, reducing 
costs by hiring people from countries with cheaper work-
hours. These days, a large number of software development 
projects are distributed at many different sites and normally 
located in different countries. This distributed setting of 
managing a software project is termed as Global Software 
Development (GSD) and the discipline is termed as Global 
Software Engineering (GSE) [1]. One of the rising business 
paradigms of global software development is Offshore 
Software Development Outsourcing (OSDO) [2]. OSDO 
represents the practices of holding an outside party to carry 
out software development work/processes in a state/country 
other than the one where the products or services are 
actually developed [3]. Today many software organizations 
have turned to software outsourcing to get economic cost 
advantages [4]. Over the last decade outsourcing functions 
gain competitive advantages due to different reasons, such 
as the drastic growth in the ICTs market and shortage of 
information system professionals [4]. In addition, China and 
India have made the OSDO a reality due to the presence of 
qualified persons, the availability of resources, skills and 
better business and economic environment [4]. 
However, several researchers [5]-[6] recommended that 
increased globalization of software development creates 
challenges due to cultural differences, time zone differences, 
lack of trust, language differences, geographical distance 
and diversity of communication and coordination. Ali-Babar 
et al. [7] suggested that the main stumbling block to OSDO 
is the geographical dispersion. The two major pillars and the 
backbone 
of 
successful 
OSDO 
activities 
are 
the 
communication and coordination processes, but it can be 
hampering due to geographical dispersion, cultural and 
language differences [8]. The lack of face-to-face meetings 
is one of the challenges and it affects the process of OSDO 
[9].  
In OSDO relationship, Khan et al. [10] identified various 
critical challenges faced by vendor organizations. In these 
challenges, communication and coordination is a critical 
challenge to vendors in OSDO. Our prior research identified 
a list of 18 communication and coordination challenges 
faced by vendors in OSDO relationships [5]. Amongst the 
identified list of challenges 6 were marked as critical 
challenges. These identified critical challenges are: 
‘Geographical 
Dispersion’, 
‘Cultural 
Differences’, 
‘Language Differences’, ‘Lack of Credence’, ‘Lack of 
ICT/Technological Cohesion’ and ‘Lack of Informal/ Face-
to-Face Communication’ [5].  
It is also important to provide mitigation advice in the 
form of practices for the identified critical challenges as this 
will help organizations facing these challenges. For this 
reason, we conducted a SLR process for finding the 
practices for addressing the aforementioned critical 
communication and coordination challenges in OSDO 
outsourcing relationships form vendor’s perspectives.  
We have formulated the following research question in 
order 
to 
understand 
the 
practices/solutions 
for 
communication and coordination challenges in OSDO 
relationships.  
RQ. What are the solutions/practices, as identified in the 
literature, for addressing communication and coordination 
challenges 
in 
OSDO 
relationships 
from 
vendors' 
perspective?

The structure of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section II explains the background. Section III explains the 
research methodology. Results are presented in Section IV. 
Study limitations are discussed in Section V. Conclusion 
and future works are presented in Section VI. 
II.  BACKGROUND 
In software outsourcing paradigm, various challenges and 
hurdles are faced by vendor organizations. Different 
researchers and practitioners have conducted case studies, 
questionnaire surveys, focus group sessions, interviews and 
literature reviews to dig out various aspects of the OSDO 
relationship. 
Alberto Avritzer et al. [11] conducted a case study and 
suggested that geographic dispersion in global software 
engineering can be reduced by organizing face to face 
meetings, effective time management among the team 
members and "hands-on and Shake-off session", providing 
possibilities of synchronous communication, giving support 
for video conference at all sites and also giving suitable 
selection of communication tools. Cultural differences in 
OSDO can be reduced by providing the facilities of face to 
face 
meeting, 
cultural 
training, 
adopt 
low-context 
communication style, cultural liaison/Ambassador and 
reduce interaction between team from different cultures 
[12]. The problems of cultural differences can also be 
mitigated by adapting agile and scrum methods [13]. 
Similarly the temporal distance in offshore outsourcing can 
be reduced by establishing a bridging team, relocate to 
adjacent time zone, adopt and follow the sun development, 
using appropriate and advance technology, such as ICT, 
audio and video conferencing, instant messaging, online 
chat, email, web came and mobile alerts [11]. 
We can reduce the lack of trust in global software 
development 
by 
managing 
efficient 
outsourcing 
relationships, 
establishment 
of 
an 
appropriate 
communication and infrastructure, to encourage effective 
communication through the adaptation of tools and 
techniques and promotion of informal communication [12]. 
The probable solutions of language differences in global 
software development are composed of translating policies 
and practices into local languages and by putting emphasis 
on spoken language skills [14]. 
The lack of ICT or technological cohesion in global 
software development can be reduced by using proper 
communication technologies or tools, such as, internet, 
video conferencing, data conferencing, teleconferencing, 
telephone calls, chats, emails, instant messaging, shared 
databases, Wikis, shared desk top technology, net meeting, 
change management system, virtual whiteboards, photo 
gallery, team Intranet websites, electronic meeting systems, 
voicemail, CAMEL, NEXTMOVE, TAMRI, Dropbox, 
Mendeley, IRC and Skype etc [15]. Lack of face-to-face or 
informal communication problems in OSDO relationship 
can be reduced by provision of multiple communication 
mode counting support to face-to-face synchronous 
communication, creation of communication protocols, to 
promote informal interactions, to apply agile practices 
(SCRUM), to deploy knowledge transfer mechanisms [16]. 
By using SLR for identifying the practices/solutions for 
communication and coordination challenges in OSDO 
relationships from a vendor's perspective will confine the 
missing communication and coordination practices in 
OSDO relationship. The novelty of our research shows that 
nobody has conducted SLR in this domain to find out 
practices for addressing communication and coordination 
challenges faced to vendors in OSDO relationships. The 
findings will assist OSDO vendor organizations to adopt the 
identified practices in order to avoid/mitigate 
the 
communication and coordination challenges in OSDO 
relationships.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
A SLR [17] process was used for data collection, 
because it is more thorough, less biased, rigorous and open 
as compared to ordinary literature review [17]. In finding, 
evaluating and summarizing all available evidences on a 
specific research question, a systematic review may provide 
a greater level of validity in its findings than ordinary 
literature review. A number of researchers [5][18] have used 
the SLR approach for reviewing the literature. Protocol 
development is the first phase of the SLR process and it 
describes planning of the review. In this connection, a 
systematic review protocol was written first to describe the 
plan for the review. Details of the various steps in our SLR 
methodology are available in our SLR protocol [18].  
A. Search the Literature 
Based on the available access, the digital libraries IEEE 
Explore, ScienceDirect, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink 
and CiteSeer were used to carry out the search phase of the 
SLR. We used the following search string as a trial search:  
((Solutions OR practices OR "best practice" OR "lessons 
learned" 
OR 
Advice) 
AND 
("communication 
and 
coordination 
problems" 
OR 
" 
communication 
and 
coordination challenges" OR " communication and 
coordination norms" OR " communication and coordination 
barriers" OR " communication and coordination risks") 
AND ("offshore software outsourcing" OR "information 
systems outsourcing" OR "IS outsourcing" OR "IT 
outsourcing" OR "global software development" OR GSD 
OR "offshore software development outsourcing" OR 
OSDO)) 
The major search string was developed and validated 
after thoroughly getting information and guidance from the 
trial search. Some digital libraries required different 
concrete syntax for the search term; we developed the

search string for each resource. In our study, we identify the 
paper based on the publication’s type, such as conference 
proceeding, 
databases, 
specific 
journals, 
technical 
magazines, book chapters, technical books, web pages and 
reports, etc. In Table I, we represent the final list of 
resources to be searched also including their search terms 
and number of publications found in each resource.

We have selected these resources based on our previous 
SLRs [5][20] experiences and discussions with our 
colleagues at the University. 
B. Literature Selection 
In this section, we are going to presents the criteria for 
inclusion and exclusion of relevant articles. 
a. 
Inclusion criteria 
We use the following inclusion criteria for the selection 
of relevant papers: 
 
The paper must be relevant to Computer Sciences or 
Engineering research background because quality 
research topics in software applications are keep 
growing from time to time. 
 
Priority usually goes to journal and conference 
published papers- that is why in our final selection the 
majority of papers are journal and conference papers. 
 
The papers should at least contain challenges, practices 
and 
solutions 
related 
to 
communication 
and 
coordination in OSDO relationships. 
 
The 
papers 
should 
contain 
communication 
or 
coordination 
practices/solutions 
affecting 
the 
continuation 
or 
termination 
of 
outsourcing 
relationships. 
 
Studies that is relevant to outsourcing.  
b. Exclusion criteria 
We use the following exclusion criteria to exclude the 
irrelevant papers: 
 
The papers not relevant to Computer Sciences or 
Engineering research background. 
 
The studies not relevant to the research questions. 
 
The papers that are not written in English. 
 
Studies not mentioned the challenges/ practices/ 
solutions of communication or coordination in OSDO 
relationships. 
 
Studies that contain duplicate data. 
 
Studies not relevant to outsourcing. 
C. Publication Quality Assessment 
The publication quality assessment is performed after 
final selection of publications. During the selection process 
of studies, some questions were asked to ensure the quality 
of selected studies. The questions in Table II were 
constructed to facilitate the studies selection process and to 
ensure that only relevant papers are being selected. The 
questions used in the study selection process are shown in 
the Table II.  
TABLE II STUDY SELECTION PROCESS 
Question 
Answer 
Is it clear how communication or coordination 
practices/solution was measured in OSDO 
relationship? 
Yes/No/Partially 
Is it clear how the practices in the selection of 
software outsourcing vendors were identified? 
Yes/No/Partially 
By using publication quality assessment questions, 
studies that are not scholarly reviewed were excluded. Only 
those studies are selected that aim practices at addressing 
communication and coordination challenges in OSDO 
relationships. Similarly, studies that did not provide 
persuasive 
results 
in 
practices 
for 
addressing 
communication and coordination challenges in the aspects 
of OSDO relationships were excluded.  
D. Data Extraction and Synthesis 
The 
following 
data 
was 
extracted 
from 
each 
publication: Date of review, Title, Authors, Reference, 
Database, Practices/Solutions: factors that have a positive 
impact on software development outsourcing vendors, 
Methodology (interview, case study, ordinary literature 
review, systematic literature review, report, survey, etc), 
Target Population, Sample Population, Publication Quality 
Description, Organization Type (software house, university, 
research institute etc), Company size (small, medium, 
large), Country/location of the Analysis and Year. 
The data synthesis phase was done by the primary 
reviewer (the primary author) with the help of secondary 
reviewer (the co-author). After a thorough review with 
external reviewer, we have identified 65 practices/solutions 
from the sample of 62 papers for addressing communication 
and coordination challenges.

E. Classification of Communication and Coordination 
practices/solutions 
After identifying practices/solutions for addressing 
communication and coordination challenging in OSDO 
relationships 
through 
SLR, 
we 
classified 
a 
few 
practices/solutions in different tables as shown in Section 
IV. The classification of practices/solutions was based upon 
the relevant practices/solutions for the identified critical 
challenges in our previous research [5]. The following 
criterion for the selection of critical challenges was used: 
 
Those challenges were considered as critical 
challenges whose frequency was equal to 40% or higher 
than 40%. The identified critical communication and 
coordination challenges are ‘Geographical dispersion’, 
‘cultural differences’, ‘language differences’ ‘lack of 
technological cohesion’, 'Lack of Informal/Face-to-to face 
Communication' and 'Lack of Credence'. 
IV. 
RESULTS 
This section presents the results of the SLR process for 
finding 
the 
practices/solutions 
for 
addressing 
communication and coordination challenges faced by 
OSDO vendors.  
We identified 65 mitigation advices/practices/solutions 
for addressing communication and coordination challenges 
faced to OSDO vendors. SLR has been conducted in the 
area of OSDO relationships for the identification of these 
practices. The OSDO vendor organizations can also get help 
from these practices in order to know that how they can 
solve the problems of their clients. We have followed SLR 
guidelines [17] for synthesizing the different practices for 
the identified critical communication and coordination 
challenges.  
The subsequent sections present the 6 critical challenges 
and their respective identified practices. 
A. Geographical Dispersion 
Ali-Babar et al. [7] suggested that the main stumbling 
block to OSDO is the geographical dispersion. Table III 
presents the list of our identified 15 practices for addressing 
the 
communication 
and 
coordination 
challenge 
'Geographical Dispersion'.

Synchronous communication, such as face-to-face 
meetings, online chats, teleconferences, and web 
conferences, is ideal for quick status meetings, 
brainstorming sessions, and reviews. Asynchronous 
communication, such as email, discussion forums, 
and shared documents, provides a persistent record 
of discussions and decisions, and don’t require 
participants to be available at the same time

STUDY LIMITATIONS 
By using the SLR process, we have extracted data about 
the practices/solutions for addressing communication and 
coordination challenges; however, we might have omitted 
some practices? For internal validity, one possible threat is 
that any specific article may have not in fact described 
underlying reasons to report practices/solutions for 
addressing these challenges. This threat has not been 
independently controlled by us. Other threat is publication 
bias during SLR process. By using our SLR process, we 
may have missed out some relevant papers, due to the 
increasing number of papers in software outsourcing. 
However, like other researchers of SLR, this is not a 
systematic omission [21].  
How valid are our findings? The results of our finding 
are not based on studies that used a random sample of 
software developing outsourcing organization in the world. 
Yet, in the exploration of our research question, our study is 
the most comprehensive up to date. As discussed in result 
sections, the dilemma of simplifying our findings can also 
be measured by evaluating the finding of other related 
studies. To provide support for simplification, we found 
many similarities in our findings as compare to other 
people’s findings. In order to decrease the researcher’s bias, 
we have carried out the inter-rater reliability tests in the 
selection of primary studies and data extraction phases. Due 
to limited resources and not enough access to every digital 
library, we were unable to find out all the relevant papers in 
our area, although, the used digital libraries are sufficient for 
the simplification of findings in our study.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper, we have provided mitigation advice in the 
form of practices for addressing communication and 
coordination challenges from vendors' perspectives in 
OSDO relationships. Our results reveal that focusing on 
these practices can help vendor organizations in order to 
strengthen their relationships with client organizations in 
OSDO. However, we recommend independent studies on 
this topic in global software development. This will increase 
confidence in our results and also track changes in attitudes 
to OSDO activities over time. We have identified the

following goals that we plan to follow in future from the 
findings of this study: 
 
The practices/solutions for addressing communication 
and coordination challenges will be validated using 
empirical studies with practitioners working in 
outsourcing industries, as done by other researchers 
[22][23].  
 
The practices/solutions in OSDO relationships from 
client’s perspectives will be analyzed. 
Our future work will focus on developing a 
Communication Coordination Challenges Mitigation Model 
(CCCMM). This paper gives only one component of the 
CCCMM, 
such 
as 
the 
identification 
of 
various 
practices/solutions for addressing communication and 
coordination challenges via SLR. The proposed CCCMM 
will bring together and advance the work that has been 
undertaken on frameworks and models for outsourcing 
relationships.
