Abstract— This paper presents selected issues related to 
Internet Access Service (IAS) quality assessment. Nowadays, it 
is not only the price, but quality, that influences the decisions 
of users regarding the choice of Internet Service Provider 
(ISP). According to European documents, users have a right to 
be informed of IT services offered by different providers. 
However, there is a problem: what, where and how to measure 
the service quality? The second issue is: how service quality is 
perceived by users and, finally, how to correlate these two 
different points of view. We discuss selected objective measures 
of the Internet Access Service and present measurement 
scenarios. The users’ point of view and the subjective measure 
of quality is also presented. In the second part of the paper, we 
show how the users perceive Internet Access by the services 
they use. An example of building the Quality of Experience 
model for the WWW service is also presented. 
Keywords-Internet access; quality assessment; QoS; QoE; 
WWW quality model.

 INTRODUCTION 
In March 2010, the European Commission has launched 
a strategy entitled “Europe 2020”, which sets the objectives 
for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of the European 
Union by 2020 [1]. The Digital Agenda [2] forms one of the 
seven pillars of the strategy and defines the key enabling role 
that 
the 
use 
of 
Information 
and 
Communication 
Technologies (ICT) will have to play in Europe in future 
years. It is supposed to support a better quality of life, e.g., 
through better health care, safer and more efficient transport, 
a cleaner environment, new media opportunities and easier 
access to public services and cultural content. The Internet 
will be used as a vital medium for conducting business, as 
well as aiding work, play and communication between users. 
I will also be the center of the future economy, which will be 
based on network-based knowledge. It is assumed that by 
2020 all Europeans will have access to Internet speeds of 
above 30 Mbps and at least 50% of the households will 
subscribe to Internet connections above 100 Mbps. 
According to the European Commission, the digital 
sector grows seven times faster than other parts of industry. 
Thus, in September 2016, new Commission strategy 
documents on Connectivity for a European Gigabit Society 
were adopted [3]. They set a vision of Europe where 
“availability and take-up of very high capacity networks 
enable the widespread use of products, services and 
applications in the Single Digital Market”. A vision of 
“Broadband Europe” assumes the building of the Gigabit 
Society by 2025 and relies on three main strategic objectives: 
 
Gigabit connectivity for all main of socio-economic 
drivers, 
 
uninterrupted 5G coverage for all urban areas and 
major terrestrial transport paths, 
 
access to connectivity offering at least 100 Mbps for 
all European households. 
Consumer research has revealed that price is still the 
most important attribute taken into account when choosing 
an Internet access service for 20% of users [4]. The second 
decision-making factor is the data cap, i.e., the monthly limit 
on the amount of data a user can use with an Internet 
connection. Moreover, what happens when a user hits their 
limit is a very important issue. ISPs then engage in different 
actions such as slowing down data speeds, charging extra 
fees, or preventing further usage. 
The next important factors, which may influence user 
attitude to an ISP offer, are service differentiation and traffic 
management such as prioritization, blocking or throttling. 
These practices aim to preserve the appropriate conditions 
for providing high-quality services. Nonetheless, in recent 
years these activities have raised questions about network 
neutrality, which assumes that all content and applications 
should receive equal treatment. Moreover, neutrality also 
means that providers neither impose nor discriminate in 
favor of using a particular type of technology [5][6]. 
Consumer awareness of network neutrality and traffic 
management is rather low. On one hand, most people have 
very little knowledge about these terms and, on the other 
hand, they do not see the influence of these issues on their 
Internet usage. As is shown in [7], consumers care very little 
for all the technicalities connected with data transport and 
the role of ISPs. Users are not interested in net neutrality or 
traffic management practices and instead are tied to their 
experience of traffic management effects. 
Germany’s “Wissenschaftliches Institut für Infrastruktur 
und Kommunikationsdienste” (WIK-Consult) study, which 
concentrates on contract-based consulting services for public 
and private institutions, asked a series of questions about the 
way consumers would respond to specific changes in the 
traffic management policies operated by their ISP, e.g., the 
31

introduction of throttling on video traffic, or of data caps. A 
significant majority of respondents said that they would even 
change the provider in response to some significant changes 
in the traffic management policies of their ISP [4]. 
The issues mentioned above show a much higher interest 
of users in their ISP traffic engineering operations when 
these activities touch the concrete services and influence the 
users’ experience. Nowadays, users not only trust the service 
level agreements of their providers, but also want to be able 
to check them. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 
II, we present a general overview of IAS structure from the 
technical perspective as well as the users’ point of view. 
Next, in Section III, the main parameters that may influence 
quality are discussed and the quality measurements of IAS, 
according to the present standards, are presented. Section IV 
describes the service quality issues as perceived by users. We 
underline the difference between objective quality measures 
and the subjective users’ perception of different services 
used by them. We validate the need to build quality models 
for the most popular services and mention WWW browsing 
as one of them. In Section V, the Quality of Experience 
(QoE) model for the WWW service is discussed. We present 
the laboratory test-bed, measurement results and method of 
the model derivation. The paper ends with a conclusion and 
the plans for future work. 
II. 
INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE 
One of the major factors influencing the decision of users 
when choosing an ISP is the Internet Access connection 
throughput offered by the provider. However, there are many 
misunderstandings regarding this term. Physically, it is a 
combination of different connections and services that are 
needed to establish a functioning Internet access. Each of 
them can be treated as a separate service. Most users, 
however, treat Internet access as an access to the end-to-end 
services available on the Internet. A purely physical access to 
the Internet has no practical meaning to them. Thus, Internet 
access is generally understood as a platform that provides 
access to Internet services, such as e-mail and Web 
browsing, etc. From a technical point of view, however, the 
primary meaning of the term Internet access should be 
understood as a physical and logical access to the core of the 
network, including all functionalities needed to enable the 
user to establish a connection to further entities in the 
Internet and to run advanced services [8]. 
Providers often advertise the maximum values of the 
throughput, which is rarely accessible, due to it being 
strongly connected strongly connected with the variable 
traffic load and the still increasing demand for data 
transmission bandwidth in recent years. Many users often 
expect such throughputs for most of the day, irrespective of 
the time and network conditions. 
Unfortunately, according to the CISCO forecast, 
presented in Visual Networking Index [9], global IP traffic 
will increase nearly threefold over the next 5 years and by 
2020 will reach 2.3 ZB per year. 
Moreover, traffic load varies significantly during the day.

Figure 1.  General overview of elements and network sections of IAS. 
traffic is growing more rapidly than average Internet traffic. 
It increased by 51 percent in 2015, compared with a 29-
percent growth in average traffic. It means that service 
providers will face even higher network load fluctuations and 
more serious traffic engineering problems than up to now. 
Users can be connected to the various ISPs via the access 
networks, 
using 
wired 
or 
wireless 
connections. 
Communication over the Internet requires data interchange 
over different National and International eXchange Points 
(NXPs and IXPs). Figure 1 presents a generic overview of 
the elements, network sections and interfaces of the IAS 
according to [10]. 
A very important issue is the proper definition of the 
Internet Access Service (IAS). The answer to this question is 
not only crucial for the users, who are usually not familiar 
with the technical details, but also for the providers as well, 
because it determines the user-to-network and network-to-
network interfaces and also the responsibilities of the 
providers. 
Finally, it says how IAS quality should be measured and 
how the results can be interpreted and compared between 
different providers and their end-users. It is especially 
important in the light of European regulation [11] on the 
rights of users to be informed about the quality of their 
services. 
III. 
IAS MEASUREMENTS 
Identifying the parameters that may affect the Quality of 
Service 
(QoS), 
locating 
the 
points 
at 
which 
the 
measurements should be performed and specifying the 
measurement scenarios is a sequence that should be done 
before the measurements. Simply speaking, one should 
specify “what, where and how” should be measured to 
provide ISPs and users with a thorough knowledge of the 
QoS. 
The measurements fall into two groups: so called “In-
net” and “Over-The-Top” (OTT). The first case covers the 
ISP’s area - the area on which it acts. European Consumer 
Center (ECC) Report [10] specifies a list of technical quality 
parameters proposed to be measured during a technical 
evaluation of IAS. 
Many National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) or other 
national institutions agree that the list is too long. They also 
consider it to be too complicated and incomprehensible to 
the average user. Thus, they propose the selection of a subset 
of parameters. After consulting an abundance of documents 
[8][10][12] and different points of view, the ECC has 
32

proposed a list of minimum technical parameters that take 
their influence on the most popular Internet applications into 
account. Table 1, based on [10], illustrates popular services 
and the relevance of the network performance parameters to 
the performance or quality of those services. The relevance 
ranges from “−” (irrelevant) to “+++” (very relevant). 
The following quality metrics have been selected: data 
transmission rate, delay, delay variation, packet loss ratio, 
and packet error ratio.

The data transmission rate is probably the most relevant 
parameter, nearly mentioned in every ISP’s offer. It is 
defined as the data transmission rate that is achieved 
separately for downloading and uploading specified test files 
between a remote website and a user’s terminal equipment 
[8]. The next parameter is delay, defined as half the time (in 
ms) that is needed for an ICMP packet to reach a valid IP 
address. This parameter also has a significant influence on 
many applications available over the Internet and is already 
being used by many NRAs, operators and Web-based speed 
meters. There are also some applications that are very 
sensitive to delay variation and this parameter is therefore 
selected for measurements. The exact definition of delay 
variation can be found in [12][13]. 
IP packets can sometimes be dropped, e.g., due to a small 
buffer size of the network nodes or poor (radio) connection, 
even if the transmission rate, delay, and delay variation 
remain good enough. Such packet loss can significantly 
affect all data-based applications. Moreover, UDP-based 
applications, such as Voice over IP may also not work 
properly in such conditions. Packet loss ratio can be defined 
as the ratio of the total lost IP packet occurrences to the total 
number of packets in the population under examination [13]. 
The parameter that may have an influence on the quality of 
service is the packet error rate and was therefore also 
included in the basic set of measured parameters shown in 
Table 1. The IP packet error ratio is sometimes called the 
packet error ratio and is defined as the ratio of the total faulty 
IP packet occurrences to the total number of successful IP 
packet deliveries plus the faulty IP packet occurrences within 
a population of interest. 
Internet access is no longer provided by a single network 
or service provider, as was the case with traditional voice 
communication in Public Switched Telephone Networks 
(PSTNs). Nowadays, a user gains an indirect access to the 
public Internet, as shown in Figure 1. Therefore, the overall 
quality of services (or, in general, Internet access) is a 
combination of the performance of all the elements involved 
in the connection. 
Different approaches to QoS measurements are discussed 
in literature. One of the classifications points out the methods 
as follows: 
 
carried out by the carefully selected users running 
the measurement tests from designated locations (or 
users’ homes) and using special purpose equipment 
[10][14][15], 
 
large-scale user-driven tests, performed by software 
agents installed on PCs, tablets, smartphones, etc. 
[14]. 
 
On the other hand, the measurements can be performed 
by network or service providers, regulators or designated 
third-party institutions. Different solutions are used in 
different countries. Many providers do it individually but 
their results may be regarded by users as non-objective. 
Thus, external institutions are needed here. Such institutions 
are very often national regulators or the external companies 
hired by the regulators. The first solution is used, e.g., in 
Portugal [14], while the second approach, based on “QoS 
Memorandum” [16], is used in Poland. 
At the European level, the minimum set of QoS 
parameters and measurement methods for retail Internet 
Access Service has been described in [10]. According to this, 
the measuring points to be used during the IAS quality 
assessment may be specified (Figure 2). 
Three evaluation methods (scenarios) are relevant to the 
measurements connected with IAS quality assessment. The 
methods encompass an examination of the access network, 
the ISP network and the network connections to NXP or 
IXP. 
Their names are listed below: 
 
QoS evaluation within the ISP leg, 
 
QoS evaluation between the Network Termination 
Point (NTP) and NXP(s), 
 
QoS evaluation between the NTP and IXP(s).

Depending on the scenario, the measurement server 
should be located in the right place (cf. Figure 2). 
In order to only test the access network, the test server 
should be located as close as possible to the gateway (GW) 
between the access network and the ISP network. In the case 
of evaluating the entire ISP leg quality, the test server should 
be placed near the public Internet interface (PGW in 
Figure 2). Locating the test server in the National eXchange 
Point (NXP) allows the network performance parameters of 
different ISPs to be compared. The quality results achieved 
in this scenario seem to be far closer to the quality of Internet 
connection, as perceived by users, than the results in the “ISP 
leg” scenario. 
It can be seen that the Internet Access Service quality 
assessment is therefore a very demanding issue, especially as 
users care about their own quality experience, which is 
commonly understood as unrestricted, high-quality and 
having a reliable access to the applications they use and the 
content they seek out online. This is the reason for 
performing the second type of measurements presented in 
Figure 2. They were called “OTT measurements”, because 
they allow the performance parameters of specific 
applications run by the users to be tested and thus they, in 
general, better reflect the quality of service as perceived by 
the user. Nonetheless, these are measurements of the 
objective parameters and, in the next step, should be 
transformed into the quality measures as perceived by users. 
Mapping the measured QoS factors to the QoE ones is often 
quite a complicated process. The next paragraph presents an 
example of WWW service quality assessment as perceived 
by users. 
IV. 
SERVICE QUALITY PERCEIVED BY USERS 
In this paragraph, we present an example of the service 
quality assessment procedure based on the WWW service. 
The WWW is one of the most popular services, if not the 
most important of all, used by Internet users. Many of them 
assess the Internet quality through the lens of Web browsing 
and information searching on the Internet. The main 
parameter that influences the service quality, as perceived by 
the user, is Web page opening (loading) time. In other words, 
the end-to-end (e2e) delay between the user’s request and the 
time when the page is open on the user’s display is the most 
important. The WWW service quality evaluation procedure 
will be treated as one of the factors that influence the user’s 
perception of the IAS. The WWW service evaluation in the 
real network may be performed as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3.  WWW service quality assessment. 
After objective measuring of the Web page opening 
times, the service quality perceived by the end-users, i.e., the 
relation between QoS and QoE, should be found. In other 
words the QoE model for the service should be determined. 
By presenting the WWW quality assessment, the author 
would like to underline that measuring and presenting only 
the network performance parameters to the customers, 
discussed in previous sections of the paper, may not be 
sufficient for determining the IAS quality as perceived by the 
users. There is a need to check the service quality 
experienced by them and building such a model requires a 
special laboratory environment. The one used here is 
presented in Figure 4. 
The laboratory test-bed consists of a WWW client with a 
measuring tool, a test server that hosts a set of special 
prepared WWW pages and the Network Emulator (NE). All 
the machines and software run under the MS Windows 
operating system. As a user client, the Mozilla Firefox 
browser was used while the measuring tool was the 
Wireshark protocol analyzer. The NE was capable of 
emulating the impairment parameters such as network delay, 
jitter and packet loss. This stage of the measurements only 
studied the impact of the delay on the service quality as 
perceived by the users. The delays were randomly generated 
by the NE while the users tried to open the Web pages on the 
test server. Next, the packets were captured by the Wireshark 
and analyzed. The users did not know the strict values of the 
delays, but they did see the effects and tried to assess them. 
It was clear that the Web page opening times had 
a decisive influence on QoS values for the WWW service. It 
was to be expected that increases in end-to-end delay would 
lead not only to deterioration of QoS but to QoE values as 
well. Quality of Experience was expressed by the user’s 
evaluation grades according to the Mean Opinion Score 
(MOS) scale [17]. The first observations confirmed these 
expectations, but it was also noticed that the subjective 
opinion of users depended highly on the page properties, i.e., 
their content, layout, construction (static, dynamic), etc. For 
subjective measurements the WWW reference page was 
needed. Static Web pages were launched on the test server 
and the contents of these pages were different. One of them 
was prepared according to ETSI reference page requirements 
[18], while in the second case a photo gallery was used. In 
that case a special scenario of the WWW pages presentation 
and evaluation was prepared. 
The scenario assumed that every user, when evaluating 
Web opening times (equivalents of end-to-end delays during 
normal Web browser use), should give his grade after seeing 
several photos so that he would be better able to make a 
judgment.

The test was performed on a user’s PC (WWW client 
with a measurement tool). Additionally, Wireshark software 
installed on the client’s PC (as a second tool) was used to 
capture IP packet streams and to register the end-to-end 
delay time. This was defined as the difference between the 
point in time at which the Web page was requested and the 
point in time at which all data needed for the display of the 
Web page were received. The end-to-end delay was varied 
throughout the course of the experiment using the NE. It was 
noticed that the Web page opening times that were registered 
at the user site played a crucial role in the subjective 
evaluation of WWW service quality (QoE). There were 
several groups of professional users (each group of 10) 
taking part in the experiment (more than 70 users in total). 
They gave their subjective grades for WWW service quality 
in a range from 1 to 5 on the MOS scale. More than 1500 test 
measurements were conducted. In the next step the statistical 
analysis has been performed. 
V. 
THE QOE MODEL 
The measurements show that the grades of users are 
inversely proportionate to the Web page opening times. To 
speak in more detail, the people who took part in the 
evaluation test were quite critical with regards to the service 
under analysis: a rapid decrease in the quality can be 
observed for the Web page opening times (T) covered in the 
first few seconds. It shows that users are very critical in their 
opinions and do not accept long delays. The longer the Web 
opening times, the lower grades users give. For the delays 
exceeding 10 s, the grades of users tend to be significantly 
lower at a level of 2, which means that such long times are 
unacceptable for WWW users. 
The analysis of the results leads to the conclusion that 
users had a considerable problem with evaluating Web page 
opening times with very high fluctuations. The measurement 
results obtained are consistent with those presented in 
literature [19]. It can be noticed that users are willing to 
award very high grades for the service (MOS = 5) when 
opening times are under 2 s, while the lower grades (MOS 
less than 2) are given when opening times are 8 s and more. 
In individual cases the evaluation grades may differ 
significantly from the majority of the scores and thorough 
statistical analysis should therefore should be carried out. As 
can be seen in Figure 5, the mean values for the specific page 
opening times were not only determined, but min and max 
values and standard deviation as well. 
The correlation between the opening times and the user 
grades achieved here is at a level of 80 %. The standard 
deviation is indicated by the dashed boxes in Figure 5, while 
whiskers represent the distances between the minimal and 
maximal values of the captured page opening times. This 
shows a high level of user uncertainty during the evaluation 
process. 
As it is known from the former experiments [19][20], 
during long waiting times many users begin to consider 
whether waiting for the page to open makes sense, and many 
of them resign. To find a precise relation between the 
captured values of Web opening times and the quality 
experienced by users, a regression model was used.

The model we derived can be described by the following 
formula:


where: T is the Web page opening time. 
 
The logarithmic line (Figure 5) represents the Q value (in 
MOS scale) as a function of Web opening times. The 
statistical analysis proved that the model fits the data very 
well, with the coefficient of determination (R2) above 0.9. It 
means that the obtained outcomes are replicated by the 
model in at least 90 % of the time. Confirmation of such a 
user’s QoE distribution can be found in the analysis results 
presented by the above-mentioned ITU-T recommendation 
[19], where attention had also been drawn to the logarithmic 
nature of the relation between QoS and QoE in such a case. 
A possibility of determining the prospective MOS value 
by managing the opening times is very valuable and more 
convenient for the provider than performing the subjective 
evaluations, which are time consuming and more expensive. 
VI. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
Internet Access Service is a key factor that influences a 
user’s perception of all the services provided on the Web. 
Thus, service providers have to do all their best to offer a 
good quality IAS. Moreover, they should monitor the 
network transmission parameters and be up to date with their 
values. Usage of the appropriate measurement methods is 
therefore very important. The methods can use different 
scenarios. In order to make the results credible and 
comparable with others, these scenarios should be clear and 
measurement interfaces and procedures have to be clearly 
defined. The paper shows the different measurement 
solutions that can be used. In the second part of the paper the 
author stressed the importance of subjective quality 
assessment methods, which are based on the experience of 
users and give more information about their perception. They

assess the Internet Access quality through the quality of the 
services that they use. One of the most popular is the WWW 
service. Therefore, the author presented the example of a 
Web browsing quality evaluation scenario, specified the key 
quality parameter and showed the results of measurements. 
At the end, the QoE model was proposed and discussed. The 
main conclusion is that the quality measurements should not 
only take into account the objective parameters, but 
subjective parameters as well. Obviously, the set of the 
parameters depends on the service. Future work will be 
devoted to WWW QoE model enhancement by specifying a 
wider set of parameters to be measured and to also build 
reference Web pages that will be more representative for 
current Internet content.
