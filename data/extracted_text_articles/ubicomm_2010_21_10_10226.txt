Abstract-- A double-edged sword phenomenon is illustrated 
by the consequences of the rapid penetration rate of information 
and communication technology (ICT) devices. Besides the 
success story of these devices becoming ubiquitous, there is also 
a visible decline in performance of the ICT industry in financial 
respects. Due to more intense competition and market saturation, 
the players in this industry are now facing limited revenue 
sources. Among other things, traditional TV industry offering 
broadcasting services is suffering a significant drop in viewers 
and advertising revenue because of the massive substitution 
effect of the vast penetration rate of Internet and broadband. It is 
then important to see how the innovation of ICT devices can 
create possible alternative sources of revenue. Vibrant ICT 
devices, which combine television (video), telecommunication 
(audio) and data (Internet) in so-called triple play may enable 
operators to obtain additional revenue. IPTV (the TV which is 
transmitted to the Internet protocol) is seen as a strong new 
triple-play device which can support ICT as well as being a 
precursor of further economic impact, especially in driving 
output multipliers and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This 
study is aimed at investigating the economic impact of IPTV 
deployment in the European countries, using the Input-Output 
table. The method enables us to estimate the economic multiplier 
for each Euro investment in IPTV deployment as well as to 
estimate the contribution to the GDP from two main sources: the 
production phase, when the deployment is implemented by 
installing fiber and network to the household, and the diffusion 
phase, where the consumption of IPTV services increases after 
the completion of the investment project. Among fourteen 
European countries investigated, the study reveals that Sweden is 
the country which enjoys the highest level of impact due to the 
construction activities, while Austria gets the larger portion of 
the multiplier from the diffusion side.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
There is evidence that the ICT industries have been 
facing very difficult conditions in the last couple of years, 
especially in plain old traditional services. For instance, 
British Telecom (BT) retail revenue from traditional 
services decreased by 3% in 2008. In cellular industry, the 
Belgian incumbent operator, Belgacom, suffered similarly 
when its revenue from voice subscription dropped by 2% in 
2007, with another loss of about 11% from voice traffic. In 
most Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) countries, the market maturity and 
fall in retail price are seen as the drivers for this situation 
[1].  
The gradual decline of communication consumption also 
indicates why this recession afflicts most of the ICT 
industry in OECD countries. The annual data on the ratio of 
expenditure on communication to GDP shows that the ratio 
has been declining gradually. Even though the ratio dropped 
only slightly from 3% (2006) to 2.9% (2008) throughout the 
EU (15 countries) as shown in the following Fig. 1, it has 
dropped substantially for major and leading ICT countries 
like Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway and Finland. 
For instance, Germany dropped from 2.9% (2006) to 2.6% 
(2008), and the Netherlands has continued declining from 
2.7% (2006) to 2.4% (2008).

As a result, it is not surprising that investment in this 
sector is also affected by the recession. From the data 
comprising 33 European countries, the average annual 
growth of telecommunication investment during 2000-2006 
was -6% compared to 16.2% during the period 1995-2000. 
Fig. 2 shows the decline of telecommunication investment 
which began massively in 2001.

(MEUR) 
 
This situation has to be anticipated by the European 
countries, since the slowdown in investment in the 
information and communication sector may be followed by 
the falling in the productivity level. This is, moreover, 
supported by the reason that the increase of investment in 
ICT capital (and growth of human capital) contributed 
significantly to labor productivity growth in market services 
across all European countries and the US [2]. Therefore, a 
decline of investment in the ICT sector might affect the rate 
of productivity in the EU economy. It has been proven by 
the fact that since the mid-1990s, the European Union has 
experienced a slower growth of productivity where, at the 
same time, the United States is significantly boosted. The 
steady growth of productivity in the United States is 
indicated to be due to a combination of high levels of 
investment in a rapidly progressing ICT sector, especially 
during the second half of the 1990s. It is also followed by a 
rapid productivity growth in the market services sector 
during the first half of the 2000s [3].   
This phenomenon, especially in the broadcasting 
industry, has actually been predicted before. The significant 
drops in advertising revenue together with the delay in the 
rollout of digital broadcasting are among the reasons why 
the industry has faced obstacles recently [4]. In the US, as a 
comparison, broadcasters are asking the audience to view 
each show “live” to ensure the audience to the advertisers 
and consequently get them to finance subsequent episodes 
of the show [5]. From the surveys conducted in some 
countries, it is discovered that the largest channels in each 
country are suffering a decline in their ratings. Although the 
aggregate revenue still increases across Europe during 2006-
2008, the public broadcasting sector has seen a drop of more 
than 4 percentage points in its total market share, while the 
commercial sector (both radio and TV financed by 
advertising) has grown modestly [6]. It is also predicted that 
the advertising revenues of traditional channels are not 
likely to grow significantly over the next decade. Using two 
different econometric models, it is estimated that the gradual 
decline is around 0.2–0.5% [7]. 
Thus, there is a need to grasp any possibility for industry 
players to create new devices which synergize ICT function, 
especially utilizing the fast growth of current ICT 
penetration rate. Compared to other devices (e.g. cellular, 
internet), broadband is still relatively in the stage of further 
diffusion process in European countries where  the 
broadcasting industry can be supported. Fig. 3 shows the 
impressive growth of broadband penetration in the European 
countries.

Figure 3. Average European countries’ broadband penetration rate per 
100 inhabitants 
 
To operationalize this strategy, there are seven pillars 
with which broadband creates a significant impact in the 
economy: E-health, E-government, E-environment, E-
business, E-employment, E-science and E-agriculture [8]. 
Thus, combining the broadband with television and 
telecommunication attached to these functions might 
generate an additional niche market in each European 
country. To address this issue, IPTV is seen as part of triple-
play devices that might be an alternative product to provide 
a variety of services. 
This study aims at investigating the economic impact of 
IPTV investment in the selected European countries. To 
answer the research question on how much will the IPTV 
investment contributes on the European economy, the study 
is presented in the following sections: Section 2 presents the 
nature of IPTV and variety of services offered to the 
customer. The mechanics of the Input-Output (IO) table as 
the main methodology is discussed in Section 3. Some 
previous analysis is presented in Section 4.  The data used in 
this study is elaborated in Section 5. The results of the study 
are shown in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper.   
 
II. THE IPTV 
 
The Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) is viewed over a fixed 
broadband connection (DSL or Fiber to the home, FTTH) 
with a standard telecommunication set. The services are 
offered over a closed content distribution network whose 
common services cover TV broadcasting and stored video 
on demand (VOD), and the personal video recorder [9]. 
Additionally, not only can IPTV platform support a range of 
digital utility services, such as e-health, e-learning, e-
working and home security – in contrast to the traditional

television, it also provides more control and choice for the 
customer [10]. Fig. 4 explains how the IPTV comprises a 
variety of services for the end users.

The development of IPTV in Europe shows positive  
growth. By the end of 2008, the total of IPTV subscribers  
had reached 21.7 million, which is an increase of 63% 
compared to the end of 2007 [11]. Additionally, it is 
predicted that the number of subscribers will continuously 
increase until the end of 2012. Even though the domination 
will be still in America, Western European countries are 
seen as a substantial market which will developed even 
further [12]. Fig. 5 shows the forecasted numbers of 
subscribers up to 2012 on major continents.

Fig. 6 forecasts there will be more than 64 million IPTV 
subscribers worldwide by the end of 2012, with the 
European market representing almost 38% of total 
subscribers.  
III. THE INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL 
The input-output table depicts the transaction flow 
across sectors, where each sector produces a certain output 
and consumes input from another sector at the same time.  
The table consists of three main quadrants. The first 
quadrant describes the inter-linkage between sectors in a so-
called intermediate transaction, while the quadrants II and 
III are the final demand and primary input respectively [13]. 
The table is shown in the following Fig. 6. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Input-Output (IO) table 
 
The flow of transaction in the table can be explained in 
the following equation (1). Assumed the economy consist of 
4 sectors. 
 
                            
 
(1) 
                           
                           
                           
 
 
where     denotes the output from sector i which is used 
by sector j as an intermediate input (the input from sector i 
which is used for further production process in sector j). 
Moreover,     refers to total final demand of sector i and    
refers to total output of sector i. 
 
Introducing matrix notation, we can modify equation (1) 
to obtain the following matrix: 
   
  
 
  
      
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
(2) 
Equation (2) is the matrix form of equation (1), where x 
denotes the column matrix for output and c is the column 
matrix for the final demand. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      
   
 
   
 
 
 
   
 
   
  
(3) 
Matrix (3) consists of two parts; the left-hand side is the 
identity matrix, a diagonal matrix whose off-diagonals are 
zero. Whereas A is the technology matrix which consists of 
the ratio of the intermediate demand to the total output,
   
 . 
By combining (1), (2) and (3), the equation can be 
modified as follows: 
 
 
 
488

(4) 
        
            
 
From (4), the multiplier is defined as the inverse 
Leontief matrix,        [13].  It measures the ratio of 
output changes in the equilibrium as the result of the change 
in the final demand.  Therefore, the output multiplier 
measures total change throughout the economy from a unit 
change in final demand. The final demand itself might come 
from 
private 
consumption, 
government 
expenditure, 
investment and export. As the consequence of production 
linkages, a change of output will be larger than a change in 
the final demand. For instance, if the final demand of the 
ICT sector (e.g. additional purchasing of personal 
computers) increases by 10 EUR, the output in the economy 
will grow by more than 10 EUR or as much as the multiplier 
coefficient of this sectors. (Additional purchasing of 
personal computers will induce packaging services and 
transportation, for instance). 
There is a reason that the firm level of analysis is a more 
appropriate approach to investigate the productivity impact 
from such an ICT investment.  However, relying on meso 
studies can also lead one into the trap of a productivity 
paradox where the contribution of ICT is not absorbed in 
statistical reports or a so called Solow computer paradox 
[14]. Therefore, applying the Input-Output (IO) analysis in 
this study enables investigation at sector level, which has a 
direct link to firm level as well as to macro level. The 
intermediate transaction in quadrant I consists of the data 
gathered from an industry survey [13], [15], [16]. Moreover, 
the relation between the IO and the macro variable is very 
much straightforward. The primary inputs in quadrant II 
reflect the measurement of the Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) by the income approach, comprising wages, salary, 
profit, etc. In addition, the final demand in quadrant II 
shows the calculation of the GDP as the sum of 
consumption, investment, government spending, and export 
and (minus) import [14]. 
Apart from that, the reason for using the IO method is 
also supported given the difficulties when measuring the 
indirect impact of ICT investment [17].  In this regards, IO 
has strong ability for capturing the direct and indirect impact 
from such an investment outlays [16]. Consequently, 
employing the IO method enables the estimation from both 
production and diffusion process of ICT sectors investment 
[18]. 
IV. PREVIOUS STUDIES 
There have been vast investigations of the impact of ICT 
on the economy using econometrics or the IO method.  
Applying the panel data of US municipalities, it shows that 
the broadband will generate economic impact through 
creating employment, increasing housing rent, industrial 
mix and stimulating business establishment [19]. It is also 
estimated that the contribution of broadband to employment 
and productivity is visible in Latin America.  Employing the 
IO method, it is suggested that to fulfill the increasing 
demand for broadband requires an additional 41% lines, 
which will contribute 378,000 more new jobs [20]. In the 
United States, the contribution of broadband to job creation 
is about 128,000 new jobs whereby each job will cost 
50,000 US$. This result is determined from both network 
construction and network externalities, though the latter is 
less consistent due to uncertainty surrounding that impact 
[21] 
A study in Indian economy concludes that the 
economics of information technology in the country is 
mainly supported by domestic demand. Therefore, to 
increase the performance of the Indian economy to be able 
to contribute on the GDP, it is important to boost the 
contribution from export; thus it requires stronger linkage 
between telecommunication and infrastructure facilities 
(power, water supply, and transportation). It is also found 
that private and government expenditure contributes 
respectively 32% and 26% while the investment contributes 
only 13%. In addition, among the export drivers, 
communication equipment and electronics equipment are 
the most dominant sector [22]. Similar study found a 
significant contribution of the ICT sector to the Singapore 
economy. It is estimated that each 10% increase in 
information input price during 1995-2000 will generate 
0.84% increase in GDP growth which is twice the figure for 
the 5-year period before. Moreover, there was a shift from 
the export driver in the first half of 1990 to the domestic 
demand during the second half of the period [18].  
Among the previous analyses using the IO method, this 
study is the first to investigate a comparison between several 
countries. It is explained that the productive use of ICTs 
requires organizational and working practice changes, and 
depends 
on 
contextual 
factors 
such 
as 
transport 
infrastructure, cultural values, and the routines organizing 
everyday life [23]. Therefore, a comparative study is a more 
appropriate way to see different characteristics of ICT 
utilization among countries. 
V. THE DATA 
This study will use the data of 59-Input Output Table 
from selected European countries. To attain the goal of the 
study, the analysis uses the domestic transaction of the IO 
table. The available years for each country are shown in the 
following Table 1.

As has been discussed, the investigation of the impact of 
the ICT sector should be made with two sources of growth: 
the production and diffusion [17], [24]. The production 
phase 
refers 
to 
the 
investment 
and 
infrastructure 
development of the IPTV whereas the diffsion is 
investigated in relation to induce income as the consumption 
increases from households. Thus, the calculation of the 
multiplier is done as shown in the following steps in Fig. 7. 
 
 
 
Figure 7. Two sources of output multiplier 
 
The next important question to be addressed is how to 
define and match the IPTV deployment with the existing IO 
table. The following flow chart explains how this study is 
conducted. 
 
Figure 8. Flow of studies 
 
The IPTV investment is established especially to enable 
consumers to use HDTV and ultimately 3DTV; hence it 
requires an advanced penetration of infrastructure. A high-
speed large-scale rollout of fiber networks is to be 
connected to the households [9]. Therefore, it is assumed 
that assessing this criterion with the template of the IO table, 
the investment activities are grouped into sector number 34 
(Construction). In addition, based on the Statistical 
Classification of Economics Activities (SCEA), the 
appropriate sub-sector for the investment activities is the 
installation of electrical wiring and fitting (SCEA code 
45.31). Moreover, the diffusion impact which is measured 
from consumption after the finishing of investment 
activities is grouped into  the telecommunication sector 
(sector number 43). 
Furthermore, the value of investment in this study 
follows the assumptions as follows [9]: 
(i) Investment is implemented throughout European 
countries to enable people to access the IPTV services. 
(ii) The annual investment is 10 BEUR yearly for all 
European countries. The budget for each household is 
around 1150-1700 EUR/household.  
(iii) Investment cost is assumed to decrease by 2% per 
year due to more efficient fiber rollout techniques. 
(iv) Investment for each country is proportionally 
distributed, based on the number of households. 
Applying these scenarios, the value of investment for 
each country can be shown in the following Fig. 9.

countries which have the largest investment in the IPTV 
deployment are Germany, France, the UK and Italy.   
VI. RESULTS 
The first analysis in this study is explaining the 
multiplier effect of IPTV investment on economy. Using 
equation (4), the results of multiplier calculation are 
presented in the following Table 2.

Table 2 shows that Sweden, Austria and Italy are the 
European countries which have the highest output 
multiplier. Additionally, the fraction of GDP is measured by 
taking the ratio of Net Value Added to Total Output. In this 
regard, Sweden and Poland are the two countries which 
have the highest fraction of GDP over output.  
Furthermore, 
the 
multiplier 
from 
the 
diffusion 
(consumption) of IPTV industry is shown below:

Unlike the results from investment activities, the 
consumption activities on table 3 show that Austria and 
Belgium are the countries which enjoy the highest multiplier 
among European countries during the diffusion process. 
The next analysis is the aggregation of multiplier on the 
European level. It is assumed that each European country 
can be analyzed separately and faces the market 
independently. Thus, the aggregation at regional level is 
done by applying the scenario that the multiplier is 
proportional to the number of households and value of the 
GDP. The result can be seen in the following Fig. 10. 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Aggregation of multiplier 
 
From Fig. 10, it is quite interesting to see that both 
approaches come up with a similar estimate. The multiplier 
for European regions ranges around 1.95-2.08. It means that

every 1 EUR of additional investments in IPTV deployment 
will yield 1.95-2.08 EUR for the next 10 years. 
The last step in this analysis estimates the impact of 
output creation from the investment cost projected in Fig. 10 
and the diffusion. Having found that the multiplier ranges 
around 2, the impact of additional investment during the 
project period is forecasted in the following Fig. 12. In this 
study, scenario 1 is measured by using the GDP as the 
weighted index, while scenario 2 uses the number of 
households. 
 
 
 
Figure 11. The output impact of IPTV deployment investment (BEUR) 
 
From Fig. 11, it is estimated that the output impact will 
be smaller as a result of the decreasing value of investment 
over time. The impact on the GDP is shown in the following 
Fig. 12. 
 
 
 
Figure 12. The impact of IPTV deployment investment on the GDP 
(BEUR) 
As indicated by the fraction of the GDP to output, Fig. 
12 shows that the impact of investment to output will be 
smaller. This is due to the fact that most OECD countries 
have an open economy, which is indicated by the large 
volume of trade (export and import). As a result, the fraction 
of GDP will be around 70% of the total investment.

Table 4 depicts the output multiplier from the 
consumption side. It is projected that each 1 EUR additional 
consumption of IPTV services will generate additional 
output around 1.7 EUR. Moreover, the contribution to GDP 
is explained in the following Fig. 13. 
 
 
 
Figure 13. The fraction of IPTV consmption  on the GDP (BEUR) 
 
From Fig. 13 it can be seen that the contribution of IPTV 
consumption to GDP is around 0.52-0.55 from output. If the 
consumption of IPTV services increases by 100 EUR, it will 
generate output as large as the multiplier 170 EUR. 
Additionally, from the amount of output, 55% (about 93.5 
EUR) will be directly formed as value added or GDP. 
VII. CONCLUSION 
The study draws the following important conclusions: 
(1) The impact of IPTV deployment contributes to 
both investment activities and additional consumption 
activities (as the project ended). 
(2) The contribution in generating output multiplier 
varies across countries. Sweden has to be considered as the 
largest contributor in terms of investment activities, while

Austria and Belgium are among the largest in terms of the 
output from consumption. 
(3) In aggregation, the IPTV project has a multiplier of 
1.9-2.1 in all the European countries. At the same time, the 
GDP contribution will be around 0.40-0.41. A lower or 
higher fraction of GDP is found in consumption activities. 
It is then recommended that IPTV development has to be 
supported by the collaboration between the broadcasting and 
manufacturing industry player where both are capable of 
providing services to customer  in the type of supply side 
network externalities (hardware-software relationship) [20].      
The limitation of this study is related to the aggregation 
problem in the IO table. Two sources determine the level of 
aggregation: (1) the problem being considered, of whether 
or not it is important to distinguish the sector until the detail 
level; (2) computational expense and availability of the data. 
Consequently, when deciding that the IPTV rollout is 
classified as the construction sector, it might cause crude 
multiplier estimation since conventional construction, for 
instance, needs stone and cement in a higher proportion, 
which is not the case in fiber installation. Thus, the 
aggregation bias might weaken this result [13].
